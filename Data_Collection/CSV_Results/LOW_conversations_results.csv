Sears announced selling its Kenmore products on Amazon that have resulted in its soaring of prices by 18%. This have caused in decline of prices of Lowes and Home Depot by almost 4%.

Lowe’s stock price $100 overpriced.

"Hey you fools, go to I-Hub where I hang out for 15 years. I told you all Ellison is a #$%$ and now a protege of his from HD he is taking from JCP. He will ruin YOU shareholders here as he enriches himself and his friends ONLY by tricky bookkeeping trickery and false earnings talks, etc like he did at JCP...JCP don't need his kind and deserves a real caring CEO for shareholder there. Institutionals know this and why JCP stock this week saw large increase of Institutionals buying for portfolios, and JCP is doing very well actually.. .SEC needs to investigate Ellison definitely after this, as it is too apparent what his motives are to me and others..."
LOL. Ex-dividend and it drops.
thumps up or down for earnings?
EARNINGS ARE GOING TO BE CRAZZYYY 
Down -2.4%
"They had a hold rating on LOW to start with, FUNNY O and they are wrong again."
"have both stores across from each other.. hd is way better with people who are actually retired trades and have some knowledge.. lowes has no skilled help.. merch is comparable and find neither superior over the other.. paint in hd is twice as good as lowes.. appliances better at lowes .. so if someone told me that 1 had to close, i would have to keep hd.. find it in more locations and better sales..hd has better div and pe is close to same.imo"
Texas gotta rebuild and new landscaping.

"Political comments, please go to a political board. This is a Lowes stock message board."
Selling is not over
LOW and HD are unstoppable. They continue to march higher even in the face of what's going on in Washington. Their ascent from the pandemic floor has gone virtually uninterrupted. Long and strong both although my LOW return dwarfs my HD return.
Another down day.
"This is a trash company with a Zero customer service. I bought an appliance, it did not work, the exchange is damage. The store manager is busy having lunch, the district manger has no phone. Where in the world a district manger is not reachable.My battle with them is going for a two months."
LOW reached a new All Time High at 111.90
"The local store is PACKED! Hopefully I'll have some gains in this to offset the $2000 I've spent there in the past 2 weeks! Starbucks too, the drive thru is causing traffic jams 3 times a day. There are a few businesses that are doing well in all this craziness."
There's a lot to learn about a house!
3:45 dump show continues

BLowe’s
Thoughts on Amazon buying Lowes?
This thing better drop dead
absolutely disgusting makes no sense
I’m selling. Sorry. :(
"Lowe's is taking the same route as Best Buy. Nobody shops there, they just go see what the new state of the art appliances, and then go to Home Depot where it comes out at a later date, but much cheaper."
THIS IS TRICKING U GUYS WATCH AND SEE
I could see us getting up to maybe $165 by the end of the week hopefully. That’s around where we should be at right now. GLTA!
How'd the lousy shorts like today? The chadwink moron got run off. And tomorrow more pain for short idiots.
Hold and add more 120 price target
Where low competes against Menards..they always lose.
"I can understand short term traders selling LOW today, but anyone selling that planned on being in Lowes long term is badly misinterpreting the big picture IMO. The long term story is a strong if not stronger than ever. Good luck to LOW longs!"
a break above 94 and change could mean a run at 100 a share again
"This company is doing so well it can afford to buy back billions in stock. Cramer and other analysts have called it undervalued due to new record high home ownership. I’m holding this and HD in my portfolio long, folks. 2021 is going to be a great year."
Looks like new Lows are on the way. HD down big as well
MAN MAN MAN U GUYS FOOLS
"""Vaccine announced. Guess I better unload my retail housing materials stock since nobody will be renovating houses anymore because they're off catching flights and partying on cruise ships""LOLJust another rotation based on the headlines. I'm buying more in anticipation for earnings. GLTA"
Where is the dividend increase ??
down baby down!
Buying over $114 has not worked out for anybody in the last several years. Does anybody think it will suddenly break the pattern this time? Why?
"Div payday today, along with price appreciation along the way, funds my vacay... thanks LOW!...."
Lowe's Companies is down 7.50% to 97.41
"$WMT with $82 average price target... where is the upside here? $AAP hammered, $LOW hammered. I shop there but isn't this thing in the nose bleed section for retail stocks? Sorry just shocked it has not gone much lower yet as I look for a position in it possibly after a real pullback as it is a great company."
Low ready for stock run up.AZEK the Thinking man's stock pick.
"I don't buy the 4th quarter eps number. That said, it was a blow out quarter. I think they have a lot of inventory they didn't write down and they won't sell. They're obsessed with shrink and hide a lot of problems. That said, their experiment with cutting employees was the right move. They were smart. I work summers there and am very good at what I do. Was in the store last week and it looked great."
How Lowe can it go?
CEO Only got the job because he’s black. Certainly not because of his poor performance at JCPenney!!!
"2020 sales growth is pretty good. it was crazy crowded during the summer at my 3 area local stores. their Lowes card offers 5% off purchases for credit users. 3Q earnings call (11/18) must be the big bet. I am not shocked with this breakout, its been trying and going up since May."
Low will beat Depot’s earnings buy a significant amount. Market had been looking for Low to show they can do this repeatedly. Low will shoot up tomm and keep the train moving towards $200. Bank it!
Lowe's Companies reached a 52 Week low at 85.00
This is a clear buy. It's going to beat estimates. Huge increase in revenue. HD was weak....haha
HERE I GO MAN NO JOKE HERE IT GOES
"With Lowe’s and Home Depot out of a lot of inventory for the last month or more, they are jacking up prices on lawn and garden supplies etc.I would be skeptical about the profitability of this quarter!"
Merry Christmas!!!
GO DOWN MORE BABY GO DO DOWN MORE
"Operating margin issues, untrained, knowledgeable employees, guess I had it pretty well nailed. Where is Joe Don't Know?"
Well at least were all on the same page. ILLRASONAL
GIVE THIS DAMN THING A CHANCE COME DOWN
Home Depot and Lowe’s are cut in half If a competition emerges. Possibilities are there.
"Sept 29, 2020Lowe's Companies Inc. on Tuesday said it will restart a previously suspended share repurchase program, which it temporarily suspended earlier this year as a result of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.The retailer said there is currently $8.7 billion remaining under the program's authorization. *Get some chips and buy the dip!"
OK GUYS WE BROUGHT LOWES DOWNTO ITS KNEES
Lowe's is going nowhere fast. Two things to help it move are increase dividend yield and stock split. They need to stop worrying about management boss check.
COVERING BECAUSE SHORT SQUEEZE MIGHT COME NEVER KNOW
Should i sell or hold on to it?
Housing boom is just getting started. Lowe?s has the best service and assortments compared to its competitors. Decent balance sheet and reducing share count. Also one of the most over looked points. The last housing boom 2002-2007 construction quality was complete #$%$ these houses are nearing 20 years old and will need many updates and repairs!! Great long term hold!
"HD same store sales fell as well, how are those Trump tariff taxes working out? wait till 25% tariff earnings cause a recession.....gonna be a blast"
Why is Low's stock price is sort of muted while the market is going up.
LOWES NOT GOING ON TV RED ON CRAMER SHOW IM BUYING 300K SHARES TOTAL
"check Zillow housing report, see what the report forecast the market which is slowing down"
Is Lowe’s closing stores as well?
HOME DEPOT ABOUT GO GREEN TOO
HD is what he knows! but he does not know consumer retail like JC
Lowe's will go the way of K-Mart and Sears and RiteAid. There is no reason for Lowe's to exist.
What an overreaction
New board blocks impersonation...5 stars
"yowzah, up >36% in < 5 months since last buy, plus one div and another coming ! Summer div increase should be mid-teens %, to ~.55, or $2.10 yearly... conservatively. Like the 4 for $10 potted vegetable plants, I buy LOW low to grow.."
"Be sure you are BOYCOTTING AMAZON. Amazon is a cancer that is trying to take all the retail dollars. Even though Amazon is not shippng 2 x 4's, it can ship tools, etc. BOYCOTT AMAZON. Don't be so naive as to think one little purchase won't hurt. Cancer spreads fast and Amazon is a cancer."
jpm the dividend gets issued april 20th 60 cent a share 300 shares that's around 165$
Where did Joe go?
OKAY WILL IM GOING TO COVER 500K MORE SHARES THAT GIVES ME OVER MILLION IN PROFIT THANK U LOWES
Looking pretty steady to me.
Shorts are in control now and I thought with all the Chines Tariff invest in American companies to be safe.
Why is anyone selling below $78?
hmmmm...article says paying bonuses... you dont pay bonuses unless your making really good profit!!!!next ER will be amazing...
"stores restricting employee work hours, slowed hiring, walk the store, empty during the week! Housing strong, but people are done with their current home improvements. Last quarter reflected customers pulling forward in house jobs. Look for OK sales for 3rd but a weak 4th quarter forecast. Stock buy point 130-140. Lowes Employee"
lets check back with oppenheimer when this baby is 190 to 200 ridiculous downgrade lowes store are humming and busy stay tuned.....
"The Military discount is now as low as one penny per transaction. Not kidding. Lowe's still promotes the discount as 10%, but they actually rebate almost nothing. Quite a big lie.Talk to anyone at a store register."
Unbelievable gains made today on my DIS calls. I will be buying more of the LOW January 2020 Calls if we get another dip tomorrow! Earnings next week 
"Take it from a JCP investor casualty. Marvin Ellison is a terrible CEO. He nearly ruined HD, It has taken over a year and we’re still not recovered at JCP from his lunacy, and now you guys ended up with him. Bad customer service by firing everybody is penny wise and pound foolish. I really hate him for what he did to what was a recovering company."
Citi upgrade with a target price of 112.
Food and shelter will always be needed. You will ALWAYS need a loews. Best stock to own right now!!
Damn we’re down. Don’t panic buy more.
Going much higher folks. Like I said before big money involved here. Don’t fight the trend.
"Higher rates in September , not so good for housing ..."
Wow Lowes seems to be closing it on Home Depot quickly.￼
Here’s the way I see it. Ellison emptied JCP warehouses at blowout prices below cost and the SSS went up and the Bottom line was massacred. Now I see the same thing at Lowe’s. I came on here months back and said as much. Have you seen JCP stock lately?? Know what to look for in a CEO and especially where he came from and what he is about................ace
chad is a wacko.. thumbs up if you agree
m
"Wake up and smell the bear trap! Every time bears get trapped in this thing. Stop selling at bottoms, idiots!"
Nice day to buy a dip!
what were these fools doing
Have you seen the promotions they have been running at Lowe's since the beginning of the year. They simply have gone with the plan of BUYING the customers from HD and getting them into their stores. That will only last so long before they diluted their margin.
Have you ever seen the Dow Down 2000 in one day? Please save this!
"Lowes has the best and most ready available disaster relief supply chain network from the manufacturers to provide electricity generators that fema will have to buy asap in Florida. Better than Home Depot. Lowes is comperable but much better than Home Depot in that supply chain. Both companies however will do fine this quarter. . The home is the largest single family asset and continuing and progressive repairs will be made to all the damaged property. They may write checks directly from the Federal budget to restore homes instead of buying trailers that are more costly for thousands of residents. LOWES will hit $100 easily. The spending will be enourmous by the federal government. Insurance will pay for new roofs. Roofs, drywall,flooring, paint, windows, dehumidifiers, A/C and heating equipment, hot water tanks all will be needed. And contracts with suppliers is gauranteed profit for Lowes. Customers can't buy direct from manufacturers. We hope and pray that all in the damaged areas are made whole. Even it costs the entire country a contribution. Tax cuts will have to wait now."
lows is up
DPW is up 5% happy trading
"This is a keeper!I admire those in here who've been in this for a long time.Looking at the charts, I think a breakout is about to happen."

"Just spent 7 months working at LOW and was shocked at lack of professionalism in our store's management team. Plus, their technology is a disaster. They are still using DOS for their pricing and inventory control applications. Employees were stuck doing IRPs with pencil and paper. Scheduling is largely done with a roulette wheel - making everyone mad. If you're smart, at least have a stop loss on this stock."
"WSM housing is back and LOW is just fine. Nothing goes straight up BUY on dips welcome to WS. I guess some got in last qtr and are very upset we sold them shares and will be buying those shares back around 76 I'm buying or I'll wait. LGIH,WY,,APOG,BBY,USG. JOBS JOBS JOBS=== Drill baby drill 100,000 a yr not bad for a kid out of high school or joint the Military and learn discipline."
"sells his shares down to the price he wants to drive it too,. people panic and sell,. house buys back shares at a lower price and is sitting pretty.....course doesnt really win until cashes in,. OR does it again.........nerve racking for others"
Why is this stock down twice what the overall market is?
buybacks happening yet?
Home depot hours of business 6am to 6pm. it will effect future earnings. Now Lowe's doesn't need to change the it time to copy. it's time to winn over their customer. FYI.
stay short !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!markets are done........................... Permanent RECESSION if BIDEN gets in !
"6 downthumbs for my last post regarding the fact that buyback window closed meaning they can’t buyback their shares which was driving this higher. Why sheeples? You just want me to pump and dump fake news? Come on, at least engage in some counter arguments and discord."
hi my name is Ganlin. if you click on my name you will see I'm a Yahoo chat board troll. I troll many stocks bashing them all day. I have no money to Invest so all I can do is troll and bash.

He went to Yahoos main office and swabbed the computer floors . Wet mop got tangled in Yahoos server and shorted it out. My ID was changed and the screen doesn't look the same as yesterday. It'll never be the same .
Vanguard/Blackrock are toxic to stock performance;
as a realistic view when you go in stores now people holding few items in line. summer it was pallets and carts full. take profits. or write calls
SORRY SHORTS ITS ABOUT TO JUMP
It has been an amazing 28 year ride! Thank you LOWES....
The Walmart business model isn't working for Lowes.

I am seeing more Craftsman tools in Lowe’s. Are they going to get rid of the kobalt tool line?
"Interactive Brokers pay me 1.2% annual interest on the cash from my shorted shares, so it doesn’t cost me anything to short except for the maintenance margin. This thing will not last until the next earnings when reality sets in."
all elections related. snatching this big bargain next week
"This is one of the worst service oriented companies. Their installation services and customer service are an utter joke. They work with contractors that are negligent, and not even qualified to do the projects they are paid for. Flaky, incompetent and negligent with the appliances, granite or product paid to install. Lowe’s simply moves you around from one department to another for an endless period of time, if you file for a resolution. It’s a joke to see this at over 100."
Up on no volume......................dang.

The markets don't like company selling their stock and use proceeds for corporate purposes.
Time for AMZN to come and grab LOW to fill their Home/improvement area.
Most of you don't realize that the shelves are bare. No pressure treated wood. No decking. No accessories in outside garden. Not much coming in from China.How do you sell what you don't have? No ETA on anything.

"John S and Kayak..so, i went to lowes here in Houston. talked to "" old timer"" been with lowes for 8 years...he said... sales have been up since covid started.. which we all suspected.. but then, walked away from him to go get a breaker, found 2 employees pulling "" top stock"", i asked "" hows inventory holdin up?""... without hesitation one employee says... not good at all. tbe second employee was little more upbeat with "" as well as can be expected"""".so, i agree that sales are ginna be good to finish this quarter, maybe?... with this information and knowlege of supply chain issues due to covid, i sold my shares yedterday..ginna put into roku!"
did the ceo close all those stores just so he can keep getting paid his huge salary for nothing over paid ceo and stores suk..
This is a temporary dip which should be taken advantage of. LOW is not a wildly overvalued stock. These are inflation concerns which will subside quickly. Every stock is down today. The short case on LOW is still incredibly weak. Short this at your own peril. When this is $300 you'll be on the streets begging for pocket change.
Why such a low book value? Do they not own a lot of the real estate their stores are on?
$low tick up!
Can we see $130 today guys
Lowes has send 400 trucks to Florida this week

$LOW Downgrades KeyBanc Sector Weight
2 of the 3 top suppliers to Lowes are chinese - Shenzhen Jiawei and Hangzhou. I'm wondering to what extent tariffs are affecting profitablilty.
IM COVERING ALL MY SHORTS NOW
"Consider: LOW is up 116% in one year, nearly double the return of both HD and S&P500.. not too shabby %^)"
IM TRYING COVER AT GOOD PRICES
HE WILL KEEP IT AROUND THERE
People long on this #$%$ stock; ever try to order anything from Lowe's? Ever look at Yelp reviews?
Added more Friday to Roth..
"LOWE's last stock split was in 2006. Up until then, LOWE's stock had split about every 4.5 years. Was the best kept secret in America where you could retire from LOWE's after fifteen years a millionaire. I'm talking about store employees. I know the business structure has changed but was wanting a estimate of when you think their stock will split again."
What is Lowes going to do with all those Orchard Supply stores that were closed and are they losing money on that deal?
BUY HD let lowes come down
"$148 - $149 is a steal for long term investors. They missed by a penny as to EPS. As with HD with a Covid-19 cure , Wall Street is indicating that those who shopped LOWS will no longer shop in those numbers. But in the long run retailer shoppers will return and shop LOWS not to mention the holidays are here and many will shop LOWS.."
Bubble #$%$ ruining the game
GOING TO $66 RANGE
Something doesn’t make sense when looking at their balance sheet. Why did they go out and get a billion dollar line of credit for 12 months. Sounds like mismanagement or needed cash. Sell some stock at historic levels. Additionally they just sold bonds too.
sell sell sell to drop price and buy on cheaper before they blow away earnings!!
I am new to this bb and see it is of little value.I had asked questions regarding earnings and comparison to HD and they were ignored.Pie eyed optimists give ignorant posts.It is what it is.Good luck
"Peeps will be selling into the close, typical to sell into the long weekend?"
What the hell is wrong with LOW
"Interesting- the DE's all came out from under the rocks to comment when LOW price dropped to the low $80's this time. Before they had come out in the low $70's. Now we're back to the mid 80's. We saw another Amazon scare drop, the first which I used to buy in at $71.30 after a great Q2 report. So now it's up >18.5% in 3 months, plus a dividend. Not too shabby..."
$93.5 will not last very long
GOOD JOB SELL SELL SELL
Ready for Wednesday. $170 at least!
Is anyone adding near this $97 level? Looks like a good entry point.
Let's see if the new CEO does the same thing as he did to JCP...Crash it to the ground.
"I do more shopping at Home Depot than Lowe's due to the proximity of the store, but what I do like about Lowe's is that it seems that they carry more products that are made in the USA, which I have bought at Lowe's.Both are great american companies. I'm not invested in neither."
"Please, someone buy buy buy so I can sell sell sell!"
Why is LOW down 5% this morning 7/20/17
CANT COVER BETTER RPICE THAN THIS
similar footprint to HD but only makes 40% of HD net income
it needs to be above $155ish after hours or pre-market $155 tomorrow !! support is 155ish and it tested new Lowe's at $152ish this thing can go to $133 but I'm still bullish
LOW is up 7.63% to 69.98
LOW on CNBC as I type. Should open higher.
Disappointed Lowe's seems a friendlier store than HD and at half the price with a great dividend which is coming due with ex div. date July 24.Retail sucks and it seems this stock is a sleeper.
Just reccomended as a buy today on CNBC.
need to check out MIK people staying home doing crafts for winter covid stay home
MARKET MAKE WILL PLAY WITH IT AROUND HERE MARKET MAKER HE IS A JERK PLAYING TAKE THIS P AND DOWN SO MUCH
"I suspect the LOW shorts in this discussion are the same person with multiple aliases. Only an idiot could look at LOW right now and say it's going to 0. With the housing market boom still in its infancy companies like Lowe's, Home Depot, and Sherwin Williams have almost zero downside risk as investments. Any dip should be bought. All 3 of these companies will trade at much higher prices several years from now and that's really not up for debate. Only an asteroid hitting the US and killing off a huge portion of its population or some other natural disaster on that scale would be the only reason the housing stocks wouldn't explode much higher. Given that an event like that has such a remote chance of happening it is suicide to be a short in the home builders and building supply retailers at this point in time."
Our local Lowe’s has revamped the tool world area. It was nice to see a large display of Craftsman tools.
WHILE MARKET UP HE IS STUPID
Really thought this would jump more with how this quarter performed...selling and moving elsewhere. Too slow for me. Good luck to the rest of you
Same store sales of 28%......this trend will continue through most of 2021 at least as people direct investment to their home.......great inflation hedge at low valuation!
Existing home sales surge nearly 21% in June – the highest monthly gain on recordGreat news for this quater and the next!!
LOW is up 5.77% to 90.70
Hahaha this POS is going down
My LOW shares are now up >46% in 5 months. Not too shabby! This should be a two-fer within 2 years from Aug.'17 buy. Plus dividends increasing yearly > inflation. It's a keeper..
"No way Lowes should be where it’s at. Dog $hKT earnings report, closing stores is the only thing that made this pop. Old JCPenny leaders as execs going to make this company tank"
Why are there always illegal aliens loitering around at Home Depot and not at lowes?
Any predictions on when this stock will be back in the 80s? 6 months? A year?
selling into earnings on retails biggest run in years... yeah good strategy  Don't say i didn't warn you.

"Lowes Q4 results beat predictions. This stock will head right back to 180, possibly higher. People will be buying springtime items soon, and economy is opening. Ignore the Lowes stockmongers."
U BETTER BUY SO MAKE YOUR AVERAGE BETTTER NOW U MORONS
I have a buddy who is a store manager at a Lowes here in Northern VA. He said that Marvin E came to his store and ran a checkout counter for over an hour and then took the time to speak to every associate on duty that day. Guy is an incredible manager and LOW will thrive under his leadership. Buying more on any pullback.
LOWES IS MUCH CHEAPER THAN HOME DEPOT IN SHARES I MUCH RATHER BUY LOWES HERE AT THIS PRICE ITS SUMMER TIME THIS THING WILL GO TO 130 AND HIGHER
"Debt is too much, corona risk, everybody touch on everything it's a disaster waiting to happen. Holding out on this one."
same pattern. every. single. day. gap up in the morning. dip. bullish rise. then sell off at the end of the day to trade the same or slightly above where the previous day close was. same annoying pattern over and over.

Wait..... isn't that what I'm supposed to do?!?! What could possibly go wrong?!?! Low volume exponential move.... closed the gap....Someone is getting ready to dump...... Look out below!!!

"TipRanks has Lowes 1 year price target at $193 for a medium. $193 would be a 22% upside from here. I had a sell limit at $169 for this week, but I decided to cancel that order and go long for a year or even more."
I'll take LOW under 160. Sell to me. I had sold out at 177.Starting a 1/5th of a position here.

"I still typically shop at LOW instead of HD, simply because I'm a shareholder, but I must say I'm not sure how much longer I'll be that shareholder. The company is managing for the short term in my opinion. They are focused on cost cutting, but instead of looking at how to be more efficient, they're taking the easy route and simply reducing employee costs. That tells me senior management is either out of ideas or simply doesn't want to work hard. It's obvious in the few LOW stores I frequent, there are less employees overall and even more concerning is that the remaining employees are less informed and less interested in customer service. This approach could result in near term earnings beats, better margins, etc., etc., but will likely result in exactly the opposite long term. Maybe management has fallen in to the Amazon trap and believe like many investors that AMZN cannot be beat. If that's the case, bring in new management. There is a lot LOW can do! - Figure out how to better cater to contractors and pull some of that business from HD.- Quickly grow the smaller Orchard Supply Hardware store base, but please don't ruin it.- Heck... Do something transformative and go buy TSCO (Tractor Supply Company). There would be lots of synergies, could likely get at a discount from historic levels and provide growth that LOW sorely needs. I know this is going out on a limb, but it's better than their current strategy.I've been in this for over 8 years and have done well. I'm going to hope for a nice little pop back to the low-mid $80's at which point I'll likely sell all my shares and move on. BTW... I don't believe HD is taking this same approach."
Ellison can't help but fail. Just look at the downgrades...

Wow. Actual DD an info sharing on a message board about a stock. People even asking for thoughts with honest responses. Glad I bought in yesterday and added more today. Happy to own a part of this great company.

GO DOWN LIKE EARLIER SHOW THIS MORONS GO DOWN
Lowe's is a buy plain simple.
SHORT IT
"HD had over $850 million expenses related to extra payments to employees due to Covid 19. I am surprised Lowe's din't mention any additional costs, their employees must have worked without extra compensation. It is kind of weird. Online sales are up 80%, so is HD's and they begin with much higher sales base. Going from 1 to 1.80 is not same as going from 3 to 5.40.HD stock goes down, Lowe's us, something doesn't add up here."
"Dave H.Hiring inexperienced people does not help. However, Home Depot is no better in customer service. The folks that were home in North Wilkesboro got the shaft."
"According to Foursquare's research, Lowe's would be a top acquistion candidate for Amazon. If that were to happen, LOW shares are going to the moon, baby. If not, it's a steady clime over time, with rock-solid increasing dividends. Caution: this info is for investots who are looking beyond a pop from a hurricane..."
"Amazon is a threat to LOW (and HD), but not because they'll now be selling Kenmore appliances on their site. I think that was ridiculously overblown today with $billions$ lost in market value today alone. With that said... I am a long term owner of LOW stock having been in since 2009 and am strongly considering unloading a big portion of my holding simply because I'm disappointed with the staffing levels in their stores. They should be investing more in people to differentiate themselves with customer service, but instead are cost cutting (fewer and poorly trained staff) and that's very hard road to get off of once you make that turn."
Remodelling and finishing house projects would be best thing to catch up on if people get quarantined at home for 14 days!
shouldn't this be going up?
Bought another lot again. Thank you!I'm buying every dip as this downtrend is only temporary as people flock the Covid stocks. This is not a stay-at-home stock and earnings report will be huge next week!

ITS COMING DOWN YES BABY YES BABY
Lowe’s will actually benefit from inflation since they take margin above cost on all items including high inflation lumber and building materials.....not sure why they are selling off even more than non profitable tech that will clearly be hurt by interest rate increases.
Larry Ellison is a class act CEO!! Seems to be a great buy!!
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 162.21
IF THEY GET GREEDY THEY WILL LOSE THATS ALL I GOT TO SAY
Stupid media calling this a Covid stock
bought today
"Real nice of Lowes to get people to buy their products, with the promise of rebates, and then not honorthem. I guess what they would like to do is keep the money, and hope nobody asks. Suggest peopleshop at Menards or Home Deport instead. MNMZ-4687-3289"
"LOW is still below it's earnings justified 5yr. blended P/E average of 21. That FV price for EOFY20 would be $183. With FY21 est. of 7% gain, FV for EOFY21 is $197."
Wow not the report I expected. They missed bad. Good thing I sold before the close yesterday. Guess were headed to $75 after all.

"Puts play, 17 aug. HD reports on 14th, my little wager is about forward looking statements from HD regarding tariffs and LOW would go down in sympathy. 1) Also the LOW noise about ex JCP ceo: cut labor to show profit in next report; the guy that drove JCP into the dirt, etc.2) Also, CNBC is made little to no mention of HD lately. Not being pumped anymore. No press, no interest. Until about a couple months ago HD was being pumped, an Amazon competitor, amazing, etc but now it is silence.3) LL took a nice hit.HD and LOW is getting no pump press. I could be wrong of course, thus the small wager.Thoughts?"
I’m bullish but looking at HD you got your answer
$102 on Monday
It is not a matter of lowes being better or worse than home depot. I think home depot is more for the pros out there as well as serious do it yourselfers. I see Lowes more directed towards woman. Prettier stores and more decoration items.Lowes will never surpass HD.
Buy LOW sell HIGH!
ITS DOING FAKE U SHAPE UP
"make no senses today. the better control of COVID which could better improve economy, the house market and more home improvement projects. ....It is crazy that Outlet mall increased 30% value today while Low lost 7% value...."
Lowe's needs more urgency in replacing Niblock. Get a new CEO named and in place to start turn around. Stock price gap between HD and Lowes continues to widen daily.
"I was wrong about Lowe’s and now I am paying for it. I thought that Lowe’s was catching up to HD. Apparently not, according to today’s earnings report."
sold
BY END OF TODAY LET THIS COME DOWN BUY HOME DEPOT
"Back to 100 or below.. Lowes stores are empty, clustered with product, horrible customer service."
"Lowe's should easily rise to 1.2 - 1.3 X Sales, which puts this at $95 - $100 per share."
"One condolence for the shorts and haters, every dollar rise is less %-wise than it was at $100..."

"The share price collapse is underway. Finally, some investors are taking measure of what is really going on."
"darn, wuz about to buy this morning..Shares of Lowe's Cos (LOW). (LOW) jumped as much as 6.5% in afternoon trading after Bloomberg reported that activist investor D.E. Shaw & Co. had built a stake in the retail home improvement chain. Bloomberg cited people familiar with the matter and said D.E. Shaw plans to push for change. (Austen.Hufford@wsj.com; @austenhufford)"
At a similar ratio LOW should payout .80 + per quarter.
What happened longs? Where are all the people who gave me thumbs down for shorting?
"market is turning higher and lk should be green today and back to all time high tomorrow, then $low 60s"
Insanity fools buying anything here. This whole system is going to free fall. Wake up America period. Its all Wall Street greed period. Its time for massive tax on these greedy companies period here. These markets at least 30 % over priced. Citizens wake up here and now. Massive jobs out there period. Quit being idiots and ringing own groceries /items at all store period. Cant believe that Americans are so stupid to ring their own groceries period. There you have it . Wall Street loves it fools. Think millions of jobs lost to this stupidity only. There you have it. Talk about easy solution period. How could you be so stupid period. Look at massive unemployment . This would solve it here and now period. All this has done is to make Wall Street richer only. My line is how could you be so stupid . Honesty .
"Buy and hold until earnings 8/19. Historically, their Q2 has been the best every year."
"Very oversold and unjustly punished. The soil is so fertile for LOW right now that any dip should be bought. Diana argued that the price of lumber is scaring customers away...that is baloney. The demand may be stonewalling some who can't afford to build a new house or renovate, but that is very untrue for those who can, and eventually commodity prices will begin to fall. No trend in the market is ever permanent. The housing boom is still in its infancy. You can't look at LOW, HD, and SHW based on the present...you have to look to the future to truly see that even after the massive runs these have had over COVID that you are still getting a bargain."
Then Joe Don't Know stop calling everyone a DE. You just continue to prove you don't know a thing about Lowes. I still think you have never set foot in a Lowes store.
"LOW is only following the market just like HD. With a positive quarter, HD is also following market. LOW will 100+ in a short time."

"50 day SMA (88.27) 200 day SMA (84.81)Currently trading (at close today) - 81.48We broke the 200 day MA on the 19th and it never bounced back (slight up swing on the 23rd) but then the last two days were free falls. With the 50 moving closer to the 200, it looks like we could even see 70's again (and we are not far off now) If the 50 crosses below the 200, mid 70's are real likely. Anyone else agree or disagree?Hopefully it trends back above that 200 day average."
Great buy yesterday
Every Lowes I go by is so empty. How is this possible????

Why not say...your password is expiring in five days please change it now so you know? Want to see how many hours you worked last week? Kronos takes two minutes to load. That is so much wasted time across the company. Employees don't help either. I come in the morning to pallets scattered across the back room. Garbage sitting around, cardboard boxes everywhere including in garbage cans? Empty garbage cans in the back room from various departments. Pickers not charged, power stockers left uncharged. I ask management to have them plugged in so we can do our job.....oh absolutely...then the next day unplugged sitting down an aisle. There is zero accountability here and it is pathetic. ASM's need to do their job and make sure zone recovery is done, products are not lying on the floor, cardboard is bailed, garbage is taken thrown away, cans are returned, power equipment plugged in EVERY DAY!! Employees don't want to do IRP so they pull stock item tags when they sell out and the freight team goes on a scavenger hunt trying to put things away. If Lowe's were rewarded for inefficiency they would be the largest market capitalized company in the world."

CEO selection critical
"Could be a run up past christmas to 100. Then, it's a short to $20. Poor;y run company. Inventory problems. VERY disgruntled employees. They cannot compete with Amazon. Stocking and shipping are a disaster. They still use DOS. Their systems are so antiquated, they're comical"

The stock market makes no sense to me whatsoever right now -- P/E ratios, forward guidance and quarterly reports mean nothing compared to memes some guy from Reddit posts on message boards. I can't help but believe a massive bubble is about to burst for the entire market."

I hope they use this money to give all of those brave workers at their stores who worked right from the beginning of this terrible Pandemic a nice well deserved BONUS.

However we know it may go to the pockets of the CEO and company sitting in the comfort of their homes raising prices and giving layoffs,"

No final decision has been made and discussions could fall through, the people said."
LOW is down 7.83% to 68.01
This stock should be closer to 200 than 172 imho. Gaining market share on HD a lower valuation and much smaller market cap! The Ceo is doing a great job imo.
Get ready for a BIG DIP in stock price. I was shopping at my local Lowes the other day. On check out I presented my retired military ID. I was informed on Jan 5th they would no longer honor my military ID unless it was registered with MyLowes card or my telephone number. To me this is a kick in the face for MY SERVICE in the U S Marine Corps. I will be taking my business to Home Depot as I am sure many other retired military will do the same. This isn't a local store issue as I called the corporate number 1-800-445-6937 option 5 then option 2 and lodged my complaint. When this its the news it will be disastrous to the stock price. I also sent an email to their IR department and suggest others do the same.
ISLE 15
"Can I simply say that Lowes and Home Depot are really losing out because their customer base is getting tired of their stores. I remember a day not too long ago, when you walked into either big box hardware store and you would be bombarded by employees asking if they could help you find something and amazingly they knew what you were talking about, now it is hard to run down one of their associates and I do mean run down, because they will run away from you if you look like you need help. Sure it is easier to go to on-line resources, but in all honesty, my wife and I have been using the local Ace Hardware store and another independent more and more, also using City Electric for most of my electrical and tool needs. The service and the selection of American made options are just so much better. Until they address these issues I predict they continue to falter. Even Wal-Mart has doubled down on putting employees out on the floor to help customers. There is a reason that some brick and mortar stores are thriving and there is a reason some are faltering."
AOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGA AOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGA
CEO got to go no Leadership...HD has been eating his lunch for sometime...
I DOUBT I DBOUT THIS GETS BACK TO ITS HIGHES
what is up with the dive pre market?
"Looks like a good time to buy, stock should rebound tomorrow if not end of day"
Buy buy in the morning
LOW has been an incredible stock for the past year. Was in Lowe's this weekend and lines were incredibly long and service was still strong. My experience has always been positive while shopping at Lowe's and it seems like they are managing this busy time very well. Certainly a happy share holder here!
Hate home depot
OKAY TIME TO COVER TIME TO COVER ITS 10AM
Let's see a run to 114!!!
How does lowes stay in business with their fake Valspar paint that is probably nothing more than chalk and used motor oil
A lot of high expectations here. I hope LOW does not disappoint tomorrow.
HD now over 300 per share. Low imo only needs a few years to reach that level i base on earnings projections.
Ridiculous. Let's see what happens to NVIDIA after they report after the close.
TIMBER!
Wow just like Walmart yesterday
"Lowe's stock price target raised to $130 from $110 at Wells Fargo8:08 am ET May 12, 2020 (MarketWatch)"
"Ill be waiting to see what happens once the DM positions are converted from DM to SM. This is either a move to weed out the non-performing DMs and then the positions will be recreated in six months and call this a failed experiment and they acheived getting rid of dead weight like all big corporations do with their periodic layoffs but this time with out severance pay or will they be just blindly moving forward and seeing if this little experiment works by saving on salaries and hoping things continue to run. If its the latter, they are screwed because things will be coming to a screeching halt and the place will be as efficient as any poorly run Walmart and turnover will skyrocket as good employees flee and the dead-enders are left behind to service customers. Either way I think this is as good a time as any to sell my stock here since the near term turmoil will only lead to lower profits."
"ATTN: Lowes BOD. FIRE Niblock immediately. ""Nuff"" said."
"DOW near all time high not so, HD, LOW and many many more."
WE ARE LILLING THIS COMPANY AWSOME JOB TO ALL SHORTS
"Boy I hope this is close to the bottom, bought more today."
$low and $teady
"Consider: this summer's dividend raise will be ~20%, which is slightly below the 5 year avg. DGR. This will make the div ~.57 to .60 or $2.28 to $2.40 yearly, maybe even higher. That's in lock step with earnings increase, for a superbly regulated and low LOW ~33% payout ratio! When was the last time your job gave you a 20% pay raise, every year, with a long term cap-app bonus >20%?"
well at least we have the dividend to hold us over
"was in HD yesterday, horrible service for my daughter trying to buy a grill, she was ready to go to Lowes! but finally got it straight. I will stay with Lowes"
To the moon
"Earnings on Wednesday, going to be another killer performance!!!"
THEY WERE SO HAPPY THIS MORNING AT $7 UP U MORON
It's hilarious how much everyone thinks Amazon is pressuring Lowe's and HD. If they pressured half of what is talked about I would worry. Amazon isn't much to them.
THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER HAPPEN DAY MAN AWSOME DAY OMG OMG OMG LOVE IT
NOT GOIO GTO GO BACK TO ITS HIGH PROMISE U
Down big with HS after they beat and raised. Hmmmm
MORE ROOM TO GO DOWN I THINIK
Does anyone know the target price this is supposed to rise too? When will it hit friction?
Buy at $117 zone... not here... patience
"Great opportunity to sell. The tell was in their “lipstick on a Pig moment” highlighting just Jam comps of 5%. Clearly the Gov shutdown helped the home improvement stores. Imagine that. Well it won’t last. Remember, this guy last ran Jc Penny. Great track record!!!"
SO MANY SHORTS STILLL GOT TO COVER
"Market Edge upgraded LOW to a buy on Feb. 23rd. Today is the day to get in LOW and to add more.Feb 23, 2018 97.33 97.62 96.62 97.49 97.49 4,358,200"
LETS GIVE THEM SOME BONES IM BRINGINGIT UP WTH MY COVERING
LOW is down -8.79% to 87.37
THEY TRICKING U TO BUY
Low tomorrow what time earning ?
Reading all this posts it look like no one actually learns anything about the companies they invest in. Sad how little anyone knows.
"The housing shortage is a boon for LOW, HD, and SHW. The problem will be solved in the coming years. There will be a boom in homebuilding, especially for affordable housing. With that will come increased demand for these 3 companies’ products on the home improvement side. These 3 companies also so far appear to be well insulated from rising rates. I own all 3 and I think you ought to as well."
Once earnings are reported this will go up 10%
"Buying opportunity coming as existing home sales dropped. What this number doesn’t tell you is that the inventory of homes for sales is also low. The sales report will cause stock price to go down. IMHO this decrease is actually good for Lowe’s. Home prices are up so much people are afraid to sell because it is too expensive to replace what they have. So home equity loans at low rates and home improvements coming all summer long. My prediction is anything under 190 is huge bargain and over 225 is profit taking time. Ok team, tear me a new one and tell me how I am wrong."
LOL. HD is green in this market.
Great I buy in at $170 and immediately turns into a bad stepchild. You'd think this is a nasdaq stock down like this today
YES BABY WONT SEE 123 TODAY LOL
UNLESS SOMEONE WITH BIG AMOUNT OF CASH THIS WONT GO NO WHERE LOL
I went to Lowe's to pick up some vegetables for our garden. The store was packed.
back to $20.
WATCH OUT GUYS HERE I COME COVERING TO 118
Feels like a mistake
Just awful
Hurricane Matthew is coming.
TAKE PROFIT GUYS PROMISE U WE WILL LOSE OUR PROFIT
BUY BUY BUY GOING TO 200+ SOON.
Lowe's stock is going to continue to do nothing but go down in value. Customer service across the board is atrocious. The store manager at the Canton Michigan store just tried to fight me because I asked why his employees were lying about their titles about what they could do to fix their mistakes etc etc. any store that allows this kind of activity to happen from its store managers is most assuredly going to bomb. I would suggest putting all of your money in bitcoin.
"Instead of buying Low, I bought the supplier of lumber and building materials stock TAIGA BUILDING PRODUCTS TBL.TO at super cheap 4.x P/E valuation. It can triple as the construction activites are taking off. It has great track record and paid a special dividend of over 9 %.."
"Brian, bet you there are more hold or no buy as there are buy recommendations. Go back to when Nardelli left HD and compare Lowes and HD. At one time prices where within pocket change of each other. HD has now doubled Lowes. Why? HD board got a great CEO in there that drove the company with solid leadership. Quarter after quarter of meeting and exceeding expectations. Lowes quarter after quarter of missing expectations. Lowes price is dragging further and further behind HD each quarter. Like I said until they bring in a new and dynamic CEO Lowes will be behind."
I love my mute button. Goodbye Chad.
The current cost cutting is window dressing for the new CEO's first earnings report / call. Too many issues to list but suffice it to say this is a broken company. The exodus of knowledgeable employees and lack of inventory control / purchasing will be huge headwinds that the cutting of hours and the re- displaying of old obsolete inventory can and will not fix.
THAT WOULD LOOK BAD ON HIM
HE NOT GOING TO LEAVE THIS IN RED GOING ON CRAMER SHOW THINK SHORTS
"Both Low and HD have too much debt. I followed Buffett into low p/e-high debt companies and lost my shirt. Also, many of my friends are delaying projects on their houses because the costs are too high for materials and labor. Expect a pullback."
Adding more here at the 150 DMA. Will be back to all time highs by early spring.
BULLET PROOF say something
"Stock buybacks, earnings later this month, stimulus on the way, high-dividend, springtime surge on the horizon (which is historically the most profitable for HD & LOW)....just hold on"
buy this stock they said... u'll be rich they said...
LOW is down 8.22% to 91.00
"Lowe's has TERRIBLE customer service!!!Bought a dryer on July 4th. Salesman said it was available in distribution center and would arrive July 17th.Called today and it's ""on order"" at the distribution and MAY be available in mid August.Terrible logistics or salespeople trained to lie to customers?Not right to receive an appliance AFTER the credit card billed has arrived and been paid.If the machine is damaged, the nightmare will go on for several more months I'm sure.Don't get me started on the 30 minute wait in the store just to make the purchase, waiting on the lone salesperson to stop yapping with a couple who where clearly not buying anything and just talking about their dogs while my daughter and I stood there. Should have walked out the door at that moment and never returned."
"Lowe's did a marvelous job this quarter , last quarter lows blow it out of the ballpark  the analyst do what they do make stock go down or up by low sell high (Ps .coming  Lowe's buy back  by the dip and sell the rip  $200 are u guys bullish  "
Market correction? LOW could see 76.88 coming
Did the racist CEO said He does not want the business of white conservatives! What a moron and racist !
"HackErman is up only 0.1% this year? Really? Go ahead and follow him, I am only up 23% so far."
"The Hurricanes are good for a small quarterly bump and that it, its all about what are you going to do for me know......not what did you just do for me. This has 65-68 written all over it people."
going well below 60
target price $70
today may be a good day for a buy?
here we go
The 2nd best to HD. Why buy Lowe’s instead?
Every time I go to Home Depot there are several lines waiting to pay. I go to Lowe’s and there is maybe one line with one or two people. Home Depot continues to dominate Lowe’s. The disparity between the success of Home Depot versus Lowe’s has basically not changed since they hired the former JC Penney CEO. Did the Board of Directors really think that hiring the former CEO of a company that is going bankrupt was a good idea? Marvin Ellison was the best person they could find for the job?
"BE CAREFYK longs I HEAR MM SAY this GOING TO $LOW 20""S soon"
Why down 30 points from 52 week high if market hitting all time highs?
I PUSH IT IN GREEN WATCH
"$LOW Fig Partners, R5 Capital Upgrades Lowes(LOW-NYE) to Buy from Holdhttps://www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/fig-partners-upgrades-loweslow-nye-to-buy-from-hold/"
Anyone see a possible death cross approaching?
What's up folks I'm thinking on hopping on this train tomorrow looks like it could climb to 115 again
Yellen says inflation is not a concern yet and the fed is watching it. So an avg lumber pack has added 36K to the nations avg home being built. Fir 2x4x8 at lows went from 2.86 to 7.55. Yellen needs to get outa the office more!
Low will reach $ 160.00 today!!! GO LOW GO!!!
Sold my lowes and bought INTV... Might want to come look at why... Still running...
Slowly clawing its way back to the highs. Almost to the 170s. I predict once the market finds its footing again this stock will take out 200. If not over the next few months certainly before the end of the year.
Buy Buy Buy while is still cheap $200 here we come 
"If you understand numbers, look at the trailing p/e ratio and the forward p/e ratio. How, exactly, is Lowe's supposed to cut their p/e in half in one year?Lowe's must've hired that Iraqi Propoganda Minister. That is some serious BS that they are slinging."
New highs coming up housing up economy up construction booming earnings beat coming $$$
"Lowes is in much bigger trouble than most people realize, but even some customers are starting to ask if the company is going out of business. Start with the balance sheet. The debt has increased substantially over the last 5 years with the results being failed acquisitions and stock buy-backs, which look like a Ponzi scheme. That was Niblock's doing (the previous CEO). Now, here comes Ellison, a guy who fails everywhere he goes. Got caught up in intrigue at Home Depot before shown the door. Then made a mess at JC Penney's before leaving them without even informing their board. He offers no hope and the employees think he's a joke. But how stupid is the Board at Lowes for hiring this guy in the first place and how many people turned down this job. I find it hard to believe that Ellison was the first choice. Marvin is a silver tongued devil. His notes to employees always embrace the collective approach to success and end with a ""God Bless"" to the employees while his actions like cutting hours and staff only undermine the employees he claims to care about, not to mention the customers who cannot get help because it doesn't exist. Just this past Saturday (day after Black Friday) Lowes reverted to it's new staffing model, i.e. severely reduced staff. Black Friday was of course busy, but at least staffing was good. On Saturday it was even busier and with the purposely reduced man power, it was a nightmare. Anyway, Lowes management is horrible, is often adversarial with employees and worst of all, has no real idea what they are doing. Or maybe they do, if one plans on the next 'Big Short'."
Stop going down holly sheet
it's only going up from now on up up up & away
"Jan 2015 ,equity 7.6 bilionsJuly 2019, equity 2.4 billions2 more quarter , it will below 1 billion.With already 38 billions debt."
"I have a feeling that amzn may buy LOW ,rather than TGT that CNBC had been rumoring"
Well look at those numbers this morning. Go Lowes Go!
What time is the earnings report?
I own and doubled down today. Bet on meets or beats.
imagine sense toll Bros and HD beat earnings that lows will also beat. hope we hit 110.00.
"Still holding, cost average 37"
Sorry but Marvin had nothing to do with Lowe’s results
Went to my local Lowe's last night only self serve registers open other than in the lumber area.The only thing from one retailer to the next that makes or breaks a retailer is customer service!
COMES DOWN MORE WE MAKE MOE MONEY
we just need trump to say the trade war is over and this thing will fly
"Happy New Year all! '17 in the books, great year for LOW and me. Up >30% in <4.5 months since buy. Three weeks until we lock down another divy, then the yearly increase next quarter, as sure as the rising sun on Jan.1. Happy investing!"
Taken out to the woodshed!
"No rhythm or reason.All common sense is out the window. Nothing makes any sense anymore.Disgusting, just like the country is going."
Irma and Harvey will be providing upside profits to both Lowe's and HD for years to come. I like Lowe's better because they are valued at about half of what HD is valued at. Now that's True Value!
"Why does lowes show favoritismPsa's no weekends, 6-3. Signage people no weekends & 5-2. Receiving no weekends, 6-3 I believe. Everyone else treated like #$%$....at least rotate these positions...so everyone has a chance to spend time with familys. Give everyone a chance to enjoy set hours."
CEO buying a huge chunk on the open market? $100 by this week?
Have to say I thought it would jace recovered a lot more today. Under $150 again. Ughh
I SHORTED AT 123 ALMOST TIME TAKE SOME PROFIT ALMOST
Wow. This still looks cheap. Nice divy ratio payout
"well that was quick, up then down!"
"Home Depot simply has better merchants. They're nimble a making product adjustments, on the fly. The folks at Lowes,"
Does LOW trade in AH?
HE TRICKS U DMAN MARKET MAKER
unwarranted sell offs on this in last 30 days this will be 185 to 200 by may 1st 2021.Gonna be a lot of regretful investors who bailed.
"I was in Lowes today and asked if they were gonna close anytime soon. The lady at the counter told me that they were deemed ""essential"" so they will remain open along with grocery and drug stores. This tells me that's lowes and home depot will have revenue and earnings despite the pending shut down and may ever benefit because people wont have anything else to do but work on their houses .."
TOLD U GUYS TOLD U GUYS
did Loews get compensated for the closed stores?
I WOULD COVER IF I WAS U COVER COVER COVER
If you get a close under 97.50 LOW will test down at 90 support.
so they hired a person from the failed JC Penny. this is pretty awful
Just googled Lowes and Home Depot response to Covid. Explains why the differences in earnings. Looks like HD is way ahead of Lowes in how employees are being treated.
"This is what confuses me. Comparable sales up 30% with consensus estimate of 22.8%. Online sales (not sure what % of sales this is, but should be small) up 100%. Buying back $3billion in stock. That usually means they feel it is undervalued and the best use of money. Stock is down. PE is still 21.24. It is just confusing to me why stock is down $10 pre market after it has come down from $180 a few weeks ago to $160 and now to $149."
Missed wide right it’s allllll over Home Depot wins
Market cap 72B....Only going up!
Any idea what time tomorow morning earnings are announced ?
Looks like it peaked at 97.49. Ackman & gang are out of ammos
"I agree, salesman should be exempt from cleaning, Have them sell & only assist customers.Make Lowes $ & share holders $"
they are buying back 3% of the company each quarter and gaining market share.
"Sold my shares and took over $3,000 dollar losses today."
"Interesting. The PE is still only 22 even after the big run up. It is showing above the bollinger bands which usually means over bought. That is still a really low PE. Seems like it has room to run.BTW, I own a few options positions mostly sold short term and at the money."
New 5 billion share repurchase plan announced. Time to go higher.
It's headed to $70. I will add there!
"David , Lowes is going to be $100 soon, unless there is a split Wait for proceeds from RONA to start coming in"
TOLD U GUYS THIS WILL GO TO 118.25 BY TIME CLOSE
"LOW claims will make $6 next year -- not likely. LOW makes $4.80 or less is more likely. Business is at a top, and so is the stock price."
As a share holder and shopper at Lowes it is becoming harder and harder to shop at Lowes. The waythey conduct online orders. No customer service in the stores in Dallas TX. Is it time for a Managementshake up.
"I feel the same way you do, but unfortunately this morning I'm seeing several analysts on television that say this could be the beginning of a down slide down to the 130 to 140 range. Let's sure hope not."
"How does this company make any money, every time I buy something from them I have to return it because it is junk and doesn't work. We need a HD bad where I live."
DSC ........LOW's is buying back shares plus your mops and brooms from aisle 14.
Biggest loser of the DOW today?
Hillary is looking a bit tuckered out lately. Maybe she needs to go into an alcohol rehab program? Can you imagine what it would be like if Hillary was incapacitated and that Kane idiot had to take over as president? That would be gasser friends. 
Those numbers weren't bad at all. Looks like i nice price to buy in now.
"to be continued....I ask once more, what has Robert Niblock ever done to make ""our"" company better ???"
strong buy fnd now
Devalued it’s stock or it’s time to dropping??
be careful on premarket trading!!!!!mixed results. Up based on the more purchase volume in pre market trading. we will see where this goes once the market opens. not to mention the political climate and the well needed diversions that are needed by some people.
LOW is a failed business! Just walk into their stores you will see why they have missed the earning the last four quarters! stupid disrespectful staff and IDIOT managers. LOW will ALWAYS GO LOW!
"100% of the time the stock is lower after announcement of stake by big fund, they don't announce until after they have accumulated at lower prices and are ready to sell some, sell calls, buy puts. This will go up and down like a seasaw"
Nice comeback
I warned shorts a day like this was coming but they didn’t listen. Now they are paying the price. $200 will be here soon.
LOW is down 4.96% to 112.64
"What until Q3 with the results of the disastrous 3rd party delivery factor in. Expect Pro business sales to be flat if not down. Contractors can't wait 2, 3 or more days for a delivery. Already fleeing to Depot."
"Lol, this is way beyon funny. Who is buying at this level"
What does everybody think about Hollywood celebrities telling us who to vote for? 
they sold all retail. looking to get back in. lot of resistance for s+p 2600 so be carefull. Thats been the sell point . watch lows 50 day ma. it hit the 200 ma and it got sold.
"Lowe's Accused Of Scanning Millions Of Customers Facesccording to the Cook County Record, two recent class action lawsuits accuse Home Depot and Lowe's of secretly using facial recognition to identify customers as soon as they enter their stores.On Sept. 4, 2019, a group of plaintiffs simultaneously filed virtually identical class action complaints in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago against Lowe’s and in federal court in Atlanta against Home Depot, accusing the retailers of violating the Illinois state law by “surreptitiously” scanning customers’ faces as they moved about the chains’ stores.According to the Lowe's lawsuit, home improvement stores are secretly using facial recognition to identify everyone.“Lowe’s has augmented its in-store security cameras with software that tracks individuals’ movements throughout the store using a unique scan of face geometry. Put simply, Defendants surreptitiously attempt to collect the faceprint of every person who appears in front of one of their facial-recognition cameras.” (To find out more about Home Depot tracking customers, click here.)https://massprivatei.blogspot.com/2019/09/home-depot-and-lowes-accused-of.html"

"$200 a share officially reached! Time to pop the cork on the champagne longs!!!! Those shorts will only get more merciless beatings as time goes on. Now to close above 200!!! 43 minutes until market close, let's go!!!"
"Of all the retail, I like Lowes this earnings season. They're gaining share on HD and digital sales will likely increase due to COVID19. They've been one of the few open the whole time while people are spending more oer household on home improvement vs groceries & clothes."
"Good, broke the streak, now it’s time to start another one."
Just have a question for your experienced option folks. I’m new to options. I bought some $160 calls for this. Jan 15 exp. break even is $163.60. So does this mean I need it to be above that price before Jan 15th? Do I sell before then? This I felt was a good stock and so jumped in. Thanks for any help.
"After the masive amout of IPO shares have cleared, expect negative outlook to surface. Valuation"
"Came in with 10,000 shares a couple hours ago. Already down $2k, but I think this is a $160 stock"
"Surprised this hasn?t been shorted more for cooking the books. They do no checks on quality of their products in their stores and work with #$%$ bag ?contarctors? For installation services. When a product you order comes damages several times after it?s been re-ordered, I?d think something is wrong here. What company wants to lose money rebuilding the same product several times?"
Any whisper numbers yet????
TGT and Lowes will take over the world....
I think Lowe's will have a great earnings report like Home Depot. They both announced share buyback programs fairly recently too.
100K SHSARE COVER HERE IT GOES
hardly any posting on this board but lots of posting on HD. are people not so excited about lows?
"Taxes and infrastructure, sounds good. They have better products than he. undervalued"
With 10 time the ave daily volume authorized as a buy back- you can bet the company is standing strong buying every block that comes avail right here right now. Want to own a stock with little to no downside risk- here you go! Now if the raise the div or an activist pops their head up- LOW pops $20/ real quick like! Buy LOW
HEY SHORTS!https://www.benzinga.com/stock/low/ratings
HE DIDNT EVEN COME TO CNBC HE IS STUPID
Classic Head and Shoulder pattern. we are at the top of the right shoulder and ready to pull back. Should pull back to $90. not to mention all the same reasons HD missed.
what am i missing here
anals pump the tops relentlessly
If they had that many underperforming stores... what took so long. Same with Sam's Club closing 50-60 stores. We all know Home Depot will be here as was as Costco.
I STILL GOT ALOT TO COVER
DONT KNOW ABOUTU GUYS THIS IS GOOD PRICE TO COVER
"If lowes be like home trade PE 23.24x 5.49 earning would be at $127.58 Trading and here Lowes did so much better than HD with their Earning. So focus stay the Course and we should be at $125-127 By next few days. WE are trading way below what it should be trading it oversold. Like Cramer said its a BUY,"
Next stop around 200 pps.
"new 1 year estimate raised to 175, c'mon! goin up"
how come home Depot in the same sector is going up? it must be facing same challenges right?
IT WIL MAE IT JUMP DONT PANIC GUYS
What's up with this company the chart is black..?
Don’t sell yet!
Target price 100
LOW is down 5.01% to 98.81
"Thats brilliant hire a CEO who is failing at his current company to come fix your failing business, buy puts, lol"
"Corp rate change impact-LOW should see a significant impact in 2018 due to the reduction in corp rate they were paying relative to the new rate. Despite the one time incentives they are giving back to employees, I see this as a big win to their bottom line. I'm long LOW as I hope they improve on margins and beat topline and on the bottom as well."
Marvin will have Lowes stock running neck and neck with HD within two years . Moves are being made to make Lowes much more profitable. Mr. Allison knows the blue print and he's following it.
Joe is in the lead with Kayak falling behind.
"Dang SF, you need to stay of the crystals. You’re cooked"
LOW has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. google awesomeS-TOCKS - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
I funny until 12 Pm stock was stabalizing around $ 98-$99 and than that downgrade came in and baam
"I been studying Lowe’s for the last two weeks and it has a urge to keep boosting up. I like to post personal opinions instead of article reads like these veterans. Personally, I see it hitting 175 by the end of this year. "
YES BABY SHORTED THIS BABY
Was there a silent bidding war for HD supply between Lowes and Home Depot? Home depot buys HD Supply for 9.1B.
Go Joe Go!!!!!
CANT BELIEVE HE LET HIS STOCK FALL $8
"bought at $103 right after pandemic and sold with a profit but way too early....bought back at $150 and doing well......only regret is not buying more.....this is a no brainer stock.,....should easily hit $200.00+ this year..."
$8 DROP FROM EARLIER HIGH BEST TIME TO COVER HELL YEAH
Booming...new 52W high next week
let's get this thing back in the 80':s and get in the race with Home Depot.
What your your predictions for this stock a month from now?
Will fall big this week! Worse than Home Depot! Earning miss and extremely high pe!
SHORTS ARE COVERING TOO SO THIS WILL GO IN GREEN
"Forget the politics of why and face the reality of what is— The price of gas has skyrocketed in the past few weeks, I went to $LOW to buy wood and opted to go in a different route due to the unimaginable jump in 2x4 prices, the housing market is sky high, and between Earned Income & stimulus American households will see about $15,000 free cash in their bank accounts pretty soon... when do we start talking about real inflation and recognize the affects this is going to have."
LOW is up 4.91% to 98.85
Profit taking today
Bought 200 shares at $151. I hope I’m right.Buying more 200 more at $145.Selling around $170.
It is a very good business opportunity for LOW to play the game after this horrible hurricane
IT IS SO FUNNY CANT GET ABOVE 119
How many shareholders voted on annual Proxy Statement to be reelected Board of Directors ?? Does Niblock need actual Lowes long time employees to vote for him? Since corporate and some Ful time employee cuts ???
Wow what a spike upwards!
"Poorly managed, and wouldn't touch this one."
DONT PANIC IM MAKING I JUMP BECAUSE IM DOING SHARE COVERING
"As an employee, I would short the 4th quarter numbers. (after they ciome out) By every measure, we had a blow oiut 4th quarter Given that we were (and are chronically) understaffed, And therein lies Lowes problem. (And they know it) They cannot survive a real estate recession and real estate recessions are predictable. Lowes problem is that they can';t afford employees. In my 9 months there, NONE of the peopel who left were people management wanted to lsoe. (Including me) What they're left with is people with poor health who stay on for the health insurance and 75 year olds. Lowes doesn'gt hire people, they hire bodies. Because they are chronically understaffed they can't train anybody. Going into Christmas, we had to hire 11 people. We ended up with 8, only one of which was worth a #$%$. The rest are just zombies who walk around in a daze. We beat on sales, margins, you name it. But this is as good as it's going to get. As residential rental cools, we won't be shipping 50 refridgetators a day. Contractors won't be walking in and saying ""I need that $1,000 saw now!"" In that environment, when they have to go against Amazon, they'll get roasted. Short Febuary."
Someone is sitting with 3000 shares to unload at 112. Looks like that is the # they want to run this to before shorting is back down.
"If they dont blow out the numbers we'll be in the $60s very quickly,,,"
Go look at ROKU and see that Citron covered and Lowes might be CITRON next target
If they haven’t pushed a short out then than won’t! Careful!! If it hits today’s low sell fast re buy at lower levels
Hurricane Maria is next....
I was looking at this when it dropped 50% last year in March and was one of the best time to get in! Tripled since then. Now I sold puts on this one and if I get shares will run it for the long run!
"Every time I've been into Lowe's in the last month - it's crowded. Construction has not stopped either -- so the pro side is still going. If the housing industry crashed, the pro side would slow down."
"TODAY MAY BE THE LAST DAY TO BUY THE JANUARY 2020 CALLS ON DISCOUNT, AHEAD OF NEXT WEEK’S EARNINGS "
LOW continues to show me the money! $$$
"Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and happy and safe wishes to all, including you Joe!"
Buying opp? Disappointing miss as operating margins an issue #$%$ good. Their 2018 guidance is conservative as hopefully the activist influence will turn things around. Hoping the cc is going well but the premarket bloodbath is in effect-ugh!
"Going to break through support, $100-$120 in a month"
Sold all my shares. JCP is almos disappearing. So LOW not good future
too much price disparity between HD and Lowes.
"FYI: $104.23(yesterdays closing price), is precisely at LOW 5 yr. blended average P/E ratio of 21.1."
"The key number to watch in the earnings is comparable-store sales, and all signs point to a positive uptick for this key metric. Home Depot saw its growth rate double between the first and second quarter as customers made their spring purchases a bit later than usual. Lowe's executives suggested in late May that a similar trend may be applicable to the company, so analysts are expecting a big boost here. $LOW https://www.finstead.com/bite/Lowes-Companies-LOW-stock-forecast-prediction-august-21-2018"
"Very interesting, look at the link. Like HD, LOW's had a flat qtr.-not bad but then you put an inflation factor into the qtr. and you end up a little short. Wall street is certainly burning any negative thinkers, but the reality is the economy is still shrinking, contracting, negative growthing as they say today. Companies are not keeping or even holding up the inflation factor. This will all end bad I believer. Read the numbers for yourself.https://lowes.gcs-web.com/node/22206/pdf"
"SMART DIP BUYERS ACCUMULATING THE JANUARY/APRIL 2020 CALLS CHEAPER AS LOW PULLS BACK, BUY LOWER TO SELL MUCH HIGHER LATER. "
Look how many negative reviews. #$%$ service. I've been treated like a sucker at this store too.https://www.yelp.com/biz/lowes-home-improvement-cotati?
What happened today?
The train has left the station choo choo next stop 175....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
raise store prices to increase divided we will see how that workes out for them
I should have dumped this dumpster fire yesterday when back in green
"Lowe's in Destin FL manager Tiffany Reed she told me when I was bringing back Roses I got on Clarence. Lowe's policy is NO REFUNDS on Clarence items I asked can you show me where that is in Lowe's policy? I waited about a hour and then since it's NOT a LOWE'S policy. She tells me they can't refund because they can't match which Rose bush came out of which bucket. WELL I am the one who knows I have 100 other ROSES I bought here PLUS many many other things Lawnmower, Pressure washer many things. I have also returned ROSES before NO PROBLEM. I think its because I waited and didn't take them in one at a time I had 37 of them. I had the tickets for about 75 rose bushes I have bought. One she LIED to me LOWE'S policy don't take back Clarence items WHAT you should NOT be working for LOWE'S maybe that is the problem with LOWE'S stock people stop shopping there because of #$%$ like that. I mean all the money I spend there and all this over less then 200 bucks. I think if she lies she also steals they go hand in hand. I sure hope headquarters makes things RIGHT because LOWE'S is closer to me then Home Depot and I have a Lowe's credit card. I just can't get over her lying to me and then coming up with some other #$%$==== She needs a new JOB."
"for me the most company against inflation is HD and Low....they would easily raise sales price to pass the cost to consumers with no problem as consumers have to buy necessity to maintain their home. If the pipe or toilet is leaking, those would have to get repaired or replaced regardless what the price would be"
How would a person go about finding out how many shares are shorted in LOW? Percentage to total shares.
Retarded drop today.
Is Lowe’s dependent on COvid?
"Back to the triple d's again we go...they must've let go some unproductive DE's, lol..."
Do people think $LOW is undervalued when we account for its 31.9% growth?
Lowes IT people have degrees but look what they created. DSC and I could have done a better job. Did they let their interns take over? This is outrageous !
"I'm concerned my dividend yield has been falling recently. When I last bought, the yield was >3%! (Same when I bought more HD)....%^O"
doubt it....Lowes wont be in business in two years
"Thought the call was interesting. CEO on honeymoon phase. He was very honest about Lowe's lack of execution - was hoping one of the bankers would ask about other brand initiatives outside of paint and tools? Lowe's is offering some new brands that have been embarassing disasters, like Nest, Iris, and Therma Tru. How can LOW simply eliminate 1/2B in cap ex? Was LOW ""wasting"" 1/2B in cap ex? - or what is being sacrificed for picking up this type of found money???? 1/2B is a lot of money."
"For those of you who don't know (and that appears to be most investors), the Lowes financial quarter ends at the end of July. It's off by one month vs. the calendar."
"Hummm. on May 15., my account is showing LOWS distribution ; some Funds sold $55.964.199 ... or 678.930 shares. Looks like somebody knows something"
Read all about it!! Read all about it!! coming  Lowe's buy back !! $149 is a very tempting price but not to bust anybody's bubbles$ 130ish is amazing 
Why is this sinking?
Wow down over $2 this morning. Looks like $75 is next stop
Anyone have any idea why low is down 1.7 percent on day when market is up well over a percent? makes no sense
Cover Now - 85 in next few hours?
"Simple truths. Houston most damage is from flooding. Flooding is not covered by homeowner's insurance. Most in Houston did not have flood insurance. Most will not have funds to rebuild. Florida homeowner insurance has a 20% deductible for wind storm damage. Most in Florida don't have that 20% of homes value to rebuild, repair or replace. You would not believe how many I heard before the storm say my house is paid for, I don't have insurance, I don't have funds for major repairs. Simple facts there isn't billions and billions going to be spent in the next year. It will be 10 years or more for Houston to recover. Years and years for south Florida, the Keys and Marco Island to recover. That is HD and Lowes are down. Don't forget also they may have lost stores in the Keys. Both have stores there in the worst hit areas. $30 million plus per lost store if total loss."
Big block seller came in on this. Someone dumping.
"Great quarter+Hurricanes & the housing boom equals up, up, up.GLTA"
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 142.21

PEG ratio below 1......home sales and renovation will be strong in 2021! Lowe’s will announce accelerated share buy backs.
SELL SELL SELL THIS LOSER!!!
"Iv been working at 1 of the top performing and scoring stores in the northeast for 2 years. Since Niblocks restructure of the stores we've been nothing but understaffed, mismanaged and employee moral is low do to the uptight and stressful work environment. The delivery department has been contracted out to XPO who routinely decline to make deliveries because they're too far or they just don't feel like doing work. Receiving area is a disaster and is impossible to find orders. 1 employee has to cover 2-3 departments from 6- closing. Lumber area has 1 person covering but needs 2 to operate the equipment. They hire unmotivated kids as seasonals. managers are constantly stressed out as they have a million things to do and no time or supporter to execute actions. Lowes also though it would be a brilliant idea to put spring time items in the middle of nor'easter season so instead of ice salt and shovels we have grass seed and mowers. Lowes is an excellent company and used to treat their people fairly well but the company is a shell of it's former self."
Had a buy order in at 148.85. Got jumpy and bought half at 149.56 and waiting for the other half if it hits my buy point.

Waiting for $160 before earnings call.
Market up 450 LOW down. When market turns down how low does LOW go?
"IMO if Lowe's gets over 80, it's off to the races with a ex divided date less than a month away.Good luck "
"this always fades at the end of every day, without fail"
i own lowes stocks and will always add when the price is right but with all the store closures i believe revenue will fall short. i will be on the sideline for now. good luck to all buying in and holding
"Did a little research on Lowes supply to try to determine how exposed they are to the China-US trade war. Lowes has 106 suppliers. Most are located United States and the rest come from South Korea, Canada, China, and Taiwan. The #$%$ supplies from China, is mostly garden hose and plastic stuff..they are a poor supplier of anything quality like tools. I would say that Lowes is in a great position to weather the trade war with China...the biggest question is how all of this Trade war drama this will affect consumer confidence and the economy as a whole...but as for Lowes..they are in the best position to soar if the dust settles from the Trade War."
LOW reached a 52 Week low at 63.59
"Honestly, I know I should sell for a small profit but I will hold and kick myself tomorrow morning because it will drop to 73 after good earnings. Then slowly climb to 80 before the next ER."

"funny the big posters this morning are all happy and claim to have shorted 5000 to 20,000 shares this morning, but none rode it from 90 to 120... explain again who made money off this stock please."
"I feel that there is a good chance of a miss this quarter, especially after Home Depot’s revenue miss......"
IT WAS ON FREE FALL
"Just bought LOW on the recent HD dip. Looking forward to years and many increasing divs of ownership. By the looks of this board, there's a lot of disgruntled ex-employees and union/OWSer's here. I guess I'll do some mute weeding..."
WE BROUGHT THIS DOWN $8 ALMOST DOWN
I GOT BURNT LAST TIME DDNT TAKE PROFIT NOT TIS TIME BUDDY
"today you should be looking at ""CYDY"""
IM NO DUMB GET FALL FOR LOWES TRICK
CEO IS BUYING BACK TOO I SEE
We will NEVER do business with Lowe's again. Purchased some flooring with installation. Biggest cluster I have ever experienced. After sharing our horrible experience with others everyone share their horror story with Lowe's. I honestly don't know how they stay in business. We all shop at Home Depot now.
THATS WHY I SHORT HE IS STUPID
HD much better in this space!
up with little volume. not sure how the stock market works. seems everything is getting inflated
Low- already over bought for months
Watch for changes in Low upper management. Shaw is going to make changes...
Just bought in big time your welcome for the pump
Wish the stocks would split so the young people could buy in like we did and watch them grow fir their retirement
PEOPLE WHO SOLD TOAY WERE STUPID THEY GOING TO REGRET IT
so why is HD's market cap approx 2x of Lowe's? HD has that many more stores and inventory?
"What's risky? My LOW shares are up >sixty (%)! In a bit over a year, that's not too shabby, it's clear. Plus four dividends, another on the way, with yearly increases it makes my day!"
Fibonacci technical analysis has this going to 60 with a brief rebound to 67 and then down she goes
LOW is down 4.91% to 107.73
15% of lowes stores are in fl & tx.
"Back to 105 this summer, 120 EOY."
TO COVER FOR EVERYTHING THEY GOT
Hurricane repairs beginning. Should give quite the boost to Lowe’s. GLTA!
Wells upgrades Low PPS target 220.
"Here we go again. Nate is coming to middle Gulf Coast. Batteries, generators, and plywood flying off shelves."
You suckers that held are gonna be sorry.
JCP doing better without Marvin
"This may be the last time for a while to buy some of this stock while it's down a little. I think people are bargain hunting today looking to buy some stocks like this that are down a couple percent from where they were last week. And I bet people are about to start pulling out of the overpriced tech stocks, and putting their money someplace safer like here in Lowe's stock. I could see this recovering the rest of this week to close out the week up to around $165. GLTA!"
lows going to 84.00
What a quarter...adding to my position.
nothing to see here please look away nothing but a short squeeze...LOW still getting its lunch money taking from HD
"what happened, flat?"
"I missed buying LOW by 50 cents in 1H09, set a GTC at $19.50, but it only hit $20 a few days later and never looked back. I might now have a chance to get the shares I missed for a similar price."
"This store in London, Kentucky is a joke. The people that work for them are incompetent. They seem to be Walmart culls or something. They cannot perform the simplest tasks such as tinting paint the right color, contacting a manufacturer on a discontinued item on a half finished project because apparently it's not their problem. If you are doing any heavy loading such as concrete bags or heavy timbers onto a cart, the help will walk right by, look the other way and pretend they don't see you. God forbid you try to pull into the loading area to actually load because that area is usually chock full of vehicles parked from people inside the store shopping. That store is a joke. Not all stores are that bad but the one in London Kentucky needs shutdown. They have a really bad attitude and culture."
Buy RAD. You won't regret it.
"Talking heads are beating up on Lowes and HD, causing stock to fall. People should know the talking heads are nothing but hot air."
SCARED SINCE THIS WAS UP $8-9 ONLY REASON I M SCARED
what happened yesterday down 2 bucks??? money shift out of the sector???
"Lowes is a short to zero stock. Our store has 6 sales professionals. SIX!!! For the whole store! We have three on the unload team and 3 stocking shelves. In two weeks, two unloaders and 2 stovckers leave. Marvin's em[ployment policies are so moronic, you have to wonder iof he's sane."
JUST STAY HERE LISTEN DONT BUY WAIT TILL COMES DOWN
wow.... $3.5B in total buyback for 2016!!
"Every time I visit Lowe’s I feel bad to see the stores empty, it’s funny that there are more employees than customers some days, most of them are flirtatious 20-somethings, haha. I wonder if Lowe’s making their money from their online store, but that’s hard to believe where HD’s site is 63rd but Lowe’s site is way behind 124th in ranks. Does Lowe’s makes money elsewhere? I think stock price is overpriced, I would short or wait till somewhere $65-$70 range if they keep up."
Back to $65 soon. Missed on both the top and bottom numbers. Wow!!
"No reason to stay Green, Sell Short"
aaaaaaand there it is. The protypical EOD cliff dive. LOW is weird stock. This happens virtually every. single. day.
"Omg, this just got its @#s knocked off!!!"
NOT TAKEING CHANCE GET SHORT SQUEEZED
$2000 stimi baby let's go. gonna buy new oven.
"Im happy with taking a position in Lowe's a few weeks ago, as we move outta tech into re-opening plays i came to the conclusion to start buying some companies that work no matter what and lowes, target, apple were at the top of my list"
tooooo much good talk about LOWs it will bomb on earnings to many long option trades
UPGRADE NEXT ON THIS STOCK AND IT WILL MOVE EVEN HIGHER
Just added Lowe’s to my kids portfolio today. Bought 10 shares a piece.
Added more today.. Thanks for the pull back...$$$$
"Today's market action is a conundrum, I admit. Just look at the one month and year to date charts and sleep well!"
GOING BACK TO 118 119
"I had 700 shares I bought earlier, and just bought 640 more. Should be a good winter this year and one hell of a year in 2021 for Lowes."
"None of you investors seem to understand what is coming.There are 30 million people unemployed and that's just the tip of the iceberg. While Lowes is riding high today, that run is almost over. Maybe a month remains.The stock price is too high to sustain in the midst of a depression. Use your money wisely."
Won’t go lower than 163.50
I stopped shopping there. I'm tired of checking myself out and searching for representatives. Home Depot is staffed much better. Done with Lowes.
Go Joe go!!!!!!
They Missed the Numbers and they have an idiot coming from JC Penny Ha Ha Ha
CEO is a loser!!!
This is probably why:Sears shares jump 19% at open on Amazon deal to sell Alexa-enabled appliances
LOW reached a 52 Week low at 90.00
"They better blow out earnings. Too many companies have sold off after beating, mostly those that have had a big run post March bottom. And since LOW fits that profile, it could get whacked even if it does well. We’ll see."
Tell me one thing Niblock has done to makes Lowe's a better company.
"Any of you Coronas buy LOW low? I couldn't resist buying in the mid-90's, that was my last buy point. I don't think the virus sticks to 2x4's, and the home interest rates are heading down...."
Why is this stock down again today? I see HD up $1.50. I realize the move to $180 got the stock overextended but now we are down $13 from the high last week with a hurricane coming towards New Orleans?
why take # 2. GO HD
HE COULD KEEP HSIS COMPANY SHARES UP THERE
"People's confidence in DIY projects is growing. People shop at Lowes and not mom and pop hardware stores because they can put their hands on items before buying them. Lowes did the right thing by keeping their doors open and providing a familiar shopping experience unlike Home Depot. Spring and Summer is upon us, the busiest season for hardware and garden stores. I think there was sell off right after earnings to take profits, and now we'll see Lowes continue to rise. Shoppers will continue to shop, and profit margins will continue to rise. This is Corona friendly business."
I don't see where they said buying back 1 billion in shares . can yall confirm ?
"LOW and HD down because Sears offering Kenmore products on Amazon,"
"Sorry DE Grinches, Santa rally is coming to a Lowe's near you..."

"@$170, LOW is just at the Graham formula 5yr. blended P/E avg. of 19.4. Below it's own historical 5yr. avg. P/E21. At the best analysts est. of 8% gain in FY21, to $2.51... EOY2021 Graham avg. price is $182.. LOW actual avg. P/E price is $197."
Lowe's Companies reached a 52 Week low at 90.00
"I bought this stock during that huge correction. I cannot understand why I didn't buy substantially more.Glad I, at least, have a position. At the time it was the 'buy' of the year for me."
Buying more
Little frustrated. Not much moving.
"Retail sales will slow for LOW and HD, but that’s not a reason to say they are going to give back most of their gains since March. These stocks did well prior to COVID and will do well after. If there is a significant pullback, it’s a dip to buy. Shorts think these stocks are going the way of the dodo. They are in for a rude awakening. Don’t let their songs of doom cause you to miss out on the dips. Think long term, not short term."
"Go into any Lowe’s, absolutely on fire. Stimulus checks are rolling in as well, no end in sight to how well Lowe’s performs this year!"
Fading into close?
how is this junk still down with the market up
Another month ends with Lowe's in the seventies. Probably end there again next month after they miss per shares earnings for Q3.
$low and $teady...patience will pay
Up three cents....DSC sold three mops !!
It's Hammertime!
"Cost basis in Lowe's is $69.87. Bought on the bottom of the pandemic in March. Just one of many stocks I bought on that massive dip. If you didn't take advantage in March shame on you. Never let fear guide your decisions on making investments. Always be willing to pounce on any dip unless it's a true catastrophe, which COVID 19 is not."
Too easy...they will beat...they have no trade with China. Next question.
HTEY WILL SURPRISE U WATCH AND SEE
"the MGT of Lowes are idiots, you can no longer buy rope at lowes. because it can be used to make a noose. I need rope for my job, for home. I guess Home depot, ACE and TrueValue will get all my business."
end of day fade in T-minus 2h-55min
If we close above $ 98 tomorrow party is over for shorts. Chart say $ 98 is strong support.
We may have here an upside runner to watch. Target: 110.51.
Any ideas of where to set my sell price for tomorrow?
SHOOTING DOWN IN FEW MIN WATCH AND SEE
Who is DE SHAW?Is he so powerful? May be we should just follow his portfolio
"CFO is great on reeking havoc on people lives - keep laying off people and closing stores - how about trying to grow revenue?while the CFO gives himself 14 million in salary. Now he is cutting veteran discounts on sale items. They should not be allowed to have a veterans day sale if they can""t give veterans a discount.WHAT A GREAT AMERICAN"
Today's price: Southern New England. $8.08 for a 2 x 4.
Another Day.......Another Day of Lowes Selling..........MORE........TIMMMMMMMM BAHHHHHHHH !LOL
Dont know how they will make money on lumber that nobody buys. The solution to high lumber prices will eventually be...high lumber prices. For the couple of quarters in between I'm not too bullish here.

"What's the chance the lumber shortage will reduce total sales? I imagine higher prices will scare off buyers who don't need lumber now, with profits taking a small hit. Thoughts?"
I agree Lowes Directors need to take a good look at the management proble need change. At the Top level

"9% down in 1 day with no news. Super surprised. When it dropped 9 points, I bought more and options. Then hello down 15."
"Long and strong. I've made a lot of money with this stock. More than HD. I bought this at the bottom of the pandemic and have a 90 percent gain. Business is strong, etc. This stock will do well in good and bad times."
"short puts, make your cash take profit and go long around march. It's not rocket science."
Great buying opportunity here now to get some Lowe’s at a little bit of a discount! I just took advantage of the dip and bought some. Good luck all!
Anybody been to Home Depot or Low's lately? Packed!!!! This summer will will be great for these companies.
"When, I ask when....Is Lowe's BOD going to realize Niblock is a loser? He's tried for 10 years to make Lowe's ""his"" company. Well...It's not working!!! Lowe's stock has grown, not due to Niblock's infinite wisdom, but more tied to stock market growth. I"
LOW approaching my buy zone again. start @ 95 and mo' LOW if it goes below. If I was a new investor I would ease in now...

"Read Loop Capital put a $130 target on LOW recently I thought I had read, and looking at tip ranks price targets range from $109 up to $140. within the last 3 months with average for $122, good time to think about some stocking stuffers. Citi says stock has room to run and serves holders a dividend. We will see I suppose after earnings if anything is worth what these analysts are thinking by how bad the reaction is I suppose.https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/low/price-target"
Tailwinds (Strong Housing Market & Teleworking) will continue into 2021 and beyond. Keep adding on any pullbacks!
This will such a positive change for the company. I hope it's not to late to save what used to be a great company.
"May 1, 2017 HD opened at 156.22April 30th, 2018 HD closed at 184.80 or 28.58/share higher than one year ago.May 1, 2017 LOW opened at 84.84April 30th, 2018 LOW closed at 82.43 or 2.41/share LOWER than one year ago.There are other places where your money is better invested where it will actually grow. At least for now. Unless you just want to sit and watch your money going sideways with $3 to $4 dips up and down indefinitely, waiting to catch the next train to $108 (and it will pop at some point when the new CEO is announced)There is currently support at around $81.37 - $82.35 range, with resistance at around $84.30-$85.00If we have another day tomorrow like we did today it will break below current support and I believe you will see mid-upper $70's soon as the new support levels."

Most home owners upgrade their homes as their major investment so there will be a consistent flow of cash to the home improvement store( Lowe's )
Lowes should have a 1% restocking fee on items returned with no receipt or proof of purchase.
HOW CANU GO IN RED FROM $7-8 A SHARE DUMMIES
"LOWs may have service problem, I just ordered a dryer on line, and was waiting the whole day to get it delivered on the specified date, but it was delayed until I called them after waiting for long time. This is just a beginning a nightmare, later I talked to the store manger finally after waiting long time, she said they do not have the device in store, the local center did not pass the device to them. And promise will call me back to get this resolved. But later I checked the internet, it was canceled. Next day is Easter, they are off, and morning I called the customer service again, I was told it is out of stock, but I try to order it again on line, it is still available, then I said I need to talk to his manager. He is very reluctant, after wait for long time again, a manager came and I ordered it again, but will be delivered 8 days later again. For a person waiting for dryer for all the wet clothes, I can accept this kind of service and deliver time. I am not sure whether I can get it this time either, this is totally different with my previous experience with them, my old dryer was bought form them too."
Last earnings HD tanked and Lowe’s shot up. I’m taking my chance on Lowe’s
Brain dead morons selling on a huge upgrade from MS going from $190 to $210. That's some 40% higher than current prices. I am adding more here.Morgan Stanley maintains Lowe's Companies with a Overweight and raises the price target from $190 to $210.
what the h---!
"LOW is just now at, or just slightly above it's long term average P/E between 20-21. 5 year blended P/E, which is trailing 3 year and forward 2 year projection is 20.35. The analysts average earnings of $6.71 for FY2020 at normal P/E would put the price ~ $136 at end of next FY."
"Ok, very little is short here, so this is not a short squeeeze...Hackman is buying puts, selling calls, and as soon as he stops buying, then stock will slowly sink."

Back to 60's where it should be
retail and real estate crumbles
"Marvin just cut out the jobs of facilities associate, internet fulfillment and assembler jobs from all stores. Quality, cleanliness and timely customer service in all stores will go down. Investors will be happy to hear of the job cuts."
U MORONS THAT BOUGHT AT OPEN I SHORTED IM WINNING NOW U LOSING
Lowes. Full of inventory. Too bad there’s more workers than customers.
Time to short 86.50
Head and shoulders.......
Buy GREAT OPPORTUNITY
"the only way Lowe's can take customers from HD is to lower their prices. Last week I went to a Lowe's and a Home Depot to look for plants. Lowe's was a ghost-town, while HD was very busy."
SUMMER IS HERE THIS STOCK WILL GO UP TO 130 WATCH WATCH AND SEE ANYONE SELL OR SHORT I DID SHORT BUT I COVERED I M BUYING MORE SHARES TOMORROW
oh god when will it go down? I'm short short short!!!
I have never worked for Lowes or any of the companies that I own stock in. I will continue to buy LOW on dips for my Roth.
"Bought a little more today. After doing a full analysis on the stocks I watch, LOW has the best numbers and future IMO so went in a little more. Bought a little more stock. Then sold 2 put options with a strike of 170 expiring this Friday. Sold them for $268 each and LOW was at 167.75 or so at the time. So put them in the money $225 and got another $40 in premium each. So 'if' it runs over 170 will make The full $268 each in 2 days. If it is close to 170, might close just before closing time when premium is mostly gone or will roll them out to next week."
HD always has tge better margin than Lowes...this will always be the difference
NOW LOWES MAY COME AND DO SOME BUY BACK MAYBE
"day after day, $LOW has a lower low."
"Im long on the housing industry in the United States. Bidens infrastructure plan calls for 640 billion over ten years. Also, we have a growing population as well as a good portion of millennials planning on purchasing homes in the next two years. Also, Home Depot and Lowes both sell lots of appliances which are low quality (not their fault) which will inevitably make people come back for more to replace them. All these factors combined with a strong balance sheet and solid dividend history makes Lowes my top holding."
"I love how Lowe's thinks this will make them more efficient. How? Taking seven people out of the store who worked their way up to management? Making the remaining six take on more ASM duties? We have five ASM's. One actually contributes the other four walk around all day. Now they have less to do? How can someone who doesn't do anything actually have less to do? You want to be more efficient? How about quit bringing in trucks loaded with 50% top stock and get a logistic program in place that delivers needed items on time? We are loading up right now outside lawn and garden and there is two months of winter left. We get four trucks a week. All I do is write item numbers on boxes and top stock them. We touch everything at least twice. Our previous DM would tell us to bring down top stock to a lower top stock shelf, touching it again. Next day more lawn mowers came in and went to the top shelf. Why touch it three times? We have to go up to get it anyway what difference does it make what shelf it is on? They sent us 110 cases of one SKU of calk four months ago. 25 cases have sold the rest sits on a pallet in top stock. LOW should contact IBM and inquire about getting Watson involved in our ordering for more in time items. Special order 25 water heaters for an apartment and our system starts ordering them automatically as it thinks we need them do to a one time order Most inefficient company I ever worked for in my life. LOW keeps 3M in business buying all their tape. Our appliance loft is constantly stuffed. We are tripping over all this inventory and moving it just to get to things we need. That is inefficient. All they care about is stripping away anything they can from their employees. Vacation not used...lose it. Had full time and health care? Try part time and no benefits. They are going to be in trouble real soon as there is not much left to take from the people who actually produce. Now they are just firing and replacing them with millennials who don't know anything except for how to text all day while on the sales floor. Robert Niblock should be the next person to go. The board needs to take a serious look for a new CEO. He obviously has no clue how to run an organization. Dysfunctionality at it's finest."
LOOK WHO IS CEO FOR LOWES
Well someone finally woke up and realized Lowe's prices are the highest in the industry
"It always amazes me that companies buy their stock back after dramatic rises in their share price. While it seems a good thing to buy back 6% of the outstanding shares, it would also be nice to reward stockholders with a special dividend or regular dividend increase. Deciding what to do with cash is always contentious, but that is how activists make their money. Some companies are great at making money, but not as great at using the profits. I am all for reinvesting in the growth of the company and paying shareholders. The buybacks at this level seem to me to be wasteful of company assets. They could have bought back 30% of the company four years ago for 5B. I would like to see a higher div and a split. Lots of people say splits are old hat and of no value...but tell me that when the market hits the skids and the stock goes back to $30. It has happened before."
DEPENDS ON U GUYS IF U KEEP SELLING WHILE WE COVER
When buy back start?
"That just means more ""do-it-yourself"" home repairs. Which is right up Lowe's Alley. FEMA funds will be flowing into Lowe's cash register as well. Lowe's will be above $100 per share in the next 6 months. Damage estimates are well above Katrina already."
HERE IT GOES GUYS READY TO COVER NEXT ROUND
"PE of 25 is just too high. PE of 20 is still high, but means the price has to go down by 15 pointe to the low 50's."
U DONT GET DAY LIKE THIS
Lowe's Smashes Q1 Earnings Forecast as Digital Sales Surge. I like The word of “digital sale surge”.
Here come the $60s as predicted...
This stock is full of weak hands
Stock should be close to $180 and its down today.
WOW ! I've Never in My Life Seen a Stock Price So Much MATCH it's SYMBOL !LOW HAHAHAHA
Get the builders across the country to stop buying for one week? If that don't stop for two weeks see if that don't change prices.
Did someone put a fence up just above 165? This stock was about 180 almost exactly 1 month ago and since that time they reported excellent earnings.

"The Rona was a net positive for HD, SMG and GRWG. It will be no different for LOW. Q2 is gonna be all of their best ever."
Lowe's Companies is down 8.22% to 91.00
"If Lowe's doesn't crush the numbers like HD did this is going to get a huge haircut. Good news is already baked in, they need YUUUGE news or it will drop like a stone."
"How low do we go?? $60, $55?? I'm tempted to buy at these levels. But with all this companies that sell in Lowe's have been warning. WHR, GE, SHW, PPG just to name a few."

I'm so lucky that I visited this message board. I believe that I have found the greatest assembly of financial geniuses ever. Thank you all for sharing your vast wisdom.

PVHO looks ready to go. This company was just featured in a whitepaper by intel where intel was very bullish on the companies tech. They also have major partnerships with national brands. This may seem like spam but take 5 minutes of your day and check it out.
"Buy the dip, earnings have been good, beating expectations. Its been dipping slowly the last few weeks. Strong rebound is what I'm hoping for. Good luck to the rest of you."
"Can not stand going into this store. No service what so ever, check out sucks takes twice as long as h.d. and the prices are 10-20 percent higher. I will travel 10 extra miles not to go in to this store."
"any thought from HD performance, will it translate into lowes?"
Lowe's Companies is down 5.92% to 150.39
"Stock manipulation so Lowes can buyback, then it will rocket."
Thoughts regarding a stock split? Overdue?
"As an investor, I have no problem with the earnings growth story here as they are in a good sector to be in right now with housing etc. I believe when it comes to execution Home Depot is much stronger in their seamless strategy, particularly in executing BOPIS (buy online pick up in store). I was appalled at a recent purchase in Canada, and how it was handled from start to finish even after engaging the store manager. I shop multiple retailers and have embraced the digital experience while being able to shop in-store to purchase additional items. This is a great strategy to drive footsteps and leverage the product pick transaction to drive incremental sales. With this failure, I’m more apt to give my business to HD going forward.The customer always votes with with their wallets and perhaps that’s why HD is supporting a higher PE ratio than Lowe’s."
I COVER THIS PRICE HERE I COVER
"For a month, this message board was almost dead, with just me and a few others posting. Should pick up some more folks from HD. "
I don't get ... why would you sell a few days before the Ex-Devi. I understand the concern of overvalue but it seems crazy to sell that close.
Lowe's needs to take a real hard look at the Customer Care dept. They are starting to treat there customers like Time Warner did when they got into all kinds of financial problems. I hear a lot of people are switching to Home Depot due to service issues.
LL is a value stock
great earnings nowadays = sell-off- wonder if the big guys just trying to manipulate market to recoup losses from the GME saga
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 147.41

Rock and roll baby
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 143.76
"They should outsource the entire operation to Home Depot! They hired so many top managers from HD and itis not working, may be it is their toxic culture ingrained in the company that needs to be changed and it requires much more than a few people."
Just read an article that says all Orchard Supply stores will permanently close by the end of year. Lowes owns Orchard Supply.
Up half a percent on a bad market day. Nice! Good place to have your money! GLTA!
I believe Home Depot is it better by their stores are busy I walked into Lowe's other day on the three or four people are in the store at noon
"They wont meet the whisper #, they will have a good quarter but not great and this will drop to the $60s"

Distribution taking place on this stock. High Volume on a red tick.. and lower volume on a green tick. Closed my position last Friday.
I had to buy a cedar board to finish a project. The web site said they had over 50. In truth they had only 5 and they were all junk. Sad to see a company gooing downhill.

Great buying opportunity to grab some LOW right now! I just picked some up. Good luck all!
When does Low report earnings??
Lets have a nice run to ER!
What's Ackman down now. Another billion?.
OT Sam if you like the real estate field consider Z. As always do your own dd. Ever have a question on a stock and need another opinion post me on the low board which is not insane. Keep up the good work. You may also want to go to the stock compounding calculator. gov and find out what you have to save and at how many years to achieve your goal. Remember what Buffett said that it is better to buy a good company at a fair price than a fair company at a good price. best of luck.
"What a joke. Upgrade it goes up, downgrade it goes up. Prepare yourself to lose. I travel a lot and the parking lots of Lowes stores are always almost empty. Plus I know a couple people that work there and they can't believe how slow it has been for months. Mark my words, the fancy computers are bringing this up. Look out!!!"
"Up >12.5% in 2.5 months, + dividend locked down, to be increased next quarter. Not too shabby.. It's nice for the place you buy your hardware from to pay you back."
A simple 20-times multiple on those $8 earnings implies a 5-year forward price target of $160
LOW==garbage!
"Back to the bottom of the upward channel, time to buy"
Sales outlook looks good
O GPT 300K MORE SHARES TO COVER WAITING FOR GOOD TIMING
"Good company, but PE is rich. I will wait for a better entry Pt."
back to 185 on monday. enjoy your profits.
"Uh, $20B is more than Lowe's has made in GAAP earning over the past five years!! :-o Just because they announced it, doesn't mean they will / even-can, buy that many shares.."
I guess we will get 4-5% today. sounds good to me. this stock is way oversold.
SHORT DONT BUY U MORONS SHORT U MAKE MORE MONEY
Down goes the roller coaster
"lowe's is just a cash cow for the executives and large investors, they don't need to grow the business because their only competitor is HD and if you don't like HD you have to go to lowe's.They know all you have to do is put something on saaale really cheap and the customers will come running in, other then that they have no significant strategy, but to cut cost and employees"
How does $LOW have a 40 PE ratio? $HD is is only in the 20's. Ripe for a pullback. only thing going for LOW is the stock buybacks.
Local Lowe's still no generators. Truckload that was supposedly coming last Wednesday still not here. No lumber or plywood with no eta on when it will arrive. People flocking to HD stores to get those items. Tell me more about Lowe's great logistics.
LOW reached a 52 Week low at 85.00
Look out below today. LOW and TGT way too high. I have both and I am out at open. GLTA
"Lowe's is not only setup nicely for the next few quarters, but for the next few years. Lowe's market valuation is half that of HD. Lowe's has MUCH more upside potential than HD. HD is fully valued and needs to execute flawlessly to maintain its multiples that are nearly 2x that of Lowe's."
split that stock so young investors will buy and add it to their portfolios. Most of them can't afford it at this price.
"Lowe’s, Home Depot, Ace and True Value all hopping busy = $$$$s."
WONT TELL U HOW MANY SHARES IM COVERING ANYYMORE EITHER
AS IM COVERING U GUYS CAN BUY U CAN PROFIT WITH US
interest rate hikes usually mean people buy more homes before rates go higher. Economy is booming 4 th qtr will be huge
"I like Lowes. but sometimes they goof up. Like today, you now have to enter on a keypad, how you want you receipt.Print, Email, Both. Jeezum, even if you pay cash, you have to enter print.Its a terrible idea. Hey Lowes, instead of holding up EVERY SINGLE TRANSACTION, just ask MyLowe customers how they want their sales receipt. They can set it online. at their home. Not while there is a line of 20 people trying to check out."
LOW is up 4.92% to $90.19
"Lowe's is stupid ,very stupid to hire that guy from JCP. Very stupid. This stock will go to 50 as time passes under this snake charmer."
TRYING MAKEUS PAY HIGHER PRICE TO COVER BASTERED
My Lowe's is packed every time I go there. It appears to be more crowded than before CV-19 hit. I can't travel so I have been fixing all the deferred maintenance and upgrading around my home and my daughters home.
Lowes Lumber Sale Going Well Today:TIMMMMM BAHHHHHHHH !
If Lowes is giving delivery drivers obamabucks who is making the deliveries? Some cheaply paid vatos? 
Cramer says buy because it is in his Trust Fund. Seriously the Quarter was #$%$!And I don't see it getting any better..
I have also started adding lowes to my Roth IRA. Will eventually catch up to HD. $100+ this year me thinks.
looks like this trash is going all the way down to $150
climbing back to 52 week high.
Up up up baby
"Lucky me I bought in yesterday, our lows in hot springs is always packed. How could I go wrong? Lol"
"I told LOW longs to take advantage when the stock price dropped into the 140s. I said these levels would be back eventually and I was right. Expecting 200 by the midpoint of this year maybe earlier. The yield curve is steepening so further rallying should take place. As long as interest rates remain low the housing market will continue to boom and that means more home improvement projects will be taking place even after the economy reopens. LOW's business may take a small hit but there will still be high demand for LOW, HD, and SHW's products regardless."
LOW is rallying!!! GO LOW GO!!!
"LoL anyone that sells early is a fool. This will only go up, the longer you buy and hold. #Low float privileges"
LOW goes low
HERE IS ANOTHER FAKE V SHAPE COME ON
"Prediction may be a little ways out, but GDP will be OK tomorrow. There was some pull through dollars spent because of tariffs. Lowes basically guided to the middle of analyst estimates for 2019, but demand is going to drop. Demand is going to drop because of the pull thru and that was biggest on big ticket items like appliances as customers feared increased input prices for steel and general import tariffs. Then the housing recession/dip whatever you want to call it is going to cause people to scrap improving their houses. No need to put lipstick on the real estate deals via paint, appliances, backsplashes, vanities etc. In addition, Sears is going to exit bankruptcy with fewer stores but that is going to provide additional supply and they are going to partner with Amazon in appliances. Lastly Amazon will continue to chip away at home improvement stores with their 2-day and same-day Prime shipping. I'll check back in six months."
Why is Lowes so overvalued?
Will this ever stop going down????
Just because HD beat means that Lowe's will aswell. Also they released that all Orchard stores will close literally the night before earnings.....interesting.
Markets aare 1 big joke here. So over bought here. Nasdaq needs 20 to 30 sell off.
biggest miss ever.....tanks a million
Let’s see how many more shares idiots will keep on buying.Follow the lead of Bill Ackman so you can have negative returns year after year.
"If you're a shareholder, you need to visit the stores to see the truth. Many of the shelves are empty. Go to the Lumber department and check inventory. Go to Outside Garden and check inventory.That quarter was a unicorn. Those days, and those lines are long gone."
Holly sssssht !! Ackman invested in Lowe’s?? Sell as fast as you can .. remember valiant remember Herbalife?? He’s the worst performing hedge fund! Do the opposite and you will make money!
"HD or LOW? I own both. I want to add more, which one do you recommend and why?"
"I hope the HD Earnings release is ""bad"", and LOW follows it down into the FV buy zone.. how many times have we seen that in the past?"
"I don't understand if someone thinks that HD is better than Lowe's, I wonder why are they posting in here?"
LOW reached an all time high at 119.50
ALLOW IT COME DOWN TOLD WHEN IT WAS IN 119 U DID ALLOW IT COME DOWN MORE NOW

"Sell Short now, it will close RED"
Should have looked further for their CEO.
Is the ACLU going to sue them now for all the Hispanics their VP slanderd over new DeWalt tool tiny drill grips!!!???
Selling my shares here. This upward move is weak. Low volume in up day. When selling pressure is present.. higher volume. so this moment is ok for me to get out. Good luck longs.
What’s the rationale that this is down 7% while HD is down only 3%?
"yowza, can you say all-time high in LOW !!??"
Again the MM's drive the price down. Nothing to do with real investors. Just means price is manipulated down ahead of good results for manipulated trading. For those looking for a quick 5 to 10 % gain take advantage now. GLT
Icon buying
$200 this year
"Sold all LOW. Good Profit. Now I'm buying Anab as much as I can. Anab got no debts, $16/share cash, good pipeline, 2 deals with Big pharma and thé best thing is...I am buying it now at $11!!!!"
"Depot crushed it, Walmart beat, Target will beat, Lowe’s will absolutely crush it. Good day tomorrow, time to load up!"
This crooked CEO you got will drain your shareholder values like he did at JCP and elsewhere before. Time to reign in on these self-serving CEO's...
"So who’s the one who bought on Sep. 1st of ‘18 and just broke even? Bahaha. Anyway, short position initiated at 118. Let’s see how it goes."
this ceo has a track record of ruining companies.. his theory is not to increase sales but to close stores and save expenses.. um with no stores comes no revenue.. pathetic
Time for the rebound! Hope you bought some on the dip! GLTA!
LET ME DO SOME COVERING A LITTLE
Greenworks Pro lawn mower..with a 60 Volt Lithium battery. i bought one a year ago at Lowe's and it's one SWEET lawn mower....oh yea....

Lowe's is closing 20-40 stores today. You'll see it in the news soon.
Is Lowe’s a tech stock? It always moves with NASDAQ...
"Home Depot and Lowes over the last 5 years have earned 1.67% and 1.60% respectively on their stock value increase. So, from a stock value investment basis there is very little difference in the last 5 years between these companies. I like Lowes stock value to increase on a greater percentage basis than Home Depot but not dramatically. Granted that interests remains with in a quarter basis points over the next 6 months. Historically low interest rates will continue to spur home repairs on the families greatest asset, their home. ."
ITS AMAZING HOW FAST THIG THING COMES DOWN
Both HD and LOW will report great earnings in May. Traffic in both stores will be huge this summer and beyond. I visited both stores Saturday morning and big lines in both. Great sign!!!!
Why my posts are deleted?
who all bought call option of this expiring tomorrow? lol
"As Iv posted before I'm an employee at one of the top performing stores in the northeast in terms of sales, credit, installs, business accounts. There is no way this stock is worth $100 + and instead should be values between 75-85. The only reason this stock is pumped so much is because lowes sells stocks to their employees at a 15% discount to prop up the price, CEO change which has no real track record of success in any company, Bill Ackman money(need I say more) and of course the general state of the markets being close to the ATH. The fundamentals of this company do not warrant the current price.* The company refuses to put people on the floor. We had one of the best years in retail in the past decade and you know what lowes did recently? Cut the hours of full time/part time/ and seasonal employees. They have 1 person in lumber covering hardware and millwork. You need 2 people bare minimum to operate the lumber department which is why contractors are waiting 30min to an hour for a bunk of lumber to be dropped and loaded up. This is also why the stores are dirty and inventory is mismanaged. Nobody but 1 overworked employee covering mutltiple departments!* The only thing Proservice cares about is getting credit and getting business accounts. After that they couldn't be bothered to help you with anything else.* We got rid of our inhouse delivery people which did a hell of a lot of extra things for the customers(brought old refrigerators to peoples garage, hooked people up with free hoses and wires if they needed them and showed older people how to operate the newer machines). Now we have sub contractors of contractors who are basicially ex cons from NY and who couldn't care less about the quality of service that they provide. Literally everyday we get complaints from custumers about how rude they are and that they're not doing business with Lowes anymore.* Buildings are falling apart and roofs leak. Saw in lumber has been out for 2 months. Fork lifts are about to fall apart. * New hirees are part time millennials with no home improvement knowledge that are just thrown into a department with poor improper training*Merchandise that comes off the trailer from the warehouse is just tossed in and usually broken like light bulbs and appliancesIn short good knowledgeable people are leaving and what you have left are resentful and over worked employees. To the investors that just dismis my opinions why don't you take a walk around the company you put your money into? Does it look like a well functioning organization at the ground floor?"
"I just bought some shares on auto-pilot, @96. I had a limit order in for awhile and forgot all about it. lol, works for me, that might be about the bottom."
I added some more shares today on this silly down day!
"We're getting closer to the undervalued zone. The blended 5 yr. average P/E is 20.8. This has been consistant over the last 20 yrs., right at 20-21. So FV is ~105. The projections for end of FY earnings at current P/E would be >$123. So I would start easing in some at ~100, $95 would be sweet. I'd like to catch it before the div increase, I estimate high teens% or better. I likes to buy LOW low."
WAS UP $6 NO UP ONLY 2.30 LOL YES YES SHORT MORE
Don was DSC. Sam was zer0t0l. DSC has aisle 12 ...still. Yahoo cannot change the aisles. Some things are IMPOSSIBLE.
Incredible buying opportunity.
IM MAKIG SO MUCH MONEY DAMN LAMBORGANI TODAY
"It's a nice time to load up. We're at the 50 day moving average. Digital is fully on, while people are staying at home with the COVID spikes, colder weather, and Christmas. That means it's that time of year where we're all ""playing house"" while we wait for the vaccine. I expect a nice spike by the end of Q1."
Is the news about Lowe’s offering a cash’s dividend it’s first time offering a dividend ?
"Where oh where is Joe Don't Know? Guess I was right again Joe Don't Know. Niblock leaving, pushed out by activist investors that woke up Niblock's rubber stamp board."

People are saying the price of a 2X4X8 has gone up $ 3.00 in the last 2 weeks. The fires in timber country will be bad on the lumber business for a while.
Throw back to when people thumbed me down for buying in the 60s.
"All the housing data pointed to a continuous downturn in housing market. Weather, gov shut down, delays of projects translate to an EPS and revenue miss by LOW.HD missed! So will LOW!See you at 97 if not 87."
Better go down a lot more than what is showing in pre right now. HD at the TOP! Lowes sucks
COVER COVER COVER FAST TAKE YOUR PRFOIT GUYS
THOSE WHO SHORTED AT 123 COVER FAST IM TELLLING U
I do not recommend shorting this i will be selling my tech and placing a nice bet on them :) looked over the financials way undervalued
Lowes is going to go away like circuit city did. Their new management structure is crippling the company from the inside out. I know of at least 10 employees that left and the rest hate the place. They either need to make a big change or their business model will fail
I GOT MILLION SHARES I SHORTED
COVERING WE WIL MAKE MORE MONEY TRUST ME
SHORTS COVER NOW TRUST ME BEFORE END OF DAY THIS BE IN GREEN AND HIGHER
"This seems to happen to LOW at every earnings release, no matter how good earnings are. Target blows out and people love it. I've owned this since March of 2009, so long term it is good, but I hate to see it lose."
TWO hurricanes enough said
HOME DEPOT SHORTINGLOWE WE ALL SHORTING LOL CEO IS IDITIO
"Load up $ma $low, $se and $nio go toMoon"
So why is LOW flat to down?
I have played this stock prior​ to earnings just as I do with Home Depot and usually clean up.I do believe is a great deal stronger than the manipulators pretend. Good Luck ! 
HD over 300 a share projected to earn 11.94 a share this year. In 2023 Low will be earnings over 12.70 a share and likely more since they beat most of the time.
I see 175 by the end of September actually.
It is time to buy puts
BOOM!
The $low tick up! Then BOOM#$%$
What I have noticed is some of the longest lines ever at Lowes it's like Christmas time. People are spending more time at home. They are accommodating their homes for spending more time there. Having more time at home I have also been working on projects that I've been needing to do.
Do we got to $85 or $75? Thought this stock would be hitting new highs buy now. I bought about $82 so hope it headed to $90
In at $149 :) GLTA!
Shorts got burned big time
"I have finally realized why people go to Home Depot rather than to Lowes. I wanted to send a fax to current President and CEO Marvin Ellison today, but no one knows what it is. Perhaps they are into money laundering and avoiding indictments as well as legal notice of intention to sue."
You' would think this guy is the Messiah the way this stock went up
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 128.00
U GUYS BOUGHT IN 121 FORGOT IT SORRY GUYS
"New Yahoo Finance format very poor. Go back to Old format. Yahoo now sticks ads, junk articles on Finance page now yahoo ""Conversations"" = rumor mill by anybody. LOWS = $200 by 2018 !!"
LOWES IS ABOVE THE 50-Day Moving Average 3 100.64200-Day Moving Average 3 109.43THIS IS BULLISH SO WATCH THIS STOCK TO KEEP GOING HIGHER
wonder why today it's taking a hit but yesterday got through unscathed
what's the chances of another down day tomorrow?
"Lowes/Rona has new competiton in Canada.Some prices at Canac are 50% and more cheaper.Electric wire 14/2 26.95, Canac 10.59. Most of the product are like that."
Easily 100 plus. When will it split ?
How has lowes done on previous positive earnings?
low will be purchased by wmt or amzn
WONT WONT WONT WONT
That’s Ellisons style. He can care less about the Associates in the stores. He’s way over his head as a CEO
...Sold 1/2 my shares last time LOW hit 100...Holding the rest for probably 5+ years..I rate LOW as a ..Hold.
How many Lowes could Rob Lowe rob if Rob Lowe could Rob Lowes?
Whats driving this stock up did they leak something to the analysts?
This is a monster of a stock. I bought LOW at the bottom of the Coronavirus dip and now have a 57 percent gain. It's even higher than it was prior to the Coronavirus. Very bullish on LOW and HD. Good stocks to own during and post Coronavirus.
LOW is up 8.48% to 73.55
"Mr. Ellison will have to be fearless about repairing the broken Lowe's culture in the home office. LOW was a once great retailer but they have acted like they lost complete touch with what matters, which is delighting paying customers. Talk to the store associates - they will tell you - Lowe's home office culture of self congratulating failures with force pushing convoluted program after program to the field has cost Lowe's billions in lost market cap. Niblock ran a great balance sheet - but it takes more than that to win in retail and Lowe's is disliked more than it is liked by consumers now. The home office is now filled with bad actors from top to bottom and he is going to have to wipe it out."
Major red day coming We will test the 100 levelsNot safe at all
"Lowe’s has been upgraded and will see $150 after Q2 earnings are published if not sooner. They crushed Q1, especially April. May blew April away and June is doing the same!"
Long term ROTH holder. Just bought for 159. Going strong over the holidays!
DAMN LOWES DOES THAT TO THEIR BUYERS
"Another outstanding miss by #2,,,"
GREEN NEXT THEN UP WE GO
"Lowe is a cleaaner than HD, with less dust. Trump will slap digital sales tax on Amazon, it is avoiding tax probably. Housing is increasing, home reno on the rise."
why is this down almost 5%? What a joke! Why did I ever buy this #$%$?
U SEE WHEN IT JUMP UP
CEO HAS O CONTROL OVER HIS STOCKS
"Looking for day and swing trade alerts? LionStockAlerts has got you covered. No fluff or BS, just pure technical trade alerts."
Who made mistake of buying before earnings? I did.

"Once again, I am a small business owner, I do not work for Lowes or ever have, do not work for the government, except when I was in the Navy in my 20's. And I wish I was 49. All my (LOW) shares are in a Roth IRA. Please do not be out smarted by a impersonator."
"Sold for a nice profit, from a medium term position, gtla"
Is DSC still collecting shopping carts in the Lowes parking lot all day? 
IM COVERING AT LEAST 50K MORE SHARE HERE I GO

Watch out! A lackluster dividend announcement will be another catalyst for a selloff.
What a nice lawnmower....Greenworks Pro with 60 volt lithium battery. Excellent at picking up grass and leaves. Makes your job easy...oh yea....
"Pro Tip. Don't sleep on $TBL Taiga, it's where lowes and hd get supplies.. on another 30% comp year. You're Welcome."
"This stock reminds of me IBM at $210. Trying to shrink the float to goose earnings by taking on debt. This game never works out for shareholders in the long run. Just a lipstick on a pig. The jig is up, not best-of-breed, closing stores, pulled out of mexico. You know who isn't closing stores or pulling out of mexico. Home Depot."
Spring real estate market looks to be very strong as we lap last March start of covid lock down....
why does yahoo show a crazy debt/ equity anyone?
"Thank you, we did not receive good service in flooring! Went somewhere else."
This stock should be 190 -200 Dont understand why a company reports great earnings off the chart then stock drops 20 points . Tired of hearing the #$%$ guidance story. Should you sell your stock before every earning report?
"I got calls on 500 shares, so climb lowes climb"
Most products last 2 months. Now that Lowe's changed return policy to 30 days. Why pay $130. at Lowe's air conditioner when you can pay $99. from Walmart then throw it away. I see a trend developing in retail and I do not think it will be air conditioner manufacturers making products that last longer.
I own both HD and LOW. Based of financials I am leaning towards liquidating LOW and buying high dividend ETFs with profits. No plans to sell HD. it's been GOOD for me. Comments?
I BOUGHT COMING DOWN NOW BUYING GOING UP WATCH
OKAY GUYS ENOUGHT LETS DO SOME COVERING IM DOING IT NOW BEFORE 10:30 I HAVE BAD FEELING 1030 SOMETHING GONNA HAPPEN
I see $135 within 30 days....
"Don't worry, Sears will be out of business soon."
Took a small position today in Low. like the upside. Just saying I would pay their people more on Easter but not close while HD remains open. Business is about making money.
Why is LOW getting hammered today?
Loosing $1100 I am getting out on dead cat bounce tommarow
Bought LOW at 22 + change in 2012 when I worked there. Not just with employee discount but threw in for 1000 at $23+. Wish I bought more.
How much will the dividend be raised for July? I say to at least .60/qtr
"If not for lower tax rate, earnings would be flat or down."
I might buy more puts before 3pm today
LOL MARKET UP WE BROUGHT LOWES DOWN GUYS GOOD JOB
NOT TAKING ANY CHANCE TAKING MY PROFIT NOW
"^ up scope today, like a lowes 2x4 wall frame being stood up and plumbed!"
Sold out my HD and purchased lowes. I think it has more upward potential.
By Home Depot instead!!!
I M DOING 110K SHARE COVER
SF you spamming so' of a b'. I'm short but you're just another robinhood trader with $500 portfolio.
"Went to Low’s to buy washer, dryer, & refrigerator, but their inventory was spread out over different local stores with no way for the sales associate to write up all & have them delivered at the same time. She said she would have to call each store to verify inventory, but could only do so if that stores dept answered the call. She said often they didn’t. In this day of computerized intensity tied in with delivery, Lowe’s clearly isn’t up to speed. We then went to a independent dealer & he had all units in stock, and set them up for immediate delivery. There is nothing as good as a independent, knowledgble, stocking dealer."
Earnings will be great. Not sure how much potential though for uptick after. I am thinking this one isn't so burned up. I predict 5% gains tomorrow.
"Lowe's Canada is going nowhere.Will probably write off Rona like the chain of stores in Australia, 581 millions few years ago.Good luck !"
it does not take Marvin Ellison long before company goes BK. Home Depot must be laughing.
"$LOW has been showing support at 90.28 and resistance at 101.59. Buy rating: 7, target: 121.32, according to 9trading. http://www.foxchart.com/share/374054742.png"
$55 I'll buy some.
U CNAT MAKE THISJUMP WATCH I CAN I BUY SHARE BUY BACK BY SHORT COVER
you all dont think that the Wall street king pins are not loading up right now?...of course they are ....holiday sales are always huge for LOWE's...
Hurricane rebuild show benefit Lowe. The few hundred billions rebuilt efforts will lift the stock. I will buy it while it is cheap.
what an over reaction...........short this spike!
There is nothing like an excellent earning report to bring out all the degenerate short selling gamblers!
My target here is $150 after earnings release. Sell buy puts folks
horrific
"Yay, going up on weak volume. The drop is coming! Fxxk you Ackhole for propping up this POS on a poor ER"
what happened to Joe? Joe Don't Know where are you?
Not sure why anyone would believe Lowes pricing would be affected any differently than what happened after Home Depots earnings call. I'm sure Lowes has to pay out extra too keep their employees working too... just saying.
SHORT SHORT NOW STILLL CAN SHORT OW STILL CAN SHORT
This stock will be back strong very soon!!
"DSC, maybe you should take up using marijuana? It sounds like there really isn't any other solution to your issues. "
Soon an inflow of disappointed WMT investors into LOW.
I JUST HAVE FEELING HE IS GOING TO DO THAT
Lowes will close more store by year end in Canada.They are good for big box store but does not know anything about small store.
when will lowes start sharing the wealth ........ tax cut money and profits are here lets use it ............time to increase dividends and or a stock split ......... do something right for the workers
"My question yesterday that received zero replies.""Will Lowes follow HD and so many other stocks recently with great earningsand then dip in share price? Why not is the question?"""
LOW up 9.20 today!! LOL
Lowes will split do not sell
NOW IN GREEN NOW ITS GOING UP $1.25
#$%$ all garbage
"did someone say overreaction... and 3b in #$%$. cmon folks.. do the math.. 3hours ago, BAC came out with their updated pt of $205. buy, collect a div, and see this grow to new highs."
Did they post a loss or a profit? Hard to find any info
"Lowe’s has gotten so much of my money through purchases already this year, it’s hard for me to sell this stock... I can’t help but think I’m just one of millions of people who have emptied their bank accounts into the Lowe’s cash registers!"
"Walk into Lowe's and things are being changed around again. Go to Cust Service on say a matter regarding a specific order , they tell you to go to the department. Appears CS is good for returns only. Noticed new 15 min parking near door for Pick up your placed order. Go past new desk, no one there... I shop around say about 1/2 hour , buy some stuff, same cars in spots. I see they just rotate old vendors for new low cost items. People don't appear happy there. They did away with a special group of people that just dealt with customers that knew the store. See man just focused on putting stuff away on pallets. I guess no night stocking! Is Lowe's interested in looking pretty or selling product and service? I have stock and concerned!"
TAKE YOUR PROFIT SHORT AGAIN LATER WHEN GOES UP
So I wonder. Do today's earnings include the sales from Niblock's 2 recent over priced acquisitions? Do the same store sales reflect the addition of the revenue from the IRIS security monitoring that Lowe's now divides among the stores? If so what are the true sales growth numbers before those changes.
"And the Lowes - HD gap grows again today. 1.86 today, every day it grows and Lowes falls further behind."
Believe spring real estate market will be huge and home reno/investment will continue......the PEG ratio on this is below 1 which is amazing.....if they are continuing to gain share from HD then their stock will soar post ER. Great inflation hedge and way to play real estate boom!
no late day fade....let's go. people are getting those stimulus checks and will unload on appliances and home improvements. share buybacks too.
"Well another bankrupt JCP executive gets a job at Lowe’s as “Executive Vice President”. Amazing. Hahah, what next? Anyone from Enron looking for a job at Lowe’s?"
WAIT LET IT COME DOWN
I los so much money in this what the heck good ER and this goes down
"Taking profits, but she'll be up tomorrow."
Lowe’s said Wednesday it repurchased $621 million in stock in the third quarter after not purchasing any in the second quarter. The company expects to buy back $3 billion of its stock in the fourth quarter.
THIS STOCK SHOULD BE 130 NOT AT 117
Always remember in the stock market Brave are rewarded greedy are slaughtered. By when everybody is selling and sell when everybody is buying. Be patient and you will be rewarded . Don't you ever lose money on the stock market patience is everything if you hold a good stock. And Lowe's is a good stock
Do they have money to announce buy back?
What are the chances this will touch at least $100 by Friday?
"Looking forward, when they report Q4 earnings in Feb 2021, we are expecting $1.20. That is amazing. That is awesome. Don’t let analyst’s expectations bring you down. Focus only on the numbers. This is a buy and hold with solid growth, and relatively happy employees, great buybacks, great dividends and less competitors than a year ago."
When this squeeze is over it possibly could look very ugly
Tons of great news! Will be going much higher!
"gonna be a slow steady drip back to mid to low 80's, wish it was fast so that I did not have to watch the stock"
Buying opportunity.
HOME DEPOT GREEN. THIS WILL FOLLOW
Next stop 105
wow BIG miss!
You can't go wrong by shorting companies operated by ex-JCP employees. Lowe's isn't the only victim here.
Major run tomorrow
Why is this down $2 loll makes no sense
Almost 5 months of gains wiped out in 4 days. Gotta love the stock market. Stairways up and elevator crash down. At support here Have to buy here and hope thing with virus don't get a whole lot worse.
"Went in a Lowes yesterday, and Ellison has definitely put a lift kit and giant chrome wheels on the stores.POINTLESS! How is that going to make it compete with Home Depot? How about just giving people a raise or hiring actual talent in the stores????"
Home Depot is about to smoke Lowe’s now that Marvin Ellison is coming aboard. Time to ruin Lowes’s just as he did J.C. Penney. Sorry for your loss. Could have done much better.
Hold both call and long. Consider adding HD. Any thought?
Papa Johns is losing money because of their affiliation with the NFL and their disrespect of the country and their fans. Or is it a case of making #$%$ pizza? eye do not know.
WOW earnings beat by $3 BILLION..... but still no boost on the dividend. Cheap cheap cheap
Bill Ackman top holding correct?
lowe has been consistently losing the contractor business for 15 years. they need a marketing plan or discount/loyalty program OR SOME INCENTIVE to gain back the contractor business they've lost. some mgmt/ marketing heads should roll as well. HD caters to both DIY'er and contractors. WHY CAN'T LOWE???
"I cannot vision Lowes beating ER. LOW ends 4Q in Jan 31. so therei 4th Q had the entire Govt Shutdown and the beginning of the Polar Vortex that hit the Midwest. As a real estate investors, I have been in the sideline due to the uncertainty. I am not the only one. REal Esate agents I have been in contact with state homes are sitting on the market longer and listing prices have been decreases. The only thing going for it now is that Rates have pulled back. Deals are harder to come by. (Yes this is market specific).not to mention that going forward, most Americans are not getting the Tax refund they anticipated. they did not realize that their pay checks were marginally larger. Yes I took a short position in LOW, unless someone can convi\nce me otherwise. I applied this logic to Walmart as well but Walmart actually does better in bad times, like the Govt Shutdown."
"Let me get this straight, the new Lowe’s CEO who brought JCP to bankruptcy levels, on top of that top 5 Lowe’s executives get fired, including the COO within the months of taking the job at Lowe’s; I’ll give it a year for this guy before he gets booted. The stock has been up from the $40s to $110 in five years and they bring this joker? Down from here, $65 at best on a good day. Short with confidence my friends."
Buy now. It will go up at least 5 dollars tomorrow. It’s a great stock. With hosing asked sky rocketing. The revenue will be great by next quarter. Bargain price at this point. Too bad l have all my funds tied up at Google and LI. Only got myself 200 shares. Don’t miss your chance.
"This new CEO, Investor Ackerman and certainly Earnings Report. Does not justify this Stock moving up over 10% today. I smell a rat. Shorties will soon make big bucks."
DAMN MARKET MAKER HE IS TRICKY
The chart looks real bad. Looks like it will test 90 in the near future.
Did they bring niblock back today?
"dsc retired from LOW's as a major stockholder. Sold a bunch of equipment through the years, from snow blowers, rakes, lawn mowers and seeds. Dsc sitting on his porch now watching people go to work."
Best stock to own throughout 2018
TAKE YOUR PROFIT IM TELLING U THIS WONT GO DOWN MUCH MORE IF U THINKING COVER WHILE U CAN

Trump doing what he promises. Sealing US borders from terrorist.
LOW execs racist comments will prove harmful. Many Hispanics are planning to boycott them and take their business to HD. Would hate to be holding this when the alleged boycotts start. https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/08/27/smaller-hands-lowes-exec-touts-drill-perfect-hispanics/2132659001/
"Goldman Sachs says Texas disaster will add 30 billion to the GDP in construction and repairs. And Lowes drops .50 percent??. Do you suppose they have to ""see"" with their own eyes the damage when the water recedes? Clearly material is going to be needed and Lowes is a good neighbor and business in Texas that should be rewarded in stock upgrades and purchases. But is this manipulated to reduce value for hedge funds?"
How many groundless sell-offs should we endure before it pops to $170+. Buy now or be sorry later!
WATCH IT
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 160.50

Pricey...for slowing housing
Need to go back $ 98.50 today or we are in troble
we just need the market to pick up from here and this thing we fly back to 52week high. expect lowes to reach 200 late 2019. holding this stock and adding more
"Check again, after hours is now flat. Don't trust pre or after market stuff."
Target $185==strong buy!
what has happened to this stock?!?!?!?!
Is it still safe to get in on Lowe’s before earnings?
golden cross on the way
Told you all Marvin Ellison is the Kiss of death for your stock and employees. Look what he did to JC Penneys prior and other positions before that one...
DONT SELL BUY GUYS AND SHORT COVER COVER COVER
"The forward P/E ratio is 17 now. Cheaper than HD, WMT and TGT.I thought this was a really good earnings report and I am a buyer. 30% revenue growth is amazing."
"Why can't lowes give it's full time employees Set hrs dsc20601 If lowes wants to be #1 for home improvement, keeping full time workers with knowledge & giving them set hrs, would really increase market share for the company. I love my job, but I am looking, only because the daily change in hrs creates great stress for myself & family."
why are we down?
AT 1130 WHEN EUROPEAN CLOSE IT WILL SHOOT UP WATCH
div yield is falling big time today!
Hurricane money coming in...Lowes cost cutting starting to finally pay off to share holders.
"Stores are empty. Shelves are empty. Too many mistakes taking place right now to cover up.This thing is going to collapse in a big, big way. Talk to anyone who is still employed."
My cost average is now $38.21....Strong Buy & Hold.
It takes more than a CEO to make a good company.
"I honestly think HD misses 1q revenue based on: reduced hours to 6pm for most of quarter, limited # of customers who could shop at one time (100 @ a time, then line qued outside. Think Pro's liked uncertainty of entry lines? On the contrary, Lowe's picked up the 6p-9p traffic and didn't alter customer entry in majority of locations. During today's noon hour on CNBC, a guest fund managers cited HD traffic data running near a 10% increase for 1Q, while Lowe's ran 20% increase in traffic (unsure of their source.) We all know both have had packed parking lots. Can't underestimate impact of 20% traffic increase on your top-line.How will extra costs/covid expenses impact earnings? No ideaExpecting Lowe's to post a jaw dropping top-line and outperform HD's YOY 1q comps.We will see if I'm right, in the next 36 hours.(I own LOW)"
Buying the dip. 161 is a bargain now. This stock is going back to 180 once the smoke of the political atmosphere and the virus lets up.
WE ARE DOUBLE THE VOLUME ALREADY
how can I get approved to buy options?can some one help me
SELL THIS LOSER! CEO RAN JCP INTO THE ground!!!
My only problem with LOW is that the dividend is nowhere near HD. I just sold 300 shares and bought 500 of ABBV which has a way better dividend at a much lower pps.
THATSS WHY I SHORTED HE IS A MORON
D.E. Shaw already making changes. Stock up pre-market.
can't understand why this did not fly up 3 or 4 points with Hurricane Irma mess
"Way pricy now, like ALL stocks"

Guys on Fast Money tonight said LOW is a Buy!!!
Added @ $76.54 to IRA
This will have a huge sell off tomorrow no one in their right mind will hold this into a long holiday weekend where 1 tweet can send it crashing down. Always lock in those profits. Silver & Gold are way up and LOw is being propped up by computer algorithms not retail buyers.
IT WILLL COME DOWN BE PATIENT
IM GOING 50K SHARES TO PUSH IT ABOVE 117

lows layed off 2400 x 65000.00 = buy stock back = price of stock going up $$$$$$

Went to Lowes this weekend. Packed couldn’t even find a shopping cart.
"huge volume, big guys are taking their profits. Hope it will reverse tomorrow just like HD."
I was hoping for a reversal of the month long down trend today. Looks like it is going to be a long slog back up to the 170s. GLTA
"The new tax plan is going to reduce potential income to HD and Lowe's by Billions with a capital ""B"""
I see this stock plummeting to $low 20's before we hear the next earnings call. Investors have no tolerance for missed targets. Similar stocks have been severely punished and have buyers ignored what the analysts say. look at EVH for example what traded at $6 when analysts were calling for a $20 expected valation. Best this stock into the teens!
I say we get a big dump into the holiday.
grabbed some at $150.00....see you all at $180.00 soon...GLTA
The drivers for the underperformance were expenses due to store revamps and Covid-19-related expenses. I will be adding at open most likely.
ohhhh..... this is GD ridiculous now!!!
eeeeeevryday. late day dump. it's truly remarkable
"Large Consumer cyclical + largest US import companies had great quarters.$WMT$TGT$HD$LOW$DG$DLTR (don't like Dollar Tree Fundamentals, two of the above companies have beat earnings.)These big Five retailers have little ""middle man"" expenses + anticipation of tariffs results in increased Import Volume at cheaper costs."
"Every time. Every time. Every time I go to the Lowes website, I have to enter in the store I usually shop. Over the last 8 years, I've probably browsed 4 days a week online, and had to select a store 900 times. Well, it used to be they kept a different store as the default, and you always had to change it. SO ITS NO BETTER But whats with their webmaster who can't get a cookie or something to keep my store the same. Its like their website was created 20 years ago. of course the Home Depot was freezing up all the time with long running scripts. yeah, they have a lot of products, but the searches at these stores sometimes is extremely lacking."
Ellison is bringing in his cut and burn culture along with all his buddies from the JCPenny days ... Look how that ended .... Hedge funds put this guy in place and it will be turn out to be a disaster ..
Nice upgrade this morning.... my 109 calls are going to be worth tons when the week ends!!!
"Lowes going to hire 65000 people .. most likely 90% minimum wage types … this is after they eliminate many higher paying, more functional FT store positions.. really not making a splash that will 'improve' the store experience, just have voids in the aisles."
LOL
"The mass of people will realize that Lowes and Home Depot will profit tremendously from Harvey, Irma, and possibly Jose massive Hurricanes. The both of these stocks will rise much higher when the general population knows. Th general population is on the bell curve like anything else in statistics."
tickersign change of LOW to HIGH would be deserved.
"Bad earnings came out, Low is getting new CEO. Hedge fund buys in, and Hedge fund manager buys in and Stock goes up. This will take a long time if at all to improve sales. HD is well run company. This stock is $10.oo per share over valued."
"Get ready for labor issues. I interviewed several drivers. Problem. The pension is only 46% funded. (Their words) They think their trustees are screwing them. In fact, its UPS management."
Was there a downgrade today? Why down over $2
"Everything is overpriced and the stores are empty of anything you actually need. Buy, the bubble! Home repairs until forbearance is over and housing crashes!"

"This is great information today from BMO. Lowes will increase sales by up to 644 million as a result of the devastating 2 hurricane impacts, in material and equipment sales.HD – BMO Capital Markets gets bullish on Home Depot and Lowe’s citing post-hurricane rebuilding efforts.SEP 14, 2017 | 10:44AM | BY STOCKNEWS.COM STAFFThat’s according to BMO Capital analyst Wayne Hood who today raised his earnings estimates on both Home Depot and its chief rival, Lowe’s. Hood notes that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma mark the first time two category-4 hurricanes made U.S. landfall in the same year. While storm-related products skew toward lower margin items, the increase in sales volume is significant.In a note to clients, Hood stated: “The combined benefit of both hurricanes to Home Depot’s 2017 sales could approach $1,041 million to $1,318 million, exceeding the combined $672 million benefit for Hurricanes Irene and Sandy. Similarly, the benefit to Lowe’s could be $484 million to $644 million in 2017 compared with a combined benefit of $224 million for Hurricanes Irene and Sandy"
"That's why coronavirus is still running rampant, HD, LOW, Ace, and other diy stores are exempt and people love going to these stores, sometimes for no reason whatsoever."
when is dividend day?
Ackerman bought Lowe’s ?? That means this sucker is going to tank!! Lol! Do the opposite he does and make money
One thing missing in all these rah rah comments. Dwindling inventory levels and supply chain issues. Every retailer is experiencing them. Lowes and HD may be on fire now but it is unsustainable with current supply chain. Shelves are emptied and not being replinshed. Can't make much money with empty shelves.
We will see $100 no doubt about it
Shorts merely playing their game. And will get burnt. Lowes a dollar below Home Depot is bargain sale days. Home improvement is number one concern of household asset. Home is most valuable asset a person owns. And Lowes has the materials at better cost than or price matched to Home Depot. Adding more shares now.

Good news. Dividend raised to .55 per quarter.
I don’t regret selling but it was a lesson learned
"Wonder if closing stores is the right move.Didn't work that well for Sears of JC Penny.I shopped my local OSH(Lowe's subsidiary closing all stores) yesterday,the last day before it closed forever.Got 95% off on a bunch of electrical stuff."
"lol.... LOW climbs while HD slimes ! (I own both, I just wanted to throw that out to the LOW DE's and haters)..."
Why don’t this much compare to HD?
"wow, LOW higher, HD lower on the same day, unusual. What's up, something is going down? lol"
when is the share buyback gonna start?
"HD, LOW & Harbor Freight....What the heck is an amzn?? Never been in that store...."
Will LOW sales go up and benefit from the situation in the East Coast? I bought at when it was at the highest 
"Yep, you just keep buying and watch what ackerman does to you once he has all the options that he wants. I will bet he is selling calls and buying puts."
"I had to wait in line 25 minutes to pay at lowes on May 3 after not being able to find a parking spot on May 2, Q2 will be huge"
"Lowes doesn't need to worry about 'justice fighters' looting them, only people that make improvements really know where they are located anyway"
SHORTS DAY TRADERS LETS DO IT COVER
Where do you think we’ll see any support?
"If you're thinking of buying some LOW, I would probably buy it now at this price point before all the dip buyers come in. This will be back over $200 in no time in my opinion."
HERE I COME SHORT SOME SHAREA
Buying more at the open. LOW ridiculously cheap below 150.
"More home projects, more time home for the holdiays, more lowes and HD... Home sales rising (new and existing), 0 interest rate, consumer saving rates high, Covid raging, holiday sales, stimulus a matter of when, not if.... What else do you need to know... This is a buy, with a solid divvy... Pt's $200-230.."
Sorry longs. Big players on Wall Street punish stocks that do not have strong buying. They are shorting this and bringing it down.
Ellison nearly ruined JCP.He started emptying the warehouses and closing stores.The same thing he is doing at Lowes. (Quick Spike in Earnings) Then Down!!Why don’t these companies search for people than can target Problem areas and what needs to be done to make the store profitable?I believe Lowes is a Good Short after ER. ......................ace
"4 to 6% gain tomorrow from current levels, buy"
"HEES, FB, BABA beat the expectation too, somehow I didn’t see going up 12%"
U DAMN GUYS BRINGING THIS UP AGAIN
Morale at the store level scares me. Employees leaving and the overall attitude to management is poor at best.
"In the time it took you to post this complaint you could have been registered for the required My lowes military approval. How is that discount working out for you at wally world?.........that's right, you don't get one."
This Ackman pumped farce. Back to $100 where it belongs. You sir are not HD
LOW is rocking!!! Here comes $ 173.00!!! GO LOW GO!!!
Thought it be up more today lol
"Mr Spic really talks a lot of hate towards Lowes..Says he does not own the stock, is not shorting it, and has never worked for Lowes. And he didnt know who the CEO was. Something smells fishy with him."
"Went to Lowe’s this week for a small project and I nearly fell over at the price of lumber. $LOW and $HD may be flying high right now, but I don’t see how this doesn’t eventually (and very quickly) begin changing customer habits — it completely changed my plans."
Lowe’s HD and Ace are all exempt and people are flooding their doors. Housing is still active and ramped up for record breaking records
Buying the dip. LOW having a rare consecutive days of declines. 170 to 164 to me smells like a way to get in cheap. LOW will be back above 170 in no time and I predict will hit 200 before the end of the year. Load em up folks.
Lowes out performs HD revenue growth in 4Q16. Interesting read.
"Just wondering if next dividend increase is going to reflect company success. LOW =1.67%, HD = 2.4%."
Hopefully Lowe's management will realize business is more than reports and when is t-time...this company should be interested in expansion not tighten up to liquidate as JCPenney and Sears to secure executive bonuses and raises with exit bonuses in the millions.
"BOYCOTTING AMAZON yet? Then lose money on Lowes, it will be partially your fault."
This traded under $100 this morning in the premarket?!?! What is that about? Someone got a steal. They can sell at the open for $10 profit.
should bottom round 76
Profits from hurricane repair supplies starting to affect bottom line. Green time.
It looks like after hours the shares are going up
LOW at all time High-- no irony there!
Financial analysts have put absurd valuations on this and HD. Take profits today. Earnings are already priced in...
I have a limit sell for half my shares @ 100
"Stop selling you freaking clowns, people are buying the most expensive homes ever in history, spending a little money to fix them is like nothing when the economy will reopen. Until then, people will do all the piled up work they are still behind from years of deferred maintenance."
Look at LOW rally!!! Big payday for home improvement stocks!!! GO LOW GO!!!
HMNY........do your DD and make lots of $$$$$$$
HE COULDNT HOLD $7-$8 UP FOR U GUYSLONGS
"selling water in the desert? is not a sign of well run company?? just hugr opportunity that they are only partially seeing? DAh?? note housing sales slow??? means more folks staying in their HOMES!...28% of all homes Underwater? means those folks Staying in there homes?...Lack of low priced homes to buy? aso those folks staying in homes?/ With the many subprime home loans in trouble? those folks staying in there homes??? Lowes has this HUGE one time opportunity with these special onr time happenings??? where MORE folks need LOWES??? But clowns can not see forest for the trees...All that opportunity? and what have the Lowes ""GODS"" on Mt Olympus done??? but those are needs of mere mortals (IE Customers) Well>>>Worst customer Dis Service ever AKA the Dept Od Sales prevention??? With there ON hold?? transfer to wrong Person? more on Hold? trandfer again? then get disconected so can start all over...another Lowes Tradition...On hold till you give up...Sure signs of Sucess??? Is it Not?"
BTIG just out with a Buy Rating $95 PT
"Ellison and Lowes going down- simple as that!Last Monday's early am video conference to all stores mgrs saw VP McFarlan make such a huge discriminatory remark regarding Hispanic Shoppers, it is all over social media now.He told managers to push the new DeWalt cordless compact drill with smaller grip to Hispanics, because Hispanic people have smaller hands and can hold them better- and stated he expected to make major product profit off doing so.....My son is one of their managers and is tired of Lowes BS and is leaving. Where I live another older experienced manager I know as well is leaving next week too because of what Lows corp has/is doing to them all... In case of my son who has managed Targets, Clark Tires/Mr. Tire. Auto Zone, etc his current stint with Lowes says he never in all his combined years of retail ever had to fire so many people from Lowes! He cannot find competent replacement in younger folks and is 65+ quota behind on employees needed- ONLY reason Lowes earnings were hyped as they were, is Lowes got rid of 10's of thousands of jobs and reduced other hours and benefits so their bottom line looked so good- and Ellsion and top execs received additional bonus and benefits and self-enriched stock ! Biggest frustration is NO manager is given heads up, they receive e-mail early on a morning and told ""fire this many"" or ""hire this many"", and so the continued bad morale continues with employees..."
CVS/HIT AT IT AGAIN- $80 to $low $70's
OK So trades at less than 17 times forward PE dunno why it is down...
20K MORE SHARE IM COVERING
"Considering LOW bought back stock averaging $173, it is on sale now. $20B stock buy back budget is huge and will drive LOW higher for sure."
HERE GOES LOWES GOING UPWARD NOW
While everyone thrashes. I take that momentum to buy and eventually make a nice profit.
"Diana and the rest of the shorts are on a suicide mission with LOW. Rising lumber costs won’t stop homes from being built. They actually fatten homebuilders’ margins, not cause them to shrink. Another reason besides the spat between the US and Canada for the price of lumber being so high is that during COVID much of the lumber production was cut off. Once that production resumes with economic reopening the price of lumber will fall. If the US and Canada get around to resolving their wood differences the price of lumber falls further. Rising lumber costs are not the headwind to homebuilding and contractors many people believe them to be, especially when demand is far greater than supply. I expect thumbs downs from ignorant shorts but LOW will continue to humble the yahoo shorts like Diana and her aliases."
All time highs record performance. Believe executives are getting huge bonuses but ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for the shareholders. WHY?
STRONG SEL SEL SEL THIS HORSE MANURE TRASH OF A COMPANY!CEO RAN JCP INTO THE GROUND!
Short Squeeze! They're running for the hills trying to bail before it pops!
Just bought 1800 shares.
Why is this empty home improvements store so-called Lowe’s is at $150? Have you all gone mad? $112 Billion dollar valuation? There are more employees strolling around than customers in every store. At best this is a $75-$85. Shorting here at these bloated levels.
"ex divi date tommorrow? and its this low, not good"
SHORT KEEP SELLING YES YES YES YES
SHORT MY ADVISE TO U COVER NOW WTILL GOT TIME
WE PROFIT WAIT TILL IT COMES DOWN
"This pig is ready for slaughter, I am out. Thanks for the ride. I'll buy back in the $60-$70 range."
"LOW sucks, I work for them By dsc20601.Oct 31, 2009 11:38 AM. dsc20601 posted on Oct 31, 2009 that he worked for Lowes. LOW sucks, I work for themBy dsc20601.Oct 31, 2009 11:38 AM .I have a BA, and been there 2 1/2 yrs and have not received a raise, they have no cost of living increases or raises at all. No pensions, or do they give you stock. Only the store Manager. I say sell it. Store morale is very poor."
HD and Lowes are both up premarket. That's a good sign. Maybe they have buyers because of the big storm off of FLA.
We’re else do u go HD IS OUT u go toLOWSLOWS IS OUT U go to HD Pick both u will make money
So the tear down begins... you had to see something like this coming after they hired Ellison
Save most of job market fools. All these fools out there ringing their own groceries at self check out counters period. Yep there you have it Millions of jobs in America instant fix to unemployment period. Why would any one ring their own groceries fools. Take jobs away and no discounts for ringing your own fools. Companies greed only in doing this period. Higher stock prices less over head etc. Old line Wake Up America period.
"On February 5, 2018, JEFFERIES upgraded Lowe's from Hold to Buy with a price target of 129. So much for following analyst recommendations. Hard to believe that these people actually get paid to be wrong so often."
"This isn't a stay at home stock. Construction is still going to buy lumber, electric parts, plumbing parts, and people are still going to buy appliances. Not sure why they are selling. Earnings are going to be great next week."
"The only good thing in the report and announcement was #$%$ poor forward guidance. They posted numbers that even JCP could beat. He's now lowered the bar enough to beat for the next couple QTR's. If they don't, expect this to be cut in half. Still up on my 1500 shares but the unfortunate part is I've had them for awhile. I, along with many, kept being duped with the assessments in the ANALst community that the turnaround was at hand. Very poor execution at the top."
"Up scope on the LOW today, baby. Like a drywall installer on stilts! Still not above FV."
If I could buy shares of Menards I would but they’re not private and not nation wide but the very best to go for this stuff. Give em time and I’ll be buying if they ever go public.
THEY BETTER COVER NOT WAIT TILL LAST MINUTE BE UGLY
Same pin reaction as HD. I wonder if we will hold the gains this morning?
BE PATIENT LET IT COME DOWN WONT GO UP PROMISE U
"I of course could be very wrong but shorts covered a lot of shares in last 6 weeks. I believe Lowes took their last shot at buying back stock, and from here on out it will be tough financial engineering ahead. They are being squeezed on tech against HD and pressured by Amazon on the other side. Store closures following John Divorak theory. I believe this is the beginning of the end of Lowes. In 10 years it won’t exist and this is the beginning of the end. They have a lot of debt to equity, trade at a high PE, have bounced considerably more than HD, are at decent high of being overbought, with the market being at a spot of being overbought. HD made a lot of excuses on the CC. I don’t generally like buying options before earnings as insurance is expensive but I liked this setup enough to commit to it and bought someoptions."
"Couldnt find any power tools - no sanders, no saws- had to order from Amazon (whom also had limited stock)... People also seem to be getting tired of DIY projects- especially when they need to get back to finding a job or doing their job after the short Corona Holiday."
What an irrational and disgraceful sell-off! Idiots will lose all their long term positions trying to reenter lower.
P/E ratio is quite a bit lower here than Home Depot's was. This will pop up tomorrow on earnings. This is time to buy me some more for the long haul.
"Vistit a Lowe's , then go to Home Depot around the same time of the day. Home Depot has ten times the number of shoppers. The only way Lowe's can compete is to have lower prices, which they don't. It he new CEO decides to lower Lowe's prices, then they have lower earnings. This is a lose, lose scenario for Lowe's. Believe me, I am a value investor; Lowe's is not a value."
"And Lowe's make this announcement before earnings report tomorrow, trying to say bad numbers but look have a new CEO that will turn this around, they are covering themselves, pretty smart move etheir way."

BUYING 100K MOR ESHARES
What a hell just happen? AH

LOWS was smart to grab CRAFTMANS
I also bought some calls because now institutions buying so maybe we might run to 100 or a bit more
GOOD JOB GOOD JOB KEEP IT DOWN
PLEASE everyone SELL!!! So I can buy shares cheap..
Today LOW is UP... and volume is down.... if this stock wouLd be to reverse the downside move.. volume should be higher than those days when stock is been sold. Not good signs for up coming ER.
SHORTS BTFO
Dejavu of 2018. Last year HD and LOW had bad 1st quarter due to the longer Winter. it is March and we have a freezing temps in Midwest and 10 inches of snow on east coast.
Earnings before or after bell ?
HE HASNT DONE BUY BACK YET HOPE HE DOESNT
LOW is leading the pack in % gain of my 50+ stock portfolio today!..not too shabby..
"Why does corporate allow this.?When a individual turns in a time off request, management has 6 days to approve or not approve it.Why does management never follow this policy? They always try to stop vacations days before you leave, even when you turn in request 2-3 months before."

"Number is good, but market reacts mutely;;I don't like this kind of price reactions.Sell!"
The end of one year and the start of another gives us a good opportunity to review our investment successes and failures over the last 12 months. It also provides a platform to see where we're going and choose our investments for what's sure to be a raucous year in the market. Dividend stocks ...

"If you shorted in the 140s instead of backing up the truck like I did, you are homeless. Betting against HD, LOW, and SHW for the long haul during a booming real estate market is like sticking your hand down a running garbage disposal expecting it not to be a bloody mess. You will get burned...how badly I can't say but it will hurt big time. LOW HD and SHW are bullet proof during lockdown and during a fully functioning economy provided housing continues to do well. Beware of the danger signs shorts...they are not a laughing matter."
"weak people jumping out, until-they increase the dividend"
STAY LOW DONT GO UP THIS WONT GO UP PROMSE U GUYS WONT GO UP WONT GO UP WONT GO UP
"Worst store ever. No sales people, no bargains and no speedy checkout."
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 129.77
"Just look at this stock as a very LONG term investment. Get it and forget it. I have held this stock for about 12 or so years. My average initial investment is around $20 per share. I have dripped it ever since because the interest was way more than any savings account. So, really, my initial investment is pulling around 7% in dividends now. It has reached my goal for retirement amount and I still have approximately 15 years to go.... Get it, drip it, and forget it"
"Looks like LOW had a good quarter but guidance was slightly light, coming in at $84-$86 billion in sales projected for 2022 vs. the street’s estimated $89 billion. Either way this quarter was nothing to sneeze at. Fully expect this to reclaim $200 in the coming days to weeks. And no amount of thumbs downing is going to change my mind."
Look at the put options. Below $80/share was planned folks.
Will never buy anything from Lowes . Closing all my acounts from them. today will return 15k value of stuff and will re purchase it from Homedepot . worst company . lost 3k on this garbage truck
DSC rolling out snowblowers. I think its a little too early.
TOLD U ITS COMNG DOWN BE PATIENT DAMN IT
Went to blowe's this week end to get some pet safe rock salt all they had was one 5 gal bucket for $65 what a joke! Drove to the HD at the other end of town and they had a pallet full of 20 lb bags for $14. Guess who got my money. Blowe's sucks!
Like the stock but can't buy at the current pps. Need more of a margin of safety.
"Earnings Date May 19, 2021"

Lowe’s/Wells Fargo limiting employees to only investing 25% of there 401k in stock. How is this helping Lowe’s stock?
Does anybody hate LOW stocks in AH? Please sell to me at $161.94 Thanks in advance!
Why Crashing??? Were earnings that disappointing??
Just thinking about an article I'd seen awhile back about the possibility of Amazon buying LOW . IMO this would be a real win for all who are involved.
Great company and they know it. That is why they are inflating their prices. Buyer Beware!Doesn't help the economy when stores like this and Walmart are raping the wallets of the trusting customers!
This could be cup-and-handle breakout day. Maybe tomorrow. Prediction: $117 in a month.
Why is Lowe's missing out on today's rally?
Lowe's Companies is down 4.93% to 153.56
Lowe's Companies is down 4.95% to 160.25
THEY MAY PULL THAT AND PUSH IT UP SO ITS POSSIBLE
Nice going people!

"Well, At the very least we've learned Lowe's is a good company to invest in if you're worried a pandemic will destroy your portfolio."
This is heading back to the $70s Both Home Depot and AMZN are kicking Lowe's butt.
stay at home trades are over. this was as good as it got for lowes. sales will go back to normal when life goes back to normal. lowes going back to 100
I was up 100% just a couple weeks ago. Now I am in the high 70% ugh
$LOW Upgrades Gordon Haskett Buy USD 202
Heading back to the $60s where the k-mart of building supplies belongs.
May I know cause ko dropping?? It’s eps will be excellent but it’s dropping get trouble.
Terrible customer service experience in FL this week. Was going to buy a Craftsman drill from an end cap that advertised buy on get one tool clearly. Got the item to the register and didn't ring up as such. Got a manager involved and even the manager wasn't aware of the sale. The sign was clear and dated. They tried to tell me it was incorrect. I took a picture. I told them to keep the tools and I would go to Home Depot. Never shopping there again.
whats going on here. Is this profit taking for a little while before we go up?
"Who in their right mind would buy a stock with the symbol ""LOW""? Now that is a gasser friends. "
IT WILL DROP LIKE ROCK IN MINUTE
"Just bought and plan to hold for quite a while. I own some $HD as well, but I sort of like going with the higher growth company and one that can be a bit agile. I prefer Lowes personally to HD bc of the good lightening and friendly people. I think we are going to see a run up in real estate and investment in property and homes over the next 5 years, and I can't wait to buy more $lows. I also like a company that treats its employees right, bc tenured employees are happy employees, and happy employees create happy customers."
"The bullish outcome for lumber prices is if the Canadian and U.S. officials are able to reach a deal. If they do, the cost of lumber will fall dramatically. I think we get somewhere."

Low going to 100.
DONT COVER DONT BUY WAIT WAIT
THIS COMPANY WILL GO TO 130-150 AND HIGHER WATCH AND SEE
Earnings can't come soon enough for some positive news to get this thing rolling again...
"expensive, margin is very low, perhaps too much inventory on hand, fcf is pretty large also which can be used to reduce debt amount"
"Nothing but good news here. even if the company has moderate earnings, The outlook for outside investors is great. More people then ever, are investing in the stock market. economy Great Lowe's Great"
GOD LUCK SHORTS TOLD U EARLIER TO COVER DIDNT LISTEN
Buy when we dropQ1and q2 of 2019 will sky rocket because of pro business. Lowes will hit 120s or 130s by mid year. Then Marvin will split. The stock will go back to the 80s then he will fork over a ton of cash to rewire all the stores with a new pos. That will drop it to 60s. Buy again till its at 90s which it will stay for a long time floating around that price.
GO DOWN LIKE EARLIER MAN GO DOWN GO DOWN
How will this hurricane hitting the east coast affect share price?
"May look like a crazy thought-but is it possible AMZN could one day (sooner than later) acquire Lowes? AMZN is in everything including retail food. Why not Home improvement which includes a good number of products that are not easily shippable?Also, as we all know, AMZN is always looking for ways to 'get into the homes' (eg: Ring, Blink etc.).Makes sense to acquire Lowes (which is up and coming and modernized) and own the American home?"
REMEMBER THAT HE WONT GO ON SHOW HIS STOCK IN RED
What Does Lowes Sell A LOT OF ?TIMMMMMMMM BAHHHHHHHHHLOL
Green again.
D.E. Shaw recently stated that this stock should triple. That would be fantastic. Nice action today thus far.
UNDERVALUED!!
"Valuation is excessive for the current pandemic reality; however, a quality company."
LOW is down 8.73% to 101.40
Like I said before I don’t care what day it is the parking lot is nearly full. Safe bet here. ￼
"Just premarket, gonna blow out earnings. Going green today."
"I just sold all my shares this should go up 50% now, your welcome. I'll by back at $75 if it gets there..."
"LOW is coming into the buy zone again. Below FV now, looking at blended 5 yr. avrage. HD is about at FV now, esp. with FV earnings increase expected to be at a lower rate. I'm setting a buy price for more LOW now."
BUY HOME DEPOT THIS WILL GO DOWN LIKE EARLIER
"Lowe’s and Home Depot are packed everyday in Redding CA. Also went up to Oregon the other day, and it was busy too. Just saying...."
Thank you for the pull back. Cleaned up on call options last time. It’s like history repeating its self. Entry point 182 exit 230 .
"Earnings coming in two weeks. Will be interesting to watch. Another earnings miss and this stock could drop like a meteor. LOW could be the weakling among the big box outfits and if somebody's got to go, this may yet be the one."
all fundmanagers want to show that they have this stock in their portfolio at yearend. still some very strong ST upside.
Buy at will the cheap shares provided by AI algorithms!
"Consider: if you bought LOW shares 10 years ago, not even factoring in huge cap-app and a decade worth of increasing divs... you would be making a 11.5% dividend yield on cost!"
thought this would go up with the pending hurricane on east coast
"why is everyone buying before this thing peaks. When new case start dropping in numbers then buy. ,Market bottoms when virus cases past the high point and start dropping."
"Just hold it, Lowe's expects to buy back 3 billion $ in stock in the 4th quarter. It will rise again."
Holding HD since 2016 and I'm thinking of jumping to LOW over time> thoughts?Thanks.
BUY HOME DEPOT GUY DONT BUY DONT BUY
$85+ after earnings tomorrow...
That's gotta be the saddest dead cat bounce I've ever seen.
Just ordered new kitchen cabinets and appliances.
Placed a small order to add to Roth...
COVER COVER COVER
I don't typically buy stocks that drop down like this but the vaccine crash on Monday provided the golden opportunity to. Lowes is doing great.
"Lowes will let you return anything. I bet after this is over, some people will return the masks...."
Will Lowes follow HD and so many other stocks recently with great earningsand then dip in share price? Why not is the question?
employees are getting something which is fine however its a REAL SLIDING SCALE especially for the part timers.
All home builders selling off. Low should settle around that $165 level before heading back up.
Down -11.2% WOW ! buy the dip I guess
U NOT GOINGTO MAKE MUCH MORE HERE
Hey. Isn’t JCP in the crapper. Isn’t he the CEO that scrapped the coupons at JCP and in less than 6 months lost a huge amount of customers. We needed someone like Alan Mulally former Boeing and ford turn around man.
everything is fine. nothing to see here. keep buying.
"some big house is slingshotting this baby, illegal, sec price article/ordinance ..price manipulation"
What's with all these rah rah Home Depot posts? It's a hardware store not a football team. Is there some fantasy stock market challenge that you're all in? Get a grip!
Amy at Lowes (#2653) is awesome. She handled my order with perfection. Thank you Amy
Well let’s see if that dbag Ackman has another billion to burn to save Lowe’s on this quarter too. Lowe’s should have been around $80 if it wasn’t for that knucklehead investor.
DOW will close 700 point today mark this post.
What is with this conversation board? There is no rhyme or reason to the order of the posts. Why aren't they in chronological order?
"geez, I muted SF and cleared the board of this imbecile!"
Nothing drops in this fed induced bubble bubble market...At least for now !!
Up .001.....DSC sold one mop.
It will close at 88 or above.
poor Mattie boy ..karma I guess
"Lowe's will pass earnings and have a sales increase, because they are dirty, they will fire almost all of there employees, tell the remaining no overtime and if you go over 40 hrs you will get written up or fired, and shutdown almost all stores in a whole countries like they did in Mexico. They a dirty company to there employees, I worked there. I did not get fired, just say they didn't like it when I left."
Attention Lowe’sI’ll pay more for products made in the USA.I won’t pay anything for products made in China.
"READY, SET, BACK DOWN SHE GOES"
Maybe a $100.00 by Jan 1st
I PROIFT 1 MILLION TODAY THANKU LOWES FOR ALLOWING ME SHORT AT 123 AND COVER HERE

"Article title ""Recent Purchase: Lowe's"" May 27, 2019 11:37 AM ET Nicholas Ward from seeking alpah also agrees Lowes is a buy SAYs "" In short, unless a company’s business model has come under severe threat or they were ridiculously overvalued prior to the big downfall, I think it makes sense to step in and increase exposure during big sell-off events. You know what they say: long-term investors should be buying when there is blood in the streets. Well, I think Lowe’s (LOW) got a little bloody on Wednesday, which is why I initiated exposure to that stock at $95.77 when shares were down nearly 14%."
Look at the June 15th Put options....someone is building a large position.
DIP BUYERS CATCHING THE DISCOUNT ON THE JANUARY 2020 $110-$120 CALLS AS LOW PULLS BACK 
Truckload of good news. Even a buyback program. It's like they were holding back all the goodies!Congratulations longs!Buy with both hands at open!

Seem like someone is desperate to keep this around $ 95 to make most of the weekly options both calls and puts worthless for this week
Trump is doing a great job.

This is a one dark day for LOW....the ticker symbol is in sync with its performance :(
GPRO is sick now until next its 1Q to see a little improvement for its performance.Just make a short in the while for $low $9's
Good time to short this loser..

GO DOWN BABY GO DOWN GO DWON LIKE EARLIER
Should of bought more!!
all bad news done! buy now!
"BOYCOTT AMAZON. Amazon my not sell lumber, but it can sell a lot of things Low sells, so don't help them by buying ANYTHING FROM THEM. If you buy from Amazon, you are helping the enemy."
Up $5 pre-market nice!!
Told u isComing we are up wait and 
"It is stupid market today. Regardless unemployment rate and economy, people still needs to buy and repair their toilets and seal their windows.... I really don't understand why both HD and Lows drops 5% today while the premium mall (SPG) and Cruise line increased..."
This new CEO from JC Penny will drive Lowes to the ground like he did to JCP. He is really not that smart.
$125 by close tomorrow??? Wonder how many of those shorts got burned today...
Short-term pump due to a overweight rating from GS. Expect the sideway movement from $high 14- $low 16 until mid 2021.
Wells upgraded HD pps to 330 from 310. We should follow lower valuation higher growth rate smaller marketcap and gaining market plus a great CEO.
Hello SPRING!
ITS GOING TO GO DOWN IN FEW MIN WONT GET TO 121 WATCH AND SEE
Regarding some of the comments a day or three ago. I own both Lows and HD but I find the service at HD is like the service that Lows used to be. Lows was rated far above HD 5-7 years ago. Now it looks like the past full time lows employees must work for HD.
"just my opinion but i see a downturn after the public catches wind on the new policies . a firm in NC will take over all install , if the customer has a problem they will be directed to call center .we all love call centers right !"
DONT COVER IT WILL COME DOWN PROMIS EU
LOW is up 8.25% to 83.68
"Anyone decided to BOYCOTT AMAZON YET? Amazon won't sell lumber, but they will sell tools. The more you buy from Amazon, the more money they have."
Any investor in real estate see's the need for hurricane building materials. Fact damage occurred and repairs are necessary not an option to wait for. Trump has vested interest in Florida in Key Largo. Money tap will flow to help out residents. And they deserve it. Home improvement retailers whether Lowes or Home Depot will both do fine financially. Cost price match is available between them. Keeping prices low to help the victims of the hurricane is Lowes goal. And I am happy owning such a good company stock. Negativity on this board is from shorts that want the options to go lower. Invest in stocks that you think will earn returns that have good price to earnings structure. LOWES is one of them.
LOW was Karen's final trade on Fast money today
who thinks this goes lower tomorrow?
COVER FAST GOING TO 118
"Lowe's and Home Depot....The only game in town. i've owned a garage door company for 22 years and brought my Son in from Boeing quite a few years ago as a partner.Those out there that are looking for a job, go to work in the door business and learn a good trade and then go to work for yourself. It's and easy thing to do...."
"HD's fantastic quarter should be a warning for LOW bears. This stock is going to do well too. If you're not buying here at 160 you clearly don't get that LOW is at a discount here. This is a bear trap and suckers will pay the price. LOW has a history of stiffing shorts and rewarding longs, and that's not about to change. Every dip should be bought. This stock is not only COVID proof but does well in normal times too. Nothing to dislike here."
"The thing I love about Lowes is this is an obvious pair trade that will pay off 100%. Right now you had HD sell off and Lowes continued to ramp. Lowes was already extended in comparison to HD. HD is the much better company. Competition from Walmart and Amazon will continue to hurt Lowes and HD’s vastly superior efficiency $rev per store, move away from cashier and storage lockers will out perform. Lowes is dead in 10 years."
Lowe's is the new Disneyland packed with familys spending money.
This stock is done for the year no hope look at the trend going down. Covid spike is over
YES YES YES SHORTED AT 123 YE SYES
"I was in JC Penneys today, as a consumer, I see several problems. First is, they do not pay attention to their consumer base. Who do they think is going to buy a 312.00 small jewelry box, even on sale at 106,000? for junk made in China. If you want to work that price point, sell decent items! My friend took it back. Second, way way too much inventory for the amount of people who shop in the store. Third, most people do not buy appliances from JC Penney, --wrong item to have for sale. Need more niche and different items to attract millennials."
It will snap back. It’s just a knee jerk reaction. LOW is a way better investment then any airline or entertainment stock. LOW will do well in any environment. I say we close at least to $154
ANALYSTS SAY LOW PRICE TARGET $130
We will see mid 90’s today
"Allentown,Pa store packed everyday !One of the few good stocks left!"
lock step with HD. Yall a bunch of bitxjes.
"I just shorted $110,000 worth at 208. Come get it"
DHORTED HOPE GOES DOWN AT OPEN MORE MORE MOER
The repairs and rebuilding is starting up strong after the hurricane. Lots of materials needed. This will be good for Lowe's share price. Load up on any small dips now to realize the gains. GLTA!
The train back to 170 and beyond has left the building. Unless I'm horribly wrong the market has bottomed. Smart longs bought this dip. Shorts who didn't cover are watching their money evaporate. LOW has given very little to shorts since March and a lot to longs. LOW should hit $200 by the end of the year and you can bet I'm not getting off this train.
IF HE DOES HE A FOOL GOING ON CRAMER SHOW WITH HIS STOCK DOWN COME ON SHORTS THINK USE YOUR BRAIN
"Wish I can say I'm surprised, but based on recent LOW's shopping experiences, I'm not. I was hoping they might deliver solid earnings resulting in a short term pop at which point I planned to sell my shares (anything above $80). I've been in this for a long time, so my cost basis is in the $mid-teens$, so I can't be too upset. I'm not happy with LOW, but I'm also not willing to sell in the low $70's. I will hold for now, collect the dividend and hope things turn around a bit at which point I'll reassess. Fingers crossed and good luck longs."
hmmm....I wonder what is a good entry point....I've owned this at various times but thinking of reentering now...
we should see 1-2% tomorrow.
Is that even English 
"fascinating how many stocks I've seen for a while now be driven up PM, only to be dragged down trading hours. very fishy imo."
Bought another lot @153!Three buys in 1 day. :-)This is just way oversold with huge earnings report next week!
"I'd like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas! And to the DE's here, a happy Wiccan Solstice or atheist celebration, whichever applies. Remember you can invest at a discount in a wonderful company. Most importantly, as a part owner, you are essentially my employees, so please work hard in 2018- it's good for you and me!"
"Lordy, up almost 7% in 8 trading days, not too shabby. Good thing no one listens to the doom&gloomers, who bought high and sold low, or never bought . The instructions couldn't have been simpler- buy LOW low."
The last play I got from Awesome Stocks made me 46% in just a few days. They only alert nas and nyse so no OTC scams to worry about.
100 hit. Nice.
"That’s it, most profitable quarter in history getting booked today, earnings 8/19 will be record setting!!!!"
Bought today. at @70. I think Lowe's will still be busy on Saturday and Sunday afternoons 2-4 years from now. Stock who knows... but the business will survive. Hopefully stock rewards us.
"I decided that this is a good stock in the near term (next 2-3 years). Along with Low's the only other stock I have taken a position in is Five Below. Same reason Walmart CEO, 600 stores going to 2000. Targeting teen and preteen girls. Better economy more money to spend in both these kinds of Stores..."
Lumber liquidators up 143% for the year is there any justification for that? Lowes has flooring at or near their prices.. Major water damage to flooring in Texas for certain.
2 days before ER and this is all it does??? hmmm??
YOUR LONGS FOR SURE NOT HAPPY WTIH YOU ON EARNING DAY U GUYS LET THEIR SHARE DROP $8 ON THEM
Thumbs up if you think the earning tomorrow will beat.
IT WONT GO UP STAY DONW
I looked at the chart for 5 minutes again and some ohter stuff. I really think this has a great chance to bounce up 5% tomorrow. And who knows maybe more. I am very excited to see how wrong or rigth i am.
ONLY GREEDY WILL GET BURNT
"Technical indicators are positive, might retest the previous high 117"
Memphis stores are packed too.
HD execs are all smiles today!
Yahoo board full of what reads like disgruntled employees and short term traders= buying op...
"George w is dead on correct! fulltime knowledgeable staff gone and replaced by part time disinterested folks just waiting for their four hour shift to end. they know nothing about the products in the departments in which they are parked. employees who do try are running around dealing with chaos.... the whole system, from antique software on computers to the reckless mismanagement from corporate level to the store manager, is in a death spiral."
"We're about to hit triple digits, while the DE's whine and fidget.."
Credit Suisse favors LOW OVER HD. Raises target from $114 to $129. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/credit-suisse-now-favors-lowes-200017421.html
lets goooo Low need you today lol
The worst business I have ever seen. This is going to 60's
How many shares do you have?
this will go up with the market. whole market is in shumbles right now. Not worried at all
"ATTN: LOWES BOD More BS from Niblock after Q2 results. This guy actually ""thinks"" he's doing a great job. LOWES is better than this. WAKE UP BOD. ""Nuff said"" ."
Here comes the 3:30pm dinner bell
LOW and HD's lumber businesses are going to grow more profitable overtime. As the housing boom picks up more and more contractors will open up their checkbooks to buy the lumber up. I expect a huge increase in sales of that product over the next few years. That should more than be enough to override the increase in LOW and HD's COGS due to skyrocketing lumber costs.
"Oh no! Lowe's is hiring thousands of seasonal workers, as well as full and part time. Kayak you need to put the Gloom&Doom spin on this quick!"
"DSC back from ""the shore"". Stock up $1.39 !!!"
R5 Capital upgraded Lowe’s to buy from hold.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tuesdays-biggest-analyst-calls-nike-netflix-lowes-fedex-more.html
"Now, I need to cover it today as this is heading towards 80 :("
Buy HD today on the weakness. They are clearly killing LOW in that space.
"COVID is kinda over, this stock rocked during stay at home orders. But now situation is gonna turn around. Any suggestions to keep this stock or sell it??"
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 134.74
"The reversal upwards has been pretty amazing over the past 6-7 weeks (25% gain). That's rare for a slow moving stock like LOW. I'm long shares from the low teens, so I'm happy but admit the quick turnaround took me by surprise. Good to see in triple digits again. I hope it stays here this time. Good luck LOW longs..."
"On the fence about buying at some point. Went to Lowes yesterday, not sure where they get these people running the registers but good grief, reminded me of that video of the sloth at the DMV. Talk about slooow."
lowes should try and merge into Amazon while they still have a brand they can sell.
Only thing lowes got on home depot is store layout.
"Lowe's Companies, Inc. might have launched the Home Decor Curation sequence, which might expose a bold and achievable look, according to sources. This makes me happy!

People now have a habit of keeping up their homesMany have now found they can do their own workThis should really bump up the stock for the future
WATCH IT WILL FALL LIKE ROCK
Looks like big boys driving it down so they can buy your shares back.
I STILL GOT 200K SHARS SHOULD I COVER IT
LET ME LET IT COME DOWN THEN PULL TRIGGER ONE TWO THREE
"OMG, really? This is the best short I have seen in a very long time. HD is down and this #$%$ is up? lol, short and hang on for the ride down to mid to low $80's"
i panicked and sold yesterday. wouldve made some good profits of lows
HD vs. LOW ? I am contemplating on HD .Only rational comment please.
;LONGS STOP SELLING WE DOING COVERING
Why does everyone have a hard on to replace the CEO???
"AMZN is going to put both LOW and HD out of business, or at least turn them into lumber liquidators."
AT 3PM IT WILL BE RUSH RUSH RUSH
Are they going to buy lumber liquidators?
"Closing Orchard Supply Hardware will not solve any of your problems. It has not been run correctly since you bought it with the product mix and advertising. I can put a group of investors together from Silicon Valley that will buy it or just come in and resurrect it, maybe it is best that you guys just shut the thing down."
Guess: some shorts are covering... and smart ones are just shorting.
"I have never worked for Lowes, but I do own a lot of the stock in my Roth IRA !"
how much u down today mattie
"I think it's rather nifty, today we may break $150..... then on Wednesday, another div payday! Not too shabby..."
EVERYONE WILL POUR IN AND WILL MAKE THIS GO EVEN HIGHER HIGHER
Hope LOW will trend up on the coat tail of HD. Looking for retail to do well. LOW store in Memphis always busy.
I M COVERING ANOTHER 10K SHARES
Lowe's Companies is down 4.90% to 160.26
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/22/lowes-names-jc-penney-ceo-marvin-ellison-as-its-new-ceo.html
le after downgrade BUT storms and other reason . Down grade was not even ffrom a buy but HOLD rating dumb and dumber
I was at my local store here in Northern Va and couldnt believe how many people were shopping. It was like a grocery store the night before a blizzard. With more and more people working from home in the future this stock is a strong buy. Will be adding more on any pullback.
12 months from now their will be 2 kinds of people. People that bought lows in june 2020 with every broker on earth recommending it at 134. And of course their will be people who looked the other way but either way this baby will be 180 to 200 september of 2021.stay tuned.
THEY STUPID THEY COVERING BECAUSE THEY SHORTED AT 121 DUMMIES
"Added a few, limit order @162. With FY2020 OE of 8.82, P/E of 18.5 is below 5yr. blended avg. of 19.23. A return to avg. P/E (FV) for EOFY2021, would be >$190."
"so no stock split ,no dividend increase, no increase in 401 matches, no tax money to employees just a buyback less shares on the market driving price up but earnings and growth should be doing that"
IM BUYING SHARES OF LOWES AS THEY DROP ANY WEAKNESS IM BUYING MORE SHARES.
Jim Cramer just mentioned LOW
where is Joe?
GET IT INTO GREEN IF U WANT TO LOOK GOOD AS A CEO
"what a depressing performance after HD had great earnings....if HD""s earnings were so great and they tanked...what does LOW do? And don't tell me it goes to 170 by Friday!"
LOW is up 5.16% to 94.56
Shorted this one. Had too many 52-week highs in a row.
LOWES NEED TO DO STOCK SPLIT
SHORT AND GO BUY HOME DEPOT
Bought more low and add hd. Finger crossed
their still selling. wow home depot too. sector move to banks and financials from consumer disc
shorting more
lowes is covid proof
I SEE HIM SIT BEHIND HIS DESK AND SQUEEZE US SHORTS BEFORE
Investors in $LOW must be excited about the 79.7% EPS growth estimate in 3 years: https://simplywall.st/NYSE:LOW/lowes-companies
"Lowe’s: IS A BUY Despite Analysts Giving Lower Target Prices after Its Q1 EarningsWRITTEN BY RALPH NATHAN says this ""Despite the lower-than-expected first-quarter EPS, analysts continue to favor a “buy” rating for Lowe’s. Among the 32 analysts that are covering Lowe’s, 68.8% recommended a “buy,” while 31.2% recommended a “hold.” None of the analysts recommended a “sell.” On average, analysts have given Lowe’s a 12-month target price of $114.21, which represents an upside potential of 19.8% from its stock price of $95.37 on May 24."""
LOWES BUYING SHARES FAST AS THEY CAN AND SHORTS ARE COVERING BEHIND THEM
HE BE WITH CRAMER LATER TONIGHT
LOW is down 6.04% to $85.83
HE BE A FOOL A MORON IF HE DOES
"dsc20601 • Dec 12, 2009 5:44 PM Why cant LOW give a 1% wage increase.. The economy was in dire straights in 2009. Anybody in the construction industry was grateful to have a job except dsc. dsc20601 • Dec 12, 2009 5:44 PM Why cant LOW give a 1% wage increase.Why cant LOW give its employees at least a 1% cost of living increase...?"
"3:12 PM. here it comes, end of day sell off..."
LOW is down 7.82% to 66.91
IM COVERING AS FAST ASI CAN
This may find support in the $70s. Competition is proving too much for Lowes. HD and Amazon are eating Lowe's lunch!
Good ER Would've come at 7:30￼
"WAITED 5 WEEKS TO GET STOVE. NO ONE CARES, ALWAYS A NEW PERSON PASS THE BUCK. ORDER FROM APPLIANCE STORE NEXT TIME. SAME WAY WITH CARPET. HOME DEPOT JUST AS BAD. SHOP LOCAL APPLIANCE 5% more but truthful less time. had to hook own stove drivers did not know how"
"Guessing Steve - who is obviously short and trying to stir up fear - is saying that limiting the deduction on property taxes for homeowners will negatively impact home ownership... and therefore HD and Lowe's stock prices. Obviously, this creates uncertainty, but seems like a stretch. 10K of property taxes remain deductible, as does interest on new mortgages up to 500K. Also if home ownership shifts to investors, they will still need to maintain properties. If stocks keep dropping, it will soon present a buying opportunity."
Like I said shorts covering and Lowes doing great. Back for more great stock buys today. Congratulations longs. fundamental asset improvement company for number one USA asset the home.
Shorts are attacking this stock. If you're long put in a limit sell order @ 300 to stop the shorts from borrowing ur shares and driving the price lower.
"my my, we might reach ninety before Christmas nighty. Despite the DE grinches. I guess they'll be hollering its going to fall back in the 80's."
Nobody here has mentioned the possibility of Lowes buying bbby to get the foothold on furniture and wall to wall decor
"Great job Lowes-- Garden to go kits starts today, sign up on the website: Error message:Something Went WrongAn error occurred and your request couldn't be completed.Try refreshing your page or searching again.RETURN HOME"
"Typical Lowe's, Bad numbers and the stock drops. Good numbers and the stock drops!"
Getting slapped back to the $60-$70s where this garbage belongs.
"In case anyone from Lowe's browses the comment section, I would like them to improve their website. I shop Lowe's over its competitor but confess that I often, no, almost always use the competitor's website to search for the products I need, then hop over to Lowe's website to finish the research. It's because the other website is organized better. This will improve business. Hope they pay attention to this because I'm not alone"
Algo's kicking in for the Santa rally! Let's hope this continues.
Wow! The new JCP CEO is already having his negative impact... you guys are in for a lot more pain with him at the helm!
SELL BUY HOME DEPOT NOW
Sell this trash==
buy best inc. before earnings.. going to explode
$156.90. Incredible buying opportunity imho. Crazy meltdown.
$86 to $73? Ouch! 
out of LOW - not too happy this morning with this choice - JCP has not been setting the world on fire. GLTA
Lowe's Companies reached an all time high at 139.64
LOW is up 5.03% to 119.10
will fall end of day for long weekend. Big profit taking. Glad I bought more yesterday GLTA
"fingers crossed, maybe see 170 by Friday? not sure if earrings already coincides with current SP?"
FUCK FUCK
Buying only on virus hype cure. Its every day just to take markets up. They fall for it. Going on weeks of this to just take markets up. HOw about reality will be long time coming.
Buyers are losing momentum for sure. Friday was the Doji that signaled the peak.
"The sub-$95 buy window is closing folks, just like a Reliabilt double pane low-e glass, argon filled vinyl clad stormer. Up scope..."
"It's strange that the message board is filled with negative comments, yet LOW will have record revenue and earnings this year (yet again). Free cash flow at all-time high. Share count reduced by 44% over the past decade. Increased dividend for the 55th consecutive year. But yeah, go ahead and focus on the negatives./"
I think Lowe’s will be a beat. Especially after upgrade to $130
it's up now.
I own the domain name: lowespickup.comYou would think Lowes would be interested in getting this domain. You know...good customer service. Lol. I've offered it to them with no answer. lol
HILLARY #$%$-ON IS FULL-O#$%$
"There will not be an infrastructure bill passed anytime soon. We are out of money because Congress gave away too much money to people who are employed. Now we have to raise taxes to raise funds, which takes money out of the back end, and no Republicans will support a tax raise, and a few Democrats will cross the aisle."
"How can LOW know when its a birthdayBut not know when someones review is up for several years.How can you guys know at morning meetings when its someones birthday, but not know when a yearly review is, even after a dozen reminders..?"
Need massive sell off here. Get markets back to reality. Daily huge swings day traders etc. Daily news for virus treatments to pump up markets fro weeks here and there. I say enough already. TV business channels pump it up etc.
Where's the peanut gallery? took the day off?
Shorts are jumping in now nice
After earnins LOW will be sitting around $180
Cup and Handle?
Easily over 200 and very soon imo.
"$200 a share basically here. Almost time to pop the cork on the champaigne longs, my buy from last March looks absolutely incredible. And according to my valuation models there is still more room to run for this name, and of course the incredibly ripe conditions for growth when it comes to real estate only sweeten the future. Retail building supply stocks are going to roar higher over the next year."
It seems everyone on here is dogging LOW. If you are not happy with there performance sell or SHUT UP!

I own. several hundreds shares having worked there and participating in the program 2010-2013. I no longer participate in the daily stupidity of working there (contractor sales) but I really enjoy my shares purchased in the 20-30 dollar range now worth so much more.
IM NOT COVERIGN TILL GOES TO 119 SHORTING MORE
This is heading much higher folks. Ignore the nonstop bashers that are trying to get you to sell your shares.
"I'm In it 2 Win it! Looking for a Split, soon!"
"Marvin Ellison is THE WORST CEO ever. He is running LOW into the ground. Stores are dirty, not enough Associates, inventory is non existent, what a shame....bye, bye LOW"
Lowes should not give its employees set hours unless it benefits the store.Employees should work the needs of the store.
Buying more..
"I don't know how much Osh contributes to Lowes but a few months ago they had some stupid idea to not have any sales flyers. NONE in the paper, store or online. They also started having the WORST sales on paint (now no sales because no ads). Sherwin Williams has paint coupons, Lowes and HD both put paint on sale and Osh gets once in a while $5 off a gallon sale. When we bought our house we painted it with BM from Osh. We did it ourselves so we bought a few gallons per sale and also bought other stuff at the same time.But NOW no sales, so we don't go to Osh. We go to HD.Brilliant move Osh (Owned by Lowes). We've spent a LOT of money on our 3900 sq foot house on wood, molding, caulk, appliances, plants, landscaping materials, pots, electrical, etc."
"I believe the SP will move up at least 8%, due to earnings and domestic sales unaffected by corona virus guidance."
"""cleaning up "" on mop sales."
NO SHARES TO SELL WILL MAKE SHORTS COVER HIGHER PRICE
thinking to buy LOW.. but is trading below some critical SMA. unless price reach those levels I am on the watch ...Sell when everyone is buying and buy when everyone is selling..
anyone adding at these levels?...I am thinking of adding to my position...thoughts?
"When the media learns that Lowe's is no longer honoring the 10% Military discount, expect a lot of noise. In true Lowe's fashion, they pretend as though they're not doing it. Even though it says 10% right on the counter, Lowe's is charging a ""minimum retail price"" as though it's a Soviet store and the committee has set the prices.The minimum retail price seems to allow a 5% discount. Who knows where it applies?A very cowardly way to try and make some money. If you're doing it, and you are, then own it."
IM ALL COVERED NOW AND SAFE NOW THANK LORD I MADE MY MONEY THANKS TO LOWES FOR GOOD PROFIT TODAY
Almost a good entry point...
HERE IT GOES GUYS ONE TWO THREE JUMP
You can all thank me. I went to work for Lowes partime 2-2-13. Its doubled now.

BUY HOME DEPOT GUYS NOW NOW LISTEEN TO ME
"Earnings would be 49 cents rather than 80 cents if the tax rate was not lowered.""The company’s EPS grew 8.1% YoY (year-over-year). The EPS growth was driven by revenue growth, the lower effective tax rate, and share repurchases. The growth was partially offset by a decline in the EBIT margin. For the fourth quarter, the company’s effective tax rate was 24.3%—compared to 39.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017.""LOW management claims will earn $6 per share next year--not likely. Expects to buy back $6B is stock--with what cash (only a half billion on the balance sheet). Fishy.""For 2019, Lowe’s management expects its diluted EPS to be $6.00–$6.10. The company’s management expects to repurchase shares worth $6 billion–$7.5 billion in 2019."""
"You have a chance to lock in your sale near the all-time high.You really should visit a store to see inventory, sales in progress and ask a question or two.If you hold the stock, you deserve what you get."
HMG when did Lowe's ever hit 200?
Good buying opportunity in my opinion. Will be back over $170 here pretty soon. And up from there. GLTA!

WATCH THIS NEXT HOUR ITS GOING TO BE UGLY
Four times this month tried to order sales item. They took order online only to have store call me to say item not available. Bait and switch company!
Lowe's bears don't get it. There's nothing to be bearish on. This company is COVID proof and thrives regardless of how the economy is doing. Demand for their products is inelastic which means people have to buy them no matter what. Same with Home Depot. Shorts will get murdered betting against these two companies. It hasn't paid to be short since March. Lowe's makes new highs almost daily. It's chart is something out of a dream. Long now and probably for a very long time.
205 by april 15th 2021.better hop on the train
"I commanded LOW to decrease, overpriced at these levels. RIDICULOUS"
"The treasury currently yields 1.64 percent not factoring in today's movements. Ok...now let's assume that the treasury rises to 2.20%, and let's assume an equity risk premium of 3.05%. That implies 50 percent upside from here, or a price target of $296.24 for LOW. So this stock despite the massive run it's had assuming those parameters is still undervalued here. HD on the other hand assuming these parameters actually trades at a premium. LOW is growing free cash flow and earnings much faster than HD too. And the soil for both companies is extremely fertile with the coming boom in housing construction and the massive amount of home improvement projects taking place...contractors will buying up HD and LOW's lumber and tools by the truckloads as well as many more of their products. I own both LOW and HD but I have ceased adding to HD...I continue to buy LOW here. The best days are still yet to come."
GOLDMAN UPGRADES TO $135!
lowes just turned into the big short of the day. Hope it recovers
PART TIME PARTY TIME SHORT SHORT MAKE LOTS OF $$$$$
I am holding...
Why a bigger hit than HD? ? ?
Back to my earlier comment ... who waits until the day the stock no longer pays a dividend and then buys it? Up today when I would expect it to go down. Why not have bought yesterday?It's maddening to me but there must be some logical reason ... I just can't think of it (-:Come on people ... help a brother out!
Robots are busy. Same article on HD vs. Lowes posted in 3 out of 4 posts.
"Lumber prices are through the roof. $24 for a 7/16, 4x8 sheet of OSB. This will dry up sales in a heartbeat."

Buying opportunity! This dip is just a buying opportunity while it's down a little. Now is the time to buy to realize great gains when this rebounds soon which it will in my opinion. GLTA!
I BE SURPRISE IF IT GETS BACKT O ITS HIGHS
Home depot new hour of business 6am 6pm. Lowe's can take advantage and open later time. more customers. house always need repair.
Hey guys & fellow shorts. i did my part. Never bothered repaying 80k on my Lowe's credit card. Love to see them losing $))
IM SO GLAD I COVERED MY SHARES
Lowe’s could use some fluff piece press released
20 MIN TO COVER BETTER COVER FAST
"Lowe's and Home Depot shares prices will hit $100 and $200, respectively, in the next 1-2 months due to MASSIVE reconstruction of Texas and Florida from HUGE damages caused by hurricanes Harvey and Irma."
"Investor day worked out!If you blow these, then don't have investor days."
Oh boy. Ackman kiss of death. Time to head for higher ground...
"All my stocks with bad news are up, today and all my stocks with good news are down. This market is crazy and unpredictable. It's very difficult for a rational person to make money."
110 hit. Going higher folks. Lots of bashers here. Stay long.
The trend will be up for several years to come.
"I'm a new buyer of this company Will some knowledgeable person tell me why it goes down every day when the rest of the market goes up ? Is there something wrong here , Oversold?"
SHORTS COVER COVER TAKE PROFIT BEFORE LOWES DOES IT FOR U
LOW way overvalued
"Judging from my store this seems to be a good short. 1) Employees leaving. We lost 5 key people in a week. People are overworked and other co's are offering more $$$. 2) Inventory is comical. The stores sre filled with #$%$ that will nerver sell, especially tile. 3) Equipment and buildings are falling apart. Our building leaks like a sieve when it rains. It took 10 days just to get approval to FIX the cardboard bailer. All of our lift equipment is old and the batteries are almost dead. 4) New people are worthless. Sorry, but you can't replace an electrician with a 20 year old cashier. 5) We can't ship. Shipping manager quit for a better opportunity. We can't keep overnight people. pallets look like the trucks flipped over on the way in. Tile smahed, boxes crushed. Again, the company won't pay people and they overwork those that remain."
"Curious to know. I own 350 shares of HD and add any time there is any dip, would it be stupid to buy LOW or better to just keep adding to HD?"
DOWNWARD SHOOT DOWN ABOUT TO COME HERE IT GOES GUYS IT ABOUT SHOOT DOWN
Lowes is a cyclical stock. right now it's an oversold territory. Market is consolidating. first quarter it's always a week for Lowes and Home Depot. Expect strong second quarter and third quarter and the price above $100 on Lowes and above 200 on Home Depot. house market it's still a very strong starter homes are hard to find and people will maintain their houses
I'm sure the BOD are getting theirs
Lowe's dividend goes to.48 cents per share starting in august!
Where did Kayak go?
Price drop coming
"HD and Lows have unique models which amazon can't create. When people's toilet and pipe are leaking, they have to go to one of these two stores for repair right away instead of waiting shipments from Amazon. I own both HD and Lows. It is very impressive that both of them had the same stock growth rate since April these years. Now both of them are not moving. Hope their prices can go up after earnings date"
"i shorted the stock. lowes is a company with one of the worst customer service. many have posted here and i myself have hirrible experience.. trustpilot whichnis one of the best rating site had 1.5 out of 5... and if you google the rating, you will find out"
LOW reached an all time high at 124.44
"It's really quite simple. This was $82 in April. That was a low. Now it's $115 in September. That's a high. Buy low, sell high."
Lowe's Companies is down 4.92% to 195.24
IT WONT SEE 120 OR 121 EVEN TODAY O=I PROMISE U UNLESS WE COVER
"Over the holiday weekend, lots of football TV and I must have seen 30 Home Depot adds and zero Lowes adds."
tried to tell you people
What a horrible stock this is.
JPM cut forecast for cuts $HD and $LOW. Earnings will go up and stocks will still go up due to share buybacks.
nice
"Lowe?s refuses to give me my money back even with a receipt! They should be ashamed of themselves. Now I know why Menards is kicking there #$%$ The Manager at the Illinois store was unhelpful, very hands off. I asked for the district manager contact and they gave me a 1800 number they doesn?t work. I will never go there again!!!!"

"How the Orchard closing will play out. Orchard employees will get first chance at open jobs at Lowes but they will fired in short order for trying to help customers find what they are looking for. As we all know,that is not allowed at Lowes. Ace hardware,,,,Here I come !"
"Lowes & HD both ignored humanity and covid for lies for profits & sales, and kept business going, though States,like mine here in NC, declared ONLY essential business contractors out there- and Lowes & HD kept selling to anyone, with no social distancing concerns for nearly 3 months, and now we are seeing covid numbers climbing here.. They both knew malls were closed and every restaurant, etc, so gamed the entire economy playing a very dangerous game with human lives !! BE careful as all of this was built on nothing but Greed from Elision and HD's CEO..."
"So, I went to my local Lowe's yesterday. They had a 250 person limit in the store, with a long line waiting to get in. The parking lot was more full than any supermarket. Man, if you didn't add to LOW and HD when they hit 3+% div yield... you=DE or Mason jar investor..."
Black friday sale items were garbage. My visit today I saw very low traffic and I walked out with a $10 purchase...... very disapointed
Can someone explain why Lowe’s is down while it is still open?
I DONT THINK ITS COMINGDOWN ANYMORE TIME TO COVER I GUESS REST
Lowe’s selling craftsman is big moveNew ceo is making money moves $
940 shares sold I will buy back way cheaper
"A lot of shorts have been saying I'm stupid for my comments about there being a shortage of lumber right now due to production being curtailed due to COVID. Here is the take of a professional economist who knows far more than the average LOW bear on here. LOW isn't powerless over the lumber costs...they simply will raise retail prices to compensate for the higher COGS. Production coming back will dramatically increase lumber supply, bringing prices down. https://theconversation.com/american-timber-industry-crippled-by-double-whammy-of-trade-war-and-covid-19-147720"
"Looking at the 5 year chart of Lowes. Septermber 21, 2012 Lowes was $30.19 since then day after day, month after month for 5 years Lowes has increased in value to now$78.46. That in market terms is a ""SUCCESS"" story. Over 100% return in 5 years is fantastic. Nothing to be critical of. HD has a different story and is fine in its own right. My observation is that Lowes hasn't disappointed investors in its stock. And the corporate earnings are facts. And facts don't lie. Long term continual growth. Not at risk of failure. These analysts remarks speaks volumes. Average analyst price target $86. in a year. Elizabeth Lane SuzukiMerrill LynchBuy09/05/17 $95.00 2.40% 100% ArticleReadArticlePeter BenedictRobert W.

"Due to my experience with LOWS and in this board, I think it is time to short this one."
A lot of buzz going around. Supposedly they've been making record setting sales numbers since the pandemic began.
buy LOW sell high
relax the bottom is 76...chart it out 1 yeat
Big manipulation do not sell
Next stop is the $60s
I sold all my calls Tuesday for a nice 150% gain. Stupid stupid stupid! Woulda made 3 times as much selling today. Congrats to the HODLers.
"When comparing which stock I'd rather own, LOW or HD...the answer is obvious when looking at several things. HD is better for income, but on a yearly chart LOW has dramatically outperformed HD, and has an earnings growth rate over the next 5 years of 24% vs. HD's 9.71 percent. For capital returns LOW is the obvious winner. Plus the fact they had a 152.5% return on equity in 2020 is huge...however I suspect that number will fall back to around 50 percent upon reopening, which is still not too shabby at all. Both have better inventory turnovers than the industry median. LOW has dramatically outperformed the S&P, while HD is line with it. So while I own both, if it came to a new investment and could only choose 1 of those companies it would easily be LOW no contest."
"As the economy reopens and the housing construction boom takes off due to the fact the lumber shortage will resolve itself and prices will come down, I expect an acceleration in LOW's revenue and an increase in inventory turnover. There is pent up demand for all of LOW's products, not just lumber. Especially single family housing units will be constructed like crazy once the economy fully opens back up...tools, lumber, pesticides, lawn care, gardening, etc. will all be in high demand. LOW, HD, and SHW will all see massive P/E multiple expansion in the coming years, although there will certainly be a slowdown in demand once supply of houses meets demand. But for the next several years all 3 of these names should be solid investments. I invested in SHW in the $200s pre stock split, LOW last March in the upper 60s, and HD last March as well. My portfolio thanks me now, and it will continue to thank me in the future. You are still getting bargains in these 3 names even at these prices."
Getting SLAPPED down to the $70s the smart money is waiting for the $72

"Called the local Lowe's to find out when my materials would be delivered. Was transferred to Deliveries 10 times. 10 times nobody answered. Called the operator and asked for the Pro Desk. Same story: transferred 10 times, 10 times nobody answered. I guess firing all those employees to same money is really helping. Helping as in driving customers to shop at their competitors."
RUN RUN RUN RUN SHORTS LETS RUN WE COULD SHORT HIGHER PRICE
I WANT MAKE LONGS HAPPY SOME WHAT SO THEY STAY IN
This stock should be on $130 minimum
100% of stores hot their sales goal
Lowes Raised dividends 9%!!
Probably shorting by MM’s.
I told you they were going to suck! That is just the beginning for blowes
IT WONT GET UP THERE PROMSIE U I WILLL SHORT IT
"Almost an entire aisle of pressure treated wood is empty at the local Lowes, and 2 nearby ones recently.Hopefully its just pent up demand, and not a supply issue. Hope they start ordering more. Feel sorry for contractors who have jobs on hold, and can't work and make money for their family."
Economy is going to fall with Retail leading the correction.
This is what Lowe's gets for backing trump! Down she goes!
Back over 90. Looks like some folks are using today as a buying opportunity. Good luck to all longs. I stand by my previous comment that was down voted that Lowe’s has to do something to lure away from HD some of their loyal customers to increase their market share.
"Bought some at $160, looking good for both short and long term"
I JUST SHOTED 10K SHARE LOL HELL YEAH
Not even 1% of market cap has tradedThat tells me that big players are staying out.Pretty much shorts and hedge funds manipulation of retail investors.
WHEN EVERYONE START RUSHING INTO WATCH WHAT HAPPENS
Where's the 10k increments you coked out bafoon
Don't be so happy because you just got Marvin. You will rue this day real soon.
"Man, good bye lowes, your sinking deeper and deeper."
Dow's going positive today and this stock will be $90 soon.
"LOW is right below Peter Lynch formula fv price for fast growing cos., with 5yr. blended P/E 20.31, of $180. A LOW actual 5yr. blended P/E fv price is $186 for EOFY21... For EOFY22, with est. 11% E growth, Lynch FV is ~$199, at LOW actual P/E avg. fv is ~$206."
wow will close $87 today!
DAMN CEO CANT KEEP THE DAMN THING UP HE DUM
Wake up People. Vaccine is here and people will be coming out of their homes next year more and more. As for the price coming down it is good for the long run and should be a good entry point for anyone interested to be a long holder of this blue chip stock. Not time to panic but to add more in my humble opinion.
"LOW problems stem from basic corporate move enacted a few years ago.... Managers can pocket large bonus's based on labor reduction costs over the year+ bonus checks. Unfortunately that leads to fewer full time and more & more part time don't give a #$%$ employees. My wife has been there 11 years. Just last week, Corporate showed up for a ""surprise"" inspection. 3 departments were at lunch at the same time, leaving 3 to cover for 8....no permission from heads...they just left. They also heard an employee tell a customer ""sorry I can't help you, that's not my job"" walk off and leave. Customer left store. [employee fired on spot] Manager {after 24 yrs of service, no longer employed]....All this is corporate overreaction. The manger has always been on the floor hands on guy. This type of policy is ruining the Lowes brand. used to be go to electrical dept, someone with experience[retired electrician] waited on you , same for most dept's. Now just a bunch of wage collecting hooligans.Lower needs to get back to basics. They still lead in appliances and elect fixtures. It's just been going downhill since some corporate moron decided to steer the ship in a ""progressive"" direction.Builders and remodelers want quick dependable service and knowledgeable employees, if the don't find that...they will go elsewhere."
"I confirm those of you that are saying almost sure thing for Lowes to outperform. My brother-in-law is manager of the Springfield, MO branch and he says their store alone is at all-time annual selling profits to date since 2006."
"The local Lowes has announced a 20% restocking fee for all returned special order merchandise. Is this true for all stores? If so, that is not in line with trying to attract the pros. Pros know that when purchasing material for a job, you get 10% more than your estimate to allow for waste. For material like flooring which is often ordered, it's a slap in the face."
wow! guess folks tired of this  tortoise.
"The upside potential for LOW just got a whole lot more interesting. Yo you should really check out aw-esomeSTOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
"Wish I bought more this morning, damn"
$1.41 compared to $1.35/share
HD and LOW are to home improvement what Visa and MC are to credit. Own both and charge on > >....
How is this price so low? Based on avg FCF valuation alone they are currently undervalued. They have enough assets to clear all liabilities and then some. This is a great buy.
"I went to Lowes to buy a washer and dryer, could not get help so went to Home Depot. I went to Lowes for a real Christmas tree, they all looked dead."
why is it dropping? any ideas? thoughts?
"Shouldn’t be where it’s at. Jumped due to closing a chain of stores they bought, their Lowes stores performance was absolutely weak. No one deserves a gain on this $hit stock."
Climbing up!
"There's just something nice about seeing a holding go above another $10 threshold. My unsubstantiated theory is that $90 stocks don't stay that way for long; they tend to make a quick move upwards to $100. I know it's a stupid theory, but so what. Best of luck LOW longs...BTW... I'm very glad I decided to hold all my shares after considering selling a portion of my position this past summer. I've owned my shares for 10 years + and just couldn't bring myself to part with them. I still love my other consumer related holdings as well, including AAPL, DIS, MA, SBUX, TGT, TSCO, V and yes AMZN. 2018 might be a bit more difficult and tough decisions to come...."

Lowes recovering fast. Why? Value company that is making money.
lowes are starting to close some stores no real cashiers anymore not good
yowza... LOW is leading the pack of my 52 companies IRA ports today... not too shabby! go LOW !
"It looks like CEO have no ability to manage multiple hundreds of stores , his only ability is to shut them down and claim that he is saving the Company. HD should be the ones shutting down stores. and they are not. If we have a booming economy as Wall Street has been telling us then why close stores when we are booming? This doesn't make sense or the truth is coming out that the economy is not what it is being said about it booming. Reality is coming and it would be too late when Trump and Wall Street set up this great nation for a recession or depression. This time it would be America alone and no nation would come to save the global economies. Trade wars ends up in death."
Good time to open a new position
"What a huge disappointment on what is happening to Lowes stock when parking lot is like the circus just arrived. Hard to figure out this market. Home building is on the rise, also."
Keybanc
Sold all my shares from $79..
LOWES U THINK U CAN BRING THIS TO 121 I DONT THINK SO
"@ john sthere is no trade war with china any longer.. Trump stopped all that caca when covid arrived. things with china are as they were before covid. He will get back on their a$% if and when we get rid of covid. Which, covid, is causing some supply issues without a doubt.there is no 2nd wave of covid because the ""1st wave"" never ended, we merely slowed it by stay at home orders. 1st ""wave"", if thats what you wanna call, it is still going...lowes and HD may ""now"" be experiencing material/supply issues, but they were not when stay at home orders were first issued in March. By April is when people started getting bored at home and doin home repair projects.April and May are in this 2nd quarter.. so i beleive 2nd quarter will be very good. 3rd qtr......idk!!!i own an A/C and heat co in Houston area, been to Lowes and HD on the weekly... have not seen empty shelves or not been able to get what we need for our business.. Again, that may change soon, but it didnt affect 2nd qtr.as a business owner, i go back to my statement about the ""bonuses"" to lowes employees... Businesses dont give away bonuses / profit unless making GOOD PROFIT."
Stock is back to summer price now. I go in there 3 or 4 times a week due to my job. I actually go to 2 different ones. They are always busy. I don't see any difference or drop off. So not sure why it has pulled back so much.
this pos only pays Dividend (Yield)1.92 (1.77% ) ? Doesn't even cover the inflation lol
LOW is down 11.91% to 85.00
Just rounded out a lot @ 94.45. This will be a long term yowza..
bottom is 74...if you chart it out 1 yr
"Ben, posting his thoughts daily, show that he hasn't been to a Lowe's store in years.Please post every day so the pain hurts more.What hurricane damage? What projects? There isn't anything on the shelves."
"Stop running your stores like K-Mart, get rid of you buyers, put your contractors first. Put things on the shelves builders want not grandma !"
"Dividend grower, yep, solid...."
Any thoughts about a stock split?
"Looking at the up channel, we are much closer to the bottom of the channel than to the top. If history repeats itself like the last two ERs, we should pop to the top of the channel tomorrow open. That should be around $low $34, $34.50-ish.GLTA and hope there was no aapl pushouts in Q3. Aapl pushout, we will get an even wilder ride."
It's so hard to determine a bottom considering the virus is NOT going away and will have a second big wave starting in late summer or early fall and will be with us until a vaccine is hopefully developed. So it's really hard to believe we are close to a bottom at these prices.
Sold at 87.71. Enough of this woofer.
"will fall to 80 , even if earnings were good"
"yep, i'm thinkin 156/ 157 ginna be price til earnings. anyone think different?"
"Advice to ManagementIt is absolutely ridiculous how much stuff is returned.Cutomers want something from topstock, you get a ladder & get it down, and 2hours later they return it. Anyone that works at a store,knows what a HUGE problem this is! Please have a 1% restock fee. Please address this problem. They use generators, shovels , tools, xmas trees, etc and return probably about 25% of everything! Don't let us become Hechingers Jr."
"BOYCOTTING AMAZON, yet? if not, you are hurting lowes."
I added yesterday so it’s nice seeing it up $3. Does anyone think we can hit $200 by end of 2021?
"I’ve been remodeling my home with Lowe’s. The reason I’m writing is I have seen many posts on lack of help. I’ve always received help when needed. I’ve been in several departments such as kitchen, baths, flooring , lumber, plumbing, and paint. If I’ve waited it was in line as the help was serving others ahead of me. I see several cashiers, and usually 4 at the service desk. I see a well stocked with inventory, clean lanes and friendly staff willing to load my truck each time."
Selling off after good reports seems to be the theme of today's illogical market
"I've been shopping at Osh (owned by Lowes) since I bought my house. We were going there because we used Benjamin Moore paint for our interior. We bought the last of it a few weeks ago (got a discount thru employee friend). During that time when Lowes would have other things we needed (liquid nails, caulk, door handles, etc) we would buy those too when they were in the store ad. Couple weeks ago I got an email from Osh that went something like, we heard you, we're going green and will no longer have store flyers in the store. I took that to mean IN THE STORE but it looks like there are no more store ads of things on sale (there is an online flyer but it's not a store weekly sales ad. Next week comes and same thing! So out of sight, out of mind for me. Not sure why they decided to not even have an online ad but sure enough seems what they decided.Today I got an email, something like these top things on sale now (three stupid things I have no interest in and the week is almost up. Who's bright idea was it to eliminated store ads? When JCP did away with coupons, down went the store. Wake up Osh (owned by Lowes). You are a smaller store. I pass two Home Depots to get to you, but no more without a store ad."
Where are the DE's today?
Lowe’s: “never stop improving”
"Home Depot is a better fit for Amazon than Lowe's. More locations, better educated employees. How ironic is it that Lowe's got the cursed Craftsman name now."
Long lines in Texas. Buying everything in sight.
HERE GOES 100K BUY ORDER
SELL SELL SELL!!! Idiot CEO who runs this company is from JCP. He ran them into the ground!!!
"So, If they do a buy back and the stock breaks 200 will they increase the Div?"
NOW U WILL PA MORE
Below $160. Just 3 weeks ago LOW was north of $180. So we have dropped $20. Was the stock overextended? Yes it was. However this is a quality that is now oversold? I think so. This stock just got too cheap imho.
"All this about Lowe's and recovery. Remember Lowes has dozens of stores in that area of Texas. Odds are some of those stores may be a total loss. Not to mention the repair costs and merchandise loss of those flooded. 100s of million in potential loss for Lowes all self insured.Remember also Lowes only has 30% of the Pro market, HD will get the majority of the business. Finally Lowes recent aquistion is (probably overvalued at the $512 million paid) is based in Houston. Almost 1/3 of it assets in south Texas. Another huge hit for Lowes."
"wow.. very close to a 25% gain in 3 months with dividend. No mojo needed, the formula is simple: buy LOW low..."
you should avoid any stock in which Vanguard/Blackrock are top shareholders!Instead to find FMR is top holder!
Just back from Lowes. NO crowds. No lines. Only one register open and still no line. Parking lot has few cars. Not what I had hoped to see.
LOWES TAKING THIS UP TO 118.50 WATCH AND SEE
Thank you Lowes for everything you have done and will be doing!! Impressive logistical team delivery work!! Congratulations to Lowes. For Lowes management disaster relief team performed miracles with an excellent response. Immediately sent 500 trucks for Texas humanitarian needs. Great company and great investment.
"If I had extra money, I would totally invest in this. It's undervalued."
"According to the Lowes career website they are hiring up to 2000 IT professionals. This supposedly started quite a while back. I hope it does happen soon. They rolled out a new checkout system that is worse than the old one. It's much slower than the old system. The customer is presented 3 options for receiving their receipt on buttons on the payment pad, they buttons are hard to read and are not in the same position from one terminal to the next, and their inventory system if often out of sync with what they really have in stock.I have ordered a number of items from their website, and I have ordered from a competitors site when Lowes did not have what I need. Their competitor has it figured out: Lowes has not. For example, when I get a tracking email for a shipment, with Lowes I have to jump through a number of hoops to get to the shipping information. With their competitor, I just click on a link in the email. I hope someone at Lowes monitors this board and reads the comments. I spend over $50k at Lowes annually and it would be nice if they would bring their technology into the 21st century."
Death all around us. Coronavirus is here and no one knows for sure how this virus travels. it shut down counties. Why in the world stores are still open. Risking their employees life. it's the largest Gathering Adult playground place. People show up from everywhere. Still risking the public life. We should be home period. There is no emergency then this virus. to have more money is not the solution. life is priceless. companies to rethink and change your course asap.You want sell emergency product sell it through online store pick drive through.few associates to help the online orders.. Stop now before more people die. STAY HOME PERIOD.
"if you haven't figured out this WILL go back up, stop trading!"
"After some comments that were said on CNBC about HD being cheap, I looked in to this further and it looks like both $HD and $LOW are both below their true value. hurricane just helps it gain attention to accelerate the price."
what's the bottom?
Lowe next acquisition target in Canada after Rona could be CWX.TO. to solidify its competitive positive with Home depot in Canada. Rona strength is in contractor business. Make use of strong US dollar to acquire Canadian assets is the right move.
Gap up on last earnings has filled over the last 2 days and now it will be up up up. Bought the $96 calls for earnings.
we all know our President is a show man and will give us something for Christmas. It will be a good twit for him. This market is all rigged for the big money to get in at low price.
Deep discount levels here. Loaded the boat last week. 180 and beyond is coming back. Shorts are sitting ducks to be squeezed like zits.
"Just a suggestion, if you don't like LOWs stock, don't buy it."
hows one my favorite stocks doing... ?
"Next two weeks should be interesting, HD kicking off the earnings next week and LOW the week after. A mere miss will be a disaster for both of these two. Of course HD leading the way it could be double whammy for LOW. With all the price increases from the manufacturers due to the tarrifs yes revenue will be up but profit margins will be thin ice to miss. Shorts will win."
"this may go to $300 by end of the year, the way it's trading."
ILL COVER TILL THIS GOES INTO GREEN
Store closing announcement didn't have a big effect on stock price. 50 stores out of 1800 all with close nearby locations. Sales will improve at those stores. Short term costs of closing stores greatly less than long term gains.
Watch how useless these analysts are.....
WE DOING GOO WE ARE DOING GREAT
"I hope the love runs out soon, like before June 15th"
"HD reported a good quarter, I expect a similar story for LOW tomorrow. However I do expect gross margins to take a hit due to rising lumber costs. However I see no reason why either company can’t pass these costs onto the customer. Lumber is in high demand so those who can afford it likely aren’t that price sensitive. Not to mention lumber costs will eventually decline back to normal levels over the long haul. HD is still up today despite this news, so I see no reason why LOW will be materially impacted either tomorrow."
MY SHARES WAS AT 123 IT DROPPED TO 116 LOL
"The Lowe's near me almost always has only 1 register open and their self-checkout are ALWAYS broken. Lately, I'll drive the extra few miles to go to Home Depot. On most items, Home Depot is usually cheaper as well."
"As a millwork installer I argue with the sales people and managers all the time about selling caulk and insulation when they sell a door install. Back in the day when you kept a roll of insulation around, and caulk was inexpensive it wasn't a big deal for contractors to supply these materials. Now supplying them gets a little difficult since we are still working of pre 2000 labor prices and materials we supply have risen 300 to 600 %. My argument is why would a retail store not want to sell the materials to the customer for there job? They are a retail store . If I supply the materials well I'm looking to save as much as posible this means cheap caulk and fiberglass insulation. And I might buy it somewhere else cheaper than Lowes. Guess this explains there ever trailing stock price . Not an industry leader ."
"Ok. bought a ton of puts yesterday and still holding, any thoughts how far up/down we go from here?My puts expire on Friday."
when do they pay their dividend
Can’t believe I missed $tgt and $low 15 points wow that would of been a great morning y’all lucky

LOW is up 5.28% to 88.19
Will be buying more today.
I think all excutives deserve a bonus and when the company goes down increase the exit bonus..cheers
LOWES to Home Depot is like AMD to Intel
FROM OPEN PRICE BESTPRICE TO COVER
Since I purchased my several hundred shares at a discount as an employee from 2009 to 2014 I'm not feeling particularly upset.
Lowes is about to take up the slack and be more in true parity with Home Depot which would put its stock at around 135. Lumber prices will rise again now that mortgage rates are falling and home buyers are coming back in droves. The American Dream is still a reality and Lowes will be a true winner.
"if you haven't seen it suggest you find WSJ article from Saturday on Shaw and Niblock meeting last week. Interesting quick read, found the part about how Shaw researched same store traffic versus Home Depot most informative. Confirms some of what I and some others have been saying for the last few months."
not sure why Chad keeps on bashing lowes. The entire market is down.
So everyone rushed to the home improvement centers to get that honeydo list done that has been languishing for the last dozen years or so. This created a couple of great quarters for these retailers. And then what? What happens when that punch list is complete? What happens when everyone has to go back to work?
Best short...
Did DSC get Niblock Bucks  or is he still a $9 cart boy? 
"Just more corporate greed! The Lowes' in Hickory, NC are just pitiful.(Home Depot not much better either) The Lowes Hwy 70 store the worst. We do lots of business through Viewmont store, and morale there is so bad, and weekly new hires/fires go on, you hardly recognize anyone any longer. The young people they keep hiring can't tell difference between phillips or strait screwdriver ! Only handful of older longer term employees on contractor end, but one 10+ year cashier I deal with (who came from const. background) says her pay is still 10.00/hour after 10 years service !"
Has anybody heard about a stock split?
should I invest in low or HD? not sure why Low outperforms HD recently
Time for a change in management!! These guys are terrible and costing shareholders millions!
Couldn’t stand watching price drop today on great earnings. Debated writing a put or buying a call but ended up buying more shares at 161 today. Buying shares and unlimited time is nearly a guaranteed return. I don’t understand how several of the stocks that I watch have all dropped on significantly on good earnings reports only to creep back up over the next 2 weeks. YMMY.
HERE IS BIG BLOCK SHORT COVER
Lots of great news today! Also crossed two important moving averages on above average volume! It will continue moving higher.
"HMGnowEarnings will be bad, and they will be cleaning house and writing all the garbage off to set the new CEO to succeed. Also Lowe's( Home improvement industry) does no't face the adversity retail does. Housing market is trending up and couple more years to run. Retail is going through some structurual changes. Any bonehead should be able to stay profitable. But it will take some real talent to become beat of the induatey. Not sure if Ellison is the guy. If earnings are bad market risk is low going forward."
Why did LOW just jump 3.5% in like 5 minutes... what happened??
HD up 4% since earnings.....LOW is up 7% in the same time span.....a no brainer to short

Lowes needs to do a stock split (2 for 1) and a dividend increase. Its way past its normal stock split zone. Everybody else idea on this subject
LOOK AT THE 6 MONTHS CHARTS WE HAVE BROKE OUT SO NO STOP WE GOING UP NO RESISTENCE UPWARD WE GOING UP FOLKS SO DONT SELL BE A FOOLISH.
Consider: Low is up >230% in 12.5 months since the low of the Covid crash- not too shabby.. %^)
"I was somewhat disappointed in today's price action. LOW was up only 34 cents, closing at $163.54, well off the high ($165.410). Hopefully tomorrow will be more impressive. Go LOW!"

My son owns 1000 shares at low $57 and refuses to sell when it was over $63. Each time I do the side trading to keep my son great company, I make very decent profit.

About half of lour employees do NOTHING all day long but we cant fire them. Literally NO ONE applied for a new position last week."
So are we going down or up today? Dead cat bounce or not?

"very strange date today... the dow is up 200 point, but HD and LOW are down significantly."
Told ya spanking coming ....
SOME ONE WAS DOING SOME COVERING THATS ALLLOL
SO BUY HOME DEPOT AND LET THS COME DOWN
"Bought a few shares at open, $87, to cover recently sold shares @102. Double digit dividend hike is coming for April. I still have a huge margin of error with my initial purchase. This is how one rolls in early retirement. Steadily increasing divies >inflation is a retirement paycheck that beats raises from work. Cap-app is just the icing on the cake. BTW, all LOW non-DE's should use some of the $1k bonus to fund more shares. Compounding over time is the way to early retirement."
"This is too much of a bargain for people not to buy in, or buy more. I bet this small dip turns around, and we close in the green today! GLTA!"
I love you Lowe's I am a veteran and love how you support veterans.
"Today is an excellent day to get in. This has been stagnant and oversold for too long. Once a CEO is announced this will pop. It is long due and a bargain on the retail drop today. One other thing is LOW stores are in better locations, insulating it from down turns. Yes HD has more stores and contractor loyalty. Lowe's has good margins and more affluent customers. HD high volume but higher cost. I own both for different reasons."
"During a rally, the President complained, rightly so, about low water dishwashers and showers. And how you can't wash your hair, and how you have to use the dishwasher 3 times, then wash the dishes by hand. before buying a low water appliance, you should also know low water washing machines require several washes, and even then, they leave a layer of lint. The lint is from the machine using friction between clothing to wash. Be careful buying a low water appliance."

Nice dividend for investors.
Get ready.
I am out and not any fan of LOW==stay away from slow moving garbage!
"also... as a former PSI for Lowes, I just recieved my third class action lawsuit check from a case raised in California for working 60 hrs a week with no overtime pay simply because Lowes decided they didn't need to follow the laws. they put you on salary and demanded you close X number of remodel jobs a week ... sometimes covering two store locations... 60 hrs was the norm... each check was between 2000 and 4000 for all PSI who just joined the suit. the management just abused their productive staff regularly ...for hourly staff, your reward for doing a great job was more pressure to handle more without any pay for additional performance - some folk punched out but would stay to catch up off the clock. moral among store employees is very low - which means customers get poor service. Bye Bye to Lowes - what a shame."
Not sure we’re this stock is going
Wow! Down over $9 this morning. #$%$ Just a sell off for people to rotate into travel stocks and things to go up after pandemic? I don't see any bad news.
"Lowes lied about earnings, that's why they where laying off workers. I know cause I worked there and it was going down hill fast, as and operators where talking about bad are and cutbacks at all stores."
Just horrible. They missed bad. Wow!!
I'm long LOW.....with the really good HD earnings and the solid runup this am....could LOW's earnings for tomorrow be baked in already? Seems to be some profit taking after running up to $164.
"Buying the dip. This should be at 200 by the end of the year. A fearful market is one where you buy, and LOW being down on COVID fears makes no sense as more people being at home will mean more home improvement projects. Too easy. Be greedy when Mr. Market is fearful and don't listen to the shorts' songs of doom."
Is it me or do all the posts that bag on Lowe's sound like they are just coming from disgruntled or ex employees?

"Hackerman is selling calls, buying puts and will slowly sell it back to mid 80's, and then rinse and repeat. Hackerman was buying over last few months and spent most of the time in the mid to low 80's, you can only guess that he is booking some profits. Right? Selling into this funny pop."
"Why can't lowes give it's full time employees Set hrs.If you have been full time for at least a yr, you should be able to get set hrs. Changing hrs every single day is exhausting & you won't keep good people."
I will stop shopping at lowes after several failed attempts at buying large items and not getting them delivered correctly and having to wait a lot longer and lack of customer service...they would be easy to put out of business...if another competitor arrived on the market...
LOW reached a new All Time High at 94.50
Markets one big joke here. Thousands of points over priced DJI / NASDAQ S&P
We're at the stage where fools are piling in. The rally is about to exhaust itself. The cup and handle rally is just about done. Sell.
"The ""trade war"" is only an issue now because the previous FIVE (at least) administrations did nothing about it. MAGA and ignore the short term pain."
"Lowe’s shares were under pressure on Wednesday following mixed third-quarter results. The company reported earnings that came in just shy of analysts’ estimates, and provided a muted outlook. Revenues came in higher than expected, with U.S. comparable sales up 30.4% and online sales increasing by more than 100%.And down 8% today. Must be because I bought some expecting good earnings."
"LOW is returning to the FV zone with the drop this morning. The 5yr. blended P/E avg. I use (3 prior yr. and 2 fwd yr. estimates) is 19.6. This is even consistent with LOW 20 year P/E avg. of ~20. @$150/below, the P/E would be ~18... in the FV range. Think I'll add a few shares <150.."
DSC selling mops like crazy. LOW up $1.51 !!!!
Need to check their reviews!!!!!!!~ 1.5 / 5Their 800-445-4697 is NEVER answered. Tried 5 times now and on hold over an hour each time then dropped.. 3x on 5/13 and 2x on 5x20.Even BBB has MAJOR complaints on their website.
"On August 18, 2017, Lowe's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share, payable November 08, 2017, to shareholders of record as of October 25, 2017.Lowe's indicated dividend represents a yield of 2.3%, which is substantially higher compared to the average dividend yield of 1.92% for the Services sector. The Company has raised dividends on its common stock for fifty-four consecutive years."
"The reason this wont go up is cause of high selling, stop selling."
"This is a company that is now testing in some of its stores a new employee scheduling system that is being sold to so called ""valued"" employees as more ""work-life balanced"". At LOWES this means that part-time workers will now be able to work a maximum of 25 hrs. per week with ZERO hours guaranteed based on one's availability. What many of you may not know is that quite a few stores survive based on part-timers working full time hours. If you thought service was lacking before, guess what, it's probably not getting better when you add that full-timers are now being asked to sacrifice the one weekend off per month they do get, for one weekend off every 8 weeks. That's six weekends A YEAR a single mother will be able to spend with her kids. How's that for work-life balance? The new system is a software program designed to make schedules based on an algorithm and not the facts on the ground. I digress. Long story short, morale is in the toilet. Everyone thinks the new CEO and his cronies are there to purposely tank the company, a suggestion that is not far fetched when looking at his track record especially given what happened JC Penney. The market will probably pull this company along, but as Warren Buffet once said; ""You can always tell who's swimming naked when the tide rolls out."""
"LOW is back knocking on the triple digit price, Reliabilt front door again. lol"

"Keep shorting at $108-$110 levels. LOW price is manipulated higher by so called hedge fund managers. So is HD, short at will. Sell triggers in place. The new CEO, COO and CFO is a joke, puppets of Wall Street not the company."
what the hell happened today
"Lowes stores are understaffed all over the country. I have spent hours in lines at the Customer Service desks, trying to return products. They try to staff their appliance depts. like the rest of the store, forgetting that an appliance customer requires a great deal of time to work with a salesperson to select model and type of appliance. Consequently, there are droves of customers who are required to wait for assistance. Most walk out. Lowes special order system is antiquated and doesn't make sense. If you order multiple items from one vendor, but are forced to reselect an item after a few weeks because it isn't available, they cancel and rewrite the PO. What does that do? It starts the clock all over again on the items the vendor did have in stock so you are faced to wait that much longer on the entire order! These types of operational hurdles are what's causing Lowes salespeople and mid-managers to be over worked and stressed out."
I wanna know where this analyst is from keybanc securities is. He placed a hold rating on lowes at 165. It proves a point here the reason they call them brokers is 95 percent of them are more broke than you.
"There were lot of out of the money call options purchased before today's earning!! market makers had to shake the tree by dumping the stocks otherwise they have to cover the out the money calls which they sold in past days. Once dust is settled it will go up again. Their numbers ( earning, P/E ratio,...)and fundamentals are good . They only wild card was chines new regulations which in turn it might work in favor of JD. JD and PDD had complained in the past about BABA who was manipulating the market. One other reason that did contribute t o today's sale off was lack of forecast report by JD. I think stock will fluctuate between $low 80's and $108.49 in the next 90 days but the trend will be upward."
made a 120 call on 117 and lost a whole lot. lowes is shot
"yowza, all time high in LOW... %^)"
DO IT NOW DOT I NOW
Lowe’s 180 maybe more
BUY HOME DEPOT
Why is this stock taking such a beating today? Level 2 data is all over the board.
LOWES BETTER DO SOME BUY BACK THEY CANT BRING THIS BACK UP LOL
"Stock down ! DSC went ""down the shore"" (vacation in NJ)"
Feels like a leak !
Read the Benzinga article from today. Marvin Ellison left Home Depot and took a formidable management team with him to Lowes
@SF. Your acting like a 5 year old.
"Sorry longs, same as last quarter. HD struggle, LOW will get shredded.Wait until after earnings to pick up the pieces."
I bought LOWs about 3 months before virus hit and was worried. But then I saw the stores were open so I hung on. Amen.
Not surprised they killed HD this qtr- you could visit the 2 stores and see it. HD made customers wait in line outside with many choosing to drive away. Lowes let them in and buy. It's pretty simple. . they were hungry for the business and HD wasn't. I'll buy LOW stock and sell HD.
"Like I said the AMZN effect is going to be a Lowes's flu for a long time. This will be in the $50-$60s by this time next year. Then $30s then $20s. AMZN is not getting smaller, neither is HD."
"Tell you what, for weeks on end the parking lot is almost full no matter what day it is. I’m buying more here."
Sold 1/2 my shares @ 100
"lordy, LOW is up for the 9th straight day...don't be dumb, let your winner's run.."
Selling 1/2 my shares @ $100! Merry Christmas to all LOW share holders !
"Bought after hours and sold after hours, good luck for tomorrow"
of course $85 first...
These next few weeks are going to be turbulent because of the political events. But the dust will settle after Nov. 3rd and things will go back to normal. Recognize how far LOW has come since March and how far it will continue to go in this COVID environment and after. Shorts have no case here. Every drop is an opportunity to add to your position and get richer. LOW and HD are in demand no matter what is happening in the US and around the world and that will never change!
Dip on earnings then will run for 2 weeks after that
"Lowe’s has dropped into correction territory. It’s like $20 off it’s high of $170. And it’s Christmas and they have added 20,000 temp workers for the holiday rush. So what gives?"
"Down 1.50 all morning and now up $3, what happened?"
wow mm...i will hold.
GO DOWN MORE MORE MORE GBABY GO DOWN MORE
"A rumor on the street indicated that the Milford, CT store was going to be closed. Any truth to this statement? Customer traffic seems they are busy."
Buy order in at 148.85
Sell LOW and buy HD. So disappointing.
Note HD up slightly today. Is the market rigged?
"Just buy at will. Any of the home improvement stocks will revisit old highs, they are in vogue and have plenty of room to run up. These are real companies with huge earnings and the original disruptors of the original main st hardware stores (which I love)."
Blowes sucks with regards to management and how they treat employees which in turn means the customer is not helped and or treated like they should be which in turn means this turd is gonna get flushed. When the next housing and economy bubble pops which should be in the next 12 months this will be down at $30
what the hell?????
"It's just oversold today, they will be back in it leading up to earnings day. TipRanks has LOW at a 10/10 to outperform for earnings coming up."
"Lowe's will see new lows under Marvin, great choice. This man was unable to manage a 755 millions USD company and yet he gets the job to manage a 71 billion USD company (as of today's value)"
HERE I COME SHORTING MORE LOL
Lowes is incapable of hiring competent staff. China Depot err rather Home depot does a smidgen better.
