P & G is Rockin' again!
sell or hold?
Patience will reward the experienced investor. Average costing this one.
"I think most investors don't realize the millions of people switching to cheaper generic brands worldwide that compete with P&G. Couple that with what will be a market implosion for the US equities markets, it doesn't look good for the next 18 months or a lot longer. My target is $60 in the next 12 months."
"Getting to former top, and 93+ could be the starting point"
"at 150,,,a SPLIT-Oh Baby"
Is it too late to get into $PG ? https://simplywall.st/NYSE:PG/procter-gamble
"To all that say ""look at the p/e 25"", I said the same thing about CHD when it was trading at 46 before split. Since then, I got double the amount of shares and now it's trading in the 60s and has a lower price to earning at 20. That's why I don't pay attention to p/e anymore"
$80 seems within reach today.
ANOTHER 52 WEEK HIGH! Next stop 130 after earnings.
Time for a breakout to a new high!
Can’t even be mad at them paying off debt... I’ll hold and add if it falls further
"With 2/3rds of this quarter completed it would be helpful for the company to announce any additional good news they have to encourage analysts, to raise their yearly target from 127 and change, with a yearly target increase of around $5 that isn't much incentive for folks to buy the stock."
"Sold my today , hold since it was 79. Hoping for a dip to buy back later"
$8 from breaking $100 for the first time since little ice age.
Another new high with high volume... Nice.
"He would have been one of many board members. Are they afraid of outside ideas? He would have replaced a former President of Mexico. Now there is a guy who is a real success story! Or look at Lundgren, another board member, he did such a great job at Macy's, right?"
"I only wish P&G had shown the same urgency to get their business back online as they have trying to keep this guy off the board, they have been stumbling around like a drunk for the past decade."
GILLETTE IS NOW TOXIC !!
"The dog of the Dow, I finally bit the bullet, took a loss and sold."
Pg will never reach 85 again
True confession ::: Why I voted for President Trump. I lost my job in 2010 when Obama let all the H1-2 visa people from India and Pakistan into the USA who took all the IT jobs in Wauwatosa Wisconsin for lower pay and I had to train the new person in my job before I got my severance package. Obama was a total disaster as President. Could be why Trump won Wisconsin a normal Blue state like Michigan. I will vote for Trump again in 2020 he is making America great again just like he promised. Finally a president keeping his word unlike Obama who lied so many times I lost count.
CLWT is blasting off!!
"This company has managed to survive two world wars and countless other difficulties, to think it won't come back from the coronavirus is just plain wrong. This is a great opportunity to get a true blue chip company at a discount. IMO"

Stock buybacks will bring PG back to 137+ were it is supposed to be.
"Hard to believe last sept. this stock was 94 and change now 74 and change, back to where is was in 2015, What an absolute stellar job by Taylor and his bunch, no doubt they will all get multi million dollar bonuses for doing such an outstanding job. When shareholders have had enough of this they will vote in mass to remove these guys from the board."
"Why are you dropping, PG?!"
"Due to high gasoline prices, will have to go generic."
"Please explain why PG is work $122 per share: negative tangible book value, flat sales, PE 30? This is an $80 stock, at best."

When are people going to stop overreacting to interest rates
Nelson Peltz sold 7.5 million shares of PG. Probably explains the weakness last few trading days. He filed the report tonight.
"True, as RSI is <=30 these r algos that have already programmed to cycle out of value stocks like PG & into more growth & risky stocks due to cheap money ( low interest rates + QE + stimulus etc )..Value stock slike PG r the best place to be in right now, not to much beta ( volatilty ) but stable & growing,, Great point to get in , Will surely revert back to the mean of the Bollinger bands of 137+ in 2 to 3 weeks max..."
Get woke go broke
The Environmentalist that invaded P&G Headquarters a few years ago are winning. P&G is moving their product lines to the Left.
"I am long PG and have held it since it was 85 dollars. PG raised growth guidance, finished a nice year, big buyback in store. What is causing this one to fall?"
Another new high! I'm making money while others want to believe the PE is actually 84. You make me laugh.
"The stock is priced at its pre-earnings amount now. If you THOUGHT it was a good buy then, you should buy it now that you actually KNOW it’s a good buy"

We are all happy Ovomit is gone! I was tired of him bowing to heads of other nations! America bows to no one! Apparently ovomit never got the memo! Silly little girl he was!
traditional wisdom is PG is a large cap growth stock with solid div yield. what is different on 2017?
"Hasn't PG beaten analysts' estimates for the last 11 consecutive quarters?If there is a correction, won't money flow into consumer staples for some degree of safety?Shouldn't PG increase EPS by 7%+ for the next few years?"
Why such a high PE ?
Nice to see upgrades for a change. JPM raised PG to outperform target at $100 from $82.
"Barclays bank wonders is PG still a dog after 12 years or is their it might be coming back? It is still a dog and for many years to come but lets ask the 2 experts Osulindrool, and his buddy wooglin3, with months of experience and days of knowing about PG, and best of all they think Lafley former CEO of PG was the best of all time they are 2 people that should know, just ask the they will tell you"
PG reached a 52 Week low at 99.81
1.42 at pre-market I guess it doesn’t look too good? Anyone knows anything about this?
A good stainless disposable razor stays sharp for a year. Gillette blades rust out and go dull after one week.
"Milton Glass, 88, who helped keep Gillette independent in corporate raider era.By J.M. Lawrence GLOBE CORRESPONDENT DECEMBER 09, 2017Milton Glass worked his way up from the 1950s assembly line at Gillette to the corporate boardroom, where he fended off two hostile takeover attempts in the 1980s as chief financial officer.Mr. Glass faced off first against corporate raider Ronald Perelman, and then a team of young investment bankers during an era when the greed-is-good ethos prevailed. A mild-mannered executive not prone to hyperbole, Mr. Glass explained the razor giant’s predicament in a 1987 interview. “We’re operating, frankly, under wartime conditions,” he told the Globe. “We have a sense of mission that won’t ease up for several years.”With his business skills and reputation for integrity, Mr. Glass helped the Boston-based company persuade shareholders to reject the lure of fast cash from corporate raiders. The fates of thousands of workers in Boston who depended on Gillette were at stake as Mr. Glass worked to stoke shareholder confidence."
"Having PG since 1972, 2004 till now 13 years PG has gone no where, give it 4 more years it might reach 100. Maybe? If you ask wooglin he would tell you it is because Lafley is not at PG, the reason Really...........ya right,"
"So after one good quarter in years the board awarded the CEO and his minions a 25% pay raise, just maybe they should think about holding off on the raise since I thought these people were paid for results but I guess not at P&G. Maybe the board should have to explain their reasoning to share holders."
130 after earnings
pg is the worst of the worst ... its been dropping like a knife and u can never touch it....$140 was a month ago...today is hovering around 120 !!!!Shame on M.F CEO who cannot stop the sell offs nor can he start buying back its shares

pg===garbage==sell now for 30% drop!
Interesting how this reminds me of the late 90s and 2000. The PE hit 41 just before the price halved. Enjoy the ride!
Moves slow but stable as a rock. I like it.
I wonder when PG is going to split. Anymore Cheerleaders?
"I bought this and am taking a loss atm but diversification is key, I can handle moderate loss to the share price and still not care.This is a work horse in terms of dividends, if you own this company for capital gains you are an idiot.PG will out live everyone reading this post. My children will enjoy the passive income from this titan. Short of a Canadian bank (BNS,TD, RY etc) I can think of no safer stock to own for the purpose of safe passive income when I retire."
"Hi Fred and other friends,l am definitely a looser of PG and long time bag holder. This garbage goes up 0.001% and drops 3% U should avoid buying PG for sure or you will get stuck for the rest of your lifeHonestly, PG is the worst of the worst within its peers..."
Wow! I think this might break 100...

"So profit will decline because of a rise in commodity prices.... these prices rise for everyone, are we acting like pricing at the stores never go up? I guess I should be able to buy dish soap for a nickel then. If PG’s raw material costs go up everyone’s does, they may have more leverage to keep them lower."
The euro vs dollar is now at $1.20. Will pg still use the excuse of exchange rates. That's wearing out.

"Just read Nelson Peltz sold 2.148,127 shares over the last 3 days of October on behalf of his hedge fund worth nearly 267 million. Trian fund still owns about 32 million shares representing about 1.3% of P&G,s outstanding shares.Article states ""In addition, more than 2.09 million shares were disposed of by Peltz on Oct. 31 via a transfer to certain limited partners in connection with a lock-up period at a price of $124.51 """
P&G beat on earnings and reached expected Revenue numbers. Stock is down in Pre-market trading. This makes no sense!!
doesn't it cost a lot of money to split? I don't see why they would do this. I'm okay with this price point and continue to add shares.
SELL SELL SELL *Jim Cramer Voice*
"What happened to the simple ""last day to buy and get dividend"" post?Did the poster realize her folly?"
10 billions share buyback and 8 billions for dividend
What the #$%$ earnings beats and it goes down. Something is very wrong
How many products from $PG can I use at the strip club I am going to buy? The past owner went #$%$ up and I am buying it from an estate. Lifestyle change but I expect strong cash flows.
will we see $80 again by Xmas?

"did anybody see the after hour trading volume on Friday when it hit $79.92, so many over ten thousands volume hits. it's about turn around time."
This is exactly the market where high quality stocks like PG thrives... No frills.... Just see this going GREEN and GREEN as the market goes RED and RED....Love this
Still in a PG bull move cycle to 140.
Have calls a little nervous for earnings
The just announced three percent dividend hike announced today is peanuts. I have held this stock for over thirty years and just might sell it. They are cheapskates as far as stockholders are concerned but they certainly pay themselves very well.
worst stock i ever bought this is crazy down every day
"I signed out, to see what the cat had been posting.I found this nugget:""...have not a clue but like posters to think they know what there (sic) talking about...""Yet another example how the U.S. educational system has failed those living in Appalachia."

Never buying Gillette razors or anything from P&G again. These globalists PC liberals need to burn in hell
Might be time to sell and take some profit
Sell or hold ?
"Actually, a pretty good day today."
I will never buy ANY of their products again. I hope they go bankrupt.
PG = Very nice Blue Chip dividend playing stock for everyone's portfolio.

Pelz said rather rich than right. insight to fact almighty buck rules him...hence amoral. guess the Gillette ad reflects that influence. Taylor doesn't have a pair.
PE too high. In fact all Consumer Staples are due for a nice pullback
"I have held this stock for 20 years. Although the growth of capital would have been faster in tech companies, I am happy with the dividends."
Looking for P&G to announce dividend increase next week.
"Reminds me of an old Luther Ingram tuneIf having PG is wrong, I don't want to be right..."
"There is an article out saying Costco just started selling their own brand of razors and blades at a 24% discount to Gillette. Also states that Harrys is going to be selling in 2200 Walmart stores the end of this month. P&G share of the razor business has slipped to around 56% from near 70% of the market when they purchased Gillette. Lets hope the BOD finally recognizes the company has so badly managed this brand they need to sell it off as they have made so many mistakes with Gillette it is beyond repairing customers desire to buy this brand, very sad."
110 at close!
"Procter & Gamble (ticker: PG) is up 10.8% in 2020, while the Dow has gained 6.3%.Although P&G began the year with an earnings miss, it has delivered three strong reports since. The shares didn’t react much in April, as demand for cleaning products was hampered by concerns about a strong dollar and the uncertain outlook at the start of the pandemic.Yet the company has been raising its dividend while continuing share repurchases, and its July results showed that even economic uncertainty couldn’t dampen sales of its portfolio of premium cleaning products. The company turned in another strong quarter in October, as organic sales continued to shine.Naturally, 2021 will present a challenge for P&G, as the receding threat of the virus will take some focus off cleaning. Yet others argue that the standard for cleaning will permanently be higher post-pandemic, to the benefit of P&G and peers. In addition, P&G has historically had one of the higher organic growth rates in the staples industry. Those metrics will certainly fall a bit in 2021, but if it can continue to show that it’s resonating with consumers, the shares need not fade with Covid.Analysts seem fairly bullish about P&G. Of the 24 analysts tracked by FactSet, 62% have a Buy rating or the equivalent, while a third are Hold-rated and there is one bearish call. The average analyst price target is $153.05"
conference call says they will beat again
Lowest close since Sept 2015Low debtWill grow eps by 7%+Recession proof products4% (apprx) dividend yieldThis company will see the share price rise again
P&G had pretty much gotten rid of their R&D in house and is simply focusing on marketing to sell either at white space or any place. It has gone back to their philosophy pre-1970s where you try to onvince people to buy your products instesad of asking people what they need and come out with a product....
P.O.S.
Keeps dropping after 2 upgrades and earnings beat>MAKES NO SENSE!!
When is last time PG up 9% in a day..?I guess COSTCO make PG cheap..

It's gone from $20 to $50 in the last 12 months but this is just the beginning. They got noticed after Cramer talked them up a few months back on Mad Money."
It is funnie that JimCraper current market is not over valued... He turned around and bash a stocks with pe of 22...How many stocks out there with PE over 22?GawdShiat.
Will the Board vote for a hefty dividend increase from the new lowered corporate tax rate of 21% or increase the share buybacks to prop up the PE ? seems with the 10 year treasury up to 2.75% announced today that the dividend needs a good boost. Lets just hope they don't vote to spend this on more fancy parking lot designs and social issues.

Time to fly to 130s
I guess this is falling because of slowing revenue growth and high premium from the fair value. Fair value is only around $118. 2020 revenue increase was only driven by the pandemic. But I still believe in this company and still own shares.
110 by next week

Just how high can this baby climb if earnings are good AGAIN. PG is breaking new ground...
New 52 Week High will happen today!!
"A lot of the price going down at this point is due to technical analysis. When you have your 50 day moving average drop below your 200 day moving average ...bad things happen. The algos work in full force, traders and computers recognize this bearish sign....and the death cross selloff happens. There was a good article on Yahoo I referred to in a post a few days back.Expect this to drop even more still. I'm eyeing a buy in around $105-$115."

PG had massive sale in Costco last quarter. Now the customers are not going to buy the same stuff for another 6 months. Have to see how the earnings will be for the next two quarters. Bearish. This is one time good quarter.
Capitulation going green
this stock is useless should have sold th is pig at 93
How low will we go???
When is the stock split coming?

"This vile company has sowed the wind, now they will reap the whirlwind."
"Fascinating quote from Bloomberg article ""How Peltz Can Turn P&G's Tide"" (located below PG quote):""P&G hasn't bought a company since 2012. Its last big bet was in 2005, when its $57 billion acquisition of Gillette secured 60 percent of the razor market. It's worth noting that Unilever was able to scoop up 15 percent of the same market for just $1 billion last year with its purchase of Dollar Shave Club."""
"I only reinvest dividends in my DRIP, but I’m not receiving my quarterly statements anymore. Is anyone on the MB still getting theirs ?"
Well... Whadya know! Who knew?
Shocking decline today
100 day MA going down and getting ready to cross 200 day MA.
This is heaven during turbulent times...
One of the best stocks to own in your portfolio. Resilient money machine!
if it goes lower it won’t pass 68.. today was a good buying point. buy before you miss out
"Really good technical analysis article on Yahoo regarding PG.The 200 and 50 day EMA are getting close to crossing...which is referred to as the death cross.If the 50 day avg at $133.61 drops below the 200 day avg of $131.69, then we should expect a large selloff to drop this stock even more.I'm looking for this to happen and buy once it drops as this is a excellent reputable company that will prevail in the long term.I think they have beat earnings estimates for the last 8 quarters or so."
Fantastic numbers. P&G is in beast-mode in times like these. Very happy to hold shares in this amazing dividend king.
PG is flying. Going higher and higher.
134 by next week.
As I said PG nearly flat last 30 days
I have been pounding the table looking for a good place to park this cash and I finally found a website that send out income producing plays once a week. If you are like me and are interested in strong dividend plays just go to the-stockdork .
Yahoo says pg is a buy does that tell you what not to buy !

Who opened the can of spam...............
What a scam. They kill 26 cents per dollar and give nothing to share holders. Lmao
"For you gamers, the DJIA is an index of 30 stocks. PG, a component, has broken out as a safe haven stock with earnings. With interest rates falling the last decade, (40 years frankly)- technology, Internet, healthcare and FAANG stocks took in active capital. Rotation starting into late cycle and defensive stocks.Now PG is a safe haven, widows and orphan stock. Unilever, KMB, Colgate type stocks will join in. This is a major pivot.Tariffs not squeezing gains but adding to transportation costs. If PG ever can figure out millennials there will be $100 prints. By year's end?"
"Time to write off Gillette. The razor department is having a price war, and the competition is sharp."
Current PG pricing does not make sense. Same for JNJ. I think both will go up 5-7% in few weeks.Now that's peanut compare to daily move you get from stock like $AMZN but if you like safety you should invest here.
Any dividend increase news?
PG is up 4.99% to 106.92
Ex-doc on Friday - so .75-.80 reset expected today - all things considered continued accumulation
"Brutal day for the market today, and I think the next couple of days will be a big tell for P&G. We're just on the edge of the 50 day moving average at $120.29. It's only broke through twice in the last year first time in Dec. '18 when it dipped below $90, and then May '19 dipping below $105. Both times the stock bounced back up. But I'm wondering if there's enough gas in the tank to bounce back this week. I'm gonna put some stop limits to take profits on some of my holding just in case. Don't want to get too greedy. What are you guys thinking?"

Another all time high today?
PEP reports pre-bell tomorrow and may direct movement in consumer staples. Looking at this one as it seems to be the analysts whipping boy imo.
The 20-days SMA (simple moving average) fell below 200-days SMA and it looks like the 50-days will go below as well. Both the RSI and MACD looking weak. I would wait until these moving averages coil back close together with the 9-days SMA on top of the 20-days SMA on top of the 50-days before buying. Lower low begets lower low; don't try to change a falling knife. Try to buy at the very bottom could be costly.

PG is not as bad as the stock price shows today.
BUY BUY BUY!!
Is PG undervalued guys? Anyone?
This trash is so over valued pe should be at 13 expect huge loses the months to come as tech rebounds
A split on the way???
"Well let's see only 13 years yes right till pg broke the $90 a share,Wooglin is loving it. Buttt pg normally splits in 7 ears, and now he will tell you pg will split soon , and because Lafley put pg on the right track, butttt 13 years and no split till it hits 110 and that is maybe, today pg paid a div of 1percent. If. KC. Which did not have a great year pts paid 5 percent on its divnot to mention new team bought 8.6 million shares that is why pg up today, Lafely turn pg in to joke, a Wooglin will say it was him, with pg selling 100 companies and now having billions of dollars pays share holders nothing, as usual Wooglin and his brothers who own virtually nothing want to tell you all they know, which is NOTHING"
Global MELTDOWN thanks to TRUMP stupidity !
What a day :)
This is a buy under $135
110 after earnings
Best stock to own in this environment. Steady as a rock.
Do they buy Tide in China?
I want to go on record as not giving two $&!+$ about a split. Don't care one way or the other. I thought I might add to the discussion on here.
its devidend day
What in the heck are you guys looking at
"Yes sir, Taylor and his minions are really showing they deserved the 25% pay raise the board gave them last fall."
Pure Storage is a dead money. I have possion in it and every time it crosses $17.30i sell it. Ark investment is in it. Cathie Wood is smart investor. It is mind juggling why $PSTG & $PG ARE DEAD stocks. While the rest of tech doing well.
And they return shareholder value by buying back stock. That is where the divestiture proceeds are going. how about a 5th dividend once in a while?

"CRAMER SAYS PG IS A 'NO TOUCH"" and over valued with a PEof 24+!!!"
"Is anyone else sick and tired of hearing how P&G is "" FACING CHALLENGES.AND IS IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO CORRECT THE CHALLENGES BUT WILL NEED MORE TIME "" This tired and worn out line for the past 10 years has gotten nothing for shareholders but a stock that has underperformed by any meaninful measure. Only a breakup of the existing behemoth can get shareholders the value they deserve."

"Well just another PG earnings day down of course, I said yesterday with the better dividend than usual watch out for today and i was right. Folks had PG since 72, whole family has had since 1950 and we have had bad times before but not like this! All PG board,Taylor,Moller, and i would guess 50 to 100 other managers must go now they sucker in all in shareholders as they always do, and to be honest they all look beyond stupid but.............they ALL keep ripping off PG shareholders maybe they are just tring to make GE look good, honest DO NOT BUY Dog of the DOW Pg is on its way to 15 years at the bottom"
Never again will buy any of their products.
Been a good run to safety day. While P&G is exposed to a China slow down they have done a good job of a building a truly global supply chain so many businesses are able to minimize the impact to sales outside of Asia.
Trump + Powell are the only 2 problems here ...NOT the economy !
"This has LAFLEY'S hand all over this: He sold over 100 companies of Pg over last couple of years, PG gas 13.3 billion in cash LAFLEY gave shareholder 1% div this year worst in history of PG. He ran PG down 10% last year, he made 18 million in stock and salary, he has made PG laughing stock on wall st.Funds until latest div, buy PG only for that, and now and he is still at PG Get this PG looking to BUY some new companies Lalfleys puppet TAYLOR and make no mistake he is looking for new companies to buy, and i bet the other moron Moller is looking to, you remember him I'm moller do not worry we are on the right track his favorite line, so i asked are 2 exsperts do you think we should start buying new business after Lafley sold over 100? Maybe we could ask warren to sell us back Duracell at a discount? Should we give shareholders a one time div increase? what do you 2 experts think? said we are cutting Alans lawn right now, let us think it over, well there you have wooglin3 & uslindrool will let us all know!"
"The real story is no one sees the 804% increase in cash equivalents for the quarter over same quarter for 2019. This puts the FMV at $1,300 currently."

"Do not gamble with Procter and Gamble. Investors are fleeing consumer staples and will never return.

Only stock that GREEN
"PG was performing really well before Covid... at about $125 per share. Then in shot up like a rocket due to the hoarding and shortages of supplies and huge demand. Now, if the overall economy goes back to pre-Covid normal, this means that the companies whose stock prices were depressed due to pandemic will raise closer to their pre-pandemic levels. Guess what will happen to the companies whose price was lifted by pandemic ? Now, I don't think PG will fall all the way down to $12x, but somewhere between that and the high of $145 is, to me, pretty likely. What is there to keep the price above $140 once the Covid-driven crazy buying stops and the patterns return back to normal ?"
Breakout to 110 by next week
Fantastic numbers and guidance. P&G just keeps knocking the ball out of the park. P&G is my 2nd largest holding and as things look today I am never ever selling!

So excited to be able to get more at a great price!!! Will buy on the way down for sure- it’s a beautiful investment for the long haul!
The early 2000s are upon us again. Oil is starting to rise which will cut into PGs profit in near future. Here’s to the three Rs. The new sound is just like the old sound.
All of the consumer staples group (XLP) are down near 52 week lows. I don’t know where the low is but I do know that eventually money will rotate back to the XLP group Good luck
It looks like it wants to go to 48
All you need to know about PG: look at who the directors are. The ex CEO of Boeing - fine. The CEO of AMEX - fine. The rest - UGH. And the ex president of Mexico? Are you kidding me. You need decent people not schlubs.
Lot of CEO for the money. Buy.
P&G rolls out organic tampons and menstrual pads. .....I wonder if they're gluten free too.....
PG is up 5.97% to $85.03
"People will realize that they still beat earnings, even while their retail customers have had soft quarters. PG is a consumer staple, which is where people will take shelter as the economy turns."
100 a share for a company that will earn $4.77 this year or 21x earnings for 6-7% earnings growth..Should be selling at 15x earnings

"I laugh when people throw the split word out when it comes to P&G. Good luck. The only people who buy Company stock are employees, grumps and geezers.

The Obama care has young couples not being able to afford kids. I hope Trump can straighten the health care out. Nothing like a 900$ per month family plan with those deductibles while the unproductive get it for free. I think my 900$ per mth is old news..... 2016 numbers. It’s probably much higher now and set to increase 50% to 90%. Time to wake up America!
PG management has always been insular and arrogant and they need a shake up. So I voted for Nelson.PG trained marketers flooded the consumer products industry in the 1960's and later and they were mostly terrible. Thought they knew it all but only knew the copybook PG way.I can name a dozen who just sucked and not one who was good.
my analysis shows PG closing above 135 by calendar year end. and my model has been bullet proof for 6 years.

"Here's ONE Republican in America who is honest and tells the truth ~“I swore an oath before God to apply impartial justice. And, as you know, I'm a very religious person. I take that very seriously,” Romney, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told The Salt Lake Tribune ahead of his vote. “And so I looked at the evidence in a very unbiased manner and concluded that that the president had done as was alleged — that he did ask a foreign government to interfere in the election, that he did pressure that government by withholding aid.“That's as egregious an assault on the Constitution of our country,” he added, “as I can imagine that a president might make.”Romney said he will vote to acquit the president on the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, because he doesn't believe the House took all the steps it needed to test the president's assertion of executive privilege covering witness testimony and documents sought in the inquiry."""

Thoughts on the derailment of EPC/Harry's deal? Probably mean's Gillette's deal for Billie isn't going to go through either. I think this is a good spot for Gillette in the long run.

"From Morningstar:Investment ThesisErin Lash, CFA, Sector Director, 25 April 2018Following Procter & Gamble's multiyear effort to cullaround 100 brands from its mix (leaving it with 65 brands),we think the firm is now poised to benefit from anenhanced focus on its highest-return opportunities. Whilegrooming and baby care (around one third of sales in theaggregate) continue to languish, we think theimprovement chalked up in its beauty (nearly one fifth ofsales) and fabric care (one third of sales) segments (uplow to midsingle digits) showcases the first fruits of P&G’sefforts to rationalize its mix. And while improvement hasyet to prove broad-based, we expect the firm’s continuedinvestments behind core brands will lead to increasingconsolidated sales growth and support its brandintangible asset.In our view, despite slimming down, we still think P&Gwill carry clout with retailers, maintaining its scale edge.The 65 brands it maintains in its portfolio include 21 thatgenerate $1 billion-$10 billion in annual sales and another11 that account for $500 million-$1 billion in sales eachyear. We believe that by supplying products acrossmultiple categories (such as fabric care, baby care,feminine care, and grooming among others), trustedmanufacturers like P&G are critical to retailers looking todrive traffic, both into physical stores and on e-commerceplatforms.Further, we don’t believe P&G is anchored to acceleratingtop-line improvement at any cost, and surmise that effortsto drive efficiencies (targeting $10 billion, a high-teenspercentage of costs) are prudent--aimed at reducingoverhead, lowering material costs, and increasingmanufacturing and marketing productivity. And whileinflationary and promotional pressures are unlikely tosubside near term (in line with commentary expressed byother consumer product manufacturers), we think itsstringent focus on costs stand to modestly boost grossmargins (up 100 basis points to 51% by fiscal 2027) longerterm, while also fueling research and development(including improved packaging) and marketing. In thisvein, we forecast the firm will allocate 3% of sales forR&D and 11% of sales for marketing each year over th"

Got more today at 134.75
"Well, at least it's doing better than the DOW right now. Good luck!"
What a comeback.
is stock split in the cards
Big time profit taking throughout the afternoon.
Looks like the 2:30-3:00pm crowd have awakened again :)
Will PG be selling any cannibus infused products?
"Many years ago I got rid of my Capital One card because Alec Baldwin is/was a POS. I doubt they noticed because I was broke back then. Now I spend 150 K a year on my personal AMEX card and God knows how much business my company transacts via non Capital One cards. United screwed me ten years ago when I was flying back from burying my dad down in NZ. I told them I would never fly again with them or any affiliate and nor would any of my employees on business. Last year my employees had over 600 flights and 90 % of those were on Delta. Now when I head back down there it is Delato to Hawaii and Hawaiian Airlines to NZ. Inconvenient? Yep. When I couldn't stomach ESPN any more I got rid of my sports package and went completely online for my baseball/football fix. When HBO went completely leftward I got rid of all my premium channels, not just HBO, and now just subscribe again during GOT seasons. When Netflix hired Susan Rice I canceled within an hour of the announcement. Two hours ago I was speaking with the other co-founder and the upshot is we told the facilities people that they needed to replace all Dawn, Charmin and Bounty on our campuses. I have a beard and just go to a barber when I need trimming etc. so I doubt I have used a Gillette product in my 25 years in the US but I don't care. Hollywood is about to go #$%$ up because it is a leftist echo chamber. Nike got smoked with its woke garbage and P&G in another couple of quarters will be trading in the low 60's. Actions have consequences."

"P&G has about 20% sale in China. If US vs China gets worse, P&G's sale there may be at risk as well."
PG markets to housewives whose job is to spend her husband's money. The same marketing tricks don't work Gillette razors because men are spending their own money.
PG has beat earnings consistently and achieved record revenue in the face of covid. Yet it is down? What the h?!
Bought at $129 and $128...I just can’t help myself
"PE for PG seems a bit high, considering the low revenue and profit growth. PE below 20 is more reasonable. Back to $90."
My grandmother worked for P&G and started me off with 30 shares in 1979. I reinvested all the dividends and with all the stock splits and adding here and there and hopefully one more stock split I'll be really happy.
Screw crooked lying corrupt Trump.
unbelievingly huge after hours trading volume over tens of thousands all at $77.79.
Hopefully all the retartds sold now and we can bounce.
When will Trump go to prison?
"ALSO, MRK, VZ, KO and PG have been the SAFETY trade last month....watch what happens when money flows into OTHER stocks for year end rally!!!!!!!!!"
Anyone listening DB conference Presentation by John mueller
Read it and weep or reap lol.
Bought at $122
"Since October 12th...PG is down I(barely) six DAYS...nothing goes up FOREVER, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE WORLD ECONOMIES ARE TANKING!!!!!!!"
This constant new 52 week lows stuff is getting old.
Wonder how much longer and lower the BOD will let this stock fall before they actually do something? Current management has lost all credibility.
"The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) is an American multinational consumer goods corporation headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble.[3] It specializes in a wide range of personal health/consumer health, and personal care and hygiene products; these products are organized into several segments including Beauty; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric & Home Care; and Baby, Feminine, & Family Care. Before the sale of Pringles to Kellogg's, its product portfolio also included foods, snacks, and beverages.[4] P&G is incorporated in Ohio.[5]"
"Once you understand that Skeletor, aka Nelly Peltz, and his band of criminals spent a mind-numbing amount of money to get on the board it all makes perfect sense. Just a little profit-taking going on. These people DON'T lose money...EVER!"
"Stifel just downgraded PG from Buy to Hold...That's exactly what I am doing - bought more in the last 2 weeks including yesterday, now I am holding, exactly what mama said ... hahahah"
"After 2% drops, PG continues moving 140."
Garbage sell out...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unilever-buy-toothpaste-brands-p-094801216.html
100 shares just picked up. Take advantage when the market gives free opportunity to make money.
buyer under 100.00
just pure junk. Announce a buyback. get this over 90. Shouldn't be selling off this hard on these results
Why PG share price is not increasing with this valuation ? .
Market is using PG to prop up the DOW -- this will not end pretty.
"After one month drop, I am betting that P&G will turn around here to retry $140-145 during the coming Feb - March. Relatively, it is a cheaper share than most DJ stocks."
Going to $140.00
Now a bargain!
https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/02/3-top-stocks-to-recession-proof-your-portfolio.aspxI strongly agree!!
insane volume open at 88 tomorrow
"Hypothetically, let's say someone has held PG, since 1972.PG did very well, but of late, it has stalled and this has led the hypothetical ""investor"" to become quite bearish on PG. (And dare I say quite emotional as well! It's human nature to become emotional when an outsized position has been underperforming for so long...we're talking about BIG! money, and a large missed opportunity.)Yes, hindsight is just that, but had this investor sold her PG shares ten years ago, paid state and federal cap gains and invested the remainder into VTSAX, her position in VTSAX would be valued GREATER than had she, as she HAS (hypothetically, of course), held onto PG!This ""investor is vehemently opposed to paying taxes.Again, this ""investor"" is BEARISH on PG.She has plans to gift PG shares to her offspring and their offspring. Most would agree, particularly re grandchildren, that it would make economic sense to gift $15,000 worth of PG ANNUALLY to them NOW. But she should not stop there. The ""investor"", since she is BEARISH on PG, should recommend her grandchildren SELL PG immediately and pay the very modest % cap gains tax and reinvest the proceeds into a ""better"" equity, ETF, or fund.One question remains: will she do the right (economically) thing?"
What would Peltz think of the Gillette ad?
Wells Fargo upgrades to $115 from $91. No bad. Not bad at all.
They stopped selling their inexpensive razor and now their bleeding. After that I bought an electric.
"Oversold & overstretched , tech chars indicate that may dip a bit before swinging back.. As someone mentioned earlier in this thread sell OTM calls if u have to but hold on.."
Predict a dividend increase announcement this week.Expect an 8% increase.
What a great week. Amazon for the td and PG for the extra point!

"Does this sound like a person with any intelligence?So he patiently waited, and now America has ramped up its testing and the president has boasted about how amazing his administration has been at testing, while also pointing out how testing is dumb (probably Obama’s idea) and causes more people to get the virus: “Don’t forget, we have more cases than anybody in the world. But why? Because we do more testing. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn’t do any testing, we would have very few cases.”"
Yup. A few Millennials are buying some hipster soaps from internet adds. But the majority of the younger generation still wants the brands they grew up with. Very comforting in these days when you can at least take a bath with something you know.
"Read the preamble of the P&G fiscal 2018 3q report. At least they know where they stand and what needs to be done. That's a start, if they don't pig-out. Can't dwell in glory daze any longer. Come on PG - snap out of it!"
get woke go broke!!
Very good price for shopping.
After great quarter why is stock slurping on weenie?
"Took my options off today...wanting for the bounce to put back on....Aug 16th, $60 PUTS....for those wanting specifics. I have made over $10k last month trading them."
Hanging tough!
smooth sailing down
Looking to add tomorrow at 60
stop deleting my post about corporate taxes
Lots of insider selling in the past couple of weeks could be dropping the price.
Looks like a new 52 week low is a certainty
Amazon has pressure on PG too.
Another all time high close!!!
Chart looks to be breaking down. Are we headed to $115?

HAHAHAHA YES BABY GO SHORT IT
PG is about to hit the buy point.
"A break-up at the top trend line at $114.20 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 7.01% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $113.28 and $122.21 at the end of this period."
"Does this sell off on a trade deal with China? People have been piling into PG as a safe play, what happens when they don’t need a safe play anymore?"
150 by 2020
buy chance?
"Will PG go back to $71 or better yet $67 if T yield hits 4.5%, I think it is a possibility."
Anyone that thinks that P&G is not the best investment ever should look at the maximum time available on this site - nothing but a straight line upward for 30 years! With dividends that grow every year.

What process was used to seat Mr Jimenez? I own many shares of The company & wonder what this move is leading to...?
"LET'S GET A SPLIT,,,,WE LOVE A SPLIT,,,, I WANT A SPLIT-OH BABY,,,JUST SPLIT,,,I WANT MORE SHARES,,,I LOVE OWNING LOTS OF SHARES,,,,BLOCKS OF STOCK-"
Let me refresh my statement. The CEO should be on his knees apologizing and BEGGING us to keep buying their trash. Is that PG enough for you Yahoo?
"The first good quarterly report in years and the CEO and his minions get a 25% pay raise, I'm sure they don't want Peltz on the board or anyone else who would hold them accountable."
"The *ONLY* problem with PG is its share price. Like Apple, many day traders have started trading it. This is why when Big Tech is up, MSFT and AAPL are generally up higher than AMZN and TSLA. Traders would rather use $30K on a $130 stock than using it on a $3K stock. Unfortunately, this creates short term volitility. This is the onyl downside to PG.Other than that, if you are a long term holder, PG is the safest investment on the market. Always has been and always will be. Guaranteed 5-10%/year. That may not look great, especially over the past year...but all bubbles burst. It's only a matter of time. And when it does, all these traders will lose most of what they will have made. PG, though, will still stand tall.Oh, one last thing. The Citi price cut dragged down the price from $139 to $131. Guess what? Their PT is still $150, and that's on the low side of the spectrum. I'm not worried about PG at all. 100% of my money is in PG (around $40K), and it's for the long haul. I put aside $500-1,000/month and put it into PG every month. Why? People would say this is risky. It isn't. PG is the only company that cannot be overtaken, at least within the next 30-50 years. Their distribution network is too strong. Their partnerships are too strong. Their moat is just too big. My family made millions (literally) on PG alone. I am following in their footsteps."
At 97.06 this PM. A good jobs report.
Sometimes when I open my portfolio and see the overall value I just giggle....because I can.
We've had to switch to generics due to high cost of living.
"I am glad the ego ridden Peltz lost. Now he can go haunt another house. I like my Tide and I don't want it changed or sold off or anything else. If he thinks he knows how to run a business, let him send in his ideas."
"before we point fingers to anybody. we have to realize the nature of PG business is out datedlet's do a a survey here.1) How many of us on this blog is under $352) How many of us use internet shoppings more than once a week3) How many of us have an Amazon Primer membership account in their household3) How many of us enjoys spending time doing their daily grocery shopping or prefer those heavy things comes right to your front door.PG shopping model and nature is all stores bricks and mortar retail, it out of people's lifestyle now. all those who had the most disposable income are under 35 or high income seniors. None of those groups would enjoy lifting 2or 3 litters of heavy Tide home. Tide washing detergents, shampoos, big chunky and bulky hard to carry toilet papers, etc, etc are the same if they comes from Amazon free delivery to the door or I have to drive to the store and pick them up dispite of my super busy schedule. Why bother going to get them in the stores in person. As my son always say, order from Amazon, save the gas and save the world from air pollution."
Still undervalued LOL.
The 13F reports come out by Monday (apprx)Has Warren Buffet changed his PG holdings and will he have commentary about consumer staples in general?
I don't want to use a product that makes me feel bad about myself. Watched the ad and it does just that. Why would a business want to do such a thing to its main customer group?
On The Rise should see 135 by next week
Where is Nelson P?
So now P&G has acquired a LAUNDRY business. It has facilities to clean clothing in 4 cities. WOW. That's a biggie. I guess it is part of Nelson Peltz's concept of local businesses. Next up: local soda fountains. Gross insanity.
Just say NO to $PG
STAY DOWN DAMN IT DONT BUY SHORT PEOPLE
LOL at least the corporation will make tons of money selling toilet paper and facial tissue to the people who were screaming “Buy !” when it dropped below $140. They need a large supply of both items right now...
this board now SUCKS..........................
I forgot only macho men buy Gillette products - who knew? Won’t have any effect on earnings because mainly women buy their products not men -
two words charmin ultra
Yeah this doesn't seem to be holding at the recent monthly lows. Probably best to get out for now and buy it after it stops dipping and starts moving upwards again. Strong fundamentals do support a hold. But Such a fall for such a non-volatile company on a green day. Something is going on.
"With PG trading near its 52 week high, and only a few points from its all time high, it's not surprising sno has not been posting lately. I'm wondering if sno has been taking advantage of this level to lighten its position.I'm also curious, since it professes to be very knowledgeable about PG, whether it will participate in the COTY exchange."
argh... they should have missed the quarter like Netflix
Is this an example of what the putz can do foe P & G?
We’re still probing for a bottom Today’s price action is bearish
I nailed it on my call of 86 after earnings
Running out of steam - pretty obvious this is going to pullback some
Volume is very LOW...not a good sign.
Nervous sellers gone - back up. It’s just that simple .

Hahaha... The weak arms of the soy boys can't hold this stock up much longer
SHORT XLP and PG............absurdly over valued and over bought!!!!!!!!!
"It’s worth $1,300 per share because the revenues / EPS and cash flow are 10x because of Covid world wide pandemic. The time to buy is now before everyone piles in."
"Look like PUMP BEFORE DUMP, earnings coming"
Why is PG SP seeing large swings of 10c or more within a few minutes
Can we see a ALL TIME HIGH?
P&G Insiders selling at a good time. I hope nobody is using their 17.89% APR Credit Card to purchase common goods. The whole Market is up on a borrowed Dime.
"Cramer says watch for 1-2pm when margin calls will hit stocks like PG, KO and MCD....because they will have to be sold!!!!!!!!!"
New CEO and BOD time.
Happy World Water Day!Nice to see PG is involved with providing clean water to some of those in need.
"Great to see this stock being appreciated again by Wall Street. Great products, huge revenue, nice dividend. Has everything an investor should value."
"TP, NyQuil, and other items made by PG are sold out of almost every store in the country. Earnings is going to be exceptionally good this quarter..."
Good earnings beat and nobody is selling before dividend next week
Another Day and Another new LOW ! Death by a thousand cuts. Thanks for nothing B.O.D.
Elderly investors rejoice today.
Faked out again. So now I hope the long term thing works (moan).
Millennials favorite on Cnbc
You just got to have a lot of P&G. Quality. Period.
Why is this down when there's a peace dividend on the table and a potentially new market for PG to enter?
Begun the boycott has...
why can't Peter be mute. he's so freaky.
Prudential recently picked 800k more shares of PG according to recent ult-agg filing with 7 million shares total
Wow!!! What a day. I am glad I didn't give up.
Boycott ALL PG products. Idiots at this company pandering to the whacked left.
PG trying to act cool.I can be cool too!No longer buying any of their products.
Got my buy orders set at $135!
"What I heard in t.v. is that Mr. Wonderful from Shark tank, wanted Peltz in the board and it was mentioned that Mr. Wonderful had a lot of shares of PG. Only time will tell if he is good for the company."
how many down days in a row?
except the company wants to go solar
BOYCOTT Gilette and PG!!!!
The future is pretty clear! Management gives themselves a 25% raise while they mismanaged the company. Time to reconsider investments.
IS it Time for the CEO and the top brass to go into sunset
"Santa Claus rally starts in two days, hope it,s beneficial to all."
The vote is a perfect time to let PG know if you think they should stop advertising during NFL games!
still way cheaper than COST...
Nice beat today.Should see a decent bump up.
Seems like the 1 yr. price target has been lowered. I guess when insiders start selling it doesn't look all to promising for the company. For now. They still have to sell of a few businesses to grow. Looks like Peltz can't win that one for us.
"If PG is intent on eliminating toxic masculinity they need to immediately drop several products. Old Spice represents to old way of thinking. A woman sits around waiting for her man to return...toxic. Mr Clean they has a muscle bound bald guy that isn’t very open minded. Commercial represent a strong guy bringing women cleaning power so they can do “women’s work”....toxic. Braun, even the word is bound in masculinity....toxic. Finally Gillette which has been a sponsor of NASCAR and the Gillette young guns where boys will be boys as collect female admirers....toxic. Come on PG, stand behind what you are preaching and eliminate these toxic brands. Also don’t you think it’s time to eliminate the good ole boy network in the board room and through the management ranks."

Question.....How does one email PG investor relations to voice their displeasure with management?
$85 by next friday after a good earnings report
"Another day, another P&G high.."
PG is heading to $100.
Should be close to turning the corner on this thing.
This add is a PR disaster. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mj8VpuLSkHYGillette has been made a laughing stock by a bunch of man haters.
"PG fellow shareholders should President Trump have US Justice Department arrest billionaire convicted felon George Soros for inciting riots and paying for thug who riot in major cities across the US. The paid Soros thugs did $100,000 plus in damages at Berkley College two weeks ago. The lawlessness angry liberals need to stop and stop now. Soon they will get their heads cracked open if they keep it up and start filling up our jails.http://www.independentsentinel.com/soros-behind-56-groups-running-womens-march that left trash everywhere and trashy nasty signs"
Steamrolling to 90!
"With oil and oil based products at record lows, manufacturing companies like P&G will benefit from lower raw material costs, corona virus or not, folks are still using toilet paper and toothpaste along with other necessary products. Wonder how many of the AOC followers would want to go back to cleaning cotton diapers out in the toilet instead of landfilling disposable diapers?"
l just wonder #$%$ are managers / ceo doing in PG??? every F day is tanking !!! l am so regretful of buying this #$%$ @ $140every day gives a F new low
Buying 1 call wasn’t enough at all. Well 115$ for 900$ is a good trade
There is no such thing as a sure bet but PG comes very close. Safer than a bond and dividends are growing.
Unstoppable power...
Stone cold
"How can they Keep saying buying back stock is a return to the shareholders? (Supposed to make remaining outstanding shares worth more). Hey Jon and David, it is not working!!!!"
Good job to those who made a quick flip on this. Time to get out now. One percent growth p/e should be 14. Thanks happy new year
"Prediction. Earnings are good, and PG is over 130 v. soon..."
Trading at about a PE of 24 based on 2019 average est of $4.44 (2018 EPS was 4.22). A 24 PE ratio for 5.2% of EPS growth is outrageous.Kel

Down on less than 200k shares premarket - just nervous short term holders running.
"UNfortunately, the sharp Chines yuan to US dollars devaluation will hit all US companies doing business in China. The yuan has sharply devalued by 6-7%, and will continue to an wide expectation 10-14% by the year end. P&G's top and bottom lines will be hit as all other US companies and Chinese companies with ADR stocks in the US. Sell all these companies before too late."
WOW watch this baby tank :) :) :)
"The following is from a comment on a PG S.A. post--while ""ironic"" is perhaps the most misused word, the following is ironic!""The Cincinnati Business Courier today (Oct. 23) ran a story with this headline: ""P&G's new ad campaign urges women not to fear change"". The story was about marketing for the company's Herbal Essences shampoo.""Bears repeating, but this time PG's management and board should listen:do ""not fear change""."
c'mon man
Buy buy buy
AP- Budget deficit running 41.8% above last year. Is the USA Trump's next bankruptcy?
White men still makeup a large part of the US population. This was a stupid decision by Gillette and P & G for allowing it.
Pg is grossly overvalued. It is growing revenues at less than 3% and earnings at 6-7% and selling at 19.8x 2020 earnings. Give it a generous two x growth rate of 15 on 2020 eps of $4.80 a share an d you get $72 a share....
Melt up continues - no chance for bad news until next qtr report - that means clear sailing and back to 85 in next month
The one-week chart makes no sense
finally this pig is moving up
TOLD YOU IT WOULD GO GREEN AT CLOSE>>>DAM IM GOOD
buy some puts on PG. These stocks are the last to fall but they will.
"THANKS strong jobs....PG is over valued, over bought and going DOWN!!!!!!!!! LOO...PE in the mid 20's........from $70 to $114 in 1 year!! Central bnaks cannot inflate assets forever and the crash will be EPIC!!!!!"
WE DON'T NEED NO STINKING TRADE WAR!
"C’mon, you can break that resistance!"
Hello hello hello Please please buy p g as much as possible tell your friends and family to buy buy as much as possible it will go 160 in next few months- my research
"Have not posted lately so here it goes As a family we have had PG since 72, big deal who cares but we have not bought a share since 2009, WHY because PG has been run by MORONS and still is and counting 14 Years that is right PG has been the worst stock on the dow, and still keeps on Lafhly,McDonald, and now taylor not to say the BOD has been the worst but just look they do not enough have the Cahonids to resign just keep stealing from shareholders beyond some of the most cutless people ever beyond the worst possible. Save your dividend buy other stocks forget proctor nobody has bought 1 share since 2009 and we have had PG all our like i hope you get it,Wooglin will tell you a story i am telling you not to buy pg because it is as usual DOG OF THE DOW AGAIN 14 years and running"
"mr. peltz, u tried your best, try next time. mr. peltz keep up in your business and stay busy."
"So, who deleted my short message? Short, short, short, short, short until it hurts them in their shorts."
"I always think highly of advice from ""Anonymous"" ..... NOT"
why is this going up all of a sudden I'm happy but I'm trying to understand
"With the drop over the last 3 weeks, low entry point, shift in trend up over the last week, and recognition that this is a safe haven stock paying a good dividend in a recently volatile market, I think we will see some analysts considering a switch from ""Hold"" to ""Buy"" in the coming weeks.PG may see a boost."
"I for one am sure glad Peltz is on the board, doing a lot of good, NOT !"
There;s going to be a big run back to PG when this market realizes it's priced in the tarriffs help about 3 times already
"I am thinking PG will reduce some high priced , underperforming headcount and start to merge and realign business units as first steps. You don’t get that bad overnight - time to realign incentives for managers to stop acting like civil service jobs"
"wish I had my vote back, I sure would vote for Peltz"
"I swapped out of my Dec. 21 PUTS to the JAN. 4th...the $94 puts were only 25 cents more for the extra 2 weeks+......made no sense, but I'll take that extra time and HOPE this does not break out above $95."
MO is much cheaper than PG
I PORMISE EVERYONE WE WILL COVER AT END WE WONT GO 119 AND WE SAFE TRUST ME U WONT SEE 119
P&G's dividend is not keeping up with the price of the stock. Needs to be over 3% for long term investors.
Hope Mr. Taylor makes the price of PG stock soar like his salary!!!
I make more moey on my checking account. Disgraceful.
PG is down 5.15% to 115.39
"Low Interest Rates are P&Gs only friend. This is only bought for the Dividend. People are willing to buy this at a higher price just for the dividend. If the 3Rs keep their Oil prices rising, that has to cut into profits."
"I have worked at P & G for almost 22 years and believe me, quality of product is very important.Perhaps there was an unforeseen issue with the formula that developed on the shelf. Please call the 1-800 number and they will do the appropriate follow ups to make this right."
Stay away from Harrys Razors they ran an anti-Man ad in Decemeber attacking masculinity. You can see it on their twitter. Seems Gillette got some of their quotes like Boys will be Boys from there.
Interesting investigative piece looking at a short selling group that have scammed investors out of billions. It’s a must read: https://stockmanipulators.com/moez-kassam-and-anson-funds-a-tale-of-corruption-greed-and-failure/It looks like the hedge fund mentioned is attacking their site so if it’s down you can use these links from the internet archives (they are a bit slow but will show): https://archive.st/v3ix and https://web.archive.org/web/20200928200023/https:/stockmanipulators.com/moez-kassam-and-anson-funds-a-tale-of-corruption-greed-and-failure/
When I started researching PG it jumped from $70 to $127. Since then it has been a roller coaster.
Consolidating to 133-134? Will be temporary
What should we be outraged about this week everyone? I need something to boycott!
"I am never switching from TIDE. Tide cleans clothes much better than the other stuff. One WMT associate was trying to give me a coupon good on something--- think it was Isil. I told the person it was a German product. I came home, researched it and it was made by Dial but it was owned by a German company. The next time I was in WMT I informed him that I wasn't buying a German product. A vendor I know well said WMT got together with the company to come up with a product to compete against Tide. Well, I don't think it works. I don't shop Aldi and I don't buy German soap."
"Awesome day for PG holders. One day I will buy in, but until then, happy for all PG holders!!"
"PG seem to alternate between sitting in the doldrums and moving forward, depending on the risk-on, risk-off mindset of the market. It's a comfortable position to put money into."
PG is down 5.04% to 111.53
102 at close!
"Expected move of $2.50 based on the options. So glad my strangle did not get filled yesterday. PG seems to always move beyond the implied amount. Market Makers getting burned today,"
Too close to all time high....PG looks like a survivor from corona.
"The PG executive who is in charge of this PG division marketing is Pankaj Bhalla... Born and raised in India.Did all his college in India, then worked with PG in India, Dubai UAE, Switzerland for eight years.He only come to live in the USA in July 2012...So his entire knowledge of males in the USA for only 6 years has led him to produce this pronouncement that American males are bad... especially white males.. They do terrible things like BBQ... stand around while children fight..This guy and PG can take their anti-male stance and ship it right back to India.... where women are gang raped and molested on trains and buses... Where tens of millions of Indians are deemed ""untouchables""... lower caste.How in the world PG let this guy produce such a hideous ad is beyond belief.Boycott ALL PG product until and unless they issue a serious apology to all American males."

bout damn time...
"LOL at the P&G Kool-Aid that you longs are buying on Gillette's $8B writedown.From the 2018 year-end annual report:""Indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized, but are tested separately at least annually for impairment. ""As of year-ended June 30, 2018....from the annual report (form 10-K filing)""as well as the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion, have both been reduced to below 10%, both due in large part to an increased competitive market environment, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar that have occurred in recent years""The foreign exchange nonsense that the CEO spouted is dubious at best for the $8B writedown. The auditors would never have cleared an existing impairment of $8B that existed in 2005 from ""foreign exchange"" for the 2018 statements. The bulk should have already been accounted for as implied in the 2018 note since the auditors were are of this significant adjustment....and you won't accumulate $8B of f-ex on goodwill in a year.It's clear that something else is recently plaguing Gillette.....now what could that possibly be?!!?!?"
"the gillette razors have been found to be tainted with bacteria that causes sexual diseases and several men in Delaware are in the hospital with the disease, If one of them dies there will be a huge lawsuit."
"FAST MONEY Guy Adami commented on PG and said ""I don't know why anyone would want this at 22x forward earnings!! MACD line crosses down today possibly............watch for selloff HARD at the end of day."
excellent shorting opportunity

just keeps slowly going up...
"This price is a gift to the longs. Time to buy into $PG as it touches down to the 50 day moving average. Market's over-reacting to Peltz's sale. Consider, he only sold 2M of his 32M shares. He's just taking some profits."
"All time hight, and better on the way..."

Too bad could not hold near high - good enough
"Slowly but surely returning to $125 where it belonged before the COVID craze.How many people here bought at the top of hysteria at $145 and then doubled up at $135 because it “had nowhere to go but up” ?The good news is, P&G is not going anywhere, so your grandkids will eventually recover the losses."
"buy and hold, and collect the dividend!"
WOW Back to the same low as ofAugust 2015.
"Hello, everyone I also bought at $ 135 how many years should I wait to get even? And will it be back to $140? Pls any advice guys"
Fidelity has a stock analyst opinion of 9.1 Very Bullish and Argus Research has a target price of 137. Best of luck

An interesting take on how to beat Buy and Hold strategy on PG: https://www.stockmetrix.net/blog/post/061018/super-simple-way-beating-buy-hold-strategy-pg
"dick2 days ago@wooglin unless you’re a long time investor and would love to have twice the dividends???""twice the dividends""???Apparently some people erroneously believe that the dividend amount remains the same, after a split is paid. Yes, as was the case with PG, a dividend increase is often announced when a split is announced. But please realize that the payout is adjusted re the split ratio.PG last announced a 2:1 split 3/9/04. This was the same day it announced its increased annual dividend, with the first quarterly div to be paid 5/14/04Dividend paid 2/17/04: .2275Dividend paid 5/14/04: .252:1 split paid: 6/18/04Dividend paid 8/16/04: .25"
STUPID AD MADE BY SOME STUPID SOYBOY MILLENNIALS JUST DEALT A HUGE BLOW TO THIS COMPANY. WOW
What happened to my post made earlier today?I cited a few comments from an article on the subject at hand that I thought might illuminate a few excited people.
"Today's Morningstar analyst note:Analyst NoteErin Lash, CFA, Sector Director, 19 April 2018Lagging sales continue to dog wide-moat Procter &Gamble, with organic sales up just 1%, reflecting a 3%benefit from increased volumes and favorable mix, offsetby a 2% reduction in price. This weakness (not dissimilarfrom the past few quarters) was concentrated within thegrooming (10% of sales) and baby (27%) segments, whichwere each down 3% on an organic sales basis. Whilethese results are far from a plus, we’re encouraged by theimprovement chalked up in its beauty (nearly one fifth ofsales, up 5%) and fabric care (one third of sales, up 3%)segments. We think these gains showcase the first fruitsof P&G’s efforts to rationalize its mix. And whileimprovement has yet to prove broad-based, we expect thefirm’s continued investments behind core brands will leadto increasing consolidated sales growth and support itsbrand intangible asset.Beyond its quarterly results, P&G also announced itintends to terminate its healthcare joint venture withno-moat Teva and has inked a deal to acquireGerman-based narrow-moat Merck’s consumer healthcarebrands for $4 billion (3.7 times trailing-12-month sales and20 times EBITDA). In our view, this tie up (which is expectedto close by the end of the calendar year) stands to replacethe scale and technological know-how lost following thedissolution of its joint venture partnership. As such, wedon’t portend it signals a reversal in the firm’s strategy tooperate with a leaner brand mix. At just 1%-2% of sales,we surmise this addition evidences management’sopenness to selectively bolstering its reach in attractivecategories (consumer health growing midsingle digits) andgeographies. After assessing the quarterly results and theconsumer healthcare deal, we don’t foresee a materialchange to our $98 fair value estimate. With shares downaround 3% following this news, we’d suggest investorsstock on shares, which trade at a more than 20% discountto our valuation and boast a more than 4% annual dividend yield"
New 52-week high- SWEET!
Nothing matters from here! Life on earth is about to end! Prepare for the end!
Nice increase!!! 10% beautiful!!!
Alert Alert - on a 600 pt down day on Dow - P&G finally breaks Jan 2018 and 50% greater than average volume.if it carries to 95 by Friday - $100 by Turkey Day just might happen - my 100 $75 contracts for Jan expiration acquired when price was $72 look mighty sweet. Gotta love this stock ..
Don’t forget - the 5billion dollar share buyback just announced means the company will be buying over 50million shares - effectively putting a floor on the stock price at last earnings announcement
Buy Buy Buy!!!!
Seems like PG just wasted 4 billion on useless products from German Merck........ should have bought Pfisers consumer products......
come on 99
Are we seeing support at 128 or do you see a larger dip coming?
"sell, it's not worth over 50"
http://www.infowars.com/wikileaks-bombshell-hillary-clinton-hates-everyday-americans/
A year ago PG was in the 70s. 50% profit is pretty good for holding a year. Probably will sell off to 50 MA. Fund managers are taking some profit and will reload at lower levels.
They are running out of cost cutting resources. After those are exhausted then the true colors will come through. I know how they are cutting cost on a deeper level.
"If Peltz and all the directors and such quit selling, the stock should start to come up, time for folks to get defensive."
An interesting day across the board.
no tide left in our home
Another day another day down! Time for new mgmt and new board. Taylor has been a failure since day 1!
Over priced PG downgraded !!!!!!!!!!Procter & Gamble (PG) has slipped 0.5% to $83.86 after getting cut to Hold from Buy at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

Have you heard what Jim Cramer said? Jim Cramer said AAPL should be traded like P&G. with PE of 34..I guess PG is truly worth 200 now...

I think PG slowly returning to up trend. It will move faster soon. Big player slowing buying up and do sudden big market order to drop price again. Their Algorithm and power is unmatched and price lost much fast than gain but One thing sure they are buying big.
Just raised div 4% to 74.59 cents per quarter from 71.72 cents - expect great earnings

Thoughts about a dividend announcement this Month? Would love to see a 3% yield again. Cross your fingers.

Odd day for PG. Dow is up 4% yet PG is down.?I guess Wall Street expects people to stop buying shampoo and Toilet paper.It was getting a bit rich even with monster sales figures. This could be a healthy pullback.Definitely not a trend
Long term stock... people thinking towards this stock in the virus are dumb

Jefferies&Co. just raised P&G target to 166 today.

"OI did the same thing with MCD a few days ago....up $3k there.BOTH of these stocks are absurdly overbought and will fall back to their 50 day averages at some point................not worried at all..........just masses loading into ""safe"" trades....until they are NOT safe anymore....and that can happen EASILY when markets ell off hard and Mangers have to raise money to hide losses."
Stagflation ===> by PG
"This will be a dividend cash cow for many, many years in my portfolio "
"Expecting P&G to have an excellent quarter and lower year end numbers next Thursday, If P&G follows KMB could get a nice pop on the stock price . North American sales should be exceptional and sales in China, P&G,s second largest market may well be muted due to covid-19. Hope the hedge fund folks will let the stock alone for a while but since these guys aren't really long term investors, will probably start dumping if the shares hit 130+ best of luck to longs ."
"Absolutely spectacular announcement, Blowout earnings and forecast, Great job P&G."
The goofy commercial will go the same way the Nike anti american commercial has gone it will just quietly fade away.
costco pe 40.. PG is not there yet

"PG and WMT cannot carry XLP forever....time to buy PUTS...already made $7k trading XLP Puts......PG is the number 1 holding there, BTW!!!!!"
Mr. Peltz isnt going anywhere. The big boys at P&G know the clock has started. They spent millions to keep Mr. Peltz out but now they better do something to earn the 25% raise they voted for themselves this year. If no changes soon everyone should expect another round from Peltz....clock is ticking and Peltz is watching
when is it going to reach the Annual Price Target of $98
"Get in now, will close green today"
PG is down -4.91% to 74.36
"If Peltz has such great ideas, why does he make such a big deal? All he has to do is list all his great ideas on a piece of paper and send it to the CEO."
don't jump in for the dividends. it's like a bait
"This just shows that nothing is safe in this market, there is no more investing, it is all trading."
It's a buy opportunity add and wait meanwhile you get a dividend it will climb again you can bet on it.
P&G has a similar position as AAPL in China. May have sharp drop on sales there. It would not surprise anyone to gradually move doen to the break out point $92-94 area. Sell it now if you can't watch the process cofortably.
SHORT SHORT SELL DONT WORR Y ABOUT GOING OVER 119 ITS NOT
on to 175 buy end of year
"PG earnings last 4 quarters without the write down were... $1.12, $1.25, $1.06 and $1.10 for a total of (without write down) $4.53."
"At the current dividend, #$%$ equates to a 4.0% yield. That's competitive with fixed income investments and could represent a bottom."
This could easily trade under 60 by next month.
"People or algos are buying PG out of greed, certainly not fundamentals. Should take a leg down to 105 in the next week or so."
Sadly I see we are attracting political posters. I mute them - perhaps if we all do they will understand they are not welcome here. The BAC board is an utter mess from them .
IM SHORTING AS IT GOES OVER 118
Nelson Peltz doesnt deserve to be part of the board. Procter & Gamble is better off without help from others.
"Sorry Wooglin, we're not long gone. Gillette's pathetic attempt to redeem themselves with their latest ad only shows you that they know something about the past campaign....People are seeing through it...it's just a matter of time now."
"3/31/18 As you read this you have mostly read the worst performing stocks of the first quarter. GE we all new they were the worst Exxon, Wal Mart, and of course Proctor & Gamble! As another quarter goes by 56 since march 2004, PG has been one of the worst performing stocks over 35 times, and like 2017 another as Wall St says a lackluster year, down 12% so far this year and i have said many times like Hedge fund managers say buy only for dividend and beside that forget PG. PG for so many years the best stock in the dow, with possibly the worst management ever for the last 14 years, and no question the absolute worst BOD ever at any stock PG has only one name ""Dog Of The DOW "" and until current Management is gone nothing will change, family has had PG stock since the 50's just telling like it is"
"Mr. Pelz, please help this bloated, apathetic monster. Expose the excess and mismanagement by officers and directors and get this thing back on track."
Remember Unllever was down yesterday so don't get bent out of shape with PG being down. The whole sector has not done well. It is not their time.
"P&G has strayed from what made it a great company. They always hired the best and had the best profit sharing plans of any major company. People went to P&G for a career, not a job. Management no longer values that and the lack of innovation proves it. Outsourced functions will not produce like dedicated career people will. I’m glad I retired and diversified 90% of my stock before this great decline. I sorry to say that the only way to unlock the companies value is to break it up into smaller pieces."

"PG did exactly what I thought. It dropped down to 122 and bounced up. Now it's gonna hover around mid 120's until earnings. Let's hope they knock the skin off the ball then, so we jump past 130."
Jerome Powell raising Interest Rates. As rates rise P&Gs dividend becomes less attractive. The only solution for that is for P&Gs Stock price to fall. I wonder how their West Virginia Facility is running. I see $70s coming..
good buying opportunity here...just added shares
Another all time high!
$6 from 100... Yes.. PG ready to break that.
"Allegedly the vote was very close.Had sno voted its shares another way, it could have altered history, since it owns so many PG shares!!!"

proctor gamble stock split
"June is the end of the fiscal year for P&G, wonder how many millions will be spent on executives bonuses for the extraordinary job they will claim they did on managing this company ? By any meaningful time span in the last 10 years this company has been a train wreck, yet execs. continue the rape the company coffers based on some non meaningful parameters. If you look at earnings and stock appreciation these clowns should have all been canned, including the BOD. Lets hope shareholders vote their shares accordingly this year !"
Tide detergent makes my skin itch
"Maybe the board needs to give another 25% pay raise to the CEO and his minions to get this stock moving as they did last fall but first explain why they gave the first one, I always thought management were paid for results but not at P&G I guess."
$140 year end seems reasonable.
BUY BUY BUY!
I agree with one thing Peltz said (although I voted against him) and that is there is nobody on the board with consumer packaged goods experience except David Taylor the CEO. Of course. Peltz also has absolutely zero experience in this area and is a college dropout. Got his money from the family produce business founded in the 1800s. He drove a fruit and vegetable delivery truck.
Where is all the people who thought P&G was going broke because they were boycotting Gillette. The stock is going straight up.
If transgender lesbians from Africa have a seat on the board at P&G then we can fight global warming and also save sea turtles.
"I'm not an idiot. I know PG has its problem.Basically their products need to look more like the stuff you'd see from the ""Honest Company"", colorless detergents...etc to appeal to the millennial generation.They don't even want to carry those bulk detergents anymore, they want those sleek looking packages.So that's why the stock price is this bad. I'm investing, I'm investing that the management understands this and makes positive changes. In the mean time, the dividend is not bad, I get paid for waiting. 10 years later, my feeling is, I will come out winning.I'm not day trading this, so I don't care what prices are doing on a day to day basis."
P&G STOCK GOING DOWN LIKE A FALLING RAZOR BLADE !!
"Interest rates UP, PG DOWN......with 10 yr. at 2.75% and PG yield at 3.1%...people are rotating into safe investments after ABSURD bull market caused by Central banks cheap money."

Wish I could have caught this at $102 or so
Peltz is a Putz. He is attempting to gain influence so that he can drive short term gain at the sake of long term growth. He is the only one who will benefit. Him and those close to him. If you aren't one of those people good luck trying to time your investments so that you don't lose value.

PG is digging its feet in--when will the proxy vote really be over and the expenses associated with it be over as well?Wouldn't it be nice if management could focus entirely on the TASK at hand?What a curious circus!

"After seeing this clip, I won't buy P&G products -and certainly avoid any GILLETTE.You despise your customer. Fine, You rid yourself of your customer. Period.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&v=koPmuEyP3a0"
Checking P&G history of dividends yields since July 2011 averages out to 3.04% if P&g closes the year at 125 per share and increase the dividend next year to just 3% it would pay $3.75 annually for an increase of over 25% . Wonder if this will be discussed at share holders meeting along with company position on possible splitting the shares.
"P&G shares crash for 12 out of 13 consecutive trading days, and that includes days when DJIA went through the roof. Was Hillary Clinton named CEO when no one was looking?"

"Peltz holds over 38 million shares. He will likely reduce his position gradually, that will set an upper cup for the PG stock for a while if not down much. PG's culture is so old; not surprised to see it going down during the next few decades. Just my one cent ..."
Why is P&G's Largest Customer Walmart tanking ?It just broke into the 60's seconds ago !
time to dump this. getting arrogant about these social issues when they don't stick to business PEs too high and hit the high of the year it's time to say bye-bye will dump tomorrow same way i dumped tgt and their toilets .
Short sighted activist fights are never good for a company. There are many publicly traded companies that got ruined. Just the contest alone to get a seat has cost PG $60 million!!! Let's see what happens to GE. Got a feeling HON is headed down the same path.

Hi all! I’m seeing that ACB is paying a 12.41% dividend yield on RH. Can anyone verify this or is it a glitch??

I pulled out a new Wilkensen Sword triple blade razor today. The last one only lasted ten months. You cannot do that with brand B. They rust in the shower and cannot be stropped properly. There is a lot to be said for fine stainless steel forty cent disposable razors.
I believe the weaker US dollar should help PG.
"Funny, don't seem to hear much chatter from you arrogant Longs today? I love proving arrogant, self-righteous people wrong. I took 10 contracts off...and HOPE there is a bounce up, so I can put (get it...PUT) them on again."
Record high today! Trump tantrum has got investors predicting more toilet paper hoarding.
"The whole metoo BS revolves around a bunch of Hollywood megalomaniacs, and to make this an indictment of all men is simply a gross perversion of reality."
Waiting for it to bottom and I will double up. Ka-Ching!
"14 years and counting just another earnings day down, now no McDonald, no Lafley, but we got one just as worse Taylor and let's not forget Moller is still there that is why PG is becoming the all time and let me get this right. (. DOG. OF. THE. DOW. )."
Does anyone have a good explanation for why PG is holding up so well? I would think that tariffs would have a disproportionately large effect on a multi-national company like this.
"Well, that didn’t go well."
Want in on some hot income producing stocks that have been overlooked by everyone else? Just Goooogle https://one2beatz.wixsite.com/lion .
"If Peltz was really interested in the right things for P&G, then why do they not have recommendations on the other proposals? The only recommendation Trian makes is ""vote for me"". He is in it for himself and nothing else."

"Up 7 straight months....ALL-time high is $94.67....RIGHT HERE. I just doubled my Dec. 14th $94 PUT buy at 20 contracts....bought 10 at $1.38 now. NOTHING GOES UP FOREVER and when it stops, it will be SWIFT!!!!!!!!"
Deutsche presentation tomorrow could shed some light on year end numbers. Lets hope Moller has some good news to share.
"How is everyone doing?Compare PG to costco, xom, GE and slb, PG is cheap.I have said it many time."
The PG add is the brain child of Marketing Director Pankaj Bhalia. Just read about him on LinkedIN. PG is going to learn a hard lesson in Marketing 101. Never introduce politics in an Ad about consumer products. Negative reaction to the AD according to Forbes is running very high. Should be see how it impacts the stock and Gillette sales. I threw away my Gillette razor two years ago. Quality isn't there and razors and blades are way to expensive.
"An article in the Cincinnati newspaper reads about Kroger, the nations largest grocery chain, has just come out with their own line of shavers and shaving products to compete with Gillette. Kroger has been very successful in selling their own line of store branded products that compete with more well known brands. Just another nail in the coffin for Gillette. It is really sad how this wonderful brand was so mismanaged."
"As a PG shorter for the last 4 months, I just wanted to thank everyone! Especially those who purchased over 140. Do not say that I didn't warn everyone, and give specific price targets. Took profits with no interest remaining."
I see a lot of speculation about a split? It seems to me that having a stock price over a hundred dollars per share seems to the in-thing right now. I'm not gonna hold my breath about a split.
I suppose the drop today is due to the Billie issue. P&G never had to pursue that. Clear indication of trying to corner the market. The government stepping was inevitable.
After one pumped up earnings report we are back to normal still working on the great plan.
"If you have 100 shares of P&G and it splits, yes, you do have the same amount of money, but every time it goes up $1 you make $200 instead of $100 on your shares. See the difference?"
"stop posting only because morns like wooglin or osulinrool keep posting PG has been a dog for over11 years and still is and is run by MORONS like the 2 we have, Have had PG since 72, never bought a share since 2009, and never will take div foe last 7 years and go elsewear, if you smart do the same if not, your just like wooglin & ouslindrool two morons ou of touch and have no life"
"Is anyone else curious how the ""sno"" family has voted their massive block of PG?"
Tomorrow x dividend
"when the 'yield curve' inverted, meaning 3 month T-Bills are now paying more interest than 10 year T-Notes. When the yield curve inverts it usually means a recession is on the horizon?."
"Great opportunity to buy here! Way, way oversold! The RSI below 30 - that's ridiculous. Earnings were very good! Future looks very good as well!"

Carter Worth saying SELL PG...over extended and Guy Adami says OVER VALUED....both say it is due to check back 5-7% easily. I say it pops on numbers and rolls over by end of the day.
"I blame Nelson Peltz for the drop today since he has been causing Pg to fight him which is wasting my money. I put a hex on him. Go Pg Show Peltz you can run just fine like you have for years without him. If his ideas are so good and he owns so much stock he will want you to do well, so he can just email his fantastic improvements. I just put a hex on him."
"Bought Bic razors for 1/5 the cost, thanks Gillette. Also blades for Gillette were getting more dull over the years yet price was increasing. Delete this comment and next I will make a YouTube video and really take Gillette to the cleaners."
Maybe the upper management should have split the stock when it was at 146.

Trump firing good competent people and replacing them with loyalists. Kiss your government goodbye.

Amazing this fell more than JNJ did today. Maybe P&G should add asbestos to some of it's products.

Called P&G investor relations to ask about Taylors position on stock spilts and was told he does not support a stock split for several reasons. Was hoping to ask him during the annual shareholders meeting next week and the man from investor relations stated he already knew Taylors thoughts on the matter as he had already discussed it with him. Both Apple and Tesla shares have climbed since their splits. Best of luck
PVHO looks like it is about to break higher. Take a look at the most recent press. The company just received some major coverage from intel. In addition to that they just had record revs last Q of over 1mil. This is the type of growth stock that only comes around once in a while

I know my 92 year old Mother in law just threw them all away and didn't vote her shares at all because she was totally frustrated? The SEC should clearly get involved in how this was all handled by the company!

This is brutalI should never have bought this stockI thought Nelson Peltz would have made a difference. I now hope that he will shake things up

"If your one of the “little guys” it will take twice as long to buy a share , So what, your stock value stays the same with a split. Back in the day, one bought in blocks of 100. This is not true.

I must ask the ""expert"" of all things related to the Dow and its Dogs (you): why do you think the writer cited ""8"" Dogs of the Dow vs the conventional 10?"
i should have sold this pig before earnings now its going to 50
was thinking of buying at 85 but i dont like the was the company is headed
"Trian will be good for Procter. The goal of 20% outsiders should help remove the entrenched bureaucracy. PG has a reputation for being a good employer and promoting from within but the company still struggles with new and progressive ideas even when they come from their own employees. Once these new policies are implemented things will begin to improve. There may have to be some layoffs, especially in management, to accelerate the process. Trian may move too slow and management will be resistant so it will probably take years to implement significant improvements."
"P&G pumped up the earnings report last quarter before the proxy battle, we will see if gets back to normal with the one coming up."
Nice. Buying at these levels
can I buy PG tomorrow 10/21/2020 and still get dividend?
Its looking like 'sell before the good news/earns'. Remember July... then Aug. before that? BIG institutes trading PG like they trade IPO's. Its the sign of the times. I'm way long here... unless it drops more than 8% from high. Then I will be selling half position.
PG or CHD? Both look like big value long term. They should get noticed soon as safe havens.

No worries as stock price being manipulated - Hedge funds want to buy more at lower price then stick it to retail investors... Good time to stock up with dividend increase coming.
"Nice downgrade, Jeffries. Coincidentally, PG typically announces their dividend payout the 2nd Tuesday of each quarter. Since the previous announcement was Tuesday April 10th, one would presume that the next announcement is tomorrow. Great timing!"
"please sell it off again, trading 700 shares thank yoooo smart money lol"
"All the hoarding will hurt in at least 2 ways:1) People who really need First Aid/health products cant get them and get sicker, lose more work & $$2) Future sales will drop because hoarders are overstocked and no need to buy more for a long time."
What do folks think about P&G dividend increase next month?

Inflation is here..Big time.
Been stuck in the 128-129 range for weeks now! NEED TO Breakthrough THE 129 WALL!
How many friggin' proxy voting cards am I going to get? Enough already.
UBS is down 25% this year. Don't buy the UBS story. There track record speaks for itself. Its not very good.
Example of lame PC virtue signalling. White man bad. Everything else good. They will all pay for this one day soon.
I expect PG going for stock split around April ER..
"Love the new ad, buy"
Will hit 100 by Wednesday
"Hey Crust! Let long suffering longs have their day! Sell short all you want...Sell calls, buy puts you're so smart!!!"
"This time, we break 100 for sure..."
"Woglin3 and Ouslindrool just quit posting you own NOTHING, you both think Lafley was the best he was the worse CEO of PG and one of the WORSE ever CEO on wall st, and i have been saying PG is Dog of the DOW for last 9 years,and the tme proves it, 1% div again next year again GET DUMMIES, who cares what the high is today it was $90 2 years agom and even and i mean even if it splits it will mean NOTHING to smart shareholders, after next march 13 years later it is probably about time, but think how much has Lafley and Muller made in stock and salary, countless money, you 2 have are beyond the word STUPID, but i bet you have been told that before!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
What really sucks is as a retiree I am required (forced) to hold 40% of my 401 k in P&G stock. They have cost me over 20k in the past 2 months down 12% or so while the rest of of 401k investments are around 5% positive. This sucks! I feel I should be compensated in some way. Management loves to reward themselves!Hopefully Mr Peltz can change this pompous mind set.
when is PG going to spli?
are we on the rebound ? we are above 30 days MA . ~$76.00 will be above 60 days MA. To say we are bull we should hit 90 days MA . I hope to see this before I pass..........
Our household incomes have decreased since Trump. For fifty years our incomes increased..Trump is a bad omen.
I am up 11 points with PG. let's keep this train going and then I will bail while all the other late comers buy high. LoL
Oct 18-125 calls on fire
Pink & green makes the world go around!!!
"I agree with a lot of everyone's posts. I had a position in this stock did well for me. But their ideology on how they're going to derive sales is what spooks many, by raising prices on the consumer when there is really no tangible need to & the guidance going forward is not great,"
GREAT EARNINGS REPORT ...... should help us to keeping marching forward !
9 thumbs down on my call itll go red . almost there
Never to see 85 again
Walmart has double edge razors for fifteen cents.
"This is one of the most expensive stocks out there, should be selling for a PE of 15 or about $75"
"Think I will buy a few hundred shares, simply given the fact I worked for this company in the late '80's and sold my shares too early back in the day. This is a ""great American company"" that every portfolio should own. You may never get rich but you won't get burned, either. Nice dividends. Great products."
don't knows why this is up two and a half percent in after-hours but I'll take it
"Back into the 1115 117 range so perhaps the hedge fund folks have quit dumping , lets see if it gets in the 120,s , sure hope so."
Dont worry PG #40 on Corporate Debt Chart.
"RSI should fall into the 20s today if you’re thinking about adding more, today is the day. Should see a string of green starting tomorrow"
I keep buying at $110 and selling at $120. Easy money!
160 by Christmas
PVHO looks ready to go. This company was just featured in a whitepaper by intel where intel was very bullish on the companies tech. They also have major partnerships with national brands. This may seem like spam but take 5 minutes of your day and check it out.
3/30/2020 Upgraded by Jefferies Financial Group Hold -> Buy $130.00 -> $128.00
Why no one believes the news anymore. The loss of sales will show next quarter. Does anyone have any critical thinking skills anymore?https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/23/business/gillette-ad-procter-and-gamble-stock/index.html
Procter & Gamble reached an all time high at 141.09
"It would be nice if the Olympic podiums, partially made of recycled plastic, have a PG logo--unlikely though!"
I love tide it smells so good so I say buy
PG is up 4.90% to 118.78
Drops at the close everyday????
"Posting in CAPs, to quote you, is ""NOT GOOD"", but at least you have been consistent.Here's a bone: PG is worth over five times as much as KMB.In other words, simply comparing two company's share prices, in a vacuum, is folly."
Retail sales data will be positive tomorrow morning sending PG to atleast 120 by weekend
Makes me sick watching this stock go south for the last 6 wks! Think it’s time to go north!!! To good of a company!
auph breaking out
"The hike is not enough , my redder stock today ..."
"On yahoo the article was Should you buy dogs of the Dow of 2016? And yes Cat,Verizon,Pifzer, and of course PG. and it also says 2017 will have these stocks as dog of the Dow, a short answer is never buy PG, why not? lafley,Moller,Taylor, these are 3 good reasons and Wooglin & Blueto know all about pg!"
"XLP, which most of these stocks are part of shoulkd react negatively to the FED rate hike in December also, that and a strong dollar will cap this advance as well...........tooo many issues in my favor at this point....I LOVE THE RISK/REWARD at $94.5.....LOVE IT to the DOWN SIDE!!!!!!!!!"
Good company but it does seem over valued here. Insider selling as well.Definitely a great buy after a pull back
Does anyone know the results of all the proposals for the recent 2017 P&G shareholders' meeting?
Just 7 days and we have a proven business success as President not a Community organizer.
Zacks had a sell rating on this ..what a bunch of IDIOTS!
"eisen, faber, peltz, see any trend?"
WE DONT HAVE MONEY ! WE ARE IN 2008 !!!!!! READ NYTIMES !!!!
"Wooglin says buy pg, but he owns what 106 shares, got a clue people he doesn't"
There are better alternatives to every product they sell. Especially the overpriced Gillette garbage.
"Happy they had good earnings but it is strange how things work out sometimes, you have Pletz pushing for a seat on the board and drab earnings reports for it seems forever and all of a sudden earnings are way up but then figures don't lie. Do they?"
"I find it funny but not surprising at all the comments regarding the slight drop in P&G today. If there was any stock to ignore the short-term moves it would be P&G. Most shareholders of P&G don't worry about the daily, monthly, or even yearly moves of the stock. Our holding period is measured in decades."
Dumbest downgrade ever evidenced by no target price cut. UBS will live to regret this one. Bet on it.
sell panic sell panic sell panic
125 by next week
"Still waiting for something transformative to be announced to justify a significant stock price move upward. All we’ve gotten so far is the same old promise that they will do better, but not until the back half of FY19. Oh and retailers and consumers will have to bite on the 4 to 5 percent price increase on diapers and paper goods."
I’m always amazed at the stupidity of corporate america. The height of stupidity to take a political side and alienate half your customers. This is beyond that. I don’t know how many militant women buy their products but I’m guessing the majority of their customers are male. So now you’ve insulted the majority of your customers. What idiot thought this would be a good idea? Sold my shares today. I dont want anything to do with a company who lacks any common sense.
"I bet if JimCramer owns PG, he would have pumped PG to have PE of 32.. that 135.But hey.. ShiatMan."
"DEATH CROSS....50 day is ready to cross the 200 day............if you cannot see this, do not invest."

CNBC could not have pumped this stock anymore today if they had tried.
inversion to the mean. suggests $155.
PG looks good...but the real dividend aristocrat performer of the last 3 weeks has been T.
"As usual pg still dog of the Dow 14 years and running earnings lousy as ever, big boys paid as high as it goes, and not a stock you want to buy, no stock in history as been this bad."
"P&G just invaded the men's locker room with snowflake, pajama-boy, over-sensitive tripe.I'm for kicking P&G out of there completely."
MIKE -The market doesn't care what you THINK ... it does what it does ... it takes your money!
It’s okay. Slow and steady. Like a snail. Bonds 1.5 ... I’m staying here for now.
margin calls tomorrow for the markets....they will HAVE to sell their winners (PG)!!!!!!! Short 1000 shares at $93.6 with a stop at $95!!!!!
"A lot of stock is in bubbles, ok..."
PG will hit 140 before it splits for the first time since ......
Peltz selling shares is taking this down
Holding up nicely in this market - long term holders know it’s going higher - follow the smart money
$120 is in the way. I may add more there.
This is just getting frustrating. I do not understand why Wall Street doesn't like companies that make money anymore.
"selling all my shares...sadly, this stock has only given me 7% return with dividend. Fear this will go below 80s again"
"PG price is a buy. It’s not a heavy momentum stock like a tech stock. Rather more of a safety net which pays dividends. When investors take earnings, PG is where they add. Specially with the decent dividends.It’s my belief as they re-evaluate their supply chains and demand, price will climb on their products. Leading to higher revenue. Next quarter will be a strong one."
"If P&G sold Gillette, any ideas on what it would fetch?"
DONT LIT GT HIGHER SHORT IT
I personally think he would have helped the company but hey we will see
Peltz has been to one Board meeting. Did anyone expect overnight change?
"Yet, another 52-week high! EVEN SWEETER!!"
Cant complain today haha

The vote was very close; .02%.Insiders own .06%--which way do you think they voted?
Expect a higher demand for Pampers in nine months.
Safe place needed in bad times...
"Owned PG before and sold it making a profit, but always liked the products it sells. Every household uses PG products and their dividend history is outstanding, so yesterday was a good entry point for me and now I am a shareholder again."
Will close green. Pullback is over.
PG - my favorite stock.
We the people have spoken.
"OT:kevin: ""Have a Coke and a smile"""
. I
"PG is slowly but surely getting into where it would have been with price based on earnings alone, without investors moving money into it to hedge against Covid uncertainty. My gut feeling is, around $135 by mid-Dec, stable after that."
The premarket selling was ridiculous. Who are these crazy people? They ought to give up trading. I DOUBLED UP!
"Utterly disappointing, why is Disney bigger than PG? Unbelievable, fundamentals don't matter anymore in this market."
Perhaps their strategy is to sell more of their Venus razors to women who love seeing P&G emasculate men.
Earnings on the way... rise!
"Like I said back at $92, see ya at 58-59 and you all snubbed the idea. Morons"
When Procter and Gamble trades at a 30 pe you are in a bubble.
"Short, short, short it."
what's the matter with men P&G?
"Voting for Trump and still supporting him , proves you are totally incompetent & should be committed!"
Good day to take some profits?
Buying Opportunity! Consumer Reports just rated Tide against all others rating it number one. P&G is the Mercedes of consumer brands and the consumer's pockets are flush with cash. IMHO Wall Street has this one wrong.
"""We're confident we have the right strategy and plans in place."" Seriously? Guess someone should tell Taylor and Moeller their strategy and plans have failed miserably. Where the heck is Peltz and his promises to stop P&G executives from getting outrageous compensations for such horrible performance. Another year of failed performance by any reasonable measure yet Taylor states in the annual report how they are confident of his strategy, unbelievable !!"
PG raised dividend today by 4% to $2.98/year
So the shorties are going to harp on the Gillette write down. They're wasting their time posting here.
"The company lost me with their attempt at social justice message. Like the vast majority of products you make are for men. Do you think men are going to be interested in feminine products? Also, a lot of the products they make are too expensive and of-typically-lower quality than their competitors. IS P&G headed towards GE direction? Likely."
"It took more than 18 months to get back to $94.This time, we want 100.."
"Long-term P&G holder here. Holding shares in a dividend reinvestment plan at Computershare.This stock had been a laggard for years. The dividend and SJM spinoff(since sold off) helped.Seems like management is on their heels, not their toes.Millennials and fickle consumers seem to confound P&G marketing.The days of "" soap opera "" homemakers buying armfuls of Tide and Dawn are long gone.My basis is so low (in the 20s) I'm a Zombie Long. Wishing that long-suffering longs see $100 prints soon. DJIA hitting highs, come on Procter!"
"Short it. The fake ultra-liberal dollars propping it up right now will disappear in a flash, just like all ultra-liberals will do in any crisis."
"1 year chart may be forming a half pan (no handle yet), but 5 year chart kinda sorta a pointy head and shoulders. Its all a Rorschach perspective. Unclear is the future of this boy lol. May the farce not be with you."
Dow goes closes plus 330 but leave it to PG to close down ....arggh
Sell your shares.The Marxists are on a mission to ruin P & G brands.
Wow !! Bill Clinton said she liked girls in college more than him. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dkrEIJDJt1s
Short it. Short it for 5 shares or 500. Short it and get paid for the worst marketing mistake in the history of advertising.
PG is an inflation adjustment stock... Pure and Simple. I meant proc and gamble
hope PG tanks 20%
nice chance last week to load up good stock to be in for the long
Traders are playing PG the last few weeks. they’re buying when the 9 day EMA dips below the 21 EMA and selling above it. It likely won’t stabilize unless it closes above the 200 day moving at $120.
"Hope she will keep the hype till the close, this time..."
"""To the many evangelicals who continue to support Mr. Trump in spite of his blackened moral record, we might say this: Remember who you are and whom you serve. Consider how your justification of Mr. Trump influences your witness to your Lord and Savior. Consider what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump’s immoral words and behavior in the cause of political expediency. If we don’t reverse course now, will anyone take anything we say about justice and righteousness with any seriousness for decades to come?"""
"I don't use Instagram, Twitter, FB noir other savage nonsense but will say this here: as long as I live I will NEVER use any PG products. There are many alternatives. Men, white men, are being savaged by sexist, stupid, ignorant, left-progressive inspired sexists and racists and I will not stand for that. Instructed my broker to sell all my PG which was substantial. Will never own it again and will switch to Braun electric shaver tomorrow."
"PG = Poor Gamble? ""Brace up yards you cack deck apes"". Get this ship sailing!"
What makes Nelson Peltz think he is God's gift to ceo's? He needs to spend time with his grandchildren or great grand children and leave business to those whose careers have given them the experience.
I don’t own this stock but wish I had the money to load up about 100 shares of it. Such a solid stock. Congratulations to everyone in PG today!
I got more shares because SP is down. Drips are good.
A split is usually done to make share price more affordable for the little guy.
Good day for PG. Interesting how the DOW didn't fair so well.
"Any of you peeps leave your door open at night? Are the walls surrounding Obamas, Zuckerbergs and Bezos' mansions immoral? 4000 arrests last year in Texas of illegals and 62% of those were sexual assault against children..... 23% of all federal prisoners are illegal aliens. More than half of illegals receiving your tax dollars in benefits. 2000 people a day just walk right in. Declare the emergency and Build the Wall to protect the safety and sovereignty of America and Americans. Jmo..........."
Nice move 
$150 year end.. nice beat and growth..
"PROCTER & GAMBLE CO (PG) Dividend, value: $0.75, date: 2019-10-17"
2nd. day in a row for another new 52 week high congrats again to patient longs.
"Wow! I finally found something I own that’s green!Even during a correction people will still brush their teeth, wash their hair and do laundry. Value stocks are the safest place to ride out a storm"
the 80 cent drop in the last 2 minutes can only be called manipulation by slimy characters. Add the 79 cent drop the stock will experience tomorrow morning for the dividend and you have over a dollar and a half haircut without any real trading. and there is no one watching the store!
the gringo that uses Spanish in the Gain commerical...idiot.
SHORT IT SELL SHORT IT LOL HAHAHAHA
PG is a growth company now..
SHORT DUMMIES DONT LET IT GO UP DONT BUY SHORT IT
P&G cleans up in Product of the Year competitionhttps://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2018/02/12/p-g-cleans-up-in-product-of-the-year-competition.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
"No stock split , as expected"
were all here for a reliable dividend.BUY and hold for life.
"Share price not an obvious logical reaction to the news, looks a bit like short selling to push down price before accumulation in anticipation of higher price in next few days or weeks. Bottom line: hold or buy."
"Procter & Gamble Company (The) lies in the middle of a narrow and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 12.16% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $88.70 and $92.45 at the end of this peri"
"let us see, if PG has the same pe as Costco.... $130"
Dividend increase for May?
"Break $100 for the first time since last splits, Snowcat...screwflation...."
Earnings were at the high end of the estimate range and up 17% yoy. Revenue came in 0.7% light. I’ll take that any day. Stodgy old PG is doing well despite the overall market’s profit recession. Focus on margins over revenue is good right now. PG is a good defensive play at the tail end of a long bull market. Easy choice - buying on weakness.
if you stay long you'll make good money. my in Price is_51.75. Long term investment and love the dibs.
"Old lady will raise again, no worries. 135 is a next stop, good cards on hand to play"
The price has steadily gone down since Pelz got on the board.
SELL OR SHORT HERE RIGHT NOW
"Stock market on fire! P&G goes DOWN, once again. Even #$%$ Warren Buffet does better than this #$%$ company."
http://seekingalpha.com/article/4007911-leverage-procter-and-gamble-tender-offer-annualized-returns-200-percent
wow this will hit 90 faster than i predicted
Company hit the ball out of the park last quarter. Buy.
"Amazon goes up and will go down, It is nature law."
PG raised prices too much and they need an outsider to point this out. Trian will do.
Once you buy - sell covered calls for big money on a weekly basis !
Posted 10/13/19“David2/2/20 sp will be 167... mark my post.”Not quite 167!
140 before bear market.
Will we see 100 today? :)
When I was a kid they sponsored the Saturday Night Fights on TV. Snowflakes run Gillette now. Nuts.
Promise?
If every man is toxic then every woman is crazy.Now we can be at peace
locked and loaded with 300 shares at 111.29:)
I thought the Gillette ad was going to bankrupt PG? What happened to all the boycotts? lol!
Safety stock. Market down over 2% yet P&G higher. Defensive stocks are late cycle standouts...
"For those that care about technicals, PG is oversold at 30 RSI which is generally where I look for opportunity. If you are looking to add to your position, this would not be a bad price. May go a tad lower over the next day but would expect it back around $135 by the end of next week."
Wooglin let me guess soros is also your buddy like lafley. Figures
"OK, so PG just broke below the 50 day moving average of $120.50. Given the upgrade from JPM, it should act as support and bounce up, which would make it a good buying opportunity for those of you just getting in. However, if you're long and up over 25% already, I'm putting a stop limit at $119. Since there's a .745 dividend coming up this week, I'm hoping she holds above $119.75. If not, I'll cover my losses."
Don't worry guys! Procter and Gamble is revving up sales with a brand new campaign!
SANP try and short this...
"This company has stirred up a small group of a few hundred thousand activists who are EXTREMELY dedicated and will never forget and never stop working for justice. Until P&G is no more, there will be an army looking underneath every rock to find skeletons in the company closet. If this is a typical big company with lots of dirty secrets, God help them."

Very encouraging!
Had to sell this junk stock at a loss. Market’s up 350 and this one’s down?
CVS looks like similar PG trade 3% dividend institutionally owned low peg ratio (growth potential) and sizable short interest ... squeeze candidate
Company is more concerned about woke movement than their job. I wonder if its a signal its time for a shake up
#PG Rising with heavy volume. Looking for breakout at 96.50 for a run up to 112.71. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/PG.gif
PG is down 7.76% to 102.93
115 open tomorrow
I’m 100% sure this will hit its 52 week high this week before weds
Adding shares at $131.20. Buyback plan should give us roughly a 3% boost.
I sold this crud and put the money in XLU. Its already making a great move. Check it out!!
"While ""The Ad(s)"" not only didn't bother me, I thought they were well done. The palm oil allegation (fact?) of PG knowingly importing various derivatives sourced partially by forced labor does concern me. Both, from a humane and an investment perspective. If this story has legs, the headlines (who reads the text anymore?) could stir up some legitimate social pushback. That said, I'm not naive; such labor practices exist and probably more so than I can fathom."
"Tough day for PG. Tough day for the DOW, too."
"Underperforming because the rest of the market is just too exciting right now, it’s the only reason why. When the market isn’t green every day people will move back into stocks like PG. Selling millions of products every day, all products found in essential stores. Q2 will be staggering."
Good jobs report this morning confirming there is no recession. PG at all time high and no split ... I am out for time being.
"Higher the Price, lower the Yield. The Yield is at 2.97% at this price. There will be a massive selloff soon. Sacrificing Principal and Yield at these levels is a dangerous game. I sold my last shares as of today. The lower Yield Percent will hit the Presses real soon."
We're broke...no money
"With the DOW and S&P each down 4 and 5 % YTD and P&G down over 16% it seems clear that management has not instilled any confidence in their ability to correct P&G,s problems. It would seem that if the dividend increase is not at least a 5% increase with rising interest rates and bonds rising as well there would simply be no reason to invest in this company. The BOD and Peltz better get this thing turned around or a break-upon the company will be the only option left for shareholders."
No ones complaining anymore
charmin off our costco list. no tide.
All the moving averages are converging right now still in a clean upward arc. I suspect we'll be in a holding pattern until the next earnings announcement. I'll just sit back and wait for my divs.
the boycott is real. Gillette should be sold off.
Almost time to sell 20% of my stake again to buy back in at 120.
It cannot go up EVERY day in JULY....I would sell now and buy back lower....MUCH LOWER!!!!!!!!

Blame me for the drop. I stopped buying Gillette after 30 years. You figure out why.

I think PG stands for parental guidance...
PG is one of my retirement fund. So happy with the dividend increase!
could the $5/share loss have something to do with the CEO's visit to White House?
SPLIT----SPLIT-I LOVE Pg
94.50 at close
Just looked at monthly and three-month chart of P&G. Incredible! At a time when DJIA is setting new records daily? Was Bernie Madoff named CEO when no one was looking?
"I saw where S&P left their target price unchanged at $100 and Morningstar at $98. Does anyone have access to other major analyst opinions following yesterday's earnings (such as Citi, Morgan Stanley, Bof A, etc)?The stock is tanking and I just want to see what some of the analysts are saying after yesterday"
break out to 200
"Just bought my first 2 shares, will add slowly for the next decade"
"With 10 year on rise, pe will need to be closer to 14.5 to 15. Low70s is buy time. Of course if divvreinvest you will be good."
"Baby,,PG is Going UP Up and UP"
"More Family Dollar stores to close same as JCPenny, Chevy in Lordstown, Ohio closed it's doors..Not good folks."
"Back yo ATHs, back to growth"
Bit of a fire sale this morning. Looks like a lot of profit taking while the rest of the market is going up.
I'm looking forward to this stock tanking after the Gillette Super Bowl add infuriates customers.
The CEO telegraphed this last year - easy trade if keeping focused on the ball not the BS. That said - breaking 100 probably not this quarter.
"If PG is traded with same as as all the high PE stocks that Jim Cramer has,PG is traded at 120 already."
"I like Pg just the way it is. I don't want parts sold off. If a part of a company makes money, I don't care if it is a high growth area or not, I say keep it. I just like my dividend and I like PG products and I use them. Life is good and N. Peltz can go haunt another house."
"I'm not worried, cause I'm long term on this but it really irks me that a stock like $GME is up 22% because of memes, and we get upgraded and can't get up 50% because the market decides to have one of it's few red days."
"has the earnings report come out yet, TODAY? Haven't seen it anywhere."
$50 billion debt and no interest deduction. Six blades per razor is a tapped out gimmick. Stainless blades rust in the shower.
All the people involved in the Gillette advertising debacle should be fired. What a disaster!
"I've rarely seen a message board more obsessed with stock splits than this one. Back in the day, when stocks usually had 100 lot minimums, that made sense for companies to split their stocks, but today, there is no rational justification for splitting a stock, which is why they are so rare. Apple and Tesla split just to attract a wider range of novice, clueless investors that get excited when they can purchase more shares. On the other hand, most long-term, seasoned investors that own P&G are in it for the slow steady growth, and ever increasing dividends. It's that simple."
"As usual 155 pts up pg down again have we seen this so many times. Pg has been dog of the Dow for so long and still is use to be 7 years between splits and a split at$100 now it isn't even close last split was 14 years ago, only wooglin3 thinks pg has been on the track, but again he's been off track for years"
"brokers for PG r buying shares lower for the scheduled buyback, within 2 weeks approx this will revert back to the mean.. 137 to 140..."
Last push down before this explodes to 106 GET IN NOW!
Definitely new CEO
bullish this is a great time to buy.......
"""Cut Cost At Any Cost"" is catching up with P&G. Cost cutting and EPS is coming from reducing employee count, plus other things I would love to specifically mention, but can't. Then with EPS, they are using the tried and true cutting share count by share buybacks thus increasing the EPS. Definately sell if you have descent profits."
I don't know if P&G's 200-20-2 Business Model is working out as well as planned. At least they can buy highly profitable companies which will have around 5 years before the 200-20-2 business model takes a toll.
I sold so IM sure it will go up now
This is now the 3rd time I have sold 20% of my position at around 125 and bought back in around 120. I wonder when it will end?
I got a great offer in the mail today from Mason Bell LLC!They will generously pay me $106 for my PG stock currently worth $143!!
"overall spanking for my portfolio. My baby, PG was the hardest hit.How long to recover? I think 2-3 weeks out before we see $130s again."
Fight for green !
does that trade tariffs affect this stock
"There is very little love out there for this stock right now. Volumes are way down and it cannot seem to get any traction to make a move back to the mid 120,s or even high teens . Earnings were good and wondering if this is corna virus related or the fact the company lowered expectations a point from 4 - 5 to 3 -4 ? Year ends June 30th. and should be good, but seems to not matter what the numbers say ."
"wow, this has held up really really well. investors probably looking to names like $WM and $PG as safe havens if economy slows from here and other high flyers face gloom."

Imho S&P down some more and PG will get thrown out with the bath water like many other stocks.
Jeffries Analyst are idiots
Yes the 1 yr target is $90
0% percent revenue growth ?this stock is very overpriced imo !

i remember not too long ago when that idiot Jester was telling everyone to short this at $85. I hope no one listened and is now sitting on huge capital losses like that baboon....i guess they don't call him Dumbo for nothing...

"One of the things about boycotts is they take time to work. If the boycott is serious, the impact will be felt by the end of the year. People don't buy razors and blades every day so the impact is yet to really be seen."

"Booooya.. I don't think CMG deserves PE of 80... But then, I don't think PG can have PE of 30 either."
up 2.5% in afterhrs this will exploded into 130 range after ear5
$PG Looking to reenter around 111
"My fair lady didn't sell at $94. In fact, she didn't sell since little ice ages."
1-Year target for PG is 4.47 ? -- I think is a mistake!
Does anyone know what was said on the earnings call to make this blowout earnings report a piece of crud?
"Daily male routine: I'm gonna have breakfast, shave, and then go fight, mansplain, manspread, cut off and harass some women. Then I'll come home, have a BBQ and not do anything while boys tap themselves to death all while watching a sexist sitcom."
"Insiders sell for a number of reasons, not that they are negative on the company: exercising options, buying a house, balancing their portfolio, putting their kids in college, tax considerations."
price between 118 and 120 is a gift
S&P 500 52 week change + 12.9% P&G 52 week change - 15.5 % . Lets hope that at the next quarterly announcement we don't hear the same old tune about being on the right track. Dividend hike better be substantial even though management prefers stock buybacks .
"The coronavirus , is certainly horrible, but this is certainly a great buying opportunity ."
"You all care WAY too much about collecting a small dividend that comes off the share price.You can have 3% that comes out of the stock.I’m up 400% on Netflix and have gotten wealthy beyond my wildest dreams. The future is not PG my Amazon, AMD, NVIDIA, FB, and other tech names have been making me so rich I don’t even believe it. Lol. MeanwhileYou chase tiny dividends while your portfolios get crushed. Have fun losing money. I love when you lose money and I make so much!:)"
"SO LONG P&E, I'M BUYING NO MORE P&G PRODUCTS."
Get that slimeball Peltz off the board
I sure hope before Obama leaves office he is going to apologize for dividing the country the past 8-years pitying blacks against whites can Christians ️against Muslims. I bet Obama never will. It was his plan from the get-goI bet the Arrogant Obama won't
"Hahaha.Finally, you turned red too.next step would be down back to $70.Forget about finding a customer from out of U.S."
I threw out 6 bottles of Gillette Shaving Creams. i am switching to Harry's
Going back to $82.50 to fill the gap sooner that everyone has thought...
back to 115:)
When and where will we finally bottom out? This has been straight down since the earnings conference call. We've come from about 78.50 to 71.50. They're supposed to make $4.50 eps in 2019 and it's trading in the lower areas of historical p/e rationsThis is getting into bargain territory now
"Looking at the chart of PG has been going sideways from 80 thru 83 more or less, today PG had more volume than regular days, this is a good sign. Hopefully we will continue going up."
Have not had a raise since Trump. We had to switch to generics.
Consumer stocks will have their day in the sun again.

"From BoA/Merrill Lynch today: We raise our PO on PG to $119 from $112 as we roll forward our unchanged 24x target P/E now on CY20e EPS. We believe PG’s recent improvement in performance can sustain with incremental savings offering flex to margins, justifying valuation above historical averages, in our view. Active managers remain underweight."
Any thoughts on how much farther this stock drops?
Been way too much drama in this company. Soap and household items. That's it! People buy this for retirement and dividend safety. Retirees don't need drama and a price flying up and down 3%. Checking out CL & CLX. Bye
Go figure.
128 after earnings!
"The more Peltz babbles, the farther the stock drops this morning."
This #$%$ was less than 1% green today but it couldnt resist getting back to F red again. its in vain having hope to see this leggard green. its just dropping every damn day
"WMT must be pushing Persil (the German detergent maker) When I was in WMT yesterday, they had a cart set up in the cleaning supply area with Persil on it and a WMT person handing out a $2 coupon. I frankly don't care if they are giving the stuff away, I am buying Tide and supporting an American product. The WMT person told me it is made by Dial and is a US company, I told him I would look it up, but I am a loyal Tide person. So, he was right about they have a US office, but it is a brand owned by Henkel which is German. I don't plan to support German companies over American ones. The next time I am in Walmart, I am going to tell him. I don't plan to shop aldi or the new one Lidl either. Shop American."
Market gave them a pass as earnings in line with no “specials”. As others have also noted the stock will continue to melt up through rest of year. Watching their budgets.
130 would be nice tomorrow...
"The coronavirus outbreak is not good. But, what do you do? Hold (or shorts buy again right now) and wait for it to hit $127+ again next week."
"Ok, confessional. I'm a dingbat when it comes to this stuff, so could someone please explain what this ""debt tender offer"" thing is, and how does it impact PG or not?"
P&G has plans to raise prices on some of their products even though they have lost market share in some of these brands. Where all all the new innovative products that R&D is paid to develop? With billions and billions being spent on R&D what is wrong with this division of P&G?
"I love P&G, I also bought small position in MZOR....worth a look !!!"
MONDAY will be a terrible day for PG....when investors realize what is starting with Staples they will flee this OVER VALUED and OVER BOUGHT POS quickly.......down $2 on Monday....mark it down!!!!!!!!
Dammit!! thi stock does nothing but go down all because of Peltz
"Watched the commercial a number of times. The number of underlying messages intended or otherwise is extremely insulting to put every male into one bucket, imagine doing that to women - how wrong that would be. Looked around the house at the number of P&G products, made a list of what we won't be buying from P&G anymore. The Director of Marketing and the ad agency should be fired. Understand the woman that made the ad is an extreme feminist and has done similar type ads before. The CEO is running a company, internally he needs strong HR policies but to use the company as a political weapon is extremely wrong and shareholders should be very displeased with him for the potential damage he has allowed to happen to the P&G brands."
Nice move today! 
Come on down to the the 69 dollar range.....daddy will happily buy and hold
Got out 5 months ago.
sell evrythong markets are going to crash very soon
BOYCOTT GILLETTE !
"Proctor and gamble is great but at 300bln + market cap is there really much upside potential left in the next couple years? I guess you could say it could be 400 or 450 bln but I'm guessing it could be a long time before this stock doubles or triples again. I mean, right ?"
PG is an exceptional cash flow machine which is perfect for times like these
"I would like to know how each board member reacts to entering politics with commercials. I resent this. I own PG. I will vote my shares accordingly. This, in my opinion was a bad decision."
keep dropping till after Oct or till next Jan. hopefully
All the Idiots selling will be crying when this shoots back to 125 after earnings
"Have held PG since 1972 grandfathers have been PG shareholders since 1950, no shares have been bought since 2009 now. Do You Get Why PG is so poorly run that is why PG. is DOG OF THE DOW, and now going on 14 years PG has gone no where, and until we get current people it will go no where"
TIME TO SHORT.near ALL-TIME HIGH....WAAAAY OVERBOUGHT....JUST LIKE MCD LAST WEEK!!!!!!
I see PG can go up without N. Peltz's help.
This stock goes down just about everyday
 CNN Fake News reporter made a fool of again. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=jXdzI53AUok&itct=CBAQpDAYASITCMeEoPrc09ICFYH3qgodgAYMezIHcmVsYXRlZEiOj8vAv462lq0B

nothing good about this stock

"Bloomberg tried to explain the low birth rate. They claimed it was because of lack of capital and large college loans. Kids are moving back home after college to live with their parents. Bloomberg never touched on health care cost.....which is the one thing that effects all families. College loans do not. Not everyone has college loans, buy all families must have insurance. How does Bloomberg tippy toe around Obama so much. Why can’t they just call it like it is? Unbelievable!"
p/e well north of 22 even with increased earnings estimate
"short position. Amazon going after paper products.. instead of carrying out huge wholesale Bounty and Charmin products, Amazon's highly rated products are being delivered. PG sponsors links at top of amazon page.. so if they make a sale via amazon they have an extra cost for the ad..many other products highly competitive environment.. products like razors hit a price peak"
I wonder how many shares Mr. Peltz is selling off?
I think $137 is a good entry point for this one...then average down if necessary
Will add more under $127
Gotta love our CEO. Dude has staying power.
Can anyone tell me if there has ever been a an 804% increase of cash and cash equivalents from one quarter to the next in any publicly traded company?
I was wrong thinking that the selling had been exhausted. We’re still probing for a bottom
Why do my non offensive posts not stick?
"Stock has performed really poorly since earnings, go figure ?"
Every day with P&Gs performance I anxiously await the reasoning of the the cup cake boards decision to give the CEO and his minions a 25% pay raise. Didn't pay raises used to have something to do with job performance?
The folks complaining here lately .. I hope you bought more on the dip last week. Time to relax and hold now.
PG reached an all time high at 101.53
on to 170
knew this Could be happening but have never thought that it could be so low.
"Guys it’s not a conspiracy against you, it’s called “sector rotation” Clorox is dropping too.PG spiked during COVID and now is going down as Wall Street moves on to different sectors, (EV, semiconductors, Oil, etc)Coming here and whining everyday or blaming the CEO won’t change anything.

Gloablists want every nation and every person to be equal. Qualifications and hard work don't apply. Innovation and success suffers. The end game is one world government and currency. Everyone is a slave. To achieve this they must take out the white male worldwide. That's why every European nation suffers an immigration crisis as do we now.

First PG stock split since the great recession coming up.

Does PG finish up or down today?
Dollar Shave Club picked up a new customer. Boycott P&G
morning selling
PG must have had lots of retroactive foreign cash brought back to keep them a float. burn them all and it will be dead.
put your money to work!
Lol throwing my Gillette away. Only way to teach these companies a lesson is to hit them where their wallets hurt.
I bought 400 shares at $126 during the pullback a few weeks ago. Sold today for 136.80. PG is a great company. Decided to sell as I’m pretty overweight in my portfolio with consumer staples stocks. Go PG!!
"Isn,t it the CEO,s responsibility, and P&G has two now with Taylor and Moeller, to find out why the stock price has fallen so badly and correct the problems?

He gave no indication he was going to find out why and what he was going to do to correct the issues."

"CAN YOU SAY ""OVER VALUED AND OVER BOUGHT""? SURE YOU CAN!!!!!!!!!!"
P&g has enough money to figure out their product line to market towards millennials. In the meantime I’m collecting those dividends. Compounding money is a beautiful thing.
Bought more at $136.00 today!
Thoughts on how low this goes? Setting new 52 week lows every day now.
"Native: ""P&G's first acquisition in eight years.""There's been a lot of off loading of brands by PG, but I'm surprised it hasn't bought anything during the past eight years."
GREEN by close.
"On another big day, PG starts green, but can't hold onto it."
A few price upgrades pre market. PG will be fine.
too pricey in this environment.
I hate this CEO and management team
Get WOKE go BROKE
I wonder if the cut cost at any cost business model will continue to deceive. I'm just wondering what the profit margins were for the acquisitions such as Gillette. I'm willing to bet that the profit margins declined since P&G bought them out. They are selling off brands because their cost cutting programs have depleted the profit margins. The derailment doesn't happen over night.
wow I should have got more
"Selling the news? Election time is coming. This is a Dividend Holding Stock, as the price goes up, the Dividend Yield decreases. Good luck."

"An interview with David Taylor in Davos tried to give a great spin to the quarter; China, Brexit and the US govt. shutdown.

The main positive is the amount the stock has already sold off."
No longer a PG customer and switched to BIC shavers back in February. I am saving money and the BIC disposable is almost as good a product. Most of my buddies switched to Harry's or BIC.
"P&G has 5 divisions. Only 2 are valuable in terms of profit margin: Beauty (19% of Sales / 23% of Earnings) and Grooming (10% of sales / 14% of earnings). Therefore if you really want to hurt P&G (i.e. get woke / go broke), these are the products to boycott: Beauty (Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Rejoice, Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II), Grooming (Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, Venus). Of course there are more products in the other three areas to get to also, but concentrating efforts on their most profitable products is the best bang for your buck, pun intended.For more information, visit https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/80424/000008042418000055/fy171810-kreport.htm"

My biggest holding for a reason. Earnings should be good.
PG busily retreating after a big up-move in the PM.
"rust said we won't see 85. I would recommend everyone either mute or mock rust. An obvious unintelligent idiot, deserves scorn or deletion."

So I guess the dividend is safe then :-) Fantastic numbers. Dividend will go up again next year as always.

"OK, I will not order from Amazon."
Looks like bad news for KC is good news for us!
lets go baby 112.50 got some today Nelson's with ACB will be a great thing for both.
what is going on ? pull back?
Judging by the massive buying at the bell I would say tomorrow’s report will be positive.
I was actually able to Short 400 shares at $93.66 and cover at sub $93 for quick $300 profit...I knew it was a bogus rise!! Still holding 20 contracts of the December 14th $94 PUTS!! This chart is TOAST after today!!!!!!

Please correct me- but I received a Gillette and Smuckers spin-off and safe dividends since owning the shares. I've made $$$. Blue chips rule!
bada bing
PG stockholders are reacting like a bunch of hysterical little girls. The Gillette ad will NOT destroy their business.
"I threw all my Gillette products in the garbage and sold my PG shares today. Also called customer relations to complain about their PC BS. Make ‘em pay, brothers!!!"
back to 88dollars...lol
Can’t wait to see this at 108
Everybody know PG is a buy right now. Sorry to all you losers. Good luck!
PG is a staple holding. Still accumulating.
"All I can say is I work for P&G in one of their plants. I’ve never seen it this busy in 15 years. Every line is staffing up, and they are predicting growth for the next 5 years. Covid has changed everything."
if the stock splits I'm going to buy 300 shares
PG surging (up over 3.5%) today after 2nd quarter revenues and earnings beat. Results would have been even better if not for recent dollar increases against foreign currencies. Guidance also raised for the balance of fiscal 2017. Not much to complain about if you own PG shares.
Split this stock NOW!!!
this stock sucks the worst down every day
"One means of determining the future success of PG is the shelf space it occupies at the big stores: Sam's WMT, TGT. Costco, Kroger, etc. Plus it has enormous brand recognition. People keep buying the same brands because their parents and grandparents did."
I saw it on ameritrade instantly drop 7 dollars then bounce back up
142 by mid April
Loved the support in the $131.60 range. I believe that was the bottom even if it trades lower tomorrow ex-dividend.
"This stock should be doing much better than this. What do you all think? Is there something going on we should know about, I better check the news. Probably a huge sell off."
next stop 112.00
Nelson you putz...do something....anything......PG is sick and getting sicker. Not a good idea to sell off 100 brands....what happened to the proceeds? I am guessing $$$$ was wasted on management bonuses and option buybacks.....sure didn't help the shareholders...fire all the lazy managers and start over.......please
Will this go back down? and how far?
74$ !!!!!! Hopefully this will continue. Hopefully PG MIS-management is reading this board!!!
IF IT DOES WONT GO TOO HIGH
PG products are pretty much made locally around the globe. No worry about tariff..PG continues to move up. (cheaper than Costco..)
"takes two years of cutting unpeforming assets, now PG is ready to grow like P&G"
"Unfortunately those that professed to being upset over PG's ""We Believe"" ad are mostly long gone, onto their next troll target.I'd be interested in what they, and others, think of a petition that is circulating to have PG cancel its stadium naming rights contract with the Patriots based on Kraft's legal issues. The current contract is valid through the 2031 season. Who knows how effective having Gillette's name on the stadium etc. is, but I'm thinking given how GREAT the PATS have been for the many years they have played at Gillette, that PG got a decent deal. Think how many times Gillette stadium is on television compared to less competitive teams. Lots of exposure. On the flip side, I imagine if PG bailed, Kraft would be able to command MORE dollars for the naming rights for the next 12 years (unintended consequence of the petition LOFL!).https://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/2019/03/05/should-gillette-take-its-name-off-bob-krafts-stadium/3070723002/"
Why is this down again when the market is rebounding?
"Just added PG to my list of companies I will never buy from the rest of my life, along with Nike, and Ben and Jerks ice cream. Too bad, I'll start buying my razors from the dollar store from now on. I refuse to support liberals..."
I should of jumped into this 100 years ago....
87.40 at close
So do people/investment companies tend to sell shares of PG when the market goes up so they can buy shares elsewhere? Really been noticing an inverse trend here between PG and the market.
Peltz has a nose for this type of thing. He smells blood in the water here.
PG with a PE of 27 compared to a company such as Pepsi with a PE of 15.
Want the best trade tips? Just Goooogle ULTIMATSTOKCALERTS .
"This run is heading to 140.. ( after split, it will be 75)"
So when is Peltz going to kick the PG BOD bozos in the rear to get them to move off the dime.
WHAT A COMEBACK!
Bye bye PG. I really liked your razors too
this pig should blast to 84 after earnings
higher and higher interest rates but lower and lower quarterly earnings is going to knock PG down to where it belongs. Low $70s levels.
Obviously pg will be back up just like any company of this quality in consumer goods but it could easily go down to main support at $126/share.
"Thinking about buying, but then again go woke go broke :-)"
"Ok so this is such a huge problem that P&G needs to address it, they just can't help themselves but take the moral high ground. Will they be addressing the federal deficit? war? the opioid crisis? anything else? anything?"
When will be the DIVIDEND announcement?
Procter & Gamble is down 7.76% to 102.93
"At least with tariffs, PG has a new excuse to justify another year of under performance."
"It's the old Bear, Bull. Pig cliché: Peltz made a bundle and is getting out. That doesn't mean the fundamentals for PG have changed any. Tide and Downey still are big sellers. Maybe 160 by 12/31/2021"
$PG is testing the bottom 100 day ma. Time to buy in even more.
Well someone with big money thinks this is going north of $80. 20k order for jan 2019 options filled today. That is a 4.5 million dollar investment that will only be profitable above $80 a share in january

UH OH...XLP selling off quietly now...COST at daily low.
everytime that idiot Jester appears here bashing away it goes up !!! it's the same everywhere he goes....he's a great hedging 'tool' - just always do the opposite - no doubt the clown will be back here again shortly humiliating himself yet again...

"guys, #$%$?"
this is one of my I don't worry about stocks though it is confusing as to why the price is down when it should be climbing but I think the next quarterly results will look really good and overall annual will continue to be a steady performer
Andrew... I'll be honest-I bought for earnings. we'll see what happens.
Will thr big mutual funds keep this horrid board and CEO employed or will they vote to get rid of them?
Trian selling?
(PG) is dropping faster -->> target US$7.50 - US$25.00
Amazing this stock continues it's negative beta action. Sooner or later it will get hammered. Generic branding from competition will prevail as consumers continue tightening their belts as with the restaurant indexes.
"if you have noticed, PG's last report was very positive ... just to cheat and attract more investors....eversince pg has reported its forth quarter, its been dropping like a rock. U guys please tell me... cnsidering corona virus (which has help pg tremendously for its cleaning products), plus a positive report, how ome every damn day its dropping ???!!!!!please get out of this garbage before it is too late.good luck 2 all"
The daily chart is indicating bull flag. I’m long!
Shall see 100
$100 then stock split for the first time since the great recession.
Great buying opportunity !!!
Going to 77 by end of week!
Silence in the face of evil is itself evil. God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.
Not agreeing with market action but the reason PG is down is because growth slowed from last qtr.
s week ago when I see PnG at $79 I would cry but today when I see it at $79 I laugh.
This is like watching paint dry.
Peltz has helped PG see the future which it is now embracing. Buy.
Is 123$ good to invest for a year expecting 138$ at the end of the period?
It is going to hit $140
"Split! Split! One more split would make life super comfortable! It’s possible if it keeps holding near/over $100. Plus, we’re about due for a split"
This is a beat down!!!!!! To lose Principal to get a Dividend. Is that a fair trade? Its almost as dumb as getting a 30 year Mortgage.
"Well here comes earnings for the 57th time since 2004 and with Cramer say buy PG, probably for the 57th time as usual he changes his mind like he changes his you know what,PG is at a loss as usual last two days, and when they paid a decent dividend for the first time in many years guess what is coming, ya thats right they will make numbers, Moller will say were on the right track like he has for many years and PG will be down again. PG will go into 2019 as it has been Dog of Dow do not think it wont"
When is the next dividend payable? Thanks
"All my razors went in the trash this morning as soon as I seen this stroke of brilliance, call me names and expect my business.......think again."
"Why aren't PG historical prices available? Any hint? I can download for any other tick but not PG, which only goes back to April"
Red sea rising. The only wave Gillette will surf this quarter.
Target 112.00
Crazy - you have to go back to 2013 to find a sustained period of share prices around $70. Results are not great but hardly merit a slide undoing 5 years of price gains!!
SELLING the RIPPS here today !do not trust markets !
"New cases of COVIS-19 could break out over weekend in places like Georgia, which could send sentiment back to safety, and plays like PG to hide out as comes clear sumemr is going to be a wash"
Outstanding Performance!
"The street is going to punish P&G a bit to get them off their high horse, The street wanted Peltz on the board and are not going to cut P&G any slack. After a decade of being basically flat they want results not more talk about their great plan."
"Risking Capital just to get a Dividend is not very smart. I sold at mid $93s....I go from P&G to Money Market Fund, I never lose Capital (MAYBE POTENTIAL) When P&G dwindles back to low 80s I trickle buy back in. I get lucky on $10 swings or more. Better than a measly Dividend. The last trade I made, I would have to have over a Million Dollars worth P&G Stock to have the Dividend pay what I made in P&Gs price swing. Buy and Hold, no thank you."
Breaking*** P&G releasing a robot assistant that will do laundry and with zero noise pollution****
Nelson Peltz strikes again!
Harry's seems to be SJW feminist radicals too. I need to find a list. Be careful and do your research.
All the report shows PG beats on stock repurchasing.
I exit except profit part which turn out 125 stock. Not selling those for years.
"when the junk stock , like GameStop goes up, good company like PG kept falling. Why?"
why down so much is it mexico tariff?
"I took their Metamucil for years and ended up with osteoporosis. They deny the connection, but it removes the calcium from your body. They advertise it like crazy."
"Because PG is repurchase? Then of course the company want to buy back at a lower price. After, every share will get more equity, and the price bounces up."
83 by Friday!
Its a toss up whether to hold or sell
Up 30+% in 2019. Check out the beautiful annual chart...
We broke 96 if it holds here we could see a break out into the 100s
market is crazy while this should be at all time highs they are buying oil stocks that losing as oil continues to fall perhaps it is because stupid machines running market.
"Probably not a screaming buy at current high of range...but PAR is right around the corner. Guessing we'll hit $100 before $90 again, imho. GL longs, shorts and in-betweeners."

I would like the board to release a statement to the share holders of how they justified giving Taylor and his minions a 25% pay raise last fall after the dismal performance of this company for the past decade.
"I'm brand new at this, trying to learn on my own.... is this the place to be for starters. Appreciative of any advice or input!"
Buy! 118 after earnings!!
New high for last 30 days - melt up continues
I will have to average way down to get out of this without losing money. I been holding for months and it just keeps dropping.

PG is under its 200 day MA ... very bearish. If this stock takes a significant hit over the next year there will be a small window to pick up a great company cheap. BUY ON FEAR !!!!
How much is PG reverse factored?
"Strong quarter, and conservative set-up for next quarter. For us longs, the caution is that we're nearing 52 week highs, and we'll likely see resistance at $128, which is where people have been taking profits. Ex-div day is next week, so people will be thinking twice about selling their shares so they don't lose the .79/share div. Soooooo, I'm gonna sell covered calls in the $126-128 range that expire on 4/24. Importantly, the limit will need to be above the dividend price. This way, I'll essentially capture the dividend immediately, and I'll take profits if the shares get assigned. Then when the shares drop back down to low 120's... I buy again!!! :-)"
"My concerns about PG exactly. I have held onto it for 10 years and it is still hovering in the low 80's. Does anybody think it is at its all time high, peaked, so should be sold. What other consumer stocks might I consider - Clorox, Colgate, or Unilever? I thought maybe Yahoo as well which is being taken over by Verizon. Am open to suggestions here regarding Buy/Sell/Hold PG."

You know the market has lost bearing on reality when PG trades like a silicon valley startup.

I don't see any report of their guidance for 2019 on the report. Any info on this?
Can someone check on @snowcats today - getting worried .. 
Can’t imagine why anyone would short sell PG...with over 30 million unemployed and growing. In addition to strong demand for consumer staples...PG is a solid LT investment. Shorts would be better off trading cruise lines
"No revenue growth -- same revenue 2016-today. No earnings growth -- actually lower earnings today than 2016 and 2017.. PG overpriced. Deserves a PE closer to 15, not 25. Dividend is nice, 3% -- I guess that explains the lofty valuation.PG at new 52-wk high -- usually triggers selling the next day."
"Wooglin great idea you have, hard to believe Why not donate ALL the 92 shares you own of PG and we won't have to ever listen to you again, just don't tell your buddy Lafley and keep cutting his lawn"
Cramer actually laughed at how overvalued PG was the another night.
"I don't listen to Cramer at all. Now, overall portfolio $ value is up 10.5% over 2018."
"Due to inflation, we've had to switch to generics. Maybe PG makes them too?"
"All the chatter about change at P&G is an indication that the year will be another year of lower earnings and market share loss. You haft to wonder where would the P.E.be without share buybacks. If Nelson Peltz thinks Taylor and Moeller would be receptive to his ideas he is mistaken. These guys always believe they have all the answers even with all the disappointing earnings loss and market share loss they fail to recognize it is their failed lack of understudying consumers want and demand lower prices, that has hurt P&G. Way too much overhead and no new inovative products from R&D ."

"It appears that boycotting something has become a national pastime.I'm wondering whether any of those who have recently stated their intent to boycott PG products are new to the boycotting movement or if they are seasoned boycotters. Specifically, were they boycotting (and presumably still?--or was a ""settlement"" announced?) the NFL and its sponsors? If so, there's no need to initiate a boycott of PG, since they already were doing so!It would be pretty challenging to have (and to continue to?) boycott ALL products from the following""Anheuser-BuschBarclaycardUS BoseBridgestoneCampbell’s Soup CompanyCastrolCourtyard MarriottDairy Management, Inc.

How the hell is this stock IMMUNE from the senseless market free fall? Is it from another planet??
She’ll bounce off the 100 dma at $122.

Evidently the company will soon be a position where they will make job cuts in Cincinnati where they have about 10,000 office workers. Articles states Taylor will most likely have until December to get things turned around before the board cans him. No mention sadly of getting rid of Gillette . Hope there is anything left by December !"
Told you that COSTCO makes PG looking cheap... I wish that PG has PE of 33 too..
I spotted uptrend when this was $90 but I did not act on it. when I do act on my instincts I end up losing big. Story of my life.
PG will split for the first time since Snowcats whine about global warming..
Hopping aboard for the dividend today.
"QUIZ: If you had $10,000.00 to invest six months ago, would you have been better off buying P & G stock, or hiding it in your mattress? Charts are out there for all to see.

Certainly raises the ""If not now, WHEN?"" question, no? Better question: How do the lardasses at the top of this company keep their jobs?"

"If you shop on Amazon, you deserve to lose money on PG. Now that Amazon is about to be a grocer, they will develop their own brands leaving national brands out in the cold. It will also hurt your 401k. Think about the ramifications of Amazon in the grocery business---own store brands, get into pharma, also reits that own mall properties will suffer. There will be so many touched by Amazon in the grocery business. Start shopping somewhere else or you deserve to lose money."
"Gillette is deleting negative comments like no tomorrow on social media, when newspapers pick up on that they will have a whole new round of backlash. Puts are looking pretty nice atm, think Jester has the right idea about waiting until earnings but couldn't help but nibble yesterday."

"The real reason that PG is surging today was completely missed by the main stream analysts! A little over a decade ago, I was retiring from GE and fortunately made the decision to diversify away from a very nice chunk of GE stock! One of my investments in that process was 500 shares of PG. It did fine over that period, however in recent years it was underperforming most of my portfolio. I stuck with it because of it had always been a conservative and defensive position. What ever possessed me yesterday afternoon is unknown, however, I sold my entire PG position after holding for over a decade! Headline today....PG HAS BEST ONE DAY PERFORMANCE IN OVER A DECADE....LOL! This is absolutely a true story. I hope all of you who reading this are happy PG longs! Have a great day and good luck in your investments!"

"I hold profit only part of PG but I regret as one point have 4000 long when this go 72 (average was 73.5) and i slowly sell into rally and exit other profit part by 78. Should have waited more. My main reason is, it does not do promotion to pickup sale even when P&G brand still strongest. 3 week ago I saw Costco promotion and that exactly what I hoping P&G do. But i didn't start invest again because against my principle to buy above my sell prices.Wish I sell more slowly, I could made 1000's with such low risk stock."

"Hypothetically, let's say a shareholder (or its family) have held PG shares since 1972.For arguments sake, let's assume its cost basis is zero; all gain.It believes it would be foolish to sell its shares, since there is such a big gain and the taxes would be crazy!While past results are not necessarily indicative of future results, let's take a look into the past, and see whether selling low basis shares would make economic sense.Assumption: state and federal cap gains: 25%For the past ten years, PG's total return has been lukewarm: 62.03%VTSAX (Vanguard Total Market Fund) ten year TR: 156.76HAD it sold PG shares ten years ago, subtracted 25% of proceeds (100% gain) and invested the remainder into VTSAX, its position would be valued 18.65% GREATER than had it simply (as it has) held onto its PG shares.The real lesson for those starting out: do not own too much of one particular stock!Disclaimer: VTSAX represents over 50% of my holdings; I initiated my position 25+ years ago and have yet to sell a share."

"""Procter & Gamble Could Be The Next Kraft Heinz""This is the headline of a recent S.A. post. The premises are:Private label goods are much higher quality than their predecessors.Lidl and others are expanding in the U.S. and the vast majority of their products are decent quality store brands.Existing retailers have been increasing their store brand offerings.All of the above will be detrimental to branded manufacturers.The writer may have a point, but I don't see such a mass conversion to occur anytime soon.Google the headline, if you want to read the piece."

"Just today on MSNBC at 11:45 am on west coast they were at the Dallas Convention Center that is being used as a refuge for people from Houston.The one refugee gal said it was short on space there but the one thing they really need is a way to wash their clothes. She said they had no washer or soap or quarters at this convention center.P&G has a giant truck loaded with operational washers and buckets of Tide soap they drive into disaster areas to help folks in need. It's called ""Loads of Hope"".If there even was a need for that truck and the good PR that PG would create it is now.I called PG headquarters 513-983-1100.PG gal there said she did not know how many such trucks PG had [un-acceptable answer in my opinion]And that they would consider the idea when it is safe and the truck is available.I re-iterated that it is not raining in Dallas --- she just said the same works [... safe and available].Wow - was that a disappointing call to their headquarters.My suggestion would be to capture the event on film for paper ads and tv commercials --- positive stuff to get people realizing how well current management helps people in need.If nothing happens along these suggested lines, then maybe they DO need Peltzer in the board room telling PG what to do.Flabbergasted by the lack of spirit in the person who answers the corporate Shareholders Services line at headquarters."
"How sad that a far-left company like Proctor and Gamble can air ads emasculating and ridiculing men as well as glorifying transgenders and hating on anything moral, yet the stock isn't even effected.The leftists know how to organize and force these pansy companies into bending to their will while conservatives don't do anything and just keep on getting marginalized. They can't even organize an effective boycott and if they do, people are too lazy to target every product they sell and stop buying them. You ask most of the guys still buying Gillette products about the politics of the parent company and they wouldn't have a clue.I guess it's the ""un""-woke. The spoils go to those that are paying attention."

"The trend is your FRIEND,Procter & Gamble Company (The) lies in the lower part of a weak rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good buying opportunity. A break down the bottom trend line at $103.01 will firstly indicate a slower raising rate, but may also be a early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 6.25% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $109.45 and $116.55 at the end of this period."

PG paid too much for Gillette thinking the price for men's products are as elastic as the price for PG women's products. Men are different animals. Men change brands.

"Did you happen to notice a year ago, and last friday almost the same share price, PG is beyond a joke Taylor thanks for all you have done at PG, but it is time for you to find another job, maybe Lafley needs someone like you to clean his pool, maybe not you would screw it up too."
"This stock rocks, best thing ever :)"
Fire your employee and stupid ad agency responsible for the ad and apologize publicly profusely before stock tanks 20%.
Why on earth would the current administration do anything to benefit P&G ? This company going all the way back to Pepper has been led by bleeding heart liberals who spend more time with the social issue of the day than trying to improve sales. P&G was a major sponsor of the Clinton foundation as they were so sure Clinton had the past election sewed up. Just another blunder by Taylor and Moller and Pritchard needs to spend his time and our money working on increasing sales rather than trying to be the social conscience of America.

I love this stock great products. Me personally I will invest in stuff I use and feel is benefiting humanity. I would have a hard time investing in something like casinos and tobacco because it ruins lives. I also feel as if you own something like PG and in the market you actively buy Unilever products over PG you are a hypocrite why invest in something and not use their products if you can. I think a lot of people on this board can agree with me.

Gillette cost P & G 8 billion because of their woke ad. Yes Americans are paying attention to what they buy now.
"Look at 5 yr and 1 yr charts. PG is very extended and is due for a big pull back. The intraday charts show a head and shoulders pattern as well. I don't think anyone with a brain would enter long right now, even if this level is justified, the historical probability of it going down is just too high and the opportunity cost high as well, considering all the other candidates to put your money in while PG falls hard and loads up for another run."

After a strong quartet PG is down for the third day in a row. I guess people selling safe stocks like PG and moving to more cyclical names. I am still surprised that people are dumping PG the day before it goes ex dividend approximately $4.50 from the recent highs since the EPS report. Hard to believe people are so short sides but I guess KMB forecast not helping but below $119? I would not be selling PG after 3 days down the day before it goes ex dividend. It seems odd to me.
I want to but I’m at 117 anyone think it’s gonna hit those prices Friday??

"Argus lowered rating from Buy to Hold but has 2019 eps forecast at $4.50Excerpt from Argus 4/20 report:ARGUS RATING: HOLD• Downgrading to HOLD on weaker outlook• Although P&G spun off its Beauty business in October 2016 and has pruned its product line over thelast several years, organic growth has not improved to the extent we had expected.• In addition, the company continues to lose market share amid fierce competition, and marginimprovement has slowed.• We are lowering our FY18 EPS estimate from $4.30 to $4.24 and our FY19 estimate from $4.64 to$4.50.• Based on the company's current challenges, we believe that PG shares are fully valued at 17.7-timesour FY18 EPS estimate, above the average multiple of 16.6 for peer Consumer Staples companies.INVESTMENT THESIS We are lowering our rating on Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) from BUY toHOLD. Although the company spun off its Beauty business to Coty in October 2016 andhas pruned its product line over the last several years, organic growth has not improved tothe extent we had expected. In addition, the company continues to lose market share amidfierce competition, and margin improvement has slowed. Based on the company's currentchallenges, we believe that PG shares are fairly valued at 17.7-times our FY18 EPSestimate. If organic growth accelerates to the extent we previously projected, we wouldconsider returning the stock to our BUY list. Our long-term rating is also HOLD, based on our expectations for relatively slowrevenue, margin, and operating income growth over the next several years."
Overpriced
nothing wrong with some PG in your portfolio :)$106
Calm port in the storm
"The local Kroger store in Cincinnati can't keep up with bounty paper towels and Charmin TP, wonder if folks in other parts of the country are experiencing the same things? I understand the Mehopany plant that makes these is running 3 shifts 7 days a week already."
If you have access to Nielsen read P&G's annual reports where Grooming is called out separately you can pretty easy calculate the the US is probably 25-35% of the Global business. If you think an ad in one country is driving $8B in devaluation I feel really bad for your portfolio manager who has to deal with your dumb theories of investing.

This is a suckers play no reason for this to be down on good earnings will shoot over 110 in a couple of weeks

"bots bought today. and if you're human and long, sell this out."
"This stock was at a new high of 128+ just last week, sure coming back down now."
PG will earn near $4.50 in 2019. An 18x (low) P/E gets you to $81 and they'll increase their dividends next year. They'll adjust as they've always done and will come back. This is a solid value stock . They need a better quarter when reporting in July and investors will come back

"I get a kick listening to Jim Cramer tonight . Am i crazy or a while back wasn't he telling everyone to get out of this stock and buy a Industrial . If I opined on 100 stocks I could hit a few like Domino's , Costco etc but were little fish and usually only hold a few stocks and yes we should pick them and live with them but the Church of whats working now seems to be to often heard off that show . It can really taint your perception of your own good research . I wonder if Jim should go back and look at his tapes and then put the PG on his forehead for a day for telling people last year to sell PG . If it was best of breed then was it really at nosebleed levels like he alluded then ? Hey nobodies perfect but you forgot to own your sell for the same reasons denounced in this show . Ps keep on keeping on . I think Lou R . moved at a slower pace but gave safer advice for the masses though I have to admit overall if you held to some of his picks ..some even later denounced like RGR you did well. Domino's has been on fire . Best of luck to everyone . Can't loose long term here . Investors end up being able to afford the better quality products P & G makes instead of worthless X brands that don't work so they don't save you money . Again good luck everyone . Go to your local library and read ."
It is so nice seeing PG go up.

Those Gillette ads really move this baby
"Up $10 in the last month, a nice little run. It's always interesting to me to see how the market responds to an earnings report. Sometimes it seems like a significant beat doesn't get the love you expect. I think the forward guidance is the single most important factor for the price a couple of days post earnings."
Proxy time...Vote your shares!
Jon Moeller gave a very encouraging presentation at the Deutsche Bank consumer conference today. 8 of 10 categories are doing terrific.
people need to stop posting about a split. This sort of post displays a total lack of understanding about the markets and equities. it is a form of childish prattle. so just stop it !!
Remember Carter Worth on CNBC who put PG down!!!!
Time to get a non PC CEO. Too bad we have to wait 5 years for Taylor to go. Can't the BOD buy him out?
"BOYCOTT AMAZON. They are coming out with brands to compete against PG's. If you order anything from Amazon, you are contributing to the enemy. It is your choice."

"A year from now folks are going to wish they had bought in at these prices, you would think the world was ending by these price drops.Another virus and another grossly oversold reaction, IMO.Best of luck."
big dip coming today. Wish there was a run to safety but think it's cash coming out of the market and this stock will suffer as well.
All the stocks but Tesla and that's a complete joke but people are killing it.
"I just shorted their stock. If you don't like their ad, vote with a short. Could be 5 shares, could be 500. But let them know that this fake social justice campaign is just that. Fake, short-sighted, and total destruction of their Gillette brand."

"@wayne I get your point with the share reduction. The point I'm trying to make is consumer staples like PG, being a mature company, and in a saturated market have extremely small growth YoY. It is resilient to economic cycles and investors tend to ""fly to safety"" in more defensive equities like PG and bonds. thats why the stock is up so much over the past few months. due to the growth rate of the company a PE of 25+ is not warranted in any other situation but one where volatility is as high as it has been. If you look at the stock historically it forms a very consistent pattern. when the market volatility is high the stock skyrockets, then once the volatility dies down the stock tanks ( it goes too far both ways every time) look at the history, this correction, the correction earlier this year around January, and the correction in 2016. As always I could be COMPLETLEY wrong, but in this situation, I don't see any other reason that justifies the PE premium. If you know something to the contrary I'd like to hear your side."
Well I will be buying more today.
Trump is guilty !! Indict !!
I asked my financial adviser to sell all PG shares. I will never own or buy anything produced by them.
Any reason why PG is down $4 this morning?
"There is a simple and cost effective solution to get P&G away from Google, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft constraints and build stronger relationships with their consumers globally. P&G could save billions a year and have control of their consumer marketing and ses channels."

Wells Fargo increased its target price to $135 from $125.
Carter Worth on CNBC is incompiant!!!!!
"pg reasonable price should $175 per share,because it's earnings can keeps continue growth ,"
pe 70?
"Huge companies like PG move up, but slowly. Like turning an aircraft carrier around. PG, along with MMM and JNJ, have some of the most recognizable brands in existence, which dominate shelf space. Patience, however, is the byword."
not that you should really own a company that sells environmental poison anyway

I learned to sharpen my Schick triple blade on You-Tube and they last one year. I tried to sharpen Gillette but they rust in the shower and don't last a month.
"I really believe in this stock, but I've been invested for 4 months and I'm down almost 2%.. definitely not what I was expecting from this stock this year. Hopefully there's a change in the trend for the next couple of quarters or I'm out. At my age, neutral isn't good enough"
this will come down to 100 by end of this week
Makes no sense.
"Crush identity politics, boycott all PG products! It's fun and useful!"
Would like to see PE ratio come down a little...
buy now before this Skyrockets to 150 by end of May
"steven. If you read analysis and understand valuations etc. you too would conclude PG is likely stuck around $120 for awhile. the stock was trading in the 80s a year or so ago. We must be realistic with expectations. bluntly, the stock on a valuation basis should be in the 105 range at this point. count your good fortune at 120."
Too expensive now. What do you think the low will be later this week or next week?
"Wow, The Clorox company CLX is dropping like crazy $45 from its high. We are very lucky with PG. Go Go PG."
"Nelson bought about 37 million P&G shares in 2016-17, around $84 per share. He has been selling lately. Also the management team are also selling P&G after it went over $130 per share. Thus, many investors are so hesitating to step in to buy when these key people are unloading in a big way. I still recalled P&G stayed in a trading range $55-70 for many years. Now a new range $95 - 145."
Give this company some razor burn!
OMG!!! How do you get rid of this yahoo fin site & back to the functional one!!!???

"Very good earnings on top and bottom line, forecasts growth in a difficult market. Strong and steady, why would you sell at 104? Be my guest, you can right now, not me, there is more upside than down side for PG"
will never buy again.
What’s the percentage of revenue generated by Gillette at P&G ? Profit?
86 by Sept
"Soooooo GLAD I sold this puppy for a very small loss yesterday. Usually you get at least a double gap DOWN after missing earnings or revenues. Those double tops on the chart almost NEVER lie!! What hurts even more is that the DOW, S&P and IWM are up AGAIN today!! What's also SAD is this stock has done pretty much nothing for a few years now, so you would have thought it was DUE for a nice rally. Oh well, will continue to accumulate my GOLD stocks: BA, HON, MSFT, PII, HD, etc. on any weakness!!"
"Wow. if you all take that commerical as sexist, racist facists, or anything besides a wake up call then you are lost and part of the problem."

My comments keep disappearing?
"While a particular poster stated ""new price target of $117"", it appears it doesn't want to ""maintain its credibility"" and respond to my queries of the source of said ""$117"".

Great profits while it lasted
Put Peltz on the board.
"Was Nelso Peltz right when he said"" R&D at P&G is simply a hobby"" After spending billions and billions year after year, where are the new innovative products the company needs to grow ? The company is spending over 300 million on expanding the Mason research center and will certainly spend millions if not billions more and have no new brand or category to show for it. Someone need to hold R&D accountable for all this money being spent. Well past time to clean house ! The company can't prosper by buying up existing brands, increasing the price and be successful, Gillette is a shining example."
"Well its a day after PG earnings and what do you know PG down again, in fact of all 30 stocks in the dow PG ranks..........wait for it in LAST PLACE 19% down even GE is only 16% down for the year and and we all know what happen there. If a major company is as bad as PG guess what they FIRED all the top people, Of course we have BOD that is as bad as the current clowns you know Taylor,Moller, and many others that should be gone to but they still figure they can get more money from PG BEFORE THEY HAVE TO GO. PG WAS A GREAT COMPANY FOR SO LONG,TILL McDonald,Lafley, and the 2 clowns now, not to mention all the crooks on wall st, and now it is so BAD there really is no way out just another year only 4 months into the year to hear another sad story."
what's going on. why did pg drop 7 dollars after hours
PG is better than bitCoin.. hedge against inflation..

"PG discourages innovation in its managers. Its the PG way or the highway. This worked in the 1970's but lately, not so much. We need Nelson to shake them up."
HAHAHHAHAA
"A pretty chart and they want to bid it up into year end, to make the books look better. PEG ratio 3 and PE 25. What a bargain. Look out below January 1st."
"Chart comparisons simply don't lie. Doing a simple comparison to P&G and the Dow and or S&P shows in dramatic fashion P&G,s problems is simply lack of leadership. Wether you do YTD, 1 year, 5 year or 10 year the glaring problem is failed leadership.There is no way this company gets turned around without a break-up and an outside CEO coming in. Analysts and any reasonable share holder can see Taylor and Moller have made no headway in turning things around, they simply continue to line their own pockets with bonuses and failed promises."
"If you are a man but feel like a female then buy gillette razor blades like a sissy. I am a man who will lie, cheat and steal to make sure that Gillette goes down the #$%$. Do not feel that you have the right to tell me to be femanized like the CEO of Gillette is because he is a sissy and I am a MALE. I will forever try to tell lies about the safety of the razor blades and how they have bacteria on most tested. I will do my best to destroy Gillette, a brand that I used to admire until a few days ago."
Dropping again today!

"I buy for the yield . 3,5 % and low risknot many times you can buy this quality that cheapI just keep it for years,,,,,,and only sell when it would accelerate to 100"
"According to Zacks, investors should note PG's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.87. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 21.98, so we one might conclude that PG is trading at a discount comparatively.We can also see that PG currently has a PEG ratio of 3.16. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Soap and Cleaning Materials was holding an average PEG ratio of 3.38 at yesterday's closing price."
Why is this tanking again!!!?
110!! Stop be delusional
PVHO could be ready to run again. They have a partnership with riteaid and are in a ton of riteaid stores already. Plus they were recently endorsed by intel (yes that intel). Check out PVHO today.
PG could sell the Gillette albatross for $8 billion. Dirty diapers is their forte.
"If the quarterly report that is coming on the 20th. was great news wouldn't the company announce prior to the shareholder meeting on the 10th.? With the US dollar down over 6% this year compared to foreign exchanges, and P&G claiming it was foreign exchange killing earnings, seems like sales should be much higher ."
Back down
Every time Proctor and gamble gets anywhere close to a 70 RSI (67 right now) it takes a sizable haircut.
PG reached an all time high at 119.94
"So, if you were going to split AND buy back shares, which would you do first?"

Pleltz.....loser like Trump
My dad worked for this company he was 1 of 3 that didn’t have an ivory league college degree he was in sales. He has this 40000 shares and loved this stock. Retired at 52 we great company to work for they take care of there employees.
Wells Fargo initiated overweight with a price target of $160.
Nice pop. I accumlated 4000 stock between 71 and 74 price . 2000 will get sold at 72 price from my cover call. I make good money there and average price if include all profit from trade and option below 72.25. Might buy again if go lower or consider selling 71 and 72 puts. This price will not remain much longer. I will trade to print profit and might invest profit (Already reserve 50 stock from profit that I am not selling ever)
"The overall market is falling and in a downward trend. PG will very shortly get caught up in this downward spiral. I sold my holdings today on the uptick. This is a great company but there is no sense holding anything if the entire market is headed down. Cash is king! Do not be greedy, sell now and buy back after the market craters. Good luck to you all."
"Down 3.89 in the last two days does not make any sense , going green"
does anyone see the potential for a stock split here? thank you

"Split,,,,I Need a Split-"
"PG is being Amazoned today. If you are not BOYCOTTING AMAZON, you are giving the enemy money to develop their own brands and take away from PG's sales. BOYCOTT AMAZON. Amazon gets a pass on earnings but if PG missed by 77%, it would be down to about zero. Amazon doesn't pay its share of income tax but PG pays a bunch. DON'T HELP THE ENEMY WHICH IS AMAZON."
buy the dips below $127
"Split or no, I'm in for the long haul. Loving the dividends allowing for travel on their money."
PE over 27 is getting a little rich for a consumer staple. Love the company but looking for a pullback.
110 not a problem by May
I'm just a lowly bystander who bought PG back just before it split in the late 90's.. All I know is that for people who are in stocks for the long haul and not the wanna be overnight millionaires this is the kind of stock to buy and hold. I wish more companies ran the way this one does..
I love this company but they release more pump news than some small cap stocks
PG is down 5.01% to 112.32

Can someone please explain this Coty transaction to me? I am trying to understand it a little better. Is it a good thing? Bad thing? What's the advantages of disadvantages of exchanging PG shares for other shares?Thanks
pg will turn around at the next earnings. Everyone is going to wait and see
Deadwood leaving and stock moving up. Still too many “presidents” with such dismal performance - must be aspirational role in that once you get it don’t need to do anything.
"Ok, so instead of Jill-ete, a good safety razor that lasts a lot longer and doesn't cost $30 for a pack. Instead of Pampers, Huggies are just as good as Pampers, and usually a little cheaper. Instead of Bounty, Brawny is actually better buy I usually just buy generic, because a paper towel is just a friggin paper towel. Instead of Tide or Gain, not hard to pick a substitute. Instead of Crest/Oral B lots of choices. And for your health, very smart to not use fluoride, a known poison that causes health problems and lowers IQ. As for mouthwashes, Listerine is way better than Scope. I recommend a brand that is alcohol and fluoride free and won't slowly poison your family with toxic masculinity. PROCTOR AND GAMBLE DOUBLE TOPPING IN PROGRESS! CHEERS!!! Not to hard to find a substitute investment that pays 3% and doesn't poison your family and give a middle finger to Middle America!"
Procter & Gamble (PG) reports earnings on 1/23/2020 and is expected to beat estimates with an Earnings Whisper number of $1.40...
86 after earnings!
i see this on its way back up now
"Most IRA and 401k are now stuffed with all the way over priced stocks and the only safe place is now cash, The charts are telling a big drop is coming. Get to CASH before the CARSH"
hurray
next stop 90.00
When is the next x-dividend date plz tell?
"I am new to PG. I bought in about a month ago @ $138. Since then, it has been sinking like an anchor and with no good reasons, even today with a good earning report. Much regrets."
90 buy sept!
"PG STOCK = DEATH BY A 1,000 RAZOR BLADE CUTS !"
"I haven't delved deeply into PG's earnings, but I just read a S.A. piece ""I'm Seeing Green: Procter & Gamble Is Flashing ""Buy"" Signals"".""the consumer staples company recorded revenue gains of 9%""I understand that PG offers many products, but I was surprised when I read the following. Apparently the hoarding took place during the previous Q and the uber-demand subsided during the Q ending 9/30!""Procter & Gamble’s family and baby care segment (with products like Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper products, and Pampers) was one of the company’s weaker areas (generating 4% organic sales growth for the period)."""
I also voted against the board. I bought this stock at $56 many years ago. Then bought again around $66. I am up $4k in about 7 years. It was between this stock and $pg. Chose wrong.
"How does the board justify giving a 25% pay raise to the CEO and his minions? I thought these guys were paid for results, Maybe the board can explain to the share holders why."
"P & g, I cannot believe you actually ran ads to celebrate china's 70 years of dictatorship and on going violation of human rights and police brutality in hk! shame on you"

"This is all you DODOS who did not vote for Peltz need to know: ""what do Peltz and Co. want from P&G? Well, Trian wants the share price to rise, presumably a hope shared by P&G CEO David Taylor and his team. As of this writing, PG shares have risen 8.9% this year versus a 14.4% year-to-date gain for the S&P 500. Over the five-year period the performance differential is striking, as PG shares have risen 33.6% versus a 78.7% gain for the S&P.""Stockholders LOSE and will continue to fall further and further behind with current management."
Does PnG make pig lipstick?
I told a dem friend she had a weak mind. She told me she didn't mind and would call me in a week.
What the heck happened the last twenty minutes of trading???
They need to make a law against these people like Peltz harassing shareholders with boileroom callers night and day over and over with phone calls . As far as I am concerned both him and Elliott the way they fight proxy wars costing shareholders millions are a plague . Long term non of these breakups and shakeups create stronger businesses . In almost all of these restructurings the employee / employer relationships are hurt in experiments with the business model . Look at the Chart here for the past 2 years the new CEO has delivered but now their minus 100 million dollars if you believe Peltz because of his and those like him . The Chart says it all and so do the harassing phone calls they resort too even after being asked over and over to stop and stop sending junk mail over and over the same stuff .
Stagflation sends PG to 140 tomorrow..But it will reach 200.. pretty soon.
Is it fair to assume the 83 PE on P&G due solely to the Gillete 8 billion write off?
Overpriced!!!
"Aether 1 Bioprinter named ""Medical Device Most Likely to Change the World by 2020."" Is PG Procter and Gamble going to start using an Aether 3D bioprinter for their in house research projects?

why is this stock dropping so hard?
This is the only stock on the market that isn't going anywhere for the next 100+ years. It's the *ONLY* stock that is a generational wealth builder.
SFIO already up 10% today. They are going to be the equivalent of PG but health foods wise. Their budget already allowed for a mostly cash purchase of a company producing 10 million in product a year. Expectation is 2500% by 4th Quarter.
If P&G flops this next quarter will the hand picked board take back the 25% raise it gave the CEO and his minions after the one good quarterly report in the last decade?
"I have an acquaintance whose father started working for P&G when he graduated from high school; he stayed with them until he retired at age 65. Never got into management, just a good steady worker in the plant. BUT when he retired, he had over $1M in his retirement plan with them; he never took the dividends--just kept reinvesting for 4+ decades. His daughter, with a college degree, and grad school, had a professional job. Did her retirement picture look far better than his? Nope! She had far less than her father. That says a lot for P&G!"
"Almost to the moon and back, not enough fuel...Need to find a gas station"
PG should drop by 79 cents today but it went up 143 cents. It doesn't add up.
2:1 stock split?
"Berry your so right were I live the same goes, I hope you found a better job and Obama was a disaster, and now trump will bring us back he has already got rid obamas mistakes and will get rid of ALL of obamas ideas by years end and now VERIZION has bought YAHOO another one of obamasbuddies"
Finally some strength here. Let’s get back to the 90s this year.
I’d also like to propose a corporate name change to the “Gamble” and Procter Company
Which will be a great buy on Tuesday between PG and TGT?
I can smell $80
So funny “toxic masculinity”. Well why do you charge more for women’s products? They’re sexist against everyone.
"For 2016 shareholders dividend increase was the lowest possible, 1% Taylor salary increased 136% with 2.5 million bonus. For 2017 the shareholders received a 3% increase in dividends, nothing from the sale of over 100 brands and Taylor received a 25% increase and Mollers increase was 17% to over 8 million. If Peltz does nothing other than stop the self serving rape by these guys it would be wonderful. Hope shareholders remember what these guys pulled when we vote our shares."
Breaking through the wall on to 132
"P&G continues to post good new,BUT has anyone data on when they have suggested a stock split!?"
WOW
Was an employee with P&G since 1999 and took a transfer to a Duracell plant. Of course we were sold to Berkshire Hathaway and 3 months after the sale it was announced our plant was closing. Splitting equipment to GA and China. I sure miss how well P&G takes care of their people unlike BH. I was 5 years from retiring when the transaction went down so I am happy the way our stock is performing and one of the loudest cheerleaders for a split.
Holding strong - all good here
"Do you still have any doubts why people elected disgraceful Trump? The alternative of the leftist, feminist nonsense was far worse than the brute idiot we have now in the WH."

Price earnings is very high for a consumable expected to perform or it will tumble more than any other average.
"Yet another expert analyst knows more than the company itself, a company whose making necessary changes and although hesitant to first accept outside advice, it's been very open to the suggestions of Nelson Peltz since his election. It's earnings have been in the green for the numerous consecutive qtr's, now as they makes the changes to get lean and be more targeted the best is yet to come. Don't abandon ship, now !! Has anyone else noticed that 2018 seems to filled with analysts (similar to those accurate weather men or ladies) who talk down one company and up another all in the name total facts ... oh plus full disclosure. The tax cuts for major corporations is as fresh as WET PAINT !! Shareholders will be rewarded here and elsewhere, as long as you stay the course."
on too 80.00
"With Covid-19, P &G stock price should have been headed for the moon all year long. Instead, it's performing like a Bernie Madoff holding. CEO must go!"
"Any ideas on how the board will respond when Peltz joins them in March? Taylor and his past CEO buddies, Pepper, Lafley, etc. did everything they could to discredit Peltz and his ideas to help the company and share holders like himself to finally see some improvement in share price. They stated he would destroy P&G and they continue the same old song how the company is on the right path. You have to wonder if the board will remove Taylor and perhaps Moeller to show share holders they really have their best interest at heart and not in Taylor,s or Mollers pocket. This company has currently no leadership that any investor or shareholder can believe in. The Peltz flip flop simply wasted many millions of shareholders money and is an embarrassment."
"That is why there are companies with humongous market caps ( like TCEHY, TTDKY, etc) that would rather be incognito to hedgees. They like to hide in the OTC Pinx sheets so the big boys leave them alone!"
"If it's not good now, it will never ever be good."
"As most are aware, boycotting has overtaken filing frivolous lawsuits as America's number one pastime.A few months ago, PG was ""targeted"" by those that are easily upset. Now, some from the other side of the aisle are boycotting HD.What a country!"
Yes. Women never fight or bully.....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-8Kd69YSSkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuqC_FwXOUw
Clearly weak management running this company to let that ad go through. sell
"The end of October Peltz sold over 2.1 million share at a price of 124.51 , wonder if he will take this down again with a closing price of 124.53 ? Best of luck."
Sell! Still too expensive
128 after earnings CRUSH!
What will the new dividend be when announced next month?Will PG meet analysts earnings estimates?
"you folks understand that their earnings report will likely be positive and analysts will attribute it to the success of this add, further pushing the agenda that we are all nuts and they had it right all along? regardless, I will make a point of avoiding PG products as much as I can."
you can't trust yahoo finance completely
This is just absolutely ridiculous. Companies that make money get punished since 2020.
It appears that a reverse head and shoulders is forming. Should be the bottom. GLTA

Remember Carter Worth on PG. This man is clueless with his charts and graphs. A complete IDIOT !!!!!
Proctor and gamble trading like a growth stock is peak insanity. I guarantee that by next year the markets will still be down 20% from these ridiculous valuations right before an inflationary recession.
Will they double down and run that ad for the superbowl?
What is going on ? PG should be higher. It’s opposite world
100 coming
this stock really sucks
finally curling back up
When is split c9ming

pe too high
"They bought Mercks consumer business as they've done so many times (Millstone coffee, Duncan Hines, etc). After 10 yrs, they will sell it and do a Reverse Morris Trust. Only way to make money is to swap shares with the Reverse Mofris buyer i.e JM Smucker (bought Folgers/Millstone) Kellogg (bought Pringles)"
Nice acquisition- they just got into Target and more will follow now with P&G marketing
Peltz sold 267M in stock that's why its down.
PG is down 4.91% to 114.64
Excellent results. Onward and upward.
I’m surprised it got over 110 without a split.Why?
The last of P&G's products are making their way into the garbage. It's the best I can be.
"buy the dips, I can't forsee any reason this will continue to go down."
PG soon to be in the dustbin of history.
does tariff affect this stock? I guess no since this have been doing so well for the past year?
"Earnings report coming up, pump and dump underway."

Kandi will soon IPO its JV with Geely (Volvo) and the day its announced, the intrinsic value for Kandi will be 40% of the IPO Capitalization. ĶNDI is on the Nasdaq at $8 now."
Stock dropped like a hot potato
"This stock is TRASHHHHH lol. I am up OVER 100% On netlfix, Boeing, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, Facebook, Amazon, and more. I have taken over $450,000 in profits on these names. Meanwhile, you all are in the dividend cult. These stocks have been utter garbage, losing 25% but you all are happy to receive a 4% yield.... EVEN THOUGH IT COMES off the stock price anyway HAHAHAHA honestly you guys have fun receiving your dividends while your portfolio values get MURDERED. I'll have fun in the beach home I'm about to buy. You played yourself."
"Like PG, BIG low PE and float, better deal? Jeffreys says BIG price target $75."
"Who here remembers PG losing 50% in a day. Owning 100% PG, your own employer is not a good idea."
"US dollar were very weak (10-15%) that P&G benefited from oversea sales due to fewer foreign currencies exchanged back more US dollars. Without this favorable condition, P&G last quarter would be even worse. Where are the new products in the pipeline? The next few years indeed looks shaky until new buster products are on the table. In any case, $75 should have strong support, unless this proxy fighter shall sell his over 35 mil shares. I doubt that he would do that; but selling partial holding is definitely possible."
"Might do ok this quarter, easy short for Q2, the blowback from their suicidal Gillette ad will filter in."

"Get woke, go broke. This latest batch of commercials has hit a new low in trying to appeal to liberal guilt. Looks like they were filmed in the 40's or 50's. Completely unrealistic to the point of being comical.P&G has gone from being a consumer products company to being a political activist organization that happens to sell toilet paper and detergent. Sad."
PG needs to boost up the dividend now.
this will be in $60's soon then POUNCE
Procter & Gamble reached an all time high at 130.66
"I did backtesting of this stock on Portfoliovisualizer.com and realized an investment of 10K in the year 2008 would have become 65K today and if invested in the year 1998, it would have become 320K.I don't find any consumer staples stock that has this kind of returns. Is this is a hidden gem? Not even PG or 3M or Kimberly clark have this kind of returns. I took positions recently in this one. How is this stock different from other consumer staples?"
Time for a split!!!
I think this correction is due the misleading and incorrect PE ratio that finance.Yahoo is showing.
"forget PG, look at CLOROX on the dip yesterday. spread the word. Some strong buy volume can send it soaring. Look at chart"
All should oppose manipulative femininity. It has led young women to often lie and become cheaters and has been a terrible impact on society as a whole. I am just making a similar statement that could be used in an advertisement and will likely be interpreted as a one-sided political statement. Such a statement about manipulative femininity above should not be used in an advertisement just as a statement about toxic masculinity should not be used in an advertisement. Shame on Gillette and Proctor & Gamble.
100 by JAN1!!
Love me some P&G. Great great stock will hold for a very very very long time.
#PG solid earnings a good sign for RAD as they sell all of their products.
"Just sold this POS for 89.37 after this supposed earnings miss (depends on which story you're reading this morning). With everything else SOARING, thought for sure this was a diamond in the rough (low PE, huge company maybe coming back, etc.). Well, you can't fight the tape!! Good Luck if you're still long."
"got in at $127. It's already in some of my ETF and other funds, but I like having a bit more long term here."

"On this very day in 2008, the Dow crashed by 697 points within the first 10 minutes of trading. I wonder if this current market action has anything to do with ""anniversary syndrome"". It's panic city out there. meanwhile.....PG's not budging much."
Bought 55 shares today
Under 140 again. Look at my previous posts...
Liquidated my position in BA; too much bad news. Used part of the proceeds to add to my PG.
Stronger than all others.
"It will take a few days or weeks to feel it -but the huge boycott that just started over P&Gs insulting racist anti-cop ad is going to take down the earnings for the next period. Why they did not learn from Target, Macy's, etc is beyond me. My brother worked for P&G for a long time, so we bought most of their products for decades. We will not buy any moving forward."
$PG green today amidst the sea of red. Seems like investors are running to safety.
Everything I ever buy for myself and my family I will be reading every last small print to make sure it has nothing to do with P&G.Best time to SELL is right this minute!
"I suppose Dividends and Earnings on the same day gives mixed messages, but overall the message was very good. Ka-Ching either way. Rule of thumb: Learn to read earnings and understand them, and don't just follow the panicking herd who don't... Up she goes! SHE'LL CLOSE GREEN TODAY!"

"Waited a while to post as i kinda new PG is going to take a dump listening to ouslindrool or wooglin3 this year most of you probable y know they have no clue about PG and never will. and just like i said this year Lafley told Taylor sell off what you can no matter what the price,and give shareholders basically nothing as usual, PG is beyond the Dog of the DOW again as it has been for last 12 years and headed their again, Listen haveing PG for over 40 plus years, must i say it again DO NOT BUY THIS DOG, if you need the div then go ahead but PG has no growth again due to its management as usual and will end up end of year NO WHERE, your are wasting your hard earned money, Lafelys got most of it in Florida laughing all the way to the bank each day, Taylor is as dumb as Lafley of course he is just a puppet, I will say this one more time HAVE NOT BOUGHT 1 SHARE OF PG SINCE 2009, 7 YEARS DO YOU GET IT KNOW"
"If you listen you to Wooglin , who cuts layleys lawn ouslindrool who cleans lafleys pool , and th new guy Bluto who takes care of Taylor in another way you can guess on your own you will lose as usual these people together own less than 300 shares but will tell ou all they know which is NOTHING"

"If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.The New York Times just ran a story that the government from 2007-12 had a secret program to study UFOs. Here is a link to the story which includes the video of a Navy pilot chasing a UFO.https://www.nytimes.com/…/…/secret-pentagon-ufo-program.htmlPerhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"

( there was nothing more than peach fuzz there at the most). I said NO SIR, I haven't started shaving yet to which he replied, YOU WILL SHAVE EVERY MORNING weather you need it or not. YES SIR !Just about the first thing you were issued for free, was a Gillette shaving kit so you could get in the habit of buying their razors.Remember those ""gumball"" machines at the end of the barracks with the salt tablets. They got you in the habit of taking salt every day when I was 17. Now that I'am 72 Cardiology keeps telling me NO SALT."
Why the sudden drop?
New CEO time!
KMB spiked up and rolled over.....bad sign for over valued PG....MACD line just crossed to the downside!!!!!!
"I don't understand this either - ESPECIALLY with the ex-div date this week on Oct 17. Makes no sense at all. I would expect a drop post ex date, not now. Bothersome; makes me think that some of the pumpers are actually shorting this stock so they can buy into earnings. Not sure if I trust JPM analysts either."
"For those who lament PG's stock performance, I see COTY is in the news today, and not in a good way.Since Oct 3, 2016, the day COTY closed its deal with PG, COTY's total return is negative while PG's is positive.In fact, while PG has lagged the S&P 500, it has outperformed its ""peers"" among the S&P 500 Consumer Sector Index.52 week what?"
When is this stock going up?.. It keeps tanking.
WOW! the only stock thats GREEN today!
$100 coming for sure.. After 2 years of waiting.
This has been dropping ever since the dividend. I hope it goes up Monday.
Bought the dip
"he is a list of PG products not to buy, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Procter_%26_Gamble_brands should be easy to find alternatives."
Here's hoping it splits in the next couple of years
SNOWCAT. $100 is coming. King P&G
"I own PG as a proxy for bonds .It ya wanna make fast money ...""Dis Aint Da Place ""...BTW I have bought this stock in 2005 for my sons Roth IRA.I tell him I wont be here BUTT the 100 shares will turn into 1000+shares with div reinvest in 40 years from now !!!"
overvalued
"How does a management team allow their stock to tank from $90 to its current level within 3 months max in lieu of any truly negative news without a response to stem the slide?Unbelievable, arrogant and decidedly investor-unfriendly."
Id lik eto kick Pelz in the nuts!
Why this stock so down today? Any news.
"Add Barbasol to cut into P&Gs profits with its entry into the razor sector, ouch!!!!! Unless Barbasol infringes on patents, P&Gs Gillette razors will take another hit."
The PE ration needs to be divided by 4 since they pay a quarterly dividend the earnings is reported only for that quarter. You could also multiply the earnings ($1.43) times 4 and calculate the correct PE. You'd think Yahoo would be smart enough to figure that out?
Sell and take gains?
"Ahhh yes, the daily 52 week lows just keep on coming."
"Obviously, PG is doing as good as Costco. so why is costco PE of 27?"
hell yeah go down more
"oh this stock is falling everyday, my 30 shares at $136 will be vanished soon!"
Total manipulation by shorties... They should first investigate these and correct this system before WallStreetBets... That was an after effect of the fraudulent activities of shorties and hedge funds... How in the world can this be negative when the Market is UPPPP.... and such a high quality stock... They know that the sane people will not sell this stock... Extremely easy to manipulate... Regulators should definitely step in....
"Don't see how a company who's stock price has been falling off a cliff (during the greatest bull run in world history, mind you) for six months, goes up in pennies in a single day is ""on the rise."" Sorry."
Here come the upgrades
"For the 2nd time in 2 years, Fortune magazine did a decent job telling the public the problems with Tide Pods. How their colorful packaging may etice children and older adults into thinking it may be candy. Telling us how its taken 8 years, with several thousand emergency visits a year, before they have come up with a system for studying why people are trying to consume it. And for telling people PG isn't legally required to disclose the chemicals in it. Pods kill. That's a fact. But their refusal to make the Pods unappealing to those with limited reasoning skills is baffling. Perhaps shareholders should let PG know they aren't happy enabling a corporate giant injure several thousand people a year, with deaths and emergency visits, and sometimes permanent problems if they survive. They used to look like hard candy. Like Crème savers used to look like. When you are at a store, look at their hard candy display, then look at a Pod. You gotta get them to change. Someone had the same problem with liquid detergent, when people were thing it was a lemon flavored drink. I'd like to see a law require that a company pay for all ER visits, if their product was used."
buy at 55
"How many winners did you have this week? Want to add ten more to that number? Then google ,STOCKTRADEVIDEO they are alerting huge breakouts you have been only dreaming about"
$200 covid or no covid
It will be 200 soonNow Asia new middle classes start using PG products
"PG is closing in on a full retracement of its August 2015 low of about $67. No idea if it will go even lower, but I’m confident that it is nearing the red line where big changes will be kicking in at PG. Major divestiture/aquisition moves, significant employee downsizing and organizational restructuring will all be on the table."
My guess is that PG will do a stock split after hitting 140..That is the first time since I can remember.
dammit!! should have sold this pig Where is the bottom!
CNBC Fast Money is a JOKE!!!!!
Great day today.
What a turn from the early Pre-market prices! Saw it below $78. What is going on??
RIDE is on sale today thanks to crooked hedge funds who downgraded it so they can cover cheap. Also HUYA is broken out. That’ll be $100 soon
109 after earnings
Looks like Mr. Clean is taking us to the cleaners.
Walmart lowered guidance PG to follow
Seniors are getting clobbered by inflation. I doubt many can afford PG products anymore.
29 PE with 3-4% annual growth and taking 8 billion in write downs on Gillette seems reasonable at this price. Where can I get a cash advance on my house to buy this stock?
Sold all shares today. Didn't realize this company deals in politics.
Thank you Nelson Pelz!

Personally I am disappoint at $8B Dividends. That's going to keep the dividend per share closer to $0.80/share/qtr. Much rather see $9B and getting this stock back towards a 3% Yield.
"Robert - I, too, smell the $80+ mark coming soon."
"Rising with heavy volume. Stochastic oscillator and RSI go green, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 125.36 for a run up to 146.42."
Unbelievable but Morningstar just came out with a $98 price target
PE Ratio (TTM) 82.15 ???
"Taking down the weight of their products hoping customers don't notice. They are giving less for more, not good! Always look at the net weight and compare to other brands and store brands, too. P&G probably makes the store brands that sell for a lot less. Same thing, much better price."
most people are stocked up. probably wouldn't need anything for months?
"November 11, 2013 P&G stock was 89.94 now sitting at under 81. What a horrible job of so called management."
Buyer at $45-$47.
Negative revenues does not justify the stock price price earnings 16 .Revenue growth is critical profits can only be increased for so long with cost cutting
"Investors will be rewarded handsomely on this stock. Buying when it's out of flavor temporarily, getting paid while waiting is the way to go.PG is already turning around especiall with the recent purchase from Merck. I have been buying on the way down, my next fill is $70/share limit order. We'll see! Long PG!"
technicall i think thiis will be red today.
85 pe?
"Well, well, well!""10. “This is by far the most viewed ad Gillette has ever had online. The vast majority of those views are organic/unpaid, which points to the natural interest and engagement that we were able to generate among consumers.”– P&G spokeswoman Julia LaFeldt on how the “toxic masculinity” digital ad for Gillette razors had been viewed more than 115 million times as of August and enhanced the brand among key target audiences. In addition, P&G had grown sales and users on the Gillette On Demand direct-to-consumers platform every month since the ad was released in January, LaFeldt said. The Gillette digital ad titled “We Believe” suggests inappropriate behavior shouldn’t be laughed off as “boys will be boys.” The ad focuses on bullying during boyhood and sexist behavior toward women by men.""https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2019/12/26/p-g-s-top-quotes-of-2019.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
It should be a happy day for PG.

Seriously
nelson is not a nice guy. But he can help PG who have become arrogant based on past successes. Have you bought Head and Shoulders lately. Try taking out a mortgage on your house.PG used price when they ran out of ideas.
"I love this stock , just buy it and forget about it"
Going to sell half my shares when this hits 137 after earnings.
So far Peltz sure is a huge help :(
"Gillette  make me feel attacked, I will go to my safe space at the college campus. I . I will need healing too after this "
Procter & Gamble is down 11.44% to 101.02

MCD stock price going up 100% for sales down 4 years in a row..I think PG is too cheap.
"At nearly 25x earnings, perfection is priced in. Perfection is not what I read this morning. Below $120 short term."
Appeasing the SJWs will eventually come back to haunt these clowns.
New dividend : 0.7172
"Added 1500, holding now 2500 total stock. I am quite confident that this will help me make thousands."
When does the proxy come out so we can get rid of this BOD and CEO. Stock down 14% for the year!
P&G beat earnings all four quarters in 2016. A whisper away from its 52 week high and a hop skip and step away from all time highs. They beat earnings Monday the stock soars for a nice return
I will add around $112. Looks like the momentum is gone.
Not bad for a company that hires mediocre people.
P&G has bottomed at 80.12.Start loading up.
"Not understand the dip lately at all. Makes no sense considering their dividend, earnings report and the current economic situation in regards to their products"
Both the daily & weekly charts looks positive for P&G. Look for nice upside (approx. 12%) by end of year -- $154 price target.
Don't be a traitor and shop on Amazon.
"I heard that P&G plans to raise their prices. If they do that, I will not buy from them. They should focus on cutting costs and giving the consumer more value. It's bad enough that they are reducing the contents of their products (READ THE NET WEIGHT _ THEY KEEP SHRINKING IT WHILE KEEPING THE PRICES THE SAME OR HIGHER!). There are other companies with better products and lower prices out there. I would not invest here - Main Street rules this company, not Wall Street."
Thank goodness PG doesn't own Ben & Jerry's...
"First Starbucks, then Nike, now Gillette. A short basket is emerging."
Goldman Sachs stock is tanking huge > 11.00 per share as is JP Morgan !This can't be good news for overpriced equities can it ?Didn't most of the Presidents cabinet come from Goldman Sachs ?What do they know that you don't ?

How 'bout a 'toxic baby' campaign for their Pampers?

The “market” and investors are missing the real story. Just wait till everyone sees the earnings for next quarter UP again $$$$$ big time.
"use all my savings to buy 30 shares at $136, just in few days, price dropped like crazy. And we don't know where is the bottom. help! Anybod"
I think a major threat to this company may be a plastic ban. Does anyone have any concerns about this? I know p and g use plastic on a lot of there products such as diapers etc. Apart from that it seems like a good overall company.
@wooglin. The campaign will cost customers. Almost all of the talk I have heard is negative. I own PG shares and am disappointed in the management approval of such an a ad. Bad judgment. My opinion.
I am sure N. Peltz is rejoicing like the leech he is.
NOT GOING OVER 119 NO MORE SHORT
"DANGER , DANGER, DANGER, Time to move all IRA's 401k's, TSP's and pension funds to CASH before the CRASH. The GREAT FALL in the FALL in coming not much time left now the SELLING cycle has started"
I will buy if it hits 100. Sold mine for 124
"Saw their CEO on CNBC a few weeks ago, he did not impress me, seemed like a stuffed shirt with no depth. If he went to a pickup bar the girls would avoid him.Comes across like a beta male."
the swamp creature was send away. stock price will drop but the company will stay strong. instead of the sell off plans that was in his white papers
great stock steady upward since I bought last may
My only stock in the green today!
ABSURDLY OVER VALUED....SHORT IT HERE!!!!!!!!
pretty good but not great I rate 7/10
From here on out I'm going to do my damnest to not buy any Procter & Gamble product. Sorry I don't need to buy into the false narrative that somehow men are a problem when the reality is that nearly everything that has made our life better in the modern world was brought to you by a white European male.
Hi Henry...l also have no doubt PG is being manipulated by insider trading.PG start 1% up n every damn day and then drops like a piece of Sh...t at closing time....l have never been so regretful like having bought this trashy stock!!!
why pg won't split. 1. not current market practice. 2. administrative cost. 3. will not create shareholder value.
How is this up? On what exactly? Next quarter will be brutal earnings wise so who’s stupid enough to buy into this?
"Want to know why PG has been dog of the Dow since 2005, just read"
"My Question:Why did revenue slightly climb but profits decline so much in 2017, 2018 and even 2019?"

"What a ridiculous day. Retail investors trying to stick it to fund managers to cover shorts with AMC, BB and GME.Fund managers just turn around and sell other core holdings to make up the difference.In the end, we pay the price."
$200 yet?
Do you think the stock will rise tomorrow?
should be back to its $60s
Lol? 4 and 1% growth is considered bad?
"This morning I received two ""Seeking Alpha"" emails (take your pick):10:17 A.M. ""PG: Procter & Gamble's Time Has Passed""10:43 A.M. ""PG: Procter & Gamble: Downturn Will Be short-Lived""Differing opinions are what make a market!"
Foward p/e now 17.67 which sounds like a good deal compared to other stocks
P&G debuts shampoo bottles made from beach plastic. Fantastic P&G. https://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2019/03/14/p-g-debuts-shampoo-bottles-made-from-beach-plastic.html
Nice. 65 years of increases now
Why the drop?
I guess the market doesn't think too highly of Mr. Peltz and his abilities to do anything positive for this company.
Stop purchasing PG's TOXIC PRODUCTS. I already have my list of products I will never buy again.
YES WE BROKE the $101 WALL!!!
"For those unfamiliar with mini tender offers, the following PR sheds some light:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-g-recommends-stockholders-reject-212100949.html"
I think this is golden short...........SOOO much resistance overhead here.............double top at $94 after extremely overbought.....higher dollar will kill their sales...................Put a stop at $95.....but I see this DOWN next week.
"Chris Long in the new ads for Gillette, I don't think he was chosen to move away from the men behaving badly marketing plan... he's an NFL woken hero, just more of the same, men are bad......."
Look at that melt up. Any bad news and new executive team
We will have a v shape today
"Big news, we will jump today"
Danielle should be concerned of TDS more than COVID-19.
I have short 10 74 put so if remain above I will go long again ( I hold 50 from previous profit). I am considering to buy more if price remain around this level.
This pig is going skrocket to 98 on Monday
I'm curious to what insider transactions occurred knowing they were going to cut cost on razors. Lowering the price 20% is a big deal.
Judgement day tomorrow for a stock that has run from $72 to $116!!!!!!!
"What if Me Too told women's hair removal products to use less, shave less, curb their female sexuality. Basically, show some leg hair, go au natural. It's just more of the gender wars toward unisexuality."
I figure PG will stabilize after today. Look at other members of the sector==Unliver and Kimberly Clark. The whole sector has not performed as well as other sectors.
118 open tomorrowReply
FINALLY BROKE 78 NOW ONTO THE 80S!!
"interesting to follow trading today, a rate hike is expected...no matter what powell says, any hike is negative for overvalued growth companies..short sellers cannot wait.. but pg has legs, if this sells off it might be strong buy."
honest question. I compared church and Dwight with PG. I see CHD performed better than PG historically. any opinions?
"Another fantastic Q from our hard-working people at P&G!All I need to know is this;""P&G expects to pay approximately $8 billion in dividends in fiscal 2021. The Company increased its outlook for common stock repurchase from a range of $7 billion to $9 billion to up to $10 billion in fiscal 2021. Combined, P&G now plans to return around $18 billion of cash to shareowners in this fiscal year.""Thumbs up, P&P, thumbs up!!"
"Rather curious tie-up between PG & WMT. If you want to purchase an Herbal Essence shampoo (too bad there is no longer a basic Herbal Essences shampoo--lots of varieties, but not the original) AND be GREEN, you must do so at WMT. That counts me out!"
Peltz is a piece of #$%$!!
SELL SHORT DONTLET IT GET TO 119IT DONW
I want to sell this pig but as soon as i do it will probably go up !
buy PG to hedge against inflation ?
Not enough reason to get out...reason to load up if anything. Especially down on no news
Where's the support now? This thing can really fall from here.
So much for Trump he has nothing. A total fool.
warren owns this stock for a long time.
I see the youngster deleted her post; hopefully she gained some wisdom via my replies....
$142 meant to be broken.
Analysts keeps down grade and see other shiat stock upgrade.. yeah. BUllshiat.
A new 52 week high today at 125.76 any thoughts on where the stock price ends the year? Best of luck
Gillette jumped the shark. Adios!
"Pg is always been a dog since 2004. and always be, just like YAHOO"
"finally, some real diversity at P&G"
PG reached an all time high at 113.76
PG is up 4.91% to 121.69
"Bastage, Americans will have less money to spend on other products thanks to Trump tariffs..Think about it."
120 closing.
I keep buying...can’t help myself
I sold all my shares on Friday. The dramatic promotion of LGBTQ lifestyle is too much. Not acceptance. Not tolerance. PROMOTION! There is a huge difference.
"PG with Lafley, Moller , and now Taylor this years gave shareholders the worst div ever in history at PG 1%, Uniliver div was 6%, and is there any wonder why i have not bought 1 share of PG since 2009, or do you get the drift, I BET NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"April 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street securities analysts revised their ratings and price targetson several U.S.-listed companies,* P&G : Citigroup cuts price target to $150 from $165* P&G : Citigroup cuts to neutral from buy* P&G : Jefferies raises target price to $168 from $167* P&G : JP Morgan cuts price target to $147 from $148"
Would be a great time for the company to buy back some of those shares.
"In this market environment, any PE over 20 is too high."
"very good numbers for PG. good Revenue growth and profit beat, also raised forecast. I guess expectations were really high. As a long term holder happy to see a 3rd quarter of real growth again. hopefully the old PG is back on track for years a decent to good growth to support good dividend raises for years to come....."
"one month low, three month low, six month low, who's running this company, Andrew Cuomo?"
PG is down 5.26% to 105.00
Keep shorting.
Last week PG received a price target upgrade from MS. This morning JPM increased their target to $136 and the stock plunged below $120. Huge rotation out of staples to cyclicals. Quite honestly I do not get it. Chances for a recession are high by next year with or without a China deal.
Just voted my proxy. Voted to GET RID OF EVERYONE beside Nelson Peltz. And voted NO on executive compensation. The BOD includes Kenneth Chenault who ran AMEX into tjhe ground and David S. Taylor who helped run this company into the ground with his disastrous liberal policies. Time for a new board of directors
Record high today? $139.95Not a peep on the message board. Sure is lonely at the top.
"everyone said it's good stock, I bought at $ 136, how many years should I wait to get even? anyone help?"
PG is poopin!
Voting your shares is a perfect time to let PG know that they shouldn't support the NFL if they disgrace the USA!
I think Morgan Stanley will keep this below $84.70 until next month. Too much to pay out in mutual funds for them not to short for now
Does anyone think that longer term that PG won’t increase sales and profits?

this stock sucks down every day
"What a total disregard and betrayal to share holder's of this company to air this idiotic ad as it will do nothing but hurt sale's, people didn't invest money in this company so they could go on some political crusade this ad need's to be pulled and an apology made for ever airing it."
Took the dividend and the stock still rose. I love PG.

Another new high - 110 into earnings - no bad news
"Macquarie Research analyst Caroline Levy cut her target forecast from 96 to 82 today in a Barons article. This and the ongoing battle with P&G,s second largest buyer, China, can't be good news. Any chance they could dump Gillette and take the proceeds and purchase Pfizers over the counter brands? Any thoughts on what Gillette could bring? Seems as though P&G has so mismanaged Gillette it may be best to let it go."
Stock split will be announced on Tuesday!!!
I have some positions in this stock.How much does this trade war effect this one?I saw an article with list of companies that are effected and I see 3M and JNJ but not I didn't see PG>Any thoughts please?
After Hours slaughter......Ouch!!!!!!!
Is this the next GE?
Anybody know where Hillary's hiding?
"""Cut cost at any cost"" should be their motto. The cuts, as with most major Corporations need to come from the top making sacrifices, not from a numbers shell game."
"This stock has given me nice capital gains as well as a decent income stream. While not a hyper growth stock it is very safe, and PG has their fingers in everybody's pies with their huge arsenal of products. Overall I believe more returns lie ahead for patient investors."

"2.5B Float... Market Edge said ""Avoid""... Duh."
"Had pg since 72 father and grandfather since 1940 & 1950, PG was top of Dow for many years now dog of the Dow, if you listen to the people who post each day your money will be gone, as a family having pg since 72 we have 60,000 plus who cares we have not any of us bought a share since 2009 and will never buy again, the people Ouslindrool,Wooglin,Bluto just talk have no clue about pg, PG has been bad as any stock in the last 13 years because of BOD, Lafley,Moller,Taylor,McDonald,this is the main reason why PG is such a DOG, and until they are gone PG will be the same ,but listening to people that have no clue will make it worse for investors"

Dropping to far adding
Correction. I said my stainless triple blade Wilkenson Sword lasted a year because I learned how to sharpen it on YouTube. That was true for the first one. My second one only lasted seven months. I think you could do the same with a Gillette blade if the cheapskates used stainless steel. Plastic coated pig iron rusts.
Sold PG and bought UN. (Dollar Shave Club parent)...
i see a real value between 83 84......
This stock is a ROCKET
"Things for shareholders to ponder. Management paid around 57 billion for Gilletet, sold off Duracell for about 4.7 billion after sinking 1.4 billion in cash in the deal, so the net is about 54 billion for Gillete including Oral B and Braun, and has lost market share in grooming in dramatic fashion. Spends roughly a billion on Olestra and builds an entire plant only to shuttle it all and made zero. Sells over 100 brands and again share holder get the same thing as from the Duracell sale, zero. In 2016 Taylors raise exceeds 130% and gets a bonus of 2.5 million, share holders get a 1% dividend increase. 2017 Taylors raise is 25% and dividend increase is 3%. Company spend lord only knows how many millions to keep Peltz off the board, then installs him anyway. Spends 300+million on Mason research center and has no new brand since Swiffer. BOD appoints the CEO job to the president of Grooming division which is the worst performing division within the company. Wonder why the stock is performing so badly with the company running so smoothly."
"BA pe of 27, WMT pe of 24... PG set to break $100"
"Snowcat, cover your shorts.."
I'll never buy another P&G product again. These American hating liberals have gone too far.
Good thing Peltz didn't get elected to the board....imagine the tax liability we would have if PG was going up instead of cratering! I think the existing board and management's plan is becoming clear. Drive the price down before the next options give away!
P&G and other (((Globalists))) want to weaken and kill you with their toxins. They scream out in pain as they strike you.
Glad i didn't sell!
closed at $90Ready for $100
"Frustrating performance as we have gone 3+ years without price appreciation. While their dividend has increased a small amount and yields about 3% the total return in this market has obviously lagged blue chip companies. They are an ocean liner and their ability to turn their ship around is seriously lacking. It is time in my opinion to lower exposure and leek for better opportunities. When the airlines, and automotive sectors perform better it's time seriously consider alternatives."
Going to 90 this week
Paying a premium so they can channel funds to ads that slap you in the face. Irony.
Any reason for today’s sell off?
This commercial is so insulting. Who in their right mind hired the advertising company who produced this commercial and who within P&G approved it for release?
30 day chart is terrible!
Zack's raised PG to 2
"also, did anyone else notice that almost all of the antagonists in the add are white boys and white men (aside from the handful of BBQ dads)?"

"This has to be one of the worse months to own PG. I was feeling good with an average of @$113 after great earnings and now down $1.50. I understand the rotation but this has gone too far, right? I do not get selling PG at $111.50 but I guess it will be lower next day too."
PG reached a new 52 Week Low at 83.37
PANIC selling by retirees ..buyers will come in at this price back to 115 by next week
I wish I would've invested a year ago when I first looked at it.
Any news or is this the most absurd rotation out of staples? Stock is down $8 this month with 2 upgrades. Maybe MS and JPM upgraded the stock for their clients to get out? They are dumping staples and going crazy on financials and industrials
130 by next week
I love when we ignore the downgrades of xo panties famous for manipulation looking to drop the stock before increasing on their portfolio!

"P&G p/e ratio is too high relative to industry standard range. It can stay in an interval for quite sometime to wait the ""e"" rising to the level with p/e in 17-20 area to have another boost up. Be patient for long-term investors. For short-term traders, look for some big win/loss cases. The US Steel maker, X, is a good recovering stock for the 2021."
Programmed drag down to get more profit from amateurs.
With Boston Beer electing Julio Nemeth to its board is PG looking to enter the beer business?
I hate this company....sold off many famous and profitable brands and squandered the money on buying back shares handed out to fat lazy management.........................
And another 52 week low.
5 million shares traded in 1st 20 minutes. I would think this means many traders are throwing in the baby with the bathwater. Which is likely what happens at market bottoms.
What a nice opportunity to add more. No brainer.
Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone.
PG does not need to lecture me on toxic masculinity. This is insulting and i am switching to Schick.
It's a good company .

If I buy I get next dividend? Or not?
"Do they have plans to do a Toxic Femininity commercial, too? How about instead of toxic femininity and toxic masculinity ads, we just encourage people to be better people. Or even better yet, let's just leave extremist politics our of consumer ads and leave it up to the late night pundits."

Strip out one time items and Core Earning where up 18% add to that an increase of improving cash figure now has management expecting to return about $18 billion to shareholders this year through dividends and stock buybacks.
lol I dident even watch the 'commercial' most people don't care.just a few bobble heads on the internet and fake news.PG is a buy and hold for life folks.
"Listening to the hour and a half web cast of the 3rd. quarter, never do the analyst confront Taylor about the share drop of over $20 per share in less than 6 months time.No mention of any new brands or category coming from research and development despite the billions spent on R&D . Nothing to encourage anyone to buy shares , too sad."
p g pretty great.

"This company is sad. I now shave using a safety razor and wet shave, cost...about $20 a year! Haha"
"Well, get ready for PG to sell off stuff as soon as Peltz gets his seat. I am sure he is laughing at the thought."
Not bad for a horrible trading day
it appears there are some on this board who may harbor tinges of racism. Just an observation.
Goody goody yumm yumm

Looks like PG is going to learn the same lesson K did when they put their noses into social issues and politics.
15% eps growth. Forward '19 earnings $4.80-5.00 Price $98-105 in 2019 with 20 p/e...currently trailing 23 p/e.

"TIME TO SHORT AGAIN!! It will stall at $94 and then roll over for good back down to the 50 day average......either way, this is doomed! If Trump and XI make -up, this gets sold off................as money will chase momo stocks....if now, chart says this is weak and will stall and NOT hit a 52 week high."
"People gotta keep their clothes and homes clean and brush their teeth or go #$%$."" Good BUY"
What about Peltz selling stocks
Im kicking myself i didn't sell this at 120 a couple days ago
"The last time P&G stock kept falling day after day on up markets like it has been doing, with no news to compell it to continually drop Trian fund was selling off part of their millions of shares, Wouldn't be surprised to see them doing it again."
"Visa pe of 35, Costco not growth mash PE of 32.XOM is dying, PE of 35. EOG not making money, OXY not making money, A ton of oil companies not making money...PG is cheaper than a lot of stocks."

"Today Berenberg Bank set a price target for a sell , at 78.50. That is why this is down:-("
"$DIS, $JNJ, $PG, $CELG, $WMT, $GILD, $AGN,$KHC, $IBM, are so cheap I can't buy enough of them. I am keep selling out of money put on each of them for weeks now and printing good money week after week even while they go slowly down. I am now buying bunch but that also put me at risk to get into Margin use as I have short out of money puts as well( Not worry as I will sell calls to cover cost of interest and still print profit) If I have patience I would make thousands investing here & holding for few years out. Dividend and profit would be huge. (I am making lot of money still but all money is short term and required lot of time to monitor) This is very limited risk investment out there. Buy before they move higher."
"Should P&G sell off Gillette and what is it worth today? Just read an old article from March 2016 that said Warren Buffett traded just over 4 billion of P&G stock for Duracell which had annual sales of over 2.5 billion which seems amazingly cheap. Since P&G paid just over 57 billion for Gillette and with the 8 billion write off and the 4 billion for duracell, is the remains business worth any where near 45 billion? Wondering if this 8 billion write down is a one time practice or annual hit ?"
Glad i didn't sell! on to 115
"Wooglin 3, the expert with 100 shares that were given to you,PG has been a dog for over 12 years are you listening, Moller is as bad as the PUTZ, when i said lets ask the experts, i was being funny you do not own enough PG shares to even bother with, my grandson owns more and he is 3, do not tell me you do not work for the USPS, what else could you do, and i know your cutting the PUTZ 'S lawn, and last please get a life you in NO Way belong on the PG post you know nothing about PG except you still like Alan the PUTZ who sold off over 100 companies PG owned some 2 years after he bought them, and now you want Taylor the puppet to buy others, of course the Putz will overlook the buying seriously take all 100 shares ad find another post to tell people all you know, maybe sears looks good to you....... it would your that kind of person."
"Call 1-800-Gilletteor Call, DAWN... a PG product...1-800-725-3296Tell them you want a nationwide ad apologizing for this blunder.Worst ad campaign since ""new Coke""...Gillette ad it totally anti-male (toxic masculinity)... and especially anti-white male.Watch it a few times...see how the white male does bad stuff... and in 4 instances the black male tries to do the correct thing.What kind of idiots approved this disaster?"
