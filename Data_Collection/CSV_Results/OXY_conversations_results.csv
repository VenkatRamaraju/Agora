Recent headlines and conversations for OXY
Just imagine what this company could have been. It's not just about what you lost but what you could have made. Before they did the APC deal they had a pristine balance sheet and was deservedly proud of it. Proclaiming that they wanted to keep it that way and promised to look after the hefty 5% dividend. Promised they would take care of shareholders. Never do anything to jeopardize the balance sheet. Promise. Then what do the idiot CEO do? Exactly what they had been promising not to do. Destroy the balance sheet with a completely misguided buyout of APC. Yet after all of this the CEO remains.
"Carl Icahn knows he is going to jail or worse and is getting ready to bail to his bunker along with every other mill/billionaire pedodevilworshiper on the planet. Quantum financial reset in progress and gitmo is overflowing. Fed is toast, 1 for 1 cash exchange but all dealers and trafficers will be wiped out, watch them resign and run. Who has resigned recently? Mainstream will not report it."
"Everyone keeps mentioning the debt incurred with the Anadarko purchase. While the timing was not good, OXY picked up a significant asset with huge revenue potential. OXY could also do a capital raise on the open market by selling additional stock, which could be justified based off total combined asset values. This would result in share dilution, but they could potentially pay off all outstanding debt and at the same time keep their assets intact and not be forced to sell them off."
7 MILLION after hours and up; to $33.13 plus SO FAR.....I would say the SMART SHORTS got the message!
"Don't let hedge funds and other manipulators break your spirit by taking the price of your investment and then driving it back down again. They do it to dash your hopes so you will sell and they can buy your shares...cheap. Don't feel too high when it goes up, or too low when it drops. That's the roller-coaster of emotions that these hedge funds and other manipulators use to break your spirit. DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $RIG"
"Greeny, better put some pedals on all those electric cars! 66$ oil and going higher."
STOCK BROKERS HIRED EMPLOYED 775 INTERNET AUTHORS TO MARKET STOCK BROKER PRICE CAPPED OIL STOCKS AND GOLD IN INTERNET. OIL STOCKS ARE PRICE CAPPED AND THEY ARE MARKETED SO THAT THEY CAN GET YOUR MONEY. DO YOU SEE THE DODGY GAME THEY ARE PLAYING ON YOU? YOUR STOCK VALUE WONT INCREASE IN THE NEXT 3 YEARS
The biggest problem for shareholders is the complete flip from low debt and being able to pay dividends even in low oil price environment to this big acquisition and huge debt. It seems to me that the shareholders should have been made aware of a possible acquisition like this and the change in philosophy.
Bought an additional 100 shares at the close for $37.54... Made $20 on my first 100 (from $37.34).. Pretty pleased with the movement so far - might have actually come close to hitting the bottom? Time will tell!!
"This is Lehman of oil, they got nobody to blame than themselves with that acquisition. Once Icahn bails on the commons at small loss, you will know its over before it’s officially over. Buffet will get stock quarterly and unload at his 10% premiums adding to dilution. Oil is not moving in time to save them. Even in a $30 oil environment with this balance sheet it’s just prolonging the end. What else do they have to do to signify they are toast, they crushed the payroll, cancelled the dividend and yes it will be fully cancelled by q3. I think the CEO is working for free at this point. Once this tests 9$ again it’s not hitting double digits again."
"Two pieces of good news:1. Bank of America raises OXY to BUY with $30 price target.2. $190 oil possible says JP Morgan based on the incredible contraction of investment in new wells and the shuttering of old wells. When demand resurges after the pandemic collapses, it will take some time to ramp up production again: $190 oil in 2025'"
"Meanwhile in Omaha, Buffet wakes up to yet another day of getting 2.2 million dollars in interest from the OXY loan! I am sure he is smiling as he walks to the bathroom!Wait, that interest also gets paid over the weekend, right???? :)"
We could see $26-27 today. Oil is at a phenomenal price and could continue to climb.
Raymond James 40 after report ..Merril Lynch 42 after the report....case in point look at the possible % gains....60% ...find any tech stock than can possible move 60% ...even the wallstreet baby apple would ahve to go up 720 billion dollars to get 60%
"Just some musings; Oil production has been in a massive decline for 3 months. OPEC+ has reduced production by 'Professed 9.7mb. U.S. production has dropped by nearly 3 million barrels. SA dropped another 1 million for a short time. All domestic producers have ground Capex to near $0. They also are projecting that Capex stays down for an extended time, at least a year. Not one, not 5, but nearly All domestic producers. To add to this, Bankers are wary of issuing cheap debt for oil. Its going to be much higher interest rates, and difficult to run through the hoops. This has already happened. Banks will NOT save the smaller producers so that they can 'Ride' out the storm. This in turn will continue the pressure of BK. Now, here's the Nugget;The 'Bigs' might acquire these BK wells, but they aren't going to reopen them any time soon. Money is not cheap right now. And there is a reason these firms went BK, relative high cost of production. This is going to change the landscape of domestic oil IMO. There is going to be a lot of long term shut ins. The 'Bigs' just wont reopen them until profitable. $50-$60/oil. (IMO this is sustained in 12 months, no later). By then, the consumption machine will have cleared its tailpipes and the reality of consumption going into summer '21 will be upon the world. But, production will be lagging. Maybe not by much at that time, but the drawdowns will create enormous pricing support.This brings me to OXY, who knows what they sell off. Who knows how much dilution will become reality. But, OXY is Much larger today, and even after divestment of assets, than they were a year ago. $60/SP a year ago will most likely be here again in 1 year. And with $100 oil, and rising, $80 OXY is a reasonable target.Just a thought."
"Here's a puzzle for all of you, whether long or short:OXY January 2022 $22.50 calls closed at $5.07 each. Bid $4.50; offered $5.50.Now how much would a July 2027 $22 call -- reflecting another 5.5 years of possible stock movement -- be worth today, given the implied vol above? Here's a hint: the value rises with the time frame.Think about it, because I think I just got a very nice present courtesy of Carl Icahn. Indeed I'll buy more Monday morning, just to let him know I like presents like this."
"I don’t care where oil is at, oxy will not move up unless they work on their debt especially the 2021 debt I don’t know how much is due. If that happens and they pay 2021 debt this will easily be a $20 stock. Until then $13-16 range."

***** I noticed nobody mentioned that Vicky revealed that OXY recently sold their natural gas leases in Utah........ also that they have started up operations once again with their drillship in the GOM. also have resumed operations with their JV partner Ecopetrol........ so they are starting to fire up on more cylinders as we see improvements in this third quarter. In short they're producing more product for less capex..... efficiency is improving partially due to better results from synergies after the anadarko deal.
"Don't forget about Libyas oil blockade...""Libya's port blockade is set to keep the North African country's oil off the market until at least the fourth quarter of 2020, which, as devastating as it will be for Libyan oil revenues, could help reduce the expected global production glut by 65 percent, Rystad Energy said on Friday.""""With no immediate return of Libyan oil on the market, the expected global production surplus later this year could be just 58.6 million barrels or about one-third of Rystad Energy's previous forecast."""
"Oxy is now performed in line with its peers, which is an encouragement because it means the stock is more than likely has bottomed out. The stock will now perform sideways to shake out all the short-term investor. If Oxy makes good progress on asset sales and cost savings and shows that to its investors, the stock will start trending up. Of course, any good news with oil price will help shoot up its stock price."
When this hits 26.74 I will buy 10000 shares to make it green
Need to remind you that Warren Buffett’s announcement that he got out of the airlines back in May what is the perfect bottom? Or that he sold OXY only to watch it way way way outperform Berkshire Hathaway since then?
Please correct me if I'm wrong. The Africa / Middle East Assets that are now being offered for sale for $4.5b were projected in earlier projections by the Company to fetch $10b. And how much will the earning power be diminished after the sale which makes debt coverage an even bigger challenge than it is today after netting out saving from lower interest expense.

",***** R we seeing some strength in the stock as we get closer to ER?I posit......YES.... it's too big and too many people will know what's coming down the pipeline (no pun intended) ... big money knows the details and hence the news before the rest of us will ever........ if you're a swing trader I would concentrate on the volume for the next few days...... and see if it doesn't build gradually towards ER*****deepsub"
apparently investors love cheap oil. chevron and exxon are pretty much green. shell and bp been up almost 1 percent all day
"As more information comes out about the asset sale, for the current situation, it was actually a really well played sale.I read the paper in Casper and the bid submitted by the state of Wyoming was $1.2 Billion for everything or $225 million for only mineral deposits not including Trona.Instead, they sold everything except all oil and gas production to Orion for $1.3 billion.They unloaded an asset that has no value to an oil and gas company and got to keep all the potential oil and gas play. On top of that, according to other reports the production of the play in this area is FCF in operation.I know it isn't a sexy $10 billion shaving of debt, but this is actually a well thought out transaction."
Highest Q FCF since 2011 gotta mean some to conter weight the debt ratio to share value...
"74 to 38, when is someone on the board going to admit and try to fix this major error. They can’t keep ignoring the stock price! Until Vicki is gone stock will keep dropping. No buyers of the stock with her there."
"wow, it gives 2 days gains back in 25 seconds :("
STOCK WILL KEEP CRASHING BECAUSE STOCK BROKERS WANT THE CRASH TO CONTINUE.
"this is the very first wave of the rotation and the vaccine occupying more and more of the headlines... there will be slow and possibly turbulent clime to $20 , getting there in December... that's my thesis"
Friends as I said yesterday and I wi repeat there is a high probability OXY will go up to 40 impulsively that’s how financial market works don’t ask how or why.
it is true that oxy needs a catalyst. odds are the energy is oversold. I didn't know what the catalysts will be
Guys research before you post...Carl Icahn is selling some shares and yet IT WILL BE ABOUT 10% OF HIS ENTIRE FUND VALUE. after he sells..alot of funds cannot have more than a certain % in one stock....he averaged down to about 14 per share so he is doing great...and probably expects the stock to go up another 30-40% this year....nothing is a guarantee so for risk management he probably had to sell some
"With the chart I?m looking at. Technicals, it is only halfway through the climb. No #$%$ end of the week we could see 28"
"“Based on what was said on the call, investors shouldn’t be worried about a dividend cut for the foreseeable future” unless there is an oil price collapse or seizure in the credit markets, David Katz, the president of Matrix Asset Advisors, tells Barron’s."
I am still long this stock. The debt needs to be reduced and Vicki needs to accept the responsibility that her decision in 2019 to buy APC for the amount has not paid off. Again in my opinion there should not be any bonus paid to Vicki for 2019 performance. I am waiting to read the 10-Q to see how she is compensated for 2019 performance.
"With OXY's most recent report, oil ministers claiming they want 85+ oil, and Israel Iran trading rockets, $100 is near. And with all that Permian oil 2Q could be huge IMO......"

"I do not understand why it does not turn green like 90% of the other oil companies, if all the news of OXY is old and Wall Street does not even talk about them."
"as much as you guys think is bad. don't forget one thing, for the 11 million shares that were sold today, there were 11 million shares that were bought"
Only thing that can pull oxy back is new lockdowns being announced in US and Europe. Hope it doesn’t put brake to oxy rally in short run
When will the commander in chief take the Pfizer vaccine in public. Hope soon
The whole oil sector has bonds that have been downgraded like Occidental this morning. Trump administration will be intervening with Russia and Saudi Arabis. Oxy is not participating in the rally due to downgrade. . I believe that Carl Icahn will duke this out with the company and the stock will rise. Just have to be patient.
How will the northeast pipeline hack affect prices ?
"Lots can happen here with OXY....may fall further when deal is finally inked...CVX may up the ante...though I doubt it...they are way too smart for that. Buying CVX calls is a good bet, but could backfire if they do the unexpected and up the ante, or even bid for EOG or FANG....Only given is, APC goes higher....guaranteed.......buying lots of APC stock and calls in my trading account. Will wait to see if I can get OXY cheaper when the deal is declared official."
How many analysts came out with buy ratings on OXY since earnings??? Who are they and what are their price targets???
OXY will hit $30 by the end of this week....and $35 if an asset sale is announced
"Time to take the beer goggles off and look at OXY differently than I have recently. The biggest issue for me is who to believe and trust?OXY mgmt did not inspire confidence after this CC. I thought after the Q1 call, they were honest and after the Q2 call they were evasive.Analysts have too much of a spread from $8 to $33 between them, much like Mehmet and Stefan.Warren is happy w his 8% preferred, but no one else is. Really the only one I trust is Icahn. He has the best insider guidance with his BOD seats and the most skin in the game, but even so, by the time we learn of his moves, the situation is changed..."

We may see testing of the $17.50 resistance again and a possible dip this Friday. I‘m already at 20% (more than what I have allotted), so I may decide to buy or just leave it at that. OXY’s deadline for asset sale bid is July 1st, we’ll hear good news, hopefully. I’m long and holding, but the same time I don’t want to be one of the guys swimming naked when the tide goes out - so what I’m saying is moderate risk (don’t risk too much on one stock that you buy high and forced to sell low)."

So according to the news the new energy secretary called the Saudi leader at the opec meeting stressing how important affordable energy is.....??? but yet the same administration is touting the end of oil anyway ...so opec and opec plus should cut their profits now so that later there are none at all ....its one thing to integrate alternative energy but hear that possibly that they are pushing for all electric cars and other.{.even the saudis have wind farms } and then expect oil producing nations not to be concerned is fool hardy..actually they could adopt a strategy of every increasing crude prices to offset the progressively lower demand..business 101..if the world demand drops by 50% in 20 years maybe crude will stay over a 100

"Vanguard added 39.41% or 29,287,765 shares in Q2 to take their total to 103,610,730 and in the process have leaped over Carl into the #2 spot behind only Dodge & Cox's 117M= shares"
The notes repurchase is big news. I suspect they are close to sell their assets (or maybe have sold already and just waiting for proceeds). The strategy would be to buy back debt cheap before announcing the asset sales. If they announced asset sales first whoever owns the debt notes will never sell for cheap knowing that they have cash in their hands.
"A Director just bought 10,000 shares of OXY at $13.43. OXY is one of Ichan's largest holders. This stock is going higher as oil price increases. The risk/reward here is tremendous."

Why would the most patient investor on the planet bail after less than a year? Did he need the cash? or did he want preserve the cash?There are a lot of good people on this board. Thank you for your time and candor, it was a great education.Good luck to all who have had long position for a very long time."

"I doubt you are reading this Mr. Icahn. But if you or one of your assistants are, I just want to let you know that along with some of my colleagues want to pledge my shares to increase your voting stake in removing the board.

Patience. Going much higher today
"I am looking at an $18,000 loss thanks to this acquisition. Even Chevron came out smelling like rose by comparison - and they lost!Quite frankly, OXY is on my list of worst investment decisions in the last five years."

"Great News ! Reliance started dealing with OXY : Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV), a division of US oil major Occidental, delivered carbon-neutral oil to Reliance, the firm said. ""This transaction, which was arranged in conjunction with Macquarie Group's Commodities and Global Markets group (Macquarie), is the energy industry's first major petroleum shipment for which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the entire crude lifecycle, well head through combustion of end products, have been offset,"" it said."
That was the easy flip on calls ever. So predictable. Bought yesterday and sold today for 100% profit.
"I just voted my OXY shares. It's due by 5-28-2020.It tells you that the Board of Directors recommends voting ""for"" on all the directors and issuing new stock. I voted ""against"" on every single director and every single issue including issuing new shares. They should have allowed me to vote on the horrible deal and I may have voted differently. I suggest you vote ""against"" on all too."
The chart is firming up. Next stop should be the 50 day moving average at $12.53.

Unbelievable what has transpired to our stock.OXY has always been a good investment for me until Hollub got the top job.What a disaster she has made out of a solid oil company with a generous dividend.I don't know how this BOD allowed this to happen ( grossly overpaying for APA ).This management has cost me $50000.00 of stock value and I'm sure some has lost more and some has lost less.It's seems incredible that something can't be done to hold these people accountable legally according to their slick handling of the transaction. I'm sure they sleep like a rock at nightJust venting my anger.

During Q4 2020 earnings call, cfo said he is aware that shareholders enjoy oxy's leverage with oil price thus it did not purchase any additional hedge ""yet"". 2. The investor relation when asked what it thinks about analysts' low target price last year November, it said analysts underestimate the power of leverage and oxy generates approximately $213 million fcf per $1 increase in wti."
Game is over for today. It is going to 23 when oil drops below 65….
Added 150 shares @ 25.50 total 1150 avarage 23.88.Oxy above 40 by July.Covid is on track to be gone for good.Crude will be hovering around 60 that’s a great price for oxy.Should see ther co2 capture bussiness on spotlight this year as well.
wonder how they will try to keep it down today once the cuts are official
I am actually surprised oxy was only down by 3% like othef peers.. Usually when wti goes down 4% oxy goes down like 6 to 8%
Can we get back to $29? With oil over $50. This should have been in the $30s a long time ago.
The hedge with a floor of $45.00 in and of it self is price less. Doesn't matter where the oil comes from right? Or how much?
If OPEC has their meeting in June and boosts production...watch out. OXY will be in the $40's. All oil stocks will sell off. That's what I am waiting for.
Pathetic performance compared to the rest of the sector!!!!!!

"40 million shares out of 980 million are short. That is 4%. Stop making excuses. This isn't shorts manipulating or any other conspiracy. This is a stock that has 0 investor confidence and saddled with debt in a market that is not guaranteed to cover.They need to restore investor confidence in their debt and atone for the absurdly bad deal they made in hindsight. They need to account for deliberately skirting around a shareholder vote. They need to sell assets and pay forward all their debt through 2021 without kicking in further down the road with new debt.Then they need to show earnings positive and beating expectations. The CEO and board need to prove to investors now that in the long run this was the most prudent path because right now nobody believes it was. Or they all need to be fired.-Or- Oil needs to shoot and stabilize above 50 and covid needs to disappear permanently. This isn't shorts this is normal people and institutions missing out on other opportunities who have grown tired of waiting for the pop that never came and slowly bleeding out.You cheapen your posts when you scream manipulation or shorts. You wanna bury your head in the sand thats fine but I got news for you, that ain't rain running down your leg"
Seems the market is coming to terms with a less than stellar recover post stimulus and oil is a dying business.
"Analyst just on CNBC. He said BEFORE the merger with Anadarko, Anadarko was worth $33 billion. NOW the value of OXY is around $33 billion. HE SAID YOU'RE GETTING OXY FOR FREE. Also with Ichan selling some, it has put undue pressure on the stock. Way undervalued here and dividend is safe!"

"OXY was UP 60% since early NOV. One has GOT to expect institutions and market makers to ring the cash register on that ... so OXY pulls back from that extraordinary move. Really ought to expect some tax-loss selling into end of the year, Oil has been strongly higher than $40/bbl. OXY's hedges at $40/bbl run out on 31 DEC. Realized sales price per bbl of oil rising/holding above $40 is all good for OXY."

Waiting for COST to announce then looking for an exit from them to acquire more Warrants. Sure hope OXY is still crying in its beer when I get more coin
"You guys keep posting about debt ..yes its a little high based on assets..but serviceable based on earnings as things recover...take a look at the big boys...MSFT 300 BILLION ASSETS 183 MILLION DEBT...AMAZON 225 BILLION ASSETS 163 BILLION DEBT...NETFLIX 33 BILLION ASSETS 26 BILLION DEBT XOM 360 BILLION ASSETS 164 BILLION DEBT ...OXY 100 BILLION ASSETS AFTER RIGHT DOWN 70 BILLION IN DEBT... THE KICKER IS THAT EVEN THOUGH MANY OF THE HIGH FLYERS HAVE ABOUT 55-65% DEBT TO EQUITY AND OXY IS 70% MANY TECH NAMES HAVE BILLIONS OF ""GOODWILL "" TACKED ON WHICH IN MANY CASES IS VALUELESS WHEN THINGS GET TOUGH.....IF YOU WERE OUTRIGHT BUYING A COMPANY YOU WOULD FEEL BETTER ABOUT HARD ASSETS THAN GOOD WILL"
TRADERS EXPECT -5 TO -10% CRASH TODAY.
"The U.S. economy is at an ""inflection point"" with expectations that growth and hiring will pick up speed in the months ahead, says Fed Chair Powell. ""We feel like we're at a place where the economy is about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly, so the principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again,"" Powell said. https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-powell-u-economy-inflection-145344285.htmlHang in there longs; OXY will head to $40 as the economy reopens and oil demand picks up."
Congrats Longs - OXY today is behaving like OXY before the acquisition-
"No mention of multi million $ investment by United Air in Oxys new carbon reduction company?? Only over analysis of debt burden continues on the board. No traders here could have made a fortune selling puts all the way down but fear kept the analysts crippled,they refused to use the volatility to their advantage ho trader jethro"
"Buffet going to be the banker for OXY, that’s why OXY will do well in the future. Div cut was a good move and hope to see the div increased as cost of oil go’s up in the future. Go longs"
Looks like oil will turn today higher and oil stocks will move higher as traders take position for earning seasons. This movement has held steady each qtr
***** crude oil already up over 4% at this hour..... looks like a lot of bounce per ounce today!*****deepsub
Is it possible that Icahn is putting this news out to cheapen warrants so that he can load up on warrants while reducing stock holding? Two birds in one stone: Increase warrant holding at lower price and lighten up stock holding to bring down its dollar weight on his overall portfolio.
Weird stock. Now that WTI is down to 62.29 and this barely moves an inch
They back from martini lunch yet? should be a quick return to 26 around 2:30
Case in point spotify 55 billion dollar market cap...have they ever had earnings ..here you go bobbo shopfy zoom etc etc
Icahn is about to increase his stake in OXY. Follow the dots.
I voted laying off Vicki
"As I see it OXY has behaved rather well considering the oscillation in WTI from $67 to $63. Only a few months ago that oscillation in WTI would have taken OXY to $22 or even lower. Whether this relative newfound strength in price of OXY shares has merit or not only time will tell. I still believe WTI is destined to trade at $70 in the near future and that OXY may reach $38- $40 per share when that happens, but I also believe that for OXY to really become an investment grade company, regardless of the going price of WTI it is imperative that it lower its debt load by about 30% during 2021. Failing to do that I believe OXY will be sentenced by the marketplace to trade rangebound between $22 to $30 per share. I also believe that as long as WTI stays above $60 the current OXY share price below $30 makes it an attractive candidate to be taken over by one of the major oil companies."
"As long as WTI stays above $40 (it is now stabilizing around $45-$47 per barrel) everything else is minutia including the $38 debt. If the medium term forecast (2023-2025) of $75-$90 for the price of a barrel of oil is increasingly seen to be correct, OXY will be swimming in money and will become the must buy target of one of the major oil companies. Time will tell."
Some think I'm an idiot and that's OK. But I think this is the elephant in the closet! Oxy has positioned themselves with carbon engineering. Oxy low carbon ventures will alow Oxy to take part in carbon capture for profit as it becomes mandated through legislation. For this reason as the economy starts back up I'm bullish and for the carbon capture initiative I'm bullish. https://www.squamishchief.com/local-news/shopify-buys-into-carbon-engineerings-carbon-removal-service-3529090?fbclid=IwAR1a_rQsqvPpO2Jw7VbaDMiBehZM__lxvnA-f2L-rtC23S-aq6ROg4t64Ss
Vicki the time you have been waiting for to announce your asset sale is tonight
We are one week away from XOM & CHV reporting. This entire sector should start to move the next 3 weeks.
"Oxy need 40$ OIL to pay all cost(dividend, interes etc etc), that is only what you need to know"
"Hi-ho, Kermit here! Market strategists are bracing for the biggest jump in oil demand ever after drivers returned to the roads en masse. Goldman Sachs has predicted a 14pc jump in commodity prices over the next six months, pushing a broad measure of metals and oil up to its highest level in more than six years.$BP $SU $CNQ $IMO $ENB $OXY"
"How much is this stock up since Cramer’s last call , DON’T BUY OXY’. 80%?"
***** @ the open...... it appears that the market likes news of that one and a half billion dollar drawdown in debt...... too early to tell yet but out of the gate she's trying to move... HIGHER*****deepsub
$4.81 more and I'm even! =) Hoping 2021 oil market continues this nice run! Congrats all longs it's been a long wait!
"From Investors Business Daily >>>>>""""The Relative Strength (RS) Rating for Occidental Petroleum (OXY) entered a new percentile Wednesday, with an increase from 69 to 81. The move into 80-plus territory makes Occidental Petroleum stock one to watch."""""

Oxy always lags the majors. But we we get there
"I have a 12/16 strangle for 5/22 so I'm happy with any large movement, but I'm still bearish overall. Think too many people are focused on the spot price and not on the fundamentals of the company.The dilution vote is the most obvious challenge to shareholders, Hollub clearly has zero respect to common shareholders after the Anadarko deal so the restructuring team coming on board is a huge red flag.Buffet didn't make any moves on his common shares, but he's protected by his sweetheart deal - preferred shares and dividend that everyone on this board has no access to. Icahn's position is interesting but again, I think with his board access he's protected unlike common shareholders. I have 0 doubt OXY as a company will survive and thrive, but I do have significant doubt that they won't wipe out common shareholders along the way. Even though oil futures are recovering, there's significant challenge to the current cash flow. Huge volatility isn't much better than low prices for a company. Hedges included, $30 is still sustenance level - and OXY isn't lean enough for sustenance only.With the entire market on steroids, I just see no benefits to long term gambling on the stock. It's great for short term options plays because of the volatility, but that's a very different game."
I POSTED HERE AT 31.5 US DOLLARS SHARE PRICE WAS PRICE CAP BARRIER SET BY STOCK BROKERS. MANIPULATED OCCIDENTAL HAS BEEN GOING DOWN SINCE. THIS WEEK OCCIDENTAL STOCK SHARE PRICE CRASH WILL SPEED UP. I EXPECT 9 US DOLLARS SHARE PRICE IN THE NEXT 3 MONTHS.
OXY = $25 by then end of 2020 ....
If you not in for the long haul then just listen to these shorts and sell. Have some patience! Market is red and consolidating before going to higher highs. Can’t have all Green Day’s.
They have almost 10 million acres in the middle east in addition to their massive holdings here
"The country is post pandemic, everything is open, there is vaccines for all, best crude draw of the year, great labor market data, oil is at top dollar, big oil beating expectations and OXY price don’t move."
"Here’s a thought for all of you . WB’s warrants do not have to be exercised . However , if he does eventually exercise them Occidental Petroleum receives the funds :80,000,000 x $62.50 =Five Billion Dollars into OXY’s checking account . When and or if that happens that is not a bad thing for the Company ."
I’m just here for the daily @W meltdown!
Where are the shorts now hahahahaha
WTI $45 can bring OXY to $16.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Looks like Mr Clean muted me. Was it something I said?
Here is an idea that works on all boards..the posters who clearly post their position long or short ..aka do you own put calls or stock stay ..or the other noise mute
one of the few stocks thst hasnt recovered to pre covid levels of $40 a share. discount of almost 40 percent
"I need help to understand following statements from Oxy Q3 earning slides:1. $0.9 B Retired with debt issuance proceeds -> Does it mean that Oxy paid this debt? If yes, how?2. $1.3 B Debt repaid -> Does it mean that Oxy paid this debt? If yes, how?I was under the assumption that above statements mean the Oxy paid above mentioned debt somehow, but Oxy 10-Q form doesn't reflect the same change in long-term debt from Q2 to Q3. They mentioned ""In October 2020, Occidental fully redeemed the remaining variable rate notes due August 2021 for $377 million, and Occidental paid $1.0 billion of the Term Loan with proceeds from the sale of mineral and surface acres located in Wyoming, Colorado and Utah. After this payment, $446 million of the Term Loan remained outstanding."" in debt activity. Does it mean that the debt payment will be reflected in Q4 earning report because the activity occured in October?"
Q4 earnings are “whatever” but who drives through the rear view mirror of past earnings. Oil WTI is $62.20 as I type and Goldman says $72 WTI is coming. I’m trying to buy more OXY tonight
Cdc decision just now beside being great news for the US it will allow tens of millions of people to go back to work ...millions of cars...hundreds of thousands of ubers and a travel explosion...demand should soon spike way up...next week will not show because 15 million barrels could not leave storage due to the pipeline issue
"I didn’t buy OXY at the low 10’s but at the high 12’s, don’t regret this investment, just waiting for the high 20’s by year end"
One thing about undervalued stocks is that sometimes they become even more undervalued. That's what seems to be happening with OXY. Looks like we may be bottoming out just below $63. Wish OXY management would speak up in light of recent developments.
"True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so, wants nothing.Seneca"

Too good stock. Too good price. Too good happy. 
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-reports-continued-momentum-executing-145300754.htmlNews coming out that Oxy will making progress on reducing debt, by mid 2020, they will sell 10-15 billions in assets and all apply to debt. As long as oil is at this level and they are making on debt reducing, I am OK with holding the stock. The short is trying to bring it down, put options are so rich so if I am a put holders (which i am not), I would sell to capture the significant gain since the earnings. May Icahn hold those put options, LOL. The house never loses on options."
"Mehmet, sorry we are leaving"
"There is always 2 sides which is healthy. I think she did what she felt was the right decision. She was working on this for 2 years so she did not just decide to buy it because if Chevron. She bought it because she knows whats inside the box, and thats a whole lot of oil. Selling off non USA assets has already started, the next will be Shell.If you don't like the deal then you can sell, but this deal is far from over.I say Great job Vicky, you made the decision now show the naysayers you were right!!"
OXY is a $35/sh stock in 12 months and oil is $55/bl.
Remember USA was in lockdown January and Feb and they still beat expectations
Google countries Fiscal break evens for oil.....you can easily se that EVERY OIL PRODUCER...not just some need oil in the 60s or higher....look at the long lists...some have enormous breakevens like IRAN ..YES THIS IS FISCAL BREAKEVENS...because in some countries their whole economies are paid by oil....take a look before you post
Today’s perfomance was to get anyone mad...
"Buffett 10 billion dollar move is at the expense of the other stockholders on OXY who cannot raise 10 billion and get 8% interest and warrants to buy the common stock as a convenient price. But this is all in the short term, and don't expect Buffett to be a nice guy while he is making tons at your expense. There is only one remedy for the remaining shareholders, those who are not leveraged up to the hilt, stay the course, this not not a sprint race, this is a marathon run."
it was stated about 6 months ago that they could improve production by about 70% plus or minus in Anadarko wells and lower costs ...that is a massive amount of oil
"Yes the exact words were if short seller bet against the market they will"" make sure that they ouch like hell"" and that the market will never be left unattended"
Over reaction. Debts are not maturing yet and that’s why they have room to play with. The earning is good and it will be better next quarter. Be patient longs!

"This dope has worked against wall street at every turn. Yet the street is currently giving him a pass His policies handicap businesses with tax hikes and regulations and putting a lot in a competitive disadvantage yet the street is giving him a pass. His regulations against the oil companies are only raising the price of oil and gas. It's actually helping the oil companies and hurting the public with higher gas prices so oil companies stock have been going up. This will come to an end people. This dope is creating massive inflation and it will come home to roost. There will be a day coming soon where the street finally comes to the realization that his policies are hurting companies and the markets will crash. Don't think you can raise taxes massively, add more regulations, create inflation and it not matter. There are also a lot of young liberal investors that think he's doing a good job because they are stupid. A 20% ± correction. I'm getting out because I really believe it's coming."
The Warrants are just.....Unbelievable!!!!
Is this being held down in price by market pressures or funds selling? They seem to be hitting on all cylinders yet stock has been crushed???

We will mostly see $25 next week. Stay strong longs!!!
Based on Marathon's preliminary Q1 result. I expect 800 million to 1 billion free cash flow for Oxy's Q1. This is taking Texas damage and their reduced cash flow from colombia asset sale into account with average $55/barrel unhedged.
"Getting sick of these people who short and attack anyone who posts positive news on Oil or Oxy. We are all aware of the debt that Oxy has, reason why many are long because the current Oil price will comfortably cover the debt repayments. You constantly single out Oxy but the oil stocks are all taking a hit. If it was just oxy we would notice that they are in trouble. A recovery is bound to happen but not sure when as long as oil has a positive outlook for the price of a barrel in which it does. All Oxy needs is the price of oil to stay above 40. At 45 a barrel has them in really good financial position and anything on top is a bonus. Guess what I'm not getting paid but am optimistic in the long run OXY will hit 30. In the meantime for those who short and make money and who ever buys in for long I wish you all a good return on your investment."
Load up under $70 and come see me in 6 months...........
day trader noise..... 40 this summer....

David Katz of Matrix Asset advisors on CNBC said he thinks OXY could trade 20% higher.......jmho
Insiders have been buying a lot of shares recently. They know a little more than we do.
the long weekend will food the airwave with news stories of the increased vaccine roll out and dropping Covid cases. Thursday will be a broad upswing across the market reflecting this positive sentiment... then OXYs forecast will be strong and on Wednesday the stock will se $29....
"I got oxy at 40 I got oxy at 20 I got oxy at 1750 hoping I can make a couple of dollars only 5,000 shares I know that's not much but"
"My take in yesterday's call: timing difference money paid for inputs and money received for outputs. Also, oxy took care of Q1 business, i.e. paying taxes, contributing to pensions, etc. This is what businesses do. Lots of encouraging stuff in yesterday's call. I especially appreciate the mention about returning to IG status. There was even talk about about dividend possibilities. All this with a return to profitability. GOOD stuff!"
Right under your noses Oxy will develop a CO2 business that will be as massive as the largest nat gas businesses . They will have plants the pipelines and the tecnology...take some time and look at the canadian company that they are part owners of with Bill Gates and Chevron...this is what will make this stock a keeper....the will love them and as govt pressure mounts more and more companies will be clamoring to sign up...in the beginning that will get consulting fees and then actually sequestation fees either way the more toward carbon capture could be put in high gear by the new regime...remember they stated that the first plant has the net affect of tesla on the environment ...and every single tesla is heavily subsidized by the govt
"Ok...so, I am still not completely sure what to do with my Aug 37.5 call options - am I SOL and just let them expire, or exercise with the hope of making a profit on the warrants? I am still Bullish on OXY with rise in WTI."
OXYs latest guidance gives it a projected revenue of around $10-11 Billion in 2020 . Assumes $23 WTI 8ooM for preferred2.5B CAPEX2.5B interest 350M Common Div Can they afford to pump it out of the ground and pay everyone ? Total operating expenses alone could eat up all the revenue for the year . Personally I hope they pull it off . Realistically I don’t see it .
We need management to announce an asset sale and all proceeds to used for debt reduction!!!
Lousy volume!
Expect oil and oil stocks to pivot for earnings seasons. 4/21 timing which is a week before CHV & XOM reports
"CNBC had an oil trader on and he picked 4 oil stocks ( if he had to choose, basically said stay away from the oils ) , MRO , OXY , VLO and BP , but said OXY/APC deal could come out as a winner when all is said and done."
"***** months ago, when I predicted that it would be April fool's day 4 OXY to get to $30..... I was assuming it would stay above 30, so I'm still predicting the same..... as it has not held 30 the last couple days..... I'm still waiting for April fool's day to see it cross $30 and stay there and then climb higher.*****deepsub"
IMO OXY should monetize those idle shares and use the proceeds to eliminate all remaining 2021-22 debt .Some big asset sales ( Atleast those at premium prices ) will likely have to wait until the oil market is really much more stable and $10-20 a BBL higher
"Well people ... CV19 vaccine is flying over your house as I write to all you longs. Soon we’ll all have two pokes in the arm and a thirst to restart our economy. Travel, manny, shipping, new roads and so much more demand for energy. In 2021 when you’re flying to see your relatives, think about all that oil that’s needed to keep this economy rolling!"
Oil isn't down that much ??????
Patience is key brothers and sisters. Hold and come back in a month or 2 for a good reward 
Really!!!
So by way of anadarkoOxy is one of the topNatural gas suppliers in the US . Nat gas has moved to a yearly high . Can’t hurt
"OXY can easily sell some assets like Africa and other stuff, keep much Permian and Gulf of Mexico and put $2.5 billion towards future dividend. In time they will have huge operational savings by year 2 and much of excess debt paid down. These guysif anyone can, will produce oil low $20's or even teens... Berkshire hurts but if you turn a 35+% ROI in a few years for next 10+years the pain is worth it with a 6.5% dividend even if they done a steady 5%, adjustable with share price gains. Great reason to own long term... divy and 5% cap gains a year (10% combined) not bad"
they did not hedge oil. only natural gas. sounds good I guess they're expecting oil prices to maintain or go up
***** BAM !! And we are off to the races !!! LMAO.... this company is so undervalued that even in the face of any negativity...... it will gain traction...... it may not be as good as gold .... yet... but it's at least as good as copper......(pull up a three-month chart on copper)***** deepsub
"The time to short OXY has passed. You are kidding yourselves thinking this one is going to go bankrupt if oil gets above $35 then keeps steadily climbing. While I would agree the risk of bankruptcy is pretty high if oil stayed below $33-34 WTI, the chances of it happening are falling with every single cent oil prices rise. Once we cross the $35 WTI price and hold above it, bankruptcy will be an old option left laying on the table. We are the United States of America, we thrive and feed on debt if you haven’t noticed."
***** we have $62 oil again!! YAY !!!*****deepsub
get ready for an avalanche of predictable posts from W......
anyone knows a good broker for crude oil CFDs? i would like to buy 100x levered oil futures contracts

STOCK BROKER EMPLOYEE TROLLS - CONVINCE EXISTING SMALL INVESTORS TO HOLD BANKRUPT OCCIDENTAL OIL SHARES UNTIL YOU DROP THE PRICE TO 15 US DOLLARS. THEY WONT SELL BELIEVE ME!!!
"Down 5%. Are you depressed? Ease your mind with the fact that once we have semblence of normality in the world, this stock will be within the range of $30 to $40 at least. You will make 50 to 100 percent depends on whether you have stocks, warrants, and/or options. 1. Johnson and johnson vaccine comes out next week. I do not think its news is fully priced into recovery stocks. Why? Because no one knows the efficacy rate (it is not mRNA). Will it be effective, will it be approved by FDA? Very likely. Otherwise why would they prepare interim paper? They would toss it out like how Sanofi/Merck did if they didnt have acceptable data. Just know that 1. about a million people are being vaccinated daily 2. U.S. and many other countries' covid cases are declining significantly. 3. WTI is holding up at 52 dollars 4. Oxy's 2021 near debt maturity is mostly solved. 5. Oxy has secured plenty od permits on federal land lease (they already discussed about it on their 3rd quarter conference call). You know what I think to be quite honest? When we open up. We will have higher oil demand as we have seen in China and India. And companies like CHK went down and cannot produce like how they used to produce. Democrats wont give new permits and banks/stock exchange dont want another oil IPO. Have you even seen any oil SPAC merger? Lol... Just wait guys.. 50 percent return by the end of August. Oh yeah.. Good news from Israel, Pfizer vaccine is proven to be very effective now. It seems to have that full benefit when a person receives two shots."
This stock was in the 70’s last time oil was $59
"Odd that all oil stocks aren't following the price of oil. I'm guessing the negative Covid news in the last few days, but I think a good entry if you've been waiting or to add more. The recovery is happening, and money will be made."
Oxy is not moving up until they report. Right now we have not heard a peep from management. Until we get earnings and forward guidance expect volatility. I expect good news May 10
"Fixed and variable dividend possible, with production profile and chemicals supporting it, its to improve margins"
"Very, very nice. It feels very rewarding to see the things that you thought would come to pass actually come to pass! It is also very comforting to see that finally for OXY the trend is its friend!"

Turns out the Pfizer (PFE) CEO sold a ton of stock the day of the announcement of a vaccine. He also waited till after the election to announce the discovery. Crooks comes to mind.
Nasal spray approved in Israel for covid all variants until vaccinated
"#$%$ is this? FCF was only $200 million. Is this a joke? Their FCF was clearly $788 less $211 = $577... How do they present $1.6 billion in their presentation? But I do see that their current asset, espeically their A/R is $1 billion higher than Q4. If they have collected this cash, they are $1 billion + $577 = $1.6 billion FCF. I thought it was a joke but looking at numbers again while writing this... it is not too bad. Long OXY~!"
I was busy making dumplings last few days and only now I've checked news and boom ! I see this going up by 13% today enjoy the ride lads and Merry Christmas :)

"For 3.5 years nothing Vicki has said has come to light. Not in her lame town halls, not with WS. All smoke an mirrors. And in the utter failure of getting hosed on Anadarko and on the hook for a large sum of debt would have had her on a cross burning. She cut cap-x multiple times now, cut the divy (which by the way she professed would not happen), cut salaries of all workers, cut out all other perks including carpooling,gym, LTI and other stock payouts, and they even sent employees that were to help transition the Anadarko work by EOY home. A confident CEO know how to operate a business when times are tough - she's failed miserably IMO. Ta can boast all ya want in good times but the tale of the tape is when times are tough. Come May, she's toast!! Same with Cedric and Glenn. Maybe now Glenn can wear his Hawian shirt on a beach."
I sold my OXY shares and warrants. My cost for OXY shares was 45 USD per share. I sold them at 20 USD share price. I am now a short side investor. I have 10 000 short OXY shares and OXY put options. I will profit if OXY shares go down below 20 USD
OXY needs to close the gap on the chart at $26.27. I think it will during the first half of 2021. Long and strong.
Big congratulations to all who bought fear one month ago. Hold tights to 40´s

"Interesting than none of the players..none even the largest are acting like 48 brent is the end run...its very clear that they are on a path to recovery ....as a guess they probably all need and want brent about 5-7 higher this will be profitable and prevent too much drilling and excess supply. The beauty here is that all the player are ""on it"" and they all need the same thing...if things even hold here oxy should be in the mid to high 20s....low capex and no dividend....and even the 5 billion in sales helped ..removed or will remove about 300-350 million in interest ....all players are under the gun to return more to shareholders cap ex budgets will be tweaked and wallstreet will temper back revenue growth expectations in favor or free cash flow"
JnJ vaccine pause not enough to cause a disruption for the economy reopening and the amount of potential side effects is minuscule.

Current debt holders would revolt if this merger was put through and earnings were not stellar
Big volume in the last 2min today. Lets see what API has in store for us this evening
It's not like OXY was doing anything for shareholders staying idle. An expensive purchase to aquire a company that is inefficiently extracting resources for which OXY can definately turn around...I don't see the future downside with the exception to oil prices. All I see is top and bottom line growth. Question is will it sustain the debt taken on from purchase. Don't see Buffet lending 10 billion to a company he didn't believe it. JMO

"Once COVID is gone and the oil consumption increases to the norm, you will be amazed to see oil supply shortage next year around this time. We may witness a historical oil bubble.

"Demand for oil should pick up as lockdowns are slowly removed and more countries ease travel restrictions, while the rollout of vaccines still promises an end to the pandemic, he said. The concern, however, is that the rise in demand will be offset by rising oil supply as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, agreed last week to begin easing output curbs, while indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran could see sanctions against Tehran eventually lifted.“So, I can’t see oil prices rising significantly further. Brent has already struggled to stay above $70 and WTI couldn’t stay above $65 for long,” he wrote. “These will remain the key resistance levels going forward, and should prices rise again, I can’t see them holding above these levels for too long in 2021.”"

"Listening to many diff 'experts"" opinions is like a racing sheet for horses..you read them all and pick out what makes sense....The top thing that stood out ... the strong will survive and thrive..OXY was listed..how long it some said a long time..most said until two soverign powers make a decision for business reasons and not personal emotion ....most said what I knew already ...both Russia and The Saudis do not want to lose potentially 80-100 billion each in one year by selling oil at 35 instead of 55...Russia has a break even of about 42 for country expenses...that break even..the Saudis need 80 to balance their budget..both are close to maxx capacity so pumping 15% more below cost makes no sense at all ...the only result if it continues will be that the major players will buy the weak players in the permean and be even stronger. The US pumps about 14 million barrels and needs about 20 million per day...In addition to the lost revenue from oil for Russia and the Saudis the negative effects that spiral from an economic hit this large could affect every aspect of their economies and their public oil companies market caps just got pounded just like our..I think Aramaco is down about 450 billion in market cap ..bottom line this is out of control and shows you how life could be WITHOUT THE PERMEAN...if two feuding leaders can send the world into to turmoil imagine a world where all of our oil came from there ..my guess oil will be to wti of 45 and brent 50 within a month..by the way the hedge adds 10 for a third of production so it helps..."

"Bought OXY a while ago in 14s. In case the oil prices raise and stay between $45 and $50, my question to the ones who really understand the finances of this company is, do you believe we will see a dividend in 2021? If not, when do you believe it will happen? Would it be around $3.14 again? I will hold long regardless of the comments, but just curious what you guys think. $OXY and $CVI all the way! :)"

what do you guys think about Monday?

Each time we have climbed due to an event or draw we have subsequently maintained after the event has faded.As it pertains to OXY.

Oxy has strengthens its balance sheet and will sell very soon oil assets with about 6 billion usd. That would be boost the stock in the sky.

"Aug WTI crude oil closed on Thursday closed up +$0.83 at $40.65, Sep Brent crude oil closed up +$1.11 at $43.14.The energy complex on Thursday rallied to 1-week highs and settled higher. Crude prices on Thursday opened higher on strength in the monthly U.S. payroll report, which was positive for economic growth and energy demand. Crude oil prices extended their gains Thursday afternoon on a decline in active U.S. oil rigs.Thursday's U.S. monthly payroll report was supportive of economic growth and energy demand after Jun non-farm payrolls rose +4.8 million, stronger than expectations of +3.23 million. Also, the June unemployment rate fell to 11.1%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations.Comments on Thursday from Russian Energy Minister Novak were supportive for crude prices when he said the global oil supply this month may match demand, or even drop below, ""given the ongoing easing of lockdowns in many countries.""Other U.S. economic news on Thursday was mixed for crude prices. U.S. weekly initial unemployment claims fell -55,000 to 1.427 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 1.350 million. May factory orders rose +8.0%, weaker than expectations of +8.6%.Crude prices extended their gains Thursday afternoon after weekly data from Baker Hughes showed that active U.S. oil rigs fell by -3 rigs in the week ended Jul 2 to an 11-year low of 185 rigs.Global economic news was positive for economic growth and energy demand. China Jun auto sales rose +11% y/y to 2.28 million, the third straight monthly increase. Also, the Eurozone May unemployment rate rose +0.1 to 7.4%, showing a stronger labor market than expectations of +0.4 to 7.7%.Crude prices still have carry-over support from Wednesday's weekly EIA inventory data that showed crude inventories tumbled -7.20 million bbl, a much bigger decline than consensus of -800,000 bbl.Wednesday’s weekly EIA data showed that U.S. crude oil inventories as of June 26 were +15.1% above the seasonal 5-year average. U.S. crude production in the week ended June 26 was unchanged w/w at 11.0 million bpd, which was down by -2.1 million bpd (-16.0%) from Feb's record-high of 13.1 million bpd. Factors to consider:1) The OPEC+ production cut agreement of 9.7 million bpd for May-June and the deal to extend that cut in July at 9.6 million bpd, (2) The decline in U.S. and global oil production that is being forced by market conditions such as near-full oil storage facilities and a general lack of buyers.(3) The slump in active global oil rigs to a 21-year low, which will lead to lower global crude output.(4) The sharp decline in OPEC crude output as OPEC June crude oil production fell -1.93 million bpd to a 29-year low of 22.62 million bpd.(5) Hopes that China might eventually start importing U.S. crude oil on a larger scale after the mid-Jan U.S./China phase-one trade deal called for China to boost its purchases of U.S. energy products by $52 billion over the next two years.(6) The sharp drop in Iranian oil production due to U.S. sanctions and in Venezuelan oil production due to U.S. sanctions and domestic turmoil."

"I always ask myself this question. DO I want a 200% gain or will take a hit with 20-30% Unrealize loss. I always stand strong with the 200% gain. I temporarily became a millionaire last week, now back under $1 million. Hope to change the front number with OXY. I buy a house, get a girlfriend, and live happily after COVID is over."
BofA forecast $7 billion in free cash flow from Occidental between 2020 and 2021. OXY NEEDS BOOK ULCC
FED needs OIL price high for inflation....Printing money do not working for inflation 2%....we will see WTI much higher in next 3 months
"On good thing for OXY :State-controlled Ecopetrol of Bogota, Columbia, announced last month an aggressive development program in 2021 for its Midland Basin joint venture with Occidental Petroleum. Talked to friend out in the Permian who had worked for OXY saying they are drilling heavy in Midland County and hitting some good wells with this Joint Venture ."
Just because crude comes down 1% or 3%. It doesn't mean the stock will drop 10%. We all know things go up and down. Right?
I HOPE OXY FALLS MORE! i'm in the accumulation phase. i sold 14 shares of STX to get into 21 OXY shares last night AH. ill buy more if it goes under 30 and cuts the div 50%.
"Is Buffet going to merge OXY & CVX together or what? Wouldn't be surprised if that was the plan all along. OXY carbon capture technology is looking good right now, and who has finger prints on both companies at same time--merger get rid of redundancy and Berkshire Hathaway pockets the rest. Then throw in a billion dollars to boot."
"AAA, 47 million Americans traveling by road this thanksgiving holiday. Huge"
Why this massive 2 day sell-off? Oil is only down $.18 cents!
I’m very confused as to what’s happening....is OXY’s revised offer higher/ a better deal for APC?
Hold on!!!! We are about to break through this mess. 40’s soon...
"royal dutch has a big div too, and just promised to jack it up in the next few years since their big acquisition a few years back. bp has a big yield too."
"Oxy....the Pearl of Permian...best oil environment worldwide.We will see 40 USD very quichükley or a takeover by Icahn and buffet. It is a bargain and the heart of American oil production.OXY has suffered along with the general market malaise in Q-1, with shares dropping almost 80% at their lows. The company has staged a resounding recovery in recent weeks, attaining over half their pre-crash valuation. This rise hasn’t escaped the analyst’s attention at BoA, moving the company to a “Buy,” today from neutral, citing the potential for the company to generate as much as $7 bn in Free Cash flow over the next year and a half.Raymond James, an energy securities analyst has reiterated a “Strong Buy,” on the company citing a 9% Free cash flow yield.If you accept my argument that oil prices are headed higher an investment in OXY could be a good way to play this bet. OXY currently is the Permian’s largest producer with daily liftings of 442K BOPD, with its lowest cost at $6.25 per BOE. As prices for oil continue to rise the company will benefit from an aggressive hedging program and higher overall production."
"""Oxy Adds to Cuts and Icahn Wins Board AppointmentsOxy stated Wednesday that it will now reduce its 2020 capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion. The firm explained the revised figure represents a decrease of $2.7 to $2.9 billion from its original 2020 guidance of $5.2 to $5.4 billion. The 2020 capital budget projection in place from March 17 until Wednesday’s announcement ranged from $3.5 to $3.7 billion. Oxy noted that its most recent $2.5 billion capex budget amounts to “a midpoint reduction of 47 percent” against the original target.According to Oxy, the company now expects 2020 annual production from continuing operations – at current commodity prices – to range from 1.275 to 1.305 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). That equates to a six-percent decrease from prior guidance ranging from 1.36 to 1.39 million boepd, the firm added.Oxy also stated that it will reduce its 2020 operating and corporate costs by at least $600 million against the original 2020 plan. The cuts include “significant salary reductions for executive leadership,” the firm noted. In addition, it pointed out the opex and corporate cost reductions augment $1.1 billion in previously announced operating and overhead cuts that should be fully implemented this year.The company also stated that it expects its “combination of synergy realizations and additional cost reductions” to yield approximately $500 million in future quarterly run-rate costs in selling, general and administrative (SG&A), other operating expense and exploration overhead. The firm noted that it anticipates 2020 domestic operating costs to fall to approximately $7 per barrel of oil equivalent given the newly announced operating cost reductions.""https://www.rigzone.com/news/oxy_adds_to_cuts_and_icahn_wins_board_appointments-26-mar-2020-161513-article/"
"Most oils down 1-3% , OXY down over 7% what does that say about earnings !"
"What's funny are the trolls (Emily) on this board asking why Buffet sold his shares. He invested 10B and still has it invested with them. Fact. He bought additional shares on to of that. He was smart and sold at a much higher price and put it into Chevron for appreciation and the dividend. Ichan still has a ton of OXY stock, diversified and sold a small portion. OXY has consolidated nicely and I have a target of $46 by summer. Cheers!"
Todays sell off could be a great buying opportunity...If I had more funds I would add to my OXY position...jmho
"Typical, lol"
there is gonna be some seriois SQUEEZING taking place between now and Friday........
"There is hard cap at 24.5 USD share price. OXY Market Maker cannot let OXY price to stay above 24.5 USD. Upside potential is 5%. OXY is a bankrupt company 39 billion USD debt, 12 billion Market Capitalization technical bankruptcy!!!"
"***** A/H trading shows oil now firmly above $66/bbl........ this action along with the big drawdowns in crude and gasoline reported by API...... should be the start of a strong move higher by the sector tomorrow morning......... and remember OXY fans........,................ when it comes to low carbon oil..........OXY-clean= OXY-green !! (vbg)*****deepsub"
"Buffet has both preferred and common shares. His initial investment is $10B preferred shares which carries a 8% dividend. He also bought from the open market of 20 million common shares at a price of ~$40. The dividend for common shares is always cash. The dividend for preferred share with Buffet can be cash or common stock, decided by OXY. If it is common stock, it is at a price of 90% of ""Average 10 days closing price after dividend declaration"", which is about $34.461. So on April 15th, OXY either will pay Buffet $200million, or 5.8 million shares (5.8million * 34.461 = $200million). If OXY pays with common shares, Buffet will have 25.8 million common shares, which is 2.5% of the company. Buffet is bound to prosper or die with OXY."

According to SEC fillings Icahn ?has sold 15 million shares. Does anyone know how many more does he intend on selling by May 1st
"My fellow OXYs,Is this a good way to look at OXY?1. OPEC is currently meeting to talk about OIL and it looks like OPEC will NOT agree to cut oil OUTPUT2. This means there will be TOO MUCH oil in the market3. This means that OIL price per barrel will go LOW in the $50's4. This means that OXY stock will be NEGATIVELY AFFECTED i, because OXY has purchased APC and now has some 40 Billion dollars debt5. This means that OXY stock price will be in the $38 range and this means that OXY must find other ways to pay its debt6. Possible ways to pay the debt is to cut the DIVIDEND7. If the DIVIDEND is cut, people will be mad and the OXY stock price will be DOWN to the low $30's range8. This means the OXY company will have MORE problems due to its massive DEBT and low stock price...9. Did I miss something?Peace!"
"Hey are you ok shorts, you look pretty low....."
Expecting to go higher later today - expecting green close .
I feel like even if theres a surprise they would find a way to keep the stock even lmaooooo I just hate the manipulation here
It is more than 2 dollars down since opening price today. Keeps going down when oil is green. Can someone explain why?
"MARK THIS POST: A perfect symmetrical triangle is forming on the CPE chart, within the horizontal channel. Within 4 trading days CPE will break, either up or down by around $7 a share. I don't see it breaking down but I can't say for sure. Assuming that's it's up, we are going to see a minimum of $43/share. If that end up spelling the big breakout from the channel then it will likely break up to around $43, then pull down to around $40 and then bounce off of $40. If that happens, we're dialed in for that big move that we've been waiting for. This is a bold prediction but this is what the chart says.If this happens to CPE, most other oil stocks will probably move also!Entertainment purposes only.

"OXY trading as if oil was at $40???? makes 0 sense. Seriously. GS has oil at $65 this year. I say we are going higher, much higher. Sooner or later sleepy Joe will wake up and realize oil and gas industry employs a ton of people"
"Severe shortage of chlorine for swimming pools, supplies are being rationed and prices have doubled and Occidental is one of only two domestic suppliers."
"Wooooah,,, crude is collapsing!"
AS EXPECTED CRASH CONTINUES IN THE PRE MARKET
WTI Oil broke $60 this AM. If it holds companies like OXY will gap upward.
"A) It is in not in any oil producers' interest for the price of a barrel of oil to remain at current levels for any prolonged period of time because it would cause pandemonium to those countries’ budgets. B) Oil companies employ many, many people thus it is also not in the interest of any government, producer or consumer of oil, for the price of a barrel of oil to remain at this level as it would add to the massive unemployment that has been caused by the corona virus pandemic. C) It is not in the interest of banks for the price of oil to remain at these levels because it would result in oil companies not being able to refinance the $trillions that are coming due in the next 2 years thus causing enormous losses to the banks and financial institutions holding those debt instruments.There is a natural price for a barrel of oil where everything stated above comes into balance and does not create undue hardship to any of the players. In my opinion the price of a barrel of oil where short term and medium-term balance is reached is $35-$45 per barrel of oil."
"So tempted to sell here, but holding long. Waiting for positive earnings again and for the economy to get back on track."
***** 10 million shares in 90 minutes traded...... WE HAVE SOME PIN-ACTION*****deepsub
Warren B buys high and sells low. He did the same with the airlines. He is no genius. I say buy low and sell high
I sold all shares at 20.50 and I am sorry to change my position from long to short.Shorted 15K @ 20.57 . Hope it works and over enthusiasm does not kill me.Today is a wild ride day. Great day for longs.
I bought some OXY put options waiting for stock value to decrease below USD10 very quickly. Financials are really bad. Buffet did exit from this mess for good reason
***** NICE BEAT....... they lost less than 1/2 of what was estimated by many analysts....... WE GO BACK UP IN THE MORNING....... expect good guidance in the CC*****deepsub

Pullback is fine. Chart still looks good. It’s still gaping up to $32 and will breakout at some point. Patience!!!!!
OXY down by a much lower percentage than the DOW. NASDAQ OR SP at this moment.
One of the best option purchases I have made. Last year I lost 50K in oxy and decided to buy Call Options in oct 2020 to offset my loss with May 2021 expiration . My 300 Call options have made me offset the loss.
To clarify AFTER HE SELLS OXY WILL STILL CONSTUTURE ABOUT 10% OF HIS ENTIRE FUND
OIL STOCK BROKER FIXED OIL STOCKS ARE CRASHING OCCIDENTAL MARATHON BP SHELL ALL CRASHING!
"@Georges valuationOxy made an ill timed over valued acquisition in May 2019. The market punished it and its stock went from 70 to 40. So the market priced OXY post acquisition including the debt and what have you at 40. We know what valuation the market stamped on this deal. So it’s futile to try to assert otherwise. 3 variables changed since then, oil prices, divestitures and its ability to service the debt. Oil prices are on their way up. Whether this is sustainable or not is a different topic. So OXY is essentially a play on the recovery of oil prices. Think of it as a free option because Oxy has no debt maturing in 2020. So you have a free option. If oil prices rise Oxy will rise exponentially. If they stall...oxy will stay range bound. Finally by 2021 the debt advisors... Moellis should have pushed the debt maturing in 2021 and 2022 to later maturities... and things will be fine."
"So as of today we are $40-$50 per share under where’d we be had there been NO deal . Can’t blame long time holders for being disappointed, angry , disillusioned or anything else ."
"as uncomfortable as this pull back is going to be, it was inevitable..This stock has never been for the weak stomach and has always been a long term play. Pullback to 18 or so would net be surprising... we'll see 30 in May June, but it's gonna be bumpy. Try to enjoy the ride best you can..."
Just saw OXY published on the daily alert watchlist at (http://propick.uno)
the last time oil was in the mid 60 s..oxy pps was mid 40s with higher debt load !
holding long on Oxy stock needing steel hearts!!! you will be rewarded accordingly!!!!
Ready for $30
"YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT THIS STOCK IS MANIPULATED FROM THE TYPE OF POSTS IN THE MAIN PAGE. ONLY POSITIVE NEWS AND POSTS ARE ON THE FIRST PAGE. GLADIATOR WAS RECOMMENDING BUY ON THIS STOCK AT 82 USD, AFTER 5 YEARS WHEN I AM BACK HERE HE WAS RECOMMENDING A BUY AT 9 US DOLLARS OCCIDENTAL SHARE PRICE. ITS CLEAR THERE IS SMT DODGY GOING ON HERE."
"Bought some more OXY, XOM, CHX today near the lows, which with my luck of late might be tomorrow's highs. Oh well, time will tell whether the world can function indefinitely without oil. My opinion is that it can not."
"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373344-occidental-petroleum-ready-for-takeoffTraffic level in Europe and Asian near pre-COVID level. Even in London, rush hour traffic is nearly fully back. UK is encouraging people and companies to return back to offices to encourage economy. Some companies in Europe are paying employees cash to use their vehicle or use a cab to go to offices. USA, Canada, and South America rush hour traffic is still 50% down. From today's EIA report, fuel usage in USA is only down by 9.9%, i.e. it is 90.1% back. With fuel usage only 10% down, Distillates usage only 5.7% down, I am not too concerned about oil demand ""falling off the cliff"". It is a little strange to see airlines stock doing well (I own many of them) even traffic down 60%, and cruise stock doing relatively well with virtually no sailing in the last 6 months and likely for the rest of the year. It am almost replaying my airlines stocks story that from only 3 months ago, but now in oil stocks. Its not just OXY, but most of the oil explorers. It seems that oil stocks are way too sensitive to WTI being above or below $40 mark."
"I sure hope that OPEC, Russia and Mexico see the benefit to them of doing whatever it takes so that the price of a barrel of oil trades in the $40 to $45 range."
"According to the GuruFocus site the 18,933,054 shares were the ones Warren bought in Q3 & Q4 2019at an average cost of $42.85. Sold at and average of $15.66.That is not a good sign at all that he was willing to cut his losses!https://www.gurufocus.com/guru/warren+buffett/stock-picks"

Finally!!!
Yellen said that the interest rates might have to rise to stop overheating....Her words are cooling down the market.
"With the announcement of the dividend, I'm not sure how to spend all of it. Bag of nuts maybe?"
06/05/2020 at 5:02 am...something is up. I wonder what it is. It is not usual that OXY jump $1.08 to the upside in pre-market trading.
"Houston-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: OXY) has sold off about $4.55 billion of its assets in the wake of its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., and it has billions more in divestments lined up in the near term.Oxy closed the sale of Anadarko’s Mozambique assets to Paris-based Total SA (NYSE: TOT) for $3.9 billion, and it also divested its $650 million interest in Plains All American Pipeline LP (NYSE: PAA) during the third quarter. Oxy still has $4.9 billion in African assets to be sold to Total, and a joint venture with Colombia’s Ecopetrol SA (NYSE: EC) in Texas will draw in another $750 million in net proceeds, according to the company’s third-quarter earnings presentation."
Checks added to the stimulus. Great news. Please donate for Mehmet
I added 500 shares @25.50. Is it a good buy?
It’s interesting that volume was so high today compared to average volume and volume overThe past few weeks. I bet there is something going on ... positive sign for OXY
Western Midstream debt offload is a HUGE positive news event that has NOT be factored in to the stock price yet . They’ll be offloading a huge chunk of debt AND realizing some extra $$$ from the sale of the GP stake . This is hugely positive news folks .
If OXY stumbles too bad Buffett will just buy the whole company. No worries.
why the disconnect with WTI?
"hehehe sorry guys, I must repeat myself again: whatever you say I am very please with oxy performance today!!!"
"~~Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Leggate reiterated his buy rating, saying Occidental's stock represents ""perhaps the best opportunity amongst the U.S. oils,"" given yield, value and execution visibility. He raises his stock price target to $80, which is 76% above current levels, from $78 ~~ Buy!!"
"One reason the drop and move out of the oils : U.K. Health Minister Matt Hancock warned of a new coronavirus variant. Plus the big run up from the past week people were taking profits and since OXY had jumped the most here lately it should drop more . A jump from 10 to 20+ in a couple of weeks you would expect some would take the cash . Unless some massive lockdowns or big build in storage , I would look for a jump back this week to the 20s by Friday."
"There are two interesting interviews on utube with Vicki. The first was on Bloomberg when the stock price was $61.02 and down that day. She stated in the interview that when they analyzed the deal financially they considered oil prices from $40 to $50 a barrel. At that level, due to their superior engineering abilities and logistical advantages, they could still provide shareholder value. In the interview with a David Faber, she stated that shareholders would support the deal. Clearly she was misguided with respect to shareholder support. However, as a shareholder, I certainly hope the $40 to $50 oil price range used in the financial analysis was done properly. If so, things should work out well. Only time will tell, but it shouldn’t take too long. At oil prices at the current level they should be kicking butt."
UBS Analyst
Shades and of the last QTR before reporting when the oil market began its run higher!
I see $30 coming by the end of this week.
***** WHO... lit the fuse up the crack of this puppy??? all of a sudden and wants to run higher.....WTI IS SURGING AGAIN.....LOL.*****deepsub
"I am not selling and buying more, but Trader J has been right. Did not see this going below 53. Give him credit."
I guess other than OPEC theres concern about Iran increasing production
just checked again oxy was about 33 when oil was where it is now...and that was with about another 4-4.5 billion of opex and dividend
"It would be easy for Buffett to come in and buy a few shares ( say a few billion dollars worth) so he could have a vote on his 800,000,000 a year payment!"
***** We now have crude oil over $64/bbl..... as I posted before the market open this morning.......... sometimes it takes GOOD TIMING*****deepsub
Oil continues downward move dispite drawdown in inventories!!! Iran ?? Covid???
"....Occidental Petroleum, Feel The Long Power."
After today Oxy should be in official oversold territory with RSI hovering near 30. Good day tomorrow.
"In simple terms If you are OXY shares holder from July 6th 2020, for each of 100 shares you will get 8 shares of OXY at $22.00 guaranteed , EVEN IF MARKET PRICE OF OXY AT $30-----$40......or any value."
Whats causing the sell off in the oil stocks today after a nice rally yesterday....
"The the stock price is telling the board and Vicki, what the owners think!"
"So this might be funny or irrelevant but I’ll ask. I bought 2 OXY shares (first shares I’ve ever bought) at $8.95. I am pretty happy with the small profit I have, but I invested having in mind that it is way undervalued and I should hold. What are your thoughts?? Can OXY return on the $30-$40 pro COVID prices in the next 6mos to a year or will it move around the $20 price?"
"CNBC reports 500,000 increase in January by OPEC+ agreement , so far oil looking better than I thought it would no that increase"
OCCIDENTAL SHARE PRICE TARGET 9 US DOLLARS BY JUNE 2021. I WROTE THIS WHEN OCCIDENTAL WAS 31 US DOLLARS. BE SMART ONCE IN YOUR LIFE SELL NOW AND BUY BACK AT 9 US DOLLAR
"Now if a report came out saying Exxon made $2B for the first quarter, I'm guessing that OXY made a lot more. Just a guess. This should be up 10%. Once first quarter numbers come out and it shows energy companies making big money, Saudi continuing as is, or another cut, Oil prices consistent for the 2nd quarter, and then reopening and infrastructure bill passed, no reason it doesn't trade back to it's highs. Should be able to pay off all their debt obligations way early. Then then dividend gets increased.....WAY undervalued."
"honestly would have preferred to see an offering when it was above 30, would have probably had the same 20% draw down but at least we could have retired debt."
"Rinse and repeat 50% off the bottoms on weeklies again, god bless America"
***** Just can get any volume to speak of......MRO having just the opposite problem..... big volume and in the red.... crazy oil market today...... my two little guys are doing wonderful..... go figure..... glad to be back in PTEN after all these years..... this is my third entry on the third cyclical move over the last 12 years...... last 2 times I had a three and a four-bagger..... and sold way too early....LOL*****deepsub
"Positives:-More than 100,000 horizontal wells in unconventional plays account for 5 Million barrels of oil per day-Fast decline of unconventional horizontal wells (66% first year)-Not replacing unconventional production as current pace of drilling is 30% of needed-Very large number of smaller medium companies with no access to capital to continue drilling-Large number of companies will not survive with current cash flow (less competition)-Best geologic characteristics for future development in Permian / -Lowest breakeven price for OXY unconventional wells-Demand coming back the next year-The worst is over-Democratic government will restrict drilling in federal lands (5-10% all future wells)-The largest operator of successful CO2-EOR in the world (Green incentives will come)-Pressure to ban fossil fuels will drive prices upAgainst:-Debt, Debt, Debt-The worst CEO of the industry-Political pressure to push uncompetitive green energy-DUC (Drilled uncompleted wells)Conclusions-The positives are more and more relevant than the negatives. -It will take time, but if you are a long term investor, this will go back to $60 per share. The only company with so much CO2-EOR project than can use tit to make money on the CO2 sequestration part, and use the CO2 to sweep oil and make money selling oil. As of today, Oxy injects more than 1,000,000 Mscf/d of CO2. On the unconventional side, One of the few with the best leases that have billions of barrels to unlock in unconventional with the best metrics (room to grow when commodity prices improve). Overall environment will only push commodity prices up, and the big boys that survived the storm will make more money than anyone as there are less small/medium size groups with the strength and access to capital to drill.Buy, Buy, Buy, be patient."
"Currently, OXY's net asset value is at $72.6 billion. By next year when the oil price appreciates to $80 or more due to current situation of significant BK of oil producers + cuts, the net asset value can appreciate 30%-50%. At 30% appreciation, the net asset value will be at $94 billion. $20 asset sale of appreciate value will lead to net asset value back to $74 billion and their debt reduction of $16 billion. With Oxy's FCF, the debt reduction will be greater. The debt issue problem solved. OXY share price will fly to the moon. Long OXY. SQUEEZE shorts. Burn their bank accounts!"
"Starting to look like management wants to file BK , getting higher interest rate debt, put pay back to normal , cutting production , and spending what cash they have on hand . Just over 3 dollar to the 52 week low and at this rate it should be testing that low in about 3 weeks or less.It is up to OXY's management and they have already shown they do not care about the shareholders. Need to get production back up and try to handle cash on hand better , higher interest rate would be ok if production was going up .They had higher production at 30.00 oil."
Oil prices will skyrocket this year due to OPEC / Russian oil cuts and increased travel. OXY's earnings will be solid this year.
O XY could be bought out?https://seekingalpha.com/article/4343989-occidental-petroleum-acquirer-become-target
"What makes Oxy fun watching is the number of shares traded each day. I mean, 5M shares traded the 1st 30 minutes. Some companies don’t get that many trade in a year."
I’m not sure MBS is eager to help this administration with cheaper oil after the Kashoggi accusation. 10s bond spikes are a warning on frothy valuations. Equities trading at 2x Price to Sales. I’m sure Cathy Woods portfolio is +3x. $XOM $CVX $OXY $PBR ~1x. Bringing valuations at more reasonable levels is behind GS and JPM “rotation to commodities” thesis.
Hollub's legacy: She took a solid $70 stock with great dividends down to a bad $16 stock with no dividends.
So CVX offered $33B for Anadarko and lost it but they could buy it back plus get OXY for whatever the premium they cared to offer and I'm not sure shareholders wouldn't be interested given the lack of confidence in Hollub. I for one would trade my Oxy shares for the equivalent of $50-$60 in Chevron shares
Air lines going higher means Oil will go crazy high too......Patience..
"Surprisingly, I see only oil stocks are green in pre market from my watch list."
"I know that the US markets had tight rules and regulations to be abided bymost companies, and it appeared absurd that a 38 billion took over of another company and agreed to borrow money at extremely high interest rate (8% to WB) can be done without shareholders voted approval. Can someone explain this? The owner of a company is the shareholders, not the CEO and its board."
SM got knocked out with hedge.... I bet the oxy silence has to do with it. They are probably selling crude for $40. Let’s see...
"What? Duh, Come on man, No I haven't eaten. Duh"

Another day I want to call it a day and go to sleep
OXY mentioned that the avg sale in the quarter was about $43/b. WTI is currently in $60's and moving up. Additional pure profit at $20. Follow the FCF numbers.
"K, it is ok to convert it, not too late...everyone must start out at some point!!!!"
"You should sell this stock when the economy opens up and people have expectation of higher demand for oil and inflation. When that happens, oxy may pop 10 to 30% on on a single day which actually happened so many times in the past year. Rise is oil price does not necessarily dictate rise in oil stocks. It is an important factor but it is not a defining factor. Now, I for one believe that by the time we get to June the world will look significantly different than our current circumstance. In epidemiology we learn that the faster the infection goes up the faster it will go down due to naturally formed immunity. I really do think that this stock is at minimum 35 dollar stock. Oxy can pay off all of its debt by 2025 (excluding buffett's preferred shares if wti remains above 60. They should be able to pay 10 to 15% dividend at this free cash flow if some debts are taken care of with FCF."
"Russia's inaction and Saudi Arabia's decision to increase production is not only a war among themselves, it's a message to the USA to do our own reductions. For some time OPEC and non-OPEC countries have been cutting production, then the producers in the USA increase to fill the gap they created. There has to be reciprocal cuts or no one will cut."
25 or below is a blessing today....
"Mehmet's aliases:Rob, Suzanne, John and Mehmet. I am sure there are many others. The all CAPs is a sure giveaway. Also the phrases ""troll marketing agent"", ""buy put options"" etc"
Wonderful!
"My brain is telling me to sell early and buy later in the day, but my gut says hold through the open and watch it rise through the day."
use your heads...you want your dividend even though the stock is down by more than 100%...use your heads they are fighting a temporary war to prove that they have the staying power ...I would rather the world see that a battle is worthless and that they cannot cripple OXY ...as soon as oil rebounds the stock could go up over 100% within weeks and THEN they can resume the fair dividend
to reach 11$ this thing would need the market to crash again. Debts will be payed by warrants. plus drilling. decent asset sale.nov/dec. vaccine or humans develop a strong immune system we don't need it. we go on back to living life. should pushed this back pre-cov19 numbers
It appears that Oxy may now be the second largest natural gas producer after Xom...only data I can find it that Anadarko was #3 in 2017 ...nat gas is currently at average highs when looking at a five chart. Most people have not been paying attention to nat gas only oil..the reality is that a very healthy % of business in nat gas ..putting this is perspective with nat gas over 3 is like oil being about 70...and as stated it inflates the value greatly of their international gas assets..just have to sit an wait
$27 reached. Now we need more cow bell!
at some point this will be a buy but i hate to say now the paid 15 billion too much
What are the odds of missing earnings again? I’m cautiously optimistic.
Strong oil demand this spring and summer is going to absolutely shock the sysytem and crude oil prices are going to soar. Hard to believe that we are going to be discussing the OXY 2021 hedge and the impact on the upside profits. Who would have ever thought .....
"Gap up on Monday, will open 19:15 and rise up all next week, trapping shorties we need ur money   keep shorting "
I think we’ll see $50 stock price by Jan 15th and $25 by July 17th. Someone bought a bunch of call options for those dates.
lol it’s funny how mehmet comes back when the tide turns red. Funny isn’t it?
30m volume today?
"For all the gypsys that predicted a divvy cut, how was that Conf. Call?"
2021 break even down to $30 range.
"Can anyone explain how this company can stay solvent. Seriously, under what scenario does that happen in terms of the price of oil gaining traction over the next year."
sold 30% i have a feeling it will drop about 15% after tomorrow meeting
The volume today was low. OXY is poised for a big run. We need to be patient like we have been. The next run will be to the Pre-COVID level.
Oil over $46. Oxy still time to print cash. Let’s GO!!!! $25 by 2021.
Maybe carl ichan started selling this stock and that is why it is going down.
"Does anyone know what the poison pill measure they had added :(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp shareholders on Friday elected all 11 directors, approved the issue of new shares and warrants and a poison-pill measure, the first shareholder votes on last year’s $38-billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum."
Serious question: Will OXY survive?I'm thinking of buying in if it hits my price
With WTI over $65.00 a barrel OXY down over 5% makes no sense!!!!!
"Vicki didn't reply to most of the questions posed by the same bankers who had advised OXY to buy anardarko......None of the bankers asked WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO AROUND YOUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HAVE WARREN BUFFETT LEND 10 BILLION TO YOU AT 8%....???? Vicki just forgot to mention warren getting 800 million a year from Oxy earnings which last quarter ate up HALF of all oxy earnings....JUST A LITTLE SLIP I GUESS AFTER SHE QUICKLY TURNED EVERY QUESTION OVER TO OSCAR......NOW ADD TO OXY'F FINANCIAL CALENDAR THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF THE 14 BILLION IN BONDS DUE TO BE CALLED IN AS WELL AS WARREN'S FOREVER EARNINGS OF ALMOST ONE BILLION IN ADDITION TO THE DEBT INTEREST OXY MUST BEGIN PAYING OUT ON 46 BILLION .....Vicki hasn';t been able to reduce the debt much except thru accounting tricks WALL STREETS SEES THROUGH......DID ANYONE NOTICE EVERYTIME A QUESTION WHICH REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WAS ASKED ( REHEARSED AHEAD OF TIME YOU CAN BE SURE) VICKI TURNED IT OVER TO OSCAR......Neither mentioned the thousands of furloughed workers or those being let go directly......DOES ANYONE ON THIS SITE ACTUALLY THINK OXY WILL NOT BE FORCED TO REDUCE THE NEXT DIVIDEND WHICH AT OVER 9% WILL EAT UP MORE THAN EARNINGS AT SUCH LOW OIL PRICES??? OF COURSE, GAS WILL CONTINUE TO DROP AS CHINA'S LATEST BUDDY RUSSIA IS FINISHING OFF THE GIANT PIPELINE FROM EASTERN SIBERIA TO FEED CHINA'S FUTURE NEEDS.....GASZPROM will make out like a bandit at VICKI'S EXPENSE DOWN THE ROAD......MEANWHILE, OXY WILL CONTINUE TO BURN OFF GAS AND ADD TO THE VAST POLLUTION NOW ENGULFING THE PERMIAN.....NOBODY WANTS ALL THIS SURPLUS GAS.......VICKI SOMEHOW HARPED ON HOW INDUSTRIOUS OXY WILL BECOME IN TIME BUT AGAIN, DOES ANYONE TRULY BELIEVE ANYTHING SHE SAYS???? WITH THIS STOCK DOWN FROM 80 TO 33 IN JUST OVER A YEAR AT THE TIME MOSTCOMPANIES WENT UP 40%, WALL STREET KNOWS SHE HAS TO GO......IBM WENT UP 15% THE MOMENT GINA ROMETTI WAS FORCED TO RETIRE EARLY BY THE SAME BANKERS WHO TOLD OXY TO BUY ANADARKO.....VICKI JUST KEEPS ON TRYING TO CALM HER INVESTORS WITH HOW HARD SHE IS TRYING TO KEEPTHE DIVIDEND FROM COLLAPSING......ASK OSCAR TO DOUBLE CHECK IS WHAT SHE MEANT.....THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT CORPORATE DEBT, INTERST FOR WARREN, BONDS TO BE CALLED IN ON DUE DATES, LOW OIL PRICES AND GAS IN COMPLETE ROUT AND THEN HOW THE SAME PERSON WHO SCREWED HER SHAREHOLDERS ALL ALONG IS NOW TRYING TO COVER THE ROUT OCCURING WITH OIL AND OXY.......WHERE WAS HER JUDGEMENT WHEN INSIDERS TOLD HER THAT ANARDARKO WAS FULL OF ITS OWN ISSUES, HEAVILY IN DEBT AND THE SO CALLED SYNERGIES WHICH ARE HER SPECIALTY HAVEN'T DEVELOPED YET.......SHE KEEPS REFERRING TO THEM IN THE FUTURE TENSE......Anyone who buys now with the risk of a dividend reduction should remember the old adage, buyer beware...! OXY IS NOT CHEVRON ......"
"Anyone know why OXY is up way more than FANG and MRO? I own all three, so it's fine, but was curious. Usually they're all pretty similar price action..."
With Mexico now in oil is going to go up I'd say at least to 30-35 a barrel. You better believe at 20-25 the U.S. and other countries were STOCK PILING oil since it makes no sense to drill it at those prices. Oil goes up and there is a lot of money to be made on a number of fronts! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mexico-ends-oil-standoff-opec-162844803.html
"Insiders buying shares is a good sign. The CEO buying 37000 shares @ $48.15 is not a small amount. I like it, a lot"
The funds have spoken.
Congrats longs ! The pullback from $30 today is only due to the bottom falling out of the market . There’s plenty left on the upside here .
"Oxy shareholders – I own a buttload of Oxy common and would like very much for the share price to rise. I welcome all good news as it arrives. What is unwelcome is the unsubstantiated pumping/bashing that is not based on fact. Here is current facts as I understand them.-Q1 WTI averaged $46 Brent $51 and Oxy still lost money-The sale of Algerian assets to Total is Dead, Caput. -The Ghana asset sale is held up by a $500M capital gain tax-Future asset sales need to wait out the depress oil market-The Oxy bonds are Junk rated.-The Fed cannot purchase Oxy junk bonds as they went junk before 3-22. I have recent confirmation from Oxy on this.-Oil is still falling but should rise when supply/demand is in balance but if $46/$51 is not enough, what is?-The restructure of debt due 2021/2022 is an unknown to the common holder as of now.Now please, put down the kool-aid and bring some good news, it would be welcome. Just not idle speculation. GLTA"
"@Bob C - (Paraphrased from Bloomberg report) A three-part unsecured offering includes a five-year bond with a yield of 7.75% to 8%. A seven-year note may yield between 8.25% and 8.5%, while a 10-year security may yield 8.75% to 8.875%... That is a great deal,IMHO, because it is unsecured. It is highly unlikely someone would drop multiple Billions, UNSECURED, into any company at this stage, if they thought is was going BK. These facts and the current price that OXY is holding at $17.5, should be a boost to investor confidence going forward... The next hurdle is Q2 production and earnings, at which point I'll evaluate further, but for now Holding..."
Current Market Cap for OXY < 36B for both combined Companies.OXY paid 37B for APC. It doesn't sound right. Way undervalues..
"How about OIL stays flat for the week? Around $65. Looks like an inverted head and shoulders. Can we have $70 oil by April pls? $80 by July, and $100 by Jan of 2022? Is that too much to ask???"
"OXY looks like a company on the mend, with tremendous 2.5 x average trading volume today, and Friday. This is institutional sized accumulation going on. All those sloppy Joe's talking about bankruptcy forget that higher oil prices make amends for miss-steps. Institutional buying at $18 - $25 means that in the near term, the debt issue will be resolved favorably for the benefit of OXY and shareholders, while asset sales may resume. All that is good for shareholders. With institutions buying boatloads of OXY, let this honey pot run to $50 over the next 24 months. OXY is still a bargain - Giddyup."
"If oil,is going to 40,...oxy will,get 50 USD ....a bargain...should be at 30 usd not at 12 usd ....a big opportunity...best assets among all oil companies and low cost shale producer."
"Gas is up crazy in Arizona, it used to be $1.80 - 2 per gallon, and now it is up to $3.10. Too much. The gas price will keep rising to probably $4 here as long as the covid is gone, and the summer traveling time coming. I expect this stock will be about $45 - 50 within 6 months. I paid attention this stock since last year, when I started investing to it along with BP and XOM. I remembered Obama time, the gas was almost 5$ in Los Angels when I visited California. Buy smart when this is still low."
The key is that OPEC is working together. That is great news for OXY. Now fundamentals will kick in 
"No lockdowns should be tolerated in the US. Government exists only by the consent of the governed.

"The only thing that I am interest from OXY for the next 18 months is free CASHFLOW. Show me the money. Look like the whole third quarter WTI at $40, if OXY can generate $0.5B free cashflow then company can survive and even repair the balance sheet with WTI $40 slowly. If not then time to cut the loss and move on"
"Yus yesterday when premarket was up 2% for OXY said he was going to buy more shares, told to him to wait ....what did he do ?"
Get it men...
"This is like 3rd or 4th time the oil price hitting $66. It may now break out all the way to $70. The Covid case is now decreasing in the US significantly, and the India case is also going down. The energy from the universe now finally favours OXY and its fellow oil stocks. I am loaded with oil stocks since last year.... and the summer is here shortly. I am ready to RIDE~!"
Todays annoucement by Qatar sheds light on the fact that Oxy own 24.5% of one of the most prolific gas fields in the world ..Qatar north field....look up the dolphin project ...can you imagine the value of this asset
"Monday this stock hit a high of $28.13 and has been dumping ever since that great earnings report and enlightening conference call! FACT! So one has to ask the question, is this a great stock??? Or is it.....???"
"OXY is setting on the edge of a cliff , it needs to expand capx to increase production to pay debt but needs to cut capx to survive this down turn. Anything it tries to sell now will not bring in a lot . It was starting to move back up before this virus , SA/Russia oil war started and if it can make it thru this there could be light at the end of the tunnel . But this oil drop need to end or OXY will not survive in the company's shape it is in now ( be bought out cheap , BK , or as a much smaller company with little value ). I do not look for a government bailout of oil companies with all the other business be hurt worse by the shutdown ( travel , entertainment ). Cutting capx and dividends will help some still make a profit . And the oil companies have kind of helped make this happen with uncontrolled production . OPEC had cut for years so sooner or later they would stop and they did at the exact wrong time."

OXY to $30!!!BA SAVE LUV MGM all need oil/gas!!!!!!!!!
Does anyone know why OXY doesn't have any significant portion of downstream business?
I am going to post on yahoo forums THE NAMES OF STOCK BROKERS; if OIL BROKER SPONSORED INTERNET TROLLS DO NOT STOP MANIPULATION HERE
Volume was kind of meager today. That is not a bearish sign.
"I'll tell you one thing, I sure wouldn't want to be a short in this sector anymore.....2020 party is long over and this stock needs one or two upgrades again to smash through 25 before spring at this rate. Straight bull with the democrats sweeping now, Occidentals assets include Anadarko now as well, and well ill tell you this, WTI isn't going under 40 again. The rest is up to you before you wake up to a quick bull run right to fair value."
don't worry be happy said oil was dead

"***** she's easily going to clear the 50 million share traded today...... which, to me...... is VERY positive for the price advance going forward in the weeks ahead*****,deepsub"
"People trying to comment on Oxy, oil markets and companies with zero education is not only annoying but probably harmful to other people"
Oil is up again. Sure glad I’m not short.
Saudi and Russians want to keep cuts...
1300 shares ready to take off next week !!!!
"Hope that everyone has been loading up on the dips and averaging down if you can, as you never know OXY could head back up towards $15.00, maybe even higher, with or without any good news. GLTA & Hope that everyone has a wonderful weekend."
"I bought 2% more stock yesterday. With WTI @ $35, the company is very safe.OXY generates 1.3+ M bpoed and with a break even at $30. So at $5 per gallon profit for 1.3M oil, will amount to approximately 6.5 M$/day, so for an annual equivalent of 2.3 B$. OXY also has 5 B$ credit line with a bank, so approx 7.3 B$ available to retire all of 6.5 B$ bond retirement for 2021.In addition 50 %of WES and 10% of PAA will amount to more than 3 B$, sale of land to Wyoming will derive another 1 B$. This is enough to retire 2022.Buffett will gain a lot with more shares added to his cuddy every quarter, but regular investors with access only to common stock will reap larger gains.The oil rigs are going at such a faster pace and none of it will be profitable for anyone other than 3 big players at below 40$. So my estimate is that in an another month, we should see WTI crude oil hover just below 40$.I hope short sellers dont lose hope and buy covered calls from me. Thanks a lot for bringing down my share cost basis."
"chev already has the family inside track.... all they have to do is match oxy and they will walk away with it. imagine you are going to sell your car... to a stranger for 5,000 and a family member comes along and says I will match it... as long as you like that family member.. most likely you are going to sell to that family member.... and darko already likes chev... so there really is no need to top oxy.. which means that if they match oxy.. its over... and then oxy would have to pony up more.. but there is eventually a limit.... and already you saw darko take a lower bid from the get go... so I don't see much chance of chev having to come up higher or much higher than oxy... which now leads to where does oxy go from here... the street already has taken oxy down from the 80 range earlier.. but I don't see the rubber band bouncing back to full extension... but 70 is pretty doable.... once the dust settle and wall street starts to re evaluate the way some of the oils are valued.. ie what people are willing to pay for certain land holdings... oxy could see a climb higher... in the long run.. consider anything down here sub 62 a gift. and on the off chance that oxy does prevail.... watch the stock price come down and load the boat long term... this thing is a no brainer.. and you don't get these gifts very often. I picked up another 1000 at 60 5/8 which puts me at 4,000 shares.. my outright plan is to accumulate about 8-10k shares depending on the price points. in the next few weeks. if this hits sub 60 or some news events changes my strategy... that is my next buy point.. if you are in at 70 and have the means to pick up extra... it wouldn't be a bad idea to cost average at this level. (jmo) only if the world craters can I picture this hitting 30's... and even then.. I will still be buying with a smile.... oxy is run pretty well.. and regardless... the land alone is worth this hands down. stock in oxy = value investing. and who knows... down the road... when the hoopla settles... there may be a company that would take oxy to the prom"
"Came across this by someone with the nick ""True Texan"". It sounds interesting. Because Icahn publicly increased his stake, I think OXY's chance of bankruptcy is low unless we are heading to a deep recession where every country in the world shuts down for more than one year. Right now it seems like that because we are full with fear. I think dilution is very likely because OXY will need an investor to support it during this price war or it will get low interest loan from the bank with support from the government.Already happened > March OPEC+ negotiations break down. Both sides talk about flooding the market, long war ahead, investing to increase production capacity. In response, prices collapse and US shale players finally announce plans to slash CAPEX by 25-40%. Prices stabilize, as do E&P equities.- Occurring as we speak > Saudis loading tankers with oil from storage, sending an extra 2 million per day into already over-supplied markets. UAE joins their KSA ally in adding supply to the market. Saudis drop selling prices to key markets, to ensure Saudi barrels are bought at the margin compared to Russian ones. These are all highly visible, Shock & Awe type moves. Interestingly, crude oil prices and E&P equity prices remain relatively stable despite this expected onslaught of Middle Eastern crude.- What isn't happening at the moment > despite their bravado, no true investment in new productive capacity is being pursued by any of the players involved in the battle. In fact, Saudi Aramco just announced its plans to slash its budget for the rest of the year by 25% - consistent with other E&P players, but in conflict with what MBS and the Saudi Oil Minister were proclaiming about investing to get capacity up to 13 million barrels.- So, what will transpire near-term > COVID-19 takes 3-4 million barrels of demand out of the market. Additional and unwanted Saudi barrels will flow into visible supply hubs, like the US Gulf Coast, ballooning inventories and causing prices to slide still further, putting pressure on both Russia and USA shale players and diminishing both sides’ will to continue the price war as well as their financial wherewithal to invest in new production capacity.- But mid-term (say summer) > the effects of COVID-19 start to fall off in the US and Europe, as they've already done in the early epicenters like China and Korea. Global demand starts to return to normal levels, with possible rapid upswings as global citizens take to the roads and skies to celebrate survival! The Saudi's quietly reduce tanker loadings and compel the Russians and OPEC to return to the negotiating table, with all players clearly having seen the darkness at the bottom of the abyss and having a renewed spirit of cooperation and making a deal. Some sort of production cut is agreed. But the need for that cut is now far less, as USA shale production is peaking and heading south (quickly) as shale wells have high natural decline rates and the overall shale portfolio declines without high levels of sustaining capital investment, which have now been cut. Crude prices start heading back towards $50.- Come the fall, the USA shale output decline continues (and potentially accelerates). Analysts start to forecast a significant supply shortfall in 2021, with wounded shale players trying to balance the need to reinvest in their declining production base while hoarding cash to repair their balance sheets. Prices start to head towards $75-80 and OPEC+ starts to reduce its supply holdback into the market.- In the end, everyone benefits - MBS re-establishes Saudi power in managing OPEC+, and it is producing close to capacity at $80 pricing. Putin and his oil oligarchs benefit too, with prices now double what they essentially had been, supply constraints removed, and pesky USA shale players effectively out of the game to cause over-supply/low prices for years to come. Even USA shale players benefit - yes, their production base is down by 10-15%, but they too are benefiting from the higher prices in the market and the capital discipline that was imposed on them via the market, but essentially driven by MBS and Putin.Moreover, the Climate Change loud-mouths (like Bernie and Warren) are sidelined while those who survive the outbreak are glad to be alive and are focused more on a return to normalcy rather than some battle against unknown and unseen existential threats that the Progressive Socialists want us to imagine are lurking around the corner."
22 & 20 are the stops where we can add some more...
"It’s not just OXY, BP gave an excellent earnings report and it’s still selling $20 under where one would expect. They are even buying back 500 million worth of shares this quarter. I’d have never imagined these stocks could trade around last June’s highs while oil rallied 100%. Hopefully this is like a ship stuck in the mud and once the suction releases, natural buoyancy will rapidly bring it where it should be."
Will oil rebound ? IMO absolutely yes ! - though it may take a while . In the meantime weak balance sheet companies will have to survive the lower price - higher cost environment. Yes - that includes OXY ( thanks largely to its APC acquisition) . And by survive I mean continue in business with its existing capital structure . That means (you ) shareholders continue to own your shares of common equity . I don’t think OXY’s capital structure survival is a given though its in better shape now than it was 3 months ago . Anyone hoping to get rich owning these shares best have a very long term outlook and pray that OXY mgmt doesn’t screw anything else up .
-8m barrels
not bad - we are in GREEN today.
"Anyone expecting a price increase in OXY, can try call options as an instrument. They are cheaper and stops your downside risk. That is you cannot loose more than certain amoint even stock price drops to zero. Sell your stocks and buy call options if you are in love with bankrupt stock."

"Question (and apologies for the ""newbie"" view -- just got into this a few days ago). First off, want to say my heart goes out to those of you who have lost a LOT on this. Just brutal -- I'm sure many are hanging for dear life. Bought at $11.75 myself, and am wondering if those of you experts on here suggest I get out now, or if a bailout/deal from gov't (along with riding out the virus in the next few weeks) is worth hanging on for a while? Is there a risk of bankruptcy in days? Weeks? Months? Would someone come in and buy the whole company? Trying to weigh pros & cons of buying at this low price. Even if it goes up a few bucks, I'd still make some nice cash (again, my heart goes out to those of you who got in $40+ and are mad I'm even posting this).Thanks to all who care to answer. Just looking for advice from some of you who are more familiar with the company and this crazy market. I appreciate all of your knowledge more than you know! Love reading the thread."
"great overnight reversal which could be oil stock is finally finish more than four months down and bottom out. Huge institute buying. buy any good oil stocks now: CVX, XOM BP OXY"
Oxy conquering the Permian basin!
Oil’s going to be in just as short supply within six months.
If I’m so bold as to expect a possible brush with $30 this week
"Some may say I am pumping or hyping. I have no intention. But whether it is Oxy stock or even Amazon stock or something that seems very safe as SPY/QQQ ETF, based on my experience, one has to be slightly foolishly optimistic at the same time has to be able to look at things objectively looking at the numbers in order to make money in the stock market. If you are easily stressed out or become afraid, I don't think you will do well here. Oxy is not the best oil companies out there that I agree. No dividend. Lower production than last year. But I do believe that it has the best upside for oil companies out there because even if the oil price goes down. With proper divesture and reduction in debt with dividend reinstatement, should drive the stock price up within a year or too. Good luck to all and safe investment."
Second qtr numbers are going to be very bad. Low demand and super low crude prices. The first month of second qtr(April) is severe compared to the bad 3 weeks of the third month of the 1ST qtr. What ever the qtr report next week will be much better than the next qtr report...
This breaks resistance tomorrow

"I do not believe that Iranian would be able to produce additional 1.5 mbpd just like that. It will take time. Not only that according to the Iranian senior official, sanction would be opened up gradually as the nuclear disarmament takes place step by step. One action at a time for both sides. This is the way that everyone remains happy EXCEPT China. 1) Israel and Saudi will remain happy because Iran is placed on check by the U.S. 2) Saudi, Russia, and other OPEC countries would remain happy with decent oil price otherwise they might go nuts. 3) Iran remain happy because they get to sell each barrel at a price 50% more ($40 to $60) because they are now legal to sell the darn thing. 4) The U.S. will remain happy because they are in control of the whole thing. It is just my two cents."

it seems that oxy will have to pay dividend on common shares before they can retire preferred
time to buy !
W... Can you please look at the chart and let us know what it is doing? It's been a few minutes. Really need your insight.
I am leaving. I have left some auto orders to fill with my broker. If the price increases he will add up Short stock positions. I dont recommend anyone to stay holding OXY stocks for tomorrow. It will be RED NEGATIVE DAY tomorrow if it does not go to red today
"I have recently bought another 500 shares for it. So I have 600 shares for XOM, 1000 BP, and 1000 shares for OXY. I wish OXY will pay higher dividends."
I had to review the hedge. If oil gets to $45 oxy recieves minimum $55 per barrel. No downside hedge for 2021 and upside limited to $74.xx

"OXY was 16.50+ before the CC , now has fallen to below 15.00 . I am still waiting to hear what was good in the CC from all those that said it was good and they could live with it . To me it was a game plan for lower stock price , 200,000 lower production , not going to increase production , try to pay Buffett with cash ( which they already said they don't have last quarter ) , pulling back an asset sale . Explain what was good ,oil jumping didn't even help. I said months ago it was a 13.00-17.00 stock for the rest of the year with some jumps above and below . There has to be good news to move the stock and the CC had none."
Short runner always sell. I’m in for the big and will not sell until 65/70 a share long term gain. Wti up very good.
this stock will start breaking out once we hit the day resistance of 25.5
"Market crashing and OXY is 52 week high LOL, this is how the professionals sneak in and steal your candy. At any rate, I warned Repeatedly that they would push the price around to fool you, now they show their true hand and they want all the OXY they can get their hands on."
Beautiful cup and handle as someone previously pointed out. Strong beat on top and bottom line will lead to a nice breakout to new highs tomorrow.
"Rocco, Gladiator, Raje, Tom these are the members of Indian Call Center Stock Troll team. They are hired by OXY and brokers. Interestingly they are in partnership with Yahoo, which is a US company."
There is still possibility for big surprise as well. Apache had fantastic earning. And their portfolio is somewhat similar to Oxym Apache's domestic production is primarily in Texas and Permean Basin yet they broke both revenue and EPS estimate by analysts. Their revenue increased by more than 50% since Q4 2020.
$2 billion extra FCF AT $65 WTI. are you not taking it
"The price of a barrel of oil is the key. If WTI stabilizes at current levels ($45-$47 per barrel) it is reasonable to believe that most oil stocks, including OXY, will see a rise of 20%-25% on average in the price of their shares. With seeing light at the end of the tunnel on Covid-19 the world's economy is likely to come out of its slumber in 2021, but so will geopolitical tensions that have been also dormant. What will the result of that be? Is it totally unlikely that we see an unexpected jolt upward in the price of oil due to say Iran mining the Straits of Hormuz; a new attack on Saudi oil facilities; an escalation in the ongoing wars in the Ukraine etc.? Were any of these things to happen oil could easily trade at $95 per barrel. Where would that put the price of OXY shares? I think $50 for a share of OXY is not unreasonable under those conditions."
"Looked up at graphics.wsj.com, the cost to produce US shale oil is $23 a barrel breaking down as follows: CAPEX $8, Production Cost $5.5, Administrative/Transportation Cost $2.5 and Gross Tax $7. I think OXY can even produce cheaper due to oil locations and advanced drilling techniques."
"Buy some Puts guys and gals, this could turn messy if ER and call go south on top of the overall market selling that many assume will continue a few more days. Today’s was not “Tuesday turn around” as many were professing, it is actually a dead-cat bounce day.....tarde accordingly"
Support Cycle intact. Early innings. 2 months of quarter solidly over $60. Huge amount of free cash flow. BUY!!!!
With WTI at $65.55 this is either a fake out pullback or they really are expecting some kind of downside surprise tomorrow.I think that it's a fakeout.I'm holding my shares!$CDEV $MRO $OXY $LPI $SU
My grandpa lived through the 30s and played the stock market for many years… he always said BUY THE FEAR!!
They’re trying to cap it at 17 ... tear down that wall!
This is Mary working the corner
"I was in Vicki team, but after dividend slash, she needs to quite....If the firm can not survive 1 month of WTI30$, then go away....."
"Keep deleting my posts lol, Occidental Petroleum.....Feel the power"
Small investors can sell the stock and buy call options to protect upside risk associated short sell positions. The stock will start going down but you should protect your position with covered calls anyway. Ask your brokers how to open a covered short position.
Had to do it couldn’t resist long oxy at $13.31
1.14 million barrels per day....roughly 105 million barrels per quarter...realized oil price up about 20 per barrel...2.1 billion more in free cash flow than last quarter...even if you through in 200-300 million more in cap ex they will decimate street estimates
"So update me, if OXY's bid was rejected, why are they down? Maybe from a perception that Anadarko did not want to go with OXY due to something investor's have yet to find out?"
"Year and a half. Sold 83% today. Keeping warrants. Buying COP when it drops today, and other div payers. Tired of my div paying OXY debt."
Q1 2021 oil price is 15 dollars higher per barrel than Q4. Every dollar is about 215 million extra cash flowing in.
Dave we need your report on why OXY down more their it’s peers? lol
Oxy. Aug presentation slides and graph info.https://www.oxy.com/investors/Documents/Enercom%20Presentation_Aug%2012%202019_CB_Final.pdf
Did they fire Queen Antoinette HOLLUB yet!!! What's the holdup!!!
"According to Bloomberg, the Biden Administration is expected on Monday to impose some kind of economic sanctions on Saudi Arabia. They already stopped the sale of military equipment a few weeks ago. From these actions I think that it is not unreasonable to assume that whoever is talking into Biden's earpiece seems to want to see the price of a barrel of oil skyrocket."
I think Icahn sold all 30 million shares as of today STARTING from March 31st until now if I am not mistaken. Can anyone confirm this?
"pipeline gone, demand still high. small cap oil will double as oil approaches 70 a barrel.. big oil selling off divisions and assests to pay of debt. oxy got cash and debt reduction through 2025 another words they looking mighty fine."
Maybe Anadarko acquisition isn't a bad idea after all?
we need wallstreetbets here
"I bought back at $60.80 sold this last week at $66. I am getting a feeling I may have made a mistake.Holding stocks last year going into earnings were not a good idea, but lately there have been some big jumps when the earnings have met or beat in under priced stocks. If I can get back in around 62 before earnings will jump back in.Good luck longs."
"""Based on our conversations, we believe activists are buying, presumably to put Oxy in play itself,"" Mizuho energy analyst Paul Sankey wrote In a note earlier this week. ""An activist could force the company to break up or be sold.""One potential buyer of Occidental stock is billionaire Carl Icahn, who has long been active in the energy sector. Icahn's investment vehicles, including Icahn Enterprises (IEP), hold stakes in CVR Energy (CVI), a refiner, as well asDiamondback Energy (FANG) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX). Icahn couldn't be reached for comment. Occidental's market value is small enough now, at $44 billion, that Icahn could comfortably take a 5% stake in the company"
Cascading news from the Permian that output will shrink with an oil glut from the region . OXY may not be able to pump it fast enough to cover interest payments much less anything else .
Bought the dip at 29. See you guys next week
"Damn, if we do get back to $30, look out. Extremely bullish pattern forming. If we hit $30; next stop should be $42. Next 5 months will be very interesting."
You know that you have some low life ferrits on the board..not just the regular...when someone thumbs down a post about the world recovering
"We love shorts. Please keep shorting Oxy so we can make more money when you capitulate. Thanks Mary, Mehmet, etc. Hope you don’t need to foreclose your homes."
"With the entire investment public seeing that replacing the CEO would be the quickest and most simple way to increase OXY's share price it is somewhat of a mystery that Buffett and Icahn, two very smart men, have not moved to make this happen. Could it be that they are afraid of firing a woman because of the blowback from me ""diversity crowd""? I think that if Holub was a man she would have been fired long ago."
OXY management needs to put out a statement on the APC rumors. Silence is not golden and not shareholder friendly.
"Platt analytics tracks 100 players in the US and while rig counts are up from lows in a big way they are still way down from jan 2020..., most importantly their data show that almost all 100 players have no intention of resuming heavy capex and they all appear committed to capital contraint for the year ahead..their budgets are already done ..."
"Oxy s my biggest investment ,added lately and that’s it. It went lower  the dividend s comforting that’s it."
"The unusually low volume indicates that the fund / institutional managers are on holidays. Once 2021 begins, as Matt mentions below, OXY and all oil companies will start their journey to show the world the oil is the KING of commodities."
"as the oil price reach to $65, what is the future of OXY? eh? I see a lot of new people here, the best thing is that a silly one named ? yells to short OXY everyday is gone."
"The trend is weak for oil until the lockdowns are lifted. I thought Santa Stimulus would save us... But once again, I have to mention that it is 200-400% return or 10-30% unrealize loss. The choice is yours."
Alan/Mike I have some investment advice for you. Something tells me your use to being a loser.
Funds are buying on all the dips. As they can’t buy in large blocks or it will push up the price too fast and too high
"I am terribly sorry to say so... but I told you so.I got in in OXY in March 2020 at an average price of 10$ and quit when it reached early 20$. Sorry... but it will go down to 10-15 again. At that price I will be back in, this time with the double of my initial investment. So just relax and stay put, or sell if you can't bear the red numbers and get back in later to compensate your loss."
I'm just a small investor. I like to hold about a $10k position in each stock. I might start buying OXY at $2k a month for the next 5 months. But I'm holding half my money in cash. I have a feeling this bull market is over.
"Had stated I was waiting for 48-49 to buy more but with oil dumping will probably wait a little longer , was not expecting oil to drop much lower till next middle to end of next year . May take a chance a few days after XD day and see what happens . In at 54 and 57 need to average down so more ."
"A fine line divides disruptors and destroyers. CI has been on both sides, obviously trying to balance his own mistakes. Not all of his attempts at gaining control of the boards of different companies have yielded positive results, and many attempts failed miserably, ex : Motorola. It appears on all counts, he's progressed his own pockets without regard to real value enhancing shareholder value. He is no icon of business proficiency. He is certainly the most hated interrupter by the BODs he's tangoed with. He's worth a pinch of salt."
"dear cris,that is true. $ 22 is Oxidental warrant strike price.Holders of Occidental common stock will receive 1/8th of a warrant for each share of common stock held as of the record date, and each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of Occidental common stock for a purchase price of $22 per share. The distribution of the warrants will be made on August 3, 2020 to stockholders of record as of July 6, 2020. The warrants will have a term of seven years and Occidental expects to list the warrants on The New York Stock Exchange."
"Don’t panic sell. OXY is a cash king. Even with output down, oil prices are amazing this quarter. Reduced overhead + higher oil prices = "
RED
A real short squeeze would be nice to see today.
We will see $31.50 on Tuesday.
"I'd like to buy but the huge debt worries me. On the other hand the dividend is awesome. If they can deliver on knocking down the debt, I'll be a buyer. Also, oils got to be close to bottoming too. The last concern is virus effect on global markets and the possibility of a global recession. GLTA"
MM’s are loading up and probably won’t allow this to go green until the opening bell tomorrow.
"There ya go...Blackstone, Apollo may bid for Western Midstream stake - BloombergSep. 19, 2019 12:56 PM ET|About: Western Midstream Partners, LP (WES)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor The majority stake in Western Midstream Partners (WES) being sold by Occidental Petroleum (OXY +3.2%) has attracted interest from Blackstone (BX +0.5%) and Apollo Global Management (APO +0.7%), among other P-E firms, Bloomberg reports.OXY acquired a majority stake WES via its purchase of Anadarko Petroleum, which had formed the company to house its pipeline operations.OXY is seeking to sell $10B-$15B in assets over the next two years to pay down debt; the company this week announced public offerings of its stakes in Plains All American Pipeline and Plains GP Holdings for $652M in gross proceeds."
"Okay, so I was one day early from catching the bottom!"
"FWIW - all oil stocks are on a run as oil has moved up strongly - and for OXY in particular - oil has passed the magic $50 price point . Make no mistake ....OXY needs sustained higher oil prices though not a two week pop . I’m bullish on oils for now and that includes OXY . I do not believe the ER will be great , however all ER’s after this next one should show marked improvements if oil prices hold . OXY is in much better shape with oil pricing higher ."
Please a round of applause to Saudi energy minister. He did send a clear message to oil speculators. No more playing games with oil. He wants oil at $65 in summer. Means OXY double from here
"Oil is up, markets up big so why is my OXY the worst performing oil stock? Somebody knows something."
"SP at less than 50% of January last year, debt reduced. and/or pushed out into future, massive cost and capex reductions, sexy innovations for future, oil price trend and inventories very much in our favour.

"One advice to shorts, don't EVER fight the market momentum. Literally impressive, but more good things to come."
What happened all oilstocks took a nocedive?
Vicki and team needs to be gone!!!!!!
"Until OXY has a major asset sell (5 B+ ) or show that it can pay the bills , make a profit and restart CAPX ( for the future ) the stock will not move much above 20 if even that . It will not be next quarter and maybe not until next year and that is when their lower hedge goes away . Oil price will not carry OXY by itself , OXY has to do something to help move the stock and the CC was not any help. They can talk all they want but until it shows on a quarterly report it is all talk . Oil can be 100 next year or it could go negative again and you can not guess what the oil price will be next month or a year from now . Who saw 100 oil a few years ago or negative oil this year ? OXY saw oil staying around 60 for the APC deal and how long did oil stay at 60 after the deal . In the long run OXY may make us rich or just a little poorer but it will not be this year without help."
"I highly recommend buying oxy if it dips due to earning AFTER taking a look at the conference call. Check the hedge and their production level. If these two points are fine then they will have extraordinary 2nd quarter and move the price significantly over the next two months. 17.5% easy with stocks and 25% with warrants in a month. Covie cases are downward trend in Europe, South America, Middle East, and North America. There are spikes in few countries in Southeast Asia but they should also turn down in a month as well. I think their cases are flattening including Nepal and India."
after muting the short nonsense this board is pretty quiet. Why no discussion on the obtaining $173 million yesterday on monetizing WES limited ownership
"Chart is really look good now. We have not been above the 200 day moving average in 2 years. It's now at $16. If and when we take that number out, it's clear sailing ahead."
"Chart is showing the 50dma at $19.19. Im guessing it will be around $18.75 by Friday and OXY will bounce against it. Interesting also that the intraday high April 9 was $18.27. Do we get a convergence? Im guessing we have resistance this week or next at the 50dma. My earlier prediction of $20 by May 10 might be a bit inflated. But I think it still is pretty close. IMO, we have profit taking at the 50dma then a run past $20."
"Going by the weekly chart I believe that if CPE is really making a serious breakout here, a double is easily possible within the next 7 weeks and a triple is far from being out of the question. If it happens for CPE huge moves are likely for $LPI, $CDEV and $SU and big moves for $MRO and $OXY should happen as well.Remember folks, CPE's all time high is $288/sh."
Prediction: OXY $40+ this date 2021 and Mehmet will be long gone from the boards
Each plant can remove a million metric tons of carbon which oxy will then use to move up oil in the Permian more efficiently ..leaving the carbon in the ground
Moderna vaccine approved. Let us try it on Mehmet
Gasoline up by 5.6 million barrels.
The closer we get to May the higher we will go.
67% of all nat gas comes from fracking ...40% of all electricity comes from nat gas coal is still at 20% prioritizing would dictate coal plants migrated to nat gas ..even mush wants to drill fo nat gas...right now any disruption in nat gas would disrupt the ev evolution ..musk warns carbon capture too...Buffett invested over 10 billion in buying a nat gas line this year ...so oil must continue to enable gas flows for electric and carbon capture will be subsidized by the government. The bigger players will thrive flaring control carbon and direct air capture..and slow integration of alternative energy over the next 10-20 years for incremental power and back up
"Opec + wants oil between 55 to 75 this year, say goodbye to the 30s & 40s oil that’s in the past. OXY will soon start its ascend to 50 back to pre crisis level and beyond."
I wish I would have dumped this on Monday @ $28.00/share. What a mistake holding this for that great earnings report and enlightening conference call? The stock has performed so well???LOL Such a great company??? The market thinks so????
"***** in talks to sell off the Ghana assets is a good start-------for half a billion, but what other non-core assets will be next in line to sell this year??? *****deepsub"
"Now is the time for shorts to cover, this puppy is going above 15 any time now and heading towards 20, I believe today Oxy is closing well above 15, the volume is quite impressive"
"rest assured Queen Vick is working on carbon capture ideas, she's going to save the planet!!"
Bought oxy last friday and yesterday targeting 20.75 which is already reached premarket. Should i hold or sell
"I have to laugh at posts from Mehmet Sakir and his new alias Alan it a joke he keeps raising his cap price, now it’s $31! What wallstreet investor is funding this creep. As the economy recovers and people get back to work oil prices will rise. This span artist Alan must not drive a car and look at fuel price direction. I am holding for $50 a share price!"
We did it..
OCCIDENTAL STOCK PRICE CAP FOR THIS QUARTER IS AT 31.5 USD. SO THE UPSIDE IS LIMITED BUT DOWNSIDE OF DEBT BROKEN OCCIDENTAL OIL IS ENOURMOUS.
"At todays closing price, Vicki's OXY shares (419569) had a value of $13,845,000.00. Now, isn't that a CEO that's in this with us? She has purchased shares before and after ""THE"" deal, she is in."
"I'm glad I sold out. While I am bullish on OXY as a company. I bought in sub $10 and the roi was just too slow for me during a bull market. I have considered adding this towards my dividend portfolio because this is probably one of the few oil companies that:1. Has successfully been able to switch management, doesn't matter if the previous CEO expanded the company.2. Been able to make hard deals in order to transition through covid.3. Will probably be one of the few oil companies as we transition from oil. This could go 2 ways. I'll either be buying if oil goes back down as tech rises. Or I will be buying in at above $25 in a couple months. I'm gambling that Q3 oil will drop back down. But I am a firm believer that OXY will do fine. They had good dividends but removed them due to financial constraints, understandable. This was initially an economic play but jobs don't seem to be coming back. I still think this company will do fine. I sound bearish but I'm conservative with OXY because I'm heavily considering buying back in later. I sold out of slow stocks to chase the tech. Sector rotations will lead me ack to oxy later. Good luck. I think turtle beach or whatever that trolls name was is terrible. Been wrong since $9"
Even your grandmother knows OXY is undervalued. Just hold onto it until it explodes. GODAMMMMN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
OXY today reminds me of the bidding war for homes that is going on around the country. Too many buyers.
"I was too too overweight OXY and trimmed around 2/3 of my position. It may go up further, but it ran up from 37 it seems like a couple of weeks. If it falls back to below 40 to test that level, I may add. Got the huge divvys yesterday which was nice."
35 by may
"Compared to PXD/EOG or even CXO and FANG, OXY has quite many negatives. However the most important thing is it can stay afloat long enough until demand recovers and production shrinks significantly, and the low share price now justifies a good long term investment."
OXY new down trend started target share price USD 5. June 2020 market manipulation current market manipulation is similiar. OXY will go below 5 USD share price this time
congrats to anyone able to add more while under $25.60ish.
"Hi friends. I want to OXY today 27k shares.I just read the views of some of you about company in trouble .is this a good buy today..,?Thanks for sharing valuable information."
Mike/Alan/Emily/Mehet make sure you have a weekend fullOf anxiety as you will suffer the most the next 3 weeks as oil stocks surge!
do the math...made nice $$ selling @ 55per barrel...gonna obviously earn over$1mill per day based on today's price and today's over 1 mil barrels being sold
I updated OXY to 34 from 26 .
Bullish sentiment is building up in the Oil market
Dang what a strong close ! This is going much higher short term - I’m thinking $42.50-$43.00 by Friday . Cheers !
Wolfe Research downgrades OXY tl undrperform PT 20. from 30. Who is this guy????
***** NASDAQ is lower for three weeks in a row....... it appears that the rotation from tech to energy stocks is finally underway...... and.... enforce today!! Some of us have been waiting for this for over a year........Has the worm finally turned??? (vbg)deepsub
TOMORROW SHARE PRICE WILL DROP TO 24 US DOLLAR
we have about 150 million shares bought at greater than $25 cost basis
Hard to believe OXY was trading at $68/share just two months ago. A stunning reversal of fortune.
Will Buffett lose billions on his preferred if Oxy defaults on its bonds?
Why oxy going down? Is it because it went up on Monday and people taking profit or anything wrong with earning report? I didn’t see anything unexpected from earning report. Actually i liked it as they pushed the maturities away from 2021 (they have enough accessibility to pay down 2022 maturities).
4.3 million shares bought at cost basis over $26
"I see no reason for warrants to surge without the common surging first, unless something of interest is brewing."
"EIA report and fed. come on, EIA give us a lower inventory build and the fed dovish posture please"
Diamond hands kiddos. We’re going to see the 30s
Everybody I talk to is filling up their tanks! Lol
bought more at close. Maybe too soon but holding the line long term.
"I remember in 2016 FCX was 3.80 and Carl Icahn invested. I watched it from the sidelines go to $19. This will be another one of those I think. Probably won't happen overnight, but I'm willing to wait 6-12 months to 3-4x my money."
"Personally, I think that the near term catalysts to OXY price per share are: the decision OPEC, and Russia will make on whether to continue to reduce oil supplies; and whether OXY can successfully reduce labor costs, sell unwanted assets, and refinance its debt. It is not likely that all 4 issues facing OXY will be resolved to OXY's benefit near term but it is likely that at least one will. I think that OXY's negatives are fully reflected in its current price per share and therefore I see little downside risk, a period of consolidation for the next three months, and a bright future for long term investors. Once the issues facing OXY are resolved in a year or two, the dividend will grow as will OXY's share price. Just my opinion.."
"last chance to load up under 26.30, this will revert to support and break the next resistance"
"If you track any flu like they track corona virus, you will get the same result/stat/death count. The current mortality rate on corona is low and it will be even lower if everyone on earth is tested. This media is once again proving itself how they can well manage the entire population with the fear."
"There might be one more sizable plunge with OXY before the take off. OIL chart has a wicked Head and Shoulders formed. Maybe maybe not. But the pain should be near over. Even if it plunges, it should be very soon and then continue its rise. Summer season is just a few weeks away. Its building."
"I think OXY held up very well today. Slight decline, not nearly as bad as WTI oil price decline.This is great. Shows resistance, will bounce back. POTUS suggest restarting economy before the end of April. Virus news not nearly as bad as projected.Oil will be back, some will lose their cool and money, but smart investors will hold on."
Slowly but surely heading to 40
"he U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtained an asset freeze tied to shares in Anadarko Petroleum Corp. after one or more unknown investors allegedly made illegal trades ahead of Chevron Corp.’s takeover bid earlier this month.The mystery traders bought Anadarko options from Feb. 8 to April 1, before the company’s shares jumped 32 percent on news of Chevron’s offer, according to a Monday order from Judge Gregory H. Woods. Two days after Chevron sent a letter to Anadarko in February about a takeover, the mystery traders started buying out-of-the-money call options eventually making $2.5 million from the illicit trading, the SEC said.The traders placed their bets through brokerages in Cyprus and the U.K. The SEC is seeking to identify the traders and impose monetary penalties.After Chevron disclosed its offer on April 12, Occidental Petroleum Corp. came out with its own bid for the Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko last week. Anadarko, which isn’t a defendant in the SEC case, plans to hold talks with Occidental after the target company’s board of directors determined the bid could result in a superior proposal."
"From the chart this looks like feb 26th to March 5th all over again. If you guys look at the chart feb 26th 26.26, kept climbing to 31+ by mar 5th. About 1 week of buying momentum. We are about 1 day in, so if we’re about to repeat that run, we should see 29-30 by Friday, if news from the fed and api are entirely to positive"
I’m seeing a reported $7.5 Billion Revenue for the QTR
"The stock price was attacked from the short last couple days, spreading inaccurate news about the dividend cut. During the conference and on the conference charts, it clearly says the dividend only be affected when oil is 40 or below. With Saudi RAMCO going IPO and Trump wants a deal with China for reelection, oil is not going to 40 any time soon or into 2020. Debt is THE big concern here so they have to cut costs with the production level remain as to generate more cash flow. Selling assets that are not a part of their future plan is also a MUST and they said they will do that. So far they said they are ahead of their plan target for this year so hopefully they can for future plan. I bought in Monday and feel more confidence now because I haven't heard from ICAHN on the report earnings. He probably is OK with it, knowing the guy, or he would be out there speaking loudly against the CEO, BOD, and the acquisition. I will give them a year to see if they follow through. If they do, my purchase would have very good return. If they don't, then I will get out."
WTI only way is up--look who's stuck sideways in Suez with no KY grease.
Gladiator back after selling? 
A stock to buy if you want to make a ton of money in the future
Unexplained industry wide sell off
Does anyone have a logical explanation why the oil sector is XOP is down over 2% OXY down 2.74% when oil is up today over $63.00 barrel?
API Numbers very bullish. We already knew that crude was going to build due to higher production by wells and less refining due to shutdowns from Texas Freeze. Look at those product draws! WOWOWOWOW! The most bullish Production Draws IN HISTORY! Mark this day! $OXY #Crude: +735.6M VS Est.-1.850M#Cushing +0.732M#Gasoline -9.933M VS Est.-2.125M#Distillate -9.053M VS Est.-2.900M
Anybody still don’t think oxy could reach $50 by earning? Better think again
***** LOL. ...... back up to $27/share again............ ALREADY..... wait till they report in a few days........WE GONNA BE FINE as WINE in the SUMMERTIME***** deepsub
My account just went up by 15k today. Happy to see the reward for enduring such a pain. Hope we all keep going up!!!
here we go... we are in RED again...

Y'all have a Great 3 Day weekend...It's gonna be a Wiinter Storm here in the D/FW stay healthy and safe..
Let's do our job and outnumber the bashers so they don't take control the narrative on this message board. Bullish reasons:1) Demand recovery2) Higher crude price3) FCF monster aka cash machine4) Carbon-Management Technology
For you daytraders.aka novi house flippers...why would you come to a stocks that is at HISTORIC LOWS and think think that its a smart play to short because it barely moved...There are hundreds of stocks that are bloated with massive pes or none at all..move on ..think about buy puts on a stock that IS LITERALLY SITTING ON A POT OF GOLD..THEY ARE THE LARGEST HOLDERS IN THE PERMIAN ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC FIELDS IN THE WORLD
I love the smell of profits in the morning
OXY is holding up very well in light of a significant oil price sell off .
https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2019/12/30/occidentals-woodlands-energy-corridor-campuses.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahooThis is a positive .
"Best best thing ever would happen to OXY is to eliminate everyone. Eliminate the Board and CEO. I have been an orginal stockholder in this Great Company for many years and still am. OXY use to be supportive towards OXY investors."" That's What Makes A Great Company."" Investors should come first not CEO and the Board."
"Bloomberg article ..Russia stating that they will tap their 150 billion dollar wealth fund to subsidize oil at 20-30????? They are pumping about 4 billion barrels per year just like the Saudis..so if oil is 25$ less they will lose 80-90 BILLION IN ONE YEAR..operationally and that does not include hundreds of billions lost on stock valuation ..every player the US, Russia , and the Saudis are in the same boat..they need to work it out..pumping an extra 800 million barrels in a year below cost will not do anything at all"
"In Hollub’s comments to Barron’s, she uses nothing but talking points and generalizations to support the acquisition. How about specifics and numbers. Where can I find a well thought out financial analysis supporting the purchase of Anadarko at the price paid, with the anticipated debt structure and dividends to be comfortably covered by projected cash flow."
"Good news from Goldman Sachs ""The Wall Street bank raised its 2021 forecast for global benchmark Brent crude prices to $55.63 per barrel from $52.50 earlier. The bank hiked its estimate for U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude to $51.38 a barrel from $48.50 previously"", this is really bullish for Oil Stocks"
The fact that Icahn is still buying more is extremely bullish. With his 2 Board seats he knows exactly where things are at with the major assets sales and preliminary Q3 numbers.
"Only patience will premium shareholders on this stock, in the meantime enjoy the dividends, the beautiful deleverage will make the stock fly higher 60$ will be a new floor."
Lots of option activity at 21 do dec. hold on to it
"Oxy was a $100 a share stock 5.5 years a go, and an $85 stock 18 months ago. Hard to believe that I am sitting in my chair cheering on this stock to move up past $40 a share."
last time we had 66 WTI this was at $28. go figure.
whatever you say...I am please with oxy performance today!
"Market worries about demand for oil because of vaccine delays in Europe, India, Africa, Brazil, etc. is also putting pressure on oil stocks. Icahn's share sales is adding to the pressure on OXY."
WTI just crossed the $60 mark! Enjoy tomorrow’s holiday. Wishing you and OXY a great week ahead!
The trend over the last 3 weeks is a share price of $27.64. It needs to close above this bench mark and move higher before we see new highs in the 30s. I think we will see that near the report date in May.
"Did we see the bottom today? I believe yes, who agree with me"
"Falls on low volume, rises on high volume. Damn trading desks I know who you guys are"
It’s the end of the month and quarter. You will see traders adding window dressing to portfolio numbers. Oxy is not moving out of sync with other oil stocks. The entire energy sector is selling today. It’s called taking profits.
"damn it, I thought I was add more shares today at 24..."
"I posted on Friday morning; “Just pros pushing down price to hit stops and buy cheaper. “As I’ve repeatedly warned, the markets are run by the mob guys who were too corrupt to work in Vegas and on the docks.they know where the majority of the stops are and will hit them and take your candy."
API shows a gain of 3.8 million have to see if EIA matches that number . May not make a difference until OPEC+ meeting results are in. Been a big run the last week and now have people talking 60-80 for OXY's stock and it hasn't made it to 20 yet !! Come on people be a little realist demand is not going to jump over nite. Vaccine will not have a big effect until late 2021 or 2022 and OPEC+ is just waiting to increase production . Ride the run up but OXY has shown it can fall just as fast as it can go up so watch out if it turns. Hope the run will take it to the 20s by years end and not back down lower!
move toward 12
I sold my short term position in OXY this morning to offset some of the short term gains that I have in trading other positions. My original intention was to buy and hold OXY for the long term. I still believe in the long term prospects of this stock and will be praying that this stock does not recover before Dec 8 when I can buy back my position. I apologize beforehand to all the longs for my being so selfish.
"""Rob Peterson -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial OfficerThanks, Raphael. So just historically, the company is not one that's regularly engaged in hedging, preferring to realize the prices over the cycle, that delivers the most buyer shareholders. But we did, to your point, with our increased leverage, take on an oil hedge in 2020 that had a collar in 2020, but then it also had a call provision in 2021. So the only thing remaining from that oil hedge is the call provision in 2021.We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20, natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12.31 with a value between 2.50 and 3.64 on a costless basis, similar to a cost of basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on that oil -- on the gas side. We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus not doing so.As you can imagine, we do a pure put. It's still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type color hedge is going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today last year's hedge, extending one into 2022. And so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge against downturns in the business in the near term.We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And so we have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to kind of continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive in the future."""
"Mehmet, thank you my friend"
next week opec would maintain the production cap??? Just wondering if I should take a position before some news event...
Just IMO - anyone trading here should be looking for an intermediate high early to mid week this coming week IF the Senate manages to pass a stimulus this weekend Monday & Tuesday should be strong and a good time to take profits . This doesn’t apply to those of you holding for longer term .
"We usually get a question concerning whether our illustrious former CEO is still employed here after the APC purchase debacle. Sometimes someone posts she could not have predicted a pandemic that ruined the oil markets. Perhaps. But when someone in charge decides to go all in and does so without any regard to the stockholders and without any apparent downside risks analysis by throwing caution to the wind and floats a $10B preferred offering with an 8% coupon to guarantee as she said ""oxy having its rightful deal for APC, one should not have to ask that question. The correct question should be does anyone know where she is working since leaving OXY? So, how is it she is still there?? Meanwhile Icon is buying warrants like mad. Reminds me of when he tried to wrestle away marathon from USX and got his head handed to him. Maybe they should run away together?? Morgan lowers their target to 13 today from 19. How many are underwater at 19 today? Thirteen would be drowned."
"with oil less used for energy, the price of chemicals and plastics will no doubt have to go up."
black gold will be the king asset in the market. it has the best utility and real value. cash has been trashed by the government.
"Don't care how you try to spin it , 60.00 oil ,5 billions in assets sale OXY is in trouble . I am not saying they will file BK but put yourself in management's position : around 40 billion in debt , company's worth around 20 billion ( WSJ had debt / worth at just over 2X ) and just wrote off 6 billion . If they want to file BK what would you do 1) Spend all of your cash ( Buffett's dividend , interest coming due next year and try to buy cheap debt ) 2) get as much higher interest rate debt you can get , 3) lower income ( production going down by 200,000 per day ) 4) stop all asset sells ( as all become core assets ) . Then file BK , go to debt holders with asset sale plan to get them some cash and then give them a % of the new company to make them happy > Then go to the Judge with the debt holders with the plan and have it approved issue new shares and start with almost 0 debt . The only people hit are the gambling shareholders which they have already shown they do not care about . Another company just did this a few months ago ,"
It may be gettin the scent. Go git em boy!
"Ichans announcement will have an affect on this stock short term only hopefully, you can’t sit back and think him selling almost $3Billion in shares in a stock with a market cap of $28Billion will have no affect, it will induce some selling by others too i feel. That being said im long OXY with oil prices where they are and will stay long until 3QTR and will only sell then if the management continues to ignore the debt"
"OXY will not get a loan without certain conditions. Let's go back to August 2001 when Williams Cos. took over Barrett Resources for a take over price of $2.8 billion. Fast forward to August 2002 and Williams Cos. creditors would not renew the loans because Williams was over leveraged and had a bad quarter. So BK was on the horizon because Williams was cut off from credit renewal. In comes Warren with a $3.8 billion bailout package. But in order to get the package, the loan had to be secured by virtually all of the Barrett holdings. So if OXY gets Darko, what will be used to secure the loan? What is to prevent the loan holders from refusing to roll over the loans and then feasting on the carcass of a combined failed OXY and Darko? Remember this, when you owe a lot of money, you are no longer in charge, your fate rests with your creditors."
Everybody gets free stuff from Vicki Hollub except the shareholders.WEB gets 8% and free stock.Total SA walked away with about 10 billion when Vicki gave the Mozambique LNG plant away.Chevron got a billion bucks on their joke bid.Shareholders will end up with no dividend and a 30$ stock.
so let me git this straight........OXY acquired Anadarko for $38 billion .......and now the combined entity has a market cap of $23 billion........and that's after a near tripling from last years low........and warren buffet still collecting his 8%.......is maxine waters running this company
"Just remember, it’s the year of the OX(Y)   "
Can we have some pipeline good news
Increasing my long position at this price. Will continue to buy if it continues to go down next week. I have patience and a 2-4 year holding horizon.
"If breakeven is about $40 and oil goes into the twenties, why wouldn't big oil just turn off the spigots and buy futures??"
"As long as I am makine 6% on my money I can wait a while for it to bounce back! Oh, by the way it goes ex divi tomorrow!"
These guys/people better get lean very quick with the debt that wa taken on and CAPEX cuts to make $35 or less oil their profit line.

Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? go to (http://Pick-stocks.com).
"Drawbacks to electric vehicles:1. Range. Miles it can go without re-charging. 130-260 miles.2. Re-charging times. 80% re-charge in 20 to 30 minutes at best.3. Trip planning problems. You need to know where the re-charging stations are and the weather conditions.4. Electric vehicles are only practical in urban areas.5. Environmental damage. Lithium batteries are not re-cyclable and increases demand for more electricity (provided by nuclear plants).6. Expensive.7. Repair difficulties. If you own an electric car, you can forget going to your local shop or fixing it inexpensively. Regardless of the type and the model, all-electric vehicles require specific maintenance and service procedures as well as extremely high safety standards.Also, servicing electric cars can be quite dangerous because most of the car’s mechanics consist of battery packs under high voltage. Also, in case of a fire, you can’t just put it out with water. You have to use a special fire extinguisher since the batteries burn at a much higher temperature.8. Too Heavy. One of the main downsides of having a big battery pack underneath your car is the additional weight. While most modern vehicles are heavy due to all the extra safety and comfort options, electric vehicles are the heaviest champions. On smaller models like the Kia Soul EV, the electric batteries add around 450 extra pounds of weight. However, on some of the high-end models like the Tesla Model X, the battery pack weighs in at over 1,000 pounds. Also, the car itself weighs over 2.3 tons. Heavy vehicles mean more tire wear, more energy consumption, and maintenance too.9. Cold Temperature Issues. When it’s freezing outside, electric vehicles are notorious for displaying specific problems. One of the most common issues is the loss of battery power. It’s similar to old cell phones that would stop working once you took them out of your pocket in the winter. Since the bulk of the electric vehicle market is in the Northern Hemisphere where the winters are cold and snowy, cold weather battery drain can be a big problem for everyday use. Owners report a reduced range and even the failure to operate in especially harsh winter conditions.10. Low Top Speeds. Although there are some electric supercars with insane high speeds like the Rimac Concept One, most regular everyday EVs are quite slow. The top speed of the Golf E or Kia Soul EV is limited to below 100 mph, for instance."

"I've got 3k shares at $15.16 average. I'm going to put in a limit sell at $20.00 for the next year. In one year I'll have one of the following (1) profits of about 12k, (2) absolutely nothing.Sounds good right?"
Someone asked me the other day - please name a reliable source that says OXY is in danger of Ch -11 .Here’s a Yahoo Link :https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/17/5-experts-predict-the-next-oil-stocks-that-could-g.aspx
"Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (APC), now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY)Class Period: February 20, 2015 - May 2, 2017Deadline: April 20, 2020For more info: www.bgandg.com/apcThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the value of the Shenandoah assets and the success of the Shenandoah appraisal wells were overstated; (2) the Company lacked effective internal control over financial reporting; (3) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' statements about the Company's Shenandoah assets lacked a reasonable basis; and (4) accordingly, the Company's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times."
oxy has a beautiful 5yr chart when i do a head stand.
Money has to be rotating out of the sector! No one has the clout to cause this kind of sector wide declines? I can't think of anything else? Thoughts??
"OXY is losing money with negative EPS, how they can pay any dividend?"
The end run tells you this.. and I posted this since zero oil...every player needs oil much higher and they will make it happen...the Saudis like 50s to 60s..the russian claim low 40s...the smaller nations need 50s etc etc...if you looked at the returns of Aramco Lukoil and rosneft you could easily see the prices that they needed...and boom 45 days later we are up 30-40 per barrel...OPEC STATED THEMSELVES THIS IS A NICE START AND THAT THEY CANNOT JUST SIT AROUND...what does that mean...they are not content with current brent prices....oxy was under 10 they pump 500 million barrel per year..their goals are the same as all of the players...so every dollar in wti and brent is about 500 million in profit...the asset sales will come..enough to cover the maturities for next year and the 5-7 billion they will earn from reduced capex and dividend will be gravy.CALL INVESTOR RELATIONS AND VERIFY BREAK EVEN AND THE HEDGE..or just wait for your next headline to daytrade
"Also, a lot of costs are accrued, so paid in first quarter on an anuual basis"
wait for the bounce guys. once this finds the bottom its gonna bounce back
"A sense of sadness and mourning! XOM is ejected from Dow Index and the index which used to include companies from all industries will have no companies in Energy Sector. The level of displeasure towards energy stocks is abhorent. Dow Index used to mean something, it used to have an industrial mix of companies, and when it moved up or down, we had a feel of how the country is doing. Now, ETF investing have converted it into an index of numbers, nothing more! Just a random list of Tech and Banking companies with random few left-overs."
Oil is dropping pretty hard. OXY has been moving inside a channel. Lower resistance around $24. Real good chance we drift down before the next leg up. I'm holding dry powder till it hits resistance. Then its back the truck up Buck!!
Obviously somebody big is buying into OXY and i would expect some kind of announcement next week
At a run rate of 1.4-1.6 million barrels per day thats about 540 million barrels per year...if oil stays above 60 it could allow for EXTRA EARNINGS of 4-5 billion for the year
Sum of the parts...after you spend some times looking at their assets like some of us did a while back you can easily see massive asset value...while balance sheets may have depreciated many of them they appear to be highly valuable and profound...
Dear Carl - Thank you for the cheap shares yesterday. You are a good ole boy.
Almost 22 million shares at above $25
Somebody with very deep pockets has been selling a lot of oil trying to hold light crude under 61. I still say it’s MBS as we know he wants to see the OPEC cuts stay where they are. I remember oil being unnaturally held up at the end of 2019 just before the Saudi Aramco IPO hit the market. Pretty sure the Saudi‘s wanna take market so they can dump some more shares and diversify. If they’re the ones holding the market down right now we’re gonna have to buy those futures back up and we should see some really hot action to the upside.
Super green day today ?
Options Prices ...... Major glitches today. Anybody have any info??
Stay Long and Strong. WTI to hit 70 soon and OXY will cross 30.
"Closing strong with heavy volume, Oxy will be one of the survivors in the energy sector"
"Oil at almost $64 and OXY can't get any traction! That's not right, adjustments to follow."
***** 1 hour into trading..... and we already have about one-third of average volume for a day..... 8 million shares traded.... spotlight is aimed @ OXY ....... so far 10 analysts have it rated as a BUY even though there are enough hold and sell ratings to pull the average down to a HOLD at this point.... but that will change as it approaches the $20 Mark again.... others will be buying in upgrading after they fill their shopping carts...LOL*****deepsub
The report was good. We will see short term pain for long term gain. Oxy added a pre tax billion to guidance. Debt is the biggest question on the call today.
TROLL TACTIC IS WELL ESTABLISHED MAKE SOME FOOLISH STORIES DROP THE STOCK 2-3% EVERYDAY. WAKE UP PEOPLE BANKRUPT OCCIDENTAL CRASHED 40% IN THE LAST 3 WEEKS. I sold all my Occidental Oil shares at 31 US dollars. Occidental Oil price is fixed like other oil stocks for 3 years. Occidental cannot go above 31 Us dollars so its crashing. we all know that OCCIDENTAL IS ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE BANKRUPTCY
As stated it looks like all players will take action when oil breaches 50 goi g forward great news for oxy because their break even is far lower
WHICH STOCK BROKER EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE TONIGHT?
"Where is Emily now or Dale, Mike? What are they scared of, price rise? Shame on the shorties!"
Cant wait for oil to be in the 50s - 60. Oxy will fly in 2021z be patient guys. Gdluck to all
"Occidental Petroleum has chartered two VLCCs for 12 months at strong rates, according to market sources, as shipowners take advantage of healthy vessel demand"
The entire market is selling off to pay for the summer vacations. Profit taking. It will be back up next week
"$80 per barrel oil would get OXY back above $90. I the meantime, I'm collecting that 4%+ dividend."
"What a beautiful beginning, if stocks like Nio with 1000x valuations off actual sales are allowed to run, boy oh boy you better buckle up were well on the way to 30 by summer and that's being conservative."
"Todays price action is brought to you by the price of OIL's current weakness to the tune of ~5% drop. Is it done? Mmmmmmmmmm, probably not. Those that trade are taking advantage of an opportunity to lock in some profits and reenter at a discount. Still going to wait for a $28 handle. But, if OIL keeps peeyuking then OXY will keep dropping. Eyes peeled...."
"oil (energy) has been on No1 market performer for 1 month, from bottom to top, and keep going!"
Lost 7% today and OII is up 4%. Unbelievable...I never put on a big trade pre-earnings. What was I thinking...
"Outstanding report, as someone trading BP, when they reported great numbers, expect screwy prices for a couple days. I suspect algos are programmed to push prices down for a couple days and then slip in with the buy programs."
"its interesting, the Warrants do not seem to be performing as well as they have in past. Previously they were always nearly 2x the stock moves. if stock was up 5% warrant is up 10% stock down 5% warrants down 10%. Now they seem to be trading on par"
I'll share one strategy which is half bullish half neutral. i sold some puts for $28 and I suggest those who are bullish but see a pullback to do the same. that way you make an income but if prices dip below $28 you get those shares at a discount
"oil price suppression continues, it is all about those call options. once these expire this week, it will reach new highs."
This was a “kitchen sink” quarter. Watch this close green tomorrow.
Signed up to (http://Rightpicker.com) last month and instantly saw why my trading buddy has been banking so many winners. She tried to fly under the radar but the secret is out. Join them today.
"Why doesn't Oxy begin to restore its dividend.....most big oils are giving out a good 4- 5% but other than paying our beloved wunderkind CEO her salary, nothing has been mentioned......"
*****even the crooked oil trading market couldn't hold down some of these good oil patch names..... they are trading strongly in their own right....... showing good relative strength!!*****deepsub
I haven’t heard anyone here or seen any announcement from OXY that their $1.33 billion land grant asset sale closed yesterday.. that is HUGE news $1.33B in the bank. Why would OXY not have a press release on this?
"Tom, Raje or JWM its apparent you work for Equity Research department of an investment bank and your comments are BUY sided. Let me ask you what do you think of 38 billion of USD Debt and that no one pays smt for the Assets of OXY because there is no buyer"
"Mass short covering 77 millions shares,"
put any and all cash to work under $24.42 is a low risk play
What caused the huge dump in oil now $64.61/barrel ??????

I have 232 share I bought at $9.75 per shareI see Warrant of $148.16 and 29 shares I read I have 7 years to exercise the warrant @ $22.00 per share. So if the stock gets to say $23.00 per share and I use the warrant to purchase @ the $22.00 per share, what happens to my original stock or 232 shares? Do I loose that? Thanks for your help"
RELAX GUYS market is getting routed..and more to come for tech and stay at home....people panic even with the right holdings so have again on a day like this is a good thing...lets hope for more of the same...like i said too many times FUND MANAGER NEED THOSE % GAINS FOR THEIR BONUSES..BEATEN UP OIL STOCKS are about the only place left

There is a one month lag from when OPEC plus cuts production until those cuts are reflected in the market. We will not see the full impact of the cuts until later this month. In the meantime demand continues to increase.
Oxy has double the production of eog ..and eog had a blowout quarter

"Tax info for warrants from Oxy web site update. What are the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the receipt of the warrants in the distribution?Occidental intends to report the distribution of the warrants as a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of the warrants distributed to you. Accordingly, your tax basis in the warrants received in the distribution will equal the fair market value of the warrants distributed to you. In addition, if you are a non-U.S. holder of Occidental’s common stock, you will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or lower treaty rate, if applicable) on the fair market value of the warrants that would otherwise be delivered to you. Such non-U.S. holders should expect applicable withholding agents to retain and sell a portion of the warrants, or otherwise debit the relevant account, to fund the required withholding tax payment.Occidental intends to report the fair market value of the warrants as $4.95, which is the average of the highest and lowest trading prices of the warrants on the NYSE on August 4, 2020, the first trading date following the distribution of the warrants.Please refer to our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on July 27, 2020, for additional information regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the distribution of the warrants.

"kinda nice OXY has a bunch of Brent priced oil to sale offshore while huge permian $25 or less WTI available that fit right intotheir already huge foot print! It would of hurt them if CVX got the deal. They can produce for much less than Anadarko didwith much of their already employed staff in place,,, Huge huge savings"
Any reason for abnormally high drop in price last 3-4 days compared to peers? Does not make sense.
Strong Buy here!
these colonial guys are part of the manipulation that is going on. wake up guys
"Yea - book value is $31 billion. Market cap is $12 billion. If the assets are all carried at fair value, that means the company is worth more being broken up than operating. It's overleveraged and priced with a high probability of failure. I hope that helps."
where ia mehmet/mary???
So how much do the analyst expect OXY to lose next quarter? They will miss that number reguardless of what it is. Horrible management that is the laughing stock in the investing community. Especially Jim Cramer and he's been 100% correct.
this move can be more about the statement about federal land..the reality is that many US companies probably already have contigency plans that do not include federal lands..they are not going to battle to provide oil to keep the US energy independent ...they can drill elsewhere
"If you want to help create a short squeeze, put a high $dollar, 60 day limit order on your OXY holdings. That removes your shares from the pool of shares available to short. I put on a 60 day limit order on my holdings @ $82."

didnt realize oxy's market cap was this low
They were negotiating with Pertomina. What happened? Crickets.Then it was Boru Energy. What happened? Crickets. Stop the bs and do a deal if you have offers.

Does Buffett's preferred stock remain? Did Buffett sell all of his common shares?
Oxy is a 50 usd Stock.....28 ridicolous ...oxy is a no brainer
Hold on tight people. The oxy veterans here are helping you and telling you that 8.3% drop in the morning was a trap. I even told you several days earlier that this drop could happen and even told people to buy not before the earning. I know it is difficult but hold. In fact hold every stock you have except growth stocks in my personal belief because this temporary inflation they talk about hasnt even started yet.
"Oil stocks selling off today, OXY will get hit harder because of earnings"
"The reopening of the world's economies, the fiscal stimulus, and pent-up savings should fuel very strong demand growth, will it be enough to take the unemployment rate in the United States to 4.5% by the end of the year? Time will tell."

"Buffet now is more like a bank guy lending 10B money to OXY, so I am curious if oxy go bankrupt, Buffett can get back 10B or not ? I think as long as Buffet can not sell the 10B preferred stock, he will not let the bankruptcy happen."
"Guys, merry christmas! BofA will not allow this to go down from now! Take it easy till we reach 29!"
"Has anyone thought about the correlation between inflation and debt? In the hyper inflation era in Germany, one of the groups who benefited most is the companies with high debt because inflation helped them sell their products at much higher price and their debt pretty much became nominal compared to increased in their earnings. When you think about OXY, 1. the oil is the most sensitive commodity to inflation 2. OXY will likely benefit a lot for selling this sensitive beast in the inflationary environment 3. 2 will write of their debt sooner than many anticipate. I don't know what kind of inflationary environment we will face once the covid is gone, but I am quite excited about OXY's future, especially next year when we are COVID free."

i've been watching closely the last few days and it feels like we might have hit that inflection point where the tides have turned in favor of the bulls.
"Saudi Arabia mentioned the other day to need about 76,6 per barrel to balance their budget ..many others you can just look at their balance sheets...most need low sixties to be healthy ...quatar appears to be the lowest at about 40...soon opec will talk with Iran and ask them to play ball...From now on long after covid all the major players will have to work on production so that as the world demand SLOWLY migrates to other from that they continue to flourish ...they could keep oil in the 60s for ever simple by doing what they are doing now monitoring ongoing demand and once again all the major players need oil at healthy levels"
This is probably going to be one of the most volatile and day traded equities Monday!
"I have 10k shares at average just above $15. I may be considered borderline insane, but I am not quite terrified yet. I think we are in for a wild ride in oil prices and hence oil stocks. At the moment, we are in the down-wave of oil price, but looking at how air traffic has come back for labor day (highest since March), road trip and oil usage can't be far behind. Moreover, all companies have stopped spending any CapEx on new wells and exploration, supply is certain to drift down. There has to be a melt-up of oil prices sooner or later. Tech play is done for now. Airlines and cruise stocks have baked in a lot of recovery which hasn't happened in reality, yet. Only oil stocks are trading as of there will be no recovery for few years. I am amused at current oil stocks being punching bags, but not really shaken. I have about three years of wait time. Let's see what happens!"

"How to recover from your GME and $AMC losses. A detailed market summary.Popular opinion says the oil market is dead.In 2001 popular opinion was that the tech sector was dead.In 2009 popular opinion was that the banking and housing industries were dead.You make money when others are wrong. That’s where you find true value.The truth is that oil was hurt by COVID19. The lockdowns hurt demand by 5 million barrels per day. However, since April 2020, oil demand has recovered to 96 million barrels per day - from its 2019 high of 100 million barrels per day.The price has recovered to almost $60 a barrel.As the world goes green, oil demand is expected to continue to rise by 2% annually through 2050 - this is projected by green energy companies.The combination of anti-drilling policies and rising demand creates the perfect Bull Market scenario for oil. By 2023 oil will be $100 per barrel and will range between $100-$150 per barrel through 2050.The cash generated by the high prices will be used by the oil companies to develop better green tech and to buy out existing green competitors. It ensures their continued survival.Today you can buy many high quality companies at a huge discount to true value and get real income with their quarterly distributions.Examples include $ET for $6; $OXY for $22; $GEL for $6 and the $XLE ETF for $42."
"ok, what happened to Mike/Emily/ Alan lately ? anyone knows what fast-food restaurants he working on? please   let me know so I help him out?!"
Oxy paid down 24% of long term debt last year. The plan initiated is working and oil is higher. I expect a best this QTR and a slam dunk for Q3!
I believe once the pandemic is over. Oxy should be able to give out 10 to 14% dividend for the shareholders since they have been giving out 0.79cents per share per quarter prepandemic. If that dividend returns with pandemic gone and debt significantly reduced. The stock might even go 50. Dividend of 10% at 0% interest environment is a killer.
Hold up guys. Do not sell
For shareholders a chance to add a bit more . Weeping time for long -traders .
Better oil plays out there kids.
The Markets want you to feel pain. It wants you to sell and feed into every psychological condition. The market weeds at the weak. All you have to do is hold on to be rewarded. Intrinsic value of time.
"OXY break S13 , next stop is $16."
"JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants. The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE. The following is an excerpt from his article. Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive."" And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing."" That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing."" According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move."
"Looks like Mehmet Sakir information is totally wrong again, he thought oil stocks upper prices were limited by brokers he was TOTALLY wrong again. John you should note that or you will lose your position! Oxy going up on cruise price as our economy improves. I am talking about America not "
Russia is preparing forces to invade Ukraine. We could see oil higher if this happens.
All eyes on CPI 8:30 eastern. inflation on the menu
When is the rest of the sale of assets to Total going to take place. We need the company to reduce debt and interest expense ASAP. Oxy please give the shareholders updates on the status of asset sales. By the way I assume officers will receive 0 bonuses this year. They actually should donate some of their salaries back to the company.

"@Mr Icahn 10%... 20 or so 25 % control company. Say another 88 million shares at 12.00.. Or *88 million shares at $10.00 would be about Buffet's years interest...IF OXY 10K reveals the Buffets preferred parameters, well... Can OXY force the preferred to be bought out and When? What is the conditions setting the warrant execution and price that came with the preferred share...I am in the dark...I am betting Icahn knows/KNEW the answers about the preferred before he increased his ownership of OXY...Can Icahn control with help with only 10% or is Icahn going to need that 22% or more to leverage board votes? I don't know...But 40B of Debt at 4 % is nothing... As 88 million shares at $40.00 a share is 35Billion. And a $3.16 Div on a $40.00 stock yields over 7%... Thus replacing 4% bonds with Equity without Div's would make sense..."

"67 almost a barrel and im not even back to february 2020 prices LOL i love this market, no big rally now?"
Apache generated positive cash flow of 304 million for the past 3 months ...OXY has about 3xs the volume ..granted more debt but supposedly more efficient well flows..should prove out pretty well for them next week
"Contrary to what some believe, it is easy to divest asset during such volatile times. Companies and investors look to buy assets instead of scratching and starting a new project or drilling because it costs a lot less for them AND the production is more predictable for them to calculate. I do not want oxy to rush its deals and sell it for less. They should be getting more money for their assets should oil price stabilizes at 60 dollars which I think it will due to lack of NEW investments in this sector."
The good news is is Icahn sold the shares he said would. We hold hedge funds pickup the slack on buying. Oxy should have a good report with a 5 billion in sales
where did K/mehmet/mary go
We are going green!!!!
And on low volume too. 700000 shares are you kidding me

"Oil will rebound after economy restarts, which will happen very soon. Coronavirus will become a past story soon."
6% decline in oil per barrel today.
the funds got this so wrong by selling today
They’ve also gone from $200/ft operational cost to $135/ft since 2015 and still going lower. People jumping on CAPEX saying it’s not increasing need to see how as much isn’t needed when they’re $65/ft cheaper than they use to be just a few years ago. That’s on average about $1mil in savings per well in the Permian.
"Oil down, Earnings not the best and a whole market sell off...things couldn’t get worst for OXY, just got to get through day and earnings call and hope we had another big oil draw"
anadarka appears to have the same or slightly more oil production as OXY combined it appears to be about 1.4 -1.5 million barrels a day .. that is massive for a company with a market cap this small
Patience!
Mike should jump back in today. last chance under 40
"Mr clean and his ""$25 floor"""
I couldnt resist. I bought as well.
Coincidence or...so for weeks articles appeared that their a record short levels in oil..not normal short levels record levels and all those positions come due tomorrow...and like magic oil prices all 3..interesting though august calls have increasing premiums and as a result held firm with the drop
Oil took off 1/28 - 2/21 which coincidentally was when all oil companies reported. I would bet the same thing is in order come end of April.
Wti is down 2% but oxy is down 0.29%... Bottom maybe in.
tomorrow will be interesting
Monday will be interesting...OXY should drop by the amount of the dividend but in a good market it could recover quickly...
One credit-rating firm argued that Occidental would be more challenged if it “wins” the bidding. “Occidental’s hostile half cash/half stock bid for Anadarko will do material damage to its credit profile if successful
"I am now in the positive. I bought the bulk of my shares in the $9's, $10's and $11's. I have a 1-3 years time horizon and definitely expect OXY's price to higher than $40. I'm a Corporate Accountant for a fortune 100 Company. Been doing it for about $25 years. It was easy to read OXY's balance sheet to know they have plenty of wiggle room to get a handle on their debt. Buffet didnt support the Anadarko deal on a whim, nor did Icahn invest around $1B in this Company after it crashed. Good luck to all."
Aramco covered their dividend in 2019 with wti at 57 and brent of 64
UBER ...demand is far in excess of driver availability ..great news hundreds of thousands of ubers now driving around 24 hours a day
"IMHO I think that everyone in the world is realizing that the price of a barrel oil is headed higher but, because of all of the elusive geopolitical and macroeconomic factors involved in arriving at predicting its future price, NO ONE has the slightest idea of what the average price of a barrel of oil will be in 2020. My prediction is between $67 to $70 but my guess is as good or bad as anyone else's."
After the Powel speech market crashed . Will affect oxy today ? Or we should see a green friday and finish above 30 after lonnng time
see the market majers manipulatinh this in pre market. do not be fooled by their antics. i wont be surprised if this goes red for a minute so they can buy in cheap
Oil has retested Feb 14 lows. It’s one last capitulation before full blown travel and summer is here. Markets do not go up in a straight line. Learn to be indifferent to these moves south.
Thank God I sold this at $40 Goodluck and God be with the long term investors

Simple math ...oil is up now 11-12 per barrel since last quarter... 1.25 million barrels per day....no hard to figure out...nat gas doubled....THEy have over a BILLION MORE IN FREE CASH FLOW THAN LAST QUARTER WHICH ACCORDING TO THEM WAS A RECORD....YOU GUYS HAD A SECOND CHANGE TO BUY APRIL 10 CALLS FOR PEANUTS AND INSTEAD YOU POSTED TO SELL EVERYDAY SINCE 9....VACCINES ARE INCRESING WORLDWIDE RUSSIA CHINA AND THE US...ASIDE FROM THE BENEFITS FOR THE WHOLE WORLDS HEALTH AND WELL BEING...OIL WILL EXPLODE HIGHER THAN PRE COVID FOR A WHILE ...
"If there is restriction on government land to drill, what do you think will happen to the WTI pricing? Supply and demand people. The narrative may be dark but ghe reality will be advantageous. Less oil means less storage, which means more draw downs....in theory. Infrastructure bill when drawdowns are happening and production is still dropping will create pricing stability. Not today....but it will be consistently building pressure as it has for some time now."
"***General question/understanding of warrants.Am I correct in the following statements?The warrant is a contract that allows me to potentially buy OXY stock for the next 7 years after listing sometime in August for $22.00.This as a result creates a potential market for these warrants. The warrants potential value are derived from the stock price, speculation of the future stock price, and the time (t) left until the warrants expire.So in theory if the warrant was do to expire tomorrow and the stock price of the company was at $25.00 the warrant price would be somewhere in the ball park of $3.00. If thebstock price was below $22.00 the warrant price would basically be deemed worthless, as you could buy cheaper shares on the open market, and expire.So in theory if I thought this stock was worth, random number, $60.00, I would want to buy up any and all warrants I could for anything below $38.00. theorerical stock price ($60.00) minus warrant price ($22.00) giving me a warrant value of 38.00.Is this a correct understanding of a warrant?"
"2021 Global economic recovery, Only good news going forward vaccines, stimulus, infrastructure spending, demand for oil will soar back to pre crisis level, it is going to be a BOOOM"
Dear Oxy put writers. Thank you for selling me those options last night.
Time for Vicki and the board to think about what forward guidance is going to be when reporting earnings in August with a realistic projected range for oil prices over the next year. Also the issue of future dividends needs to be addressed. Time to stop operating in the shadows keeping shareholders uninformed.
"In order to retire principal for preferred, will have to pay out $4 in common shares"
I heard OXY is the #1 oil stock to buy....the most upside with rising oil prices plus carbon capture and the madbalder Cramer says yes! Off to the races $40 within 2 months is my guess.
"A LOT of big buying came in at the end of the day starting at 3:47 pm .... one print green was 1.3 mil shares.... the one thing people are missing.. (and this is over simplifying) forget debts and the stuff, just think of the land holdings. Chev was figuring the land holdings of darko at 50k / acre... and all darko's holdings are not prime permian... now think about just the permian land holdings of oxy... 2.5 mil acres.... take just 46 bil valuation on oxy... and again... just the land holdings... not counting any other debts, stuff etc... just the land .... that puts oxy at 18K+ an acre.... for all that prime permian... sooner or later you could see the street start to value some companies differently (just saying) .... you can put $10,000 tires on a 100K car... its still worth $100k.... and you can put $10,000 tires on $2k car.. doesn't make it a $12k car... (and no one will buy it) ...but... sooner or later someone comes along and says... wait... I will buy that car for $4k take the $10,000 tires off put cheap $500 tires on the $2k car sell it for $2k... and sell the $10k tires for $10k separately. its all about who can understand the ""big picture"" I think chev will get the deal... but deep down.. if you are a long player. oxy has some valuable tires sitting there."

OXY is saving BILLIONS by not paying dividends. this will go back to glory days!
I rebought in at $27.50. These prices are great deals!!! I’m a buyer all the way down. Anything below $25.00 is a killer deal in my opinion.

"Because the subject comes up, I will give my opinion. Dividend is Not coming back this year before debt has been addressed to a manageable level. How do we get there? Divest assets, issue shares, or make money. I believe it’s all 3. Make $4 Billion towards debt, divest $8 billion in assets and issue $2 billion for the Warrants. That gets us to about $25 Billion in debt. That’s the number that management was chirping about. Dividend goes back to $3 as long as oil stays above $60. Vicky, IMO, will be a little slow to reinstate dividend to full measure. Better to issue $1 and only eat $250 million so as to attack the tranches the rest of the year. Then I want to see a complete swap of debt for cheap and long debt.Implement all The above, I believe it’s doable by Q3/CC, and you have a $60-$80 stock and nowhere to go but up"

"Important note from the call. It looks like they recognized the sale as revenue but have not received the cash yet. Which is why their working capital dropped by $1.3+ bln. However that cash is presumably coming. This is what they actually said:""Rob PetersonYes. Sure, Neil. Happy to do that for you. So, if you look at a typical first quarter, we historically see a somewhat of a significant draw in the first quarter because of the -- but it was certainly more sizable in the first quarter of this year.When you go back to 2018, Q1 withdraw about $700 million. In 2019, it was about $900 million. And for the opposite reasons of this quarter, 2020 was about $200 million draw because we price going the opposite direction, obviously, in March when the pandemic hit and with the price wars going on.So, regardless of the $1.3 billion draw we experienced in the first quarter does and is exceptionally large. The majority of that was driven by the change in commodity prices. It was the timing difference between revenue recognition and cash received. So, at the end of 2020, WTI was about $48 a barrel, and it was $61 a barrel at the end of March. And so this price increase -- 30% impacts both our AR balances and our inventory significantly, especially when you consider our midstream business and how many barrels are on the water at any given point in time."""
"Bank of America: Oil to hit $60. Bank of America expects oil prices to recover to $60 a barrel for Brent crude in the first half of next year thanks to shrinking global inventories and prices improving faster than previously expected.OPEC compliance hit 95% in July. OPEC compliance with the production cuts reached 95 percent in July. Also, Nigeria and Iraq are expected to cut their production by another 114,000 and 400,000 bpd, respectively, in August and September to compensate for lagging performance in prior months. The success of the deal is notable. “However, in reality, they are likely concerned that it is taking longer for storages to see some material level relief, while the price recovery the alliance was hoping for is also pushed further in time due to the pandemic’s persistence,” Rystad Energy said in a statement."
"The chart. Downtrend line broken to the upside. Now firmly above the 50 day moving average. Next stop is the 100 day at $41.76. All indicators point to higher prices. Fundamentally, oil is climbing, Buffet is buying along with insiders, big dividend is safe and Ichan lurking."

OXY has $10 billion debt. APC has $20 billion debt. And OXY has to borrow another $30 billion to finance the APC deal. That's a whopping $60 billion in debt after the merger and much higher than Chevron's debt level of $30 billion. Pretty scary stuff.
OPEC+ postponed their meeting until Thursday per MarketWatch.
SO Vicki decided to flip off shareholders and gamble with OUR MONEY. NOW - we wait to see if we won or lost. She made this gamble at the twilight of the bull market when oil is having trouble getting out of its own way. Warren Buffett walked off with a no-risk deal and again we too the high risk by default. SO - Vicki really owes all shareholders a no loss clause on this deal where shareholders who were in the stock prior to this questionable move attain an 8-10% yield on their holdings. What is good for Warren should be good for those of us holding all of the risk. Boolean

My brother in law in his 30's, who lives near the equator, just this year put air conditioning in his house for the first time in his life. He, his family, and his peers like it, a lot. Natural gas exports via LNG shipping from the US is growing and needed desperately in a world hungry for more and more electricity. Renewables are great, but the steady demand for more and more electricity is much greater. Despite fracking, natural gas prices in the US have marched upward from 20 cents in the 1970's to $3.00 today, 15X. Natural gas prices are much higher in other areas of the world. Finite commodities like natural gas, with inelastic demand, may provide investors a nice protection against inflation. Disclaimer: Although not long OXY, I appreciate their natural gas assets, but prefer companies with less oil concentrations to natural gas. I am long HGTXU, GURE, AR and SWN, which have natural gas reserves. Those positions may be added to or decreased at any time. Although believed to be accurate, subject to errors. This is not investment advice. I make investment mistakes. Investors should conduct their own due diligence and consult their advisors."

"This has been my point, in a nut shell all along. The World market is not just Opec+. These off shore drillers are getting creamed with heavy debt and aging rigs. $40 just wont cut it. $50 prob wont either. Its the banks people. The Banks. They aren't lending to high debt companies when oil is in the toilet. This in turn is going to have a pronounced effect on production when the world gets back to normal. Investing capex will be behind for a loooong time. Banks will be extraordinarily cautious.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mass-offshore-oil-servicer-failures-143720043.html"

"Look at the 5 day chart , jumped up the 5th ( 5.00 day) and 8th and now stair stepping down with big selloff at the close today . Big volume on the 5th and 8th , average and a little above the last two day . Need some good news or it may go into the weekend with four down days. Just went up too fast now profit taking , increase oil supply and the market downturn is pushing it lower.Eating up earlier gains , most other oils the same way."
How.... HOW.... does Vickki Holub still have a job? She destroyed the company with the Anadarko acquisition and Covid is simply the coffin nail..... and she continues to make 7 figures/year.
In my opinion the smart investor is continuing to buy oxy at this price and holding for 12 months could easily be back to 65 or 70 per share

"We've got some support right around $63 in the OIL futures market. But, I believe the hard support that we travel to is around $60. I do believe the dry powder will become very wet if we get down there. This would drop OXY into the mid $20's. It would be an eyebrow raiser if that happened.

This is much faster than what I envisioned in April 2021 when I took on $OXY. Congrats to longs!"
Oil’s dropping because speculators are covering there gambles on crypto. Oil will be 80 in July and OXY 48ish.
I'm pleasantly surprised at the support for OXY with the freefall of oil. I'm beginning to see that when OIL starts its run again that OXY just might outpace its old trajectory. People might actually start to believe that OIL IS going to go much higher. 60-75 days and we shall see. It will be memorial day weekend and the hard numbers will come in.

someone asked this a while back how much nat gas affects them and It was about 175 million increase in revenue for every 50 cent move...if that is accurate it would certainly affect the bottom line....right now we are stuck in the 40$wti range for a while as predicted 6 months ago...When Russia stated that they can live with low 40s (opec wants 50s) I assumed that we would hang around 40 for a while to crush the small disorganized guys...what Russia and Opec must now realize is that the very small players will be acquired making the larger US Players even stronger...did expect oil stocks to be higher based on the strong rebound..but at these prices % gains with an April- May window could be very very significant ...Oxys average oil price should show an improvement of about 13-15$ per barrel...nat gas was only up about 25% last quarter ....now it has more than doubled from lows...they probably pumped about 1.2 million barrels per day so the recovery should look good.. still a loss but more than likely a nice beat ..if nat gas holds or goes up further they should have some strong guidance ...if nat gas hold 3 they could earn as much as 70cents per share from that segment..in addition their world wide gas assets could be worth a significant premium ...take a look at those assets they are probably worth more than their current market cap .. the political tone has pulled a cloud over oil for a while but as stated almost all nat gas comes from fracking and if biden wins and ends NEW LEASES ON GOVT LANDS OIL WILL JUMP BY PROBABLY 5-10$ PER BARREL..OXY appears to have exposure of about 200k barrels..the increase in price will more than offset the volume decrease..
"Wanted to share some good news. The recent India/China clash has a positive effect on oil prices. India which previously only had 9 days of crude oil in its bunkers, will now try to save upto 90 days and most of the new bunkers will be on US shores. This could mean huge purchases over the coming year from Saudi and WTI oil to store it. India currently represents 5% of world consumption, which means oil meant for store will be huge.Buckle your seats, by December oil will be positively moving up."

"OXY had several VIP news recently, which are very good. no BK worry now. and we can warranty for free which will be traded separately and estimate worthy around $8, ie each OXY share gets $1 now. For OXY longer, it is very happy, we want to more shares.WTI stays $40 now, with this price, OXY can make a lot of money, At lease can generate cash pay for dividends at the previous level ( close $4 per year), that is 4B, that is they tried to keep dividends in case of oil fall to 40, so we can expect the third quoter should be a very good one.WB just brought 10 B D's assets, that tells us next a few years WTI will not stay 40, 50 even 60, they will go 80, even $100 because the damage has been done in this industry."
"Every aspect of life including investing has been infected by ""spin"". Fundamentals in the short and mid-terms have almost lost all significance. The only thing that matters in the short term, and sometimes mid-term, is the quality of the spiel of those holding the megaphone to convince the gullible investing public to plunge their money into the ""desired"" investment of the moment. Over 50% of all stocks today will never live up to their PE ratio and many will disappear from the landscape without ever providing their investors a penny in return. That is not the case for OXY. Oxy owns hard, tangible assets for which the world will continue to thirst for for many years to come. Yes OXY has a sizeable debt. But that debt is in dollars which are likely to continue to be worth less and less over time. Oxy is cheap. Its assets are worth over 4 times the amount at which the marketplace is currently valuing them. I have a long-term horizon. I will continue to add shares at what are to me, bargain prices."
AS WE SAID OXY HAS 24.5 BROKER SET MARKET CAP. PRICE CANNOT GO ABOVE 24.5 USD. THE DOWNSIDE RISK IS UNLIMITED. OXY HAS 39 BILLION US DOLLARS OF DEBT. THEY EVEN CANNOT PAY INTEREST ON DEBT THATS WHY THEY SELL WELLS OR WHATEVER THEY CAN FIND
"I took a quick cursory glance through your message boards. Although its part for the coarse as far as yahoo msg boards, but the norm for oil and gas is usually much more informed. Some of you are trying to crunch the numbers, but instead what is more reasonable is having a particular trustworthy analyst that really knows what is happening and recently came out with an estimate. What I see on this board is zero talk about how much one dollar increase in the price of oil this quarter will improve the bottom line NEXT year. Ask yourself: why is it that OXY will wait to start ramping up Capex until later this year which will ramp up bopd next year..... OXY has good assets and their bottom line will show it next year. One last thing, how shall I say this..... your stock price is not being manipulated. Cheers and glta, both long and short, take what I said however you want just don't take it personally."
"These oil companies can always control their earnings by adjusting their impairment charges. As long as OXY does not write off their asset value in Q4, it will beat the earnings. We should focus on their cash flow, as they cannot hide or twist numbers. From Q2 last year when every oil company was bleeding, I sensed OXY had a breakeven FCF, which indirectly suggesting that they are cutting down their operation cost and making their operation immensely efficient. This was more noticeable in Q3 when it started reporting a positive FCF. Q4 will be even better and from 2021 and beyond, OXY will start posting monstrous FCF. We just need to sit back and relax, and enjoy ride the wave UP!"

Net and core income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $706 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, and $922 million, or $1.22 per diluted share, respectively. “We’re proud to have completed another strong quarter with all three of our business segments performing exceptionally well. Occidental continues to execute on its returns-focused strategy of generating free cash flow and value-based production growth,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub. “We returned approximately $800 million to shareholders in the first quarter through dividends and share repurchases.” QUARTERLY RESULTS Oil and Gas Oil and gas pre-tax income for the first quarter of 2019 was $484 million, compared to $145 million for the prior quarter. Excluding impairment charges, oil and gas pre-tax core income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was $365 million. The increase in first quarter core income, compared to the prior quarter, reflected lower depreciation, depletion and amortization rates for 2019 as well as a positive non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on carbon dioxide purchase contracts. Total average daily production volumes exceeded guidance at 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) for the first quarter of 2019, compared to 700,000 BOE for the fourth quarter of 2018. Permian Resources average daily production volumes came in at the high end of guidance at 261,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2019, an increase of 4 percent from the prior quarter due to improved well performance and development activity. Year-over-year, Permian Resources production for the first quarter of 2019 increased by 47 percent. International average daily production volumes exceeded guidance at 298,000 BOE for the first quarter of 2019, compared to 290,000 BOE for the fourth quarter of 2018, due to increased production in Oman."

Toon commented on this thread in the last 24 hours over 30 times .....
"Overall consumption is just now starting to pick up steam. World production is being held back to the tune of 7mbd. But, lets be real. The consumption of fuel by the airlines, cruise lines, and automobile is the ultimate trigger. Non of them have opened up. It doesn't matter if you agree with opening up or not, mask or not, the economy is at the gate of oil consumption and the starting pistol is raised. Its March 9th and herd immunity by injection or otherwise is June 1st at the latest. The fuel consumption that will be embarked on will quickly and increasingly overwhelm production and drain the storage levels. Its only 2 months from here.OPEC+ is shockingly disciplined here. Holding off production will have created strong pricing support in the long run. IMO, the chart looks like another 5%+ drop to ~$60 oil. The sentiment will drop OXY well into the $27's. The 20dma is $27.11. If it falls below that, I wouldn't think it would be for very long. Intraday maybe? This week is the washout, especially with the crude build up. The herd doesn't like the build, but I ain't scared. Thats normal from a freeze standpoint. Refineries are struggling to open. They will and will catch up quickly and get back to normal. Next week and the week after should see us back to normal consumption over production ratio. Thats why I believe this week is the washout and into next week. IMO, resumption of the price runup in OIL continues. We get our storage numbers next week, and the following, and I believe we will have our trough in.IMO, the Warrants are the only play here. There is no dividend, and if you believe a dividend is coming back this year, I don't, then why own the stock on a 6+ year runway? Even if a dividend comes when we aren't looking, whats the worst that can happen? An inflation of the Warrant? Yeah, I'm looking for the reentry into Warrants. If we get down to the 20dma then the Warrants should be mid $12's or lower. Incredible entry point. I'm looking to exit some calls in another stock, take my profits, and ride the OXY horse to the finish line. My winning horse is named Warrant!"

"After a huge run, today it holds strong ."
FWIW-So I didn’t end up buying puts EOD after all because of the strong close . The volume on today’s run was impressive . No positions open at 4pm . I’ll revisit on Monday . Congrats to Longs . Perhaps OXY will avoid BK -given the stock move this past week the 400 million in new share authorization is worth much more now for a debt swap or to otherwise sell to help with the cash situation . It certainly looks much much better for OXY today than it has really all year . Have a great weekend all . Even you Ivan .
"Sorry OXY investors for buying into this stock at $47.20 last week or so. As soon as I purchased, it spiral down. If I sell, I know the stock will rebound and then everyone can thank me. But will wait this one out until I break even. May be awhile...See this stock at $40 and then hold steady. Can't get a break..."
OXY is considered a premier play in a market with rising oil. Many longs are thinking this stock is going back to pre-covid levels ($37 to $42) after next round of earnings are announced. However without the same divi it used to have am trying to decide what kind of earnings you guys are betting on to lift it above the $32 area. Is everyone betting OXY surprising to the upside?

This stock is down almost $3.00 since Monday. That's because the earnings report was so great an we had such an enlightening earnings call!
Gone up from $20 to $32 in one month was a 62% move. OXY is not making any money and its reserves are down 30%. Short covering was the main power behind the move. Big boys are taking their 62% profit out.
nearly 3 times the usual volume. what happened today?
If this drops $20 or under I will be buying 5k shares. This company has given me plenty $.

"A quote you should have heard today. >>>""At the current rate of deleveraging we can have this puppy paid off in 30.5 years.... give or take a few years, uh, you know. But wait! We may have an asset sale. Stay tuned, meanwhile you don't mind if your shares get battered just a tad, do you?"""
carbon capture is key of oxy.
So disappointed with OXY. Clearasil stock is soaring.

watch this rocket once we cross that
"I am not all in OXY. However, I am mostly in. I believe this is at $30 in short order. If I am wrong it will be a painful mistake. My painful mistake."

INDIAN CALL CENTER TROLLS ARE SO EXCITED TO SELL OXY SHARES. JUNE 2020 MARKET PEAK IS CONFIRMED AT 24.5 USD A DOWN TREND IS ABOUT TO START ONCE MARKET MAKER SELLS OXY TO NEW BUYERS AS USUAL
OXY why no strength in rally? Every company is beating the street estimates by a mile. Cant wait for Shell and XOM on friday.
Perhaps someone would like field these questions.(1) How much of a advantage does domestically produced crude have over imported crude? (2) What percent of OXY's acreage is on federal lands?Thanks in advance

"OXY BROKERS INVESTMENT BANKS employs 850+ INTERNET STOCK PROMOTERS TO DISGUISE THAT OXY IS BANKRUPT WITH 39 BILLION USD DEBT. OXY STOCK CRASH STARTED, TARGET TO REACH 10 USD SHARE PRICE IN 3 WEEKS."
Apache decimated analyst expectations..With Oxy pumping about 3xs the volume they should crush estimates
JWM GLADIATOR CHRIS ROCCO RAJE THESE ARE THE EMPLOYEES OF THE SAME BROKER. WHY DO THEY WANT YOU TO BUY OXY STOCK WHEN PRICES DECLINE?
"higher oil prices will add to the inflationary spiral if done too quickly and force the fed to raise interest rates, a very very dangerous bubble imploding move! why opec why??"
loading up on the dip.
My cost basis for OXY is in the $50 range. Looks like I might break even soon.
"Here she goes, not enough oil available!"
"OXY = Nuclear bomb about to explode. $35 intermediate target. $40 once the COVID numbers weaken in India. $50 when the world starts opening their borders ""free"" from COVID. $60 and beyond after 1. the world normalizes, 2. inflation kicks in 3. oil supply issue being magnified with all those production cut and BK of oil companies in 2020. It is ticking everyday. The only thing suppressing OXY is the COVID. Watch this explode soon!"
The higher a barrel of oil so goes Oxy.
Fill the burn Alan!
"oil tanking, oxy rising.. what are the big boys up to?"
lagging the market as usual
"On the other hand, wti chart seems a little shaky. You had this awesome EIA report but wti went up and went down. Wti is holding resistance at lower 65. If it breaks 65 it may go lower to 63. There needs to be news as Europe reopening or India significant covid case reduction otherwise wti could go down further."
Beautiful crypto sell off
Energy being ignored today lol wow.....what a market we are in.
Earnings coming up....2...4...6...8...who do we appreciate? OXY...OXY...OXY... Go OXY Go...Go OXY Go...Go OXY Go...OXY OXY forever and to the moon. $50 after earnings.
"OXY has had a good run up. Creating a new base. Will tack for awhile in low $20. Meanwhile every day at WTI at $50 plus the cash flows big time, the earning reports will be awesome, for the quarter and going forward. Price for asset sales will not be at desperate prices. Future is great, problems in rear view. Patience !"
"Pfizer vaccine is out, stimulus to pass in days. OXY going higher. I see $23 by Friday"
"Carl sold off some holding s last Monday, let’s hope it’s not another Carl Monday"
All the bad news baked in. Green arrows ahead. Positive they will make this happen. All my in my opinion
"Saudi is not going to lift their additional 1 million bpd production cut in May when European countries are under lockdown again, causing uncertainty. European lockdown is actually good news for us because for the U.S. and Canada the demand is going to continue to go up with vaccine roll out. It will further increase the chance of oil demand/supply imbalance. Plus, whether they like it or not, they make more money with the cut than without it."
Relax
"So is the ""Permian"" premium yesterday's news. Seems unlikely, so why are the OXY, APA and EOG's of the world down despite the high probability of an ""event"". Buy on the dip seems to make the most sense in a world where less and less makes sense, especially monetary policy on a global scale. Well in the end you can't burn enough currency to keep cars running, factories humming and homes comfortable w/o oil. So I'll take my chances w/ oil."
"Man, if they temporarily cancel common divy and repurchase shares at this level, we would be money..."
If the guidance is good I expect the price of oxy to be higher than 31 by the end of may or sooner. I just want to make sure they did not hedge. They are getting rid of that African asset for 500 million dollars or more. That they are producing more oil next quarter as they have mentioned during the last quarter's conference call.
Soon petroleum products willBe the hot market Stock up on Vaseline Shorts will need lots of it
"Oil stock is getting hammered partly because Bernie is the front runner in the Democrats party. If Bernie is nominated, we can count our investment in OXY tank to single digit since OXY is primarily concentrated in the US. It'ss either terrorist risk or US political risk, not sure which one is more comfortable. Oil stocks have too many political risk (home and abroad). I wish all the environmentalists would understand that without oil, the US can't have power 24/7. Oil stocks are definitely underappreciated. Once i'm break even with oxy, i'll keep a smaller amount of share and will not look back."
realize that Mehmet is back every time funny stuff happens
"Just pros pushing down price to hit stops and buy cheaper. The electrification hysteria is still giving you a chance to buy OXY at 40% below cash flow valuations. At some point not only will this discount be fully erased, it will be replaced with a “give me any commodity to protect against Currency devaluation” premium of 20%."
"I believe option expiration on Friday. Keeping the cap on it. Earnings release on Monday. Potential better than expected results, mention of better metrics on debt along with mentioning paying it off faster with the prices where they are. If Oil stays here, they are printing money..... My guess is Tuesday gaps over $30."
WTI is down 24 percent Sunday. Hovering @$32. It is going to be a bloodbath Monday. Dividend will have to be eliminated. Obviously Saudi’s starting a oil war and trying to destroy Permian oil. Bad news for oil sector already hurting from corona virus.
WTI down over $4.00/barrel in two days!!!

I really... Think... Today and tomorrow's inventory report will be shocking.. I really do belive that we are going to have severe gasoline and distillate shortage.. Unless we import the darn things. Only 8 out of 16 refineries are up and running in texas right now.... Oil demand has increased and the supply is constrained the same way
Why is OXY going up? Is the market anticipating CVX making another bid or OXY shareholder stopping this expensive deal?
"Am in it till the end, and will see who will laugh at the end "
"more warrants for me as well i suppose, only have until 2027 and $4 off in a month"
Hold folks. The bubble is popping and staying in oil is one of the best hedges against it! OXY has lots of room to run.
"Occidental Petroleum...................say it with me, Feel The Power."
They are trying to reach 2-3 billion divesture by middle of 2021. The company mentioned that they have offers for some assets right now. Let's close it and get some $$$.
"This stocks performance over the last month has been horrible. Oil at it's highest level in a month over $63.00 a barrel. It's clear that until some positive news comes out about OXY it's going to underperform!! Frustrating as it may be there is nothing to do but wait, because it isn't following along with Oil."
"OXY now trading near its five year low. The whole sector is weak, but OXY is the weakest of the large integrated oil and gas. OXY will ultimately bounce, whether the deal goes through or not. You may have to wait a while as investors don't like uncertainty. The sooner management can clear things up, one way or the other, the better. I think it probably takes at least three months for the clouds to lift, and maybe six months. These things never happen as fast as anyone would like. At the present time, we don't know if CVX will raise the bid or if APC will accept. Lots of uncertainty. If you like to trade pairs, as I do, then perhaps long OXY, and short one of BP, RDS-A, or XLE. If you are in it for the long haul, then buy low and sell high."
when we see crude go to 70 I bet this goes to 35+
"Oxy .... a. Um for me....oxy will,weaver the storm and will be the biggest profiteur of rising oil prices.Today financial times announced, that Astra Zenecas vaccine is susceessfull in last studies. WOW ...A GAME CHANGER1- Occidental PetroleumOccidental Petroleum has seen its stock price drop by more than 85% since mid-2018 on the back of what was arguably the worst acquisition of all time with Anadarko. The company has been forced to cut its dividend from $0.79 to $0.11 / quarter and cut its capital spending by ~$1.3 billion annually below its breakeven rates.However, the company's new breakeven is ""in the low $30s / barrel WTI"" not counting the company's hedges. The company's hedges, through a three-way cost less collar to add $10 / barrel for 300,000 barrels / day in production in 2020. Across the company's entire production that's nearly $3 / barrel above current prices from the hedging.That's perfect because it means the company's actual WTI breakeven is ~$28-29 / barrel WTI or ~$3-4 / barrel (~10%) below current prices. The company has significant debt, but it also has room to cut its dividend further if needed (saving ~$500 million annually if it chooses too or ~$1.5/ barrel). So the company has the financial strength to breakeven at current prices, which means while shareholder rewards won’t be there, it could weather a long oil crisis.Last, it was worth noting that previously, at $40 / barrel WTI, Occidental Petroleum was breaking even with its old dividend. At $50 / barrel WTI it could increase production. But with its old dividend at almost 30% based on current prices, and the company able to cover that at $40 / barrel WTI, that means even with a slight recovery in oil prices in 12 months, the company could generate significant shareholder rewards. Remember, we’re expecting $55 WTI by second half 2020."
"With the exception of 2-3, almost all oil companies are at or near the red. Only a few are pennies ahead. It isn't just OXY, but this is not a great start to the week."
"With the asset selling and oil prices coming back up soon, this is the bottom. Perfect time to stock up."
"Oxy is Save, they have a +10 USD Hedge and are working profitable at oil in low 30 USD.After cuts of investments and dividends and now lower interest rates oxy will be the biggest winner, if oil price starts to get up. And this will happen soon."
We want oxy>32.5 today
Form 4Icahn bought almost another 1.1 million warrants total up to almost 16.7 million
"I have read a post from somewhere which makes quite a sense. what people are going to do after reopen? Driving. Less people are going flyer, a lot more will driving a long distance for sure, which need a lot more gas. that is the reason GS predict a very high oil price for the end of 2020 and year 2021."
"Covid fatality rate continues to go lower (Despite Media Fear mongering)...Crude Oil continues to go Higher. Air Traffic Picking Up. The lag in this stock's price is 100% due to fear of another shut down that more than likely will not happen. We simply cannot afford it, and the dollar will always dictate action regardless of political affiliation.We are literally testing 3X more people than we were at the end of May. this surge in cases shouldn't be a surprise, especially since there was already wide speculation surrounding asymptomatic cases.The sheep will always be one step behind. The Recovery narrative in the media (at least on Fox) will start as soon as next week when the fear of being wrong and giving the rival network an embarrassing soundbyte is gone."
OIL over $20 now and climbing. Great news! Today will be a green day regardless of an overall down market. short term $30 year end $45.
5 bottoms.. never seen this in months
Oxy Company will be holding a call with analyst tomorrow.
i guess oil traders are waiting gor the data on gas draw
They said nothing that might give hope to the stock
"Great news all. My cart is loaded. Shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) surged 1.7% in premarket trading Friday, after Susquehanna analyst Biju Perincheril said it's time to buy into the oil and natural gas exploration and production company again, citing confidence in an oil price recovery. Perincheril raised his rating to positive, after downgrading it to neutral on March 16, and boosted his stock price target by 64% to $18, from $11. Perincheril is ""increasingly confident"" that crude oil prices will rise to about $50 per barrel by the end of 2021 and into 2022 on the back of improving economic data points and recent positive news on a potential COVID-19 vaccine. ""[Occidental's] large debt burden has been a major headwind for the stock this year, but we see a line of sight to an improving leverage profile through enhanced free cash flow generation from higher oil prices,"" Perincheril wrote in a note to clients. Crude oil futures (CL00) were up 0.7% at $42.20 in recent trading. Perincheril also believes Occidental's target for $2 billion to $3 billion in asset sales could increase if the oil outlook keeps improving, which would speed up deleveraging efforts. The stock has tumbled 67.6% year to date through Thursday, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE) has shed 40.0%, crude futures have lost 31.0% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has gained 10.9%."
Hope for a good drawdown in oil inventories!!!#
Thoughts on dividend comeback this earning release?
"Summary of EIA report today:* Total inventories *decrease* by 11.7M* Crude oil inventory only *2% above* five year average* Motor gasoline right at five year average* Distillate 7% above five year average* Propane 9% *below* five year averageUsage data:* Total usage 5.8% below last year* Gasoline 10.1% below last year* Distillate 1.9% above last year* Jet fuel 33.7% below last yearStorage excesses are getting close to five year average, and won't be long before data starts showing them below five year average. That is when supply concerns headlines will start popping up. Vaccine and eventual reopening by summer travel season will push up the usage to normalish, but production will be far below normal. Barring any unforeseen events, all parameters are pointing to perfect storm for higher oil price. Oil companies, and their lenders will think million times before committing capital for CapEx. We will be likely at the mercy of OPEC+ for energy and their pricing for the next 3-4 years atleast."
the living in the past crowd can just break away and leave...what do relentless posts about past mistakes do for you or anyone else....not just here in life. The shouldnt have bough the company but they did...cant change that...you should have rebought options and stock at 9 ...production is down but capex is way down too....they are working at the sweetspot like all producers now....you guys talk about just increasing production ....??? reallyif everyone thinks that way B POSTS..OPEC WILL INCREASE PRODUCTION AND LOWER PRICES.... WITH 1.6-2 BILLION IN FREE CASH FLOW PER QUARTER IT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO HAMMER DOWN DEBT....some sale will just appear at a premium for a couple of more billion and just like that debt could be down 10 -12 billion in 12 months ....nice that they have depreciation to offset massive earnings.... free cash flow at current levels could put them well over 2 billion in free cash flow...to put that in perspective ...6 -8 billion in free cash flow is about 6.5-8.5 a share

"Buy when there is a greater uncertainty (discount) and fear, and Sell when things settle (premium) and people are happy."
"Mehmet, John and Suzanne lost all grandma's money shorting OXY"
"Savita, the well known strategist from Bank of America is bullish on energy stocks despite being head of ESG. Oxy will be much higher in 2 months You are welcome Mehmet"
Glad where are u ?? we need back asap!
"Shaking out the weak hands. Vanguard has access to way more tools and data than we do. They didnt buy more for charity reasons... I've seen this game before. Hold on, it will turn out fine."
this stock was leading the oil pack for most of the first leg of the rally. now it outperforms on down days and underperforms on up days. pays no dividend and is selling it's assets at fire sale prices. I don't think this company is investable until they get a new ceo and start paying dividends again.
"It appears as the oil market has recovered, stabilized and trending up, the market for asset sales for OXY is looking good. I believe can expect some sales in the near future. The proceeds will go to reducing the debt and the high interest payments. Cash flow will improve. When Oxy can begin to restore stock holder dividends, we will see the stock price moving up big time. Keep your eye on the asset sales."

I was just chatting about the oil industry the cyber attack is going to hike the price of oil and in another thread about internet security if the hackers get past the edge routers or the firewall routers/server we are all vulnerable.
2nd quarter is going to be fantastic. We are half way finishing it believe it or not. Revenue is strong. EPS improved significantly. Strong FCF. It will have greater production q2. Reopening will take place soon in the U.S. and in Europe. International flight rising. Summer driving season will comr at the right time for the U.S.. India and Japan have peaked and their cases will go down. Along with inflation. This stock will catch up with others. At least 30 by the end of the month I think.
"Don't look for any real move to the upside until earnings or some pre announcement . Nothing to move it higher just a slow drop while waiting. Mgt. needs to come out with a positive statement like some of the other oils. I look for a small beat or a little miss ( right now leaning to another miss ) on production drop. Nothing to help FCF on the 1st quarter . Needs some assets sells and increase production , hopefully the second quarter will bring them."

"You haver to wonder what the saudis are thinking right now 7 million barrels per day and the drop today....all of the players have to ......option premiums have increased today leaving no room to increase long option positions...august calls and further out barely moved for in the money strikes ....they must assume that it is very very shortlived...some guy posted on BP the short positions in every oil co and most are coming due now...not too hard for that many players to work their 'MAGIC"" to mitigate their already massive losses"
"Everyone of us should take responsibility for our own investment and understand the risk associated with it. Energy industry is a tough one to invest because each of the US oil company is a small fish comparing to two gigantic sharks (Saudi and Russia). We can't collude together and set supply target like them.All oil companies have received severe one-two punch much more severe than companies in other industries. OXY is being impacted slightly more but its peers are not better off. When there was an imminent war with Iran, OXY was applauded for making the right decision to focus mainly in the US. No one had a crystal ball to see a coronavirus in 2020 and then was followed with an impulsive decision by a 34-year old man-child.We saw news of shutdown in China early in January but we lacked the ability to see what it would be once it's being spread globally. We saw the tantrum fight between OPEC and Russia early last week but we lacked the ability to understand that we don't want to be the small guys getting trapped when two giants decided to go at each other. The warning signs were there for us to see. Investing is not easy. It requires discipline, decisiveness and the ability to connect all events together and understand how it would affect to each stock in our portfolio. IMO, OXY is one of the five lowest cost producers in the US. The risk of bankruptcy is low but you will probably see share dilution if this is prolonged enough. Good luck to any of us who are still OXY shareholders and hope the price war will end soon enough."
"OXY has roughly 6.7 BILLION cubic feet of natural gas reserves. Great optimism on natural gas:1. On a BTU energy equivalent basis, natural gas should be close to $10 when oil is just at $60 a barrel. Oil is higher than that already.2. The USA really just started exporting natural gas as LNG in 2016, and capacity to export more is increasing dramatically. We already export, just via LNG, more than 10 percent of annual national production.3. Number 2 should tend to bring number 1 closer in the long term.4. The US is increasing exports to Mexico and Canada via more and more pipelines and export roughly the same amount of natural gas via pipelines as we do via LNG .5. We are building more and more natural gas electric generating plants each year and this is expected to increase right through 2050 according to the US EIA. This is long term demand growth.6. Each electric vehicle will need electricity and natural gas electric generation will be very much needed to provide greater and greater electricity supply.7. Each electric vehicle may reduce the need for so much oil and thus may result in lower associated natural gas and higher gas prices. Yet at the same time even more natural gas will be needed to produce electricity for electric cars.8. Natural gas is the most economic feedstock to produce hydrogen. Maybe the only viable feedstock.9. Bill Gates, through an investment vehicle, recently invested in technology to convert natural gas to hydrogen in a very environmentally favorable way. A possible large clean way to use natural gas.10. Numerous big companies are purchasing delivery trucks for use in the USA that run on natural gas. Amazon has recently ordered HUNDREDS of such trucks.11. Natural gas is a finite commodity with relatively inelastic demand. Not making more, but using more and more all the time all around the world. Population and electric demand are growing.12. Ethane, from natural gas is needed to make plastic.13. Wall Street appears to have had a serious aversion to natural gas producers in recent past. It appears this could be changing. It appears the only viable economic way towards a cleaner future for much of the world. The pendulum seems to be swinging favorably.14. When herd mentality changes, prices can move quite impressively.Disclaimer: Although not long OXY, I appreciate their natural gas assets, but prefer companies with less oil concentrations. I am long HGTXU, GURE, AR, and SWN all of which have natural gas reserves. I may add to, or decrease holdings at any time. I am subject to errors of judgement and can create my own financial mistakes quite well. This is not investment advice and may be subject to errors. Investors should do their own due diligence and consult their advisors. Although believed to be accurate, posts may be subject to errors."

Multiple reasons.1) $1.9 Trillion of new debt only exacerbates the debt issue and puts incredible pressure on inflation metrics. As the dollar goes, so does pricing of oil. The dollar is going higher for the foreseeable future.2) Infrastructure needs commodities to fulfill the building of projects3) with infrastructure comes high paying jobs and a boom to the economyNow add the reopening of the world over the next 12-18 months. Yes, C19 restrictions will be much sooner, but cruise ships and jet liners will need another 12 months beyond that to get to pre C19 levels. This by default opens all markets especially discretionary market spending. When you feel good, you spend good.Couple this with an eyepopping restriction to CapEx on new production, and you have a painful oil squeeze coming. The pundits see $80 oil, I see it much higher. Not just because I'm talking my book, but because elections and world government decisions, Russia- SA, have drastic consequences. Pandemics have consequences. Irrational behavior will push oil well above $100 by EOY 2022 IMO. Unreasonable? So was -$37/barrel oil. Emotion makes pricing unpredictable. They say $80, I see it emotionally much higher. $100-$120."
"I sold my occidental shares and warrants after I learned from here that stock is manipulated by trolls and there is a price bar at 31.5 us dollars. Although I was in losses, I dont want to associate with a trick oil companies, ı will invest in high techs stocks no more oil companies."
easy entry for 30s expiring tomorrow
OXY broke trend today. Usually shorts are in charge Mondays. Good sign
***** C' mon OXY...... let's see a closing price at $17......... as a Thanksgiving gift for all the OXY--FANS!!!*****deepsub
Oil will be the trade in next 3 months
"Yeah i gotta go long at 13 i mean thats just an insane discount and its nicely primed right now in a few weeks when tech gets rotated out of cant lose much grabbing a few 1000 shares at this level long. Bk not happening when WTI was 15, certainly not happening now with the recent asset sale. GL to all patience is key, oil is not disappearing in our life time, they'll get the debt in order the worlds biggest cartel isnt going to let a barrel go under 35 again. And please before the shorts start jumping in and rambling im just stating my own opinion lol dont bother telling me this wont go back to high teens at a minimum within a years time."
"Maybe it pays me via recovery induced momentum in the next few weeks, or maybe it pays me via dividend per the X000 shares I bought on the cheap over the next few years.. Either way it pays me. History and Data are on the side of Oxy, I don't care what you say about the debt. Are Americans (and increasingly the rest of the world addicted to exponential increases in their energy consumption? The answer has for the past 90 years been yes. And unless something catastrophic happens in which case none of this matters, the answer will continue to be Yes.the answers to the stock market test are right in front of you."
"$19 or $8 ... it doesn't matter. When everything returns to normal (1y - 2y) OXY will be $60 again. In the meantime, short it as you please."
"May 9, 2019 (Globe Newswire) PrintOccidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) said today that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.78 per share on common stock payable on July 15, 2019, to stockholders of record as of June 10, 2019. Occidental has paid quarterly dividends continuously since 1975 and has increased its dividend each year since 2002. The current annual rate is $3.12 per share."
***** Warrants R UP.....17%...... and it's looking like we might see that 50 million share trading day that I've been waiting for for the last couple of weeks.............OXY is definitely in play along with I have a few other Permian players in the lead position in this oil patch move*****deepsub
exact same pattern and exact same volume sold
when occidental oil announce bankruptcy ı can earn alot if ı am short in equity right? fingers crossed
"I bought roughly 1500 shares of oxy at the price of 10$, 15$ and 24$, with the average price of 15$. Stock has circles and the only thing I really care about is the underlying value. I'm holding firmly till oxy reaches 50. Please try not timing the market, that's impossoble. But timing the value is good"

The push is coming, this will be the last sector lifted up but make no mistake this is a bull market from here on out for the foreseeable future. Stay patient the upside here is 1000% and the downside is almost non-existent from these levels.

"WB was defending his stake in Chevron based upon the critics view of fossil fuel. I believe his big position in Chevron will somehow be conflated w/ his huge investment in OXY to maximize the value of both investments. Talk about being accretive, the amount of free cash w/b tremendous at $60 oil. I know the debt makes it prohibitive. But remember who a big piece of the debt belongs to and its convertible. So use Chevron stock to buy OXY with some cash, enough to cancel out non WB debt. And then WB converts his OXY debt to shares pre-merger and walks away w/ a huge capital gain when he sells the OXY shares or sticks around and get even more Chevron shares which now includes Chemicals, Pipeline and Carbon Capture as part of their core businesses."

Do some of you folks who are long REALLY think that by posting stuff like BUY BUY BUY that you are going to really make a difference in the price of this stock ?There are over 800 million shares outstanding . Posters here including me have ZERO influence on what direction this goes . ZERO .

"All these 2030 peak demand reports assume people’s disposable income can afford a $25k electric vehicle over a $2k used Toyota. They need to wake up and smell the coffee. People is broke and just want a job to pay their bubbled house. Fed is maxed out on the QE/low rates, no room to finance solar panels. Live within your means, drive a combustion engine vehicle.$OXY $CVX $XOM"

"Basically Vicky turned Oxy's #$%$ as a margin account with huge debt, which means if the oil price increase substantially, the #$%$ can generate FCF immensely. If the oil stays low, FCF generation is limited and their #$%$ seems worthless. However, we should note that their asset value/size is also huge even after recognizing the significant impairment charges from Q4 2019, Q1 and Q2 2020. If the oil price is headed back to $60 or more, the asset value will be worth more than $90-100 billion. By disposing $5 billion worth of asset value from the appreciated asset value, it can take care off the near term debt and by that time, FCF will be massive that their debt will look like almost nothing and is well manageable. So, the key is where the oil price will be in next 1-2 years. My projection is that by November 2020, the oil price will be back to $50 primarily due to significant reduced production. The gasoline overall supply is now back within the 5 year moving average according to the EIA report, and the crude is also heading this direction, even though there was a slight build in this week's report. If the demand is fully recovered while maintaining the current production level, we may break the oil price beyond $100, an unthinkable oil price next 1-2 years. People will jump back for oil stocks and they will kick their butts why they did not buy any shares NOW. I think we need to be patient, relaxed and play video games while waiting."
Looking good gentlemen...
Same pattern every day this week. Big run up at market open...followed by sell off for several hours during the day...then a close above what was the peak price of the initial early day run up. Watch for it...
So is the deadline to buy shares and receive the Warrant the close of business on 7/6 or yesterday 7/1 to allow for the T+2 and the holiday weekend?
Today's lesson is that buying a stock for the dividend doesn't always work.....
OXY hit a 52 week low today. It is what is called a stage 4 decline. I don't think anyone should buy anyone until the stock stabilizes.
"I’m in the green now, woohoo!!!"
43987 shares of Oxy accumulated in the past 2 months. Oil prices continue to rise with more vaccines and 1.9T fiscal stimulus on the way. . Short squeeze soon.
OPEC to increase output!!!!!
oxy has been trading spot on with the XLE for several day now.. this is a new behavior as it used to swing more in both directions.. this bids well IMO for the stock's stability.....
Pray for solid EIA numbers tomorrow. Please someone ring the bell
"The 2021 topside hedge. Anyone here recall at what price it is set at? I know it is somewhere between $70-$75. Also is it just on the first 300,000 bpd?"

"Question to long time oil patch investors. How come in earning calls and slides, the amount of proven and unproven reserves are no longer emphasized as they once were. Is that not just as important as production numbers, acreage and Capex Spending? Maybe even more so!"
This is lagging the sector by far... Lousy performance today!!! Is Icahn still dumping shares?????
"There are a lot of people on the board doing all sorts of calculations of how OXY makes money when crude is over $35. Can't one of you explain why all 19 analyst who follow OXY say it is going to have negative EPS in Q3. Come on, somebody sharpen your pencil and chime in. I don't have the answer. Do you?"
In few months. Oil will start a huge run and few months later oxy will follow. Give it time for the economy to get better and for the oil price to gain back the high
"It's interesting who ya keep an eye on Crude and Brent but OXY keeps declining. The street hates OXY. The street warned, in fact empathically implored OXY not to make the overpriced deal with Anadarko. Until OXY can shed its debt it does not matter what the price of oil is. Bag holders. Plenty of opportunity away from OXY"
"OPEC and other oil producers, a group known as OPEC+, are considering rolling over production cuts into April instead of raising output as oil demand recovery remains fragile due to the coronavirus, three OPEC+ sources told Reuters."
"'Remember that deal between Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE:APC) back in May for $57 billion? Well, Carl Icahn doesn’t like it, so he’s moving to fire four board members of Occidental for voting for what he thinks is an overpriced purchase. Icahn has filed the paperwork necessary to vacate the positions of those four Occidental board members and replace them with his own executives. “The company’s current directors have made a number of mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition,” Icahn wrote in a filing. Occidental beat out Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which, at the time, was also pursuing Anadarko but folded at $48 billion, not willing to call. Occidental is getting a little nervous about Icahn’s maneuvering here, warning all its shareholder in ALL CAPS not to respond to any written requests from Icahn. Icahn’s rationale for opposing the deal is the volatility of oil prices. He’s been burned by oil before, most recently with his position in Chesapeake (NYSE:CHK) which is trading near all time lows. Icahn has a 4.4% stake in Occidental worth about $1.7 billion.'"

"ZACHS Just Said Buy MRO, Not OXY:Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.MRO currently has a forward P/E ratio of 20.57, while OXY has a forward P/E of 33.90. We also note that MRO has a PEG ratio of 2.65. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. OXY currently has a PEG ratio of 6.78.Another notable valuation metric for MRO is its P/B ratio of 0.62. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, OXY has a P/B of 1.13.These metrics, and several others, help MRO earn a Value grade of B, while OXY has been given a Value grade of C. MRO sticks out from OXY in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that MRO is the better option right now."
I sold at 53.27 at a 1800 loss. Thinking of getting back in. But I think if market turns negative this can go much lower. I’m thinking bp is a better buy at this moment until sentiment changes.
Capitulation before financial reporting in May. It happens every QTR
Getting cheap enough....starting a position again
First time I saw panic buying in OXY
this will be very good if this holds up green and doesn't dive after 3:30 at the close. been there done that
Hold for Oil Boom this summer OXY to $45-50
"Does anyone know the WTI per barrel cost which Oxy need to pay operating expenses, sustainability expenses, and interest payments? I see they mentioned the need of $2.9B sustainability expense at $40 WTI per barrel price, but I'm not sure if it included interest expenses too.I submitted email to Oxy's investor relations but haven't received any response. Do anyone know how long it takes to get response usually? Anyone has tried to compare the Suncor with Oxy as investment idea?"
"The biggest laggard in fuel consumption is airline fuel. Guess which demographic of the population is returning to airline bookings? Yup, the 72-93 year old. Who has the most money?

Airline fuel has been the largest laggard/anchor at the moment on oil consumption. When that fuel ramps up in consumption then the storage levels will drop dramatically. And all at a time that production is suppressed and Capex has been obliterated. $80 oil by end of summer and $100 eoy. Just.... Whoa!!!"
TODAY IS VERY BIG RED CRASH DAY FOR ALL OIL STOCKS. YOU HAVE TO SELL NIW AND BUY BACK AFTER CRASH
Does XOM report before of after the bell 4/21????

No one is selling now. Wow!
last chance to buy under $30!
Why am I getting that OXY earning report already if is due today after hours?
Institutions still hold 86.67%. For those who claim institutions are selling do your homework and stop the fake news. Here's a linkhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/OXY/holders?p=OXY
can we have a green day pretty please
"give it 2 years, this stock will jump back to 40s"
"OXY has confirmed that earnings will be announced Tuesday after the close. The consensus earnings are -$0.59, with a high and low of -$0.34 and -$0.86, respectively. My money is on their reporting a loss of -$0.30. You may think me crazy but we shall see about that on Tuesday night."
Have the asset sales continues this Qtr? I don’t recall seeing any in news feeds. Plus previous asset sales were stalled
I say 1 more downgrade and we hit $30. 2 more downgrades and we hit $40. 3 more downgrades and we hit $60. Next earnings will be huge
New support 25.9
" Great Stock!!!!!! Only a 5.9% decline, a tiny move. Don't worry it's at it pivot point.  up soon!!!!"
look at #$%$neg money flow - NO CONFIRMATION that selling is the way to go. Boolean
"Stock keeps bumping up against the 50 and 100 day moving averages at 16.42 and 16.58. If it can get through those levels and stay, on volume, I think it's headed to the $25 area. Just finished a nice basing pattern."
"Everyone expect a bad ER...no surprise on this. Doesnt change anything. HOLD. Patience is key, it will rise in few months"
Maybe the oil companies need to shut down unless government puts a floor on oil sales in U.S.to $40 or $45 to refiners... Foreign will have tariffs to make it $$45/50 as the business is vital toU.S security.
They had some interesting insights about OXY on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"It could be it went all the way down to 12.28 to cut all stop losses and start moving up. So far so good, let’s keep going!!"
"Profit taking in the last few sessions, we should be moving to break a new 52 weeks high in the coming week if oil price maintains the up stream."
"Price to book. CVX is at 1.0 OXY at 0.56. Now, tell me which is a bargain? https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/stock-update/occidental-petroleum-oxy-down-13-69-currently-trading-below-its-fair-value"
"EIA report summary: Oil imports increased by 1.1M for the week (160kx7 = 1.1M). Oil inventories decreased by 1.6M, which is only 13% above five year average. Excess inventories are certainly coming down.Gasoline inventories down 4M, and is only 1% above average. I am thinking we will start seeing gasoline inventories below historic average in just few short weeks. Distillates down 3.4M, which is 21% above historic average. Total inventories down by 7.5M. Gasoline demand down 9%, which is better than 10% down in previous weeks. Inventories are down 7.5M even with demand down 9-10%. With demand recovering, though slowly, gap can continue to to increase. Surely a bullish report in my opinion."
buy now before cruise lines begin sailing. This summer most people will be driving again and back to the office. take advantage and dont listen to people that are shorting here
OCCIDENTAL OIL IS GOING TO BANKRUPTCY. STOCK BROKER AND INVESTMENT BANK CONTROLLED OIL COMPANY IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE BANKRUPTCY WITH 41. 5 BILLION US DOLLARS DEBT. THE NEWS IS KEPT SECRET. BROKERS EMPLOY INTERNET TROLLS AND THEY LIE IN INTERNET FORUMS
Seems like replacing this ceo would help support the company through debt dealings and investors alike....
"Oil higher, beat it positive comments of future at earnings, JNJ gets approval letter this week, higher inflation. All huge positives for OXY and XOM."
instead of a tech sell off we get an energy sell off. interesting
any chance oxy would back track offer or cvx puts out offer?
Probably a merger with Xom or Chevron.
When OXY sold off this morning my only regret was not having more $$$ to buy more....In my opinion OXY will be a huge winner in 2019......Just look at the 5 year chart.....
one of the great things about this oil rally and my oxy position is it's allowing me to stay in my other positions that are taking a hit... working out nicely!
"Still Bullish here,Little consolidation to make the next step higher "
Finally a green day.
Not even hitting the debt and they averaged over $57 WTI and $61 Brent....Now i have to wait a day for them to explain their plan
Almost 3.00 off yesterdays high. WOW
Do you really think $32 and change is the high for OXY this year?!
Based on results the street is not happy with this conference call!!
it's interesting how hard the market makers are working to keep this below 25
"Homegamers.. After Exiting my Shell trade with a big loss this AM, and 'rolling it' into this OXY trade....I just figured my'Break Even' on the Rollover is $39.15 in my OXY position.. Not too bad. Just a lot of OXY risk for me.. IF they did announce any negative news on the Dividend (my biggest fear), think OXY would drop another 10Pct Immediately.... Anyway, I was ableto take a big tax loss (which I needed) on my Shell trade. With the big dividend coming next week that I won't have to count as2019 income, that's a plus. Long 25,700 shares OXY at 37.824. If OXY is less than that at the end of the year, I'll sell it to enhance my tax loss. If not, I'll just hold it, roll the dice and pray OIL stays up. OXY is the 1 Major oil that MUST Have high Oil prices, therein also lies more of that 'risk'......"

"so many factors bro effects stock. Today Saudi Arabia raised oil pricing for customers in its main market of Asia after optimism over Coronavirus vaccines caused crude price to rise to an 8 months hight last week. the increase, the biggest in five months, indicates the world's largest oil exporter is confident global Entergy demand is strong enough to absorb a smaĺl boost in output from OPEC +members next month and that markets will remain tight even with parts of US and Europe in lockdown."
Interesting post below..So Calr Icahn has an average buy cost of about 15-16 and just kept buying ...SO BEING THAT HE SPEND THE YEAR ALL OVER THIS AND PROBABLY SPOKE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS FOR MONTHS....do you think that there is a chance that he Has a plan
"just for the record.... Warren Buffett got 10 billion $ of preferred stock @ 8 % which he still has in his portfolio. he also bought common stock...close to 18 million shares at different times, which he divested. Mr. Buffett is still an investor....and his 10 billion$ investment helped seal the poorly timed Andarko deal. IMHO...none of his investment strategy matter now...what matters is whether oil will go up over time, and if yes, will oxy make money. that is something time will tell"

For the love of oil @W please don’t start your whining about Oxy today.
I think i going to buy more on pre markt today
Unbelievable- some of you purported longs still don’t get it - this is headed lower . Who would buy at $62-$61-$60-$59-$58 and keep adding as the stock becomes a falling knife .Chevron will most likely walk .I purchased puts to cover my shares so I’m holding my own . OXY isn’t done falling . Will set and break the 52 week LOW upon winning the bidding .
This will still continue to raise slowly because oil cost is raising. Don't do a panic move! Think twice!
Jesus christ wti is exploding up 3%.
My entry point for this will be at 26-26.5
The whole oil sector is selling off a day before earnings. We are seeing a repositioning in oil stocks. Either we will see a reversal today or tomorrow. Earnings will drive all future results.
"Assuming Oil doesn't collapse, there probably isn't much more significant downside for OXY. Uncle Warren will likely continue to add to his position, and the constant pressure from Carl will force management to run a tight ship. I will be surprised if the stock drops below 30 in the upcoming year."
OPEC and its oil producing allies on Sunday finalized a historic agreement to cut production by 9.7 million barrels per day
"OXY is one of the best suited companies to weather low oil prices. They have a strong balance sheet, and their cost cutting strategies have positioned them well above their competition. Not to mention that they have high exposure to the Permian Basin. Expect this to be a steady winner the next 5+ years. For the short term, I am a little uncertain regarding oil prices. Cuts from OPEC producing countries, namely Saudi Arabia, and expected cuts in March should help sustain WTI oil prices around the mid $55 range. Uncertainty with China and the potential of a full scale trade war would cause the dollar to strengthen against foreign currencies, which would hurt oil prices. Despite this, I think OXY will post strong earnings and likely beat. Looking forward to it. Interested to hear other thoughts/opinions."
WTI near $66/barrel and OXY trading like it’s a bankruptcy company. Last March it was $45 - $50 per share. With WTI $66 it still can’t catch up pre Covid-19 level price.
But they are still losing $$$$$$$$$$$$$

Once again when you have the largest brokerage houses bet the wrong way for months and months and the line in sand has arrived ...every single ethical and unethical maneuver will be deployed to save their.....if you believe in the oil recovery and much more upside either hang tough....or go shopping for long term options
Close low 31 probably and monday gap up on stimulus passing.
It is the height of corporate irony that Occidental is soliciting the same shareholders it snubbed on an enormous acquisition to vote against Carl Icahn’s proposals to sweep up the BOD .
"From Barrons: ( My note: At one time Warren thought $62 was a good price for OXY ?)It's no secret that Buffett likes Occidental, given his role in the company's purchase of oil explorer Anadarko Petroleum earlier this year. With Occidental competing with Chevron (CVX) to buy Anadarko, Berkshire bought $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock paying an 8% dividend, and received warrants to buy up to 80 million shares of Occidental stock for $62.50 a share.Its decision to add more equity exposure in the latest quarter indicates that Berkshire remains committed to the company even as Wall Street has backed away. Occidental shares are trading at under $40 -- down 35% since first announcing its Anadarko bid -- as investors fret about its debt load, and about energy stocks in general."
"Greenmail, Remember what he did to Texaco and Pennzoil. Also wrecked the Sandridge acquisition of Bonanza Creek Energy, now is in O&G are saying SD should have proceeded with the Bonanza Creek Energy, OXY is right, Icahn’s proposed Board members all neither have the skills and experience to effectively process this APC acquisition and increase long term synergies and increase shareholder value. This should be the concern of shareholders going forward, in managing the company and reject Icahn. He does have some points though and agree but this is very bad timing for his involvement in managing the company going forward."
We might see $20 today at this pace. What do you think guys? Let's go OXY!
all this cash in hand why not pay down debt !?
Watch the funds swoop in now
"If hope the OXY WS trade at around $1.00-@2.00. I am a buyer. But I guess that they will open much higher because of the 7 years of time premium, the pent up demand from those that sold OXY options before the announcement of the OXY WS, and because it is very cheap insurance for those that short the stock."
"Ok, we have retested. Once we are past holidays, watch out 40’s!!!! Patience!!!!"
"WTI now $65.22 and this below $25.00/share, what is wrong with this picture!!!!"
As far as the dividend debate goes... I pointed out that Oxy was able to pay 7% dividend POST acqusition and the management team at the time said their dividend was safe because they had collar hedge. Now sth unexpected happened and wti went negative last year and we had to get rid of the dividend. Do I think they can reinstate dividend back to 3 to 5% absolutely. They have debt problem however they can still get rid of the African and non core assets which should amount to at least 10 billion dollars. This would leave them at 23 bil debt plus 10 bil Warren's PS. They should have 8 bil from fcf until the end of next year. That brings debt to 15 bil + 10 bil PS. It is not fantastic but that should definitely bring their stock price back up to 40 dollars EASY. They have the best rock and assets at Permean.
"Tomorrow will be interesting day with options expiring, think the OPEC move is strong and it will be hard to push this lower"
"What happened to all the cash saved by cutting CAPEX, guess they don't make it to spend it anyways.Just add it to the $ billions of shares issued that was used on the buyout. That being the case OXYis probably over valued now in this market. issuing shares to pay debt is a desperation act, they'll savethe cash for the bloated salaries and bonuses."
I hope that oil price recover significantly by next year. Oxy skyrockets. Oxy finances $10 billion debt at less than 5% and pay off WB's preferred dividend next year. WB deserves this for dumping all of his shares and gave us 3 months of pain on the share price depreciation!
I’m not betting against a sell-off. I’m out for now!
This has got to be up at least a dollar today!

Wow... Oxy is showing its strength and long term value stock! for who recognize it!
At least now Icahn can't dump any more stock! Has to file with the SEC first. Maybe OXY will hold it's gains. The market has to get it sooner or later that oil above $63.00 barrel OXY is making lots of FCF.
OIL WENT TO 28 BUCKS A BARREL IN 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS = OXY AT 12.

I saw Oxy drop to 1% up and I thought that should trigger @W
if the warrants are going to be priced around $11 like some posters here if said then this goes a long way towards replacing the dividend that has been removed. you can bet that Uncle icon and Uncle Buffy are thrilled with this warrant situation.....
"***** Don't forget THIS. ..........OXY-fans...... the US dollar has been falling for the last 6 weeks or more against most foreign currencies..,.. end of the dozen of international monetary analysts that I follow--_ the dollar is expected to continue falling back in value for the next 6 months at least..... and it's no surprise to anyone who understands how many TRILLIONS. of Fiat money our government has printed over the last 20 years or more.......we have the power in the economy this is staying ourselves with this debt and dilution of our currency..... but time is running out and that's why the dollar is dropping and is a friend 2 those of us who invest in oil related investments..... let's not forget that oil is traded in US dollars around the world....... so the more that the dollar drops in value..... the higher in price will be the cost of crude oil and thereby the higher the price of oil stocks.*****deepsub"
buy all your can at market open. the drop will be short lived
Disaster!!

"Thought I would set up an arguement that is Macro to our narrative. Article is 2 months old but is timeless in understanding where Saudi Oil's impact, both short term and long term, stands. Conclusion: There is NO WAY I would invest in Saudi Aramco....EVER. No way to trust them in the long term."
"According to Yahoo, OXY will have negative growth for the next 5 years. Does anyone have a differing opinion. Thank you."
"Matthew Portillo, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co., a Houston investment bank. ""Now Chevron can go and look at other assets. The chessboard for M&A activity is now completely reset."" For Occidental, he added, acquiring Anadarko makes the company more competitive with Chevron and Exxon as they roll out significant expansions in the Permian Basin. Chevron is now the leading producer in the region, but a combined Occidental-Anadarko would emerge as the top operator postdeal.""That's the door they've been able to open,"" Mr. Portillo said."
1 million dollar in oxy in total.
OXY doesn’t have $40 Billion in debt and isn’t filling Bankruptcy 
"Ridicolous ....oil at 41 usd and oxy agre price down at 17 Usd...a big manipulation , no explanation for that.Oxy should be at 30 usd or more.... with its 10 usd hedge oxy is very profitable and with its cutting in expenditures And dividends the Cashflow is MASSIVLY positiv. The debts payback should be no issue with the refinancing lastbweek and the positive Cashflow and we will see, -what will happen on asset sale front. The bids for the lands should be at 1 billion usd and asset sale in Oman and Africa also will happen soon. This is under. Ormolu circumstances a 50-60 USD stock, cannot follow the actual pricing. The same is for Devon, EOG, Pdce and noble energy. I guess we need some patience."
"If OXY drops down below $10 then I will worry. Right now, I will monitor and buy when it starts to turn around. Too many scare crows in the corn fields. Coronavirus is a fluke and when it's gone, stock market will rise again."
"1.14 boe/day, 2.9 billion cap budget maintained"
Let’s pray for $25 OXY and 70$ crude by summer.....
lets simplify...they just reported last month that they had the greatest amount of free cash flow in many years...since that quarter natural gas has doubled and I think that their realized crude price was about 39 and oil is up 6$-8 per barrel.....hedge still in the current quarter and cap ex the same... and they will have about 3 billion in cash to pay a small amount of debt ..not hard to see if things hold free cash flow should be very very impressive
Happy Friday longs!
MKM gives target 32 with buy rating.
i dont get why no one is writing in the news about how EIA numbers beat on all counts

New OXY shareholders (ex-Anadarko ) will have their new shares in account tomorrow . Think they’ll hold em or fold em ?
Anyone else concerned that July oil contracts expire on the 19th?!
as always wallstreet sentiment is more about the next quarter than the current...so any impact from the freeze will be ignored ..how many times does a company obliterate earning and then guides lower and the stock suffers..without the freeze free cash flow should be up about 1 billion more than last qs record free cash flow based on crude prices and the current quarter could be up an additional 750 million - 1billion more than that if prices hold ...all in all by the end of the current quarter..due in july free cash flow could be 2-2.5 billion ...however drilling will resume at a CALCULATED MANAGED PACE...they already reconfirmed many times their cap ex..basically half of 2019...so if this plays out the stock should response well from hereeven with another 500 million thrown in capex..they could still achieve 2billion of free cash flow per quarter with the lower cap ex number promised and no dividend
"The last chance to buy oil stocks before these take off to the next level, which is the Pre-Covid price. Once we get to this level, you hold them if you believe there will be huge bubble with inflation, lack of supply, higher demand, etc. But for the last 2x gain, now is the time!"
JAN 12TH OPEC IS MAKING EVEN DEEPER CUTS THAN PLANNED....this is great news
"""Europe’s Troubled Covid-19 Vaccine Rollout Turns the Corner"". Wall street Journal article from yesterday. Just another catalyst to add to the perfect storm for oil's bullish summer. I will not be surprised is oil hits 100 in September......"
"I don't know who is selling today but if it is going down with such a good price, it is matter of concern. Next month Oil price may go down due to OPEC production increase. This is huge manipulation going on as of now. This stock has 2 more weeks to go high before OPEC plus next meeting."
I believe XOM and CVX become interested buyers around 32.50/share. Market cap would be just above book value. Total price including 40B of debt would be about 65B

"Posting this again because so many people have the facts wrong on Carl Icahn. A Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday showed that on April 5, Icahn sold 7.0 million Occidental shares in the open market at a weighted average price of $25.65, valuing the shares sold at $179.6 million. After the sales, Icahn indirectly owned 73.63 million Occidental shares, representing 7.9% of the shares outstanding as of Jan. 31, which would make him the company's third largest"
just wait 12 more days. oxy will go higher and higher.
"Xom announced huge production cuts..larger than expected...Opec cuts thursday ill be massive..as posted last week many countries joining in Norway, Brazil , Canada....they need to plug sixty -75 days of low demand or about 3-4 billion barrel surplus...15% will do it ..and countries who are net buyers will probably fill their strategic reserves which could remove another billion barrels"

"Whoever sold yesterday at a loss must feel shame on not knowing in this super big cycle for gasoline. The worst has passed, that's why it's a positive news for OXY. The stock market likes to test/ challenge who are the traders and investors. Traders usually lose money for panic selling, but investors know what they're buying and why they should hold onto it for the biggest profit. We're buying the future, not the past."
France locking down the country for a month. Not good for oil. We need OPEC'S production cuts.
Market makers stacking up the ask to push the price down. If huge buy volume comes in they will get pushed aside!
and 6 million acres in Oman
I think they’re keeping a lid on guidance. Guessing they want a beat on every quarter now
"oil companies blowing away earnings estimates this quarter. no reason why oxy doesn't follow the trend. i'm a gambling man. oxy is back in the black this quarter, .01$/share prediction"
This quarter ending march 31 ..analysts are projecting a loss of 36cents....with oil at these levels that is not even close to the right projections...of they had 1.4 billion in free cash flow when wti is 40 they will be close to 3 billion in free cash flow at these levels
back to $24 and change.... that seems to be the floor with oil above $60.. heaven forbid oil drops into the 50s
It appears that a tremendous amount of Carl Icahns 18 billion is tied up in OXY and continues to grow...and he has not wavered in Cheniere either...hi staff has to be all over this ensuring the right decisions are being made
Premarket seems to be digesting the earnings report more positively
"Buying OXY just because Icahn has been buying it might be a big mistake. Think about Hertz. Icahn, Buffet and generally nobody can be always right.One of oil industry's main problems currently is the big uncertainty. Is Covid-19 going to stay for weeks, months or year? Or maybe for much longer (like HIV)? What does that mean for the demand for example next year, given that many international companies are insolvent and others have been cutting costs. At least business travel might go down and people who lost their jobs might not be able to fly, at least not so often as before.On the other hand we have historical production cuts and currently relatively low oil prices. This might for example affect or shift sales of (mostly expensive) electric vehicles and have positive long term effect on oil industry.Oil price is only one variable in the equation. Another important variable is quantity. Best case is highest oil price at max. production capacity and this might be one of the biggest uncertainties of OXY (Although first variable is affected by demand anyway). Large debt remains probably biggest pain in the neck. However, industry's recovery might make selling some of OXY's assets more probable."
Don’t see any comments from Matt. Looks he cashed out. LOL….
Getting ready for the next lil boom!!
OIL flirted with $65 and did a projectile vahmet forthwith. Now its on its journey to low $60's toot sweet. Please hurry. I want Warrants at $12.50 thank you
Why is this backing down ?
OXY has been taken out of S&P100 index due to bankruptcy considerations its in. OXY has been named worst performing stock in S&P500 list. OXY has 40 billion USD debt and OXY share value combined is 13 billion USD. Buffett exited from OXY shares in April 2020. These are the facts
THERE ARE OVER 150 BROKERAGE EMPLOYED INTERNET AUTHORS HERE. THEY POST TO CALM YOU WHILE OXY STOCK PRICE DECLINES. THATA THE TRAP THEY HAVE. WE ARE IN PROFITS AGAIN TODAY. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THESE TROLS MAKING PROFIT? WHY DO THEY CONSTRUCT THEORIES TO MAKE YOU HOLD MORE OXY STOCK?
"From schedule 2 - Oil collars MTM - Q1 = $952M Q2 = $5M... Stefan ,where is the $10 hedge per barrel your have been touting?"
I sold all my Occidental shares at 31 US dollars. I read that Occidental Oil stocks are price fixed at 31.5 US Dollars. I will await for 15 US Dollars Occidental Price in a few weeks. If you see alot of Buy on this page you should know ITS TIME TO SELL
We don't know for sure but I assume Icahn is selling his position. When that is done the pressure comes off the stock price and it will reflect the paydown of debt and strategy execution. It will be a little choppy but the potential is pretty good.
"OXY up 15%. hurray. sorry shorts, just not your day today!"
so who is selling? your weak hands just sold to the hedge funds. well done
The BIG guys are so greedy!! Still squeezing the last bit. The weaker hands will be gone.
OXY is fine. Nothing goes up in a straight line. Weak hands in panic mode. Unless you are a day trader you should look at the bigger picture. Ton of bullish news for oil. We have a vaccine and the country back to normal in spring. 100% confident OPEC+ will extend cuts for 3 months. Traders do not seem to realize that OPEC countries are broke and need the money. SA needs oil at $70 to balance its budget. Russia going broke. Relax and let OXY ride. 2021 will be huge. WTI at $60 and OXY easily at $30
Picked up another thousand shares from Celine short selling. Funny she is not posting today!
"I who was one of the short -term-tax-loss sellers in OXY to offset short-term tax-gains back in October have recovered my position last Thursday at what I think is a bargain and the nick of time. I am happy and extremely bullish. Sooner than later people are going to realize that, for now and the medium-term future, oil will continue to be the irreplaceable and most cost effective source of energy that fuels the world's economy."
How high will this go today. The stars are all lined up today
Any news on Parsley/Pioneer Merger or Takeover? Pricing?
If you wait to buy OXY on dips....you will own ZERO shares. Boolean
"Still look for OPEC+ to start to increase production in January or February with a small amount each coming month , cheating now by 750,000 per day plus some countries have no limit on their production now . OPEC+ wants higher prices but they want more production more now ,it helps keeps US drilling at a lower rig count and OPEC+ is pumping at only 70-80% right now . If they do the increase overtime the effect on oil price should be minimal maybe -2.00 or less , OXY in the 13-16.00 range for awhile . Would like to see the cuts now extended at least thru March but don't think that will happen unless virus explodes before they raise production. Just don't want to see no deal by OPEC+ which would crash oil!"
"Devon reported realized oil price of $38.21 for Q3. They even generated $427M of positive cash flow. Net loss of only 4 cents/share. If OXY got similar realized oil prices in Q3, we are looking at positive earning surprise, and likely positive FCF. BTW, OXY reports on Nov 9th."
"We REALLY Need To HOLD HERE......38.47 Last.....Past Times, We've Gotten A Quick Bounce..... 'AVERAGE' Volume Day. ICHAN Not Selling Here..We Need a DOUBLE Bottom Here........ Crude Has Turned Negative On The Day...."
20 coming
The story is quite clear. WTI cant get out of its own way because there is nowhere to store the Oil. The pumping is grinding slower but not slow enough to stem off the max holding capacity. Its going to collide unless production slows even more. That's why you have negative Oil. Brent on the other hand is UP $.04. OXY Phuked today but steadily came back. Its been doing this for a few days now. Its looking like OXY has found a bottom. June should be a steady climb on Oil and should see production start to look like consumption. If we see a balance like that???? OXY $20-$25 and climbing.
got in at end of jan when it hit 20
"997,164 share @$ 27.05 4:00:01 print on level II. Who bought that block?????"
Is Oxy going to stay around $25 .....geez wti is heading for $70....what gives?
I was right again. loaded up at open
I exercised some of my calls on Friday. holding 9000 more shares than last week
OXY CVX are doing well in summer months and this is the fact!
oxy share price was between 28-32 when oil was at these levels in feb ...dividend and more capex in and no asset sales ....
There are so many nasdaq stocks that are so far overvalued....100-300 pes ...as stated when oil was zero...WHERE ARE AND HAVE fund managers moved to get the gains that they need for their returns and bonuses ..if though oxy has moved... 40% on this is only 43$ per share....apa ...40% is 30...bp ..36 etcIf the best names on the nasdaq...apple has 16 billion shares outstanding now APPLE would have to move 768 BILLION IN MARKET CAP for a 40% move ...
Cut Vicki's Salary to 1ct a quarter thats whats she is worth.

WB buying - even a small stake -is a positive however he is NOT a bottom timer .
"Anyone come away with the feeling our leader did not write her presentation? She seemed to stumble over simple points like the billions in place of millions for the sale of a property. Lastly, I wonder if they have an agreement with the ANALysts to not sandbag with a question.

"It is normal for investors to rebalance their portfolio. If a certain % is the limit for energy sector for Ichan, it is normal for him to dispose OXY for him to allocate that fund to elsewhere. The downtrend in OXY and the oil sector is primarily due to the COVID restrictions imposed globally, expecting the demand to be suppressed. The more they suppress, the more this will be explosive once the restrictions are lifted. At this point, the only thing that can prevent OXY from rising is the COVID. Once this is gone, we will be celebrating at the pre-COVID price level. All these downtrend will be viewed as volatility at a low level like we have been experiencing in low $10s last year. You need to be patient. Even though I also do not like Ichan's move.... I owe him a lot when he backed up the OXY warrant price at ~$3. I picked up 100k+ OXY warrants at $2.6-3 and became a millionaire last December. I have been holding them firmly and will continue to hold and add more until these COVID restrictions are gone. Long OXY and God bless OXY shareholders~!"
***** crude is now only down about $0.20 a barrel...... has come back quite a bit in the last hour..... starting to look like we may have an afternoon rally after that BS move this morning!*****deepsub
I'm only investing in oxy for chemicals and carbon capture.
Blackrock founder just stated that oil will be 65 and yet the market will correct 20%.. he said energy would be the best performing sector .not hard to figure out where money will go if that comes true...OXY would have billions per quarter in free cash flow.. they have 7 trillion under management..just confirm what some of us already knew
On 5/12 Oxy hit an RSI around 60 and sold off. Yesterday Oxy hit RSI 55 and sold off. The RSI was around 32 when drop $22 and change.
"Vicki Hollub, CEO"
Will be happy to see it closing above $18 but don’t know why I feel that it will close between $17.5 - $17.75 today. Have been seeing similar pattern in daily basis.
"Tired of Snake Pelosi sneaking in the bailout package in the stimulus. I hate that this stimulus may get deferred after the re-election, but having this done under Trump will be much more beneficial for the economy. People don't realize that the stimulus back in 2008/2009 were used to buy garbage CMOs sitting in major banks' balance sheet. These funds were held within the banks, and regulated, so that limited fund could flow into the market. However the COVID stimulus is a different monster. A lot of the stimulus funds are paid to individuals/corps/organization, which means these additional funds are injected DIRECTLY into the market. The short-term impact should be positive, but I don't think anyone can measure what would be the long-term impact. This could cause some serious inflation -- one of my reasons why I am bullish on oil..."
Either way this is going to hit its resistance of 28 this week
"A $50 million signing fee for Buffett, whether or not the deal goes through. How generous of the Board with shareholder money!"

Volume is only 6 million and this had gone up 7 percent.
Consensus target are at 49 and that was probably figuring in oil in the mid 50s or lower...
OXY now trading at a 9-year low. Thanks Warren Buffet. Thanks Vicki Hollub. Nice way to destroy shareholder value.
"Everyone should have known this past quarter was bad. Most reported bad earnings for 4th Q. This quarter and going forward all that matters. This should tend up all day tomorrow, and jump after the call. Oil going higher, this is going higher."

"Does anyone know what is the % of the fracking done on federal land by Oxy? As long as this is nominal, all small oil producers will permanently be gone from the market because of Biden's ban proposal, and the reduction of domestic oil production will increase the oil price even more with the current production situation once the COVID is gone."

"Doesnt it feel like we are at an inflexion point? $13 handle? Oil is sustaining its highest level in 4 months. OXY has posted the ugliest of numbers, for last quarter, with FCF on deck for this quarter. Production is suppressed and reality of under Capex in the industry is going to be quite relevant and soon. IMO, end of year is going to have a substantial bullish narrative build. The pain is coming next spring/summer. By then, C19 will have taken its toll and the world will have moved on. SA and Russia will have learned their lesson, until next time, and production will be sharply lower than consumption. I see a real path to $80 oil next year. Thats $40+ million fcf per day for OXY. Or $3.6 billion per quarter. Thats based on divesting 400,000bd assets. We shall see. But, I believe this is a minimum case scenario. $80 might be way to low"

Wake me up in a couple weeks when this is back to 20. Then we can all think about filling that gap from March.
Have to wait for cc...last quarter they lost slightly more from an eps standpoint yet had record free cash flow of 1.4 billion... in addition missing but have a record quarter on tap is better than beating and guiding lower....tomorrow will sort out everything...at 20$ per barrel more for this quarter at their run rates is close to 2 billion more in free cash flow

Great EIA inventory report......again. -1.6 oil and -3.3 gasoline draws
"I saw a lot shorts posted recently days but not today!!! where the h*""'! are they ??"
"OXY is expected to win and price would drop to $55 since last Monday. Any short term investor should sell their shares in last couple days. For long term investors, this is a golden opportunity for OXY to expand and share price will go up in the long term."
BP up over $1 a share today . OXY - not so much . Why the difference ?Expectations . With its massive debt load & cuts to CAPEX Vickys $100 million dollar oil titan has become beholden to its debt holders and NOT its shareholders .
"At this rate and with crude over 60, In 4 years they will be debt free!"
perfect....wipe out weak hands and prepare for strong results after the close...sellers now will feel bad after the close...not sure their reasons when the sector is HOT. But Humans....can't figure them out sometimes. Boolean
CDC basically fundamentally change the game I believe. I think by the end of June/July we could potentially see oil price of $75. I think Oxy which is undervalued by about 50% when compared to peers has huge uncertainty as to how high it can go. The assets they have acquired are going to worth a lot more if this trend continues.
this opens and finishes green tomorrow guaranteed.
EIA inventories oil -7.990M barrels
Economic otimism and the official end of the pandemic will bring oxy to $45+ It could be over $60 by 2022. Oxy debt is not a issue with the current crude price and demmand is ramping up around the globe. WTI could hit $70 by year end.
Thank you for the jobs report. People were fearing the worst
I’m in . Can barely believe it myself .
Upcoming dividend in June. while not as much as the last payout one can expect many not bearing to hold on much longer after getting the divy

"I have no doubt OXY will be over $40 in the future. Question is when demand is going to pick up. My anticipation is end of 2021 towards mid 2022, which means you need to hold at least 18 months. Let's wait and see."
"Done deal. Now OXY becomes a core holding for me, yielding over 5%. I just stick stocks like this away and hold for the longer term. I have amassed a very large portfolio doing this, but it's over a long period."
Could not be more obvious that opec will take actions as soon as oil starts approaching 50 so for OXY this is like a godfather watching out for them ...they can pay all bills and the dividend at 40 so at 0 that should leave an additional 5-5.5 billion in extra income. Russia is only waiting because they apparently dont want just cut and the virus issue subsides and oil goes up with no cut...bottom line the day has arrived that the cartel will put a floor in and for oxy that has one of the lowest barrel costs this is great news

"The oil is stuck at the current level primarily due to COVID 19, Job data and some other economic data. All of these will be improved soon. The oil supply is shrinking every week and with this pace, the oil supply will be within 5 year moving average in 2-3 months based on EIA reports. So, by 2-3 months, the oil will be back above ~$50 and all oil stocks will start flying in late this year."
Seems $25.71 is a good price to pay today.
pre covid we were at $42

"That’s the gamechanger.....That will boost oxy stock price to another level up.The Federal Reserve revamped its Main Street Lending Program in ways that will allow battered oil companies to qualify for the aid after industry allies lobbied the Trump administration for changes.Larger, more heavily indebted companies can now qualify and use the money to pay off prior loans under the changes the central bank announced Thursday.The move opens the door to more oil and gas producers, said Senator Kevin Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, who had pressed the administration on the issue as energy companies struggle to survive an epic collapse in fuel demand and crude prices.“With the decrease in demand and oversupply due to the global oil price war creating a valley for these highly leveraged companies, this expansion will help them bridge the gap as we look to reopen America,” Cramer said in an emailed statement Thursday.Environmentalists blasted the shifts they said rewarded oil companies that took on too much debt and were overproducing crude even before the coronavirus pandemic caused demand to plunge.“These changes directly reflect demands from polluters and their favorite members of Congress,” said Lukas Ross with the environmental group Friends of the Earth. “Long before the coronavirus, the drillers were in deep trouble. Now frackers want to pay back their debts with our money. Trump’s big oil bailout must be stopped.”For weeks, oil industry advocates have warned the original program structure would prevent beleaguered drillers from accessing capital under the program.Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, and the Independent Petroleum Association of America argued oil companies needed more flexibility to use Main Street loans to repay existing debt -- something that was previously off limits but will now be allowed under some conditions.Maximum loan totals under the Main Street program are also being hiked to $200 million -- from an earlier $150 million cap viewed as too low to help oil producers.“Great news out of the Fed today in support of struggling U.S. energy companies,” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a tweet Thursday. He added that he would “continue” his work with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to provide “other relief” to the industry.The Fed said the changes were not targeted to the oil and gas industry or any industry in particular but followed additional research into what slice of U.S. companies don’t have ready access to capital markets.Nevertheless, the new terms are likely to open it up to a wider group of energy firms, and overseers worried the Fed was bending to pressure.“The major changes announced today mirror the top requests of the oil and gas industry,” said Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the congressional panel appointed to scrutinize implementation of the Fed’s and part of the Treasury’s virus-relief programs.“That raises questions about how the changes promote the broader public interest -- especially when these companies will still have no real obligation to retain or rehire their workers,” Ramamurti said on Twitter.Credit RatingsEven before the changes, oil and gas companies with investment-grade credit ratings could secure funding through a separate program, the Fed’s Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities.However, under term sheets released April 9, funding was restricted to firms that had credit ratings of at least BBB-/Baa3 as of March 22 -- a cutoff date that could come too late for some oil producers, such as Occidental Petroleum Corp., which had its debt cut to junk by Moody’s on March 18, with Fitch and S&P following on March 20 and March 25, respectively.Republicans have argued that funding should be available to oil companies with credit ratings that slipped amid the coronavirus pandemic and a surge in crude unleashed by a Russia-Saudi Arabia battle for market share.On Thursday, the Fed said lenders now will be able to apply their “industry-specific expertise and underwriting standards to best measure a borrower’s income.”Highly leveraged companies also can take advantage of a new, third loan option that comes with increased risk sharing by lenders.It was not clear Thursday whether the changes would allow Occidental to qualify for aid -- or whether potentially newly eligible oil companies would seek it. Occidental declined to comment on the matter."
Oxy will pop to 15 before the end of the week. Easy investment here.
Watch this end at 25/25.01 as I mentioned earlier. Then you guys will know that I am not talking bs about manipulation

"As much as you guys want to blame CEO and board, the share price is a reflection of oil price. Carnage was going to happen with or without Anadarko aquisition. Yes debt plays a big role but this drop in price has more do do with virus and price of oil at the moment."

"The problem w/ OXY is you don't know about the how it is viewed by competitors. It can double up in a buyout or it could go belly up under the strain of chronic low oil prices. Here's the second problem you have as an investor: Either way by the time you find out the money has been made by those that have the inside track. Most small investors w/ no advanced info will lose because their in at $30, $50 or more. It is stocks like OXY that make the market a casino, and so-called investors gamblers. Why do you think the most insiders on Wall Street are so rich and the 80% of the people on Main street are poor. The virus looks like it will make the rich richer and the poor, poorer. But don't lose faith God loves the Poor, that's why he made so many of them."

Until the earnings announcement I doubt that OXY will trade above $26.50 as most analysts that follow the stock seem to be from Missouri if you get my drift."

"API to endorse carbon pricing. This will feed right into what OXY is doing. From the WSJ, I won't post the link as you need to subscribe but here is the first part>>>>>""""WASHINGTON—The oil industry’s top lobbying group is preparing to endorse setting a price on carbon emissions in what would be the strongest signal yet that oil and gas producers are ready to accept government efforts to confront climate change.The American Petroleum Institute, one of the most powerful trade associations in Washington, is poised to embrace putting a price on carbon emissions as a policy that would “lead to the most economic paths to achieve the ambitions of the Paris Agreement,” according to a draft statement reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.“API supports economy-wide carbon pricing as the primary government climate policy instrument to reduce CO2 emissions while helping keep energy affordable, instead of mandates or prescriptive regulatory action,” the draft statement says.API’s executive committee was slated to discuss the proposed statement this week. In a statement to the Journal, API’s senior vice president of communications, Megan Bloomgren, said the group’s efforts “are focused on supporting a new U.S. contribution to the global Paris agreement.”Carbon pricing aims to discourage the production of harmful greenhouse gases by setting a price on emissions. The API draft statement would endorse the concept in principle, without backing a specific pricing scheme such as a carbon tax.An endorsement of carbon pricing by the oil industry’s most important trade group would underscore the changing politics of climate change, as major business groups acknowledge the dangers posed by greenhouse gases and adjust to a new reality in Washington. Another major business group, the Business Roundtable, endorsed carbon pricing last year."""""

the fact that oil is staying firmly above 60 makes this plunge much much more tolerable.... it's might be a rough 2 to 3 weeks. Get your pepto bismal ready
"We're higher in oil pricing than 1 year ago and climbing. Oxy pricing was mid $40's. When the hedges start piling in, they already have, then it will run up. If oil is stable at $60 in 3 months, we are $30 minimum. Investors mood is much more cautious going up. But if we are $65 oil? $70 or even $80 this summer, OXY will be $60-$80. All of a sudden these noncore assets will become accretive to the cash flow by nature. Vicki won't sell them. But we got to get to $80 and higher for that to happen. Thats a potential 9 bagger from todays Warrant pricing. Adding to warrants is my current business/retirement model."

wow CNBC analyst advised to buy oxy
I got out at $38. Got out too soon but very concerned about the debt and possible dividend cut. That happened to me with Connoco. Their CEO swore there would not be a dividend cut a few days before the cut. Good luck to everyone and Happy New Year.
"OXY employs 850+ INTERNET STOCK PROMOTERS TO DISGUISE THAT OXY IS BANKRUPT WITH 39 BILLION USD DEBT. OXY STOCK CRASH STARTED, TARGET TO REACH 10 USD SHARE PRICE IN 3 WEEKS"
"congraduation to all , for the first time OXY is stand above $30 and safe. From $9 to $30, it is difficult, bumpimg path, and we go through it and feel safe now. Looking ahead, it is brighter , Within 2-3 years OXY will come out a bigger and stronger Cash generating company, perhaps just next to CHV and XOM, OXY stock price will surpass $100 and pay decent divident. So hold OXY and enjoy the journey."
"Short term this looks pretty nasty, and the debt is quite substantial for declining oil prices. What is the bull case for this investment, yield with the hopes of a recovery in oil? Also, from what I read the acquisition was not well received, any contrarian comments on that? Much appreciated"
I have never been this bullish for oxy stock in my life since nov of last year where it really took off. Goldman Sach and several hedge fund managers who have predicted correctly so far about the market is pointing at July for massive summer rally. Raymond James target price of 45. Bank of America target price of 40. 4 other banks at 31. FCF of this year should be about 5 bil for this company at wti 60. 2 bil cash. 2-3 bil divestment this year. That is total of 9 billion dolllars. The company can take out almost quarter of its debt this year alone. I advise people to switch from the stock to warrant as the price gets lower. That is the only way you will x2 your money. June/july will be when all european countries will likey come out from lockdown and the u.s. will be fully vaccinated. Btw astrazeneca just repored based on phase 3 study including 30 000+ people that it prevents hospitalization and severe disease 100 percent.

Everybody gets a pass this quarter...OIL WAS ZERO REMEMBER...their volumes stayed strong so with 125 million barrels per quarter and oil 42$ a barrel more and billions of cut capex and dividend this should set up nicely going forward
Boom boommmm
As long as oil stays above $40 we are on the path to recovery. Which means OXY can reach 20 comfortably in the next few months.

"A seeking Alpha article just released 2 days ago is predicting a meaningful rise in dividend coming within 1/2 quarters. I just don't see it. Would love to be wrong and would enjoy my paper profits, but its not how I read this accounting sheet thats coming.IMO, the $37 Billion in net debt is so large and such an overhang that the company is forced to attack the tranches. The discipline with Capex in regards to production output gives it away from my prospective. The second reason is that does anyone care about a dividend omission for the next quarter or two with such a high debt? In other words, the dividend payments have already been obliterated. We all have already accepted no dividend for our portfolio. This has now turned into a growth stock and a survival narrative. The rise back to increased volume is the story. And that story has not begun,...... yet. To be sure, IMO, we can wring our hands with when all these metrics will be applied. But the overall story will be the same. In 12-15 months, OXY will have divested the assets they so choose. OXY, under current and rising pricing, will have eliminated ~$10 Billion+ in debt. The key is debt in the low $20's. OXY has made mention of a debt target in the low $20's. I will take them at their word. Now, that doesn't mean that a dividend raise isn't out of the equation along the way. Inching up ever so slightly. But, I believe one could conclude that the main focus is debt destruction at this point with a sprinkling of dividend along the way. They also must reinstitute Capex at some point. Bankers are nrent as excited to lend this time around and OXY would be well served to use FCF to inch their Capex up a bit each quarter. My opinion on timeline is Q3/CC announcement of reinstituting a meaningful dividend but at a much lower rate than 2019. By this time, oil should be north of $80 and world supply will be noticeably altered from todays levels. Capex will be slowly but increasingly introduced, and debt should be down to ~$30 Billion.I just don't see OXY in divestment mode until we hit the $80's in oil. If we go to $80, by summers end, then a powerful path to $100 is imminent. I believe OXY will divest at this point. Assets will be at a premium but not frothy overvalued. Time to divest. With the sale of assets and the remaining fcf for 2021, we should hit the net debt target that OXY is comfortable with to return to pre C19 dividend disbursements. By then, OXY could very well be flirting with $100+ SP within 6 months of all these points implemented. But, a dividend next month seems much too early IMO. OIL is in overbought territory and a retest of the support is on the table IMO. I believe we get a week or so of weakness only to continue the supporting rise into Spring and Summer. Loving the Warrants here. Looking for a sizable dip of 10% or more and getting another grip and enjoying the ride."
paying a dividend three times higher than the earnings may not last long
I’m really hoping this keeps getting stepped on for a bit. 8k warrants currently and need a little time to get more
Oil now flirting with $64.00 barrel. Icahn still owns 8.2% of OXY. I will be so glad when the oil market stops reacting to every COVID headline.
OXY is going to be $50 in June
"Let the market makers bait everyone back to big tech for a day or two before Powell speak, $30 by Friday minimum"
Why would I sell in the 30s. Its worth 40+
"Genuine questions, how difficult is it to increase storage capacity, and was there any major projects already underway in the US to increase storage capacity? What are we talking, weeks, or months to build a new storage depot/tank or add to an existing storage depot. I would have thought that given US strategic stockpiles have been at near record highs for a couple of years, then there would have already been projects on the go to increase storage capacity. Im long OXY, stay safe, stay home, stay long."
"(OXY-WT) is the warrant ticker right now traded at $4.78. If Oxy is at $50 in 3 years, this warrant still has 4 years to expire. At the volatility of 100%, risk free rate at 1%, share price at $50, strike price at $22, the warrant value will be valued at $40. If you sell your warrants, you are losing the 7.37x gain in 3 years. So you know why there are SPAMMERS want this down."
"Considering that oil keeps going down today OXY is holding up and gaining ground, this maybe the time to jump in, I was looking for a lower price but maybe 15 is the new bottom"
Looks like we got a runner!
bought oxy yesterday @ 61.99.... bought more today at 57 3000 shares long term.... oxy was already undervalued so if they get darko good... if they dont we are still holing 5%+ div and one of the biggest players in the permian... its a great buying op no matter how it plays out
Does this company make money? What price per barrel do we need to be net positive. Also can they pay down their debt? Is debt an issue with this company?
"Oil can't stay green , OXY won't hold 10 this week nothing to move it higher . Election in 50 days , 3rd quarter average analyst earnings per share is -.73 ! Look for a new 52 week low this month , Management needs to do something to move the stock , oil can not do it by itself. Tech still pulling more cash in"
If oil down a good chunk tomorrow we could see a 5% + drop in OXY
"Ok, so admittedly I should have sold in the high 50's when this deal really started to gain steam. Now we're in the low 50's and it seems like this company is dead weight in my portfolio. Risk of divy cut, tons of debt, WB getting a huge payout... I'm really struggling to justify staying in. Short of a spike in oil prices, can someone give me the upside case for hanging tight? I don't want to wait 5 years to see the results of the buyout. Feels like they will cut the dividend to me... Please someone, convince me I'm wrong?"
"On every MB, there are pumpers and bashers. Both post and go. But a few posters with a hidden agenda, are quite persistent, and constantly spreading negative views about OXY. Though I did my DD, I wasn’t 100% sure when I started buying OXY, and now thanks to WB, I’m confident now to own OXY. I’m in big time (my standard), 3.3K shares."
"This is what I would like to see happen.I have both OXY and APC for a total of 5200 shares. 3000 OXY and 2200 shares APC. If CVX has so much muscle, take them both out. I'm calling you out CVX. Anybody else here feel that way?"
Even Buffett sold his OXY ordinary shares at loss in April 2020
I am sure OPEC didn’t account for this
There is little argument that the stock markets have many things in common with gambling and casinos. I admit that I am a gambler myself and I like to give good odds to the opposite side of my bets. That is what makes gambling exhilarating. My throw of the dice says OXY price will hit $30 before trading at $23.
***** XOM news...... is looking good for the whole sector*****deepsub
"￼NEWS ALERTOccidental Petroleum Cuts Pay for Staff, ExecutivesOccidental Petroleum is cutting salaries for its U.S. employees by up to 30% in a bid to slash expenses, according to an internal email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Chief Executive Vicki Hollub’s salary will be reduced by 81% and the oil-and-chemical company’s top executives’ pay will be cut by an average of 68%, according to the email."
The market sold off in advance. Set the bar pretty Low now
Is it just me or is the warrant priced crazy low right now? I mean potential to move +500% with a 50% move in share price to a level it was at in the past couple of months.. I hopped out of OXY day before earnings because that run was just too good to justify risk of holding through earnings. But with the drop in share price and especially warrant price I’m jumping back into both in a huge way today.
Permian oil production has plunged by as much as one million barrels a day as the coldest weather in 30 years brings havoc to a region that seldom faces frigid Arctic blasts.
collectively thats almost 175 million shares with cost basis of at least $25
Anyone have any insight as to why the warrants are up 10%+ right now?
It's Friday and nobody's scared. This horse is ready to go next week!
"Had the Hershey squirts all afternoon because of this... now currently feeling much better!! Oxy finally did the right thing paying uncle buffet in cash!! Good call, positivity coming soon for sure. Oxy really held on strong for a bear market today"
didnt everyone already expect that the bloated pes of 100-1000 common is the stock market would cause this to happen ..actually days like this could happen to tech and stay at home over and over again until their pes are brought way way down...
So lets look at some math at 55$ so daytraders are not posting every time oil prices drop slightly...212 million per dollar over their their new cash flow neutral price of 38....3.7 million free cash flow ...after capex before dividend....that is over 4$ PER SHARE OF FREE CASH FLOW .... where we are now puts it over 5 billion...keep in mind how small their market cap is with these numbers

Do you think it’s a better buy to buy the warrants right now or the stock. I’m torn between the option

"Some of you think this is the SS OXY TITANIC....I submit you need to rethink that....there is no Dividend Iceberg and 2020 should bring a new bull market after a long period of THE BEAR. I am very good at arriving at conclusions without allowing emotion to over-ride data. And, as I have quoted Sir John Templeton investor extraordinaire: Boolean"
There is some after hours manipulation going on if you watch the trading...
Oxy is a great stock. You have to seize the opportunity.
Things will keep rolling but more than likely mandatory masks...if you are not a daytrader widen your recovery slightly ...oil moved 35-40 per barrel in about 45 days and more than likely it will fluctuate here for another month or so...THE GOOD NEWS IS OXYS BREAK EVEN IS ABOUT 31 AND THE HEDGE ADDS TEN......HUNDREDS OF COMPANIES ARE WORKING ON VACCINES AND ANTIVIRALS AND TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS ARE AT STAKE FOR THE WORLD...OIL WILL BE MUCH HIGHER THAN THIS IN MONTHS AND MOST OIL STOCKS WILL BE MUCH MUCH HIGHER...
"Free cash flow break even appeared to be about 34 per barrel this quarter . 1.15 million barrel per day 103 million barrels in a quarter ..realized price about 42 per barrel ...they had 800 million in free cash flow so 8 dollars per barrel free cash flow or 34 per barrel break even for free cash flow not eps .so even if capex goes up 200 million this quarter break even will be about 36-37 ... this would move free cash flow this quarter to 2,5 billion or more just at 60 with about 200 million more cap ex numbers that big are the same as 2018 when this was much much higher"
"There is container ship, the Ever Green, stranded in the Suez Canal. Authorities say that it will take several weeks to take care of the problem. Obviously this interferes with the flow of oil and other cargo through the Suez Canal. You do the math."
STOCK BROKER EMPLOYEES ITS OVER; EVERYONE IS AWARE THAT YOU ARE MARKETING OCCIDENTAL OIL STOCKS AND ACTUALLY THE COMPANY ITSELF IS BANKRUPT. GO AND FIND YOURSELF SOME HONORABLE JOB; WHAT YOU DO IS QUALIFIED ROBBERY
Especially the Europeans. All because eurozone is about to have a huge pickup in demand. Lockdowns are ending are vaccinations back on track. Who cares about India
FYI in case you missed it - Wells Fargo analyst downgraded OXY price target to $56 from $75. for what it's worth
Chevron merging with Exon??? Wow. In my opinion the worst is behind us. With oil cutting CAPEX by 30% last year I see supply substantially dropping this year. J&J vaccine approval in a week and stimulus will pass in 2 weeks max In 6 months covid will be behind us. Chart improving. I expect millions of Americans to take vacations this year. I say oil between $80 and & $100 by end of summer. Pay attention to EIA. Would not be surprised to see inventories drop by 20 million barrels in a week. OXY easy $40 stock by summer
when is the call?
"if it breaches 63 again, it should recover back to 64"
"$CPE $CDEV $MRO $OXY $XOM All of those in favor of abolishing the API, say I? Because for some reason, even though they look at the same exact data as the EIA, they somehow ALWAYS manage to get everything wrong and be continually more bearish than normal. It's like if you gave a calculator to someone and they tried to turn on a TV with it. What a joke.GREAT to see our performance into earnings. As I said a few weeks ago, the hardest part was making sure we held our lows in the bottom of our ranges the past 2/3 months. Consistently, the catalysts to break through the upper parts of our price ranges has been EARNINGS (which is obvious, given equity pricing under 60 dollar crude in 2018 was nearly triple for companies like CPE and CDEV).It's a no-brainer. The narrative changes every other day, and I've seen it happen -- oil down one day and it's 'Oil down due to lockdown fears.' Oil up the next and it's 'Oil up due to reopening.' For two months, the headline should actually have read 'Oil yoyo-ing due to MMs manipulating prices for paperhanded retail investors.' Now, it's time for the supercycle narrative to take heed. See you all in greener skies! Cheers to my long-time longs!"
Is Jim Cramer a joke? In June he said not to buy ROKU as it will be under pressure as there is no more lockdown. Now ROKU is doubled and trading at 220. Now he is suggesting to buy ROKU. All the tech stocks are at all time high. They are heavily bloated and can burst at any time.
"Based on what OXY said before, OXY will live well at WTI $40. Let us see what 2nd Q report will bring."
"They didn't mention the EIA numbers on the news, Just talking about BIT COIN !"
$30 in 2025
how can I short Occidental equity? Shorting equity means earning as the stock price decreases?
Really?????
It’s the frippin media. Some guy says the sky is falling and everyone sells!
We’re at about the same price as we were for last earnings. Last earnings was horrible btw and it still managed to climb $7.00 post earnings. If this earnings looks good-even kind of good (with positive guidance) watch it go back to $30s.
"With WTI now headed toward $66.00 a barrel OXY should be a hell of a lot higher in price, unless they have stopped pumping oil out of the ground!!!!! That's how ridiculous this sell off is!!!! Apparently that's the current markets response!!!!!Hopefully we will get a decent earnings report with good forward guidance????Even with a down market companies that have reported good earnings are up today, BP,XOM,MRO,...etc."
API released solid numbers yesterday. Because of Veteran's day today EIA will release its numbers tomorrow. 100% numbers will be solid. OXY going higher tomorrow
Gotta wonder - when APA reports a true blockbuster quarter - and the market yawns - what chance OXY has to break new ground post earnings .

"with OIL stays at $42, the fundamental is improving."
"“Increasing production by about 1 million barrels a day over three months when product demand is expected to rise by about 3 million barrels a day over the same period is not bearish,” Roger Diwan, a vice president at IHS Markit Ltd. and veteran OPEC-watcher, said on Twitter. “It is conservative anticipation, but anticipation nonetheless.”"
Looks like cycling out of tech into materials abs energy. It’s a start to better things to come

"I think that for OXY to declare a dividend increase prematurely, (before the institutions, market makers, analysts and the public are of one mind) would be disastrous to the price of its shares. OXY needs to focus on cost efficiency, maximizing free cash flow, and debt reduction. Once the balance sheet shows substantial progress in those 3 things the marketplace will look positively on a dividend increase. Until then, patience."
Oil moving up nicely in early trading - expecting a strong start to the OXY year.
"disappointed with oxy's latest dividend announcement. but hollub an co related debt reduction is a huge priority. i'll be ok if oxy uses the increased cash flow to pay down the debt. i'm thinking get the debt number below oxy's mkt cap, and then we'll see improving dividend payouts."

congrats for those who got an entry around 24 with 65$ barrel wti.

Maintenance capital now listed at $2.9bn. Very bullish.
there's a real possibility this might end at 27
OXY need WTI to at least be $40 a barrel to make money. Now over $60 you better believe OXY will announcing the return of dividends late April or May. Get in now before you miss the rocket!
"$OXY losing it's S&P 100 status effect is mostly symbolic. There is only 1 ETF that tracks S&P 100 and that's Invesco's EQWL fund which owns a whooping... 31,000 shares according to fintel.io. To put that into context $OXY's average volume is 38 Million. If OXY crashes Monday it will be because of irrational fear, not fundamentals. Oil demand is going to rise with increased vaccination. Green tech may be the future but right now oil still dominates. If this dips hard it will be a good buying opportunity."

House of PAIN.Sunday crude future down 1.04DJIA futures down 184Imagine if Hollub was shareholder friendly and put this to a vote ?Zero chance of passing.Enjoy the ride to the 30’s.
"OXY has been on my watch list since a while. Seeing WTI (May future contracts) prices turning negative was some kind of a shock. I understood that it was happening just before rolling over June contracts. I was worried that the same might happen just before rolling over July contracts, especially as WTI has been rallying for a while. Seeing the price climbing over 30 was one good reason to buy. After some critical news from China, WTI prices dropped last Friday, but recovered again same day, which shows some strength.Thinking oil prices will keep going down from now is somehow absurd. Largest oil buyers might be buying at this price already, otherwise they might have to pay higher price in 6 months or a year.With current Covid-19 situation people in some countries tend to think that 'the sky is falling', because of what they see in their daily lives: Everything closed, no cars, no airplane, etc. However, in countries where situation has already gotten better life is back to (a new) normal. China is probably the best example. Another example is Europe.It is not about oil, it is about energy in general. Oil is currently probably our most important source of energy. Seeing the weather having more extremes (hotter and colder days) will make us consume more and more energy. I hope reliance on oil will be reduced in the future anyway, but unfortunately do not see this happening anytime soon."
"Just be patient, we are at the bottom and the upside is one of the biggests of the industry."
"Problem with the OPEC===> As soon as the oil price is up everybody starts cheating, especially they didn't sell enough oil last year and their governments need money."
"You don’t need or want those crude storage reports. As I posted 6 days ago; “ Amazing resiliency in crude and especially considering how rapidly we rose. Yet another proof how far below normal storage we are.”By the time those reports come out, the guys working at those places have already placed their bets."
Will do with a viagra or 2 much needed oxy
All eyes on OPEC+ meeting today and tomorrow. Some members against extending cuts. Theater as usual. In my opinion OPEC+ will extend cuts. Patience
For better or for worse I have been buying the dip below $29 yesterday and today. I don't see any reason for oil to go below $60 per barrel and at these prices OXY is very profitable. Time will tell.
WHICH STOCK BROKER TROLLS ARE ACTIVE TODAY? INTERACTIVE BROKERS? WMTRADE? IGTRADING? WHICH GROUPS ARE MARKETING TODAY?
I haven't seen one major brokerage analysts come out with a rating update on OXY. Nothing released over the newswires.

Thank goodness for gosh ness we closed above $25.
I bought Occidental Oil Shares last year at 35 US dollars. I will sell Occidental Shares and Warrants today. I think Occidental is in trouble. Buffett sold all his investments in Occidental in May 2020
OXY EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT IS DUE TODAY. I SOLD MY SHARES AS WELL. OXY CANNOT PAY ITS DEBTS ITS TECHNICALLY BANKRUPT. I ASSUME OXY WILL ANNOUNCE TECHNICAL DEFAULT SOON.
I’m going to go out on a limb here and predict that OXY sees $30 this week .

No. Whats happening with Oxy is normal when you acquire. Oil company's are basically at a 15 year lows. At some point going long energy will prove to be a good move as well as shorting gold."
"Oxy....a big opportunity..Occidental Petroleum (OXY) - Get Report shares rose after SunTrust analyst Neal Dingmann raised his rating on the oil producer to buy from hold and lifted his price target to $25 from $13.The company’s cash position is strong, he wrote in a commentary. Occidental has enough free cash flow and assets to manage its hefty debt burden, he said. The company’s debt totaled $39.74 billion in the first quarter, according to Morningstar.Occidental should continue to improve its balance sheet with both internal and external moves, Dingmann said. The possibility of ""massive"" asset sales - both domestic and foreign - is ""compelling,"" he said.With a conservative estimate for oil prices, Occidental could enjoy more than $1 billion in free cash flow this year and $2.8 billion in 2021, Dingmann said.He also raised his rating for oil and gas producer EOG Resources (EOG) - Get Report to buy from hold.EOG and Occidental could “quickly become among the most active E&Ps [exploration and production companies] translating into massive 2021 FCF [free cash flow] among other catalysts,” according to Bloomberg."
Where is the bottom?
Patience all. Positive earnings will return at some point and this will be mid $30s when it does. Dividend will increase over time and we’ll be back to $40s-$50s
Whatever happened to selling Ghana assets to Boru?
The Warrants are getting mighty attractive again.
Though I'm talking to myself WOW another outstanding OXY day !!
"Oxy should be at 50 usd at this oil price level. It will jump within days to much higher levels.Oxy is a cash machine at this level. Maybe a big merger is coming, because oxy is a bargain. Chevron or Exxon could snap it for 35-40 USD."

RIP shorts. Production at high end of guidance and Permian Basin proving to be the juggernaut of the industry. Debt paid down and probably dividend hike coming.Don’t look too much into after hours movements.
I am just here checking on @W to see if the meltdown has started.
"oil powers the world.. the reopening won't be fueled by EVs, solar, or snowflake ideas of the future... time for reality to take over.... oil is going to 80 minimum and oil stocks are going to show the world why they still rule..."
"People are so hilarious. Who gives a #$%$ about small day-to-day fluctuations. If you believe in the company, then hold your shares. if you subscribe to the oil bull cycle, then hold on to your shares. A reasonable response to these dips is to think that that stock is on sale and to buy more. You will thank your lucky stars that you had some balls to ride the turbulence once the dividend is restored. And if you got a dividend reinvestment plan then you are golden."
Buffet buying today
"Now that we closed the gap on the chart at $26.27, there is NO resistance until $40. Beautiful chart."
Buffet thinks OXY is cheap Investing $10 bill in preferred. Doesn't matter that it is debt the fact that he's putting up $10 billion shows his faith in the assets and thinks the stock is very cheap.
"HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 08, 2019--Occidental Petroleum Corporation (""Occidental"" or ""the Company"") (NYSE: OXY) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (""Anadarko"") (NYSE: APC) in a transaction valued at $55 billion, including the assumption of Anadarko's debt.""With Anadarko's world-class asset portfolio now officially part of Occidental, we begin our work to integrate our two companies and unlock the significant value of this combination for shareholders,"" said Vicki Hollub, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We expect to deliver at least $3.5 billion annually in cost and capital spending synergies and the focus of our Board and management team is on execution to achieve the promise of this exciting combination.

OXY investors are the most honest human beings. No short squeeze. No hype. No favourable market sentiment. No attention from the market (still down 50%). Not a single trick whatsoever! Honest earned money all the way to oil $150!
I would like to buy oil but it doesn't seem like all that much of a lucrative proposal anymore.
Mehmet Sakir do you need me to spot you a few bucks for a meal tonight it’s been a rough few weeks for you
"I said a couple of weeks ago OXY will be trading between 9-13 dollars the rest of the year and still stand by that call . Demand for oil is still low , storage will keep climbing as wells are put back on line , OPEC cuts may not last (Russia) . Almost 40 BILLION in JUNK DEBT that it can not refinance at a rate lower than it has now and 11 BILLION debt coming due in 2022 , OXY needs oil above the 40s ( around 60 ) to start making any meaningful profit and oil is stuck at 30 and will probably drop back to the 20s before years end . It will have to completely drop the dividend , issue new shares and hope it can make it thru the next year. The big hedge goes away in 7 months . I am waiting on anything positive coming out of the company . If it can make it thru the next year and oil goes to the 60s OXY might get to the 30s . Hopefully oil goes up and OXY can sell some properties to help pay down the debt . But right now it is dead money ."

"Uncle Joe to release stimulus details today, I am guessing $2 trillion which should include a $2000 check. Should be a good day for OXY. Enjoy"
Game over shorties. You should've listened.
12 million volume drove this down that much. I mean don’t people think that they need to make more gasoline since there is a backlog
Probably on earnings day they will announce the various sales...you guys do realize that 44 brent is a massive recovery ...they pump 1.4 million barrels per day and they stated more than once that breakeven is about is low 30s before second cut so their earnings potential is massive even at 41 and 44
"OXY's total production in Q2 was 1,116. GOM's contribution was 142, which is 12.7% of OXY's total production. Roughly cutting this by 1/2, the production from this region will impact ~6% down in Q3."
"Only thing that will make earnings bad is the Texas freeze, hopefully it didn’t get hit too much."
Traffic in Minneapolis has noticeably doubled in the last 2 weeks.. restaurants tripled... the reopening is JUST STARTING.... Gas usage is going to skyrocket... this is NOT the time to sell .....
Almost all reopening stocks are currently down. Don't get depressed. They will go up. Covid cases are trending DOWN right now. I almost find it both unfortunate and relieving that india's covid positivity rate is at 20%. It is very possible that more than 20% of entire population is infected with covid right now. That will slow the things down for sure in a month.
"OCCIDENTAL OIL IS IN DOWNTREND SINCE I POSTED HERE ""YOU SHOULD SELL AT 31.5 US DOLLAR"". THE DOWNTREND WILL CONTINUE. IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER IT INCREASE TODAY THE TREND IS DOWNWARDS. BANKRUPTCY CHAPTER 11 IS ABOUT TO BE ANNOUNCED"
"I am seriously excited with the price action today. The talking head narrative is weakness. C19 rearing its ugly head, potential shut downs, and the like. But, step back and look at the whole pic. The World Economy is opening. But, the market wants to be nervous over a report or two. Make no mistake. OXY is making money. This is not $40 oil where they are barely breaking even. Its been at or near $60 for the quarter. Its basing. Now, yes right now, its getting set to rise higher. We had a run to $65ish. A pull back is normal. Next up is $70. We are going to get there by July 1st. Most likely sooner. Then, its $80 by September. IMO, OIL waffles for all of Q4 around the $75-$80 handle. Finds a dip in Q1/22 then it can go either way from there. In any manner, OXY will report that they actually made money and this alone sill support the price. We are going back to $31 and soon. By Q2 its $40. By EOY its $50. When meaningful Dividend gets reinstated, then its anybody's guess. But, $80 oil with a divestment of projected assets and a reduction of debt to the $20's, with a dividend, will elevate the SP. If OIL is still climbing at that point? Well, SP could very well be inflated into the $80's and higher. After all, 100 million barrels of $80 oil for a quarter is $4 Billion+ in cash! Right now, they are making $2+ Billion in FCF per quarter. The market is in 'Show Me' mode right now. Put a quarter or two under our belts and the market will change to positive view of the sector. Current pricing is $10+ Billion in FCF. With a divestment or two, one would think that they will be where they need to be on the balance sheet by EOY. $10 warrants are a gift that is absurdly low. Looking to exit out of some other positions and hoping to get in to more Warrants by end of week or early next. Please OXY!!! Don't make your monster run before I get my money converted."
i bought the stocks at $ 8.85 i love oxy because it gave me over 80% return in just a few weeks
"Occidental Petroleum's guidance for FY' 21 production, as we already discussed, would be ~1.14 million barrels / day. The company's domestic operating costs would be ~$6.7 / barrel with transportation at ~$3.8 / barrel. Combining capital expenditures, that means ~$18.5 / barrel in total costs here. That will enable the company to generate strong cash flow at current prices.OxyChem should see some pretax income, most of which would be eaten up by midstream and marketing struggles. Still, however, breaking even from these businesses should be exciting at the same time. Overhead and interest expenditures for the company total ~$3 billion or ~$7.5 / barrel implying ~$25 / barrel in total costs counting interest expenditures.That means, with current crude prices of more than $60 / barrel, the company should be able to generate strong shareholder rewards, paying down debt, which is its main target."
Oil will go up sooner than later add more if you can. Earnings will be great of the entire energy sector.
"Jack Moore, one of your many directors on December 6th bought, just short of 13K shares at $38.61, approx $498,000 value. XOM > OXY."

"I have no quarrel with people shorting OXY at this level. The more the merrier. They will be the cannon fodder of the short squeeze that will happen in the not too distant future. If they can do it to Game Stop they can surely do it here. Too bad Mehmet has no money, lol"
"oil sold off from 66 to 63 because of the iran deal. it had already taken the beating. when the news is out confirming the deal, thats when we will see a beeakout"
Who remember OXY @ 9 $$$ ??? Couple of months from now will ask who remember oxy @ 27 $$$ see u @ 50 my friends
Oil up +2% the oil stocks lagging.
"oil has below 60 per barrel on average about 4 out of the last 5 years...and oxy and most other oil stocks were much higher...now you have daytaders posting like,,,,if oil does stay above 60 even 55 this stock will be back the 40s....keep in mind throughout the last 5 years they had billions more in cap ex per year and about 2 billion in dividend so at these levels plus 5 billion less in cap ex they are....I think that they had 6 billion in cap ex in 2019....now 3.4 billion less...that amount alone services the debt interest...37 billion even at 8%...."

"In order to swing the purchase of a company nearly its own size, Occidental Petroleum received $10 billion from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) in exchange for preferred stock that yields 8%. The preferred shares come on top of Occidental's now $50 billion debt load, some of which it inherited from Anadarko. In addition to the preferred shares, Berkshire Hathaway will hold warrants for 80 million shares with a strike price of $62.50 per share and an 11-year duration.Back up the truck this stock is cheap, great dividend and lots of potential. Just be patient ."
"Good interview on Yahoo this morning with an oil analyst. He mentioned that chronic under investment now is going to lead to a super spike and boom cycle in the next 9-18 months. I've been saying this for months, its all about the future and to not be short sighted when its comes to your investments today. Oxy will be able to get out of this jam, they have the assets and credit facilities to withstand the storm until the good days are back again. buy low, sell high"
YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
***** $27/share should be no sweat today...... then this afternoon maybe API will show us a strong draw down in gasoline inventories*****deepsub
A lot will regret next year to have sold their shares 
Berkshire Hathaway shareholders thank the OXY shareholders
$43 WTI (54% higher than 2Q) and @2.43 nat gas (37% higher than 2Q) Oxy can't be held down for too much longer!
Really not worried at all. Tech money will eventually flow over to the energy sector.
Gasoline 5.8Distillates 1.4Crude 6.4All drawdowns. Estimate on crude was 2. Wow..
"Yesterday put to rest the ever lasting fear on unexpected massive cap ex increases.. the question was asked over and over ...why ..so that it was on the record many times,,,why is this important....if oil stays this high they will have billions and billions in free cash flow for debt and shareholders instead of a major part of it going to production increases...they actually said for the next few year years.....I am sure that opec was happy too ...this allows them to feel comfortable will higher oil prices as almost all players in the US have announced lower cap ex....for oxy the analysts can safely model much higher targets without fear that capex went up some massive amount that was unplanned in their models"
Why cant OXY buy back WB shares by paying current price (roughly 2.5B USD)WB bought at 40 per share
I am in for the long haul
*****OXY listed today in the top 10 gainers of the S&P 500....... nice to get a little positive PR....*****deepsub
Just had a double bottom in crude futures.
***** GET YOUR KICKS....... on route 66....................$66/bbl..... who'da thunk it 30 days ago? I remember feeling light headed and giddy when oil hit the $50 mark........ now it's just GIDDY-UP........ as we roll on to $75........Ha!*****deepsub

India may go full national lockdown. I think the media is making India a scapegoat and creating fear to drive dwindling vaccine campaign. Their message is clear. You dont want any more lockdown? then get vaccinated. Considering the positivity rate is 20% currently.. And prior to 2nd wave delhi for example had 40% serum positivity for covid antibody.. I expect the cases to drop quickly before the end of may or june with lockdown or no lockdown.
I’m new to this board. Why has there been such a huge price decline in tge last year or two. What gives? Thanks.
"JUST BOUGHT 480 SHARES OF OXY FOR $44.95.AND ALREADY LOST SOME.WELL, I BELIEVE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS IT WILL BE 50% HIGHERAND WHILE YOU WAIT YOU COLLECT A HUGE 7% DIVIDEND!"
"Hey Toon, clean it up buddy."
"Great move Vicki Hollub (CEO)! She reduced the dividend payout from 0.79 to 0.11 cents and also reduced capital spending from $5.4/$5.2-billion to $3.5/3.7 billion. This will make their cashflow breakeven point for oil to be priced in the low 30’s per barrel. Currently it is trading in the low 30’s, at 33.50 per barrel. This was a great adjustment and she still has bullets she can fire."
Bottom line is they don’t show a profit even with high commodity prices!

Dividend is NOT in danger . Yet . If oil prices dip below $50 for an extended period then I’d suspect the dividend will end up being cut . Production increases needed to help fund this deal are what is in trouble right now with this low oil price much more oil has to be pumped for the same bottom line dollar amounts needed to pay interest and preferred dividends .
Have to wait on oil price. This stock has negative effects from Anadarko deal. I like deal at 2021 oil prices of 58 to 65. Dutch
"AH. Doesn’t mean much , but definitely gives sentiment of earnings , 30 min before closing , people panicked and sold fearing it will tumble .Sigh of relief"
here's your last buy-in dip chance
"Just talked to my broker about OXY options. Deliverable for options have changed as of today. One contract (call or put) that typically includes 100 shares of OXY will now include 100 shares of OXY + 12 new warrants + cash in liu of 0.5 share. This cash amount for 0.5 share is not decided yet. If you are long OXY calls, and exercise your calls, you will receive warrants along with shares. This confusion will hopefully resolve sometimes next week."
"Seems like the oil sector got ahead of itself. OXY is probably where it belongs for now pending the next EC update. The biggest story may be on how the balance sheet is being managed involving asset sales and that is commingled w/ progress on meeting the original production projections less the adjustment for the impact of reduced CAPEX. Any good news on those two fronts and the stock could start edging back up to near $50. Bad news will keep it in the low $40's. That of course is w/o any drama in the oil market, either way."
at this rate OXY div will be 8% plus in a short time again
"***** C'mon now, she begged--------------let's see a strong finish.!! (vbg)*****deepsub"
bounce gonna happen in the next 5-10 min
"Oxy hit and bounced off of major support today at the 24.24 level. Currently this stock is oversold. It is disappointing to be down today, sure, but really if you are an investor and are looking out perhaps to Aug/Sept (not too far) you would be rewarded for buying today. It is very likely we will see crude over $70 by the fall. Upside does extend to over $40 by year end."
"BOOMMMMMM... sorry shorties, premarket on Monday will rise at least $4before you can purchase this stock.https://us.yahoo.com/finance/news/mexico-says-made-opec-oil-125642805.html"
Mehmet needs a girlfriend. Oxy must remind him of his ex lol OXY back to $20+ by tomorrow..see ya then folks
If XOM & CVX report beats tomorrow and run ... OXY may well go up in tandem .
Looks finally the market knows OXY is a green company. Greener day by day :)
Oil hasn’t even dropped 2.5% and this drops almost 10%

I heard about OXY the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Here’s the issue hanging over the Oxy stock: It’s a cyclical industry. By the time this up cycle ends, will they be able to pay down debt AND sustain a dividend thru the next down cycle? Who wants to own a no growth stock that pays no dividend?"
"Warren Buffet just bought more common shares of OXY. Latest filing has 14,5 mil shares - an increase from his first purchase of 7.5 mil shares."
"man, we are all big aldults...why oxy up a lot this morning ? old people don't change their mind that quick ..."
"I am new to OXY. It seems cheap compare to other majors, and oil price is stable. Are there any other reasons for investing in this company? What are the main stories drive the stock up (or down)?"
If bank of america is even close on their 60$ oil and the Russians and Saudis saying demand will be back in full in three months this company can earn 8-10 billion a year..based on NEXT YEARS break even of 38$oil ..even if they add back 2 billion of capex thats still 6-8 billion or 7-9$ eps pre tax ..the upside gamble is far far better than the downside ...
"question for the board before investing. is there something being missed. Solid dividend..trading at the low end of the five chart...active in the permean, Is there something I should now that is not evident by a quick analysis"
Anyone feeling rich today ? Is the $9B write down that’s coming fully priced in ? Just asking .

Chinese New Year is over. I’m getting green shirts to get ready for Hari Raya
Yall remember that buy of 2M+ shares by JP Morgan? Thats what blasted us up from 15.50. If we hold 17.50 today I do believe that could be the bottom. All depending on how contract roll overs go.
"feel like the carbon storage is going to work out real well for Oxy, they should win no matter which way the wind blows"
Should crush estimates this quarter...based on their new sweet spot for production of about 1.15 million barrels per day revenue should come in north of 6.25 billion ...free cash flow should jump based on oil prices being 18-20 per barrel more than last quarter....they pump about 105 million barrel per quarter so free cash flow should be up 1.5-2 billion over last quarter...even if they throw in extra cap ex free cash flow increases should be enormous over last quarter
Teens by EOW or next week...
"03/07/2020, at 10:15 Eastern Seaboard Time, Brent Futures trading at $71.01 per barrel. WTI in NYMEX trading at $67.64. This seems to indicate a great opening for OXY tomorrow!!"

"My point of view is, that the asset deals in the near future will happen. Land sales in wyoming with about 1 Mrd usd and 5 Mrd usd with oil asset sales in Ghana and Oman. If this happens, I would expect a massive run in this stock, because near tern debts would than be no issue anymore. I also Oulu expect an loss of absolut -1,2 per share., what would be much better than expectations. We will see. The newsflow will be good. The stock is MASSIVLY undervalued."
Is it Monday yet?!
Above 30 by the end of this month. Above 35 by the end of June.Above 43 by the end of next year.

BUY OXY PUT OPTIONS AND OXY SHORT STOCK POSITIONS BEFORE THE MARKET OPENS. TODAY WILL BE A NEGATIVE RED DAY AGAIN

OXY is doing good under the downgrade and big mouse Cramer assaults.
"It's kind of amazing all the complaints about the market being up and OXY down.Of course, no one complaining mentioned that oil is down."
Profit taking snd end of the month. Oxy is a solid play. Earnings in little more than a week.
We are going to the $40's in a hurry.
"Oil up and oil, down..a. It opportunity. I am loading up shares. A bargain. 47 usd oil means huge profits for ox? Strong buy. The same for Devon and EOG and Shell."
The majors are already green
I sold my occidental oil shares after 1 year holding it with losses yesterday. I condemn whoever lied and manipulated SMALL INVESTORS LIKE ME AND FOOLED ME TO BUY THIS Manipulated Price fixed oil company.
"I think that on a day like today, where the major market indices fell significantly and WTI September was down $0.94 to $40.96 per barrel, it is heartening to note that most major oil companies showed resilience. XOM + $0.09; CVX - $0.03; PSX - $0.07; OXY - $0.13. To me, this means that the price of the shares of companies in the oil sector have, or are close, to bottoming out. I can remember when on days like today, OXY would be down over $1.00. I still think that until the warrants are issued on 08/03/20, and earnings are reported on 08/10/2020, it is unlikely for OXY to make a major move to the upside.. The consensus EPS estimate for OXY is a loss of -$1.63, and the high and low estimates are -$1.13 and -$2.19, respectively. My guess is that EPS will be -$1.43. That is just me. Do your own research."
"not complaining, but who is piling in on OXY? Retail or institutional? any insights?"
"obviously usually the buyout co goes down. but really gets me is they are suppose to increase shareholder value not destroy it.and you mean this is such a lousy deal? that they couldnt have gone to the bond market and raised money at 4 or 5 percent, junk bonds only yield 6. or issued more stock and pay a 5.5 divnow it may have caused some dilution etc., but still would have saved over a 100 million a yearthe reason.... execs bonuses tied to earnings? and issuing more this will make it more likely everyone gets their bonus? i dont know. but i know paying 8 percent interest is criminalwhy didnt they offer bonds to shareholders and pay the 8? i would have loved that"
"Media can't deny this forever. CDC data shows that total number of deaths in the U.S have not even come close to the Weekly totals we saw in the 2018 Flu season (Nov-Feb). there were 3 weeks where we surpassed 100,000 weekly deaths in 2018...

"I remain convinced that Icahn's sale of 10M shares was always timed to dump shares on the market anytime the price got over $42. He needed to keep the price depressed as further ""evidence"" that current OXY management has destroyed the value of the company, so dumping shares at the right time always pulled the price back. Any time there was a rise in stock price, it could have been seen by some as an indication Management is doing their job, so Icahn had to keep OXY low enough to support his argument. I also suspect a lot of the investment community press that has been critical of OXY management was also influenced by Icahn, and certainly a large part of the social media including rabid posters on this board. Icahn doesn't do anything that doesn't benefit Carl Icahn, and he will do anything to achieve that goal."
"Chart looking good with higher lows and higher high , not much resistance until around 16+ if the market holds . The only issue is the lower volume the last few days , other oils had better volume days ( XOM ,CVX , MRO , APA ). Finishing near the high of the day and with the move the last week I would have like to see well above average day move and not lower. But will take the up ticks on the highs of the vaccine, just see how long it last. Be a good time for OPEC+ to extend the cuts for a few months ( 4-6 months , get to the summer ) or even drop another 1/2 to 1 million bdls per day. I will probably wake up here in a little and see it back in the 10s."

"WTI = $45.59OXY now starting to make money. Management at OXY think oil goes to $55/bl. And that makes OXY under valued by a lot. Debt is super high manageable. Two years from now OXY is leveraged fine.So where oil goes, so does OXY"

Watch the last hour of trading today as XOM CHV PSX all report before the bell tomorrow. Take into consideration that the end of the month is tomorrow and we can see a lot of window dressing. Still a long ways off from earnings. Patience
"If it goes down on Monday, be disciplined, don't panic, buy more if you can. I will be.Herd mentality in investing is lethal.Cramer on CNBC says energy is not investible. That is precisely when it is a time to buy. While he may be entertaining with his screems and gestures for many, the pros like Icahn and Buffett are quietly loading up with OXY stock at rock bottom prices, recognizing easily opportunity of a lifetime. Remember, big money likes silence.... or go with the herd mentality and lose.The Saudis and Russians actually are most motivated to make the deal now. The rest of G20 seems like ...ok we want the price to be stable.... but we will let them sweat first.Don't worry OXY, WES sure long term bets IMHO."

"At least according to macro trend, OXY has never in its history traded this cheap relative to book value.P/S has only been this low since the financial crisis.The Anadarko acquisition practically comes for free as far as I can tell.Icahn is throwing temper tantrums because he wasn’t invited to the party.This could be extremely cheap or at least fair value on a FCF perspective. Disinflation—>Inflation could be another big tailwind in the years to come.Even if it goes no where, it doesn’t cost to hold and should continue to provide returns.That bald ugly guy hates it.I honestly cannot find a reason to not purchase this other than the cost of capital for the ma. I’m a rookie, so what do I know. I am batting though."
"Good Earnings report but not a blow out. If they showed some profit in this quarter instead of loss of 15c, then it would have been amazing. Still getting their highest cash flow for a quarter in the last 10 years, shows how powerful these earnings are. Q2 will be a blow out earnings. Surely some funds will start entering OXY now. Slow and steady upward movement till Q2 earnings."
on balance volume is down but not a screaming sell by any means....good luck all... looking forward to 1:00 eastern time zone but should see the stock rise before that in anticipation of bullish outlook on production/debt reduction etc. Boolean
Friday and long weekend. Would be nice if we could finish green. Then start to rally again Tuesday. EIA and API improving week after week. No reason why we cannot hit $30 by end of month and start the journey to $40

"OXY is now the most undervalued equity in the big cap oil sector with an 11 PE multiple, a 5% dividend, and prime Permian positioning. If not for last week’s (still unconfirmed) noise about Occidental trying to buy Anadarko, the stock would be trading at $70+ today."

OXY can BUY UP Many BAKKEN COMPANIES and Look @ WLL. WLL did The Same back when Oil was $100+ going on a Shopping Spree and got loaded with Debt Drilling at Full Throttle.

"Today we didn’t hit $26 or $27 even with oil almost up 5% , didn’t expect such a good IEA today but would have expected this to close easily over $26 with oil up as much as it is today, OXY is def not performing like it had been on previous bull run and could be because they haven’t issued any earnings guidance"
"The investment money will change from tech to old economy, such like oil. These sectors are MASSIVLY undervalued., oxy is one of the most undervalued shares from my opinion. Do your own maths."
"Does anyone know if Total SA is still interested in buying Oxy's African assets? If so, what value to you think they can get for those assets now in this current environment? It's my understanding that the company planned on using those proceeds to pay down a substantial portion of their debt."
WTI over $63. Shorts
B of A upgraded OXY target price to $32 with Buy.
today might be the last day to get in under 27.50
Attack on oil fields in Iraq. Oil going higher
I just hope we don’t do like Laredo monday.
"Hollub acted as a corporate autocrat in this process. She did everything possible to not put this acquisition to a vote. Icahn gets involved and Hollub assured the dissidents received a NO vote, If this acquisition fails Hollub probably gets a BOD with a Berkshire subsidiary and a golden parachute. If the deal succeeds Buffet becomes the big winner and the shareholders turned bagholders simply went along for the ride."
"If it closes lower than 19.17 then a new lower low forms which may signal a downtrend starting . With an up grade yesterday , oil still climbing and the dollar lower that would not look good for the near term if OXY can not move higher. I guess the vaccine high maybe over , good run just needed a couple of more dollars up."

Bottom line is OPEC will increase 1 million BPD with a higher demand of 3 million per day die a net negative of 2 million barrels a day.
"Now I understand why it tumbled yesterday at closing , it was not because 10M cut not enough , it is because Mexico threw some uncertainty to the deal , which market doesn’t like !!But Monday , will go back over $18 @ opening ,If agreeing , please put like"

"• Tuesday's release of the Chemical Activity Barometer by the American Chemistry Council clearly is representative of an economy that is strengthening. • The recent trend in the U.S. LEI is consistent with the economy picking up in the coming months, and The Conference Board now projects year-over-year growth could reach 6.0 percent in 2021. • Of the 153 S&P 500 companies that have reported earnings for Q1 2021, 86% have exceeded analyst expectations."

A big oil company will make a bid to buy OXY.
red or green for the weekend? thumbs up for green
"From now to Christmas it's gonna be a string of good news... the vaccine will start deployment, the transition will move forward, air line tickets will uptick, oil will go up, online sales will rock and roll and OXY will see 20"
Am I crazy to think that OXY will close today above $31.25?
hilarious 
i love the smell of money in the morning....smells like Victory
"So I read most of todays comments and I don't know what to think. I checked and OXY has 100B assets and 70B liabilities. I understand that most people think that it was wrong to buy Anadarko, but shouldn't this move have big advantages and positives sooner or later? I got in when the stock price was 12.84 and I have only 50 shares, so I will keep this and not sell. I understand that it is completely different for someone who has 10 000 shares for example and not 50 like me, but I also believe, that you should invest only what you are prepared to lose in order to be successful investor. I hope I will see the dividend I bought this company for in the beginning of 2021 :))"
"on the way to 12$ before earnings, just like i predicted."
"Occidental will issue about 17.3 million shares, worth about $257 million at Tuesday’s price, of its common stock, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. The shares will be used to pay the dividend Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is owed for investing $10 billion in Occidental last year to help fund its $37 billion takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., a deal that has since gone sour due to the collapse in oil prices."
If the increase news is accurate IT IS GREAT NEWS....they spelled out all the way to July with miniscule increases....as europe reopens in the next 30-45 days there had to be fears of much larger increases...its clear that they want oil at or near current levels
"Let's not make this anything more than what it is. Objectively does this sound about right.Slow climb until execution date of 6/4 then sell off on 6/5 eventually settling back to this base and channeling until earnings reports 8/6 Variables:Oil prices up or downIran saber rattling China US tariff ""discussion""Company remarks before earnings"
Will OXY pass the last time 8 June's peak( 24.5) ?
"got more Jan 22 30cs at 2.50 to add to the collection......wow I am certainly thankful, middle of summer on its way, wonder what the energy sector will do :O"
all buy calls now. the funds are loading up calls!
"Sell off on all US oil majors, maybe there is a leak report of crude build up"
they are going to have poor earnings because of the bad weather
do you know why it sold off? it's to give the funds time to cover
Occidental Petroleum hires Moelis & Co to advise on how to ease the burden of it's liabilities. I have a novel idea. How about hiring CEO that is smart enough to do it without wasting more money or better yet not get into this situation in the first place. Unbelievable.
I have bought another 200 shares
Good things come to those who wait. We are going to have a great year. Happy New Year to my fellow long friends!!!
Etrade both Raymond James and Merrill lynch had major upgrades today
Hopefully Icahn is done with trimming his position according to SEC filing today.
"OXY is a smart buy at this price level, realistically looking one year out this could easily be trading at $45."
Hello Oxy board. Got in at 39.99$ 150 shares. 1st time in this space. So far so good. Looking to hold for a while.
"Waiting for OPEC+ decision. Sounds like OPEC will increase supply by 500,000 barrels a day instead of 2 million starting January. If that is the case we do have bullish news for oil. In my opinion the days of cheap oil are done. Expect an increase in oil price especially in 2021. I say WTI at $60 in 2021. Oil price to spike, big money coming to oil and expect OXY to hit $30 in 2021."
driving season just warming up
Anyone playing the warrants?
Do I hear $45.75
"Do you think $60 oil (+ or - a few bucks) is a given for the next 6 months or do you see wild swings given projected, albeit modest increases in both Supply and Demand. And at $60 oil, shouldn't OXY be on top of a $30 stock price. Options sentiment appears somewhat bullish for the stock."
"Excluding the impairment charges, Oxy had a ""breakeven"" Q when it was expected to be the worst Q. I am good with this result and expect to have much better results from Q3. I noticed no significant asset sales happened in Q2 as well as the dividend of $1.6 billion was a bit bothering me. It should suspend it until it has better performance in the future."
"There are rumors That Exxon will acquire oxy. Hope not, if than only for a price 25 usd or more per share. Lower prices are unacceptable. Exxon sounds more on exploration in 2 years. Oxy has the most upside potential once a vaccine or a medicine treatment will be approved. It is a quadrilpler."
A decline in oil inventories should reverse these declines in the oil sector?????
S oil analyst who said said sell OXY
This should go up a $1 tmr and the day after with how this is going. It happens everyday this accumulation at sold off prices
"Sold out guys. Good luck to all. Hoping I can get back in on a dip. OPEC will need to increase production at some point. Medium term, this is a strong hold."
"take some profit and wait and see those who got in before today. too much uncertainty, I will let the board know when I buy back in"
"I can’t believe we’re at the same price as we were in June of 2020; before a confirmed vaccine!!! If you felt that you missed out on some good gains, you’re getting a second chance."
What happenning ???? We see green !!!!! earning leaked?

"Ichan's Open Letter to OXY shareholders. If you haven't read it, do so. The link is https://carlicahn.com/open-letter-to-occidental-petroleum-stockholders-4/"
Did everyone forget that the pipeline move 2.5 MILLION BARRELS PER DAY AND THEY WERE DOWN FOR A WEEK..COMMON SENSE ALMOST 18 MILLION BARRELS DID NOT MOVE....THOUSANDS OF STATIONS STILL EMPTY ...NEXT WEEK WILL BE A TOTAL DIFFERENCE
"Also remember if warrants are not in a retirement account , taxes will have to be paid as income ( unless someone know difference ) on the amount put into the account . I know it not a lot for me but some might need to figure it into their tax planning for the year. Just to stay in a lower tax bracket. Not sure if you can call it a dividend or just regular income for sure."
New Month and new Quarter
"mhmmmm tsla up $70 in a day and im going to sell into a 10% pullback for no reason on low 60s crude and the stimulus being signed, got it lol it all makes sense."
Does anyone else ever read (http://Pick-stocks.com)? They just mentioned OXY this morning.
Based on Saudi Aramcos report today it appears that they need about 56-57$ barrel prices to break even after their 75 billion dollar divi that has been promised as almost permanent ... so as stated most players need oil to stay at healthy levels .. at 40 per barrel as an average through 2020 they were short about 26 billion
Every OXY investor waiting for earnings ...
"If Buffett buys it, so do I. Great dividend. $40's per share next week."
"I said $20 by Friday. If EIA releases solid numbers tomorrow we go over $20. Ton of bullish news for oil. Stimulus to pass in days, vaccine approval in days, Saudis raised oil price to Asia, GS has economy expanding at 5.3% in 2021. Oil is going higher and so is OXY. What happened last 4 weeks was just a warm up. OXY going higher"
Go up up up
"This reminds me of GE, until there's a SERIOUS change at the top, OXY shares will at best flounder for a while even after this ""deal"" is done"
"Ichan bought 1,200,000 warrants recently $2.95 & $2.86"
"Nice to see my old employer turning the corner. Higher oil prices help...a lot. Not sure how much they still hedge out into future, yet alone at what price, but higher is good. Saw that inventory report. None of this has to do with OPEC since we don’t import oil anymore. And then throw in that it’s hard for a lot of these guys to raise funds and Start drilling and fracking. And the petroleum engineers like me are gone, forever. So oil prices should continue higher and so will oil stocks. But the comment from the EIA that oil prices will drop...that is almost a guarantee it will go up. Their job is to count. Not to forecast. Kind of like the GAO. Going to be a great year in oil stocks."
Good job longs. Congress leaders to meet in an hour to discuss stimulus. Hope we have good news tonight. GS said oil at $65 in 2021. Vaccine is out. Moderna will be approved by Friday. I say OXY going higher. Taking my friend to dinner. After all it is his cash
"Any dip is a buy at this point, do not get caught missing out on the push to low 20s, its coming. WTI is setting a floor in the mid 40s with nothing but positive news coming up from the world reopening and possibly Opec still holding off increases for a couple more months."

"Buffett became one of the wealthiest people on the planet by capitalizing on opportunities. He sees some fantastic opportunities right now, courtesy of the Federal Reserve.""This is a very good time to borrow money, which means it may not be such a great time to lend money, but it’s good for the country that it’s a good time to borrow money,"" he said in May at his Berkshire Hathaway company's online shareholders meeting.To help the economy recover from the coronavirus, the Fed ""did the right thing"" by cutting a key interest rate to near zero, Buffett said."
Seems like production will show better than expected results for Q3 based upon a preliminary guidance. Once this gets rolling cash flow will be rapidly accelerating.
"All in all, OXY is a pure gamble on oil price, not an investment grade stock..."
*****LMAO....NOW......... it goes green A/H.......figures*****deepsub
"So oil down Oxy goes deep red, oil up Oxy just some red ... not sure what kind of positive catalyst to look for"
@Chris probably you have to reset the April fool’s day target to 20 from 30. Sorry !
"The stock price of OXY today takes all the guess work out of investing and reduces it to just 2 decisions. 1). Do I continue to hold my shares that are down 50% in my case. Or 2). Sell out and take my beating today due to the prospect of complete bankruptcy. It’s really a simple decision, but complicated by the fact that making no decision is a decision."
are they going to release or wha?
Oxy wont move much until the earning. I think this is what is going to happen. Poor earning but good guidance. So it will drop initially and will go back right up in few days like how it did during the last earning. Q4 earning confernce the whole management team said the production in Q1 will be the lowest plus they said they received noticeable blunt from Texas freeze. They however also daid their production for full year however wont be affected. Based on my research they have 10 to 30% hedged with 78.61 ceiling price. The market is waiting for earnings Just In Case... Just in case the management team made a mistake. Saw what happened to LPI after earning? Was it ~70% hedged at wti 55?
How bout those warrants...

BANKRUPT OCCIDENTAL HAS DROPPED 65% SINCE THE MARKET PRICE CAPPED 31 US DOLLARS
If OXY has a blowout quarter this could easily pop 10 percent. Back up to 29
What is deal? Last night crude oil was at $66.30 and all of the sudden it's back to $64. What changed? It seems to be following a pattern where after hours it goes up and market open it goes back down. The crude rally appears to have lost all steam.
"SEC is regulating how institutions mange their short/margin fund. Hope this impacts OXY positively, eliminating short promotors like Mehmet."
"All solar stocks up today and all oil stocks down big today. Normal behavior after new administration was installed yesterday. But now we go back to reality. Vaccine, stimulus, OpEC decision and so on. Economy to fully reopen this summer and oil demand will spike. GS said oil at $65 in summer and I 100% agree. Patience"
Glad I added more in the low $24's
"Buffet buying, insiders buying, bottoming on the chart. I'm buying more tomorrow."
"lets dissect the jpm call...Pre covid all analysts had target of 35-60 per share..oil averaged 50-55...5.4 billion of capex and about 1,5 billion in dividend and maturing debt and no asset sales....so now they agreed to 3 billion less in cap ex and no dividend..so about 4.5 billion less in expense and some cost saving synergy so lets go with 5...they pump five hundred million barrels so thats 10 per barrel less ??? so he goes on to say that they need 60$ oil to make a difference.#$%$ ...last quarter was cash flow positive of 1.4 billion so 5.2 billion per year less 1 billion of hedge benefit so 4.2 billion ...at 60 that would mean that oil is up 22 per barrel and at 1.25 million barrels per day that is about 28 million per day of profit or 10,25 billion per year more so about 14 billion in free cash flow...move out about 6,8 billion in interest and depreciation that would leave about 7 billion in eps.........or about 9 per share....this is self serving...all the big money is still riding tech and till its cant go any further and then ALL OF SUDDEN OIL AND gas IS LOOKING GREAT AFTER THEY LOADED THEIR BOATS WITH STOCK AND OPTIONS.......pull out the past 7 months and the virus...now look ...if they were 45-50 at 52 oil and had 5 billion more in expense why do they need 60$ oil now to make a difference ..when they sold 5 billion in assets ..removed impending debt maturities ...found more synergies....AND ANNOUNCED THE BIGGEST CARBON CAPTURE PLANT IN THE WORLD"
The overall market pop yesterday & today seems to be softening the blow here . That’s a good thing if you are long .
CEOs big online expose tomorrow could move this alot if Opec works out
"Oil stocks still a safe haven.... many bought across the board their favorites at the lows and really there is no where safe to move to. Most oil stocks are still down 50% pre covid yet crude is much higher...Tech , stay at home, and alternative energy could implode...an major tech analyst was asked how far could things fall his answer...pes have expanded 50% or more and there was really no reason..just because..do you guys remember that all analysts would not give even apple a 20 pe ...not you have tech and others with 100-1000 pes ...pes pre covid were in the 20s ..you can do your own math....some oil stock could still easily move 30-50% in the next couple of months and a;; the bs valuations that were given ...just because ...to many other stocks could ......"

The 7 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy  Check out https://youtu.be/0KMtEGgad14
The fact analysts have been wrong on almost all oil predictions and behavioral finance is bringing this stock down is annoying. At 40 bucks a barrel this company should be at 20 bucks ...especially with oil forecasts being raised almost every couple weeks.
To put things in perspective with WTI above $64.60 and Brent above $67.8/barrel OXY should be a hell of a lot higher in price!!!
OXY looking like its rebounding and back on the upward trend?
Another thing to consider is OXY getting upgrades in its ratings as it pays down debt. Currently it’s at a junk bond Ba1 status. If they continue to get the debt down they’ll be back to an investment grade rating which will open the stock to a lot more funds. It will also allow OXY to refinance their debt at better terms. Should help free up more cash.
rotation they said. sure.
Dodge and Cox institutional added 29.5 million shares in Q1 to raise it's stake above 13% with 117.8 million.Their Mutual fund stayed at 52 million and 5.4%. Combined over 170 million shares and 18.9%. I guess they didn't want to be number 2.
I managed to short OXY stock yesterday 10k @ 16.8 USD. I also bought put options. Hopefully I will earn money when the stock sinks again. Probably today.
Oxy has a call today with analyst. Let’s see what news we have moving into the next few quarters.
This makes no damn sense WTI over $65.18/barrel and this stock is in the dumpster!!!!!!
"Longs, let us keep it simple. This week was rough. But predictable as new administration took over. In my opinion Biden's executive orders on drilling and pipeline will be bullish for oil and lead to higher oil prices. New administration not in a rush to lift sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. We will see faster vaccination taking place. A robust stimulus. Higher oil demand is coming. Sooner than you think. Most oil companies cut CAPEX by 30% and the ones that survived like OXY are more efficient. Biden new policy supports energy demand while restricting production. Patience is the name of the game"
"I just read an article regarding WB, during the recession, loaned $ to HOG for 15% interest without warrants for share conversation. Though HOG sp was low back then yet WB didn’t buy common shares. If he had he would have made lots of money. Though he never think HOG went BK but didn’t buy shares because as he explained he didn’t understand motorcycle business. Now think of OXY, WB loaned $ with warrants for common shares conversion. And he even went further to buy common shares. To my knowledge, BH doesn’t have major investments in energy sector nor own an oil company. So WB must be pretty confident in oxy business especially, after review their book."
"Just give Warren Buffett the company. OXY owes him 10 Billion, and the total market cap is 11 billion"

"Here is the 'APPROXIMATE "" math...they probably modeled about 52-54 for oil so lets say 53$...oil has been between 6-9 dollars a barrel more so lets say 7.5 ..old production figures for both companies show almost the same amount ..so combined about 1.4 million barrels per day...not including ANY RAMP UP..in the permian or nat gas sales so thats 504 million barrels per year xs 7,5 or about 3.78 billion net ...or 945 million this quarter ..which is roughly an extra 1$ of eps"
If it was just oxy in the red while other oil stocks are green ROB I would say you could have a point. So long run this will correct itself while the value of a barrel increases.
"Took a little profit today from some of the Feb calls I bought a few months ago , enough for what I paid for all the calls and for the loss in OXY stock I have had for a while . So now can relax and watch it move higher and not have to worry about something happening taking it all back. Now to make up the cost of some earlier calls I lost on and get rid of some other oils that probably won't come back to what I paid . Took over a year and a half but feel better . Now hopefully everyone can get even and make some cash , it never hurts to take some profit and let the rest run."
OXY sinks to yet a new 10-year low while delusional Adam continues to insist the Anadarko acquisition is a smart move. Best scenario at this point is for an activist investor to swoop in and oust the CEO and board of directors.
"If oil can not become a little more stable OXY could have a big problem , more than the other oil stocks . Fewer rigs in the Permian the last 6 weeks but when those new pipelines come on board this year and next look for more production out of the Permian due to fracking of wells that have been drilled ( but not fracked ) over the last few years . They were selling oil 15-20 dollars below spot because they could not move it out of there because of the bottleneck of few pipelines. Wells have been chocked back or not finished because of that , both oil and gas wells. US supply will probably jump once the pipelines are up and running and companies need to get rid of the crude because of debt. Watch OPEC's June meeting."
"Johnny sold because of yahoo glitch, i never get my stock price from yahoo"
"FYI, just because you are a BULL (like I am) doesn't mean you have to sit there like an imbecile and watch your account shrink for no reason when all signs point to the likelihood that oil is dropping in the near-term. It doesn't make you a ""short"" if you simply exit and re-enter when it makes al the sense in the world to do so. Preserving wealth is just as important as—or even more important than—generating new money, especially now when risk is high due to inflated oil stock prices that have already ""baked in"" the post-COVID rebound."
Oil up by 2$ = red OXYOil drops back 2$ = deep red OXYIt doesn’t deserve green at all..
"I think it's at bottom, I'm in. only 467 shares though, I'll hold for a very long time."
"I do not understand why an A rated company borrows money from Buffett at a higher premium than they could borrow it elsewhere. Either they are not very bright or there is something we don't know about this. The financing makes ZERO sense, especially with 10 billion."
"I am 100% confident we will have a stimulus deal in 24 hours max. longs, are you ready for a Christmas rally??? I am. Mehmet is Santa"

"across the industry, US oil and gas companies have come into the sights of market speculators, who have placed huge bets against equity valuations in the sector. Short sellers have added more than $460m to their short-interest positions since the start of February, according to data from S3 Partners, a research company, the largest move of this kind in the sector since June 2019, when oil prices tumbled into a bear market. In addition, two exchange-traded funds considered proxies for US energy, XOP and OIH, have drawn particular attention from funds seeking to profit from the sector's deepening slump."
I'm buying OXY

cutting by one third leaves close to 2 billion invested in OXY not counting an upside from here.....keep in mind he is not Ray Dalio ..his fund is worth between 17-20 billion so roughly 10% is still OXY and warrants
Was reading that chevron might buy oxy two for one since there were in bidding for andarko too Any thoughts
"Interesting news for the energy sector going forward.JP Morgan Quant Expert predicts Secular Bull Market in oil companies driven by algorithm initiated short squeeze in March 2021JPM quant trading and valuation experts Marko Kolanovic predicts the next 12 years will be the most profitable era for oil investors in the past 100 years due to inflation, the weakening US Dollar (caused by stimulus), a booming stimulus-driven recovery, and under-investment in oil production caused by environmental concerns.The fundamentals will be compounded by automatic trading by algorithm driven super-fast traders called Quants.The market will begin automatically rebalancing out of short positions in mid-March due to the recent rise in energy company stocks, oil prices and excess liquidity.The best picks to cash in on this cycle are $OXY, $XOM, $CVX, $ET, $ERX & $XLE.The following is an excerpt from his article.Quants and Momentum InvestingIn a market where algos and trend-followers have emerged as one of the dominant price-setting forces, it is hardly a surprise that the JPM quant focuses on their influence as the driver behind a commodity supercycle. Indeed, he writes that after ""CTAs played significant role in the 2014 oil price downturn"" more recently, ""CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive.""And since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance, JPM notes that ""a further decline in volatility will likely result in larger and more stable cross-asset quant allocations. A larger momentum impact may affect Energy equities, which is the only sector that still has a strongly negative momentum signal and is hence heavily shorted in the context of factor investing.""That, JPMorgan believes, will ""change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive"" which may be a hint to the redditors out there: if you want to squeeze the systematic shorts, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks to crush the CTAs. You have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor ""will need to rebalance in March by closing ~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding ~2% to energy longs, for a ~22% net buying in Energy.""What is the quantitative significance of these flows? Kolanovic calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about ~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, ""the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn."" As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle.Remarkably, most recently the number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average (note that given the decline of the sector’s weight, energy share prices declined, and the effective $ amount shorted was only 2 times larger). In other words, one doesn't even need to squeeze the shorts: come March - absent some major new crisis - as a result of broader market technicals the prevailing shorts will close them out on their own and go long.Another ""flow factor"" behind the ""supercycle"" is rotation by discretionary funds and retail: In the period from 2010 to 2015, the Energy sector had a 10.6% allocation in conventional equity portfolios. Since then, this has declined to a 3.1% weight currently (Figure 4). The largest decline was in active allocations, which declined from 7% to 1.5% (while passive allocations decreased from 3.6% to 1.8%), which is understandable - investors dumped ""dead stocks"" to chase growth and momentum, but the tide is now turning, and ""any retracement of this decline, on a US equity fund asset base of ~$14T would result in significant inflows and re-pricing.""According to Kolanovic, as economies reopen, inflation moves higher, and yield curves steepen, active funds are expected to first close cyclical shorts, and then rotate from long secular growth towards value and cyclicals. His next point is critical: given that equity assets significantly increased over the last 10 years, and the energy sector significantly decreased, even a small rotation could produce an outsized move."
Winner winner chicken dinner ! I’m reversing opinion & course today and stating I now believe we have seen the bottom . Yep- I said it .
Oil prices fell on concerns of demand. I think way over done. Certainly US demand after elections will start climbing. imo. Dutch
"The Permian is an oil basin that has produced almost a century as a conventional play and now that the shale phenomenon has found the Permian, recent estimates say the Permian rivals Saudi Arabia’s legendary Ghawar field for remaining recoverable resources."
$RIG is a much better oil play than $OXY.
"You can't fight the tape. The trend is your friend my friend and the trend is up. You may not like it and you may think it is all manipulation, but it is what it is: Oil is on an uptrend like a speeding bullet train and standing in front of it will only get you hurt."
"I am new to this and have a question for any Oxy holders. is the warrant worthless until the stock is higher than $22/share. Can you sell the warrant prior to it reaching that? I only have 18 warrants (150 shares). So I would make a bigger profit selling now and buying the stock at a lower price now using cash from selling warrants.... I can see how warrants would be more useful if someone has a bigger volume of shares and they want to buy at 22, when actual stock price is higher....."
"Quad-Witch day will be a one of very specific trading day in last decade.It is the reason than we are experiencing an artificial market manipulation by Short Sellers who have targeted massive amounts of options which will be expired on March 19th.These are last huge batch of options which remains in oil sector.THEY WANA TO KILL OPTIONS AND CAUSE WORTHLESS EXPIRY WITHOUT STOCK CLAIM.There will be a epic battle on Friday.If longs win then we will see one of the biggest historical short squeeze in oil sector history.Just look at to number of short selling for today:XOM: First hand shares for trade:( 9.169M) shares ,Short volume:(5.22M)shares (57% of coming shares for trade)CVX: ( Vol 3.404M) ,(Short 1.492M) ,( 44%)OXY:(Vol 6.157M) ,(Short 3.592M) ,(58%)SU: (Vol 1.992M), (Short 0.616M) , (31%)CLR: (Vol 0.748M) ,( Short 0.366M), (49%)CDEV: (Vol 11.07M) (Short 7.587M) ,(69%)ENB: (Vol 0.845M) ,( Short 0.411M) ,( 49%)CNQ:(Vol 0.52M) ,(Short 0.21M ),( 41%)QEP: (Vol 2.105M),(Short 1.472M),(70%)All other oil sector are same .Remember since a week ago oil price is almost same.COMING FRODAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT DAY.BUY AS YOU CAN ON THIS DAY OR BEFORE FRIDAY.I BELIEVE STARTING NEXT WEEK CURRENT STOCK PRICES WILL BE HISTORY.#XOM, #CVX, #OXY,#SU, #CLR, #CDEV, #ENB, #CNQ, #QEP"
"https://seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4348595-occidental-petroleum-what-icahn-knows-you-dontGood reading for longs. ""No additional debt due in 2020"" so if OXY makes it through 2020, then the company is in great shape. So, Oxy does have great fundamentals if you agree with the author."
"We have lift off... Momentum is shifting. Ride it up into earnings, and beyond! New 52 week highs ahead"
"Hold the line boys. This is just a beginning. With the economy reopening, just wait until everything goes back to normal in Q3. We will see it go above $50. GLTA."
Normally I like called spreads but I’m not looking to hedge the upside here so rolling the dice. Straight up long mixture of stocks and leaps.
and today we found out that the price floor for OXY is $25.
does anyone understand the warrants pricing. seems quite a bit steeper than 22 leaps..
"The earth will be dead, we only have like ten years or something before its too late. GLOBAL WARMING is real and the only way to fix it is to pay more taxes so lets all like save the world. Right like omg."
"Based on today's performance it looks like the street is worried that OXY is going to disappoint again like last quarter's downside surprise!( -47.2% according to Zacks ) If we get a meet or beat on earnings we should get analysts upgrades like APA! Also, resume a more predictable upward trend that coincides with WTI's current price."
Stay strong! 20 inc.
"After hours is a joke, people buying 100-200 shares"
"Occidental can turn things around. First is name change to OXY Energy Resources. Create a green energy division that manufactures patented, state of the art lithium batteries and hydrogen fuel cells. Keep the land resources and incorporate wind and solar farms. Expand into mining of rare earth minerals. Lastly, look at oil for manufacturing green energy components and panels, including solar. If these changes take place OXY could shoot to $100+ per share in the next 2 years."
Volume drying price stabilizing WTI nipping at $43 slow climb to $45 continuesBrent to $45Draw on gasoline and crudeMassive option playGold downOPEC + complying LNG almost to $2.50
"In order to hit $30-$32, which is out immediate high of just a few weeks ago, OIL needs to spring back to the positive narrative. OIL was at $68 for WTI, but more importantly, the narrative was heavy bullish. Now, its the world wants to lock down again. I'm not saying it will or it won't. I'm simply saying the narrative is not the same as it was when OIL was $68. Now, get India past this ugly and sad state of affairs, and OIL will quickly, very quickly rise. But, alas, I don't see C19 settling down by earnings. Therefore I don't see the monster move back to the $40's and $50's any time soon. But, reality is such that, earnings is King. And $60 oil is going to produce $2 billion+. So, IMO, my PT is $28-$30 at earnings and all is predicated on the C19 narrative. If it gets suppressed this summer, then we see $40 by end of summer imo. Now, for my crazy prognostication.Get the C19 behind us and the World Economy is unrestricted? Its $80 oil by end of year and possibly $100+ by end of year. OXY will be pumping 100mboe/quarter and a $100/barrel price? Now we are talking $60 in earnings per barrel minimum. Or better yet, $6billion per quarter. My mid next year the debt retirement will be staggering and the multiples will be getting frothy again. A very real path to $100 next year under those guidelines is doable and most likely inevitable. Aaaaaaaaaand......thats when I leave. We shall see."
"Buffett received 17.3M shares in payment of the quarterly payment of his 8% preferred shares this month. The SEC filing for the issuance of the shares indicated Buffett was going to sell the shares rather than hold (that is either because of his view of the future share price and/or due to the need to avoid the poison pill). As oil continues to trade negative at contract expiration at least through June (nobody has any place to put it and supply still far outpaces demand for the foreseeable future), OXY's stock price will continue to drop. For the next quarterly preferred dividend payment, how many more shares will need to be issued to Buffett in lieu of cash? 25M, 30M, 40M ($5 share price would require at least 40M shares)? What happens to the share price if/when Buffett sells those on the open market also?Lots of additional shares hitting the market in the coming months. You are about to see the definition of a feedback loop. You've been warned."
"All of you guys need to pull up a five year chart for crude....right now pretty much up there...when I posted at zero I expected 50-55 at this point..The problem with many boards it that they are loaded with daytraders that spend their time telling you to buy or sell every time there is a small move either way...first of all posts here dont move a stock....SO LETS TALK REAL NUMBERS...before covid and 5 billion more in debt ago this traded in the mid 40s or higher with 4.4 billion more in expenses due to the dividend and capex and oil was trading between 54 and 60 ....Opec has made it very clear that they like oil at higher levels 55-65 ...almost all US companies if not all are not increasing drilling and have gone on record that profits will go toward debt and investors...vaccines are cranking out and US PRODUCTION IS DOWN ABOUT2- 3 MILLION BARRELS per day in addition to opec..opec plus is down also....jetfuel is about 10-12% of fuel demand and if you call any travel chain flights are booking heavily for the the second half..so demand will spike much further...their foray into carbon capture should out them in a favorable light with the new administration....REMEMBER REAL INVESTORS..there are blatant day trader posts and then the less obvious ones..they were here since oxy was 9 apa 4 xom 30 bp 17 cqp 18 ...many of them are buying and selling I call option or 1 put option..you can see the trades... EVEN AT 55 BASED ON WHAT THEY SAID they will have free cash flow of3.5-4 billion ...thats at 55 ..look at the cqp or lng board..people talk about terminal traffic number of lng cargoes...spot prices around the world....where the freights are going weather that affect spot prices,,,you know investment s.... for those of you who daytraded and ,,,,,,,up on most trades...just think what you would have now if you bought May 21 10 calls when this was 9 for less than 2$"
Would love to rocket through $30 and take out 52 week high!! $46 midterm target.
"Hollub and gang made a deal with Anardarko that is borderline criminal in my mind. I own 800 shares of OXY and it's a good percentage of my exposure to investment...outside my 401K. This move by her and the BOD was an overnight shock to me, but it's the way it was done by taking a loan from Buffett to avoid my say in the matter via vote. I am angry and feel betrayed. I will not get out now because it's too late, but when given the chance will vote out every current board member OXY has!"
Oxy has a comfortable hedge position...and in some weeks oil will be up back to 50
"One of OXY's problem is they are always talking about lower production and not how to build production higher . Look at some of the smaller companies moving higher , CPE, SM ,CDEV trying to increase production, OXY has had a good move but the smaller have done better lately ( I am in all four ) . But OXY needs to have a positive CC on what the company is about , oil production isn't that why they bought ( at a very high price ) APC. If OXY can not make a profit in the first quarter they will be stuck where they are at , oil has been well over 50 the whole 1st quarter. And what did she talk about , how oil production will never come back instead of how to try to improve production . Thats one reason OXY drops at a higher % wise than the other oils , look at the last few weeks and the 4+% drops OXY has had. OXY need more than just higher oil prices , give some positive news , a major property sell to lower debt , a profit to raise the dividend to .10 or more to start nothing crazy . With the properties they have a profit should be made very easy with all cuts they have ."
8.8B in divestments over 2 years verses the 10-15B that was supposed to happen in a few months.
HEY PEOPLE THE KING IS NAKED. OCCIDENTAL OIL IS IN TECHNICAL BANKRUPTCY WITH 41.5 BILLION US DOLLARS DEBT WHICH IT CANNOT PAY
buy CPE. ramping up
Me. Vicki to the OXY shareholders.Who knew ?
"Our point? We do not believe Occidental has liquidity risk; at a minimum the rebound at the front of the oil curve has materially improved free cash flow—but with the mostly likely risk that management may incur higher cost debt, which may no longer be the case,” he wrote."
"When oil falls below $45, then Oxy recieves a $10.00 premium over what it is trading at up to 300000 barrels a day. So oils at $33 right now so they would get $43. This is a great hedge and real smart."
Looks like a small pullback. Great time to use my recently received dividend to buy more.
hi longs well done. but I sold half my positions today after accumulating more than 50000 shares. I don't think opec did the right thing by pushing back production increases to April. the market was expecting 1 to 1.5 million increase and they decided not to increase at all. this could hurt the economy before it fully recovers as consumer spending reels from higher energy prices
Oxy likely to become insolvent Bond holders firstPreferred shareholder Common stock holders bottom of list
"As OXY plows to and through $22, how high can we expect the warrant to go? Will it cap at $22? I am an amateur that stumbled upon OXY and have made a nice little pile of greenbacks for myself. I dont play the options market and admittedly dont know much. I have several thousand warrants at an average of 4.70."
oxy is making a turn. Held up on a down day. Should move up into earnings.Ya think???
Thanks for that .04 dividend! Gonna hit the dollar menu later today!
"You can imagine how much the profit will be in 1st quarter and year 2021, A massive boost. Or me strong buy, the last opportunity to get shares at this bargain level."
$24 and change......
I bought at morning price 17.50 1500 share I lost lot b of money I am useing margin which date is ex dividends I b bought today I am getting dividends
"Something doesn't add up, If OXY paid Buffett by common shares why the price of shares went down rather than going up?"
"Joined the earning late, did they mention about where they see oil price going this year and reminded how it will help in handling the debts?"
Why is OXY taking such a big hit today??????
"How is this jobs report a surprise....no one wants to work under these policies when your paid to stay home lol, ill bet 6 figures on the expiration of the benefits around september that october breaks the historical record lol this is so petty."
Sector down because the MUMMY is going to lift sanctions on Iran and allow the terrorists to sell oil on the free market! He never in-forced the sanctions in the first place. Iran has been selling to China all along. Those are the rumblings circulating now!!!!!!!!!
I just heard Taiwan is blocking Suez. Gota eat Taiwanese food today to thank them as a OXY shareholder.
Shorts Suzanne and Mehmet
It doesn’t make sense the industry is up 1 percent and we are stuck
At this rate WTI will be back at $65.00 soon.
Up $2.01 this week. Be patient longs
API - 12.8 million barrels crude Build & 13.3 million barrel gasoline & distillate draw with over 50% of refineries closed....VERY BULLISH
"Honestly, I just broke even today. I bought OXY during the peak in June. All this time, I didn't sell my share even when it dipped below $8 because I know SP will go up as soon as the market reopens. I will be holding my position through 2021. Cheers!!"
Why are oil and gas stocks doing well today when oil is down almost to $40 again?
"OXY is one of my best long term holds. No matter what the stock price is, I get 11.6 % annual returns through dividends and selling weekly covered calls. The only way I’d lose this cash cow is if the company went completely bankrupt."
"Over pay top executives, Specially the CEO."
***** crude oil takes a dip....... but oil investors don't give a flip.... XOM news lifts the whole boat....... against the tide at against the wind*****deepsub
"***** LQQK for at least double volume today by the close......OXY was way oversold...... I still feel we we'll see $45/bbl WTI price by XMAS...... there will be some tax-loss selling but expect OXY to hit $20 per share within 30 days after New year's day...... but then, I am the eternal optimist...*****deepsub"
The delay in the earnings announcement will also also OXY leadership more time to discern the impact of rising oil prices on present profitability and current quarter financial strength. Hopefully they will provide strong guidance during the earnings call on Feb. 22nd
"Today and Tomorrow $CPEWHY? profits every year, low PE 2,2. Target price 4-7, phenomenal 1Q 2020"
I am Mehmet’s father. I apologize on his behalf. I found multiple screen names on his computer. My son earned $15USD by scamming an old woman out of a gift card. He used it to sell OXY short. He doesn’t have the money to cover and nobody believes he’s an IRS agent. Please go easy on him.
Saudi cut oil production oil prices going up even on a red day today. Good news for any energy stock.
Earnings estimates revised downward almost 49% in just the last 30 days . Get ready for the $30’s .
let's see what happens when the naked short sellers are forced to buy back
"Dow chemical had blow out quarter, higher guidance and down 5% right now. Absolutely no bad news. Markets are clueless."
Oxy is not make or break in one day of trading.
Here comes the low carbon project BS. Blah Blah Blah.
"I was offline for awhile, what made the stock price go up right after 1PM?"
"Like I mentioned before 1. historically speaking oxy has never been below 30 dollars with wti higher than 50. 2. The company will be able to reduce its debt by anywhere from 6 to 9billion dollars this year (4 bil fcf, 2 bil cash, 3 bil asset divesture) so long as wti remains above 60. 3. This pandemic will likely be under control with vaccination by the end of the year. 4. No. The world has not changed and the majority of people still do not drive electric vehicle nor do they have financial mean to purchase one. 5. Hedges against inflation and oil stocks are the best performing stocks during reflation period and economic growth."
1 penny dividend announcement should be in next few days some time
"Talk about high speed trading. Algos, sector wide."
Conflict with iran. That should add $50 to the current share price.
"A note from RBC saying that competing bids for APC are unlikely...03:06 PM EDT, 04/15/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Anadarko Petroleum (APC) is unlikely to receive any competing bids after Chevron's (CVX) takeover offer made last week, and shareholders will probably approve the $65-a-share deal, RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Monday.The bank's analysts, Scott Hanold and Brad Heffern, opted to lower their rating on Anadarko to sector perform from outperform, and cut their price target to be in line with the takeoever bid of $65, from a target of $74 previously.Chevron made the overture to The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko, offering shareholders 0.3869 of a Chevron share and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share, implying a transaction structure of 75% stock and 25% cash, RBC said. On Monday, CNBC reported that Occidental Petroleum (OXY) had been making a play with in an offer that reached the mid-$70s per share, with 40% in cash.""We think that APC ultimately chose CVX for its synergies, structure with its balance sheet, and potential longer-term benefits to its shareholders,"" Hanold and Heffern said. ""The offer from OXY is reported to have required shareholder approval, whereas CVX's required only board of directors approval. We do not anticipate any additional competing offers.""The transaction implies a $61-a-barrel price for West Texas Intermediate, ""consistent with the three-year oil price strip, and provides reasonable value for APC shareholders given current market conditions.""RBC said the broader US exploration and production sector has lagged oil prices this year, and that's starting to be noticed by investors. ""The acquisition appears to indicate that the industry has noticed the implicit value in many of the US E&Ps,"" the analysts said.Anadarko's shares have fallen behind peers even more over the past year amid concerns over changes in Colorado that could affect the DJ Basin, which the company calls a key focus area, as well as costs for its liquefied natural gas plant in Mozambique.""We expect the peer group to appreciate favorably with higher oil prices but APC upside is limited given the acquisition offer by CVX,"" RBC said.Price: 62.27, Change: +0.49, Percent Change: +0.79http://www.mtnewswires.com Copyright  2019 MT Newswires.

Maybe Buffett will get Oxy and Phillips 66 to merge creating a new integrated major after this deal is done !
"Today's price performance is very disappointing!!!! Oil futures up, oil inventories down, oil stocks down."
"Yup! From today:""The company's market cap is under $20 billion, but its enterprise value is more than $67 billion. Investors who didn't mind betting on a leveraged oil stock were rewarded handsomely as OXY shares more than doubled since the end of September. Multiple insiders purchases OXY shares earlier this year, some of whom paid as much as $33 for these shares. If the demand for oil and oil prices continue to recover, OXY shares could double again and still be cheaper than it was 12 months ago."""
"At oil's current pricing of $42+ and OXY's current break even at roughly $25, there is a $17/barrel profit built in currently. At 1.3 million barrels/day thats $22.1 million/day in profit. Or $663 million per month. Or $7.956 billion in profit/yr. This is what B of A is referencing. Of course, no Capex must be implemented and pricing must continue to be stable and firming. Next weeks CC is going to be quite telling. Of course its going to be bad. But, the divvy is all but gone now and Capex has dropped off a cliff. Salaries have been squeezed. I would be shocked like everyone else if OXY beat in a large way. Cant see it happening. But, I can see $42 being much higher than -$37. Oil has been in the tank until June. Only then was it 'profitable'. Another thing, oil isnt going down in the toilet this time around. Production is way too low. Its about 25% of a year ago. SA has slowed shipping. Production has finally come down to consumption. I mentioned that these numbers would pass in the night some weeks ago. We are here. The pain hasn't been realized because inventory is still remarkably high. But, the draw down is going to pick up steam over the next 4-6 weeks. By the time Mr. Market becomes comfortable with inventory, IMO it will corollate with timing of election, it will be too late. Overall production will have dropped to well below consumption, and inventory will be low enough to cause concern. Then the Capex destruction now being implemented across the board will rear its ugly head. Oil will embark on a powerful Bull run. The pain will be next summer. USA will be importing oil to keep up. Oil at $60 by year end and $70/$80 by summer 2021.If OXY escapes BK, they already have IMO, then this scenario creates a path to reinstituting divvy in 12 months. Lose $6 billion in assets=$30 billion in debt. Pay down $5 billion=$25 billion in debt. 8% bond payments is $2 billion. This leaves $5 billion for Capex and divvy. $1 divvy, $2.5 for Capex, and that leaves $1.5 billion or so to pad the bank account. Thats all at $42/barrel. Add another $1 million+/day per $1 of oil or $365 million+/year. Dont know the production reduction on sold assets, so just referencing 1 million barrels/day. Get oil to $50 by year end and you add another $3 billion in FCF. Now the assets become full priced, and the debt rating becomes extremely favorable. $25/barrel breakeven. $50 oil. $25/barrel profit. 1.1 million barrel+ per day. $10 Billion + in FCF. The potential is staggering if Vicki can withhold the divvy payments and retain assets as much as possible. Wade through this storm and the payout will be staggering."
"Well maybe next quarter. Oil at $64 give or take OXY is still under $30. Remember the days of $70 and higher and a nice ""safe"" divy? Give the board a raise."
Oxy keeps floating favorable media blitz about their illustrious CEO; trying to portray her as a caring CEO. These moves just support their initial intent of bypassing us shareholders; they know best! B#$%$^
"If history repeat itself the market is due another crash, energy sector was declining in a similar way couple of months ahead of feb crash....hope am wrong..."
They underestimate the power of pent up demand. My condo is in downtown right in front of beach. Every weekend I see literally hundreds of people outside. Once air travel opens up for Europe and NA. People will travel and drive around a lot more than during pre-pandemic.
"My fellow OXYs,1. Quote: ""OPEC Agrees to Deeper Cuts Ahead of Aramco IPO...."" from the Wall Street Journal2. So, OXY stock should go UP? Time to buy?3. Here's the article: https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-agrees-to-deeper-cuts-ahead-of-aramco-ipo-11575570843Peace!"
Oh boy 30 here we come!!
everyone is globall selling OIL STOCKS
Serious advise please bought last week 5k shares of oxy on margin at the price of $14.25 do you think the stock will be safe after the oil cut. Or should I take profits tomorrow hoping it gaps up and call it good.
OXY has kind of forced me to be day trader rather than invest for long term.I expect OXY to be above 22.25 today.Yesterday had cashed out 23.30Today bought at 20.95 trying to decide what would be the exit point!May sell short term calls for 22.50 strike and hang on to shares.Any suggestions?
7 billion free cash flow at these levels..instead of just posting like parrots about debt...do some real research....for the hundredth time since 10 a share..they have cut capex and the divident saving about 6 billion and that still leaves 2 more billion in capex which they can drop....so with 9 billion in potential earnings you thinks that the debt is an issue...Timeline...oil went to zero..I posted many times that Russian and the Saudis cannot afford it either....next posted that cuts would be extreme and quick...next posted 30-45 days brent would be 40..next posted that capex would be cut and save billions for debt...after oil move posted that the brokerage houses all bet wrong and needed time to fix their house then upgrade....upgrades starting...said that you know that assets will be sold to handle next years maturities and ....guys when the first maturity gets handles and when oil stays moves even a little more this will have 7-9 eps THATS STRONG MY FRIENDS
Someone is behind dragging the price down. It is not normal CVX is up for last three days and OXY was down for the same days. I smell the flavor of acquiring OXY. Even the price of oil is down it is not legitimate to have only OXY price down in the whole sector. It is more than 30% down in one month. It is strange as something being cooked.
Patiently waiting for $35
Been waiting for this 30 blockade for a year
"Very good chance OXY will be below 16 by the weekend , nothing new to push it higher but more news to drive it lower . Unemployment , oil surplus , demand going lower , possible new shutdowns or slowdowns , unemployment payment look to end or be cut below 600 per week extra and increase production from OPEC+ starting next month"
"OXY is strong, very strong..."
"Love, seeing $MRO back to pre-pandemic pricing. If $MRO can do it, so can OXY. Onward and upward"
Fundamentals mean nothing in a crash and that's what we have now. For the first time in months stocks have come off unsustainable levels. Specific groups of stocks like oil have been hit unreasonably hard and the genie in the bottle has come out as the momentum selling has kicked in. So much of investing is passive and when the indexes get slammed all the stocks in those indexes get crushed. It's extremely difficult to be an active investor under these circumstances. As this plays out you need to be a buyer. Your portfolio is going to look like hell for some time....
"sorry folks, but if crude drops down to low sixties, then oxy gals back to 24 and change... that's just the way it is....."
The refi of the debt and maintaining the divvy were mutually exclusive. If the 21-22 maturities are pushed out the stock will rebound.
"Oxy is in the Netherlands right now, why?? Thats where Royal Dutch Shell is located.Oxy's plane was in Omaha 2 weeks ago and that equaled the Berkshire deal.Oxy's plane then flew to Paris and that equaled the Total deal.My guess is either Friday or Monday there is some deal with Shell.It used to be follow the money, now its follow the plane!!!"
"a huge bullish reason to buy and keep OXY now is its low carbon business could be separated from OXY through IPO. those belong to clean energy, which has much higher valuation."
I bought OXY and OXY/WS today. I am hoping to be able to buy some more of both tomorrow if the price is right.
Insiders buying a lot and someone bought 3 million shares just after open this am. Interesting.$xle $feny $xom $oxy
BAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM Oh my! OXY to the moon!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies fell by 2.6 million barrels for the week ended April 2, according to sources. The data also reportedly showed gasoline stockpiles up nearly 4.6 million barrels, while distillate inventories rose by 2.8 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub, meanwhile, were little changed, down 84,000 barrels for the week, sources said. Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday. The EIA is expected to show crude inventories down by 700,000 barrels, according to IHS Markit.

"Guys Relax, all the oil stocks are near their june high! Oxy is going to be atleast $24 today!"
Please donate to my kind friend Mehmet who lost all grandma's savings. Thank you
Back to $32 after May 10 report. Partial dividend reinstated for investors because of higher oil prices. It shows investors it can pay down debt as well.
I’m strongly buying
I think the market is reacting more to the decision not to sell Algerian assets as promised. If I live through this....
***** continuing higher in A/H trading......she just---doesn't---want---to---stop*****deepsub
OXY price movement lately is like watching paint dry .
Run is over.
"Yesterday was a real puzzle - the market was up as was oil somewhat substantially. The entire oil sector stocks were up around 2% and meanwhile OXY was down 2%. I looked for news all day on why this was. Today I see Barons had a article on investors being concerned about losing the ""juicy dividend"". So let me understand the week: Earnings are announced the stock pops to almost $45 but drops after they talk about a cut in CAPEX leading to a cut in production for the purpose of saving the dividend. So the stock drops to around $42. Now the threat of a dividend cut sends it to $38.50 intraday. I think yesterday was a big overreaction and unless there is more news, investors can pick up stock at a nice discount. Get them while quantities last!"
The MM’s give us a five cent hope! Lol
Crude oil prices rose further today after the Energy Information Administration reported an oil inventory draw of 6.1 million barrels for the week to December 25.
9x earnings and a six percent divi. Its like buying an ice cream cone for a nickel.

building the bottom just as I noted - you see how it popped back as support is coming in for 2020. Smart money flow not panic sellers and short-sighted investors. With TRUMP out of office America will be free and markets will surge led by the democrats infrastructure build. It will be beautiful to watch both Trumps collapse back into the swamp with Nunes and the rest of the swamp-minions. I knew I was right about them. China will wait for them to be gone and then work a the deal. Boolean
"Folks, a lot of talking here about ceo, APC purchase, debt, etc. you don’t need to keep saying the same stuff over and over again. Everyone in the whole world already aware of it and the stock Is way too much discounted for it. Now this is all about oil markets and Covid-19."
"If your short, you will be getting a sick feeling in the pit of your stomach and the options action should tell you there is a good reason for it. Rising oil prices and rising stock price projections by major analyst increase the likelihood of a serious squeeze."
Time is on our side. Stay long and Stay strong. CHEERS!!
OCCIDENTAL WILL GO 75% MORE THAN BELOW 9 US DOLLARS IN 2 MONTHS TIME
"There taking all the gains!!!!!Oil fell below $66.00/barrel, triggered sell programs. Sector wide!"
"Change name to Accidental Petroleum, please."
"There are only two reasons for it to be down* First, the market was pricing in an accretive deal and now the accretive deal is gone. * Second, the market is pricing in that OXY will now attempt to overpay, either for APC or for something else such as PXD.I think the second is more likely, but not really sure."
You can thank Europe for locking down again even with vaccines. The real test will be tomorrow to see if oil reserves go up for 6 weeks in a row or finally down one week
I SOLD MY ALL OCCIDENTAL STOCK AT 31 US DOLLARS. OCCIDENTAL IS BOUGHT BANKRUPT AND ITS SHARE PRICE IS BLOCKED BY STOCK BROKERS. THE CAP IS AT 31 US DOLLARS. ITS STILL NOT TOO LATE TO SELL. OCCIDENTAL WILL GO BELOW 15 US DOLLARS BEFORE JUNE 2021
I love u guys!
"Im quite amazed this went up on Friday, presumably due to a CEO pay cut. Oil was trading in the $17, thats gonna have far, FAR more impact than a measly few million $ pay cut. I was bullish here when OXY touched $12 range weeks ago, took some pain but ended up selling at $16. I am gonna be short on Monday, and I rarely go short... unless we get some kind of bailout, this is gonna drop like a rock."
I have balanced my portfolio. OXY and my other oil holdings are giving me lots of stress. I think it is better to stay away from internet and come back next year.
"FCF positive, not selling assets for cheap, maintaining production in 2021 while paying down debt. i like the gem of Algeria, sounds like they found something big there."
Anyone got predictions on where WTI opens later after OPEC and Russia agree to keep the cuts at 9.5 in July.Im think a gap up of $2 straight to 41/42. Oxy probably opeing up at least 20% higher tomorrow.
I expect OXY will go to $22 in the next two months. Once the vaccine is being distributed things should go to normal very fast. I expect oil to go over $50 in the next few months.
"As long as oil doesn’t crater the tax selling will abate before Xmas and the shorts will need to move on. Don’t sell your shares on the first bump to 40, you will regret it."
OXY could see a fast run up to $35 from here . The pause on oil is past
Don't sell...spend the rest of this session sitting on your hands OK...thanks. Boolean
"Wow. I swear to god never to watch CNBC again. I got suckered in by the green in a sea of red and shorters. I’m learning. It’s painful, but I’m learning. Another bag to hold."
"FWIW..... according to Zacks, earnings expectations for OXY are for a loss of a dollar 66 cents per share...... approximately 43% higher then earlier expectations. I read similar earnings expectations on the CNN & WSJ websites..... maybe some optimism is starting to come forward ahead of earnings for the second quarter...!??!"
"U.S. oil exports to China are set to reach a record next month in a sign that Beijing is stepping up purchases to meet its commitments under a landmark trade deal reached earlier this year.Chinese crude buyers have chartered about 19 tankers for September to send roughly 37 million barrels of oil to China, according to provisional tanker fixtures. If these proceed as planned, the exports would surpass a record set in May at 35.2 million barrels, according to U.S. Census data compiled by Bloomberg. The May volume was also the most by any U.S. oil buyer for a given month, data show.Under phase one of the deal, the world’s largest oil importer promised to buy an additional $200 billion of U.S. goods and services in 2020 and 2021, including $52 billion in energy products, in an agreement signed in January. Purchases so far have lagged that target. A review of the deal that was set for for August 15 was canceled, and has yet to be rescheduled.@ Bloomberg"
I just have to mention Oxy low carbon ventures Again! At some point anyone who is shorting OXY will get burned. Carbon capture will be a massive industry and Oxy has positioned themselves right for it. Good luck to those who continue to short. All the best with your exit strategy.
"So, Oil charges towards 48... OXY gets upgraded by major investment bank and stock takes a dive.. I'm done trying to make sense of any of this....."

Big bull coming here lol close up those manipulation shorts
The climb to 23 by year's end continues today.
OXY is offering 57 billion for APC when the oxy market cap is 47 billion at the present time. Their debt is under 10 billion but will grow another 29 billion with the acquisition. They are paying way too much for a company that cannot even make money. They have been efficient and should let CVX overpay and if they want to acquire another company make sure that it makes sense.
"Imagine when US receives stimulus cheques March 29? OXY, BTE, SU Baby!"
Would someone come in and potentially buy the new OXY/APC (assuming the deal goes through)?
Wow..dent purchase....good.....will help the share price and shows oxys solid liquidity position.
API shows oil inventory were a draw down of $1 million barrels versus an expected build.
This should be at “least” $40.00

"Oil Set for Best Week Since Early March on Better Demand OutlookAlex Longley and Jack WittelsFri, April 16, 2021, 9:02 AM(Bloomberg) ""Futures in New York rose on Friday and are up more than 7% this week. China’s economy soared in the first quarter, while the country’s refiners processed more than 14 million barrels a day in March. A Chinese mega-refiner and some Japanese oil companies have also been snapping up crude cargoes, boding well for the physical market.Positive signs from Asia follow a pick-up in the U.S. this week. Data in recent days showed jobless claims falling to a new pandemic-era low, housing starts rebounding and gasoline demand expanding. The global market may see a temporary lull due to new virus outbreaks, according to the the International Energy Agency, but the agency followed OPEC in boosting its full-year estimates for consumption.“Given the improving outlook for the world’s two biggest economies, there is little chance of the market’s feel-good glow being extinguished anytime soon,” said PVM Oil Associates analyst Stephen Brennock.$CDEV $MRO $OXY $XOM $LPI"

"April was brutal for OXY due to Icahn's selling. Thank God, he is done with selling (as per his SEC filing on 4/29). He has sold close to 30 million shares in April. Hopefully May will be a great month for OXY. Icahn was reducing his over exposure and also taking some profits for the shares he bought at $10 a share."

"The very first stock I ever bought was a 1982 and believe it or not it was an oil services related company, western something a rather and it went bankrupt because I didn’t know what the F I was doing, but since 1995 I have predicted the markets like I wrote the book (i’m a slow learner)"
"If you look at OXY, you’ll see it’s been locked to front crude (which by the way is giving you a chance to buy a buck and a half under where crude will pull it to today). Eventually this lock breaks and OXY rallies to closer to where it belongs. Most likely we start to ramp up as we approach earnings."
for the next six months they are deep into profit...340 thousand barrels hedged plus so they are making about 23$ a barrel profit...cash flow positive at about 31 realized price for hedged oil 54...on the balance even the reduced production is about 900 million barrels are a price of about 44..so another 900 thousand barrels per day at 13$ per barrel profit about 12 million more per day so added to the 7 billion per day its about 19 million per day profit...cash flow positive ..so about 2.85 billion operating cash by year end no including the past 30-45 days ....when the hedge drops their daily cash flow will to 16 million per day of cash less any cap ex..which they did mention would resume at a lower level.. as you can see the doom that most SHORT SELLING PUT BUYERS POST HAVE NO SUBSTANCE..the cloud is over the industry right now..but very soon out of pure greed the fund managers will drop into the the pounded down oil sector to get their % gains for their bonuses..tech stocks as a whole are up 35-50%...

The black cloud overhanging the oil market has been lifted. Maybe now OXY can resume an upward trend???
They are not going to address the fall in share price?
"Just a reminder to all OXY longs - Buffet still holds $10 billion of Occidental's preferred shares, plus warrants to buy 83.86 million shares of OXY stock at an exercise price of $59.62. With his investment in Chevron, the signal that he is bullish on oil is clear."
Anyone long on this?
Jefferies chief tech analyst on cnbc looked shocked...stated that everyone was caught off guard about the rout of tech and stay at home...really pes were 100-1000 for months and months ...said that it could last for months...THINK ABOUT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OR MORE PULLED OUT ...where can they go for big % gains....not much out there ...this industry still have a healthy list of stocks that are still 50% below pre covid and oil is higher than pre covid....the shock will set in and people will go to cash on tech and stay at home....and very soon all that capital will re deployed
if this was such a bad deal why haven't all the institutional shareholders pulled out?
https://7stocks.com/occidental-petroleum-dividends-are-safe-even-if-oil-price-plunges-to-40-a-barrel/
Don't be blinded by Total's focus of short fall of 10 million bbl/day by 2025. It's better to under produce than over produce. US oil producers should not invest and try to raise production for the next three years until oil at 100+ for three years.
"$1.6B operating cash flow for Q3. They increased working capital by $829M, which brings down OCF to $815M. Excluding CapEx, free cash flow is about $600M, at realized oil price of only $38. Not too bad!"
given that the pandemic is now showing a downward direction values will rise across the industry so any investment in oil right now will soon have great increasing value.
Is this a good investment. I already checked somethings but want opinions
Why there is no reaction from the stock price even after hearing the land sale. Is it a bad deal?
thank you for those who sold your shares to me at 26.50
"oxy will never go bankrupt. They are too vital asset to US economy. The government will never let that happen. Plus, with oil above $40 they are profitable company. Good luck everybody."

Right now you have loss in papers only.don't Turn paper loss into real loss by selling your stock."

"Dean.... poison pill is 2 thwart a hostile takeover. There are a number of different strategies to fend off an unwanted suitor. In the OXY case, steps are already underway starting with the increase of outstanding shares making it more expensive for the acquirer the act of paying off Uncle Buffy with shares instead of cash this makes it more expensive also for the potential acquirer I even as it dilutes the shares outstanding. Then we have the new warrants being issued to existing shareholders as of July 6th which makes the shareholders part of the poison pill when they exercise the warrants and drive the cost again up for The unwanted acquirer....so as we gain these warrants we become an essence part of the poison pill and in defense of the company strange that nobody nobody has mentioned this possibility or probability so far interesting I guess huh?"
How does everyone feel the earning call today will go? Should it push up higher or maybe lower for a second? I want to add more and just wondering what everyone thought
"WTF? OXY management couldn't put a package together on their own and are resorting to have employees identify the number of months base salary they're willing to except for voluntary separation!(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp is offering its employees voluntary buyouts over the next two weeks, according to a document seen by Reuters on Tuesday, citing the sharp decline in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic for ""severe dislocations"" in its business.Occidental bet heavily on the continued growth in U.S. shale oil, taking on heavy debts for its controversial purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year for $38 billion. That bet has proved ill-timed following the coronavirus outbreak, which has cut fuel demand worldwide by about 30% and is responsible for the worst oil-and-gas-industry downturn in 40 years.Energy companies worldwide, including Exxon Mobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell PLC , have slashed capital expenditures and oil output to reckon with the pandemic.Houston-based Occidental last week posted a $2 billion quarterly loss and has slashed capital spending drastically to shore up its balance sheet. The company said that if spending cuts are not met, it will have ""serious potential consequences"" to the company, the document said.Interested employees can submit a resignation offer to Occidental through May 26, specifying the number of months of base salary that they will accept for voluntary separation, according to the document. Employees can amend or withdraw offers unless the company has already accepted them by then, the document said. Offers not accepted will expire automatically on June 12.Occidental declined to comment."

"OXY seems to reversing yesterday's puzzling drop - oil and market up OXY down. Today we have the opposite; OXY up for now Oil and Market very weak. Is this all on the ""Icahn Effect"" or is there more to the story. Because buying seems to be a good way to go, today."
Would unprecedent chemical price will offset unprecedent winter damage for OXY?
Ridicolous valuation. Free Cashflow about 7 billion usd so Bank of America. At this oil price level oxy was at 35 USD before crises begin. With its additional +10 USD hedge oxy is more than safe and I am sure we will see an asset sale too....I guess the Oman assets with about 1 billion usd and the adurcan assets to Chinese petro companies at about 8 billion USD. We will see a price jump to 35 -40 usd at this moment. I am adding shares at this garbling level. I am wondering about the fall yesterday and today premarket session. But stay cool and add...so like big Hedgefonds are doing.....some are speculating for a purchase by chevron...maybe ..but never atbthismlevel...40 usd plus would be the minimum.
Natural gas now up over 6.0%
in the first 30 minutes of trading today oxy showed where it wanted to go....... I want to see $17 today.... got a few cold ones in the fridge and ready to POP a TOP..... at closing time !!!
I look at the options and I see that the expiring $30 calls had an open interest of 7198 yesterday. I would not be surprised if all of these were executed pre-market and then the resulting stock sold this morning pre-market. Today could be the first Friday in a long time where the tail does not wag the dog.
Much like predicted people repositioned for end of month and qtr. Next month watch out!
Personally I’d like to see OXY back like it was - trading UP on UP days . But everything has changed now and not for the better .
OIL STOCKS INCLUDING SHELL BP OCCIDENTAL ARE ALL CEILING PRICE FIXED STOCKS SINCE COVID STARTED
"Oil HedgingOccidental increased its 2020 volume of hedged oil production by 50,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) to 350,000 BOPD representing a significant portion of 2020 oil production. The incremental oil hedges were structured as three-way costless collars to provide enhanced cash flow in a low oil-price environment while preserving significant upside in higher price scenarios. For every $1 increase in oil prices, Occidental’s free cash flow increases by $260 million per annum. In a low oil-price environment, Occidental’s 2020 hedging program enhances cash flow to support its dividend during the post-acquisition transitional period."
wow..oil is deadoxy has 1 day in the sun
Just buy the dips while we climb up to $35
oil price drop is about the fact that they are guessing that chinas oil buying spree settle back to a more normal level??? so even though putting reserves away removes glut the real market is about consistent demand and supposedly the russians and saudis say the world is back to 90%...so yes we wanted the stock rebound faster but now I guess we have to tack on few extra months...vaccines and therapies will all be hitting soon and the world will be back to almost 1005 demand...oil production is way down..just take each company one by one and you can easily see..BP XOM CVX OXY APA and ALL THE LITTLE GUYS IN THE US...Canada way down ...Norway..Mexico...opec mainly Russia and the Saudis....non one is jumping back reopening wells in at these prices so in the next several months oil should start to really move...
"any thoughts on Q1 natural gas realizations? on slide 20 of Q4 deck it showed they had a collar on prices but MRO released impressive numbers on NG, DVN not so much"
"this could be great for OXY, now they can buy back shares and be more selective if a buyout looks ok as it requires share holderapproval. PDX which is finally causing cost cutting will help companies to get in a positive cash flow condition for once in manyyears. Companies that are not in good form will not be attractive."
WTI $61.94/barrel curtesy of Obiden & Company!!
"As I said before, now that we closed the gap on the chart at $26.27, there is MO resistance until the $40 area. We could go straight to $40 now with the strong oil market."
Crude will hit $65 much sooner than later. Oxy has a history of been an amazing company. In due time this merger will prove that it was the right one to make. You have to give it a chance.
You know this can go to 30 in a New York minute!

W Buffet sold Delta at $21. And lost a ton on others. He is no genius
"Two more points1. 5.8 million shares with today's price is 5.8million * 14 = ~81million. So for this quarter, instead of getting $200million dividend, Buffet got only $81million, which is about 3.25% annual dividend rate, not the 8% he was hoping for.2. If OXY goes belly up, the debt has priority over preferred shares. So, how much of the $10B Buffet can get back is a big question."

"Has there been any indication as to when OXY will increase its dividend? I don't expect it to go back to previous levels for quite some time, but it seems to me that it should be able to afford a larger dividend now that the oil price is up."
"Hey y'all, I'm Gil, new here, just bought a little yesterday. In case y'all are curious on the mindset of an outsider, I'm buying in now because I see oil coming back strong nearing the end of the summer/beginning of winter as everyone will be traveling and COVID vaccines will be widely dispersed and all. We shall see. Happy New Year!"

They have indentified over 50 carbon companies that can get tax credits to build plants and then OXy would pipe it to the permian and use the co2 for oil recovery ...where they have infrastructure to bury the co2 deep in the ground...THIS WILL BE MASSIVE WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION...

Goldman Sachs cuts OXY to 31.00 from 35.00 maintains neutral rating.
"One thing that comes up now an then is the fact that OXY/APC shared the same auditing firm. This may or may not be a significant consideration, but most large audit firms not only do audits they also do consulting. So regarding the quality of the assets purchased and their relative value - either as items to be divested or to harvest free cash - I have to believe OXY Mgmt. knew all the variations on a sensitivity analysis exercise. In the end it comes down to the price of oil. At $55 holders s/b very comfortable with their investment long term despite the current market cap."
I’m in! For the win!
Did WTI get to 70 yet? :)
Fake news deep state fake pipeline hack is paying off some well connected insiders. The biggest danger is do the Democrats think Great Depression II is their ticket to permanent power. They claim to hate oil. But if the status quo holds they are big oils best friend.

"Garbage!! oil price going up, all oil companies recovery. but look at this garbage. continue lossibg money! !don't know the board working on!!"
Oil stocks like this one are about to blow up higher don’t miss out! Oil is at the highest level in 2 years! Suncor just reported blow out earnings to kick of earnings season for this space don’t miss out!
It’s really hard to bottom pick a company hitting 13 year lows .It’s even harder to buy a company with management like this.Icahn is trapped. No magic to work here. OXY May drop by another half from here and that’s with Texas crude around 50$.
I'm not accepting this long term. Give her a month and we'll be booming.
Icahn’s plan was to reduce his position by up to 1/3. As of yesterday his position dropped from 89M to 73M stocks. He still has 10 - 13M to dump as per his initial plan... I hope he is done with selling OXY....
"It’s a strong buy, trading is strong and mostly on the buy side!"
"no worry, longs! as long as wti over 60$ and tiny volumes ...you will be rewarded awesomely"
Why announce the distribution of warrant to shareholders on a Friday late? This is considered good news. The timing seems odd is all.
"Guys its obvious, if you play calls or puts your mind will be in a blender these coming months but if you've hung in there since the drop from the 60s don't go anywhere, if beyond meat can do 50-170 during covid, Oxy being a 2 for 1 with Anadarko can hit 3 digits by 2022, I'm not going to give you a pumper speech saying next week but I think the faithful deserve some credit on here besides listening to all the paid fake short accounts posting here since the drop from the 20s"
"Alan why are you posting Celine posts, are you also paid to shill oxy stock from your Indian brokers trying to short oxy? It’s time to mute you today!"
If you really want to know where the price of oil is going look at what you can quantify...said this since oil was zeroSaudis now have the business details up because they went public with a small piece...it is easy to see that they earn billions and billions less with oil at 25 then 55 ...they pump about 9 billion barrels so 30 more means 270 billion more in profit...austerity measures there verified that low oil affected their whole economy...the russians are a little better off but there again they need higher oil prices..canada quite obvious they were suffering..south america suffering and the same for Norway...so ALL producers were and are suffering..when every major player is suffering and they all need higher prices??? simple isnt it..if demand is still hit just another tweak of 3-4 million barrels across the 90 million barrels per day that we are at now could move brent to 50-55...at this level everyone is healthy except small producers ..it keeps cap ex in line and everyone can thrive....so think about it not hard to figure where oil is going... do the math yourselves .. 32 billion barrels at year for all producers at 35 or 28 billion at 55 ..not hard to figure out.. 660 hundred billion more in revenue at higher barrel price and lower production ..its a massive difference
"Quiet news that could be something big , Hydrogen from shale oil . Read news from Canada . Carbon capture will allow mass processing of hydrogen from shale oil fields .this is not new but recently they founds a way to do it in a massive way and the carbon capture projects allow them to do it with just about no carbon emission ...oxy is putting in a carbon capture project"
No offense but most people don't care one iota about anyone's general political opinion unless there is a specific reference to the oil sector or OXY.
"I have looked at other oil companies' Q2 results and Oxy had some impressive numbers in terms of its cash flow -- The cash flow was a ""break even"" by significantly reducing the CAPEX as discussed in Oxy's transcript. So many oil companies had huge net cash burn, and with their Q2 result and if it continues as they had in Q2, they are all destined to declare BK. Impairment charges are non-cash and just a paper loss, and all other oil companies had significant write off of their own. All other oil companies added significant debt in their balance sheet of their own. Short should copy and paste their comments to 10000000 oil companies in the yahoo board."
One fellow told me that this will be at 47 in about 3 months but whatever i find & read myself i see the opposite opinions? The reason im asking is because this particular fellow made quite a fortune trading. Otherwise i wouldnt even bother to ask.
This will under perform into the year end...massive tax loss selling
It’s been said that Chevron may just come back in a year and scoop this whole thing up - & sell off enough of OXY to pay for the entire purchase . Not out of the question .Chevron may well WIN when this is all said and done .
"What's So Disappointing....The CNBC Headlines Say...... Market Ends Expecting Deep Production Cuts.....OIL stocks Today have Reacted as if they know that won't be the case.You'd have Thought Oil stocks would have tanked AFTER Bad News, NOT With No News.......I'm NOT Hopeful For Tomorrow......HOPE I'm WRONG......."
Do you guys notice Nicole Alan Mehmet Sakir shortking are all quite today with their shilling of short selling oxy! I wonder who pays them to do this.
OXY wants to stay above 28. That’s good!
Picked up a few shares today feeling good about it.... always could buy more if drops down 5-10% ....  to what’s makes the world go round ️
This might bust right thru 27
Easily 30+ next week with current middle east political instability!!!
"JPMorgan Chase warned in early March that the oil market could be on the cusp of a ""supercycle"" that sends Brent crude skyrocketing as high as $190 a barrel in 2025.Weeks later, the coronavirus pandemic set off an epic collapse in oil prices as demand imploded. And yet the bank is doubling down on its bullish view."
options Friday if not this would have been up to 28
Today we start the journey to $30. FDA to approve vaccine tomorrow. Ton of bullish news for oil. I have a sell order at $35
"(Bloomberg) -- Saudi Arabia said one of the most protected crude facilities in the world came under missile attack on Sunday, in a clear escalation of hostilities that sent oil prices surging.The drone and missile attacks were intercepted and crude production appeared to be unaffected. But the latest in a spate of assaults claimed by Iran-backed Houthi rebels sent oil prices above $70."
"Very simple calculus:If the price of oil approaches $30 the stock price goes to the $30 levelIf oil goes to $90 the stock price approaches $90There is no reason to make it any more complicated o/t making some offsetting adjustments for oil production levels and revised reserve estimates. The Icahn distraction is all about getting Icahn out w/ a profit at the expense of the other holders. He is a master of what used to be called ""greenmail"". As for Vicki she went all in on sustained higher oil prices. She made her bet, and now we have to make ours."
MY friend who is a sales trader in a broker in London told me that Occidental Stock brokers have hired indian call center trolls to post manipulation and good news about Occidental oil. Why would stock brokers hire internet authors to deceive you and convince you to buy Occidental Oil? would they sell it if it was cheap?
so whos selling now?
Cases up in Asia translates into lower oil prices. Odds are that will resolve fairly quickly and then what happens to oil prices!
Holding up well . Most oil stocks still have not swung around to the reality of the higher prices after the trade deal but it is coming .
"It seems like oil keeping steady above 40 is a plus. Another upgrade today - Goldman Sachs Lifts Occidental Petroleum's Price Target to $17.50 From $17, Maintains Neutral Rating"
I would say the lack of insider holdings in this company speaks volumes. If this is such a good deal should insiders notbe jumping into the stock at these prices? It is much lower than when they made that crazy bid. They said it was a great deal.I do not see their money talking.
Wait a minute. Hold my beer! I have an idea. Let's borrow money up to our gills from Warren Buffett at 10% and outbid this behemoth Chevron (CVX) for Anadarko Petro (APC) and I'll go down in history as the smartest person on earth. Never mind the shareholders because we'll borrow enough money to put down enough cash so we can avoid a shareholder bid. I'm not worried about them because they don't matter. Yeah that's what we'll do.
4-15. Why is the OXY pattern of prices drops defying logic?
"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/eia-reports-second-straight-weekly-decline-in-us-crude-supplies-2020-05-20?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooSupply is going down and with all of the well shut ins if the demand comes back quicker than expected and wells opens slowly, or are lost and can't be reopened, crude will easily rise over $60 before the end of the year and possibly over $100 according to a lot of analyst."
What's a good entry point? $83
BANKRUPT OCCIDENTAL IS GOING DOWN SLOWLY SLOWLY NEXT WEEK WILL BE DEFINITELY BELOW 20 US DOLLARS. THE CRASH IS SPEEDING UP WITHOUT ANNOYING OCCIDENTAL STOCK HOLDERS
"This is most definitely the ugly redheaded stepchild of all stocks. Made tons swinging it during Covid, but definitely regretting getting in it again. It sure does love this $25 number. I'm not that technical like some of y'all, but this one to me just makes no sense at all. It hates the bad news, and doesn't care about the good news."
Saudis cutting another million barrels per day starting February. This is huge for oil. WTI heading to $60. Remember when Saudis energy minister warned speculators. Saudis determined to bring oil to $65 by summer. And they will. This is huge for OXY
"Crude - $43.10 Brent - $46.06I do not mean for this to be political, but as an observation it would appear now more than ever, the right is going to simply ignore COVID and go about with their lives, while the left is still insistent on the seriousness nature of the virus. Within the coming weeks we are going to see the fruits of these decisions. Either another massive spike in deaths, not cases, is going to occur and set us back or this may very well be the end of the hysteria and time for life to return with an acceptance of COVID is a virus no different than others. I read the CDC's now released data showing that only 6% of all the reported COVID deaths in America were solely the cause of the virus. Again not giving a political take nor do I need one in return. I offer this observation as a way of saying, if life is returning to normal, we may be a very short time from sector rebound. Supply keeps dropping, this may be the beginning of demand increasing."
"If you’re still betting against oil companies with WTI steady in the $40ish range, you’re on the wrong side."
Look at a five year chart for oil or even longer you can see that oil comfort zone is about 55-65 and companies have thrived there....so even at 55 using oxy numbers ..new cash flow breakeven 38 leaves almost 4 billion in free cash flow and new lowered production levels
"thank you for those shares at 13.30 this morning, num num num."
OXY Upgraded to Buy from Hold at Societe Generale.Target $35
"Just heard Shell's CEO onCNBC and I did not know most of APC properties in the Permian is a JV with Shell . Not sure how that will effect OXY plans for those properties. Might see which is a better play if the properties are that good . Asked why Shell did not bid on APC he said they had already made their play for BG , would not say if OXY overpaid for APC . They are making plans for 60 dollar oil but said it would bounce around."
China buys more oil from U.S. China is buying 14 million barrels of oil from the U.S. next month to comply with the Phase 1 trade deal signed earlier this year. Those volumes are set to be double the amount purchased in August.
***** NYMEX crude heading for $64/bbl today !!Oil patch is warming up....... refineries better start crackin' that crude and producing lots more gasoline..... we're going to need it*****deepsub
"My expectation is that on Monday, the cash from operation will be mild, but the reduction in CAPEX and some cash from asset sales will bring overall good cash on hand position, surprising the market. The impairment charges will be the primary factor determining whether it will beat the estimate or not -- this should be excluded in the analysis. However, OXY may follow the same approach as RDS did, which is to maximize the impairment charges to get tax refunds to enhance the cash position. Impairment charges are non-cash expenditures anyway so this should be excluded in the analysis. Plus, everyone expects the report to be ""bad"". So, it is better to recognize a monstrous impairment charges, and later recover the EPS expectation when assets are being sold once oil price improves significantly with huge gains. It is possible that the earnings could erase the several weeks' down performance. Fingers crossed."
Oxy going up +6% today or more!!!!
"Bought 200 shares when it was at $16 like 10 months ago. Trusted myself when it dropped to $9 and bought 800 more. Let's keep going, and hopefully fix that dividend."
"I’m getting fully vaccinated in 10 days and with that, I’ll probably only support businesses where masks are optional. I’m beyond ready for COVID to end."
WTI $66.40 and oil stocks selling off!!
"A lot to like here. way undervalued, tax loss selling over, Ichan selling over, Buffet long here, oil soaring, huge safe dividend, insiders buying....buy all you can afford!"

Now we are cooking with gas!!!
"OXY will see minimum ~$3B of additional revenue, based on OXY estimate of $215M per $1 increase in WTI! Most of it is going into FCF!Q2'20 Average WTI $43.6, Q1'21 average WTI $59."
"The value of stock is driven by the psychology of people. After the news it was logical to expect this drop. We must not despair, we have in favor the continuous rise in the price of oil that will put things in their place."
Told you to hold. Wait until the end of the month or two. My prediction is 25% gain for stock 37.5% gain for warrant
"Inflation worries stinging major oil. On average major oil companies down 3 to 8% over the last 5 trading sessions with Oxy leading the pack at 8+% My Oxy stop loss kicked in at 29 and change. To preserve profits over this great 4+ month run with oil I have constantly maintained and updated all stop losses at a 5% with all my major oil stocks and pipeline companies. Only 4 have kick in PSX,HES,MRO and OXY over the last 2 weeks. Patiently waiting to jump back in Oxy. This stock what many have called a bankrupt company has made me a hell of a lot of profit with much more to make. This market hiccup will pass, Oxy and major oil will continue their rise. Worked in the refining business for 40 years and through boom to bust oil has never stopped making me a ton of green. Just my 2 cents. G.L. All"
"Lol inflation concerns, oil goes up with inflation concerns.....greedy fatcats."
"On real life, with real money involved, $APA is +60% YTD, $OXY is +80% YTD and $PBR is -30% YTD ... Bolsonaro totally ruined the oil momentum to all shareholders, a lot of them saying here it will fly, only to take them back to where it all started and recover their losses. Be smart, there is no shame in SELLING when a Populist interfere with a company management and then wait for the dust to settle and jump back in looking for a profit.My friend @NIKO didn’t understand that. He said he lives rent free in my mind. I don’t live rent free.... I have a rent to pay, and I pay that rent with his money "
"Wish OXY would jump like CPE (+6% ) or SM (+14%) , it would sure help my pro folio . Some oils are acting crazy , others up 2-3% , must be some short covering in them."
"Shell retiry here, dumped my RD stock when Shell screwed our dividend over and took a risk with OXY when all thought they were going under. What a fantastic move. Also did the same with GE, Ford, and Hess. Bargain basement prices. Bet the farm on them. They loaded the wagon and all smiles. Today alone could pay cash for a F-250."
"Oxy in talks for a 3 billion sale.Occidental talks to Mubadala over sale of $3 billion UAE gas stakeOccidental Petroleum is in talks to sell a $3 billion stake in a gas field to Abu Dhabi-owned Mubadala Development Co., Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported, without saying where it got the information.The companies are discussing the sale of as much as 30% of the $10 billion Shah natural gas project in the United Arab Emirates, the newsletter reported.Two officials at Mubadala’s media department didn’t immediately respond to voice messages seeking comment. Melissa Schoeb, a spokeswoman for Occidental, declined to comment when contacted by e-mail.Oxy, as the US oil producer is known, is working with state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. to develop the Shah field, with production to begin at the end of the year.The UAE is tapping the reserve of sour gas, fuel with a high content of deadly sulfur dioxide, to meet domestic demand for the hydrocarbon used to run power plants and feed chemical facilities.Oxy, based in Houston, is trying to sell some Middle East assets individually after failing earlier this year to cut 40% of its operations in the region, people familiar with the situation said last month.A transaction on the Shah project could be completed by the end of this year, with Oxy retaining part of its 40% stake and continuing to operate the field, PIW reported. Adnoc would retain its 60% holding in the project in a deal that would mark Mubadala’s first domestic investment in oil or gas production, PIW said.Oxy is also seeking to sell part of its stake in Dolphin Energy, a venture that operates a pipeline transporting gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman, PIW said. Mubadala owns 51% of the Dolphin gas pipeline project, with Total and Oxy each holding 24.5%.The US company may also reduce its stake in an Omani oilfield project, PIW said."

"let's see......XOM beats and is in the red, and OXY with a weaker balance sheet and yet to report is in the green. I give up!"
US should approve vaccine by Friday. Steve M offered $916 billion in stimulus package. And a $600 stimulus check. I like that. Huge for the economy. Let's hope both houses pass the stimulus before they leave for the holidays December 18th. Fingers crossed
Headlines today that tech and other bloated sectors could sell off for a couple of months or longer pes expanded 50% over the past year ....so once again fund managers dont like sitting on cash ...many oil stocks are still down 50% and oil is at highs....
"If oil price averages $60 for most of the year, and market still underprices OXY, they can simply announce a stock buyback program in the name of increasing stock holder value. This is how they can achieve costless buyback program. Reserve about $1B for repurchase program, which they don't have to use right away. Mere announcement will scare the shorts away to some extent. Even if they have to use significant portion of $1B to actually repurchase stock, stock price can go well over $40 within a year. If that happens, there will be significant amount of warrant exercise, which will result in cash flow, potentially over $2B (when fully exercised), to more than make up for the repurchase program. When cashflow is strong ( we will know by middle of Q3-2021), there are multiple options to force stock price increase even if open market doesn't price is correctly."
"They can earn 2 billion with the hedge by the end of the year at these levels .. every dollar increase will mean about 450-500 million per year in additional profit , dwelling on the past gets you no where . Next year break even appears to move to about 36-38 depending on cap ex so 45 wti should bring several billion in profit , all oil moved off highs at the end of the day ... %wise the potential is still enormous ..was great at 9... tech stocks are so bloated that % gains are much tougher 50% here is about 22 for Apple it has to move 220 Amazon 1500:Tesla 700 etc etc how likely is that"
Bottom fisher galore. Wished I had more capital
"gulf oil stocks plunge today ,, massive selling .. this means iran can target arab oil companies. i guess this is great news for oxy since its oil production is in the usa, it will benefit alot from this situation. do you agree ??"
"Okay, I know the popular line is oil is dead...but is it really realistic to say a product with 95 million barrels per day in global demand (and quickly rising back to 100 mm BPD) is dead?Secondly, the oil companies have developed a huge business and engineering infrastructure that will help them in the transition to green energy over the couple of decades.The investment thesis is as follows:Intro- Oil production is lower than global demand as evidenced by the lower trend of US & Chinese oil stocks. Going forward oil supply will be constrained by government policies to encourage investment in green energy, however, due to global reliance on fossil fuels, oil demand is not projected to fall until 2055 - it will continue to grow at around 2% per year.

"CEO is responsible for the financial performance of OXY. Given the ER and latest statements today, OXY definitely needs a superior CEO. It’s just business, nothing personal."
The inherent strength of the recovery of OXY from lows shows that bottom is set for OXY. Congrats to all longs.
"Such is life :). At the time I bought OXY, TSLA was around $200 and I was thinking of buying it. But TSLA was running out of cash and didn't make a profit. OXY was making a profit, paying good dividends and had Buffet's backing. So I followed Buffet. Now TSLA is 5 times of what I was looking at, growing and making a profit. Whereas OXY is less than half of what I paid, losing money everyday and its dividend is completely cut...and giving me a lot of pain :)"
Any ideas on what we can expect on the upcoming earnings call (May 6th)?
"Goldman raised its Brent crude forecast to US$75 for Q2-2021, and to US$80 for Q3-2021.https://www.arabnews.com/node/1820276/business-economy"
"Now is the time for CVX to bid for OXY, they paid one price and get two companies and they offer the same as they offer APC."
NOG beat earnings and declared a $.03 dividend. It would be nice if OXY had some positive news like that.
"It would appear fear of bankruptcy is subsiding, emissions and clean energy has people intrigued, and the company has bought itself some neutral sentiment. Looks like they're being granted a wait and see approach as the pandemic slows and the world transitions to recovery."
The price per barrel is steadily climbing. This should bring back confidence in oil companies.
The reason oil just dumped is because Colonial pipeline just reported some disruptions in service.

"OPEC cuts were offset by oil production from Iran, Iraq, Venezuela. We are basically waiting for Covid to abate and company fundamentals when reporting in May."
Oxy is decoupled with oil price. Like i mentioned few weeks ago oil price is one of the most important factor when it comes to stock price but it is not determining/deciding factor. There is currently so much uncertainty. The oil demand has to come back to 100mbpd before we can see 35 to 40 range oxy stock. Which I am confident will come back once pandemic is placed under control... I am only looking at oil price to ensure that oxy will have good earning. I dont look at it now expecting it to lift oxy stock. I look covid cases to see oxy will lift up in neat term.
First quarter free cash flow of $1.6 billion
OXY will definitely touch $30 after earnings. It should be a very volatile day on Tuesday. It will dance around 30 (plus or minus 2) for the rest of the week after the earnings.
I am completely disgusted with this stock!!! That conference call was horrible!
"What do we do guys? I think Icahn has been dumping and it has been affecting the other stocks in the sector too. Do we hold? Are we going to be flat or down for 6 months? I can handle that, but I’d like to see $40+ within 1 year. Is that possible?"

GS changes target prices within 7 days when crude prices are intact...RIGHT AFTER the 20 billion dollar margin call incident yesterday ....didnt they say about 3 weeks ago that oil was shorted more than any other industry and that most had to cover by about NOW and couldnt that mean massive margin calls could be possible
"Looks like Option Games are why the oil companies are all down today, every oil major is down which is a good thing as it means nothing special happening with OXY"

"I am watching this stock but I have to say that the CEO and BOD were not very smart in buying Anardarko. Is there any economist or finacial advisor on the board? How could they bought Anardarko with so much uncertainties out there, slow down demand, world wide ecomonies seems to head into a recession. They bought Anardarko for 57 billion including assuming debts????? What the heck were they thinking buying a shale company that was losing money???? It sure showed a major company like Chevron can see into the future and not a much smaller company like OXY. After the earning reports, if the earning is bad, shareholders should get them out."

I guess UBS loaded up with OXY yesterday after they issued a sell. I wouldn't trust these guys are far as I could see them. I NEVER pay attention to these so called upgrades/downgrades. Lot's of manipulation in the market. At least they shook out the weak hands.

Blame me for starting a position in OXY yesterday. This is about par for the course when I buy a stock.No worries I will be buying more as we go down short term. This is a good 6 month hold. .

"In a world of low to negative interest rates, we pay Buffett 8%. That is just plain bad optics. Really bad, and why would the bod permit this, since this deal had to be approved by them."
the other shale companies are up 6 percent and only fell 8 percent. oxy had fallen 12 percent! are we catching up or no
"I put my money where my mouth is, added 1/3 to my position this morning. As long as the oil market fundamentals look good, I will continue to add."
Oil at 62 usd....oxy cash flow should be very good in 1 st quarter and in 2021.Ridicolous valuation....minimum 50 usd...
Now...we having more new buyers...and importantly less sellers...on very low volumes!!
Oxy is a long term play. It will not go bankrupt because oil is going to take off now until at least two years. You could see a good leg off by end of summer. Don’t be fixated on the daily swing of the stock unless it’s out of the ordinary.
"Welcome to March, month of the Oil Bulls"
I'm thinking if oil is around 50 bucks a barrel WTI this should be around 40 someone's opinion
as promised I doubled by position by 50000 shares
Carl Icahn's latest 13F Highlights from 2020 Q2 filing as compared to Q1 2020.....Maintained positions in: OXY 88.63 M shares
2 weeks to Earnings!
"Money is certainly coming out of tech stocks, but they are not rolling into travel, oil, etc just yet. I am guessing it will be a slow process of roll over into travel (hotel, cruise) and oil in coming months with vaccines making their way through population around the world. We are witnessing the first phase of rollover. Next phases into oil will be a long and slow process, but direction is confirmed."
Company Last 6 MonthsXOM +67.1%CVX +41.9%COP +53.7%OXY +146.4%SLB +78.1%RIG +298.7%VLO +77.5%MPC +83.4%
Lowering the dividend from $3.16 to $.04 per annum will save approximately $5.7B in Free Cash Flow over the next 24 months. That is enough to retire half the 2021/2022 debt. As crude gets back to $55 plus they should find a buyer for Algeria and Ghana or some other asset. That should pretty well take care of all the 2021/2022.
Occ is now all about capturing CO2 for stock market...and that is very very good for stock price
Who will buy this when tech stocks are rallying ? I would say we are lucky to see 24+ today. Will see how long it lasts.
Oil over $62.20 brl
"Article has been shared, but I reviewed it and looked at some numbers and overall trajectory. The numbers the author uses is based on $40 oil for the next 11 years. At $50 WTI, add another $4 Billion in FCF per year. Obviously, each $1 is $400 million in fcf per year. What are the odds that oil averages over $50 over the next 11 years? Ill take $55-$60.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4373642-occidental-petroleums-mostly-solved-debt-problem"
Here is what I am hoping for..they announce the mineral rights sale and another asset..possibly 3-5 billion in total before earnings..moves things into the low 20s..have you looked at what wallstreet expects a massive loss which they should beat..the key is their guidance for the next quarter..if oil holds or improves they will project higher than the street by a noticeable amount
"The key to the near term price movement of OXY stock is what is Carl Icahn doing and going to do? I agree with Trader Jeff that ""Shares (OXY) appear to be under extremely persistent and heavy accumulation."" Not only should Icahn be buying OXY, but Buffett should also be buying!"
and here we Go GREEN!!! YES
@Steve Thanks for suggesting this...https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Heres-How-Oil-Could-Skyrocket-By-138.html
Jeffries last June upgraded OXY with a price target in the $90's......
Read article from january 22 of this year..IRAN BOOST PRODUCTION TO PRE SANCTION LEVELS...they basically state that iranian oil is already in the market at high levels
"The more they talk, the stock is not responding good at all !!!! XLE , XOP improving in price! Other oil stocks going up with WTI improving in price $65.37 a barrel."
"Everyone excited above OXYs carbon capture but nobody can tell me how much they make to capture carbon? It’s not profitable at all folks and it’s just a gimmick, OXY needs to focus on drilling and not giving a damn lol"
Look at the chart .... the potential is a tripled without any problems. Oxy is high profitable with these oil prices and its hedge. Wow.......I see 30 USD maybe within some days. It is the most undervalued stock in oil sector.
Need GREEn in here.
"Hi guys, I am convinced, that this is the game of big Hedgefonds to get oxy shares as cheap as possible. The valuation is one of the biggest bargains at WALLSTREET. Oxy is the best performing shale oil producer among all. Also in the current environment oxy can generate 7 Billion free Cashflow through its operations and additional a huge amount of absolut 8 billion usd of asset sale would be done. Africa assets are very attractive for chines petrocompanies, because they are already engaged in Africa. Oxy is 60 usd company in normal environment, hence I am buying. I trust buffet and Icahn and the big WALLSTREET Adresse, they only want to shake out smaller investors."
Looks like WB used part of his first quarterly dividend to buy 7.5 million shares all of which were bought at prices well above today’s close .
"I have short position in OXY stock and I hold OXY Put Options. My reasoning is simple. Heavy Debt burden, fundamental shifts in Oil Business, Dividend decrease, Bad Management, Extremely bad stock performance. The Share Price always plunges after OXY price increases fast. My position is currently 10,000 OXY stock short. I dont think OXY share price can move above 25 USD. We are aware of soft cap at 21.5 USD and 25.5 USD."
Chapter 11 or Chapter $30?
Heading to $40
"There is a short sited and ill informed, IMO, opinion by most analysts about WB's intentions when it comes to selling his dividend each quarter. Its my POV that WB already has exposure to OXY and wants his dividend in cash and not shares. With an inflated payment through shares and Not cash by OXY, it only makes sense that WB would take advantage of the exchange and build cash. My reasoning is that WB knows that OXY is under pressure. Why buy shares now when you C19 hasn't run its course and thereby OXY has no certainty. Keep the cash. Build the cash. If you want to own OXY, there is plenty of opportunity to buy at a discount. Besides, WB is already exposed to OXY with an 8% dividend. Thats rich enough. Best to diversify in other oil companies as well. And he has. In conclusion, WB selling his dividend shares means nothing of his outlook for OXY. Just my $.02."
I just upgraded OXY ...BUY it ....Price Target $56.28 in 1 year....
"The Fed/Treasury is going to keep saying the same type of thing for some time. They can't afford to raise; and, certainly not significantly. Printing and low rates are the only bed they can find. That's why Marxist Yellen is out pushing for globalist support on high corporate tax rates. (Global taxes and war are probably the only answers left...and due to the nature of politicians, I'd bet on war in the long-term)."

Devon was down 4 % today and it beat on the top and bottom and raised guidance. I hope this an over reaction and bought around 25 % more
"This is very frustrating, market making new highs for the past 3 weeks and this stock ending each week lower and lower for the last three weeks. Frustrating, discouraging, disappointing, etc."

"New jobless claims down to 498000, lowest since March 2020. Can't hold this down forever, summer season and everything reopening. Once india gets it under control oil sector should go up. Only worry is that the wonderful management team at OXY doesn't lay a turd on monday with earnings."
LNG ABOVE 52 WEEKS HIGH
Need to sell some assets now and stop playing games
Good to see Carl gone....
"Who owns Oxy? - Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. The company's largest shareholder is Dodge & Cox, with ownership of 13%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 10% and 7.7%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.A closer look at ownership figures suggests that the top 15 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority."
had oxy at 14.2 and sold at 23.5 and entered again at 17.95. Gaps must be filled. 20.75 and 15.55. Expecting big volatility next week. Either way is good when u have 50:50 stock and cash
"There are a lot of babies and sussies in this forum, back in March oxy hit 8.8 before skyrocketing to 22. Hold ur nerves with the bankruptcy and stop crying."
"4 times cash flow {8 billion} dividend yield at 9.5% plus, stock dropped 30% in 7 trading days on panic selling completely unrelated to their operations. What a gift."
First week of Jan 2020 WTI traded at same range 60-63 and Oxy traded at 42-45.
"Could someone who has experience in this world of warrants help me understand the current situation.I have 800 shares of OXY so I received 100 warrants. In my account, under my stocks section Im showing a number instead of a ticker symbol, which im assuming is like a placeholder for the warrants. When i click on it it shows oxy warrants. But the valuation of the 100 warrants is currently astronomically high, something like $14400 which is like $144 a warrant. Is that a normal valuation??? Or is that just a glitch as it settles? I cant imagine a $22 warrant being being valued to the tune of $144 a share. Am I just being ignorant and am missing something or is the variable of time, t, really that big of a factor for warrants?"
Hey Guys..your opinion for tomorrow ?
The Sauds to cut oil shipments yo US to reduce supply glut. Shouldnpush over $45 and give oxy the $55 hedge price soon. Bloomberg.
HOUSE OF CARDS.all indicators and declining oil market make this very unstable
another one to watch is Earthstone Energy/este. Run by Frank Lodzinski who builds up an energy play and then sells them off at much higher prices...came in at a bad time but has the company humming now and it looks ready to take back its growth as energy prices have advanced. Under the radar for sure but will be found. Boolean I am long a big basket of energy including Oxy/xom/cvx/slb/cop on and on.
Holding for $35 in two months.
That minor sell off did help to increase volume by 1 million shares though
With oil up over 5% this should run up a lot more???
One green day and lose it all the next day!!!!!
Coming up to test the .50 level...
***** the one month chart makes me queasy….............. the five-day chart makes me want to blow chunks. This is WHY U need a cast iron stomach to hold this stock over. time*****deepsub
OXY raises bid again. Now $59b in cash. Selling APC assets to Total for $8.8b. Futures down 400 points. Oil down 2 percent. OXY shareholders do NOT get a vote.
Hold this through the weekend and be happy with a pop to 27 and up
I think oil is now reopening trade. Wait. I really dont think earnings even matter after how shell and bp dropped after their amazing earnings. If the economy reopens and we get 100mpd demand we will get back our 30's and 40's. Meanwhile with fcf oxy will improve its balance sheet.
"As I said last week when it was 28.45, I told that it will go up, and it was up to 31.86 and I sold it. Now it dropped again, I bought 1000 shares again. It will be up since airline is increasing, spring is coming with high demand of gas, and virus is gone soon. It will hit at least $30.5 this week again as long as the oil price increases no matter Icar or Buffet got out of their positions."
"Everyone has a right to bash VH or hope that she can make the merger a winning play . No one will know for sure if be a great deal or not for at least a few years . But if you think it will and the dividend stay close to where it is now and you buy stock with the dividend you can do ok . I am under water in my stocks but think it will pay me in the long run , stock does not eat much and I have no loss until I sell . Everyone has the choice to keep the stock , sell the stock or buy more of it and the winners will be shown in the future . I know some people that have worked and are working for OXY now , they are not real happy now but they are also looking at the future ( they have $70+ stock price). They know when you buy a stock it is a gamble no matter what stock it is and we have no control over what happens to it . But there is no need for name calling if you are long or short the stock"
big shortage in pool chlorine supplies.... which oxy produces
"Im going to just smoke 5k and rip calls before the bell, I think im going to see a beat even with the freeze earlier this year."
I’m just here everyday to watch W have a meltdown. W says if I whine about Oxy 24/7 willIt make the stock go up? No. So quit complaining and understand stocks do behave rational. If you cannot take the loss you do not need to be in the market.
Buffet has 10 BILLION IN NOTES WITH OXY...he should have held his stock from dividends and his airline stocks ...however 10 billion is a large number in in one company...its one of those days the DAYTRADERS think that selective headline posting will move a 25 billion dollar stock when institutions own the biggest part of the float ....
Cold blast Texas. Halted oil production. WTI already over $60
Wonder what Icahn is thinking now?

"You understand now, yeah?"
We are seeing some uncoupling of oil price per barrel and all energy stocks. Markets still seem cautious with Covid BS. Anyone else have an educated guess?

"With all the negative around the stock I am thinking high 30s before the end of the year unless they cut the dividend or OPEC makes a big change ( for SA's IPO ,either cut to raise oil or open valve to gain market share to raise profit ). Long term 2-4 years it could be back in the 60s with debt reduction , cost saving and if Permian production is what they think . But for now more downside( oil price, merger costs, property sales ) than upside pressure. Next couple of quarters will be the test for profit and dividend . Long in the 50s will look at more if it breaks 40."

Anyone else do a call on this?

I got OXY dividends by shares and today it indicated $7.00/share?? I am not sure I understand.
Good news Buffet taking stock instead of bonds. Bondholders should be happy with that!
Great opportunity to buy more. Great dividend.
Market should stabilize soon
I can tell you as I live in Germany. Nobody cares right now. Traffic is up. Everyone is booking holidays for travel either air or driving. I tried to rent a car this weekend but could not because of the German holiday Monday. Finally restaurants are opening to include the brau haus. Even here people are sick of staying home….to include me. Just for what it’s worth.
Now heading to $25. We will see it by the end of this month. Cheers long friends!!!
The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a draw in crude oil inventories of 3.5 million barrels. The analysts were expecting a build of 1.34M barrels. https://ca.investing.com/economic-calendar/api-weekly-crude-stock-656Should take the position back to 25+ tomorrow.
OXY longs have to appreciate the perfect set of circumstances today. Rotation to Energy from Tech; a rising Market; Low Inventory and a resulting spike in Oil to $66 plus and Natural Gas close to $3. How long will the momentum players keep it rolling and when will it stop. All that is needed now is a higher than expected earning report next week and do I hear a $35 stock price.
I wonder if any warrants have been converted? If so that is cash in OXY’s pocket. Yes a bit dilutive to the commons but if it’s used to pay down debt then it’s all good.
This stock has made me $$$$. Love It!
its the uncertainty about the iran deal. next week will be show and tell. either way we're here for the long haul
"I cannot think of the fundamental reason for OXY to continue to drop. Debt is under control for the time being, oil prices are rising, vaccine is coming soon, stimulus is likely coming, and yet the stock keeps crumbling.Why?"
"considering the huge volume taking place, it's a sign of huge upside"
What a disaster for a good company like OXY. It took several decades to build it and now it is destroyed by a reckless CEO. Her ego let her get the deal at all cost. Savings of employees has been burnt in half and for sure there will be layoffs. Investors and shareholders are suffering as well. I think she should apologize to everyone and submit her resignation.
oxy carbon capture boom about to lead the industry.
"Why is $MRO back to pre-pandemic prices, but $OXY is not?"

"Ok you market markets done taking your 19 cents for millions ? the earnings are good top and bottom, go abuse roblox."
"OXY will do very well oil up in the mid $65's area when you add in their Brent sales... This should be back to a high $55+ by next dividend payment, if not $60's."
"The 4th quarter will be the first that the two companies are together as one and with all the changes in employees and possible new people being uncharge of some of the accounting , the change of reporting date does not really look like a big deal . They will take a little extra time to make sure everything is correct . And probably a different ways of accounting certain items for each company that have to be combined now."

Question for the 3 OXY longs here that can read a balance sheet. Exactly how much debt does this pig currently have? Do they still owe more than they are worth.
hundred of billions pouring out of stay at home and tech....lets see where it goes
Only Oxy down? All other oil stocks are green or almost green.
***** Breaking News------OXY issued a PR about an hour ago offering to buy back in cash certain senior notes for the total of about 1.5 billion dollars....... just says they paid Uncle Buffy his last dividends in cash...... this action is also a sign of strength in the company and a further reduction in debt.......... Miss Vicki and crew just keeps chipping away at that debt...... next we'll hear of some other asset sale in the near future most likely.*****deepsub
I will actually be pleased if the $24 and change support holds...
Why is this DUMPING??? Down the most in the sector by far!!!!!!!!!!!
"I immediately wondered: Why is Buffett — the so-called Oracle of Omaha, a billionaire investor famous for his foresight — betting nearly $10 billion on natural gas at a time when leaders in California and other states are talking about phasing out the planet-warming fossil fuel? Where does Buffett see long-term value for gas in a climate-constrained world?Moment this crisis is over First need for the world is Energy -Fuel or Crude and Warren Buffett didn’t do much to explain his thinking in a news release, saying the company is “proud to be adding such a great portfolio of natural gas assets to our already strong energy business.” Berkshire’s energy chief, Bill Fehrman, offered only slightly more detail, saying the purchase “expands our company’s footprint in several Eastern and Western states as well as globally.”"
Oil draw next week could be north of 10 million barrels easy....thousands of stations are totally our of gas on the east coast..the pipeline is flowing and demand for the biggest travel weekend combined with showering stimulus money combined with un masking..combined with millions of people going back to work should create the beginning of massive demand....yes expand opec to talk about a slow increase in production....A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THEY WERE INTERVIEWING A SENIOR IRAQI OIL EXEC AND HE STATED THEY HE EXPECTED OIL TO STAY IN THE 60S FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR....keeping in mind that the Saudis need about 57 to pay their dividend to the country 60s seems reasonable
"12 million shares traded above the average volume, while most other oil stocks have been trading around average or below. That to me, shows some serious dumping by Icahn. They should be done soon, if not already. Hold on through May and we’ll be just fine."
@mary
"oil analyst was on saying expect oil to be up by end of day 2:30 pm, very over sold rating."
Does anyone here know how to read a balance sheet? What's OXY's equity compared to its market cap?
***** nobody even mentions the latest inventory report from EIA...... they had estimated around a million barrels of build.... but they reported over 21 million barrels of a building inventory...... the largest in history of the United States... and yet..... price of oil keeps climbing along with oil stocks...... this is either The perfect Storm or the twilight zone......*****deepsub
Reposting an observation I made on Feb 15 when OXY was trading at $25.39: There is little argument that the stock markets have many things in common with gambling and casinos. I admit that I am a gambler myself and I like to give good odds to the opposite side of my bets. That is what makes gambling exhilarating. My throw of the dice says OXY price will hit $30 before trading at $23.
Goldman Sachs expects a 3million barrel per day deficit by 4th quarter and has oil at $49
If the billionaires want it at $50... it's going to $50!
Nothing would be funnier than Chevron buying OXY here and getting Anadarko for half of what they were offering just 9 months ago.
CNBC just mentioned that money is flowing back into energy
the only concern is if Warren is doing the deal you know he is getting the better of it....so for that it leaves me a little unsettled. Boolean
The closer to May we get the higher Oxy and oil will go. We are on the precipitous of an economy that is begging to be unleashed. L
Egypt & Russia are now welcoming international flights if you missed the news!EU did so 2 weeks ago and the number of air travelers has been increasing steadily every week since we reopened business. The oil demand is rising...

"Options Fridays at its finest between 27.5 and 27, yawn see yall in mid April back to ATH"
Hope to see oxy closing above $22 today (pending vaccination approval in USA yet)
How sustainable is it for the countries that depend on oil for their economy to keep the price of the barrel at $20? This will recover and everyone who has purchased at the lows will reap the rewards I am in for an average of 11.95 and will hold for the foreseeable future. Looking to buy more if it continues to dip tomorrow.
"I love all the negativity, proof positive!!!!"
"Seeking Alpha Article- OXY is on track to generate ~$6-8 bn in OCF for 2021, if you take a one-year run rate from Q-4. As prices are well above the $50 threshold the company has identified to drive 5% production growth, total OCF could hit $10-11 bn in 2021. OXY is trading at a capitalization of ~$25 bn currently. If they were to hit anywhere near the cash flow I'm projecting the cash flow yield will be prodigious, 30-40%. This is my thesis for the stock rallying as the year advances.Cash flow of this caliber will enable them to continue paying down debt over the next couple of years. I would expect to see debt levels drop from ~$35 bn ex-Warren's $10 bn, to around $20-25 bn when asset sales are factored in. Along with this will come simultaneous reductions in the annual interest expense of ~$1.5 bn."
Buffet still got 100B cash on side line can buy all the shares for $10B
Money Velocity is as low as 1960. Inflation is temporary due to covid. Personal savings is high. Eventually and unwinding of funds when all clear hits with covid.
52 high was $47.58 so this little jump is nothing near to where it was. Let’s hope the demand of gas increases over the upcoming months.

why are they wasting money by paying a quarterly penny for a div.? pay off that debt!
We need a positive catalyst to get oil back on an upward trend. Anyone see that in the near future?

"I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade but as long as Nat gas is under 2 and crude is under 50, this thing is very overpriced. The size of the dividend is meaningless if they have to borrow from equity to pay it. Seems nat gas finds a bottom 3 months after crashing, looking at late April, early May for energy stock plays."
this stumble is setting up for a scramble tomorrow. 5-8 percent day
A bargain.....a 55 usd value stock at this level.
Stock was in the 60s when oil was in the mid fifties....after the battle over the purchase started the prices dropped for no reason other than that..yes they took on debt but they also gained tons of oil and gas rich land and about 666 million barrels per day of production.so with oil about 10-12$ per barrel higher than expected could allow the anadarko side to produce 3.-4.5 billion of profit...and then the cost savings form operating in the same region ..they are easily serving the debt and making a billion or two....should be back in the 60s and then higher ..soon
"lets see now....how many days before OXY is trading in the 30's.......of course, vicki and company must know something the shareholders don't. !!! what vicki didn't know was how the world economy was reacting to trump as openers......she went ahead with our money to buy a company which had its own surprises waiting.......anyone here feels Icahn is wrong ??? s......."

"02/08/2021, 21:48 pm. So, the evening session of West Texas Intermediate oil futures trading is under way and it is trading at $58.43 up +$0.46. Am I the only one that thinks that this thing is heading to $60 per barrel before taking a breather?"
Oxy’s production and oil price trends look like 2017
Guys look at other oil stocks relax....there is a world outside this stock....relax
Recently bough OXY put options. I am in Profits. Sold my oxy shares. I have been holding them for the past three years. My cost was 52 USD sold it for 16 USD. If I wait it wont recover and there are many naive investors. SEC shoud look at this stock!!!!
Don’t fall for the head fake here. Market makers here selling to bring it down. DO NOT FALL FOR IT
This is a company we should all be in...12 cost per barrel. Im in on the dip today with 20k shares. Load uphttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/talos-energy-inc-nyse-talo-140043052.html
"Why I think oil will be $75-$80 by summer.When it comes to storage, We have been floating in the 400's for some time now. But, overall storage has been dropping. The pandemic is at its worst just this past month. Deaths and infections. This has caused the world govts. to revisit their safety protocols and tighten back up. Only now have the numbers shown substantial positive moves with infection and death rates. . Little Frac'ers have been going BK in droves. This has gotten the ire of the banks. Many an article has been written on the Banks unwillingness to loan in this industry any longer. This illicited a response from the Feds. Only this last week did a Fed judge step in and say the banks can lend or not to any industry they want. To be sure, Banks never said they would absolutely not loan. They just outlined stringent requirements that few could meet. Er go, lil' Frac'ers. . We have entered prespring and the economy is showing signs of opening up. Cruise Ships and the like. And with Summer travel being the heavy consumer it is every year, there is a pent up demand coming over the market. The tide has shifted. The Market is what moves futures and SP. Both have been on a tear. . Right now, production is basically in lock step with consumption. There is a glaring problem though. Consumption Can be turned on like a spigot, or better put, a drain. The hose filling the pool can be turned up but you have to travel 5 miles to turn it on. (2 months from SA to get a tanker). Domestic production has been substantially weekend by 20%+. Now let's reason on this for a sec. Is the U.S. The only country with a production problem? Uh, No. Many countries don't even produce oil. What happens when the World opens up but production has been destroyed? The bottle neck thats coming due to emerging countries desperately needing oil is going to create an extremely volatile market in the coming months IMO. This is why the pundits are projecting $80 oil by eoy and potentially $100 oil next year. For perspective, these same pundits back in May, were projecting $60 oil by summer 2021. I believe they were trying to be conservative and not put out the worst case scenario. $60 is here and its the first week of Feb. Just....think about that for a minute. If we are at $60, why is the market supporting this pricing? Imo, its simple. Its all about production/consumption ratio. The market sees a constricting bottle neck. So do I.Oil $75/$80 this summer. The real pain will be next year when Cruises and Airplanes will have gone back to a relative normal and all these Oil majors lack of Capex will come back to haunt the consumer. $100+ by 2022 summer. Yeah, I think I'm being conservative.Oil at $65 OXY at $28-$30Oil at $80 Oxy North of $45.Oxy divest noncore assets by eoy, fcf and return to a dividend and the SP will be north of $60 headed to $80. Its all about positive trajectory. $80 by eoy 2022. And a real path to $100+ if/when oil hits a sustained $100. That should put Warrants at $90-$100. The story will be too compelling Not to have this kind of run up. Remember as well, that OXY will Never be debt free. They just find their number and issue dividends off that balance sheet."
I can not find anywhere that Warren Buffet has sold any shares so my buy price is here I’m in 
Next stop is 25 then 30
Oil patch stocks sagging today despite higher oil projections. Inventory numbers may be poor and those w/ that knowledge may be selling. But when the smoke clears out these stocks will rebound like a coiled spring. Does anyone have a better explanation on a day the market is marginally positive and all oil stocks are down?
Please a round of applause to longs that did not sell when Cramer was sying OXY was on the verge of going BK
We may end in green today
"OXY is out of gas, compared to other oil stocks. looks like it's on a downward path."

However, it would help all oil companies in the future. It is impossible for each individual company in one industry to stand against state governments should they decide to make the attack."

"Just out ----U.S. Oil Stockpiles, ProductionThe Energy Information Administration reported U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 2.1 million barrels vs. the prior week.

Last week saw a surprise crude stockpile increase, while the prior two weeks saw unexpected declines.Late Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute recorded a 483,000-barrel drop in crude stockpiles and a 1.7 million barrel increase in domestic gasoline supplies.Gasoline and oil prices are expected to rise in the coming weeks as coronavirus related restrictions are eased."

"I have finished my value analysis on OXY; main takeaway are 2B FCF starting from this year which will grow to 4B at 2023 (with WTI & Gas stable at 40 & 2 for 2 years and then growing t0 45 & 2.5), and dividends starting again from 2023 even though half of what they were. There is still a risk of bankrupcy if oil decreases again, but it depends on how OXY will be able to sell its assets.Target price of $25-$26, but remember the probability of bankrupcy.If interested on the model used, please contact me."

oxy at 60-70 $. before end 2021
Forgot to log in and there are a hundred bs posts...every minute every move....bunch of beginner traders clogging the boards...buy one option and then post 100 times....yes tech and stay at home and home service and alternative energy and all companies that have gone through the roof with no financial reason could get decimated ...many oil stocks are still far undervalued based on crude...like I posted months ago you knew that the new administrations would make a deal with Iran and if didnt know..iran is part of opec and their big boy friends will make them play nice ...they did not spend 16 months monitoring the oil market to have it disrupted by one player ...the saudis appear to need just under 57$ per barrel to pay their dividend to their economy yes on big down days oil will still be hit in a small way due to panic selling across the board....but soon funds actually already will reposition money into the only sector left that can garner 30-50% returns
When oil and gas draw is reported. Watch oil shoot to 70 and OXY to 28/29
"Looks like the large players are dumping shares, entire sector is green!!!!!! Someone is looking for a horrible earnings report????? What gives?????"
We’re about to witness something we have not seen in 100 years!!! A booming economy running on all cylinders and it will require the help of the energy sector no matter how negative the sentiment is. OXY will be in the $40-$60 range by the end of the year.
New lows every day?$!#$%$
they couldnt stop the crude pride recovery so they play dirty tricks
"Might be difficult for OXY to remain at these prices through the end of the year. Just read a story about ""tax loss"" selling might drag OXY down further. Might not rebound until new year in January (if at all). Really need to hear some good news."
"The 20dma is sitting at $27.11. It has broken trend through that floor twice recently. The good news, is that she roars back to set new highs. We have the $28 handle I was talking about. But, the weakness looks powerful at this point. We just might get the low $27's before this is done. What a beautiful entry that would be. The Warrants would/should overshoot and set up for an incredible entry as well."
HELLO VICKI --- have you seen your stock lately???? Remember us lowly shareholders out here who need some answers like /1/ IS THE DIVIDEND SAFE. /2/ Show us the pathway you have figured out that makes this deal a HUGE WIN for investors. Boolean
I exited yesterday fearing OPEC meeting outcome but quickly entered again today after OPEC news. My 90% portfolio consists of oil stocks and I will not look elsewhere now
“Carl Icahn to Cut Occidental Stake While Staying on Its Board”He probably wants to shed some warrants. He mopped them up last year like they were going out of fashion. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carl-icahn-cut-occidental-stake-222901355.html
"Our time will come, silver is a example it was in consolidation for years until the recent breakout. Oil will follow suit, its a matter of time..."
"The American Petroleum Institute reported late Tuesday that U.S. crude supplies fell by 7.7 million barrels for the week ended April 30, according to sources. The data also reportedly showed gasoline stockpiles down by 5.3 million barrels, while distillate inventories declined by nearly 3.5 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub, meanwhile, edged up by 548,000 barrels for the week, sources said. Inventory data from the Energy Information Administration will be released Wednesday. On average, the EIA is expected to show crude inventories down by 3.9 million barrels, according to a survey of analysts conducted by S&P Global Platts. It also forecast supply declines of 500,000 barrels for gasoline and 1.6 million barrels for distillates. June West Texas Intermediate crude CLM21, 0.85% was at $66.14 barrel in electronic trading, compared with Tuesday’s settlement at $65.69 on the New York Mercantile Exchange"
"12/16/20 @ 11.44 pm WTI trading at $48.27 per barrel. You can't have the price of oil rising and the price of OXY shares and other oil stocks going down indefinitely. At some point this divergence has to revert back into balance. My bet is that oil will stabilize in the $47 to $50 per barrel area for the next several months and the price of oil stocks, including OXY, will soar before year end."
"Notice how all the BS PUMPERS disappear!!!!! You know the ones, OXY $29.00 after earnings!! OXY $ 30.00 after the conference call!!! PUMPER BS!!!"
"Many are commenting and must not have listened to the call. There’s a lot of debt being removed from the books in Q2, some of which is rollover from transactions in Q1. Their primary goal is to get the debt down to achieve investor grade status. This opens the doors to more funds that need that requirement. Just like how some need a div so they keep it at .01. When that does happen expect a pop. If 30+% in three months doesn’t work well for you then… don’t know what to tell you."
Vanguard Institutional and Mutual OXY holdings at over 14%. Dodge and Blackrock in big too. That is strong company.
"Hey $TSLA $XOM $CVX $XLE $OXY & $GME investors. Think about this when you’re buying your stocks....Let’s get something straight, a virus has not re-engineered the entire energy base of the world. It just hasn’t. To say otherwise is unfactual.Oil and gas are entering a new secular bull market...maybe their final one due to the green revolution, but it will be at least 10-15 years of very high priced oil and gas before the decline begins. You can expect $75-$150 oil from 2023-2035 due to regulators pushing oil out of the economy. “Old school” dinosaurs like XOM and CVX will reap huge benefits in positive cash flow and will transition to green to lead the market. They have the engineering expertise and the capital to make it happen.It’s insane to think that oil and gas are dead. They are not dead yet. It’s a business cycle. It happens."
oxy got downgraded 2 days ago now today oxy got upgraded so what the world are we living in?
"Oh, and it’s May 21 and Oxsee is currently at $25.40. There, now I’ve stuck my head in the noose, but since I’m really good at this I have no fear."
"Ready for 80 a barrel crude!Crude prices have risen this year on a global recovery driven by China and the U.S., with positive signs also emerging from parts of Europe. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting an unprecedented jump in demand over the next six months as vaccination rates rise, with benchmark Brent crude seen reaching $80 in the third quarter. But virus flare-ups in some regions and prospects for higher supply from OPEC+, including potentially Iran, are tempering optimism."
"OXY has tried about everything it can in the last weeks to get the stock to move up and nothing has worked yet ( none of the offerings were real positive ) . I look at their Form424B2 on Charles S. it was not real positive , basically saying OXY is not out of the woods yet. Stating that there is still a lot that can go wrong even with the new loans ( look it up and read parts of it ). How new loans will put stress on cash flow due to higher interest rates ( start paying interest next year on these loans twice a year ).OXY will have to show positive earning , that some are saying won't happen until 2022 . But no one know for sure oil could go up to 100 or back down below 10.00 ( no one can guess oil price next week let alone a year from now ). People did not see 100.00 oil a few years ago or negative oil prices just a few months ago .If OXY can show a good profit and get CAPX back up ( don't care about the dividend yet ) it can move up . Asset sales would help but with OXY extending the bidding time on the Montana sell ( has 13 bids right now ) says the bids are not the greatest . We just need some positive news coming out !"
OXY is outpacing the gains today by the other members of the oil sector at more than 2 times and more in most comparisons. With a 14% spike in the stock price how much is on fundamentals and how much is related to a short squeeze because the options seem to be saying there is a lot more upside yet to be realized.
"Oxy is the Pearl among all stocks, dvn and EOG as well."
"You mean to say, I’m gonna lose money today and pay higher gas prices in the future? Lol, buy and hold guys. Take advantage of these down attacks. Don’t forget the “hold” part. This will turn out positive, but it is not as much as you expect in a day or week. Seeing the small growth is actually a good thing."
"Mehmet Sakir finally came out of his hole today as oxy hits new highs, he should stay low"
22 by friday
You shorts better understand what your seeing because starting next week this is rocketing to 30 look at these blocks on a day like this.
THERE ARE 850 ONLINE STOCK BROKER EMPLOYEES MANIPULATING STOCK BROKER PRICE CAPPED STOCKS. MOST OF THEM ALSO POST ON YAHOO OCCIDENTAL OIL WEB PAGE

Over $20 tomorrow.
"Sir Carl Ichan is just rebalancing his portfolio. Nothing much to worry about, and he will make over $1 billion just from warrants. He was a savior for me when he backed up the warrant price at around $3. I bought lots of warrants at $2.6-$3 and worried if it could fall under $2.... He well deserve selling some shares for profits and use the fund for other opportunities. Thank you, Carl Ichan~"

"Besides oil price being low, what fundamentals are wrong with Oxy? Anyone can share?"
By the way don’t forget lower dollar. Good for oil
"Here's what Vickie will say. Due to the unprecedented effects of CV-19 and the drop in oil prices, we had to reevaluate our situation and we have decided to eliminate the dividend to help preserve cash and pay down the debt. Plus the added cash payout to Warren has left us little choice.I hate to cut this meeting short but I have some job interviews lined up. Everyone have a good day and thanks for coming.Well guys, let's see how close I am in the next month or two. Remember my post."

Add in the orchestrated computer glitches that reverse thousands of voters selections.... and she then owns the election.... and we get stuck with sleepy Joe and camel-Toe...... and the whole country will suffer for the next four years..... unless some justice can be brought to the USA in our hour of need !!!*****deepsub"
please hold this 24-ish floor! For the next 2 weeks.... it's a tall order
Strong Buy! They are saying current oil prices will make them generate lots of cash so paying Warren Buffet Cash dividend! Short Squeeze possible like last week!
Good luck everyone! I had to sell my stocks lost $17k but I need the money. Hope this pays off for the that can hang strong 
What small cap oil stocks still have room to run this year? I am looking @ $LPI and $HLX.
"When we the Energy industry is down, the world economy decline and suffers . Energy industry and world economy are directly interlinked, there is no growth without the energy industry. They reckon that the energy sector would contribute to a roughly 1500 usd income per household. It’s oil & gas boom time I feel we are close to the boom cycle start. Fingers crossed"
It would seem that the Analyst Community is finally waking up to the realization that the enormous debt load will be difficult to manage - and that together with the large preferred stock payout will suck out much if not all of the FCF going forward . Selling assets into a recession or into declining oil prices won’t be very lucrative either .Everything needed to go right for this to work out - it’s not often in life to see everything go right . This was an enormous bet on future oil prices and the economy financed with a large amount of debt .
Best guess for tomorrow ER$3.75B - $4.1B Revenue1350-1410 MBOE/D-$1.19 to -$1.42 EPS
so for all you naysayers... if Ichan is buying up shares... what is he paying for them????/ obviously he is also in this for the money just like buffet and the rest of us who are buying at these levels.... I said it before and will say it again... I sleep VERY well knowing I own here at these levels.... but.. to each their own.. (i sure wouldn't want to be short this one)
"Next week 28, thumb up if u agree"
"This summer will be “back to normal” travel season for US. Oil consumption will increase as Europe and rest of the world recover. Oil should stay around 50 to 70/bbl and OXY should be able to deliver $4b to $6b FCF. Based on that logic, share price should recover back to $40s or higher while OXY.WS should double in a year."
nat gas prices are over a 100 in some areas ...I thought it was a misprint
I see this as a major opportunity Occidental has taken on more debt but they also bought a profitable company so what is the big deal a lot of people slinging negative comments is all I see no facts with cost saving initiatives they should be able to start paying off the debt from the purchase of Anadarko instead of one Revenue stream they now have two I think what are this stock is now there is tremendous upside it may take months to get there but you can collect dividends on your way if you're a day trader stay away
"""Crude oil prices continued to climb today after the Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 800,000 barrels for the week to November 20.A day earlier, the American Petroleum Institute reported an inventory build of 3.8 million barrels for the period.

Oil making new HOD $63.54 brl
Would be nice to not run out of steam like days past and finish strong...
Jim Cramer just mentioned Occidental petroleum will be strong all 2021 !!! LETS GOOOOOOO!!! This is a 50$ company let’s not forget
"Before Corona, Oxy was 3~40$.. The end of fossil energy And The beginning of the electric car.. In this eraThe right price 20~30"
They didn't cut special interest buffet's dividend.
"I'll repeat my post from yesterday. An analyst on CNBC said yesterday that BEFORE the Anadarko purchase, Anadarko was worth $33 billion. NOW, the combined companies are worth $33 billion. YOU'RE Getting OXY FOR FREE!"
How does Buffet's massive investment in TEVA make the cheerleaders feel... he obviously makes some massive mistakes...That's why he insured this one... with the 8% preferred
"May be I’m fictionalizing thing a bit but I get the feeling WB want to support, mentor and finance OXY all the way to a huge success. Of course, he doesn’t do it just for the fun of it. As you recall a lots of posts saying so bluntly that a woman has no place at the helm of a major oil company. I think WB wants to prove otherwise. He wants Vicki to be very successful as an oil boss. Of course, he doesn’t do it if VH is not the right leader who’s possessed all the skills, experience to lead. Deep down WB wants to leave a memorable legacy not only as a rich man, charitable man but also a man who promotes thē equality of genders/sexes in work places."
"Too much unknown for me. SP hit the low $28's and I thought there was a strong chance it dipped into the low $27's. It didn't. Whether it does or not, I'm back in with a 10% discount as of this morning. Still going to be a monster in 6 months."
At current levels the overall market is pricing in a strong rebound in the second half of 20. Hopefully management is busy buying back their long dated debt at 50-60 cents on the dollar.
I am betting that Iranian deal will not be reached before the fall. Likely will be reached after the presidential election in Iran coming up in few months.
US OIL USAGE during normal times is about 20 million barrels per day and we... the US.. had gotten up to about 14 mbd..without fracking the US is back to about 7 and subject to whims of the major players . After 911 everybody obssessed to achieve energy independence....and we are almost there. Progressively companies like plug power( 21 years old) and bloom energy will grow over time..however any abrupt change will set the wheels in motion for oil to go through the roof for opec and leave the US totally vulnerable to 100$ plus barrel prices and or no supply ....gas would be 5$ per gallon like europe and we would have to accept it ...coal is far far dirtier than natural gas or oil so that would not be an option when going green ..if anything they should work on the 40% of america still operating coal plants for ELECTRIC FOR TESLAS TO BE CHARGED..NAT GAS IS A BETTER ALTERNATIVE FOR THOSE PLANTS
Cost will come down from debt reduction as well as enhanced oil recovery using CO2. And also to create higher revenue from premium oil that is CO2 offset
"Hope employees are putting out resumes. Next big news will be 25% or more head count cuts. Don't need double accounting staffs, geology staffs, field staffs, ect. with all the capex cuts. Easy cost savings for OXY."
"Risk/Assurance in investing OXY. Assurance: one of the four lowest cost producers, leader in carbon capture technology (which will important to meet the ""staying green"" goal), the pandemic has accelerated their cost cutting plan and the majority of that will become permanent, great connection with the bankers (chavez - a former banker, icahn, and buffet), a wide range of portfolio of assets, 400 mil shares are approved, dividend is (almost) completely cut.Risk: bankruptcy if there's another oil war. That risk is minimal now given the fact that both the Saudi and Russian were suffered greatly during the last oil war (you never know). Saudi's and Russia's economy is suffering greatly now because of a combination of both low oil revenue due to low price and covid-19. Given the fact that all countries had experienced with covid-19, they will be more prepared if the 2nd wave reappears. So overall, we have more assurances but we have one minimal risk (given the fact that the Saudi and Russian already experienced the oil war and didn't like it). I think our sliding scale is tilted towards the safety side. OXY may be a primed candidate for a takeover especially in this low interest rate environment. During the past week, we saw that OXY tripled its volume at a higher price, and the sell-off only had slightly above average daily volume. Most importantly, whenever OXY hit $21, there was strong biddings at that level attempting to keep it at $21 (same behavior when it hit $9 at the peak of the pandemic). To me, this shows Oxy is having strong institutional support."
What are the predictions; what will happen to the stock price after the vote on Friday on Buffet’s dividends?
"A clear sign of panic selling or even panic buying is huge volume, which makes the move in either direction on solid footing. Last few days, volume has dried up significantly, both on long and short side. It appears that neither side is budging from their core positions. Due to low volume, it may only take few more buyer to push stock price significantly."
Small caps getting dumped hard!!!! Money is moving from small caps to large caps. OXY is ok and will weather the storm. The OXY needle will not move much unless the market thinks the dividend or buybacks will return. Those are probably the only catalysts that can overcome the dumping manipulation.
"The dividend is not safe especially with the stock approaching the high 30's......the company will justify reducing the nearly 8% dividend to simply make it seem financially responsible to its shareholders....ironic, the shareholders vicki threw to the wind......no company can lay out over 90% of its free money especially one with the huge debt incurred by vicki hollub…...Carl icahn was very much on the mark appearing on CNBC......ITS ALL IRONIC BECAUSE VICKI SWORE SHE COULD REDUCE BY 3 BILLION DOLLARS THE ANNUAL COSTS OF RUNNING TWO SEPARATE ENTITIES.....OF COURSE, SHE RUINED 80 BILLION OF SHARE VALUE TO GET TO THE TINY 3 BILLION....HOW MANY 401 AND 403 PLANS WILL BE IN DEBT TO VICKI FOR HELPING THEM OUT SO MUCH...……...TOO BAD VICKI ISN'T BROUGHT UP ON FINANCIAL CHARGES FOR GOING AROUND HER SHAREHOLDERS...….I WISH SOMEONE WOULD LOOK INTO ALL HER OFFSHORE ACCOUNTS AND HOW MUCH MONEY HAS GONE INTO THEM RECENTLY...….THE TRUE RICH PAY ALMOST NO TAXES SIMPLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE WRITEOFFS THEY ARE ALLOWED.....ITS THE POOR SHAREHOLDERS WHO PAY THE BULK OF THE OPERATIONS NEEDED TO MAINAIN THIS COUNTRY...….Vicki hollub did this to herself and whatever happens now is totally the fault of VICKI......As for her so called buddy, warren B, he is also in shock to his shareholders over his debacle with kraft Heinz......Fortunately for him, vicki has saved his reputation......"
"I have a question for all the people saying OXY will be 50 by the end of the year . OXY has 900 million shares outstanding now but want to issue 400 million NEW share ( vote on May 29 ) to help pay Buffett's dividend and some employee's pay , what happen when the total share outstanding jump by almost one half the numbers of the shares outstanding now ? 900 million shares now and 1300 million shares after May 29th ."
"I see lots of people thinking they recognize at pattern, I.e. OXY not holding a gain. Trust me, every time you recognize a pattern, that pattern will no longer repeat. This should be the last time that OXY is a swing trading candidate and will instead start trending. Expect a rally that takes us up to 36-38. Still severely underpriced but the street won’t pay what she’s worth due to the negative hype on fossil fuel energy plays."
"Boy it’s amazing how the negative Nancies all go silent, when the stock rises 2days in a row. All of that doom and gloom only here when it has a red day, because the first rule of short selling is to short the first red day and then bash the stock. I Told ya people this would go up. All of the fear monger inn psycho babble is a designed tactic to steal your money and your positions."
Voting OXY shareholders are not HAPPY
"$TSLA has had a historic run. Congrats! According to Goldman Sachs, the same run is poised to take place in oil. As governments restrict drilling due to environmental concerns, demand is rising. Oil will be $100-$150 per barrel by 2023 and will remain there for 12-15 years.The oil majors will use the cash to buy out green energy companies. Now is the time to buy $XLE $OXY $ET & $GEL"
Wow lol they really do manipulate the life out of this sector on the daily
To address the iran situation...more than likely they want to be in the good graces of opec...any oil dumping just lowers crude prices for everyone and the iranians cant live on 40$ oil either....SO ONCE AGAIN HEADLINE BS ..GREAT FOR DAYTRADERS
smart money will come in soon to take advantage of the bullish CC coming....you must look outward not short sighted here...this is on sale. Boolean
Gasoline in San Francisco is approaching $4.00 a gallon....How much did the Saudi's pay Hunter to get his dad to shut down drilling in America ?
oxy is doing very well in managing well costs and opex. 35 percent cheaper in Permian and 27 percent cheaper in DJ
"Let the analysts position their funds and their biggest clients ""quietly"" and then they will have more to say 2 major upgrades actually the merril upgrade is almost 75%....crude prices should steer you ..not noise...just like the entire past year ...what guided people through was watching the vaccination numbers...here it is crude prices ...they are a machine that drills and sells crude...simple premise..."
I’m in for the win!
"It is possible that the dividend will be increased once oil prices recover (of course not until then), but I think we will see share price rise FIRST, before any dividend talk....."
Will be trading 38-45 very soon. Covid is near over in the US.
"An OPEC+ technical committee was said to raise its global oil demand growth forecast for 2021 to 6 million barrels a day, according to delegates. Earlier, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said that the group sees “positive signals” in the global economy, but that there are factors in the oil market that require ongoing vigilance."

"Occidental Petroleum, feel the power."
Buy any and all dips! Onward march to $46 mid term.
"There are probably tons of people shorting OXY and all these auto sell program kicking in, which may force OXY to drop to or below its previous LOW of 37.60. It would be almost time to add more as its next ex-div date of 12/9/19 approaches, I simply could not see OXY dropping too LOW with its accidental kept rising, now at 8.38% (price of 37.72), to sell at this price is almost insane. If for any strange reasons it would drop to 35.11, its yield would become a crazy 9%, IMHO, I would mortgage the house, the cars and go ALL IN."
"9 million volume. Remember yesterday, it was 30 million, the run is just an hour in"
The Buffet terms are a major rip off... no need for OXY to pay 8% plus warrants...OXY has just $10 B in debt... and $9 B in EBITDA... thats debt leverage of 1.1XsThey should easily be able to raise $10 B for 6.5%... and their leverage would still be just 2.2Xs EBITDA...Weakness is as much Buffet as it is a fear of overpaying 1.5% on $10 B is a massive $150 million a year
"The question is simple: does Vicki know something about how much oil is in the Permian (which experts agree they don't really know) and does OXY have the technology to cost effectively produce below the cost of $40 per bbl. She seems like she does.Then consider the synergies of location for export and the feedstock for their petrochemical operation. Most think the worse, but what happens to the market cap if she is right?"
But they did some smart financial engineering moved to lower interest costs
Carl has been buying up all the $22 warrants. How many million shares has he bought?

"I thought I'd seen everything in the oil business but now oxy is asking employees to voluntarily resign and submit a proposal on how much severance pay they think they deserve, if the company accepts it then its a deal, if not you probly run the risk of getting laid off with what oxy thinks deems appropriate, the morale that house of cards must be horrendous!! Thanks vicky, you will not be remembered fondly!!"
"CORRECT ME IF IM WRONG, BUFFETT GOT ON OXY BETWEEN 40-45 and ICAN BETWEEN 30-35. Right ? 2 GIANTS LEGENDARY INVESTORS OF ALL GENERATIONS BOUGHT AT MUCH HIGHER PRICE, SO HOW CAN IT BE WRONG TO GET IN AT 11-13 now ???In Buffett and Icahn I Trust."
"I'm holding OXY long, I wish I had some more cash to buy more OXY. The ride down is temporary, the upside is through the roof. The company fundamentals are super strong with the acquisition of the huge Permian basin. Company debt is the only thing holding the share price down, but that should turn around real soon. Five years from now there will be some very wealthy OXY shareholders. Enjoy the ride."

"Here is some reading:The following is a copy of the letter that Occidental delivered to Anadarko’s Board of Directors:Board of DirectorsAnadarko Petroleum Corporationc/o H. Paulett Eberhartand R. A. WalkerMay 5, 2019Dear Members of the Anadarko Board of Directors:We are pleased to submit our revised proposal to acquire Anadarko for $76 per share, comprised of $59 in cash and 0.2934 shares of Occidental common stock per Anadarko share. Our Board of Directors has unanimously approved this proposal and we are enclosing the merger agreement, attaching disclosure schedules of Anadarko and Occidental, which we are prepared to sign, together with a copy of our equity commitment from Berkshire Hathaway and our debt commitment from BofA Merrill Lynch and Citi.Our revised proposal represents a premium of approximately 23.3% to the $61.62 per share value of Chevron’s offer as of Friday’s market close. The significantly increased cash component provides value and closing certainty and the equity component continues to provide your shareholders an opportunity to participate in the value creation of this exciting combination. Our revised proposal does not require an Occidental shareholder vote, which has been repeatedly cited as the explanation for why you previously chose Chevron’s $65 offer over our $76 offer.Anadarko announced on April 29 that the Board of Directors of Anadarko had determined that our April 24 proposal of $76 comprised of $38 in cash and 0.6094 shares of Occidental common stock per Anadarko share, could reasonably be expected to result in a “Superior Proposal” as defined in your agreement with Chevron. We hope that the Board of Directors of Anadarko will promptly declare our revised and significantly enhanced proposal a “Superior Proposal,” so that you can comply with your obligations under your existing merger agreement and expeditiously secure this compelling value for Anadarko shareholders.Our revised proposal and merger agreement represents our comprehensive response to all points that your counsel has raised with ours over the course of the past week. Your counsel communicated to ours on Thursday evening a request for three board seats on the Occidental board. We believe our revised proposal, which is 78% cash, does not support this and therefore we have not included such a provision. The $1 billion breakup fee that resulted from your decision to select a $65 merger rather than the $76 per share we offered three weeks ago, will be borne by Occidental once we acquire Anadarko.Our merger agreement does not contain any financing condition or, as noted above, any Occidental shareholder approval condition, and we do not anticipate any delay to completing the regulatory approval process. We would expect to be in a position to close a transaction in the second half of 2019. As you are aware, our financial advisors are BofA Merrill Lynch and Citi, and our legal advisors are Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, and we and they are available if you have any questions.We remain perplexed at your apparent resistance to obtaining far more value for Anadarko shareholders which has been expressed clearly through our interactions over the last week. As you know from our long-standing interest, we firmly believe that Occidental is uniquely positioned to create significant and sustainable growth and value from Anadarko’s asset portfolio. We hope we can execute this merger agreement without delay and proceed to bringing this exciting combination to fruition.Sincerely,Vicki HollubPresident and Chief Executive OfficerOccidental Petroleum Corporation"
Thing is if you guys don’t sell. They have to buy back at a higher price coz they sold on Friday
"BofA Names Occidental Top Oil Stock Pick, Sees 70% Upside In 2021Mentioned:OXYOccidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) is among the most levered stocks to an oil recovery, according to BofA Securities.The Occidental Analyst: Doug Leggate maintained a Buy rating for Occidental Petroleum, with a price target of $29.The Occidental Thesis: The company's stock came under significant pressure and has 'paid the price' for its capital structure being 'heavily weighted towards debt,' Leggate said in the note.He added, however, that Occidental Petroleum will benefit due to its oil leverage now that there is upside to oil prices.The analyst noted the company had extended its debt maturities through 2023, enabling a transition in its investment case 'from anxiety over its balance sheet to a focus on world class operations with the lowest capital intensity of the US oils and one of the highest free cash margins in the industry.'"

"Ok so Vicki had been working the Anadarko deal for a year, they had already signed a long term commitment at Greenway, why did she feel the need to buy the ConocoPhillips property knowing it would`nt be big enough? Now it`s for sale and Oxy probably won`t get a fraction of the initial cost back.... Good grief...."
"Opec plus will attempt to extend reductions. This will spur on higher prices. 2 vaccines look plausible in next three months returning demand and higher prices. 600 rigs have been shut down and will take months to return to operating capacity leading to higher prices, These are only a few of the macroeconomic conditions that will lead to higher prices and OXY SP of 50 to 60 dollars in next 18 months"
now get this squeezed to 26 so we can all have fun this weekend outdoors
I keep reading posts from folks who apparently are enticed by the nearly 8% yield to potentially jump in . A higher yield is a warning flag not a sure thing payoff . What good is an 8% if you later lose half of it and half of your original investment too ?This is one to watch for sure - but from the sidelines . Vicky H and the BOD fell all over themselves buying a huge package of assets at the PEAK price paying more than was necessary and financing a chunk of it at far higher than market rates to avoid a shareholder vote .Almost everything has to go right here now and that doesn’t seem to be the general direction .
"Since acquiring Anadarko we have not had a year of earnings with positive oil prices under our belt, this year is going to be huge if we can maintain oil over $55"

"As far as I am concerned, the only analyst recommendations that I give any credence to are Strong Buy, Buy, Sell, and Strong Sell. Everything else is just being afraid to take action or trying to not admit their previous recommendation was a bad recommendation. That is just my opinion.

"People's sentiments here are reminding me of ""NIO"" stock when it was at $2 (right now it's > $16). Undoubtedly, OXY is in trouble because of lower oil price and huge debt in the balance sheet. In near future, you may see OXY stock price to single digit too. Hopefully COVID vaccination and people's confidence in travel will be back in 2nd half of 2021. With the travel back on track, Oil demand and price will also be back to $50 at-least.Now the question should be if OXY can survive till 2021 end with lower oil price. As per the latest quarterly result and recent bond offers, OXY has already made sure that it has enough money ($1B cash in hand, $5 loan available, $2-$3 asset sale) to pay down the upcoming debt (around $10B) and CapEx till 2021 end. So there should be on concern on OXY bankruptcy by 2021 end. You can't control stock price as it fluctuate with people's sentiment. Once Oil is back to $50, all oil stocks will be back on track so don't worry about it. Actually take advantage of market and buy it at lower price, if you think Oil prices will be recovered by end of 2021 and OXY won't go bankrupt till then. I'll be happy to know if anyone think differently based on numbers instead of just sharing their imaginary ideas.Note: I'm long on OXY and have bought stocks worth 100K at $20 price."

Oxy trading in its range. This will be an after Easter special.

Nice Rally......Looking Better Than the $43 Handle.....My BP is coming back also....RBS got a big upgrade today......All isn't lost in oil it appears.....
"Q4 2020 wasn't that bad. The oil production was down from Q3 to Q4 / 1269 to 1199 MBOED, but its FCF increased from $569 (Q3) to $753 (Q4). This is achieved while its CAPEX increased by 1.5x. Once the demand is back to normal and the production increased to pre-COVID level while maintaining the current oil price, OXY's FCF per Q will be at $1-3 billion. I am not sure why the production was down (storm?). With the 2019 acquisition, how likely OXY can increase the max production capacity from the acquired assets. This is the key, as the price of the oil and demand will be back sooner or later, but need to ensure if OXY needs to make sure it can keep up its production with the demand. The CEO Vicki needs to address this tomorrow."

WTI about to make a new high of the day!!
I am a small share holder of oxy today I notice on my account of distribution OXYWS can someone explain to me what it is?
Great stock that OXY!!!
I personally think that OXY should start giving 25c per quarter dividend ($1 per year) to attract dividend investors. It will only cost them 930M. They are going to have 8 billions in cash flow this year. So this dividend pay can be easily done.
WTI back to $64.91 GREEN

Vikki speaks on Thursday on CNBC....
all the information is great and all oil has no regulations on holding barrels upon barrels that are purchased at the lowest bottom dollar then re-sale at the highest price and charge you more for that oil that has been sitting in the fuel stations and refineries. and in 3-6 months they are going to hit us all with a plant shutdown to do repairs when this pandemic they could have or choose not to do preventive maintenance. iam all for making money just not on the perpetual backs of us drivers.
always leading the pack
All it takes is few moments to lose all of today’s gains when market opens on Monday. LOL....
I like it. Very much so.
Cloud of uncertainty will persist. Investors need to price in Vicki (and BOD) propensity to dope slap shareholders at will. Only thing to offset this embedded risk is significant improvement in earnings and SP.
This is an epic shake out before oil starts reporting. Don’t panic and hold long.
Overall the CC was positive IMO. Sounds like the worst is over as long as oil stays above $40. LT a good hold at current share price.
Just received my electric bill in Cypress Texas
ok - time to load more??
got in today and will hold long term. just think it is a good buy at this price
$25 soon for OXY short term..
IChan will make an opinion. My opinion is no because OXY not declaring ordinary Div will allow OXY to force Buffet to wait on being paid. Buffets div will accrue to be paid later. Employees and executives do not need to be compensated with stock options while market price of crude is below $50.00 a barrel. should be normal by 2021. So a delay of say 12 months or 800 mill preferred divs. with the premium could easily be paid when oil is at 50.00 a barrel considering Pre Crude oil Price crash oxytocin's could payout divs of 1.1 billion quarterly when ordinary divs were 3.16 a share...The correct OXY management option should be to pay no divs for 12 months but let the divs accrue.....The BOD should sign off on this Plan...Its the only one that truly protects shareholder value...
"My fellow OXYs,1. Should I buy today to get the Dividend?2. Should I wait a few days of the end of year tax selling?3. I was close to buying on Friday, but mu guts told me to not gamble yet?4. Looking at today's price of $37.52, it was a good idea NOT to buy on Friday.5. So, my next move is to wait until Mid-December before I buy? good or bad idea?Peace!"

"Fundamentals remain the same, so stick to your game plan.

Will OXY benefit from it big-time? time will tell.3. $1.3B debt has been reduced and likely further will be reduced next year. 4. They are ready to push-back 2022 debt to further down the line, just like they did for 2021 debt. So, debt is not an issue for 2-3 years, at the very least.5. Their priority is debt reduction with the cash flow, i.e. there will be little dividend for a couple of years6. Cost of production per BOE is only about $6 and other expenses are about $5 BOE. 7. They have improved operational efficiency ($ cost) significant, most likely due to lower cost in this high unemployment environment. 8. Anadarco acreages are quite productive9. They are not much concerned about Biden's fraking policies. My bottom line: They have weathered Covd-19 storm without getting killed, and things are looking up. Stock price is not going to be block-buster anytime soon, but it can be in 2 years if Covid can be controlled, oil prices go up, and all the hard efficiency and cost control lessons learned this year can stick for years to come. Add your take-aways if I missed anything."
UPGRADE EARLIER TODAY TO 58....first of many to come..no brainer oil is up about 10$ above where the company modeled..will mean billions in EXTRA net
You guys are over thinking it. This looks to be a Friday sell-off to me.
what would be funny is if they announce asset sales or m&a after market closed
"What’s so funny is that the volume that sold this down to 25, is half of the volume that brought it up to almost 26"
"The first quarter should show what OXY can or cannot do , have not heard of any write-offs or asset sells this quarter. So with 60 oil we will get an idea of what is ahead for OXY if oil stays where it is predicted. I still think the main problem will be another drop in production this quarter ( if it is a drop in production that would be four quarters in a row if I remember right ). Right now they are averaging a -.30+ for the first quarter profit, lets hope they are wrong. Hopefully an asset sell will come up soon , production will increase and a positive profit will be shown."
18 by summer…..
"Today, I don’t see people who write big stories on why we should not buy OXY...."
OXY only goes up when you have a downgrade. Pray for a downgrade so we can jump higher. I say 2 more downgrades and we hit $30. Do downgrades by Mehmet count????
"WHEN ANY COMPANY GOES ON A BUYING SPREE AND PUTS ITS SHAREHOLDERS AT AN ADDITIONAL 36 BILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN ADDITION TO THE TAKEOVER'S ALREADY 10 BILLION DEBT, THE PEOPLE AT THE TOP SHOULD RESIGN IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE BOTTOM FALLS OUT......DEBT IS WHAT KILLS BIG CORPORATIONS, NOT SHAREHOLDERS......"
"@trader jeff. OXY is set to sell off African assets and one more in USA. Once they do, they will have cash and be more flexible, possibly pay off some loans. There is NO NEED to be concerned about future dividends. While i realize you are short the stock or long the puts, there is no need to be less the candid when posting. You loose credibility."
Occidental management offers share holders guaranteed of 8% meanings if owen 100 shares you have the right to buy 8 shares for 22$ so why should I if I can buy as many shares from the market at 18$. it doesn’t make any sence.
does anyone see all those call option buys? October 18
***** OXY now at $28........... an energy play to overweight.......... will continue to appreciate !! my $30 Target by April fool's day is only 30 days away....... looks like it should be right on schedule.......*****deepsub
Just bought opened first position here. Hope it’s the right decision
"Pretty sure most either like our CEO or you despise her. Her business life would have been so much better NOT to do the deal, but she did. Then she had to get billions set up, get commitments to sell parts of the deal off, hedged oil for 2020 at $55, she even BOUGHT shares with her own money!!I support Vicki!!! go girl......."
"This thing is gonna rocket as soon as one seat is locked up tonight, fund managers are pushing each other to get in now before its going to do a double by year end minimum lol look at these block 2 trades on heavy volume ironically after tax sell off time has ended and it couldn't even go back under 17, lets go"
First quarter was stellar ...Bp just announced that they are hitting their debt reduction targets a year ahead of time
We could see by today’s weakness everyone was fearful. What’s that Buffet axiom? “Buy when others are fearful...”
Final hour should see a huge buying binge...same with XOM and others that are being hit hard for....no reason but the season. Boolean
This might be the first time I’ve seen Oxy move up and get stronger as the trading day went by to the bell.
"What is becoming increasingly unclear is this Administration's foreign policy objectives in the Middle East. Just how much are they willing to bend so as to obtain a nuclear deal with Iran? Are they looking for regime change in Saudi Arabia? How resolute are they in the defense of Israel? These questions and others are being pondered daily in Teheran, Riyadh, Jerusalem, Damascus, Ankara, Bagdad and the other capitals by the power players in that area. Without a clear picture of what US foreign policy is going to be towards the Middle East the probability of further instability in the area and of escalation in the military conflicts increases. Oil prices are likely to reflect this in the near future."
@Vicki Let’s get some asset sale announcement this week!
Saw this yesterday over 26.00+ guess profit taking ?
OXY has no debt due in 2020. I repeat - no debt due in 2020. So anyone posting about bankruptcy is just wrong. That being said - dividend cut is a certainty - or they may suspend the dividend for a few quarters. They’ll suspend their share repurchase program. They’ll close asset sales where they have definitive agreements. Restructure debt maturities due 2022 and later. Maybe even sell of their highly profitable chemicals division. This may result in a temporary $18-20 stock - but NOT bankruptcy.
Rumor says Chesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK) is about to buy OXY in 1-1 share swap.
"If oil stays here, there’s going to be $8 a share free cash flow for 2021???"
"Ben Sharples: Sun, May 16, 2021, 7:02 PMOil Edges Higher as Demand Optimism Offsets Asia Virus Flare-Up(Bloomberg) -- Oil edged higher at the open after a third weekly increase as a demand recovery in key regions raised optimism about rising fuel consumption, despite a Covid-19 flare-up in parts of Asia.Futures in New York climbed toward $66 a barrel after advancing on 2.4% on Friday. The U.S. and China along with parts of Europe are rebounding strongly from the pandemic as a vaccination drive accelerates. The prompt timespread for global benchmark Brent crude has also started widening again in a bullish backwardation structure, signaling a tightening market.Meanwhile, gasoline stations are in the process of returning to normal following the restart of Colonial Pipeline Co. after a cyberattack halted flows, although fuel disruptions may still be seen for weeks in parts of the U.S. East and South.Oil has managed to break out from a tight range near $60 a barrel and resume its upward momentum, but constant reminders that parts of the world remain far from a full recovery from the pandemic continues to dent the outlook. The coronavirus resurgence in India is still crippling industry, while new outbreaks in Singapore and Taiwan show authorities need to remain vigilant.Another wildcard is the prospect of more crude flows from Iran as the nation seeks to revive a nuclear deal and free itself of U.S. sanctions, but talks are ongoing and progress on a solution remains uncertainThe prompt timespread for Brent was 34 cents in backwardation -- where near-dated contracts are more expensive than later-dated ones -- compared with 23 cents a week earlier. It narrowed to 17 cents on Thursday.DIAMOND HANDS!IIII$CDEV $XEC $WES $SM $MTDR $FLNG $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $RIG"

Oxy has $109 billion in assets value.
Just sold 20 contracts for 31 strike expiring tomorrow and got 800$ premium. I will be happy to sell 2k OXY from my 7K if it crosses 31 tomorrow and get back in next week. Congrats everyone.!!!

"Top four picks for the oil major run! OXY, BTE, SU baby!"
Get a free stock when you join webull. I just got a share of tesla for joining. https://act.webull.com/actv2/ubt/9FHjGS7LUqRq/qc1/main/
"Occidental Petroleum (OXY)OXY is my highly speculative high risk high reward play. OXY has gotten crushed. It’s down nearly 70% in just the last month. The stock has fallen along with oil. The problem with oil is twofold with issues on both the supply and demand side.First, the economy basically being shut down from the coronavirus outbreak has caused a major demand shock. Second, the Saudi’s spat with the Russians has caused a major supply glut. On top of all this, OXY was placed in a bad position with a recent buy of Anadarko leaving them burdened with a heavy debt load. Moody’s actually just downgraded their debt.So you must be wondering why in the world I would buy it now when it seems the company is facing the most pessimistic outlook in years and trading at a 17 year low. Well, actually that’s the exact reason why I bought it. It’s a contrarian call.Starting as position at the point of maximum pessimism is one of the hardest things to do. A contrarian believes that certain crowd behavior among investors can lead to exploitable mispricings in stocks. Widespread pessimism about a stock can drive a price so low that it overstates the company's risks, and understates its prospects for returning to profitability. Selling high and buying low is one of the hardest things to do. It is counter intuitive to human nature. This is why most don’t stand a chance of beating the market. You must buy when they cry and sell when they yell as a contrarian investor. Now, you must have a thesis for the stock to recover and courage in your convictions to stay the course. Nonetheless, fortune favors the bold. The following is my bull thesis regarding OXY.First, I believe the Saudis will come to an agreement with Russia sooner rather than later. One little peep of a deal with Russia and I see oil skyrocketing higher. In fact, oil was up substantially as of the time of this writing. The Saudis are famous for walking back their threats. Furthermore, they need $75 barrel to pay for all their social programs. So it may only cost them $10 a barrel, yet they need $75 a barrel to sustain their way of life. So they are really in a worse position than the US shale players. I don’t see this lasting very long.Second, I do not see the current situation with the coronavirus outbreak lasting as long as many are currently predicting. China has gotten it under control in 2 months. I see demand coming back sooner rather than later. Lastly, OXY has cut the dividend and has excellent assets under management. Plus, Warren Buffet and Carl Icahn are large shareholders. They tend to know a good deal when they see it. I feel I am in good company.As I said before, layer into any position in small increments as more volatility lies ahead. I like to say its “time in” the market not “timing” the market that generates profitable investments and creates long-term wealth. My 12 month price target is $22 providing over 100% upside. (See OXY stock analysis on TipRanks)"

There used to be a day - when the market got trounced - OXY would shine like a green emerald . Perhaps those days are returning . If so - d### good 2 see !

"The lack of Deleveraging was the culprit from earnings.Despite a better outlook for chemicals and midstream, shares fell due to ""the slower pace of reduction in the company's net debt position,"" said Peter McNally, analyst with Third Bridge Group, who added, ""The balance sheet has been the critical issue since the acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum in 2019.""Occidental has struggled to pay down debt amassed in the $38 billion deal. It cut debt by about $3 billion last year but in the first quarter reduced net debt by about $279 million, according to regulatory filings."

Ton of rigs shut down. Number of operating oil rigs less than 2015. Most oil companies cut capex by 30%. Oil supply is being contained while oil demand will spike in 2021. Oil is going higher and OXY is a double from here.
"Occidental Oil Bankruptcy will be announced in June 2021. Occidental Oil has 41.5 billion US Dollars debt. It takes 857 years for Occidental to pay its debt. When announced, Occidental shareholders including YOU will have to pay the corporate debt. Buffett and Carl sold all their shares for this reason"
"XOM lost $800 million due to texas freeze, i wonder how big OXY losses will be"

"A big crude buildup and an unexpectedly large draw in gasoline, could mean that they aren't refining gasoline fast enough. Maybe that's why WTI went up on what was supposed to be a bad API report.

"oxy has been hammered but it has been outperforming like oil companies as of late. when we need to worry.is when oxy is down big when XOM, CVX, rdsa, bp etc are up big. this has not happened. this is a big if, but Vicki and the BOD have to product big next year. if they do , this can be the best oil stock in the patch next year.the reason why the stock got hammered is because not many have faith in the execution and Vicki overpaid Buffy, but now oxy has Buffy on its side, which may be worth it - will see"
been investing over 20 yrs. This is the first regret. Thought that 57 would be a safe price. The only way for this to turn around is to fired VH and replace the whole board and pay the fine to back out of the the deal. Brian M from BofA should be also in the law sue from Icahn.
Everything is pointing towards $50-$60 per barrel. China is buying as much as they can at these low prices!! Everyone smile and have a great day tomorrow as we are riding the rocket to $18+
Again -AVOID chasing this falling knife with a rising YIELD - oil falling -OXY is soon going to be in crisis if this continues
Just imagine the sell off size if OXY missed eps and revenue
"I would not get your hopes up for earnings. COVID is still affecting the world. We all need to hold until the world can declare victory on COVID and all restrictions are lifted; worldwide. Then, we all sit back and watch OXY return to profitability. Snoozing until next year."
Just wondering . WHO here among the fanatical longs feels that hiring a debt restructuring firm less than a year after they added $38B to their debt is a positive ?
My bad your house we finish consolidating today we wake up to the stimulus pass bill straight to $23
Oil stocks - in the last several months - have tended to be one hit wonders - they’ll have a really great day once every couple months then languish sidewise ( or in OXYs cash downward ) the balance of time

OCCIDENTAL OIL IS A BROKER PRICE CAPPED OIL STOCK. THAT IS STOCK PRICE HAS A CEILING PRICE LEVEL SET FOR NEXT 3 YEARS AT 31.5 US DOLLARS.

AFTER THAT WITHIN 3 MONTHS COMPANY IS GOING TO ANNOUNCE BANKRUPTCY.
"CHK had negative and tight cash flow even when the oil price was high. They were capitalizing all of their expenditures as asset, boosting their asset value while having enhanced income statements figure to borrow more to sustain its operation and expand their acquisitions. They were using accounting tricks and eventually went BK. If you are comparing CHK to OXY, you are wrong. OXY had one of the best cash flow reports in Q2 among major oil companies. OXY will have much better cash flow in 2021 and appreciated asset value with the expected increased oil price will improve asset to debt ratio or some of the ""non-core assets"" will be sold to manage its debt significantly. I am just speechless this spammers mentioning CHK on OXY, as they are clueless."
"Shorts listened to UBS oil analyst, Jim Cramer and Mehmet. hahahahaha"

"I was surprised OXY went up in during the closing on Friday ( thought there would be a Friday selloff ) . But Forbes has written about OXY in their June/July issue under ""Dukes of Moral Hazard "" where they stated in the oil patch some or even too sick to take advance of the Feds generosity . Where OXY's debt has grown almost 5X since 2016 to around 46 Billion ( oil was hovering around 30 at press time ) and that OXY looks to be heading for restructuring or even BK. I know oil has moved up since this article was written and I think that should help OXY but this was Forbes thinking at that time . OXY also has the ability to issue those 400 million new shares which will give them a little more breathing room. If OXY can move up a little more I will be positive in my shares and will definitely put in some stop loss instructions in to make sure I keep any profit . OXY can easily fall 5.00 as it jumped and if they do issue those share it will ( if they issue them when OXY is over 20 then it should stay over 10.00 a share to help trading rules for some companies ) or if oil production jumps in the US or elsewhere. Make sure you keep some of your profits in OXY and not give it all back , look at selling a percentage and letting the rest run or at least put in some stops at different levels for protection ."

This is Oxy telling the wall street -> You can't stop me now. $36+ by mar end.
Past 5 days OXY is down 10.82% after we had that great earnings report and enlightening conference call!! To the moon with this dog!!! Down more than every stock in the sector. Why because it is such a great company!! Well we are dumping into the close like such a great company that the street just loves because they believe in the wonderful management team that pays themselves and screws the shareholders!!!
oh boys.. I am late for the big rally today?!
"Appreciate your point of view in this important topic.Today OXY shareholders are voting, so a couple of questions:1) Why would shareholders vote in favor of OXY issuing those 500K stocks? https://www.oxy.com/investors/Reports/Documents/2020-Proxy-Statement.pdf2) If they ended up issuing those 500K stocks, wouldn't that dilute the equity and hence make the stock go down significantly?Thanks"

READ the information from OXY in their last report - THE DIVIDEND IS SAFE - there is no plan on cutting but rather...RAISING THE DIVIDEND. This stock is a perfect buy when in the cheap heap. Investors must learn to buy values like these and fight the fear....we will be right...we are right. Average down or buy in is my opinion and I am adding to OXY for 2020 and beyond. Boolean
I feel as if OXY has hit it's bottom for now. Accumulating more at the 25.30 level. We will be going up from here.
Putting vaccine rollout in perspective....France 65 million UK 67 million italy 60 million spain 46 million poland 39 million greece 10 miilion...Russia China and India have their own supply..as you can see by the small populations when a company like JJ speaks of 1 billion doses by June in addition to all of the other vaccines blanket coverage should start to happen very soon. Russian and China are cranking vaccines and some mediterranean countries are starting to to move around... I think at Novavax mentioned that their contract manu in India can do a billion doses quickly..8 Billion people in the world a now there is Sputnik Chinas vaccine JJ ..who have also Merck doing it for them ..pFizer who has sinofi also doing it for them and astra zeneca ...and soon novavax...lets crush this thing
Buy here before oil hits $80 mark by the July 4th weekend. You'll be glad you did.
so lets say I have 20 option contracts for Jan 2022 and I don't technically own the stock. How does that factor in? the breakdown I was given this morning was:1. 100 common shares per contract2. 12 warrants 3. cash in lieu of .5 fractional warrantsso would that mean I have a contract on the warrants (240 warrants) as well as the common stock regardless of the strike price?

BDI is soaring up. This means that the real economy has entered a definite recovery phase. OXY TO $70
"The Q4 EC s/b very revealing and so far all indications are it w/b very positive. Oil at $60, asset sales progressing, production rising and consolidating operations going as planned are all elements that will dictate upward stock price movement."
Just imagine oil at 70+ This stock will be at pre pandemic levels pretty soon.

"Q1 average oil is around $58 barrel. OXY is in the $20+ barrel profit range. At 1.1 mb for ~90 days it’s a $2 Billion profit quarter. Add a little here, subtract a little there and it basically comes down to where did OXY put their money. Hopefully a massive debt pay down."
A good place to start the discussion is the one who helped finance the Anadarko boondoggle with those sweet heart preferred shares; all dividends should be on the table for examination.

"Well, heckuva couple weeks for OXY and the markets. Seven months on it sure looks like Vicki was hell bent to join the ranks of OIL Majors, and APC was OXY's ticket to joining ""the BIG OIL Show."" May still work out, and count myself fortunate to still be buying more and joining up with that outcome. Leadership needs to turn a stiff upper lip, wring out what ""operational synergies"" are available to lower operating expenses, refinance upcoming borrowings - at substantially lower rates than before the FED's recent 50 Bps rate reduction, and line up sales of those ""excess assets"" to OXY's ""way ahead"" planning - as COVID-19 blows over, and OIL recovers to $50+/bbl, which it will, as summer approaches. Am Long OXY, and still buying - like yesterday, below BV. Swallow hard, and pull the trigger. It is still morning in America, by God. L'audace, l'audace, tojours l'audace."
"New poster and unfortunately new bagholder it seems. In laymans terms can someone confirm the following as I see it:By acquiring APC and paying dearly for it, the end result is OXY basically has the ""Boardwalk"" and Park Place"" of the Permian Basin is that right?If oil spikes due to Middle East skirmishes I assume that will ease the pain a bit?If Vicki steps down or is whacked, that could be a positive?As an investor in XOM and CVX I'm in it for the income but also am well aware oil can shoot up like a rocket given the right circumstances. If China gets a trade deal and their economy starts booming again that could impact oil prices, etc. Just wondering. Thanks."
people out there paying more for cars and homes... .LOL... 8% nothing for big capital loan. this is cheap money. if this was the 80's...they would have to be paying him 20%.... its a great time to borrow...and if they cut their cost per barrel of oil coming out of the ground just by $4.... its all taken care of... not to mention you are putting his name behind it... warren doesn't buy only a good dividend... but when he thinks a company is undervalued... that way if one doesn't work.. he has the other... not to mention.. who do you think owns most of the railroads that carries oil when the pipelines can't handle all the production... ? this is a no brainer... its not death.... its an EFFING GIFT to any longs

the only winner here is Warren Buffett. I'm thinking his name was used as bait all along.
This one is a good long term gamble in my opinion. Picked up 500 @ $11.90 to hold for a long time. I will buy 500 more if it dips below $10.50

"The Whole Management should keep their pay cut instead of restoring it. they should fix all issues list below before getting a raise1. Slow debt reduction2. Federal drill permit3. Low production4. Vickiwhen oxy acquired anadarko 2 years ago, they assumed WTI would stay above $50, the deal was so worth balabala. Now we are at $60+, where are we now? production dropped from 15 mboed to 11 mboed, leasing operation expense jumped from 6.05 to 7.2, DD&A jumped from 17.41 to 22.77, where is the synergy?Now oxy has idle wells to use, what about future? how much capex are we expecting next year?EOG accumulated tons of permits last year, Oxy didn't?"
21 million now. 1 million shares in the past 30 mins
I LOVE INTERNET ONLINE EMPLOYEES OF BROKERAGES. MARKET MARKET BANKRUPT OCCIDENTAL SHARES.

Dec 30 numbers now in. Look like Carl sold another 3.8 mil shares. All the major funds made only mild increases or decreases except Macquarie fund added added another 4 mil from 15 to 19.
Analysts expects oil barrel price to go to $100 in coming months. This stock is gonna surge
"the trend is your friend, its obvious that oxy bought ana for such a huge premium to protect their jobs"
This sure does look rough. Almost sickening.https://www.oxy.com/investors/PublishingImages/BOD_238x167_hollub.jpg
Occidental’s $55bn Anadarko deal turns into a nightmare
If you don’t sell they can’t bring the price down
"CVX's smart move is to take $1billion break-up fee, then buy the parts of APC that OXY doesn't want, like Mozambique gas project and offshore drilling in Gulf of Mexico."
Well on a positive note Icahn boosted his stakes in OXY last week he added 11 Million shares :-) https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/carl-icahn-boosts-stakes-xerox-194814545.html
Side note. I put like $100 in MDMP. ITS UP 700% today. Any thoughts on this? Permian drilling company.
"I am not alone in my story. The bag holders over $50.. officially today, I am up after continuously doubling down! I wish everybody good luck and holidays."
The Energy Information Administration reported Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell by 10.6 million barrels for the week ended July 24.
Guess which oil stock has the strongest relative strength now?
Crude 46+ 20 +soon
Fed minutes should calm the flock. Everyone’s so panicky about inflation when it’s normal coming out from a pandemic
"OXY is down with Icahn & Buffett's news, what happens when Icahn starts his actual dumping????"
I found out why oxy is selling off. short interest was at 3214585 yesterday. I told you guys the market makers are manipulating this
22 is a real possibility today.
look at that oil bounce baby!!! There was so much gasoline used nationwide in the last 4 days...!!!!
"I remember a time .... when on a good day , OXY would move up $2 to $3 . Back when the dividend was substantial and it was secure , when OXY was considered an income stock .Back when it had a true investment rating and an A+ credit rating .All that blew up when Vicky decided to expand the horizons and build a huge production company by merging with Anadarko . A Permian Powerhouse they said . Now we hear that APC management fraudulently puffed up numbers . OXY fell all over itself to become the high bidder to its own demise . That Vicky still has her job today is THE biggest surprise of all to me ."
Vicki just mentioned there's multiple offers and that divestitures will not be a problem at all
It’s only fair this goes up on low volume. It fell almost 12 percent on low volume from 28 to 24
The market shakes out the winners from the losers. It wants you to feel pain and sell. All you have to do is hold tight and be ready for the next leg up!
9 vaccines now in phase 3 testing.
"Everything Vicki has preached has soured since she took over. What's more puzzling is why would they buy the old Conoco building and start renovations if they knew they were buying Anadarko when there was no way the new location would hold all those employees (OXY/Anardko)? The Anadarko purchase came up put of the blue IMO and perhaps OXY was a target to get bought which is why they rushed the deal, used Warren and avoided a shareholder vote......"
Wti broke last resistance and trading at 43.7 next resistance 45.60! This should move OXY!
"I bought 3800 shares, average is $13.5 and I am very happy with the investment"
"Now that’s out of the way, we can focus on actually WTI PRICING and forward earnings"
NOW FOLKS - If Donald Trump the BUILDER....would have done infrastructure he would have been re-elected no matter what BUT he went for easy money like he did in his own business world and likely why he was bankrupt 6 times. His son said they got their money from Russia and not American banks....but whatever - if he left gets the keys to where he is hiding all of this information then he is toast. And if Hunter Biden did something wrong he should be toast as well as Joe if he did something but all investigations came up EMPTY. That is not the case with Trump because he has been able to stop all investigations so far. So we shall see. NO ONE SHOULD BE ABOVE THE LAW - left or right or center white or black or tan or red or yellow or green or orangeman....honesty and integrity should rule the day along with an even playing field for all and always stay that way. Boolean
Thank you thank you thank you. I enjoyed that monster Yak this morning and bought more at $11.80. Yeah baby!!
Shorts buying lunch. Enjoy longs. I suggest seafood paid for by short Mehmet. Enjoy
"Can someone here answer this question?What was Vicki and the BOD thinking when they overbid CVX for the money losing Anadarko company?And dealing with Warren for 800m per year interest?These people were in way over their head and Warren took them lock,stock and barrel"
RELAX
with ebita of 4-6 billion they can easily pay debt and move the stock up....I see that momar does not post on any boards except this one..
https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1207329/carl-icahn-boosts-stakes-in-xerox-occidental
Buffet bought about $1 billion in Oxy Nov 2019 at $37.50 a share. You can better believe that’s a benchmark that you should watch for the n the future.
"we have WTI break $42, good API number, with likely OPEC extension cut.. basicly for everything for another jump for oil stock."
Any diehards here that still insist that buying high and that collecting a dividend while the stock craters is perfectly ok should just consider sending ME a check . I’ll send you 8% for 10 years and then you can get 100% back . Same deal as WB gave OXY .
"Stock doesnt follow WTI up but a drop for 50-60 cents on 65 barrels will take half the profits off the table LOL ""sure thing"""
"Until they pre announce some positive news I don't see any reason for any major move before earnings on the 10th. Analysts earnings looks better , still a loss but now only -.31 vs -.41 a little over a week ago . Oil over 63 and it can not break 25 , if earnings and FCF were anywhere close to what some are guessing it would be higher but earnings and FCF will not be close to their guess . Look for better earning and increased production in 2nd or 3rd quarter when new wells come online and start of CO2 injection in one of the older fields in the Permian. Still think we will be in the low -mid 30s at year's end , that's still a good run for the year."
"my recommendation is to sell a portion of your holdings, and buy back when there is more visibility on opec's decision today. a complete hold on supply doesn't make sense at all!"
diamond hands. 40 by summer
"WHY DID BUFFET SOLD HIS SHARES AND WHY ARE YOU HOLDING OCCIDENTAL BANKRUPT SHARES?Occidental Oil Bankruptcy will be announced in June 2021. Occidental Oil has 41.5 billion US Dollars debt. It takes 857 years for Occidental to pay its debt. When announced, Occidental shareholders including YOU will have to pay the corporate debt. Buffett and Carl sold all their shares for this reason"
So stupid Vicki Hollub can't make money in this disaster of a company that she created with oil at $60+ dollars what will she do when oil falls back to $40 or less? She'll get a big fat raise that is for sure at shareholder expense.
"if fcf for next year is 1.5 to 2 billion a quarter, this is going to pop so hard"
"is the consensus OXY will go bancrupt? Cannot see why it won't. Crude will rise slowly over the next year, very slowly. There is a glut of supply, and storage worldwide is filling fast."
Can we touch 30's anytime soon?
"Supporting my thesis that oil, while currently weak, will shake out more independents thereby sending them to BK. Overall production will continue to drop. This will build pricing pressure. I still believe we are going to see around $50 oil by end of summer, late September. Seems to me that this immediate weakness in the mid to low $30's will give way to a rise in the next few weeks. We tested the $40this week and production is still dropping. Yes, storage is still high, but when we have balance with production/consumption then the undercurrent of consumption will have already picked up steam. It will pass this enormous production reduction that is in place at the moment. IMO, 3 months.https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/offshore-shipping-players-in-dire-straits/"
"I am still waiting on someone to tell me what CI is going to do other than TRY TO SELL THE NEW COMPANY , he has not said one thing about trying to help the company or grow it . ONLY SELL, SELL, SELL!!!!! And if you think he will get a big premium for it , just look at the total debt it took on and APC's earning and combine the two companies PE and see what you get . Plus there will be about 145,000,000 new OXY shares to be given to the APC stockholders !"
"Nice reversal. Chevron said their average price per barrel in the 1st quarter was $48. So far, oil is averaging just over $60 for the first month of the 2nd quarter. Should stay in the $60's. This should be way higher...."
"when is this thing going to stop, everyday is hitting a new low"
I see close at 28.25 today. Based on il futures activity
This is a $30.00 stock short term.
OXY is the biggest no brainer investment for the next 2 years
***** AND--- we DO I have $66/bbl crude @ the opening..... won't be long will see the $70 level... maybe in two weeks!!*****deepsub
"Remember this message: Interest rates will be raised at the end of 2021 when economy starts to recover. We are in midst of housing bubble. Market will start to crash. Money will rotate to commodities and commodity driven stocks, oil, gold, silver, rare earth, grocery stores. Can already be seen in rise of grocery chain stocks"
OXY will announce Second Quarter results on 07/30/2020 after the close. My guess that the y will have an EPS loss of $1.22. What are your guesses?
"Crude Oil Inventories 1.321M , Gasoline Inventories -1.963M, EIA Weekly Distillates Stocks -2.324M Better than forecasts on all three!!!"
"Really feel like there's a lot of people trying to push this price down. Lets face it. The call went good and earnings went very well. Debt was paid down, not to the extent many wanted, but Q2 will have more chopped and the values of the assets they hadn't sold yet have gone up quite a bit meaning it will be easier to get back to the acceptable levels they were looking for. They stated to see a lot more in Q2."
Almost 18 million volume. That’s a lot of new investors. Keep it coming! New buyers are always good to bring new support
"Its not fully clear at the moment, but if this breaks above $41.50ish in a solid move, then its going to spring much higher. $45 will be next stop. OXY is going to bolt higher if we get that. I believe we are at the base of a solid run."
Exxon just escorted UAW workers off their property. Couldn't come up with an agreement with Union workers. You can raise the price of oil now pls.
"I told you guys to buy JWN on Friday! Energy has already ran up 50-60% this year. Brick and mortar retail is still depressed. Think about all of the weddings, events, and in person class that’s coming back nationwide! Everyone hates brick and mortar retail just like everyone hated energy 3-4 months ago."
"Strong buy, no way you dont see 30 again by June, just grab all the warrants or shares you can, crude will not break 55 again and this is grossly oversold due to Icahns dumping and a general flat energy sector the last few weeks with no catalysts."
"Investing is about narrowing the odds by using the figures you can determine...is some cases its just pure #$%$ runs like many tech stocks or other than have 100-1000 pes,However you can do some math...they produce about 500 million barrels per year...they cut cap ex first 2.9 billion and then cut the dividend which appears to have been 2 billion per year and then synergies about 500 million so for the rest of this year about 5 billion or so in cuts...so that is about 10$ per barrel in lower costs ..average cost brent and wti is about 44 plus 10$ per barrels of 100 million barrels so about another billion ..so another 2$ per barrel effect ..so 12$ per barrel effective cost reduction ad that back to actual barrel prices now of 44 and you come up with 56$ for equivalent evaluation...obviously rough figures but based on earnings data and prior data ..this of course will change by 1 billion for loss of hedge next year ..HOWEVER WHEN THEY LOWERED CAPEX IT WAS FROM OVER 5 BILLION SO CAPEX MAY STAY AT 2 BILLION OR SO..that is why the 38-39 next year break even and not 42 ..no dividend and half the cap ex of last year ...even with break even of 38-30 they can have ebita of about 3-4 billion at the current levels or about 4.5 to 5.75 per share of ebita"
"***** I didn't see anybody post about the article from November 11th.....Vitol, the world's largest oil trading firm cited two companies to watch.......DVN & OXY. Both recent advances in the stock price and both on increase volume indicating to The firm the probability of institutional buying activity. Their Target price for oil in 2021 is $50 per barrel....... I think they're a bit conservative but also they didn't say in which quarter they would expect to see that price...... my own opinion (like holes, everybody has one). LOL.......... we could see $50 a barrel in the first half of 2021 I'm $55 in the second half..... or more. DVN just crossed above its 200-day moving average an increased volume, and OXY in the last 10 days or so has gone up 27% approx. and the firm cease resistance levels going forward at about $24 and then at $37 per share........ one of the things that stood out for both E+P operators was ability to create FCF at lower oil prices then many in the oil patch..... all in all it sounds like some good news starting to leak out !!CHEERS !!*****deepsub"
Bank of America expects oil prices to recover to $60 a barrel for Brent crude in the first half of next year thanks to shrinking global inventories and prices improving faster than previously expected.Interesting article... does it matter?
"Markets are anticipating that the Fed continues to make no changes to its interest-rate guidance, and likely is somewhat tempered in its expectations for the economic outlook. With that, you would get this return to a trend of low rates, low growth, growth stocks outperfoming. Just hang on Long. This is temporary."
"the last time wti at 66, oxy was 32....well wti is almost 66 again....we are a long way from 32."
OK the majority of the analyst studying the oil market in 2019 know oil is not the same commodity as it was in the past. It is my understanding that Vicki pushed the purchase of Anadarko. Her timing to buy Anadarko at the price she paid in my opinion was made in hast. This company stock would be down with the others but not as much as it is down today. Remember its has been down ever since the purchase was made. If the shareholders had a say in the purchase the shareholders would be responsible for the current price. I didn't get a chance to hear the conference call so if anyone could share what the positive things Vicki had to say I would greatly appreciate it. I do not know if she was asked the question what funds are being used to pay off debt associated with the Anadarko acquisition. And whats up with the charge of approximately $1.0 billion to reflect Occidental’s investment in Western Midstream Partners and the 10 billion in deferred income tax liability. I am waiting to see the 10-Q to see what she got paid in 2019. Thanks for your comments.
surpassed average volume already with an up go 4% so far today!
They want to reduce debt as much as possible and as fast as possible.. but that’s just part of the story for lowered costs
"Wow Occidental. Great job. Tell this to the new prez. >>>>""""https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Occidental-Delivers-World-First-Carbon-Neutral-Oil.html """""
OXY is trading opposite to Crude price. So strange!
"According to Baron's, stay away from OXY if Biden is elected. Quote - Biden and Energy StocksEquity ResearchWells Fargo SecuritiesSept. 1: Donald Trump’s re-election would keep the conventional oil-and-gas industry in a favorable political environment, in our view. By contrast, a Joe Biden victory would place the oil-and-gas industry in the opposite position, in our opinion. We base these conclusions on the statements and actions of the first Trump administration, as well as the public statements, party platforms, and policy proposals of both candidates for 2020, and our analysis.More so than in past elections, the immediate and longer-term prospects for the oil-and-gas industry appear quite dependent upon the outcome of the 2020 election. The stated policies of a first-term Biden administration would likely undercut prospects for oil-and-gas growth and investment and potentially shorten the useful lives of existing assets. The refining and natural-gas/electric-power sectors are specifically highlighted within the Biden campaign’s policy proposals for decarbonization and emissions reductions. In front of the election, we believe that companies with diversified operations, significant international exposure, and less exposure to undeveloped federal lands/offshore will be less risky choices.Thus, in the pre-election interim, we favor [companies] such as Overweight-rated Chevron (ticker: CVX) and BP (BP). While we remain favorably disposed toward several refiners, the potential for a Biden victory is likely enough to keep most investors on the sidelines, at least until the election results are known. We would be very careful investing in highly leveraged oil and gas companies like Underweight-rated Occidental Petroleum (OXY) or Overweight-rated Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT) in advance of the election, given the divergent outcomes.—Roger D.

Is it any easier to play this market? lol
"Price to book: .66Price to Sales: .61Price to cash flow: 1.96Debt to equity: 1.71Cash flow to shares: 8.02The first 3 figures are well below the industry numbers and that’s due to debt to equity and cash flow to shares. Essentially when oxy can produce more cash flow to reduce their debt than it is 1000 percent likely that their price will increase. Basic logic. Oil prices goes up, cash flow comes in , debt goes down and throw in some asset sales and this stock can go 2 to 4 times its current value depending on how low it can get its debt to equity and cash flow to shares down. This is the type of gamble you want to make...oil is historically low and demand increase globally, a war, or even just pre Covid numbers will boast up WTI. Getting in now Before majority of ppl see the big picture is what separates the men from the boys."
"Stimulus agreement next week. Time to relax and enjoy a constant ride up. OPEC+ increased supply by 500,000 barrels. Nothing compared to how fast the economy will grow in 2021. I see WTI at $60 summer 2021. Oil is going higher and so is OXY. Have a great evening. Hope shorty Mehmet wakes up. But we all know Jesus could not save them all"
need good news. Sending good vibe
"Alan, coming out at full forces !!! I have noticed anytime oxy up good and surprised ...Alan got hurt and screaming !!!! lol...."
Upgrades coming.
"based on a email with investor relations there were 17,274,130 million shares issued to Berkshire. Oxy has the right to pay in cash, stock or accrue the interest."
"EIA report comes out tomorrow, if inventory goes down, which I’m hoping it will, then we see a spike this week. If it goes up, then we may see another buying opportunity."
Correct info..Icah holdings has about 2.71 billion of oxy stock and his WHOLE FUND IS WORTH 17-20 BILLION HE IS SELLING ON THIRD OVER A PERIOD OF TIME...this will leave him with close to 2 billion in a fund worth 17-20 billion...still 10% of his funds value.....if prices stay this high they will have about 6-7 billion per year in free cash flow based on their numbers
Can someone tell me what are the risk of buying OXY Warrents instead of options?
No stimulus until after election Trump says.... I’m a Trump supporter but man this is not going to help him get re elected
Stay above 26……

Cut about 3.5 billion in cap ex...about 1.5 billion in dividend and about another 750 million in synergy savings ...about 6 billion ...pump about 500 million barrels per year so about 12$ per barrel less than previous ....yes their CASH FLOW BREAK EVEN is about 31-32....Remember guys anadarko was one of the largest nat gas producers AND NATURAL GAS HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN THE PAST MONTH WITH NO END IN SIGHT....Oxy will start to make waves with the largest carbon capture plant in the world and the potential to build and license this tech in the US...THEY INVESTED WITH BILL GATES AND CHEVRON IN THE CANADIAN TECH COMPANY....had to push out the stock recovery slightly dues to resurgence...target april for % gains...nothing left in tech...

Brent $75+ and with any luck Holidays will continue the draw on storage supplies for another 2+ weeks."
please stay above 24.......
WTI flerting with $65+ and OXY is red. Sometimes I wonder if this stock really is in the crude business... It certainly doesn’t seems to care about how high oil price is ... This quarter better deliver.
lot of action after hours on Friday over 6 million shares don't know if they were a seller or buyer does anyone know?
"Oxy normally should boost double digit percentage to 24 usd. Ridicolous valuation, not explainable. Oxy gets 53 usd , this will create big profits and Cashflow to paydown debts. News from land sale and oil assets with 6 Mrd usd for both should boost the share to 30 usd and more. I am adding shares. This all is my opionion."
when wti was in the low to mid 50s this stock was in the 40s...and they had about 2 billion in dividends and about 2.5 billion more in capex...they have decided to spend about half as much next year...so about 4.5 billion less...they will pump about 450 million barrels so thats about 10$ per share less in costs....so of wti is 48 and brent 51 and ten less in expenses .......

Blue hydrogen...posted here about a year ago about OXY becoming a major supplier of blue hydrogen....if you you do any research you will find that green hydrogen costs about 3xs as much as blue hydrogen and they expect pricing to stay that way for about another 10-15 years..in the mean time hydrogen is expected to grow ....blue hydrogen production and carbon capture come hand in hand..with OXY MAJOR pipeline network and superior direct air capture they could soon be charging for CO2 removal services and then selling blue hydrogen....SA sold an entire ship load of blue hydrogen last year

"Here's my opinion for you: Investing in oil companies like Oxy today, is investing in energy transition to greener options. They have the backbone to transform the energy landscape, and can be profitable during this transition process."
You see this pattern every QTR. Transition into stocks for the next QTR starting in April. Oil stocks will start reporting end of April first of May. Brokers take profits for window dressing end of month and QTR.
Anyone know how much money oxy can make off their chlorine production with the chlorine shortage going on? Are they locked into long term production contracts or can they benefit immediately?

"Posting this again in case someone wants to comment :) Bought OXY a while ago in 14s. In case the oil prices raise and stay between $45 and $50, my question to the ones who really understand the finances of this company is, do you believe we will see a dividend in 2021? If not, when do you believe it will happen? Would it be around $3.14 again? I will hold long regardless of the comments, but just curious what you guys think. $OXY and $CVI all the way! :)"
"Got in at $22 last year when the SP was really high. Averaged down to $18. But then, I saw the SP go down to $8.50 and saw more than 60% of investment disappeared.

"Personally, I prefer that the stimulus package gets done AFTER the election. I firmly believe that not only will Trump be re-elected to a second term, but he will also retain the Senate and win the House. Then a truly effective stimulus package will be passed."
Something very fishy oil 39.71 and oil related stocks down  
"A lot of external factors.I think people who bought in above 16 are better off holding. Don't sell at a profit loss.If you buy below 15 that's fair.Under 13, good for you.Company just needs time in their current position. Overall bullish long on oil but a lot of external factors. Very volatile can go up and down drastically. The bottom seems closer for oil and the ceiling is much further than we are to the bottom.I'd say this is a good gamble if you're bullish.If you short don't hold a position too long if you secure a profit.Very easy to read this versus hospitality imo"

I can smell $13 Big boys are rotating out of tech into energy
Oil up to $63.34 up .30%.
Not at all a bad close. Happy long weekend folks.
I just wonder if the TOT deal to sell those properties was done so fast just to get the 8.8 billion for show . Because it seem like TOT got everything they wanted he even thanked VH for the deal. Was it sold too cheap ?
Our day is coming soon shorties
A lot of buy orders looks like we can hit $40 end of next week and $50 end of march.
This year will ofset everything in 2020
it's good opportunity to buy
Mehmets wife is excited he sold one put today for a 4% loss..
Any chance that it can recover? I bought at 15.8 and 14.8 should i sell?
"There is going to be sweeping reform to Federal Land Drilling Programs. One of the primary flaws of the current program, according to Sec Interior Haaland, is that those federal lands belong to more than just the oil and gas industry—they belong to everyone.How is this a challenge to OXY? Can it make OXY assets that are not on Federal Land more valuable relatively speaking?"
"To better understand this stock, right now OXY is trading at about $53.50 a share. That's 40 for the debt, and 13.50 for the share. todays drop of 50 cents (so far) may look large if you think of this being a 13.50 stock but if you see the whole picture, the debt and the share price together, a drop of 50 cents is almost flat, less than 1% change. Another way to think of it is, your buying shares with 4 to 1 margin, one part share price, 3 parts debt. Now you see why you need to be really careful at what you pay. If OXY is a 40 billion dollar or less company, the shares are worthless. If OXY is an 80 billion dollar company, the shares are worth, $40 each. If crude stays at these levels for 10 years, OXY is a zombie just paying the interest on the debt, If crude stays at or below 36, OXY will eventually file bankruptcy. Now factor in all the effort to electrify driving and go solar and wind and you better understand the risk. Now if OPEC dosn't cheat on quotas and nonOPEC doesn't start poking holes in the ground in places that are still profitable, and crude stays here until the economy fully opens and assuming the economy isn't in a depression at that time, oil could rally to some high price that makes the risk worth it. A lot of if's and that's why oil stocks are in the sewer and might stay there. Oh, and god only knows what the democrats are going to do after the election, outlaw new oil drilling?"
"Bank stocks are soaring today!!!

"Colonial Pipeline said it’s restoring service to lateral lines “and will bring our full system back online only when we believe it is safe.” While tank farms typically have a few days of stored fuel supply, a prolonged outage could lead to a spike in fuel prices. A criminal group known as Dark Side may be responsible for the attack, NBC News reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter."
Gasoline supplies are almost depleted. The oil draw next week will be so crazy it will be the biggest draw in history
"Prices for Crude Oil haven't been doing too hot lately, as we continue to retest levels below sixty dollars. However, companies such as Callon continue to hold strongly at these levels due to their financially well-off balance sheet, and it's reassuring seeing hedge funds finally see the value in our company. In my honest opinion, we should already be in the $50-$60 range with these oil prices, perhaps it'll be priced in closer to our next earnings report. On top of this, consider the fact that OPEC just edited their outlook for 2021 oil demand, stating it is projected to be HIGHER in mbpd comparatively to previous reports, though they lowered short term targets due to Europe shutting down again. To me, this signals we're going to break out to new highs in the $75 WTI range on the same news that's been crashing us -- you heard it here first, headlines will read 'Oil bullish on European reopening,' as OPEC and Sauds also have it all in their best interest to hike up oil prices since American energy independence is a thing of the past. Hold, stay diligent, and check back in Q4 as you thank yourself later. $CPE $XOM $MRO $CDEV $OXY"
"Can everyone calm down good lord lol its literally a 8% pullback today only on ridiculously bad timing from OPECs garbage combined with post vaccine hype profit taking, if it gets lower keep topping off its $10 off 52 week bottoms with vaccines in full distribution by march lol...once the market stops pumping things like peloton to $125 and tesla pulls back after the 21st from $650 i promise you it will be a fast few days where this just moves like the retail sector and then its too late if you've missed at that point....literally the last sector left behind with crude stabilizing OVER 45 per barrel...."
very undervalued
oil just fell to $28.....

Apollo Buys media assets from Verizon which include yahoo. Maybe Apollo can figure out the right way to run yahoo. Verizon certainly could not.
"To me, the rumors of an possible sale of assets in Oman, Ghana and elsewhere are comforting and bodes well for Q3 and Q4 results. The issuance of OXY WS is also a positive and another step forward towards having a clearer picture of what lies ahead for OXY. After noting the ability of WTI to stay above $41 per barrel I have been revising my estimate as to the earnings that OXY will be reporting on 08/10/20 after the close of trading. My previous estimate was that OXY would report a loss of $-1.42 per share. I now think that the loss will be smaller. My new estimate is that OXY will report a loss of $1.22 which is much better than the analysts concensus estimate of -$1.67. I think that if I am correct in my EPS estimate OXY could rise to $21.00. I also think that if the reported loss is smaller than -$1.12 the stock will rise to $24.00. Just my opinion. Do your own research."
"Robert PetersonNo. We did touch on that a little earlier. And the share prices, we don't have an intention on issuing any additional equity to pay down debt."
Ohh... boys.... making my day!
"The best way to resolve OXY's problem with Icahn and other irate OXY stock holders is simple. Buffett just uses some of his Berkshire money to buy all of OXY. According to Warren Buffett's 2018 annual letter released earlier this year to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Berkshire had $112 billion. Buffett has said that he wants to acquire an entire business. Buffett has said he only likes to have about $20 billion in cash reserves. He stated - ""We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition."" Buying OXY plus APC would be a nice size ""elephant"" - probably the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin."
What time is the call please?
"Next resistance levels are around 19.50 and then 20.40 after that it might refill up to 24 where it had gapped down. Be ready to take some profits in the near future and then let the rest ride , don't let some bad news take it all back.Take at least what you first invested and then ( even thou it is still your money in the stock ) you can say you are playing with the casino's money . Would love to see the low 20s before years end then sell some to cover other losses before year end for taxes."

"This marginal increase is very positive. It finally marks a growth in consumption that is identified by the producers. This production increase should be in line with consumption or at least trailing its rise. OPEC+ wont out produce, but they can incrementally increase production and still have overall reduction in storage. A major win win. The sentiment is changing. Side note,The hiccup by the Suez Canal plugging will have a minor ripple effect. But, an effect nonetheless. It should be felt in the next 2 weeks or so. I predict that after the initial hiccup, then all these tankers will head back to get more oil but will cause a bottleneck at the loading docks in SA. Kind of like a slinky effect. Some minor volatility but overall storage lowering IMO. Now, can those tankers get back in time for the full on Summer season?"
If oil hit 44 real quick I wonder it that would put the pressure on OXY mang . They said they were good down to 45 for oil.
$OXY's 6-month chart shows a fully formed cup & handle and the early stages of a breakout. Great!
Oxy bought Anadarko for $57B and outbid CVX - They just had to have it. Oxy is now worth $11B. Ouch. I'd say fire the executive staff.
"They can manipulate after hours all they want. But everyone I know is buying in, they’re gonna get squeezed"
why is OXY not participating in today's rally ?
Just end the day already. Let’s start new tmr

"They are only shorting because this company is high beta, it moves with the oil market, so when oil crashed couple weeks ago the shorts came out in full force. They will be running for the hills soon…..BUY BUY BUY NOWWWWW"
Won’t be long before we get some free advertising as OXY starts showing up on 52 week highs list.
We are rocking now. $20's very soon. No resistance until the $25 area.
Just .10 to go in the pre market to recover yesterday's little drop.Should be a good day today.
The oil price has been decoupled to oil stocks for last 3-4 weeks. The only thing that can save us is 1. a positive earning report 2. Covid case going down.

"Folks the pipeline that is shut down is a gas/fuel pipeline and not an oil one, if it remains shut the price of fuel will rise but we could actually see an inventory build as they can’t move the supply to meet demand which is why prices would rise for fuel"

Nice looking reversal today with decent volume. They love to shake out the weak hands. Will see how this plays out in the coming days. (Side note: It is funny how many bears come out on days like this. Do you like watching people lose money?)
"Even though a poison pill has been put into effect to thwart a hostile takeover, oxy's management has already filed the necessary legal papers for a change in control other company. the top officers are guaranteed to receive extended payroll, bonuses and medical coverage for their families....... golden parachutes for sure ........ well planned out......... only three companies come to mine that could pull something off like that in my mind would be at Chevron or Exxon Mobil or BP......... wouldn't that surprised everybody and drop a wrench in the gears of the whole situation for oxy and its shareholders,! and just because of the price of the stock is temporarily low during this time does not mean that's the price that will be paid for the company....... it doesn't work like that. While oxy wouldn't get top dollar at this time it would sure get a price way above current level....."

"OXY, BTE, XOM, SU going to be great again!"
OXY was at 40 USD Oil price was at 60 plus and it borrowed 10B from Warren Buffet. And it was much before COVID. Since then OXY accumulated more losses and debt on top of 36B. All those expecting OXY to cross 40 are simply unaware of these statistics.
• Vicki Hollub indulges her delusions of grandeur.• Warren Buffett laughing all the way to the bank.• OXY shareholders get the shaft with stock now at at a 10-year low.
"I would have thought when the Board announced (restated) the Dividend would be paid and not cut, that the stock would haveRallied and stayed higher Today....Boy was I wrong.... In a weird way, since the Dividend is so much OVER what it really should be, a small dividend cut IMO would save Zillions, and go along with asset sales, might actually be OK. A Dividend CUT, I promise ya, it's already somewhat in the stock.."
Nice bit of volume. We are already at the average and its barely mid day.
WE WARNED PEOPLE HERE THAT OCCIDENTAL IS BROKER STOCK PRICE CAPPED AT 31.5 USD. I AM SCREAMING AGAIN SELL NOW IT WILL FALL BELOW 20 US DOLLARS SHARE PRICE IN LESS THAN 4 WEEKS.
Daydreaming of dividend increase. Hoping they can bring it back by sometime next year. I would like some guidance now so I at least feel good about holding long.
"How to Sell or Exercise a WarrantA warrant holder may choose to exercise the warrant if the current stock price is above the strike price of the warrant. Alternatively, the warrant holder could sell their warrants, as warrants can be traded similar to options.If the current stock price is below the strike price, it makes little sense to exercise the option, since it is cheaper to buy the stock on the stock market. For example, if the strike of the warrant is $40, and the stock is currently trading at $30, it is not prudent to exercise the right to buy the stock at $40 when it can be purchased at $30. On the other hand, if the stock is trading at $50, and the strike of the warrant is $40, it is beneficial to exercise the warrant. That said, just because the current stock price is above the strike price doesn't mean the warrant has to be exercised. If there is still lots of time until the warrant expires, holding onto the warrants may prove even more profitable.For example, if over the next year the stock rises to $80, the warrant has become more valuable. The stock is trading at $80 and the warrant holder has the right to buy at $40 (and could immediately sell those shares for $80)."
I can't imagine at the very least that the BOD does not reduce Vicki's pay if they keep her on
"How are we feeling about the warrants? Stock looking good today, another buck and I'll be even. Mehmet, bend over."
"Double exponential coming to profits, Rising oil prices, gives stock prices, which gives lower debt refinance options, which gives higher stock prices, which gives less pressure to increase drilling, which gives higher oil prices...Thank you OPEC, Xmas card already in the mail."
Welcome to the church of Oxy
"Bloomberg article talks about the reduction of stored oil to about 20% of its high. This bodes very well for oil stocks especially OXY. If the forecast is correct that $74 Brent is coming soon, OXY becomes a cash machine on steroids. And all of that w/o a Middle East crisis which can happen at any time driving oil to $100."
“Money for nothin and chicks for free!”
"WB places shortsellers in a dilemma, limbo positions. They wonder what the old man is going to do. They don’t dare to Short heavily and they don’t know what to do with open short positions. They ask what can we do??? All they’re doing now is waiting for WTI to drop or bad macroeconomic situation. Arab Saudi Aramco? is about to IPO, and the kingdom will make oil price high to maximize its value. Global economy shows no sign of recession. US and China will reach a trade deal or sort of agreement pending finalization of specific items. Thank you WB."
"Why do u think OXY has doubled in the past month, much more than other oils? Things unique to OXY?"
so many better options in this sector right now selling at a discount and paying a divy still. so long as Vicki is running this company it will not be a wise investment
"Read an inciteful article today, made mention that $40 oil brings the Frackers back on line but it takes $45 to drill new wells. Tells me that the wells coming back on line is a total head fake till we see $45. Every single month we see oil at $40/$41 is causing a steady tightening grip on future production. All these guys that have been laid off are waiting to return to work. Some cant wait that long. The Reality is that once the market returns to $45, the pool of qualified workers will have shrunk. For context, OXY has stated they aren't capex'ing for increased production, they are focusing on existing wells. That only lasts for so long before you have to drill to maintain production. OXY is allowing their production to drift down to 1.2million and than going to hold steady. As I've said all along, the real pain is next spring for production. The reality of all these shut ins and stoppages will come to fruition in approximately 6/9 months. By then, the little Frackers will be BK'd and M&A'd out of existence. The rise will be steady by that point.I called for $60 oil by EOY. I was wrong. Revisit of C19 and the airlines stubborn resistance to returning pre Covid flight norms has gutted my outlook. To me, we have a 'vaccine' limited recovery. Get the vaccine, then the return of the world economy will be back on track. And by the way, the self induced recession took out any risk of a natural/organic recession that might have happened this year. The economy is much leaner. It has reset. It will muddle for a short time, but the trough is in."
"Wow! Up a $1 and this board wants to jump off a Cliff! You all been hurtin for some time right?I feel ya. But, OXY reports and the downward dog is going to Superman. It’s really about the guidance right now. And it’s going to be juicy!"
The big guys know it will rise on Monday pre earnings . So it wouldn’t fall by too much
"The question I would like someone to ask: would you looking back from today on the APC buyout do it. Part two, please justify how virtually destroying the investors here with a stock drop from 70+ to 16 today made sense. All I hear today is ""we are trying to get the balance sheet back to better stance over the next 2 years. IOW, this is a interest paying vehicle, period. One piece of good news, they are planning on paying the Buffet preferred in cash, PROBABLY."
"By the way for you guys who don’t know, Indian refinery run by reliance bought the first shipment of OXY carbon neutral oil. Guess we’re now saving the world"
"Major sector rotation is overdue. Tech stocks are in an extreme overbought bubble. OXY should be trading at least 2X current stock price, which would be conservative on the basis of #$%$et valuations less debt."

There has been a flock of OXY stock sellers on the website. They try to populate sales and momentum to OXY by flawed arguments and incomplete implicit wrong assumptions. They are acting like a team and commenting each other posts. Their aim is to attract small investors money.
"once oil hits $75 it would be $10+ billion fcf a year. if you tske that to payoff debt, then buyback buffett preferred, we would have $10 billion a year to give out in dividends, which comes out to $10/share or almost 30 percent dividend. this is assuming we follow this plan, and oil prices dont change"

"On August 12, 2020, Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) entered into an Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters named therein (collectively, the “Underwriters”), pursuant to which Occidental agreed to issue and sell to the Underwriters three series of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3,000,000,000, consisting of (i) $900,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), (ii) $600,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.375% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Notes”) and (iii) $1,500,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 6.625% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes” and, together with the 2025 Notes and the 2028 Notes, the “Notes”). The Underwriting Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and agreements by Occidental and customary conditions to closing, indemnification obligations of Occidental and the Underwriters, including for liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), other obligations of the parties and termination provisions. The offer and sale of the Notes contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement was consummated on August 26, 2020. Occidental will use the net proceeds from the offering of approximately $2,972 million (after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses), to fund the concurrent tender offers described in its Offer to Purchase and Consent Solicitation Statement dated August 12, 2020 (as thereafter amended from time to time), and to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith."
Apc was priced like it was going out of business. Looks at it now. Oxy is too valuable too ignore. Any of these majors can afford to make a bid for it. I wouldn’t be. Short if I was you.

Warren Buffet has many investments like KRAFT HEINZ CO. Some of his investments do not pay off. He gets a guarantee return on this one so he made a good decision. His decision on this company was not made for us common shareholders but for his shareholders. I have been long on this stock for a while but I am not pleased with Vicki's decision to buy Anadarko Petroleum at the price she paid. We will have to see what happens at earnings.
"Berkshire acquiring oxy? Some rumors? I don’t think so, I guess Exxon will make a Deal. Their exploration costs are much higher than paying 25 usd per share +debts. No problem to finance this deal. The debts are no issue for Exxon ....a great deal for Exxon."

OXY needs WTI $40 a barrel to be sustainable. The gamble with OXY investors that if you see oil crashing below $40 then bye bye OXY it will go bankrupt. Current price of $49. With prices expected to go up 2021 it only looks positive from here.
So apple when up 200$ per share in 7 months..nivida about 200 tesla about 1000..the airlines are still trading in ranges that make no sense because they need about 80% fill rates to make money and cruise lines forget about it....they are not even open and no end in sight...yet oil stocks(GOOD ONES) ARE still down in most cases 50-60%...many have rebounded off their lows significantly like apa xom oxy..bp demand is about 85% of what it was!!! airlines are at about 25% previous demand...cruises 0% casinos 20% hotels ?? 25%....tech everyone is guessing that things are double what it was previrus...?? so with oil demand at 85% and all the player adjusting supply something no other industry can do except farms......are things so bad FOR OIL...THEY ARENT
Let’s be honest tycoon mehmet is driving oxy down obvious no?! He’ll buy now what a bargain!!! Loaded rocket abt to launch 
I watch CNBC every day this passed week there's two money Manager said buy OXY they all say energy is coming back this year.
"Compared to the higher interest rates Buffett received from previous similar situations, OXY paying only 8% tells me that Buffett considers the OXY-APC deal to be less risky from other financing deals. That bodes well and says a lot that is positive about this deal. https://www.investopedia.com/the-art-of-the-deal-by-virtuoso-warren-buffett-4686091?utm_campaign=quote-yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&yptr=yahoo"
"The oil producers are being BK now and they can't come back to the market once the oil price start heading north. This is because the banks are not lending any money to them, as well as their bonds are rated garbage. You just can't finance anything in the oil sector currently and the foreseeable future. OXY is having trouble with their debt now means the entire oil sector is heading BK. Next year, you will see an unthinkable oil price above $100, and there will be a huge bubble in the oil sector for those survivors in this industry, including OXY. You buy when everyone hates and sell when everyone loves."
"Raphaël DuBois Societe Generale Cross Asset Research - Equity AnalystThe first one is about your hedging for crude oil. I was a bit surprised not to see a new slide on this in your presentation package. Couldyou please remind us what is your position on the hedging? And can you confirm that you didn't take further positions in Q4?Robert Peterson Occidental Petroleum Corporation - Senior VP & CFOThanks, Raphaël. So just historically, the company is not one that's regularly engaged in hedging, preferring to realize the prices over thecycle, that delivers the most value for shareholders. But we did, to your point, with our increased leverage, take on an oil hedge in 2020that had a collar in 2020, but then it also had a call provision in 2021.So the only thing remaining from that oil hedge is the call provision in 2021. We have put in place, as the slide deck shows, Slide 20,natural gas hedges for 530 million standard cubic per day as of 12.31 with a value between 2.50 and 3.64 on a costless basis, similar to acost of basis we had on the hedge oil last year. There's no extending call option though on the gas side.We continue to evaluate additional hedges, particularly on the oil side on a regular basis. We evaluate the cost of doing so versus notdoing so. As you can imagine, doing a pure put is still fairly expensive despite the improvement in price. And a costless type collar hedgeis going to require both the cap in the current year in addition to the one we have hanging over us today last year's hedge, extending oneinto 2022.And so we look at the -- we moved the debt maturities down quite a bit in the near term, which is somewhat of a hedge againstdownturns in the business in the near term. We also know that shareholders appreciate our heavy exposure, leverage to oil price. And sowe have not put something in place as of now, but we're going to continue to evaluate them and see if they're going to be constructive inthe future"
Anyone know at what price Warren Buffett sold all OXY?
OXY has been my favorite trading stock - however today’s news gives me pause on trading it for the time being . I believe OXY’s next best chance to recover from this news debacle is earnings where I expect a solid beat .
"OXY in a prime position. OXY will come out of the other side of the pandemic looking like a hero. Oil is starting to trend on Reddit too, OXY was mentioned."
BE PATIENT GUYS ! WE WILL SEE ON FRIDAY THE COMMITMENT AMONG OIL RICH NATIONS TO MAKE not Only 10% PRODUCTION CUT BUT between 12% to 15% ! OXY WILL JUMP ABOVE 20 by FRIDAY CLOSING. Buy MORE.
I think OXY will close around 27.5 today.
Green in a sea of red? Bullish. Any other day this would have been a $2 gain. Hopefully not an opportunity wasted to move up.
Oil holding steady @ 60.50 brl. on API report.
3th day of huge move in OXY long term bonds....that is most important sign
It’s starting folks. US is almost 100% back open. Look at oil and look at the nasdaq. Bubble is starting to pop.
"Oil stocks will be very reactive to oil price movement until the country is fully reopen and we have at least one solid earnings behind us, especially this one since its debt is extremity high, but we all know oil is going up and things are getting better"
Earning call next Monday will be good.
"The chart. The 50 day moving average is $26.74. If we get through that level on volume, then $32.50 is the next target."
"Banning the federal land fracking means wiping out smaller oil producers in the US. This policy will hand over larger market shares to big oils, which include OXY domestically, while handing over the oil price control to OPEC and Russia. This will also increase the WTI oil price due to lesser oil supply. In long-run, this is good for OXY."
"Algeria blocks sale of assets to Total , no sure how that will fit in right now"
"(Bloomberg) -- Oil surged to the highest in more than a year after the OPEC+ alliance surprised traders with its decision to keep production unchanged, signaling the potential of an even tighter market next month."
Oil majors are selling off much more than tech. What are people thinking
Longs front of their monitors now!
"--Mizuho Securities Adjusts Occidental Petroleum's Price Target to $36 From $33, Maintains Buy RatingMT NEWSWIRES 7:51 AM ET 5/17/2021"
"Only a fool would sell at this point if you are holding stock, options are a different matter but if you play with options you should be sophisticated and not guessing. The only reason this isn't at the border of 31 is a boring algorithm dump again before its all rebought by next Tuesday again probably lol. Just chill and sit back"
sell-off at low volume again
"Ah, man, just went to male coffee, come back...stopped out.Good to luck all."
WTI over 65 again
"In 2012 after COP split with Phillips, OXY’s market capitalization was greater than COP’s. Now COP has a market cap of $69B and OXY is $40B. What does that tell you about OXY management?"
". OXY was in the low $40's until about 1 week before SA decided to ramp up production on March 9. OXY was losing steam leading up to that announcement due to oversupply issues on the world scene. Oil was at low $50's early February and drifted to low $40's late February. By March 1 WTI was at $41.28, and OXY was $32.95 to close on the 2nd. By the 16th of March oil was crushed all the way down to $22.43. OXY ended that day at $12.02. Mind you, that the market was scared at this point and couldn't quantify the way out of this debacle. Now, OiL is $14.27, which is much lower AND we just saw negative oil, and where is OXY? At $13.02. The market is able to extrapolate the outcome with some sense of reasonableness. Its still a moving target to be sure, but the production is grinding to a halt and in a hurry. Now there is talk of turning imported oil away. That in itself will help the physical market to head off the doomsday scenario of no where for oil to go.Still think we see $20 by May 10th or so. And $30 by end of year."
"***** I probably follow about a dozen or more oil patch stocks..... and at the end of the day I saw all of them with a bright red bar next to them but the funny part was OXY was the only one down for the day in the four plus percentage range...... while all the rest of them I won't go into each name,.... but they were down in the six seven and eight percent range..... so it stood out quite a bit from the rest in the oil patch that all went down.......FWIW*****deepsub"
"LPI stock hedged much of their production at $55. Massively diluted common stocks ATM. No dividend. The stock dropped 17% after the earning. And then AFTER only 3 days, it recoupe most of its losses by going up 15%. I refuse to believe that when wti is going up, when reopening will take place within a month or two in the states and in Europe. When 5 million people are being vaccinated everyday. When vaccine production is going higher each day. When EPS might turn positive in the second quarter for the first time for oxy in 2 years with FCF over 4 billion dollar/ year at the market cap of 22 billions. That oxy will remain at this price for long. Two months my price target is 30."
Do we need more downgrades to get this to $30.
"Folks this stock isn’t being shorted slot so please educate yourselves, yesterday it was only shorted 11.94% of shares traded, oil stocks generally don’t get shorted a lot as the price of oil can have fast big swings"
WE GO HIGHER. We go to 30 and then on to 40's by later summer...minimum. Boolean
$68 TO $9.......GREAT JOURNEY!!!!!!!
"Barclays just increased its 2021 WTI outlook to $52. Erhm, I suspect the bank will be raising its WTI projection again...in a few weeks. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/barclays-raises-2021-oil-view-083823549.html"
***** BRAAAAAHAHAHAAAÀAAAA !!Has anyone seen the price of oil this morning?? THIS stock is a MILLIONAIRE MAKER. ..... all you need is a few bucks to throw in it and some balz............. give it a little time 18 months 2 years.......... YOWZA*****deepsub
"The oil that is coming off line due to this freeze is more disruptive than we all might think. 4-5 mb per day is a global shock. The void caused here will ripple around the world, and already has. Production stopped immediately! 10 days of production stoppage added to the already invasive drawdowns could have 50-60 mb sucked out of storage. When the refineries open back up, the fuel stock piles will be much lower than everyone is comfortable with. The refineries will produce like mad and struggle to keep up as the Spring is upon us as well. Vaccine distribution timing is the perfect storm. IMO, OIL could continue this parobolic trajectory and Not have a breather. I foresee a market that is concerned about OXY production entering Force Majeure. We might get some SP weakness. But the overall macro is going to ignite the balance sheet rocket engines. Q2 and Q3 looks downright scary. We just might be at $65-$70 barrel by April 1. If so, Thays ~$30/barrel or basically $3 billion in cash for the quarter.....The Quarter! $6 Billion in 6 months with a divestment later this year of African assets drops overall debt to under $24 billion. And Vicki just might hang on to those assets with oil going berserk. Why sell assets when the market is heading to Frothy levels. And no, it is NOT frothy at the moment. Its just nervous. We are going to $100. When we hit $80, Vicki better be out pounding the pavement selling her Assets. Then its back to the $3 divvy. If oil keeps rising through the $100 ceiling, and if all these moves have been implemented, then the SP is headed to $80 and even higher. It will be the perfect storm. Now that would be frothy!!"
WHICH STOCK BROKER EMPLOYEE TROLLS ARE ACTIVE TODAY?
"OXY and others ( WLL DNR) should start going up, next will be peak oil kicks in in 2 or more years time. These companies startstream lining operations to effectively make profits, many of these companies could double."
Bloomberg analysts says oil prices not based on supply and demand. Tight oil market yet low price. Economic laws will eventually push prices where they should be. Too much Trump watching and no reality in market period. Dutch
Once gain expect headlines soon about the march 4 opec meeting.....using common sense...think about it the Saudis lowered an extra million and drove the barrel prices up over ten a barrel...now pretend that you are a major opec producer ....what is your reaction....now add to that the fact that just about every if not every US company committed to just replacing production..so now they dont have to worry about lost business ...next how many player are in opec and opec plus..lets use a low number 10 when you amortize production ...is it worth it to raise production 2 million barrels and lower brent to 50 and the only gain is a couple of hundred thousand barrels per player....just imagine if opec decides to share the extra cut with the saudis and pull a reverse...oil would go to 80
Friday's low being taken out!
WTI crushes $64 as OPEC+ agrees to keep production cuts! Congrats longs.
Would it not be nice to have OXY stock price close above $20?
looking for a divy player in energy. looking at tot and OXY. Thoughts appreciated
only thing you can do now is hope there is a war im the middle east however bad that sounds
"The fundamental has been shifted for the oil. The overall supply is now near 5 year moving average. We will be within the 5 year moving average even before the demand is fully recovered by November 2020 if the inventory draw trend is maintained. Once the demand is back to norm, the oil will skyrocket and the oil stock prices will follow the route, and the market will jump into oil stocks. Be PATIENT~!https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.php"
"If, and most likely will, Biden wins, Oil is going to freefall with the snap reaction. Then Oil will climb steadily. Then add an infrastructure bill and Oil is going to come back with gusto. This will all coincide with C19 running its course. If Trump wins, Oil will most likely Not be volatile but steadily rise in the short term. Of course it will rise for all the economic reasons mentioned earlier. But I see volatility with a Biden win."
So Saudi Aramco is currently paying out more in dividends than earnings....and yet it recovered now to IPO PRICE....think about...many if no all investors in that company are the kingpins of oil so do you think they are just throwing their investments away or are they expecting a big spike in oil prices..
"How can anyone on this site still beieve that Oxy will miraculously come back within 5 years? the glut of oil on the market now, plus the effect of a worldwide depression expected next year, had vicki read financial papers, indicate that between the incredible DEBT incurred by the purchase of an already weakened anardarko and the lessened need for oil worldwide, will insure that oxy keeps on dropping.......People fail to understand that bankruptcies result from the failure to satisfy debt , a problem oxy ( vicki and company) will begin to face shortly .....Sadly for most of us , other than the newbies who jumped onto Oxy now that its approaching 40, it will take years of finger crossing to attempt to come back to a hoped for mid sixties......Of course, bankruptcy has a chaince of derailing Oxy along the way.....The expected loss of profit into the next quarter and especially into next year will make the hopefuls on this site understand how badly managed this company is.....yes, a dividend of 8% is enticing and when the stock is at 32, the 9% dividend will look even better......why buy now when you can wait and enjoy 9 %........the irony will be if chevron offers vicki 32 for the failed company down the road......"
how bad will Vicki miss this time and what lies will she tell
"It looks like vicki hollub is finding few friends now on wall street....inside bond traders are pushing for her to vacate her positiion as a first step.....Hopefully, with the finagling she has done to bankrupt a once proud american company, well known since armand hammer 's time she will be found guilty of all sorts of insider trading and financial irregularities.......she certainly belongs in prison once the inside information is eventually released by delaware courts......too bad she wouldn't be placed near ken lay, the other famous finagler, who destroyed enron, same city,same type of energy dealing......he dropped dead just before his sentencing date which was going to be 10-15 years......I think vicki hollub is fighting for her life now because if carl icahn can get delaware to release the private files on hollub's dealings ,especially with a possible buyout by a top company, she would be found guillty of obstruction of financial terms her shareholders were supposed to be told about......This is a big deal and most likely is paramount in her inner thoughts today.......she may still be earning 14million a year but she certainly hasn't been buying any stock......"
$20 guaranteed!
"It was quite amazing to see most oil stocks including oil refinery stocks tanking badly yesterday when Trump started speaking and retaliating again China's raising tariffs with more tariffs. I was contemplating whether I should sell some MPC when it rose to 47.61 (up 1.5%) and before I could blink my eyes, it dropped to as low as 45.56, down 2.8%. I saw OXY and MUR dropping the most among my oil stocks watch list. OXY dropped to as low as 42.17, down 5.66% from Thursday's closing of 44.70, making new 12-mo low. Yet with a qtr dividend of 0.79 with an ex-div date on 9/9/19, its accidental dividend had become a very respectable"
45 days from now lockdowns will ease and bump demand ..China is fully open second largest consumer of oil
Mehmet and Nicole have lost hundreds of thousands on their puts. they have been put out of their misery last Friday
"$XOM $XLE $CVX $OXY $TSLA For those who say oil is dead - executives from American oil and gas companies met with the White House today to discuss the new climate & infrastructure package. It’s notable that Elon Musk, Cathie Wood or the new trendy green CEOs were NOT invited. As I’ve said countless times, existing energy companies will be the leaders with their existing engineering capacity, financial resources and global structure. They will likely receive grants from the infrastructure bull to develop carbon scrubbing tech & alternative fuels. In other words- to invest in $XLE and it’s component companies is to invest in tomorrow’s green companies."
The problems plaguing Occidental primarily involve the company's misguided and poorly timed acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum and a balance sheet that is weighed down by debt. Current market conditions have just made it more difficult for Occidental Petroleum's management to course correct and right the ship
Are these guys still in business?
Let's Go Oxy
Total manipulation.Biden keeps #$%$ off SA and Russia along with his tightening of regs for US oil producers and you will see $100 oil quicker than anyone will dream of!
Just a little more buying guys
5 million shares sold In the first hour
Oxy next earning will be better better better
"We shall see if the chart holds up. Double bottom is in and the inverted head and shoulders wants to settle in the $16/$17 range. By the time we get $50 oil, EOY maybe sooner, OXY will be retesting the 6 month high of $24 and filling the $26 gap. Still believe the dividend is a minimum 15 months away with $10 billion in debt needing to be unloaded first"
"Oil up at the end to 23 usd ....and us government will care for protect the us shale industry. Oxy is one of the best companies with substance. Everybody knows that this company is 60 USD worth in normal times. Oil price will recoverotherwize Trump will cut the connections to the saudis and this will mean...no weapons , no support....and the revolution will bring the Saudi monarchy to end. This is the truth. And Russian is also facing big issues at this oil prieme level. So both will agree on a big cut of oilproduction, the US fracking industry with its small companies will be closed. The big players will survive ....oxy, marathon, chevron, ..."
We had our first decline in oil inventories in 6 weeks. Now we need OPEC to keep the cuts to go higher. Declines are excellent news for the economy!
"It is a little strange that Airlines stocks have nearly gone back to their pre-covid valuations even though air traffic is barely half of pre-covid numbers. Airlines are still loosing money. Similarly, cruise lines are getting close with very little actual cruise revenue coming in. Hotels have nearly made up too. Oil on the other hand, has recovered fully in price and almost there in terms of demand, but oil stocks are still way below their pre-covid valuations. If oil stays in 50-60 range until beginning of summer, this should change and we will be rewarded."
"Market closing red, OXY green, sign of rotation."
***** EIA. #s show a drawdown of almost 700000 barrels of crude.... not a big deal but at least it's not a build like the API numbers showed yesterday..... AP I should just pull the plug and quit reporting....IMHO*****deepsub
"As of Mar 31, 2021, Occidental had cash and cash equivalents of $2,270 million compared with $2,008 million on Dec 31, 2020. At the end of the first quarter, the company had a long-term debt (net of current portion) of $35,466 million compared with $35,745 million on Dec 31, 2020. The decrease in the debt level was due to effective management of debt since the acquisition of Anadarko.For first-quarter 2021, Occidental’s total capital expenditure was 579 million compared with $1,300 million invested in the year-ago period. It expects to invest $2.9 billion in 2021 to further strengthen the existing operations. A total of $2.53 billion was invested in 2020. Out of the 2021 projected capital expenditure, $1.2 billion will be invested in the Permian region to bring new wells online."
"What will OPEC+ do?? Worst case scenario I see OPEC increase supply by 500,000 barrels and SA bring back the 1 million barrels they cut. Not enough to stop oil from heading to $70. especially now that we have a third one doze vaccine and economy about to fully reopen"
We’ll be back to 20s in no time. Not worth the risk of being out or day trading in my opinion. It would be horrible to miss a huge $5-$10 spike. We are trending in the right direction!
maybe oil in the middle east will be disrupted next
"Shorts like Mehmet are sweating lol the OXY giant has awoke from its slumber , nowhere to go but up"
"I will add some shares today, earnings within expectations, 3rd quarter will be much better. Oxy is a bet on oil price recovery, once it will going forward, oxy will rise to old highs at 60 usd."
"Looks like all the BAD news in OXY is behind us. If oil keeps rising, so will the stock price going forward. When I buy a stock, it's for future performance, not past performance."
"All the company officers got their stock awards on May 12th, an we shareholders got the shaft!!!!! Wonderful performance since that great earnings report! That's what all the pumpers on this board said ""great earnings report"". Look at the stock price!"
CRUDE UP 9% today alone. This stock will be reversing in a much stronger way soon. I advise all to hold onto their shares and or repurchase those sold at this time.
"Our insane person in chief wants to cripple our hydro carbons in lieu of renewables. According to Oilprice >>> """"Renewables are currently reliant on lengthy supply chains for finite rare earth minerals and metals including lithium and cobalt, and at present China is in control of more than 90 percent of some of these essential resources. """"So we ditch oil for renewables, then become reliant on China for the rare minerals? What could possibly go wrong. Who voted for this guy?"

What happened to Mehmet Sarkar? Obviously a fake name for him... I think by summer Oxy will go up substantially more. By summer anyone who wants the vaccine can get it and travel..

8% interest!?! Haha Buffet just played Oxy! How did the board approve this!?! Stock will fall another 15%
I hope OXY will reach 30 before my retirement which is 30 years from now.... GLTA...
It’s fairly clear this oil rally was overbought to some degree and is now selling off to some extent taking the players down a few notches with it . Demand is increasing . This will turn around .
"Yeah, we are heading to $25.00."
"Lower crude production due to reduced activity and OPEC+ cuts, coupled with a partial recovery in oil demand, should drive prices higher in 2021. Time is on our side. Get ready to take a vacation to the Bahamas!!"
Surprised that OXY fell below Friday. Amazing. Of course Saudi said that everything is going to be fine. No way everything is rosy in 2 weeks.
"Oil Marks Anniversary of Crash Below Zero With Rally Above $64Tue, April 20, 2021, 5:07 AM(Bloomberg) -- Oil jumped above $64 a barrel, a year to the day after futures for the U.S. benchmark collapsed below zero, with the world’s most important commodity extending a powerful rally on bets for better demand.West Texas Intermediate advanced 1.3%, adding to Monday’s modest climb as the dollar weakened, while production in Libya fell below 1 million barrels a day amid a budget dispute.Oil’s forward curve also suggests growing confidence -- particularly as U.S. demand recovers -- with the spread between WTI’s contracts for December this year and 2022 at the widest backwardation in about a month. Yet there are still reasons to be cautious, with India suffering a fresh wave of coronavirus infections and refiners there starting to curb processing.$CDEV $XOM $OXY $LPI $MRO"
"I’m being greedy now with my big bet on OXY which started paying now. Let’s close above $32 today.Started buying at $24, average down to $16. Around 9 months of patience and it’s paying off now."
Oil going on a sharp run again . Let’s see what happens this week.
Will see green after last week?Oil is up 1.7%

Again if they get rid of Vicki this stock will go up! Another day of this stock going down. I don't understand the Board of Directors keeping her around. The price of oil will be flat for a while so the only catalyst of this stock going up is getting rid of Vicki.
"What a nice lovely day well I love Green colour how nice my account been red for the past 9 months, more Green Day’s to come "
The other bs thing is that 3 oil trading houses control about 20% of all oil traded each day....DO YOU REALLY THINK DEMAND IS DOWN TODAY WITH AIRLINES AND CRUISE LINES CRANKING ....remember when oil went to 40 below...did it really...or was is a paper thing
Look at the volume.
Oil inventories showed some conflicting data this week but at least 1 source showed a slight decrease. Perhaps next week the sources can all show a decrease.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-eases-weak-demand-outlook-222042293.html
"So a Director, who is closer to the inner workings of the Company than anyone on this message board, just bought 20,000 share because he thinks the Company is going BK? I dont think so. Same can be said with Icahn's huge purchase recently."
"Average realised oil price was circa $27/b. We are now at $42/b, that is a 55% increase. Expect the free cashflow generation to be strong in Q3 and Q4, debt will be paid down or refinanced and asset sale will be realised (hopefully a bit more on that tomorrow). Lot of people on here talking about leverage saying it has too much, well I agree - but it can service the debt with current production - if oil holds around 40/50 then this will recover very well thanks."
"The big problem for Vicki and BOD is shareholders were ousted in the decision making process. So, they show utter contempt for shareholder rights/equity. Not big market if buyers for that lovely treatment. But worse, they can never say we made this choice together. Instead they made the choice and every misstep or unforeseen challenge is on them."
nice volume today!
IMO 52 WEEK HIGH. have the oxy guys woken up yet
This is holding up like an absolute champion!
Vicki should forgo her pay and return any money or stock received since the Anadarko purchase. I hope she is held responsible for her actions and a SEC investigation should be performed on her actions prior to and after the Anadarko purchase.
Shorts panicking. Buy today. OXY will be $35 next week. Cut your losses. Indian paid negative posters are losing!!
"This stock is not going anywhere, look at the call options over 38. There is no way the house allows the share price to go up more than 38.5. Option house keeps price in tight control."
FDA meets at 9am and could have a vote by noon..CNN
I would expect only a modest upward move to reverse the over punishment the markets did to the share price. A good quarterly report to show the merger plan is working may be needed before a large leg up can happen. It's obvious that decent crude prices will give us glimpses into what future reports will look like. imo
to clarify below every dollar move in wti and brent over 30-31 is 500 million in profit per year
I had to mute Mehmet. Couldn't take all cap comments from someone that clearly has no idea whats going on. I hope he shorted the stock. Love taking his money haha. Good Luck longs. Shorts better cover
"My fellow OXYs,Quote: ""ALGIERS, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Algeria's state-owned Sonatrach will block Occidental Petroleum's deal to sell Anadarko assets in Algeria to Total, Algeria's energy minister told state news agency APS on Wednesday.""is OXY having issues selling Anadarko assets?Peace!"
"I am an oil/gas guy who thinks BP and ExxonMobil are good for the long haul. That said, the recent runup was nice but unsustainable once the world's bad actors with oil to sell are caught doing what they do. The integrated companies will always be okay. It is poorly funded, heavily indebted companies like OXY that have a real problem. The irrational move from 8+ to over 31 is an easy one to take advantage of. On Tuesday after the meager 4 cent dividend is earned, I will short big time. And to help it along will be the 1.9 billion democrat stimulus bill which will help many companies but not OXY which has already risen because of the higher oil prices and expectations of the stimulus as well as the opening up of the US market. Going back under $20 within a month is my expectation."
"I am very new on this board & haver never posted before. I am long OXY at much higher levels. Have read most reviews & find some very informative. According to news from Al Jazeera network,US have withdrawn some Patriot Anti Missile systems & some squadrons of Fighter Aircraft from Saudi Arabia very recently. This has sent a shock waves of Jitters in SA & 2 days back the Saudi King spoke to President Trump. Further SA got the message loud & clear & that was the reason that they agreed to a further cut of 1 million barrels per day effective 1st June 2020. Hence I am optimistic that soon Supply Demand balance will improve & Oil prices may recover. I am no expert, but it is my 2 cents on the whole issue. Hope all the longs will recover their losses & some even will make good money who were brave enough to buy near 10 to 12 levels. Cheers & good luck"
THIS IS DEAD CAT BOUNCE OCCIDENTAL CRASHED 30% FROM 32.5 TO 26 USD IN 4 DAYS IT WILL KEEP GOIG CRASH NEXT WEEKS
Buy oil stocks so your the only one not crying at the gas station come $100 plus crude. 2/23/2021
"Chris, $30 in 2 months max. Seriously"
Word is -Talos still interested in OXY’s Anadarko acquired GOM assets . If no deal OXY may offload more debt into a new entity that encompasses this asset group . Seven production hubs dozens of leases and several large production fields . Any thoughts on what this asset group is worth ?
I think that regardless of the fundamentals OXY will have a hard time getting its share price to where it should rightfully be until after it shows its Q2 results are decidedly better than what analysts predicted; it has raised a significant amount of money from the sale of unwanted assets; and the price of a barrel of oil stabilizes around the $42-$45 per barrel area. At that point I think you would finally see capitulation by the naysayers (Motley Fool and others) and energy stocks will experience a significant rebound with OXY rebounding more than the rest of the group. How long can the wait be? In my opinion one or two quarters.
"By the way I’m very happy to see Exxon get that big boost today from the activist. Oxy has got the carbon capture tech way ahead of anyone, if that’s what the funds need to buy for esg, then you can bet oxy is the star play"
"Here’s a thought - since so many of you are grasping at straws with hopes OXY can blast off . OXY could package up groups of the assets they want to sell into a couple or more NEWLY formed Corporations , pass over reasonable amounts of their debt to get it off OXY books - then take the new company(s) public to raise $$$ . Perhaps they could do this with African operations and then also with GOM assets creating new wholly owned operating co’s that could then go public giving all the proceeds to OXY for debt reduction. Makes as much or more sense than some of the other ideas I’ve seen here ."
"“ALL ABOARD THE OXY DOUBLE-UP EXPRESS”  OXY has yet to recover from anything, from a reporting/earnings perspective. Still a dog$&@t, dumpster  company. I’m proud to own it"
Is it possible some people want to bring down the share price so that they can start stealing the warrants being issued today?
"Once they cut the dividend, Vikki will have turned OXY into Chesapeake."
"Morgan Stanley analyst Devin McDermott upgraded Occidental Petroleum stock to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $59 price target, citing its lofty dividend yield of around 7% and growing free cash flow. This article is from Barron's Jan. 13th"

This is Alan giving out stock advice
"here is what well here during the cc: tons of fcf, the costs have improved amazingly, we are productive and are margins are growing, our hedges have done a great increasing our fcf, we have deleveraged a ton, .... but what you wont here about is increasing Capex. Why is that important? bc increasing production causes you to buy more hedges at today's prices."
Congrats. new support 26.30
I do believe we are witnessing a little squeeze...
FYI. the market is closed on Friday for the 4th of July... so tomorrow is the last day to accumulate shares for the Warrants...
"tried to be supportive, but Vicki recieved over 6% increase plus big bonus and stock for 2019 as the Darko deal still needed unravelling. BS"
"38.25 Now....... Who Would Have Thunk This.......Wasn't the ALL Time High Like $111 on This Thing ?Think (Without Peeking Back) The 52 Week Hi was in the 70's ?Shaking My Head.....You'd THINK The BOD Would come out with some positive comments......But, other than theEarnings Call, they have been SILENT..... Well Guys.......They Can't ALL Be Winners.........Sigh......"
Bought this at 38.35 as a contrarian play to AMD that I bought on Jan 4th for 18.85
WTI is coming up and this doesn’t move
Confident stimulus will pass next week. We should hit $23 by end of year. 2021 economy will be robust. Oil demand from China spiking. 24 US oil tankers heading to China. I say easy $40 summer 2021. Have a great weekend. And please watch Mehmet. I think he is a KGB agent
"NASDAQ will likely bleed tomorrow. Great rebalancing from tech to value (oil) is coming. Remember that OXY and oil sector are still below the pre-covid level. We are still undervalued and underperformed and ""ignored"" by the market. We deserve the reward and BUBBLE in our share price especially after considering the pain we went through last year.... When everything else was going up, our sector was going to the hell for the 6 months."
I have 25 years of experience in stock market.this downside is normal. market game .always things are opposite sides .All people expected oil price increase. will be increasing after the big guys boughtvyour SHARES @ cheaper price.
#1 Opec cuts production..#2 the Chinese virus comes to an end #3 China has to resume buying oil #4 the spring summer driving season begins #5 people realize oil is not going away and that oil stocks pay a rich dividend #6 shorts gets squeezed....jmho
"There is no way this company goes back to $.79 on the divvy. BUT, at $15, whats wrong with $.25? Or even $.35? I can see that in 2 years. That's ~10% return on divvy at todays price. An incredible retirement investment."

started my position today...couldn't resist the price...the whole sector is on liquidation sale looks like...i think 2-3 years from now things may be better....
"Even if OPEC increases production, oil is still going skyrocket. Especially with fears of inflation now, and the 10 year bond yield increasing. HOLD your OXY like a life preserver. This down turn is going to benefit oil and oil stocks."
I hope we have found the bottom ...
This company has enough cash to stay afloat. Those who are saying this will soon bankrupt need to go to school to understand simple maths.
So based on the charts here are our targets and milestones.1st milestone - $26.452nd milestone - $273rd milestones - $28.2
"Never, ever fall in love with a stock. Never."
The market worried about inflation but Lumber is up and oil is dumping. What the hell is wrong with that picture????/
BANKRUPT OXY Stock shares are destined to go down. Typical OXY stock after every spike the price pulls back. You have to sell and buy back. Holding OXY continously will make you loose money!
"Why would institutions start loading up on oxy when the company has zero dividend, have no idea how much damage Texas Freeze had on this company, volatile oil price due to covid, and no one is sure if the company bought additional hedging? Would you pour millions if not billions of dollars when there is so much uncertainty?If Oxy gives positive outlook on dividend, production, asset divesture, and no additional hedging, this stock will hit 15 to 30% before the end of June."
While most of us are loaded on oil options and stock the real world ids getting decimated today and not thinking about anything...the opec decision with have more effect than this little change...as stated with oil this high and the next couple of months looking good for crude oxy should see now highs as all the bubble money looks for a home
how many days wti price stayed over 60$
"1. India's positivity rate has almost halved to 13.3% compared to 24.9% on 9th of May. 2. EU will now allow non-EU vaccinated individuals to travel in and out freely. 3. $60 average oxy will generate about 1 billion dollar more cash flow on annual basis than the last quarter. I meant more. 4. Hopefully Oxy can take the unsolicited offer and complete the 2-3 billion divesture they aimed to achieve by the summer time. I think the deal was well underway otherwise they may not have given a specific time frame back in Feb. They say covid variant cases are rising in Asia, but I only see 8 countries that are actually up on weekly basis out of 48 countries. I am worried about Thailand, Argentina, South Africa, Portugal, but.. still I mean the world's cases are down 15% on weekly basis, so I think the good news offset the bad news. 5. Approximately 25 to 30 million vaccination per day in the world. That's another 1.5 billion dose until July 19th. That should be more than enough for North America, EU, and maybe some Asian / South American countries. 6. Based on Israel data. I think we see high level of herd immunity with 25% of adults fully vaccinated. The age population of 40 years and above. I think partly the reason is because under the age of 40, the mortality rate is just extremely low that nobody gets hospitalized or checked out. 7. Michael Burry, Ray Dalio, David Tepper, Carl Icahn, and even Warren Buffett (via preferred share of course) all have varying number of Oxy shares. Some have bought large quantity, some have bought small quantity. Some reduced their stakes, but still they are part of the company."
"""The production outlook ""does not inspire confidence in capital efficiency"" or in the ability to ""meet sustaining capital requirements next year,"" Mizuho Securities USA analyst Vincent Lovaglio said."" You do understand what that means, right? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-reduce-debt-boosting-153944163.html"
the probably of chev just taking the 1B and leaving is slim to none... they came to play... they have already been talking up how good this deal would be for them... predicting they could get a barrel out of the ground at $15... in a find that is Saudi sized. plus their stock currency is up at a point where its a good time to be used for a purchase. It would take nothing for chev to match oxy or top them by a few $ and walk with darko. chev already has the favorable blessings of darko. As for the notion that chev would attempt a double purchase of both oxy and darko in one swoop. (nice thought but don't see that happening) And if by chance oxy does for some reason get darko.. people here seem to think they will crater and fall into the ocean... so the stock price would go down (temporarily) doesn't mean it will stay down there forever. if I have an ounce of gold that is $1200 (fully paid for) and I borrow $1200 to buy another one... now I have leveraged myself.... doesn't mean I have still have only 1 piece of gold and a new debt... I have the debt.. but I have the 2 pieces of gold .... meaning.. yeah they will take on the debt..but they have all the new assets added to the pile.. imagine they kept the oxy name and just made darko a division under the parent company.. still ran as 2 companies.. under one name.. they are still both self sufficient without doing a thing. that would be considered ok.. Or if this wasnt hostile.. and the two came out and said they were planning a merger.. that would have been ok... so whats the big punishment for taking one over and cost cutting and instituting synergies..? everyone has lost sight of the simple process and the real underlying pros of the deal... as for the share price... just sit tight unless you are perched on margin.. which if you are.. and sitting with a loss.. then that has nothing to do with oxy in the first place.. its you who got yourself in the pickle. either pay off your margin... or cost average if you believe in the long term prospects of the stock. remember.. stocks go UP.. and DOWN... you knew that when you bought it.. but if you bought in the 70's and 80's and you don't need the money.. stick around.. you should be able to get back most or all of your money in the (long term) no matter who is the victor. one rule in stock that most people don't tell.. panic usually causes losses.. just remember.. oxy is already one of the largest players in the permian... it can remain the same size or get larger.. either way.. its a winner.. you just have to stick out the race.. whats your downside? any drop in price from here is not going to be forever. limited downside.. the upside is limitless (with time) as for this board... all we can do is guess at the future... (me included) good luck..
A nice size asset sale will send this to 30 with oil at these levels ...or higher...
"Tomorrow when they report, and announce how much they are making in the 1st quarter, and anticipated 2021, this will be on a fast path to test $46. $60-70 ppb long term and this is an $80 stock. They will also be able to illiminate their debt very fast."
Stock is down 30% and end of year selling is normal. We could see another 10 to 15 % sell off. Much more stable in 2020. Any higher move in oil and we could be back to $42 to $46/share.
$27 soon! 
"You can’t compare OXY to CVX or XOM when it comes to share price movement as Dave does folks, OXY is down a lot more still from pandemic crash and has more debt when you compare the numbers of rev and free cash flow etc, the past 5 weeks OXY has been a dog and nobody really can’t explain it except that we know Carl sold 15 million shares, all other US oil companies gave updated guidance except for OXY and we know many exposed to the texas freeze have big losses but OXY has not said a single word, when can only speculate and that speculation for many is not good based on the extreme silence from OXY which is why the daily trading volume has been extremely low and why there isn’t many buyers as they are waiting to hear earnings or something good. We know with WTI at the current levels that OXY is growing money on trees and we also know that the pandemic in India (3rd greatest oil importer) is getting worst, i’m bullish but also very skeptical at the silence"
Looking Months out OXY could be at 45+ Dollars. It was at ~45 Dollars before the Pandemic just trying to get back to where it was at with Oil prices at about the same price. My opinion.
I think I met her on a Thailand street corner in 72.
"Short data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU : XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"

Glad is back. Texas back to normal. Have to boil water for 2 weeks. No big deal. Most big houses predicted oil at $65 but now new prediction is $75 oil this year. Agree 100%. Ton of bullish news for oil. OXT at $45 by June.

The drop in gas and distillates was a combined 17.4m barrels. In order to refine the 17.4mb it would take about 22.6m barrels of crude so expect a nice crude draw down as soon as refineries are at full throttle.
OXY will touch 32 this coming week (earnings week). Mark my words.
"If WTI holds its gains for another 2-3 days, we will be seeing $28 again"

"I was checking why OXY is going down in price, then I noticed WTI went upto 65$. No wonder why OXY is down. If oil goes to 80, OXY might down another 20%.(Sarcastic)"
OCCIDENTAL OIL IS GOING TO DROP TO ZERO US DOLLARS IN ONE DAY. ONE DAY YOU WILL LOOK HERE AND THE STOCK VALUE WILL BE 0.01 US DOLLARS. SOON
Simple survey here. Knowing oil is $66 WTI and expected to go up to $75 and your average cost in the 26-28 range. Would you sell this right now? Now you got your answer why this will only go up
"Just returning the dividend to 5% would allow thousands of retirees to return again to Oxy......the company will be able to unload its various african operations because of the rise in oil.......All of a sudden, electric cars are showing problems with lithium production causing major disruption with environmental issues.....Huge problems exist in finding adequate lithium and its production will cause the battery to skyrocket in cost.....Oil is here to stay for the indefinite future as long as it can find a way to be carbon neutral.....Oxy management, certainly the worst in the oil sector, should restore the dividend to simply show the company has strength again......Why would anyone buy Oxy if they can buy chevron which will go up by the same percentage and give a great dividend along the way.....Dividends count and when the market goes down in the near future, dividend stocks will outperform......The hedge funds and major retirement funds own large amounts of dividend stocks , simply to make sure their future numbers will be more secure.....Oxy is making money again and its massive debt can be shifted , sold off and have new accountants find ways to restore the dividend.....the penny dividend is an embarrassment....."
"IMO Vicki and the BOD will do anything and everything possible with OXY prior to the next shareholder vote. The cut in Capital Spending over the next year may have been a bit extreme. More and possible dumping of assets at prices below market value may also result...but don't think a cut in dividends will come, as this would be a sure way path to the exit door for Vicki. Problem is this myopic policy might be good in the short term, but will hurt OXY's profitability in the long term. (Not a prognosticator, just see how Vicki's decision making is mostly self-seeking)."
It will be interesting to see what the report next week shows. With 11 new rigs added and most of them in the permian this will be the real test for what direction oil is headed.
"For all you OXY shareholders hyping the 8% yield, remember this: the yield has gone up because the price has declined, not because the earnings have gone up. OXY will not go bankrupt, but they will be treading water until they pay off the exorbitant preferred stock interest payments to Berkshire Hathaway. Some times the best deals you make are the deals you don't make."
"EIA reports 4.5M draw, but the gem in the report is the increased gasoline production. Refiners aren't in the habit of losing money on increased production if the demand isn't there. extremely bullish report IMO"
The COVID case in India today is 290k. Are they drinking COVID juice? What the hell is going on? Where is Mehmet today? Did he get COVID as well? This must be his karma spreading fallacies.
Oil appears to have averaged about 16-20 per barrel more in the 1st quarter over the 4th quarter and by the time they report they could be showing the second quarter starting with oil up about 22 per barrel over the 4th q...they already stated that pumping volumes would stay flat all year to keep cap ex at the sweet spot...100 million barrels per quarter with lets average an increase of 18$ per barrel 1.8 billion more in free cash flow ..but lets throw in more capex of about 300 million still a massive increase in free cash flow.any impact from the storms are in the past wallstreet is about the future
"Considering how airlines and hotels have bounced 50-100% off lows and they are still losing billi....OXY and some others( cash flow postive) now can go back to where they should be ..about 50-75% higher ...their carbon capture plant will make as much ""noise"" as electric cars in the coming year...after proclaiming 3 times that fracking is here to stay..(they probably did not realize that of the nat gas is coming from there..10-20 billion dollars worth already) this should go back to mid teens or higher...when oil hits fifty in the next several months mid 20s"
"Hey Vicky, how's that deal with Anadarko working out. You were a what $50B company before you paid $38B for APC, which should be a $88B company, yet your market cap is $31B combined today, and you still have a job?? Humm....sounds like Bernie's healthcare math, very fuzzy and doesn't work. Good luck keeping your job!!!!"
I wouldn't worry none about the share prices as long as crude prices hold. The share price will follow eventually. You can't hurry a good sauce. Just gotta wait.
"Gas is now within 5 year moving avg. The crude is also heading to the direction. My rough estimation is that the crude will be within the range as well by November this year. The oil will be $50, and OXY will move accordingly. Also in November, a positive Q3 result will work in favour with the oil price. I hope Trump wins so that the whole universe is with OXY. https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/gasoline.php"

I heard 3rd lockdown in Italy. Is this the primary reason why the oil is down today?
03/11/21 at 2:37 pm WTI at $66 per barrel. Bingo!
look at their international assets...look at the UAE
The rotation is finally happening I am literally crying right now. Cant control it. God bless
it appears that a an MOU was signed ..India only has 9.5 days of oil reserves.(38 million barrels)...under the deal they would store oil in our strategic reserves and they have been advised to store 10xs that amount or about 380 million barrels...a this point even if they took 40-80 million barrels this would instantly boost wt with all the cuts in place
We may see $24 soon because many countries now are welcoming international flights and adding their domestic flights because they have to keep the economy going. Check ALK UAL SAVE LUV DAL AAL also Cruise Lines like RCL NCLH must use a lot of oil/gas.
Great move today. I think this will be a top stock in 2020
OXY really needs to get a tremendous price on Western Midstream ( pipeline ) in order to meet their asset sale projections . I’m not sure they can get it sold for anywhere close to what they need to .
Saudi Arabia and Yemen are going Toe to Toe over the weekend isn't really helping stability in the oil market..
"Giant Cashflow …..wow.It tops all what was expected ever before.This stock is a no brainer, oil will stay at these levels maybe it will rise to 70 usd or more as some predictions say. World is at the beginning of opening, also here in Europe and this will push the demand for oil MASSIVLY."
"No pun intended, but hit the gas!!!!"
When the hell is this going to hold some gains?????
lol OXY dropped 2% on that jobs report release
Low volume which means gains will tumble easily
"Inflation appears to be coming. The fed says don’t worry, but I see prices increasing in the real world. Oil stocks seem to be a good hedge against inflation."
"Disappointing performance today, despite high oil price, it is going down. This should have gone high this week. Soon OPEC will meet for April and it is highly likely that OPEC will bring more production."
Our friends investors at Reddit are now attacking American Airlines. Just a matter of time before they attack a heavily shorted oil stock. OXY should do well today. Undervalued. Yesterday the Fed comments on vaccine rollout tanked the market. Every time the fed sneezes the market catches a cold. Hols. Once Reddit investors attack an oil stock shorts will panic and cover. Patience
"$OXY $XOMMr Clean the moron is hiding on those two boards today, after hiding from his BS posts on ET"
Down 25% off the March 5th high. A rebound is on the way.
"you know what sux? whether this stock goes up above 26 today, or drops into the 23s, is anyone's guess.."
four of the largest trading houses own about 40% so you can bet that they are all over this to maximize their return of investment...either in parts or eps ....rest easy they are not going to lose billions...months not years
I AWAIT 20 USD SHARE PRICE BY TUESDAY. SHORT CRASH COMING WITH EARNINGS
Now we know Buffett also dumped OXY.
It seems there’s no issue with the moratorium on current leases just new leases. Which is good
We got momentum now. With the wsj article every fund manager is watching
I bought $OXY
"Quite an interesting EIA report today:Gasoline usage up 37.4% YoYDistillates usage up by 8.6% YoYJet fuel usage up by 24.8% YoYEven though the baseline is last year's covid period, oil production is also down YoY (not from this report though). Driving season hasn't started yet and reopening is still not fully materialized yet. There is no guessing which direction is oil price heading this summer."
"Chicago going on a 30 day stay at home , new recession about to start and Biden Virus Guru wants a 4-6 week national shutdown . Watch NY follow and do the same . The vaccine is a great start but no one knows how long it will last yet forever , a year , 6 months that is just another question the medical industry will have to find out. I am about ready to sell the stock (keep the warrants ) take the write-off this year and then relook at OXY after the New Year ,not an easy choice . Right now way too many questions and not enough answers , what will Biden new rules look like , OPEC+ (keep cuts , add to cuts or increase production and what about Iran if Biden wants back into an agreement with them ) , the virus ( how fast it spreads this winter), the vaccine ( how fast they can make enough for the world how long it lasts and how many take it ) , oil demand ( up ,down or stays about the same ) and oil supply / oil price. Usually it only a question on supply and demand you really have to worry about and guess at . Leaving out OXY's upper management and debt load."
"close the market and let the short relax for few hours , they must be sweating a lot again today"
CHK - the real definition of a short squeeze .
the shorts losing  today 
Analysts downgrades are foolish and miss the point that we are now in the transitional period to explosive growth for OXY. Yesterday's drop was accelerated by a bad market and migration out of energy as you saw across the board. Look forward my friends - we go much higher in 2021. Boolean
"at 65 oil, this will be 40 soon"
Oil itself looks to be heading for a short squeeze . I expect we are going to see another big up day tomorrow . OXY and other oils will follow as long as the general market isn’t tanking . Enjoy while it lasts .
"Whats the cost to pass on the deal? The $1B to Chevron plus $50m to Berkshire??? If so, could be the best money lost??"
"Crude could reverse by end of session, that would be huge...."
almost $65 WTI
"I can see this touching some low's again but like with most gas/energy stocks, if you're holding long term you should be fine."
"None of this is a surprise. This is all about the virus. The virus is about on schedule they predicted the peak end of April, and it's mid April and we're around the peak, give or take. There hasn't been any revelations to this point. It'll all depend on whether things can get up in a running in some form in the next month or so."
"The US uses about 20 million barrels and or equivalents per day when things are normal...so yes the US has to at least replace wells that are dry ...most of the other major oil countries produce far far more than they use in their own countries ...we do ship alot of lng via cqp and yes we do import a different grade of oil that are refineries need but net net we are not flooding the market actually close to even....supply and demand and greed has been the driver of crude prices since the beginning of opec...not just now....the math is the math ..100 million barrels at 60 or 94 million at 40 ...nobody wins at the lower price...if one country tries to make a run every other country will voice their intention to do the same....opec has been here since 1960 and now every country has too much expense built into oil...you can now easily look at balance sheets for the whole Saudi oil bus...the largest russian cos...etc etc....no one is really making money at lower prices...between operating profits and the loss of stock value everyone loses...luckily for oxy even at 50 with reasonable capex and possibly a nominal dividend in the future they can make money ,,once again the smaller players may have a tougher environment"
OXY just revised their bid for anadarko to lower the amount of shares and add more cash. They did this because now it won't have to go to a vote by the shareholders. This is a sneaky deceitful move. They don't think shareholders should have a say in any of this. The CEO and board are running our company and locking us out of a say. At this point you have a choice to make. Either allow them to run OUR company in this fashion or vote them out. These CEO's and boards are all getting a bit out of control everywhere. Now a days they issue two classes of shares on IPO's so they keep voting control without having majority ownership and do whatever they want. Are we all forgetting that it's the shareholders companies and NOT these overpaid people who work for us? This deal may be good long term but this really doesn't sit well with me and it should not with anyone who owns this company. Why would they out of no where up their bid? It's our money you #$%$.
Would anyone want to share their exit plan for Oxy Warrants? Is there a recommended formula to calculate value based on share value and proximity to expiration? Any advice would be appreciated. Already up 120% on my warrants and bought long ago based on the advice of this board.
"Exactly what I am saying, now Fitch rating are also saying it"" To the degree the company overcomes its financing issues, Fitch believes the Anadarko acquisition will ultimately strengthen OXY's business and operational profile over the longer term, assuming a recovery in oil prices. OXY's post-acquisition size has more than doubled to just under 1.4 million boepd and, on a pro forma basis, par with ConocoPhillips (A/Stable). Oxy is the largest producer in the Permian and DJ basins, and a top producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The ability to deploy OXY's technological, subsurface and operational expertise to Anadarko's holdings (particularly in the Permian) is expected to create significant value in a more normalized oil price environment by lowering unit costs.""https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-oxy-senior-unsecured-bonds-bb-12-08-2020"""
"I have been holding a position since April, sold at 22 and bought back in. Current average 18 and I am not even sweating. This said, I watch these boards more for entertainment than anything, and I have to say it has been worth the price of admission. Anyone that buys or sells simply based off the sentiment of a bunch of strangers, when only 10 percent of humanity accounts for 100 percent of our species progress is complete and utter insanity. If you cannot read a balance sheet, income statement, if you have never actually owned a business, and you do not actually care enough to do some research you should probably bounce.P.S.

"Citibank sees Brent at $60 by end of 2021 and average of $58 for 2021. They also see WTI at $58 by end of 2021. All oversupply would have been drawn by then. Goldman expects Brent to be at $65 by third quarter of 2021.It seems that most investors are bullish on oil starting next year, but not quite hopeful until then. I expect oil prices to behave like an abandoned ship in the middle of the choppy ocean until vaccine is widely available. Another phrase comes to mind is ""Its the darkest before the dawn"". Good news is that OXY has no major debt due until 2H2021. Hopefully, all oil projections will start to come true by then dark clouds would lift."

Live look at blue enjoying his new hair after his 3 week run sitting here all day mumbling on light volume after a big stakeholder selloff
Crude keeps going up and the OXY ATM keeps filling up
Buffett would not offer to invest $20 bil if he did not think OXY could pay it back. If this deal goes through OXY will get a lot of Oil out of the Anardako Permian acres.
Going back up this week
02/28/21 at 18:27 Eastern Seaboard Time WTI trading at $62.28 (+78) per barrel. If this holds until the stock market opens in New York we should see a pleasant opening.
Q and A finally
"If you like cheapie oil plays take a look at Obsidian Energy in Western Canada, at one time this was the largest producer in Western Canada, stock has been beaten like a rented mule for about the last 7 years but they are sitting on a large reserve of oil in the Cardium, at current price of oil may do $500 million plus in revenue and are trying to acquire their Cardium neighbor Bonterra. Speculative but cheap, trading at a huge discount to assets and cash flow. Around $1.80 OTC bulletin board OBELF and also trades in Toronto. Do your homework but this may be one of the cheapest oil companies on the planet."
When the hell is there going to be some good news on this stock?????????????? ?

rough day 4 now....remember DAY not YEAR...we go much higher so....BE THERE. Boolean
Juat bought more after last pull back
nothing happening with Oxy unless oil goes into upper 60s......
Look at all the red today! OXY still holding up nice. How long will the market bleed? Guessing it’ll be bad until cyclicals start posting a massive return to positive earnings.
Oxy was trading in the 40s with 55-58 oil WITH DOUBLE THE CAPEX AND A DIVIDEND..IN 2019....cap ex was about 2.4 billion dollars more and the dividend was about 2 billion....4.4 billion dollars more in expense on 440 million barrels per year.....so about 10$ more per barrel in expense...relax the biggest players around the world and here need and will have oil 55-60.....everything is opening
"STOCK BROKER TROLLS HOW IS BUSINESS GOING, DID YOU CATCH ANY BIG BUYERS TODAY? OIL MOIL .DID YOU EVER POST WHY OCCIDENTAL HAS 41.5 BILLION US DOLLARS DEBT AND ABOUT TO ANNOUNCE BANKRUPTCY. WE ARE ALL WAITING CARL TO COMPLETE HIS STOCK SALES TO ANNOUNCE BANKRUPTCY"
"If oil drops below $50, OXY will be in a crisis. Seems like a slim possibility but it is possible."
"This just in. WB bought 26,500 shares right after Mike sold out."
Oxy has one issue was merger a good idea  or not? Why I am a believer. I don’t believe oil is going down with Andarko we have a lot more. Management has the number on value of synergy. You know Oxy does efficient recovery of oil and improves assets. People lose their jobs been through this merger deal. They run more with less assets. Vicki has the number and wouldn’t risk her neck on the line if they weren’t compelling. Women can manage without emotion. She could be wrong but I am confident we make money and believe 80 PPS in two years. My opinion! Dutch

Anyone still holding their warrants? Any advice on what to do with them now that they're in the money? I assume much like options the premium will decay over time?
Tomorrow should be interesting. The 200 day moving average is $16. We have not been above the 200 day since Feb. We could really fly if we get above that level on volume.

So what's the reason for this great stocks Duump!�?#$%$
Bought some at 29.1 for a quick swing to 30+....
Omg its gonna go....
I am watching the stock everyday. I will be taking a large long term position in OXY as soon as I see the stock move up. I believe the stock will be above $30 by next year this time. Just trying to get in at the best price.
My 32 strike covered calls are saved....
"I've seen this chart develop so many times in so many different stocks that it makes me sick. But, not really. I've learned, you take your profits and let the proceeds turn into dry powder waiting for the shake out from all the profit takers. Then its back for more!"
""" The Saudi decision to extend the 1 mbpd cut indefinitely can be taken as a declaration of intent -- indeed, a thinly veiled declaration of war on the Biden administration -- by the Kingdom, and by extension, the rest of the OPEC+ cartel. They are going to keep pushing prices up relentlessly. Pencil in a $10/barrel rise per month. At that pace, oil prices could reach $100/barrel during the course of the summer. That's the message the Saudis and Russians want to send to the Biden administration: ""Look who has the leverage now."""
"Market up big, oil slightly up and yet yesterday the oil patch was down. Does not compute!Should reverse today as oil continues to move up."
"Most of the oil stocks have their 52-week highs from around Feb end of last year, before getting crushed in early March. In about 3-4 weeks, we may start seeing new 52-week highs for lot of oils stocks. It will be refreshing and even a bit funny to see headlines of new 52 week high from ""multi-year-low"" that we have gotten used to during pandemic time. It will help the sentiment at the very least."
"OXY is at idle, which is good for us. Buy all you can now before is jumps to $45-$50 this summer. Because of the lower demand for oil and the slower economy in general, a lot of companies, including OXY cut their dividend or stopped paying their dividend completely. It is to the discretion of the company to reinstate it. Why should OXY start paying? OXY can afford to pay a portion of the dividend, $0.10 or $0.15. But I say no, don't pay it. Keep the dividend in OXY's pocket and pay down their debt. OXY is $38.5 billion in debt. The good news is OXY is saving $3 billion a year by not paying the dividend.( 933 million outstanding shares times $3.16 a share per year). I think the company is holding off on the dividend and putting the money toward its debt. This will only make OXY even stronger. The dividend will resume next year or slowly transition up in $0.10 increments. So my advice to you is buy now at $26. When the $0.79 dividend per share per quarter resumes it is going to be a 12% annual return on investment every year... PLUS the principle gain of a double to $52 a share or even a triple in principle gain to $78 a share. Buy now."
Goldman Sachs just said oil at $65 next year.
"Here's the $0.79 question, buy now for the divy, or expect a price drop in excess of the divy from tax loss selling ?"
Someone is selling for sure. Have no fear though; oil is at highest it’s been within the last two years.
any chances of making this GREEN in here...???
"WTI about to move back above $14.....oil stocks are due for major short squeeze upward. Now news many states might start to reopen. Sure could debate if good idea or not, but its gonna happen really soon, and that will start putting some minor demand on oil again....OXY to $20-$25 by early may, if not sooner"
"CEO of oxy to meet with other ceos with trump Friday.. don’t forget that Icahn and trump are very good friends..,"
will see 20$ and then bounce back..
Hope this momentum continues and Carl has sold most of his 1/3 position for his sales goal.
"U.S. Bureau of Land Management held an auction of oil and gas leases last week on more than 7,000 acres in New Mexico – raising more than $3 million in bids on 11 parcels of land. Reuters said the auction Oct. 29 attracted less interest than New Mexico previous sales before the industry was hit with lower demand and prices because of the global pandemic. The leases include land in Permian Basin.Per-acre prices varied widely from $15 to $11,353. The sale’s average price was $403 per acre – higher than an auction in New Mexico in August but well below the $4,565 per-acre that federal lease sales in the state had averaged during the Trump administration. : I would say the idea of a Biden administration had something to do with the drop in price. OXY has a lot of leases on BLM land in NM."
I’m just here for the @W show.
taking forever this time
Free cash flow brought their cash on hand almost to 2 billion ... before 2 billion in sales added .. credit line wide open .. so in theory almost 10 billion in liquidity ... nat gas has risen much much higher about 25% of their business . If oil prices hold and gas holds that would be another 1.5- 2 billion in cash
"wow! 2 weeks vacation at disney, account goes up 1 M+ cool. We are back!Hope OPEC keeps the cuts for 3 more months."
There is a serious run coming. How about a serious purchase of shares then exercise those warrants. Then follow up with an offer on the company. I like buyouts......especially when my entry is clear down here.

The stock is manipulated by shortseller, but I hope they have to give up.Oxy is a Cashflow machine and they will oaypabck their debts in ahold manner.Maybe a sale of some African assets will accelerate this.Once oil goes over 70 usd we would have pre pandemic levels and the stock was at 65 usd.The minimum stock price in a cupule of weeks should be 50 USD."

"Oh stop lol crude is a hair under 66 a barrel, as soon as they stop propping up growth tomorrow this is going to 27 by friday."
Looks like this one will finally be breaking out Monday powering towards earnings!
OXY should recover. Oil barely down. EIA said oil supply will increase by 200K barrels second half of year? Makes 0 sense. Most economists predict a strong economy second half of year. And OPEC not increasing supply in March and SA will keep cutting 1 million barrels. I would not be surprised to see oil at $75 in summer. Hold strong
Here is the OXY hedge in detail:https://www.reuters.com/article/us-anadarko-m-a-occidental-hedge-insight/the-real-price-of-occidentals-costless-oil-hedge-idUSKBN1ZC0FN
"I've postulated before and I'll do so again, oil could trade around 30 for a decade and this wouldn't be historically abnormal. I come to this number because in the 80's and 90's it was glued to 18 bucks making 18 some kind of floor that producers just can't pump below without shutting down operations. Adjust 18 for inflation and you arrive at around 30 today. Having said that, I'm fully aware that there is a slim chance OPEC and shale drillers arrive at a Mexican standoff and both continue to hold back production. This is unlikely as history has shown a propensity to cheat. The best case for oil is severe backwardation in the futures market. If front month is trading much higher than back months, nobody will drill wells but those with production will keep making money selling at market. Right now oil futures are in strong forwardation indication to many bulls are assuming things will go higher in the future. This gives the ability to drill some wells and get financing by selling those distant futures and locking in a profit. So my advice to those dying to go long oil stocks, watch for backwardation."
Ridicolous valuation for oxy.... 16 usd at a oilprice at 42 usd +10 usd hedge = 52 USD.Hey guys....this Isthmen Most undervalued oil stock..a bargain at this level. That’s my personal opinion.I add shares ....oxy Share price normally would be at 35-45 usd. A big Manipulation to get this pearl to a bargain price like Schering did with noble. Oxy with best assets in Amerika and Africa among all oil companies Is 65 usd worth in normal oil price environment 60 USD. Consider...with its +10 usd hedge we are only 15% under this level.....oxy should be at about 45@-50 usd. This is fraud to prepare a bargain takeover....but not with me.
"Said it yesterday I expect a pause today. API numbers released yesterday no so great. Hope EIA numbers are better. Should recover in afternoon. What matters is DOW hit 30,000 and a vaccine is available in December. 2021 economy will fire on all cylinders. OXY heading to $25. And I am being conservative. Happy thanksgiving"
Here is my guess why they did not sell overseas assets . 200k barrels per day are on leased land and more than likely they already shut in some of those in case political foolishness mandates no drilling on fed land . So if so they have major areas to expand in those areas for growth in the future . Either way if fed land is adjusted they still willBe in the top five and barrelPrices will climb 5-7 per barrel or more immediately. Oxy will still be a major co however the tons of small cos would be crushed by their own govt action
"under performing the XLE...that means the next time the XLE goes down ( like this week) OXY will drop down to it's support at...... your guessed it, $24 and change."

"Today's volume of 31M shares is well below the 10-day average volume of 45M. Does not seems like there were many sellers, more like lack of buyers because of negative headlines on Covid-19 and IMF projections."

"We are very pleased to announce the signing of an agreement, awarding the exploration rights for #AbuDhabi Onshore Block 5 to Occidental . This is the first block to be awarded in Abu Dhabi’s second competitive block bid round. Occidental will hold a 100% stake in the exploration phase, investing up to AED514 million ($140 million) to explore for oil and gas in the block southeast of Abu Dhabi city. The block offers the potential to create significant in-country value for the #UAE over the lifetime of the concession."
"Morning star retreated their outlook 27 Feb..Based on this methodology, our fair value estimate is $47 per share.

That drives 2019 EBITDA to $10.5 billion, and we expect cash flow per share to reach $9.22 in the same period. Our 2020 estimates for production, EBITDA, and cash flow per share are 1,321 mboe/d, $16.1 billion, and $18.64, respectively."
"Volume today is still on the low side, especially considering price action. It is quite likely that shorts haven't started covering just yet. Vaccine news is a game changer (even though this news was expected) for travel and eventually oil stock recovery. I expect short covering to pick up pace as vaccines move through approval, production, and mass-vaccination steps not just here in USA, but throughout the world. As a serious OXY investor, I hope to enjoy the ride from here on."
"I live here on the west coast and talked with a neighbor who works in the RV business. He said sales records are being broken for buying travel trailers and the like. I asked whats that all about? It was his opinion that people are refinancing their homes at incredibly low interest rates and using ghe funds to spend time during layoffs among the C19 pandemic. Made sense to me as people are furloughed AND getting federal unemployment as well. Getting paid more to sit at home than to go to work. This brings me to my next point/example; another friend of mine works at COST. He said corporate is allowing workers to be furloughed if they feel threatened by C19. He does as he's mid 50's with underlying health issues. The state gave him unemployment and the Feds gave him unemployment. The result? He makes ~50% more in benefits than working. Why am I bringing up these 2 examples? There is an underlying story to the economic impact we are experiencing and about to experience. The first is that a lot of 1 time purchasing has been taking place with extremely low interest rates..2008/9 anyone? The 2nd is that once these furloughed people come back to work, or not, the rubber is going to meet the road. Either well paying jobs get eliminated due to efficiency, or the workers that replaced the furloughed people will get displaced. Either way, a reality is coming and soon. Im still left wondering, what is the value of the dollar going to be in the coming months/years? Just seems like a ton of pressure keeps building. In turn, OIL is going to reciprocate that pressure. In summation, inflation is coming. Maybe not throw money out ghe window kind of inflation, but gasoline isnt going to stay this low. Neither is milk, eggs and a loaf of bread."
"Okay boys we need another 3% push up, to recover from a 9% down day yesterday. I know you can do it before the market closes. Shorts have to cover before the next trading day."
Oil up. This keeps dumping#$%$$
OIL is the king and would rule the world for time to come
Regardless of opinions on OXY. For economics sake it is quite a reassuring sign that oil has held at $42 and has progressively legged up each week.
One thing is very certain so long as oil demand comes back and price remains above wti 50.. You wont be losing any money at this price.
Buy programs should kick in. We just broke back above $66.00/barrel!
32 today ?
"If your thinking things don't add up today, you are not alone. OXY is down when the market is up more than 200 points and oil is up $1.21 and over $65 a barrel. The rest of the sector is up more than 1.5 %. So is the stock being sold by a big player who is portfolio balance or do we have good old fashion stock manipulation holding the stock near the $26 price tag to accommodate the options crowd. We will see tomorrow no doubt."
"Added more shares today. East buy, oversold on a bad market day. Easiest money Ill ever make."
Looks like puts 4 to 1 over calls. This explains some of the downside with Oxy.
"Well my price target just reached for the Jan 2021 calls and Wti didnt break 57 (62 and change today) in 6 months, good luck everyone. Glad to anyone who got a chance to buy 30% + plus off the top a mere month and change ago."
Maybe this does go up tomorrow. But should it? 14m unit prod drop hardly seems like enough. World usage is down more than 50%
"After holding OXY shares for 2 years, I will sell OXY this Monday will start a fresh new year. I lost 75% of my savings but it seems from OXY Internet Stock Marketers, OXY will not increase 2-3 years more. I dont want to loose opportunity on high tech stocks"

That announcement hardly moved their needle! I don't think OXY is going to be dramatically affected either, and most certainly not by $8-$10/share as others speculate..."
Yahoo posting more oil storage articles udr OXY symbol. I looked at fifteen diff oil ticker Symbols and only OXY has all these storage volatility headlines constantly. WHY?
"Nice yahoo article bringing a perspective of oil trajectory in the short term. Its todays article. Basically, in a nut shell, Oil breaks $66.92 but closes below $65.92 then this might trigger a short term sell off. If it can't hold for the week then it might continue its sell off short term.But make no mistake, a short term sell off is Not a long term downward trajectory. Its simply an opportunity to acquire discounted shares."
https://www.oxy.com/investors/Documents/05.29.19%20Bernstein%20Podium%20Presentation%20-%20Transcript.pdfHave to look at the slide display and it is more understandable the importance of the location and synergies available with a highly priced asset in the Permian. Any luck with oil staying in high $50 range the next 2 years and this willbe a very good purchase and the $5 billion over pay will be nullified... A 100+ sq mile continuous operation area willhelp with pipeline transport and provide chemical production be of very affordable competitive advantages.The are charts show the importance the best...
I’ll be surprised if we don’t finish over $27 today. OXY is an absolute cash cow with current prices and it looks like oil will continue to climb.
"CI lost money on some of his stock by selling now he wants to try to gain control and selloff the combined company . If he tries to sell before another year or two , to give the combined companies a chance to show the earning it can make , a lot more people will lose money on the stock. No one will pay a PREMIUM for any oil business at this time and I know there are a lot of people here with stock bought above 60.00 per share."
"Is there anyone that can explain why OXY earnings well to explain to me why analysts concensus estimates for 2022 is trending worse the past 6 months? I am not interested in personal opinion per se, but what are the analysts themselves stating in their analysis that things looking worse now than they did just 60 days ago."
Celebration of the first solid Green Day since months
"go OIL! go OIL!... Wanma see crude hit 67-68, this stock will pop baby"
Vicky H is certainly not ever going to win an Oil Services CEO of the Year Award - but - OXY will rebound in like fashion that it floundered albeit somewhat slower on the way back up because of increasing production numbers & pricing which increases FCF and eventually profits and finally a nice dividend once again - all of which OXY had mind you - before Vicky and her board blew it all up .
$100 oil next year. Short if you like losing money. Goldman Sachs predicts demand exceeding supply very shortly https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Goldman-Sachs-Oil-Demand-Could-Exceed-Supply-By-End-May.html
During the last quarterly report OXY was basing their numbers off $43/barrel. They stated moving forward for FY21 each $1 increase in oil would add $215m free cash flow. WTI average Q1 is $52.00. Based on their numbers that's a FCF increase of $1.9bil. They had a FCF around $753mil in Q4. So a $2.5bil FCF isn't out of the question if their numbers were correct.
"If our wonderful CEO has her bonus restored, why not start in on the dividend which once gave older people security.......Under Hollub, the stock went from 80 to 9, which along the way ,she destroyed the dividend.......so,what do the common shareholders receive in lieu of their dividend....a return of share price to the 60's ???? it would have been close to that had she not been given the right to buy anadarko......luckily i purchased enough at 10 to make up my lost money in the period Hollub has been around.....too bad she wasn't dumped by the forces of Icahn.......Restoration of the dividend will surely improve the value of the stock because many older people need the security of a dividend....Hollub is around 70 from the way she appears and its time for her to step down"
Sorry I meant to say - WHERE IS THE LEGENDARY TRADER MEHMET SAKIR?
"API, US crude supply up by 1.9 million barrels. Not bad. Let us wait and see what EIA delivers"
"API, US crude inventory down by 1 million barrels. An increase of 2.75 million was expected. Gasoline down by 926,000 barrels. Hope the Fed tomorrow does not rattle the market"
good earnings
"Imagery, it is tripled minimum. Before corona the stock was at 55 usd and more.45 usd is the minimum. I will add shares still today. Oil can soar to over 60 usd due to increasing demand in 2 months and blow out of oil exploration budgets."
"OXY will skyrocket even further once the oil demand is back. We are at the transition point where the production is historically low while the demand is about to come back. Watch out for the headline such as ""because of the BK of oil producers in 2020, oil supply is shrinking. We don't have enough oil"" This will increase both the oil price as well as the OXY's share price. We just have to ride this wave~~~~~"
Reallocation trades should happen tmr
"Realized prices for the 2nd Qtr, $23.17 for oil and $1.10 for nat gas. Current prices for the 3rd Qtr, $ 42.50 for oil and $2.20 for nat gas. let that sink in and then make your investment decision in OXY."
"Traders and shorts got burnt today. Day trading is over, our darling is a runner now!"
Holding my positions and adding some more today. Thanks for the opportunity covid.
Just HOLD
all oil companies are shooting up as there is not enough supply for the upcoming demand :)))
2 billion cash on hand ...this quarter crude is higher so free cash flow would be about 2.2 billion but they said capex would be higher so possibly 800 million so free cash could be 1.4 billion...combine that with meager asset sales of about 2 billion you can easily see debt down 10 billion easily in 12 months...YOU DONT SELL ASSETS UNLESS THE PRICE IS GREAT WITH OIL OVERSEAS CLOSE TO 70
"Oxy is 50 USD minimum worth, if oil price recover to 60 USD it is 65 usd worth minimum.I see warren Buffet and Carl Icahn as the big investors in that value stock and both beleive at an oil recovery. So I am sure they will invest into oxy much more and then we will see 50 USD within short time.Für me a very Good Play besides of devon and pdce and HPR, alle hedged at best levels."
"Earnings today after bell. 2 things that will make OXY soar:1. No hedges on production. Unlike PXD which produced oil with hedges at $55, OXY Has no hedges, should avg at $652. No differentials to transportation. OXY has mid stream assets in PERMIAN, saving $6/barrel"
"Loaded up on large number of warrants. Too tempting an opportunity to pass up on under $3. The lowest stock price was $37 before Covid. With 7 years of expiry, and the fact the oil usage is within 10% of pre-covid level, and oil prices slowly inching up, at some point, OXY may get to the lowest price it had before Covid, which is $37. At that point, just the intrinsic value of the warrant will be $37-22 = $15, five times current value. It will be a huge coupe when it happens. The only argument I had against huge investment in OXY warrant was the risk of bankruptcy. Based on current oil prices, no near-term debt due, and likelihood of positive cash flow in Q3, I don't think bankruptcy is even on horizon for a couple of year if oil doesn't go negative again. I have long investment horizon of several years and can easily wait it out for few years. If OXY goes above $40 within next 5-6 years, OXY warrants will fund most of my retirement. Current day-to-day changes and chatter here serves mostly as entertainment to me."
"Finally!! OXY has stopped its maddening gap up and downs. Mr. Market has settled down and is giving some support. A move back to the $31's before earnings looks about right. Now, get OIL to remain stable at $60+ and then start to rise after earnings, and we have a nice return of SP towards the #40-$50 range by summers end. I just love these Warrants. I need some powder to clear my account so I can buy more."
Someone mentioned insider purchases here . Yes . There have indeed been some . Unfortunately though for those insiders they are underwater now too - some like VH - substantially under water .
I BOUGHT OCCIDENTAL OIL AT 75 US DOLLARS AND SOLD IT AT 31 US DOLLAR AFTER 3 YEARS. THERE IS NO ONE WHO PROFITS FROM INVESTING OCCIDENTAL OIL. ONLY STOCK BROKER EMPLOYEE TROLLS PROFITS FROM IT
Oxy is showing renewed interest with investors outperforming CHV XOM yesterday and up 2.5% in pre market.
Vicki said it not my fault its the government live with it
Offers in hand that are above $2billion target!
Oxy is really holding up well compared to BP... But it doesn't look like the opec meeting is going the way we energy speculators wants it to.... :(
"Oil should pivot this week with earnings starting 4/21 for oil. If we hold gains with another draw down on Wednesday inventory report we should see a new leg up. All good things..,"
Oil prices were never stable..so posting than now makes no sense...however now they are more predictable...most if not all oil cos have given up on relentless drilling to focus ion debt and shareholder return.. this ahs brought down US production by about 3 million barrels...the Saudi oil business is now public so you can see at low 40s that they made meager amounts..same for the Russian companies ...they all want and need higher oil prices...end result ALL PLAYER WANT OIL AT COMFORTABLE LEVELS ...no one has a big edge so increasing volumes do not benefit anyone
as a reminder on may 2 he announced he sold all its airline stock ual was 25 it is now 36...no effect
The oil shortage is just around the corner. Expect old high off $140 a barrel to be broken just like almost every other commodity.
"shaking out the sellers market wide... totally fine, totally healthy"
this is called lunchtime. Lmao
Remember the stock was $40 the end of February 2020. Lots more room to run.
OXY is holding strong guys. Almost everything is RED while are still in GREEN.
OCCIDENTAL SHELL BP TOTAL CHEVRON EXXON APACHE MARATHONE ARE STOCK BROKER PRICE CAPPED STOCKS SINCE THE COVID STARTED. INVESTORS BUY FOR PRICE RECOVERY BUT THE PRICES ARE CAPPED BY INVESTMENT BANKS. THE PRICE CANNOT INCREASED ABOVE CERTAIN LEVELS
Best performing oil stock today i think.
With the gas drawdown can you imagine how much crude oil would rise when the pipeline flows again
Watch the last hour of trading today.
Oil price website said the sell off was 1. Stronger USA dollar 2. European vaccine issues with AstraZeneca. 3. Oil inventories in USAThe dollar I get but Europe has other vaccines and inventory was a build up in crude but refined producers went down as a draw. So when Texas gets back up to speed we’re good?
Of course I sold OXY right before it started going up again yesterday to put $ into AMD. And of course AMD is down after their earnings report...
I Guess that news report wasn’t that bad. Majors are all green now
Buy Now
GATES OXY AND CVX are all partners in the canadian company that at this time appears to have the most advanced carbon capture technology ...Interesting that Buffet just took a massive position in Chevron and already has 10 billion in Oxy ....I am guessing that carbon capture is going to get a massive govt push very very soon
"The Fed controls interest by monitoring the inflation rate which is now below 2%. This rate excludes the price of oil because the oil price is a volatile commodity. In addition, because of Amazon and other online retail platforms, a lot of consumers goods have been historically cheaper as they have eliminated the intermediate supply chains. So, the inflation rate the Fed is monitoring could LAG BIG time to the reality. This lagging factor as the current economy recovery concern could DELAY the FED to act at a reasonable time for it to increase the interest rate. Good fact about this that this will allow the oil price to increase to an unthinkable price. By that time, this oil price will IMPACT the inflation significantly, and will result the Fed with no mercy to increase the interest rates to control the inflation. Before this happens, because of the oil price, OXY's share price could also hit an unthinkable share price. I hope this to be over $100.... We have a plenty of room to gain from this. TRUE DIAMOND HANDS!!!!"
if the shale plays are so great why are so many shale cos going bankrupt?
"Watch for more openings like today, programs will try and push market down to hit stops allowing bigger buying in a more rattled market. Nothings guaranteed in speculating but I like to know they are on the buying side."
You can bet there will be more buyers tomorrow and the day after and the day after
Stock market likes to give you pain and anxiety to make you sell. It weeds out the weak among us. All you have to do is wait for the next leg up which will come with Oxy reporting 1st week of May
Talk about shareholder value loss.... WOW
With Russia Vaccine news we are gonna touch at least 18 Today
I wonder what is the excuse for all this oil drama this time... Just remembering the whole sector is down is not only oxy though.
Finding a new support.. after breaking 2 supports
did you play with some spare money and buy 25 calls for pennies....on top of your massive postions
This board seams to be active.Question : smart idea to buy OXY with margin?. Have 50k.. knowing margin will be covered by the Dividend.
Weekly Call / Put Ratio looks somewhat bullish for OXY. Your thoughts?
More brutal carnage again today? I don’t see it! I’m in...
People on this forum are hilarious. Have some patience. We are heading into a strong bull market for oil.OXY has one of the lowest break even costs in the industry.Give it 4-5 quarter and a significant proportion of the debt will be payed back and then every #$%$ analyst will be slobbering all over this stock. Learn how to play the long game instead of investing like you have ADHD.
"Chevron is not walking away without a revised increase in their offer. The question is how high OXY will go. They will not win this one and the street is betting a massive amount that Chevron will win. OXY will loose and their stock will pop.25,000 May 65 option were bought last week expiring May 17."
+7 % post market it’s going to be a fantastic Monday guys
I sold all the OXY shares I own just now after hours at $15.44 and I'm delighted to get that much.
"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter production is pegged at 1,111 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) per day. The company expects production in the range of 1,085-1,155 MBOE/d and output from Permian Resources within 450-460 MBOE/d.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the bottom line for the first quarter is pegged at a loss of 33 cents per share, indicating a 36.5% improvement from the prior-year loss."
"it's starting to become more clear that mid twenties is where OXY will be with oil in the low 60s. For OXY to hit 30 we. will need crude in the high 60s and for OXY to hit 40, crude I'll need.to be solidly in the 70s.... still think it's going to happen, but this requires patience...."
"Hmm, it’s about time. Nearly $9 Billion debt wall has been addressed AND at a DISCOUNT!!! Not as much as I would have liked, but a discount nonetheless!! The sentiment has changed. It’s minimal but it is changing"
Amazing how we go from one extreme to another. Hardly a month ago the world worried about a war with Iran. Oil went through the roof and Oxy went from high 30s to 47. Then war fears chilled and the virus becomes a pandemic. Oil craters and in a heartbeat were under 40 again....in less than a month. Buy the stock and while your at it XOM.. 59 yesterday....Really?
"Another little bit shaved off the debt. At least OXY management isn't panicking and selling stuff off at garage sale prices. As long as oil stays around $40 and doesn't collapse again, OXY will organically grow out of its debt. Oil to $60 means that it can sell non-core assets for reasonable prices. So, you are betting on oil price average for the next 12 months. Above or below $0?"
management destroyed the value of this company
"Crude above 60 and oxy at low 20s while dogecoin, a useless asset, has a 50 billion usd valuation. This world is upside down."
same where it was April 17
Yes! That’s the golden question
Mizuho upgrades OXY to $58https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mizuho-upgrades-occidental-petroleum-says-170712666.html
"When oil is $55 or above, OXY will do well in making money and dividend is safe. I am holding for dividend until oil is under $50. I had making trades on stocks but this one is a holding stock for me for now. The bottom for this stock is $37-38 no matter how bad the news were, meaning there are investors who see value at this range. Now, we have less uncertainties on trades and OPEC cut deeper on oil production, Oil companies mostly likely do well in 2020."
"HOLLUB: "" CLOSE ANADARKO ASAP""HOUSTON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp plans to quickly complete its $38 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum after the latter’s Aug. 8 shareholder vote, the company said on Thursday.The earlier-than-expected closing will give the company a head start to evaluate assets that it plans to sell to pay off debt supporting the acquisition, Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on a conference call following release of the company’s second-quarter results.Occidental is battling activist investor Carl Icahn, who opposed the deal and launched a proxy fight to remove and replace four Occidental directors over what he called the “misguided” acquisition. That contest is expected to drag on into the fall.Anadarko shareholders are expected next week to approve a deal that provides a 57% premium to its share price the day before it disclosed acquisition talks.Hollub said the company would not make a decision on the fate of Anadarko’s stake in Western Midstream Partners until after the closing."
"My prediction: Sometime between now and the next 5 months, we’ll be in the mid $30s. 7 months from now; mid $40s. If oil really was dead, OXY would not have recovered as much as it already has."
"Bashing the CEO, for what?? Making a deal that her AND her team felt Oxy needed. She arranged the money, got commitments for asset sales and is executing the merger, including merging headquarters, cutting synergys, etc. Oxy has a hedge on for 2020 of $55 that maxes at $74. Maybe we should support the leadership team?"
Icahn unloading like crazy and driving the price down. Great buying opportunity before earnings.
"Value stocks taking a beating. $rad. $x. $db, $oxy. Double down or sell"
Shorts right now
You you realize the large buys happen after the dips of small volume. Stinks! Of manipulation of course. Do not sell. I had a few of my posts deleted for mentioning the market makers
Awesome. I get to buy more today!
"One of the biggest bargains at stock market. Oxy is much more worth, everybody knows that, oxy is 65 usd stock if oil,is at 55 usd. Actually we are at 42 usd +10 USD hedge = 52 usd. I am adding additional shares. A asset Deal and the landmark deal in Wyoming will revealed very soon...latest then, ox stock price should explode to 30 usd minimum or higher. The same is devon, eog and pdce."
with oil rising very soon we will see great results in oxy

"Costs are increasing for almost every single sector; due to the rise in oil prices, which effect shipping and transportation costs. Virtually everyone’s bottom line will be negatively affected while the oil companies’ profits, increase. I’m surprised that they don’t report this more in the media. If you’re not in oil, you’re a sitting duck."
Iran is part of opec..
"Hard to be bullish, and they are 50% of my portfolio, they are SO exposed to a reversal in Brent, even a slight one. They are not giving a lot of hope despite the upbeat tone. They are not giving any datapoint that could help the stock, it's all in the slides and: ""hope to improve margins"""
Sure fire way to get PPS up is terminate CEO. Day late & billions short what could possibly go wrong?
"I almost regret having Mutmeh on mute..........ah, just kidding. The OXY bull is out. Debt still a huge concern, but cash flow is king. Hopefully they pay debt down fast and wait on the dividend. Refi of longer term debt at lower rates is becoming more of an option the higher oil moves. Win - Win"
why are energy companies trading like oil is at $40?
It is Friday and we are taking a break. Just a down day. No big deal. Ton of bullish news for oil. Oil heading to $65. Chance to add. Expect a bumpy road next 2 months then a smooth sail to $35 or higher
The question really is -can OXY survive THIS ( COVID-19 + APC acquisition ) without a RECAP that eliminates common shareholders ? I believe it’s more likely than not given today’s situation that OXY will have to reorganize under Ch-11 . I do also believe OXY has a chance to pull out of the nosedive but a few things have to go RIGHT and that surely hasn’t been the case in recent history . With a Biden presidential win - it’s game over for OXY . Not only will shareholders get wiped out but bond holders will get a close shave  & hair cut  too . With a Trump victory AND a return to more stable oil prices above $40 we could see a recovery in OXY shares .
OPENING STATEMENT...SIGNIFICANT FREE CASH FLOW THE REST OF THE YEAR
6 more trading days in May. That will mark 2 full months of the quarter above $60. My guess is that week have all 3 over $60. That should be very profitable for OXY.....#CommoditySuperCycle

"Been waiting for under 9 alert all day. OXY ended in green on a day when Trump got covid, crude went down. Will see what Monday brings. Have a wonderful weekend folks."
"I’m in 800 shares at $55.60It’s too late to sell. Might as well ride it out and collect the dividend for now and see what happens. Might turn $48 then turn around. Eventually things will start to calm down. I don’t think anyone is selling down here, it just he shorts. Eventually they will have to start to cover and this will pop."
"Most analysts have made up their minds about oil prices.There is a growing consensus that Brent crude, the global benchmark, is likely to average at least $60 a barrel for the foreseeable future, and companies will finally earn profits that have eluded them for years. But some of this bounty has already been baked into the stocks, and Bank of America analyst Doug Leggate thinks it is time to pull back on certain names.On Monday, the recent oil rally took a pause: Brent futures were down 1.4%, to $68.23 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate futures were down 1.5%, to $64.62 a barrel.Bank of America thinks $60 oil is here to stay, because OPEC is ready to defend that price with aggressive production cuts, and shale producers in the U.S. have also curbed production. Last year, when oil traded in the $20s and $30s for much of the year, a $60 baseline price seemed unthinkable.The oil surge is obviously bullish for oil companies, and the bank increased its price targets on oil stocks by an average of 17%. Still, some of those stocks have already run up so much that they no longer look like bargains. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production exchange-traded fund (ticker: XOP) is already up 53% this year.Leggate lowered his ratings on ConocoPhillips (COP), EOG Resources (EOG), Cimarex Energy (XEC), and Continental Resources (CLR) to Neutral “despite free cash yields that support greater return of cash to shareholders, but where the value of unlevered free cash flow net of debt suggests upside is more limited versus the broader sector.” In short, he sees better opportunities elsewhere. Continental, for instance, is already up 75% this year.His top ideas are Exxon Mobil (XOM), because of its strong dividend yield (now 5.8%); Hess (HES) and APA (APA) for their oil exploration potential; and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) and Devon Energy (DVN), after those companies have bought other shale producers at market lows.His top U.S. pick is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which fought through a particularly difficult 2020 after loading up on debt to buy competitor Anadarko Petroleum. His price target for Occidental is $40. The stock was down 6% on Monday to $28.80."
Down 4% on 5 million shares. Too funny!
The [Futures] Shorts could take Crude down next couple of months.
"Show of hands, how many think think the 7+% common dividend is safe?? Company is like Freeport when they decided to buy an oil company at the top of the market mostly for debt. In the end, to save the company, they had to unload it at a firesale price. Never really recovered albeit they had other problems unrelated to the company purchase. Real bad timing here, crude collapsing and it looks like one of the sovreign funds is unloading all their EandPs at the same time plus the press has talked us into recession thinking."
"Lol, oil @ 64 bucks, This should be over 35 a share"
"Once again today Shortking said this “ @Mr Clean Daily short volume was at 40% last week. Do you know what that means? It means you need to learn what daily short volume is.

Have a nice day”.....Any of you want to do pro bono work and help this homeless dog walker out ? "
The $80 a barrel forecasted for Q3 by Goldman Sachs is the biggest jump ever forecasted!
Icahn clearly stated that he was selling a few shares...OXY IS STILL ABOUT 10% OF HIS ENTIRE PORTFOLIO AFTER THE SALE ..I POSTED A WEEK AGO HE WAS TEARING THE BANDAID OFF ....
Why it’s crazy up today? Any news?
"Jul. 19--Activist investor Carl Icahn revealed Thursday the four people he wants to appoint to the board of Occidental Petroleum(OXY) as part of his proxy war with the Houston oil and gas producer.Icahn named former Shell Oil President John Hofmeister and three of Icahn's close business allies as his four selections in his bid to replace nearly half of the Oxy board, according to a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Last month, Icahn, who has built a nearly 5 percent ownership stake in Oxy, started the process to call for a special meeting. He's waging the proxy war because of his opposition to Oxy's pending $38 billion acquisition to The Woodlands-based Anadarko Petroleum(APC).In a multi-step process, Icahn first needs the support of holders of 20 percent of Oxy's stock to set a record date to determine which shareholders can petition to hold a special meeting.Apart from Hofmeister, Icahn's other potential nominees are Icahn Capital portfolio manager Nicholas Graziano, Icahn Enterprises(IEP) general counsel Andrew Langham, and Alan LeFevre, who was previously named to a board seat at Herbalife after Icahn won a proxy bid there.LeFevre is a former chief financial officer at the consumer products company Jarden Corp., which was acquired by Newell Brands(NWL) -- another company where Icahn controls board seats.The four board members that Icahn is seeking to remove are Oxy Chairman Eugene Batchelder, a retired ConocoPhillips(COP) executive; Spencer Abraham, head of The Abraham Group consulting firm; Margaret Foran, a Prudential Financial(PRU) senior executive; and Avedick Poladian, a former real estate executive at Lowe Enterprises.Oxy has told its shareholders that Icahn's efforts ""are not in the best interests of Occidental or its stockholders,"" and that the focus must be on completing the Anadarko acquisition.Oxy told shareholders if they had already agreed to back Icahn's special board meeting that they could still revoke their support."
"I am back in.... give it 6 months ... vaccine ... oil demand will return... there will eventually be a rotation into oil, travel, airlines... where else can you find value in this market? Crazy valuations out there"
Big hedge funds repositioning for end of the year? I think Oil companies get back to normal historic levels in 2021.
"Street loving the conference call, shares selling off!!!!!!!"
"I don't see how OXY goes bankrupt. It will be bought way before. If you think like I do, that oil isn't going to be under $45 a year from now, then OXY is a strong buy here. That's why Carl is buying. Buffett could pay $30 a share, pay off debt, and still have $60 billion in cash at BRK.The cash flow from OXY would be huge. I just don't see an OXY bankruptcy. Now, if your cost basis is higher than $30, no need to panic. The Middle East isn't exactly a stable source of oil. Russia could take out those Saudi oil fields thru Syria. I'm liking OXY here."
oxy rise!!
"That’s why I said when I’m bullish follow me. When I sell you sell. I sold at 31 earlier this year, bought back in around 25"
I backdoor 2600 shares out of my IRA into my Roth at a 31+ value. Long term is where it at. Pay my tax now because tax will higher in the future. Go long.
"The way i read this, Buffet is simply extending a loan to OXY, not buying a stake in it. Bad deal for OXY. Nothing to lose for Buffet"
I can't wait for all those Monday morning quarterbacks to come out a year from now saying how they wish they would have bought OXY when it was $10 and how the writing was on the wall when Icahn and insiders were buying at these levels.......

If you go back to 1/28 & 1/29 when XOM & CHV reported that’s when oil stocks took off. For example Oxy was $20.66 and CHV $86. Once the 2 big oil companies reported the rest of sector took off.
If this hits 25 I am going all IN
"I got out at 14.2. Not because I don't think it will bounce back, but the opportunity cost, the profit I could have made from other stocks. I get back my loss from OXY in a week buying other stocks."

CNBC interviewed 30 fund managers about two weeks ago and xom was at top of the list for this year ....oil stocks can easily give the % gains that ALL fund managers need . The fact that xom was on the list means oil and gas is a primary target ... bp apa cqp etc

"Found this interesting,“Concho and Conoco together produced about 1.3 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence, just shy of the output of crude giant Occidental.”"

Oil price will recover latest with the vaccine , because the supply and future investments were MASSIVLY curtailed. Also the big like total, Shell, etc have cut their budgets and will Never go back to these levels, they all have announced.

"Oxy didn't hit a 52 week low, its a 10 year low. WOW. Chevron, Total, Shell, Berkshire (Buffett), Icahn and of course Oxy. I like the players involved.....they all have interest in Oxy, that is real good.They basically bought 1/2 of California on top of OIL......yes we use is around the world!This might be a ""Coulda/ Shoulda buy.......love the players and this deal isn't done, she is real smart."
Instead of buying back oxy just bought gild under $63. Reported great earnings. Has solid dividend and also has nothing to do with the global economy.
Need oil to stabilize above $60.00 / brl. I was hoping that the high of the day held.

"My thought was this thing was being prepped to sell, but with Chevron bowing out for another company I'm not sure who might buy it....Even if someone like Exxon did, they won't be paying a big price....as shown by the Chevron deal."
Short squeeze tomorrow. Going back up.
Morgan Stanley upgraded OXY with a price target of $59 a share! Says that the dividend is best in class and is safe with room to grow. Nice!!!!
"what with the imminent asset sales along with analyst upgrades, the push back in debt covenants and the issuance of warrants, it is very clear that oxy is now in play especially visible on days like today when crude is slightly in the red and oxy is outperforming its peers"

"Oil prices rose around 1% on Tuesday after major producers showed they were cutting crude output in line with their commitments on restraint, supporting a market thrown out of kilter by weak demand during the coronavirus pandemic.

Dodge & Cox Inc is a major holder of this stock. They are forecasting that by the third quarter of this year working from home will end as it exist today. Some will work from home but a majority will go back to the office. This will cause a rise in oil prices and create more demand in oil. They are expecting energy to be the value investment. I am still holding long on this one even though I don't like what Vicki has done with the company.
"Jim Carmer said sell, then it’s a buy"
The writer Michael Boyd of the negatively biased Seeking Alpha article just posted openly admits at the end of the article that he is short OXY. I could have guessed that when I started reading it. Perhaps he should admit this at the beginning of the article instead so I could stop reading.

"if oil stays up above 60 for a week, this stock will really start to move... wow.. it's gonna be a great summer"
I don't know what you all talking about. This stock aren't going no where until the oil industry agree to increase price of oil. I don't know if you notice but this stock has been going side way for the last two months. We might get luck to even maintain at this level other wise this company will burn in flame.

Reminds me of Rite Aid ..beaten up forgotten for no good reason. If the stock was trading 15-20 dollars higher when oil was lower???? in addition they bought another great company...would you guess that synergies alone could account for a massive addition to Eps....The permean production is massive..just read latest reports on the amount of nat gas and oil there..even mobil doubled their holdings...now OXy is the largest holder sitting on gold. AS SOON AS THE CEO LAYS ABOUT A CLEAR PLAN AND THE EPS POTENTIAL THIS WILL SHOOT BACk to the 60s and higher . I would imagine that it will not be a long wait they may must have all their largest holders..far more than Icahn infuriated by the drop from the high sixties to 40. I would guess that many will increase holdings jan 2 and on from there and the CEO will lay out her plan of how OXy will earn far more because of the deal....this is going to be good

I told you weeks ago to sell TSLA and buy $XLE $OXY $ERX. Tesla remains way overvalued. Get into oil and gas stocks while you still have tremendous upside. Stimulus is inflationary for the dollar. Oil is traded exclusively in dollars globally. This means oil will continue to rise. Get in now and ride the wave for the next 4-5 years to $125 oil.
Aide from the spike today oil has held up great ..in the 60s...THEY WILL CRUSH ESTIMATES AND GUIDANCE...AS I posted last month beaten up oil and gas will be the new stars starting the new year...and OXY is at the top

"Something to think about.According to NASA, the gases in Earth's atmosphere include:Nitrogen — 78%; Oxygen — 21%; Argon — 0.93%; Carbon dioxide — 0.04%Just as important is the fact that CO2 is 50% heavier than either oxygen or nitrogen (the earth's smart like that). The plants and oceans need the CO2 so it wouldn’t be good if it wasn’t falling back to the ground. Minor fluctuations of a trace element in Earth's atmosphere is NOT going to lead to global catastrophe in 12 years. It is impossible for CO2 to create a heat bubble around the earth. That is Science."

"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4305408-occidental-petroleum-7_5-percent-growing-yield-oversold-e-and-p-oil-company11/12/2019""At the same time, OXY has said it will grow production by 5% a year. So, considering the two together, we think OXY can maintain the dividend with a flattish production profile at $50/barrel. There are lots of moving parts to this number, and OXY's own realized prices net of transportation costs can fluctuate a lot. The company did emphasize its commitment to the dividend in the second quarter conference.""""ConclusionWe think oil will average over $60/barrel and that will be the minimum required to balance supply and demand. As such, we think OXY is a strong buy at current prices and is worth at least $60/share. While the stock may ultimately move even higher, Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B) preferred stake which was done as part of the financing for the APC deal came with call options on OXY stock at $62.50/share. Those are highly dilutive, and they will likely cap upside on moderate oil price moves. At the same time, we are certain that the shrewd investor who goes by the name Warren Buffett would have not asked for these if he did not see the oil cycle turning after years of battering for the E&P names. We would buy OXY for the dividend, half now and half into year end, and enjoy the delicious 7.5% yield."""
"There has been lot of discussion about smaller debt reduction this quarter. This was asked and answered during Q&A. They had to increase working capital by about 1B. Why? There was a timing mismatch between revenue recognition and actual cash received and working capital was increased due to this. apparently, it is typical of Q1 of a year. As the analyst himself pointed out, it's just a matter of timing. Q2 will most likely see reversal of working capital, adding to cash on hand. Also, there is no super urgency to reduce debt and there very little debt due for another two years. Once there is larger chunk of cash is on hand, and fcf visibility improves, they will have flexibility of choosing the right debt tranche to payoff to maximize impact."
"The longer we base in this area, the better. Asset sales coming, big dividend coming, insiders buying and oil prices rising. What more of a gift do you want people?"

"MKM Partners upgraded the stock to a “buy” rating. “OXY has depreciated over 20% since early March (vs. XOP down 15%-20%) and reflects approximately 30% equity value upside, thus meriting an upgrade from Neutral to Buy,”"

"Another set of good news from India is that it might have peaked, and the curve should start flattening"
right now forward dividend is 6.3%. if we buy the stock here we are not far off WB preferred stock level yield with upside potential. of course WB has the long dated option in his package but the strike is all the way at 62. This is starting to look interesting risk and benefit.
I believe that continual slide of the US dollar against most currencies is giving legs to the oil price. traders aren't putting much credence in short term nymex or WTI oil pricing weakness as they continue to see the dollar weakening.

Patiently waiting for $20. Tomorrow after EIA releases solid numbers
Cool whatever dip down under 27 tomorrow on opening then in one day probably see 1.50-$2 back we are stuck in a range cycle now
We get big drawdowns in the EIA report @ 10:300 we should blow through resistance @ $27.01!!!!
You know what that means right
we at 24.50 targeting 27 by may or sooner
I believe we are basing and the bottom is in. The chart is telling me we are on a path back to $32 within 6-8 weeks if it holds true. Economy is opening and the next earnings will be even better than last. FCF was at a 10 high for the quarter. Amazing! Q2 is going to crush Q1. And Q3 will demolish Q2. Then I believe we get some calming in the market.
OPEC news for every three extra barrels of demand opec will “increase by one barrel of production gradually￼
if it does buy APC..... it won't need an acquirer... it will easily grow to 100 a share on its own (over time) you have to remember.. the reason why these companies want darko in the first place.. is not just straight wells... but the land to take advantage of horizontal wells and oxy already has drilling tech to take advantage of both... besides.. everyone has it in their heads that somehow oxy has to keep all the assets.. they don't... things that are redundant will be combined for synergy.. the parts that are not really relevant will be jettisoned off.. much like if you are a real estate investor and you specialize in rental homes.. you can buy a portfolio from someone else that contains homes and commercial.. once you have the package.. you can cherry pick the properties.. keep the homes... and off the parts that don't fit your objective. In reality... i'm not expecting oxy to win the bid for darko anyways... but its too late to buy darko... chev is already pretty much at full value... in the long run I see oxy going up a higher % from where its at and faster than chev.... and the dividend is better at current time. just my 2c opinion.
"This should be no different than XOM, CVX after earnings. Both worse than expected. Write everything off for 2020. 2021 will be huge for most all oil companies. The biggest thing on OXY is the debt and they paid off more than expected. Should be a very positive conference call about the future. This could/ should be at $30 by Friday."
"Now earning report will decide if it's crossing $28 today/tomorrow or falling back to $25. What you guys think? In the last 1 year, the stock price hasn't moved after earning report though."
"Market did not like Powell's question and answer meeting , he pressed for Congress to act and for low oil to keep inflation low . See how the futures open and how overseas reacts , OPEC+ meeting. Need to see if move is just because of the hurricanes ( short lived bump ) or a real change. Close above 12.60 could open it for a nice move to 17-18 , close below 11.10 and back into down trend."
"What a perfect storm set up. The Big's are awash in debt. They have dropped Capex by an astronomical amount. All are pledging to work on their debt by, in part, lowering dividends. Oxy is effectively a non issuer of dividends. When will the divvy come back? At ~$25 billion of debt. I believe that a divestment of assets is coming. No need to rush it, but when BRENT goes to $80, sell for top dollar. Also, OXY is in the green below $37. Its basically $20 over that now! 1.2 million barrels X 90 days =108 million X $20 = $2.16 Billion in cash for the coffers. Thats every quarter at $57!!! At $65, thats where we average imo, its another $1 billion per quarter. 365 X 1.2 mboe X $30=~$13 Billion in profits!! Thats average pricing over the year, we are already pushing $60 and the world hasn't even opened. What happens next year when its all open and there is a supply squeeze due to lack of CapEx? Yeah, its about to get ugly. Imo, OXY, eoy2022, is a $100 stock and the Warrants will be gaining premium. Warrants could be $100 as well. I would rather own the warrants."
So I’m going to say it . IF we get news before ER of a substantial divestiture favorable to the bottom line - we go up past $50 fast like BOOM . Otherwise I look for a steady climb up . Either way $50’s right around the corner here .

Oxy showed alot of relative strength today, I am convinced earning estimates will be revised upward consistently over next few days and weeks.

"SO here we are standing at the precipice - where to now? Do we fall off INTO the gorge or climb UP to higher levels. Right here the key indicators I am watching are...very bullish and more so than a long time. NOW, we want to see some real confirmation here without significant saw-tooth price movement. I want to see CONVICTION here to support the indicators I see. AND, I believe we will see that. Remember, the yields alone are like a Utility and most are SAFE so dividends can drive performance in this yield hungry environment. ENERGY is out of favor another excellent potential driver as money looks for places to go in 2020. SO you have twin drivers that are powerful. Then you add the high potential for incremental improvement in top/bottom line AND more consolidation within the industry. World-wide recovery on the back of improved Tariff factors. Tariffs are Tariff-ying and being unshackled from it is a very positive psychological and financial driver. ENERGY could well be a top performer in 2020. It has been quiet in the House of Ms. Hollub - not a lot of news out and I like that. She isn't coming out petting and soothing shareholders like babies or pets...she will do it by the numbers on announcements. The naysayers have the upper hand now based on uncertainty BUT Vicki is a very solid executive and I will always put my money down on that....as I clearly stated I did as it bounced off its lows. SO today and tomorrow we could well see this stock pop over 40 as smart money readies for 2020. John Templeton said, If you want to have a better performance than the crowd you must do things differently than the crowd.....and that is what both Vicki and we the long shareholders are doing and I submit we are RIGHT. Now I could be wrong BUT, I don't think so. Good day. Boolean"

"OXY says we have reached peak oil in the US. If they are correct about supply, their odds of surviving go up from 50% to 75%. However, if the peak is about the demand side, those odds drop from 50% to 30% or worse, depending on how steep the decline w/ respect to a Biden possible victory. Is this investing or gambling?"
"Oxy subsidiary got its first paying customer SHOPIFY...to remove carbon...small acct but still symbolic..in addition to the ethanol plant by the gulf which is a much bigger deal and the other consulting job to build a mega plant near a concrete plant ...all good news for the 'STORY"""
Congrats Longs
Carl picked a bad day to sell
Yup today is the day folks upside resistance is melting away . I’ll be plucking my cherries  soon as options expire tomorrow .
"If I didn't think this thing has the potential to jump 25%+ any given week (with the announcement of a multi-billion dollar divestiture of non-core assets and payment of debt), this sure would be a fun stock to trade, but I don't want to get out just to miss the next leg up."
WTI new high of day $64.06/barrel!! Up over $2.00
"Man, I've been looking if there are other possible beaten down undervalue stocks.. and Oxy is simply the best one... They basically pushed most of their near term debt maturities. You've got only 4 billion dollar which is like due starting from year 2022 (a single asset sale + current cash + future fcf likely more than enough to handle this) then you get a huge break in 2023 with debt obligation. So.. the company is good until 2024. Now.. their fcf reported in the 3rd quarter with average wti 40.18 was 500 million dollars and this is conservative value. Bear in mind that we had low production due to covid 19. Now WTI is at 48.00 and I would like to remind you that the U.S. dollar is weakening and the majority of oil baskets in the world including OPEC are now higher than 50. If the u.s dollar weakens, the U.S. will likely export oil, not import oil because they have to pay more. We saw this back in 2009. Oxy's FCF grows by 200million dollars per $1 increase in WTI AT CURRENT PRODUCTION. This means with WTI standing 48, Oxy will be making 1.6 billion dollars more per year with current WTI price after making all interest payment, buffett payment, operating expense etc. This increase further if they produce more oil next year. I get pe ratio of 5 using their FCF with their stock price 19.18. I mean at some point you just know it is god darn cheap. They purchased Anardarko for 40 billion dollars. Maybe they should've bought it for 25 billion dollars? who cares?? they market cap right now stands at 18 billion and they have no risk going bankrupt in another 3 years at least. What the heck am I missing here? I put $300,000 on this company and I feel so confident that once we return to normal and we WILL return to normal according to Fauci and all the other experts next year in summer or fall. You will at least make 50% - 100% of your money. My target price for oxy until the end of 2021 year is $50.00. If Goldman Sach and Trafigura are right with their WTI estimate of 60-65 next year. With weak dollar, get ready for retirement guys. By the way, Goldman Sach predicted wti correctly the entire this year."
Buffet accepts common shares instead of dividend...these are good news. I.e warren believes in oxys strength that it will survive and will come out stronger out of the temporary crises.

"Just watching the CNBC interview with the CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) It's a $157.00 stock up almost a buck today. This is exactly where OXY should be right now. $157.00.....Instead, thanks to stupid Vicki Hollub and her get rich quick scheme shareholders are stuck with a $25 stock that is going nowhere but down. Give that CEO another bonus. Pathetic."
just have patience
"Patience...therbare playing some a game with ox? Ox is much more worth. Now with 1,3 Billion asset sale and 4,5 billion ahead with Ghana sales we will see realistixh stock prices. The supply is down and at thismoil,price there are no investments in oil exploration, hence the oil price will rise soon in another dimensions, 55-65 usd. I never will sell at these ridicolous stock prices."
Oxy declaring the dividend too! thats great news!
"Here’s what you need to do with your profits from $AMC and $GME. The market has taken on the false narrative that a virus caused the entire world’s infrastructure to change overnight to all solar and wind. This is simply a false narrative. There’s no doubt that the industrialized world will transition to green energy, but this will take a coordinated effort for the next 15 years.What do we do in the meantime? We change government policies to discourage oil and gas production. Part of this is to limit supply to drive up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. This makes green alternative energy more tenable because it is cheap relative to oil and gas.In the US, the easy policies of the old administration actually hurt the oil and gas industry. They drilled and drilled until the US became the world leading exporter of oil and gas. Then COVID happened and world wide demand dropped by 8% - that’s right only 8%.So far in 2021, demand has recovered by 5%. As of right now, we are only using 3% less oil and gas than we were. Does that sound like a dead industry? Absolutely not.The meteoric stock price rise of solar companies and $TSLA is a bubble. The profits are not there.Now with oil at $53 and Nat Gas at $2.85 - oil companies are profitable.With oil and gas supply being limited by policy - we can expect oil to be $75 by 2022 and over $100 by 2023 - 2035. This is the last golden age of black gold. The last bull market of oil before the oil majors buyout the green energy companies with the treasure troves of cash they are going to generate over the next 15 years.So...take your profits and buy $OXY $XLE $XOM $CVX $ET & $GEL. You’ll triple your money in two years."
goin red....what a drag
this could be the bottom. the merger charges are in and now can focus on the synergies and strategy. need some good news for next quarter and this will climb back over 60 if oil prices agree.
"Oil prices rose over 1% on Wednesday to hit their highest in nearly a month as widely-watched data showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell more than expected, underpinning a market already buoyed by worries over potential U.S.-Iran conflict."
"My fellow OXYs,1. So, OPEC members currently agree on cutting 1.2 million barrels per day2. OPEC members are meeting in Vienna, Austria, as we speak, and they want to cut another 400,000 barrels per day3. Total they want to cut is 1.2 million + 400,000 = 1.6 million barrels per day4. Here's the bad news:...a. USA has ALREADY sanctioned BOTH Iran and Venezuela to REDUCE the number of OIL barrels available in the market...b. USA, Brazil, and Norway are INCREASING the number of OIL barrels available in the market5. So, without agreeing to CUT more oil barrels, OPEC will FAIL to control how many OIL barrels are available in the market6. In other words: Too much OIL ==> Low prices ==> OXY has LOW revenues ==> OXY stock goes DOWN ==> OXY cut dividend ==> OXY stock goes further DOWN ==> OXY stock is risky?7. This is the reason why OXY today is hitting the $37.78 low price as we speak...8. So, I might buy some OXY tomorrow, after the OPEC meeting concludes!Peace!"
WTI is creeping close to the 54 range and is expected to keep rising. Was expecting 55 by mid year but now already at 54 that speeds up the process for OXY to hit 30+ in the short term. Condolences for those who panicked and sold today. Expecting today to be green and if Oil reaches 55 expect another huge rally. Still undervalued.
The street has lost confedence in this company since they aren't making debt reduction a priority!
NOG beat up 7% oxy is next
***** BOOOOST !! OXY just got a kick in the hindquarters..... HIGHER...... now up over 3% just after 2 o clock.......W..... we talked about this possibility before noon how about a afternoon kick..... sure looks like it's happening.............. SWEET*****deepsub
"Oil goes up, market goes up, OXY doesn't follow. Oil goes down, market goes down, OXY goes down massively. Just doesn't make sense."
"Recent increasing covid cases in Europe as well as Biden's rumored tax plan has lowered WTI.. But in my opinion, OPEC would start increasing production when WTI is hovering at 75 to 80 dollars. With slight exaggeration, the oil price is being decided by one country alone and that's Saudi. No one can say #$%$ because it was Saudi who increased the price of oil by 30% with its surprise additional cut. The funny thing is that they made more money by the price increase even though it is producing less oil. I for one believe unless there is a pressure from other countries, Saudi will cause shortage by keeping OPEC production cut until COVID is over. Oil price can really spike to 100 dollars momentarily. I think this can happen in near future around May to July."
"I just broke even guys. Thank you for holding. Now on the way to $30, who’s with me"

Cas machine will crush estimates....they said breakeven is 40$ a barrel..the combined companies do about 1. 4 barrels per day and that does not include any ramp up...so about 510 million per year...oil has been hovering around 57-64 so lets say 59...19 over breakeven ...that almost 10 billion in ebita..not including tons of gas coming out on top and other factors...so even if they floated the whole debt of 50 billion at 6% thats about 3-3.5 billion ....you can do the math still leaves over 6 billion ..the stock should be much much higher

How long before OXY will need to raise their dividend? With the rising SP and aparrent substantial rise in FCF from surging oil prices one would guess it would be hard for the company to justify not doing so. Any thoughts?
Miranda go away!!!

"Honestly, of all the stocks that I own only 2 of them are giving me a headache. They are my favorite stocks. They are OXY and VIAC. Both have no fundamental reason to be trading at the oversold level that they are trading at, but there it is...I have been in the same situation before in the past 40 years of trading: Fundamental analysis telling me one thing but the market telling me something else. I have always used the same strategy: I have continued to buy, and buy, and patiently waited for the tide to turn. I guess that I am mule headed. I also have observed that the market is fickle and what is poison today is gold tomorrow."
Only a matter of time with oil & the market going higher that oil stocks are back in the Vogue . Higher WTI potentially saving OXY from what could have been a very unhappy ending .
Oxy is very cheap ..normally it shoul be abt 40 usd minimum at this oil price level.Many expect oil Prise rising to 80 usd.
Their holdings are incredible...24.5 % of the largest gas field in the WORLD in Qatar....40% of the largest gas field in Oman and 6 million acres there.Largest acreage holder in the Permian...one of the largest holders in the Gulf of Mexico...significant holdings in Algeria...largest producer in the DJ basin ..millions of acres in Columbia on shore and off shore ...their gas field holdings alone in the middle east could be worth worth tens of billions ...Buffett just bought a pipeline in the US for 12 billion...the gas fields in the middle east are massive .
Institutional buying in place for OXY. More than 50% of daily volume already traded. Tighten your seatbelts!

Employee buyouts ? The Co also stated that it’s considering stock for debt swaps . That likely won’t work out well Much more likely we’ll see DEBT for stock swaps in a reorganization . That’ll mean current shareholders get wiped out .
"Starting to resemble the FTX buy of plains exploration with cash and dilution and assumption of debt at the top of the energy market. Stockholders were enraged but it did not matter. BTW, unless there is a price clause nixing this deal if OXY goes below a set price, right now it is at 51.55 pre market, they have no out. Right now at .2934 shares of oxy plus $59, the deal is set at $74.12 per APC share for those who believe OXY will trade at 52 or so when the deal is done. Besides the outstanding, OXY will have an overhang of the 80million shares from the warrants at 62.50 plus the $8 billion in preferred paying 8% per annum. Said another way, they will owe about 16B in assumed debt or about 800MM annually in interest; 800MM in undeductable preferred dividends plus interest on new debt they incur in this deal which I estimate to be about 700MM in interest per annum, if the TOTAL deal flys, for a total carrying charge of 2.3MMM BEFORE paying any dividends on the common shares. Obviously they are counting on unloading other properties into a buyers market plus having to consider those properties contribute to revenue. A win win for APC stockholders, a win for Buffet, a loss for OXY stockholders. I wonder when someone takes a look at OXY, now or when the dust settles from this deal? Of course they would have to get some agreement from WB. Those warrants are a block and the preferred cannot be taken out before ten years. So WB is effectively controlling OXY's future."

All Oil stocks are up today. Rotation from Tech to Oil. This week will be one of the best weeks for Oil stocks. Hold on to your OXY shares. Brent Crude is at the verge of breaking the 70 mark. It touched 69.9 today. It is going to cross 70 anytime in the next 1 week. It will set up panic buying of Oil stocks and OXY will benefit the most as this is the most beaten down Oil stock. The only oil stock that has not yet recovered to it's pre-pandemic price.

What happened with that?? I was surprised Icon decided to sell off part of his stake, I wonder why and why now? Around 24 seems like a resistance point. Penetrate that and 20.25 could be the next one. We need some upside mo but none seems at hand. Everytime I think of our president, I think she should have a personalized plate, 85 to 10.

"I feel the oil move higher was only because of the Hurricanes , OPEC+ did what I was expecting with SA talking about the old cut levels and not much else . There is another little depression in the gulf which may keep more supply off the market for a short time . Anyone can guess at the oil price and have the same chance on being right ( negative oil this year no one saw ) . So my guess is for the rest of the year between mid30s and low 40s with more to the lower side . Oil never got to the earlier higher price in September of 43+ so I would think it is a failed attempt to move higher . But things can change to drive it higher or lower , no one knows for sure . ( OXY's price between 9-12 for the near future ( next couple of months ) , 4th quarter will be the real driver with earnings and election. Will see a draw the next couple of weeks which may be a short term help ."
"Oxy will Rallye MASSIVLY next week once Index issue has passed. I see 30 usd, no joke. Oil is at 50.....when oil was at 60 oxy shares were at 60 usd....unbelievable how cheap it is, a bargain."
"It’s been a tough few weeks, but the bigger risk is not being in when it pops. This may be your last chance to load up before $30s and beyond!"
This is the weirdest price movement these last few days. Huge opening swings. It looks like checkers. Tomorrow is up. Just wierd

"EIA published this document and says that oil will be 100$/barrell in 2018 dollars. If we assume OXY's breakeven for profitability is $50/barrell, then with 1.2 Million barrells/day, OXY will generate $21/share in profit.https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/ieo/pdf/ieo2020.pdf"
"RoyalCarribean raised 2 billion at 5% interest rate, and they dont even have a ride for next several months. And some here claim that OXY cant refinance"
Are we just 14 days from the warrants being issued to OXY shareholders? I can't wait to get my hands on them. I will be looking to purchase more warrants when they are listed for trading. I like the idea of a long term option (2007) to purchase OXY at $22.00 per share as I believe WTI will be close to $90.00 per barrel by 2007.
So BP reports a strong quarter due to commodity price! It looks like OXY and XOM will have blowout quarter when they report. That should shut up shills like Celine

"At this point, CHEVRON is down 10% BUT OXY is down 25%......SEE WHAT A LITTLE DEBT VICKI PILED SHAREHOLDERS WITH HAS DONE.... Chevron has increased its dividend as well , Oxy may have to reduce its dividend.......As for Warren, he is down 45 billion at the moment on KRAFT , the company he pushed for........Vicki needed him of course and he was certainly shocked when she offered the company for his money.......Who wouldn't be"
Just loaded up on more oxy as Janet is bad mouthing oil stocks!
OXY won’t above 35 in 2020. All Bets accepted.
I have an axe to grind with OXY but it is with Vicki and the BoD''s total mismanagement of the company. I'd like them to survive but they have a lot of the attributes of CHK and we know how that story ended.Now add in Biden and the democratic communist parties stated policy to ban fracking and move off fossil fuels ASAP will result in a colossal economic disaster god help us.

You daytraders are nuts...you buy puts and calls expiring within weeks and expect profits...rethink your strategies...this will not go out and conversely it will not be 60 for a long long time...same thing at apache it was 4..that right 4 and now its up 300% and complaints there..xom the same rite aid..

"10K where is it OXY? Filing deadlines[edit]Historically, Form 10-K had to be filed with the SEC within 90 days after the end of the company's fiscal year. However, in 2004, the SEC approved a Final Rule that changed the deadlines to 60 days for Form 10-K for ""accelerated filers""; meaning issuers that have a public float of at least $75 million, that have been subject to the Exchange Act's reporting requirements for at least 12 calendar months, that previously have filed at least one annual report, and that are not eligible to file their quarterly and annual reports on Forms 10-QSB and 10-KSB. These shortened deadlines were to be phased in over a three-year period, however in 2004 the SEC postponed the three-year phase in by one year. In December 2005, the SEC created a third category of ""large accelerated filers,"" accelerated filers with a public float of over $700 million. As of December 27, 2005, the deadline for filing for large accelerated filers was still 75 days, however beginning with the fiscal year ending on or after December 15, 2006, the deadline was changed to 60 days. For other accelerated filers the deadline remains at 75 days and for non-accelerated filers the deadline remains at 90 days. For further reading, see the Final Rules [1] section of the SEC's website, referencing Rule 33-8644."
"Oil still above $61.00 barrel, OXY making lots of FCF!!!!!!"
"• Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY): Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.15 beats by $0.18; GAAP EPS of -$0.36 misses by $0.03. • Revenue of $5.48B (-15.2% Y/Y) beats by $500M. • Cash flow from continuing operations of $0.8B and cash flow from continuing operations before working capital of $2.1B vs. consensus of $1.79B. • Production of 1,117 Mboed from continuing operations, vs. consensus of 1119.3 Mboe/d (guided 1,085-1,115 Mboe/d)."
"If oil gets a short term move higher Monday it could help OXY's stock price if they miss after the bell , I just wish they would announce early before the bell. After the bell gives people longer to look at the earnings before the start of trading on Tuesday plus a chance to get Colonial back up and running even at a reduced rate."

"Strong finish, fighting hard to break 100 MA"
OXY INCREASE 20 pence after loosing 95% of its value wow yeah rally :)
Tagging June low (before that massive leg up) should trigger a spike up and a gradual rise up to 28 -30...however if it break 12.69-12.70 might go all the way down to test March low with first next stop 11.50...am more incline to see it rising from here
Just wait till WTI hits $50 by end of month
Did Buffett's purchase of OXY shares just call the Bottom in the oils ? I like Exxon's safety and dividend....

"Oil futures saw mixed trading on Tuesday, with expectations of weaker energy demand from India, which has seen a surge in COVID-19 cases offset by support from a halt to crude exports from a Libyan port and overall weakness in the U.S. dollar.The weaker dollar is helping to underpin oil, in addition to rising forecasts for the latest report on U.S. crude inventories to show a decline as the world’s largest consumer of oil, the U.S., reopens its economy, said Sophie Griffiths, a market analyst at Oanda.Still, risks remain, with the resurgence of COVID in India, the world’s third-largest importer of oil, “tighter lockdown restrictions could dent the near-term demand outlook for oil,” she said in a market update."
Yes I'm sure OXY's dividend will be back to where it was by year end and the stock will be back in the $50's. Right longs?
Fellow Board members : it may better serve everyone’s purposes here going forwards if some of us could stop taking a contrary view personally .If I talk about OXY I’m not talking about or insulting one of your family members .It’s a corporate business with shareholders - and a stock price - that has embarked on a totally different path than it appeared they were on say a year ago . I WAS a shareholder from 1985 to recently in 2019 - and I actively traded options on the Company the last 20 years . In fact it was my hands down FAVORITE .With the new direction OXY is headed in I’ve lost a lot here .Don’t take it personally if I think OXY is on the wrong road . Time will indeed tell . For the time being however - hands down - those who think this was a bad deal have plenty of evidence to back up their point of view .
Boom. Just like that!!! Yes!!!
"Ugggh, she has destroyed this company. What a ditz! I bailed on 2/3rds of my shares with nice losses @ about $53, but made the mistake of holding 1/3rd. Once I get rid of these shares I'm done with OXY for good. I thought they were on the path to reward shareholders, with fiscal common sense and a sustainable divy. They survived the last four years of low prices better than most smaller oil companies, then the board throws it all away and pizzes all over shareholders."
The Analyst that said $88 a month of so ago will prob come out and say......OOPS....... I MEANT $8.80... It was a Typo !
Folks: I based my purchase of OXY on 50 dollar oil. At 59 or 60 watch earnings. Very bullish and believe 55 to 57 for 2020. At these prices Andarko is very good deal. Dutch
OXY is at its lowest on the RSI in 5 months. She's going to bounce hard. Just need oil to make a bullish move off the $42's.

"People people people. Is OXY losing money? At $65? At $50? It’s not what it did in Q1, it’s what’s guided for Q2 and $65 oil. It’s what it will do next year. The chart is screaming that the next basing plateau is around $40. It’s where it wants to go. We will be there within 3 months. And I think it’s sooner rather than later. $70 oil and $80 oil screams FCF. $40 by August 15. And quite likely by July 1."

"""**** So many technical market traders here and so few people talking about the geology of the Permian and especially the anadarko and oxy assets in the Delaware basin. When you look at the Permian....... divided into the three sections.... virtually all of the acreage 4 oxy is in the Delaware basin which is the most prolific section of the Permian by far. being encircled or trapped by a ring of shallow ancient reefs, the Delaware basin is the deepest structure or holding multiple stack pay zones in the lower 48 states........ just pull up some screens you can see that wear oxy has its acreage is in the deepest part of that basin...... basically in The Sweet spot.... a review of the isopatches will clearly show this to be true. Chevron and others would be frothing at the mouth to own a chunk of that acreage that nobody can exploit as well as oxy and there CO2 injection system, where unlike most operators who are lucky to get 10% recovery or EUR, of OOIP......OXY will produce approximately 20%..... are twice the amount of EUR than other operators......... in the long run this will bring OXY hundreds of billions of dollars an additional revenue and profit....... not even adding in reserves DJ basin in Colorado or the GOM......

"I will be surprised if OXY can come out of this without filing for BK to reduce debt . Oil will keep going lower unless OPEC+ cuts again , if a vaccine is found tomorrow it will still be a year before there is a large enough supply . OXY needs oil in the mid to upper 40s ( 50s-60s is best for OXY to restart capx ). Third quarter will still show a loss and 4th may not be much better . New higher interest payments start next year . I hope against BK but really don't see a way around it right now and in no way can I believe management now. They will soon be backed up into a corner and have to do something , right now they are not helping."

Vicki Hollub says it's a great deal to buy Exxon but that she wants to pay cash so the disgruntled shareholders can't vote against it.

She also said she was will be giving Michael Wirth of Chevron (CVX) $1 billion not to bid against her and that she expects the deal to be accretive in 2075.

A cruise ship going around the world in 180 days in 2 months. Tickets were sold out in 24 hours. What does that tell you. Americans will take vacations this summer. Oil heading to $70. And with the walking corpse policy we could see oil at $80 this summer. Hold

"Not exactly sure why all the doom and gloom. The stock is solid. Debt is high but being restructured and paid. Q1 had assets in transition that were not finalized due to a rising oil cost meaning those assets were now worth more so the updated checks hadn’t cleared. Q2 will show the larger debt pay downs. On top of that you have high FCF that will be another increase over Q1. With current oil price of $63 (which its been all over 65+) we’re looking at a FCF for Q2 of about $2.1billion. Pare that with the asset sales and the debt load is going to start dropping quickly. Taking the div to .01 was a great move and hopefully they don’t budge that for a bit.With the drop in debt from Q2 they’ll start getting close to their investor grade status which will open the stock to more institutions. They were originally looking at 4Q21 profitability with $43 oil. We’re $20 higher. Wouldn’t be surprised if that’s moved to Q2. Chemical is starting to find its way with inflation and other costs driving up its value. Midstream should start being less a drain as the Permian is opened up. They can increase their production pretty significantly if they need. With oil in the $60+ range they’ll be turning on the tap. The stock is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. That’s all. Just because people are selling doesn’t mean much. The true value is still there. Large institutions doing sector wide sales hits everyone. The stock is down but it’s definitely worth more than where it’s at. The debt for the ANadarko acquisition is solidly being handled at these oil numbers (that includes Buffett’s 8%) and the asset value of the Permian fields gained though the acquisition. WTI during the bidding process of 2019 was around $52. While not the best negotiated deal OXY now has those fields with $60+ oil. There’s a lot to like here from my point of view. I’m not a knee-jerk kind of seller though. Plus you keep letting the Middle East heat up and you’re going to see what he price push $70. Vicki was very smart for the acquisition of anadarko. Darko was ranked 48th of 50 for their efficiency in drilling. Meanwhile Oxy has matured and refined their process taking it from $200/ft in 2015 to $135/ft now. So not only did they get the large asset grab that’s increased about 20% in value since they’ve also managed to DRASTICALLY increase their efficiency on that acreage. It was a great idea to acquire but Vicki was very poor in her execution. Since then the div has been cut, Icahn is on the board along with a couple others, the entire direction of the company has taken a turn due to Icahn pushing these decisions, and frankly without outside influencing factors (world wide virus, comet slamming into the planet, Joe Biden being an idiot) this company definitely is worth more than where it’s at. For the record I’m loading up on warrants as we speak. I predict $40+ in a year so long as OPEC doesn’t try to drown the world in oil again screwing us all."
"So a price war demolishes the price of crude. Wipes out most American shale companies. Oxy being hedged for break even at 55 a barrel survives. Being one of the last man standing, oxy steals market share. US government steps in to prop up US oil in order to avoid oversea dependence as the small guys get wiped out. Oxy recovers and becomes a leader once the price of oil rises. Thoughts?"

"There is a high probability that oil will remain in the 60-80 range. Two of the top exporters of oil and natural gas Saudi Arabia(42% GDP) and Russia(30% GDP) take a huge hit to their economies when prices/profits are down. The inverse relationship of cutting exports vs increase in prices favors the cuts. SA tried to flood the market and put U.S. oil companies out of business and it did not work, but resulted spending billions and billions of dollars of reserve funds. Patience in the oil sector is important."
That would take care of maturing debt for 2021 and part of 22...keep in mind even at these prices they can generate 4-6 billion in earnings ..no capex no dividend
The green new deal is oil...So many upgrades from ExxonMobil to Dozens of others....Hold your ground...
Interesting. You would think oil would be exploding. Down almost $10.00 from March highs!!! What a great buying opportunity.
"Occidental Petroleum, Feel The Power."
We will speed up free fall in OXY bankrupt shares in 2021.
"Thanks to the sellers, I have added.Oxy is a bargain, a cash machine at these oil price levels.I wonder who is selling at this ridicolous low level and with this huge leverage on rising oil prices."
"Funny Mehmet Sakir and Nicole are quite as crude futures rise, where are they shilling now since OXY is poised to jump as futures rise."
It will outperform other energy stocks for few days or weeks and then it will be in betwen 28 to 32.
Didn’t Cramer say sell sell sell..... so predictable that’s code for buy buy buy
"Cramer's friend's are buying oxy, which has alreadybeing discounted lots due to lower crude prices,Europe and the US are adjusting + vaccine = blue skies,and cold weather in December. Huge need for heat and comfort in cold days and nights."
where are all the dividend chasers
"Oxy and Cemvita, it’s science!!!"
To all you oil boys and oxy shareholders a day like this is sure nice after all the pain we have gone thru the past year .I lost my job at the start of the year because of low oil prices and covid . I love the industry and the people in it keep your chin up 2021 is going to be our year boys and girls
anyone adding today down over $2
I am down almost $100k but I've got diamond hands and I?? sticking around with you guys
we WILL see the 24s before it turns higher.. accept it....
"***** Since market is closed..... I took a little time to drill down (no pun intended) into some details of the geology in the Delaware basin where OXY holds most of their acreage. Looks like the best depth for horizontal drilling is in the first and second bone spring sands...... what porosity is about 12% what can go as high as 20 to 25%...... reservoir thickness is about 50 feet @ ideal depth for fracturing is approx. 6300 ft. and is made up of 40% limestone, and 29% each a sandstone and dolomite ..... with a large presence of quartz which makes it ideal for fracking....... as it is brittle enough to achieve good vertical cracks into the reservoir and source Rock.......... with 1st bone spring being moderately water/wet..... and 2nd bone spring being moderately oil/wet. Latest interesting estimate from USGS ..... is that the Delaware basin is holding 43 billion bbls of OOIP...... along with 18 TCF of associated NG. Of course the more they develop and drill the Delaware the estimates will probably rise as they already have in the last couple of years..... actually the latest estimate was about double from the one couple of years earlier.......FYI*****deepsub"
"To add some perspective to OXY valuation.....Enterprise value of $60BYou can buy Devon, Pioneer, Diamond, Concho, and Marathon for a combined EV of $60B. Total revenues $29B vs Oxy $23B. Total debt is $22B vs OXY $41BI don't see how anyone can look at numbers and say OXY is a good deal and can't go lower. The only play for OXY is you believe the assets are worth more than $60B. Buy a basket of the above 5 and your getting 30% more revenue and 50% less debt for the same valuation.If you think OXY is a buy I'd love to hear the rationale.........i expect crickets on this question!"
Oxy has decided to pay warrants dividend in cash ..a very Good signal to the market.
The CEO of OXY drives a hard bargain..A billion dollars to CVX an 8% loan for $10 billion dollars from WB....Maybe she should have read president Trumps book the Art of the Deal before she started throwing $$$ around.....JMHO
IMO stock price will likely tread water until the remainder (except Algeria) of the Total deal closes. Then gap up to low 50’s. Clipping coupons in the meantime. Notice the non-stop postings by the shorts about a dividend cut have ceased.
Sell Tesla and buy $XLE $OXY $ERX stop investing in bubble stocks. Buy real companies with real assets.
Shorts move out for your safety. Tommorrow will be a strong day! Have fun!
Any upward movement is an opportunity to short sell the stock. Of course dont forget to cover your short sell with call options around 16 per share like broker traders are doing. I will short the stock until traders stop short selling the stock
Watching this tumble from $18 to $14 before recovering to $15 broke my heart !!But still glad I didn’t sell @ $18Will open at this level up
"Guys, I need some honest opinions please. My average is 15.2 . Is there any chance of reaching 15.2 by in 2 months? I am seriously frustrated."
"lots of people being negative in OXY, I worked on OXY project, I can tell you that OXY is doing very well, this stock is super cheap to buy. After election is done, will fly back to $30 a share easily. do not to buy puts."
Oxy reports first week of May. This will give us 5 weeks to see how the company has improved with higher prices for oil. Oxy said they only needed $40 a barrel to make money.
Just a few months ago everyone was hoping that oil could reach an maintain 50-55 and at those levels oxy could thrive and now in typical daytrader fashion a hundred posts because oil moved down to 59 and 62 for brent to sell sell ....we could be back to normal oil fluctuations and if the new norm is above 50 oxy will thrive ...use their numbers ....they pump alot of oil for a not being a supermajor and sell alot of nat gas
XOP only down .50%. OXY down 7.75% MRO down less than 1% WTI up to $65.35/barrel
"Prob a huge mistake, but I’m out!"
Vicki has set back the woman's executive movement by 20 years. She makes a dèal and the core asset falls 20% and the interest rates nose dive after they borrow at 8%.
I WROTE HERE THAT OCCIDENTAL WILL CRASH AT 31.5 US DOLLARS AND SO FAR ITS DOWN 10%. IT WILL KEEP CRASHING BELOW 20 US DOLLARS IN 4 WEEKS. SO SELL YOUR WARRANTS AND SHARES AS THE STOCK APPROACHES TO 31.5 US DOLLARS.
Oxy is green company which is top of carbon capture use storage.
like I sad 11$ easily!!!
oil hits 65 this goes to 30+ simple as that
Stock Broker Employee trolls like Raje always recommends to buy Occidental shares. I can remember that he#$%$ was recommending to buy Occidental stock at 90 US Dollars. His aim is to convince you to hold until you loose all your money! If he is recommending you should run away!!!
Against the advice of posters in this forum except @Stefan I added to my position at $17.50 and $17.68 yesterday. Looking good for today so far. My break even point for the whole position is $27. I still think we will get there within the next 2 months.
As soon as a major asset sale is announced as promised ..multi billion ..it will be back to 44-46
Was wondering why OXY didn’t drop to 23 yesterday. It’s happening today. Haha…
"You have to face reality and that points to dismal 4Q results. Disappointed? Yes, the 4Q results are much worse than anyone expected. Am I selling? No. I expect oil to keep going higher and for OXY to improve their quarterly results substantially going forward. I will continue to increase my position on dips. Patience is really going to be a virtue with this thing."
The right with Liz will bring in a NEW PARTY MORE LIKE THE OLD PARTY so we are in great shape. The cult is on its last - LEGS OF LIES. Boolean
"Don't fret, the dividend will hold it up...oh wait, there virtually is none, I was thinking of the OXY of old. Paraphrase: Gecco, the price is 23.64, new low, 2 hours till closing, I advise you to take it."
Earnings?
"From Q3 19 to Q2 2020 debt reduced from 47.61 B to 38.49 B, asset sales combined with cash in hand and access to capital will be taking care of a lot of the debt....quarterly revenue was in the range of 5 to 6 B ( q2 2020 was an exception) as long as the wti trade between 40 and 50 we are good and OXY is a steal at 15 if you are a long term investor don’t miss that golden opportunity. Don’t listen to the day to day noise and negative people and comments. If u believe in oil trading above 40 going forward buy buy buy"
"I would like to know that why after 4 days the major brokerage analysts haven't released their stock ratings and price targets on the news wires? Usually they are jumping head over heals to get those ratings out, especially if the earnings report was ""so great""."
Better not hear #$%$ about their carbon capture and nothing on Dividends and shareholder value
"Carl didn’t understand the market, that’s why he bought 8 months before OXY bottom and seriously overpaid for the risk at the time. Now it’s a completely different animal. OPEC has a strong control of oil, we are exiting a year long shutdown, no wells have been drilled to replace lost production and congress has passed the point of no return in debasing the dollar relative to assets. OXY at 29 right now and we’ll see 59 this year."
Good news for all fellows. FDA just approved vaccine for emergency use.OXY and all other oil stocks already started Jerking knees.congratulations 
This is market correction. Folks are selling to capture the profits. Buy on the dips.
a must for OXY investors..
"OK all, the financials are one thing and Buffet is another. Buffet sold out which he has many followers. The reality is: that until Vicki is gone from this company the stock price is stagnant. This is what I understand from many analyst (Ramond James, JPM, B of A, Morgan Stanley...). Once Vicki is gone the price will appreciate. I been saying this for a long time and unfortunately I hold a lot of stock in this company. (:"
"in some companies directors are required to hold a certain dollar amount of shares, does anyone know if this is one of oxy's requirements? and of course they get some help to get there from the company?"
"A slightly down day today is not concerning to me. We have had a pretty good run in the last few weeks. A bit of consolidation and even profit taking from short term investors / day-traders is healthy. Fundamentals and trends of oil price is looking good and on solid grounds, which is the most important factor now. Stock prices and profit/FCF will follow oil prices upwards.It is quite possible that WTI needs to show steadiness for a few more weeks before cultivating stronger confidence in price recovery. OPEC+, especially SA have put a solid bottom support on oil prices, which itself is a major factor for the next couple of months. My horizon is for another year, possibly even longer and I am not worried a bit...unless oil crashes for some reason."
"Thanks to Icahn, OXY has avoided a disastrous decline yesterday. Right now, the market is pricing OXY for a takeover potential."
brb going long $rope
Hilarious
Let’s hope the market makers are done with selling off their inventory they picked up yesterday and this morning
anyone selling now?
"Last time oil was at this price, OXY was already at $30. LET’S GO OXY"
Waiting on May 10 report!
"Will it hold 25 for the last 30 minutes , I think it will have the normal Friday end of the day drop to around 24.60."
"You know what I find funny after following a few companies recently? If you compare balance sheets, fundamentals, and analysis. OXY is a pretty good bet. The biggest reason is the assets OXY holds, the future having to open, and the risk to reward is too good. As a person who heavily criticizes the current overall market price. Oxy still seems good."
It's funny how all the short VERMIN come out from under their rocks to talk smack after having gotten beaten like a red-headed stepchild for MONTHS.
Buy at 30/31 today ? Or wait
chart looks very good. it's finding support before the breakout. it should touch low 27 before heading back
Oil price is going up. Tomorrow $29 at least. Guys who paperhanded need to buy back for higher price.
"Bought Oxy in 2019 for it’s hefty dividend to supplement my retirement.Was forced to average down in March in hopes to save my retirement.Investing 100% of my ira money into Oxy.I aim at last at a good point to move out of Oxy, By far the worst investment experience in over 25 years.Even 2000, 2009.Good luck."
Option questions ; if you own calls that are adjusted for the distribution you will collect the distribution when you EXERCISE your options ( assuming you do )
Lol I think people got tired of selling
Bill Gates on 60 minutes talking up carbon capture...NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ...that Oxy and cvx are his partners in the best version of carbon capture ...this technology will create far far more investment excitement than electric cars....
Just close above 24 at least. That’s an achievement....
"WTI close to $40 again， if the market is good, OXY can jump to $24 again, do you still remember the recent 30% gain day ?"
Relax. We will be up Tomorrow!
"OPEC+ agreed to increase oil production gradually over the coming months, responding to both internal and external pressure to supply more crude to the recovering global economy.Saudi Arabia proposed the phased supply boost, which would include some easing of the kingdom’s voluntary extra 1 million barrel-a-day supply cut, delegates said, asking not to be named because the information wasn’t public. The group’s video conference was still continuing on Thursday as ministers hammered out the final details of the accord, they said."
If we finish less then 5% down it’s a good day lol
All I need is 30$ some time next year!!!
40 for Oxy...No posts about bank of america downgrading 4 oil stocks but upgrading xom and apa and making OXY their top pick..while I do not pay regard to analysts plenty do and it was a nice upgrade
Oil stocks are holding today despite oil sell off. With record people flying and driving for spring break we have a good chance of inventory draw downs tomorrow.
Holy cow... I hope that the months of pain will now turn into the years of joy. Congtz all~~~~ now to $40-50! and to the retirement!
Love my LPI and CPE. I cannot keep up. Retiring end of 2021. Take a look. CPE up 34%
"On Thursday, Occidental Petroleum earned a positive adjustment to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating, from 78 to 82"
@22 we can add more.
"Still haven't seen one major brokerage analyst upgrade or report on the major news wires. With such a ""great earnings report"" where the are they?"
Can’t figure what anyone sees as a positive in OXYs future ?
What will happen to OXY stock price when they get close to the Warrant price? Just curious if Oxy stays below the $22 or whatever price is set for the warrant or does the stock price plow over the warrant price?
This deal will be in business journals and reviews for years to come. Your children and grand children will study the poor judgement and tunnel vision which led to CEO and BOD colluding to sideline shareholders. The elitists protect themselves and drown the passengers.
17.50 new support I’m telling y’all
"An aggressive acquisition puts the dividend at riskOccidental Petroleum has one of the highest yielding dividends among oil producers at 7%. The company's yield has risen significantly this year due to a 25% decline in its stock price as a result of its controversial acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum.Occidental Petroleum wanted to buy Anadarko so badly that it outbid Chevron by $5 billion. That's on top of the near 40% premium Chevron offered for Anadarko. The company thus had to secure high-cost financing to pay for the cash-heavy $38 billion deal. That added a significant amount of debt to its balance sheet, which is weighing on its stock price.Given the added interest expenses, Occidental doesn't currently expect to generate enough free cash flow to cover its dividend until 2022. That's assuming oil prices don't slump, which would put its cash flow under even more pressure.Occidental is taking steps to reduce this financial burden by selling assets. It agreed to unload Anadarko's African assets in an $8.8 billion deal with French oil giant Total. It's also reportedly shopping its stake in Anadarko's former MLP, Western Midstream. If the company can get a good value for the $10 billion to $15 billion in assets it aims to sell, and oil prices cooperate, then the dividend should survive. However, if oil market conditions deteriorate and future asset sales don't move the needle, then it might need to cut the payout."
"as I succesfully predict the bottom of oil stocks last Friday, just a few days, WTI close to $42. If it can break $42, that will significantly benifit to whole oil industry. meaning we will have another or many rocky days like this Monday!"
"Oil won’t go to $70 and above and stay there long with COVID crushing India and flaring up in other Asian countries, OPEC needs to not increase when they meet in June"
WTI up over $1.00 and this went RED!!!!!!
ALL STOCK BROKERS IN LONDON EXPECT A FLASH CRASH IN ALL OCCIDENTAL STOCK SHARES. THE STOCK WILL CRASH 75% MORE IN THE NEXT 3 MONTHS TO BELOW 9 US DOLLARS SHARE PRICE

ahhh my warrents are still up thanks to last years discounts
Hi shorties
"Cool lol gonna be making alot of money on closing before MDW lol, criminal manipulation but I get to buy again, just saw 26.80 yesterday now the world is ending again before powell speaks, they do this everytime across the market on fed day, so boring just topping off my long calls all across the board."
"As I see it the problem with OXY, and all other stocks in the marketplace, is not the fundamentals of the company, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the covid-19 pandemic, or the uncertainty of the pace of recovery of the world economy. The problem that is clouding the market is the realization that we don't really know who is in charge in the current administration; the pace of wasteful government spending that has already occurred in the last two months; the likelihood that this wasteful spending will continue indefinitely for the next two years; and the uncertainty about the rate of increase in government taxation of businesses and individuals. With each passing day a new hairbrained proposal is floated out to the press and the investment public can only guess as to which silliness will become law..."
Feel sorry for people shorting oxy now that there is an agreement on the fiscal stimulus. The last time wti was 49 was March 2020; oxy was at around 40. Do the math. Two vaccines approved and more on the way including JNJ. No brainer. Longs do not sell. We will get short squeeze as they capitulate in the coming weeks.
More than $50 per barrel by the end of this year. OPEC is busting the sector. We're heading much higher. Investment banks and brokers are recommending investing in Energy. This is going to sky rocket soon after tax selling... Don't miss this train...
Bought 200 shares for around $12.50 and sold when they hit $22 because they slashed they’re dividends. Man I wish I held...
Is 40 out of the question by August if crude is selling in mid 40's?
what happened to Oxy today ? oil price not going up but Oxy going up good 5% and heavy volume also??
"Perhaps the best news was on the cash flow front. The company delivered more than $2.1 billion in cash from operations, although a large jump in receivables ballooned the working capital outflow. In the end, true free cash flow was more than $200 million, as compared to a slight cash burn in the year ago period. Throw in the asset sales that were completed during the period, and total cash rose by about $275 million, while the company also paid back $174 million in debt. Don't forget that at current prices, warrants could be exercised bringing in another $2.5 billion or so of cash."
I want more oxy at 24.5
I'm going full on socialism. Love it or not. I'm a dope with no clue what is going on so I'll just follow orders. Come on man. 100 days in and we are here. I don't have a clue where but we're here people.
Oxy is getting ready to pounce!
Just no news/momentum for this thing to move. Expecting a breakout on lackluster volume not going to happen
OXY was at $34/share the last time crude oil was at these prices. Add to your position before Santa's rally 
WE LEARNED THAT OXY BROKERS AND INVESTMENT BANK RELATED INDIAN CALL CENTRES ARE MARKETING OXY STOCK IN 125 INTERNET FORUMS LIKE YAHOO.
Back to $8
OPEC 100% in compliance. Covid chart improving. After earnings and solid guidance we start the journey to $35
"Common dividend, for the time being, just hit 8%."
"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"
"Excluding both interest expenses and payment to Warren, If OXY can rein in their operating expenses (operating, transportation, sg&A, and depreciation) to be at 70% of their revenues (similar to Q3 FY18) and maintain the current revenue level, then they should be able to earn ~$3.80/yr. At a PE ratio of 15, the stock should be $57. Right now, both operating and depreciation expenses are at 106%. I hope to hear a plan from management about both their operating and depreciation expenses going forward. Also equally important, how many more quarters will we expect anardarko's impairment charge? and is there a plan to reduce interest expense in the future and when will it materialize (Q419 $434 vs Q319 $96)? Good luck to us longs!"
"Hey, last year oxy took a combination and hit the canvass hard. Its financial situation was far more dire as recently as two quarters ago. Its got some work to do, but their financials are much improved. People will eventually see the value in this company."
"This is what you call a shake down... fear not longs, just getting the rats out of the cellar.."
Buy today for the big ex-dividend tomorrow.
Any news on the cash being received on those “cost less collars” management had in place. One would think with that cash and the savings from slashing the divy they could be buying back their debt at these distressed prices.
EIA reports a more than 3 million-barrel weekly decline in U.S. crude supplies. Like Chris stated last week's numbers was not a trend. Solid numbers
"TOTAL (TOT) wrote down $8 billion in assets, $7 billion of which was in Canada’s oil sands. Total also said that it conducted an assessment over its stranded asset risk, meaning with reserves beyond 20 years and high production costs. Canadian oil sands ran afoul of this test, and Total said it would no longer invest in oil sands. Bad for Canada and TOTAL but not so for OXY."

"From CLR earning call Q&A last week, which is also applicable to OXY and most other oil companies: There was a question about tax rate and the answer was: CLR has amassed enough paper loss carry forward such that they don't expect to pay tax for the next 5-7 years (with the usual caveat of future tax code changes).Isn't this amazing? FCF becomes Tax-Free-Cash-Flow for the next 5-7 years."
Getting my Oxy party on!
Intuitions will be transferring funds from tech to value positions in the next couple quarters. Stay strong long. It's a grind but it will be sweet one.
"NEXTERA has the same volumes as OXY and for some reason its being touted as an alternative energy co....yet they have coal plants and other fossil fuel plants....ITS MARKET CAP IS 4 TIMES OXY,,yes its not an oil company but is shows what values investors are slapping on any company that appears to be eco friendly....direct air carbon capture will help valuations as more hype builds"
buy buy buy!
". The warrants will have a term of seven years and Occidental expects to list the warrants on The New York Stock Exchange.Co is also increasing the maximum aggregate purchase price of Notes it will accept for purchase, excluding accrued but unpaid interest from the previously announced amount of $1,500 million to $2,000 million."
Two days ago WTI hit a high of $66.97/barrel and now $61.84/barrel for a decline of $5.13/barrel courtesy of Obiden & Company!!!!!
Carbon capture is too easy to deploy and it will have the quickest affect. When the administration starts to bring this up in a big way very soon Oxy will more 10-15 per share from this alone. Think about it one plant does more than every tesla car on the road ..I am guessing but I bet very very soon the govt will announcem major plans for major carbon capture plants ...
OXY hit relative strength index of 80+ right before its most recent run up. I’ve been pumping Nordstrom and it just hit it today. OXY was around $19 when it hit 80+. Mark this post.
"It will be interesting to see if it can continue with the buying of the last hour on Friday and Monday. If it moves higher then it may had found the bottom on this drop. One day doesn't mean the drop is over needs to expand on the rise , would be nice to see a couple of good up ( say 3%+ ) days on above average volume."
four of the largest most well respected companies own about 40%...rest easy they will maximize their value...just a move to 23 is about 50% and as you remember just about a month ago it shot to 23 on asset sale talks..so more than likely that will be a good target in the next 60 days
ya gotta love the shorts.. trying their best to scare people on these boards.. what they don't get.. there are not enough shares held by the people that post here... that it would or even could make a difference on a stock that can trade 15mil shares in a day. my favorite.. it could go to the 30's because of this deal.. the street has already cooked in 10 points because of the deal.. yeah... it could drop some more.. but you think a stock that was 67 just because the street doesn't like a deal with buffet is going to tank this thing down 37 points? get out of the market... you're not smart enough to invest.
This drop any further and I am selling my left kidney to buy as many calls on this as I can
I was expecting a decent bounce back today

(OXY)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor Occidental Petroleum (OXY) is downgraded to Market Perform from Outperform with a $56 price target, cut from $75, at Wells Fargo as ""Anadarko (in)digestion begins.""Wells believes the merger delivers modest and more manageable production growth, declining capital intensity with time and likely a lesser corporate annual decline rate, while EBITDA and cash flow accretion should occur along with an improved free cash flow yield.But the acquisition also adds ""significant EPS dilution,"" substantial leverage metrics, reduced returns on equity and capital employed and lower dividend payout to common shareholders as a percentage of EBITDA, the firm says."

I bought more oxy put options. Already in profit today like everyday
I expect the oil demand to normalize to Pre-Covid once the restrictions are gone and airline traffic is back to norm. Does anyone have any idea how quickly OXY can increase its production to align with the demand that is about to explode once the covid is gone?

"OXY Earnings tomorrow : Whether they miss or beat does not matter much. What matters most is what they are going to say about their cash flow for Q2 and whole of 2021. Those things should be good.

It is time to hold this stock for long term and not worry about day to day fluctuations. Stay long and strong."
"Carl Icahn is not a fan of Hollub's leadership. She overpaid for Anadarko, probably the worst deal in history. Warren Buffet exploited her plain and simple.

Lets hope Hollub gets the boot and gets replaced by someone who understands financials and business"

"There is a glut of oil on the world market NOW and its going to be much worse, next year, regardless of china , trade, etc......Oxy didn't take a chance because it paid no attention to next year's oil surplus piling up at cushing and at overseas terminals in saudi arabia.......DEBT IS DEBT AND VICKI AND PALS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SERVICE THAT IMMENSE DEBT with oil prices dropping lower ......THE DIVIDEND IS NOT SAFE.......Today,Macy's once the king of retail, has seen it's tock drop by almost half and wall street is predicting the imminent reduction of its now 9.8% dividend.....Looks great on paper but Macy's and Oxy may have different problems but DIVIDENDS ARE NOT SAFE.......I remember GM constantly lying to its shareholders while its dividend was constant......It went bellyup and the dividend disappeared.....So did the stock value for millions of investors who didn't jump off a sinking ship.....Oxy has a good chance of becoming another sinking ship......NO DIVIDEND IS SAFE AND OIL ISSUES ARE BIG THINGS NOW.......Anadarko was already dropping big time when Vicki stepped up to the plate for them......The permian is loaded with oil but DEBT is something low oil prices cannot escape.....Gas prices are also at near record lows, another issue .....The world is changing and Vicki paid no attention to anything out there....Worst of all will be the low prices VICKI will get for her so called reduction in debt.....EVERYONE OUT THERE, WARREN INCLUDED, knows she is desperate to UNLOAD......Her words at the last conference, so soothing to the locals, will do nothing to raise the prices she will be forced to take as she unloads assets.....HUGE DEBT will remain........"

"The chances of OXY going bankrupt is possible, but note this. Chapter 7 bankruptcy is complete failure and usually is the last last resort. Chapter 11 is only filed if the company sees the end of the tunnel. Until a vaccine comes out and oil jumps up, chapter 11 won’t be an option."
I heard about OXY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Once India Covid numbers go down, OXY will skyrocket to another galaxy this summer. If you were shareholders from last year, you should know that OXY does not take any short-cut like those EV and crypto sectors. Its share price goes up with its fundamental, the perfect oil price level, healthy FCF, etc. Zero short cut. The most honest human beings = OXY shareholders."
I couldn't help adding a buttload of OXY warrants today. A $4 bet that this puppy will be valued at more than $26 over the next 7 years. Like taking candy from a baby.

Natural gas up 70% last 6 months
"Ox is the cheapest oil stock, debt issue will be solved. Once oil recovers oxy will quadrouble."
Unbelievable. Chart is very bearish now...
With US producers putting well back into production and now the talk of OPEC+ starting to reduce the cuts they made OXY will be stuck where it has been trading earlier this year probably in a range between 13 and 20 with some lower drops and maybe a few higher jumps. Second quarter's earning will be bad in a couple of weeks and until they can increase CAPx production will drop some . Losing the hedge in 6 months will hurt with the increase in interest payments on new debt and paying Buffett in stock will increase number of share out. They do not need any bad news in the 3rd or 4th quarter ( and really need some asset sales ) to try to get cash flow going for CAPx . The other possibility is to issue some new shares that were approved during the last vote to help with cash.
"Imo, todays action was a normal response from this last year. Movement in futures has a massive adverse effect. But, surprise, surprise, a floor has been put in. Now, get $60 oil by Q2/CC and where is this SP? I'm seeing a run to $40. That puts the Warrants around $28-$30. And I might just be conservative."
Seems the market was hoping for better dividend news...
"Longs, I myself looking to summer. The trend is positive. Road will still be bumpy next 2 weeks then after earnings I expect a smooth sail to $40. I"

"Question. I have about 1000 shares of OXY and will want to cast my vote next year. I own shares purchased through TD Ameritrade...so how do I vote? I have not gotten any of the Icahn letters, so think I am out of the loop for communications."
"well, if anyone listened to the CC, apparently agencies use high 40s instead of current WTI. maybe it explains why oxy is not moving with WTI""Yes. It's around the $50 range. And if you look at the price decks that are being used by a lot of our agencies, they are in the high-40s right now they look to close to $50. They're not – so they don't move their price decks with the current environment of being in the mid- to low 60s."""
"Oxy is the biggest cashmachine and with the actual oil prices oxy stock price should be at 50 usd.From my point of view is oxy the biggest winner of the rising oil prices , hence the revival should be much bigger than other companies.For me a no brainer…word of Carl Icahn."
Best way not to get disappointed is set the target price to 20 or lower..... That gives peace of mind...
"It?s hard to take most of the comments serious on this board. At the end of October OXY was 8 something. It ran over 20.Wah wah wah, they like tech better, on and on with #$%$ Like this ran to from 8 to 20. It will move from where it is now to $30.Geez!"
Pure manipulation!WTI $ is printing money for OXY!
"***** L@@K @ APA + DVN.....OXY is weathering the storm rather well....... they told me to cheer up---things could be worse---so I cheered up--- and sure enough, things got worse.........*****deepsub"
"Buffet selling does not effect the price of oil or natural gas, but it is a psychological hit which effects the lemmings who panic and sell. The other institutions reporting so far have added shares. Nothing has changed for Oxy or crude and gas which is the long game."
"So I spent Friday travelling and when I got to my destination I found out that a ""Good Till Cancelled"" order to buy OXY at $25.30 that I did not think would be good any time soon got executed. It is a good thing that I was away since if I had been at work I might not have held on. My sincere thanks to whoever sold me the shares."

Great buying opportunity today! Still time to get in before we see $40+. Congrats to all who are able to buy.
WTI’s going to bust through $65 
I think Carl knew something and that is why he sold a bunch of share.
"This is where people will just have different ideas. Even if Iran and the U.S. deal goes through, 1) we don't know when it will take place. The news today said there are still number of unresolved issues 2) Not only that, Iran is already exporting their oil cheaply and illegally. I would like emphasize the word ""cheaply"" 3) I think it is already priced in at least partially. We all knew that the nuclear deal will eventually takes place. Invest safely."
oil is up over $0.50 a barrel and this stock is going down does that make any sense
"API shows a build of 2 million , they were looking for a draw of 3.7 million . Will have to see if EIA shows the same tomorrow and look at products demand."
"Brent crude was up 29 cents, or 0.7%, at $41.25 a barrel at 0825 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose 17 cents, or 0.4%, to $38.55 a barrel."
oil at 64 and this would be a 26.50 stock
"Just warming up guys, wait till OXY announces an insane earnings report, wait till OXY announces lenders lined up begging to lend them at rates giving a huge discount to today’s rates, wait till they announce huge windfalls as they sell assets at much higher than anticipated prices, wait till ratings agencies up OXY’s credit, wait till OPEC is pressured to uncap what they’re holding back and everyone’s surprised we are still short of supply and even the green new deal begs oil to drill before high prices threaten the rest of the economy."
"Not interested in daily fluctuation. By this time next year, we will be doubled or tripled from here. Relax and enjoy the ride LONG!!!"
This one wants 30 by Friday
OXY is s 65 USD stock. I am sure big oil will buy oxy. OXY is a pearl among all oil companies and a strong cash machine. The stock will rise to 50 until endof january.

"Wonder what is the % of shorts. The higher the %, we may see a similar boost like TSLA. What a joke TSLA making more money by selling its shares. Good business. All they need is a printer that can print share certificates + news release with hope and dream."
"One thing that could be bad or good is with OPEC+ agreement oil prices should stay pretty steady ( no negative oil or 100.00 oil ) all next year if demand comes back slowly like most think . They cut 7.7 million a day and if the agreement stands will only increase 500,000 per day every month so it will take just over a year to bring their cut level to zero . With some countries not having a limit , a little cheating by some members and new oil coming online the price of oil should not jump and if demand increase the price should not drop much . If it does oil should stay in the 40-50 dollar range ( with some bumps higher and lower ) and most companies should be able to make a small profit , OXY's only problem will be the interest payments and Buffett's dividend. So capx will be slow to come back and the dividend will stay low but hopefully the stock price will climb into the 20s. Of course any new virus ( or vaccine not working ) , oil war or any conflict in the World ( Iran , NK , or others ) could change everything."
"Once the Total deal is complete for the Mozambique Asset that will be roughly 9B in the Bank. Buffet can be paid off easily, Smooth sailing from there, so much Negativity on this site like there trying to scare the price lower must be a bunch of shorts trying to manipulate (Hilarious)."
WTI now a $65.72 a barrel and OXY is down .92%!!! Something is really wrong with this picture?????
1.4 million barrels per day at 56..break even is 40 including the dividend...so 126 million barrels in the quarter with an 16 per barrel...Very nice could be an extra 2 billion in income in ONE QUARTER...yes there wlll be acquisition charges but the underlying is very very strong
"$CPE $CDEV $XOM $MRO $OXY On a day such as this where oil's being manipulated down another -5%, our oil equities are remaining strong. Even though WTI prices have tanked nearly $10 from the high of $68 a few weeks ago, we've held strong near prices in designated ranges -- why is that? Because we're ALL still undervalued, and sharks know it.All of our oilers are profitting MORE than enough at WTI anywhere above $55, let alone even in the $60s. Let me give a soft reminder of 5Y historical price history weighted against WTI prices for each ticker:On Dec 2nd, 2016, the prices for each ticker were as follows:$CPE 172.40 (17.24 pre-RS)$CDEV 18.06$MRO 18.20$OXY 70.85$XOM 87.04Likewise, on that date on Dec 2nd, 2016, Crude WTI prices closed at a mere $51.68 per barrel.Yet, all of these tickers are way lower than those prices despite much higher sentiment and WTI prices. So, one word: UNDERVALUED. What's inevitable, we know, is that the world WILL open back up -- the only matter is when. And with projections for WTI prices doubling in the next year, do the math -- we'll be hitting MUCH higher than those previous highs. LOAD!"
"Yesterday was an over reaction. Back to normal today. Back over $20. Only thing that worries me short term is EIA numbers to be released tomorrow. Last week we had a massive increase in oil supply. 15 million barrels. Congress under pressure to pass stimulus before they leave for the holidays. Moderna vaccine to be approved end of week. And people are getting vaccinated. Pfizer is a 2 doze injection. Means numbers of covid=19 infections will be cut by half in March. Yesterday was D day for our country, Beginning of the end. If you bought more yesterday I say congratulations. Patience. OXY going much higher"
oxy lagging as usual. xom is already bouncing up
Forget about dividend.. Do you guys know that with current fcf alone they should be able to pay off their entire debt within 8 years.
I'll tell you what will happen with Vicki. They will announce she's going to retire and she'll get a gigantic golden parachute of $100 million or so while the long term common shareholder got destroyed. This kind of CEO abuse of shareholders really makes me mad.
We are still waiting on an OPEC decision.
I think the current down trend is probably due to Buffet selling his shares from the dividend stocks he received.
Wow. I hope EIA agree's with API. 7.7m down.
CRASH CRASH CRASH
you really think we will ever see 30's again ? ever ?
"Vanguard, dodge, icahn and blackrock own about 40% of the whole company...more than likely they average cost is much much higher...so do you really think that they are not all over this..they could have sold this for parts and if at weakened levels got us about 50% more ...however because of economies of scale they are probably holding out for oil to move another 5 and this company can earn enough to justify a stock price of 30 plus...many of their assets have been depreciated on their return but have significant value ..so I wish things would move much faster ...the first asset sale announcement will move this over 20 with wti holding or moving up and when oil moves more there will be further gains..."
*****crude making a nice move this morning..... great way to end the week!!!*****deepsub
Profit taking drops WTI below $66.00 a barrel!!!!!
"At some point this thing grabs the elevator and goes up so fast your going to want to hold mommy’s hand. 80 a share company with crude at these prices but as I pointed out before, good chance oil goes above 100 and stays there for a long time. Then the worst part of OXY making all time new highs will be Vicki getting credit for buying a anadarko at those prices. Nothing wrong with buying Anadarko, just not at those prices at that time."
"Folks here is another risk here with OXY . And that is a technical default based in violation of loan or bond covenants . These typically have requirements such as cash on hand , net worth / book value , cash flow , EBITA , or meeting a certain ratio . While I believe OXY can meet its obligations for the rest of 2020 I’m not confident that it can avoid a technical default ."
Huge rally tomorrow - I sold today.
"wow !!! so perfect storms: Dow almost 600 points, wti down 1%, big funds so happy to buy in oxy at good prices ...what a big advantages for big guys...so much manipulation!"
anyone able to see the short interest?
if big oil and other shale companies are up. this stinks of pure manipulation
"Today’s drop in $GME & yesterday’s spike in $TSLA is confirmation of the Tech bubble. When stocks separate from their fundamentals to this degree, it’s time to get out. The rotation to real undervalued companies (with real assets & cashflow) like $OXY $XOM & $CVX will continue."

"Today, CNBC Cranmer recommended holding OXY. He expects it to go to $33. But sell long term because current admin is anti fossil fuel."
I'm holding strong... but too strong lol. Bought some on margin in the dip will see what happens.
$50 OXY in 12 months. US returns to Paris accord and slows US oil production + economies start to ramp up + planes fly + shipping resumes + OPEC in control of pricing + oil surplus is gone. $80/bl oil
We found the bottom. From here it will go up again. Huge buy walls.
It appears that Oxy has more infrastructure for carbon capture than xom..pipelines and other
"I have gone through that fintel list below and only iShare S&P ETF holds 312,629 OXY shares, which can be easily absorbed by OXY's daily volume. Other than this, I don't see any ETF/Mutual fund/etc with S&P 100 tag. No Panic."
Nothing goes up in a straight line. Patience. Over $20 by end of week
WTI above $40. Good!
"You have to go back to April to find three days in a row with less volume than the last three days , July had three that were close to these. Have to see if this is a new trend of lower volume and maybe a more stable price to help set a base and possible bring in new buyers."
What should I do? I am so frustrated. Always fear selling at a bottom but there is no bottom here.
There is significant short interest here that could unwind if oil & the market both continue to climb in the short term .
"Just the beginning, wait for the covering to start."

HOW DOES THE REPORT LOOK
TODAY IS ANOTHER RED CRASH DAY FOR OCCIDENTAL OIL AND OTHER BROKER FIXED OIL STOCKS LIKE SHELL BP MARATHON OIL CHEVRON
"IMO, Oxy will not go bankrupt but there's a highly chance that it will be a single digit unless the situation improves. We all question why Vickie went to Warren for help with a high interest rate. It's because she knows Warren has deep pocket. Since he's the preferred shareholders, he stands to lose a lot if Oxy goes bankrupt. Preferred shareholders is just one level above CS. Warren is now invested $10 bil in PS and close to $1 bil in CS, he will more than likely give OXY money in exchange for very low CS conversion price (just like BAC). The pain is plentiful in the road ahead. I don't see any good news in the horizon for OXY price to go up unless these two things happen - 1) Corona dies down and China is back in production and hence increase in supply 2) Both of these two egotistical guys will sit down on the table to have a grown-up conversation. On top of that, you will have short term investors who got in at this low price but will do a quick hit-and-run because they see how volatile OXY is."
pre market volume higher than average
"Right now I do not think there is a rush to buy now not until some better news and earnings come out . Unless oil jumps there is more down pressure on the stock than upward pressure . No one know where the bottom is right now it is all guess . Wait and see earnings and that the dividend is safe , if dividend is cut the price will tumble. It is not a bad price to get in if some of the unknown were know but now a big gamble.I am in higher but have not tried to cost average down yet plan to hold for a year or more if outlook improves."
"How are the reducing cost structure.. according to Vicki.. reduced drilling costs by $200 a ft to $130 a ft for global drilling GLOBALLY, through oxy drilling dynamics, since 2015 to present. Seems they are leading the pack as the Low cost leader. Improvement 14 percent from 2019 and 4 percent this year. Still setting records from completion side, number of fracs in 24 hours still improving. Team working on sub surface expertise, vicki is definitely an engineer lol.."

I read the letter but what does Icahn propose to do? At this point he would just blow up what is left of the 'new' company. I don't see that being a good thing for us.
Take a look at the price of Chevron and OXY before the APC battle began . Now fast forward to today . It’s pretty clear that some of the BEST deals are the ones you don’t make .
"France Total sees a shortfall of supply 10 million barrels between now and end of 2022. I agree 100%. Most oil cut CAPEC by 30%. And Biden policy toward oil. In my morning post I said expect a 10 million draw in spring. Here we go Total just confirmed my statement. Do not pay attention to incompetent oil analysts, This is Total. One of the biggest. Have a great evening all"
Oil over 50. I wouldn't image that when I bought the stock last year. I expected it in 2022 to happen. Really interesting to read those comments comming from guys heard about oxy recently.
"last year oil hung in the 50s in the third quarter..and they are projecting for them to lose almost 1$ per share next quarter...this q is a pass for every company....so right now operationally they have 340,000 barrels at 41 plus ten for the hedge...they also have about 900k barrels at a blended price of wti and brent of about 41...break even is about 31 if oil holds or improves they should be able to breakeven with healthy ebita even at these prices ..and that not accounting for synergy improvements"
This is too cheap. Period. Just bought in for first time for a long term hold. No way this isn't substantially higher by next year plus you get 7%. No brainer at this level.
"Btw market makers are getting desperate trying to find shares. It’s showing on my platform, the bid ask is so disproportionate"
OXY just downgraded to sell/avoid people. Be careful.
"Though steadying of WTI price, OPEC+ coming together has done a world of good to OXY and other oil stocks in general, I think CLR announcing redemption of 2022 notes with cash was a major confidence booster today. CLR is confident enough in its cash position as well as future cash position to buy back its debt. In first half of next year, we can expect OXY to announce reduction of debt, positive cash flow, and some good asset sales. As cash flow remains strong, as I fully expect, debt burden will seem much less daunting. As long as vaccine stays on track and world starts to move again, oil demand will increase. A case in point, this Thankgiving, road traffic was only 5% lower than last year!!!"
"OXY is heading down to 20-21 level until earning announcement and will double up from there. I'm keeping all my shares and warrants, will be buying more at that level."
The way this trades at times it would seem that it has no connection with oil prices.
"oil at 65, if it stays this goes to 40, if oil hits 70+ this hits 45+"
"unfortunately, I bought in at today's near high of 14.22. However, I hedged with shorting United because I feel like there is a lot more room to fall in that sector as oil prices still haven't gone past $30. Any thoughts on a Buffet Icahn battle that would drive this higher tomorrow?"

"EIA, US crude inventory down by 9.9 million barrels. Wow"
"Carl sold because he knew it would be awhile for OXY to reduce debt and pay a Dividend again, he could put his money to work somewhere else and come back later with insider info and buy again"
A big short squeeze can be expected with current developments. Especially if some institutional investors will be buying this week. Life is getting back to normal much faster than many thought it would. Combined with historical production cuts and additional voluntary cuts by some OPEC countries (incl. Saudi) oil prices might keep recovering for a while. That increases the value of assets owned by OXY. Probability of finding a buyer for some assets will be higher.
"Buffett, Carl all big INVESTORS LEFT OCCIDENTAL. WHY? WHY IS IT ONLY THE BROKER EMPLOYED TROLLS THAT ARE MARKETING THIS DODGY OIL STOCK. BECAUSE OIL STOCK BROKERS MANIPULATE STOCK, OIL STOCK PRICES ARE PRICE CAPPED AT CEILING. OXY HAS SHARE PRICE CAP AT 31.5 US DOLLARS"
"Early March, oil hit $68. OXY was at $32.52. Warrants were at $16. Weakness hit the oil market. To be fair, that runup was spellbinding. Profits needed to be taken. OIL sat at $60 for about a month. In 2 weeks the numbers come out. The timing corelates with an increase in consumption and I foresee a quick rise back to March highs and a blow by as well. Thats my short term opinion. But, long term? OXY goes back to $60 easy enough within 18 months. That makes the Warrants a $40-$45 PT. Anything under $11 is a 4 bagger next year IMO. Is it too much to hope for, that under this scenario, that I can retire early by eoy 2022? Can the economy be robust for 18 more months?"
Hopefully OXY holds 25+ in this short week...

That bodes ill for producers locked into contracts with suppliers, as the daily price they earn for their crude moves with the broader market.Fast depleting storage is still a major issue against a backdrop of unprecedented demand destruction from the coronavirus pandemic, and these could pressure prices below zero fast."
"I invested in a lot of shares for diversity. Shares like Tesla, Shopify, AMD, Boeing, Etsy, Pinterest, Zoom and GME since 2 months. But OXY is my longterm play for 10-20 years. I bought it for the dividends. I'm sure they will pay there debt and turn back to the old dividend of 0,78 cent or more. After Anadarko company is much larger and has more income. We will see the new market cap after corona is over and debts are payed. The unlucky side is they bought Anadarko in 2019 and we faced corona in 2020 and right after oil price collapsed."
I received 190 share of OXYWS - Could someone explain this - (DISTRIBUTION SPINOFF FROM:(OXY ) OCCIDENTAL PETE CORP WTS EXP 08/03/2027 (Cash)
That sell off in WTI did not last long did it? It is now back above $46 a barrel.
This weeks refinery movement will be skewed. But the catch up to replenish fuel stations is going to be equally skewed. Bottom line… we will catch up in 2-3 weeks and be entering June with serious pick up in consumption
So wti goes up .50-1 everyday and oil stocks arent allowed to go up on their own? lol interesting
"Expected. little pause as the market worries about lockdown in California. I expect the rally to resume next 2 days. Stimulus to pass by Christmas, vaccine approval in days and GS just stated that economy in 2021 will expand by 5.3%. Huge. I stick to my prediction OXY easy double from here"
Hi oil is down why all oil stock up today please explain me thanks
"OPEC+ meeting next week , vaccine excitement slowing down , runoffs in Georgia , OXY needs some good news to drive thru the 16.50-17.50 resistance and I really don't see in coming yet. OPEC+ will probably announce an increase coming , no reason not too with jump in oil prices and vaccines. If the Demos win both seats in the runoffs it will opens the door for major changes the left wants. Tomorrow will be a low volume day so watch out !"
Sell order at $35
"Headline of the week: ""Buffett's Taking More Oxy Stock, So Maybe You Shouldn't""No, no, buy more!"
Its nice to get an upgrade BUT I have issues with the balance sheet (Debt) and the payment for Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. In my opinion there should not be any bonus paid to Vicki for 2019 performance. Her deal without a vote by the shareholders was very concerning and it has not paid off well so far. This upgrade raised the price target from $51 to $59. This price is weel below what the price was before the deal. I have been long on this company for a long time (I have many shares and have owned them well before the APC deal). I hope the best for this company and hope the analyst community will continue to raise its stock price outlook.
! What the hell happened to the rally in the sector??
#$%$!! Making billions of dollars every quarter?How is this company bankrupt?#$%$ MIKE? If that your real NAME!DONKEY!
Shorts like Mehmet
"That SP100 delisting don't matter #$%$ If it was SP500 then I get it. It might matter a bit. I highly recommend people to load up on that 2027 warrants tomorrow if their value goes down more than by 5%. WTI is going up higher than 1.0% now as well as Brent. I am confident that the stock value and warrant value will bounce back tomorrow. Hell even natural gas is going up. Stimulus, instability in the middle east, vaccine, reopening... not one analyst believe that we will have lower wti next year. Goldman Sach has always been right about the oil price and they still believe WTI will be at around $60 range which I believe is a highly likely scenario. If I were to give you guys a little hint, you know when we had partial reopening up in June onwards and we had huge negative inventory? like continuous -3 million barrels? We didn't even have airlines flying and we had that."
"Serious profit taking going on right now, dropping quickly."
"Thu, April 22, 2021, 8:11 PMBy Shrutee Sarkar and Rahul KarunakarBENGALURU (Reuters) - The global economy will recover this year from its coronavirus slump at a pace not seen since the 1970s as strong momentum builds in most major economies, according to Reuters polls of over 500 economists.But 2021 growth views for 55% of 44 economies polled on were upgraded from three months ago, led by the U.S. economy - which was predicted to mark the fastest annual expansion since 1984 - and China, set to return to pre-crisis levels this year.""A synchronised global economic recovery is underway, notwithstanding the continuing battle against COVID-19.

"Consider the lack of sellers and those weak hands who have sold, this is gonna get squeezed so bad"
Its on the verge of popping. Oils wedge is at the inflexion point. Every day is higher lows. Best to buy in After/pre market.
"It’s been consolidating in the 50’s for months with many (including myself) picking up more shares with a lifelong 6% yield (and growing). Thank you sir can I buy another? The share price will be fine, with every earnings beat putting pressure on the shorts. One more earnings for the books, congratulations to all longs!"
"OXY down, oil up. OXY Downgraded to sell/avoid. Be careful."
U BUY THIS HERE....look at MACD and especially money flow - such things as On Balance Volume...NO CONFIRMATION OF THIS DROP and you will see a sudden sharp reversal UP later.... Boolean
Just got 126 more shares at 25.31not letting it go until covid is in the history books nowhere else!
***** Time for the afternoon leg----HIGHER---- we need to see at least double volume from this point to the end of the trading day.....*****deepsub
very interesting piece in the new yorker citing oxy will be big in co2 REDUCING technology. great perspective. and even if this wont fly it will take years to achieve a world w/o oil. .. great buy imo... wait and see it go to 40 or 50 within 12 months. just my 2 cents though.
"In today’s oil environment, APC would be trading around 28.00. APC typically traded around 20% higher than APA. In short, Hollub overpaid by 26 billion and is paying 2 billion a year for this privilege."
strong close today. Could see test 15.20 tomorrow
"Insider Marcia Backus, SVP & CCO, bought 2170 warrants @ $2.98 in the last week."
OXY keeps going up ... great sign for tomorrows report
Over 53000 shares around $ 21 in the past two months. Up 47% and 536k profit. What happen to all the shorts?
Oxy was a no brainer short due to the expectations for tax loss selling. Now that is ending expect a gap up into the mid 40’s.
SHORTING ALL OIL STOCKS OCCIDENTAL SHELL BP WHATEVER I CAN FIND
"While the kids are playing investor with failing companies like $GME, $BB and $NOK, the adults have been slowly adding to our positions in $XLE and $OXY.For those who are too young to understand, these are businesses with assets who sell their products for money. After the bills are paid, the remaining money is used to reinvest to make more money and return a portion to shareholders.Sure, we need to go green but I’ll bet you drive a car that uses gasoline or heat your home with Natural Gas or heating oil. We will need oil and gas forever. The population will grow and more will be needed.This is called investing like an adult. Not following unrealistic expectations of small companies like $TSLA others."
"API # ..... forecast was for a drop in inventory of over 3 million barrels, +-----------and they are showing a drawdown in crude supplies of approximately 8 1/2 million barrels... SURPRISE SURPRISE"
The miss shouldn't have come as a surprise. Will be interesting to see how the stock trades tomorrow. So far after hours trading doesn't indicate much of a difference from today's action.
"Dividend ex day Next Wed, so $.79 there, oil hanging in close $48 now and close to driving season.OPEC meeting today so this could kick in some oil stocks if they get the 1 million up more Think $55 is there Bottom Brentgoal with wishes of $60 for year average.Watched an Arab TV program and they were talking 2 area million a day cuts needed the first half of year.OXY gets a good bit of Brent pricing oil also and with hedges we have to be looking at $53 or so at present prices. Just opinion guys and gals..... hoping by next Qtr report we are at least $38 if not $40's."
He said positive report tomorrow. Might reach $18 today
Bought more
