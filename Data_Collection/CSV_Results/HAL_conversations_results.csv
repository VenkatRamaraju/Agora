A build in crude inventories pushes commodity prices down and HAL goes down with it.....except Brent just went positive and WTI halved the loss from this morning.

"This article from Motley Fool is probably the most level headed assessment which I have seen yet. It seems to be mostly true. Even they are suggesting a wait-and-see approach until AFTER next quarter. I'm totally F'ed by all of this; all I can do is collect dividends until garbage street decides to be ""fair"" to HAL once again......___________________________https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hard-see-why-wall-street-145700708.html"

insiders are now buying at this level looks good to me started my positions today
Look like bottom? In a few weeks $45.
They need to raise the one year price target. Who is even responsible for that at yahoo?
If Trump keeps using Twitter to get his message out affectively Trump should keep doing it. Why do we need all these liberal bias reporters pumping out twisted stories and fake news. Media companies and newspapers should send reports pink slips. Make them find new jobs something called real work. I rarely watch the news on TV and I never read the newspaper anymore becsuse I can find everything I need on the Internet. It's a new world we live in today. Trump is our new president get use to it sore losers.
just some fun stuff for you to read!! SORRY!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-energy-stocks-sell-now-160651313.html
"the fact that oul services stock prices are now ignoring oil prices, I find very interesting. this is due to speculation and making a bet that things will return to normal very quickly or a flaw that will result in major sell off eventually."
"Current book value shows at just over $11.. Forward earnings growth is what all oil service companies thrive on,and right now most of them are unsure of their future. Sure they make positive statements, been doing that for 4/5 years now... Just be careful with any buys of any oil service company at this time."
Hal is turning into a real woofer..Biden will assist the market to flame out and crash.
Climbing back up
"pennies at a time, 1 penny forward then 5 pennies backwards."
forecast calls for pain.
"Not far from 52 week low, and oil is booming. If you’re not buying HAL at this drop, you have no idea what you’re doing. Come enjoy the quick ride up with me."
The trade issue will get resolved in the next few months. Trump doesn't want stock market collapse to be used against him by the Democrats in run up to 2020 election.
Lift off now back to 32 bucks for the sell-off began
Can HAL move up to 18.1 today?
Started adding today. Will add more if it goes down. Very little downside huge upside potential.

Looks like $27 very possible. Bottom who knows -- $22 - $23?
"LOK at chart....support here at $40.70....then $40, then $38, but don't see it going there...bet it reverses from here!"

"I like HAL, great company but it provided equipment to the Venezuelan National oil authority and its not clear if it was paid for it."

HAL reached a 52 Week low at 19.30
HAL is doing nicely today. Any other oil-related stocks you are holding or watching? SDPI has been trending up and is still a low cost stock. Weatherford has also been climbing back up. Oil can just keep this slow & steady climb for a few years. I won't complain.
HAL is down 5.00% to 28.77
no matter what the analysts say now all of the dirty laundry on companies has come out which gives most of them I need a bottom from here the only direction is up so this is a good time to invest in oil
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/30/shell-q1-2020-results.html

"Lying Chunt is A.K.A. mares with 3,298 spams on $Hal board and over 15,089 reactions on $CSCO conversation.14,976 posted by loon ""mares"" and his various other Yahoo IDs.What a moron. Nobody cares or reads the liberal posted lies and baloney. She looks better with her make up on only slightly. One ugly dude"
Better check the financials before buying. Liabilities out weight receivables by 10.5 billion short term . This tells me a big chance of dilution.
"15 weeks ago, I started a contest to guess Hal end of year stock price. Kuchim was closest. (s)he guessed $24.57. The loser, of course is Sam, who said Hal was going down to a single digit!"
Twenty years ago oil was $10-12 a barrel. The current depressed environment won’t last because Saudi Arabia is starving itself.
Can you say hypocrite liberal? There is clearly a double standard for DNC propagandized low information types.http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2017/05/when-al-franken-body-slammed-a-demonstrator.php?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=sw&utm_campaign=swing

HILLARY IS MORE POPULAR THAN TRUMPFACT.

♫Big Red keeps on hustlin' on(?)♫
Iran seized another tanker in the strait so oil should be going up. Russia putting navy in Iran to protect them. Now theres is reason to be bullish on oil and shorts need to worry. Spike is coming.
Will HAL go back too 55 ? Next year
Earning report coming soon. What’s everyone thought on it ?
"I am thinking about getting in on HAL at this level, could use some insights.Thanks in advance"
Well considering to go long HAL at these Low levels... and that’s only because oil continues to climb up little by little.
Scott Gruber from Citigroup Says Buy 11/30/18 $45.00So I did yesterday at 32.00 HAL will be sooo busy next year this stock will easily hit 45.00. OIL going up and USA energy leading the way.
"HAL doing more work in North Dakota... WLL is one of the big winners with the Dakota Pipeline up and running, WLL owns about 800,000 acres of mineral rights, making them the #1 mineral right holder in N.D."
Guess its time to buy to average down. Great entry price here. Buffets Berkshire Hathaway will be adding to. They like over sold energy companies. No way this falls more.
sellers in full control price has a chance < $5
When shorts will start to cover?
Steady bleed dry. Brutal
"Sad but true, OBAMA left office with 4- WARS raging AND DOUBLED THE US National Debt to $20 Trillion MAY GOD BLESS President Trump "
"oil should hit $70 by next wednesday. $75 in 1 more week. top out $80 till next meeting. Opec don't need to raise production to get more money by not producing more. Best way to rake in dough . If they increase production, price drops to $50they have to sell 30% more for the same revenue. they can't be that dumb."
cnbc was negative on HAL yesterday
What’s going on long term ? Anyone would like to shed some light
"LARGE BLOCK SELLING,,,,,,, LIQUIDATING SELLING AT SUCH A FAST RATE.........SELLING, HAS EXCEL.....IT IS OVER. THE WEATHERFORD FAMILY FRAUD,AND HALLIBURTON IS SO VERY SAD.......FRAUD,,,,,, RUNNING RAPID"
https://nationalpost.com/pmn/health-pmn/trump-says-he-expects-saudi-russia-oil-production-deal-in-coming-days
One of the big losers in the oil services space this year (along with SLB). Should have bounced back big today! I'll check again when it's 10% lower.
"EVNGSUN, who just today changed his name to T, made a fool of himself claiming to be a know it all day trader!! said HAL would be above $20 by end of October..... I called him out then.... lets make a bet little cupcake!! lets see who's who... 10 grand should be no problem for you! this one days earnings for you!! I say I have at least 10 times the wealth you do... wanna lay, little fella?"
Buy back cheaper when shorts pull down to 28.00 again.
"Like just dying on a limb, price deodorization continues after such a nice run up!"
The market becomes hard to understand recently
"With oil at $47 and a giant build Wednesday, why is oil moving up."
"HALLIBURTON IS NOW ANOTHER WEATHERFORD FAMILY FRAUD.........66.00NEVER TO RETURN,,,,,,,, IT IS OVER FOR HALLIBURTON,,,,,, IT IS A CRIME THAT THEY ARE TRADING.....IT IS OVER."
"When the negativity is out in full force, it's time to accumulate."
"If you think HAL will survive the ""Oil War,"" buying HAL at or near its current SP is a triple or quadruple waiting to happen. If HAL's SP goes lower, buy more."

30 million shares short stock up $0.70 on 2 million shares how do you spell short margin call pain expensive you short a company that has problems not one of the best run companies in the world this will see 27 bucks within a couple of weeks and back into the 30s there after

"wonder where the baggies ran off to?? thought this was going to $30 this week? thought we'd never se the $18's again? I told you to sell at $22, didnt I? easy call."
Wow! What is BK chance ?
"John OK I don't like what the street did to SLB after decent if not good ER. The Conf Call for SLB I listened to. French speaking accent and all. I did decipher that they said they were in a 4 times greater sales position internationally than their nearest competitor. With out naming HAL as that competitor. They then said N.America would cut by 10% capex for new E&P. So, that said I just suspected bad news on guidance for next quarter based on the revelation by CEO of Schlumberger.. I think that, The international market is where Hal is needed to get more business if North America cutting back. Revenue is what I'll be watching Monday. They apparently say they are raising prices to producers. But then I hear they are being pressured to cut costs for the lower NG prices Et al. So, PTEN is cutting their bids in marcellus shale. Anyway hoping for rally. iran stirring up the strait of hormuz should help. War isn't the answer. Rand Paul is negotiating peace. Thats odd that our secretary Pompeo isn't doing that. That war hawk Bolton needs fired by Trump. I am bullish on energy for shale mineral right owners sake *I am one, and the Great State of WV Severence taxes needed by state for poor schools, roads, government etc. GL hope for beat."

Hunter Biden is misunderstood.Donald Trump Jr. should offer Hunter a job as a starter at at Trump national Golf Course.HAL will be a $22 stock!
"I have something crossing through my mind:Could LPI buy back $CRC assets? CRC being not in a very good shape at the moment, LPI and CRC chairman of the Board is the same person..., plus, Mr Albrecht is also member of the board of $HAL, and it may be a very nice synergy between assets acquisitions at low price by sending CRC into bankruptcy soon and parteners with HAL into facilities agreements at lower costs as well, a sort of win win game for LPI. Is it stupid?https://investors.crc.com/governance/board-of-directors/default.aspx"
"Earnings will tell the tale. The layoffs right before them could be a sign of a bad earnings report. But perhaps that will be the flush out we need before ascending up over the next couple years. I have bought 400 shares of HAL with options premiums collected, and will continue to do so at these levels. A few years from now when I have 1500-2000 free shares, I will be grateful for it."
Just hit the financial crisis low from 2008. I’m sure this is just as bad. Buying my second piece here.
"Congrats Longs. HAL should be up another 30% by next earnings, IMO. HAL should also give US Silica (SLCA) pin action.I'm long on HAL and SLCA."
THANK YOU NANCY DAVE HIGH FIVE ME BABBY
$20 a share... rally coming by summertime !Hold tight

HAL is down -4.95% to 37.53
"If I recall, the company said this quarter is tough. But they see next year bright. Hope it is true."
Halliburton is up 15.72% to 14.21
"Bloomberg said HAL has a ""habit"" to predict cycle bottom. Check its historic prediction in that article. In its Q3 conference call, CEO repeated its earlier prediction for this cycle that Q4 2018 is a bottom. Based on last cycle stock performance, HAL price will start to move higher at Nov or Dec 2018 and continues to move up for next 4 quarters. The new cycle strength may bring the stock price to $60 or higher. Patient to this oil company."
"LMAO..... just another day of opportunity, right baggies?? every day is another day of opportunity!! the baggie mantra.."
Oil up 3% and this turd is down 1.25%. Who is selling??? Oil will rocket higher next year. Just junk.

Any time this sam wants to visit SOME HAL.. friends of mine and see what drilling entails with his loud stupid mouth. come over to Eastern Ohio and spew those anonymous Sam insults for Haliburton. I know that. Hal employees work hard and don't sit back like leeches playing short bashing and short selling games. with this value stock. Shorting is funny isn't it? Costs some good people their jobs. Thats not funny. I will stay long HAL for 2 years. Dividend yield good. And company has great SP expectations. Sams a coward and wouldn't say in person what he does from his basement trading desk at Deloitte now.LMAO.
I see SLB on AMTD site but HAL wasn't downgraded. Nothing at all.
"Dow up 1,000 points and oil up 3%. HAL barely moving. This can't be good."
Going to jump in this morning at the bell...
Hal Will file for bankruptcy sooner than later
Open at $8 please.
HAL is politically connected. Never hurts. Usually helps!
Up up and up again to $45's...Just a matter of time!
"Christopher, where'd you run off to??? lmao..... I don't blame you! guess you were wrong....again! Christopher last monthWith solid analysts’ backing, more new projects, a nice dividend and a pps not seen in years, this has become a must Buy for both short and long term."
So sad that Former president Obama told biggest 2 lies of any President in History. If you like your health insurance and Doctor under Obamacare you can keep them. He told the lie 26 times on TV and the liberal media gave him a free pass.
Don't buy HAL. Oil going to $ 1 per barrel.
Do you believe there is going to be another dip?

"Larry, . of Larry, Darryl and Darryl...... already wins the dumbest post of the day.... and its only 8 am!!! CONGRATS!! Larry10 hours agooil is down .50 cents a barrel and HAL is down $1.12.so for every .50 cents of a barrel of oil = $1.12 of HAL,, Than HAL should be trading above $60.00 a barrel according to wall street big and smart boyslet me give you some friendly advice, son..... get out of the market . and NEVER get into anything that requires thought, understanding, or common sense..... you're welcome!"
$17.......... $16......... $15.......... worst run company in the sector ... MILLER making millions... ran up debt.....laying off thousands... ...stopped drilling.......its a huge joke.
Tons of pressure put on SA prince by secretary of state Mike P and US senators from oil producing states. just a matter of time before MBS gives up. Without US protection Iran will take over SA in 24 hours.
"LMAO...... Special Ed got taught another lesson by the SAMMY! Kids need tat now and then...... no charge for the Education, Special Ed...... maybe the next lesson will stick.."
SLB said on conference call that they are exiting Milling and Fishing Services so HAL will be only reliable company in world for fishing services. Good for HAL!!!
why is this down today?
it would be my opinion but those people selling holabird the day have margin calls in their accounts that's the only reason anyone we selling it at
earnings report what time i would like to hear their outlook fur next 2 quarters
"last time I logged into by brokerage account, I was up over 5k with HAL. Logged in today and I am down just over $1,000. Why is this stock struggling in 2017? Market, overall, has been up. Oil basically went from just over $50 during the latter part of last year to about $46 presently. The decline in oil, IMO, is not great enough to justify current share price. What gives? If I recall, the GREAT majority of analysts, dating back to last year, were predicting oil prices (and HAL) would increase greatly in 2017. Can anyone explain what is going on here? I would have thought a new CEO would've had a positive effect on the price given the management debacle with the failed merger. Losing patience. May sell when/if I go posive over the short term.Do you think HAL is a long term hold at current prices?"
Why did this drop today?
Trump the best President since Reagan.
"mares tell me PleaseLiberal democrat voter REMINDER: Here's what 8- years of golf gets you. Under President Obama, Democrats lost 986 state legislature seats, 12 governors, 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats. Oh, Democrats lost the White House, too. Democrat party Democrats should hate Obama by now. Keep posting your liberal nonsense keep losing."
yawn. pff.
"@sam, a few 100’s lay-off in the Rockies does not make HAL CEO Jeff Miller a bad guy. 10,000 layoffs would give the stock price a pop upwards. Not long ago HAL had 50,000 employees, now it has 60,000. I am going to call you sam-short squeeze from now on..."
"The question is, how low does it go. Is ten dollars a possibility and will it be a buy then. It wasn't long ago, a month or so ago and I bought it in the low thirties. I might as well ride it until it goes bust. I had to correct the word ride, I typed, rid. Time will tell."
"Just another hit, unfit to our economy. HAL don't need co/v .Watch out for HAL hit south more. Sam maybe right about 17, which is not far from today closed.But I see the chart does not go to 17.

Where is Sam? I need his guidance on where HAL is going next. can someone find the rock he's hiding under? Or should we just wait until the next bad day for HAL to flush him out?
Strong come back....It will close at $42.50 or higher today.

OSX trading at 2008-9 crisis lows when SPX was 666. wow
Should I sell ? With the current $1 billion loss happening
down 4% on positive earnings. why?
Halliburton is up 6.80% to 12.88
"This company trades in a range from 25-57 every year for the last 5 years, reaching 77 in 2013. Why should this year be any different?"
looks like $18 is a given....
Commodity is difficult to trade. Too much speculation. Up and Down.
Might as well buy an electric car and shut down the airlines. Dems are getting to be a real pain in the rear. Start walking more.
Why is this not correlating to oil prices? At all?
without Powell put this would be at $2
President Trump keeping his promises making America great again build that wall nice and high bring all our jobs back from China and Mexico.

Good on ya' mate! :-)My source for Trading Central is not showing any change in Trading Central's prediction for HAL. Still calling for a rebound to $50.5. Personally, I think we are done for the $44.7 side of the game. They had their best chance yesterday; they didn't get there, or even close. I'm guessing this tries a breakout over $48.Will it be real this time? Time will show it.Good luck to longs here. :-)"
"Loading up. With Pfizer and now Moderna news, HAL will get on track to double before Xmas."

"“We have been through downturns before. We know what to do and will execute based on that experience. We are taking swift actions to reduce overhead and other costs by approximately $1 billion, lower capital expenditures to $800 million, and improve working capital. We will take further actions as necessary to adjust to evolving market conditions.“We believe the actions we take will not only temper the impact of the activity declines on our financial performance, but also ensure that we are in a strong position, financially and structurally, to take advantage of the market’s eventual recovery,” concluded Miller."

What is going on with this site? I'm looking for info on HAL. Go post this stuff on Yahoo somewhere else.
The stock will probably double.
HAL is down 5.00% to 16.52
There's a gap in the chart to fill between 43.05 and 44.80. It doesn't need to be today. Some time next week will do!

The bulls charge On 
"HAL is still at 4K RPM but stuck in neutral at $13, when will it break out, July 20th?"
"$HAL and $SLB won't let this go bankrupt again. It is not to their advantage. All bankruptcy does is let these companies come out stronger.They had as 178m in EBITDA last quarter. They have 764 million in cash + 1.2 billion in receivables and another billion of inventor and other currents assets of 402 million. Total current assets is 3.37B!!!They have 1.64b in current liabilities people and 2.1 billion in debt so 3.74 billion. Net debt that is like 400,000 million and EBITDA in worst quarter is 178m.People do the math. How long will this take to go bankrupt at this rate. Look at the balance sheets of Diamond Offshore or Whiting and what the stock traded at in terms of total market cap. The only reason this is not a $15 stock right is because it is not on the public markets. Bonds have been ticking up since march lows and are now 73c on the dollar. That compares to $hit OFS stocks that trade with a comparable market cap and metrics relatively speaking. Just look at HCR. It trades at 1/2 a cent. Yes, not even a penny and I am talking about their bonds!!! No their stock. When a bond holder sell at 1/2 cent that means they have no hopes of gettting any money back.Why does SLB and HAL want them to reorg again and come out stronger. That would be crazy. This is getting bought out by them or Baker Hughes. It has to. I don't know when but it will happen."
"Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) declares $0.045/share quarterly dividend, -75% decrease from prior dividend of $0.180"
HAL can go to $50.00 in about 45 days....
can anyone remember when this last closed green?? neither can I ? I doubt it will today either.....
could get to $18 today!! terribly run company... Miller is clueless.... but he cant be fired... board is impotent. All Wall Street knows this...
How is Halliburton Stock up today when WTI oil is down 40% ??
Will wait until lt touch 29.50.
This stock is stupid cheap.
Folks this is going to hit $28 by summer. Oil glut is coming back and oil will be $40 soon.

"Good day to you lads’ and lassies. It’s been a long hiatus, but I finally jumped back aboard the good ship Hal with a couple k at 6.33. The fact this held up makes me think the knife has hit the ground."
Hal will cross 50 day moving average in a few days. Run Hal Run
I have had HAL on my watch list for some time but I have not purchased the stock. I have Three Pipeline stocks but HAL scares me. How are earnings going to stay up when well drilling rigs are all going idle and wells are being shut in to reduce production? They will not be finishing or servicing those wells but will probably have more work when they restart the shut in wells and start drilling again. Anyone see a different picture than I do?
What is a good strategy with this stock? I get a discount thru work and the lowest price for the quarter.
Halliburton is up 6.19% to 20.77
this is a very good price. I just bought in at 6.41

"HAL boast a 95+ EPS ranking from IBD/ investors business Daly’s CANSLIM stock selection system. Having been a $ Manager for over 20 yrs, b4 recently retiring, I can tel you even the largest of firms, funds , hedge F etc. use IBD and CANSLIM to select their stocks. HAL is the strongest in the breed, as far as consistently retrying EPS. & over long curve growing that EPS while churning out favorable ROE/ return on Equity. With Val just over book value, limited debt service, & Top of heap management, they also boast experience of Navigating many volatile periods in the past. I think cutting Div. & Reworking Their own CapEx will position them , with co. Like OXY as leaders in the NEW OIL BULL MKT"
Any particular reason HAL went from 8.98 to 8.04?

Huge projects built, pipelines etc. Alberta booms again along with Texas etc supplying the world with oil now."

"A drop in oil prices is not as helpful to the U.S. economy as it was when the country was massively dependent on foreign oil. That's because the fracking revolution has made domestic oil and natural gas production a major part of the U.S. economy. A drop in prices hurts that domestic industry. It leads to less drilling, fewer jobs, cuts in factory orders and a host of aftershocks that could leave the nation as a whole worse off.The last time oil prices dropped by a comparable amount, in 2015-2016, it contributed to a slowing of economic growth from 2.9% to 1.6%So watch out for HAL. going south; Don't know how low it can go."

And thank goodness we won't have to watch her getting off air force one many more times. She wasted as much jet fuel as a storage tank in Cushing Oklahoma stores, by flying to California to be on TV shows, whenever she got bored with the lame duck Berry."

We will need international sales improvement to beat expectations.
"Question: If oil fields in Saudi Arabia and Iraq get hit by Iran, does HAL go up or down?"
Halliburton is down 10.73% to 6.99
Oh no! it’s green now. LOL
"The sewer dwelling shorts are playing a losing battle. As they work for pennies, the world is getting back on track, with oil probably seeing the high 30's to mid 40's by mid summer. This will be back at $14 plus, if not more, when that happens. Russia and Saudi Arabia cannot survive on $20-$25 oil. Your corrupt Democrat politicians also need the money to line their pockets, but will say they need the tax for roads. As much as the greenies hate it, greed will always win with these thieves. HAL is great investment as today's price."

Crooks would be my guess!!!!!!!!!!!
As long as they make money stock price will come up. Just need to wait until oil price comes up.

HAL can easily reach into the low $30's on this run. I might sound off but the chart supports that more then SP below $20. HAL has been due for a run up in SP for a couple months.
time to get paid.
Is anyone know why this is falling when results especially compared to BKR are better in terms of revenue? anything conf call ?
Big drama is coming
what a dog
Hello $7. Been expecting you.
How is HAL not hitting $25-27 with this energy crisis in America's south? Criminal to hold the sp down.
New trader watchlist was published by these guys (https:// www.tradenow.xyz) and it featured HAL.
Will HAL go back 35 again
Headed to the bottom !
"Unfortunately, downgrade was on price target. I would like to see reduction of EPS or revenue if it is truly bad. That will remind investors of a low expectation. By next Q, the price will fly high after beating. Right now, analysts are uncertain. The price target reduction is noise."
Buy the dip. Oh wait #$%$
"There’s lots of price targets, but I wish we could close over $24.00. There seems to be some resistance."
Trump needs to tell SA if they want the fighter jets they ordered they need to get the price back up.
"Stimulus package from government should include help for US oil companies hit by plummeting oil and gas prices. Now Trump needs to impose tariffs on oil imported from SA. Just like he imposed tariffs on steel imported from China, Brazil and Turkey in 2018. If he does WTI will hit $50 and HAL will double"
A lot of insider filings were reported today
Will the dividend come back this year?
Green Hah!! Like I said shorts are stupid . go longs.
Not sure if I should start a position in HAL or add to any of the stocks I’m down in

The WFT Bk announcement might just be the cause for the services companies dropping. I am most certain that news had to be leaking at least for a week prior announcement. It never really is a complete surprise
Way way way over sold. I think it put a solid bottom in today. It might retest it and start to go back up. Oil will recover in the 70s once sanctions are enforced to Iran next month.
"Got back in again, a lot of small OFS are going bankrupt which means more business for the likes of HAL and SBL. The lower oil demand reported is already priced in."
$9 coming for sure . Ugly morning for oil. Time to accumulate in the single digits.
Congrats longs on hanging in there. I bought last spring at 53 and watched it go down to the lows 40's
Don’t listen to stick trader. He said he sold 5000 shares short at 10.60 and had a 6380 loss....that means he bought them back at 11.87...high of the Day was 11.07. He’s a liar. He’s not even in the stock

"I TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran is bracing for the restoration of U.S. sanctions on its vital oil industry next week, as it grapples with an economic crisis that has sparked sporadic protests over rising prices, corruption and unemployment.The Trump administration on Friday announced the reimposition of all U.S. sanctions on Iran that had been lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal, ramping up economic pressure on the Islamic Republic.The oil sanctions, set to take effect on Monday, will target the country's largest source of revenue in the most punishing action taken since the Trump administration withdrew from the 2015 nuclear agreement in May, and will also affect Iranian shipping and financial transactions.Tehran state TV reported on the sanctions Friday, citing international media outlets and highlighting the U.S. decision to allow eight nations to maintain imports of crude oil from Tehran, calling it a sign of the U.S.'s ""failure"" to reduce Iran's oil exports to nil.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the exemption for eight nations on Friday, saying they would be announced on Monday and will include U.S. allies such as Turkey, Italy, India, Japan and South Korea which had made efforts to eliminate their imports but could not complete the task by Monday."
Trump is your President mares and mine too. Glad he beat lying corrupt Hillary. I bet your happy too. 
"Wish I had gotten some in the $4's or $5's, oh well. Built a nice position anyway."
all time low is around $6. Not too much left. A whole oil sector is down every day no matter how oil behaves. Last 3 days oil was up but 92% of oil stock price today lower than 3 days ago.
oil nvr going away.
Former president Obama told biggest 2 lies of any President in History. If you like your health insurance and Doctor under Obamacare you can keep them. He told the lie 26 times on TV and the liberal media gave him a free pass.
"CEO is negative, Price is negative. Hang on tight."

mares the moron troll -- Hillary lost Trump handed her crushing a defeat he's your president for the next four years get use to it crybaby liberal
The worst stock to buy. stay away from it
See you in the single digits...
"Saidis already restored 70% of production loss...... just a blip ... like I told you yesterday! my short made a killing... and I posted it here yesterday when I shorted!! Special Ed, not so special....lmao."
Can’t even hit $25. Pathetic! What a DOG!
Pay close attention to the debts all these oil and gas companies are carrying! I just can’t imagine how they will be able to payoff when prices are historically low? Trump started tariff war; Saudis started Oil war; someone started war on global health (COVID-19) to cripple demand and economic breakdown. Unbelievable!
"Doing good only down 1% compare to oxy down 5%, it is holding very well."
Will run to $50 by the end of 2019. Let's see if I am correct in 355 days...Will check then!
hal is going much lower. oil going up and hal down. days of oil are numbered. invest in 5G infrastructure companies instead
1/3/2020 from 24 down to 12 today the Hal chart looks like the water vortex in a toilet.Lots of better stocks out there.Sell now to preserve your capital
LOOK OUT BELOW!!!
Anyone buying?
Halliburton is up 14.49% to 7.35
"I agree with Argon, can't worry about this. Let the cake cook and check in later. Good dividend. Oil necessity and it will spike. Iran will make sure of that. And Saudi's will protect the price. USA markets are great opposed to LYING short network CNBC. Gold will drop it always does. HAL will beat revenue expectations and do fine in Brazil. EPS beat and stock will go up fast. No problems with HAL except global oil demand temporarily allegedly stalled. Allegedly by fake news. Short strategy. Hope best for higher prices near term if not then I'll get long term capital gains tax relief on holding this gem of a company. Enjoy the ride."
"Well looky, looky. When you know how to read stock charts, you can make the big bucks. That was my gift to you today guys."
"Obama is the worst president since World War II, a new poll says.According to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday, 33 percent of voters think the current president is the worst since 1945."
"Goodbye, HAL!"
OIL AT $0 HAL SOON $0 BK
Wow should have backed the truck up at $5
Why are so many bullish on HAL? You can ski down the 1 yr. chart and oil is expected to be down thru the end of the year.

Crude is at 10 bucks ? Halliburton is up ? Frac is not going to be fracking at that price
Come on horse on up there
Market correction is over. Get some HAL shares today. We are very far from get rids of oil.
I never short. However all oil looks ready for it if I did....
"Again Irracional trading, oil is down 0.50% and HAL is up. It used to be that there was a strong correlation with oil prices. Is this action being driven by hedge funds?"
SLB versus HAL? Opinions?
Huge amount of buyers near 13.70. It can't fall!
"The latest from the Bakken ; 2 crews still fracking. New equipment designs in route from Duncan Oklahoma research & development facility including 50 new Q10 rotary crankshaft electric pumps. This new equipment still requires a diesel powered generator but will cut back on total fuel consumption during zones. In lame man terms - this will lower the break even price yet again. When the going gets tough, the tough get going. Well done Halliburton."
Bought HAL at $7 and sold at $15. Just came to check how it’s doing. Great company
My broker just called me to LOAD UP on HAL! Price target is $35 now!
This stock is not going anywere it will trade in the lower 20s for the rest of the year
Worst stock in my portfolio.

"Lol...Sam, you’re getting more and more quiet as HAL’s price continues to rise. Ready to start thinking about joining us Longs yet?"
"Amazing management, I am projecting easily & 26-27 before year end as oil market reboundsLoad up while it’s cheap !!!!!"
Wont post much but I bought in late today under 6. I'm hoping the Russians and Saudis make up and play nice. This huge American company should be doing better. I have no insights. Just hoping this goes up soon.
15+ after we beat earnings again ! 
"Picked up 7,500 shares of Halliburton at $23.90... what a steel !! The Iran  situation is still not finished. More trouble is coming, so buy HAL and hold it is currently undervalued. Good luck to all the longs."
half way Good
oh my...... when to cover the rest of my short...... I think ill hold it for $17
"Oh, the pain of not buying more shares when the share price dipped back into the high fives after my purchase......... I am enjoying my paper profits, but can’t stop asking myself ‘why, why, why didn’t you take.advantage of the extra cash position in your portfolio when the price had crashed?’ After all, the pandemic provided just the perfect buying opportunity to jump on oil related stocks that happens maybe once in a lifetime."
Lost 30% of value in last month
No support until around $21.1...Oil sector is looking bad.
"Like it or not, HAL is going to grind higher for some time."
"It’s going to take awhile before oil will makes a recovery.To much reserves every country that sells oil has so much that they can’t store it. Not saying Hal is a bad stock it will go up but it’s going to be a slow ride back to the top, anything negative about oil will make it dip."
$6.61 haha bite me Cheney you war monger.
I’m a recent investor in HAL. I’m curious what you more experienced energy investors think will happen to HAL given the issues in Saudi Arabia?
I'll buy at $15
I’m happy with this company bought in at 8$
Time for major cost cutting!
"COME ON $18 !! then next stop , $15 ! Miller is a laugher.... Hal employees have lowest morale in history.... Engineers leaving in droves..... laying off thousands ... massive debt....losing money... fracing equipment laying around rusting... Oil glut...demand slowing.... the list is long.... best short in the market!"
Trump wont last a year.He is the most corrupt and incompetent President in history.
"Started tracking HAL vs. WTI Crude. They don't always change in the same way, but often do. Hope it doesn't take until 2021 for it to get back to where it was in early 2018."
"You need to own shares before and on the ex-dividend date, otherwise your buyer receives the dividend."
TRUMP WAS FINE ON CELEBRITY APPRENTICEBUT HE IS FAILING BIGLY AS PRESIDENTPelosi: FBI and Congress must investigate Trump-Russia connections in wake of Flynn resignation
finally moving a few pennies at a time forward.
Hope HAL will move up again tomorrow. Crude oil is way to low now.

"The market rallies more than 15% on average in the 18 months following a bond yield rate inversion. A recession hits in 22 months after the inversion, according to Credit Suisse. So, expect a rally before allegded recession."

"Today's volume is already outpacing yesterday's; not good. I've been around this game a little while now, and one of things that days like yesterday and today tell me is that, garbage street had forewarning that this was going to happen. They ALL knew it........EXCEPT for the common shareholders of the stock. All the ""analysts""......right down to the evil-bug shorts.It's ALWAYS ONLY US, that never see it coming. Caught in total surprise. Always makes me wonder the same thing. Did the CEO know beforehand?In many of the other positions which I've had (biotech in particular) the answer is (almost always), ""yes, they would have known for sure.""That light-in-the-loafers guy that ran CSCO did the EXACT same thing as this CEO did yesterday (but he did it years ago).Chambers. That was his name. At a CC, he jabber-mouthed about soft earnings and it became a situation JUST like this one Who would have this CEO been ""creating a buying opportunity"" for?Might he be trying to weaken the company and position it for a buyout by one of the other big 3?I guess even that shill Cramer was commenting on this last night. If THAT shill knew it was coming, you can bet even our CEO knew. A total setup. You see, corruption in the market doesn't just stop at the shorts, and banksters....... they are ALL mixed up in it. ONLY the guy that no control whatsoever in the situation (except to be the victim of course) is not in on their financial games......"
"This will likely head to $25, but the 5 year chart makes it looks like it's been here multiple times before and fluctuates a lot. Might be a tough year for this stock but I also don't think $35-$40 is outside the realm of possibility for later in the year also."
Will finish +3% today

This stock should be $9 today
no reason to be down today. hft guys at work on several cheap stocks today.
What is g2 on divined cut in April?
Upgrades and new PT should be rolling in.
cant hold 11.
I think worst case scenario is the 2008 financial crisis low of $12.80 share. Seems ridiculous but at this point that is all I have as a potential spot that would highlight a bargain that can’t be ignored. So today I may start buying some in increments to give me a full position around $12.80 if it actually comes around. I don’t think it will get there but I will be prepared to buy if it does.
"the exhuberance in the oil markets should take haliburton to the 45 area before the Iran sanctions kick in.........we may come down a bit then back up we go before the sanctions take place and before the election......45 and possibly higher in the upcoming weeks!! fingers crossed........,,,,,,,,,,,"
"Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) should be sold, believes Cramer.and we think the same way."
any ideas on where HAL could me in mid August?
Do you believe it will get to $11 today or this week?
"Gainer will sell HAL today for profit, may give back 50% gain from yesterday? . What a run for HAL cause by panic short . But HAL don't own oil. $21.19"

Break that $12 wall today.

Should I sell?
"So, over the last mouth oil has trended upward from about $46 to almost $50, yet HAL fell. That is bad news, folks. Haven't seen that kind of correlation in a while...."
I am still here. This is ridiculous sell off. Really are we talking about Haliburton or Hal the movie. This is billion dollar sales people. Name leader. Performance leader. The CEO said the book was filled with drilling contracts for 2019 yet closed at 28.80. Geez. Strong good company. #2 in the world in oil and gas services business. Bull forever on HAL.
Halliburton is one of the best frun companies in the world the stock being where it is right now is an aberration load up

"CEO said ""Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see more of the same."" Risky?"
This is never coming back. BK in 2021 when the debt comes due.
Looking for an entry point but this stock seems to be a falling knife. Seems HAL management could identify something to stabilize this stock.

This is it. You may never see hal this cheap again. JMO
Obamacare  and democrats can only watch it burn.
Please SELL! Hitting lows when oil was in the 20s. I don’t own it now but it interests me.
"I know that it is early for this, but......The 12 mo price target for HAL had been $60 previously.I would expect a raise on that in light of this AM's earnings report. I am not a good judge of it, but I would guess, $65 or $70 would be in order. We will see what the garbage street ghouls set as the new 12 month target price. As such, the share price cannot go in the wrong direction (down) for too long here. A share buyback announcement AND a target price increase would have to mean a change in direction. My guess is that the greedy ghouls are loading the boat before she changes direction."
I have all the time in the world to get to $40/share.
As oil heads higher so will Hal $

From $73 to $5 in 5 years!! I told you MILLER was a fool 3 years ago...
Oil is on it's way up. Looking at the small companies that provide support to oil & gas drilling. SDPI looks ripe for a nice run. Any others that you are all watching?
Come on $35 you beauty
Looks like we hold $12 for today at least. Ex-Dividend is next Tuesday. May see a slight pull back from sellers. Still a great investment going forward. You get a little spending money and stock appreciation.
"wow, how low will hal go ?"
The big guys start to buy.
Great place to be....wish I had loaded up around $10 or below.
"Can't say no. Oil price has nosed up gradually, We will see HAL to rise gain today."
I don't think HAL will trade under $5 -- but $8 is very possible.

If oil keeps stable HAL is going to keep going up. If oil goes down better get out.
"More BS from another site. This one claims that the earnings were a 1 penny miss. I mean, c'mon!

Peer Schlumberger (SLB) also sold off on its earnings report on Friday.As we've noted before, pressure pumping has been a big issue for the big oilfield services companies, which needed optimistic guidance to boost their stocks post-earnings. The services industry in general has been largely left behind in energy's rally, with XES mired in the red year to date, while the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLE) have notched gains with rising oil prices.Halliburton (HAL) is down 8.2% to $41.50 in afternoon trading.Sign up to Review & Preview, a new daily email from Barron's.

Company is strong. Once oil goes up- that means Russian and Saudi Arabia figure it out- HAL will follow.
HAL has been beaten down so hard and became way under valued stock. I'm 100% sure will pop up by at least $3 tomorrow.
HAL is definitely a SELL at these lefels ($20). No reason for it to be at pre-covid levels and 30% above the average pt when other stocks are trading at half their pre-covid levels. It's all about relative value.

How difficult is it to write a contract where you build in a 10% profit and account for commodity price rises and falls? HAL should know the industry after this many decades. Management is to blame. Lower debt and focus the business in the profitable areas.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-giant-slashes-jobs-amid-210000209.htmlI suggest you sell this pop!
I told you this was trash 2 years ago!! I told you Miller was a moron!! I told you Miller would take this trash into BK !! here we are!
Same old same old. the Israeli brokerages//hedge funds owned by them and clear monopoly rigged Boeing to go up all day on 5 billion loss up 15.00 not shorting it. by their insider monopoly in NY & NJ. But energy for sure the loser to be targeted and shorted. SLB clearly a example a beat and down 3% then up to flat. And if anything is example that will be Hal fate Monday. Just being cautious and realistic since Not in their club. Since SLB CC said North America drillers would cut capex by 10% this year. AND Hal mostly in Permian. And oil prices staying around this level. Have to get some down side protection if holding into Monday. Monopoly have unfair advantage on insider info. They know the ER before release.
I just bought a boatload of HAL shares on Friday at the close for a pop on Monday. What in the Wide World of Sports is going on? I can’t see PAM to catch a break.

Rumors of a dividend cut are very real !!
Iran just boosted the stock
"Totally great stock for investment and safe portfolio hold. . Dividend yield AND ESPECIALLY GROWTH. Chinese don't have minerals. USA does. Hal global but importantly in Usa domestic plays like Permian with XOM and CVX. And marcellus, utica, bakken, eagle ford, powder basins. Consider HAL a national security stock first of all. Like a defense stock. USA government and markets working for them wont let it fall. Too big and important to fail. Needed for national security in event of middle east crisis. And thats likely in Iran. They bailed out auto industry and Wall street after recession and definitely will protect Hal. Need the oil for jets. Categorize as important as Raytheon, Grumman, Lockheed just as important strategically for pentagon. OIL independence from disruptive events."
anybody see this trading at $20 a share in October?
so what was the catalyst today for upside?

Feeling mighty smug today with my $50 October calls I sold last week to lock in my long term gains with a hedge.
"All support has been broken which is incredibly strange given the beat on earnings, oil holding above $60, Ngas over $2.50, and the market going up now. Either someone know something or HAL is being discounted by the market in general."
Obama is market cancer. Trump is market gold.. anyways is this stock worth a damn long term?> oil spiking up a bit recently

Hal will see $25 overnight. Shorts be ready to cut your losses!!
June contracts looking good. Surprising how many people are in this game that don't know how the futures work. People actually think oil has crashed for good. May expires tomorrow and everyone will be dumbfounded when they see it back at 21+ overnight.
haliburton is fairly cheap at this price.
"little Christopher says all is well with HAL !! he said they have more business than ever! YES, the MORON said that!! they are lying off 8% of their workforce, and have shelved ALL fracing equipment in the Permian ....... That my friends, is a moron! I rest my case.."

"I also own Roku, but only a small position. I was worried it was too “risky” so I put more of my money into HAL. Lol!"
All these articles hating on HAL. They got no faith. I wonder why?
HAL should resume upward movement at the end of day and hope to see $ 11.25 + tomorrow.
"I looked at the options board two nights ago, a lot of open interest at April 27, 19.00 calls. March is going to be flat"
think Hal is a little ahead of itself. retest of 8 is not out of the question.
What is wrong with HAl? stocks keeps going down.
Some things I like about HAL:1) Lowest PE of the big 32) Jeff Miller’s advancement to CHairman BOD & 20 years at HAL3) HALS joint venture with Microsoft4) HALs steerable drilling device5) HALs commitment to international sales6) HALs 100 year anniversary
Bull run coming. HAL is in list of best of premier of the most premier companies. This isn't china OR TRUMP ITS short trade orchestrated and scare tactics. The oh no its dropping on CNBC with wink wink we are short and making money is out of control. Wake up people market is rigged to rob portfolios and blame anyone but the shorts causing it. Nobody understands the power of billions in NY tribe to short stocks at their miserable will and whimseys.
I hope old Sam is covering. I’m sure going to miss all of his dumb advice.
at this cheap of a price what are the chances of a buyout
When oil hits $45.00 buy! HAL @ $23

I would like to see Schlumberger pick up this company at quite a considerable discount.
Is there anything else to this company other than oil? whatever ever happen to their subcontracting companies like brown & root. Is the success of this company completely depended on oil?

"Market up, oil up, HAL down. Anything to do with oil is in the dog house, anything related to fracking is pure hell. I just couldn’t give back any more from the earnings pop. Best of luck to all longs."
"Relax. This is an American staple. If we take another hit so be it. This stock has been around since 1930s, second largest in the world, its contracts and operations and equipment is worth more than its current price. This is the example of a company too big to fail with too many connections worldwide. Doom and gloom- this stock hit 4 and doubled. If it goes to 4 again I’ll double my position. Back in 08 people were calling for the end of the world then we roared. It’s okay! This too shall pass. I expect next week we will be 8.50 or higher simply off the options being placed. Wall Street is not in the business to loose money"

"Some of you baggies might want to read this........ I hate to bring facts and reality into the conversation...I know how you hate that! sorry!Halliburton (HAL) energy stocksSource: ThinkorSwimHalliburton (NYSE:HAL) rounds out our trio of bearish beauties. From a performance perspective, it’s the worst of the three with a year-to-date loss of 27%. It has been poison to portfolios. Last week’s oil drop didn’t just push HAL stock to a new 52-week low; it knocked to its lowest level since 2009.As you would expect with such atrocious performance, everything on the chart points to lower prices. The trend on all time frames is cruising lower, moving averages are falling, and relative weakness has followed the stock like a hellhound.Implied volatility is sky-high at the 77th percentile of its one-year range. To combat the expensiveness of option premiums, spreads are a must.Buy the Oct $20/$17.50 bear put spread for around $1.05. The risk is limited to $1.05, and the reward is limited to $1.95.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn’t hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities.

"Hey guys/girls! Nice moves yesterday and premarket looks great. I bought some options in MRO yesterday morning and those are doing nice as well. Very interesting to say the least. GLTA. Oh and just mute the stock trader puto, there is one on almost every board"
Buy #WTI this one is done doing well. Sold this garbage for WTI. So far so good. Better opportunity and more $$ to be made
This stock is a total mess! Thought it would rally to $33-34 after earnings! Can’t believe I ever bought this POS.
HAL is headed to sub 5.00Full disclosure I’m short.If you thought the last recession was bad get ready big surprise coming. You can’t fix a credit problem by issuing more debt. Obama screw the U.S by doubling our debt.
President Trump making America Great. Another great day in stock. Glad I voted for a winner.
Oh Please !! look at it.... how can any of you get excited ! thats funny.. it goes green for a couple days..... will probably close red today..
very disappointing today
This is a good entry to HAL when people are selling.
Renewables are the future. OFS companies will not exist in 20 years!
$22-hope I'm wrong!!
It's funny how this forum was getting a new comment every day or two but now that earnings are out all of the trolls are spouting how bad things are.....you're complete idiots and have no stake in reading and understanding the reports because if you did you'd realize how moronic your comments are. Earnings were good considering where we're at in the world right now and the price/ volume right now supports that!
"I know several HAL fracing engineers, etc..... not one of them has any confidence in MILLER !! they all have been selling shares....and looking for new jobs...... one is a brother in law.... he's in the field every day.....they say Miller doesn't have a clue."
In at 12 yesterday and 11.53 today. New to HAL. Good luck all.
I can’t make sense of it oil down and Hal horses. Earnings on the 20th so is this the same old saying buy on the hype sell on the news.

President Trumps approval up again. Nice
Bought this as my first stock ever in March 2020 for 10.52 and I am out today at 20.25. This has reached pre pandemic levels and the stock was slowly falling way before covid.
"If there is one word to sum up Washington Governor Jay Inslee’s impressions of President Donald Trump and his intentions in the nation’s capitol, it would be “disturbed.” “I was also shocked when the president said, and this is almost a direct quote, ‘Who knew that healthcare was going to be complicated?’” Inslee said of his meeting with the president and the National Governors Association over the weekend. “It was just stunning to have the president, who wants to dismantle the whole system, basically show that he doesn’t understand this in its complexity in the first order. It was just a disturbing thing to hear him say.” Gov. Inslee said he is more concerned now than he was before his meeting with the president. “I have to express really deep concern about what is going on here in the nation’s capitol,” he said. “We are always hopeful that the president will give us assurance that things will be handled in a thoughtful, non-chaotic, rational basis — based on facts and evidence, rather than just tweets.” Inslee reports that Trump only took about eight questions from governors, seven of which were from Republicans. But there was a range of topics the Washington governor was able to address with administration officials."

"Hey, wonder where "" Special Ed "" ran off to.... LMAO...... told you to sell the pop , didnt I? my short is already making me money! easy call... if you know what you're doing... morons like Special Ed will never learn..."
LMAO..... S never came back after a flurry of dumb posts......S9 days agoStarted adding today. Will add more if it goes down. Very little downside huge upside potential.
"Where do you buy? $5.00? $6.00? I like the company and want to buy more, but the oil market dictates the price. This sucks not just for the oils but for our economy. I hate China and everything about them."
I like HAL management-good combination of people coming from the oil fields and went all the way up working in the Middle East and Venezuela. They got money in the bank from the Venezuelan oil authority which need the oil keep pumping at all cost and they even signed an AI technology with Microsoft which went below the radar and not much known about any
This should be $13 at the very least.
"Guess shorts started new move above 15. Give it a few days. They'll be buying it back soon, and hopefully for a couple of bucks more than they shorted it for. Fools."
"Wow Hal for 15 and change, whod a thunk it...i have to think you can make a quick 50% on your money in less than 12 months right? Right?"
HAL is halted. news pending???
should go red soon........ and continue its trend.

Why down to this price ? A lot of debt ?

When you compare SLB and HAL one of the biggest differences is the PE with SLB at 27 and HAL at 11. I believe that’s why SLB only maintained their stock price with a slight beat. HAL is so cheap with a 11X PE that a slight beat could mean considerable stock price appreciation.
we all know if the markets were up and oil was up big this would have been well above 33 today but it held 
Covered at $11.10... thanks for that quick profit. I have to admit HAL is hanging in strong.
Oil prices usually bottom in Feb. and a tremendous amount of oil goes to the airlines; bummer. Be patient.

"You might just want to take a look at this article, just out......__________________________Halliburton Stock Could Sell Off Into the $20s By Alan Farley | July 24, 2018 — 9:39 AM EDT SHARE ADD TO WATCHLISTHALHalliburton Co41.14 -0.96%OIHVanEck Vct Oil25.04 +0.56%View WatchlistHalliburton Company (HALHALHalliburton Co41.14-0.96% ) shares fell more than 8% on Monday after the oil services giant missed second quarter profit estimates. The company matched modest revenue expectations and offered mixed guidance, with Permian basin pipeline restraints and South American weakness cited as headwinds. Cowen lowered its 2018 target on Halliburton on Tuesday morning, raising the odds for a multi-day selling event that reaches the 2017 low in the upper $30s.The decline follows a recent crude oil reversal that dropped the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures contract more than eight points into the mid-$60s. Energy funds, including the underperforming VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIHOIHVanEck Vct Oil25.04+0.56% ), responded with downturns that could signal the next legs of long-term tops, as outlined in Energy Stocks Could Enter Bear Market.

Just checking in seeing if the Cake is about done baking. Still not finished. Hal Stock will be rising nicely though this year. Steady as she goes. SLB going up too. Glad to be long both. Shorts were minor glitch. We are taking care of them. Have a great day longs. .
Awful. There is absolutely no institutional demand for this stock. Oil prices are going to have to move up significantly to get HAL to move up in price.
I own 315 shares @ 9.50. Nice 72% gain and I’m not selling.

"Shame on racist Democrat Kamala Harris. Fake News not a word on this story below. I wonder why?Kamala Harris said she was a student in only the second class to integrate at Berkeley public schools.Kamala Harris: Two decades after Brown v. Board, I was only the second class to integrate at Berkeley public schools. Without that decision, I likely would not have become a lawyer and eventually be elected a Senator from California. That’s the power a Supreme Court Justice holds.There’s just one problem — Everything about that tweet is a lie.Kamala’s parents were successful professionals. Kamala went to school in Berkeley for only 2 years. She then moved with her mother at age seven to Canada where she attended grade school and high school.Kamala Harris was born in 1964She claims she was only the second class to integrate at the Berkeley public schools.Kamala lied.Actually the classrooms in Berkeley were already integrated in 1963 — before she was born.Here’s a photo from the 1963 Berkeley yearbook.And here’s a photo from the Berkeley 1964 yearbook — the year Kamala was born.Kamala Harris was only off by about 20 years.The next time Kamala harris plays the race card for sympathy she should try to get her facts straight."

They've lost money the last 3 calendar years and didn't make much in the year before that. This company should be a license to print dollar bills. What is wrong?"

I have a serious question. No I am not trolling. Do you guys think HAL will be around in 5 years? do they become a takeover candidate? I am thinking of buying this for my grand kids and just buying and looking the other way and not listen to the daily banter. I bought just over $5 and wondering if I should add at these levels or lower. Or am I throwing money away here. Thanks for the help. I know msg boards are not a good place for advice but I am looking out 5-10 year horizon

I was able to buy 100 shares of HAL at $18.00 with the premium Ive collected selling covered calls on the 3 stocks I own since July 26. Took me 16 months of investing to learn how to trade options as a SELLER. I now own 970 shares of HAL after purchasing 870 with my own money.

"Our pivot point stands at 29.9.Our preference: the downside prevails as long as 29.9 is resistance.Alternative scenario: above 29.9, look for 31.4 and 32.3.Comment: the RSI is below 50.

"Analysts are predicting $23 to $43 stock price. Let's have a challenge to see who can come closest to guessing Hal's highest closing price between now and December 31, 2019. I'll say $25.25. All you have to do is post a price. It's not necessary to state why or how, just provide a number. Whoever gets closest gets bragging rights and a gold star! ($25.25)"

"Halliburton Company HAL could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for HAL broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 8.4% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for HAL stock.If that wasn’t enough, Halliburton isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 11 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for HAL."
"I find it's a bit extended here on the daily chart but so are all oil stocks, look at APA, SU, SLB, RIG, XOP, OIH (the later two are sector calls on oil exploration and oil service stocks). The thing that gets me nervous is oil prices are making 5-year high but we aren't anywhere near pre-pandemic levels of growth and the USD is getting ready to reverse its downtrend here. Still, HAL can go to $28 (optimistically) in short run if we close the month on a strong energy trade (doubt it). I'd rather wait to buy a nice dip as the weekly chart looks great."
"isnt it funny how all the sudden all the supposed terrorists of the world have suddenly gone away? no talk of ISIS, Iran etc. ??? guess they are just nice sympathetic humanitarians? or maybe they are just something made up by certain people with agendas??"
Assets minus liabilities equals EQUITY. Hal is selling off it's assets to acquire cash. This is going to be a much smaller company when they get done.

"A couple of things puzzle me. The midstream capacity constraints that are about to afflict the Permian Basin until the middle of next year when new pipeline capacity comes on stream was no secret. In a truly efficient market, this should already have been factored into the price. Why, logically, should the announcement at a conference call of a situation that was known to all suddenly cause the stock to tank. A second point is, assuming that the market was really largely unaware of the looming midstream capacity constraints in the Permian basin, and this point was suddenly brought to its attention at the conference call, why did this only cause HAL to tank and not other directly affected stocks, most egregiously those of the producers in the basin? It is true that the stocks of most Permian producers fell considerably in mid-May, and I attribute this to a pricing in of this adverse situation. However, none that I follow have fallen in the past two days. In short, I don't really buy into this fall and have bought into HAL as a contrarian."

Will fall under $12 short term
This stock is a no brainer to me never in 100 years would have thought I would buy HAL under $10. I am got a nice amount and ready to hold it until oil is back $60. Which will be quick with reopening the economy and production cuts simultaneously. Oil has bottomed out... the party is over for shorts.
Some people should do their research. Good way to do that is to read thru the options tables. Read!
Will this ever hit $30 again? Answer is: NO!
Everything is falling. Buy Hal at this price or lower and hold for a few years and you could make a lot of money depending on how many shares you buy. No way gas stays this low forever unless everyone buys a Prius and airplanes go electric.

I own slb 1250 shares at $56.90, short term it hurts but I know eventually this will turn around it the best of best in their fields will be the ones to recover the fastest. If you are a a long term invested 6 to 13 month there is no reason to look at a stock on a day to day bases. Stock market always shoots too much to the upside on a stock and always over shoots to the downside. Eventually things will calm down and get back to normal. Oil was the worst performing this year, next year hedge funds will start to get back to oil because it has the lost potential for upside. Good luck to all."
HAL is like the Johnson and Johnson of oil. Huge buys came in set new base.Very solid
‘This is bizarre’: The internet recoils in horror at Trump’s incoherent CPAC rant against ‘fake news’
"Mr. Magoo says- Angry mares the liberal democrat loser troll tell me????? Your so smart.So should President Trump have US Justice Department arrest billionaire convicted felon George Soros for inciting riots and paying for thug who riot in major cities across the US. The paid Soros thugs did $100,000 plus in damages at Berkley College two weeks ago. The lawlessness angry liberals need to stop and stop now. Soon they will get their heads cracked open if they keep it up and start filling up our jails.http://www.independentsentinel.com/soros-behind-56-groups-running-womens-march that left trash everywhere and trashy nasty signs"

"I know several engineers in the field who have worked for HAL for years, some for decades. They think Miller is a clown, and hate him. Many have left. some formed their own companies and I know many more that are looking. one is a close relative, so i'm very close to it. they have met him, been to awards trips with him, etc..... they think he's clueless.. dont know the an myself, but I DO know some very smart people want to get away from him."

"I recently bought this stock at 32 and here it is today, down about another point.Recently, the ceo said that he thinks that we have seen the bottom. I think that hewas looking at the bottom up. Good bad or indifferent, management is paid to produce and not reduce. Maybe they should put the company up for sale and we should hope for the best, but I fear that may be too late. This recent drop in price goes beyond the current issues with China. I thought about buying it lower and sitting on it, but I don't think that will happen. I'd go to another oil company first."
"Bought another 1,000 shares of HAL at $9.80. Two big down days and a weekend in the middle, means Monday will be a big day. When they report the improvement with the Coronavirus and business start to open... up we go again. Never bet against the USA ."

"This is going lower. Current oil demand is 4 mb/d lower and OPEC cuts 1.5 mb/d of supply. You do the math. Plus there is always cheating in OPEC. We have not hit a bottom yet!

What news are you guys anticipating from the shareholder meeting? Can it possible be good news? Highly unlikely I’m thinking it’s gonna drop after. Thoughts?

"Wilbur. Ross is a billionaire Christian man. Good for that. The talking points were to keep China deal momentum on Trumps prior day tweet on delaying them or part of them. Then he says live on CNBC no trade talks were planned to Joe that morning. Shorts are using hysteria of the red ink and panic selling to cause more panic. and laughing all the way to the bank. Every dollar down goes into short pocket. And that isn't told to the public. just nonsense about China. Sure China and Chinese are a monogamous people and loyal to the greater good of the all than one theory. And they are less independent or independent stylists. But they are high IQ high intelligence. And productive. So, they will sacrifice for China and wait out Trump. Meeting half way makes sense as per their news today. half way for now will be fine. Walmart did great and shows consumer still confident."

We just went through total capitulation. Path of least resistance is now up.
"A CEO needs to convey confidence in the company and earnings. HAL is at the current SP because the CEO is silent. If Mr. Miller would have come forward to stand up for HAL at any time over the past 2 weeks, then HAL would be at least $5 higher."
"I would guess it will go red today, or continue the downward trend to tomorrow after the pop!! I suggest you sell this little pop while you can.... not a very good report!! dead money for years to come, as ive been telling you......... this report is NOTHING to be excited about.... revenues and profits all down drastically from a year ago.... MILLER is the only one making money."
Bought HAL for 1st time. Can’t see how it can go wrong at this price...
Halliburton stock is so dead. Nothing will get this pig to move up. It is like its feet are encased in concrete.
"I love HAL! Smaller rival Halliburton also delivered better-than-expected first-quarter 2020 earnings as solid international activity offset headwinds in North America. The company reported earnings of 31 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents. Moreover, the bottom line was 34.8% higher than the year-ago figure of 23 cents."
Safest bet to make money... oil to $50 bucks ------> Hal to $18 bucks !!
This StockTrader user really wants this stock to go down. LOL
Best play is under $10

"I'm a deceptive motherf----r, here is what I wrote 17 days ago about HAL...""So I purchased at $10.25 yesterday and today at $10.10 and $9.90... I am not afraid. If the dividend is safe, the board member bought a big position and Oil prices are little by little climbing up, we have nothing to worry about. In a few months when Halliburton is at $20 -$25 we will all be saying... why did t I buy and hold ?? So at the moment all my positions are long."""
HAL is down 4.94% to 20.21

"Oh yeah, someone was asking about ValueEngine today?Avoid ValueEngine. They are mostly junk.There are many, many ratings companies out there, and many write stock reports. Quite a few are just junk and ValueEngine is one them. So is GMI / AGR, Argus, Columbine Capital, Eva Dimensions and Jefferson Research among others. All of the ones which I named will write up fancy reports (with buy, sell or hold) but won't commit to putting any actual price target in it. Many of them are also very vague on specific company information. I actually trust Thomson Reuters, CFRA, Ford Equity (although they never commit to a price target) and sometimes Zacks.Zacks plays A LOT of games on stocks. They might act like they like a stock, they may say wonderful things in some of their articles, but they will rate it a ""3"" (which is a hold). When they do actually give a stock a ""1"" or a ""2"" (buys) they will put a price target. ""Usually"", that price target is good for 3-6 months. Zacks used to put that timeframe in their reports, but they changed the format a nd stopped. Zacks NEVER gives a 12 month target (unless they specify it in an article).I don't trust (at all) BOA, Citi, Credit Suzy, Cowen and Company, UBS, D-Bag Bank, Moron Stanley, and JP Morgoons or most of the other big ones. These are ALL the mischief makers on garbage street that are covering and ruining investments. Those are the big fish (full of tricks) Guys like Cramer and the Fast Money Crew on CNBC can also be bad. In this game, where money is the object, the common shareholder is often the ""mark"", the bait and the lunch. Trust and truth are virtual unicorns in this game. I could tell a story about a Morgan Stanley rep that I had experiences with, but I won't bother......"
This stock is so so screwed
hey berry - who would have thunk it right tiger? LOL!

Schumberger SLB TO ACQUIRE HALIBURTON FOR $32 SHARE DEAL LOOMS LARGE
"Hal has hot stiff resistance at $47.5 which portends well for a bounce into the mid-$50's. Lots of bullish call options as well as a lot of favorable bias for improving earnings. HAL is better aligned to better navigate the new normal profitably and increase its market share. Yes, we have a slight over supply, but the world consumes over 95 million barrels per day and over 35 billion barrels per year. Our over supply is at most 250 million barrels year; enough for about 3 days worth of non production. Not much of a safety blanket. All the major oil companies are posed to take off. What say?"
this is looking to break out.....
We could see 17 again
LMAO..... more layoffs!! Miller is clueless ....... I told you didn't I? $15 soon! employees hate mIller..all the talent is leaving.

"… So why do Republicans hate Obamacare so much? It’s not because they have better ideas; as we’ve seen over the past few weeks, they’re coming up empty-handed on the “replace” part of “repeal and replace.” It’s not, I’m sorry to say, because they are deeply committed to Americans’ right to buy the insurance policy of their choice.No, mainly they hate Obamacare for two reasons: It demonstrates that the government can make people’s lives better, and it’s paid for in large part with taxes on the wealthy. Their overriding goal is to make those taxes go away. And if getting those taxes cut means that quite a few people end up dying, remember: freedom!"

"Here MANNY..... educate yourself! posting rig counts usually go down in the third Q is simply wrong.... regardless, its irrelevant anyway.... here is what is much more important ! no charge for the education.US Oil Rig Count is at a current level of 710.00, down from 713.00 last week and down from 863.00 one year ago.

Sam wants to talk about baggies. I'll bet hes holding shares of overvalued FAANG before the big crash. At least this company already sits at 10 year lows. when the bottom falls out on the hyped stocks the real pain and suffering will begin. About that time is when oil will be on the rise again too. Imagine that.

You might think this is junk but before you hit the back button give this post a chance. PVHO could be the most undiscovered stock in the whole market today. They just posted record revenues and in addition to that they have partnerships with huge national brands. Their 3d hologram advertising technology is unrivaled right now. Take a deeper look into PVHO today!
When whomever is selling halliburton is done this is going to spike three or four dollars way undervalued at these prices
No support at 24. dang back to 23 we go... Everyone knew the analysts would lower there price because they were too high. I do like how HAL maneuvering through this difficult environment.

"“Competent lawyers might tell you that your Muslim ban is unconstitutional,” Krugman writes. “Competent scientists that climate change is real; competent economists that tax cuts don’t pay for themselves; competent voting experts that there weren’t millions of illegal ballots; competent diplomats that the Iran deal makes sense, and Putin is not your friend. So competence must be excluded.”The election was not just a triumph of bigotry, Krugman posits, but a rejection of experts, careful thought and anything that smacks of intellectualism. Too elite, apparently."

"Is the bottom in? Look at the price action on May 31st, June 5th, June 12th, and July 18th. You can tell that the support is between $21 and 21.50 and on all four of those days it came down there and bounced up. Those four days represent really good support. Now, if it goes down to the lower end of $21 per share and holds, then we have a floor of support and this can move higher. If it reaches $21 per share and goes lower, then I'm afraid we've got a multi-year low and that $21 could become resistance. Let's hope it moves up on Monday on earnings."
"Since 9/20/17 the CEO has purchased 176,900 shares and has sold 110,726 shares. He currently owns 518,360 shares. This information is on nasdaq.com."

POP that CHERRIES!
"Looks like a ton of traders jumped in here today looking for a quick buck. The real money will be made by the long term investors here. Stick around, traders. The dividend can't be beat. Personally, it wouldn't bother me if it traded flat tomorrow, just to get rid of the traders that suddenly showed up. Too many to mention. Happens regularly with story stocks. The regular posters know what I mean. Long and strong for years, myself. Approval is imminent. That's when we see the real move higher. Most of the traders won't be around to see it, especially if it doesn't happen by late Friday. Looking forward to the CC tomorrow. They could even raise the dividend. All the gains will be made by the patient investors here. Many of the sudden bulls have no idea that GILD is not a one-trick pony. All eyes are focused on only Remdisiver right now, and that's okay. But most of the sudden bulls will be long gone before the next dividend gets paid. I am long and strong with my 1600 shares. Probably less shares than some of the long-term holders, but, it is a nice place to be in. Approval gets us closer to $100 a share, and that is a reasonable prediction. For now. Good luck to the investors here. You know who you are . The advent of commission-free trading has some people to trade in and out several times a day, for pennies. Kind of a waste of time to me. I refuse to be stuck to my screen every moment of the trading day. Long, strong, and let it go. So far, so good! The tiny short interest ratio here just got lower today! Hang on for the ride, fellow investors. This one is just getting started!"
isn't this 2009 low? electric vehicles are overated not even 1% of car ind. but guess I can wait little longer since covid19 isn't over yet.

"I?ve opened long positions in SLB & HAL over the past week. I?ve watched them both over the years and feel like oil demand / supply will definitely rebalance over the next 6 months & seeing HAL under 10 caught my attention. I?m leaning into HAL a bit more because I feel Fed & Treasury will backstop US energy producers & Saudis & Russians must get oil back to 40-50 range I'm confident those two - by hook or by #$%$ - will find a way to do so! Not to be political but my biggest fear is cnn and Dems keep economy closed so long that airlines, banks and local govts fail & we're all $&@;My best hedge right now is a heavy short on LUV as the pain of flying empty planes is going to increase & they are reluctant to lay people off."

Oil will have a moment soon.
Heading towards $28.
Hal heading to 50. Strong BUY!
"Just looked at Stockconsultant to see if there is any relief. Doesn't seem to be in the cards. After all of the selling, they view HAL as only 30% Long and ""Neutral"" overall. That usually means no snapback rally in the cards yet. They have been showing HAL as oversold almost since it started on Monday. Don't forget that HAL has been burrowing downwards since late May. They show 2 short targets. the first at $41.26 and the second at $40.08. We are past both of them now. There is no breakdown watch, but that would be the next thing if she doesn't stabilize quickly here. (I would still predict the 52 week low, because the shorts are close and, believe me, I'm sure they KNOW it.)"
"Analysts average rating ""BUY"" with average price $42. Don't sell Long."
Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned HAL in the daily newsletter.

"The elitist, radical-liberals kicked out all of the moderate Dems and are an extremist left party now. The last Kennedy Democrat was Joe Lieberman and he was unceremoniously kicked out but ran and won one term as an Independent. Obama's only lasting legacy was creating an extreme left party that has lost 1,064 seats nationwide in his 8 years in office. A party that cares most about Syrian refugees, global warming and transgender bathrooms doesn't care about America."

Ha ha Lenny the loser troll poster for years on HAL board-- Trump won and You and dishonest Hillary lost. Sweet :) so very sweet.
Can anyone say irrational exuberance
"With so much Surplus with Oil right now, how do we expect this to horse back up right now. They are saying one more month and we are at capacity for oil storage. The operators are saying they will have shut off the taps soon, therefore no more drilling right now, no more completions, cementing etc. I think this goes lower and yes I plan on buying some on the dip."
Golden cross yesterday. up from here big time.
Can HAL open in the green just once this month? Damn!
"Very bullish on this stock for the next 12 months. The crash in March was the most significant flush ever in terms of volume. $4.25 was a true bottom. Since then, it's been a rhythmic uptrend. The spikes have been on good volume and it treads water on the down days. Bought 50 contracts of calls on monday expiring Jan 2021 at the $12.50 strike. Paid $2 for them. Im up well over 10% so far. Loving the trend"

"HAL, my all time favourite, always shows high degree of volatility, still holding some from low 26"
"its funny how someone said they got laid off probably fired because haliburton is hiring lots, Elizabeth warren full of hot air and where does she get hal doesn't pay taxes she needs to learn how to read a return, false info is slander democratic party has lost their minds...all I can say is ummm oil hits that 74 mark we will be over 30s-40s a share"
"Heath lts volatile to swing trade for sure. Buy 2K shares and trade Monday. If drop at bottom, if a beat going up premarket. Something AH says I was right to shed shares. It will have upside because we need drillers. We need oil and gas. Hard to even understand the Conf Call with SLB with all the French speaking in attempted English.

"Omg, the mother of all short squeezes is coming."
This stock is under accumulation by the big boys. They drove down the price this morning to shake out weak hands and accumulate shares.
I've got a feeling that HAL is in trouble. Just read the recentreport. Seems like more money is going out than coming in.Where is the CEO. Do they have one?
"well, actually - it is 4 -4 right nowso your post is not accurate nancy dave"
There is no reason that we should not be back to 30 by the year endBut we better in double digit soon first
Halliburton stocks should be below five dollars a share no profits dividends in Halliburton no worth holding for years

"Well, buckle-up kiddies.......we will know in less than 12 hours from now. The Nikkei is down by 1% already; which isn't a great sign. If stupid trump pulls some more of his stupid moves with tariffs then that might hobble our markets further. Oil is up over 70 at the moment, which would be a tail-wind for HAL. No telling where it will be tomorrow morning before the open. Earnings tomorrow is very important here. It's the gateway into the end of Summer and into the Autumn moves for HAL. Overall folks, I am hoping for good things from HAL. I know that they had news months ago about a deal that they signed with either UAE or Bahrain about providing for drilling at offshore sites in the area of those 2 countries. I would expect that like many other oil companies HAL was smart enough to hedge at a certain oil price and guarantee profits from anything that they could sell at the hedge price. It's how the smaller frackers have been keeping their noses above water. Smart business, and I would expect no less from HAL. It might (MIGHT, I say) be a BIG week coming up here. And that could be true for either direction. BOL to all longs here."

Below 9/11 prices!
HAL at 8 year low. How low can it go ?
Run Forrest run ... here comes $30.
"This will take a hit this week most likely.. probably back down to $14-15, depending on what the EIA reports tomorrow. However, this is on a bullish trend upward on the day charts. This should be $16-18 by end of the month."
"On July 9th Barclays analyst David Anderson maintained a Buy rating on Halliburton on July 9 and set a price target of $33. The company’s shares closed yesterday at $23.85, close to its 52-week low of $20.98."
HAL reached a 52 Week low at 6.36
"Sideways to lower till Valentine's Day, then depending on crude prices my start to rise ( imo), but you never know with the pump party market these days"

"This week in Trump’s America: Hitting the 2020 campaign trailWelcome to month two, which looks eerily like month one."
Folks hang on to Halliburton!! This a great company that will back a fast comeback to $25 soon. The saudis and Russians will have a deal soon and oil will bounce back to $50 this will bring HAL to $25 - $28 !!! Shorts will be burned today !! Buy and hold.

"Liberal angry democrats can learn from Booker T. Washington who grew up in difficult circumstances but retained the vision of getting an education. Rather than feeling as a victim of difficult circumstances, he obtained an education and later went on to develop and grow a school in Tuskegee, AL with only minimal money and other resources. Instead of engaging in arguments and resentments, he chose to focus his energy on the vision of education. Among his many inspirational quotes is the one - “I shall allow no man to belittle my soul by making me hate him.”"

HAL is up 13.03% to 7.46
HAL made money in the first qtr when oil was in the high $40's to mid $50's. 2nd qtr begins and the price of oil has been in the $60's the whole time. If a person doesn't think that HAL's services are being used by the O&G industry at the current prices then they have completely lost their minds. Today may have been caused by Trump's comments but no one listens to him anymore except his base. I'd be buying more if I could at these prices.

"Unfortunately, I have not seen any upgrades thus far. I have other places to check."
pleasantly surprised and happy at the action on haliburton lately......a cheap stock price speaks volumes to the buyers....certainly!!
HAL won’t make it thru 2021 without filing BK. No end in sight of travel restrictions due to Covid.
Will Halliburton go back too 50 again?
"yes, remember baggies.....you are always right! its the market that just doesn't understand. always catch the falling knife, like warren buffet does.!"

"If oil tanker stocks are declining as they are today because of the agreement to cut production starts today, wouldn’t that end up suggesting oil stocks should go in the opposite direction."
Headed to the Bottom! Just like SLB
"those who think oil will not come back are complete morons..People all over the world are tired of this shelter at home BS, they may social distance but never happen stay and wait it out for years. People will be out driving every day more than ever, less flying, more vacations driving across the country, more trains than planes, and same will happen across the world one country at a time. Demand will be much stronger than expected, analysts will come out pushing all oil stocks in 2-3 months and we will see highs for the year.. Russia and Opec desperately need the cash and they may cut some more ... it is game on for them !! and guess what, HAL RIG NIV LB will do amazing. Get in now and buy your dream house and Ferrari later :)"
Just bought 49-strike puts on this piece of garbage.
This is going to single digits... what a mess!!!
Oil companies over drilling again.
Trumps winning for America what's wrong with that
HAL reached a 52 Week low at 17.91
"I got into $41, now 35% loss and keep loosing. Do I have to sell now and return later?"
This will be OVER 20.00 by weeks end. china considering sending navy in the Strait of hormuz to escort their tankers. USA and Britain already there. And Russia. Flotila of targets and any small mistake could escalate an attack. Raising OIL prices significantly. Ships can't turn on a dime especially these destroyers. 4 navys is not mix for security. IRAN could easily upset the oil flow. HAL WILL THEN GO UP FAST . Tankers are going to be scrutinized for illegal oil going to China/North KOREA. HOLD AND BUY AND SHORTS WILL COVER. ITS JUST NATURE OF THE BEAST TO HAVE SHORTS EXPLOIT GOOD STOCKS AND RECOVERINGS ARE FAST AFTER CATALYST LIKE ABOVE OCCUR. Good luck longs.
I hope now everyone realizes what a disaster this is!!!
well well Sammy boy! your here to bash this stock?? wow

"Found this article (below).Is this supposed to be some consolation prize for an 8% beat-down which we take today????It's a good article, but it doesn't really help the lumps that I am sporting today...._____________________________________________Boom Times Really Are Coming for Oil-Field Service GiantsBY MarketWatch— 2:29 PM ET 07/23/2018You can never be too rich or too thin, but is it possible for business to be too good?That appears to be the case, at least temporarily, for the world's three leading oil-field services firms. Halliburton (HAL) rounded out the trio's reports about second-quarter results Monday morning, and its stock promptly sold off by 8% in early trading.Two-and-a-half years after oil prices hit their cyclical trough, the sector should be thriving. Yet, while there was impressive sales growth and plenty of upbeat commentary (https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-oil-industry-prepares-for- a-revival-1532110557) from executives, investors in Halliburton (HAL), Schlumberger(SLB) and Baker Hughes(BHGE) a GE Company still await the payoff.Since the beginning of 2017, the world's leading oil exporters have succeeded in slashing inventories and boosting oil prices while production forecasts for the booming U.S. shale patch have been revised higher repeatedly. The global natural-gas market has stabilized, too, after being hit by worries about oversupply.The three companies have put in a total performance since the beginning of 2017 of negative-22% or some 50 percentage points below the S&P 500. By contrast, during the year-and-a-half leading up to July 2014, the end of the last oil boom, they rallied 89% on average. Expectations were too high at the start of the current upturn. Analysts' consensus forecast for combined 2018 earnings per share for the group has dropped by 39% since February 2017, according to FactSet.Part of the problem is that the world's hottest oil patch, U.S. shale, faces shortages of truck drivers, railcars and fracking materials.""I learned more about sand logistics (https://www.wsj.com/articles/halliburton-warns-of-earnings-hit-due-to-delays-in- sand-delivery-1518711799) than I ever thought I would,"" said Halliburton (HAL) Chief Executive officer Jeff Miller on his company's call with analysts.Such market tightness is normally wonderful for oil-field services companies, but a lot of the rewards are flowing to others such as truck drivers scoring raises and big signing bonuses. Meanwhile, the big, sophisticated, largely international projects in which all three companies specialize suffered sharp cutbacks after the oil bust.Now that is finally changing, making all three companies more interesting. Schlumberger chief Paal Kibsgaard, for example, said it has ""been quite a while since we were able to kind of talk as optimistically about the international market as we can now."" He said equipment being mobilized today for an integrated drilling project will leave them with no spare capacity by the end of this year.Meanwhile, hot North American areas like the Permian Basin, while they will keep growing, are entering a period of slower growth as pipeline capacity rushes to catch up with the increase in output.The sweet spot for the industry was delayed, but it is nearly here. Investors should take advantage of the sector's temporary weakness before it gets priced in.Write to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com (mailto:spencer.jakab@wsj.com)-Spencer Jakab; 415-439-6400; AskNewswires@dowjones.com (END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-23-18 1429ET Copyright (c) 2018 Dow Jones & Company, Inc."

Buy now.
HAL should buy HOS ! Great investment and they could get it for pennies on the dollar !!
And MF said this will be a loser in June. What fools they are.
Stock market getting hammered has to be Obama's fault!!
Bad day for HAL to report. Although SLE faired well under the same conditions. Div cut will help cash but headwinds are going to crush this for the week. Getting ready for a great buying opportunity.
I see $25 soon
Halliburton is down 5.22% to 13.97
New 52 week low. Of course!
"Miller is clueless......I know several field engineers for Hal.... they ALL think he's a fool, and has no business being CEO....... and hes chairman and president......they all know thats stupid....so does Wall Street !! its a dead money company as long as he is there."

I agree and Ronald Reagan was rated the best president since World War II."
"Bought another 2,000 shares of HAL at $9.90, -What a deal !! Folks its almost at the price the board member purchased the $3 million bucks. Oil prices will go up in early summer."
"55,000 HAL employee's in 2nd largest Oil servicing business knows this company value is higher than current price. USA shale drilling boom will drive stock value much higher this year."
We are in a bear rally that will end soon. It’s going to take much longer for the USA  economy to be like it was before the Coronavirus. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/29/stock-surge-is-bear-market-rally-that-will-collapse-james-bianco-warns.html
ouch.... downward we go !! dead money......
Why market not open now
"Wall street has a short memory. HAL beat on earnings with better revenue and upcoming qtrs look just as good, solid company. SP will go back into the mid $30's soon. Perfect example of a company stock being on sale."
"Load up HAL , APA these stocks will go back up later. Great stocks!"
"Well,here we go again : A hurricane or Tropical storm -> The gas rigs and refinement closing up to avoid environmental damage, making orders of equipment from HAL to avoid it at all cost -> storm goes by leaving damage-> everything turned on, fixing damages, more orders to HAL"
Great company.

BrianJeff Miller did a really great job because he was honest and very believable. This stock should be $30 in a couple of weeks if we don’t have a market meltdown. The only thing he raved about was their technology and when you couple that with the abundance of patent filings and the fact that Schlumberger selected a technology guy as their next CEO. Says HAL is beating SLB with technology and they will grab international market share. Any thoughts?
"21.10 2010 low, maybe support."
"One bad investment, erode your $$$$Where is the bottom?"
This would double instantly if war with Iran?
Wow -- this seems way way overdone! When I bought shares at $30 a month or so ago -- I thought that was good deal!
Amazing that this is down 74% YTD like it or not the oil in the ground will be pumped eventually. Just not by the current indebted shale plays. Going to take a while but HAL isn’t going to go bust anytime soon.

Sucks.
New investors and especially HAL Employees should increase purchases from weekly checks and use stock credits to buy cheap shares and get a 10% return in couple months. That is excellent return. Turn this correction around and buy. Safe steady growth up from here.
"Oil price changed like mad cow. HAL is low, low. Any hope for oil industry?"
nice day for hal
HAL will be above $20 before the end this Oct.
I keep adding gradually
Added HAL & SLB both for a long position! If they go really lower I'll add more!Without investors companies can't grow but when growth comes investors will benefit.
"FAKE NEWS,,,,,, PEOPLE NEXT STOP $18.00 DOWN $11.00IT IS OVER."
"THREE DAY RULE.....after bad news...wait three days. THAT said, charts look like support here at $40.60.....................if it holds and hurricane season coming..............easily goes up and test the 50 and 200 day averages around $47."
better sell the pop....... $19. ....
"I don't think Hal will go far below $11 a share..... at least in the next year..... could go to single digits in 18 months.... Sales, margins plummeting... massive debt..... terrible CEO who cant be fired.... Oil demand slowing while supply is everywhere.... the world is going electric..... cars, busses, trucks.....etc.... ...like investing in buggy whips!! they were a hot item 100 years ago... not so much anymore......"

Has HAL's dividend been reduced or eliminated?
"Brian says $21 by Friday , guaranteed !! LMAO..... only a complete fool would make such a call. I'll bet all you want on that!"
Halliburton to 13+ today
"Is there anyone still delusional out there about HAL closing ""green"" today?I just hope that we are not still closing ""red"" by Friday..... Chevy, you think that you are ruined because you bought at $41.75 ???Well, my buy was back in the 50's! How ruined is that ???I cannot even begin to calculate how many quarters of dividends which I will have to collect before my position sees the green of profit again! ."
Halliburton is down 8.16% to 13.27
Nice action to end the day.
Halliburton is down 6.95% to 11.64
HAL is down 4.91% to 21.87
Someone just bought a million dollars worth of shares in the aftermarket. Someone knows something!
Oil and gas are up yet HAL and SLB are down. Can't seem to get a break.
"New upgrade today B Rileys Tom Curran says"""" BUY"""""" at $51.00 stock price. Big oil Exxon and Chevron report tommorrow. They sure use HAL everyday and price of HAL going up."
You will see big profit taking today after the unemployment numbers. HAL will eventually cut its dividend in the 3rd quarter. Shell just announce that it cut its dividend. HAL has gone from $8.25 to $11.90 in 3 days. Expect a big pullback today.
This company is heading for BK. That dump “conviction buy” from GS simply means they are now shorting it...
"and we hit the TEENS, as predicted!... that didn't take long! nice work MILLER !! next leg to $15 ! I have to laugh at the analysts with targets at $30 and above.... hilarious.... they are always wrong...85% of targets are never reached within the year...fact!"
$HAL Upgraded by Piper Sandler Neutral » Overweight USD 22
According to the news tweedy Browne investment fund is gifting you halliburton shares below 20 bucks they cut their Hal position by 2/3 hard to imagine selling halliburton at a five-year low so if you have money at tweedy Browne you might rethink it
Hal went from it’s all time low 4.78 to 12 dollars a share in 2 months. That’s a 130 percent profit. Things are looking up. Everything is opening up. People are ready to take a trip somewhere and get out of the house. People are going back to work. Government leaders are saying they are more than likely to approve another stimulus sometime in June. Trump is not going to let this economy look bad under his name. Once a 2nd stimulus package is approved Hal will be near 16 a share or more. Just bought 3006 more shares. Get in while you can. Scared money don’t make no money. Don’t regret not jumping on at this price later down the road.
No support for oil prices --- OIl headed under $30 in a few weeks. This is headed sub 10.. Easy!
This stock has been disappointing....
AMERICA ALREADY HATES TRUMPTHIS IS A SAD FACT
Is this where we will hold it from further selling ?
HAL is good company stay calm need some time
Sell Puts @22?
"LMAO.......not going to be above $20 today !! EVNGSUN.... AKA T....the self professed professional day trader who makes 5 figures a day, seems to have gone underground.....T just came online yesterday !!! the beauty of yahoo.... make a fool of yourself, just open anther yahoo account and change your name!! right T? lol.. have a nice day!"
Micheal... just remember that HAL was at $8.25 only 2 days ago !! Tomorrow will be a down day simply because we need a Market break and the new unemployment claims will not be pretty !!
That’s the last time you saw 18’s. Next time you see you will be 5 years older
"yes, just like I said..... above $22, was a shorts gift ! nice quick slaughter of the sheep."
Any ideas of what we will see today? Thoughts?
Sharing this HAL graphic i found - http://alph.st/b029a496
Lets review : Obama worked diligently to stir up racism in America.Terrible president. Absolutely terrible.The left loves to play the race card. Obama divided the country more than any president in US history.
" President Trumps great job numbers The first monthly jobs report to reflect the state of the economy during the Trump presidency is quite good. There’s not much to dislike about the 235,000 jobs added in February, nor an unemployment rate that ticked down to 4.7 percent, nor an average hourly earnings rise of 0.2 percent."
"At least some of the geezer pukes haven't figured out that HAL is now open. I wonder how long before Blobby Hill, tommy Arthur simmons , Harry RN, puckles and koko come back?"
How is SLB green yet HAL is still down $.50? Oil and gas prices have stabilized too.
"I only made $980 today; far below my daily average. Oh, well. Can't win 'em all!"
"My avg is 9.40, should I double down to bring it down at this point?"
POS!
"EPA job killing regulations get illuminated with the stroke of Trump's pen today. Clean coal again as coal miners go back to work. Oil drillers start drilling again, Keystone pipeline gets completed cheap gas for decades go Trump go.  sweet cheap energy."
SPEAKING OF MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN - OBAMA HADD 75 MONTHS IN A ROW OF JOB GROWTHTRUMP TOOK CREDIT FOR THE LAST ONEYOU OLD GEEZERS ARE FUNNY!
My bet is on a Monday take off !!
I am now going to Sell into this 4% rally and leave until shorts leave this sector . Took loss and into weed sector. Good luck holding in rigged market. Tell your congress person to reinstate the uptick rule.

I don't know if the Motley Fool piece is correct, but please check it out anyways and see what you think. __________________________Halliburton tumbles on weak outlook for the second halfShares of oil services provider Halliburton fell 8.1% after the company beat expectations for revenue on Q2, but gave a lower-than-expected outlook for the second half of the year. Revenue increased 24% to $6.15 billion, compared with the $6.11 billion observers were expecting, and earnings per share came in at $0.58, matching the analyst consensus. On the conference call, CEO Jeff Miller said the company expects Q3 EPS to be about flat with Q2, but analysts had been expecting $0.10 more.Compared with the first quarter, revenue by the completion and production segment increased 9% to $4.2 billion, and operating income grew 34%. Drilling and evaluation revenue was up 3% sequentially with a 2% gain in operating income. North American revenue grew 9% due to increased onshore drilling activity, and international revenue increased 4%.The disappointing profit forecast for next quarter was due partly to a shortage of pipeline capacity in the Permian basin, a growing problem for producers in the region, and cost inflation caused by a shortage of trucks and drivers. Halliburton also said there is a softening of activity in the Marcellus due to producers hitting production targets earlier than planned, a concern that came as a surprise to analysts.Halliburton officials expressed optimism for 2019, saying that headwinds in the second half were temporary conditions that will set the stage for big gains next year. Investors, however, weren't willing to look past the short-term issues today.More From The Motley Fool"

"Short data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU : XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"

Pure fixed by algos keeping it around 21.00 for option expiration even though oil skyrocketing. Shorts will be covering since they can't predict Trump and oil prices. Both high beta's. And oil expected to go up again. Senator Graham will mess up Iran deal. He's too right wing fanatical.
Pathetic performance today. Largest WTI gain in history and HAL up .19 cents. GEEEEEEEZ

why can't this be up $2??? why go to a conference and tell negative things?? is the CEO short HAL??? these managers are morons. They can't think to save their lives. Oil will be 100 and this junk 35.
"With oil price so low, the wells need to be capped. Who will do the service? Hal.When oil price goes up later, the wells need to be reopen. Who will do the service? Hal."
hal for sale my guess ...due to price movement
HAL is at 4K RPM but stuck in neutral .
I own 450 shares @ 10.98 per share. Will by more as this rises higher.
In 1998 oil was $10-12 barrel. HAL is not Weatherford -- They will survive.
31c reported vs 24c expected
Big layoff yesterday and today at Houston headquarters. Heard it was a 20% reduction for IT department.

HI NANCY!
Obama is ranked #12 as all time best presidents - the klan and the russians disagree though
Oil looks to be heading back above $60. Will HAL return to $32-34 area it was at before earnings? I'd like to think so but the CEO is neither visible nor positively communicating with Wall Street.
Bot POTUS said it is a HOAX......No more debates TG.....
HAL maybe the last time this year to buy at this low price. I predict $ 13+ in the next couple weeks.
Why Apache and SLB stay ahead of HAL?
CEO should resign.
"Hey, a great site to see insider activity is open insider. Just type it into google. And no, I don’t get paid, just spreading the love. It’s actually where I saw Hal’s guy buy his 350,000 shares."

"mares - Still my little trained monkey I control In the jungles of Africa, monkeys are captured alive and unharmed via the use of a heavy bottle with a long neck and sweet-smelling nuts within. Attracted by the scent of the nuts, the monkey sticks his hand in the bottle and grabs the nuts. Unwilling to let go of the nuts, the monkey is unable to remove his hand from the bottle. Subsequently, with the bottle being so heavy, the monkey is trapped since he can’t carry the bottle. Again, all that is needed is to just let go of the nuts. Instead, the monkey holds onto the nuts in exchange for a life of captivity. Holding on to failed liberal democrat polices and losers like Hillary & Obama."
Nothing better than shorting a company with bad management and wining on it! This has been going down for years and will continue downwards soon enough.
Great volume again today. Institutional buyers coming in strong down here as oil prices approach new all-month highs.
Could someone explain to me why it keeps rising? Isn’t oil supposed to go down?

I'm monitoring June and July. If this trickles over RUN
I hope it closes above $22 today?
Saudi has agreed to reduce 1M barrel a day has resulted it hike in Oil price and makes Permian Oil very attractive. HAL is a strong player in Permian and hence the stock price hike
"yes, its a slaughtering of the sheep. everyone that said this couldn't, wouldn't, happen is getting a brutal lesson in markets and commodities. Also, a lesson in poorly managed companies.... I know at least 50 people that work for Hal and the sand Fracing business.... and they dont haul dirt. they are management and engineers in the field all over the Permian and the world. NOT ONE has a good thing to say abut MILLER! they have fought for change and lost every time.... many have started side companies. These are some of the best in the world , and most are looking to do something else. they see the writing on the wall, and have for 2 years.... MILLER is the main problem."

Bankruptcy soon for Halliburton? Seems like they won’t be able to handle the debt load wire oil this low... Thoughts?
"Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers had some kind words for the Trump economic policies and praises the Trump Administration for saving jobs and cutting crazy spending. In a wide-ranging interview in his offices at Harvard University, Summers called the new administration’s pronouncements on strengthening the military for instance as a Very Smart move“potentially helping keep Russia Iran and North Korea in check."
what a painful slow drip all day
HAL is down 4.90% to $25.81
"SADLY this hasn't bottom. If you want to be OIL and want stocks that have bottomed lock to FRAC SAND. Actually improving outlook, 2018 was bad with the switch from NWS to In-Basin. The SAND stocks are already priced for bankruptcy. I like $CVIA who has been selling at nearly 3x sales when the whole company trades at .11x sales. I like $HCR because they are buying back shares. I also like $FTSI for a buyout. $HAL hasn't hit that point this can drop to $10. Diversify your OIL holdings. SAND is all completion!!! The drillers are the worst right, there will be no more drilling. SO many DUCs well anyway, not needed. Diversified oil services ok, but SAND, they need sand and more SAND to finish those wells."
"I think the market is “HIGH,” all of my druggy s are up, and ALL of my straight stocks are down."

Would be great to get to 30 this week. Put the 20s behind us. Set a new precedent and create a bullish pattern. Lets hope for a newfound resurgence for markets this year
This will go lower. The company has a debt of $10.5B and a market cap of $13.5B. So effectively shareholders value that Mr Market is assigning is only $3B. In my view better investments are BKR and SLB. There debt position with reference to market capitalization is much better. I strongly believe HAL will continue to underperform the other two companies unless offcourse the market recovers and oil prices rise substantially.
"If I’m not mistaken, one of their executives purchased about 1 million worth of their shares between 6-7$ ranges"

Anyone knows when we can get dividend?
I am assuming HAL will double as soon as the coronavirus bell curve flattens. Means 1 month from now
Did anyone check on Sam? Has he jumped off a bridge yet?
Do any of you actually know what hal does? Seems like it's all about the numbers that your fed.

Dead money for at least another six months.
Does it still pays dividends?
"absurd beyond all comprehension. empty white board. robust mentioned a hundred times. well positioned mentioned 200 times. buzz like you would get from a 9th grader econ major from the 90s. when I heard this same song 3 or 4 months ago, that was the alarm bell that kept me from falling into this trap. I suspect you will hear it all over again 3 or 4 months from now. and that is why the market has sold the snot out of this company then, and again, today. getting any kind of confidence back from investors won't happen anytime soon. sorry for the employees or others that may have sacrificed tens of thousand of dollars due to this nonsense. I was not one, as I had heard enough stupidity 3 or 4 months back. adieu."

"Agreed, Mark."
HAL is down 12.38% to 5.38
"So I purchased at $10.25 yesterday and today at $10.10 and $9.90... I am not afraid. If the dividend is safe, the board member bought a big position and Oil prices are little by little climbing up, we have nothing to worry about. In a few months when Halliburton is at $20 -$25 we will all be saying... why did t I buy and hold ?? So at the moment all my positions are long. SDC, BBBY, AAL, HAL and SPY. It’s now a matter of patience and seeing this positions grow with time. I love  this game. Monday will be a good day as the USA  and part of Europe opens up for business. Have a great weekend everyone !!"
"With solid analysts’ backing, more new projects, a nice dividend and a pps not seen in years, this has become a must Buy for both short and long term."
"That is why DJIA, S&P, NASDAQ are all setting record highs. Your logic is right on . NOT !!!"
SAM! you are corrected again. (above 22 is a gift) Closed today 21.03HAL back to normal 20.53? up from 17.
"HAL should be under $3 within the next 2 - 4 weeks! Oil dead for a long long time folks! Breadlines are starting, so there will be no need for oil for the next 12 - 18 months, or until a vaccine is available. Until then, Depression!!"
20 this week easy.
"EVNGSUN.... I cant stop laughing!! you said you were SURE HAL would be above $20 at end of October!!... you, the proclaimed day trader that makes 5 figures a day... so you say!! what happened?? and where did you run off to?"
Bottom here at 42.85 on high volume at 12:50p. Let's rally into the close.
HAL is a teenager again.....I guess the shale fracking thing was over rated....... no money to be made unless you are a banker
"HEY, you want pain...look at PTEN today...down 8% and hitting 52 week lows..........that is misery!"
Looks like a lot of bullish gamblers here. You had better only buy a bear minimum. Strong chance this will fall under 5 again.
I don't get it. WHY IS HAL ALWAYS DOWN THE MOST BY % AND UP THE LEAST BY %?
Let's see $42's again soon...It is overdue.
SAM!!! Wow. ! What happen to HAL ?
"Bought another 1,000 shares of HAL to average down. It’s always the same thing the little guy panics and gives his shares cheap to the big boys. This is the opportunity to buy and hold, it’s not the end of the world folks."

"Sam I was wrong. I admit it not hard to see that in this market selloff. I have been wrong before as most are. Note that. This is not good for USA investors ,jobs, economy, government local and federal . And markets need back stopped from federal reserve and treasury to prevent escalation and further market declines. I understand its profitable to be on down side but I and alot of others took wrong side risk and will be here for long time it seems. If you would have posted informatively I would have listened. Often shorts on the MB's just exude hate and thats not helpful. Clearly you saw signs. The inverted bond rate yield curve can indicate recession in 18 months. But there also can be quick recovery and a run too. Powell, Kudlow, Mnuchin need to consider a truce with trade. Help China to help ourselves. Global growth can be revived. I feel the pain and can only hope longs have seen the bottom here below 10 year lows. No reason for this. 18.68 was 10 year low. And now deeper. Anyway Sam if you made money congratulations. We are men and this is a game of risk. I disagree that 15 is bottom. But clearly I was wrong we won't see 21.00 Friday. Unless Trump tweets China tariffs all completely removed. Maybe now isn't the time during an election cycle to change the norm. Good luck everyone invested long. Wow, . This is untested times for me and others. Especially I wish for good luck to Haliburton."

Folks HAL will be heading down and fast !! They are estimating a big loss for next quarter and oil prices are very low. The fact that a few insiders bought means nothing for the terrible fundamentals !! Sell and lock pin your gains cause this thing is gin back to $7 $7.50 !!
20 handle oil is coming
"Handwriting is on the wall. HAL/SLB are not good investments because green energy is sweeping across the globe like wildfire. Erle P is turning over in his grave. HAL had a great run, now its someone else's turn. Like MSFT, NVDA etc etc. I'm totally in to MSFT, AMZN, GOOG, AAPL. Stocks are in their infancy and have a ten year run facing them. Just a simple fact of life."
REPUBLICANS ARE FRAUDS. EOM.
"Look at 10 year chart....this better hold $28.50, or it will go much lower."
Going green to $43's today....All the oil momentum...
HAL is up 5.87% to 21.46
President Bannon is making all the decisions.Popular vote loser Donald Trump just makes the noise.
dollars down pennies up
"Question: What will make HAL go up?Answer: HALICOPTER...I guess, this PIG needs to be lifted..."
"Likely, if HAL has good earnings, it will sell off. That has been the M.O. for the equity markets for a long while now. Do well, and you get punished. Do the opposite, and they don't seem to care. Garbage street is a non-sensical place. Additionally, the shorts have been camping out here on this one since ????? April??? May????They are not likely to give that up without a fight. HAL SHOULD have good earnings, but the stock has been out of favor for some while now. Garbage street also has a painfully short memory and attention span. If HAL has good earnings, the more appropriate question will be, ""will it be higher in 3 months time?""That answer should be, ""yes.""HAL is a solid company and takes care of their core business well. The conditions haven't been bad at all. Better in fact, than the last 3-4 years. But Schlumberge seems to be Garbage Street's ""darling"" at the moment. I have seen signs for HAL going up AND for HAL going down. Hard to tell which will come true. Most likely though, she sells off at first (even with good earnings).It would take one hell of a surprise for a sell off NOT to be the case.Good luck to all longs here...."
Should i sell my stocks and buy when it drops again?
"CEO miller is a fool......hes CEO, chairman of the board, and president!! theres your problem....he cant be fired.."
"WTI futures have hit a 1 month high at 35.83. It should be a good day for HAL, plus it's Ex-Dividend day....$$$"
This is an incredible opportunity to own Halliburton at a severe discount where is the bottom who knows but at 17.72 I’m in
Bias liberal MSNBC Fake News. What a joke. Could be why the ratings are in the toilet. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v-8EPmM8Ijk
"Yes, sam. It will go up as OIL is going up for the next several months (OPEC cuts, winter, ...)"
I bet Trumps on the phone with trade representatives and should tweet the great huge news. They want 5G huawie tariff lifted. Maybe give that for buying Ag and energy and thats half way.
I not selling until $40
"Immigrant workers, families to protest by staying home, who cares? It's not like they are closing the hospitals. But Nancy Pelosi grapes may rout on the vine and her grass on her estate will not get cut."
Sam you are such a smart guy!!!
Botton still aways..... calling $17.38 thereabouts
some positive new on controlled fusion would top the cake
"CEO needs his salary reduced by half.Signed,THE SHAREHOLDERS"
This should be easily get back to 45$
What happened to $13.80 today?
"Christopher is obviously a rube wannabe that couldn't figure out a PE, or ROI, if he had a week to do it. His comments are that of a junior achievement class for slow kids. ( no offense to you slow kids.) enjoy your losses chrisy !! you couldn't make money if you were locked up in a US Mint with a set of plates!"
"According to stock price action the last 2 months, a retail investor like myself would be led to believe that HAL lost 500 mil for qtr2, not made 500 mil profit. I understand this paticular sector trades heavy on guidance, but this is a head scratcher!!"
"Hal stock performance down -54% 12 month period.CEO SALARY 1 YEAR17,000,000.00 YES THATS 17 million dollars for this kind of performance. This is an outrage.I believe any person could run this company and do better for less"
Ok.. what about fundamentals? Do those even matter anymore?
"On listening to SLB conference call. Drilling Guidance good. ""To access the conference call, listeners should contact the Conference Call Operator at +1 (800) 288-8967 within North America"
war with Iran is on Israel's mandates for their errand boy lil boy Trump. BUY UP. HAL is going to 50.
hal going back over 30 dollars. when i do not know hopefully soon
Sell puts at $5.50?
"Bought 2K at 8 and 3K at 5.25. doubling down on 2K at 17.25, Now just waiting for the come back."
A quick question for you guy and please don't bs. Is HAL financially stable?
It would be great to hold $12 range.
TRUMP WON!! oopsie he lost the popular vote though
Welp today was bad lol
June just skidded big time to 14 and dropping fast. Not good as May expires. This could get bad if June goes negative with a month of expiry meaning the whole thing freezes.
"@sam. You are such a fool, you didn’t get my money! You assume I’m long, I’m just pointing out the obvious childish behavior of yours, get over yourself son, some of us quietly make money, aka adult behavior, enjoy"
do you guys think this will go back to 7 or should I get in now
if these companies cant make it in this economy with 3.5% unemployment how will they exist if things actually go bad. Are we just not going to have an oil industry in the US in the future? I look at the charts of all oil companies and its like a waterfall to 0
Past few days HAL has been all algorithms and the fact that people are playing the Taylor Series daily spreads.
Probably hit 20 today
MM come on let us see 24!!!!!!!!!!We will all go places using gasoline!!!!
HAL is up 11.39% to 5.14
"Well, it's like I said; good earnings and it gets sold off. I wish it weren't true, but Garbage Street is a contrarian place.It's the way that they have been doing things for a LONG while now. Ya' can't fix stupid (though I would like too. Garbage Street in NY needs a big enema).With a solid, ""good"" earnings report, prices should start moving up within a month here. Go HAL!"
"With the storm in the gulf shutting down almost everything there, we may see oil push to $42 and HAL will be touching the 20 day SMA, reversal in motion! Where we going to be in a few weeks, 14, 15?????"
November 28. 2020Biden/Harris stock market has started.There goes our 401K.
Wait for $17 - $18. ?
UP UP and AWAY WE CLIMB! HAL is a WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!
"I just loooked and realized where the 52 week low is. I hadn't realized that it was that close. And HAL has been as low as $39.40-something today?I know that this isn't going to make for happy campers, but I'll say it anyways......We are going to see a new 52 week low. Not in 3 months, or even 3 weeks..... but THIS WEEK. Bet on it. Friday, before 4PM.I don't like this any more than anyone else, but my position is completely nuked after this week. Nothing I can do about except collect dividends FOREVER, and I am NOT even about to sell this far down. I'm not adding any money to it either, especially when it's on a 3 day (or more) slide. When you find yourself in a deep hole, the first rule is to put away the shovel. Lot of dividends to come. Lots, and lots and LOTS. They are going to hit a new 52 week low. This week. BEFORE Friday's close. Get used to it. (there is NO WAY that they could be this close and let it go)"
SCHLUMBERGER RAISED HAL. BID TO $34 MERGER LOOMS LARGE
52 week stock price DOWN 46.63%. Time to replace this CEO. NOW!
"@HemiGTX and @Goldmember, remember when you talked trash yesterday after I stated that oil would drop significantly, starting ""tomorrow""? Hmmm, what happened? It appears that I was right yet again, and the massive addition of funds in my account is simple scrumptious. I also bought thousands of shares in OXY, HAL, SLB, MAR, APA, and BP. I'll make a boatload tomorrow morning, too."
What is with HAL and the energy market. HAL is stuck in neutral and no RPM.
"Any time someone writes the facts a bunch of you gives thumbs down, Why? is it that you boys can't handle the truth ?or you need to go to the bathroom ? Hee,Hee,Hee,LOL"

"HALLIBURTON COMPANY FRAUD FROM $66.00 DUMPING AND SHORTING COMPANY IS A FRAUD,,,,,NOW THE NEXT STOP FOR THIS PRICE IS 16.00 DOLLARS, TO $11.00 IT IS OVER FOR THIS COMPANY."

https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Offshore-Oil-Gas-Projects-Set-For-Record-Recovery.html
Massive value destruction happening today. The market value of HAL is now $3.8B.
"HEY EVERYONE!!! TRUMP WON!!ok, now what"
Buy at $23.5
This Investopedia article about SLB and HAL going under is crazy talk. How’s the oil getting out of the ground. And who’s going to build the wind turbines. These companies are involved in all sorts of projects. HAL is in bed with the Saudi’s and the Russians. When we beat this virus we’ll look back at this opportunity and wonder why we didn’t buy more
Come on 15 I want back in bad
"At this minute many oil stocks going up. I was down over $10k and now I’m up over $1,500. Any positive news other than these stocks are cheap?"
Hope to buy below 30 Friday
What is happening with the spike?
as long as no more sell off in the dow. hal should be safe at these levels!
What a buy out opportunity for someone!
"Bumpy rideHard to lose 10 percent in paper profits in two days after making a 20% gain three days ago. Yes, glad that it is low volume. Hal is at least a $14 stock. In 2 years it will be at least a $20 stock. ￼"
"Yes, Never down to this level $15!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! See HAL stock price change:2008/3: $502008/12: $16 (loss ~70%)2011/3: $50 (after 3 year back to 2008 level)2012/3: $30 (down 40%)2014/6: $70 (up 135% from 2012)2015/12: $32 (down ~50%)2016/12: $55 (up 72%)2017/6: $40 (down 20%)2018/3: $50 (up 20%)2020/3: $15 (down >70% similar to 2008)Analysts estimated HAL 2020 earning $1.32/share (up from $1.24 of 2019), and $1.6/share of 2021!!!! So far 3 analysts (Wells Fargo 1/9, ScotiaBank 1/6 and Stifel 1/2) upgrade HAL, average target price $26 and highest $32!!! Just read an analyst report that mentioned HAL undervalue and oversold."
"Okay, here is a signal from a group which I have used in the past, and I have trusted. The information comes from a group called Trading Central.This was updated on 07/24/18, so it's current.I would call this (pretty much) the unvarnished truth. There is a chart that goes with it (that will not print on MB's ) that shows HAL going to $37.4It is NOT a guarantee that it will go there; but I have used this source in the past for both HAL and other stocks and their accuracy is pretty good. Another look at Stockconsultant tonight shows that there is still not a breakdown watch for HAL, but there is also NO SUPPORT at the current price, or below. This thing NEEDS to find a bottom level before it can even possibly recover. I still don't think that has been established yet. Like I wrote the other day: the damage is serious here, this is no joke, and we are in a dangerous place (increasingly with the further down it goes).____________________________________Technical EventOutlook - Halliburton ST: the RSI is oversoldShort Term View: DeclineRecent Technical ChangeUnchangedMedium Term View: BearishRecent Technical ChangeUnchangedOur pivot point is at 44.8.Our preference: the downside prevails as long as 44.8 is resistance.Alternative scenario: above 44.8, look for 47.1 and 48.4.Comment: the RSI is below 30.

HAL will be trading back to $4 once they announce the suspension of the dividend for the past qtr and the quarterly loss for Q1. The future guidance will be bleak too for 2020. Sell now!
Lost 40% a single day? What a joke!
All you HAL employees use your employee discount and buy some stock. You'll increase your annual income doing so.

Does anyone know how much Hal is involved in renewables and if the majors tilt that way could Hal become a “renewable field services” company. I realize oil isn’t going anywhere but if Sleepy Joe gets in or whoever the Dem’s plug in there you could have another coal situation with oil especially in North America
Halliburton to furlough 3500 employees
Time to add HAL on the mini dip before it going back up.
President Trump talked to Putin and prince MBS. They said they will cut 10 million barrels and possibly 15 million.
Some genuine oil market analysis from Yahoo finance. It doesn't look too bad. Things could be looking up for the oil sector as a whole.

As the USA  opens up little by little this will definitely create a demand. I also read and studied the board member that made the big stock purchase and he ain’t no dummy. And last but not least is the fact that the dividend of 6.5% is safe !!! So boys & girls you got a new member on your team of Longs. Sorry for the previous short messages that were annoying.

Jeff Miller is picking up the pieces"

How far do you think it will drop will it go back below $5
Trump shouldn't let CNBC tv hosts into private discussions at White house. KUDLOW informing Cramer of inside deals. They were business partners Kudlow and Cramer TV show. . And Trump expects confidentiality?

"HAL is a good example of a Pure Earnings stock play to AVOID, IMO. They report Monday AH, and there are very few companies reporting on this date. I WANT to do as many Pure Earnings plays as I can, but at the same time I want and NEED to have good odds in my favor that the play will work out. To me, HAL is sending absolutely conflicting signals right now, as to how she will move after her ER. I need a solid indication of up or down. I don't care which way, because I feel perfectly comfortable Selling Short. But HAL is not giving me a clear direction at all. Could go up a LOT, could go down a lot even though she is already way undervalued. I have become disciplined enough to simply pass on the play, wait until Tuesday AH/Wednesday PM. Better to lose a day of Pure Earnings trading, than do a losing trade because you decided to just ""guess"". To me, HAL is a toss-up, no solid indicators of up or down, and so I reject the play."
What will the price jump be the day after earnings?
HAL is up 4.90% to 55.61
we might see 25 sooner than later!!!
what a shame that the market is relentless today. This stock looked like it had some juice today. Cant overcome market forces
What wrong is HAL it sure be in the 30 ?

just got back from road trip to Florida. traffic on way home much greater than on way there! movement is begining. reality trumps perception.
This could go much lower -- DOW / S&P 500 are not in correction territory so what is this going to be when market is down 20% or more. it's probably close to $10 -- that's when I would buy.
hope you sell this pop! it wont last...

"Yeah, there is definitely manipulation going on here. I just watched a Yahoo Finance Mid-day report video, where they claimed that HAL is down due to conference call comments about ""a bottle-neck and temporary softness"".???? I mean, just #$%$????? That doesn't jive with the other thing about margins or operating margins. HAL is down because they want it to be down, because they need it to be down. Apparently it doesn't really matter WHAT reason it's down for. But the ""funny"" part is that HAL has only been down since, May AND June AND most all of this month. When is there ENOUGH down. It's stupid. It's all just manipulation,........crazy"
Halliburton at this price is a steal while others are afraid of the sector. Oil and energy are going to remain huge sectors in society as electric cars and solar power aren't taking things over for quite some time.
"Halliburton: A Bad Beat Opportunity article today by Quad 7 capital. Take home summary "" We remain bullish and think this is a classic BAD BEAT under our philosophy of investing. While oil prices drive the major momentum in this stock and the sector for the most part, we have a rare opportunity to take advantage of a market overreaction that is mispricing the stock, in our opinion. With oil prices moving higher on the long-term chart and stabilizing in the $60 range in the near-term chart, the company should have no issue meeting our expectations. We are admittedly surprised by today's action and think the Street is wrong."""""

"So Trump setting up a Venezuela takeover. Might be positive for gold until it's done with, then all that gold will go through Western hands and not Turkey, Russia, Cuba and China.....so then that would be negative for gold after a while.

all this on news and then one day of news this could sky rocket upwards catching the bears yep cant always pick bottom but accum shares as you can

World oil price is down to near lowest... and HAL is up nicely ....meaning it is a better future ahead for HAL. To to add and hold for a year.

Halliburton seems to be out pacing SLB and BKR as the energy sector starts to recover. Going into 1/21/20 I am looking for $29-$31.
For this quarter I think HAL will have increased revenue from NorAm well completion. Rigs are down but as we have all read the is a back log of uncompleted wells in areas like the Permian and the like! Plus you have the pipeline issue. We should get good numbers in October. I wonder if hedge funds are playing this.

looks like it wont be denied today
"Time for Halliburton to do little cleanup while retaining the best talent and trimming the non value added projects. Please do not look at age, race, and color while trimming the work force. Please be fair and do the right things to survive in this economy to sustain. In couple of years things will change for better."

"Folks, those of you that think oil will stay this low better wake u. I am predicting WTI over $50 by EOY. This why I think oil will come back this year1. Virus curve needs to flatten. 3 weeks or so2. People will rush out in mid April to spend stimulus check3. Driving season starts in a month delayed by virus4. US will buy 78 million barrels for strategic reserve5. Sooner or later Saudi and Russia will come back to negotiation table. They will cut6. US Shale has no choice but to cut to survive7. At current price no one wins. Saudis need $70 oil to balance budget. They offer free healthcare and education. Putin needs cash to stay in power and US Shale needs oil between $50 and $60 to survive. And let us not forget Trump has to win Texas in November. That is why Trump is pushing for a V shape redovery"

"HAL DOWN 26%, SLB DOWN 8%. SAME #$%$ EVERYDAY. HAL DOWN MUCH MORE THAN IT'S COMPETITORS. BEYOND FRUSTRATING!!!!!"
WTI probably headed back to $50. Buy HAL in mid 20s !
HAL needs some Viagra to stay up.
I can see HAL at $45 in a year.
Management of HAL has made sensible strategic cuts in testing times and kept their dividend. Market likes this hence great strides in price.True value at HAL oil prices should be around 14-16 and back to 25+ in 6 months upon positive global news and rise in price of oil and it's demand
All it takes a few more missiles that can hit the Saudi oil reserve; then no more oil war. I wish it happens; so that karma teaches those Saudi Arab guys a lesson to learn.
"HAL has more debt than current Market Cap... unbelievable. This little pump form $8 to &10.64 in 5 days will be over soon. With oil prices below $25 it should be trading around $7, just because a director bought stock and we are seeing a bump now, it’s going to fade away soon. Sell and lock  in your gains."
Thanks you John!You all have a wonderful new year and watch out for 2020 bumpy ride.
"When Halliburton was in the 17’s people were saying they were going out of business. Thanks for your shares. They’ve been around 100 years. Do the naysayers actually believe oil is going away. We’re all going to ride bikes or walk to work. Good Lord, oil is what makes the world go round. This can be a 40 to 70 dollar company in a year from now"

"HAL E/P multiple is way below the market average. Jeff Miller CEO of HAL is doing a great job: cost cutting and fixing prior CEO Lessar over dependence on NA shale industry. This horse has some legs still in the international oil patch, doing business everywhere. Wicked awesome, while most of our boards are in the green, sam short squeeze is in the red."
So what triggered this price drop?
The only way to unlock HAL’s value is a significant beat on Monday coupled with a dividend increase and a little help from those crazy Iranians. Maybe then we can increase the low earnings multiple.
"All these analysts cutting oil and oil service stocks. Aren't they a little late? These idiots will all be upgrading them again when oil is trading at 40 to 50 a barrel by the 4th of July. They are always on the opposite side of the trade, and for that they make millions. I have a CFA and don't understand how these guys are so stupid."
Picked up some $30 January calls this afternoon for $1.19. I’m thinking they will be at the money by end of June
"A drop in oil prices is not as helpful to the U.S. economy as it was when the country was massively dependent on foreign oil. That's because the fracking revolution has made domestic oil and natural gas production a major part of the U.S. economy. A drop in prices hurts that domestic industry. It leads to less drilling, fewer jobs, cuts in factory orders and a host of aftershocks that could leave the nation as a whole worse off.The last time oil prices dropped by a comparable amount, in 2015-2016, it contributed to a slowing of economic growth from 2.9% to 1.6%Trump support the low price of oil ! for it will lower the price on gas pump. Just as he said realty fall is good the last time housing crash.That how Trump make money from GOV ball out (tax payer).HAL will go lower if Saudi and Russia keep prolong fight for more than 2 quarter from now; That frame of time will crush HAL badly. So Please watch out."
Trump is Truly a Clown.....
HILLARY WON THE POPULAR VOTE. TRUMP GROUPIES GO INSANE WITH ANGER.
"Brian Guidance is important, but it will always be trumped by execution. This industry may boil down to technology and who has the most advanced tech. 10 to 15 years ago there was plenty of business for both HAL and Schlumberger to prosper. Today is different, it’s very competitive and the company with the best technology may win internationally. I just read HAL spends a lot of time in the patent office and has filed for more patents than any of their competition. Hopefully this is an indication that they are advancing technology. I just noticed Baker Hughes trades at a PE of 63. How can that be, none of the top 3 oil service companies can be considered growth companies. If HAL could get to a PE of 18 we would be happy."
Do you think there might be little upside before dividend

"I heard that David Lesar was caught embezzling from company by using HAL $ to set up his new business, was escorted off HAL facility in Houston. I'm sure the buddy system will keep him from being charged with anything, but, will he pay back the shareholders or is this just another example of no rules for the rich and many for the rest of us???"
HAL will be back to $32 soon. GS had HAL PT at $42 not too long ago if I didn't forget.
Whatever you say but HAL needs to retrace some of its gains... maybe cover at $10.90 for a $0.70 cent gain. That’s all I need for now.
"So how low will this go? What’s scary is we’re not even in a recession, although world wide economies are slowing down, the US economy is still relatively strong. As much as this looks tempting to buy, it might just be a value trap."

Will HAL post a higher low? looks as though the price action says support is coming in. Of course oil and gas prices are not going anywhere going into the driving season so the 2nd qtr earnings should be solid and allow for HAL to run into the mid to high $30's. JMHO

"The current technical condition for HAL is weak. Although the stock has pulled back from higher prices, HAL remains susceptible to lower prices. The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bearish. HAL's chart formation indicates the stock is in a strong downward trend. Momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI, is negative. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that HAL is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of HAL. In addition, HAL is below its falling 200-day moving average."
"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"

I look at the debacle with oil and it brings back memories of what happened when the subprime market blew up. Most of the largest banks in the country saw their equity wiped out as the credit spreads widened which only accelerated the decline in equity value to the point the institution failed. Goldman Sachs was in the 60s when Bufget showed up with 5 billion and the company became a bank. That's the only thing that saved them. They need to protect the oil industry in our country because the same dynamic that took down the banks is playing itself out with oil. The sooner they start QE and stop the hoarding of bonds the sooner the 10 year will begin to rise which will end the fall in equity value.

Hundreds of them in East Ohio and Northern WV. This HAL company is solid strong and will rebound fast. Shorts are pathetic and will give up when FANG owners start diversifying into energy sector. FB drop and Netflix half of them and the start of reallocation of hedge fund cash. Watch. HAL will not test 52 week low.

If that weren’t enough, the average Texas family has been able to save more than $2,000 on average thanks to December’s historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Something to share: Big wins for Texans under President Trump"

Weatherfords bankruptcy is Haliburtons Gains. Less competition in the market now. SLB and HAL top tier and top 2. NO options for energy except drill and become independent from OPEC> USA is capable of 14 million barrels of oil a day and HAL will be drilling for it. Employees from Weatherford should come join HAL. Plenty of work and more than normal profits for HAL> GREAT BUY at this price. Citigroup knows it and upgraded to buy today.

Iran under threat by naval forces. Accidents could happen in narrow 21 mile wide strait of hormuz. Oil will skyrocket. Since 20% passes this area. And its getting tricky for negotiators to appease Israel not to pull USA into it. UAE is backing off their support of coalition. OIL is leverage and Iran will use it. And HAL will go much higher with oil stocks. Geo political trumps China trade noise. China still huge GDP of about 6 compared to USA at 3. China /india/ need more oil for all the middle class automobiles. Buy HAL> smart . Short HAL>dumb.

oil leading indicator for oil stock going up over 3% must worry shorts. not coincidental increase in price since oil intervention by saudis coming. Shorts are only issue holding stock down. Market not behaving normally when programmed selling covers short sales the price will go up 3 dollars. OIL TRADERS expect price jolt upward and its reflected in volatility. Hal and SLB are in over sold territory. Just add and hold and this stock will make you money long.
This is a super solid buy at this level... A blip on nice news will go to $25.00 per share quick....
Buy here and no peeky until Christmas.
This will be going above $25 or more !!!!

"NO DAVE, OBAMA IS RATED #12UNLESS IT IS YOUR KLAN DOING THE RANKING"
"From SLb Er report transcripts on briefing.com per etrade "".""From a macro perspective, we expect oil market sentiments to remain balanced. The oil demand forecast for 2019 has been reduced slightly on trade war fears and current global geopolitical tensions, but we do not anticipate a change in the structural demand outlook for the mid-term. On the supply side, we continue to see US shale oil as the only near- to medium-term source of global production growth, albeit at a slowing growth rate, as E&P operators continue to transition from an emphasis on growth to a focus on cash and returns, with consequent restraining effects on investment levels. "" Summary oil markets are steady.. Go HAL domestic shale production a big factor and Hal in USA more than SLB"
