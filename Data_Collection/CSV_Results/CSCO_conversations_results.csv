"CSCO really turned around after an early AM beating; I think more people read the CC and realized it was not bad at all - but rather good for a gigantic company. I've often compared Chuck Robbins with Satya Nadella. Has anyone forgotten how MSFT languished in the high 40's and low 50's for YEARS before Nadella? But he had SOFTWARE to work with, while Robbins has a much harder lift with HARDWARE. Software isn't nearly as costly to develop and you can sell it over and over and over for HUGE profits....Networks are expensive - very expensive - and carriers do NOT change their hardware more than absolutely necessary. So now CSCO is trying to implement changes using SAS, rather than selling new components containing new software. John Chambers had relatively little competition when he was CEO but now the list of Cisco's peers and rivals is long indeed. I know a lot of investors are frustrated with the stock - one even said that they haven't made acquisitions - seriously? I think Robbins is the right man for the job and I have faith that he will turn this company around one way or the other and get the stock price where it belongs. If you just look at the PE and compare it with some of the high fliers, the price should be three times what it is now, all things being equal. Just my two cents...the haters can hate if they want.....GLTA"

Many of the plants are in China, but by capacity, roughly a fifth of these new coal power stations are in other countries.Over all, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries, according to Urgewald’s tally, which uses data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker portal.

"California’s Climate ContradictionsCA’s green policies punish the poor and subsidize the rich. CA’s charted a course to decarbonize it’s economy….at the same time it has among the highest electricity prices in the U.S. CA requires renewables like wind and solar to be 60% of electricity by 2030 and also have backup power when it’s cloudy.The state sometimes has to pay Arizona to take its excess solar power to avoid overloading the grid on some days. Additionally, folks with solar panels get paid for surplus power they don’t use…sometimes at two to three times the rate of wholesale power.-------------------------------So if you can afford solar power for your home and you don’t use it the state will pay you….and send the cost to the people who can’t afford to have solar power…What can I say…it’s ‘liberal think’"
"Working in IT for 20 years. Cisco was an amazing company over the last 10 years that I have worked with their routers, call managers, contact center solutions, video conferencing ect. Now I am seeing Microsoft cloud service start taking over slowly most of my company's business with cisco. Teams I feel is going to be the silver bullet that takes out cisco video/voice solution. My firm is starting to move away and going for a full teams implementation which will makes the cisco ip phones and video codecs a thing of the past. COVID I feel ripped the band aid and my company has accelerated this process. I will probably be out of job once we migrate these services into the cloud in the next year or two. Pretty bummed out about it because I really like Cisco and always attended their Cisco live conference every year. I've spoken with many colleagues in the industry and Microsoft teams is def winning the war. I ended up purchasing Microsoft stock around low 200 range now. Cisco needs to innovate or do something different. Chuck doesn't seem to be the right one to lead this company at the moment. I really love working with cisco routers, switches, call managers etc. They have the tech interface done right, it's just that their leadership/vision is lacking. I am not here to bash on them at all. I truly love working on their systems and hope they can find their footing in this fast pace world.."

"The left also has a strange sense of ownership over the public offices it holds. Perhaps that is why when leftists launch a campaign to support the underprivileged, they make it look like they are paying for it out of their own pocket. But no, I have bad news for Gen Z: It’s actually yours.Thus, the chances of a government growing too large and becoming a burden on the nation are infinite. Sometimes a Reagan shows up, and the government flies lightly, but on other occasions an Obama emerges, and everything government is suddenly overweight, preventing the nation from taking flight and thus discouraging companies, frustrating workers and annulling the freedom of the individual in so many little things that a normal citizen does not even have time to count them."

"HR 1, the For the People Act. However, there’s one major difference this year—this misleadingly named bill is no longer dead on arrival in a Republican Senate or White House.Now that leftists hold the reins of power, Democrat leadership has doubled down on this anti-democratic bill, aiming to use its razor-thin majority in Congress to establish permanent and unopposed domination of our national elections.HR 1, a bill whose number indicates the highest level of priority for Democrats, does nothing to address the numerous crises we’re facing. It is silent on the ongoing pandemic, the millions of Americans still unemployed, our unstable and unsecured southern border, and the multitude of children suffering at home because they’re not in school.Instead, HR 1 is packed full of mandates to guarantee Democrats control future elections—all under the guise of “election reform.”"

"By the end of 2020, the Trump administration had ordered at least 800 million vaccine doses, according to the Government Accountability Office. As The Times noted, Kaiser Health News reported that this number of doses would be enough for 200 million Americans with authorized vaccines and more than enough to vaccinate 400 million people if all vaccines were fully tested and approved.As much as Biden might brag about his responsiveness to COVID-19, it was the Trump administration that laid the foundations for the work the current administration is attempting to do. The Biden administration has benefitted massively from Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which accelerated the typical vaccine development process by about five years."

"Demtirds lie.President Joe Biden claimed on the campaign trail that he would not raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000 annually, but his administration now admits that the number could actually be much lower with tax hikes on the horizon.A tax increase is coming for some individuals and for major corporations, just as was expected from Biden and Democrats. The federal government needs more funds to ramp up its planned spending, which includes another round of massive legislation. This opens up a big opportunity for the GOP, but we’ll get to that later.Bloomberg reported this week: “Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won’t rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it’s been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will have to be paid for, and pointed to higher rates — key advisers are now making preparations for a package of measures that could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners.”"

Nothing against CSCO, good company, strong balance sheet, but the stock is getting up there on a 3 year chart."

All the oil companies have to do is but a certain family member on their board and it's 'OFF TO THE RACES'....the left stream non-news media won't say a word....but as soon as the left figures out how to provide NYC with the 11 billion watts of electricity they need EACH DAY with wind/solar then the oil companies will be in trouble...until then...OH HAPPY DAYS.....OH HAPPY DAYS...."

"Two-thirds of entry-level tech jobs go to compliant foreign guest-workers, not to the young American professionals who may create a new wave of establishment-shaking companies, according to a report from Bloomberg.In 2018, “the U.S. had between 96,000 and 143,000 openings in IT occupations that typically went to candidates with a bachelor’s degree or higher in computer science or engineering,” said the March 10 report, headlined “STEM Graduates Deserve a Better Path to Good Jobs.”But the government each year provides “Occupational Practical Training” (OPT) work permits to hundreds of thousands of foreigners who have paid tuition to American universities.

"With millions of Texans still without power or running water amid a devastating winter storm, The View’s panel initially took aim at complete failure exhibited by the state’s Republican officials, who have ludicrously attempted to blame Texas’ power outages on the Green New Deal.“The truth is that a privatized, deregulated energy system is at fault, and they knew they had problems to fix, and they’ve known this since 2011, but they didn’t do it,” host Whoopi Goldberg noted.McCain, the show’s resident conservative host, immediately decried the entire situation as “awful,” insisting that there’s a “lot of heads to roll and a lot of people to blame” over the debilitating loss of power and utilities during the storm.From there, McCain focused her attention on Cruz—who has criticized other politicians in the past for traveling in the wake of local or regional crises.“What’s not helping right now is the fact that senator Ted Cruz is seen on a flight with his family to Cancun right now,” she declared. “I was looking at Twitter in the commercial break. He’s apparently on a flight back home to Texas right at this very moment.”“I’m sure there’s going to be a lot of media waiting, asking questions, but to, like, literally flee your home state while people are freezing to death, to go to Cancun is a very Marie Antoinette,” McCain added. “One of the worst optics I could come up with in an era where there’s been a lot of bad political optics.”"
"The move has raised two concerns. Unlike those arriving at airports from abroad, illegal immigrants do not arrive with a negative COVID test and CBP does not test unless symptoms are obvious. So even though officials know nothing about the migrants' travel or medical history, they're being dropped off at the nearest bus station and could be spreading the virus."

"Hey SNOWROOMS... what you'll have to do with old solar panels (he, he, he)Close to 100% of the materials in a solar panel are recyclable or reusable, but the panels often contain heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, selenium, and silver. The presence of those metals may cause discarded panels to exhibit the hazardous waste characteristic of toxicity, and thus be classified as hazardous waste under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and California’s more stringent Hazardous Waste Control Law. This classification makes it expensive and burdensome to store, handle and transport end-of-life panels for recycling or disposal under current regulations.Starting on January 1, 2021, decommissioned solar panels will be regulated like other universal wastes in California, which include batteries, electronic devices, mercury-containing equipment, lamps, cathode ray tubes, and aerosol cans. The new rule will make it less expensive and burdensome to collect, process and recycle them.-------------------------------------------------------------------read on.....The pro-solar website EnergySage writes: There are some chemicals used in the manufacturing process to prepare silicon and make the wafers for monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels. One of the most toxic chemicals created as a byproduct of this process is silicon tetrachloride. This chemical, if not handled and disposed of properly, can lead to burns on your skin, harmful air pollutants that increase lung disease, and if exposed to water can release hydrochloric acid, which is a corrosive substance bad for human and environmental health.------------------------------------------enjoy.....you SnowRooms are walking into a nightmare.....you just don't know it..."

"You don't own CSCO stock to get a share price triple. You own it because its a strong biz with solid earnings, a good dividend and very little downside risk. A week ago, it was $46 stock. Tomorrow, it'll be a $46-$48 stock. When enterprise spending returns, CSCO shares will likely go into the 50's, 60's and probably 70s. Which is a good deal of upside. But for the moment, its a company with a teens P/E, very good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. The upside is a lot bigger than the downside. Its a very favorable risk/reward. If you've held for the last 5 years, you doubled your money. If you hold for anther 5 years, you'll likely double it again. Low-risk for a double-digit annual return might not be super exciting, but its a good return."

As a former chief election officer, and now an Attorney General, I know this would be a disaster for election integrity and confidence in the processes that have been developed over time to instill confidence in the idea of ‘one person, one vote.’”"
