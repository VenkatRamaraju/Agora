"David Cameron believed Barack Obama, a man with whom he appeared to share a warm and respectful relationship that even verged on a so-called bromance, was one of the “most narcissistic, self-absorbed people” he ever met, according to the ex-Prime Minister’s former strategy chief.Steve Hilton, who was one of the former Premier’s closest advisers until they parted ways over his support for Brexit and tougher immigration laws, said the former president “thought he was smarter than everyone”.Discussing the fall out triggered by the publication of Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, which claims many of Donald Trump’s top aides believe he is mentally unfit to be President, Mr Hilton claimed Mr Trump was being attacked for his assault upon national and international elites.“My old boss, former British prime minister David Cameron, thought Obama was one of the most narcissistic, self-absorbed people he’d ever dealt with,” Mr Hilton said.“Obama never listened to anyone, always thought he was smarter than every expert in the room, and treated every meeting as an opportunity to lecture everyone else. This led to real-world disasters, like Syria and the rise of Isis.”He said for the world’s elites, such problems were not an issue as they existed within their own bubble.“For them, it’s all about style and tone, not substance and results. Donald Trump offends the elites aesthetically, like a piece of art that’s not to their taste,” he said.“They can afford to do that because they live in a world of booming neighbourhoods, delightful hipster eateries and everyone they know employed in the virtual world of the knowledge economy. They don’t see what’s going on in the actual economy.”"

He fast tracked deportations. And yes, he housed unaccompanied children in tent cities.For much of the country — and President Donald Trump — the prevailing belief is that Obama was the president who went easier on immigrants.Neither Obama nor Democrats created Trump's zero-tolerance policy, which calls for every illegal border crosser to be prosecuted and leads to their children being detained in separate facilities before being shipped to a shelter and eventually a sponsor family."

"California’s Climate ContradictionsCA’s green policies punish the poor and subsidize the rich. CA’s charted a course to decarbonize it’s economy….at the same time it has among the highest electricity prices in the U.S. CA requires renewables like wind and solar to be 60% of electricity by 2030 and also have backup power when it’s cloudy.The state sometimes has to pay Arizona to take its excess solar power to avoid overloading the grid on some days. Additionally, folks with solar panels get paid for surplus power they don’t use…sometimes at two to three times the rate of wholesale power.-------------------------------So if you can afford solar power for your home and you don’t use it the state will pay you….and send the cost to the people who can’t afford to have solar power…What can I say…it’s ‘liberal think’"

"Demtirds lie.President Joe Biden claimed on the campaign trail that he would not raise taxes on individuals making less than $400,000 annually, but his administration now admits that the number could actually be much lower with tax hikes on the horizon.A tax increase is coming for some individuals and for major corporations, just as was expected from Biden and Democrats. The federal government needs more funds to ramp up its planned spending, which includes another round of massive legislation. This opens up a big opportunity for the GOP, but we’ll get to that later.Bloomberg reported this week: “Unlike the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus act, the next initiative, which is expected to be even bigger, won’t rely just on government debt as a funding source. While it’s been increasingly clear that tax hikes will be a component — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said at least part of the next bill will have to be paid for, and pointed to higher rates — key advisers are now making preparations for a package of measures that could include an increase in both the corporate tax rate and the individual rate for high earners.”"

We have enormous, enormous costs, much of it incurred because the president was in denial early on, delayed a reaction to it, caused deaths. And so, now, we want to say, okay, that was then. Alright, let’s start now and do things in a positive way. Nobody’s putting anything on the table saying, unless we have this, we’re not doing that.

"I like this CSCO board because one can discuss the company, or venture into politics. The venturing into politics part is always subject to censorship by VERIZON (Exactly like China, believe it or not). Anyway, here goes. Our man in charge and his party came to power with no plan of their own. Their ONLY idea was to literally do everything opposite of the previous guy.

"Hey SnowRooms…you can forget about the $15 min wage…Watched an interesting program about the ‘new democrats’ coming in from down South, the wealthy liberal elites in the US, and the cyots at the border. 1st the cyots are making a fortune each day from the ‘new democrats’. The new democrats that can’t pay will have a wrist monitor placed on them and they will have to send money back home to the cyots. The amount that they must pay the cyots requires the new democrats to work multiple low paying jobs. The employers love this since they know that they will get a good worker who has no skills and will do what they are told.Since the liberal, wealthy power elites own the politicians they don’t have to worry about the min wage….so they make a fortune for themselves and the stockholders…(I like that).So SnowRooms….if you were worth $15 an hour you would be making it.

"What real conservatives are sayingDislike of him should be tempered by this consideration: He is an almost inexpressibly sad specimen. It must be misery to awaken to another day of being Donald Trump. He seems to have as many friends as his pluperfect self-centeredness allows, and as he has earned in an entirely transactional life. His historical ignorance deprives him of the satisfaction of working in a house where much magnificent history has been made. His childlike ignorance — preserved by a lifetime of single-minded self-promotion — concerning governance and economics guarantees that whenever he must interact with experienced and accomplished people, he is as bewildered as a kindergartener at a seminar on string theory.Which is why this fountain of self-refuting boasts (“I have a very good brain”) lies so much. He does so less to deceive anyone than to reassure himself. And as balm for his base, which remains oblivious to his likely contempt for them as sheep who can be effortlessly gulled by preposterous fictions. The tungsten strength of his supporters’ loyalty is as impressive as his indifference to expanding their numbers."

"The real political hacks are Dems who suddenly care about cybersecurity Sore loser Democrats continue to push the idea that Russia helped President-elect Donald Trump win the election. These alt-left liberals desperately keep playing up a narrative that Russian hacks helped Trump with his electoral victory over Hillary Clinton, despite conflicting views on the issue of intelligence from the CIA and the FBI. The left wing is running wild with reports saying the CIA, without any concrete or new evidence, somehow knows that Russian hackers influenced the election in favor of Trump. That's their conspiracy. Democrats and the abusively biased alt-left mainstream media are pushing the CIA's assessment as an undeniable fact, but of course, it is not. Yet, instead of accepting the facts and telling the American people the truth, the left, led by President Obama, continue to repeat falsehoods. Why? To delegitimize President-elect Donald Trump.President Obama has done a major flip-flop on the potential of the election in America being rigged or interfered with.

Obama was a passive do nothing President, Trump is an active ""clean up the mess"" President. His populist agenda will be proven to be the correct tactics in these difficult times."

Cisco another buy rating from Goldman Sachs $48 PT
"CSCO really turned around after an early AM beating; I think more people read the CC and realized it was not bad at all - but rather good for a gigantic company. I've often compared Chuck Robbins with Satya Nadella. Has anyone forgotten how MSFT languished in the high 40's and low 50's for YEARS before Nadella? But he had SOFTWARE to work with, while Robbins has a much harder lift with HARDWARE. Software isn't nearly as costly to develop and you can sell it over and over and over for HUGE profits....Networks are expensive - very expensive - and carriers do NOT change their hardware more than absolutely necessary. So now CSCO is trying to implement changes using SAS, rather than selling new components containing new software. John Chambers had relatively little competition when he was CEO but now the list of Cisco's peers and rivals is long indeed. I know a lot of investors are frustrated with the stock - one even said that they haven't made acquisitions - seriously? I think Robbins is the right man for the job and I have faith that he will turn this company around one way or the other and get the stock price where it belongs. If you just look at the PE and compare it with some of the high fliers, the price should be three times what it is now, all things being equal. Just my two cents...the haters can hate if they want.....GLTA"

His 'ask' was roundly criticized and, we would bet, part of the reason Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected the idea of state bailouts in a recent radio interview.""--------------------------------------------------------------------- As Barack Obama's pastor, Jeremiah Wright, once said....""The chickens have come home to roost""...and you SnowRooms will be paying for itDon't forget NY Gov Cuomo's $500 Billion request....ENJOY!!!"

"In May, Trump walked out of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Tehran, which curbed Iranian nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. The US is now piling on sanctions and telling the world to stop buying Iranian oil. Sooner or later it is possible, likely even, that the Iranian government will stop abiding by the agreement and start stepping up its uranium enrichment and other activities. That is likely to raise tensions in the Gulf dramatically and make other regional players rethink whether to acquire nuclear weapons themselves.Taking all these developments into consideration, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has decided to set its “doomsday clock” to two minutes to midnight, the closest to catastrophe it has been since 1953."

The survey was conducted from April 17 to April 30, almost entirely following the public release of the Mueller report on April 18. “The latest rating extends the upper limits of President Donald Trump’s narrow approval rating range by one percentage point, from his previous range of 35% to 45%,” Gallup notes. ----------------------------------------------and this is with the non-stop lying from the left stream non-news media....Bernie or Biden don't have a prayer...."

"The left also has a strange sense of ownership over the public offices it holds. Perhaps that is why when leftists launch a campaign to support the underprivileged, they make it look like they are paying for it out of their own pocket. But no, I have bad news for Gen Z: It’s actually yours.Thus, the chances of a government growing too large and becoming a burden on the nation are infinite. Sometimes a Reagan shows up, and the government flies lightly, but on other occasions an Obama emerges, and everything government is suddenly overweight, preventing the nation from taking flight and thus discouraging companies, frustrating workers and annulling the freedom of the individual in so many little things that a normal citizen does not even have time to count them."

"Karin Housley, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate, has officially requested an investigation into the allegations of domestic abuse against Rep. Keith Ellison.Ellison, a Democrat running for attorney general in Minnesota, has been accused by his former girlfriend of physical and emotional abuse throughout the time they dated. Karen Monahan alleged Ellison once dragged her off a bed while shouting profanities and sent multiple abusive text messages.Ellison has vehemently denied the accusations and asked the House Ethics Committee to launch a probe into the allegations. Minnesota’s Democratic Party has also commissioned an investigation.But Housley, the GOP nominee who is facing incumbent Sen. Tina Smith in November, has called for an “immediate investigation” by the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General.“Recent calls for a congressional ethics investigation, made by Keith Ellison and echoed by my opponent, amount to nothing more than political cover; Ellison will have left Congress by the time an investigation could be completed,” Housley said in a statement. “These are serious, recent and substantiated allegations that deserve immediate attention and raise significant doubts about Keith Ellison’s fitness to serve as Minnesota’s chief legal officer.”"

"HR 1, the For the People Act. However, there’s one major difference this year—this misleadingly named bill is no longer dead on arrival in a Republican Senate or White House.Now that leftists hold the reins of power, Democrat leadership has doubled down on this anti-democratic bill, aiming to use its razor-thin majority in Congress to establish permanent and unopposed domination of our national elections.HR 1, a bill whose number indicates the highest level of priority for Democrats, does nothing to address the numerous crises we’re facing. It is silent on the ongoing pandemic, the millions of Americans still unemployed, our unstable and unsecured southern border, and the multitude of children suffering at home because they’re not in school.Instead, HR 1 is packed full of mandates to guarantee Democrats control future elections—all under the guise of “election reform.”"

Now we know why nancy pants caved!Senator Lindsey Graham has created a new reality for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Graham has written a powerful resolution which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined in co-sponsoring. Together they have attracted 50 co-sponsors – which means with Vice President Pence supporting them they would win a vote to dismiss any phony impeachment from the House that failed to meet a key standard of fairness.The resolution: “calls on the House of Representatives, prior to proceeding any further with its impeachment investigation into President Trump, to vote to initiate a formal impeachment inquiry; calls on the House of Representatives to provide President Trump, like every other American, with due process, to include the ability to confront his accusers, call witnesses on his behalf, and have a basic understanding of the accusations against him that would form any basis for impeachment; and calls on the House of Representatives to provide members of the minority with the ability to participate fully in all proceedings and have equal authority to issue subpoenas and other compulsory process.”Faced with this new reality, Speaker Pelosi suddenly ended months of avoiding a vote on the impeachment process and announced today that the House would vote this week."

As a former chief election officer, and now an Attorney General, I know this would be a disaster for election integrity and confidence in the processes that have been developed over time to instill confidence in the idea of ‘one person, one vote.’”"

He pleaded not guilty today and is scheduled to return for a preliminary hearing setting on October 28 in Department 50 of the Foltz Criminal Justice Center.The case was filed for warrant on July 31.Deputy District Attorney Marian Thompson of the Public Integrity Division is prosecuting the case.Between October 2012 and November 2014, Abutin is accused of voting in three elections, claiming to be his 67-year-old mother who passed away in July 2006, while also casting votes for himself.The charges were announced, coincidentally, in the midst of the Democratic National Convention, as Democrats accused President Donald Trump of exaggerating the potential for voter fraud in his push against automatic vote-by-mail."

"Poll: 44% Approve of Democrats’ $1.9 Trillion Coronavirus Relief MeasureLess than a majority of Americans approve of the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure, an internal survey from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) showed.The survey, taken February 24-28, 2021, among 1,000 voters across 85 battleground congressional districts, found 44 percent expressing support for the left’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief measure, which Democrats in both chambers have approved.“House Democrats’ corrupt, $1.9 trillion ‘COVID-relief’ [coronavirus] package that provides a bailout to mismanaged state governments is not popular,” the NRCC said in the memo. “Just 44% of voters, including just 38% of Independents, agree with Pelosi’s Blue State bailout.”The low approval of the measure, which Republican lawmakers note is filled with pork and Democrat pet projects, coincides with other aspects of the survey, showing Pelosi extremely unfavorable across the board — a fact that could prove to be difficult for Democrats, who seek to maintain their slim House majority in 2022.---------------------------------------------------I think it's great....the wife thinks it's great....the undocumented democrats think it's great....why I bet the SnowRooms even think it's great....right SnowRooms"

The Market Is Yawning at the End of the Government Shutdown Because It Never Cared in the First Place
"This is a reminder that the virus can trigger a series of events that can ultimately take a person’s life. In fact, with Covid-19 leading to all sorts of problems in the body, the probability is high (say over 90%) that something else will then be recorded as a cause of death in addition to Covid-19. It would actually be unusual to simply put Covid-19 as a cause of death without specifying what led to the patient’s demise.Thus, the 6% did not mean that “only 6%” of the 161,392 deaths (as of August 26) recorded by the CDC were actually from Covid-19 as Mel Q suggested. No, Covid-19 has killed far more people than that, over 183,000 in the U.S. according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center as of August 30."

The criminal investigation is underway and at least one top Obama-era official has admitted that the conspiracy goes all the way to the top. Former President Barack Obama very well may be implicated in these proceedings before it is all said and done.Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper admitted on CNN that Obama called for the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) that was arranged by former FBI agent Peter Strzok in Jan. 2017 shortly before President Trump took office. This is what kicked off the entire farce that has been a stain on US democracy and political discourse for nearly three years now.Obummer will look good in Stripes.

Keith Ellison, D-Minn., of domestic abuse released on Wednesday what appeared to be a medical document from 2017 detailing the abuse allegedly caused by the congressman.Karen Monahan, an ex-girlfriend of Ellison, published the document on social media just days after saying the Democratic Party “smeared” her and threatened to isolate her over her allegations against the deputy of the Democratic National Committee (DNC).A doctor wrote in the medical document that Monahan “states that she was in a very stressful environment for years, emotional and physical abuse by a partner with whom she is now separated."

"No surge in investment, in fact it went down.""I call it the tax deform bill. It was just a free handout to rich people who pay a lot of money to lobbies,"" Yusko, the founder and CEO of Morgan Creek Capital, told CNN Business.Instead of using its tax savings to speed up the economy, Corporate America is just ""buying back stock to stimulate their stock price,"" Yusko said from the sidelines of the Cayman Alternative Investment Summit.Yusko noted that prior to 1982, share buybacks were outlawed by the SEC. ""I think they should still be deemed insider trading and illegal,"" he said.Share buybacks are a common practice where companies repurchase their own shares as a way to return excess capital. Buybacks boost demand for shares and artificially inflate per-share earnings.US companies announced a record-shattering $1 trillion worth of share buybacks in 2018, the first full year since the tax law took effect, according to TrimTabs Investment Research."

John Richardson, on Tuesday by reversing his February decision to retire the 21-year-old nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman.Trump’s decision will cost the Navy more than $20 billion over the next two decades, much of which the service had planned to spend on new unmanned vessels and other advanced technologies."

The infamous Capitol riot is still under investigation.

But evidence has not yet suggested — as the media once insisted — that Sicknick was assaulted and murdered by a rioter.

"HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT CROWDSTRIKE?IT'S THE REASON WHY THE DEMOCRATS ARE RUSHING TO IMPEACH TRUMP: Why are the Democrats rushing so fast to try and impeach President Trump? Because of a single word in the Ukraine transcripts – CrowdStrike. Who are they? CrowdStrike is a private sector security company in Silicon Valley, and they were hired by the Crooked Hillary team to keep her email server out of the hands of the FBI. James Comey saw that that mission was successfully completed. Why does President Trump mention CrowdStrike in the transcripts? Because CrowdStrike is the one, single thread that ties together Joe Biden getting slush-fund money for his son Hunter, the Russian Collusion hoax, the Mueller Report, and collusion of the Obama administration with the Russians in 2016. Yep, CrowdStrike.Yes, the Democrats know that they cannot actually impeach President Trump, just like they knew that there was no Russian Collusion. But they kept that scam going for two and a half long years anyway to tie Trump up, and in that respect, the Democrats were successful. But they did not anticipate CrowdStrike popping up in the transcripts, and now they are in an absolute panic to muzzle Trump. But the proverbial cat, as they say, is now out of the bag and peeing all over the carpet at the DNC. And the Democrats are terrified. Written by Michael Kintner."

An estimated 530,000 families turn to bankruptcy each year because of medical issues and bills, the research found."

"last quarter, CSCO was about 48 when they announced earnings and it dropped to around 46. Oh the humanity. This time is was 52 and it'll probably drop to 50. And in a few months, it'll probably be 55. They always guide conservatively. But at a PE of 15, a very healthy balance sheet, good cash position and a 3% dividend, you don't buy CSCO to get rich fast. Lower risk and lower reward. You buy it so you get 5-10% annual return and don't risk up losing 50% of your money. A year ago, it was 45, it'll be 50-ish tomorrow. 10% share price gain, 3% dividend for 13% return. 5 years ago, it was a bit under $30/share. Its up 70% and add in the dividend, you got nearly a double. Or 13% annual return. I can live with that. Not every stock has to be a roller coaster ride."

"How the wealthy manipulate the environmentalist….or…Crude Producers Resort to trains….(from the WSJ)The use of trains to carry crude is surging as drillers in North America produce more oil than area pipelines can accommodate. An average of 718,000 barrels of crude a day traversed America’s railway as of October.Much of the oil train growth is due to record shipments from Canada, where pipeline expansion projects, including Keystone XL and Trans Mountain, have stalled amid environmentalist opposition.The cost by rail in about $20 per barrel vs. $12.50 by pipeline (60% increase in cost). The article goes on to say that shipment by rail is more expensive, slower and more dangerous.Now if I were a billionaire (like say Warren Buffett) who was the head of a multi-national corporation (like say Berkshire Hathaway) that has a railroad company in its corporation (Burlington Northern Santa Fe) I would do the following to make sure I could make A LOT of money from my railroad company…I would make a large donation to an environmental group who would slow down (or stop) development of any pipeline that would affect my railroad investment…. Just saying…P.S…..Burlington North makes a yearly PROFIT of $2 Billion just by having the oil run on its railroad system…."

"By the end of 2020, the Trump administration had ordered at least 800 million vaccine doses, according to the Government Accountability Office. As The Times noted, Kaiser Health News reported that this number of doses would be enough for 200 million Americans with authorized vaccines and more than enough to vaccinate 400 million people if all vaccines were fully tested and approved.As much as Biden might brag about his responsiveness to COVID-19, it was the Trump administration that laid the foundations for the work the current administration is attempting to do. The Biden administration has benefitted massively from Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, which accelerated the typical vaccine development process by about five years."
"Retail chains and restaurants have abandoned an “unsustainable” New York City over the past few months due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report by The New York Times -- but officials say thet will not know the full extent of losses until the fall.New York Gov.

Cuomo’s policy, in combination with a statewide lockdown, managed to flatten the curve when New York City was the national hot spot of the virus in the United States."

Many of the plants are in China, but by capacity, roughly a fifth of these new coal power stations are in other countries.Over all, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries, according to Urgewald’s tally, which uses data from the Global Coal Plant Tracker portal. The new plants would expand the world’s coal-fired power capacity by 43 percent.----------------------------------You can find this article in the NYT...and you SnowRooms will be paying for the new ""Green Plan""....Trillions$$$"

"Working in IT for 20 years. Cisco was an amazing company over the last 10 years that I have worked with their routers, call managers, contact center solutions, video conferencing ect. Now I am seeing Microsoft cloud service start taking over slowly most of my company's business with cisco. Teams I feel is going to be the silver bullet that takes out cisco video/voice solution. My firm is starting to move away and going for a full teams implementation which will makes the cisco ip phones and video codecs a thing of the past. COVID I feel ripped the band aid and my company has accelerated this process. I will probably be out of job once we migrate these services into the cloud in the next year or two. Pretty bummed out about it because I really like Cisco and always attended their Cisco live conference every year. I've spoken with many colleagues in the industry and Microsoft teams is def winning the war. I ended up purchasing Microsoft stock around low 200 range now. Cisco needs to innovate or do something different. Chuck doesn't seem to be the right one to lead this company at the moment. I really love working with cisco routers, switches, call managers etc. They have the tech interface done right, it's just that their leadership/vision is lacking. I am not here to bash on them at all. I truly love working on their systems and hope they can find their footing in this fast pace world.."

"With millions of Texans still without power or running water amid a devastating winter storm, The View’s panel initially took aim at complete failure exhibited by the state’s Republican officials, who have ludicrously attempted to blame Texas’ power outages on the Green New Deal.“The truth is that a privatized, deregulated energy system is at fault, and they knew they had problems to fix, and they’ve known this since 2011, but they didn’t do it,” host Whoopi Goldberg noted.McCain, the show’s resident conservative host, immediately decried the entire situation as “awful,” insisting that there’s a “lot of heads to roll and a lot of people to blame” over the debilitating loss of power and utilities during the storm.From there, McCain focused her attention on Cruz—who has criticized other politicians in the past for traveling in the wake of local or regional crises.“What’s not helping right now is the fact that senator Ted Cruz is seen on a flight with his family to Cancun right now,” she declared. “I was looking at Twitter in the commercial break. He’s apparently on a flight back home to Texas right at this very moment.”“I’m sure there’s going to be a lot of media waiting, asking questions, but to, like, literally flee your home state while people are freezing to death, to go to Cancun is a very Marie Antoinette,” McCain added. “One of the worst optics I could come up with in an era where there’s been a lot of bad political optics.”"
"The move has raised two concerns. Unlike those arriving at airports from abroad, illegal immigrants do not arrive with a negative COVID test and CBP does not test unless symptoms are obvious. So even though officials know nothing about the migrants' travel or medical history, they're being dropped off at the nearest bus station and could be spreading the virus."

"Hey SNOWROOMS... what you'll have to do with old solar panels (he, he, he)Close to 100% of the materials in a solar panel are recyclable or reusable, but the panels often contain heavy metals such as cadmium, copper, lead, selenium, and silver. The presence of those metals may cause discarded panels to exhibit the hazardous waste characteristic of toxicity, and thus be classified as hazardous waste under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and California’s more stringent Hazardous Waste Control Law. This classification makes it expensive and burdensome to store, handle and transport end-of-life panels for recycling or disposal under current regulations.Starting on January 1, 2021, decommissioned solar panels will be regulated like other universal wastes in California, which include batteries, electronic devices, mercury-containing equipment, lamps, cathode ray tubes, and aerosol cans. The new rule will make it less expensive and burdensome to collect, process and recycle them.-------------------------------------------------------------------read on.....The pro-solar website EnergySage writes: There are some chemicals used in the manufacturing process to prepare silicon and make the wafers for monocrystalline and polycrystalline panels. One of the most toxic chemicals created as a byproduct of this process is silicon tetrachloride. This chemical, if not handled and disposed of properly, can lead to burns on your skin, harmful air pollutants that increase lung disease, and if exposed to water can release hydrochloric acid, which is a corrosive substance bad for human and environmental health.------------------------------------------enjoy.....you SnowRooms are walking into a nightmare.....you just don't know it..."

"You don't own CSCO stock to get a share price triple. You own it because its a strong biz with solid earnings, a good dividend and very little downside risk. A week ago, it was $46 stock. Tomorrow, it'll be a $46-$48 stock. When enterprise spending returns, CSCO shares will likely go into the 50's, 60's and probably 70s. Which is a good deal of upside. But for the moment, its a company with a teens P/E, very good cash flow and a strong balance sheet. The upside is a lot bigger than the downside. Its a very favorable risk/reward. If you've held for the last 5 years, you doubled your money. If you hold for anther 5 years, you'll likely double it again. Low-risk for a double-digit annual return might not be super exciting, but its a good return."
"I, at this point, cannot stop laughing."

""" the claim that wind and solar power caused the collapse of the Texas power grid, and that radical environmentalists are somehow responsible for the fact that millions of people are freezing in the dark, even though conservative Republicans have run the state for a generation.This isn’t normal political malfeasance. It’s the energy-policy equivalent of claiming that the Jan. 6 insurrection was a false-flag Antifa operation — raw denial of reality, not just to escape accountability, but to demonize one’s opponents. And it’s another indicator of the moral and intellectual collapse of American conservatism."" Krugman"
