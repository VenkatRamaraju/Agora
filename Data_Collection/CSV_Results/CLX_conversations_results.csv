Recent headlines and conversations for CLX
$200 for next week
"There's more than one way to ""clean up"" with Clorox!"
Up 1.5% then down .. must be the bottom and time to get in
this is a damn nightmare.
"Nothing less sexy than this stock, but it's not going down in the middle of a pandemic. Simple and safe place to park some cash while the rest of the market implodes."
should have bought on the dip...
Bought at $178...want to average down on next pullback - can’t wait 
Time to split the stock.
want to jump in...I think it's kinda at the peak?
Thumbs up if you are a long term holder! I am 37 and I will be holding for 20 years. A great American company!
In the red now after 52 week high...Hopefully this gets back up and close at 230.
"Ouch, getting killed last several days!!"
cant even sell after hours as this is getting its balls busted AH
Why are all these FNG people selling !!!
Baby Made Me Rich
Announcing price increases on the most expensive products in their sectors. That won’t grow market share
What is happening? CLX is down 9.1% !
Easy 5% in the next couple months. Big demand for workplaces/hotels/casinos ect during the reopening. Don't see it going away any time soon.
Buyback will certainly help out. Stock was low.
why down ?
Just some #$%$ h&& trying to get it down.It will not stay here for sure
"Interesting that ""stay at home"" stocks are still selling off while ""germs still out there"" stocks are clawing their way back."
"Worst short seller stocks.. short sellers will learn their lesson tomorrow and days ahead... Just check all the short squeeze stocks, GME, AMC, etc.... Everything is shooting up double/triple digits... Hope this follows suit...."
Charts say 175.00
"Market manipulation at its finest. Every consumer goods company is up, CLX was up...now a huge drop. LMAO you cant make this up."
Positive chart action for CLX today. Double Top Breakout. CLX can make a run to $133. Would love to see that.
"Ex div date on Monday. Any short that doesnt cover by 4PM pays the dividend on May 1st.Btw if you look for jobs in google, most of them are for amazon, ups and things like sitters, or even pet sitters. Guess who's hiring? Yep, clorox"
Clorox had a great year and brightness future coming
Ex dividend date April 21st. Expect a nice little short squeeze before then
"In the same vain that this went down yesterday, it can surge with a short squeeze. Spread word to BUY CLX. Let's get this moving back up."
"ZAKS is pumping, Banks are downgrading. Who to trust?"
What difference does any of this make???? Uncle Joe and the socialist's will drive this market to collapse shortly...
"To all those complaining like Mark, pull up the five year chart. You bought a stock that was run up a year ago over coronavirus opportunity. You’re late to the party so don’t complain about the lack of hors d'oeuvres."
Maybe it will drop but not back to where it was. Nice earnings and a nice position to have... steady eddy
SHORTS - you are going to get hurt bad. Watch this spike soon
Clorox is up 4.95% to 217.50
Clorox will be over $250 in a month
right around here is a good place to accumulate. may come down a few more cents but will ride the elevator up a good $8-$10 shortly.
"I have been trading since late 90s and never seen a stock with such strange price movements, like there is no logic to it...wonder if it is the big boys moving their money in and out constantly. In any case, this is a stock to hold."
CLX is a solid company. It has been hurt like all CPG companies due to margin contraction. Higher input costs and rising logistics costs. CLX should rebound over the next few quarters.
Kumar saying 100 which would put it at a 10 year low. cmon it's already approaching a one year low
What time does CLX report tomorrow? GL to all
"This trades crazy !! UP , Down. they can't decide which way it will go !! I'll just stick to XLP it's less volatile !!"
easy come easy go
It's a beat:22% sales increase$2.41 diluted EPS (28% increase versus year-ago quarter)
I am not understanding this #$%$ price action....
this is always down
"Let’s pretend that a vaccine is discovered in December (very hopeful situation). They will still need to test it on average women, then women who got pregnant before and also after they got the vaccine, then they have to run studies on the newborn baby and then again at the babies 1 year birthday to see if there was any negative reactions. Then after that, it is necessary to vaccine the baby itself and then require another report after 1 year.... all the meanwhile a good portion of the population will refuse to trust a vaccine until all those tests are complete. The point here is that society awaits those results, regardless of success or not, everyone will be using #Clorox products."
A very interesting decontamination play: $TOMZ
How the prices makes a difference in quality products !
"So the knuckle-draggers have finally figured out somethings up, and they're looking for the product, and we got the stock. Anyone else enjoying the ride today?"
I just keep buying
Wells Fargo Downgrades Clorox to Underweight.
The reason clx fell today was due to the conservative guidance.
Is this a triple bottom formuły in The 1yr?
CLX is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
Analysts will downgrade as stock over priced 175.00
It’s dropping like a stone ... damn
New all time high today! Will it hold until the end of the day? I don't care! Happy happy!
$300 this summer?
"Companies like TLRY, APHA, BNGO, SENS, etc.[Without any revenue whatsoever] are zooming in this market at the expense of these good ones. Those company will not be able to justify the evaluation even after 100 years....Really funny, ridiculous and senseless market."
"Don't listen to any of the #$%$ analysts or negative posts here.... This is easily a 200+ stock, if not more....The demand for sanitizing and cleaning supplies is here to stay for a pretty long time. This should be around 195 within a week or two."
"Would advise to sell your position if you bought in today. This thing can get ugly really quick, especially after this low volume fake bull pump."
"Welcome to oversold clorox. Now that others left, this is when I come in. Expected eps of 1.74 lol yeah right, watch it reach +3.0. Covid will be with us for years. Just the airlines will use clorox massively forever. Anything public, throw the clorox. Caterpillar has decreasing revenue, decreasing earnings, decreasing profit margin and increasing debt and their pe ratio shoots up to +33 but clorox is at 20? Lol easy buy."
"What if (and I don't know) there were a huge number of 200 call options set to expire at the end of Friday? The ""big money"" writers of those calls want them to expire worthless, so ""big money"" drives the price of CLX down to make sure those calls expire worthless and the premium is kept. I don't know anything particular about today, but once I realized that much of a huge, widely traded stock's price action is about forcing outcomes for the option buyers, I realized that ""fundamental"" stuff only goes so far, and that I don't need to panic if things go against my intuition on a given day. The dividend increase is Great news, 2.2% yield based on current price puts a floor under this stock like nothing else!"
CLX squeeeeze underway still 10 million CLX shares are short
Wallstreet at its best...
"watch Hikaru, he is short"
CVS looks like similar trade low peg ratio (growth potential) heavy institutional ownership 3% dividend with zero looks like attractive defensive play
Thank you CLX for the 10% dividend increase!
"The pattern since the pandemic started is that whenever some ""good"" news is released with respect to the cornonavirus, there is a minor sell-off in CLX. Last night it was the idea of reopening combined with some good news about the Gilead drug which I still can't pronounce or spell. But, I'd think ""reopening"" would actually INCREASE the demand for Clorox disinfectants. Businesses have to disinfect too going forward. Also, how many know that Clorox owns Brita, the water pitcher/filter company? I've turned to Brita to ease up on my use of bottled water."
"This morning (12/17) Cramer said that CLX might ""be the safest stock in the entire market to own""......and it then proceeded to go straight down. The Cramer curse. Too funny."
new ATH while everybody is buying gold and bonds.... that pretty much sums up the current status of clx
This stock deserves to stay under 200.
Get out now before the bell! Clorox will no longer be in demand once vaccine comes out. Market will discount stock down to $125. Sell
Reddit Investors please......Please push it back above 200
This shows you how rigged the market really is...
Today it will tank
Good news for CLX coming https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lysol-sales-surging-071831273.html
Trump said inhale bleach ... Vaccine just around the corner... LoL
LET US COVER LET US COVER SLOW DOWN
lost all its gains since Tuesday 
"My buying has started. 100 shares at a time. For every $5 drop. Hold it for dividends. Trade it for profits. Steady, Lowkey Moneymaker. Check the decent weekly options premiums."
There's going to be a prolonged demand for Clorox products surely and bigly. $220 to $240 over time ? - Pete
"As stated yesterday when stock was getting hammered and went down below 230......stock will bounce back, And it has very nicely. Have faith CLX holders."
CLX reached a new All Time High at $160.77
"Rates will be dropping LIKE A ROCK into the end of MAY. Hint,hint!"
I don't understand why anyone would want to own this trash. You get 3% a year dividend which doesn't keep up with inflation especially this year. The stock price has gone nothing but down the last 3 months. Any given day you can make 3% on a stock in ONE DAY. Absolute trash.
"looks like the short of the century here at $210. When this dies down won't demand for Clorox to die down? This was $150 stock when this started, and it looked overvalued at that point."
sell you fools!
"i only have 10 shares of this, and planning to sell it to buy more APPL or TSLA, but i would be very sad to leave this one.."
CLX reached an all time high at 180.73
CLX raised the dividend 5% so total for the year will be an increase of 20%.
they should buyback shares. might as well take advantage of Fed throwing money around.
A DUD DEAD MONEY!
Why is it going down? Doesn't make any sense!
"I am gere to make money, hopfully CLX will roll up with the Household PRODUCT subindustry. Both the stock and the subindustry look practically identically expect a pull up soon."
"Econ. 101, supply and demand."
CLX is an expensive stock here IMO
Clorox is up 5.57% to 196.82
"Artificial pump after CLX ""beats estimates"" which by the way have been progressively lower the last three quarters. After reality sets in and the long term prospects of Clorox become apparent, price action nose dives....eventually making it's way back to pre-pandemic levels."
Any near term catalysts?
CLX reached a new All Time High at $156.80
Jorge - old news. In case you haven't noticed has fallen from 205 in just a few days
"It will be up 2-5% sometime tomorrow. It will be dragged a bit by the large cap action, whatever it is tomorrow."
Nice. Uptrend with pennant. At least 195 in the next few days. :P
Here comes the squeeze on the 11 million CLX short shares with 4 days to cover Longs don not sell a single share
"Facts, not conjecture:Two countries have over 700 cases with zero reported deaths, therefore mortality rate of 0%, Czechia and Israel. Israel doesn't surprise me, very strong healthcare system, Czechia though, I find surprising.Germany, over 17K cases with only 44 deaths, mortality rate of .25%The two outliers are China and Italy which account for over 2/3s of the world's total death count.Does Clorox not sell beach to those two countries?"
Mr S Cat - you should run from this #$%$
"Stock price will try and out-run the predicted PE ratio (which has now been calculated to 25.36). Clorox competitors Colgate and Church/Dwight are sitting at 26 and 30 respectively; they are expected to grow over the next few quarters, Clorox is not. Do not be shocked when CLX price action tries to front run it's predicted PE ratio...LOWER."
"I went to Walmart to get some probiotics, to help the flora in my digestive track. They had many varieties there, and some with 20 billion cultures, some for older people, etc etc. So I find one I think will work, and its in a box 2 1/2 inches square, and 4 1/2 inches high. It looked like there would be a 90 day or 120 day supply. So I get home, open the bottle, and walah, there are only 30 capsules. A 30 day supply. The bottle was mostly empty, except for the lower quarter inch. These 30 capsules would fit in a pack of gum. But they put it in an oversized box. I'm just glad they didn't say ""contents may settle due to shipping."" But come on. The packaging used is definitely misleading. It would be akin to putting a pint of cough syrup in a gallon jug. As for my gut, it seems to be fine, but that deliberate attempt to deceive me tightened it. Perhaps an honest shareholder will bring it up at the next shareholders meeting."
CSX could easily get to 151.00 dollars per share today
Had this stock since 100! Will never sell. These viruses will keep them printing money a long time.
"Down big today for no reason, time to buy some more."
Is it too late to buy to get the dividend on april 21?
"CLX is opening higher to 187 could wip saw! Good that is going to clse higher today, one day before option expiration."
Olin (OLN) the leading maker of bleach. Enough said. $10.75.
I think CLX is missing the boat by not having a ( Sun screen lotion ) Along with its wipes it another safety factor everyone uses.
I think Clorox is a poorly managed company. They owned the market on sanitary products. Going for they will face severe competition for a slow growth market. They appear to have lost their focus. And got too comfortable during the height of the pandemic. Missed opportunity.
Clorox is down 5.36% to 160.32
"I admit, it went lower. but sticks do just that. What I know that this company has a mote, all my family and your family and your friends family and the vatican uses its products. The blew up earnings and at this prices comoaring the charts it is one of the best bet on town. I t will go to $193, so back up the truck here."
"XXX - maybe if you triple up your posts it will make it go down...(or not). Enough already, we get it - you shorted it.Raj Raj - let if dive off end of today - I agree with you that it is more a 190+ stock than a 170 like some (see above) would want you to believe by their incessant posting."
CLX getting ready to launch!
this is shockingly sad.....
One year ago I said buy and hold..$132.then....just hold drip the div. Good luck longs.
Look at SAM to reflect what will happen to this stock after earnings.
the market is up 650 points and clorox is down .10 cents....wow
It’s about time that this stock has spiked in price!
A steady climb is what I like. We could see a merger soon!
"I’m very new to options, but does a call at 240 sound good?"
it may just go back up before the end of the day
going to 183 in no time
It's heading lower.
"Well Sydney sorry to say the selling is not over. The momentum sellers are betting against the entire consumer space. Does not matter what CLX does.. This is headed to $112, which then would provide the magical 3% yield causing buyers to come in. Good company, but easily manipulated by traders!"
The sell off lately has been too aggressive
PE ratio should not be more than 12
"NEWS!! EPA Just approved Cornona disinfection machine in USA, best one on the market....the same system they using to treat in China, stock is TOMZ. Buy now before before news speeds later today, stock is gonna explode upwards. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/steramist-now-epa-list-n-133010682.html"
CDC just came out with a story that claims far too much emphasis on sanitizer products. Amazing.
CLX...the ultimate Planet Janitor. Even if a virus vaccine presents decent efficacy it will literally take years to eradicate the *current* strain of Covid-19. And the second most valuable products are PPE and disinfectants (and the behavior to use them). But what virus could come next after this one?...Hopefully people will learn from this and use better hygiene. Good luck to all with CLX!
"Sprint and T-Mobile a cash cow, phone and 5g internet an essential"
PE is at a 5 year base. Back to 2018 levels. Seems like you can’t lose long term at these levels
can we expect clorox at 215 by this earning?
CLX is up 5.20% to 174.28
GO CLX that's the way I like it !
Time to buy more CLX.
I am waiting for $170
wow from 223 to 211 #$%$??.....
never seen a consumer packaged goods company with good earnings get hammered like this. It's totally unreal. I was just too stupid and bought high and still holding. I don't see any hope with this stock now. You'd need huge buy volume to get shorts to cover. SHORTS own this TURD now
"Actually had the pleasure of buying Clorox spray cleaner at a QFC yesterday. So, their products are returning to shelves in supermarkets."
"doug - stupid move. this stock is in big trouble, 10 month low"
The Cramer course is real.Cramer said sell and it went from 150 to 200. Cramer said buy and people are selling it.
"I have been waiting quit a while to buy some shares, finally did it today......"
Market going insane. Hotel stocks acting like if we are gonna be back to normal tomorrow. They have the price of 2017.Airlines skyrocketing with no date for flights. Hertz was flying until a report came up they are preparing bankruptcy. People are paying top dollars for companies that are making no money.Its insane
"This is a wide moat stock, don't miss this great opportunity..."
sell or hold ? anyone
"SPLIT,,SPLIT,,,,3-1"
"worst performer within it's CPG group. Kimberly Clark who benefited from COVAD, holding up much better . I guess put a fork in this fuxcker"
"Pathetic stock... Was up big time when market was down... Turned around when market went green (After fed).... That shows it's a safe play .... If the market is green, this will never go up"
Clorox is down 4.94% to 166.35
way overvalued pe for this is ridiculous
"Can't really share MY reaction effectively in this medium, but as a CLX holder since March, I'll be glowing all day."
"Clorox may be an absolute sleeper. Once more I looked over its profile and myriad product lines. Glad bags, kitty litter, bleach, salad dressing, disinfectant items, charcoal, etc, etc..I only own a few shares but I didn't know the company's diverse areas. It could be the McDonald's of household products. - Pete"
I feel safe every time I see my clorox shares.
"I saw Kramer, Mad Money last Friday interviewing the CEO of CLX. Sounds like a product we are going to be using for quite a while. The wipes were very difficult to find in retail stores. They are stepping up production since the demand is so great. Also part of the interview mentioned expanding factories globally."
This stock you just buy some and hold.
Kimberly Clark had a huge runup but not selling off like this pile of dog #$%$
Vaccines for the media fueled Covid hysteria are coming soon.In 4 months the mania ends.
STAY LOW HELL YES HELL YES STAY LOW THANK U
"you have to read in between the lines. We already abeat the estimates! Some broccoli head decides that the outlook doesnt look so favorable???? What does that mean? It means ""irrelevance"" ! As long as there is covid, clx is gonna go up. Its covid proof. You wanna pull it down, good luck!"
"just wait when they lock down the country on the same week we sold off again last year..... i think we are seeing the biggest dead cat bounce ever in the markets. If they lock down again on variants to ""control the spread"" CLX hits all time highs"
"220. that was before I found out about the SHORTS raiding this stock. This stock is finished now. So long as SHORTS keep shorting this pig, it will never go up"
190 wall
"Since the sub household industry is a defencive sector, CLX With its good dividend will provide a nice return moving up from here into exdividend in march."
"Tom - If I've lost what I said I lost, how can I be a shortie. This stock sucks and is in trouble. Getting hammered over last 2 weeks"
CLX is down 4.94% to 166.35
Should have bought at $177 today
"Remember that CLX is a ""dividend aristocracy"" stock. As the Dow goes up, it's average dividend yield goes down, and as CLX goes down, it's dividend yield goes up. CLX has almost always gone down on positive news days since the pandemic started, but when this happens it's dividend yield goes up relative to the other ""dividend aristocracy"" stocks wh'os prices tend to go up."
"""all I know is, if trump hadn't dismantled the pandemic agency, we would be way ahead of the curve..""--JERI"
Cramer still plumping this pig. Sell!!!
There was an article yesterday on ZH saying that the Swiss National Bank has been trimming its stake in tech names. Previously they were buying tech REGARDLESS of valuation per numerous press reports. The only possible explanation for CLX melting up day after day despite 2 bad quarters in a row AND the company announcing they will not be buying back nearly as much stock as they previously announced (since they think their own stock is over priced) is that a entity like the SNB which cares nothing about valuation is buying.
Green on a red day and red on a green day is always a looser stock.
"I just signed up for Reddit and Robinhood, so I cant post there yet. If someone can put a post out to Reddit and Robinhood army about buying CLX on this recent dip, the stock can soar. Look at chart. Some strong buy volume and this can easily go up 30 or more."
Allngood
"The answer to ""Whats behind curtain #3?"" is ""STUXNET""!"
This stock even in the crash of 2008 held up good. That's why I own it.
Really down again bought another 1000 shares thank you. Earnings will be very good.
"It's a no brainer, it's already a multi-billion dollar company, which thrives in a normal market, so why would anyone sell it now when its products are needed most."
Please read the question... Has anybody seen any product on their stores shelves....Simple question...Please DO NOT REPLY with an OPINION... Reply with facts or documentation...THANK YOU
"It’s a not brainer, everyone will be using Clorox, only a idiot would try to short this Company."
Oh yeah babe
hope CEO will do a huge buyback. money is so cheap to borrow.
what wrong with this #$%$ stock. I have 300 shares of failure
I am going to hold my shares. This is a strong company.
This basically has a attention deficiency disorder... That's it.... All it needs is the short squeezers....The way it went from 200 to 220+ in one day.... It can be anyday.....Just put a sell order for 221 and forget... It will probably get executed within a month or so....
Whats going on with CLX today? Its getting clobbered and I can't find any news or reason.
How are CLX shorts going to cover 10 million shares in 5 days?
CLX is down 5.93% to 152.96
this needs a price surge to force shorts to cover. sooner or later the shorts are going to get burned here
completely garbage . glad I stopped my loss at 189.5
the only thing green today. 
"Here we go. Governors of WA, OR, and CA announced recommended 14 day quarantines for people crossing state lines, as if viruses respected state borders. The fear and stupidity is ramping up."
should of bought Kimberly Clark.
I own OLN is it a big secret they are a big producer of bleach? It must be because OLN hits new low daily and the yield is like 6%. Olin Chemical bleach caustic soda and winchester ammunition . cratered every day maybe the balance sheet I'm no accountant every CLX equals 13 shares OLN . Little help with insight would be appreciated
Tesla CEO stood up to the shorting and chased them away. This mgmt must do same
buying at 130
good. i will buy the dip! people act like a vaccine is overnight.
If life gives you Coronavirus- buy Clorox
Why is the forward P/E on CLX 23+% and there's no growth?
Why would anyone be surprised? It's so overvalued it's ridiculous.
"Almost 240 in the morning, what the hell is happening?"
"they should of reported bad earnings, than it would have gone up"
look at one month chart KMB - Kimberly Clark vs Clorox. KMB up $2+ and CLX down $17. That says it all. This stock if #$%$ wasted
Better to short this. You can short it without any fear until 120$
Oversold. There’s room here for a quick trade to make 2%
Guys get ready for 180 today
Short squeeze coming
Double Top Breakout on June 11th. Next target $133.
"This is a real, honest to goodness, unadulterated, utterly horrible worldwide plague we're witnessing. It reminds me of an episode of the Tudors/the sweating sickness part.....The world will have to clean up how we live for a long long time to come. Clorox products, soap, sanitizers and masks will be in high demand for years to come. I'm sorry to say this. - Pete"
"Now that Covid 19 hysteria is fading away, is the party over for Clorox?"
Where is all the bleach? Are people drinking it?
Clorox is down 4.90% to 221.92
who can post on Reddix - please do and ask them to come here
Bringing it down BEFORE they RUN it back up to $222(shaking the tree and getting the weak hands out)
Clorox will keep going up. Covid-19 is back on the rise.
CLX is down 4.92% to 151.87
Don't forget to drink your bleach!!! MAGA
finally
Clorox is down 5.18% to 194.00
Looking for a quick uptick here. Earnings should be solid exdate approaching.
Ready for 120$ within 1 month
"plastic bags and charcoal, I don't buy what the analyst are saying, in consumer goods one area weekend, while another area grows"
when will the CLX nightmare end
This is a buy and hold company.If it dips every once in a while --- its a buying opportunity.They make enough to cover the dividend and continue to buy good brands to add to its portfolio.
Market is soaring and this #$%$ is dead meat
Doubling down on CLX here earnings in under 3 weeks still 9 million shares short out there squeeeeze candidate
This stock is broken. Fell below the 200 DMA on heavy volume. Doesn't look like a winner to me...
"I've been going around airline stocks forums and there is so much wishful thinking. No fundamentals, just wishes.At the end all that matters is the revenue and the profits.And Clorox is having record breaking numbers in both."
"Please, in my opinion, don't panic if you see CLX go down dramatically but keep an eye on the overall market. We may soon have cascading margins calls, and other crazy stuff, that forces liquidation of assets just to raise cash. Peronally, when I see bonds, stocks, gold, oil, all going down, that could be the reason."
"Should continue to do well until there is a vaccine or good therapeutics. After that, no way it can sustain the elevated PE...IMO"
5% dividends increase
I brought at $195 should I hold for the long run
Buy today. EPS will exceed expectations and price will jump up into $190's
"seems like it would be up like zm, I am not getting the down trend."
"How on earth is this trading over 20 times it’s book value? Does that not concern anyone, considering the rest of the sector trades much lower..?"
Dow up 9%Why is CLX in red?
R.I.P. EVERYONE
$200 this coming week my friends. it'll start climbing to $215 right before earnings!!! You decide if you're keeping or selling before earnings! You've been told!
These are flying off the shelves. It will hit 200 and beyond. Next quarter they will post a huge revenue increase and a great forecast. In 2009 when the whole market was in the gutter they went up too from the SARS panic and this time ppl are more scared. Super boring stock but solid in times of crisis
Iam back bought and its a gift thankyou
196 close and 210 next week
I have owned CLX for 13 years and my yield to cost is over 9%. Stay long my friend...stay long.
No but she’s been steady and I’ll take the dividend. Was happy to see the beat.
a great defensive stock!
Hope your all IN!
Down $5 on CHD earnings today. May be a good add today. Anyone buying?
"Sunrise, today is your day to, as Cramer puts it, ""BUY!BUY!BUY!""---CLX----that is!"
"Between CLX and APT, it's going to be a manic Monday for us ""virus investors."""
"Sell CLX here, stores are full of Clorox and so are households! I have years supply +"
"Will hold and buy and keep buying on drops like this. Great company with great products that can stay on the shelves. Production has been ramped up, next earnings will be a blow out."
Timberrrrrrrrrrrr
CLX faces macro headwinds. Short-term Negative.
"Everyone, if you love your money then don't enter before 150$"
Any talk of a stock split?
Clorox owns Kingsford and July 4th is this weekend !! Boom!!
"All three Covid-19 tracking apps I use show a ""second wave"" of Covid-19 in the making over the past ten days or so. (The first wave never really went away, but rather just receded by about 1/3 and stayed there during the riots.) But now daily case counts are accelerating again. I expect the media to pivot from the riots as they die down to hyping the second wave of Covid-19. More emphasis on masks, disinfectant, etc. (I have owned CLX for the past several months.)"
that stock on may will be a bomb
"let me add my two cents worth about CLX. I bought in at $53 six years ago with the intention of riding it up to the $130-$140,a target given by technical analysis and my preference for a large dividend stock to add to my portfolio. ALL THE BODIES (BLOCKS) ARE NOW BURIED AT THE $73! That be the current Bottom in a real crash. If you are impatient and have less than a five year horizon with CLX, or any other stock, you are a speculator and NOT an investor! You should be using the dividend to by more CLX currently and for the ride back up to the $130 ($111.00 or so was the bottom).When and IF this happens you are looking at a $200.00+ target from the $130! Otherwise stand back and wait for the $70!"
"Think it's too late to jump in? Or will earnings push this further up? Been seeing a ton of this product move here where I work, figured maybe buy in. by the way, movement of this product has not slowed down one bit!"
"Perfect safety stock in a crisis. Upward or little to no price movement, good well supported dividend, demand for their products is inelastic. I've already made 14% with this company in just over a day. Plan to hold it throughout the duration of the crisis, which is far from over."
I don't believe Covid-19 is killing all these people but in steady its 99% underling conditions as it has been forever... but because other are pushing the Covid thing CLX is going to reach $300.
stocks go up.stocks go down.has been true since the dawn of time.
"To anyone who may have shorted this stock, please consider how you'll feel if you end up being taken to the cleaners by a stock named ""Clorox."""
"There going to keep having great sales as covid ain’t going away and even after it goes away by next year or so, people will be more than Ever health conscious and will continue to by cleaning prods in Great demand"
"Just got my CLX annual report via email. Anyone else? Just loved what I read. On page 13 it says that there will be a second in-house production line for wipes, which will double their production by 2021."
What happened to CLX stock price? It doesn't really kill germs?
Observation on the week ended 3 Aug 2018: Not Bad!
"Yeah, this is why I invest in growth stocks and not trash dividend stocks lol. FANG for life"
wow they beat earnings by 50%
Guys someone pls explain why Clorox is $176 and RBGLY who own LYSOL and Airborne is only $15???? I’m not the sharpest toolIn the shed but seems logical to me that LYSOL will sell now and years to come after this germ fest!!! Thanks for feedback pls.
considering stop my loss if it breaks 190
"From what I read Old CEO has stepped down, New CEO takes over and insiders might be cashing in. Also Zack's reports Earnings is questionable that is coming. I find that hard to believe. I know they had to step up production to keep up with demand. I guess you have to go with your gut. I hold MSFT and they beat ER and stock went down. Figure that out. Beating ER does guarantee stock increase."
dow jones bounced back nicely and this #$%$ #$%$ down.
Only fools should be selling this.. Look at the absolute numbers.....It was a good result....
I don’t wanna get clapped 
"It's scary how most companies are either expecting a horrible yr worse than 2008 (or some simply losing money) and they are rallying to 2017 levels but Clorox which anyone with a brain knows will report record revenue and profits, barely gets love."

"Looks like we'll see the $135.00 some time in April. If this is too rich for you PG is finally a good alternative, even NOW!"
bought 200 shares. this is too cheap
CLX would make a tasty target for a foreign buyer.
why is the stock dowm so much
this stock will never see 200 again and mabye not even 190
Clorox should go much higher once schools begin to open up
going back to 125... pe of 20 for a bleach company.. come on now
Should see a dip to 150 or so in the morning
VOTE AGAINST ANARCHY - VOTE TRUMP 2020

Why is stock down 3%?
"I made enough on CLX, and moved on today."
I don't see anything appreciative about this great stock.
"Jumpin Jeezus, Mo. I would 'like' to thank you for your attempt at some timeless and prescient feedback, but I can't. When you take two posts to say... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, then clearly you need a time-out... or a nap. What are you... 11 years old?"
"haha, I told you guys several times, this will not see 200$ in at least the coming two years."

Where's the bleach?
"i wouldn't hold on to this iF you're just trading it. short term its going to pullback to 125-126. long term its deF a buy/hold. within a year it'll be trading above 180 IMO. just my 2 cents, what do you think? I think next 2 weeks will continue to be volatile and well see more down days than up. I really see CLX back to 125"
I guess some profit-taking today
$165 it’s a buy
Morgan-Stanley - LOL. We see you shorting the stock! Blatant price manipulation. Hope y'all get burned bad!
CLX is a great defensive stock in this type of market. The demand for their products will only continue to increase over time and it has great fundamentals as well. Today's slight dip was a great time to get in.
Monday 200+
Unbelievable and baffling again the biggest fear is selling and having to go up Well I’ve said that every day
This company has really bombed. Can’t find wipes anywhere. Supply chain must be very limited. When there’s a vaccine it will tank.
I urge all of you to join the class action and to file complaints with SEC
"this company is actually really diversified, with a lot of products besides bleach and cleaning."
Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on CLX? Im not sure about you guys but https://getstockdorks.blogspot.com/ has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
going higher 168-170 by end of week let it ride
Nice 10 cent beat! How will the stock react??
Up 6.6% today around noon.
buying under 130
"Better than expected earnings, but lowered the outlook. Higher commodity costs expected. Down day maybe!"
The GUYS that are shorting and buying PUTS on CLX are going to lose LOTS OF MONEY LOLOLOLOL
"the stock price is determined by us, the investors, we listen to analysts but many of us know that they just offer shamanism, like populism it really doesn't tell the truth and it more about promotion. How many of you have read an analysts's article and thought hey they left out a key details that would effect their overall thesis and yet we let them do it because they seem to have a somewhat convincing argument ? ... go back through their earlier publications and check how many times they have been correct or completely off base and you will be shocked with most! CLX is going up, how can it not? ... it's the market leader and a household name, if they released a covid-19 cleaning kit tomorrow we would all consider buying one. Their business is "" 2/3 cleaning products now not 1/3 "" (information before the covid-19 crisis). I own it, but I'm long and have 100% confidence the CLX will still be around well after 80% of the bio-tech covid-19 test/treat/vaccine manufacturers will be. Zacks upgraded it today at 1pm."
Hey KellTrac - how you feeling about that big buy at 193

Why is this dropping ?? Can someone shed some light pls
waited...today is the day i am buying in... wanted a position since June of last year here if my entry. Way oversold now
Clorox reached an all time high at 221.70
Shorts are on this like a pack of hungry wolves. Once my position in WMT turns green I would like to rotate 6 figures into this
Please tell my my calls aren’t screwed
As I wrote 3 weeks ago this plague will linger. Clorox products will be necessary and relevant for a prolonged period into the future. I still wish otherwise and I want to be wrong. Millions refuse to be vaccinated also btw. Best wishes. - Pete
Don't worry longs...there might be another pandemic in the next 5 years that spike this stock again. There's always hope! In the meantime I'll be cashing in on these shorts. Good luck.

CLX - i have core position and also trade. Buy in $180s and sell in $190s.Lighten core position at $210+Add to Core position in $170s or $160s if it gets there.Enjoy dividends on core position.Make extra income through weekly options. Sell covered calls. Sell cash covered puts.With CLX one can rinse and repeat. Year after year. There's no euphoria. No recession. No shocks. No surprises. This is a tension free money maker: 15-20% return every year!

"Caution on Clorox...pricing is now highest in last 15 years. They did not plan for a Virus Bump, but got it anyway...good fortune but not good strategy. Low cost foreign producers will squeeze profit out of this consumer segment."

Increased pricing is a good way for CLX to go.They need to pass on increasing costs to customers without hurting sales.
"The ""news"" I saw on CL yesterday was completely FAKE! A feast for ""snowflakes""!"

"I am out of this one so no dog in the fight currently....but I gotta admit....this is one I do not get. 2-4% sales growth (at best) and every single quarter there is some issue that Wall St. just decided to ignore. Yet, it sells at a valuation resembling an internet growth stock."

This should have been up 5% today.

I filed a class action suit and contacted SEC regarding the shorting in this stock
it will be 250 dollar in next 2 months with this quarter result. additional use of cleaning product is not going down for a while as market open more will be used. we saw the sales spike 17% from a year earlier in march quarter when the covid number were beginning. this quarter we will see the real impact. this stock may double in a year as well. lets wait and watch
"whats wrong , I thought it was a solid company"
Expect trade situation with Canada to be resolved with-in the next 3-6 months.

"I wouldn't think this would go down today, but I've been wrong before."
When is next earnings? Everywhere showing different dates.
Clorox is down 4.90% to 211.29
CLX is up 4.90% to 163.48
Why is there no bleach in the stores? It's either incompetent management or they are slowing down production to increase the price.
disappointed no need for the premarket sell off.. probably grabbed and ran off to workhorse
customers will be buying ziplock bags for all the parties being thrown for the holidays
"Clorox is a solid stock, with this in your portfolio, you may lose a sock in the laundry, but you will never lose your shirt."
Trouble is that everybody bleach.
I think we were due an up day
Woopskeepdeepbeepsibitybeep!!! That’s not where the carts go!
Clorox is up 5.02% to 212.51
Technicals have just switched to a buy. Wish me luck...
Analysts downgrades coming as stock is richly valued
I just sterilized my portfolio. Feeling a lot better now! ;-D
"Wow, pulled the trigger at $209 today....CLX is a solid consumer staple safe as can be in this pandemic environment. Going forward everyone will continue to disinfect using Clorox products."
What is everyone's guess at where this stock closes on Monday?
Did I read that right? They only missed it by a penny. Wow they should really have the stock price clipped by 10 bucks
i knew i shoulda bought more but this a 150$/share stock every time it gets to a hair of 140 back down it goes

I was in Costco the other day and they were selling CLX bleach by the case. The cases were moving off the shelves as quickly as they could fill them up again. Earnings on %/1 ... I would not be short. This will start moving higher now till earnings.

Clorox is reliable right now-don’t sell
Let us go 260-270 today. Up beat earnings
CLX will be a BUY as long as COVID is around. Probably several years at least.
we have a winner here!
"Please don't promote this stock, as you will be doing so knowing you made money off a bad event in earths history."
When does Clorox report??
Come on...need to get back to $178
220 after er?
"With only 18 million shares for both ( shorts and longs combined), 85% or more own by big boys, interesting how shorts can find available shares to cover their position"
Just unreal how KMB - Kimberly Clark stock is kicking Clorox #$%$
Why down so much today?????
Some time before the end of this year there will be an announcement of a vaccine for Coronavirus and all the hype surrounding this stock will fade and the price will drop like a stone.
Jorge - please explain better your point. There appears to be no bottom with this stock. So you're buying puts
I made a video about The Clorox Company ($CLX)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDUN2UUEp-I
"So the market is freaking out about a virus, and the company that sells virus killer is still down....Tell me how that makes any sense."
Next order set at $176
I'd be thrilled with a plateau above 200 a month or two.
So why are all the consumer staples down today and this more ? Trade wars and tariffs ? I bought this morning.
"Bought in today, why not, when markets sell off, everything goes down even the winners. how can clorox lose in this mess, we can say the same with Amazon, Twitter to name a few. EPA lists three clorox products as effective against the virus. Like duh"
3352 Week Range 144.12 - 178.88Who can call the bottom?Dow futures down 1000No one wants to try and catch a falling knife.
Sold this in Dec...regrets.
caused by Shorts.Be patient.
Yet another Cramer joke
if everybody's buying bleach why is this tanking....hmmm... they are glad to take your money
people are loading up right now and waiting for next earning call.
JIM Cramer has the CEO of Clorox on tonight....I expect a late run higher going into close then depending on how the interview goes we could be up AH nice. If orders for clorox bleach are big because of Virus we could go up dollars tomorrow. we sit and wait.
something is dragging on this stock the last 4 days or so since topping out at 194
You guys are paying 195+ for a 1-3% top line growth company. All the value here is in its dividend. Even with corona theres very little upside at this price point.
What is happening with this stock? 3 days in the red.
#CLX Technical indicators are looking bullish. Long over 158.88 for a run up to 185.58. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/CLX.gif
Makes no sense
"D.A. Davidson starts off coverage on Clorox (CLX -0.1%) with a Buy rating on its expectation for a long-lasting heightened awareness of the role of disinfecting in public healthAnalyst Linda Bolton Weiser: ""The majority of the higher demand for disinfecting products is coming from incremental household penetration, not just stockpiling or higher use by existing households... We believe habits around disinfecting are changing for the long term, and that Clorox's sales may NOT decline in the high-single digits in the second half of fiscal 2021 (when prior-year comps get hard) as the consensus is projecting.""The firm assigns a price target of $256 on Clorox vs. the average sell-side PT of $194.19."
"Fundamentals don't lie. Regardless of how brutal the crisis is, if your sales are through the roof, you are safe.February 18 price: 164March 15 price: 167Dow on Feb 18: 29300Dow on March 15: 23,000 (about Fed heroin injection, if not its 21500)Simple as that."
This stock is a buy as long as they’re out of stock on the shelves of Walmart.
Stock is on sale right now. Will easily return to $132-$133 soon
Finally people realized numbers were excelent. 250 is a decent target for 2020 year's end.
My God Bless Mr. Sullivan 
Why doesn't Warren Buffett buy this company ?$30 Billion cash would easily do it ! He sure has the cash !
Yesterday's pullback way overdone.
Clorox reached an all time high at 229.11
why is this tanking????
Where's the short squeeze??
Up
250 next 2 weeks
Consumer Defensive = $$$
Why is Clorox going up. The pipeline of stock has been empty for a month?
Wow book value $6.04 ??? according to yahoo
"As a long who still expects to see $210 by the end of the year, a little frustrated the dividend wasn't increased, even by a penny."

This shouldn't be tanking.
Dropping again 
going to 160 after guidance feb. 4th after earnings as to disinfect all of china
"Oh no Mr. Bill, they found out it was the CV scam, not the CV scare."
diversify your portfolio... it will come back
Jailed the manipulator
"all we have is sellers, no buyers. where is the bottom, 160?"
"Bob Presley - no, I dont want to jump out and run to something else. Done that before and been burned. This should be showing a bottom and should bounce soon. If not, I take my huge loss and #$%$ quit this scam stock market. Its so rigged it's not even funny. Just #$%$ stocks with earnings going up like crazy. No one wants to own quality anymore. #$%$ joke"
Earnings just around the corner big profits coming.and the exdate not to far out
time to short this pig
#$%$ down 21 in 5 days while market up everyday
"This thing is gonna fly through earnings, no way it doesnt.Its true that Clorox doesnt only sell bleach but lets get real here. Their factories are working 24/7 instead of 12/6. You simply cant find their stuff. Its probably going mostly to hospitals that are using it by the gallon in every room. You cant even find baby wipes because people are buying it to clean, so what do you think is left for clorox wipes.Clorox had just expanded their production capacity, check their latest report. They basically got new production plants and machinery, so this crisis hit when they were ready to go.In supply chain, when demand increases and factories work 24/7, the profit margin increases too. They probably are paying people overtime and its not making a dent.Revenue up, profits up, cash on hand up, less debt. People that are saying this should be sold because its expensive are insane. Its expensive when you consider last quarter's earnings per share, not this. They outperformed the market last recession due to SARS fears. Imagine now that you cannot buy their stuff unless you make a line at Costco at 8AM the day of the week their stuff arrives."
"Imbeciles selling, as if Earth will stop cleaning. Hahahahaha!!!"
this stock just keeps going up
Cramer is saying clx is skyrocketing while it only gain 2% this guy is so funny
"dont get me started about the bathroom, Clorox bleach spray is the only thing that works"
Switch to P&G. P&G has better growth and dividend yield
CLX is a fantastic steal here at these levels. They’re next 3-4 quarters are going to be earth shattering. and I’ll be willing to bet a lot of germaphobes will emerge coming out of this pandemic and last for the next two decades
"This may explain yesterday's decline:With a host of consumer products on Canada's list of tariffs, Campbell Soup (CPB) fell 2.6%, Clorox (CLX) sank 4.2% and Tupperware Brands (TUP) lost 5.1%. Mexico's tariffs included food shipments, and producers including Hormel HRL and Tyson Foods (TSN) were in the red, losing 3.4% and 3.9% respectively.I hope the trade issue gets settled quickly."
"this is going back to 130, good buying opportunity at those levels"
Expect a big raise before April 21. That's the ex dividend date. Shorts dont wanna pay it.This will gain 35 dollars a share in the next 30 days
I should have waited for the conf. call.....any feedback from the call? hope to see 150 near future....
stppped my loss at 189.5 . totally garbage
not looking good premarket. wonder how low we go today
Go! Go! Go!
CLX is down 4.93% to 160.39
a day like this makes me want to wash my my white clothes in bleach
looking good keep moving
"Terrific company, but overvalued stock. I'll start buying when the forward P/E is <18. Yes, likely in the $1xx.00 area."
Dropped to far a gift. will add
The issue here is the Pandemic PEAK.....earnings will likely decline in the next year or two from the crazed purchasing of cleaning products. So earnings go down and the multiple will go down. Stock will likely trade lower. If they earn $8 well then the stock is trading at 23 times. Seems excessive. 8 x 16 seems more reasonable.....$130 seems more attractive.
i bought more today!
"Covid19 spike and market index green, I'm surprised CLX is in the red."
This is the only stock i feel safe buying...
"Visit Clorox's web site and see that they are running their disinfectant factories 24/7. I'd bet they know how to disinfect their own factories and keep everyone safe too. These plants have been identified as ""critical infrastructure"" by the federal government, so they will not be shut down."
market down 400 dj clx up 1% got in yesterday at 156 safe place to be expect great guidance Tuesday heading back to 165
Clorox is up 4.95% to 176.07
Loving the AH action. Hope it carries over.
"Uber (NYSE:UBER) is partnering with Clorox (NYSE:CLX) to provide about 600,000 containers of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes to drivers in the pilot cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.Riders will receive an in-app notification that the arriving driver has wipes prior to being picked up.The pilot program launches in July and could roll out to additional cities soon."
"we're in trouble folks. people think COVAD is over. States are relaxing restrictions, people are acting like COVAD is over because cases are dropping and because of all this , people don't believe they need to sanitize or clean or do the things they were doing when COVAD was at its peak"
Management is stuttering and stammering as to why they bought back so much less of their own stock? The average price they did buy back at was $129.00. So clearly they think it is way too expensive to buy at this time. So why should anyone else buy it? Because cat litter sales are so great? And who even used charcoals anymore? Don't most people use gas BBQs? I haven't used charcoal for decades.......
What’s a fair entry on this?
"Keep buying on dips, with or without vaccine CLX has lots of upside potential. 240 before year ends."
UP we go CLX!
take some of your money and put it in TOMZ guys. Do your research first
"#$%$ IT - SOMEONE CONTACT THE REDDIT ARMY TO GET THEM IN HERE. LOOK AT WHAT THEY;RE DOING TO POT STOCK ACB, UP $4 TODAY AND OVER $6 THIS WEEK. SHOULD OF BOUGHT POT STOCK. CLOROX DEAD #$%$ MONEY"
"It will recover. Patience. Let time do its thing. if you're worried about this stock's movement and selling for losses you need to find a new hobby. Sincerely, $111 per share owner and recently bought big again at $193."
And this is why CLX is such a great defensive stock.
"CLX will have record sales the next two quarters for sure, and prolly all of 2021. The reason is vaccines cannot be distributed as fast as they say. It will take close to a year at least. In the meantime, masks and lockdowns will continue."
this is woodshed #$%$ brutal. Has to be more to it.
"Pre market very lack luster, could open red"
CPB looks like similar trade to CLX .. 3% divy and 15 million shares short looks like squeeze candidate .. defensive trade
Somebody tell me why this stock goes down when the rest go up and it goes up on red days?
"Well I had to say one more thing because the reaction count was 666 and I own the stock. Everyone knows that this next earnings report should reflect the full 500% increase in demand for Clorox Inc.'s core products, right?"
at the end it might be a green day for CLX
I wonder why its going down also. One thing i have noticed about some stocks. When its about 30 to 40 days prior to Earnings reports they tend to go down. I am thinking the institutions that own them are shorting them and will buy back as it get's closer to earnings. That way they make a profit on the short and a profit on the long. I may buy some November Call options
By the end of summer $215
I’m looking for my dividend bump today or tomorrow.
"A nice $20 Plus Haircut.... For no reason other than people like LA, etc...."
"CLX put options Feb 26 series actually went up as the stock ralley above $185. The Feb 19, and Feb 12 drops as per delta."
Shortings is easy but finding shares to cover is a problem
Clorox is up 4.93% to 223.50
Waiting for a good entry point...thinking $211
"Clorox should buy tomi environmental, together they could disinfect the globe!"
Not much growth
"CLX, could easily get to 151.00 today"
This thing will rise over $200 today
I hate option buyer. they just ruin the stock governed by actual value by forcing market to manipulate

"This is one of the worst quarters I can remember seeing. The quarter was absolutely horrible. The only growth was due to an acquisition, they missed revenues, the only reason they beat on earnings is they cut advertising and had a lower than expected tax rate. Gross margin went down. Input costs are going up. Revenue growth for next year is only 2-4%. They are relying on price increases to offset input cost inflation. I guess the $1.0B they said they expect to buyback in FY 2019 supporting the price as there is no logical reason this stock should be up. The analysts who put sell rating on this a couple of weeks ago will be reiterating these I would assume. Really bad quarter."
CLX forum is even dumber than WMT
It should bounce up once the profit takers are gone
Total garbage stock
the Longs are cleaning up!
I guess is time to buy more CLX then.
very weak . no fuel to go up
a nice safety net price is the low end of estimates 7.35 and 15 times.....110
this looks like free money down here. usually things aren't that easy. nevertheless couldn't let that pass. bought a truckload 157 something with a 155 stop loss.
"Weird - I can see a small correction in CLX but why the selloff? Holding existing position and today I bought June $160 calls at $6.90. The only way to play this market is with ""in the money"" or close to ""in the money"" calls. CLX should be a defensive position but I guess if you have to sell, you sell what you can, not what you want to. I have been in the market for half a century and except for 2008-9 crash this is the craziest I can recall."
Bullish uptrend forming
"Worried about being in an expensive stock? If you sell take a look at AEO. They trade at 12X; well under most of its peers who continue to repeatedly warn. AEO had a profit of 39% last Q and raised guidance. They have no debt, a $28 mi buyback, a 3% divi and 35 mil shares short. A close above 16.83 and they will be in breakout territory. 35 mil shares short are in big trouble. Yesterday analyst Rebecca Duval put a $22 PT on AEO and Jeffries has a $25 PT"

"Another Crammer fave taking a major dump and he says nothing, LOLDon't you love Crammer?"
With interest rates rising this stock will be valued less as the dividend will fall below the rate on gov't bonds. So it will be valued more on earnings growth and less for the dividend. A 21 PE on next year's eps seems too high even after today's 7% drop.
OVERSOLD!!
Just bought 1000 shares big money ahead
bring the buyers to CLX and you will see a squeeze like never before. this can squeeze easily to 210
Holding 50k in Clorox until the next earnings!! Wish me luck

Still seeing 10 million CLX short shares ..are they nuts ?? Their last quarter was huge.. the one coming up on May 1 will be gigantic
CLX is up 5.00% to 207.77
Short squeeze coming tomorrow
Retreating to 6 month MA perhaps?
all the stores are sold out....
"For all the shareholders, the tricky thing with this is, it is very difficult to guess the bottom about. My target is 100$. At 100$ you can put the big amount to average down and run away at break even."
With this stock I can be so calm
This is going up Monday morning don’t worry. Only down cause market worries.. COVID is here to stay. They ramping up production big time
Don't fret the share price! Clorox is gone woke with a new Fem CEO to lead the Bonobo males around by the hand.
"I purchased this stock when the pandemic started, and I've been watching it every day since, and I don't recall ever seeing a two point jump after hours. Tomorrow may be interesting."
Don't worry longs. CLX got a strong support around $145.It will take long time but eventually it may recover.
I expect the same for clx as the increase in sales for lysol brands. They eliminated the weak hands and now we will see a surge into this afternoon. Good news tomorrow will be humbly appreciated. GLTA!
Can we expect an extra dividend?
Do you guys think a call is a good move on Monday due to Earnings Report or do you think it will miss estimates?

coming back down to earth? The volume of yesterday's selloff was twice as large as the usual daily measly sub 1 mil. The only one who is pumping it is a notorious pumper'n'dumper zacks. All the insiders sold last week and a weeks before. Risky.
Cvs is a very similar trade to CLX .. 3.5% divy and extremely low peg ratio (large growth potential)
With a heavy heart sold my CLX which I had bought in $130s earlier in 2019 for $208 and went short. Will cover under $200. Will not buy again until it is back in $140-150 range.
This gets close to 220 and I am cashing in.
See interview link in below message
126.57 better than I thought. 132 would be fantastic in 3 weeks. Iam buying all I can.
Stocks like Clorox and Coca Cola will always be with us. Try to buy low but.....

"I'm buying some fresh shares ..nice PE and EPS, and the dividend is a MONSTER..20 shares in the am"
Still seeing 10 million CLX shares short out there this should squeeze
CLX is back in the Buy zone. Did not buy anything today (I think it may touch low 180s early next week) - but sold weekly put options for $182.5 and $180.This will be $200+ before you know it.
buying more long for my son
Still seeing 9.1 million CLX shares that are short could be a good time to double down
Bought at the lows can't beat this solid dividend grower.....
this stock is pure #$%$

Cleaning and disinfecting is not going no where! Don’t give your shares to people who will love their juice dividend you still can’t find Clorox wipes at the stores even with vaccine out !
Clorox should buy WD40 (WDFC) - that stock has been beaten down lately - and it seems like it would be a nice fit - based California like Clorox

If it does not end green today with such a strong market day then all longs accept that you made a mistake and sell this stock. Let's short make money on this.
What happened this morning to CLX?
CLX trying to reach about $187
CLX is a very safe stock. Cleaning never goes out of style. Great safe dividend stock for retirees.
CLX is up 4.93% to 183.31
Lysol(RBGLY) is also another stock to buy. They have proven record for cleaning virus and selling great.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cleaning-product-makers-race-labs-130336321.html

"I don't get this. If there's one company you would think would benefit from the pandemic, the first one you'd think of may well be Clorox. Yet it has underperformed the market in the last year from what I can see, or at best performed in line. It posted what seemed to be great earnings. What's going on? (Disclaimer: I am long Clorox and this is obviously not financial advice and investing comes with risk)"
"I used to think pizza was the most important thing in the world. I think everyone now is going to realize ""clean and healthy and alive"" is the most important thing! We are going to $260 before end of year."

Closing today 5/1/2019 above 153....close to 154 or above.....Good luck to longs.....I think this is one of the kind Moat as Buffett says....

Someone or something snuck in and bid CLX way up in the last few minutes of trading. Am I the only one who's wondering what's going on?
Cramer sold out at $170 a share. IDIOT!
Why is CLX up after hours. Pre market is down over 300
Downgrade after downgrade to SELL no less and this thing keeps going up. Unbelievable.
The household product subindustry has more legs to move up before it reaches shortterm support.. CLX and the rest of the group are up from todays earĺy lows.
Have owned CLX for over 14 years and it is a boring stock. The dividend has gone up every year.
JP Morgan at it again. They did the same downgrade thing last year at the same time.
CLX has been replaced on store shelves so one must conclude CLX is losing disinfectant market share. Hope other products are making a differing covering the gap.
"Here in Berkeley CA no wipes at any supermarket, CLX still selling their products like hot cakes!"
"I have to think that this sell off is a gift. I've been looking into jumping in on this stock for some time and now (yeah I know I'm late as hell) it has to be de risked. Here's my thinking on how Clorox is in a win-win: If the shutdown is extended then the demand is there for people to buy the disinfectants, which you can't find on the shelves, so that's is the win that everyone is focused on. But, what I feel that everyone else is overlooking is that as the re-opening starts, there will be more demand for their products. An example of this was that I recently went to a clothing store to finally buy some needed shirts. At the counter, the cashier would spray disinfectant spray after each sale on the counter. Whether you think that is overkill or not (I think it was because she was wiping down an area that was not touched by the customer nor was it breathed on because of the plastic shield on the counter and the mask worn by the customer) it shows that this is what companies will have to do in order to keep customers coming in and not be afraid of catching the virus. Now imagine a fully opened economy and the lingering fear of getting sick and every cashier wiping down every counter after every sale. And this extends past the department store and into all other businesses (think restaurants, bars, anything for that matter). That has to be an even better situation for Clorox than what we have now. I guess the only down side to this would be if they could keep up with the extra demand."
"CEO bought 20,000 shares at 159, form 4 released yesterday..."
At my local Wal Mart the Clorox is sold out
"When CLX hits $180, I hit the Buy button. $ Short Term: MFI in Oversold. Stable businesses like CLX always find Buffets with deep pockets.$ Mid Term: Low interest. High Liquidity. Gold/USD/Oil uncertain. Boring Bonds. All equities running hot. $ Long Term: Permanently higher sense of sanitization and safety. Day cares, Nurseries, Airports, Gyms."
anyone know why we are tanking? huh
Wow. Guessed wrong on this one
Let's hope CLX reports a positive surprise. tomorrow. The new products and price increase may help mitigate the added logistic costs.
Time to short?
"What’s wrong Clorox Shorts, are they stupid?"
"Benjo, you should know by now, that the market movers drive the small retail investors into ""safe havens"" and once they corral them there they sink the island, they have already done it multiple times with Clorox as well as the entire sector and also with the utilities. The markets are being gamed like no other time in history. There is no logic to it other than the wealthy will become wealthier and the middle class will get screwed, what else do we need to know?"
What killed CLX today? Was it in fact the ceo change?

I think this will see 170$ today
"american families hoards a lots of CLX's products, which will dramatically disrupt its business."
We need another $200 spike
Any idea how the company is spending its free cash flow? Quick look at the financials indicate to me that financially the company is pretty secure. Surprised that the free cash flow for the ttm was over $1B and as a ratio of the revenue it was something like 16%. The ratio of EBITA to debt was around 2. But where is the free cash flow going?
Is the CLX Reverse Merger still on with PASO?
I was just think back about the time I was in the new building in Pleasanton Ca during construction. You would have thought it was a national defense building with all the wiring going thought the building. Secrets for sure what's in the Makings.

CLX has raised the dividend 19% this year...how much has FB raised their dividend...
"Up almost five points at half average volume for the day. Few want to sell this, and some really want it!"
This has been pathetic off late... I thought I was entering at a good point... Unfortunately not :(....It was down from 221 to 192... Now it's 187... Definitely work of shorties....
when are they raising the dividend???
"The problem is the mentality of Clorox management, they did not ramp up production drastically when it was required. they have not added any new manufacturing lines. they themselves are of the view that this increase in requirement is temporary. meanwhile, all other retail chains have come up with their own brands to fill the gap. this opportunity which could have been a gold mine for Clorox could turn into a disaster of their own making."
dropping nicely.
Do ya'all know that Clorox makes Pine Sol and Kingsford Briquettes?
This is going to leap after ER

still seeing 10 million CLX shorts out there .. huge growth potential / nice 2.5% dividend CLX is a squeeze candidate
"With only 125M shares for the float and shorting running about 10%, seems the stock is a candidate for manipulation. Is anyone else surprised by the amount of shorting done on CLX? I suppose part of it is related to the ""buy the rumor"", ""sell the news""."
large volume doesn't lie
Get ready for the J&J vaccine. More downside is coming.
"Hi. I would like to have a real discussion and i am curious as to thoughts on the following. I wrote this on Seeking Alpha to a bearish author (Chris Lau) who didn't respond:1. You indicate that Wipes etc are being hoarded and there will be a demand crash. Except: people are using Clorox wipes and sprays every single day and there are very few homes that aren’t almost out. People are trying right now to buy more and can’t and therefore they actually have unfulfilled demand, not stockpiles2. The best epidemiologists are saying that without total lockdown we will be passing back and forth the virus for many months. Therefore people will need to maintain a high level disinfection going forward correct?3. People point to China - however China is operating today in a much more locked down mode. They are continuously disinfecting, wear masks, limiting travel etc. therefore- even in places that are “under control” they are using a high level of cleaners/disinfectants correct?4. The entire supply chain has zero Clorox products for retail. I believe it is all being diverted to our hospitals and first responders (who deserve and need it! Thank you to all of them for their heroic efforts). I just checked every major retailer and all have zero. How long will it take for Clorox to both fill all this unfulfilled retail demand And rebuild supply chain inventory?5. Traumatic situations like this often change consumer behavior for years. How long do you think people’s behavior for using Clorox products will be changed?6. Clorox is a big fixed cost production platform. Big industrial plants are much more profitable when they can be operated 24*7. Shouldn’t we expected improved margins for quarters if not years to come?7. Before this mess, Clorox has to advertise and discount to sell. For the foreseeable future they now have the best brand recognition in the US right? Shouldn’t we expect higher free cash flow with less discounting and less advertising?8. I am not 100% sure on the impact of lower oil prices so while i have heard it will help Clorox i really don’t have any analysis to identify what it might be. Any thoughts?9. One of my best friends father just passed from coronavirus 2 days ago. He was treated with 3 different experimental drugs and tragically none helped. Sadly i don’t see any perfect treatment, hopefully we will at least get some help for high risk patients. Do you see a super impactful treatment option in the shorter term?Would love to understand your bearish stance vs these points.Full disclosure i am long Clorox in my personal account but value thoughtful input and discourse"
I knew the Covid-19 panic was fake and just designed to get rid of the great Prez Donald Trump. Now no one so hot for Clorox wipes anymore? I think even the Libs don't realize how much of this pandemic was political. I am long CLX but I think it will cool off now that life will go back to normal and people will throw away their masks.
Cant get over the 125 mark
"the only way to get rid of shorts, is for this to reverse and go green. just dont understand all the selling as if people will never clean and sanitize again"
Let?s compare CLX vs Facebook Yes FB a growing company and CLX an established dividend paying company FB #$%$ off the world and the stock was $195 at its high and now $168 or a 23% declineCLX 52 week high 152 and now $116 that?s 35% on a company that does nothing but perform a company around since early 1900s a company with 6 billion in revenue and it?s 35% down for no reason?Consumers shifting away from established brands? Really ? Was in Target yesterday and Clorox products needed to be restocked
We need some positive news now that CLX gas gotton so low. We need to close higher from here. It is due for a 3 point move by friday above 185.
$140 by 2022
My WMT was sold out yesterday of Clorox. Other brands also. So it's gonna be a good quarter.
According to Zacks: Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Clorox (CLX) reports results for the quarter ended December 2019. (ER on 2/4) Pullback coming.
"CLX has cleared technical resistance, The next barrier is $147. I'm looking forward to new highs for CLX after such a rough start this year."
Up anytime
Seems like not a bad problem for CLX to have. Demand is so high that they cannot make their products fast enough. Their products are selling out as soon as they are put on the shelves. Although there are costs associated with ramping up production this should be money well spent.
CLX has been trending up. It must be the buybacks. CLX is over 80% domestic and less affected by the stronger dollar.
CLX reached an all time high at 207.17
Why is this down more than the other consumer staples?
great dividend news

Anonymous - so true. This has termed out to be the biggest DogCr*p stock. What a disappointing investment!!
What time is ER?
So happy I am out. Going to dive under 100
"Btw those of you wondering if the sales wont be that spectacular because of clorox not being just about cleaning products, a but of a clarification.Clorox is 34%, 20% ""lifestyle"", 30% household and 16% international. From lifestyle, over half of it is water filters and food products, both in at least normal demand.In household, almost half of that are their bags and containers (Glad) which are in higher demand, not as sold out as cleaning but still shelves were half empty for a month. Cat litter might have more than usual sales as well since people will be at home more and pay attention to their cats.Only charcoals sales are down.Then of course have cleaning products with a demand that goes beyond their production 24/7. Two months of products flying off the shelves.Currently Clorox has 33 products that are confirmed by the FDA to kill the coronavirus. These are sold out from March to December, easily. The revenue from these (which in 2019 accounted for 34% of total revenue) this yr will probably increase 200%.The demand also is probably making them save in advertisement and marketing."
"Ok, I’ve had enough. Going to reduce my position and take some losses."
"Check out $TOMZ if you want to see a superior product when compared to Clorox 360 system. My Company just switched over. It is a micro cap, but will take biz away from CLX big time. Their system was developed with DARPA."
"What a great addition to a Clorox holding: PURE. Now the key ingredient in the new USDA approved SmartWash Boost product to disinfect produce. It's not a replacement for chlorine but an important addition. Taylor Farms / SmartWash already own the global produce wash industry, and now with the new patent-pending product can expand on years of expertise."
I hope we end up up today since it wasn't terrible. Market was priced that way.Really tough times for Consumer Staple stocks.CLX could get acquired by a foreign buyer.
What’s going on with CLX this morning?
Would say $250-$300 by end of Year!
Cleaning habits and desinfection are here to stay. With or without vaccine CLX is standing on the right side of this new normal world. BUY!
needed some bleach due to mold on concrete deck....never thought I'd go to cvs close by and it was all sold out...couple days ago.
time for a new ATH :-D
lets get back to 130s
"I think this ship is going down, probably to pre pandemic highs. it might follow the NFLX path by earnings on Friday. just bought some puts"
Extended Covid spikes are good news for CLX. Guessing that guidance will be good based upon rising illness statistics.
When is the er being released?
"This portfolio manager loves $CLXhttps://www.twst.com/interview/selecting-securities-to-own-for-the-long-term""We find Clorox very attractive since it meets, really, the entire list of key characteristics that we look for. The first characteristic is: Does the company own an enduring product or service with a strategic position within their industry? And for Clorox, over 80% of their sales are generated from brands that have a number-one or number-two market share position. Clorox’s ability to consistently deliver strong results over the years is based on its strategy of focusing on categories and markets where it has an advantage and where larger companies have mostly chosen to refrain from operating."""
looks like no bottom here. this makes me sick
Does anyone know if CLX got any TV press coverage this mornings on their great earnings reports?
"""The company delivered sales and earnings growth in all reportable segments."" and that with just one stay at home Corona month included. next report will most likely cover three full Corona months!"
Why is this going down?
"the analyst are wrong about the laundry in the home being down, my wife make me wash clothes twice a week, my kids come home for the weekend and bring dirty clothes"
"just look at chart. when you get a good deal of sell volume like yesterday, stock crashes. but when you get the same kind of volume, but BUY volume, this stock can surge, like it did in late January with Kimberly Clark earnings. Just needs volume and up we go."
we need to run the SHORTS out of town. there is a group of shorties trying to take this down. dont let them. BUY BUY BUY
"From Best Life article yesterday Aug 3 by Sarah Crow:On Monday, Aug. 3, Clorox CEO Benno Dorer told Reuters that the brand's disinfecting wipes likely wouldn't be fully restocked by retailers until 2021.Calling them ""the hottest commodity in the business right now,"" Dorer said that it will be quite a while before the supply of wipes catches up with demand because it requires ""a very complex supply chain to make them."" According to Reuters, polyester spunlace—the material used to make Clorox wipes—is also an essential component in high-priority medical gear like masks, gowns, and medical-grade disinfecting wipes."
Any price under $200 is a steal.
Why the sell off???
Clorox earnings call tomorrow should lead to an increase in stock price because of Coronavirus and increase in demand. Buying the stock at the $181-$183 price range should be a steal before earnings report. Predicting an increase in stock price to $187-$189 per share

"Take back every good thing I thought about CLX. This is being traded like some kind of ""Chinese-internet-IPO-Ponzi"". Unbelievable. The product/company that prevents and kills Covid-19, and its being dumped?? No thanks, I'm out. This is not an 'investment'."
"Lysol (RBGLY) looks to me to be a better ""play"". Better balance sheet, much lower PE and better dividend. Anyone want to tell me I am not correct, please tell me why"
Wow a new low today.
No reason this blue chip should fall today--good long term hold!
A good entry here based on chart looks to be $150. Who agrees?
no worries. the world needs clorox
"Benno delivers in spades, CLEANS-UP, WIPES UP, WASHES UP, SANITIZES, and takes out the TRASH !"
"Goldman must have been caught short recently. Oh, the pain. Better recommend Sell!"
CLX raised the dividend 19% this year my yield to cost is looking pretty healthy...this is not a trading stock have owned it for years.
Hey Kumar - buzz off #$%$ short. Go to another board
"Rob, yes it does, the big money is covertly moving money out of the winners in the latest Black Swain event, they are slowly picking up shares in the horribly beaten down stocks in the restaurants, retailers, truckers, fashion, etc.. Their cohorts in the news media have successfully destroyed the economic momentum, though they know once the reality of a true ""treatment"" for the virus is known and it is, the markets will rocket up. They just can't allow it to happen too quickly, they have to sell all their long positions in staples, utilities, pharma, etc., close their short positions in the discretionary sectors and then buy into the discretionary sectors, you just don't do that in an hour. It takes a bit of time, once the full movement of big money boys is done, the news is allowed to break and Clorox tanks back to 100 range, meanwhile they pump the beaten down sectors to new heights. Sorry, just the facts."
"This will be red by end of day, big money pushing defensive stocks based on a trial pause of one of twelve leading companies for a vaccine, tends to make me believe they are selling to build up funds to dump into the consumer discretionaries which they are tanking today even though very good reports from banks and even Ethan Allan which was having issues well before Covid yet are coming out of Covid in much better condition."
"PUMP,PUMP,PUMP..............This is a message board for CLX !!!"
"Don't ever act on recommendations from Goldman Sachs. They downgraded CLX to ""Sell"" on 7-18-18. It's up $10 since the downgrade."
"Mark, give it a rest. It’s getting old."
Bob Presley = I wish I would have never bought this piece of #$%$
Wow what is happening with all these brand name stocks dying.
I was expecting to see $250 am I missing something?
Too bad incompetent CEO can’t figure out how to expand its production quickly. That’s called lack of creativity! Many missed sales!
this is painful. can't beleive how it's been getting crushed. now at 18 PE
"Is it a good time to add this stock to my portfolio?It has low beta but high P/E ratio and was up a lot since February, but I expect it to grow like that in the next 2 years because of the corona consequences (more hygiene everywhere) so higher demand for their products.what are your thoughts?"

"OAKLAND, Calif., August 20, 2020 – The Clorox Company announced today all Clorox and Clorox Scentiva branded Disinfecting Wipes and Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths received approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for kill claims against SARS-Cov-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, on hard non-porous surfaces. Clorox Scentiva branded Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths are the first floor mopping clothes in the category to kill SARS-Cov-2. The new claims come after third-party laboratory testing proved the disinfectants’ efficacy against the virus with a 30 second contact time on hard non-porous surfaces.“Clorox is a health and wellness company and we know how important it is for people to have the peace of mind the disinfectants they are using are effective against the virus that causes COVID-19,” said Chris Hyder, Vice President and General Manager, The Clorox Company. “We began testing our most popular and widely distributed products on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we will continue testing other products on the virus, so we can offer consumers a wide range of products that are proven effective in fighting the spread of COVID-19. In the meantime, it’s important people know they can continue to confidently use any disinfectants that meet the criteria for use in fighting the spread of COVID-19 under the EPA Emerging Viral Pathogen Policy.”The following Clorox disinfectants have been approved by EPA for efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 with a 30-second contact time: • Clorox Disinfecting Wipes (all scents) • Clorox Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths (all scents) • Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wipes (all scents) • Clorox Scentiva Disinfecting Wet Mopping Cloths (all scents) • Clorox Commercial Solutions Clorox Disinfecting Wipes (all scents)"
CLX releases earnings this week. Let's hope it's a good report. Stock is already battered by the downgrade.
"10 day avg volume is 1.9million and we already have 1.4 million. I think this will soar by the mid morning, who knows if Wall St will knock it back as they always do on a Friday afternoon to lock in some profits. Alternatively maybe peopel know this is a safe place to park some cash for the next 2 quarters. Once/if the economy opens up a bit every workplace will be cleaning like their mother in law is going to be visiting."
Have you ever put Burts bees on a cut or a sun spot on your skin? I do this and it seems to make it heal faster and the sun spots get smaller.
This is the CLX place. Under 200$
What’s the typical P/E ratio with clx? Are we in the zone or still a bit strong?
Have had CLX in the portfolio for 14 years a great boring stock...
CLX is on sale. Close to 2 year lows.
"Make sure you buy before earnings, according to what I read and see now at the supermarkets CLX has ramped up production to meet their huge demands. 250 in november!"
Why is this dragging?
People will continue to use more Clorox products after the coronavirus is over just too be safe. I know we will. IMO
Chris - CLOROX is no longer a quality company. Down 21 in just a few days. Where you been under a rock
Some may think CLX is over bought due to 25+ p/e. This will change once massive earnings beat happens next quarter. Not to mention massive guidance increase.
This is the only red company today
"forward PE of less than 20, CLX will move up from here"
whats the potential of burts bees?
Did you guys see the 3.7 Million dollar Jan 15 $200 Put purchase today?Kinda hard to miss.CLX still seems wildly overextended.
Anyone listen to the call? They must have said something negative
"The only problem now, getting in at $200 a share, to even make an investment worthwhile you want 7-25% gains (being reasonable). Now, to get to let's say 15% gains, you have to invest $50,000 for it to even be remotely worth your time. That $50,000 gets you 250 shares at $200/share - whoopeedeedoo! The stock would have to scream to $230/share to make $5000 now. Is that a worthwhile investment? I could buy almost any dip small cap stock, under $5, and make that in a few hours, let alone years. Great company, but the % gain for your $1 are just not there anymore for me. And if you buy 5 shares, why bother?"
"Does everyone know that Clorox is proprietary? Seems it's more than just a chlorine solution, and it can't just be duplicated by another company. I had no idea just what a lock Clorox has in this area until I looked around a bit."
Clorox is down 6.69% to 203.49
CLX beats on EPS and missed on Revenue. Overall solid.
"I sold, may rebuy later...this was an easy pick...hard to understand why it foundered last couple weeks."
My annual appeal to Clorox - please buy WD-40!
10 million CLX shares looking like an upcoming squeeze
Does anyone have any news ?
"their products sell worldwide like the virus, and their proven to work. Even if a vaccine existed, need for deep cleaning is not going away."
CLX price has never been like this. It was always stableThis is manipulated by Shorts as its market cap is still small ~25B that is a target for big hedge funds.Hold for long. we will win.
Clorox is up 5.35% to 195.40
Common you can finish in Red
Be safe to buy under 150.
Also they said they were having problems producing the Clorox wipes I was at a Walmart today in the middle of nowhere Shenandoah Iowa and they were very well stocked .
"Well, now all we need are a 100,000 RobinHood traders to go into FOMO mode and bid this stock up to 1000 whether it should be there or not. Gotta dream."
RIP clx calls
"The USA is/will be incredibly slow in vaccinating everyone, so don’t think for a minute that Clorox wipes & bleach won’t be in high demand.I came in at $197.74 and I’ll either hold long enough for the divvy on 1/26 or report on 2/4"
At our local Walmart yesterday Clorax was completely sold out. Today the wife went to ourlocal Kroger store and again -- no bleach products of any sort were available.
I wonder how the supply chain being disrupted affect us shareholders? Clorox wipes are a big seller and there will be a lot less to sell.
CLX has cleared technical resistance and can head towards old highs.
"This baby is going into dog house for a while. You can buy their sprays and wipes at TGT, WMT or CVS which also pay dividends!"
Uhhhhhh kind've feel like it's time to take profit here? 200??
"Pre coronavirus clorox 6.2 billion a yr revenue2.7 gross profit610 million profits after research and sales administration.568 million short term debt3.1 billion total debt.This debt that looks high is due to a policy of expansion that began a few yrs ago. Which is actually good news since now that demand went up, they are ready.Just to make a comparison. The cruise industry is high in debt because they were expanding and coronavirus hit at the worst possible moment. In clorox case, it hit at the ""best"" moment.Fears of revenue decreasing due to stockpiling are not sound at the moment. Demand is still through the roof but not only that. People arent just buying it, they are using it. My job bought a lot and are already running out. The pandemic will last a while and people will already change their habits for the long term.Earnings will be amazing.Easily over 210 a share by May in the middle of a recession."
"""by the way I think Clorox is (trying) to bottom"" - Cramer just now. He is correct. I bought at $178 and change the other day after earnings."
Congratulations longs a new low
Why would you sell on the ex-dividend date? Wouldn’t it make sense to wait a day? Or do sales today settle tomorrow so it still counts?
Go to your Walmart store and check if Clorox wipes are in stock! They were sold out at the Costco by me and I used Walmart as a confirmation.
"If Clorox is sold out on-line, in stores, everywhere...How fast do they replenish stock??? If they don't have stock, they can't sell...They don't sell... They make no money...Does anybody know a source that shows replenishment of stock or where Clorox wipes are being made? The lack of stock would seem to show that production is not local... Any ideas???"
"Tom - if this doesn't close green with an up market, game over"
Why would anyone sell here? There are still 10 million CLX short shares / with increased demand for their product line and juicy dividend this stock should be accumulated
"Why is everyone so negative about this stock? It's been going down since I bought it and I'm losing about 2K., and I buy a little when it goes down. With the pandemic, everyone is still buying their products big time, but I don't understand why people are saying it is going to take."
I don’t think many people realize what’s going to go down this Thursday on this stock but it’s going to be big. Anyone on here in this empty chat? I’ll share why and you won’t regret it lol
Not a buy over 140. It's heading south.
"Great blue chip on its own, now with surging demand for its products. 52 week high coming but slow steady pace."
If it was a $20.70 stock and it beat earnings by 50% it would be up to $ 25.00 today
Should a cleaning product company have such a high P/E?
why this garbage so weak
"What? This garbage is moving up, what the #$%$"
Bob Presley - How long have you owned this stock. Do you think it can move higher or is this dead meat now. I have lost a ton but trying to be patient and see if it cant move back towards 200 given the great earnings and outlook
dead cat bounce 170 soon
this stock is pure #$%$ at 10 month low now
CLX is up 4.94% to 140.79
CLX mgmt cmon give us a sign! Ramping up production like you should hopefully.
Stock just 4% below all time high. Just had lousy quarter (again). Google is less expensive. But management appears to be burning shareholder $ on share repurchases. Seems like a bad use of capital. Just saying....
at least this hedge seems to be working....
What is going on? down $10?

#$%$ it. shorts taking over again and will drop this like a turd
$200.00 WhoooHoooo!
"Genuine question. Is it worth taking a small position pre-earnings ? I appreciate genuine responses. To be honest what with kids being home from school, tracking other stocks in my portfolio its hard to find time to do due diligence on everything. GLTA. All indicators are Q1 earnings should be stellar. I know my cupboard is full of their product and sometimes my cupboard makes more sense than Wall St."
Long game...
Looks to open at sub $200
"clorox is a premium brand, just as p&g, apple, etc. they can afford to sell things at premium price-tags. Customers just take the things they need, the trusted brand as usual, being sure they get the quality expected. Price comparison?....."
This is great.....only ten more days like this and I will be even : (
Clorox reached an all time high at 223.94
YES
That meany people bought bleach today? LOL
zacks is old news
"Long term this should be 155 to 165. It was in the low 150's before Covid was known to exist, the company really hasn't created any new products, all the gain is due to Covid which now we hear may disappear by late April or at worse by mid summer. Though it should see higher sales as I think the use of anti-bacterial cleaning products is probably here to stay, just in more reasonable amounts."
It's both a dessert topping and a floor wax!
Why down today?????
another red day for this #$%$ #$%$ stock
in for some money on 2 different calls at 225 price target for Clorox
"Why is Clorox stock falling when Covid (germs) cases are rising, people need to be more cautious about there surroundings, and the company posted great earning for the year. If any company I believe would be doing excellent it would be the guys who offer cleaning/ sanitation products for people to allow people to feel safer + the use for there normal household encounters."
Bleach! Bleach! Bleach!!!
"4-1 Split,,,We Need a Split"
"By the end of this week, it should finish at 170$"
"Astonishing movementThis stock should be lowerInstead, it always comes backNo reason for that"
"CLX is down today because people are selling EVERYTHING. Makes no difference whether quality or garbage, its a clearance sale and everything must go. Don't try to catch a falling knife but when it bottoms, back up the truck."
This plague we're experiencing will not go away overnight. Clorox products will be sought out for years I believe. I wish otherwise but..... - Pete
"195 seems like a good entry point. Next earnings have to be superb, all those wipes missing from the shelves mean something!"
Hope it jumps 
down $20K on what is supposed to be a low risk safe stock. #$%$ joke
this could easily retrace to sub 180
Don't worry. People will have gotten used to be more hygienic and the products will have greater demands
My only patch of grass in a sea of blood.
Over priced waiting for down grades and price targets of 175 where it should be priced.Flattening of covid and traders will all try bailing out at same time
CLX has 90% institutional ownership and 10% Short Shares..basically most of shares trading are short.. keep that in mind as you load up
timber.....for no reason.....
I'm selling
Congratulations to everyone. I also think Olin (OLN) will benefit. They are a supplier of bleach to CLX and industry in general. Unlike CLX they are close to a 52 week low (but were up $2 today alone)
"watch TomV too, he is a shortie"
Why down?
Credit Swiss 177.00 target Neutral in stock That’s like saying sell it over priced!
Where is Kumar now!!!!???!!!!
"With the new view that surfaces aren't that covid critical, surprised CLX didn't take a bigger hit than 1.98%."
now you're talking
"Cramer pumps and you idiots buy. He sells at open. Come on, wake up."
CLX is up 4.95% to 176.07
down again garbage...
it's about time
"Only fools will fall into this shorts' trap.....This has been the worst of the kind market... People are pouring money into worthless small cap (and some large cap as well) companies... Everyone wants quick money and hedge funds/shorties are taking advantage of this. To buy those, people are selling these solid (not so solid now :)) companies...."
Excellent buying opportunity here for a quick pop next week.
This is going to fall to 100
"I* think Clorox could go to new heights if they would issue a two or three for one stock split. At 138 divided by three, it would be a hot price at just below 50$ a share. Lets go Clorox, how about a stock split, it was 1999 when you last split the stock. People would rather pay 50 that 138 a share."
Big earnings beat with only one month of coronavirus panic. Next quarter the revenue will be even higher.Most impressive part was the big increases in profit margins. Horrible day for the market. Money will come to clorox by the end of the day.220 by the end of May.
Getting some support here . Next week let see what she does looking for 124. Then a move back to 130 going into earnings thats my call.
is this still a solid but at the price its at? I personally think so and will most likely see what its looking like at open on Monday..
So today is what straight day of red. It was so red past days that I can not even count.
Best company to own in this kind of environment. I'm buying on dips. I don't care about the upgrades and downgrades on wallstreet
clx and Dupont dd will most likely benefit for the Coronavirus
CLX is down -5.51% to 132.60
quick question when's the next divined for this stock
Will test $150 today
"I looks like CLX -- like other safe haven types of stocks -- is being sold to meet margin calls caused by loses in other investments. I own CLX and I'm not worried one bit. Remember CLX pays a huge dividend, and in a world of interest rates approaching zero, that alone will be attractive, it addition to the obvious reasons Clorox should be in even greater demand going forward."
Lol. This. Down 6% considering the circumstances. Ha. May snap up some more.
"Well I'm not going to mourn a potential vaccine that could eventually save millions from a horrible death, but to anyone feeling bad this morning, remember to look at a long term graph, and see that CLX approximately doubled from 2014 to 2018 before COVID-19 happened, and in ""normal world"" that's a great investment."
"if you want this to go up, you need to find some buyers. I contacted Investment Relations and let them know how unhappy we shareholders are in this fiasco. These kind of stocks shouldn't crash like this has. We need REDDIT army. Someone tell them that with alot of buy volume this can surge."
Should I sell CLX and buy KHC ?
How is everyone feeling before ER tomorrow?I have been waiting with excitement the whole weekend after a nice close on friday.Really think this is going to be good!!
"this is sickening. a stock with great earnings, great outlook, 19 PE and getting creamed"
simplywall.st covered tomi. sees tomz 80% under fair value. sees clx and steris as similar companies.
Could see a special dividend...
LET US COVER LET US CVER STAY LOW STAY LOW STAY LOW STAY LOW SO WE AN COVER PLEASE

Pure disinfectant infused face mask coming. Check out pure bioscience symbol PUREThey are non toxic non fume .will kill the coronavirus for 24 hoursMajor development happening
whats wrong with this garbage . why it keeps trending lower every day
Why down today
SURPRISED THIS STOCK IS NOT SOARING. China Virus means everything will need to be disinfected. CLX is very much needed.
A poorly ran company. Slow production opens the door widely for competitors. Significantly lowered barrier of entry.
"Dear Wall Street,Thank you for the gift. I am going to load up over the next year. Please keep up the volatility. TIA.To the longs, I don't think the drop was warranted. Sure, 6% in one day may look distressing to the weak kneed but it was based on no apparent action. I think it should be retesting the highs as the news was all POSITIVE at the cc. I will be accumulating. I'll take the divvy as it really shames the savings rates at the banks."
"Jorge - I spent 35 years working in this industry, and you have no idea what you're talking about. This stock is broke big time"
"I want to buy some, but this is expensive. IMO, virus gone this should be 150?"
Who's feeling a little scorched today?
"Just a noob question: why does the 1y price target shows a lower price than now, but the short-med-long term perfomances outlooks say it is going to go higher?"
Back to 130 earnings should be good
"Mark, don't worry, you posted that CLX would be 220 by the end of February!"
Good Luck To All...
This is getting annihilated
"clx -1.06%, cost -.96%, pep -1.91%, and wmt -1.04 all consumer staples. Does anyone care to predict were this stock will the rest of the day and the next day? The TNX or yieĺd on the 10 year TB. As long as it stays below 1.16 the yield on CLX compare to buying here this cach cow."
"PE very low, this company is way underpriced"
Same thing same criminals
"Time to buy this stock again.Hilarious that clorox is over 20% below it's all time high while a company like Jet Blue airlines is less than 20% from it's all time high while, just like all the airlines, they have +120% the debt they had 10 months ago and their revenue is less than 35% what it used to be and they lose millions of dollars every day and have to take new debt constantly to cover those losses lol.Meanwhile clorox have their debt totally under control due to 10 months of huge sales, their profit margin has increased due to the demand (in production and supply chain, more demand means more profit margin since you never stop working).Clorox profit margin has passed 20%, which is unreal for a company that bleach products and the like.And the company is at its healthiest state in its history.I sold this when it passed 230. I just bought again when it went below 200."
"Oh Baby,,,I Love the News="
still seeing 10 million CLX shares short ..squeeeze candidate
Just wish I bought more. Price target: who knows.
THIS NEEDS TO CLOSE GREEN TO SEND A MESSAGE TO SHORTS - KEEP BUYING - TELL EVERYONE TO BUY AND PUSH THIS BACK TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT 200
Going down in flames.....Ouchies.....
"At least the CEO was honest and was blunt about future earnings, she kept stressing ""Looooooonngg teerm"" LOL."
OH - Hi Hikarui - I'm biggest bagholder. Losing a fortune in this garbage.
"A little healthy pullback after a week of heavy buying. Gotta love how its a bit down while the almost the entire market is inflated by pretty much two non news. Trump saying we will open soon, something he has been saying since March and Gildead announcing a drug has good results even though the test subjects were cherry picked and still some people died. Market reacted like if we had found a cure and starting today no more covid19 lol.Meanwhile Fauci and the entire scientific community not guaranteeing safety by the November election.Facebook cancelling all events until 2021, FIFA already admitting soccer is done for the yr.The demand for clorox wont cease for 18 months."
Don't understand why Clorox keeps going down??? They can't keep it on the shelves???? Any ideas?
"looking at same games again today. Market up, CLX down. Be a miracle if it can go green and stay green"
down over 10% since earnings.
@Mark I will suggest you sell all your positions as soon as it hits 205
OMG @Mark. No one wants to listen to your whining. Why don't you grow a pair you #$%$ baby.
MAKES NO SENSE
I bought 100 shares yesterday about 196. I feel this will have a good run and the product line fits the conditions.Looking at peers in this sector CLX is one of the top performers.
The lower CLX goes the more appealing it becomes for a buy out.
This company gets more free advertising than Apple.
"Shorts, hedge fund are group of sick people, should go to jail"
this is unreal. I give up
MANAGEMENT NEEDS TO DEFEND THIS #$%$ PRICE DROP. STOCK BUYBACK OR SOMETHING
Why does this stock keep going down? Maybe I will by a little some day when it stabilizes.
I just bought tons of clx . I am losing lots of money ..can it recover to 200?
Hold on enjoy the run
Omg I am fed up of hearing about this... more people die from the regular flu each year. All of a sudden the world is going to end with this coronavirus.
"Any ideas who had to sell today? Extremely odd action for such a well positioned company, especially in this environment."
"Sure, clx great stock. But no longer on steroids now that Covid-19 hysteria is fading away post election."
CLX is up 4.95% to 167.31
Indexes are very red and CLX is green. Not by much but still very cool. That's happened so often since March!
This stock should clearly be 200. This 180 is nuts to low
Shorts getting burned.
"185, called it 2 weeks ago. learn how to read a chart. up we go from here. 205 by end of feb"
"Nice move, 11:30 with good volume -.7%. go, go CLX"
Cramer sold out when this stock hit $175.He wants me to subscribe to his newletter!
HAHHAHAHHAA
just opened a HUGE SHORT position on this TURD. easy money
202 coming soon
"Adding more, definitely way oversold now. Easy trade into the weekend"
Clorox reached an all time high at 235.37
close the week @235. The sky is the limit for CLX. Great company with great products and the right situation for the launch. I see 300 not that far away.
is it a good point to enter to Clorox stock?
Go CLX !!! worldwide use can only increase. With or without vaccine.
As soon as my funds clear I'm buying in such a good dip
CLX often build up momentum later in the day. Holding on.
Look for extra dividend.
Be patient the week before ER.
Pre-market on Nasdaq at $244-$245
"In the short term, this is oversold. I bought today near bottom. Should be a bounce tomorrow ahead of holiday."
"Just the FANG stock make up about 20% oF the sp500 weight. I don't think with all the turmoil with amazon and Fb we can sustain a long term rally right now. Well will retest the 200 DMA and along with that I think CX will pull back about 10% tops. I'd be a buyer under $125 and hold For the long term, its a great company , just tough markets"
The Chosen One has a new treatment for Corona virus. Inject Clorox into the veins until one gets well. CLX should jump to $500 if all tramp rabid supporters will inject Clorox.
I have filed a class action suit
It's days like these Up $7. plus you are happy to own a stock. Ya I know it will drop tommorrw still a fun day. Long for life.

Clx will be strong for a while. Germs  yuck
"Mark - stop asking for help from Reddit or anyone else. Do you own a quality company? If yes, be patient, the market will reward you. Short term trading is psychology and gambling."
"It feels that it is going down to the average analyst target of $175. Insider selling is suspicious.Look what happens with the airlines now - insiders are scooping up the stock at the market. Up, up and up!Why are the clorox guys are selling??? Plus all the banks are downgrading. The only one touting the stock is zacks - a notorious pumper'n'dumper."
money machine
This stock is PRECISELY where I thought it would be right now when I bought it back in March. Ka-Ching! I also predict that by mid August after earnings it will be north of 240. I'm feelin' like the Wolf of Wall Street here. Money is made by waiting.
"For the ones who like the stock back up the truck going to $190 soon: Recent article.....The company recently said its fiscal 2021 organic sales are expected to rise in the range of 10% to 13%, compared to its previous guidance of 5% to 9% increase. The company, however, expects back-half sales to be about flat amid weaknesses in comparable sales. For the full year, EPS is expected to come in between $8.05 and $8.25 versus the previous guidance of $7.70 to $7.95 and the Wall Street’s estimate of $8.12."
Scary this is retreating.

As other have said this is a buy and hold. 3% of my holding
I LOVE THIS STOCK
$157 coming again.
xdate 24th you missed your chance.
STAY DOWN SO WE SHORTS CAN COVER
“Beat” the low estimate as expected. Sales and EPS are down YoY and that’s what matters. Smart money cares about growth...CLX will not GROW the year after pandemic. Naive optimism will kill your portfolio
Always buy CLX under $200
Bob Presley - CLOROX has turned into a royal TURD stock Anyone thinking it will move higher is #$%$ dreaming. I;m so #$%$ I cant see straight. This stock is a #$%$
CLX is up 4.97% to 166.58
Haha every day a new low
"So presumed president elect Biden promises a ""Dark Winter"" and the news sources say the best case for this Pfizer vaccine is wide distribution this Spring. Will most people be vaccinated by the end of Summer? Will all the new cleaning rules requiring the use of bleach just go away? When do bureaucrats end safety rules once they are in place? Who thinks pre Covid-19 ""normal"" will return tomorrow, or next year? I think the selling today was a bit overdone, probably due to abrupt, and likely wise, reallocation to ""recovery"" stocks by hedge funds and others. My greater fear for CLX, being a dependable dividend stock, is that interest rates might abruptly rise in an unforeseen way making dividend stocks less attractive as the ""risk free"" rate of return goes back up."
CLX is down 4.98% to $145.21
So now people will stop buying disinfectants because they are going back to work? I think that results in even more demand for CLX products! Have to clean-up and keep clean all the work places!
everyone saying it will come back. NO IT #$%$ WONT. this is garbage
CLX is 90% institutionally owned not sure why this has not squeezed yet
"Desinfection is not over: aeroplanes, amusement parks, schools, they will all consume CLX products as the economy reopens. I am holding, and adding up under 200 if possible."
CLX is down 5.36% to 160.32
if ER beat expectations why down in premarket???
"Bought 100 more shares @199,99. GO CLX clean this putrid world!"
Rocket-Elton JOHN
kept over the weekend one of the few places to be safe
Going up
"Build a better mousetrap during a plague of mice, and the world will...SELL!  But I own CLX and I'm not worried. Not when CLX pays a dividend that is about 3X the 10 Year Treasury yield, and these earnings mean the dividends will continue indefinitely."
this stock is finished folks. this is one of the biggest piles of #$%$ out there
those shorting this stock are going to get hurt real bad
Bob Presley - I own at 205 and am down $17K and am #$%$ This stock has become a joke as it now approaches an 11 month low. I've filed a lawsuit and contacted SEC over the shorting and how mgmt is not doing anything about it. I suggest others follow suit
"Buy now, this virus is just starting to kick in, i just went to get Clorox wipes, and was lucky to get, selling like crazy as is bleach. This was at Home Depot, cashier said never seen anything like it."
"I’m miffed this stock isn’t a small but steady climb. Food, clothing, shelter and cleaning supplies! They sell the kind of stuff every person walks out of the store with 1 of their products"
Clorox is up 4.97% to 166.58
all major consumer packaged goods stocks up today except this rat #$%$ pile of #$%$
looking like this #$%$ will close red
a buying opportunity
"So, the Russians say they have a vaccine and CLX sells off. Since March, whenever there is good news on the virus front, CLX sells off. I've seen this over and over."
sell on the news.
An early dividend boost to 96 cents (14% increase) love CLX.
"Heads up: The dollar index DX-Y.NYB has been going down since April and is getting to the lowest point since it bottomed out and headed up in early 2018. Right about this time, there was a significant sell off of the Dow. The reason this is important to we CLX holders is that CLX is such a great dividend stock that it can be thought of as a bond substitute when interest rates are very low, like they've been since the Covid-19 pandemic started. But when the dollar went way down in early 2018, Treasury bond yields took off because, I assume, Treasuries sold off in response to the declining dollar. If that happens again, the gap between the risk free rate of return (Treasuries) and the return on dividend paying stocks gets narrower, potentially making dividend stocks less attractive for those seeking mainly income. In other words, there's a chance that CLX might have some turbulence ahead which has nothing directly to do with CLX. I will be watching the dollar, Treasuries, and what our Fed and government may try to do, if anything to halt the slide of the dollar. Merry Christmas, and I'm glad I wrote that if only for myself to look back in a while. This is not financial advice."
"BE GREEDY WHEN OTHERS ARE FEARFULjust picked up some at $188.35, thanks for the shares on the cheap"
"Wow. This thing is moving. Up close to 40% in three weeks. It is a bleach, ammo (Winchester)and chemicals play. Thank you for shout out"
What's happening with CLX today ?!
"Mike - stop smoking that whacky weed, you are stoned as a bone and have no clue as to what you're talking about. this #$%$ is dead"
dont let the shorts keep taking this down. tell everyone you know and work the boards to get volume into this stock. It needs big volume to go up
Your not going to see much of a pullback on this one. Best to buy now and hold for a bit. We all know what's comming.
CLX has put up one bad quarter after another for the past year (you can read my posts after each quarter). But the stock has not been penalized as management keeps spinning the bad results and/or putting out totally unrealistic guidance. Now they had to take back that unrealistic guidance but maybe they hit some target which now allows them to get fatter bonuses or maybe they sold lots of their own stock. I don't know if this is the case but it wouldn't surprise me one but. What is the incentive to lie to shareholders if you know you cannot meet the targets in the long run? So for those asking why the stock went down so much of a slight miss? It is because the stock was and is massive over valued. It is a no growth stock trading more expensive than some high growth internet names.
"Only three things are down today. Gold, 10 years bond, and CLX. Still, there is time to sell and run away. It is going to fall to 120$ if not 100$"
About to get my cheeks clapped.
bought on Friday dip... not worried about smaller competition cuz they can’t compete with manufacturing their products leaving them ultimately to sell to companies like CLX while doing the grunt work of R&D and marketing
"If the market keeps going up, it will go up with the market. If the market goes down over another pandemic scare, it will go up with that."
"Morgan Stanley Maintains Underweight on Clorox, Lowers Price Target to $170."
markets will open up a bit then crash around 1030 to11. we will close down another 300 or so on the dow. clx will be 124 or less
This should be up $20
Just keeps sawing wood. Nice and boring.
Love me some downgrades
What down 3.23 % thats crazy. Alot of these products are purchased every week staple items. I will be buying more solid company.

"WAIT FOR MORE PULLBACK, THEN BUY THE MARCH 20th $160-$165 CALLS CHEAPER. Buy low, sell higher "
Gonna buy at $178
Champagne:$200.00 and going higher. probably $215.00 or so.
Why did Zacks several weeks ago advised Sell. Glad I didn't take their advise. Woooow
"Virus cases flattening out, Gilead drug doing wonders for patients, virus mutations could mutate to non issue.Time to take profits on clx"
CLX is a well run company with a product that everyone needs. BUY
same price as almost 1 year ago... way oversold if valuations dont matter in the market
CLX reached a new 52 Week Low at 117.66
Ready for a new low
To the moon Alice 
will need a miracle in order for this to go back up even a couple dollars. this is total #$%$
I think I'll wait for the post earnings drop to rebuy...probably Monday or so.
"Saw Clorox Bleach on the shelf at my local Safeway! Just a few bottles, but this means Clorox is starting to fill its retail supply chain again."
WHY IS THIS DOWN?
What price do we see today? $196? $198? $200?
CARL ICON tried to take CLX over For $92.00 per share some years ago. Even then the the background chatter was there way before Carl's epic siege failed.
"Up, down, up, down, up, down. I'm getting dizzy"
No reason for this to drop from 220+ to 185 when the Market is up all the time... Sanitizing will stay forever.... Handiwork of the #$%$ shorties...
"$CLX is here to stay whether you like it or not. Correction in stock is normal, then it is going back to the upward trend."
Who ever would have ever thought Clorox would be the savior of regular Joe's portfolios and Western Civilization and the hottest most important topic on the interweb in 2020. Going all in.
"haha, one more hit. JNJ vaccines received authorization"
"Looks like Wallstreet is finally getting closer to understanding what people really need during this crisis... wow, that was slow....."
shorts are going to get their assxes handed to them
tomorrow will either be 205 or 185
Anyone have a clue what’s going on? Berkshire candidate perhaps?
"No gains in one week now, why?"
"What if GameStop guys show and buying clx shares, epic sequeeze coming. I will bring them here"
"We all have to remember this stock is a covid play currently, which is causing it to sell off. And before covid it was in the 130s with just a bit less revenue. IMO it’s not worth the 200 estimate"
"Buy under $100.The stock is yielding 3% as of today, same as US10Y, it's not worth the daily fluctuation that easily wipes out your dividend gain.Much more downside risk coming."
Yesterday's pullback was healthy. CLX can move higher.
Why Clorox down so much??
So technically they beat but with the adjustment they had a 49 cent loss?
"I am shorting this stock. At the beginning of this year the company was trading around $150. It spiked due to the virus panic, but now that things are getting back to normal it will likely return to it former value."
A nice surprise stock this year. Long
We're going to need more bleach!
hold clx. it will be 200 April
What an absolutely downright beautiful stock 
CLX best defensive trade on the street...period ..2.50 divy as well with zero rates
lost everything on this monster piece of #$%$
green on a red day..191...what what
Now that we know the covid vaccine is easy: just inject Clorox into ur lungs...and all good to go! I just bought 1000 shares due to trump's genius. He really is amazing....I'm hearing incredible things about him.
"JPMorgan analyst Andrea Teixeira downgraded Clorox to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $235, down from $255. $235 is the new TARGET and sales and revenues will continue to exceed expectations."
I just got in with Clorox!! I just bought on the dip at 191.05 cost basis buying 8 shares.
