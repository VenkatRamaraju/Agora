My estimate of $95-$96 up to earnings is looking very likely! As long as it sustains $94 today it should be easily hit my estimate.

Any thoughts why it dropped? It crushed earnings and rev
This stock will roll to $200 easily. Get ready for huuuge earnings next 12 months
They playing with the stock they’re selling it today then when it’s low enough they’ll buy it and make money and this will go on and on and on.
With this quarter shallaking of earnings it's pretty much a guarantee to hit 270/280 range in a month or 2. Anyone that's owned MSFT for a while knows we got the best CEO in the business!!
"just checking what the sentiments are, do you see this hitting below 205 again by next week? wondering if I should sell ... hasn't really picked up as expected after earnings call"
there are no words to describe how good it feels when you make your weekly paycheck * 2 in 2 hours
stay with the stalwart juggernaut...unlimited potential
Normal dip.. next stop 250 !
"From what I read for the last 2 years ""analysts keep wondering how far MSFT can go up"" and they always get it wrong. The reason is, they want you to feel insecure and to sell your shares so they can buy and the big guns they work for.Just ask IT guys what's going on and if you don't know any, let me tell you. Last year, we moved 27 companies to Azure and Office 365. This year, we expect to migrate between 60 and 80. And we are a small IT company. Now, ask the big guys. Thousands of businesses migrate to Azure. Yes, Azure and not AWS. Forget Google or IBM. We had 0 requests to move customers to AWS. More subscribers means steady and guaranteed income for MS."
bought 100 shares today. looks like is uptrending. will reach 160 before the end of the year .

Robert- You're incorrect. The only thing AMZN did was keep MSFT from going up 3 more points tomorrow. The upgrades and increase price targets are still coming

Sincere question (I really don’t know the answer). How difficult is it to manipulate the yield on the 10 year?
Is MSFT Earnings going to beat ?? Look at baba they beat but missed

"Microsoft moving into health care in a big way. Yesterday, Walgreens. Today, a small invesment in Invinnoccer. This is clearly one area that the company has targeted."
Highest price target on MSFT is $115. Everyone relax. It doesn’t have to hit that today or next week. Be patient.
Healthiest tech company out there for the next 10-20 years to come.

MSFT is performing well for how bad the markets currently are.
265 in the after hours today
The only way to play MSFT is long.
Tik Tok won't be sold just like huawei won't be sold. it's all politics now. TikTok will be ban in US and Pompeo will be going around the world to rally others to ban tiktok. Chinese government won't back down once government get involved.
What is wrong at MSFT?
"Regardless of tomorrow results positive and negative, I wont be selling any stock its one of the best out there and I believe will have another good year if for some reason goes down alot will addseems wierd went down so much today."

Don't focus on your earnings due to small fluctuations folks. Think long term. Shorts always earn less with $MSFT.
"Good action however, we cannot ignore that volume is low so this gain may be short lived...HOLD"
Blowout day!!! All the stars are aligned.

Looking at Implied volatility this is quite normal before a big gain.
$215 pin on Fri coming.
Technical breakdown occurring. Ominous sign
"I am new this trading scene so I am busy studying charts and financials and projections. My first stock was MSFT a few weeks ago at 161. 7 days later it was at 173 and starting to drop!!!!! I panicked and quickly sold at 170ish. I was feeling pretty good about myself earning $9.00 a share in a week. This is easy, right? I rolled my money over into 2 other stocks, one of which jumped 4 per share and the other dropped 10% in value. Meanwhile, MSFT continued to go UP! I am now into BMY and back into MFST at 184. I noticed that every single stock chart out there looks like a landscape of mountains and valleys. I have no doubt that MSFT will go back up. I understand people selling to make a profit. That's why we are here. But, isn't it better to sell when the stock is at it's peak? Also, keep in mind when someone is selling their shares, it also means someone else is BUYING!!I'm buying more tomorrow!!!!"
Can we hit 107.50 today?
"As I have said many times, this is the one stock I will not sell....steady Eddie!"

Been in MSFT a long time. One of the best days I can remember in a long time. We’ve only just begun as the Carpenters were apt to sing.
"Nasdaq: VERB) (""VERB"" or the ""Company""), a rapidly emerging market leader in business-focused interactive video sales and marketing tools, including livestream ecommerce, CRM, and content management applications, today announced that in preparation for the global release of its much anticipated Microsoft Outlook integration, it will offer small businesses across the country impacted by COVID-19, free use through a specially designed beta program."

"What a JOKE! $MSFT Revenues and Earnings are TANKING, but the stock price is up because the company ""beats"" extremely diminished expectation!Another TULIP MANIA BUBBLE! Enjoy BOGUS Earnings!"
Yessir
I don't see any good explainable reason for why stock price has dropped so much today. Wall St is insane!
Bought more MSFT!
Haven’t given guidance yet. That will move the stock up or down. Will be coming shortly
$130s after earnings. Microsoft is sitting on the mother lode of business transformation. This giant wave will go on for the next 6 years. Hang on to this one. :-)
Money is simply rotating out of tech... it will come back calm down. Meanwhile invest in some other beaten down sectors.Im gonna guess that this stock will only go a low as maybe 195-200 thats it.
Buy buy buy buy buy buy this Friday it will touch 200$
"Msft just moved up nearly 10% over 7 monthsWith a krazy demand for cloud computing -> we could expect a nice earningMsft still has room to run, methinks"

"Thumbs up, after market up over 4%"
Just goes to show what a joke yesterday's trading was and in after hours
Like I said yesterday: “Happy that I picked the right horse!” 
A little pop at the end of the day or tomorrows open and MSFT is at a new buy point.Then sit back and watch the fireworks!
Does anyone think that msft will have earnings that won’t exceed expectations?
msft on the move because of morgan stanley up grade t o $140!!!
MSFT will reach $ 188 by the close tomorrow! I love this company!
So undervalued
"The second company after Apple to hit 1 Trillion mark is Microsoft, not Amazon!"
"Matt makes a very good point. I think Microsoft could go in-house on chips. More importantly, I think Apple should use some of their cash and the low rates rot get start investing in foundry in the US. They could event sub it out or let TSM run it. They would have first dibs on chips and be a contract maker for others. Let’s pull some dependence from the China region."
"Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:05 PM ET on Thursday, July 19, 2018. The consensus earnings estimate is $1.07 per share on revenue of $29.17 billion and the Earnings Whisper  number is $1.12 per share. Investor sentiment going into the company's earnings release has 86% expecting an earnings beat. Consensus estimates are for year-over-year earnings growth of 9.18% with revenue increasing by 25.10%. Short interest has increased by 1.8% since the company's last earnings release while the stock has drifted higher by 8.0% from its open following the earnings release to be 16.2% above its 200 day moving average of $90.69. Overall earnings estimates have been revised higher since the company's last earnings release. On Friday, July 13, 2018 there was some notable buying of 13,761 contracts of the $105.00 call expiring on Friday, August 17, 2018. Option traders are pricing in a 3.6% move on earnings and the stock has averaged a 2.0% move in recent quarters."
If microsoft buys tiktok (easily the most likely suitor) then this stock would go up $10+ I'm not moving my position at all
"I got in with an avg price in the mid-30s. my initial investment was modest, only around 6 or 7k. that has now increased to around 35k...plus dividends. I only hold a little over 150 shares. Advice? Cash out and look elsewhere for growth, putting the winfall to use? Continue to let it ride, knowing the greatest gains are behind me. At this point the dividend is only worth a few hundred dollars a year to me due to the small share count. I feel like the money would be better served generating a larger payout elsewhere. Thoughts?"
 Happy Holidays! 
2021 is going to be different from 2020 look msft has an upward curve at the end of the day....It has always been downward
O'Leary says the Government needs to stop spending money - he has enough.

I think this will best all the expectations and will surge crazy next week might reach 240 by end of next week
Bought at 104
"Experts, can someone help? I am new to options and I have purchased three call contracts Oct 19, strike price 110. Do you think this will cross 110 in next few months?"
Surprised nobody here mentioned the fact that MSFT is announcing a buy out of Bethesda. They will have exclusive console rights to the DOOM Elder Scrolls and Fallout IPs among many others.
At this rate we'll be over the $100 before earnings date.. Happy days... We'll take a breather after it hits $150! Go MSFT.
BEEN A SHAREHOLDER SINCE 1998 in a monthly Drip program. They are going to blow it out of the park on this earnings report.
My portfolio is up 50% in the last 12 months. This rally has to end soon. Nothing is sacrosanct.
Very likely big tech bottomed....perfectly normal healthy market
I feel if apple has a good report today this stock will go back to 109 tomorrow after hours and be going for a high 110 close on friday
Msft has many many revenue streams yet the stock just can’t move up like other companies. Somethings wrong somewhere.
Pretty clear $amzn likely bottom as well as $fb but $googl $msft $aapl are heavy as f. Google has a 1950 gap to fill
Zero reason to chase this stuff here the market could take weeks to digest the recent breakdowns $aapl $msft $amzn it doesnt mean the market will crash but a churning where all u call buyers lose your #$%$ $spy
some people say this stock never moves. I disagree.
"Stay safe with the shares, even if it drops to 211 today that’s still so much better than last week! MSFT will easily go back up to 220 by Friday! Also a bunch of shorts posting fake comments don’t listen to them and panic!"
Sold virtually all of my Baba shares at the end of trading today and bought MSFT. Tired of the volatility so glad I did!

"Azure appears to be doing extremely well in the market. Wheres Azure was up 73% YoY, AWS was up ""only"" 41% YoY, although AWS is still much larger than Azure."
MSFT's cloud win over AMZN guaranteed by Pentagon..should rise astronomically now
$100 coming!
They should go back to splitting every time it reaches 100. 1 share is now 288. That’s how wealth is created.
long on msft. i bought more shares in the dip and will buy more tomorrow premarket if it is red. Analysts brought the price down 3 times yesterday and the price went way up later.
6mo chart. Higher lows!!
Wedbush: MSFT will likely beat expectations on Azure cloud growth. Stay tuned.
I believe Mr. Softy is starting to run into earning for the next two weeks. may see 215 before earning.
bill gates doesn't know how to basic math. He would pay only 6b in taxes ... not 60b. Duh!

Approaching oversold. Hang tight till the storm is over
Great tile to buy MSFt on the dip - cash heavy and will continue to grow!
"Possible bam Saturday, not definite. I hope msft buys tiktok. It would be a brand new revenue stream . Also it would get them more involved in social media and create more ad revenue. Would be a great buy. And I'd keep buying more shares eveytime it sells. Especially near the 200$ level. I bought more today when it hit $200. I don't think it sells below that number , too much support. And for good reason too. They soany good things going for the company. GL all"
230 before earnings?
People MSFT is a save haven for your money. I will never sell a single share for I know that the sky is the limit for MSFTs PPS! I loaded up on cheap calls for this baby will be over 120 by end of this Month! Never bet against American tech!
It will be interesting to see the analyst upgrades and new earnings estimates.
"Preparing to load up more Msft. The lower it goes, the more I buy."
Anybody see an XBox in store yet ... exactly!!!
MSFT is perfectly poised for a breakout year. Been a very long time holder of this one. This is the defecto buy and hold. It’s position in the Cloud is strengthening and as Edge Computing begins to take a more dominant position a leader in that too. It is as good as it gets for MSFT for the foreseeable future. Just tune out all the noise and watch this stock grow. About as much a no-brainer as there is. IMHO.
MSFT hits a new all-time high today at $102.25!
Undoubtedly one of the best value stock/company to keep
Like I said we have a all time high today.. Thank you...

"Guys, microsoft increased 5.7% at european markets today, I expect to finish 218-220 range today"
Wow! MSFT almost 10% below fair value now. This sell off is really beginning to create some great bargains on the best stocks to own.
"Blackberry, already up 20% this year is once again on a tear today as it signed a new deal with Baidu with a statement of intent by the Chinese company to use QNX in its autonomous driving cars. BB is at 12.70 today but it will be 200 in the next 2-3 years as it leads the way into the next big tech revolution."
It will go higher and it will split ! Just watch !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I hope and pray that MSFT acquires all of TikTok just so they can become the biggest thorn in Zuckerbergs side he’s ever known!!!
once Johnson & Johnson gets its one dose vaccine approved on Friday everyone will sell Microsoft and buy Airlines stock excetera
GME now up 200 pre market. A short while ago it was up 55.
Don’t be shocked if any morning you wake up to the news that Microsoft has closed the deal with TikTok. The deadline is Sept 15 but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen much earlier. Shorts should proceed with caution
Long and strong always with MSFT: nothings else needs be said
msft heading to 250 says Buffet.

MSFT long term chart is going parabolic... super fun
"Not only new solid ad revenue source now, but also more brand recognition for Xbox and personal computing."
"Solid earnings and revenue growth. Thanks Satya, keep up the good work."
Split?
I think that declaring a dividend increase or increasing their stock buyback program during the earnings call would do wonders for the stock. I prefer that the buyback program is increased. A third or half increase would make this stock a huge buy. Interest rates are so low that it would be incompetent not to do so.
MSFT is a solid stock that will only go up in the long run. Buy now!
sell everything and buy ms
MSFT price target 250 dollars

keep buying more stock
Right at 50 day moving average....Buy it up!!!!!
I don't like their window ... updating all the times?
all aboard back over the 50day avg. 220 short term
Back to 109 by friday
Strong Buy! Set to sky rocket!
you can't keep MSFT down... it'll always bounce back..... Azure will fuel the fire for the next two years minimally
"Microsoft forecasts AR/VR market size: $6.1 billion in 2020, $34.3 billion in 2025."
I was happy yesterday I'm happy today just not as wealthy
This stock is grossly undervalued. Teams is far superior to ZM. Their full ecosystem is the reason why all of us are even functional at work. This has only 1 way to go. UP.
Always keeps going down in aftermarket........
Microsoft dominates the cloud in enterprise subscriptions. Amazon dominates the cloud in Gov't and Silicon Valley business. Both have huge moats and room to grow.
"So, MSFT gets hacked, and yet nobody is pointing out the RECENT collaboration between MSFT, Gates, and Gavin Newsom to track all students coming and going using QR codes on a DAILY basis in the LA USD. Look it up..."
"January 24, 20191:30 pm ET Microsoft Buys Citus Data Dow Jones"
"Looks like down 875 and 500 for the dow and Nasdaq unless there is a miracle out there. Oh, there is, but he's at the Mar-a- Lago Club."
"Just a reminder as I wouldn't be surprised if this occurs prior to the Capital Markets day scheduled for March 18th. $MSFT & $INTC aren't stupid and the muted stock price following the WSB garbage, positive earnings, and downplayed CEO comments indicate that this deal could be in the final stages. (New CEO & CFO to transition as well) MSFT trades at 12X annual revenue which the additional $27B from Nokia would translate to $324B. Even if this dropped MSFT to 10X annual revenue, that's a $270B valuation so buying Nokia for $50B to $70B makes a lot of sense."
"Follow the Trend Microsoft Corporation lies in the middle of a strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 11.16% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $116.12 and $127.04 at the end of this period."
30% revenue growth and 30% return in capital. Awesome I’m long
"I think Chinese hack is taking a toll on MSFT. After Solar Winds, nasty China hits us with a cyber attack through Softie's email exchange. We need to start doing really bad things to the Chinese."
Will this go up to 215 by earnings?
$20 jump on earnings day
"It's time to buy now and will hit $125.00 in the next 3,4 month!"
Time for 200 today. It is inevitable!
MSFT is in beast mode. The $200 magnet is now officially turned on.
Something's definitely brewing...Good news!!
Long and strong. Be patient and you’ll see why this is going to 150 soon.
Relax and buy more. MSFT is taking a breather today but my other tech stocks are doing great. I hope you guys have other positions than MSFT.

"to all short sellers... your negativity will not work and will not stir the fear... MSFT is a solid company, nearly running a monopoly is the software productivity domain, rich in cash, and above all rapidly growing cloud business that is set to grow even during a recession"
"First close above 140....I had predicted 141 to close on Monday, so I was wrong....it will march to 150 over the next few months as various macro factors come into play, but where it goes after that is impossible to know...."
"Healthy action today, nice bounce off the previous dip. Pattern repeating - up, consolidation, up, consolidation, etc... Been like this for last 4 1/2 years with exception to market crazy action from October 1, 2018 to end of December. Still looking for $130 in July and $165 by EOY (these last three months have been a rocket ride, can't expect this to continue). Back to the good old days - go longs!"
200 coming soon
$150 by next year. Take a screenshot.
"News hasn’t hit yet but Xbox live in down and the gaming community of Microsoft is outraged. They still have no idea why, more software issues? More hacking? This might not be good for Microsoft. Just a thought"
Any guess how high it'll go up tomorrow?
so much for a price pop on good earnings.
No reason for fall. Just a correction
Should get in with $SRMX as well. Partnering with Microsoft and super affordable right now!
Microsoft will be over $200 within a month.....or my name isn’t Bill Gates. :-)
"Another Happy week-end,, thanks to MSFT !!!!"
"nice, my 2 shares I bought at $200 are up. I can finally afford lunch."
I'm buying more into close 
Microsoft won $495 million contract from the Army.
"There is serious paper in the options for this stock. If MSFT announces plans to deploy their $140B warchest to shareholders, it's $100 instantly and I don't care how many 100s of points the DJIA crashes."
microsoft this time last year was $115... and today its at $155... still has a long long way to fall....
Load up on msft at these prices! You'll make $4/share in a week.
Man this is going to fly after earnings. Going to be fun.
Why is MSFT down after a positive earnings result and maintain to buy rating ?
"Let me preface this by saying I’m personally a long on this company. I think that this thing is bound to go down soon, and new buyers should consider before opening a position. This growth is great, but logically, it’s due for a pullback. What happened to apple when it became the first Trillion dollar company? Granted that was during the terrible October of last year, but that’s beside the point. When things reach new tops, pullback is bound to happen"
The whole Nasdaq is down suddenly.. ?
"THANK YOU, SATYA for your innovative brilliance, hardwork and superior management of our beloved MSFT."
"Opinion: Amazon fighting against the JEDI decision will be good for MSFT stock. MSFT will still get contract, and it just makes there be 2 catalysts - the initial news of winning the contract — and the news that amazons repeal didn’t work."
Wow 1T on the dot!
200.....this week!
Covid is over - let's all party in the streets - free money will soon fall from the sky watch and see - heard immunity we are there
This rocket going to vertically high with giant sustained speed
Microsoft is the New England pats always strong team and hoists a lot of hardware.
"Way too orderly to be an actual correction, just another paint job IMO"
Opens tomorrow at $102 per share.Just crushing it!
"$MSFT $GOOG BUBBLE Stocks Cost More, but they DO NOT Worth more."
"If MSFT can do what AAPL did with its earning's report, we should see $200 per share very shortly."
"I think Microsoft is sitting in the sweet spot with respect to retailers (along with Google). Amazon is clearly the leader in web services with AWS, but they have alienated the majority of retailers by competing so strongly with retailers via their marketplace. Given this along with the fact that retailers are such a large fraction of the US economy, I really like Microsoft's chances long-term."
"What everyone needs to realize is the market was at all time highs literally just the other week. There is absolutely no question the market could go a few thousands points lower. Just imagine if even 1 of those 8,400 people in California being watched ends up testing positive. Not to mention the WHO finally calling this a pandemic. I'm not trying to sound negative because I love all of my friends here and this stock, but there really is no reason to be holding this right now. Take your profits out and we all buy back lower at some point."
Gap closed. Onwards and upwards from here.
Bump to 244 as expected. Last chance for profit maximization before this house of cards market gets the hurricane treatment.

Look for 90 by xmas.
"MSFT has solid management. It has a solid PE and the price is also solid. In my opinion, it is a solid buy. If it rises to $140 we may see a solid 2 for 1 split. It has been a long time since MSFT has had a split. I may be just a little bit optimistic, solid baby."
When is earnings
The one and 5 year charts are amazing! Never letting this one go!
MSFT is about $50 overpriced here. Temper your expectations and wait for an entry opportunity.
MSFT getting high every day.
Go MFST Go... Love seeing this... Beat the all time record 
The ER has spoken. Sorted! 
people quick to take profit after hour after a pop. MS is traded as a big discount. it should trade around 265 to 275
"800 billions Godzilla , wow !"
MSFT is exploding soon!
This market is un tradable. Big down followed randomly by big ups. Can’t short and can’t long.
Added another 100 shares. This is going to pop today! Last chance before 190 and then 200 and beyond.
Well done MSFT $140 :)
"Undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD the stocks to own for 2020, do your own home work and win big in 2020...…...……..."

HAPPY WEEK-END ! Thanks MSFT!!
"Man, I LOVE this stock!"
I'm so mad right now. this is not good for the heart.
"Love this stock, been holding at around $170 a share. Want to add more but don't want my avg cost to go up haha. Waiting for some pullbacks/possible overall market correction to buy more."
"I think the cloud war is a win for Microsoft. Who am I going to give control of all my data, a company that wants to sell everything and compete with every company. Or Microsoft that is a Data company with better intentions than world domination. Who do you trust Satya or Bezos?"
Headed for the $2 TRILLION club. Never a doubt.
Would've been better today without Donald's comments weighing on the market
Look out below!
Should be 130 easily by years end. Msft is cleaning up in a lot of areas will generate huge revenue growth for years.
Bought ton of shares at 181.22 using Margin. This is killing me .
Safe haven.
Un muy buen dia! See you at $230!
look this thing is going to 300 maybe not right away but within a few years and we will get a 2 for 1 split along the way just to keep shareholders in.
I bought 50 shares today I needed a little tech in my portfolio
Hang on..MSFT will prevail with JEDI and with the cloud.
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/other/microsoft-wins-pentagons-dollar10-billion-jedi-contract-thwarting-amazon/ar-AAJn3KJ
Here come the big boys buying
"Reminder, MSFT, undervalued AMD still a good buy at these levels. Do the proper DD and win in 2019."
Can't wait to see MFST at 200..
"looks to me like ""investor"" is a good mute candidate. Am I wrong?"
Who would ever bet against Microsoft?
MSFT has been a laggard lately!! How many of you agree? I am thinking to sell some! It is depressing!!
$200 before year end.
Go my 200 shares
MFST is still a good buy.. Better get it while you can
Yesterdays close and the spill over to today indicates some profit taking ahead of earnings.
"I don’t remember $MSFT getting a bump after it won the JEDI contract. I hope that in the last 2 years, Microsoft was able to gain new government contracts in the US and internationally.As far as $AMZN is concerned, in my view, the damage is already done. First, they are competing in too many business segments (such as retail), likely driving away the customers who would be wary of their critical data being accessible by Amazon. And I think that this long litigation has damaged its credibility - people generally tend to stay away from litigious businesses. I see this latest JEDI news as the beginning of the end of AWS, and the start of the journey for Microsoft to become the leading Cloud provider."
"Today’s interesting article from New York Post :- “The Microsoft bid to buy controversial social-media app TikTok is far from over, but already the tech giant is receiving interest from outside investors to join its bidding group, sources tell me.These potential co-investors include General Atlantic Partners and Sequoia Capital, both current investors in TikTok’s Beijing-based parent, ByteDance, sources with knowledge of the matter say. In addition, don’t be surprised if a big private-equity firm jumps into the group. Keep in mind, a lot can happen between now and the time that Microsoft actually makes a bid. It is currently focused on TikTok’s US operations — around 100 million monthly users, mainly Gen-Zers and social-media influencers in this country who use the short-video app to post everything from dance videos to commentary to political satire. But TikTok’s audience is expected to expand; sports franchises are said to be interested in posting.That said, a Microsoft bid is far from a done deal. The company has looked at whether buying just the US portion makes sense since TikTok has 800 million users globally. Moreover, it will have to convince President Trump that the app is secure from Chinese influence.While all this plays out, TikTok’s future in the US is ticking away.“"
"A difficult year 2020, in so many ways. Just blessed have been able to accumulate significant wealth with amzn, $snap and $msft. Excluding shorts, so many are suffering through no fault of their own. I plan on praying for all during this holiday season.#blessed"
Looks like the markets gonna shift momentum today. 3 weeks down it’s time for a Green Day. Futures rebounded already.
"It’s only healthy for a 2-7% pull back, let’s all hope this happens."

"Own MSFT, don't trade it"
"I’ll say it again, MSFT has to many outstanding shares they are bloated and AAPL will soon be bloated too when their stock splits."
Msft is positioning itself for the run up come friday
52w high - here we come
for 2 months this stock seems to end up at 182 or so while its big tech peers set new records. anyone know why this is?
glad msft isn't funding those in politics whose message is division and lack of respect for the rule of law.
"MSFT $245, APPL $150 and FB $300 by mid February. All crushed earnings, just getting held down by red markets."
will there ever be a split 2for1
cloud revenue outlook is higher
BUY NOW A SURE WINNER IN A WEEK OR BEFORE!
"Yawn,are we at $100 + yet ?"
"Be of good cheer fellow Microsoftians. Ya it's down but nowhere near amazon or the Nasdaq, which is losing all of this on fear again. Amazon actually made more profit, but slightly less than projected gross income. it's down hard, and taking others with it. the fact that MSFT is only down 1.5% after hours when amazon is down 8% on solid earnings (reminds me of Walmart in February) says a lot. Listen to the God Emperor. Microsoft will fall when fear is sold, out of sympathy, but I doubt it'll fall harder than the Nasdaq without bad news. Go long. rejoice in upcoming dividends."
china will not allow the deal. It says the deal is tantamount to theft. So back to square one. Trump bans tic tok and MSFT builds their own version of tictok.
191 on the open
"Can someone please explain why on my brokerage acct MSFT shows a PE of 27, but on this, Yahoo is showing 75?"
MSFT is as sure as the sunrise for long-term investors.
maybe might push 160 by the end of the year
"T inflated the market with businesses friendly policies. Now under Joe Blow, and in association with ABC, E-Warren and Colonel S, we have anti business leadership. And rates could shoot up past 2% in a jiffy..... It will be a good buy for $185. Low over head and high profitability."
"Just buy another 7,000 share at $108."
"I think TikTok is a big risk. Not sure how it will play out (politically or financially) for MSFT. However, I do trust Nadella - he's a great CEO and I think he'll figure it out."
"I'm very bullish about the Singapore summit next week, the Dow will surge at least 300 points next Tuesday!"
"Microsoft optimistic about business transformation in Taiwan. HIMX Taiwanese Display semiconductor maker under $10 with huge potential. HIMX as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be February 4, 2021 and projected to report earnings of $0.20 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 1900%."
It looks like the stock is being shorted big time. Cause who would want to sell this before earnings??? They’ll pay a big price for betting against America.
MSFT is approaching a proper buy point at $228.22. (Feel free to google it)We could hit that today or tomorrow. Then the computer buying kicks in taking MSFT to 240.00 before marching to the new targets by JP Morgan and Citi - 260-272.
MSFT is the stalwart and won't disappoint..2020 should be great with its cloud dominance.
MSFT forward..200 on the horizon

"Breaking: Microsoft price target raised to $240 from $200 at JefferiesJefferies analyst Brent Thill raised the firm's price target on Microsoft to $240 from $200 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst believes Microsoft is ""one of the best pillars in software"" with a durable financial #$%$ featuring double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion. Thill expects Microsoft to deliver strong Q4 results amid COVID-19 and a conservative guide per norm. Microsoft has beaten the last four Q4s Street revenue by an average of over 2%, he notes, adding that he expects continued strength."
MFST is still a good buy.. Definitely the stock to own.. 
bought today earnings will fly out the park.
I love what MSFT is doing and is a very undervalued stock but I wish they would increase their dividend.

"Amazon lost the JEDI contract because Microsoft's bid was better. Nothing to do with Trump. Now Amazon knowing what Microsoft's bid was want to bid again. It's game over for Amazon. ""Microsoft won the JEDI contract because the Department of Defense found that we offered “significantly superior” technology at a better price.""""The DoD reviewed our bid against eight distinct evaluation factors and 55 individual sub-factors. The department subjected our products and services to four individual test scenarios, which were composed of more than 78 individual steps. The result? We were rated equal or superior to Amazon in every evaluation factor.""""Amazon would have you believe that it lost the award because of bias at the highest levels of government. But Amazon, alone, is responsible for the pricing it offered. As the government explained in its brief: “AWS and Microsoft each had a fair chance to build pricing for the entire procurement, based on their overall business pricing.” Amazon did build its pricing for the entire procurement, and it wasn’t good enough to win. And now it wants a re-do. That’s not good for our war-fighters. That’s not good for confidence in public procurement. That’s not good for anybody but Amazon.""https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/04/15/dod-amazon-jedi-contract/"
Okay buying even more..
"I'm really pi$$ed off about this. ""Oh MSFT has increased X% since the covid crash, it's running too hot"". Well that really means nothing as it's only about $10 off the pre covid price and it's one of the few companies making more profit in covid. The stick price does not reflect the relative strength of MSFT compared to all the companies built on huge PE ratios that will never deliver like MSFT(Amazon 77 , Tesla 700! ) . What is the real value of MSFT. My take; increase it's share price so the PE ratio is in line with other stocks."

I remember when they came out with Security Essentials, which provided decent anti-malware protection that could finally replace third-parties on personal computers.Well, now they're collecting trillions of data points a day from Windows Defender running on systems across the world. They're analyzing the behavior of users on every platform from Office 365 to Xbox Live. And if you pay them a few bucks/user/month, you get astounding insights into threats and risk, across your entire environment...and that's just in the area of security.Seriously, this company is innovating in every area at incredible rates -- in fact, their rate of development almost seems to be exponentially increasing as time goes by. There are many capable vendors that offer solutions for various technologies out there, but Microsoft is creeping up on most every segment. It's already getting to the point where the benefits of consolidating your technology stack on Microsoft and thereby having an integrated ecosystem outweigh the specific capabilities other vendors may offer in specific aspects. Over time, their solutions will improve, and any shortcomings in comparison to those other vendors will be resolved.So long as Nadella is running things, this is probably the best business in the world."
What is Microsoft Viva? Haven't really understood hehe.
"THE BEST THING ABOUT MSFT IS THAT IT GROWS SLOWLY BUT STEADILY WITHOUT CREATING NOISE LIKE NVDA OR OTHERS. THE MOST UNUSUAL THING HAPPENED LAST YEAR DURING 3 MONTH LONG CRASH. ALMOST ALL STOCKS LOST 20% FROM THEIR TOP VALUE. BUT MSFT LOST ONLY 8 TO 10% BUT TRIED TO RECOVER MULTIPLE TIMES AND NOW, SEE WHAT, IT SURPASSED ITS PREVIOUS MAX 117 AND GOING HIGHER. THIS DROP IS DUE TO RSI STABILIZATION IT WILL MOVE SIDEWAYS FOR FEW DAYS THE AGAIN 2 % UP AND SO ON."
$200 a share seems to be the place msft cant get there fast enough. I am surprised by the demand and enjoying the ride up.
Undervalued stock. Should be near the price of Apple by now. Alot of room to run for MSFT.
wild close
"MSFT Upgrade to $260 as Top Pick: ""Microsoft called 'a top stock for the recovery' at Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss reiterates Microsoft as a Top Pick in Software and calls it a ""top stock for the recovery"" ahead of the company's upcoming Q2 results, which he thinks are likely to highlight the durability of Microsoft's commercial businesses as well as ""conservatism in forward consensus expectations."" Weiss keeps an Overweight rating and $260 price target on Microsoft shares.""Bullish."

"I don't know about you, but this stocks seems like the safest and easiest way to invest. Buy some shares and never look back. I am new to investing (this year) and I confidently say this is the best stock in the market when comparing it to others for long term holders. It deserves a bounce."
A friend turned me on to MSFT back in the 80's. We have a long tradition of selling and having dinner followed by a soft serve ice cream cone. He called and asked if wanted to get dinner tomorrow. I'm selling one share tomorrow and looking forward to seeing my friend and that ice cream cone.
WOOOO 100 !!

"Bullish on this, new window10X is coming?"
microsoft is viewed as a “flight to safety” in the tech arena
"I'm confident that $MSFT will ""recover"" (north of $106) over the next week. Guessing that $105 to $108 will be the trading range in the near term. It's wishful thinking that this will go above $110 anytime soon. But, the Fed has indicated no more rate hikes for now, so the wind is at least blowing in the right direction!Notes:MSFT missed consensus revenue by less than 0.2% ($60 million on $32.53 Billion) Cloud-related + Azure way up! Shortage in INTC chips was a drag on PC/Win sales. (I sure hope they can utilize AMD chips more in the future)So, very little ""real"" bad news. Wall St is just playing this to their advantage (trying to shake the weak hands as usual)"
"MSFT sweat heart you are incredible, determined to hit a trillion."

This stock is proving to be a very strong one
"MSFT is currently a $300 stock, their software is optimized for azure and gives them an advantage over any cloud provider, msft is gaining on aws and distancing itself from 3rd place google cloud..."
Chances of JEDI contract even better now. Do not sell a single share!
Never have any doubts about Mr. Softie !!! 275 is within reach !!!
If MSFT drops today I'm in bliss as i get to buy a ton on a dip...if it soars I'm well invested so it's a WIN-WIN!!!
Do you think we see a run before Wednesday for the ex dividend date?
"Just looked at ""Conversations"" for the first time. Amazing to see the range of opinions and reactions. I especially laughed at ""Microsoft down two days in a row. Im selling my shares￼.""

"Tech Valuations Are Stretched, But Investors Are Still Bullish, Survey Finds -- Barrons.comDOW JONES & COMPANY, INC. 5:59 AM ET 1/6/2020 Symbol Last Price Change CRM 166.17down 0 (0%) MSFT 158.62down 0 (0%) FB 208.67down 0 (0%) CSCO 47.63down 0 (0%) INTC 60.1down 0 (0%) QUOTES AS OF 06:30:00 PM ET 01/03/2020 Tech stocks had a great year in 2019, and institutional investors remain bullish on the sector for 2020 -- maybe a little too bullish.That's one of the conclusions of a recent investor survey conducted by Wolfe Research tech strategist Steve Milunovich. He writes in a research note Friday that Wolfe expects high single-digit overall stock market returns this year driven by central bank easing, moderating trade tensions with China and the probability of a moderate Democratic Presidential nominee. The tech sector, he adds, should do well in that environment.But Milunovich adds that he's recommending a market weighting in tech shares, asserting that the sector is "" overbought near term,"" that earnings expectations may be too high for 2020, and that the ""malinvestment created by money printing"" will come home to roost, perhaps in 2021 rather than 2020.Milunovich finds other warning signs. ""The stock market cap-to-GDP ratio is about 150%, the highest since 2000, and a number of valuation metrics are near extreme levels,"" he writes. ""Central banks' easiness is a source of near-term support but long-term risk. We would argue that easy money led to the bubbles of 2000 and 2008 and that we may be in the midst of a credit bubble.""And he points out that tech stock valuations are at the highest they've been since 2000. His research note includes a list of 39 companies trading for more than 10 times next 12 months sales -- most of them enterprise software companies.Nonetheless, Milunovich reports that his latest tech investor survey found 67% of respondents bullish on the market, with 6% bearish and none ""very bearish.""In the survey, investors were asked to name their favorite stocks -- and their least favorite. -- Salesforce.com(CRM) was the most popular long. Milunovch notes that the stock has underperformed while digesting its June 2019 acquisition of data analytics provider Tableau Software for $15.7 billion, and that ""there is anticipation of a catch up."" -- Microsoft(MSFT) was next on the list. ""Given Azure momentum, there is little negative to say other than tougher compares and an expanded multiple,"" he writes. -- Nvidia (NVDA) was third on the list, but it also showed up among the ranks of the least liked. ""We agree with the positive view given growth in AI and new product offerings for inference [artificial intelligence] and the edge."" -- Rounding out the top five list: Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook(FB) , despite regulatory concerns. Milunovich notes that the compensation plan for new Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai ties stock vesting to the stock's relative performance.As for the stocks investors like the least, the roster is dominated by legacy tech. -- IBM (IBM) tops the list, with Oracle (ORCL) next. ""Investors aren't yet convinced by IBM's Red Hat acquisition nor Oracle's autonomous database offering,"" he writes. -- Cisco(CSCO) recently cut top-line guidance by about $1 billion, and ""a quick recovery is not expected."" -- Intel(INTC) also is among the least loved. Despite ""reasonable"" valuation, Milunovich finds that the chip giant has ""execution and [market] share challenges."" -- And then there's Nvidia again. He notes that ""the bear case includes high valuation and rising competition from Intel(INTC), AMD and startups.""The survey also asked about tech trends.""The hottest tech trend is 5G,"" he writes. ""Marketing of 5G handsets could lift sales later in 2020, but we think the real impact will be in enterprise IoT applications later. Public cloud continues to benefit hyperscalers [like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud] and their component suppliers while disadvantaging legacy vendors. AI is more ingredient than product but could prove highly disruptive. Investors seem calmer about regulation, which was the top issue last survey.""Write to Eric J.

I see Microsoft down from their highs slightly, still $10 off from 1yr target, and trading bullish from good earnings & news.

"I have nothing to go on but a gut feeling that MS will buy Tik Tok, not just the English speaking countries, but the entire platform. It does not make sense to split the company up. They have the cash and the synergy makes sense. Like I said, just my gut but I’m taking the gamble and staying long. No news is good news and the price will reflect the value of a mega company and could make MS the first 2 trillion dollar company in the future. Tik Tok needs to sell, that’s obvious...and sooner rather than later. Hope my gut is right."

"Does anyone see a monthly cup and handle chart? with the downtrend from 107 to 105 (especially considering the low-er volume over the past week/two weeks? I was happy with the technical indicator of holding above its 150 DMA finally, but if a cup and handle has formed, February and March will be great months to be in MSFT. Just needs to stay above the 150 DMA come Tuesday. Once the 50 DMA finishes averaging over the worst of December it will begin pushing much higher, and if it crosses the 200DMA... well... algos will finally be in MSFT favor. Hoping for the best."
I hope hedge funds go take huge losses and are forced to sell their shares for the little guys to #$%$ up.

"‘Shocked’ yes, today’s developments shocked the Chinese market. This is absolutely positive for U.S, negative on China because the ability of China to retaliate is somewhat more limited compared to the U.S at least in the short term.

We are in the beginning of an information technology war, as U.S Secretary Pompeo said ban on Chinese tech could go beyond TikTok and WeChat."

If yes, do you believe the stock price growth will be slower to stagnate or be negative? Any additional information that you can share to support your point of view would be really helpful. Thank you in advance."
have no idea what's going on but i love it!!!!thank you MSFT!!!!!!
Thank you Satya Nutella for all the great work your doing.

We love to see this strong chart of MSFT today! It’s coming back stronger now!
Not gonna sell. The market swings. Long term investing.
I feel bad that Microsoft is getting straight disrespected because of GME
BOOM
I believe this is priced in. Been red for past few days basically. Todays fall is retail sales from people just reading about the Jedi halt and selling out of panic.
MSFT firm and solid.
Satya: congratulations to one of the most innovative business minds on the planet!
$MSFT gives a Twitter shout out to their partner $APXT. How many other companies is MSFT partnered with trading under $20.. Today’s price action was because of the down market. Avepoint and MS are creating something big.

What's wrong with MSFT? .
Hi there !!! What is the msft p/e ratio..according to yahoo finance is 75; 95 but if you see cnbc is 28...so which is correct ?
"It’s funny cause I’m a week while this is going through court, people will forget about it and Microsoft will begin to creep back up, and when Microsoft eventually wins this waste of time, the stock will go even higher"
"So many posters here from folks that seem to think MSFT is immune to a downturn because of the profitability of its cloud business. First, even its recent 40% growth trajectory, though spectacular for a company this size, could not justify the doubling of its sp in less than a year. Second, this growth rate will now be spectacularly reduced as a result of the severe economic down-turn, if only because hardware still represents a significant part of MSFT's business. The company remains a safe investment for the future, but rest assured that within the next few weeks you will be able to buy the stock for a lot less."
At first when Microsoft became known they paid the highest dividend of any company now they lag behind Wal-Mart which is next to pitiful.
Goldman with a street high of $285! 
MSFT has reached its all time peak price and now it is at sell point. I will definitely see some correction from here in near term or lower price from this level in this year.
All about the CC now. Any potential bad news outta the way. Onwards and upwards. Satya will have ‘em salivating at 5:30. Get ready folks.

"Let's say you ignore the fact that MSFT makes real Money (that is supposed to matter to the Analysts who guide the public), real dividend and has a real Pipeline that CAN'T End. The type of Cloud Customers MSFT has means retaining records forever in The Cloud. There are different levels of Cloud Costs. MSFT offers Advanced Protection that I believe they have described as unhackable. Forget that for a minute. When Windows 10 kicked off there where a Plethora of Free Cloud Storage offers from MSFT, PC Purchases HD and Backup Drive 3rd parties. People lives are on the Azure cloud form peoples Photo's to Developers life's work. Azure integrates into a Windows 10 PC like a regular C Hard Drive. That means it is very important. Those free offers end date is right in this time frame. MSFT sent messages saying that if you do not pay for Cloud Storage your data will be removed soon by a certain date. If you buy Office 365 it includes the Cloud Space. Users face losing everything or simply clicking a buy Office 365 with the same User name and that is it, your One Drive Azure Problem is fixed and well worth it for the cheap price they charge. This year it is not only a wave of Business Cloud but all the too many zeros for me to type of Personal users paying to keep the data they stored during Free Cloud Promo Offers that are now expiring. I my not be a fancy analyst but that sort of means a surprise in Office 365 Personal & Small Business sales just to keep all the Data they have up on Azure Cloud. That in combination with the big boys being faced with a looming W7change to W10 or pay whatever extended service special deal extensions may be earnings catalysts in my opinion."
We need the shorts to get fried here also

"The technology giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of the favorite stocks of billionaire Izzy Englander. The hedge fund has raised its position in MSFT by 100% in the latest quarter to 0.41% of the overall portfolio.Several hedge funds are bullish on Microsoft Corporation.

Everyone knows that Microsoft is a solid investment. Solid financials. Solid management. Solid products. Around 20% increases in revenue per year. I mean what else do you want?
"market nervous about IBM, ADBE, WoRKDAY, all down post earnings.. some enterprise spending cloud worries"
"What do you guys want? MSFT to sky rocket like TSLA? Hah Msft is a healthy stable stock. As a matter of fact, i like this drop. It just reinforces MSFT great health after gaining so much in the last weeks. Use this as an opportunity to buy more. Just picked up some March 27 200 calls and debit spreads for cheap. Also, Jan 2021 calls are on sale too."
"So much involved in this potential acquisition. What makes this even more complex is the political influence. I would not be celebrating at this point. Yesterday’s rise will be offset today when reality sets in. The 225 to 230 at the end of the week is very unlikely. With the job reports this week, I would expect 195 to 205."
A prime example of the saying past performance does not indicate future performance.

MSFT just costed me a 1975 Dom Perignon Champagne. tsk tsk....Cheers!!!Todays earning shall turbocharge confidence among analyst and investors. Upgrade $150 coming.
"What Microsoft really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Microsoft (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Microsoft just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

IBM shoots up cause of its cloud.. meanwhile Msft’s cloud is just as impressive
"This will easily see 143 tomorrow. 4% share buy back AND 11% dividend increase, pff forget about it. More all time highs coming"
I hope the whole day doesn't look like this...
I capitalized so much from the big sell off last week. Bought some high quality companies at a once in a lifetime discount. Fear is such a great asset for long term investors!! You only lose when you sell. People should train themselves to resist the urge to do so when you’re in the red!!
OPENS AT 109 THAN RUNS TO 113
"So of all the MAGA stocks, which ones are most invested in China...Microsoft? Apple? Google? Amazon? What about Tesla??Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Microsoft has the least exposure to China.So (if this is true), it should be the least ""risky"" of all these stocks. Just my opinion."
Can’t really call it a selloff after the ER..... which was excellent. We go up from here. Still predicting we take out the old highs by Semana Santa (Easter)
I'm holding until Nadella leaves.
MSFT has 96% of the software market and is 1 or 2 in the cloud. Thank you Bill Gates for an enduring investment and now leadership under Mr Nadella.
She's a keeper :D
I’m adding to my position. Easy money that I don’t need in cash .
#MSFT Volume is good. On watch for clear above 111.15. Six months target: 129.82 at stoxline.
"Didn't hit $217 today, but the week isn't over. Maybe tomorrow? Could easily happen."
do any of you are buying Microsoft right now?I want to add more shares but I know is at its highest?
"Ultimately, it boils down to our expectations from the stock. In my opinion, Microsoft is a solid company with a tremendous growth potential. However, I find that its stock has barely performed since July 2020. Others may think of it as wonderful performance and that’s ok. But, I don’t find a $10 (approximately) increase in 6-7 months to be impressive at all. You can cite all the numbers from 2018 and 2019, and even last couple of weeks, but the fact remains that the stock price has gone up only $10 from late August 2020 levels. If you’re satisfied — good for you, but don’t debate with me that the stock has wonderful performance, because it doesn’t."

I love MSFT!!!! One of the best stocks I own!
"Got out of my MSFT earlier today at $228.50 (with an avg purchase price of 226.25), might get back in at close if it keeps dropping. (I would say 226 is a good entry point for the moment)I believe MSFT will have a positive surprise (AZURE, gaming subscriptions, XBOX), so no worries for longs.Personally, the drama surrounding delays in the economic stimulus and continued bad COVID stats is too worrisome for me to just hold and forget."
trufurcation around the 200 day is causing uncertainty. short term. buy at intermediate price points.
"Up $20 tomorrow...Microsoft, Tesla,AMD, Facebook and apple strong"
Just heard on the news that Texas tax will continue to decline.
"I'm a long share holder in MS but I don't believe todays rise is anything more than large funds rotating back into 'safe' Covid stocks. We watched MS drop earlier this month when the Vacines started to make 'traditional' stocks like like good bets, now with Covid issues in England, the funds are moving back to MS. When things start to look safer again expect a drop off again. The great thing about MS is they are a sound company with great management and products. After these swings (up and down) they always seem to return to a new base a bit above where they started. I expect this will be the case again this time :)"
added 200 at 213. sell at 216
How do I know I've muted the right people? When I see a quality MSFT-related post and the 50% of the replies I can see are thoughtful and informed.
yay! above 100!!!!
All these negative posts but still up 37% over 12 months. Where oh where can you find consistent returns like this.
$112.19 appears as a measured move.

"First Lady Visits Microsoft to Discuss Online Safety for KidsFirst Lady Melania Trump visited Microsoft in Washington state yesterday to learn about the company’s work on accessibility and online safety for children, Paul Roberts reports in The Seattle Times. The software giant “was the second stop in a three-city tour to promote the first lady’s ‘Be Best’ initiative, which is calling attention to child well-being, online safety and anti-bullying efforts and opioid abuse.” The First Lady’s trip began yesterday morning with a visit to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, charter school and will conclude today with a town hall on the opioid epidemic in Las Vegas, Nevada."

all sellers today come running back next week to MSFT.

"$BE dip today has more to do with interest rate steady statement by Fed ( market was expecting another year cut this year) and China panic ( by the way flu seems to be contained within China & territories, and has a similar mortality risk profile to the US Influenza virus..) Wall Street Media is talking up the scare news to sell its agenda and creating panic so they buy your stock for cheap ..Suddenly a few weeks from now this will be a non risk issue, and market will come back up and you would have sold at a loss. Just look at $TSLA and $MSFT stock today - after earnings release their stock went up in spite of the “world coming to an end” fake news..China stock trading is resuming on Monday and their government has assured extreme liquidity - in other words the Chinese govt is not going to let their markets fall more than a certain degree and their banks will actively inject capital.The main event here is BE earnings release and projections...have a steady hand until then..$BE has the makings of $TSLA stock !"

"Think profit taking is being hid behind the Corona virus, it was claimed on Monday that the Corona virus was the call for the market downturn, but in the case of MSFT, if Corona virus had anything to do with the stock price, exactly why did MSFT pop up past $176+ briefly after hours? This was roughly a $16/share move from the low on Monday to after hours on Wednesday, didn't look like there was any concerns about the Corona virus, more like the opportunity to snag enormous profits for those going both short and long in the market."
"We are in bull market... great time to put your $$$ to work. MSFT as safe as they get with great reward. Floor set at 165 and great upside into next weeks earning. Will surpass expectations with 365, teams, azure and others. My safety nest egg."

"To all my retail investing friends. $MSFT will be at least $300 before the end of 2021. That's about 50% upside. How?1. Increase in the existing business. Last 2 quarters they have signed record cloud and other services customers. Pay special attention - SERVICES. It has long moved from selling software to a SaaS company.2. It has so much cash on it's book doing almost nothing, and it's on the prowl to buy. It will buy companies like Tik Tok - which will give it amazing revenue and hype, and other solid businesses. I had put a put in this forum when the price was 54, then about a 100, then 150s, then 180s. Now it's 208. It will go up and down, but net net $300, Dec 2021."

"Please guide above expectations.... re accelerating topline growth, re accelerating Azure profit driver... topline and bottom line beats.. it blows my mind MSFT traded sideways while everything EV, pot, and stuff that Cathie Woods touched has been skyrocketing compared to this.."
ms beats on all fronts. good times ahead
"Wait until they hold the call and share the special dividend, cash repatriation details, etc."
"down goes tech- I'm glad I peeled some shares of high flyers in my port, MSFT and AAPL. Recycled some funds into higher div yield stocks. More income for the early retired div paycheck machine!"
"Since Jan 16, undervalued MSFT volume has increased steadily daily to a higher average volume, indicating big money accumulation......……now they have the corona hyped so they can get your shares for a bigger discount. Same situation with undervalued AMD. I'm not selling my undervalued stocks. The virus will pass soon."
"This is extremely strange, this is one of the most healthy companies in the market and also is the least possible to be affected by the Coronavirus, yet it’s sinking more that the rest. Some times stock market doesn’t make any sense."
Cruising through $180 tomorrow
Time to turn up.... come on MSFT...
bought more at 185.75
Monday some upgrade news and any talk about DOD awards will have jumping effect on MSFT
If the deal goes through in the next few weeks maybe msft hits 240-260 with room to grow in time...if bad news starts plaguing this beaut of a stock with the deal being more propaganda then I think it wont affect it severely and it settles around 207 without the acquisition...every comment on here is an opinion just like mine so take it as a grain of salt...all the same I got dollars on the line while that’s at least what we still use to conduct business....
MSFT in a great position. Less likely to be affected by global slowdown than other tech companies. More subscription services.
why would anyone short such a solid company that is positioned for tremendous growth across multiple sectors? Microsoft is ATH for a reason and that reason is only growing.
MSFT will probably will be doing the usual is to drop the day after earnings.
"This deal is going to be worth somewhere in the 5-10 billion dollar range, ByteDance is trying to play hardball and up the price but it’s going to end up crashing and burning in their face they have a time frame to get this done that means the value of the deal goes lower as every day goes by. No other bidder will be able to match Microsoft’s offer so the more they try and leak “these potential suitors” and let time go bye the smaller the Microsoft offer becomes. Really bad business on tik toks part."
No need to PANIC...good earning...should go up
I feel that this is the snowball at the top of the hill just waiting for A little nudge. and then this Juggernaut will be unstoppable.
Almost MSFT dropped the most of the tech stocks I follow. Why?
Apple crushes earnings. Tomorrow it’s Mister Softie’s turn. Bring on the new all time high!
"Earnings tonight should be good, they are firings on all cylinders in Cloud."

"At current market, Msft is a sure winning stock. Both Dell and HP come out and said PC market is strong even after the pandemic. Micron, WDC, and Seagate are all at 52 week high for DRAM and HDD products which confirm Dell and HP claim. Microsoft will pass all time high soon!"
mstf just catching it's breath
This is setting up for $200 after next earnings report!
"As a life holder of MSFT, let it dip so I can dip my fingers in it some more !"
"I’m in the technology domain and given that MSFT with azure, windows, tablets... its way undervalued, the market made an elephant out of amzn based on its cloud, MSFT is right behind it with the legacy windows. Considering all these factors MSFT is very undervalued and should be in the upper 200s"
General Motors (NYSE:GM) says it has entered a long-term strategic relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles.From seeking alpha
sell at $80
Amazon has no chance of reversing this. Almost impossible to prove MSFT did not deserve this contract!
I called it downward and sideways. Msft is a great company but it isn’t going to jump 20 points from yesterday. Don’t kid yourself people.
If numbers are solid why did the stock drop $2.00 yesterday
Arguably as well positioned a company going forward as there is out there. Tremendous drivers pushing this stock and whats flying under the radar (except for savvy investors and Hedge Funds) is Edge Computing. Microsoft is the leader in Edge Computjng and many experts in this field suggest that one day Cloud Computing will dwarf The Cloud in sales. So either way we are covered. MSFT is a must owned stock. IMHO
"REDMOND, Wash. — January 30, 2019 — Microsoft Corp. today announced the following results for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the corresponding period of last fiscal year: • Revenue was $32.5 billion and increased 12% • Operating income was $10.3 billion and increased 18% • Net income was $8.4 billion GAAP and $8.6 billion non-GAAP • Diluted earnings per share was $1.08 GAAP and $1.10 non-GAAP“Our strong commercial cloud results reflect our deep and growing partnerships with leading companies in every industry including retail, financial services, and healthcare,” said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. “We are delivering differentiated value across the cloud and edge as we work to earn customer trust every day.”"
Microsoft reached an all time high at 245.07
Next earnings beat easily. Everything is on track for this growth stock
MSFT is for investors who believe in a decades-old company still in the vanguard and innovating in every conceivable niche globally.
Place your bets for a banner year for MSFT in 2021.
No reason this isn’t 245. Day traders jumping off but longs know where this will be in 6 months. 
Breaking Microsoft partners now with Walgreens add that to walmart and the rest
Blowout earnings and up mere 2%.....I guess it is no GameStop! Congrats all longs.....this one is a lifetime hold!
"Anonymous,It won't take 3 years to get to $200!Look at the long chart and remember X divi!"
"Let me repeat again, undervalued MSFT is in a competition with undervalued AMD to go to new highs every week...……."
"“We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months. From remote teamwork and learning, to sales and customer service, to critical cloud infrastructure and security – we are working alongside customers every day to help them adapt and stay open for business in a world of remote everything,” said Satya Nadella, chief executive officer of Microsoft. “Our durable business model, diversified portfolio, and differentiated technology stack position us well for what’s ahead.”"
This hack has been talked about for days . It’ll be an up week for MSFT . Will close out the week around 240
Buenos Dias Damas y Caballeros! Súper Satya deliveries the goods today on MSFT’s blockbuster ER. It’s all about Azure and the hybrid cloud is on FIRE. Look for new high and entree into the $240’’s once the dust settles and all the raised guidances comes in from the Fund Managers. IMHO 
Thanks for the cheap Msft and AAPL shares. Two titans which will continue to dominate and be cash machines.

MSFT is on a program of total world conquest. They have attacked every PC in the world that is running 10. They have every nation at their mercy in their cloud. Their nanovirus is nearing full distro and will be activated by 5G signal at which time they will own every person in the world. Quite impressive.
Looks like msft has found some support here. Hopefully up from here
Hehe lol MSFT keep going 
Microsoft expected to hit new 52 week high later this year.

AH moving up fast
"Microsoft price target raised to $189 from $157 at Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss raised his price target on Microsoft shares to $189 from $157. While a rising mix of Cloud revenues, the lapping of product cycles in the high margin Windows OEM, Windows Server and SQL Server business and the upcoming Gaming hardware cycles have some investors concerned about gross margin improvements in the company's fiscal 2021, Weiss said he estimates gross margins can increase, not decrease, in FY21 compared to FY20. The analyst, who continues to model a 12%+ gross profit dollar CAGR through FY22, with gross margins expanding each year, keeps an Overweight rating on Microsoft shares."
What's going on?
Investors are leaving the FAANG stocks & will be buying MSFT. MSFT is not having the variable issues that are chasing investors out of he FAANG stocks. FAANGS are red every day and MSFT is green. DRJ

As I said easiest 10% ever

I feel confident that Microsoft will overtake Amazon in the 1 Trillion market cap race. MSFT will be second to AAPL.

Lol only 3%??

IMHO I think we will see a slight pull back. I will be buying more calls in a week or so.
"Big tech like MSFT, GOOG, and apple with huge growth and consistent income are re-rating to PE's of 40 as a result of all of that QE and extra liquidity created by money printing. What does that mean?MSFT Earnings = 6.71 x 40 = 268.40 right now for MSFT. Jedi project is worth 10 billion over 10 years 1 billion a year. The lawsuit and frankly the contract are nothing in relation to MSFT current earnings and growth it is a non- factor and is only gravy if it gets executed. However, shorts use it to scare people it is a non-event! Disregard entirely.MSFT is the only big tech stock not on the US or EU regulators big money fine hit list!This will be a 325 stock by the end of this calendar year!"

"Please inform me since MSFT has been sold off at $110 for three says in a row why would an investor think 109.50 is a buy?The only answer I came come up with is an investor would not, but with very light volume a group manipulating the stock may. Their bank financing can be based on the closing tic. There is so much leverage at these prices it's ridiculous.Forget value just look at the action, it's fake (wash) trades in large part."

Gonna be a red day today boys I’ll see y’all tomorrow.
"This company has by far the best CEO of any tech company. Satya Nadella knows what he is doing. Came in with a mindset to turn Microsoft around, and did just that in an impressively short amount of time. I wanted in on this company when it was $34 4 years ago but I was in University and had no money. Working now, I still think any shares under $100 is a steal given the future potential of this company. Good luck everyone!"
No matter what Microsoft will reach 200 very soon
"Hold on to 185, get your golden tickets"
"Come on guys and gals, NOTHING has changed for MSFT from 30 days ago. It was a great company then and it still is. This is a set back yes, but not of the companies doing, nothing about financials and operations has changed. BUY more!!"

This has to be the number 1 Company in the world. Strong comeback from oversold market fears.
WOWShe's a winner!
"Microsoft is obviously a great company, but a 7% move up in 5 days is way too over-extended. It's a 1.5 Trillion dollar company. Adding a position here in my opinion is insane. Sure, the funds may do it, but it's not really their money. Thoughts?"
How many people in this chat are bots? Identify yourself please!!!
The breakout continues as predicted. Let’s take out the old 52 week high.

"We ultralongs are smarter than Bill Gates.Gates hasn’t figured out that renewables will be massively overbuilt to account for their lower availability percentage.At other times renewables massively overproduce like in the spring before A/C use kicks in.That is when massive amounts of green hydrogen will be produced, to be used for transportation, electrical power, and heavy industry.Texas could have been drawing from massive stores of green hydrogen stored in their abundant salt domes, creating electricity from fuel cells and turbines.Perhaps someone from $MSFT can clue Gates in, and also tell him we don’t need nuclear."

"Davos advocate Bill Gates, the doctor, scientist, and divine media power..........PLEASE"
It is down because the company didn't provide forward guidance. But it said it would do so at the end of the CC. Market doesn't like uncertainty.
"If MSFT had a P/E of 20, I would buy with both hands, but it's well over 30 now, and forward. Along with the rest of tech, it has gotten ahead of itself. It's a $150.00 stock in normal times, which will return, at some point when Wall St. has pumped as much as they can."
"Lets face it, MSFT will grow at a slow (very?) rate.We'd be lucky to reach 250 this year."
businesses use Microsoft... it’s everywhere. Makes sense that the pentagon would presumably want to integrate it even more so. Work with the devil you know. Aka Kiss plan. The noise with Amazon is just that. Keep the heat on trump. Has anyone else noticed all of the anti trump adds on these social sites? FYI I didn’t vote for trump but am sickened by hostility created by the games of perception. The amazon thing will be all over the news to perpetuate created perception. Go Microsoft.
"During the company's Jan. 30 conference call, CEO Satya Nadella attributed Dynamics' growth to a ""differentiated approach"" that made CRM and marketing solutions ""more modular, extensible, and AI-driven."" In other words, Microsoft provides flexible and customizable solutions that can be integrated with a wide range of other services -- including its Azure IoT (Internet of Things), AI, and Mixed Reality (virtual and augmented reality) platforms. Integrating Adobe's Experience Cloud into that ecosystem complements that strategy.LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired in 2016, grew its average visits 30% year-over-year last quarter on higher engagement rates and job postings among its 610 million members. Its revenue rose 29% annually. Microsoft is gradually tethering LinkedIn to Office 365 and Dynamics 365, and seamless connections with Adobe's Experience Cloud could help enterprise users manage hiring, marketing, and customer relationships from a single pool of contacts."

"insider buying, is always a very good signMicrosoft director buys 4.3K shares of common stockn a regulatory filing, Microsoft disclosed that its board member Emma Walmsley bought 4.3K shares of common stock on March 10th in a transaction totaling $1.02M, boosting her stake by 592%."
"Advice is free, so here is my mine. I believe MSFT will both increase the annual div. and pay a one time special dividend. Why you ask. all shareholders will enjoy this money and spend it. We are under top leadership now. The reign of Balmer years are past us. No performance over those years , He was Gates college roommate. Hanger on."
Bought 50 contracts. I need $106 like blood!
"Hey . . . where is that whiny dude called himself ""investor?""Probably bailed at $212!LOL"
"JEDI, Azure Cloud, AI, gaming, underwater data center...300 is realistic for all these accomishments..time to show us!"

I’m so glad I cycled into a big position at 200... I promise myself I won’t sell any until I retire in 30 years.
Will pop over 114 tomorrow with dividend announcement
Wow ... go MSFT! 
"YES, the ER was THAT good. "
MSFT is the gateway to generational wealth..Tik Tok deal is a blip.
Nice rally
"Dead money since June. Shareholder value is on the decline and the ""woke"" MSFT leadership is asleep."
"I'm and so glad Microsoft might acquire tiktok. However...i am worried that this deal will fall through due to tensions with china. I'm all in on Microsoft and i want this as much as any other investor. But i have a bad feeling about this. Depending on how tomorrow goes with Microsoft, it might not be a bad idea to take some profits and run for now. There are other good investments out there currently."
@IG muted spreading nonsence. People don't listen / learn after january 6th
momo get a grip MSFT. is collaborating with a lot of companies to be huge can be $200.00 in weeks to come
Have a great holiday guys. We will see new ATH's with MSFT tomorrow and the whole week. 113+ Tomorrow!
We all acting like pros...we all expressing our wish number rather than what will happen.MSFT is a jumbo elephant that moves slow...but I agree too 130-135 in 3 months if not sooner
This company owns the infrastructure of the web AZURE will be the strongest cloud 
why i see a lot of positive encouraging comments about MSFT? most of the stocks are up since Dec and yet MSFT is back to $212? Time to sell folks
This thing always sells off towards the end of the day. Why?
There is always people here showing off saying they are holding onto a great deal of shares...so what is the point to say such preposterous and laughable things. The idea of the board is to post reasonable and insighful comments period.
Strong guidance. Up tomorrow!
SALESFORCE TO SWITCH THEIR MARKETING CLOUD TO AZURE.....OH...THAT IS A HUGE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE FOR NADELA.....THIS MAY BE A SIGN OF A MASSIVE MOVE TO MSFT.....TRUST IS THE KEY...
I was set to get some MSFT for $160. Waited a few hours and got them for $158. Thank you all who overreacted ;) Keep it that way please. I still have 20y to go before I retire.

the winner is MSFT
"Hello, I wanted to ask, would Microsoft be a good long term investment ? obviously it's ultimately down to my own DD, it's just I wanted other people's opinions before I bought any shares. Thanks."
"And NOW, ON TO APPLE EARNINGS!"
"The Dem's are going to send me $2,000 and my wife $2,000. That's awfully nice of them. We are millionaires, but the Democrats think we need another 4 grand so who am I to argue?LOL"

Ascending Triple Top Breakout....10-28-19.... PT= 181.00....
I think this is the safest “FAANG” (I know Microsoft is typically not associated is this acronym) stock given the current political climate.
I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx
back on track
3 institutional holders increased there share counts today and yesterday!!
Should I sell tomorrow in the firs hour or should i hold?
UBS raised it's price target on MSFT to $275
MSFT is surpassing CRM right now!
Big volume in last 5 minutes 5.97M. Good signal for next week.
Rising in AH on new dsic free and Blu-ray free Xbox launch in April or May. Most likely to gap up tomorrow if Trump stays quiet about tariffs on FB.
"I don’t understand investors. MSFT has really great earnings, bright prospects with cloud development and Windows transition to 10 format and very little tariff war exposure. This thing should be zooming upward."
MSFT is differentiating itself from Amazon by preying on fears of Amazon's ecom business competing with customers of AWS. Very good strategy that coz MSFT can't compete on price alone. Shows how ruthless and smart Satya Nadella is! Back this guy!!
They crushed
"To put things in perspective, $AMZN the leading cloud service provider is trading at a P/E of ~88.9.$MSFT, the next largest cloud service provider (and winner of the JEDI contract) at a P/E of ~31.21.A P/E of 35 will puts $MSFT at a little above $200.Will it happen?"
"Got by the first major hurdle. Next will be the CC and guidance. If they complete the circle We Fly High, no lie."
"THIS UNBELIEVABLE, BOTH MSFT and AAPL are exactly at $131.96 on last Friday. Wth"

Anyone have comments about Crowstrike comments about MSFS?
Thursday earnings = short squeeze Friday
"Its Started --->Washington St. Democratic lawmakers propose massive gas tax increase, one dollar per gallon to start."
MSFT is for long term holders. It is for your retirement funds. A dip is a gift to buy more to lower your average acquisition/holding cost. This is a very well managed company with a reasonably young (53 years old) CEO at the helm.
New PT of 218.
Come one $200!!!
Slow but sure winning the race. Works for me. 1% a day is fine. Long term holder.

Zooms email plans are going to be a flop. Nobody cares enough to switch from Outlook. What a joke.
Big tech looking strong today might have bottomed...
Probably the safest stock in the world to own right now
And Google cloud falling behind msft cloud
Earnings today? Wow thought it was next week. Haven’t heard much news. That $270 price target was a month back
Back not to long ago when it was just under a hundred dollars I told you now is the time to buy MSFT.. I also said it will go to 120 and said you will thank me later... Here we are... 
"Here we go, up to 300!"
"Like I said last wk,We need a 5-10% correction.Back down to $212"
Think my $117 option for 11/17 is safe? I feel like that’s a lot of ground to make up in a month
"The best undervalued buys in Wall Street; AMD, MSFT. Do your home work and win big."
Seeing rotation from high tech good and safe names - msft - aapl - nflx - and stay at home stocks into broader market. Money often looks for short term returns so just ride it out .
"One of the top 5 stock in the world to store your money in. Very strong business model, amazing balance sheet and not too much affected by the virus. I expect the markets to fall again and i won’t miss the chance to reload. Most evident no brainer in the stock market universe"
love it!!!!! if it goes to 129 ill add 20 more shares!!!!!
be ready for a big jump in the last hour lol
great end of day here!
what happened to MSFT ? Market crash ? Msft is killing us ! I bought in at $236/share ! Should I sell or stay ?
"Will, i'm officially negative for the year on my overall portfolio. I had some excellent option plays earlier in the year also. Oh well. Easy come easy go, MSFT and tech will bounce back."
just buy the dips. its a market full of daytraders.
MS ups price target to $130 with BUY rating
Indiscriminate dumping. To think this was $245 in a.h. yesterday. Could have. Should have.
"If $MSFT didn’t go up after there great earnings tomorrow, it means $AAPL & $FB will follow the same."
"Like the famous economist John Maynard Keynes said, “the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.This simply means don't bet against the FED. The increases in equities could continue for much longer than you think. Although I think the increase for MSFT has been truly abysmal!! We are trading $10 above the pre covid high. Think about that for a second, we've increased profits but are trading 5% up pre covid. Other stocks and companies like Boeing have needed billions from the gov to stay afloat. We have actually thrived post covid!HONESTLY, WHAT IS THE TOP FOR MSFT? I WILL ONLY BE SATISFIED WHEN THIS INCREASES BY 50% OF PRE COVID HIGHS."
WooooW as i said this morning 95$ by END of the Day...NOW ITS REAL....BE READY FOR 97$ TOMORROW IF APPLE EARNINGS ARE GOOD
Relax people... Today option expiration has been holding this near $200 (Huge call options at $200).Monday this will take off
just saw that microsoft entered to the ev space (https://youtu.be/QFHN98u1ozQ) do you think it is already priced in the stock price or it will impact only far in future? is it worth buying ahead of earnings?
Was Capital One using AWA cloud when their 100 million user accounts were hacked?
"From Reuters: ""Investor favorites including Apple Inc were sold off recently by hedge funds to cover billions of dollars in losses""This, if true is quite remarkable. When will the bleeding stop! I am waiting for the turn around, and then I will get back in. I'm looking for entry to long positions for MSFT and AMD. I'm waiting by the sidelines, as things are falling. On my radar to buy long are MSFT and AMD"
So what date can people sell and still get the dividend? Also doesn’t stock price get reduced by the dividend too?
"I'd like to see MS hit 300+ this year. I use their products every day at work. Office 365, outlook, word, excel and teams and of course the Windows 10 OS all throughout the office. MS Teams is superior to Zoom in every way, MS needs to take more market share from them in this category."
"Took, a long position on MSFT, april 2019 100, love this company !"
After hours news : Microsoft collaborates with Telecom Egypt to extend its global cloud network to Egypt(PR Newswire)
MSFT playing politics. Not a good place to be. when most of their investors are backing the opposite party.
"It's crazy. This thing could reach $200 per share within the next couple months, if that. In the 10 years before Nadella took over, it had a hard time staying over $50. Crazy."

MSFT will recover. Initial reaction to Ga. election was way overblown.
Best earning
"Unbelievable, lol. Not mad, but I'm very surprised we went from a high of 140 to 137.50 a day before earnings. Still think we'll get a pop on earnings, however. The fact that the CEO got a 66% raise confirms to me good things are happening here."
Has MSFT announced what they Re doing with the repatriated money they brought back. Hope it is to buy out some start ups and increase pops in future
why is this going down down into good earnings????!
Close at the high of the day and 52 week high!!! Go MSFT!!!
$250 sounds about right. MSFT will get to $250 soon so jump on board!
"Someone interviewed Steve Ballmer the other day on CNBC! The question was: What has Nadella done right and what has he done wrong? I almost split a gut - Ballmer couldn't shine Nedella'shoes!I listened to the (call) (over 53 minutes). After the earnings release and in all fairness, they analysts hadn't heard it, they had a few minimal, disparaging comments about maintaining long term margins. They were talking about the next 4 quarters. My point here is that I wouldn't hire these analysts to shine my shoes and they have forgotten the most important aspect of running a business - the leader! In short, I'm with Nadella and looking at a great, great future!Watch the next five days!"
Looks like there was a bottom in big tech last Friday....not sure about the other risky high flying tech

"-> IF YOU <- use a phone, IOS / Android YOU are under complete surveillance, told what to think and sold to the highest bidder.-- we are far beyond 1984 ---"
Bullish on MSFT. I predict 2Q result on July 19th will push the stock price to $ 110.
Close anything above 107 would be fantastic. Slow but steady.
"I own 113 calls expiring 11/2. I have lost almost 80% already right I’m almost giving up. Even the day after earnings when msft popped 5%, my calls actually lost value by 30%. The next day msft dropped, my calls dropped as well. Anyone has an idea what makes calls to drop so drastically even when share price increases significantly. Same thing with Tesla when it popped 9%, my calls dropped off a cliff.I can’t get a break in this market"
"The cloud is only getting bigger with the 5G revolution taking place and still in its infancy. We all know who the BIG WINNER is with a growing cloud and that’s MICROSOFT.

Other winners in the 5G revolution will be Skyworks, Apple, and others but those are MY top picks.Enjoy!!!"
"Well made $10.210 in just a couple of hours. Thank you, MSFT. Cheers"

When MSFT goes up 2% it feels like 10%
MSFT is on Path to hit $155 by 2nd week of December or before.
Is MSFT worth buying at current market price for long term holdings?
onward to 120
109+ by tomorrow morning.
If MSFT falls 40% from its High makes it 114.00 per share.
Microsoft Corporation is at the upper part of a horizontal trend and normally this would pose a good selling opportunity but a break-up through the top trend line at $141.89 will give a strong buy signal and a trend shift may be expected
Back to 107$ tomorrow. GL
"Nice end of day rebound..MSFT you are the greatest, most resilient and innovative company there is"
as soon as the lady in the conference call gave double digit rev growth full year price took off
This stock wants to rocket into orbit. With a much anticipated ER in a few hours we may see a double digit pop if they hit big on their numbers. 
Microsoft has formed a base and is getting ready to breakout IMO. All we need is a catalyst...
I agree with John as another John. I will call myself John two. On the board I am also John. So as not to confuse others when they read John I will when I post say I am John two. MSFT is a long term hold. I bought low years ago and never sold a share. Really low. Good luck to all.
This is now the ONLY safe stock for next few weeks! And 3 weeks till dividend! Buy now!
Finally getting a little love not much but a tad

fact that MSFT also beat out IBM and Oracle legitimatizes the victory. Amazon's announced Trump influence is fake news

"As the year comes to a close, so very blessed for the YTD gains here, $snap, and $msft.

"Just to remind everyone this is Microsoft, not Beyond Meat, have patience, you will be seeing a lot of green soon."

"Make Dollars Not Pocket Change Shorting Microsoft Stock. While investors go long in expectation that the stock will appreciate in price, traders go short in anticipation that the stock will tumble. Short selling makes it possible to sell what one does not own. The short seller achieves this by borrowing the stock from a broker, and immediately selling the stock at its current market price, with the sale proceeds credited to the short seller’s margin account. At a future point in time, the short seller will cover the short position by buying it in the market and repaying the loaned stock to the broker.The difference between the sale price and the purchase price represents the short seller’s profit or loss. Let’s assume you short 100 shares of hypothetical stock ABC at $10 per share; after a period of time, the stock has declined to $5, at which point you buy it back. Your gross profit on this short sale is thus $500 ([$10 - $5] x 100 shares). Your net profit will be lower, owing to the costs involved with short selling. What are these costs (apart from the obvious one, trading commissions)? Margin interest, for one, which is the interest paid on the margin debt incurred for the short sale (explained in the next section). Then there’s the actual cost to borrow the stock, which can be quite high for stocks that are heavily shorted or difficult to borrow. Plus the short seller also has to pay the lender of the stock any dividends or rights declared during the course of the stock loan.The best thing to do right now is not buy Microsoft until it's much lower. I say 39 dollars less."
About time
After tomorrow afternoon I will be rich. I will be swimming in beaver pelt after msft reports
Back to where it belongs

It was in the news last month that $MSFT will design their own chips. I hope they will go to $TSM for fabrication like what $AAPL did. It is win win situation.

Great Q report from undervalued MSFT and Undervalued AMD. I'm expecting today for MSFT up minimum $12s by end of the day.
how do we make those shorts bankrupt  seems like the GME saga did not deter the shorting
"Happy Camper, own AAPL and MSFT. Things are good and getting better by the day. Strong and long,"
quotedMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported quarterly earnings of $1.51 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.32 by 14.39 percent. This is a 37.27 percent increase over earnings of $1.1 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $36.9 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $35.67 billion by 3.45 percent. This is a 13.64 percent increase over sales of $32.471 billion the same period last year.
What annual msft stock percentage increase would you be satisfied with over the next 3 years?
"As a ""full position"" Microsoft investor, I'm not happy with MSFT looking at TikTok and I hope the stock price discounts this as ""no deal"" as the company is solid with or without it. This does not need to be run up then beat down when the deal falls through as there are MANY legal and political challenges to it forthcoming."
"I do not have the tools to look at historic trading trends with sufficient detail. If anyone knows, how has MSFT generally traded after earnings?"
I sold my msft into dot com ...The biggest mistake ...Initial $11k investment would have been today $2.6 million.Invest for the long haul ..

I'm a long term holder so this isn't a bash.Would you guys think it's nearly impossible for this stock price to double as it would put the market cap at over 2T? Just trying to be realistic here. I really don't want to sell as I would have to pay gains on over 160K in profits but I'm starting to think this huge market cap has limits.
Why buy now? You can get it for 160 if you have patience.
made 289k yesterday. Sold nearly everything yesterday due to fears with AMZN I'll buy stuff back on Monday.
Remembered my reasons over the long weekend as to why I decided to invest in $MSFT years ago - Solid growth and undervalued. Both factors remain true even today even as the stock price has multiplied.
200 coming soon. I added yesterday. Don’t worry about the profit taking and let’s keeping eating.
$300 soon....
Morgan Stanley too conservative. We’re going to $150. Too many strong drivers going on with this powerful machine. Own it and forget it. Stock market royalty.
"Just buy 2,500 of Share at $110."

Market down MSFT up. Like this stock a lot. Holding long term.
"Smart investors expecting new highs for MSFT, AMD. Do your own DD and win big."
The reason other Cloud companies are getting more love then Microsoft is some people believe there isn't a lot of growth as some of it's competitors . Company is rock solid and if there's a down turn Microsoft is where you want to be . Being up 42% over 52 weeks is nothing to cry over. If you owned it for length of time you have done very well .
Forget the spin hype from #INTC. This is real from #AMD and #MSFT. If we live through this moment in time AMD will be the undisputed chip company.https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/fn6spd/amd_ryzen_zen_2_cpu_radeon_rx_navi_to_power/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Upgrades are nice
Algorithmic buying/selling has turned the market into a sleezy casino.
MSFT won the JEDI contact. There may be something here...wrote off MSFT long ago but they’ve seemed to find a growing niche.
$225 is a wonderful intermediate price point btw.
Reopening is going to sink Microsoft Azure.I am glad i dumped Microsoft for airlines stock last week......................................I work for a major service provider that runs circuits to Microsoft Azure's data centers. The peak is over and the decline has started.
"Every investor should be aware that the current ultra low interest rates imply higher p/e, especially for high end companies like MSFT, which is very dominant, carries a negative debt and still has room for growth. When you add that this is almost a virus proof stock, a current p/e of 30 doesn’t look crazy at all !"
Gates almost bankrupted MSFT ... Nadella hero saved it
Any price below $210 for MSFT is a pure gift from heaven
up up and away
My suspicion is that the investment banks have a lot of clients (cash) who wants Microsoft at a low price. Classic way of how they operate. I'm holding.
Wow! got upgraded before earning is like another Christmas after the new year. Let’s go!
MSFT CLEARLY will be trading much higher in the next year.They are undervalued compared to so many other that are at crazy numbers.in a way of rather see slow and steady which is how MSFT always deemed to roll
"Microsoft made a smart move to cut overhead by closing their retail stores . They’re Stepping up their well established gaming service while the gaming industry is exploding .... and as The entire world rapidly moves towards work at home, which will help businesses drastically cut overhead ,Microsoft is providing the service and leading the way ....totally totally bullish !!"
Is 241 a good price to get in for long term ?
Going to 212
Sell. 200 by Friday. Blood bath continues
I want to see Microsoft at 220 to 250 this month and by next month 300

Pushing higher and higher. Another all time high fellas¡¡¡ Awesome climb ¡¡¡
MSFT IS A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY at $ 134.00!!! I EXPECT EXCELLENT 2ND QUARTER EARNINGS IN JULY!!!
stock split looming read seeking alpha article
Robert- There's no reason why this should sell of in after hours or tomorrow. Analyst upgrades are days away... maybe even as soon as tomorrow.
"Today, after the market close reports MSFT, AMD, XLNX I'm expecting great news and new highs. .........Yahoo don't delete my postings"
New high ID so close I can taste. Great response from softie today
"Keep printing the money, increase the tax, destroy the riches, wage increase & high inflation. Businesses will prefer China and China is winner..they will flourish like Obama years! Mean while, demos. will throw record amount of people on freebies, welfare & food stamp and of course easy votes!!"
"My top two performer for over 4 years; Undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD. Satya Nadella & Lisa Su doing a great job transforming the digital world. Do your own DD and win big at the end of 2021 buy, buy, buy."
"IMO - AWS will loose their JEDI protest & all future Governmental Agency opportunities. They have insulted the Defense Department decision makers by their “sour grapes” false accusations of bid rigging. Also, a big portion of the 43 million security deposit will be charged to Amazon.This is what happens if you try and take over everything & let EGO cause real bad greedy decisions."
I hope all this volatility ends today and the shorts run out of money.
One more analyst upgrade to 200 we see 190 this week
buy more!
"MSFT is a great buy under $118.00, Undervalue AMD is a great buy under $35.00. Do your proper DD and win big in 2019"
150 today?? I know I say it all the time but I love Microsoft

Msft will see 240 soon
China-US near agreement. $MSFT to profit due to reduced piracy?!! Buy MSFT now!
"Wow , never thought Microsoft would drop this far in 2 days . What's the problem."
"volume is extremely low, and a lot large orders. Guessing people still feel Msft is too high therefore not buying in. Maybe the big boys are trying to push the price down a little to create more interest ?"
"This was an exceptional year for MSFT partly due to Covid, and due to the release of its latest Xbox. Don't expect a repeat performance as the economy normalizes and people return to offices. There's no Xbox coming out for another couple of years and PS5 also has tremendous appeal.MSFT also has to contend with the fact that its deal with the DoD may not materialize and maybe usurped by Amazon instead."
"As the economy reopens, this could be the start of several strong quarters for MSFT's commercial business - Evercore"
"Hello everyone,what do you think will be the impact of earning call at April 28?the stock will be decreased due the influence of COVID 19?"
"MSFT's earnings added 76 dollars to AMZN's stock pirce, AMZN's and GOOG's earnings knock 2.50 dollars off MSFT's stock price. Just out of curiosity, does anyone think we'll finish in the green today? I'm thinking that once we get past the initial shock of AMZN's earning's report, maybe the investor's with insight will see what a bargain MSFT is at these prices. If not today, maybe next week."
MSFT. Is a very solid stock I'll keep buying and holding for ever
"It's the 2nd stock I ever bought, way back in the late 80's or early 90's. It hasn't always been the most exciting stock in all that time but I did go through a couple of splits. I like it even more now and recently added to my position."
"Yawn,wake me up we have reached $100 +"
upgraded to 220
"Hey Democrats? Why not just take all the earnings to ""redistribute da wealth""? Congratulations, cheating ""Gimmie dats""."
Hoping sentiment changes tomorrow.
Leaders in AI. Nuff said.
Dead in the water. Time isn’t endless for investing. 6 months goes whoosh. Don’t want to hear “next month”.
"Target prices from the street got hiked, from mid 120s all the way up to 130."
"Is there any thinking of a stock split? Its been since 2003. I know with today's fractional buying, splits aren't as necessary but just look at AAPL or TESLA"

MSFT to 300 in 2021
$250 call - exp. mid Febbullish on the ER
Um...I afraid to look at the balance of my 401K tomorrow morning. This was painful.
This only adds $1bill a year over next 10 years. they make that in 2 weeks lol. So the $10 jump today everyone was hoping for wasn't warranted based on the numbers. however the opportunity to land future cloud contracts with other conservative gov and arms of gov is excited. will grow steady into 2020.
A lot of volume this morning
"Like Shakespeare said, much ado about nothing. MSFT was great before Tik Tok and will be great long after this deal is forgotten."
Correction is coming it will hit when everyone is counting there bank accounts
"Using all my cash available to buy first thing Monday morning. I’ll ride it out and collect the dividend, which on its own is better than a bond"
let me see--we beat the street by 10 cents a share and we are down--makes sense right?
Good entry point?
still rated a buy http://snip.ly/yqrxdx
Upgrades tomorrow
"my first purchase of MSFT was 1994, then 95 and 96, I hope its goes up some more."
"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that the hardware supply chain is coming back online as the coronavirus outbreak eases up in Asia, but said that the big question would be whether demand holds up in the U.S. and Europe.“On the supply side we are getting back on rails,” Nadella told CNBC’s Jon Fortt when asked about whether Microsoft would be able to deliver later this year certain products it had promised before COVID-19 took hold, like new Surface devices and a revamped Xbox gaming console.“We have a great balance sheet, we are a very diverse business, we have a mix of annuity, non-annuity, that is also stronger than even the last time we even went into the financial crisis,” he said. “I feel confident we’ll come out of this, frankly, pretty strong.”He said the company’s cloud infrastructure and services have been holding up under increased demand. —Jordan Novet"
no worries here if you know $msft. will pump to 120 before ER
"we could really use a good day here. I guess this is an understatement. I am not going to sell my shares over a couple of bad days. Stay strong,fellow longs"
Patience pays off. $120. soon -- very soon.
"Reminder again, sell sell INTC, NVDA and load MSFT and undervalued AMD. Do your own DD and win in 2019...…..in 4 days you'll find out disruptive innovative products that will drive AI to the next level no more old - antique technology with flaw and patches. Undervalued AMD and MSFT represent a good buy today."
I only have 28 shares but it's doing good.
Somebody call 911 MSFT is on fire!
TD101 if u hate msft so much then why are u here? Go gamble elsewhere this stock is for investors.
Bump in the road. Christmas is coming. Don’t worry so much. :-)
"All robinhood investors rushing to get in on FB, Tesla and Microsoft at all time high on “revised” estimates for Q1 which is barely affected by the virus. Looks like my 401k turned positive and it’s time to put them in bonds. #TSLA#MSFT#FB"
"On its way to 150! If it happens to drop, buy as many shares as possible!"
Should we see 110$ tomorrow??
MSFT is a slow mover. Just buy it and forget about it

Going to $240 tomorrow after earnings
Stellar!!
MarketWatch has just reported that the demand for Azure had made MSFT reach full capacity in Australia. They are exploring ways to satisfy demand. Tell me why this stock is not at $200 now. Google it . It's the news in the last 4 minutes.
I’ve seen this before no worries just hold and buy more if you can
Microsoft = Best of the MAGA stocks!
Hopefully this Amazon protest will go no where and we’ll see higher prices.
Dan Ives of Wedbush says Microsoft is a TWO TRILLION COMPANY by years end and he puts the odds of a Microsoft TikTok acquisition at 75 to 80%

"When can we expect a big jump on MSFT? just like AMZN, AAPL or FB?"
The Sleeping Giant is waking up.
So MSFT want to know the origin of every single document or picture taken to know where each one was originated. Imagine of Hitler had this technology??
How delicioso is this. And it will continue until the next ER. Great time to be in MSFT. What a wonderful feeling making money while I drink beer. :))
Should reach $250 by the EOW.
"""A man always has two reasons for what he does a good one, and the real one"""
Buy MSFT calls and shares. This will be over 116 by next Wednesday! And people say there is no free lunch?
"WHAT / WHY the drop??Technicals haven't changed, what's driving this DOWN??Intelligent comments welcome..."
"All the analysts suggest $280 and up. Yet the market says otherwise. While I remain long, I’m not lying when I say this stock has some unusual volatility to the down side when all the “pundits” suggest the opposite - which does give me pause. I’m liking the rally today (so far at least) but question its ability to establish a new floor and then move up."
Many people often post here with ridiculous price predictions or other silly comments. All one can do is laugh them off. I don’t understand why people take them so seriously and start directing abusive comments. Just laugh it off and move on.
New all-time high! Congrats to everyone that own this stock!
I dont think there is one stock in the market that isn't making anyone say ouch right now.... what a lousy downturn the s&p has taken this past week has been so harsh for longs. But the thing to remember is how fast frog can leap from 50- 70 and thats what we have to keep up hope for. Unless $APPL $TSLA $MSFT $AMZN and all our other big name stocks start moving this downer will continue. The great news is that these are all incredible companies and this red will not continue. All we can do is hold or buy some dips until the Market regains some regularity. If your reading this then It could always be worse. One thing I cannot allow myself to do is sell any of my precious stocks at a loss... Not with these diamond hands ......Ups and downs are apart of the game if we made it this far through this red storm then we can survive a bit more until it turns around in our favor and lets all hope it will be soon. Diamond hands all day every day !!!
"No one knows what's gonna happen to the stock market, but if it goes down big time, some strong company share are good to buy even at their current price, all these stock has potential to come to that price again sooner or later $AAPL, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG $V $WMT"
Can’t wait to see the upgrades on Monday.
MICROSOFT' BREAKING OUT ON 25% HIGHER VOLUME 155 PLUS NEXT WEEK ...TECH SPENDING ON CLOUD SERVICES TO REACH 266 BILLION 2020....160 CHRISTMAS .....POWER FORWARD
love this company because it has the BEST management team. management team will keep me in this stock long term. I've decided the most important thing in choosing a stock these days is the management team. at msft the team is bold yet measured. demands accountability from employees and is strategic long term. I'll buy more on the dips. keep up the good work!
Still holding 20K so patiently.
"Dow Futures are Green, if Dow reaches 29,500 MSFT hovers around 195"
"Wedbush Securities believes Microsoft stock (ticker: MSFT) is one of the best opportunities in the stock market.The firm’s analyst Daniel Ives reiterated his Outperform rating for Microsoft shares, citing the company’s exposure to the cloud computing market through its Azure business unit. He added the stock to the firm’s “Best Ideas” list.“We believe the shift to cloud is a major secular trend that is significantly benefiting MSFT in the field as a key tailwind,” he wrote on Monday. “Nadella & Co. are in the catbirds seat to get more of these complex workloads (e.g. AI, machine learning, etc.) as more enterprises take the leap to a hybrid cloud architecture over the coming years.”Microsoft stock was up 0.7% to $111.74 on Monday. Ives reaffirmed his $140 price target for Microsoft stock.Microsoft Azure sales grew at 76% year-over-year in its most recent quarter, Ives noted. He estimates about 30% of enterprise workloads are conducted on the cloud, which will rise to 55% by 2022, according to his forecast."

Topping is a process no ultimate $qqq bottom until apple hits 99 and $msft is a 12-15 pe again. Until $tsla is back to 100 which is really 400 presplit. Ev company or two like $ride will have to go bk too. All of this and spiking treasuries and a hate for tech will be in place. This could take months or years and eventually same thing happensnto the $dia as tons of overvalued cyclical stocks like $dis $de $cat are this high only due to money printing. Much better deals away from big caps IMO who can flip the bird to indices
MSFT is huge in blockchain technology in the cloud; could be next big thing powering the stock higher.

Will beat earnings number and rebound tomorrow. High margins on the Cloud income.
I don’t know why MS takes such a beating with an interest rate hike? Their business model is a subscription service which allows companies to get out of major capital expenditures and into operational. Capital outlay requires loans which get expensive as rates rise. Seems more business would be driven to MS in this environment. But I must be missing something... It’s not like companies can do without data.
down big after hours . why?
Microsoft has subscription services. Such as XML stylesheet which EVERY company uses. Microsoft owns LinkedIn which EVERY body uses. They have Minecraft. Would be a big loss to sellers of these shares and a huge win to for buyers. GG Microsoft!

The brilliant Kevin Mayer didn’t leave Disney, running their most high profile growth division, streaming, on a whim to run TikTok. He saw the tremendous potential with this company. Regardless how this plays out it has pushed Microsoft backinto the limelight. Vamos! "

I’m not convinced in this move up until Microsoft breaks above $230. This is still trading within the same range since August. Until we break above $230 we are not in breakout. That’s just the reality.
There is this thing called patience.
Microsoft will be 130 by the end of the year
Microsoft is well set for a stock split in 2021 hold long
"Markets are up after hours. If this JEDI Contract stall is stopped and Amazon has to pay Microsoft millions for this, the stock may soar."
I say just ban tiktok and let Microsoft or some other company develop a similar new and improved video sharing app. Why pay billions for something you can just re-invent. Problem solved!!!
"THANK YOU SATYA for all your hard work, brilliant leadership and knowledge of the trends in cloud computing and infrastructure that will ensure MSFT'S dominance for decades to come."

Great harbinger for 2021.
What the hell happened today? The stock goes up over 4% in per-market hours due to stellar earnings only to sell off and drop below pre-market lows! The more time I spend in the stock market the more I realize how unstable and irrational many traders are. What does the tension in the Gulf have anything to do with Microsoft's earnings?! Traders are emotional babies that freak out at any news report even if it's completely unrelated to the company they're buying. Good grief!
"They already have 7.57B of shares outstanding, and now filing for additional 1.27 million share of common stock makes one wonder if they are having hidden financial issues? It is a flag that raises a legitimate concern, and why there has been a big sell off of this stock for the past several days."

"Here’s a woulda, coulda, shoulda true story. My girlfriend at the time purchased 20 shares of MSFT the day after the IPO. I had never heard of it but she worked in the IT world so she had insight. I believe she spent around $650 for 20 shares. At the get go the stock performed well and soon split. A short while later we decided to marry. In an effort to clear debt before tying the knot, she sold her shares to pay off her car loan. Upon learning she did so, I was supportive of her becoming debt free but said we could have worked on the loan together without selling the stock. Fast forward 30 plus years of marriage, that 20 share purchase today would be 5760 shares worth roughly $1,180,800 paying $11,750 annual dividend. Now she’s has been invested in AMZN and APPL for a while and ... doesn’t have a car loan."
The market is just being silly now. Only momentum are catching bids. Guess large cap growth tech stocks are now value plays. Cra..

"Looking ahead, Microsoft's board of directors greenlighted a $40 billion share-repurchase program back on Sept. 20, 2016. According to the company's most recent quarterly filing, the company still had $25.6 billion left on that program as of Sept. 30, 2018 -- meaning that over the span of two years, it only bought back $14.4 billion worth of stock. I look forward to seeing if Microsoft steps up the pace of its buyback program in the coming quarters or if it's content with the more gradual approach that it's taking."
"MSFT, AMD still undervalued.......do your home work."

Microsoft is going to skyrocket. We will see 200+ before the end of next year. So better load up on shares and maybe calls.
MSFT is oversold. Even dipping below fair value now. Adding to my position at these levels.

"I am an ex-NASA engineer who last worked on the COBE mission.If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia. Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences. On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs. Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!"

Yes MSFT will move upward with new cloud business and Morgan Stanley's upgrade to $140 will drive it.

Microsoft not only won the JEDI contract but will be a magnate for corporations around the world to flock to the big M! ... I'm glad I kept hanging in there - I can't believe this news!
Microsoft's goal of being carbon negative by 2030 is another reason I'm proud to own an extremely tiny part of the company (and of course because it's a great company with a great future).

"Yahoo finance has a 12 month price target of $161.94? That's got to be a mistake, right? I'm thinking somewhere more in the $180 area."
"People have clearly missed one of the most significant news in a long time. Microsoft is teaming with Europe's four largest media-lobbying groups to help rework how news stories are monetized. If this goes forward, do people realize how significant the shift will be? Microsoft will once again become a household name — and in a positive way. Allow me to reiterate— Satya is the best CEO that Microsoft has ever had."
Past two quarters when earnings were released there is drop in share price. Let's hope it will big upside for upcoming earnings.
"Jon Najarian on CNBC today pumping Microsoft. He bought calls DURING THE SHOW, pumped them, then after the CNBC viewers jumped in and followed him, He starts dumping them for a tidy profit. Amazing that Wapner allows this on a regular basis, wonder how much he is being 'compensated' by Najarian"

With azure and Xbox services growing over 40 plus percent a year I think eventually Microsoft will be topping 20 plus percent revenue growth. Cloud is 38 percent of their revenue now and its just going to get bigger

"Microsoft Stock Benefits From Large BuybacksMark R. HakeInvestorPlaceSeptember 16, 2019, 9:40 AM GMT-5Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock has done very well this year, up almost 35% so far.

"WHY BUY SENS NOW!From Healthcare providers who implant Dexcom, Abbott and Eversensedaily.""I have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump.Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works."

"Wow, it just going on. In an article on the street from earlier this afternoon, Cramer gives away how desperate he is to promote Salesforce by speculating (baselessly, in my opinion) about Dell and HP loading Slack (a one trick pony acquired recently at a heavy premium by Salesforce) instead of the Microsoft applications? Is he out of his mind? What if Microsoft increases the Windows 10 licensing costs for HP and Dell in retaliation? What benefit will accrue to Dell and HP by lading Slack instead of Microsoft Software? Do Dell and HP have an alternative mass market operating system they can sell?Man, what kind of sore a loser is Cramer?! Instead of being impartial, why is he promoting one company’s products over the other?"

"after prior quarter's ER, MSFT actually dropped the next day by 2 or 3 points even after beating both top and bottom lines. Everyone was shocked. They said it was due to their high PE/ratio.

Buy and hold the stock. Options expire and this company’s chart shows a steady upward climb. ESG investors will continue to buy it especially the trillion dollar mutual funds like BlackRock ESGs commitment.
Going to start off red today but we will be green by end of the day
Thinking Microsoft is going to struggle to catch traction in the morning then be a steady rise all day. Wishful thinking.
"I'm sure everyone can see the icloud based system that is exploding along with significant govt contract awarded. MSFT with or without this tragic time worldwide, is and will continue to explode to high expectations and major profits."

buy chance .......woooow 137 is strong buy before earning .....down due to china issue ...great opportunity ...buy it buy it
MSFT needs to get a much higher multiple which will really drive the stock. It should be a multiple of the Cloud Kings. It can’t be evaluated by its legacy business anymore based on its Azure numbers. This stock van really rip amigos. The sky’s the limit. 
MSFT underpriced right now in my opinion. By Dec of this year will be around $250-$260 a share
Boom!
"Microsoft ain’t failing us today, might start off red but gonna end green"

The markets will be green tmrw based on stimulus. My expectation is that we retest 217 and possibly touch 220 with a re-trace and market close near 216.
Didn’t I tell you guys yesterday MSFT was going to pop after ADBE and COST earnings? Again $90 within two weeks!

The doctor went on to say that he had spoken to a Chinese doctor that this was done on 10 patients in China and all 10 of the patients recovered. This is what I heard on Lou Dobbs."
If TSLA can go from the 200's to the 900's in a month...MSFT can certainly go to the 200's soon!!
Microsoft promised it will not turn green even if Nasdaq goes up 1000 points

"Going by Benioff and Cramer’s desperation, I get the feeling that Microsoft’s Dynamics has begun eating Salesforce’s lunch. Next earnings might give us more insight."
Chipotle is over $1400. MSFT is very cheap. I am buying this for the long haul.
Price to sales is even higher than Apple. The price of the stock is too high!

wall street mggts trying to scare you out before earnings
Great day inauguration day and earnings early next week. Cloud growth and Office 365 are key components of an anticipated strong report.
"MSFT might not rise every trading day, but you can bet which direction it's headed."
"- Brokerage Wedbush expects Amazon and others to challenge this decision in the courts, but ultimately this is a paradigm changer for Microsoft- This deal adds at least $10/share to MSFT's stock and could have significant positive financial implications for the company over the coming years - Wedbush"
"Scary stuff here people. My MSN outlook had an add on my intray, about something I searched recently. We've all had ads based on viewing placed on internet pages. but Microsoft has taken my internet viewing, and told an advertiser who I am. They are doing that with all of you."
So much more room for growth..........
You can tell how little intrest their is in msft by how little post this board gets lol
Why good earning stock MSFT down after hour?
"Who would have ever thunk that a virus would bring out technology's strength - especially MSFT. There's no way you could have ever planned for it. Now, what I'm seeing, is MSFT making changes to it's products and services to make them better suited for a changed marketplace. I have very little doubt that these changes will be the right moves to keep the company growing well into the future. Someday, colleges will have a case study to show how a successful company adapts to its environment."
I wish everyone on this board would relax. Higher highs and higher lows. Microsoft is a safe investment. This is nothing compared to the volatility elsewhere. Have some intestinal fortitude and patience.
its going to 240I warned you
Amazing just how bad ballmer turned out to be relative to the recent management.
190 after cc
ok let's hear the good news.
Would you sleep at night if you were short this stock?
"In my humble opinion, the price of MSFT will drop as per chart with my interpretation. I think charts decide all market movements. Though treasury shut down, the stock prices increased. Now China s slow growth is just making a cause for downward movements of stocks. It's very obvious that charts justify the movements both upward and downward. News are inventing for justification for this movements after the action from the market. It's just a thought of mine."
"If I could only buy one stock, this would be it."
Beautiful all the indicators just to.mention aroon MAC stocastics momentum and an ascending triangule ....just utterly gorgeus stunning and darling
It usually pulls back at 185. So that’s what I’m expecting happens this time if not then well I’m done with stocks forever.

Even in a market correction this is a great long term hold. Who knows we may even get a special dividend this year.

"Yes, I'll stick with MSFT."
Time for a MSFT breakout coming up. Stock is poised for a big move upwards. Save this post.
"Might as well sell everything else and just buy MSFT. It is the stock God, hahah."
About 2 months ago closure of MSTF stores were in the news. Now the relationship between MSFT and Walmart deepens. Maybe MSFT will have some far less expensive retail space in some Walmart stores. This would be a good move in my humble opinion. What has now become a commodity item being sold in a commodity store.
"28 g to 17g in one day for playing call lol not worrying at all. will tripple, easy"

"Cloud storage is the new backbone of MSFT. There should be a continuous growth of this sector for the foreseeable future, imo."
A week from next Wednesday or Thursday may be a good time to start buying when the two weeks Nationwide lockdown are about over... If the curve starts to flatten out people will start buying ahead of the actual complete cleansing of the virus from the country.
good dip to buy
you can always tell on MSFT to deliver!
We're going to end this week strongly fellow longs. Congrats on not listening to the naysayers. Enjoy your weekend!
"$1T market cap tells you where the risk is, to the downside. Do the analysis of post-earnings move by market cap, large companies are skewed to the downside. The probability of -2% is much greater than +2% tonight."
When will fundamentals be rewarded in this market? Is this stock market or casino?
It will be another great green day...
Why wouldn’t MSFT follow the  play and split?
"Coming attractions: The big boys will start chiming in with downgrades to drive the price lower prior to their jumping back in. You know, the same ones that always tell everyone to stay the course at the beginning of the fiasco, so they can hit the exits first.."
MSFT will correct technical issues and recover quickly. Expect 10+ percent growth in 2021.

up 7 today. 111 close.
Guys I’m loosing a 1/3 of what I invested! Should I sell??
Is it a good idea to buy Microsoft shares today with a short term target of $100 to be reached by end of this week? It would be a 5% profit
"what was the reason for spike yesterday? there was no major institutional buyout, not even news catalyst? but then, u get multiple catalyst, lots of institution buys.. then the stocks just sits still. either way, MSFT is still undervalued, specially now they are the worlds hoarder of data. They have the resource, real estate, technology and even the government contracts. never ends... a worldwide Windows 10 upgrade should actually push this stock more, SQL earnings, azure etc... again. DATA mining, blockchain etc. so slow to get to $200"
So report is tomorrow after the bell. Should see nice pop near $235 my guess. Future move $260
"Just bought shares here. The charts for this stock are amazing. And, I am a holder, not a trader. I will probably post more often, as I get more familiar with the board and do some research on this stock. You folks definitely have a winner here!"

"MSFT is the gift that keeps on giving. $95.01 close on another GR8 qtr, top and bottom. See you @ $100"
frustrating. thought we would finally break hard through 243.. hopefully it stays here with no roll over. I am starting to wonder if larger players have been sliding out of the bigger names during these micro surges. I doubt it.

"The Jefferies analyst - Difucci - Has been persistently wrong on Microsoft, and people who have listened to him have either lost a ton of money or missed a terrific opportunity. The cloud opportunity for Azure is enormous, and they do not have to beat Amazon to prosper."
"MSFT is the most likely recipient of the JEDI Contract:I believe MSFT will beat out AMZN for the JEDI Contract, MSFT already has plenty of their systems running through the US Army, and most likely they are already using Azure for the basic office 360 stuff. To add to the this AMZN already has the CIA on their cloud, despite arguing which cloud service is better the DND would't want to have all their Eggs in one basket, Intelligence at one company and DND documents at another company spreads your information and reduces your risk of having everything compromised. Both companies have quality, but I would say Jeff Bezos phone being hacked by the Saudis is of concern to the Military, not that it has anything to do with AWS but it does plant a seed of doubt it the ability to protect private information if the tech guys at Amazon couldn't even protect their CEOs phone. Maybe a little too optimistic on it."
"Azure is hot, will take out 240 today. JMHO"
Day traders win on this stock everytime
up $1 more then we will see new all time high at 119 to 121. marked my words on this
This better break out strong after earnings. MSFT has done terrible compared to TSLA or AAPL!
It's still not to late to get in... Now is the time.. Nothing but UP UP UP Go long

Got in at today’s low. Options take me tooo da moon.

Great move here for MSFT. Mu going to pop up also.
"Aapl, amzn, fb and googl, to mention just a few, all up more than 3 1/2 percent. What’s Msft been doing so far today?"
Stock is weirdly climbing back in Pre market. Hopefully continues
Approaching up 80% in a year and a half! Let’s keep it going!
"I understand how these tech companies have the right models for a post covid world but if the rest of the economy is going into a depression or bad recession how is that going to increase sales for these tech companies? You have entire industries that might go completely away. Sure right now it looks good but six months from now after many big firms have defaulted will they be advertising on FB and GOOG, buying from MSFT and AMZN? Households are bored now but six months from now will they be subscribing to Netflix when they are in default? These are questions that are not being addressed by this market."
tapping $216 multiple times is a strong sign... creating steady baseline.... i rather have this than parabolic upward then drop.
AMZN wanted to combine the government system with their already existing secure service. Microsoft is building an independent secure system just for the government. What do you think is more secure?
"Pandemic helped cloud business, as people work remotely. Good report. Good CEO. Stock is 5 points off the aftermarket high at this point though. People are taking their profits."

"What Microsoft really needs to do to accelerate its growth rate and strengthen its technology leadership in the entire tech sector is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Microsoft (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Microsoft just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

"The judge was not taking this lightly, adding that Amazon would have to put up $42 million bond to cover costs should it prove that the motion was filed wrongfully."
This is the ONLY major tech company worth buying right now. The only one with solid beats all around! $130 by EOY = 1 trillion market cap.
Microsoft is owning it. Stay tuned
OCTOBER WILL BE A VERY GOOD MONTH FOR MICROSOFT AND THE OVERALL US STOCK MARKET..
Too late to buy MSFT in your opinion? Want to buy in
125 by Monday!
"@ChristopherIt doesn't look like it's going to hit your $212 price target... Don't get discouraged! You were only off by about $20. Better luck next Friday.Stay strong! Keep shorting! If you run out of cash, use margins!!"
Facebook losses were less then Microsoft profit beats sell sell sell !!Its funny what some Analysts will have you believe.
"they will beat expectation get in its a really good price now , msft 800 billions will lift the market up shortly"

"THIS IS A HUGE GIFT to be able to still be able buy MSFT WELL BELOW $250. Should see $260-$270 after earnings,"
It's pushing to $160!
It's all about the Benjamin's and MSFT has provided me with a nice amount through the years. Love this stock.
"The big payday, feb 19th divident is coming up soon.MSFT will bounce back to 190 plus."
This wil go green. Pre-market down 1% is just the spread between bid&ask for options and accelerators.
Go MSFT..take it to the limit!
"No one will be able to contest the Pentagon award to Microsoft (over Amazon).Regardless of how they feel politically Microsoft (Like Apple) has done an excellent job of working WITH the present administration, whereas Amazon has been too ‘out there’ about how they feel politically. As a shareholder of both Microsoft and Apple I am so happy that both leaders put shareholders above their political feelings! THAT is how you do it!Congratulations!"

Accelerated digital transformation of the world will continue drastically in 2021. Microsoft to 2T cap
"Here is a little math for MSFT enthusiasts out there!MSFT re-rates to a PE of 40 Google closed over that today and amazon is more than double that! Gross margins greater than 67% this past quarter and Piper Sandler in Barrons prognasticating 300 Billion in cloud by 2030. No US or EU government pressure unlike AMZN, FB, GOOG, and AAPL Apple is growing slower than MSFT and is facing apple store monopoly charges and they will lose. FB has huge govenrment risk and a changing landscape with IOS changes reducing ability for FB to track user interests and making it more difficult to create as targeted ads to IOS users as in the past. JEDI project is 10 billion over 10 years. 1 Billion 250 million per quarter a year a useless headline nothing more! Not relevant to a company that earns 40 + billion per quarter.2021 full year earnings of $6.71 currently x PE of 40 = $268.40 todays value!!!full year 2021 low anaylyst estimates $7.10 x PE of 40 = $284 low end of year estimatefull year 2021 Avg. $7.39 x PE of 40 = 295.60 Avg. end of year estimate.full year 2021 High end $7.73 x PE of 40 = 309.20 High end of year estimate.Math lesson over!!!"
Mizuho starts MSFT at BUY rating as of today.

Crashing!!
"One thing that I check when buying ETF: ""Does it include or developed a relationship with Microsoft?"" ATH today!"
MSFT on sale! I'm buying more.
I think it will easily go over $140 today and won't be looking back!
let's gooo MSFT! hopefully the price will start reflecting the great q1 earnings.
Does anyone have any theory on why the NASDAQ went up today but MSFT went down?
"this is just temporary, MSFT won JEDI fair and square. In own both position so it is a win for me either way."
"If I could, I would buy a msft share daily no matter what the cost is"
"$110 is the top for tomorrow unless guidance is unreal, hard to ask for much more. Next week should be a whole green week though. Microsoft could start another tech rally which is good for everyone."
I’ll hold this few extra days. Should see $255-$265 easily.
"Sell, overvalued INTC with outdated old antique products with patches, sell overvalued NVDA and buy, buy, buy MSFT...……….. do your own DD and win in 2019."

"Hey Guys Never Sell your Shares, before the end this year MSFT will up to $325.00 for sure!!!"
I love you Microsoft
115 by end of this week. Free lunch!
I predict msft will gain $1 tomorrow.
Might see a gradual rise until earnings two weeks away.
"Todays action was fantastic, although it had little to do with Pinterest and more to do with the $MSFT takeover talks (in my opinion) The weekly chart is beginning to get extended. At some point in the not to distant future, we could see a decline down to $76. The over all uptrend would remain intact, and we would alleviate the extended price. Trade green on Friday my friends [_] cheers ]_]"
AMD singlehandedly making owning a PC exciting again. I would also go as to say to look into $TSM (manufacturer) and $MSFT (Windows / Xbox) as other possible good investments in the near future to long term

Everything is ETF nowadays. And trade talk hurts technology ETFs. Microsoft on its own is a great stock to own even in the midst of bad trade talk info.
the near side of the moon is Microsoft's advantage.
MSFT is my long term investment. Always safe
$140 for the first time imminent.
I will be holding tight
Msft has secured the deal as per inside news
Do I hear a $250 upgrade now?
Amazon will NEVER get a piece of the $10B Pentagon cloud computing contract. Trump HATES Bezos. This is a lock for Microsoft!
its funny how many people thinking it should be up more don't realize CC hasn't started yet
A breakout is coming and coming soon. I can feel it in my water. My dogs can feel it too. $190 must fall!
"I wish they would ban hedge funds from stocks they buy and as soon as regular folks buy they sell which makes regular folks sell thinking they will lose their principal. Do not sell when the hedge funds sell off all their shares, it is a trick so that they buy low."
"We are likely to see a very positive earnings report tomorrow, GLTA"
Red market but this ain't stopping MSFT!
It keeps consolidating at 241 what’s it going to take to push it past that.
I buy under $100
Best stock to own in my opinion .. goes a bit under the radar compared to the other big tech names but their o365 and emerging cloud business Azure will help Microsoft reach higher highs
"This market doesn’t make sense to me.- $AAPL, whose significant source of revenue is hardware, has a higher PE than $MSFT, which is increasingly capturing market share in the Cloud business.- $AMZN has a significantly higher PE than $MSFT despite having a significant retail business.- $CRM has a significantly higher PE than $MSFT despite increasingly diluting equity capital to make new acquisitions.IMO, Apple, Amazon and Salesforce are dangerously overpriced and Microsoft is slightly underpriced. However, their stock prices tell a different story."
going to 106?
I only bought 100 shares at $179 :( I wish I bought more.
This stock is driving me crazy. I buy it and hold it then doesn’t move and as soon as I sell it here we go
$MSFT is trading lower today than it was trading on 1/4. The rest of the market seems to be getting far ahead. I don’t see motivation for holding on to it any longer. I really don’t.
Just shaking out the weaklings. Gotta love picking up on discount.
"Why zoom in just for this month?? Microsoft is a great company completely dominating PC operating systems all companies uses. Not to mention the office suites. Plus the growth of one drive, cloud and Skype for business has further growth."
"MSFT, the stock that offers higher lows and higher highs. What's not to like?"
116 by end of next week! No worries about that :-)!
WHAT IS DRIVING MSFT HIGHER?.....MORE THAN AZURE I BELIEVE........150 AS EARLY AS NEXT WEEK...
"Capt. lisa Su,I wouldn't worry about the JEDI contract - MSFT is going up regardless!"
"MF says MSFT is the better tech buy over HP.. Microsoft is an incredible company with a diverse business portfolio. HP is also a leader in its fields, although the ones it plays in aren't as fast-growing -- nor, arguably, as exciting -- as Microsoft's key arenas. With that being said, HP offers a fatter dividend than Microsoft does, and my view is that sentiment around Microsoft continues to be very favorable, while the market seems to be quite down on HP after its most recent earnings results. This could mean that although Microsoft is arguably the better business, HP could potentially provide better stock returns than Microsoft over the medium term if, say, Microsoft hits a speed bump and HP manages to deliver a nice recovery from here. However, if I were to choose one of these two stocks to buy and hold for the next couple of decades, I'd have to give the nod to Microsoft."
Let’s see if 135 holds....
"I don't understand what you guys want; this stock has had an awesome, steady rise to the upside over the last year. It will continue to do so as Nadella continues to shift MSFT towards being a huge, profitable, Cloud/AI player. Just sit back and enjoy the slow, steady gains and dividend to boot!"
"All this talk by the talking heads about frothy tech valuations and comparisons with the 2000 tech bubble is so ridiculous and overplayed. Companies like Microsoft and few others don’t have frothy valuations. The upside to the cloud growth hasn’t even been defined yet. In other words, it is possible that we experience strong growth year after year for several years and we may still not know where the top is.A more appropriate comparison with the 2000 tech bubble would be EVs / battery makers. There are obviously strong players like $TSLA who have a deservedly rich valuation, but there are also so many companies who don’t have any products in the market and may not have them for several more years. Then there are companies who aren’t even planning to own means of production and have partnerships with other manufacturers to make the cars and sell under their brand. Sorry, but this is not a simple phone or French fries. Owning the factories are critical to success, IMO. And it is these EV / battery stocks that are trading at such rich valuation that I think has already reached bubble levels.TL;DR - Microsoft is not like other big tech and possibly has years and years of high growth in the cloud space. I don’t see any froth in its valuation. OTOH, I’d be very wary of investing in EV / battery stocks, especially ones that aren’t producing / selling vehicles in 2021 or beyond.All that said, I’m still quite bearish on $MSFT because I believe that the talking heads are influencing the investors and keeping them from an otherwise attractive company like Microsoft."
Why does inflation affect only the tech companies like MSFT and Apple?? Is inflation good for every other sector?
made 27% in one day on the 240 calls (should’ve held earlier today but got off). Now onto AAPL
Ives and team lift their price target on MSFT to $195 from $185 and set a bull case valuation on MSFT of $210 vs. the average sell-side PT of $165.79. Shares of Microsoft traded at a new high of $160.80 yesterday.

"I have looked at cloud storage from both sides now and have been adding MSFT shares since September, still a great time to buy & hold long term. From Goldman analysts, “Microsoft is well positioned to double its $60 billion-plus commercial cloud business into a $120 billion to $140 billion business longer term.” Good luck & great investing!"
Unbelievably steady equity. What great price action.

I'm very happy with my undervalued MSFT & Undervalued AMD. You can't find a better greener pastures with companies that don't represent the future value. Do your own DD and ignore those paid analysts that tells you to sell your undervalued stocks...…..
Oh my stock. I won't support Amazon anymore

"Nobody likes to see the destruction of our fellow man, but shorts have had years now to learn from their mistakes. The shorts here, $snap and $msft have nobody but themselves to blame - they chose not to learn and evolve.Continued best to all longs."
"MSFT will shortly be evaluated as a growth stock with a much higher multiple. It’s legacy business is not where this stock is positioned anymore. Cloud, AI, Gaming is the future of MSFT. This price will look ridiculously cheap over the next few years. Arguably as sure a bet as there is in the stock market today. Nothing is guaranteed but it’s as close as it gets. IMHO"
It's a beat - $1.13/share
I only have 2 stocks - LMT and MSFT
Microsoft has nearly solidied $4 per share in earnings .. what does this all mean? We can use a cutting edge study called the price to earnings ratio to safely assume a valuation of $476 per share or a 125 p/e roughly. This type of p/e is reserved for companies that expect modest long term growth. If it can become a true growth llay we can see upwards of 200 p/e easily
Trump says MSFT was already working the deal when they contacted him
"I have both MSFT and AMZN, routing for both cloud kings!!!"

How this hasn’t made a new high since earnings baffles me?
go Microsoft your making boat loads of cash why don't you raise your dividend?
The worst part about all of this is when you step back and look nothing really happened yet Microsoft drops $6 In a few days. I do still believe though Microsoft knows TikTok is playing hard to get and wants $$$ yet no one can afford it. Ultimately we'll buy tiktok and at a cheaper price - tiktok isnt think straight. Sentiment should be good right now for Microsoft
Does not bode well for Amazon to do what they did in the face of JEDI not having been settled
One trillion market cap by end of the year. MSFT will get to the finish line first before AAPL does.
$115 is so close I can taste it
"No biggie here with TikTok. JEDI contract reaffirmed earlier this month, so we’re all good."
Impatience is costly in the stock market. GOOG dropped 60 in one day and recovered that and added more in two days. Beware!
I’m long here but what a beating recently $MSFT $PDD $WIMI $BA
as much as these numberse are panicking me im still trying not to think about it cause Im hoping my investment pays off in a few years from now
MSFT will follow AAPL upward along with CSCO leading tech rally..

No reason to buy. Still got 4 yrs of Biden’s recession ahead.
man if this were to finish green in a down market I would be so hyped like my goodness how I love Microsoft!!!
"I’m saying this now, if Trump screws up this deal between Microsoft and TikTok then he has lost my vote and yes, I voted for him in 2016. If there are GUARANTEES that TikTok will not be a security threat and 100% owned by Microsoft then the only reason Trump would reject the deal is his own personal petty grudge.We will see. I’m still hoping for the best outcome "

a no worry stock. going long see you at 200.00
"Valuing Microsoft Stock The number one tech giant.Some people may be turned off by Microsoft — which is quietly holding the top spot as the most valuable publicly traded company — because of its seemingly high valuation. But I don’t think that should be the case. The company is incredibly consistent and has several additional assets that warrant a premium.First, analysts expect double-digit sales growth for the rest of this year and next year. Estimates call for 12.4% growth this year and 10.4% in 2020. The same can be said for earnings growth, with estimates calling for 14.2% growth and 12.6% growth this year and next, respectively.Based purely on the growth, some might argue that MSFT stock is not worth 25 times this year’s earnings. But then you consider the fact Microsoft has beat earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters. Or the fact that it has $127.6 billion in short-term cash and investments vs. just $4.9 billion in short-term debt. Or that its total current assets outweigh total current liabilities $156.8 billion to $50.3 billion. Then, one realizes just how powerful this company is from a balance sheet perspective.While free cash flow has stagnated over the last 12 months, the trailing 12 months of operating cash flow (OCF) has solid growth. Up about 10% over the past year, MSFT has more than $46 billion in trailing OCF. That figure is up almost 45% over the past three years.Microsoft has become a cash-flow giant with a massive balance sheet and solid growth. Plus, it’s not afraid of M&A. This tech titan will be around for a while and deserves its blue-chip premium."
Pre market MSFT slightly down a bit of profit taking going on which is not a bad thing... Market needs to breathe however having said that wouldn't be surprised if we'll should pick up today and in a couple of weeks be hitting
Huge beat!
Any links to goldman $285 price point? Cant find it for life of me! Thank you

What $PINS at $70 means: 4Q blowout report and 1Q upside guide never happened; and the $MSFT buyout report never happened. The stock now trades below it's pre-earnings and pre $MSFT-acquisition rumor. One of my top picks long-term.

Another big day for MSFT as premarket is showing. Let’s break $100 this week.
The legal action Bezos has taken is not the act of a confident sector-dominant corporation. More than anything else Amazon is signaling than Microsoft is winning the battle for cloud supremacy. Invest accordingly.
Today’s movement is an example of why timing the market is so difficult.
Everyone using Microsoft Teams!
Viva sounds like a good tool to use with Teams. Hope the user experience is tops!
Thinking to add MSFT on weakness.
if my projections are accurate buyers should rush in at the end of day and buy.
This stock should of be at 230 already.

I am guessing a lot of people are jumping on from apple?

"Typical pump before earnings.What is happening is that people are buying 10% OTM options just the have upside potential on earnings. Market makers need to cover the short of calls by buying the underlying. Once reports are out, the fun begins. If the market is not happy and there is no buying interest from the market, market makers needs to dump to limit their long exposure. If the calls are in the money and people want to buy, this thing will go another 5/10% up. Look at Netflix for similarities. I'm curious for the results"
SWEET!!!! it's significantly down! Looks like I'm buying more today

P/E still in the 23 range based on a $4.50/year. Not cheap but much better than most S&P 500 growing at that rate.
"MSFT is a $2T company coming fast. ""The long-term bull thesis on Microsoft stock remains compelling, even amid recent market headwinds.As stated earlier, Microsoft’s core cloud businesses are supported by non-cyclical cloud adoption tailwinds. These tailwinds may slow somewhat in the face of global economic uncertainty. Or they may accelerate, as enterprises look to cut costs as times get tough. But these tailwinds won’t die. Only 20% of enterprise workloads are in the cloud today. Over time, that number will rise towards 100%. Thus, MSFT can easily sustain double-digit-percentage revenue growth for the next several years.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-microsoft-stock-relatively-safe-141942276.html"
MSFT should be declaring a dividend increase any day now. I wonder how much per quarter they'll increase it.
Love the small bounce...but this market today feels like it’s looking for any reason or opportunity to sell off. I see very little conviction buying. Muted. Still large blocks getting sold which is why the Down ticks are so much larger than the upticks.
Dang! headed for 180B in revenue for the year. That's 100B more than 2010.

If Microsoft wins the defense contract it will rise to $125 overnight - coming up soon!
people relax
"“In this report, we do not draw a conclusion regarding whether the DoD appropriately awarded the JEDI Cloud contract to Microsoft rather than Amazon Web Services. We did not assess the merits of the contractors’ proposals or DoD’s technical or price evaluations; rather we reviewed the source selection process and determined that it was in compliance with applicable statutes, policies, and the evaluation process described in the Request for Proposals.”"

"Msft to buy TikTok for 5B , deal should be finalized by September 15th"
India has banned the use of Tic Tok in their market. Interesting if MSFT was to acquire Tic Tok do you forsee India allowing this app back into their country? Nadella is aware of India's vast market potential and I am sure if he is going to pay a huge amount for this app that he has already checked with the Indian government.
Possible tiktok to announce before the bell on Monday. This will setup a M&A Bulll market

"Why is every ""popular"" stock falling at the same time? example: netflix, nvidia, apple, microsoft, twitter, intel"
Let's be real the only reason why this was down was because of concerns with the fed making the whole market volatile and also msft was due for a small down day before a big up day. They have had an amazing quarter and an amazing year so far. I see nothing but good things. Dont let people make you fear your investment decisions. Stick with the analysis you trust not a guy saying it will go up or down. Good Luck to all tomorrow. The beauty about investing is that anything can happen.
I’m thinkin the people moaning about the price dips are traders not investors. Change my mind
does anyone think that this is a good time to buy back into msft? Thank you

Microsoft Rides Cloud to $1 Trillion Market Cap
"I wish these *""!#@# analysts would stop saying MSFT has run up too much. It's up 22 bucks from pre covid highs. Thats penniws compared to other tech companies."

MSFT is racing and surpassing CRM right now!
"Earnings Wednesday, MSFT is a power house can't wait to see where she'll land in 5-10 years from now. Its a stock that you hold and never sell, its my best performing retirement fund. Gl to alk longs."

MSFT: great prospects for 2021: all onboard!
"Microsoft is perhaps one of only global companies that cannot be supplanted (However, It can't own the cloud?). It has such a prominant-structurally-entrenched-broad-user-base. It's like a transcontinental railroad, with tracks laid everywhere. The stock price is certainly subject to volatility. Nothing goes straight up. I'm still bullish in the long term."
"okay Longs, maybe I am over excited on this one, but do you think we could see 225 post-earnings?"
I spent 6 months DCA into MSFT knowing it would eventually go up. Completely ignoring tesla. Thinking it was “overpriced”.￼After an amazing earnings report the stock is only up $4 per share?!?!I should have put all that money into TSLA!
"Among the froth,msft stands out a solid but highly under appreciated company.technically,as IBD points out it has cleared a buy point...massive accumulation with quick ang progressively sustained uproar..150 by November"
Time for the Funds to come home to Mama. MSFT is the safe place to be. Expect to see huge gains from here on to New Years. THE place you want to be and stock to own. Congrats!
I would think  their dividend would be higher?
It will trade under $205 this week. mutual funds are better than this stock.
"just hurry up and go down to comfort zone of 210 then up again then back to 210......waste of time.I suggest buy and ignore for 1 year and then take a look, may have gone up a buck or 2......dont expect excitement or thrills"

Cramer saying on CNBC that MSFT can steal TikTok and it will be a home run. I obviously concur. Fantastic opportunity. 
"MSFT and AAPL are core holdings, you don't trade these two."
Better than expected and a great outlook ......a must have ....if the numbers are analyzed the stock price will surge
"Good! Ydays selling action took away MSFT’s AH gains it should’ve kept, let’s keep the momentum going to where we belong!"
What I’m trying to figure out is who are losers that are still buying OVERPRICED shares of $TSLA and $NIO  All the action is at GM. Bringing $MSFT on board as a partner in autonomous vehicles gives GM a MASSIVE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE 
this will pull up by noon
If the TikTok deal falls through for MSFT you're potentially looking at a share price of well over $500 by next year... or a possible 2-for-1 split coming...
Will it goes up to 230 ?

"potential squeeze ahead. MSFT is undervalued compared to it's peers and with a diverse group of revenue streams, it's poised to beat earnings. The lows are getting higher and has recently broken resistance. With a good ER (likely) I'm setting my target price at $245, but I think it could go higher. Thoughts?"
"Remember my friends you buy undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD when is down. Do your own homework and enjoy traveling in greener pastures......…......"
"If you were reading my earlier posts, I was telling you that every time I've jumped into MS, I've lost. Well, zinged again! Earnings were not a major dissapointment at all, but there she goes. Looking for the earnings call to bolster this up a bit. With the Fed's comments today and beating by .01, I'd have expected the very slight rev miss to be a non-issue. But expectations are apparently higher.Good conference call and I say we're up by end of day tomorrow. People digesting this as really bad news when in actuality, considering the sector, this isn't bad at all."

"Amazons cash cow is cloud and the ecommerce is less than 20 % of its overall business. MSFT is a global giant with windows, tablets, PCs and billions in cash stashed. And now that azure is eating up amazon web services for good, there is a good chance MSFT is going to be the best of 2018. 80 dollar vs 1200 dollar amazon and both are competing on cloud. Buy MSFT"

$260 tomorrow
MSFT should be up $2.00 into green . All good news EVERY day. AAPL earnings are scary stagnant and dropping and it is still up $1.08 today(I would not touch AAPL right now. MSFT has multiple new cloud contracts every week and is far more diversified than AAPL.

"SignalsOnly positive signals in the chart today. Microsoft Corporation holds a sales signal from the short-term moving average; at the same time, however, there is a buy signal from the long-term average. Since the short-term average is above the long-term average there is a general buy signal in the stock. On further gains, the stock will meet resistance from the short-term moving average at approximately $107.89"

Nice. Time to sell and reload after all the profit taking is over!
microsoft has so much cash and very little debt makes a great investment over time!!!
My guess is it will go down initially after the report but rally and close up $4. $110 or so it will open tomorrow.
... I'm not waiting for earnings - peanuts! The real money will be in the JEDI and it's right around the corner.

"Microsoft Corporation has broken the weak rising the short-term trend up and an even stronger rising rate is indicated. For any reaction back there will now be support on the roof on the current trend broken at $142.31, a level that may pose a second chance to hit a runner. According to fan-theory $149.70 will be the next possible trend-top level and thereby pose a resistance level which may not be broken at the first attempt."

"MSFT has been a winner for me. And TikTok is tempting. But...There are 138 Communist Party members in the ByteDance branch of Chicom from a partial list obtained by another website. TikTok is owned by ByteDance. The individuals are all in important management and technology. How many are in the US TikTok? There are also lists for other B subsidiaries like BuzzVideo, Vigo, TopBuzz. Basically Chicom imbeds a branch into companies, whether private or state owned. The process accelerated under Xi. Process at TikTok was announced in 2014.So I'm curious as a stockholder how msft management is going to address this one. Are you going to take their word scouts honor? This is the time to look. "
Markets don't look like they care about great results now
MSFT is always a good buy from groundbreaking windows to the azure cloud.
"Valuations of tech companies are going down because of increasing intrest rates (because the present value of the terminal valuation of the discounted cash flows account for the biggest part of the valuation)? First, this applies mainly for tech companies with cashdrains, which MSFT is not. Secondly, if it applies for MSFT, an increase of 100bps of 10yr Bond, implies a valuation impact of roughly -3%. Next month we'll be talking about why we missed this buying opportinity."
Backup the truck. 145 to 150 tomorrow.
be 120 year end
What’s the forward guidance for next quarter?
Don't worry about the SP right now. MSFT never pops on earnings. Upgrades will take us higher into the next quarter.
It’ll be back up next week. Maybe even a little more tomorrow. People shifting their money around due to earnings
"When I bought MSFT for the first time in the $20's I was on diet for a long time. Now, I can eat."
Yes delete the truth

Don’t understand but it will go back up
Joe Teranova likes MSFT long term. Anyone sanguine with that?
Relax This stock is a winner It's up for the year It will fall off maybe a buck at the most and after earnings it will be up to 97 or more . Yes this is my guess but if it reports over .90 cents a share it will happen .if it reports over .95 cents a share say hello to $100.00
lets go msft
not sure much will slow this critical mass today. still think closes above 110. or at least it should

Some say Microsoft becomes a high-flyer in 2018. That would be swell. My first Microsoft Buy was when Pong was the new video game. Microsoft was a small but promising company then. I bought Intel at the same time. They had these “chips” that some thought that these new computers would use. It was fun watching these stocks run up and split ever 18 months. They were “high-flyers”. :-)
thank you Jefferies!!!! job well done creating a great entry point for the next leg up
Guys I’m so scare :( This was my first investment and I’m down like crazy! What should I do? :(Should I sell ?
"Smart investors should buy more undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD, do your own homework and win big."
How are people determining if a stock is oversold under considering the pandemic? It does not seem we're at the end of this and it's affecting all stocks regardless of how great the company is.My portfolio has taken a beating over the years with 9/11 and the depression. I always held and really tired of my portfolio dropping 20% in a few weeks and then having to wait a year ore more for it to return. Thinking about selling Monday because I don't think this downfall is over with and would rather take a little profit and buy back lower than sink with the ship and wait FOREVER for it to return to where it was.
Explosion after hours. Tomorrow will have a slight pull back. And then tomorrow afternoon will regain and have a new foothold at $240

How delicious to be a MSFT Long and just continuing to stockpile money over the years with this gem. Just buy/hold/add........ repeat. The way to wealth. :))
Did you receive your dividends?
"Overvalued stock NVDA $240.86 vs Undervalued MSFT $98.63, AMD $15.31...……."
Microsoft is stagnant for a while and undervalued !!But $240 is certainly possible in short term
According to the articles I have been reading U.S. Technology exposure to the China market is bare minimum specially the Software Sector. Within the software sector they referred to MSFT as barely having an problem with tariffs. So Software and MSFT are great buying opportunity for an average investor.
"MSFT is good, and in good hands! Fund managers who missed the Christmas-January ride are TALKING and want to TAKE the Market Down; Every fundamental is phenomenal, very positive! So the Mantra is ASK-SEEK-RECEIVE; say MSFT will be UP and beyond 110 ….. and see it happen!"
New Highs Today!!!!
Remember mutual funds rebalanced and bought a bunch yesterday and drove the price up but big picture is long run it’s suppose provide great returns to fund managers so have HOPE and don’t panic sell buy buy on these dips .
SPY is turning more strong green so does MSFT.... People thought it will be a red day but its a green one lol... Buy more calls......
"Microsoft price target raised to $185 from $160 at Jefferies Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating on Microsoft, and raised his price target on shares to $185 from $160. He called the company one of his top picks in Large Cap Software, noting the company had ""excellent visibility and a clear line of sight into double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future."""
Such a massive growth for such a giant company is awesome. The best part being that they are not concerned at all by antitrust investigation nor by censorship issues.
"This AM I had great ""fun"" with that early selloff...got on board at $234 for a quick (10 minutes) $5.00 ride up to $239I would have gotten in earlier (bottomed at 230.74), but Etrade servers were so clogged up with people trying to log in that I got delayed for about 2 minutes. (fastest >$10k I have ever made!)."
My biggest holding long term and short term beauty
"Are shareholders #$%$? Why down? Microsoft (MSFT) announced its Q3 2018 financial results on Thursday, and they beat expectations.The tech giant posted earnings of $0.95 per share on $26.8 billion of revenue. Those results beat analyst expectations of $0.85 per share on $25.78 billion revenue.The stock is slightly lower in after-hours trading.Microsoft?s intelligent cloud division saw revenue of $7.9 billion, an increase of 17%. Helping to push the segment higher were a 20% increase in server product and cloud services revenue and a 93% increase in Azure revenue growth.Personal computing segment revenue grew 13% with Windows OEM revenue growing by 4%. Xbox gaming revenue grew by 24% thanks to third-party games titles."
Easiest 10% you’ll ever make from here. 24hrs
"Guys, whats your opinion about tomorrow? Whats the expectation?"
"This is painful, my portfolio has been wiped 25% in a matter of a couple weeks with great stocks. Hoping for a better day on Monday, Longs. We will recover , buy when the market is fearful ! $APPL $TSLA $AVGO $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA $PYPL $SQ $BABA"
This will end up being a large boon for MSFT stock. Kind of glad judge issued the order during trading hours instead of after trading day.
I’d like one intelligent response from someone who can say weather tic tock Is really a good investment for msft? You read reports that are positive and some that are negative on acquiring tic tock. One article stated that msft could just be lining themselves up for nothing but headaches if they do buy tic tock. Appreciate any intelligent comments.
"MSFT is being held down by technical indicators. Draw a line from the peak and follow the descending peaks created by the October sell off (today is $106.5). The reason the rest of the market is green is because they were hurt a lot more than MSFT over the past month and are nowhere close to their trend line peaks. Apple is doing the best because their current ceiling is the 50 DMA. In a stock world governed by computers, technical indicators have a say when markets have stalled out. A tweet or two by the POTUS about China isn't enough to raise volume to the upside yet. At least not in the eyes of MM."
This is a rare opportunity!

Through in geopolitics, trade wars and the nov 6 elections you get nasdaq to 20-25% down easily"
Glad i got more calls yesterday. This has been a very solid run
The stock market is wishing everyone a happy new year

"I've owned MSFT since 2010. It always does this since even after Nadella took over. They meet or exceed expectations on earnings. Price drops for 2-3 weeks and one month later it starts to take off and about 3-4 weeks prior to earnings it plateaus. It obviously won't take off like the past 3 months while Coronavirus is here but even if it drops, if you are a long, in about 2 years this will hit $300+."

"All in all the whole of markets are over bloated with especially much liquidity in and in dangerous territories, over priced and no longer going on price per share earnings fundamentals,most whole of markets are going on popular favoritism based market shares,most fund managers and people are not doing there DD or home work and keep advising people to keep investing in a over illed priced dangerous market, hence just waiting to collapse,there is signs of a terrible market crash on the looming horrizon.The trouble with those signs is that while they are very obvious with the benefit of hindsight, they aren’t so easy to see in real time.In 1929, JFK’s father Joseph Kennedy Sr. picked up on one of those subtle signs and didn’t just get out at the top, he scored a massive windfall on the way down as well,yes he was one of those few who did not loose all his money back in the devastating 1929`s horrible crash,how did he know you ask..by sitting in a shoe shine chair having his shoes shined ...and yes it was the shoe shine boys advise that made him think drastically,this all very simple sign most people do not care to believe in or digest,however has always been proven strongly true with time over time,once again it seems it will pronouce it`s coming more over soon."

"This is a high quality company that is currently overvalued and beginning a correction. The market is switching from growth stocks to value stocks. A normal pullback likely bring it under 200 but it could fall more. I will watch for a low, followed by a strong bounce, and buy it when it successfully retests that low. There are better places to put your money at this point in time."

"YES YES :”This is a paradigm changer for Microsoft,” said Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities who has a “buy” rating on Microsoft. “It’s a landmark win that will change the cloud computing battle over the next decade. It’s a shocker to Amazon and Bezos to lose it. But for Microsoft it signals a new era of growth in cloud. This adds $10 to the stock in my opinion.”"
$700 next month!!
Walmart Chooses Microsoft Over Amazon for Cloud Services - this is pretty big stuff
Companies are still infancy in their move to cloud there is still room to grow. My company probably has about 5% of the workloads in azure and still trying to migrate more.. as companies start to move to cloud more workloads in Azure and more growth. . MSFT is a long term beast..
I never put too much weight in option expiration day movements. The price action is more about squaring off positions that about fundamental direction. Monday will tell me more. Still thinking this selloff is far from over.
"Any good news looks priced in here above $230?

The trend goes up for 2-3 weeks, dials back for a week, and the repeats, always closing up month over month, quarter over quarter, etc... based on that and that alone, it looks like this week may be a “plateau or backfill” week. Is anyone else seeing this different? I am new to MSFT and holding this one long. I’m just trying to get a feel for the trend. Cheers!"
"I started investing in Microsoft about two weeks ago and the stock moves have been mostly boring since then. For msft longs, what moves the stock? Earnings? Analysts updates? I have not seen any recent analyst make any recommendations on msft so I’m kinda lost here. The main reason I bought msft is because I thought it was a good company with high growth potential. I want to invest long term but I find myself lacking in info about the stock"

MSFT is Walmart’s Cloud provider. Signed a 5 year deal in 2018 so makes sense. Walmart will find a way to merchandise off of TikTok and Yet another revenue stream for MSFT. 
what happen????
"Expecting some significant increase sooner or later if MSFT wins TikTok. By addin TikTok to the firm's portfolio, MSFT is not only diversifying it's business line, but also stepping up as a e-Commerce giant in US. e-Commerce is already proven in China and MSFT is trying to become the pioneer within the US market. This ultimately explains why MSFT partnered up with Walmart to hunt TikTok. Some people thinks this is something against Amazon but actually MSFT is playing a whole different game. Dislike me if u disagree."

According to fan-theory $150.20 will be the next possible trend-top level and thereby pose a resistance level which may not be broken at the first attempt."

"Take a look at the charts for MSFT, show me where it's dipped and I'll show you where it's recovered. MSFT has been one of the most stable stocks in my portfolio and even though these last couple days are beating up my contracts I know this will recover, and stronger too because this contract stall is temporary.

"Three Major PositivesAt Zacs as of 02/20/2020""First, the U.S. economy remains stable. Consumer confidence data for January and preliminary consumer sentiment data for February have jumped underscoring the fact that individuals are still optimistic about future growth prospects. Some business-centric data hinted on a possible bottoming out of the U.S. manufacturing.Second, U.S. corporates have performed better-than expected in fourth-quarter 2019. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are currently expected to be up 0.8% on 4.3% higher revenues year to date. This is a complete turnaround from earnings decline of 3.2% year over year on 3.5% higher revenues, projected at the beginning of the reporting cycle.More importantly, despite the outbreak of the coronavirus, total earnings of the S&P 500 index for the ensuing first-quarter 2020, are now expected to be up 1% on 5% higher revenues year over year.Third, an accommodative Fed and continuation of easy money policies have restored investor confidence on risky stock markets. The central bank’s assurance of doing whatever necessary to support U.S. economic expansion has boosted market participants’ optimism to a large extent."""

"You have a company like Gamestop(GME), a brick and mortar video game retailer, making no money and using an obsolete business model, which has doubled this week due to ridiculous stock manipulation. At the same time you have a great company like MSFT blowing away estimates last night and actually making lots of money which could be down today. This market is in serious trouble! Some young investors(and possibly old) are going to lose lots of money."

"After AMZN's earnings report, you'd think that MSFT's stock price would jump another $5 per share in AH. MSFT took them to the woodshed on this quarter, especially with cloud growth, which is what everyone's interested in anyway. Everything that MSFT sells is high margin. AMZN needs their AWS revenues to prop up their e-commerce activity which is low margin. I know Bezos is very adept at coming up with innovative ideas, but I think MSFT is just a superior business model - for the time being."
Those who bought yesterday are winners.
Important to note that MSFT have more data centres than both Amazon and Google combined... can only bode well for future rapid growth in cloud. This is all down to Satya he's an amazing & inspirational CEO!
"It's fine, Microsoft is just a better company. They transformed their cloud platform for the needs of the Pentagon and won the contract."

Ok. Is everyone selling their msft? Or hanging in there? Your opinion please?
all you fans: you had better buy now before earnings next week
UNDERVALUED...back to 110$ next week
Why oh why would anyone even think about shorting this stock must be inexperience
"For everyone that says the market has no confidence and that's why everything is down, including MSFT - it's because Tesla, Apple and Facebook are releasing their earnings today so it's not that the market is lacking confidence - it's just drawing back on hesitation based on how these companies perform since they make up a huge portion of the market. They're all poised to perform well. Just wait till tomorrow and see everything including MSFT go up."
"Here is why I think MSFT is a good core holding for the long term:MSFT was recently reaffirmed as the winner of the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing contract for the US Dept. of Defense. During the almost 20 years I've worked for the US Govt. every government PC I've ever used has Windows, MS Office, MS PowerPoint and MS Outlook interfacing with a Microsoft email server. Every US government agency I am aware of still uses Windows and MS Office software almost exclusively. 12 years in private industry working for companies from Fortune 500 sized to small business and I rarely used anything that wasn't an MS Windows computer with MS Office. For over 30 years MSFT has maintained virtual lock the office software market and they've started transitioning to a potentially more lucrative subscription model. MS Azure cloud infrastructure that rivals Amazons AWS which is likely how they won the DoD contract. Microsoft also dabbles in the computer gaming industry with the Xbox and around 15 million Xbox game pass subscribers. They also have a their fingers in the telecommuting pie with Microsoft Teams and Skype. They also own Linked-In, the major professional social media site which racked up $6.8 billion in revenue in FY 2019. They also own GitHub, the premier online content management and software development site. They are an amazingly diverse company that generates huge revenues from hardware, software and online services portfolios that continue to grow. Over the long term it is hard to see how they don't thrive."
"We view MSFT as the dominant hybrid cloud company, and all enterprises are transitioning to hybrid as they want the flexibility to adopt public cloud on their own terms,” [Oppenheimer's] Horan wrote in a note Thursday. He maintains an Outperform rating and $145 price target on the stock."
$111 by tomorrow?
It's hard to believe but MFST is still a good buy.. Just keeps going up..
Great management. A real long-term hold.
Added shares around 214.

MSFT is steadily heading north from here!
investors heard what they wanted to. up $11.5+ AH
All time high the end of today.
$250 this week. Amazon will lift the whole Tech market after they report. 
It is only down because Microsoft management is cashing out their yearly bonuses. They should be done soon.

Cowen analyst Nick Yako said the Microsoft Jedi contract with the Department of Defense is worth up to $10B over ten years. The contract is to provide cloud infrastructure and it represents significant upside to revenue estimates given its potential relative to the size of Azure; which he estimates generated $13B in 2019. Yako reiterated his Outperform rating and $155 price target on Microsoft shares.
Why?

"Judge temporarily blocks Microsoft Pentagon cloud contract after Amazon suitPUBLISHED THU, FEB 13 20202:11 PM ESTAnnie Palmer@ANNIERPALMER Last month, Amazon filed a motion asking the court to pause Microsoft’s work on the $10 billion cloud contract. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, cloud contract was awarded to Microsoft last October. Last November, Amazon indicated it would protest the Pentagon’s decision. The company claims the evaluation process contained “unmistakable bias” and has since asked the court for permission to depose President Donald Trump, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and former Defense Secretary James Mattis."

"I agree with the hard line on China. Let’s face it the Chinese don’t play nice. They are universally disliked (to putit mildly) by all their neighbors. Be it Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan. Vietnam, South Korea and on and on. Their political system is toxic. It doesn’t promote free and original thought. Look how few companies outside of China are started by Chinese. Contract that to India and the plethora of High Tech companies founded and/or led by people from India. One country has free elections the other does not. Eventually the communist system in China will collapse under their own weight as all the young people coming up and entering into business will not put up with this toxic system. It will be a gradual collapse but a collapse it will be. IMHO "
"oversold -check. Well, you can never deny tech stocks. Microsoft, APple, TEsla, NIO, Amazon will be here to stay. Genomics like Editas, CRISPS, intellia. Green energy i.e. Enphase, Array, GEVO will be winners in the future. Sure, inflation is a concern but money surpluses, manufacturing- production increases will stave off unsustainable inflation eventually. And stocks will continue to return to rallies."
Should see $140.00 In June !!!!
Maybe some part of the growth was already in the run up from 135ish to 230+? Not a bad company though.

Amazing 89% growth in AZURE.. Wow. LinkedIn up 37% this is awesome growth. Impressive earnings this is going north bound company making massive progress in cloud and I'm loving it. Interesting to see how they will monitise GitHub.. Great Q.
"Microsoft is a great stock if you want to park some money for a long time and add some of the profits you make from other ventures. It's not a stock to make quick dollars. There are other stocks that even have huge market caps better than microsoft when it comes to trading in the short term. For instance this stock was 50 dollars at the end of 2015. It's 216-220 now. 80% a year beats the dow and the sp500 by 3 and beats the nasdaq by 2. My husband opened a position with Microsoft in 2009 when it went under 20 dollars (pe ratio was like 10, even though the revenue was still increasing lol) with 25,000 dollars and is worth over 350,000 now since he reinvests most dividends. Plus people that bought then get over 2.2 dollars per share they bought under 19 dollars. And that's pale compared to ppl that bought in the 80s. Amazing company"
"Crazy that the price is this low to begin with, more volume, better margins, paying dividends and a chance at a part of if not all of 10 billion dollar contract. AMZN 1,990 and this stock 140; it's crazy that this stock isn't selling for more."
News I was looking for! was hoping theyd get into ev. $300 eoy.
"SIMPLE: post your guess for tomorrow's open and close price here. Tomorrow, we refer back and crown champ."
"The everlasting tech giantTravis Hoium (Microsoft): The world of technology is now dominated by a handful of companies who have the scale to compete to provide the services millions, or billions, of people need. For Microsoft, that initially meant providing an operating system that computers ran on, but now it increasingly means the cloud services that are the backbone of the apps and software companies we interact with every day. The strategic change was drastic, but CEO Satya Nadella has shifted Microsoft's focus rapidly since taking over five years ago. The ability to shift strategies is key because tech companies have to adapt and evolve over time. In the long term, Microsoft's financial performance speaks for itself and shows how well the company adapts. Despite PCs becoming less popular, the company is generating more revenue and free cash flow than it ever has before."
Mr. Softie made a statement today. Put a marker in the ground. Play time is over amigos. Time to roll! On to $200 compadres!
MSFT a machine
$300. target at Wedbush
"Overvalued stocks TSLA $284.18, NVDA $245.56 vs undervalued stocks AMD $12.45, MSFT $97.32.Do your home work DD and enjoy the ride.."
The days of MMs manipulating small investors are over.
"Those individuals who always say this is a buying opportunity are so off base when it comes to those who already own it. Yes, it is a buying opportunity if you do not own it or want to add more. However, for those of us who own it at a low price and see it going down have to now wait to see it come back to a price that it came down from to recoup that decrease. Example it is not a buying opportunity for me unless I buy and it goes back up in a reasonable time. When it goes down $ six or 7 dollars as it is doing it today All am doing to bring up my cost basis by buying more. I only make more as it goes up. I lose when it goes down. So is this a real buying opportunity for me. NO. I am not sure if many of you understand this position. Now as far as I am concerned I am bullish and MSFT should be above $300. Therefore it is a buying opportunity for all new buyers."
Question is no longer whether its worth a trillion. Its how many trillion
Very pricy
Turnaround Tuesday tomorrow...MSFT isn't going away..the cloud's here to stay.
Great earnings report and call. Wall street crooks working hard to shake shares loose from weak hands. Don't give them your shares. Will be much higher soon.

Go MSFT! 
$200 by end of the month
Undervalued AMD $27.63 & Undervalued MSFT $111.33 are fine gems that will go to new highs again and again...……. do your proper home work.
"Microsoft cloud will be like electricity, everyone will use it. Hugh hugh growth and salable path ahead. Why would business will choose Amazon is beyond me. Amazon could be their nextcompetiton as Amazon my enter their vertical business and Microsoft will not. This is strategic thinking for CEO that can anticipate threats."
MSFT stock will barely move on TikTok news just look at the fundamentals and market cap.... adding new business will contribute marginally in the first couple years. You can make a good case for long term however nothing substantial in the short-term.
"What is this sell off? MSFT won the contract, not lost it"
We go Dividend Ex on 17th(as per public records).Adding to our position.Buying more GPK too.
This is one great stock that is a must own if you want to get ahead in this game.
"A place to park money. If you haven’t figured that out yet, someone should take your money to manage it."
Massive beat
Is this what some call a breakout?
"Team, I have an question despite of good earning why it went down any idea ? I have option that expire 7/31 what should I do now ?"
This is called the lollipop before the major drop next week
Hoping for 250+ after earnings
Doubling up here. Great companies manipulate business models to grow. #MSFT
"Wow MSFT is over taking AAPL as the biggest company in the world. MSFT keeps the head down and slowly but steady moving ahead, no fuss just sheer hard work and determination. Great company unbelievable the transformation over the last five years under Satya's reign.. This is going higher."
Should start working itself through 150$ this week!
Looking at the chart from 2000 it is incredible how it went up a lot. Technology is going to continue to be hot in the coming years God Bless.
"Having held this since the days of memorizing DOS commands, I'm OK with this."
Solid companies like undervalued MSFT & Undervalued AMD given us again a perfect opportunity to add more shares at a big discount...….
I wanna sell my shares so badly I’m so deep in the loss any advice?
Breaking out!
Just bought June 8th 50 call contracts $102 strick for $0.24 each
On CNBC now. Bank of America gives MSFT a target of $200 because of its A.I. offering. Nice!
Why is $MSFT struggling the last couple of days?
"Microsoft has a 2$ dollar project with AT&T and is up for $10 Billion Pentagon JEDI project contract as per FortuneAmazon and Microsoft are the last two companies in the Pentagon competition for a $10 billion cloud services contract, the Defense Department already has been using Microsoft and it is very hard to remove all its content overnight, so there is a better chance that the contract will be divided between Microsoft and Amazon for the minimum requirements."
"Glad I hung in there, looks like it's trying to form a base at 240."
"Reminder again My long friends, MSFT, AMD will continue to go to new highs. You either buy at these level or buy at higher prices...……. Do your own home work and win, Enjoy your Thanksgiving in the great USA...……."
"If MSFT gets to $300 a share, will we see a stock split? (Asking for a friend)"
if $MSFT acquires $AMD does the $XLNX deal go through or would there be new regulatory hurdles?
$KODK has a partnership with $PLUG and $MSFT 
Remember what happened to adobe the day of earnings and then right after when earnings were announced! Ignore the naysayers!
"Can someone please explain why this MSFT, compared to others, doesn't move as much? This stock is so undervalued compared to industry, has solid earnings and lots of growth to come - yet almost always flat? I'm long on MSFT but to me a lack of movement vs. industry."
MSFT's cloud vaccine booking management software failing in a big way in NJ. They've switched back to using county and hospital software for bookings! It's pretty shocking that MSFT can't correctly build a piece of booking management software. Is it that hard or is their quality control that poor?
"Demand for undervalued MSFT equity has increased in the last 3 week, big volume not surprised, investors are waking up to the real potential of MSFT ...…………. Lets not forget Azure runs better on undervalued AMD 7nm Epyc."
‘BREAKING THE NEWS’
What means this shouting in the red tide? I do fear the people with cash.
see you at $115 00
"According to some people, a rise of $12-13 between August 2020 and now is deemed a “sharp” rise."
Will the global Cyber Attack hacking of Microsoft's Exchange servers negatively affect Microsoft's share price? They say the security patch will stop further damage but it's likely the malware will keep affecting the servers internally. I'm sure the problem will be solved quickly but I wonder if this incident will #$%$ investors into dumping their stock.??
"In the excerpt of Dan Ives’ note, I only saw a mention of FAANG stocks and no mention of Microsoft. Does it mean that the GA elections outcome do not impact $MSFT?"
i will be happy if msft goes high 2% tomorrow
New to the Investment world. Used to work for Microsoft and currently in IT. Still learning but would love to own some of the MSFT stock. Seems to be going strong. Is it a good time to buy or would you recommend waiting for a dip?
$ 1.38+ now AH...wait until cc is over...may hit $ 140+ tomorrow...profit margins stronger than expected...shorts are cooked!
MSFT is both the intergenerational wealth creator and the safest tech play.
"The worst DOW stock in JAN 2021. Well done, Democrat Bill Gates"
Overall the numbers are still very good.
"I constantly root for $MSFT stock prices to go higher because I believe in the company and hold the belief that it deserves a richer valuation. And then, I get a lot of folks coming at me because they’re quite satisfied with the stock going up a meager $10-12 dollars between August 2020 and now I won’t give in to their pressure. I won’t accept their contention that the stock is performing well, because it is not. For goodness sake, the stock has been consistently and substantially underperforming the Nasdaq for months on end. Look up the chart on Yahoo Finance and do a comparison yourself."
Microsoft's new Surface Duo will be powered by the Qualcomm snapdragon 855 processor and run Android.Pretty neat!
Set up for a huge breakout. Life time hold
This has a direct climb to 150 written all over it. And I mean DIRECT!!
I believe Msft will beat the number which is good but the cloud surface has just been scratched. The projections for the future will be great . Get ready
"Everyone talking about if microsoft going to do a split, but I think more important they need to buy back stock, not dilute it more... thoughts?"
"I’m in at a $206 average with 250 shares. I’m fairly new to investing in individual stocks, but Msft has a great track record with a promising future. Hard to believe earnings won’t be good, but I can’t decide whether to purchase another 250 shares now since the price point is on the appealing side, or just wait until after earnings? Any input from someone who’s been in with with msft for awhile now is really appreciated!"
Lets go $154
Wedbush raises PT to $ 170. Here come the raised PT's and upgrades. Shorts need to cover . Back over $140 today.
We should see 109.50s tomorrow! Go MSFT!! Finally got an excellent BOD. All pro.
What is going on??? Is MSFT doing that bad?
"MSFT is an example of an old company that can learn new tricks. I expect a decent earnings report tomorrow, and if not, then that's just another dip to buy. This company gets better with age, just like a fine wine. I can only imagine where it will trade 10 years from now. Nadella is the best CEO since Gates. He's innovative, creative, and a natural leader. I wouldn't want a better captain at the helm. This ship is in good hands for the foreseeable future."
"I’ve been trading for 16 years now, I did not sell any of my stocks in 2008 so why would I sell now. Microsoft is a long term investment not a quick cash grab."
Wall Street is waiting for guidance for cloud business. All these are nothing
"I have a sell @ 250, will it hit it tonight?"
Microsoft assumed with a Buy and $292 price target at CitiCiti analyst Tyler Radke assumed coverage of Microsoft with a Buy rating and $292 price target. The analyst sees Microsoft as the best positioned large cap software vendor over the next few years to take advantage of traditional enterprise customers moving to the cloud.
12/31 msft will be near $350
At prices around $202 MSFT is HUUUGE BARGAIN. I will Remind you this when it will be traded at $260 and it will not be long from now.
Can't keep a good stock down for long. Go Microsoft.
Did anyone shorted MSFT? anyone know what was the short interest before going into earning?
is it me or do I feel like msft is doing many little actions to prepare for something big ?
This is not the old Microsoft. This is the new high flying to the cloud Microsoft. Thank the CEO. I can’t even pronounce his name properly. :-)
Why is this Stock not over 240 was 247 AH last night
Uhggg! Should of put it all in here last week. I knew!!!
If there was a market crash would this stock be affected heavily?
"The ONLY long-term hold, TINA."

If it breaks the 200 like most stocks have look out below

Great quarter. Great guidance. Great company.
Do not sleep on this Monday will add 3% shame on whoever didn’t buy. Pure marker manipulation on the headlines.
lot of big option bets out there looking for ~108 after earnings
Just picked up another 50 shares
If not $APLE then there will be someone else like $MSFT Or any other blue-chip companies
All time high getting into sight. We should blow past that soon. 
MSFT is the best stock on the planet...look where it is in 2 weeks time
Steve Ballmer now worth over $50 billion in MSFT stock. He has 333 million shares and hasn't sold any in years. I'd like to see his dividend payment every 3 months.
$250 next week
$270 predicted. Easy 10-20%
just keeps creeping up to new highs
So the analysts are telling you to sell big tech do to inflation concerns and buy leisure like hotels and airliners. ALK airlines and Marriott hotels SP are higher now than they were pre pandemic. Normalcy for both will not return for some time. It makes me sick how the media/analysts try to trap the retail investors. This is what the SEC should be looking into. PUMP & DUMP brought on by network stock analysts and commentators!
Who feels or thinking there will or should be a 5-10% correction?
$250 tomorrow for sure!!! Great call!
"Alright I cave in, just bought 400 shares at 165.05. Will buy more if it goes up. If it goes down from here, you know why."
"Just sad to see msft down....had it been TSLA, even 2000 point down could not make a dent in earning rally"
This a good buy here?
Should I buy MSFT?
are the dark days finally over? will it stay green? hope so
Great day
Now get started on the new Elder Scrolls
"FYI: KeyBanc initiated coverage on Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) with an Overweight rating. The price target for Microsoft is set to $250.00. For the first quarter, Microsoft had an EPS of $1.82, compared to year-ago quarter EPS of $1.38. The current stock performance of Microsoft shows a 52-week-high of 232.86 and a 52-week-low of 132.52. Moreover, at the end of the last trading period, the closing price was at $210.11."
If this stock continues at the same rate as last year (February 2020) it should reach some where around $265 on February 2021 - providing Biden isn't elected!It will more than likely rise for about a week - into next week for sure!Will beat 4th Q earnings!
"Quite frankly, MSFT has better qualities than average FAANG."
Microsoft the company is a Ferrari while most companies are a Yugo in comparison. Drive the Ferrari.
Just bought another 15 shares now I have 536 shares at $157/share

profit taking and buying opportunity all in the same day wow
What a nice start to the week and loaded with positive commentary...

"Nadella: ""Although it understandable many us are fearful of contracting the virus, companies are doing what they can to keep you safe and working from home. MSFT wants to keep you safe online too. Things are going great for us. We'll keep innovating for you and keep up with changing times."""
Easily a 142 dollar stock by End of year.
"MSFT has beaten expectations. Estimated EPS 1.64, reported 2.03. Estimated revenue 40 bill, reported 43. This is a great stock, I will be buying now, especially since markets are irrelevant and ppl are not looking at fundamentals. However, our patience will be rewarded."
Earnings are next week. Best time to buy
MSFT could hit 220$ today to catch up with AAPL TSLA NVDA index QQQ
The same news keeps recycling and the market reacts. Trump is desperate to divert the impeachment news!
High Flyer for 2018......Microsoft. King of Tech.
Why the sell off at the end of the trading day? Makes no sense
Major major correction ready
A drop this week is a buying opportunity.
Softie involved in major quantum computing breakthrough in collaboration with University of Sydney. Just another area where this company is staking out a leading role. Incredible future.
"Tsla the probable future msft of the ev industry. Sitting on 900 pe and that is fine by many. Here we have the msft, pe 40, omfg how dare you be so over priced."
Turn out the lights. Come back next week
"Funny how all the millennials have their social causes, like ""green energy"", ""diversity"", ""racial injustice"".....but wehn it comes to actual facts on the ground like MSFT's Daily Pass, they don't seem to think its anything to be concerned about."
"Fly Big M, Fly!"
"We’re up 41% YTD (not including dividends) after being up 55% last year (not including dividends). Incredible for a massive company still growing exponentially., And some have been complaining. Try owning a stock for years instead of hours and learn to invest and grow rich. Long and strong since August 1996. "
MSFT beat on every level. Fantastic! This will carry the day for next 3 months. Expect massive Fund price increases starting tomorrow. Likely hit $275 next ER. 
Cramer - msft will be over 100 by March maybe even 110.
Well well well/ could reach 180 today
"At investopedia 23d of july so take your time and digest it:""The reaction to the earnings report from Microsoft (MSFT) yesterday was a major clue. The report came in as very good news and yet investors sold shares heavily after hours. This kind of behavior is typical of professional investors who operate by the maxim ""buy the rumor and sell the news."" What that notion describes is a tactic used by fund managers who need to unload their positions and move money to different stocks. During such times they often have a lot of shares to sell—too many to be sure they won't hurt prices as they sell. To optimize their profit-taking activities, they try to find a time when the shares are likely to have a lot of buyers. What better time than when earnings are great and market sentiment seems to be strong? However the timing of this strategy coincided with a moment when even retail investors were growing nervous (See Caleb Silver's article from last week ). It seems many other traders and investors had the same idea"""
We should get a nice spike around noon and keep rising for the next few days. We are rolling to $115. Happy Trading!
Now they are PUMPING $GOOG and $MSFT BUBBLES to PUMP NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE more!
$200 is not far from us
MSFT is an tech infrastructure company. Each time it goes down by 4-5 points I add a small amount.
Will Microsoft stop its solid growth now that the US Senate is split 50/50 between Reps/Dems?Will companies stop their migration to Azure cloud?Why the knee jerk reaction then? Have any of the fundamentals changed?Investors needs to keep politics aside and focus on the fundamentals of their stocks.
Bill Gates and Trump on good terms. Msft to get JEDI CONTRACT!!!! Trump and Bezo no love lost!!!
I remember in 2010 when when I bought at 18.80 and those of us on this board would be posting '$25 by 2011. Well it's been quite the ride since and will get even better tomorrow.
MSFT has remained stable even through this correction the past 2 days. good stock
Gaining momentum!! Never lose your patience
"Congrats one and all! WOW, what a win!!! We're going higher on Monday, much higher! Congrats again!!!"
"If Microsoft acquires tik tok, it will be the highest market cap company by the end of 2021"

Is this a gift from Microsoft before earnings !!!!
"AMD is poised to double in 2919..Microsoft using AMD EPYC servers in its azure datacenter cloud.AMD 7 nm Data center EPYC servevcpu launches in June and one AMD 7 nm cpu outperformed intels fastest dual cpu at 2019 ces.

"I am writing this just to make things clear to all the speculators, regardless of the Tik Tok deal MSFT is worth $220 per share if it was reflective of the FAANG stocks which have all the new hype based retail traders inflating their value it would probably be more around $250. You need to keep in mind that they have just beaten analyst expectations for the last 4 quarters and closed an incredibly strong 2020 fiscal year. They experienced a slow down in Azure cloud service revenue however so did Amazon the market leader, additionally that are the only big tech company I have seen that are still trading well below the Analyst price target, Tik Tok is just a tiny reason in the overall formula of why MSFT is a Buy and why we should hopefully see a strong breakout at some point in the near future however this market were in does not seem to follow any sense of logic but I am sticking to my guns with this one."
"Guys, can we all thanks omar for selling his shares today so the rest can profit, we will call this thanksomar day"
Wednesday will be the day that Microsoft breaks above $230 and begins the march towards $300
I wouldn't sell a penny of this stock - you need to be invested in it!
"$MSFT - Intelligent Cloud revenue $14.6 billion. Up 23% yoy. Beat analyst expectations. P/E as at market close on 2/1: 35.71$AMZN - AWS revenue $12.7 billion. Up 28% yoy. Fell short of analyst expectations. P/E as at market close on 2/1: 98.82Perhaps someone can explain the MASSIVE difference between the P/E of the 2 companies. I’ve been seeking objective feedback for years now.TL;DR - In my opinion, HUGE upside to $MSFT stock. Investors ought to take notice."
Posting all-time high after hours
I have made thousands of option trades and i can honestly say there hasnever been a time where owning outs was orofitable for me but calls have profited nearly every single time $nflx $shop $nvda $mu
"Interesting. MSFT is up, and AMZN is down. Who would have figured?"
Which is best long time Tesla or Microsoft or Apple
$270 by April
"... Once more, I wouldn't bet against Microsoft."
"Take this for what it's worth. Microsoft has 2 core offerings. Azure and Office 365. I am in the data center and cloud business. I'm an SE for a large colocation provider. Azure is way more popular right now than AWS for production work loads and it is also faster growing. O365 is a great product too because nobody does exchange in house anymore for the most part. Oh yeah, let's not forget that 70% of applications run on Windows and most have a SQL back end. This stock is a no brainer."
Up up and AWAY
Lol @ Cramer’s meltdown. The responses to his insane tweets are pure gold. 
FB and MSFT both beat!
cmon ride the train cmon ride!
MSFT upgraded to $105
MSFT will be working on new tech that a British company came out with called V-Health Passports!
something strange going on....all these higher growth numbers yet couldn't make the revenue number and only a penny better on EPS.
MSFT will boost sales of the new Xbox through tik tok. This stock will easily be worth $500 someday
MSFT and AMD are extremely undervalued
MSFT is your best friend
"After a fairly lethargic run in 2020 - especially in the second half, as compared to its peers, I believe that $MSFT is back. I never lost confidence in Microsoft, but its stock performance since August 2020 had become worrisome, even for a long term investor like me. None of that matters. I sincerely hope that is behind us. I am of the opinion that 2021 will bring value to Microsoft and its shareholders."
just look the results this company has had that's why you should keep your stocks and buy when the price is down like now
seriously. where is the 245 i saw yesterday. come on !!
Remember the golden rule: MSFT is a safe bet in any environment
days losses already wiped out in post market. lets GO!
back to 115 soon?
Steve Ballmer coming on CNBC this morning to discuss TikTok deal at 8:30.
I think MSFT & AMD are in competition to go to new highs again and again.
Microsoft will reach 300 by end of 2020
This looks primed for permanent break-out
... This! will not stop at $150 - just sayin!
"We believe that Microsoft is one of the best-positioned companies in our coverage to outperform over the next several years. Microsoft is becoming a strategic partner in enterprises’ digital transformations, and key parts of its portfolio (Azure and O365) are serving mission-critical functions. With the unmatched depth and breadth of its technology portfolio, we believe that the company has multiple levers to grow revenue, margins, and its customer base over the next several years, evidenced by multiyear double-digit revenue growth at an unmatched scale."
ALL. TIME. HIGH. SWEEEEET
congrats to everyone we are over $100 and on our way to $107+
"msft ia a $3T company hands down! cloud alone is worth $1T, their software is optimized to run in AZURE, they will have autonomous cars, will break into fintech in a big way too"
I think we may see 240 with earnings.
Grabbed MSFT 240 calls - complete YOLO but I am always right so.....
"this is a great buy at this price easy 200 dollar stock, like thats 3 months ago value before earings beat"
Microsoft is supporting the political grab in Washington. They want us controlled and we are entering a communist dictatorship in America.
It’s obvious the only reason this is down today and it’s most likely all because Azure grew at a slower rate than it did in Q3. This is most likely just a normal fluctuation though and today represents a GOOD buying opportunity
Hold on to this stock or buy it - next 8 weeks will be worth the ride - many new multiple highs coming!
Might be time to buy soon
close over 92.30..my guess
"Last week people be like, MSFT is too high to buy, I think I’ll wait for a pullback before I buy some more. This week people be like, MSFT pulled back, I think I’ll wait for it to rise a bit before I buy some more."

Great rally. The stock has basically become made of Teflon now.
I hope MSFT's facial recognition is being used at CPAC. I think a lot of the 1/6 insurrectionists can be picked up.
Sell Apple and buy MFST
You just buy this one on every dip
Best stock in EVERYONE’S portfolio. Wow what a great company. Thank you Mr Nardella.
"Like i said last week, I but MSFT everyday because I have no time for GAMES!"

Ready for div raise 
"Grantham says the bubble is about to burst. I think that there are many stocks that are overvalued - but I also see many that aren't. Financials and energy, in particular, seem to be areas that haven't enjoyed the run-up. Techs have been on a ride, but I think we've seen a major shift in how tech is used in the economies of the world. To me, this seems like the industrial revolution, part 2. Grantham may be right (and I agree that the Fed keeping rates so low has jolted the market upward), but we'll have to see what happens. I think it's more likely that we'll have a 10-20% pullback sometime this Spring. A lot is going to depend on how the economy responds once vaccines have been widely disseminated."
This is going to 230 pronto. Absolute no brainer. COVID actually benefitted MSFT and will continue to for years to come.
For goodness sakes don't sell on Monday - this will keep going higher and higher - I'd say around $155 to $160!
We wont have corrections until retail traders refuse to be hedged by market makers selling them puts $GME $AAPL $GOOG $MSFT $FB
Lol. Microsoft is a buy at this price
Love Windows 7. Sticking with it forever. Windows 10 is confusing and not user friendly at all. It is absoloutely not an option.
Fantastic Finish and overall day! Another $2 to the plus for Mr. Softie. Well done Satya! :))
"Don't be surprised if it gets green tomorrow. This is a huge beat, big enough that the MMs looking to crush options may have issues if the volume shows up.Otherwise just wait a week."
"In my opinion this sell off in FAANG and other big tech has overshoot to the downside. The 10-Yr Bond is still very low despite the fact it came up a lot % wise. It's up from 0.5, which is very very low.$AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $NFLX, $AMZN."
"I give up......apple down yesterday before earnings and iphone sales way down, but apple up 10$today microsoft up during the day and now down.....impossible, just buy and hold and average down on good companies, works every time. but timing the market, impossible. work trades on a weekly daily chart, you will lose money trying to trade on the 1 or 5 minute chart unless you have a horseshoe up your heiny."
Watching the summary on what the CEO had to say on the call CNBC summarized it well. Also they stated the $110 option calls are setup well for Friday based off the beat.
"People selling, how dumb can you be. Sure, other stocks will give you quicker earnings, but you can also lose a lot/everything! Good luck with your gambling! Microsoft has safety and growth!"
"To me, it is beginning to look like the stock price might finally be on its way to start catching up with Microsoft’s valuation. Long journey ahead. Let’s see if we can get there. Awesome job by the CEO and workers."
So Microsoft bought Express Logic recently to increase it's azure cloud presence. They said Express Logic has over 6 million devices that connect through the secure azure cloud. Azure is going to be huge. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2019/04/21/how-does-the-express-logic-acquisition-help-microsoft-and-the-iot-ecosystem/amp/
Microsoft should have invested in Tesla instead.
Complainers on this board aren't investors. MSFT was at 206 a month or so ago. What goes up on a daily basis? Nothing. Hold long and strong and you will be smiling in the not too distant future.
My 25 shares look better today. Still learning to invest here.
I can always count on Microsoft nice and steady performance
Nice reversal
"180 by close, 185 afterhours, all time high by end of week.... I can dream"

Will buy more today. Another 100 money printing machines aka MSFT shares :-)

"Microsoft is caught up in a broad sector rotation out of momentum stocks and into cyclicals/industrials/energy. This has affected companies like CrowdStrike and Twilio the most, however Visa and Microsoft are also under downward pressure. The latter two should return to normal by the end of this week and resume their upward trend."

MSFT is the intergenerational wealth generator so it is never too late to buy.

this can go to 180 in the coming rally
don't sell to shorts. this will close above 242 today.

I think no one concerns what had happened to US Country with a total infected case of 40k plus 400 death toll. It is not even 1% based on total population of 320million. Daily increase of 10k cases is not a big matter. Let’s buy buy and buy
"absolutely astonishing, thought about selling last Friday afternoon, so glad I didn't, I should have bought more"
"Oh my, premarket looks great! Time to buy add more. 200 is just around the corner, I doubt we need to wait until March. Everyone should add and hold this golden egg for the rest of your life."

"It is one thing to write about how well run Microsoft is (I could write pages and pages because, IMO, it is one of the best companies that I have looked into).But it is another to make price predictions. I mean what’s the purpose of that?I’m not saying that one is not entitled to be optimistic about a higher stock price. You are absolutely entitled to be optimistic. Even I am optimistic on many days.But please slow down with the price predictions. Please!Note: I am equally annoyed with the downward price predictions."
"I bought MSFT late, like right when it was 221. I missed it at closing then bought it next day at 226.97. I'd been in the red pretty much ever since. Finally sold it at close today but plan to jump back in if it gets under 224 or if TT happens I'll grab some immediately."

A case study is taking place in my own house. My college-freshman daughter is taking her spring semester classes over Zoom. My wife is preparing to teach a law school class by Zoom. A few days ago, I ""attended"" a class via Zoom.

Sell al apple buy MSFT
Maybe a lot us haven't totally understood the potential in Microsoft - this parabolic streak I thought would have ended by now. There hasn't really been a down day in weeks that you could blame the company for - the shorts are screaming.
"Wait - so MSFT saw little impact from coronavirus that has shut down the entire planet to some extent, caused huge numbers of people to lose jobs, lose businesses, caused bankruptcy filings, pushed us into a recession and created huge amounts of economic uncertainty. How is thst even possible? And what would affect the company if this doesn't. Imo, there is some serious manipulation going on with the markets that the talking heads used to say hated uncertainty. That's ALL we have right now and stocks are climbing close to where the were pre-March. If this pandemic does nothing but cause a brief blip in the market then we should be looking at a bull market that continues on forever. None of this makes sense"

Three days in a row... better buy some calls for next week. I doubt it it will be 4 days red.
MSFT is going to report its best earnings in history!

I hope this isn’t a 4 year trend. Our dear leader knows how to give away free money and tax.
Call starting now.....
"I never thought MSFT would be my biggest % gainer. Sleeper, stock is running away from me. Thanks Bill and Satya."
... Time for Microsoft to start buying their own stock - like they said they would!
"Given the strength of the asset, solid recent execution and multiple areas of synergies, a potential deal for TikTok’s U.S. operations could be a compelling strategic fit for Microsoft, said Morgan Stanley’s equity analyst, Keith Weiss, who gave a price target of $230 for the software giant’s stock."
"I own it and it has been trading around the 105 range. Nothing special yet, hope that changes."

Anyone know when the record date is for the May 15 div? Sure would be nice for a bump in dividend announcement. That’s what we need to this thing to break out!
"I believe today is more of an issue with the entire tech sector dragging us down. just look at AMZN and NFLX.. the tech companies with huge P/Es and strong growth are getting slammed because they aren't growing as fast as the the stock price warrants. With that being said, MSFT has a reasonable P/E, great growth, and a great balance sheet. once the rest of tech stops hurting, this should be a killer. Wouldn't be a bad idea to add to your positions here."

its about time msft dont go down after a earnings beat
As long as the Umpa Lumpa doesn't open his mouth over this long weekend we should see $105 by EOB next Friday.Good Luck to all and enjoy your weekend.
"Microsoft: a leader in infrastructure as a serviceInfrastructure as a service is the industry Amazon pioneered, making data-center services (like storage, networking, computing, and security) available on an as-needed basis.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has long trailed AWS in the space, but its Azure cloud computing offering has been closing the gap by growing at a must faster rate. As an example, in the first calendar quarter of 2020, revenue from AWS grew 33%, while Azure grew 59%. But that's not the only tool in Microsoft's bag of tricks. The company also provides a host of other services via the cloud, like Microsoft 365, Teams videoconferencing software, Windows Virtual Desktop, and Dynamics accounting software, to name a few.The diversity of Microsoft's business also makes it attractive. It has exposure to consumer markets and enterprise products (like Xbox gaming and its LinkedIn professional network) in addition to its business and personal software and fast-growing cloud segments.That strength was on full display in Microsoft's fiscal fourth quarter, ended June 30. Even in the face of the pandemic, revenue grew 13% year over year, with each of its business segments contributing to the better-than-expected performance. Azure grew 47% while Xbox jumped 65%, both boosted by the remote-work and stay-at-home economy. This wide assortment of businesses and its high-growth cloud segment make Microsoft an attractive addition to any portfolio."
i'm loving this...who else is excited?
don't give up on MSFT..it will recover and JEDI will materialize
if Microsoft builds EV. Please stop vehicle you need to upgrade
Bezos Amazon bid on that contract and Trump gave it to Microsoft!
I'm on board for a great ride in 2021. How 'bout you?
"there aint no problems with our economy. ------------ employment, inflation, consumer spending, confidence, corp profits, etc etc etc"
How do you buy the dip when it just keeps going up?
"Momentum is extremely bullish, Candlestick chart is extremely bullish, MACD is bullish, CMF money flow is very bullish , folks MSFT will run bullishly wild for awhile!"
Just bought my first MSFT shares. Trying to accumulate at least 50 shares.
President Trump just signed the USMCA agreement.
MSFT legal dept likely fielding 1000's of calls from hacked co.'s. Sell with impunity imo.
"Hi I read that MSFT give dividend like 10%. I do not know how to calculate that. Lets say I buy today 100 stocks of MSFT, with current dividend, how much I will earn in 5 years for example? Any help would be appreciated very much."
My puts are toast :(
up and over 160
"So, Ima buy some Microsoft at 6:30AM Pacific tomorrow yeah?"
"I don’t see how anyone could not not own this stock. Look at the charts. Pick a range. They are all the same. Constant growth AND a dividend? Yeah, that’s why it’s my top holding."
Not worried. Both the economy and Microsoft are in a robust shape.
"Up over $2 afterhours so tomorrow open up $175?, $180 after earnings?"
Microsoft can leverage its software in EV space and earn from each vehicle 
Tech is back and stronger than ever!
I keep saying this but I love Microsoft. When the entire market is down but Microsoft never disappoints 
so much positive news
Has anyone heard if msft is bidding on the 100 billion dollar 10 year government contract? I know now they provide instant facial recognition of the enemy in a war zone through their cloud service.
"Looking good!! Up , up and away!!"
QUESTION - What liability is MSFT exposed to with the SolarWinds breach and the recent email flaw?

"Current best buy: Microsoft, Amazon or Apple? I think Amazon and Apple are still over priced, it doesn't seem Microsoft is quite as over valued? I have 5-7K to invest, thoughts of which of these 3 you would put money in right now? O sit on the sidelines until October ?? cheers"

What a wonderful dilemma. MSFT profit getting too big to pay taxes on but performance too good to sell.
In 1986 MSFT traded at 12 cents/share (adj). It had a market cap of less than a billion. It is now trading at 1000 times that value at a market cap near 1 trillion.
IN THE 90'S THIS WEEK.....BOUGHT MORE AT 86....
IF <-- the senate goes to the victimclass'democrats can YOU afford it ???
Nice rally. This stock is very undervalued. $100b in cash reserves and a cloud strategy that is eating up AWS' leading position. Will be north of $100 closer to next quarter earnings.
"Come on MSFT, it is your time to shine. 165 please."

MFST is one of the best companies out there if not the BEST.. Showing strong Guidelines as we continue to GROW...
This market is long overdue for a sanity check. The loser companies are being rewarded while the true winners like MSFT are being sold off on spectacular quarters. Long term GME will lose big time to a name like MSFT. These Redditors and their minions will run out of gas eventually and the bubbles they've created will pop. MSFT will bought back. Good quarters get rewarded eventually and MSFT will be no exception. Take advantage of these dips.
"I reassessed $MSFT stock after the results on 1/26/21 and yesterday’s price movement. I feel confident that the stock price has started its journey to grow into Microsoft’s valuation. I still think that the stock is quite undervalued. In my opinion, Microsoft will continue to have strong growth for years to come. I am not going to worry about the daily fluctuations for the next 2 years."
tech will always rise. great opportunity for a visionary investor
Thanks Microsoft Dividends - Picking up my new Audi S5 today.
What a finish! Awesome! Softie comes though! :))
MSFT is on a great upward trend for us stock holders with more to come.
"If you loaded last Monday undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD, you should be very happy today."
I don’t believe it’s the virus. They want to stop trump from saying “look at the stock market”.
"Bought 2,500 MSFT for $222 on 12/30/20, sold for $229 this AM (1/22/21), survived a very painful excursion down to $212 during the malfeasance's attack on Democracy on 1/6, and the following two weeks of uncertainty in our nation. Then bought back in at the end of the day (1,500 @ $226). Will buy more on Monday if the market/MSFT is low on Monday for some strange reason.Looking forward to an earnings beat on 1/26! Hoping for a Tuesday close of $235 Wednesday - sell on the news!?Have a great weekend and stay safe!"
Tailwind for MSFT going into 2021 based on pandemic and need for cloud services as well as significant upgrades from multiple analysts.
If you guys are selling Microsoft I’m buying! Unloading most of my shares at 37 was a huge mistake
Do wish this would go to 250.00 a share still holding
MSFT is the tortoise but she will win the race.
should I buy NOW or will it drop a bit before earnings? Thx !!!
I am calling 145 after earning
thank me later Microsoft team..dillydilly
Msft paid dividend this week so there is some selling to rebalance portfolios - should be done this week
Hmm... Why isn't Christopher here repeating his $212 price target for Friday.
"I feel that CNBC, Kramer and other “Analysts” keep talking up AAPL, AMZN, CRM and barely ever make a passing reference to $MSFT. I feel this is by design."
GET OUT NOW. BIG RED AFTER 4 PM EST / TOMORROW. LIKE PAST 3 EARNINGS
60% of my equity will be rotating into MSFT....10% will remain in high risk/value stocks.
Fundamentals don’t seem important in this market.
Expect great things to happen in 2018 with MSFT
Azure will drive this company for a long time. Retail companies don't want to partner with the enemy Amazon. This well help to continue to close the gap between the two.
they reiterated his overweight rating on Microsoft stock with a price target of 135. plus a 90% buy buy buy rating.
"Not a good week so far,but MSFT always performed well over time. Definitely holding here!Actually, a good time to add more!"

MSFT will reach $ 120 by next Friday. What a great stock!!!
"Hey Luke...I might suggest you review my response to your 3 large tranche MSFT buy plan 2 days ago ..I learned the hard way on prudent investing to grow wealth...perhaps you can benefit from the read in the event you missed it...I got lucky with the timing / calling it like I did but, this is about a methodology that has helped m e with just about every position I take...hope it helps you with your interest in MSFT..sorry for the repeat to the rest of you..Posted 2 days ago;Luke, perhaps some of my history will help you in making your decision. Looking back, I was fortunate to have hit a growth spurt that I thought was not possible for such a large cap stock like MSFT. I had two entry points; the first in 1Q '18 and I sold out in Oct '18 for a respectable gain of ~11%; and the second entry in Jan '19 at almost the same exit price (within $1) now with a paper gain of ~36%.Since Mar of 2018 to now with the same share count at each entry, I have accumulated a mixture of realized / unrealized gains of <50%. However the recent 7 month holding period vs the 6 mo first one is triple the gain in the same time span.How can this information help you? IMHO, the reason for the take off of MSFT in the past 7 mos is directly attributable to explosive cloud / Azure revenue / margin growth. I am about to write covered calls - the Jan 2020 $150's for $5 to get some protection for the ~ accumulated gain of >60%. As a new investor to this or any stock, coming off a price of $94 in Mar of 2018 to >$140 16 mos later indicates to me the stock is probably ahead of itself - that is why I am about to sell the covered calls.As long as Azure & Cloud grows exponentially, entry points need to be measured carefully. Since MSFT just did its second breakout this past Friday, in a matter of a couple weeks, I would be cautious here and watch for dips. Earnings are in Oct and there appears to be support @ $140.50 with resistance between $142 and $143 so it is tight right now.My observations / conclusions are four for what they are worth:1. I agree MSFT is a long term hold;2. MSFT is well overbought right now and earnings dependent for the most part;3. since appreciation is a % game, I would be more inclined to keep some dry powder with smaller / measured bites than the three tranches you are planning;4. a more measured cost basis approach will take the pressure off your decisions if they are too big / overpaying.- perhaps $40k each purchase on dips / market pull backs. Remember MSFT pulled back to $120 in early June.I am simply a private investor attempting to accumulate wealth for a tax deferred account and hope my suggestions provide you some food for thought that can help. Good luck."
MSFT isn’t getting the respect it deserved from that terrific ER. Azure which is waaaay bigger than Google’s Cloud grew at 50% versus 46% for Google Cloud. And that is quite a feat when you consider the size differential between the two Cloud companies And economically MSFT’s growth is all about The Cloud or more specifically their Hybrid Cloud. Over time prices revert to their mean and MSFT will reflect this vis a vis Google. IMHO 
MSFT is a force to be reckoned with. $200!
This stock holds up well in a correction
This DOES NOT mean Microsoft lost the $10b Jedi contract. Amazon and the judge stalled them from working on it. Big difference
Glad I didn’t sell when we are up today. Imagine buying Facebook wow!!
I see a prediction below of 115 tomorrow after earnings. This is a brilliant prediction. I have marked this 115 prediction and copied it up on my wall in 1 foot high letters. I'm going to sleep under this message. Go Microsoft earnings ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

But you won’t be able to attack me when I point out with facts and figures that $MSFT stock price is underwhelming despite the strong fundamentals of the company.

Not trying to be negative, I’m overall very positive on this but of course the risk is what I pointed out.."

Microsoft doesn't need the JEDI contract - it will reach new highs regardless! If they do end up winning the contract who knows where this will go - possibly $200 per share within a very short time.
"It is a mistake to put Microsoft in the same group as other big tech. Reason being that Microsoft’s primary source of revenue growth is from Cloud technology and other applications that are targeted towards the enterprise market. Yes, day to day folks do interact with Windows OS, Bing, LinkedIn, Office Suite, XBox, Surface laptops, tablets and phones. However, talk to any analyst and the first thing they’ll mention is Azure - which is an enterprise play. Analysts are keenly interested in Azure/Cloud growth and Microsoft has been consistently exceeding expectations. So while the technology stocks may finally be losing steam in 2021, you may want to discern Microsoft differently from the other names such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, and Amazon. Some of these other names are also in the crosshairs of regulations and/or political parties. Not the case with Microsoft.TL;DR - I will NOT dismiss Microsoft as another technology stock."

The problem is...is that I bought MSFT and generally when I buy a stock they go down and stay down until I finally get rid of it. Sorry.
"Lol Robinhood investors are complaining why MSFT is not moving. Because it is already priced quite high. Sometimes fundamentals do count and a P/E of 35 is quite high. It has a forward P/E of 25 for over 10 years, meaning people investing now are agreeing that MSFT is slightly high priced for the future. People talk about money printing. Once yields rise due to inflation, you will see the expensive stocks being dumped. Growth stocks with debt will be burned. Rather have a some stable stocks with high cash flow to pay of expensive debt"

"I don't think analysts and financial reporters did such a great job on covering MSFT's earnings for the quarter. While some tried to downplay MSFT's growth rates, others were downright misleading. For example, MSFT's Azure growth continued to grow at over 70%. That's a incredible growth rate. Some reporters and analysts harped on the revenue miss in the hardware sector. Few mentioned that the miss in revenue was actually due to a squeeze on integrated chips. Very amateurish reporting. When companies start reporting earnings results, instead of judging the results I'm starting to consider the integrity of the people making the reports. I just don't see the qualify there."

Not privy to ur charts but our management team has been doing a fantastic job. we've been nimble for a large corporation and able to adapt to market conditions. Our team has come through with stock price appreciation and we've been keeping frivolous spending in check. Kudos to executive leadership!!@
"The fact that MSFT was up on Friday, and AMZN was a bit of poetic justice. MSFT is a never sell stock, imo. Up and up works good in my book. My only regret is that I didn't get in earlier. A lot of folks here are sitting on huge gains. And, much more to come!"
"Wow - what a rock!I ""smelled"" the NASDAQ correction and set stop-loss to half of my shares.Alle SL were triggered.. except MSFT - and... one of a handful, that is green!It seems as MSFT is seen as ""save haven"" under the techs -> this is a REAL POWERFULL SIGN!"
Will but a little at the open.
"$MSFT reports strong cloud growth and demand.Where there's cloud, you need Hardware. AMD's got this covered"

"At this very moment, I am very glad that I am an investor in Microsoft. $MSFT has stayed away from political controversies and has focused on developing its business - which is what a company ought to do. I don’t want my money to be used for activist causes, I want to see it put to good use."
Any thoughts on timing? Holding 30 contracts @ 115 for Jan/20th. I think this is going much higher 150+ ;but may get a short term pullback. Chart is looking ready to run on mid-term but may be a little overbought on the very short-term. Wondering if mometum will keep this on a run. I may roll my options either way tomorrow into a further timeframe but deciding if I should buy back in tomrorow or wait a few days for another pullback. to get back in at 108?
"That ER made a statement. And for the next 3 months will carry the flag for MSFT. Ain’t no stopping us now. Going a lot higher amigos,"
"I have April, 17 $185 calls already with 400% profit. I wanna hold on cuz I believe that they will be well above that by then, but I can’t decide whether I want to wait or take profit. Any advice?"
Sell Msft.Look at LAC...Just do yourself a favor and read the news please. For yourself!Lithium in electric batteries powering everything . First American lithium mine. Approved today to dig. Thank goodness I bought some LAC..

Those poor guys hoping for $190 by Friday. Weekly options are very risky. Patience is key here. Great company. Sit back and hold... watch your money grow.
Microsoft is the new Skywalker (JEDI)!
Very good buying option .. Thinking 5-10% up on Monday
One last thing...futures riding high for tomorrow...ugly day for short sellers.
I can’t believe I was able to buy more shares of Amd this am under 27.00. The implications of this are enormous we are talking about 300% increases in revenues for Amd. Watch it is 27.67 now where this goes in the next week when the big money  realizes what’s going to happen.. apple reporting 40% drop in multi threaded performance.9% drop in data center performance. Wait till Linus Torvalds responds to this !Amd epyc prices will be raised and it will be out of stock in no time..I can’t bielieve this and now I see why intel was rushing to buy companies outside of the cpu space.. Amd will soon own over 50% of this market.Buy all you can at this price level of 27.60. This new intel zombie bug  is going to be a windfall for Amd investors ! https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48278400$aapl $msft $bb $nvda
"Soon, be patient. MSFT will climb high and God bless all - most - of us. Tik Tok or no TT - keep your position."

msft got jedi contract and great earnings. at most the ftc is going to impose a small fine. buy the dip. this is a great price.
"If you believe MSFT is going to 200, you should’ve bought today. If you don’t believe MSFT is going to 200, you should’ve sold a while ago."

$230 is on deck. We were at $216 without TikTok 
WHOS MANIPULATING? LAST NIGHT WAS 10+
Never bet against Microsoft.
Will microsoft´s stock go up on Monday? Planning on buying before market closes today
The Fang selloff has created a great bargain in MSFT that is not dropping anymore as investors see MSFT as a cash machine in Cloud.
"I mentioned a week ago that in my opinion, $PINS is a takeover candidate. It turns out that I was spot on with that call as apparently $MSFT wanted them. Since the fantastic earnings call, that would have to be a big #. As a stand alone company, I am raising my price target on $PINS to $112.00 Trade green my friends [_] cheers [_]"
Minimum 60 points fall is sure shot.
Thank you Steve Ballmer for making MSFT languish for years on end allowing me to load up massive amounts of it's shares.
Another beautiful day. The 108 options were looking pretty bleak on Friday at 102. Up 5 points since then to 107.22. Sweet. How about another 5 points on Wednesday and Thursday? Why not :-) ! ! !
how is Royal Carribean Almost up the same amount as Microsoft is after hours ? that doesn't make any sense
This is a great company. Strong earnings and momentum. next week will be good.

this share price will finish below 212 which is where the shorts want it fir this week.. let me know how your 212 call finish ..my guess is out of the money
"Like AAPL, MSFT's EPS growth in 2021 is a weak 10%. Pass"
Don't sell companies that make money
A lot of investors trade on news and not in fact. This is a stall process for amazon. Pulling all the strings they can. Brought out the trump card and a judge appointed by Obama was all for playing it out. This is politic driven not fact driven.
"When I log in, msft now has a picture showing the ""I have a dream"" inscription in Washington DC.Yet at the same time, MSFT elites and other wealthy people from all over the world are meeting in Davos, trying to figure out how to keep wages and benefits low for workers all over the globe, and keep that dream from happening. We all see through it."
"I'm soooooo long on this stock. After looking at fundamentals the most important thing to me is management team. MSFT has a great mgt team that makes measured and bold decisions. There are a lot of co's that have terrible mgt teams and those co's always lag peers in return to investors, even if they have a great product."
Raymond James raises price target from $126 to $142.

I got 50 shares @ 180 and up 18%. Should I sell some to lock in profit or just let it ride longer?
treasury yield easing slightlypowell to speak @12:30.
What is going on AH
One of the best performing companies of 2020 and still so undervalued.. wow
BUY BUY BUY!!!
I don't get the after-hour reactions.... Was the growth in cloud sales not enough?
Amazon is using jay carney to publicize this Jedi thing? That seems very political. The dnc / deep state is using this to hurt Trump politically. Microsoft is stuck in the middle but will prevail.
"Smart investors knows, THE BEST time you buy undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD when they're down. Do your own homework and win big when you exit 2020."
Congratulations!!!!!
Easily 104 today and beyond!!
"Another stellar week from MSFT, the crown jewel of my portfolio "
"I got in heavily at 33, thinking about taking a little profit. Should I do it today or wait to see if they announce a dividend increase tonight? All thoughts appreciated."

Some people never learn selling Microsoft is wrong move.....
Today’s action means Nada. Just a mating dance until the ER. THEN we fly. Hehe. :))
I don't understand this stock move...!
"Opening at $240 plus today, hit like if you agree !"
Is MSFT readying a bid for MVIS?
What a tease that was
"I officially blew out of my 525 shares up $2 this morning. I've been riding this gravy train since 130s in July at 300 shares, bought more the day before earnings last month, and another 50 a few weeks ago. I gotta protect the profits. Qualified monies so no taxes on gains for a few decades. I did this cause I really believe WHO will call this a pandemic with the next country that tests positive and that will be another 1,000 point day drop. I'm going to be patient and just buy in lower. I'm in no rush. Im bummed though cause I love this name and the company itself if firing on all 12 cylinders. I'll be back in it big time. Sitting on dry powder for now."
When is 250 coming... today?
MAGA
"I tell you, better than buying bonds. MSFT pays dividend as well."
Microsoft has better lawyers than trump & Barr.
Holding up well considering the market today
Looks like I added to this one day early. Should have waited til tomorrow.
Cheap. Happy shopping.
"Microsoft closing in on 100,000 patents - I think the bubble gum seller (Amazon) has about 2000! Don't wonder or stress about the losing the JEDI contract - Microsoft was and is a much better choice."
Last couple days has shaken out the short termers and shorts so I think the climb back resumes next week
"Microsoft Corporation holds several positive signals and has broken the weak rising trend up. As the stock is also in great technical shape, we therefore consider it to be a good choice at these current levels and we are expecting further gains during the next 3 months. We have upgraded our recommendation for this stock since last evaluation from a Buy Candidate to a Strong Buy Candidate."
Lets go to $300 babbee.
msft Azure is THE fastest growing among the big 3

Loaded up on calls yesterday and made a huge unrealized profit so far. Why are people betting against Microsoft? Stay long and strong!
"Big boys will be pouring money into msft, and dumping money out of amzn."
"The Shorts really have their panties tied in a knot over this TikTok deal. Hehe. Can’t say I blame them. It will be earth shattering the amount of revenue TT will generate for MSFT. I hope the Shorts are wearing their adult pampers (as well as Zuckerberg) when this mouthwatering deal gets finalized, "
This week we will see a stock buy back announcement driving this stock even higher

"Tomorrow $MSFT will irrationally spike to $115 for a brief time. $AAPL being a direct competitor has fallen, and as such we shall expect $MSFT 's long overdue spike to happen tomorrow at market open and throughout the trading day. Prepare to capitalize when $MSFT hits $115."
"I wish Microsoft would try its hand again at the mobile devices market. It already produces a variety of surface devices including laptops and tablets. They need to install a mobile version of Windows 10X on the Surface Duo and develop software that allows developers to effortlessly convert their iOS and Android apps into Windows Apps. If their phones come with pre-installed suite of all their applications including Office Suite, Teams, LinkedIn — that might be an instant hit. I’m keen to leave the iPhone ecosystem, but the only alternative is a far inferior one. With the right strategy, the mobile market can pay off better than TikTok or Pinterest."
Big tech sell of Tom
"Barring drastic news, I see MSFT inching its way up to $200 by March."
I wish MSFT go up to $300/share !
115 in 24 hours
next week will be back up into the 140 range
Employment numbers on Friday and the senate exonerating Trump.....should bring this to $185;by the end if the week.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tik-tok-deal-doesnt-make-sense-for-oracle-beyond-politics-analysts-say-185640712.htmlPure manipulation. Why was Oracle “supported” by a politician to buy Tik Tok? Good riddance. Blessing in disguise for Microsoft.
"guys, this is the only thing you need to know about AMZN's earnings report: ""Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing division, generated $8.3 billion in the quarter, a jump of more than 35% over the same quarter last year."" And, for MSFT, we have: ""Azure posted revenue growth of 64%, and some naysayers call that “slowing down.” Who really cares about how much revenue AMZN made in it's e-commerce business. That's a low margin business."
Bottom on Microsoft- what number are you guys thinking? 115? Appreciate your thoughts
Price predictions for year end 2018 ? I think we will be over $118 !! I hope.
Opening at all-time high it appears..Azure cloud infrastructure is the preferred cloud site
"MSFT announces double stock buy back program. ""We are doubling our buy backs from what we previously stated. Stock is at bargain levels and we will take advantage of this."" Nadala"
MSFT partnering withMIME on cloud security. Win/win!!You can have your cake and eat it too!!
"people keep saying this is a safe place to put money. It sure doesn't feel like it. I'm not looking for massive gains short term, but I don't feel like 6-8 months is too much to ask for a little forward movement."

It is forming higher lows... its getting ready for break out!
I see $145 coming soon
When Microsoft crosses 200 percentage wise it will rally 2 to 5 dollars up like Apple and in no time will reach 350 like what Apple is doing Great time to buy as much as you can

"The fact is that the bears will use this to drive the price down. It’s what they do. If you’re long you won’t even care about the short term dip. For those looking for an entry point to by shares, you’ll probably get your chance in the morning..."
MSFT is trading like WMT. I'm hoping earnings is the catalyst for the next move higher! Both should be stellar but this is painful to watch every day.
"Just read the CC transcript. Guidance was very strong. Expecting double digit growth again for fiscal year 2020. Azure continues to expand and many new clients onboard. Linkedin continued to grow.

"Right spaces, right products right leadership at the right time. Go Msft!"
"Good dip, I liked the earnings so I bought in today at $103.5."
We could hit a new all-time high with a good earnings report tomorrow. Easily.
Big reversal.

"I’d be very scared if I err short this stock. This isn’t Netflix. They’re everywhere. The Cloud, business enterprise big time, and their acquisitions in the last year. Revenues should excel, but their guidance should be even bigger. Still say this is $130 by December."
I wish I bought at $25 3 years ago
What’s the reason behind for it to drop like this ???
"Interesting $msft has since closed the gap @ 178ish. It has also broken out of the trend that it has been in from the march 23rd lows. It seems to be forming a strong double top, and could drag $spy $qqq down with it. Not much conviction left to run after the gap closure, and this late into the bounce. Yesterday $msft beat top and bottom line, but rev. guidance was lower which isn't instilling confidence. Also did not make way for a run post earnings, and seems unaffected. Market seems to want to see strong revenue growth, and $msft did not deliver."
Never bet against it!

I love undervalued MSFT & Undervalued AMD...….
CNBC- Cramer just said if it weren’t for the caronavirus msft would be at 200 after last nights earnings report. It’s just a matter of time.

It's anybody's guess and that's become quite apparent.We will know a lot more after guidance on Thursday (or is it Wednesday?)"

I am and have been long on the stocks for many years and will continue to do so. I give no predictions, just feel it will move up with small gradual gains, are you patient enough? Great company, great future = great investment"
Another 20% tomorrow. Trump says MSFT will buy Tiktok. He said in his briefing today.This only creates more jobs. GL
What's wrong today? Dow is doing very well!!
MSFT will cede ground to IBM. Who will sign on with them knowing they'll in turn be hacked?
Been lovely seeing how MSFT has been performing recently
Does Amazon have any real basis on why Microsoft does not deserve the contract other than the President does not like Jeff Bezos. If not can Microsoft counter sue them and win so that we can get on with out lives
$230 soon and after earnings should see a leap up to $240. I’ve been long MSFT for about two years and have never seen it just consolidate like this for months. A move higher has to be coming
"Inflation is clearly here. Microsoft is unaffected by inflation largely. It’s stock should be too.. resilient business, infrastructure provider, huge cash hoard, low valuation compared to peers and considering growth.. so why is it tanking? Why does it struggle to regain losses when the market does? If it moves down on treasury yields rising then it’s not moving as it should.. this thing is stuck in such a range it’s unreal"
Why is it tanking so hard?
Nothing but madness since Joe took over...
THANK YOU BILL for creating this great company!!!!! Wish you a good retirement.
What has happened to MSFT??
cloud infrastructure and the world still uses Windows
"Just stellar ! My number one holding for some reason, best company in the universe"

"$MSFT should be $245 right now, This is not right. This stock is undervalued. There is some manipulation that is keeping this stock down."
"Microsoft stock jumped 2.7%, near 144.55, in premarket trading on the stock market today. It appears set to top its record high of 142.37, reached on Sept. 19. Microsoft stock has formed a second-stage, flat base with a buy point of 142.47, according to IBD MarketSmith charts."
Going back up

"No need to make a choice. Buy Apple, Microsoft & Amazon. You will be very happy."

If this fantastic deal goes through in September I can envision the Robin Hood Investors going crazy and pushing the stock along with everyone else to $250 by year end. IMHO 
We don't need them
Prepare for takeoff into the 250s and beyond shortly.
Dividend coming up means price is going to boost up more next week.
it's not 200 yet?I may jump in when it's below 200.
MSFT got the license to sell for Huawei and the stocks is still down?

"Does anyone know why Tesla keeps going up day after day, but Microsoft continues to stay undervalued?"
Just got this from Fidelity - Second day of spread trading in Microsoft(MSFT)August 3rd contracts ahead of earnings. 15K Aug 3rd 105 - 109 call spreads bought to open as shares hit record highs Tuesday. Shares off 95c to $105 Wednesday and 15K Aug 3rd 109 - 110 call spreads bought for 23.5c. The spread seems unrelated to the one from yesterday and targets a 4.7% move to $110 or better over the next 16 days. The company is due to report Thursday afternoon and has seen average daily post-earnings moves of 2.7% over the past eight quarters - an average skewed by a 6.4% spike on 10/27/17.

I have feeling that $MSFT will buy $CDNS since Microsoft decided to enter the chip design business. Or $SNPS will buy $CDNS to create a giant software IC design tools company.

Very undervalued at these levels. Market is manipulating. Great way to earn value. Doubt this will keep falling.
Fast money said sell? I missed it
Many media outlets still refer to Microsoft as Bill Gates’ company and some even show his photo in articles related to Microsoft. Never mind that he transitioned out in 2006 and that the brown Indian Satya Nadella has been at the helm since 2014 and is almost exclusively responsible for its spectacular growth since then. The hatred of the media against Indian Americans is so obvious that it makes me wonder if Microsoft would get more coverage if anyone other than an Indian American would be its CEO. Weird times.
"As an investor I love selloffs of great companies with strong balance sheets, great fundies and that generate lots of cash. MSFT is only down 10% from highs. Give me another 5% an I will start staggering buys again!! Already started in APPL."

2020 will be great again!
Best. Stock. Ever.
But call options ASAP before earnings. No brainer. Blowout earnings coming in 2 weeks
Satya is genius
I'm looking at long term year 2020 Microsoft might be towards 170 or 180 more so far this CEO it doing all the right things
"The most interesting aspect of the AMZN earnings report relevant to MSFT is AWS. Year over year, AWS increased sales by ca. 36% ($7.4 billion to $10.0 billion). This contrasts to the 62% gain in Azure, so MSFT is clearly doing extremely well in cloud and continuing to gain on AWS."
i'am a small investor i have a micro position on msft avg price 110 should i sell and take profit or wait and go long and add more if it goes down to 130? suggestion?

They know that. AAPL, TSLA are next on squeeze all shorties"

Tomorrow AAPL will turn the CROWN over to MSFT.

"Ignore the fake new - analysts telling you to sell MSFT $70, $80, $90 $100, $110, these dummy analysts not long ago used to say sell AMD at $10, $12, $ 14 $16, $18, $20, $25, $28.

"I talked about the scale metaphor before this is where mammoth  intel is on one side or pan of a scale and tiny AMD is in the other side Pan..Now as AMD at the top of the scale kept adding new features, power and continuous enhancements as well as enhanced security to their cpus building excitement, intel rested on its laurels, comfortable in their near monopoly positions.. but excitement has been building for AMD for quite some time now and near perfect execution and roadmaps have been swaying those with technical knowledge to choose AMD in ever increasing numbers. And now with their delivery of superior 7nm cpus the weight on the AMD scale is rapidly increasing as the weight on the intel side of the scale is decreasing by the exact same amount because intel and AMD are in a duopoly situation where ones loss is the others gain and vice versa., When the pans shift positions it is rapid and catch many by surprise.. only those closely watching the situation realize what is occurring... one way to confirm this movement is by stock price movements, another is by the press and a third by the excitement generated.. I think all of these combine to create the inflection point that Lisa spoke about almost 70 days ago... many in denial as is always the case Nokia looked invincible until rimm blackberry with its tiny keyboard and powerful antennas and low battery consumption squashed them and the excitement of new users was plainly evident. Invincible blackberry was squashed by apples touch screen and GUI interface as blackberry stockholders and execs were in denial about apples threat while customers of the iPhone were buying its stock as rapidly as possible.. AMD is marching along a similar trajectory today with an ever increasing and excited customer base and moving ever closer now to the launch of the 7nm EPYC datacenter server that is going to capture a major percentage of Intels crown  jewel 5 Billion per quarter datacenter business within a few weeks.. the pans of the scale are moving rapidly now and the early adopters already are forcing wall st to realize what is going on.. again I encourage all to buy and hold over time with no margin or options for this game while being planned for many years by AMD is only in the very early innings with the underdog team starting to score goals rapidly while the undisputed leader is playing without a goalie in the net...$BB $AMZN $MSFT $NVDA"

"US government should be hiring MSFT to protect Americans fro these foreign cyber attacks. All this happening as China cancels the cyber attack truce with the USA.By David Scheer and Dina Bass February 28, 2019 It’s a short -- but startling -- passage tucked inside Microsoft Corp.’s periodic cybersecurity report: State-sponsored hackers attacked several financial services firms and stole “large sums of cash.”The account provides another reminder that hackers are successfully preying on parts of an industry where customer confidence is paramount, and that’s sometimes reluctant to disclose serious attacks. Yet even as the report lays out what happened, it omits sensitive details, such as which government backed the assault or which firms were targeted.Microsoft said it knows about the case because its experts helped victims in the aftermath. In a series of similar incidents, hackers gained administrative access to computer systems by infecting a machine with a “highly targeted, obfuscated backdoor implant,” possibly with a spear-phishing email. Then they sent cash to foreign accounts. In some instances, the hackers went undetected for more than 100 days, and once found, unleashed malware on the victims’ systems, halting operations.FireEye Inc., another cybersecurity firm, described a similar series of attacks in a report published about five months ago. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on whether the incidents are related.In that report, FireEye said a North Korean hacking group had infiltrated more than 16 firms in 11 countries including the U.S., stealing more than $100 million. The group’s victims included a Chilean bank that lost $10 million last May. North Korean diplomats and official media have denied that the country plays any role in cyber attacks."

I don’t understand. Target price is around ~ 275 and it’s at 244 right now. That doesn’t seem too undervalued? The target price seems low IMO. What do you guys think? I bought in late at 240; is a target price of 320s a stretch if everyone is saying it’s super undervalued?
up 7.00 after hours today. 57m shrs shorted.
Msft forward EPS is under 28. It is reliable and good value.
Wedbush Raises Target As It Predicts Cloud Services Will Lift Microsoft Above Wall Street Estimates
Msft on its way up to target of $272-$300. Just give it 3-4 years.
Buy #NEXCF. Gates and the gang working with young AR company soon to uplist to NASDAQ.
Gains from yesterday gone again. Nothing new here.
I think they should come back to the phone market.
"MSFT's profit margin is 33.6% and Apple's is 21.4%, so MSFT's profit margin is 12% higher; something to remember. I can remember when J&J's profit margin was (and still is) 17%. My, how times have changed! AI and Technology are the present and future big winners!"
"Let me repeat, the undervalued stocks MSFT, AMD......... has lots of room to run, I Epyc Azure you."
Doesn't seem to be moving much given the news. I will take that as a good sign of investor confidence.
What time is the earnings call / webcast (UK) time?
"I have 139 and 141 calls on this one, riding till Friday hopefully it reaches 143-145"
Stuck on FB call....how is the MSFT call going?
Similar breakout Apple had a little over a year ago. 1)Break out to new highs 2) Backtest of prior highs 3) brisk run to 300 then to 330.
"Just incredible figures, I was expecting excellent numbers but not that good!"
China market up solid right now. Been watching this come near the moving averages and bounce but not break either way. Tomorrow could be the beginning of the breakout I've been looking for since October. $135 by July - make up all that lost ground!
Another down day
"With $MSFT closing all of their US retail locations, they should partner with $JWN for a mini pop up shop. That would be killer around the holidays. Nordstrom and Microsoft are also both in Seattle. It’s make a lot of sense. Buy high end clothes and test/buy high end tech gadgets. $AMZN"
This stock has gotten up around $224 four times since October and each time it drops right back down. Hopefully the earnings will be good and help break that resistance so we can actually make some money.
Save some run for tomorrow. I need at least 240 by Friday.
Pull back is not expected anytime this week. The RSI value is only 65. GLTA longs.
"To any newbies, dont listen to what people think the market is heading. This volatility is pretty confusing for even Wall Street analysts and also do you really think 'experts' would be in a yahoo finance board? Do your own DD and come to your own conclusions."
my guess is 2.01 EPS. I’m taking bets who wants in
"Facebook’s WhatsApp and Messenger are blocked in China. Communist China created a ""great firewall"" to prevents its citizens from freely accessing the worldwide web, where online communication is routinely monitored and censored. I think POTUS deeply believes “Tear down China’s great firewall” will not only keep America safe, help U.S National security but also liberate billions of Chinese to the free world."
"THE market must be scared of UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS TOMORROW. If we sell off big tomorrow, I’ll be add more MSFT"
With e3 coming up and rumours of a new console being announced I think their share price will increase.. as to whether it’ll stay up is another question

"MSFT will have something for all ages with TikTok. Gaming, computers, cloud. What’s not to like"
Microsoft forever worst thing you could ever do is panic sell remember that.
great er... this thing will be up 15% by end of month...booooom
"Lost 400% on my Call options in MSFT, stock is DOWN 4 FROM MINUTES AGO"
good word advice keep buying Microsoft
Earnings coming soon...think Azure cloud growth
Looked like a quick sell off from news now rising back up
Is 1 share good
5 years. look at the 5 years chart. that is all you need.
Good to know that earnings still matter!
I bought when it was at $28 and Ballmer was busy buying Nokia. Glad I stayed the course. This company is the company of the future. It is big but nimble at the same time. They are heavy on knowledge but light on hard assets that require a lot of capital spending.
Day traders be careful still undervalued.
Just close your screens and come back next week
Bullish as can be.!
There trying to get you to sell before it takes off again.. Don't fall for it...
Why is it dipping?
buy and hold it's a nice steady ride up and up.
"Satya Nadella was made the CEO of MSFT based on his qualification and experience, Steve Ballmer was made the CEO because he and Bill Gates were buddies, Unfortunately this kind of buddy buddy system goes on in many businesses and you can see what a disaster it usually is. I never invested in Microsoft under Ballmer. Unfortunately I waited too long to invest in Microsoft after the new CEO came in.. Any way better late than never."
Just getting started.. MFST has a long ways to go.. 140 before to long...
msft stock had great run for 2020. It is my choice for 2021. Enjoy the ride
Crazy days ahead.Global Supply chain will definitely be disrupted from coronaChina. 30% bear 70% bull. stock market will recover
The only stock on tech to stay green. wow
"MSFT is probably one of the best tech stocks I think for 2019, AMZN being the other one. Currently long both. Bought MSFT on recent pull back at and below $85. Believe the recent recovery will probably hit around $95. Will get out all the newly acquired stocks then to build capital. This year market volatility is high will need to do trading to protect the gains."
Pull up the charts of tons of old big tech clearly massive pe contraction is starting and there are not enuff real buyers after a year of fake green futures nighthly by the fed there is alot less support underneath than any of u understand $qqq $aapl $msft / fed likely wants market goong down so bond slide stops too: )
I’m sad I bought more last week and this week is on big discounts :(
Congrats to Microsoft shareholders on the contract win. This is one stock I wish I had in my portfolio. Maybe when there’s a correction I’ll pick up some shares...
Google beat! 99% chance msft beats as well!!
$250 is a No Brainer for this equity!
Wow!
"I’m going to do a little analysis. For reasons to buy and keep faith. 1. Microsoft is expanding the reach of its Arc hybrid-cloud platform to Red Hats kubernetes-focused OpenShift and Enterprise Linux. This will allow management of applications to be simplified and easier to run across platforms. 2. They will be able to use Arc to run Azure data services on OpenShift, Microsoft is expanding to multi-cloud environment why? It’s simpler for those that aren’t familiar with cloud and more data storage as well no cluster and no fuss easy navigation is the future. 3. They are adapting their AI capabilities to allow users to find all possibilities and all solutions to equations, problems, and anything of that sort. 4. ZOOM is bound to back out of oracle agreement and go with Microsoft Azure cloud. 5. Xbox game pass numbers are growing rapidly and currently are at 10 million subscribers. They are doing better than all competitors. 5 million , EA, 1 million, PlayStation , Nvidia , 1 million users. They have 23 million friends on Xbox live which is a 70% growth in friendship rate. Xbox live active users jumped nearly 90 million in one quarter. 6. They plan to reach 2 billion gamers in the world. 7. Microsoft is thinking about teaming up with Apple to further their gaming platform. 8. Analysts have this stock to reach 200 dollars median price by the next quarter."
"The shorts will not touch MSFT, AAPL, AMD...After great earnings buy the dips, relax and enjoy!"
Bought more at 242!!!!!!!!!

Revising SP estimate to hit $120 by next Friday for sure.
"Earnings: $1.38 per share, excluding certain items, vs. $1.25 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.Revenue: $33.06 billion, vs. $32.23 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv."

Save us Mighty MicroSoft. You’re our only hope

30x forward earnings with the company exposing tens of thousands of companies to hacking? Sell.
"Over 4 years 100% of my undervalued Microsoft dividend goes directly to undervalued AMD. Win win bigger win situation, Do you own DD and be rewarded and happy."
NEVER SELL...
Sigh wish I bought more!
"It’s baffling to see that under performers continue to stabilize and even rise, but straight A companies seem to be battling just not to fall too hard.Everything is hype or fear and the retail investors in general fall into each pocket on the way. Whereas the professionals put their CFA designations to the side and just ride off of the emotions of the retailers."
... We will be green tomorrow.
Thanks panic sellers for letting me buy some cheap shares at $153. Nice doing business with you.
Wedbush raises target to $150
Satya Nadella has been worth every penny they pay him. To change course and put numbers like this together on the non-windows brands is extraordinary.
steady as she goes upward
When the rest of the market crashes people will rush into safe haven stocks to secure their capital. Not a perma bear but I’m certainly viewing my MSFT position as a long term hold in my portfolio.
I bought another 10 shares at 161.95. I will buy more when it dips again. This will be green soon enough.
"Deutsche Bank analyst Karl Keirstead raised his price target for Microsoft (MSFT) to $160 from $155 after the Department of Defense announced ""an enterprise general-purpose cloud contract"" to the company. This was a ""rather understated phrase to announce what could be the largest cloud contract award in history,"" Keirstead tells investors in a research note. The analyst views this as a ""huge upset victory"" for Microsoft over Amazon Web Services (AMZN). He affirms a Buy rating on Microsoft shares."
je is the perfect company for bill gates to get involved with for his new venture in energy
I have been a short for many stocks but Msft..is a long term thing. All those getting $100 today will regret later.
Those who don't buy at 106~ are missing out on huge payout ....

"My ultimate dream is to see Tesla, The Boring Company and SpaceX form a joint venture with Microsoft. Musk’s companies would use Azure and AI.

The thing with Microsoft is that it’s always a good time to buy.
"the problem is if you sell now you will likely have a huge loss you cant sell now is better to wait for a 2% recover today and hope for a better next week,i think msft will finally recover from this fall with the future projects, but honestly I don't understand why msft is having this huge sell off with strong fundamentals while tesla that is at least 800% overpriced with very weak earnings isnt dropping like this, I don't understand this incredible"
"Lots of ""investors"" here wondering why a stock that's already moved up sharply doesn't do that every day. HAHAHA! You guys need to pick up some GameStop."
Msft from this point on is a sure thing with reliable upward earning growth.
Commvault is presentting on Facebook Live with MSFT today on latest developments with Azure & AI tools to explain how tcustomers can gain more value from data and customers can test Azure and Commvault for free to see the benefits. Azure is the future & better than AWS.

"One year ago Microsoft was at 66 dollars, now it's worth less not more.$47 to $57 is a good target."
MSFT bought github and has tons of new innovations it plans to implement using block chain technology. Way undervalued! Great investment!!!
Can one say MANIPULATION
Best company in the whole history of humanity

Holy smoke! Yes!
"Doggie calls John Chen a failure yet BB is up ~160% since he took the helm. Let’s see, Chen: 1. Completed a a successful turnaround of company that was on the verge of BK into a 2. Nearly tripled software revenues3. Set up QNX to play a key role in Autonomous driving 4. Brought in hundreds of millions with patent license agreements5. Stock now at 4 year highs and up ~160% since he took the helm."
Finally $100 Welcome to the $100 club!
All-time highs on the horizon!
I think it will hit $150 next week.
"Microsoft earnings beat: $1.38 per share, vs $1.25 expected EPS"
@BarryB muted spreading limitles amount of #$%$ and nonsence.
When earnings release Microsoft will be one of the cheapest stock
Microsoft is the greatest company ever! Try and change my mind.
"Bought this stock at 227 and it dropped right after, any ideas when it will start to rise consistently?"
Anyone notice how WRONG Yahoo Finance has the ttm PE? It show it as 45 when it is actually about 26.That is because Yahoo is terrible at updating the EPS each quarter. Beware of using Yahoo's data.
"MSFT is like a coiled snake about to spring. MSFT for those of us in it for a long time know, will make a majority of its yearly move in a short timeframe. If you are not in it you will miss out before you can blink."
Unless you bought when Bill was splitting shares every 6 months...this stock today is simply a place to park money and for Bill to sell a few billion here and there for philanthropy. It has no value other than that. Place to park money and watch it gather dust. There are better growth stocks.
Nasdaq futures down 100 pts now. What do you think Msft will fall to tomorrow 110 to 112 like usual.. rinse wash repeat anyone Hahaha 
Nice day for MSFT.
SA article...Wedbush thinks MSFT could beat out AMZN for Pentagon cloud contract. :)
Apparently some Investors nervous going into the weekend. Who knows what Trump or China can say. And what of the stimulus package. If there was any significant pullback to MSFT Apple or Amazon I would add with both hands but I doubt it. I don’t sell stocks as that strategy has served me well for decades. I’ll let others time the market and trade in and out. 
"I was going to sell my shares but I didn't I hope this market come back to fundamentals and people start investing on companies that are really worth like msft,amazon,apple, Disney and some others small companies that are doing everything right to keep growing, nobody can explain why Microsoft has had 2 huge drops in the last days, if there is a company that doesn't deserve this bs is msft"
Nice to hold above $120. Major breakout coming
The great thing about MSFT is you know year after Year it will give you these solid returns. And with their strength in the Cloud and Edge Computing the story just continues and gets stronger.
Buy & Hold. Should be $200 once all the weak hands are shaken off.STAY LONG & BE STRONG
Buy more before the close and AAPL reports or hold out that AAPL misses and this goes down more?
The current state of affairs with people being told to work from home if possible and the scientific research that must goes into finding cures and solutions - these things just highlight the need for folks to to have computers. This need isn't going to slowdown. Long and Strong MSFT
Train about to leave get on board
Nice end to the day... Great to see 4% uplift from yesterday's shocker. Go MSFT!
"On the daily looking at a support off strong trend line, stoch is over sold and MACD looks like a reversal is in place, could be a nice buy."
"Nice lift before earnings, love this stock, open source getting to bed with everyone. GITHUB is going to be very interesting to see how this is managed and monitised, this could be a Diamond in the rough for MSFT.. Satya is such a strategist this guy appears to be two steps ahead of the mkt, I'm convinced he can see around corners! Lol"
"At the present moment this company appears to be very valuable.... they’re offering a service that enables people to work from home, they’re stepping up their gaming service and they have defense contracts . The fact that they beat estimates by nearly 3 billion dollars during horrible economic times says it all ..."
MSFT is one of the most successful companies ever created and has evolved to being a premier cloud developer...support it
"Microsoft's balance sheet finished Q2 2019 with more than $54 billion in net cash. Given that Microsoft is extremely free cash flow generative, and that it doesn't need much capital to continue to grow, this allows Microsoft to have one of the best capital return programs.More specifically, Q2 2019 saw Microsoft return to shareholders $9.6 billion via dividends and share repurchases. To put this bold capital return into perspective, the last six months have seen Microsoft return to shareholders roughly 75% of the total return Microsoft made to shareholders during its FY 2018."
Fed up from this slow move
Read the news solarwinds says $msft source code and cloud was hacked and compromised very bearish for the bubble called microscoft $aapl
Pretty rough! MSFT picked the wrong day to announce! Everything went perfectly wrong: Bad FOMC sentiment and a massive short squeeze - forcing the big investors to re-calibrate and de-risk.Took my profits this AM at $238 and I am completely out of the market. Hope you did the same!My advice: You prob should wait and see what happens with GME and AMC before you put any money into this market. It seems like it will inevitably fall and it could/will have a BIG effect on the rest of the market.
Microsoft - The greatest stock ever.
GitHub will be a great buy for MSFT. Making all the right moves. $165 is my new price guidance.
MSFT is just too awesome
I guess the market didn’t really care about the JEDI ruling. Go MSFT 
Anyone focusing on a tax loss is missing the big picture. What they should be focused on is 98% cloud growth.
Best stock in my portfolio. Thank you Mr Nardella.
"Well we're moving on up, to the sky...."
Future GM owners might get blue screen crashes! Hahaha. Oh man! And need to CTRL-ALT-DEL

On our way to 100 finally.
Hope Microsoft climbs till it splits. I’m loving this stock right now and just got in on Apple as well.

"Even with the drawdown the last two days MSFT and other mega tech investors still exhibiting euphoria even with the excessive multi trillion dollar valuations. JEDI contract only amounts to $1 billion in annual revenues, peanuts for a company sporting a nearly 2 trillion market cap.

You would think Yahoo could control the Chinese Spam with a few well placed filters.

"Hold it for your life, Microsoft will triple.Top ERP Systems for 2019 going strong? #1: Microsoft Dynamics 365. A few years ago, the Microsoft Dynamics product roadmap and ecosystem were a mess. Choosing between Great Plains, Navision, Axapta, and other options was very confusing — even for resellers and system integrators. With the Dynamics 365 platform, however, Microsoft finally has a cohesive cloud ERP strategy. Though the product lacks the maturity of NetSuite and other native cloud ERP offerings, it is a very flexible and scalable solution with relatively easy integration to third-party systems. Organizations large and small are quickly adapting the platform. The offering’s biggest weaknesses are the fragmented and loosely managed ecosystem, relative immaturity of the cloud solution, and flexibility that can be a curse during a transformation. Large companies looking to standardize operations or move to a centralized shared services model may not find the product to be a good fit.#2: SAP S/4HANA. This system has a large market share, especially among Fortune 1000 companies. While the product is relatively immature as the company continues to migrate functionality from its ERP Central Component and other legacy SAP products, it continues to be a de facto option for large organizations that want to scale and standardize. Relative to other options in the market, the system’s framework offers the potential to provide better real-time analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The biggest things holding it back from the #1 spot? The system is often overkill for smaller and mid-size organizations, and SAP failures such as Lidl continue to cast a dark shadow.#3: Oracle NetSuite. The Oracle-owned company was the pioneer of cloud ERP. Unlike Salesforce and Workday, NetSuite has always focused on addressing broader ERP functionality, including financials, inventory management, CRM, HCM, and light manufacturing. A decade ago, NetSuite was a good option primarily for small and some mid-size companies. While that’s still the case, we are seeing more demonstrated scale of the product at upper-mid-market and larger organizations. It continues to broaden and deepen its functionality to meet the needs of manufacturing, project management, forecasting, and other advanced functions traditionally limited to the bigger ERP systems.#5: Salesforce and #4: Workday. Microsoft got a head start and fully gearing up to compete with Google Stadia will turn an Xbox Live sub into Game Pass Ultimate for $1 https://www.cfo.com/enterprise-resource-planning/2018/11/what-are-the-top-erp-systems-for-2019/"
why is Microsoft down? most tech stocks that were down are up now
I'm not a huge fan of Trump but his announcement about continued stimulus over the weekend shows that they don't want to rattle markets Monday morning with further indecision. So he gets a rare thumbs up from me.
I’m glad I held on to some shares over the weekend
"It will get worse my friends. Keep in mind WHO still hasn't called this a pandemic yet. That announcement alone is worth 1,000 points. The other shoe has yet to drop. Please protect your profits. You can always buy back later."
#MSFT and #AAPLMicrosoft and Apple are the best company and it will not effect by who ever won the election! Still Trump has 50% chance to win so Never worry!! HOLD for long!!!

"Stanley has boosted its target on Microsoft (MSFT +1.1%) and reiterated its Overweight rating, pointing to margin potential vs. concerns about product cycles and cloud revenues.• The company's likely to see expanding margins and ""durable double-digit gross profit growth,"" analyst Keith Weiss says.• Combined with buybacks and a dividend, that means a sustainable total return in the mid-to-high teens, a CAGR that's ""underpriced at current levels,"" he writes.• The firm raised its target to $189 from $157, now implying 19% upside."
MSFT....reach for the clouds...your cloud..expect very positive earnings
"great move today, but where have I seen this movie before? let's see after the earnings announcement. All the pundits put this stock @ 250+ but it's not translating in trades. I love this stock but frankly do not have any confidence in these spikes. It tends to drop just as quickly. See last week as exhibit A."

The selloff is across the board and exaggerated. The fundamentals of the company hasn't changed. We have seen this trend multiple times after a tweet.
This over reaction by the bond ghouls will pass and the 10 year will chill and big tech especially Microsoft are well positioned to move much higher. Stay long stay strong 
how about this genius move buy Microsoft and hold for years
The shorts are getting out fast. This should go up $19-$26

"""Microsoft Likely to Beat Wall Street Estimates on Cloud Growth - Wedbush""$260 PT"
MSFT has a strong tailwind.
190 friday
When will msft buy mvis?
MSFT WILL CLIMB IN TO THEIR 2ND QUARTER EARNINGS SCHEDULED FOR THE 2ND WEEK OF JULY 2019!!!
Taking out the 52 week high this week. Bank on it.
Bye bye 170s.
Believe the blockchain announcement that Microsoft recently announced is going to lift Microsoft share price a lot more than people realize.
"It was a very good strategy this time: Msft went down right after earnings; otherwise this would have been big, big sell-off by shorts who wanted to #$%$ up the benefit then run away, leaving more harm to the company and to the long term investors....We can wait until the dust settles down,,,,,,"
5% after earning and this stock reaches a pinnacle mark at $100
MSFT will stand tall through this market downturn 
Destroys earnings —> Price goes downFunny.
Corporations large and small will most likely use their tax savings to speed up migration to cloud to improve productivity. Major cloud service providers such as Azure will benefit the most. So outlook is very bright for MSFT !
Great weekend for the DOD!Picked the best cloud partner and nailed the leader of ISIS!Monday the stock market shall roar!
Buying........
it's a perfect BUY day today
"$200 in a year, calling it!"

"After Najarian said buy the 237.50 calls on Tuesday, I almost took a put. I should have. This one will test 200 before it touches 250. Who'd go long on a Nasdaq stock now?:?"
"Interesting that so many analysts raised their target price AFTER Microsoft’s earnings. Looks like they were caught by surprise, just like most people. To me, that’s a very positive medium term and long term sign."
10% up tomorrow or shorts will put this down.
"MSFT will go up to $110 on July 20, as Q2 result will be excellent"
Good thing I sold 100shares@ $242.50 strike price.

Kiplinger had an article... 85% of the time stocks in a positive market will only drop 3 days then bounce back... i have learned a lesson... this is true 85 % of the time... that is good odds! DON'T WORRY... DON'T WET THE BED... msft is ok. make 15% a year... you win !!!! this is a marathon not a sprint.
Negative premarket slowly heading toward positive market territory.
I spent quite a bit of time muting people today -- I'd like to thank them for making it easy by using AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF ALL CAPS!
MSFT should have been up at least 50.
Political instability will control the market for the short term but MSFT is a great bet for the future where tech reigns supreme.
Buy the dip ny friends -- just like the pros.
MFST just keeps going up.. steady as she goes..
"Rumors Pentagon may pull 10B dollar JEDI deal, don't know if that hurts stock price or not."

Microsoft is firing on ALL cylinders - my goodness get on board or get out of the way! Short argument does not stand a chance here.

a couple of teenagers using nothing more than a toaster and some tin foil hacked into MSFT most secure computers. not good.
"I wonder how many stop loses got taken out with that brief drop below $100 post ER... $150 stock and you put a $100 stop loss I guess it serves you right, go long or get out of the market"
Just put a down payment on a boat I’ve been eyeing. I’m that confident in this report.
The news is final. MSFT wins Jedi
The best earning ever! better than even JP Morgan!
"I just refinanced the home to plug more into microsoft , apple and roku. i expect nice gains for months to come. I had such a huge increase in home value , i could not pass it up. California market for you"

"Most of Yahoo! news articles aren't worth reading anymore since they removed the blogs. What's the world coming to when when you can't critique how journalists are reporting the news.BTW, nothing's wrong with MSFT. It's getting caught up in the bloodletting with the other major players. In a day from now, a week from now, or a month from now the tone of the news will change and by the end of the year, no one will even remember what happened in February."
Revenue: $33.1 billion versus $32.2 billion expectedAdjusted earnings per share: $1.38 versus $1.24 expectedIntelligent cloud division: $10.85 billion versus $10.44 billion expected
just bought more
To all those broke posters bashing MSFT who is wishing MSFT go down a little more so they can buy it and then post religiously how under value MSFT it is. The question to you all is “can you afford not to buy MSFT at this level?”
"I suggest y?all listen to the last earnings call. Rest #$%$ured, we?ll see new highs by next month."
Microsoft is more than capable at continuing to thrive while working at home. Increasing my position every down day
"Selloff looks a bit skittish, looks like under $134 is the place to start picking up some shares, just a bit boring watching the paint dry"
Praying for pullback!!
"Thumbs up if you Believe MSFT will surge too 100+ after ratings date, and thumbs down if you Believe it won’t increase much from here and it will take a breather"
May I ask ..Not sure if anyone knows-How is Microsoft mesh different from ARHTF technology?
Buy for earnings. Will be a blowout quarter!
As the market corrects I plan to add big to my MSFT holdings. It held up good today until the later hours. I added 300 share at close to the end of the day. Did I start buying too early in this market correction?
Anyone else hear a rumor that MSFT is considering buying out Zoom and adding it to their teams platform?
ER Conference Call at 5:30 pm EST

"Out of the entire stock market I would trust my money here in $MSFT. In fact, this stock is one that you can day trade, momentum trade, or hold long. If you have any patience at all you always end up green."
"Msft gaps up from $234.18, will the gap ever be filled?"
Boom goes the dynamite.
Wow very impressive MSFT!

Up 4K today thank you Microsoft  I don’t know where we are headed tomorrow but I’ll optimistic.

AMD chips are not affected by the PERFORMANCE robbing Meltdown flaw and they are the only competitor to INTEL in the x86 space therefore AMD stands to gain huge as the truth comes out on how much performance will be lost with Intel fix for meltdown.

Looks like someone got the earnings report a little early. (Isn't that illegal?)
Calls for a beer! Or maybe the champers!
"From an article in ZDNet from August 15, 2017 — Ballmer has a larger stake in $MSFT than Bill. So I really don’t understand why the media insists on discussing Bill’s “thoughts” on the pandemic, Elon / Tesla, climate change, Texas power outage, social media suspension of a former President, or whatever the news of the day is, when one is looking up for news on Microsoft. I am NOT interested in knowing Bill’s thoughts. I’m capable of doing my own research on current events/news.Also, IMO, Satya is the best CEO Microsoft has ever had. I’m glad that Satya focuses on doing his job. Activism is for people to hide their own inadequacies or who have a vested interest in the outcome."
all time high
"After 3 months, the bear market his behind us."
any predicted price after earning ?
"Warren Buffet, should sell AAPL and buy undervalued AMD, MSFT."
MSFT save the market today
We need an investigation in the NASDAQ INC. for rigging the exchange. On every down day because of low volume they drop the prices significantly in order to get people to trade and make them money. Check for yourself: $NDAQ at all time highs today whereas $IXIC slumps. IF this game ain't rigged to the core I don't know anymore. ALGOS + NDAQ Exchange collusion? You bet... $baba $tsla $aapl $momo $msft $dji $pltr $fb $goog $jd $nflxSEC please step it and go after the algo traders and exchanges. The fish always starts smelling bad at the head.
"For long term investors, a $10-15 drop will hardly matter. I was concerned couple of months ago, but let’s just remember, Microsoft is quite nimble, almost like a startup. That makes it efficient and helps deliver STRONG GROWTH quarter after quarter. Most investors who do their research know that we are seeing only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Cloud, AI / Machine Learning. We still have no clear idea how much will the revenue and profits grow. In my estimate, Cloud will grow exponentially for the next 4-5 years before the competition becomes tight. Also, people need to understand that there are different cloud offerings. Companies like CRM offer software on cloud. Microsoft OTOH provides Cloud Infrastructure, Platform, and Software Services and hence, has a far bigger portfolio than most other Cloud service providers. Also, Microsoft’s offerings are far more sophisticated than a data center. It offers AI services to its customers which is a significant value add.TL;DR — Microsoft is unique and has successfully differentiated itself from the competition. It’s business is likely to grow significantly as more and more customers see Microsoft’s broad portfolio of value added services."
"HELLO, I AM MICROSOFT'S NEWEST ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT. I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS!"
I have a feeling we will see this at 212 today
"Microsoft is number #26 on the Fortune 100. That's right. There are 25 companies with more revenue in the US alone. Yet Microsoft trades at a valuation greater than Walgreens, Kroger, Ford, GM, CVS, Cardinal Health and Walmart COMBINED"
It’s a long term game. If you’re feeling uneasy after one week of average performance you should sell. I remember this exact situation in the 190 range. It will all work out long term
Predictions for market close tomorrow? Since we're at new highs everyday might close out the week on a high note.
Heading to $102 tomorrow.
Read the article on the summary page. Microsoft looks forward to cooperating with the FTC and is not considered a target by the FTC. Nothing to worry about and a total overreaction yesterday!!!

"I am okay to hold this for long term...but, a clueless guy is going to take the WH...high tax, more regulations, free education, and free stuff, they are going to print money like anything for next 4 years!!"

Been a while since I looked at my MSFT shares. It's now a 1 trillion dollar company by market cap. Cool beans. I'm now going back into hibernation
PT raised to $200 Monday morning by several analysts..........thank you Dept of Defense.
Today is a good day to load up more. ER will pop!
Down $4 pre market. $201. That is $9 below where we open yesterday and $4 from the close. At the open it looks like we are going to making a new low for the month. Quite honestly I do not understand the reaction from the Fed. Keeping rates low for years is a positive not a negative for stocks. Anyhow the correction continues and I must admit I am getting concerned.

If maker keeps up especially with China deals next week and NK MSFT will climb to 115+ even hitting 118 before earnings then they will beat with cloud and stock will pull another 4+ and it will settle around 123-125 then an upgrade of 180

At 98 he didn't recommend buying the stock. Now with the shares at 128, he recommended purchasing MSFT. I'm glad that I didn't listen to him last June and did buy 400 shares."
I think LONG MSFT short AMZN might work
10BILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT SAFE AND SOUND WITH MICROSOFT! SORRY BOZOS! THIS WILL RISE LIKE FRESH BAKED BREAD TODAY AND TOMORROW

Typical MSFT behavior after earnings. No surprise here.

"Calm down guys, 50MA is solid resistance for MSFT. NEVER sell your share to those bear. MSFT will soar to 230 this year guaranteed!"
Watch MSFT become the first 2T company. Wouldn't you laugh if it did this within the next 24 months. The cloud space is that large and what the analysts fail to realize is that there are still 3/4 the worlds industries not computerized how they could be.

So guys is that good time to buy MSFT stock right now.? Can anybody suggest

"Only thing helping short term is analyst(s) reaffirmation that MSFT is doing well. Other than that all money is going to the companies institutions think will shoot up quickly over the next couple of days/weeks. It's not that institutions are dumping Microsoft, they are just moving part of their portfolio to the run ups of FB, AMD, and AMZN to name a few. Hell, I would do the same if a large portion of my portfolio wasn't tied to Microsoft. Microsoft will be range bound between $100 and $110 until next ER. I'll pause so you all can dislike my post because I'm not pounding the table screaming $120 in two days."
"Is it worth buying 10 shares of MSFT right now? Also, I don’t understand how dividends work. What is the current dividend yield if I buy 10 shares and hold for a year? I’m not buying for dividends of course, just curious"

Microsoft can spend this free cash flow on dividends and share repurchases to benefit shareholders.So what do share buybacks do for MSFT stock shareholders?Buybacks Bring Many BenefitsBuybacks help MSFT stock keep climbing. Microsoft is constantly in the market buying shares. Microsoft bought back 150 million shares in the year to June. This represents about 2% of its total prior shares outstanding. So over time with less supply and with constant demand, the price rises.The buyback activity also keeps Microsoft stock from drastically falling out of bed. It is not uncommon for large corporations like MSFT to take advantage of market breaks. They become buyers of last resort in a sense. They buy more when their stock is cheap. This provides a sense of security to investors.In addition, dividends per share increase over time. For the same dollar amount spent on dividends, the dividend per share can be increased. Another way to put it is buybacks allow the dividend per share to rise faster.Shares repurchased allow earnings per share calculations to rise since the denominator falls. This helps the stock have a lower price-to-earnings ratio. It can lead to a higher stock valuation if the market reprices the stock to its former P/E ratio.Share repurchases also sterilize the increase in shares from stock options and restricted stock issued to employees and consultants. In fact, some large companies like Microsoft have separate buyback programs just to “fund,” so to speak, these share grants.Finally, buybacks increase the remaining shareholders’ stake in the company. This is important for large shareholders and also when the company spins off assets to its shareholders.Bottom Line on MSFTMicrosoft has $11.6 billion left in its present share repurchase program. I expect that MSFT will complete the program by the end of this calendar year.Expect Microsoft to announce another higher share repurchase program before then. I suspect it will be larger than the previous $40 billion buyback program which started in December 2016.As of this writing, Mark Hake, CFA does not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

"What I like about microsoft is the strong balance sheet and the diversity of it's revenue with approximately 1/3th from the cloud, 1/3th from business applications and 1/3th from the more personal computing division. In my point of view Microsoft looks like a sort of holding company on it's own with a cash balance of 100 bn there still are a lot of opportunities for this company , especially when markets are lower, to find interesting acquisitions for a reasonable price...Bullish on the long run , neutral on the mid term (will go down with the rest of the market)"

"MSFT & AMD will do great this year............ MSFT over $100.00, AMD over $50.00 ."
"As a long term shareholder I can tell you exactly what will happen to Microsoft this week. Here's what my crystal ball of (insert obligatory cuss word here) says:Apple will provide poor guidance and earnings on Tuesday, while blaming China for no longer buying its products, requiring MSFT to fight for its life to hold its 50DMA (which is roughly $104.90 today). Microsoft will most likely lose that battle (as it's been fighting all day to hold the 50DMA due to news from CAT and NVDA... seriously?). Microsoft will provide its usual solid earnings beat but will state that even though cloud growth is still good, it is not compounding on itself like it use to. Anticipate a small 3-5% pop, pushing it back over the 50DMA. Amazon will miss the following day on either guidance or modest earnings beat and Microsoft will be tested yet again at the 50DMA. Powell will get on the mic come Friday use big language and equivocate in his usual manner of ""let's wait and see"" rather than have a confirmed plan of intent and keep the markets guessing for another six weeks. Microsoft probably won't care too much and will continue to hover between $100-$110 for eternity. -A novella from a #$%$ off shareholder"
"If you're not loading Undervalued MSFT, undervalued AMD...……… This business is not for you, you need to fond another trade."
"Maybe it's just me...But MSFT chart looks like stock is still in a MAJOR uptrend. So one bad day not too worrisome. Remember stock has had a tremendous run in the past month, so a pullback is to be expected!"
$MSFT > $AMZN
$260 tomorrow...
"Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) gets a target boost from $158 to $190 at Piper Sandler, citing the company's ""unique opportunity to further elevate its cloud leadership position through share gains and needle-moving M&A."
"People trade on emotions, I trade on facts. Microsoft will be at $200 before we know it "
A great day to buy on the dip -- just like a pro.
"love the slow and steady growth of this stock. in at 183 and will stay forever. billions of loyal customers, diversified services, good management, growing dividends, low debts.I think stock splitting will happen when we hit 300 in 1-2 years"
Interest rates affect Microsoft?? Haha please 
MSFT is stuck in neutral folks. Two steps forward. Three steps back. Selling 100 shares of MSFT and putting it all into NIO. After I make a killing in that stock I'll probably be able to buy back those 100 shares of MSFT and have plenty left over for other acquisitions.
"All indications say this should go up after today. They love the CEO, the direction the company is going, and the partners they made over the last 4 months. https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=MSFT"

Microsoft or Apple ?
The real next bit of movement for MSFT price movement is the settlement of JEDI in Microsoft's favor.
where's robinhood Here
How is it unrealistic?
Oh lookie its up 39 cents AMC
Wow tons of options trading going on in Microsoft stock both ways or maybe a straddle strategy either way I wouldn’t give my Microsoft shares up for nothing just wait until you see what’s in the pipeline most products our sold out before you can purchase I still have a bullish performance on this I don’t think it’s anywhere near the peak but if it does pull back for reasons not know to me other then profit taking I will increase my shares the stuff their doing will make the future a better place I truly whole heartily believe that.
Heading to 190 next week!
How are all the impatient people from last week feeling now?
Only a socialist government would give an audience to a socialist like Gates.
Volume was insane today especially in tech. Maybe the reshuffle that's coming next week moving communication stocks out of the tech sector causing it??
115 after ER??
200 today??
Setting up for major pull back
Be strong MSFT longs . A big sell off is unnecessary. Ignore any FUD as it comes your way. Prices will be back up 3-4% again in a hot minute if people don’t panic sell today. Hold and even buy more if any good opportunities. That’s how we win on this one! 
Do nothing Dems destroying small retail investors?

Is it now time to sell MSFT or hold through earnings?
"$MSFT $WIMI $FB When an opportunity arises, act on it."

I love how the Amazon appeal doesnt distract Microsoft... They just keep focusing on & improving Azure. Microsoft will be the stock to own in 2020! 160-165 EOY200-220 in 2020!!!
Love the overreactions on here lol I know half of you are adults but seriously? Give it a bit-- regardless it wont drift downward if anything back up and worst case if you're long xbox is coming out later this year which will make the stock soar up towards $300. This is a small blip and if microsoft wasnt even mentioned with tik tok itd still be at 216$ .. relax everyone lol its funny but hey sell it go ahead you're loss honestly.
Like I said on our way for a 80%+ gain in 2020. We are so well positioned it’s time to reap the rewards. :))
D
A healthy pullback! Only 2.54% pullback for the day.

"Constant innovation by MSFT. Now Blu-ray drive is gone from Xbox:Microsoft is reportedly launching a new Xbox One S without a disc drive next month. Windows Central reports that Microsoft will unveil a disc-less “Xbox One S All-Digital Edition,” with preorders expected to be available in mid-April. This new console is said to be available in stores in May, ahead of Microsoft’s typical E3 show in June.Codenamed “Xbox Maverick,” details on the disc-less console appeared in November. Microsoft is also rumored to be creating an option to ship this disc-less console with games pre-installed, so new Xbox owners can choose the games they want installed before the console ships.No more Blu-ray driveIf the report is accurate, Microsoft’s disc-less Xbox One S will be designed for digital copies of games. It will likely mean this new console is cheaper than the existing Xbox One S, as the costly Blu-ray drive is being removed. It will also be designed for services like the Xbox Game Pass, that deliver games digitally."
Does anyone have a guess as to why MSFT is minus in the premarket this morning?

"Lots of positive articles out on Bloomberg, CNBC , Forbes and a couple others tonight. Upgrades coming. $145 coming fast. If short, I'd cover."
"Last few sessions downtrend is a classic MM maneuver to take out stops to get the shares they will need after the earnings beat. Will touch $140+ next week imo. Don't trade on my opinion or anyone else's here, do your DD."
Msft will not hit $300 this year. You’ll be lucky to see $250.
"MSFT soon breaking new highs, people will bet bug time on msft"
it seems $108 levels is a solid line of support. wouldn't miss any buying opportunity for anything below.
"Yahoo! When I look up information about $MSFT, why are you showing me a “related” video of Bill Gates talking about vaccines? How in the world are the two things “related”? Very unprofessional. Please review and take corrective action."
Sir Gates blessed the TikTok deal yesterday on Bloomberg TV. And stated at some point will be brought into discussion with Nadella......... as someone here predicted (cough). 
Upgrade tomorrow is coming with higher price target...closes positive
Something's definitely afoot.
"really hope this bad boy comes out to surprise investors tomorrow AH, holding 310 shares currently and loading up if it reports strong"
This news was obviously leaked out a couple days ago to the insiders and big time option traders.
Price action and relative strength in Microsoft shares very positive showing that it’s under accumulation.
this year Microsoft is the ultimate buy & fold equity .. watching grass grow is more exciting
"Adoption rate is picking up pace. The coming narrative: Bitcoin = relevance. How high will the price be when $AMZN $AAPL $MSFT $GOOGL announce their investments. This snowball continues to roll. It's not just an advantaged store of value, it's a network. Corporations will either be in the network or out of it. Which do you think CFOs will choose? Finite supply will power it much higher imho. I'm invested via $GBTC Low cost. Liquid. Easy."
The next 1 trillion is coming for msft. So i guess 115$ by two Weeks is not out of the question
Why would they upgrade for what reason

"Amazing, bought my first shares in Mar2012, 70@$31. Lowest price ever bought was $26.08, through DRP. Now I am up >350%, MSFT has gone to #1 position in my IRA ports. Hard to imagine this was once a dead stock stuck in the $20's for years. Techies hated it, but I never saw an office anywhere that could operate a day without it. It started paying a div and jacking it up every year- that's when I knew I was a LTI. I've never sold a single share."
"Maybe two down days in a row on heavy volume when all the news is perfect. The fed will keep on printing forever, China has beat the virus, Aapl soaring, Msft dominating the cloud. Weird huh"
Gee thanks $MSFT 
Have y'all seen price target raised to $142? That may be pushing price up this morning.
Overall today has been a little disappointing.Was hoping MSFT could hit the $110 mark.Guess I'll just have to wait another week of two.
is it a good time to buy?

I love this stock moving to 160
Nothing’s been priced into the stock. There had been no run up pre ER. That’s the beauty of it all. We get good numbers and this stock can fly. If your Short here you may end up being “short” of cash. Hehe
I have owned MSFT for several years now. Great increase in value but how about giving shareholders some cash payback from the mult-ibillions in cash the company has. I would like to see a special dividend declared or at least a substantial dividend increase. Any other shareholders with me?
MSFT is going to crush earnings. Back to $115 soon.
This should be in everyone's retirement portfolio. I love technology & science & MSFT!
I'm in at about 31.00 since 1990
So buyers during q2 / q3 are selling now and the ones entering are happy because MSFT at 210 makes more sense than Tesla at 600.It is all preparing for the big crash. On the big crash you rather have stocks that have strong balance sheet and steady growth than speculative stocks
"I’m a little annoyed I bought 10 shares at 213 and now it’s 203, but I have faith in Microsoft. Definitely gonna hold onto it"

"People need to relax. If you are day trading or renting these mega tech companies you are going to be disappointed. MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, and AMZN should only be for long term investors. These companies are not going to be pumped or subject to short squeezes. They are saturated amongst most mutual and index funds and are not going to carry much volatility, which in turn means don't expect them to jump the gun with a 10% jump unless earnings blows it out of the water. Stay Long and be patient, and take the dips as a gift."
Major trouble for micro should settle at 212 -215
This is a solid report. Green shortly and rising.
"I usually dont look for advice on here but I have a question. I am sitting on 100 April 17 185 calls. I have rode it down from a buy in price of 6.63 per contract. I kept thinking it would recover after each enormous drop, but has not. The loss right now is substanial at over 54k. Now there is plenty of time left to try and recoup some of those losses back with some nice up days. Getting back to the 190 range does not seem possible but trimming those losses over the next month does. What do you think?"
Short trolls posting more than normal. MSFT should reach $150 easily in a good market. SPX should shortly trade near 3100 and 3200 by early next year.

Let’s all hope that Microsoft lands TikTok because if they do it will be HUGE. I’m already hearing that FB and Google won’t be able to acquire TikTok due to existing anti-trust scrutiny. What a ride 
"MSFT doesn't participate in bubble pricing and that's a good thing. Other pps can crash down but with MSFT fair and strict valuation you know you're defensive. In any case this was a spectacular quarter, and MSFT has gained even more attention as it has proved that the giant moves strong."

I am so glad to be a Microsoft shareholder this stock only goes up and the brand has been bread and butter to not only out lives but to the stock market as well. These are discount prices.
Why is it down guys ????
Stay long. Was just on a MSFT Teams User Group meeting today. They are selling everything including Azure at a record pace. Teams is a big plus for any business. Not just WFH.
I'm in. Hoping this shoots up to 115 after earnings. This should easily be a $200 stock
We will be opening to a new All Time High! On a day that Nasdaq is getting hammered no less. Hehe. It just keeps getting better for Softie. Arriba! 
BOOM!
this is a great bargain at this price this unfortunate event is unfair but we have to make the best of it
200-210 analysts projections
Going too fast...
"At some point, it will test $230"
This is one stock I wish I had more..not sure if I should buy more to add. Should I or not
At $212 I was waiting for 202.. guess I will be waiting some more.
This is why the majority of people don’t make money in the stock market strange as that may seem. (Full disclosure I have made a tremendous amount of money with MSFT). Anyone selling this gem of a company has no business in the stock market. No joke. Find another pastime. :))
MSFT = buy it and forget it come and look at it in 5 years or so. Computer Dependency guarantees MSFT for the next 50 years.
I'm hoping for mid $150's by the end of the month. Anyone else?
Here comes the final 15 minutes free fall.....or will it be different today?
"is it just me? but I've noticed lately during the 1st half of the day about 10 mil volume been selling, and 2nd half the other 10 mil volume comes in and gobbles everything up at discount."
"For goodness sakes don't sell if it slows down, which it will, hold tight things will be beautiful very soon!"
Now is the time to buy MSFT.. Don't miss out... It's going UP UP UP 
New contract with KPMG looks pretty good
"Microsoft upgraded to Buy from Neutral with a $272 targt from $229, at CitiCiti analyst Walter Pritchard upgraded Microsoft to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $272, up from $229. The ""relatively slow-moving enterprise IT"" is likely to accelerate cloud adoption, which favors Microsoft's Azure over its peers, Pritchard tells investors in a research note. Further, an increased reliance on digital is likely to boost Office 365 premium adoption, adds the analyst. He expects this strength to drive share outperformance in 2021."
Congratulations!!
"Don’t worry, be happy. Sleep for a year and check the price. You’ll be a happy camper"
all my stocks are down today.
Amazon just showed a brazen willingness to destroy your business if you parter with their cloud services.Businesses will be taking another strong look at MSFT Azure after the latest Amazon debacle.
"I am a conservative. However I love Biden's policies on taxation. The world's richest companies, such as Nike, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, the big banks, Facebook, have escaped the taxman. It is time for them to step up to the plate, to dig deep into their pockets and start paying taxes FINALLY. Similarly Taxing the ultra rich like Gates, Soros, Pelosi, Hannity, Romney, Zuckerberg is a great idea from Biden. A person like Gates or his BF Buffett, will suffer a lot less by paying a billion in more taxes each year than would a middle class person paying $1000 more in taxes."
Never seen this hold a 36 P/E. Overbought by 5%
Absolutely no reasons for this takedown. The sector’s dragging it down now. This is still a screaming buy based on growth AND value. Apple will give the sector life tomorrow.

Bezo knows this game is a risk. that's why he been sold over $4 billion of his AMZN shares this past week.

"Reminder again, MSFT a great buy under $120.00, Undervalued AMD still a great under $35.00 . April is upon us, the DoD JEDI project will go to one of these companies; MSFT, AMZN, ORCL, IBM...….. GOOG is out of the game. My money is on MSFT to win DoD project.One matter of concern is certain the DoD won't accept Intels 14nm old antique technology with spoiler, meltdown, foreshadow, spectre with ugly patches. The DoD will only accept secure, new superior technology at 7nm, that's why a pick undervalued AMD as the beneficial of the JEDI project regardless who win the project...………........."
"Reminder, MSFT under $115.00 is a great buy, undervalued AMD under $35.00 is a great buy. Take advantage of the manipulation for your low entry point and win big in 2019. Do the proper home work DD and enjoy the ride."

Green lit for another 15 bucks upside short term.
Heavyweight battle between MSFT and AMZN over the JEDI project and MSFT is the winner. Congratulations are in order and looks like a little bit of an upset. I own both and the underdog has won this round. Cloud is continuing to grow and there's room for these two and a host of smaller players. An industry that will continue to grow for the next decade and will reward investors greatly.
MSFT is up 4.91% to 91.46

"This week, the US Department of Education accidentally showed just how badly the problem of for-profit college debt is intertwined with predatory loan collection: in a court filing, the Department of Education jacked up its estimate of its own illegal debt collection from 16,000 former students at bankrupt Corinthian College to nearly three times that amount. All while the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, the daughter-in-law of Amway's billionaire co-founder and owner (at last count) of at least 10 yachts, who was held in contempt of court for the department’s actions, continued to refuse debt forgiveness for thousands of students ripped off by for-profit colleges."
all last week sellers are returning to MSFT.
"When the market sells off, even the great stocks like MSFT will get a haircut. This could tank down to 115. This had a multiple buy ratings back in February of 1999. Its time to take profits and wait."

"Msft will be fine w or w/o TikTok. Would buying TikTok be good? Yes, I think so. Gets them in social media quickly and w.a nice subscriber base included. But either way MSFT is a buy and not just hold but buy and add on dips . GL all. IMO we get to $225-230 by end of week. But I def wouldn't ever sell just because TikTok goes or doesn't go thru. And it will go thru, without paying Trump, I mean the US, any money. This is a democracy, free markets included. He is trying to make it an oligarchy. Thank God  he will be out of office soon. I'm not trying to politicize this but it's the truth and hard to not mention."
Thoughts on reach $100 this week?
MSFT will surpass Apple.. Write it down!
"In an Aug. 30 FedBizOpps posting, the Pentagon extended the deadline for proposals for the $10 billion single-award contract to Oct. 9 from the prior due date of Sept. 17."
towards the last half of the 1st quarter I expect these stocks to go down
"This going to blow past 200 soon because no one will want to sell. With all the news and year outlook, you'd only sell if you wanted to leave guaranteed money on the table."
Microsoft Chart looks like it has AFIB..
Even a rock solid investment like MSFT is subject to corrections from time to time. Ask yourself: isn't Azure cloud growing dynamically? Didn't MSFT just land a multi-million dollar deal with JEDI? Didn't MSFT just build the first underwater data center? And on and on.
Wouldn’t it be awesome if $MSFT has a short squeeze just like GameStop? Would love to see the stock zoom up.

"Cowen analyst Nick Yako raised his price target for Microsoft to $165 from $155 after his firm's IT spending survey suggested a ""healthy"" 2020 outlook. This bodes well for Microsoft given its leadership position in ""key secular growth markets,"" Yako tells investors in a research note. The software giant also showed up well across the survey and was identified by 62% of respondents as the most strategic vendor for digital transformation projects, adds the analyst. Yako increased his estimates for Microsoft through fiscal 2025 and reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares."

What is happening with MSFT? Been a laggard for almost 5 months now.
... Still undervalued and still the best overall stock in the market - more upgrades soon!
This is soooooooo fixed it’s almost funny
For those not sure what’s happening let me explain in order of importance...1) Fed easy money policy. Don’t fight the Fed.2) Buy the stocks with GROWTH. Microsoft is one of those companies with growth3) Last week was just a mild rotation out of big tech and other stocks that have had a big run since the March lows. Some of that money went into cyclicals.4) The tech rally and other Covid plays rally resume because they are still the only companies with GROWTH and we are still in the middle of the pandemic.Hope that helps anyone confused. Enjoy the next leg up to the 220s
Fair value currently at $241.99. Patience is a virtue here.

Apple will push tech sector hard tomorrow. Msft will benefit better than most. They’ve already shown great quarter and guidance for next quarter. They were dragged down wrongly with the tech correction due to FB’s big takedown. If not for that it’d be well over $110 by now. It’s about to get another push starting tomorrow.

"I can’t believe some of these people on this board you just enjoyed a tremendous run up and if it goes down 2-3 days certain people panic,leads me to believe that there is a lot of new people on this board new to the market,my advice is go on vacation or quit looking at the price every 2 minutes and just let the market be the market and most of all QUIT COMPLAINING"
Also Bear in mind that besides that Stellar ER......MSFT also gave great guidance. One of a very few companies that did so. Hence we already know next quarter will be Strong. You don’t give guidance in this volatile market we’re in unless you have a pretty good amount of certainty. 
The deadline for Congress stimulus is Monday. Some investors did not want to hold just in case a deal is not made. I think all sides agree further paychecks for ordinary ppl are needed so this should be done monday with a nice bounce across the market.

Another all time high. :))
Breakout imminent
Will it go up today ?
"I hope that in the next version of the internet, we are allowed to block articles and comments that feature certain former Presidents, CEOs, Health Officials, certain right wing or left wing politicians or really anyone who is desperately seeking publicity and attention. It would be so much better to not get distracted by the unnecessary / unproductive drama."
Strong finish!
I think it’s a wrap. The fact that Wal-Mart acknowledged their partnership today with Microsoft says that it’s a done deal. I think it’s very likely that an announcement is made in the morning.
Like I stated last week. 80% gain for Softie in 2020. You can book it Danno! :))

"Coronavirus makes Microsoft stock an amazing money-making opportunity: top analystBrian SozziYahoo FinanceMarch 10, 2020, 1:38 PM GMT-5In the eyes of long-time tech analyst Dan Ives, the coronavirus represents more of a speed-bump for tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) rather than a mountain that cannot be navigated.Hence, Ives thinks it’s time to back up the truck on the King of Redmond now that the stock could be had at a much cheaper valuation amid the broader market rout.Ives said on Yahoo Finance’s The First TradeMicrosoft is well positioned to continue to benefit from the shift to cloud services and ongoing momentum in hardware such as the Surface.

"Lordy, MSFT is steamrolling again.. I'm well past 300% TR, working on a 4 banger. With double digit div% increases yearly. Hard to imagine this was a techie loathed company stuck in the mid $20's for years. I'm not a techie, but during all the hate years I never saw an office that could function even a day without it. That's why I started buying in the $20's and held on. Now it's the top $ stock in my IRA ports."

"Why is $MSFT is down while they beat earnings estimate? Is there a sell-off in tech?I expect a much bigger sell-off of SNAP stock, it went from $8 to $26 on the news that TikTok would be banned.

Comparison of last year same Q:2019 net loss $227M SNAP = $7.502020 net loss $200M SNAP = $40$SNAP $8B accumulated losses increase."
"A hundred money managers all push the sell button at once and dump a trillion in stock for no reason, but you should be worried about a couple thousand Reddit investors moving a billion in a day and hounding a bunch of collusive over leveraged short hedge fund managers.

For years people have been saying MSFT has been overpriced. Guess what people if anything it has been undervalued for years

Ive heard many things about SRMX company that I think will soon come to light publicly. The Tmobile and Microsoft Azure partnerships place this stock in a good position to grow. This partner is also working with Elon Musk’s starlink program to provide 5g internet… I think its very early for this but better to know now.
"Can someone please explain this to me. Most of the big tech stocks has been doing fine in the last 3-2 months except $MSFT. Many of these stocks if not all, have been moving higher on NO new news, just following the market etc. So why not MSFT? So what makes other high tech stocks move higher without new news and what makes MSFT move lower without new news? Is there anything hidden or some people know something but the average people do not? I really want to know. Thank you so much."

New to board. It went up on Tik Tok news and down on other biders. Historically when tech was down Msft was down less. Today and last few months when Tech was down we are down more than rest of big tech. Thoughts ?
After earning could be close to 100
Over 7 million shares above avg volume today.
MSFT isn’t going anywhere. Buy the dips and hold long term . Nowadays employees can work from home if needed; didn’t always used to be that way.
If this break $216.40 or whatever the all-time high is then we rip past 220$

first time MSFT investor. In for the long haul!
"Why is MSFT not over $250 yet ? Not sure why this isn't performing better. Plus, we'll have the dividend dip coming soon. I hope we can hit $250 before that occurs to offset the dividend."
Thank goodness! Now if I only I had bought at $100 instead of $105. But who can predict panic selling?

Take a survey here....MSFT @$200 by end of February?  for Yes and for No. Just trying to gauge bullish sentiment for MSFT"
Two stocks that will never disappoint in 2021; undervalued MSFT & Undervalued AMD.
I love these little dips in the market when I could jump in and buy another 100 shares.

MSFT’ will continue to fly on Morgan Stanley’s price guidance raise and report of a projected 10% dividend Increase. A lot sideline money in search of dividends and MSFT raising when so many are cutting their dividends will attract a lot of money. IMHO 
"Just wanted to say congratulations to all MSFT longs! What an awesome quarter!Looks like a continued bright future for Microsoft! Very impressive on Azure growth, along with everything else."
"The best thing to do is to buy and Hold and peak at it once a year. Been with MSFT for decades and it has always done well... just like small caps tend to lag the large cap growth stock initially and then does even better later... msft is undervalued right now compared to other large tech, if u r in now, great you got it cheaper, cuz this has a lot more room to power upwards. S&P index is assessed to grow about 30% 2021. Msft will outperform 30%. Good luck"
CNBC just reported the Pentagon came out with statement reaffirming that MSFT had the best bid for the JEDI contract. Positive news.

Fantastic comeback. Outtasite! MSFT has Big “MO” on its side 
Glad we didn’t buy tik tok!
The money train is leaving the yard very soon for a new high - all aboard!
Great day! Set a new all time high to shoot for. Higher highs and higher lows. Una combinación fantástica. 
when do they distribute the wealth via dividend? at what price do you start sharing better than 1.62%?
Just need a couple more analysts to upgrade price targets
Revenue and earnings very likely will be great and this should make this stock  ... a company with such a yoy evolution should have a better stock price development as long as there aren’t any foreseable things that might intherphere with this
Surprised MSFT is not diving from the massive security breech still not resolved. Should be a 20% correction and they may not get Pentagon contract?

msft is oversold. it's going to overbought again pretty soon. Upside trend is in place
I guess expectations were for a beat on earnings and rev. Oh well... Rolled the dice here like a lot of us. Thought they would have had a better quarter...
I pretty much called it. Microsoft was waiting to get a few good ERs under its belt before breaking into new levels. Had been in a range since August. I think we see $300 by EOY but not much more than that. Slow and steady wins the race 
I just love MSFT for the long term. I see double vision within 5years.

Now If I am running small restaurant , I would ask to move all non-essential user to Open Office(Which perfectly enough to support simple edit) + Microsoft office free read only and only left key person. I would save $12/person and if I have 100 corporate staff that is $1200/month.I start using it personal computer even when I have home/student edition on my personal computer and find quite comparable (Reason I use it because if this economy go worst, Worst case I can help small businesses to save 1000's while make some money myself very easily with free tools like that) Unexpected advantage for me is now I have available on all computer without need to spend lot more money on Office 365."

"MSFT will be hired by the US government:Microsoft Describes How Government Hackers Stole ‘Large Sums’ From Financial FirmsBy David Scheer and Dina Bass February 28, 2019 It’s a short -- but startling -- passage tucked inside Microsoft Corp.’s periodic cybersecurity report: State-sponsored hackers attacked several financial services firms and stole “large sums of cash.”The account provides another reminder that hackers are successfully preying on parts of an industry where customer confidence is paramount, and that’s sometimes reluctant to disclose serious attacks. Yet even as the report lays out what happened, it omits sensitive details, such as which government backed the assault or which firms were targeted.Microsoft said it knows about the case because its experts helped victims in the aftermath. In a series of similar incidents, hackers gained administrative access to computer systems by infecting a machine with a “highly targeted, obfuscated backdoor implant,” possibly with a spear-phishing email. Then they sent cash to foreign accounts. In some instances, the hackers went undetected for more than 100 days, and once found, unleashed malware on the victims’ systems, halting operations.FireEye Inc., another cybersecurity firm, described a similar series of attacks in a report published about five months ago. A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on whether the incidents are related.In that report, FireEye said a North Korean hacking group had infiltrated more than 16 firms in 11 countries including the U.S., stealing more than $100 million. The group’s victims included a Chilean bank that lost $10 million last May. North Korean diplomats and official media have denied that the country plays any role in cyber attacks.

"What Microsoft really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit fo Microsoft (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Microsoft just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem. This small super tech may double in price in a swift (it already has since we started covering it one year ago), closing the opportunity of cheap buyout soon.

Does anyone know about the dividend policy of Microsoft? It’s said that the most recent dividend date is Feb 15. When should I buy and how long at least do I need to hold in order to get the dividends in Feb? Thanks!
Why is MSFT always going down?
Never sell.
We can still run to 150 easy.

Solid management, wonderful growth story, visionary, cash generator and so much more.However, the $MSFT stock performance is disappointing to say the least. I don’t understand the price movement.I find it worrisome when some people on this board keep talking up the stock baselessly and when asked genuine questions, not only they give no response but start attacking the people who ask questions. Using words like ‘stupid’ and ‘fool’ makes you look unprofessional.I welcome you to debate ideas instead of telling me to invest elsewhere."
"AWS? way behind the wits and whistles with too many risks I think.

Recalling Ballmer who was operating in the comfort zone, afraid maybe to give up & might lose control of windows. But Satya N's dream was intriguing, controversial, & risky entering into the cloud of software subscription base unconventional of Microsoft. But Gates & others trusted him. Gates did it again, a visionary of trust & complicity brought his company wider that where he founded MSFT."
let's go Microsoft

After watching Netflixs' earnings I am getting concerned that a lot of the earnings price movement is already baked into the share price and there is a lot to live up to for this earnings report. We have had a great run up the last month or so but should we be expecting a pull back when earnings are reported?"

"This is the little correction I mentioned last week. I think over the next day or two MSFT will go to 182.90, and if they don’t hold that down to 178.80, which I think is what will happen. Then off of 178.80 back to new highs next week. Will be buying calls around that point."

It's a YES from me.. Fantastico! Microsoft is turing into a Micromonster of a stock. Loving it.
Another Fantastic Day from Softie! Just when you think it can’t get any better ....... It does! Arriba! 
I'm so glad MSFT has ventured into EV. A small investment for Microsoft that can go a long way...
I'm impressed.
MSFT healthcare partner ADPT could triple this year as revenues explode $AMZN and $GOOG are using technology to change healthcare future
msft will surge and hit $300 before summer
Microsoft is not standing still with its tech platform as it continues to be innovative. Today’s stock valuation is perhaps accurate but I believe doesn’t figure in what’s about to happen as technology evolves at a crazy pace through 2030 and beyond.This stock will easily reach $200 by year’s end. IMHO
"Added more $MSFT to my already big position. Kinda feel dirty getting it this cheap. At Min. This ends the year at $235, at best you are prob looking around $270. Buying at $213 with a long hold mindset is practically stealing."

Msft will be the new leader !
"Reports of a defective Windows 10 update causing blue screens? Very under reported but just a heads up.

"What a move MSFT has made for shareholders the last couple of years. It is interesting to note that MSFT is off the government focus compared to the likes of FB, QCOM. GOOG etc. We have laws that companies need to abide by but over legislation and scrutiny is a killer. As we debate 5G and who should lead it, why is there no American leadership? The administration is concerned about Huawei on 5G security but there is no national alternative but European firms such as NOK and ERIC. We need to encourage our tech titans to invest, not distract them with lawsuits that stifle them. Our tech titans could easily invest in 5G technology or into NOK and ERIC to bring them up to par and surpass Huawei. It seems so petty, even to our allies who refused to bar Huawei from their 5G deployment."
Low volume for a down day. Not exactly a race for the exits.
"Umm, as of yesterday, Apple is most shorted stock. Maybe you are correct about MSFT attracting the attention of short sellers. But, unlike Apple, MSFT is a company of substance and efficient run."

Inverted head and shoulders currently forming will result in a break out and new all time high for MSFT.

see you at $100
STOP being shy MSFT and go to 160. We all need a Christmas gift and you can deliver ;)
A week ago I said it was going to go down to 220 and boy did I get attacked. Guess I was right. It was overvalued plus everything that’s going on with the government it may even go lower than that. This is not an administration that encourages any kind of growth in business
justice for msft!
Read the articles about the short squeeze  gme LET US SQUEEZE ALL SHORTS!!!#NIO #TSLA #CCIV #AMC #BUS.V #LYSDY #ITM #NNDM #MSFT #BBBY #SPCE
The Grand Conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn is a once every 800 year event. It augers well for you and MSFT going forward.
Agree with Cramer’s rant on CNBC. MSFT if the deal goes through is stealing TT and will make a fortune. Let’s make it happen Nadella! 
don't forget to buy your Nasdaq 10k party hats!
Boom !! Making me money 
way better co. than Apple. It will catch it's stock price within 3 years.
Markets abit shaky today... wouldn’t pin anything on MSFT though. Be patient and go long
Don't get left behind!
s112 tomorrow
rise up
They beat the earnings estimates by 20% and it’s down after hours. Imagine just a meet or miss? This is why holding tech thru earnings has no reward. Great risk. No reward.
And I still own it at 29.50. LOL all the way to the bank!
"The CEO of MSFT said that they sold their shares because they wanted to make a profit for their own personal use. Nothing wrong with that, many CEO’s do this and the stock eventually goes back up. Nothing wrong going on with the company, so CEO selling some of their shares does not indicate anything bad. CEO even said that they sold some for personal use. Hold your shares and you’ll see this bad boy up!"
MSFT should win the Jedi Throne!https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum
msft did not do anything to make the price back up? this company used to green while all the market red. now seems not any more
Breakout !
But now cloud for almost any business in the free world to succeed you MUST do cloud or perish.This is the game changer that will have msft beat upcoming earnings and i boldly say best quarter of the year.
Satya Nadella sold about 14 million MSFT stock. Tim Cook sold about 55 million AAPL stock 2 weeks ago. Why this fuzz about MSFT? It’s just portfolio management.
88 tomorrow!
"Finished reading full earnings call transcript Q&A. Forget the market silliness, this was another well executed quarter with multiple business segments performing very well. A little softness in OEM PC segment due to back log in chip availability, but still a healthy quarter. Noticed no change to CAPEX expenditures which signals company is confident in current growth cycle. Commercial cloud and gaming going strong and lots of new parternships with big Fortune 500 companies and integration of Github and some smaller planned acquisitions to build on cloud cababilities.Looks like a well managed company looking to post increases earnings over the next year."
will catch Apple in stock price within a year..just watch.
They are. Manipulating the stock. When it opens it up then within a half hour it’s down and then it stays down for the rest of the day may go up a little bit but the end of the day closes down so they take an hour to get some profit. This is the ceiling the stock will not go to Higher it’s overvalued as it is
Why is this down?
Go msft
this market = stress
Buying on the dip today. MSFT is one of the tech companies that I believe in and can compete against Amazon's web services. Plus it gives a dividend.
"The Cloud is the Datacenter of the '70's. IBM owned the datacenters of old, but MSFT has the brilliance and technology to build the datacenter of today. You see that with Azure. I am old enough to know what IT was like in the '70's and '80's. I see the transition to Azure happening on every computing front. Long on MSFT."
KABOOM!
Think this will drop again tomorrow not this much like today but it will drop?
Ready for war against the bears
Crash tomorrow
Has MSFT ever crashed? Or better question is ... has any of MSFT falls became permanent ?
"Anyone on here think MSFT should buy Square to enter the payment processor industry to compete with PayPal, Fiserv and now Facebook?"
"Outlook has been hacked by the chinese group ""Hafnium"" - It may affect the stock short-term but I don't think it will have an effect long-term"
Skimpy yield...MSFT should issue a special div or simply increase regular one substantially. They can EASILY double it! Huge cash position!!
"This is no where near as over valued as Apple, Amazon, and Tsla. Should not be falling so much especially right after divident increase."
tax loss is good and repatriate the cash buy back stock!
Feel like this can run a bit. Don’t rule out a split. AAPL and TSLA both jumped quite a bit after their announcements.
Can we crack $230 and stay there plz
Cloud up massively. Every other category beat and for a company that has beat for 9 quarters this is impressive.
When going is good everyone becomes a forecast expert !!!!
87% growth in the cloud. This is a huge number considering the MS Cloud is a several years rolling now. Looking at over 120 Billion in revenue next year. This company has definitely reinvented itself.
Price target for this should be $245- In one year.
"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."
"True story. I diversified from $MSFT into other cyclicals, consumers and retail after listening to the “experts” on cable. Today, my investments in those other stocks, including $WMT are suffering heavy losses. Lesson learned: I will stick with companies that I’m comfortable with. Microsoft all the way."
"Just a reminder, a Covid vaccine doesn’t change the growth in Big Tech names with the exception of possibly Amazon. Microsoft and Apple were never Covid pure plays. They just proved that they could continue growth even during a pandemic but that growth wasn’t dependent on the pandemic. For that reason, a sell off of Microsoft and Apple won’t be that bad. Names like Teladoc, Zoom, certain biotechs, and others will probably see major sell offs as their fortunes directly depended on the pandemic..."
Microsoft for life!
There will be a lot of happy MSFT call option holders tomorrow!
Tech rotation to smaller cap stocks.
After hours just some noise... $140.00 print tomorrow...
"I do believe that this company has reached its peak somewhere between 180-188 and wont grow further than that. Too big to keep growing at a decent rate. The last week chart is showing us that this company will grow at a much lower rate than the last year, and there are plenty of better option out there where companies are way more profitable and growing at a very decent rate"
"We are at the 200 day. If we break this, I'm selling."
How isn’t Microsoft worth $2 trillion yet?!?
"The US Market is in the TULIP MANIA BUBBLE!No matter what happens, even if all Companies go Bankrupt, NASDAQ Composite is NOT allowed to close red.ENJOY THE MASSIVE STOCK BUBBLE! ENJOY ABSURD VALUATIONS and FREE CAPITAL GAINS WITHOUT WORKING!$MSFT $GOOG"
Now hopefully this corrects... Tik tok news brought it down for no reason hope people realize this was for the best
"Never good to buy at peak prices, I see red today"
"If the ruling come out tomorrow to confirm MSFT JEDI, then we will see 192 Wednesday"
I bought a few shares yesterday to get an even number of shares. I always seem to end up with a weird number of shares that bug me due to DRIPs. I did the same with AAPL yesterday. I guess it's just my OCD...Punishing these highly profitable and cash rich companies due to bond yields doesn't make sense to me.
Can we turn green eod?
Looking for a up day
"this stock did very well in the recent downturn, very resilient stock, may test 100 again in which case I'll buy more otherwise this will rise, was 125 not long ago and tech is not going anywhere and neither is the wheel or sliced bread."
Hi rally how r u ?
Headed to new PT $125.
This is why folks you don’t you trade gems like MSFT Apple Amazon. You just own ‘em and add to ‘em. Sorted! 
Another 8 point plus drop today. That's Bidonomics at its best. The democrats are bankrupting the government and taking everyone and their retirement plans with them.
Why MSFT so quite?
thanks GOD for this price lol call all the way to the bank!
Best earning ever in history ... they want your cheap shares!!
"well I see how amazon is trying to destroy msft just by using dirty tactics, in the short term it is working but in a long and medium term it will affect amazon credibility because honestly there is no way msft a way more capable company to develop a high quality software can lose this war. Amazon will need more communist judge and it is a losing battle to be honest."
"As of today softy has gained $6 a share in the last 6 months. 6 months of treading water basically. Yet everyone on this board seems to think were off to the moon, with outrageous share guesstimates that will come true just around the corner. Way too many pumpers here."
go team! this stock rocks. entire management team should have received HUGE year end bonuses. so great to own stock on a company that is so well managed@
MSFT should boost the dividend. Broadcom dividend yield is 3.67% versus Microsoft dividend only yields 1.45%. Pales in comparison now to many other companies. I think they can do better.
Thinking of adding additional shares even at current price. Thoughts ???
Any thoughts on news that Russians got access to MSFT source code?
"Does anyone here sell COVERED CALLS? Thanks, in advance!"
"This exact same thing happened last quarter. The entire market is in the doldrums because of trade war fears, interest rate increases, and general fatigue of a market that has increased so much for such a long period of time, not to mention how worried investors seem to be over MSFT's valuations. Once some of these factors are out of the way, MSFT has a lot of momentum to carry it upward.Of course, I'm a long term investor and I see no reason, ,right now, to change that."
"To all of you on here who saying how wonderful Microsoft is and how it’s doing, have you looked lately how much the stock is down."
"My family bought Microsoft when Pong was the big video game. We bought $50,000 of Microsoft and $50,000 of Intel. We sat on both through 6 or 7 splits before rebalancing. These two stocks put 2 generations of my family through college and paid off lots of home mortgages. We still have many shares of both. It’s great to see both flying high again. :-)"
Nice rebound! This stock is a forever hold. No trading this one ever.
"Many years back, 2009, I had made a decision that I was going to invest in APPL (Apple). And stick with it. It was based on all the things I felt APPL could do. I didn't stick with it, else my investments would be over $2-3 million dollars. Now, I am having the same feeling about MSFT (Microsoft). And I hope I am going to stick with it and buy on dips. Why?1. From being a Windows and Office play, they are becoming a cloud and technology as an enabler play. 2. Almost everything is moving to tech. Even a restaurant booking and ordering systems will be online. Everything someone how flows something to MSFT revenue. 3. MSFT has been really bad with hardware, phone, laptops. Surface is okay, but not an iPad killer. I feel they will do something in this space. Either they will get into partnership with Mobile operators and get into the tech side, and if they do something interesting in hardware space, and do it right, it alone could be worth APPL - 10 years wish list. 4. Getting rid of all retail stores and moving online has huge savings on rental plus the physical inventory. This will have few bps positive impact to bottom line. 5. MSFT is going into various verticals - like healthcare. Kind of speaks to my point number 1, but this is more than that. If they start coming up with technologies that help you analyze virus, DNA, they become a healthcare company. They are also doing stuff in fintech space. Not many know, but they were looking at acquiring YES Bank in India (didn't go thru), but shows intent. These are just my thoughts. Maybe I am biased to my own thoughts. I would love to hear your constructive feedback."
"MSFT is cheap based on its growth over 100 percent in cloud business, Companies will likely ban the use of Amazon's cause it tries to get in vertical industry and conflict of competition. long microsoft"
"If Msft beat earnings handsomely, which is very likely, we're seeing it back to 190 plus."
Are going to close green today
"Following are the list of stocks worth buying =Apple, MSFT, CSCO, INTC, paypal, Mastercard, Visa, NVDIA, Google, Southwest Airline, GM, ORCLE, etc. But Apple and MSFT are the tops. Alternatively you may want to purchase some great mutual funds from Fidelity etc. And sleep without worrying. Invest on daily, weekly, monthly or yearly basis and look forward to a great retierment in the future."
300 in sight.
"MSFT has had an amazing run recently, just a little pullback, 250 soon come!"
"Also next week AMD, FB, Google. Long and strong MSFT!"
"I held this since June, finally coming into green"
$243 new all time closing high with the wind at our sails. Upwards and Onwards from here. 
Great stock and a lot of momentum. Look for this thing to run to $200+ per share in short fashion. Cheers!

"Initial reports of prospective antitrust activity appears to be focused on actors apart from MSFT. MSFT is trying to compete, in varying degrees, with some of these companies. Thus it might benefit to some degree from DOJ curtailment of FANG power. Any thoughts?"

"Msft is worth 220 dollars a share w or w/o Tik Tok. Absurd how positive news (potential aquisition) can now drive the pps lower, bc they may not actually complete an aquisition."
glad it passed that 200 psychological barrier - now it's more free to move north.
"I like Trump’s payroll tax holiday for those making less than $100K. Under the president's executive order, from 09/01/20 these payroll taxes won't be taken out of your paycheck if your bi-weekly salary is $4,000 or less. So, for example someone making $15 per hour and working 40 hours per week will get about $46 more per week or slightly over $180 per month. From September through December that will come out to about $830. Consumer spending accounts for 70% of U.S. economic growth. In a consumer based economy, more money is earned and less money is paid in taxes, people likely will spend more on goods and services as a result businesses generate more on revenue, they reinvest more and hire more employees, unemployment goes down, economy revitalize and grow again. The point is, it’s all connected."
"well, another ho hum up day for msft shareholders. very nice."
"$108 looks beautiful. Next step, close above $110"

This is a correction and there is no better time to buy than this

Love seeing a little pullback pre earnings instead of running all the way up into it.
GM files for bankruptcy.
"Generally government contract disputes take between 60 and 90 days to resolve! Odds are that the JEDI contract will remain with the defender, Microsoft, the end."
"By looking at the balance sheet, Microsoft's core revenue is NOT come from hardware but ongoing Cloud subscription services from enterprise and personal customer. Supply chain maybe a concern but market over reacted."
Any young investors like myself should feel very confident leaving money here to grow over the next 5-20 yrs. we will make plenty of money
forever holding this stock
Well position for next week spike!!! 50 contracts at 230$
Here we go
Me thinks that the MSFT buy-back machine is working overtime. : )
"Brought some shares last week when the stock was around 212 and it’s near enough at ATH pre market, I use Microsoft products on a daily basis as a student and that’s not going anywhere anytime soon, the growth potential with software like teams & the new partnership with GM will sure enough propel the stock into healthy growth long term"
"Len Berwick Jr., is increasing his positionin MSFT. Buying Opportunity up to $220per share as per Len."
"Im holding. But i understand fully that this is bigger than MSFT. I gotta see what the market does this week because bottoms are clearly not in. But if we see 135-145 again, i will be starting to position myself to add long. Thats where im at with it. Im sticking with the solid company, with a great ceo, great business model & a really good balance sheet. Not selling. Will add after i know more about the market as time passes & more fear/panic kicks in.Emotion for me is a non-factor..."
Too much Woke-ism and Tech Oligarchy are a danger to a free Society and to your portfolio.. Buy protection while cheap... $TWTR $FB $AAPL $AMZN $GOOGL $MSFT
"Revenue growth a bit weak at 17% , but operating income very strong with margin improvement. Cloud growth 50% very great."
"Yesterday I posted this and a couple of people did not like it: Tomorrow is the 3rd Friday when options expire - in the money 136/Calls and 137/Puts - would expect tomorrow would have some influence on the price movement. Me, I exited during AH at $140.05, tomorrow is another day.Who does not pay attention to options expiration?"
Msft is listed for one of the best stock to buy in August
"Overvalued stock NVDA $259.60 vs undervalued MSFT $108.88, AMD $19.52 ….. Do your home work and pick the undervalued stocks."
Take your Microsoft shares 1 year ago and sell them all. Then buy TSLA 1 year ago. See where you stand. Then cry.
Technology is dominating!
i am still thinking to get some next week between goog vs msft.
msft consolidation above $210 before next liftoff
i just keep buying the dips. thanks
If one compare the balance sheets of Microsoft and Amazon; then Microsoft should be worth 3xs as much as Amazon!
We will go green mid day
If you are scared that the tiktok deal doesn’t work just buy $NIO great news coming this week
"Earnings call after the bell today, should be good one"
finally a normal microsoft day. chugging along. a steady strong day. just what I needed for the weekend.
Looks like new high this week .
"I bought $MSFT the first time this past March, near the bottom! It was a stressful day and the stock went down further yet. I couldn’t even look at my portfolio - too painful. But now I’m up 40% and I am not likely selling any $MSFT."
Credit Suisse raises guidance to $180.
Thank you Satya; you’re a genius
"Buy Tomorrow. Don't buy after earnings, per Cramer. Lol"
Algos aggravating the market down side price action as usual. Stay long stay strong 
3 day sell off. back green tomorrow and on its steady climb.
Institutional funds will ROTATE into MSFT as Apple is finished. MSFT is the new leader.
WOW! Loving this!!
Good resistance @202 :) so consider this as a bottom and boom after investors meeting in October.
Came here to celebrate the big news
"My fault folks,,,,,,I bought shares today."
"When traders get impatient waiting for MSFT to make its move, investors be like"
@fhr.zoltan Anytime they announce earnings they announce dividend payout which should be today after market closes
This is just the beginning folks. MSFT is beating Amazon in the cloud. Great management. I think $150 will happen sooner than anyone expects.
"I think, market correction is over for undervalued AMD, MSFT, expect new highs in the near future. Do your home work and win big."
"""Microsoft reports earnings of $1.38 a share on sales of $33.1 billion, beating estimates""Dow Jones"
Moving ahead on all cylinder's now - more good news coming are way!
Look at big companies Amazon and apple they been tanking hard in the past but msft never ever tanked:) that's why msft is the safest company ever.
"Great quarter, it beats top and bottom lines with great guidance. You cannot ask for a better dividend paying stock than MSFT, dividend + growth. Good luck longs."
Keep thinking we are at least due for a nice bounce. However Nasdaq futures are getting Slaughter again. Talking about getting oversold. I am surprised futures are down Sunday after the beating form last 3 weeks. MSFT is not overpriced like AAPL or TSLA but it does not matter right now. If you wanted to dump MSFT I would people would have done it above $210.
Consolidation is always good.
"big boys trying to steal your shares, scared sheep with no knowledge will fall prey and watch it go up after they have been pillaged"
Lots of life left in old stalwart MSFT.
MSFT 100 easy
"So MSFT is the most valuable company on the market - at least by market cap. It's not participating in the sell-off nearly as much as the others in the pack and holding up incredibly well.Great defense stock but wouldn't touch it right now. AAPL and FB looks the cheapest on fwd p/e. Waiting closer to earnings to buyers to return - until then, the market is a falling knife with no support.Oh, and Trump is still alive, so it can't be good for the planet - I'm sure he'll rattle the market again between now and the new year."
"I got in today, I got 6 shares. Part of me wishes I would have bought this years ago. My 6 shares feels so low compared to the hundreds of shares other people have in this forum lol."
240 by April. Get ready.
Just finished expensive steak and lobster dinner. How are the cup noodles shortest and bashers?

The amount of speculation out there reminds me of jan 2000 $amzn $msft
Microsoft unveils AI based Azure Sentinal ahead of RSA.
200 around the corner
Goldman: BUY - 315. I’m buying with both hands!
Could the move to buy the Cloud File-Migration company be to help land the government JEDI contract?
"I'm always amazed at the comment ""slowing growth"" instead of ""slowing growth rate"" . If revenue is 10 Million and it grows at 80% there is an increase of 8 Million. Next period then starts at 18 Million and 70% growth means an increase of 12.6 Million. Slowing growth rate not slowing growth."
We should see this settle at 215 220 Friday to Monday’s
Still upside here
Maybe Microsoft being bought out ?hmmm
Need some advice if this is a good buy now. Been buying tech etf’s for years but considering most have majority in MSFT.
"Against the odds we'll see green today, mark this words, the call off of a Summit has nothing to do with WS, the market could be a bit tired today that's all¡¡¡¡¡¡¡"
rates are lower than 1998 and the Fed is doing stimulus. this is going to get really fun.
The $10 billion government JEDI contract offer ti MSFT is shaky now because of the recent data hackings involve with Msft. the company is at risks loosing this long term contract since the cyber system was breached.
This is one of the best stocks to own look at the 5 year trend continuous growth and stock goes up and up with very little dips I see 135-150 in 6-12 months
Makes absolutely no sense this is down AH after that earnings. It’s unreal how easily stocks get manipulated
"Was in @28.90 around 2013 when crazy Ballmer was still CEO. It was once a frustrating experience, but I guess my patience is my reward"
MSFT WILL gte JEDI CLOUD AWARD.... this will go upORACLE+MSFT Combination was done for a purpose...T doesnt like AMZN
Just look at MSFT chart. Nuff said!
"I just fail to see why MSFT price is under pressure, it had a great ER and has hardly any China exposure, it is a growth/value tech stock and should not be part of the so called tech correction. If anything , investors should be be buying into it then the high flying risky FANG stocks. Just IMHO"
aws is vulnerable to hacking End of story
there you go
"In the future, will Microsoft ever split their shares again, or are those days long gone?"
MSFT the juggernaut won't quit..can you imagine how high it will be by May? New highs almost daily.
"$92.45 is key level today. If we break that, I think we get to $95 rather quickly, possibly tomorrow. I’m long MSFT."
alot of people here not thinking long term. this is a stock that will keep going up with very little risk. dont worry about it.
"Green by morning, I ain’t worried"
going up 10/15b per day in value. I'll bet this beats apple and amazon to 1 trillion. Should be there in about 2 months.
"In 2-3 yrs is it really going to matter if you buy it at 194 , 200 or 205?Answer is no."
who is accumulating n why
this small headline that made people sell is laughable. you just gave a bargain to all the investors that bought the dip.
Microsoft should buy out CELO USD
MSFT hist a high after hours of $109.77
"A dip today, is a strong rise tomorrow...."
when someone tells you to use the woodchipper....question their agenda.
Anyone who watched the full mad money interview can summarise for us EU folks? Will tomorrow be a good day for us?
Trumpets please: we will exceed 190 tomorrow
When NVDA can be 250 stock Microsoft is the leader of technology this should be above 250
click on my profile and go back a few posts... I predicted 2.01. I’m never wrong
"Look to Apple and this , Apple come back and its go up $7 today , even they have deal with China ."
A moment of silence for poor Marc...thinking he can move markets on a message board. Sad. Go Microsoft!
"Nadella is a very underrated CEO. Not much is talked about him but over the years, he's brought great progress to the company. He's a man of professionalism and ethics."
"$MSFT Microsoft earnings today after hours. Looking for them to talk about Azure IoT Central. They wont mention specific customers (SWIR), but i expect them to discuss how Azure Central is gaining traction and those numbers, and possibly some more insight on the importance of the Edge data (Sierra Wireless Octave product).Good to be the preferred edge partner to one of if not the biggest company in this space... After all, Microsoft invested 5 BILLION dollars into IoT. Then they selected Sierra as a partner in the IoT space.. I'll let you do the math on that one."
Technology generally fares well in a weak dollar scenario! Taking advantage of the dips isn't a bad plan imo!
"MSFT is a $200 stock in less than 2 years.If the trade and tariff issues were not going on, it would have been 140+ today."
It seems that when the market is up we are down  patience is a virtue
"This will hit 250 by EOW, what do you think?"
Look at this..cloud is now everything https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-strength-keep-microsoft-stock-093135236.html
Getting spooked. Might divest and hold cash instead. Company is strong and I have full confidence in it. The stock? Not so much.
Will msft buy mvis??
Here comes $272-300. Lol
"I am a chartist - and I am making this call: MSFT is going down to 115. That's when I'll buy. The Big Techs have held well until now, but history tells us it cannot last. Why? Because for the market to find its bottom, they have to drop like the rest."
"I originally purchased 1/2 position 4 months ago, since that time I have re evaluated my long term goals with this stock and have added 3 more full positions and have been rewarded so far with a very nice gain. I have this stock targeted for a 15 year hold, time will tell."
Technical break over 200 day. Solud earnings and guidance and MSFT sees $112 + by friday
"On days like today, I think about the people who own millions of shares. Then I don't feel bad. Those people don't have money worries - a million here a million there"
"Forward PE is 24 and could be a lot less. That is why the stock is at 95. Plus, there will be a 100 billion buy back this year which will bring it down to 20 and if they beat in earnings it will be 15. At 4%+ GDP this stock will be 110 by year end."
"$MSFT Reports Q2 $2.03 v $1.64e, Rev $43.1B v $40.1"
patience wins again.
Great volume on way up. WTH was going on after hours last night? This should have happened then and then 2 more today. Hopefully AMZN will spur a tech rally tomorrow. Good AMZN earnings will say hopeful things about consumer sentiment. As long as the orange hair guy stays the Fxxx off Twitter.
Do it hold after market price till tomorrow morning ? Bullish or Bearish tomorrow morning?
"Down 8-10 tomorrow , then maybe a small come back. No cure for corona virus. It's spreading rapidly. This could wipe out the world. Don't laugh."
132 next week
come on ... lets break out of this 243/244 range already. today!
here we go again
"Already peaked, boycott is bad for business! Keep dividing us!"
"All signs point to MSFT cloud, Azure,doing tremendous. Funds looking for a reason to buy MSFT.....tomorrow they will get it. $150 in sight."
"Bought a little more today ,"
Somebody bought big this morning
Bought 1000 shares on margin at 202.40.. I hope for a point on the open for a quick grand. Please don’t disappoint me..futures up and I am very nervous now. What if something goes wrong
"Algorithmic trading pushes the market velocity, unfortunate"
YES! First time ever-close over 90
a couple of bad days does not equal a bad stock. I guess you will have this on occasion. Long term hold!
results online.revenue $29.1B (up 19%!)operating income: $10B (up 29%!)net income: $8.8B (up 34%!)diluted eps: $1.14 (up 36%!)
Microsoft is on the top 3 list for Repatriation beneficiaries. Should see big buy backs and dividend increases. And some nice growth....World economies are booming. Get some sun glasses. :-)
IBM earnings horrible especially where the compete vs Azure. Expect blowout Qtr . That’s why stock shooting up /
Suddenly the Cloud is not the future?
Short term I don’t see much movement but this is easily a $240 stock come Q4
This stock does not need to be pumped. It is a long term hold and I am bullish.
Never sell MSFT...Period
And so the road to $300 has begun 
What is logic
Big spike or drop? The charts are forming a big pennant and it is ending the forming. I say it would go up!
this is a great opportunity to buy some more 
Why window needs update so often?
"Unbelievable. Added to my position at 112.16 and it IMMEDIATELY dropped to 11.76. Oh well, a few cents wont matter in a month. Cheers!"
The irresistible force keeps moving up. The relentless march to $200. 
When does MSFT usually announce a dividend increase? Is it this earnings. Like to get back to 1.25%.
i bought a tiny bit more earlier
Wonderful buying opportunity for MSFT this morning. But fear will cause so many to miss it.
"The Jeffries analyst has had a $80 price target, so consider the source. He is behind the times and desperate."
180 by morning when all wake up to the reality.
"Undervalued stocks: MSFT $95.77, AMD $12.82........."
Compared to $AAPL Microsoft is undervalued. Wouldn’t be surprised to see Microsoft play a little “catch up” with Apple this 
110 for sure tomorrow.
Looks like big tech is bottoming
I said 160 by Xmas back in August..
"In a few weeks, MSFT is 150 plus.."
BACK UP THE TRUCK
I’m trying to locate the definition “Bagholder.” I’d figure I would come to this thread as I’m sure many of you have had real-world experience. Am I right? Lol
im gonna have so much microsoft by the time this is over
"I think below $165 is a good place to pick up some MSFT. Sold some put options last week and got filled at strike price $165. Sold this morning for the acquired shares for a quick profits. Hard to know where the bottom is, but until we have a clear picture of the coronavirus is contained and peaked out in China, will just hold them for short term trade. Once the picture is more clear, then will hold the acquired shares for long term. Good luck longs. I think MSFT has two distinct advantages, one there is no supply chain issue, two its revenue is mostly from enterprise which is more robust than consumer spending."
Government putting more money in the market.
