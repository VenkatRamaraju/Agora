Recent headlines and conversations for BABA
You wlill not make money from BABA.This company is a jock.
"BABA needs to figure out its payment system... that is what is holding it back, sellers asking for western union transfers. Centralize payment, create a paypal system of your own and this will be unstoppable.... FIGURE IT OUT!"
"HSI shedding off 450 points, Baba down 2 points, Earnings week will be spectacular for Baba, buy more now while you can at this price. :)"
Don't feel like working today as I see profits worth a year of salaries incoming
"Looked up Qualcomm stock price action from their fine close to 1 Billion on February 9, 2015. A month and a half before they’re fined The stock is trading around $74 a share {equivalent to 269 Alibaba} then when they got the fine on February 9￼￼ [Or just before that] the stock is trading at $62 {Or down 18% on the month and a half before_ 222 Alibaba’s price} immediately after the fine & following Within a week the stock jumped up 10% and then within a month and a half back up to $70 going along these scenarios will put us at 242 by next weeks end and 255 before earnings announcement ￼"
"BaBA, HUYA and Doyu are all down the same percentage. It’s not a coincidence, these stocks are manipulated. It’s why GME and AMC became meme stocks. It’s time to turn these around iOn the person’s doing it. Buy buy buy"
"shopping time, loading up !"
how low will it go today?? unbelievable....
I won’t sell any BABA share until it reach 1000$. Worst case scenario: I will keep it until 2030:)
Dead cat bounce or pre-earnings runup? Up 3.75% in HK.
"Who tf listens to CRFA. So after numerous 300+ strong buy price targets ,the one that says sell everyone listens to? People are sheep my gosh"
baba will only move significantly when the chinese government concludes the work on ant and its given approval
16 forward P. E. on a company growing fast! Long with Diamond hands:)
what happens to $baba share holders when this get delisted? do they just sell ur shares at market price at the time or go to 0?  hint:
"$270 next week? Possibly. I don't give much attention to the short-term price. However, BABA is trading at a large discount to its intrinsic value, and sooner or later, the share price will climb back where it should be. Stay calm and ignore all the Jimmy Zs who wish they were never introduced to the stock markets.Consider this as the last buying opportunity."
25% drop from it's high approx...Same as $BABA when the investigation was priced in to now after the fine...do you think this where it'll stay or more room to fall?
"The only way Baba shares will go up from here today , is if China Gov't gives it another 2.7 BILLION DOLLAR FINE !!!!!!!!!!! That seems to make BABA share holders happy !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
OK; let's see which way HK takes us in another hour.
Two main reasons for the bloodbath:1. BABA vows more spending going forward which will compress margins even further2. Cloud unit underperformed
"Although the article of Reuters is denied by ANT (on Twitter), even if it was true I think it won’t affect stock price of Alibaba in a negative way. First of all around the planned IPO, ANT,s value was estimated at 300 billion and Alibaba has 33% of shares (so 100 billion in value). Since the ANT cancellation until now, Alibaba has lost 200 billion in enterprise value (with stock markets at fresh records). ANT value has declined but certainly not to zero, so the market is clearly overreacting. The fine is settled now and only considered 2,8 billion, this creates certainty for us shareholders. Furthermore, a forced divestment of Jack Ma from ANT is painfull for him (I feel sorry that he is pressured this much by the CCP, it feels unfair) but does not directly involves the stake of Alibaba. Off course clarity about ANT would be more then welcome and clearly the CCP and ANT are looking for options, but I think this could take a little longer. Just make sure not to sell by al these uncertainties, Alibaba stock price is already reduced twice the complete value of ANT (overreacted) and since the fine there is a little bit more clarity. My advice would be to sit tight, China won’t kill it’s own diamonds, only wants them to listen a bit more which they made clear already. They now seem to prioritise to settle things quickly/this year and this will benefit Alibaba in the medium term IMHO. Good luck and Alibaba is a Pearl that will shine one day, just make sure you hold your shares tight."
250$ 245$ open tomorrow?
"In addition to the fine, I was curious if there were any onerous added conditions that would affect Baba's biz model ... here is what I found in the Peoples Daily ... it reads harmless to me ... GLTANote: if Hang Seng goes up tonight (its been pummelled last several weeks), that should bleed over to Baba and we have a double rainbow (lol !): regulatory certainty + stronger general macro""In accordance with the principle of combining punishment with education, the administration also issued administrative guidance to the group, requiring it to conduct comprehensive rectification and submit self-inspection reports to the administration for three consecutive years.""http://en.people.cn/n3/2021/0410/c90000-9837748.html"
I now call 200 in 2 weeks
May see $20 up guys due to huge short covering!
I sold 4 months ago
"A lot of big US funds sold Alibaba simultaneously between 280 and 320 USD. And loaded on the low 212-227 dip and sold on the 270 USD top, bought low 227 sold 240, it is almost like the big funds can control prices rather than us retail investors."
baba going up
"Valuation: no denying PE ratio is near historic lows (20 would be the extreme level, it is currently around 25).Tension US-China: is near the peak, often when tension is high price is low and vice versa.Option chain: the options suggest there will be a level between 220-230 by end of the week, even though currently technically that seems unlikely because of the price action of last Friday.- Personal position: extreme overweight Alibaba - Technical recommended price levels to buy 226-227 / 220-223"
$WIMI $NIO $BABA $JD Let's just put it this way: Bears ask homeless people if they have any spare change !!!!!! 
Buy buy buy. Technical bottom reached it looks like
"Take Any Chinese bank stock and telecom as example, BABA is another pump and dump stock. Please explain to me why those stocks are down now?????????"
My charts previously said: 227/220/203/190 and doomsday 163.Those are the levels. I went all in 220 basically. It will likely take 4 months to recover towards 230. GOODLUCK my friends. Stay safe and healthy 
"GEE !!!!!!!!! I hope BABA goes up another ""TWO CENTS "" after hours !!!!!!! Don't you ??????????????????"
"In today’s market, you have garbage stocks like GME and AMC going up thousands of percentages, while Alibaba is barely up on the year. If you want to join the clowns go ahead and sell,short, whatever you want. However if you don’t see this is a long term winner, already solidified with a low P/E and mega cap with large names/hedge fund holdings... don’t know what to tell ya"
"I love this company. You’ll also want to purchase some Fisker on today’s pullback. They’re collaborating with Apple on design of EV vehicles. And with Foxconn to manufacture for the Chinese market. The stock is oversold today, even after a handful of upgrades."
"Yes, this is down. but you should be happy that in this OVERVALUED market there is a high quality high growth high value and low valuation for Alibaba. Stop complaining about daily prices and buy when companies are under value and sell when over valued with no growth prospects."
Guys is BABA undervalued?
"Calm down! If BABA was a person, this is just a parking ticket – suck it up and move on. Now that this uncertainty is out of the way, the stock should move higher as they’re going to continue to generate cash-flows and profits. Stock basher assumes that BABA’s investor was caught by surprise AND didn’t price-in the uncertainty regarding the investigation and fine into the price. $2.4B sounds like a big number, but it’s just a parking ticket for BABA!"
Jack Ma is kinda sus
"Massive news removing so much uncertainty and what do we get, only about 7% higher than the bottom.."
"Forward p/e around 19 now, possibly 16-18 if any earnings surprises. Seems hopless but thats usually when the upswing starts"
"Good evening Baba Share holders !!!!!!!! Do you want to hear my $ .02 Cents worth on here tonight ??? Oh , wait a minute !!!! Your already got your $ .02 Cents raise in the share price after hours !!!!!!! SORRY !!!"
"Red day number 17 out of last 20 trading days, let's go."
"SP is doing well today given that volume has tailed off, if it holds green that would be pleasantly surprising (to me) at these Volumes ... watch HK 9988 tonight!"
Put my shares to close in 3 weeks with a sale of 268 . Thanks shorts
let them sell.
"We look for Alibaba to have an extremely strong calendar 2020 year-end into early 2021, driven by two main events. First is Global Shopping Festival, Alibaba’s major shopping bonanza that typically takes place on November 11 and was formerly called Single’s Day. For 2020, Global Shopping Festival has been split into a three-day pre-launch period (11/1/20 to 11/3/20) and Single’s Day itself on 11/11/20. Shoppers can use the interim period to cue up their purchases on the main day. In 2019, Singles GMV surpassed 213.5 trillion yuan ($30.5 billion) in GMV; the expanded format in calendar 2020 will likely result in extremely strong growth in GMV vs. last year’s one-day event.In February, China will get to celebrate Lunar New Year much as it has traditionally been celebrated with family meetings and gifts. Early in 2020, the pandemic hit China full force during Lunar New Year, resulting in stranded workers, cancelled celebrations, and muted gift-giving. We look for an exaggerated ‘make-up’ Lunar New Year celebration in China."
MMs are setting up a bear trap. It's going to run. Why do you think they pumped it to 240 a while back? they're buying it up and it'll soon show.
Buy and enjoy the fruit long term. No worries
"Let's see !!!! What is the fastest way to lose money on a stock pick ???? I know , I know !!!!!!!!!!! Buy more Baba shares !!!!!!! You will be sure to lose money !!!!!!!!!!"
institutions will start getting back in. i see no resistance until 300
How is it possible that the stock market is at the highest level in history and the Baba who has the greatest growth is lower in the year?
BABA bag holders Conference call is scheduled. Pls bring your own coffee and chair !!
Baba and red days are best buddiesThe communication and collaboration between the two is sublimeIf it rises more than 2% and holds it I will pass out with shockLook at those year end PTs - down they come
"Compared with Amazon, BABA PE ratio = 1/3. Amazon PE ~ 60, BABA PE ~ 22. Huge discount for BABA share at today’s price"
HSI sold off. Something is strange in asian markets.
9:58 Kathy Woods news came out today that she does still own some Alibaba _about $147 million whike chasing other Chinese stocks…. story continues￼
250$ comming
This wants to break loose. Added more on today's slight dip.
When BABA goes up shorts sits very quietly.
chinese govt is making it hard to believe in investment opportunities in that country.
"Buy with confidence., BABA headed to $260. At current levels, this is cheap and a great price to buy and hold. LONG BABA"
Amazing. Such strong performance shown by BABA. just instills confidence in the public.
Jimmy Z whatever money you are expecting from shorting BABA just start a gofundme account and once BABA goes back to $300 maybe we'll throw some pennies your way out of pity
Bought 50 shares more! Easy money
I think Julius This is what Buffet is always reminding. Once in a rare opportunity there times when you must be greedy when others are fearful.....This is it. Jumping to stocks on the rise can make money but not big. However greedily buying stocks in the dip when others are fearful is the rare opportunity that comes not often. This is the time you can buy many shares at ease with no competition to increase your price limit. It is because few are buying. This is the opportunity to buy big time and make enormous profits.
"Soon it will be the one year anniversary of Baba hitting the all time high in June 2020 of $ 223.00 !!!!!!!! In one FULL YEAR BABA CASH returns= ZERO !!!!!!!!! So, all you BABA holders made ZERO EARNINGS PROFITS holding on to BABA !!!!!!!! While the simple S and P 500 index funds are up 65 Percent over the same time !!!!! You BABA holders must like to lose money !!!!! HA HA HA !!!!!!!!!!!!"
I can almost hear Jimmy’s bank over the phone requesting to increase his margin
"BABA will be 250 very soon, so will OMER. (just do some DD) [1] Narso approval July 17, or sooner, and with adequate launch supplies, I would assume price negotiations are already underway, with the relevant parties. [2] The Narso MAA application, to the EMA, should be submitted by June, and approval from the EU may very well come by year end. [3] Very good chance we see some I-SPY Covid results by June, and those results could be best in class. [4] OMS 906 phase 1 results should be out by Sept. A once monthly subcutaneous complement pathway drug, as a follow-on to Narso, would enhance our buyout value tremendously. [5] IGaN trial enrollment greatly delayed by Covid (N=280), so likely no results until late Q1, 2022. [6] Once approval is in hand, for TMAs, a substantial capx raise, north of $30/share, should take place, enabling a full phase 2/3 Narso trial in Lupus. [7] I was surprised by Greg's emphasis on GPR174 for cancer, and am hopeful we see an IND, by July. A broad based onco therapy, highly synergistic with many types of cancer treatments, might be worth five times the current MC, by itself. Last, with a broad, and extremely promising pipeline, OMER is very deeply undervalued, here"
Bloomberg says ASIAN STOCKS READY TO RALLY BIG TIME!
The more they make the more the Chinese Govt will find ways to penalize them and take their profits..... I’m out!!
"Alibaba just started a 10B buyback program. Do you think they were buying on Thursday and Friday at the lows? Do you think they buy again on Monday to add to the momentum to start a massive rally? Oh, and what about the shorts that will get stomped out and forced to buy? Massive squeeze, massive rally. Get ready longs!"
Welcome $225s...YEAH BABY!You were warned.
Why buy Alibaba? Why take the obvious risk with this China company?
I thought the stock would tank. Im glad I was wrong. My portfolio is looking good again. I only have three stocks. BABA MSFT GOOG
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
NNOX is up going thru short squeeze. $BABA $BIDU $NIO $GME
Now that the fine has been imposed and the amount is manageable with Baba's high growth. I think the P / E is at a very attractive level compared to the other Mega Caps.I see BABA jump to $ 300 very quickly.This is a stock to keep in the long term and you have to have some exposure to the Chinese market.
The good thing about market manipulation is that it can stop at any moment as institutions find new victims.
"The “hits” keep coming...BEIJING — Stock index giant MSCI said Wednesday it is removing the U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba from its global indexes, and replacing them with Alibaba’s Hong Kong-traded shares.The move, set to take effect after the close on May 27, could see trillions of U.S. dollars tracking those indexes leave the U.S. Trading volume for Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares, which is a fraction of those listed in the New York, could also surge."
"Down trend is over ,60% growth with 19P/E ."
Beautiful chart! Will it hold 200 by earning release?
Price has to with etf buying HK listings and selling US listing.
"BABA is getting it's foot in the door on Vietnam, sounds like a good investment for them and me."
Take away the 1x penalty and this was a blowout report!!!!
"havent see any rationale for $baba and $jd falling these days, except some news says the central bank in china is considering doing fintech themselves...their internal structure decides they wont be competitive at all but they have all the powers to make the rules favor them...if true, indeed a short term negative thing for everyone"
"My charts see $ 210.00 a share for Baba very soon !!!!! It got very close today !!!!! I have been correct over the last six months , since I dumped all my BABA shares at $310.00 !!!!!!! I will be right again , very soon !!!"
are earnings going to include the 2.75 billion dollar fine? just wondering if it will show on the earnings on next
"Baba shares have been ""DOOMED"" , ever since, they hit $310.00 a share !!!!! All my charts predicted this decline in price !!!!!!!!!!!! You were all warned !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
on its way way way up!
Also we closed higher then the close in HK for the first time in the past 8 trading sessions.
Confucius Says.....AH SOOOO ......SOOOOOOO Many Bagholders !
"Some facts:- 11 out of last 13 weeks ended lower than the week before- Price is 34% and 23% lower than Oct 2020 and Feb 2021- At the bottom of the long term trendline- Oversold according to technical indicators- Alibaba's PE ratio for fiscal years ending March 2017 to 2021 averaged 36.4 (source: Finbox), while current PE is 23.4"
"Jack Ma is being house arrested, BABA will become a state owned company, China is being isolated by other countries due to imprisoning 2 Canadians there and threating their neighbors, the company will eventually be delisted in US like CHL, the whole world is mad a China of bringing the Chinese Flu to the world, do you really still want to invest Chinese companies based on the above fact????"
Is HK mkt closed today?
"Fine released, investigation uncertainty removedBABA shareholders shrug, low 230s remainThis is such a sad stock"
$WIMI $BABA $JD down couple thousands after tommorow and i'm not even worryied  buying more.
Took a quick look at my Baba Financial charts today !!! All Arrows pointing downward towards $ 200.00 to $190.00 a share soon !!!!! Chinese Gov't still has Baba on their radar !!!! If I owned Baba I would Sell ASAP !!!
Kathy woods now saying selling Apple & her other investments are all set up for a good 25% compounding annual return.￼ The sell in May has set her back 30% from February and 9% this week. Baba is down 15% since February & 2.5% this week. We all know earnings it’s gonna be a blowout; we just need a little up news just before and after the earnings to keep momentum going and 30% by the end the year for us should not be a problem￼

"The garage dumping n journey to 180, 150, 137 has just started !!"
"Looks like the "" GREAT JOSEPH "" was right again today !!!!!!! Baba continues it's decline in value on a Daily Basis !!!!!!!!!! Soon, it will be $210.00 a share just like I, the "" GREAT JOSEPH "" predicted !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Tomorrow will open 240
Big green tomorrow

So happy I dumped all my Baba shares at $310.00 !!!!!! Made more money investing those gains into other stocks that are going higher !!!!!!!! So happy !!!!!!!!!!
"***18.3% GDP direct beneficiary *** 34.2 % vs 28% expected RISE in RETAIL sales!!! ***undervalued, huge growth ***innovation, and now we know it has full CCP back up after wrist slap!! ** TAKE OFF confirmed*** Next Stop 260-280!!"
"Key Dates to watch:May 13 earningsMay 14 -Filing deadline for the last quarter.Two major filings to watch:1. Berkshire Hathaway ( after Munger purchase, Buffet could not be far behind)2. Pershing Square Holdings ( Bill Ackman sold all of his stake in Starbucks and is adding a secret large cap value stock for his PSH fund as a replacement )One or both could invest in BABA."
Never bet against a $600-B company that is growing over 30% year over year just because of some overhyped news stories.You have been warned.
"220 is the ultimate support area, I would add more but I’m already using margin and I don’t want to go broke if anything wrong happens lmaoGood luck tomorrow"
Tesla and BTC are inching back to reality. Perhaps so will Alibaba and Gold gain to where a market leader with massive growth and a true store of value should be during times of inflation.
Whens earnings released?
BABA stock is at a funny place right now...if it gets any lower ppl will rush to buy due to an already ridiculous cheap price becoming cheaper...if it gets any higher ppl will rush to buy thinking the long awaited rally has finally started... in the meantime the stock is just moving sideways..
Taiwan pandemic soared out of control! Be alert! TSM could be #1 be of the risky investment! Take cash for safety!
$250 tomorrow
"C'MON BRING IT ON, I'M ALL IN"
"pitme; thx for the reminder about that article (Barron's) about the next payout Here's the opening part of that story:""Altaba has made two significant distributions to its shareholders under its liquidation plan. Now, the company, formerly Yahoo!, is expected to ask a Delaware court for authority to make another sizable payment at a hearing scheduled for April 20 to 22.""Let's see what the court agrees to on 4/20-22Here's the entire article if anyone's interested:https://www.barrons.com/articles/altaba-expected-to-make-another-big-shareholder-payout-under-its-liquidation-plan-51612975321"
"BABA price now is slightly over 215 HKD, that means 221,5 USD per ADR. But we know Price in US does not follow HK strictly and tends to be weaker, so I suspect it might slide even more if HK price does not go up..."
What's all that noise ??????? Is that noise coming from outside my window !!!! People jumping from buildings !!!!!!!
"Today’s SP is running nicely. We need to get to $240 before I feel we turned the corner. $240 is the magic line for me as it’s appr 75% of the peak back in Oct. I’m very appreciative of Charlie stepping-in and adding sanity to the SP. Some really informative posts from Folks over the last while, much appreciated and GLTA!"
Probably this week won’t happen a lot of volume maybe only Friday. I can see a more volume starting Monday
I think thegovernment told goldman sachs to keep this mulinartional chinese stocks down and out I havea list of 25 chinese stocks all down they have beem shot down any time they get a little momentum
$240 is strong resistance. Need to break $240 to see next leg up.
"Hm, shorts and pessimists seem to forget the result of last weekends “bad news”. This move only betters Chinas view of Alibaba and Ant as they are modifying practices to align with governments demands. See ya Monday."
Did anyone else see it up 7% AH? What was that...
Not the right time to buy BABA. Don't believe the pumpers here.
Nomora Benchmark Morgan Stanley all in news today slashed price targets 1%- 2% this year all still above 300 though; all three came out today and set it. {They also held buy ratings} Then on CNBC article about delisting Chinese companies. Also today news of closing Jack Ma school. Max Pain also hit today for the week of option expiration PIET called exactly right 225 level he said by Friday this week which shows the stock is running on pure technicals absorbing hundred percent of bad news and not even 5% of good news For any reason Charlie Munger got in this week is for the fundamental analysis & now should coincide with Forward moving target charts in the upcoming weeks & as negative news dissipates and with graphs showing rebounds we can’ get to the 300 level as other firms have held thier overweight ￼￼￼￼￼& buy ratings
"Hedge Fund Sachem Head Capital Management run by Scott Ferguson initiated a new position of 605,000 shares - one of the fund's biggest holdings as of Mar 31, 2021.Investor Mohnish Pabrai purchased 168,843 shares of BABA ( 14.61% of his portfolio ).More filings will be expected by Monday!"
"Charlie Munger Bought Alibaba Stock ... that is good enough for me. Buy, hold and be a winner, when you put your faith in Charlie Munger's genius."
Berkshire’s move is not a coincidence. They knew the fine a week ago. Up 20% for sure
"Hopefully, this will reach $200 this week, so I can pick up additional shares for next week's earnings :)"
"I am scheduling BABA bag holders conference, pls bring u r coffee and chair !! Pls remember, don't bring Made in China chair."
At some point we need to put the blame on management and stop blaming “manipulation” or the press
"DON'T DREAM TOO MUCH !! IT'S HEADING DOWN. NOTHING PERMANENT, STABLE & STRONG IN CHINESE."
HSI seems to have bottomed out on the 1YR_ positive for BABA & HK  BABA too!
Went all in with $227.5 calls
This is how the market would look like if the retail investors are the only one who trade stocks such as baba. The volume is pretty low. The greedy hedge funds are the main and driver of this market. Once they start buy and sell the price eventually moves. We are just bunch of small fish waiting for the whale to shake the waves.
Where did all my BABA cheerleaders go to ???? Why are you ????????
I bet big on oil in December not BABA.
"Good job Chinese buddies.Leave the rest to the nasdaq, 5% tomorrow"
"The moment Alibaba moves, it will make near verticle moves with high volumes."
Only down 2% in HK. Projected earnings growth of 40% is so ho-hum.
BABA is a steal at this in this market.
I don't understand how Alibaba earns 150 billion in earnings only in China where as Amazon struggles with earnings and revenue compared to Alibaba it has world presence.
Added again {}
"investors need not worry about regulatory actions, all techs will follow the same rules yet baba will remain at an advantage regardless, its business is so large and flexible. CCP doesnt want to harm the nations companies, it wants them all to thrive and that's evident by their actions so far and by the tiny slap on the wrists with a couple of billion fine which is pennies compared to babas annual earnings, the fine was nothing but a warning to companies outside of baba to play fair or they'll be next, perhaps others will not get off so lightly...."
Baba will up huge after the news
Great bullish comments on cnbc fast money 300 here we come
Jumia strong pre-market along with all the other Ecom stocks $MELI $EBAY $BABA etc... Great article on JMIAhttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4423644-jumia-remain-long-stock-q1-2021-results

"If ER is done, anti trust news is over, market is overvalued and Ant IPO a way offWhat is the catalyst for BABA?"
More bears on the forum. Price at a 30%-60% discount depending on what American equity you compare it with. Near the low.
BABA green is all temporary like any product from China. Jump before anyone else.
It appears the same hedge fund is controlling baba and bidu. They shortnboth at the exact same time repeatedly.
Looks like it can be one of a day for us; strength building up. IBD pumping about RS line which has and is showing strength
"Kudos to whom they bought yesterday! Still it?s cheap bellow $215!It will bounce hard today!I won?t be surprised if it closes over$220! The reason they missed was the $250 million they paid to #$%$ government., otherwise, there bottom line should of been very profitable like top numbers!Baba will grow as Amzn in the future! Just buy and hold, it?s at almost 52 weeks low! Very low PE"
Look at the earnings for big tech (AMZN FB APPLE). YOU DONT THINK THIS PANDEMIC HAS BENEFITED BABA?! Give me earnings!!!!!!
BABA only down 2.50 ! That's a WIN !
Retail sales in China grew 34.2% YoY!!
"Don't worry about how BABA is trading in Asia. Aside from last monday when Hong Kong market was first to respond to the fine, typically Asia follows the US stock market. It is down big in HK right now because BABA was down big in the US today. BABA on NYSE is normally the stock leader"
They are saying this latest price action is clear evidence of the baba delisting soon to come. That is what they are saying...And Im saying...YOU...have been warned.
 1 MILLION shares purchased at 6:11pm est
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"When market open, it will turn Green. Baba always bounce back once it dip down to 230. Then up again and down again."
"these days, rational thinking doesnt work for $BABA, $JD, $BIDU"
"Your living it longs; it’s called sit back and enjoy the ride. Some bought IPO some at 300 when they heard more about it that alibabas has come even more bigger with  news, some purchased on the way down to 275 but through the hardships & pain after we climb this highest mountain the views will be even better. ￼￼￼"
"Well, we see how market react when a chineese stock is affected by US tax raise!! lol! Long BABA!"
Bidens tax plan and Bidens RUNAWAY inflation could sink ALL BOATS except for oil ...twinks . BABA included . A stock is still a stock no matter how good a company is.
Is EPS using the division by shares in all their markets or just hk market shares?
"Good Afternoon , BABA "" BAGHOLDERS"" !!!!!!!! According to my Charts and Figures , Baba has only $15.00 more to go down in price to hit $210.00 a share !!! Do you realize I sold off all my BABA shares at $ 310.00 a share a while back !!!!!!!! You should have listened to me at that time !!!! Since then , I have made more money in other investments with that profit coming out of selling BABA when I did !!!!!!!! I'm all smiles !!!!!!"
"In the current price the following have not been priced in: world war 3, financial crisis part 2, nationalising companies, etc. The doomsday scenario, other than the above (but not limited to) have basically been priced in."
WE will open Monda$189.00Good Luck

i still hope the price will go down so that i can add more and more of it .... this is the best buy right now wonder if it will go under 200 then i would literally thik to go all in on it
"A forward P/E of 18 for such a growth monster is just laughable, I’m continuing to load the boat on $BABA and 100% sure the valuation will reach a fair level soon ($300+ in short term)…"
Pe ratio of 25 incredibly low!
All the pieces are set. Enjoy the journey
$BABAMaintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 320 » USD 300 Maintains Benchmark Buy USD 315 » USD 310
"Let's play ""predict the NYSE open for BABA at 9:30am""!!!! I'll go first.......$227 Don't say why...just give us your prediction. Thanks"
"Seeing some resilient action from BABA. If it wasn’t a down day for the broad market, it would’ve gone up at least 1%. Outperforming the NASDAQ today, poised for a breakout."
"I only see upside from here. 1) Gov review over 2) ant restructuring set, ipo likely eoy 3) cloud profitable 4) China covid over and only true growing economy. I’m expecting share price rise into next earnings and spike after mgmt addresses 1-4, especially cloud."
Last of the week(s) to add at this price; been getting many chances. Earnings next month will gradually lift up to 241 range & when does from there only minuscule short term gaps to fill on the support side compared to the higher price resistance levels to break _ next 12-18 months very bullish
"How does it feel to see Amazon quadruple, while Baba doesn’t move an inch?Are Baba holders moving to amazon?I personally don’t care about amazon. BABA makes more money than amazon. And has more investment opportunities in the emerging Chinese market.We should be at least half of amazons stock price considering our float size! We make more Money!!!! That’s all it matters. We basically own door dash in Bangladesh and half of every Chinese dollar goes to BABA."
"Man !!!!!!! You Baba shareholders are doing GREAT today !!!!!!!!!! At this rate Baba will be $310.00 ( That was the price, I sold all of my shares at and told others at the time to do the same ) a share in about five years !!!!! Everyone who owns BABA shares should set their WALL STREET ALARM clocks for 05/03/2026 !!!!! That is when Baba should be $310.00 a share !!!!!!!! Just be Patient for another 5 Years !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I heard about BABA the other day on (http://Pick-stocks.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Days like today only prove that the Stock market is Truly a "" RICH MAN's game !!!!!!!!!!!! All other's need not apply !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
price difference between HK and NYSE is narrowing down day by day ...its should be 212 as per HK closing.
I think BABA has been waiting for HS Tech index movement. Since January it follows it. Before the probe BABA was trading with a premium to the index. After the probe announcement it fell bellow it. It synced recently after the short bump to the 270s...
"Chinese politics on Alibaba: it is just a tool for hedgefunds to scare retail investors out of their shares. I know people in the goverment in China, they do not intend to destroy Alibaba like US media tends to say. Rather: they want to curve the power and protect the consumer more and allow for more competition, since that benefits China in the long run."
There will be a meeting of the $300 members tomorrow at 8:00 EST
It’s over guys. This isn’t Amazon. It’s not Tesla. It’s LK 2.0 That’s free advice
"This just shows how fast things can change, don't wait for a better entry. Just average down a position if you like a company."
So proud of BABA’s persistently of staying red  Time for bad holders to change diaper 
"Terrible day for Alibaba stock, fundamentals of earnings were great but I think many retail had calls and margin calls losing a lot off money to the smart money. They are loading up, bottom most likely is close, we will see."
"My one Baba Tech sheet today was right on target !!!! Baba , did DIP below $210.00 for a while today !!!! I never go into battle without them !!!!!!!!!!!"
waiting for sub 200 to buy another 100 shares. it's not far off now. just let the 10 year get to 2 percent and you will see the opportunity
Ant will launch IPO again once the structure is in place. Bullish. Cloud is another big market and I believe Tencent is the only competitor.
"Lets see how a fine of 0.44% of the market cap affects the price. It should fall as little as 0.44%, if it falls more then people are too emotional. Long investors have nothing to worry about. This stock will be 300$ soon"
Are 19 P/E is to mach for 64% growth ?Crooks are stilling the shares from peoples.
"How much do we lose this week, the China gov't has ruined this stock and discouraged investors !"
Down 4K but I believe in BABA this valuation makes no sense... id avg down but my pockets are empty
What rally? Joke....
Ok looking for advice. I took out a home equity loan without my wife knowing to throw it all on BABA because you guys said it was going to the moon. I've lost half of the equity in my home. Should I borrow against my 401k and throw it on BABA to get it all back? Thanks for any financial advice.
"Fantastic news about the probe, one green day and then 8 red days and counting. Just can't believe it."
"I read this post on another board, but I thought it fitted the Baba board perfectly with all the trolls on here, the worst of which I've already muted. This information comes from an interesting article about paid bashing on the Aussie exchange.Fact:Bashing is more prevalent on US stock exchanges than on the Aussie exchange. just common sense imo.Bashing is not always paid bashing, but on this board the number of bashers/trolls is very high, which actually is a bullish sign:1. Institutions, firms, and funds want in at a low price (and yes, they are accumulating shares as we speak)2. There is short interest3. There is unusual options activity because not only are people selling calls against their position, people are straight up betting the farm the stock will go down.FACT: The more a stock is bashed, the more interest there is in artificially keeping the share price down. The good news for us longs is, this can only occur for so long. People in the know- know how incredibly well positioned this company is. It is one of the biggest in the world and will grow by at least 35% a year. A year!Nothing will hold the SP down in the long run. Nothing."
Bears wrong again.
"""Everyone thinks that great earnings will be the saving grace for this stock. You realize that EVERYONE expects the earnings report to be fantastic right? Nobody has ever criticized this company for its earnings and growth, but for all the risk and uncertainty surrounding it - both from China, and from the US.I believe an amazing earnings report is already expected and priced in. That means a great report will give us a small boost, maybe 2-3%. Anything even sort of resembling an earnings/growth miss will be devastating, perhaps bringing us even below $200. More downside than upside in the short term here.""Remember that post from 2 days ago, where everyone was saying how crazy I was??"
There's no liquidity on the market to support all the stocks. Only the ones that are in the index are being pumped.
"HK price doesn’t even matter at this point, Alibaba was red in the NYSE on days it was up in HK. Just gotta wait to see the price in morning"
one more push and we are at 200 today. it is doable guys. sell
Having a really hard time understanding this
Bloomberg finally stopped talking about 2.6B fine;  
BABA breaking 200 soon. My cat is ready for it.
earning is not important since this is china share...
The whole market sold off and baba held strong .
Still have minutes to sell !!!!!!!!!!!!! Do it today !!!!!!!!!
"I'm wondering, what happens if Alibaba gets delistend on the NYSE? Do you lose your shares or do they get transferred to another exchange?"
You have to compare AMZN with BABA and it turns out that AMZN is a little boy and has a valuation of 3X of BABA
“China will allow its companies to flourish” - Charlie Munger
"Facts: Alibaba lost 262B in value in a little over 5 months on a 2.8B fine.2.8B is only 19% of the 17,745B free cash flow of dec 2020 and is far from the maximal fine they could have charged. "
BABA is much more a growth stock than TSLA or AMZN
Digital Yuan Will be on the Ant platform
"Baba now falls into the value stock now in comparison with its 30% growth. The company forecast revenue for the year ending March 2022 will rise at least 30% to more than 930 billion yuan ! I order stuffs from Aliexpress than Amazon as it is cheaper with the wait. An over 330 dollars value stock is at discount at the moment, I would not hesitate to add."
"Sold small amount last night at 233,6 hkd at the open; spotted some weakness last few days.Note: we are 1-3 months within the range of the bottom.Downside risk: 220 / 190 / 150+ (doomsday, FIRE MISSILES pew pew China-US). Note: war is good for oil stocks."
I just don't want any black sheep tomorrow. Regulatory slap at the day of earnings or unpleasant suprise coming from Alibaba restructuring would be bad. If the earnings are bombastic we would rise probably. If they are excellent/good/ in line/bad price would further decline with higher or lower probability of recovering in coming weeks. We will learn much about Chinese economy and consumer sentiment as well...
Buy some Huya too. They are as oversold as any stock I’ve traded. They also reported good earnings.
Your comments get deleted if you talk about JB
"No worries , now you can buy TESLA and PALANTIR .....They go down faster than BABA"
"Joseph where are you?, you predicted that tomorrow Baba would be at 215. Why you no type?"
Daniel: Anti monopoly investigation is complete- no other investigations outstanding.Only ongoing M&A review - same for all peers
"maybe, this might be your last opportunityto acquire shares at an unbelievable discount . . . I am long BABA "
"Imagine selling baba near its 11 month low, with strong support around 223, 6 trading days before earnings, with at least 40% revenue and forward pe under 20. Insanity"
"Down 3 out of the 4 weeks in April...you would think that was a terrible month. But that one week saved BABA and it heads into May about 3% higher than it began the first week of April. BABA ends the month UP $6.59...which sounds great...but not the route it took to get there...Week of April 5-9 - down $1.05Week of April 12-16 - UP $15.38Week of April 19-23 - down $6.61Week of April 26-30 - down $1.13This final week of April was shaping up nicely (up $4.64 through Wed.), but BABA gave it all away and then some. Earnings are on the horizon in few weeks...hopefully that brings some good news and higher stock prices (but that's not always the case)."
Support won’t hold because this stock is already too bloated and fat. See you at the Covid crash price last year. More free advice
"Another (negative) news report (believe me Im trying to find positive reports):Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA) is worried about how Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ: AAPL) new privacy rule changes will impact its business, according to a report by The Information (via 9to5 Mac).What Happened: Alibaba invited half a dozen marketing industry executives last week to discuss how the company can protect its revenue following the introduction of App Tracking Transparency on iOS, as per the report.However, the meeting at Alibaba headquarters in Hangzhou was reportedly not able to come to a consensus on how to deal with Apple’s new privacy policy.The privacy rule changes will result in user permission becoming mandatory for displaying targeted advertisements. The privacy rule changes will give users more privacy from mobile advertising but are unpopular with app developers, many of which are small businesses.See Also: Ant Troubles Not Over? Jack Ma's Relations With Regulators Said To Be Under Beijing ScrutinyWhy It Matters: The Jack Ma-co-founded company is worried whether Apple’s new privacy rules will adversely impact its advertising business, which accounts for 40% of its total revenue. There are more than 300 million active iPhone users in the country."
Was 187B in revenue in USD?
Here is to hoping $224s by EOD!!! CHEERS!!You were warned.
"$ 210.00 a share for Baba is not far away !!!!!!!! Soon, $210.00 Baba shares will be here !!!!!!!!!!"
Unlike American companies Chinese companies can only survive in China why would investors buy companies can’t go outside of China?
"Baba is a 350 usd stock, the valuation is a bargain, most likely the biggest among all high capitalized tech stocks.I am adding, we will see here a huge Rallye to 350 usd and more. Fundamentally this stock is an aggressive buy, a no brained. Little bit patience and you will be rewarded very much."
Didn't expect this after the bloodbath in HK. Finally a green day. Hopefully the first of many to come.
"US inflation looks going through the roof soon, so US stocks have to fall.But, China inflation looks benign, so BABA goes up through the roof."
"This selloff is just a nonsense, plain market madness. Fellow holders, stay calm and don't panic sell."
"5/11/21(Bloomberg) -- Vanguard Group and Ant Group Co. plan to boost capital at their joint robo advisory in China just weeks after the U.S. fund giant announced a surprise pull back from the trillion-dollar mutual fund...... Vanguard is betting on its tie-up with Ant after ditching plans in March for a wholly-owned mutual fund license. The venture gives it a presence in a retail market that could grow to $3.4 trillion by 2023. High costs and the lack of competitive advantages likely prompted Vanguard to drop its bid for a license, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Francis Chan.Read more at: https://www.bloombergquint.com/china/vanguard-plans-capital-boost-in-ant-venture-after-china-retreatCopyright  BloombergQuint"
"Baba fan boys getting their just deserts, I am surprised this has not Sold off more"
About 12% of trailing eps. One time event. Puts the overhang to bed. Now it can start to move back up.
- lots of cash- very healthy balance sheet- valuable hidden assets - experienced management- e-commerce and cloud market leader- cloud business taking off- operates in fast growing marketsFeel free to add
had to buy at this price.... historically drops after earnings then goes up after ... so won't be surprised if that happens again
"BABA margin calls in effect now, and watch for forced selling on this. BABA buyer's remorse !!"
"Companies like $AMZN, $BABA, $WMT are going to have to turn to companies like $RKFL in the very near future, as the rise of Cryptocurrency is upon us. The ability to use Cryptocurrency for what it's suppose to be used for, currency is just the ground breaking technology driving RKFL forward. Only 24 million shares outstanding, you'll be watching news on it soon, but by then that will be hedge funds and other companies trying to make profit on you. Right now it currently sits at $3.30."
Softbank selling 18 billion worth of BABA shares...this is the next VIAC
"What is this flatness, it was the same on Friday?"
"@yolo Difference is, QQQ is now overvalued, unlike Baba is now extremely undervalued, I know which one I pick "
Added 800 HK shares to expand position from 700 9988.HK shares to 1500. 1500 shares of 9988.HK already takes a significant space of my retirement portfolio. Bullish over very long term. Go BABA !!!! 
Unfortunately 150 shares is my limit.See you @450 usd on late 2022.
WHAT happened BABA shareholders ???????? LOSING more Cash !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good to see this out of the way...now it can begin its run to 500 per share. Boolean
"Alibaba Group Holding Limited could provide elastic computing, database, storage, virtualization network, large-scale computing, security, management and application. Well, do you agree with these? However, these other companies could be led by a strong management team along with past involvement in major discoveries What are your thoughts on it? Share here! This post is sponsored.

"Wow, not sure if I’ll be around in 10 to 20 years. But I do agree that it could do what Amazon did, only much faster"
"Alipay was 100% owned by Alibaba till 2011 when Jack Ma spun unilaterally spun it off into a separate company ( controlled by Jack Ma ) despite opposition from Yahoo, Softbank and other major shareholders. A settlement was reached between Alipay and Alibaba where it was decided that Alibaba will get 37.5% of Alipay's pre-tax profit. It was really a bad deal for Alibaba shareholders ( through their proxy companies like Yahoo or Softbank since Alibaba was still private). That spinoff now became the world's most valuable private company. Before the IPO, Ant Group exchanged a 33% stake to Alibaba in lieu of the 37.5% pre-tax profits.When the Reuters rumour ( I call it a rumor since Reuters also claimed that ANT was selling the 30% paytm stake in india - a claim denied by ANT and still holds true since ANT did NOT sell any stake in paytm) was released today morning, it was a dejavu moment if only it was true - if Jack Ma was made to divest his majority stake back to Alibaba who was the rightful owner of that stake in the first place. ( google search ""alipay group spinoff alibaba 2011"" for news articles about this).The good thing to look at this news article is that all parties want to come to a conclusion soon. If it means selling stake back to Alibaba, that would be great for Alibaba's investors since we will be getting a major portion of ANT pre-IPO. If it goes to someone else, the loss is not ours either - ANT IPO will bring us increased valuation.There are other negative news articles that were released since yesterday - signs of desperation by hedge funds out there trying their best to shake off retail investors into selling their shares. Their desperation is very clearly visible since their urgency in releasing simultaneous news articles can only point to the fact that there are not many sellers in the low volume days since Monday and any news about settlement of ANT IPO will make the stock go back to where it belongs ( based on technical forward P/E estimation)Hang in there and you will see 300's soon !"
"SORRY LONGS, there is a lot of sell left in the tank for baba, we going to take it red right out of the gate"
"Crazy world we live in with people buying all these hyped stocks and coins, but finding a heavily discounted stock like BABA too risky.."
I would expect a big up. The uncertainty is away and fundamentally baba is 350 usd worth.It is the biggest company in the most growing market China and is busy in growth units.For me a strong buy.
"Honestly, the earnings report was very impressive: Revenue +64% and organic growth +40%. Operating profit grew 48% exclusive anti-monopoly fine. I was modestly pessimistic, but this company is doing really excellent. I think the share price reaction is exaggerated. This company is oversold."
Sorry Jim and Joe but its going to be a steep climb from here and theres lots of gain ahead. I dont think you guys have the capital for whats comingYou were warned.
"2023 EPS guesses goes to $12.53 from $14.68. Quite a haircut. On the bright side, because the stock has been rightly hammered, the forward p/e has dropped to 17x. That seems compelling..........but it's seemed compelling before."
"Alibaba is for most big investment funds a piggybank and a tool to make money on writing options.Whenever a big fund needs money to buy other stocks, they break open this piggybank."
"Longs and nerds are hoping that with their minimal baba profits they can buy a ""souped up"" 1974 Ford Pinto. My what lofty goals.Consider this a warning."
"Baba is a 350 usd stock from fundamental aspect.Ibis a bargain, but political risks are overestimated and are still weighing on BABA stock price.I am patient and will hold my stocks. Fundamental aspects is more important.Too many big hedefunds are invested in BABA.For me a screaming buy."
Be Greedy when Joseph and Jimmy Z are fearful
Baba to the moon!
Wonder how much losses there will be in today dead cat bounce? Tee hee.The warnings shall continue.
holding for the long game . the day when china market will be the biggest in the world
250-260 is a fair sp for short term
I can hear the song Rock of Ages Being sung by BABA shareholders in the distance .. The close will be interesting. Do they bolt or buy ?
taobao is Alibaba‘s website portal platform. when you click on to buy on Alibaba it goes through TAOBAO. the news that came out this morning on businesswire [not barons] is the platform now has a live streaming service {this is like as if Amazon had A live streaming service which they don’t} like Facebook does. Imagine the opportunities for in the future of this turning into a different social network. This is positive because it’s done deal and mostly of its future possibilities
Digital Yuan on ANThttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222067.shtml
I was wrong. Hence I just bought a billion shares of BABA. Who's with me comrade ?
all analysts know that BABA should cost $ 500- $ 600
240 next week guaranteed. Look at open interest in options
"I dumped all yesterday at $214, and I’m glad I did, after going through their fundamental and balance sheet if they are true, who trust communist country, it will take very long tine to recover. I rather invest in US where the great companies are here!"
They just keep saying this about Jimmy Z!!
How could you not buy BABA at these levels? Please sell so I can buy more
Reuters: Ma seen in headquarters; earnings announcements going to have some great surprises￼
I don't see why we would need Ant IPO to end uncertainty. The antitrust probe has ended. There was a slap on the wrist and the new playing field is clear.Alibaba's management emphasized they don't expect more investigations. That's says enough right? A clear sky I would say..
"This episode for BABA reminds me of the FB scandal and the 5B fine. FB sp is now at an ATH. The sp didn't shoot up instantaneously, but it recovered just the same."
"Quite a strong finish in HK pushed shares to 237,8HKD. This would be equal to some 245,4 USD. US premarket does not reflect this. Yet..."
Geezuhz Haych Kriste. It’s gonna go negative! Back to zero percent gains over a FULL YEAR! Zero! S&P gained 40% over that period!
"cannot break 50dma and cannot support 20dma, we are heading to lower 220s more likely now....hope it can hold the 222 threshold, otherwise, much lower can be expected, news wise, really need some positive outcome from ANT IPO 2.0..."
"What these last few months have shown me is that this is not a company that cares about its investors. Any other reasonable company seeing the price action and news stories would have come out with a statement to encourage investors. But this management remains completely silent. They are losing support every day because they dont deserve support, to be honest."
Thank you for the bargain babies!!!
"struggle to hold 220 today...maybe just dont look at your account and come back one week later...should be much better by then...low vol drop means no sell off but dragged down by the market, really dont see much alternatives with 500B + cap, that's why I think th emoney should get rotated back in sooner or later, but short term, really has no crystal ball"
"This is still so cheap, 300+ is going to be reality when ANT ipo is in action."
"The Alibaba casino will soon be open for business. Spin the wheel, make a deal.You were warned."
Any pop on earnings will probably get sold . Folks want out of the stock market after bidens tax and inflation screw ups ....that will tank the economy and markets.
Congrats longs !!
The pig can barely maintain the $210 level...LMAO!!Heed the warning.
"The only problem with BABA is China. Otherwise, it would be another Amazon."
how can you buy this investment when you know that the communist party is in control ;)
Last chance to sell over 200--journey to 180-137 has just begun.
Imagine when the market starts to bounce where baba will go!$250 plus. Y end of May!Short squeeze will start soon!
One shot fired in the South China Sea and longs will be lucky to have a bag left to hold.
"A call out to intelligent shorts. We have too many low IQ, low information trolls here like JimmyZzzz and Instigator who most likely have no position in BABA at all and who just crave attention. Just look at their posting histories to see how wrong they have been in the past.It's healthy and good for longs to see an informative short narrative, such as you'll read on forums discussing TSLA or FB.BABA is the perfect stock to hold in the mature stages of this bullish economic cycle, imo. Big cap duopoly of Chinese tech with a rock solid balance sheet, good future growth rate, and not at bubble prices like other tech names. As the cloud of regulation is removed, and the ANT IPO comes to fruition, we should expect to see BABA's PE start to expand."
That was a big buy my dudes
What caused this sharp loss?
what just happened
"why did yahoo finance remove Argus research data from BABA ticker page and other inside subscriber data, that we PAY FOR???"
"Some data about April is released today:'China extended its impressive trade performance in April, with exports unexpectedly accelerating and import growth hitting a decade high.'Exports in dollar terms surged 32.3% from a year earlier. Imports were also impressive, rising 43.1% from a year earlier."
"Most larger investment companies and institutions have been slowly Dumping their Baba holdings !!! You can see the results of this over the last Two weeks !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Soon , it will be at $210.00 a share or maybe even lower !!!!"
Ive signifiantly lowered my expectations with this one. My 20-30% year goal is Down to 8%. Im still long only because I am treating this stock like a bond/fixed income part of my portfolio where I wont drop a lot and should manage to get a 8% yoy return.
"Difference between ANT IPO and No ANT IPO: fundamentally nothing.The stake of Alibaba in Ant Financial is still the same; the only difference is that valuation on Ant Financial could potentially pull up Alibaba due to excitement, and people understanding there is more to Alibaba than just E-commerce."
$ 210.00 a share is in my forecast for BABA shares !!!!!!!!!!!! ALL ABOARD !!!!!!!!!!!!
"Listed alphabetically, here are seven stocks that could be the next GME: • Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) • AT&T (NYSE:T) • C3.ai (NYSE:AI) • Fastly (NYSE:FSLY) • Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) • Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) • The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD)"
People will feel sorry when baba announce earnings this week. It will be back to 250.
"BABA is showing strong resilience, though down 2.57% it is least down compares to other high tech peers like aapl, amzn, fb, googl, bidu, Pdd, tcehy etc.... it should get back to its previous high soon."
"Yesterday, Charlie. Today, Rob Vinall.$BABAI’m buying more."
The volume is crazy. The battle between bulls and bears. Bulls are winning so far
"Green by end of day, me confident"
closed bit down in HK. Still much higher than yesterday close in US
"I am sticking to 137 on this. Not more than that. The real slide hasn't even kicked off yet. The day it breaks 210, u will thank me for selling higher !!"
Bidens tough talk on China clearly having an effect on stock.
Approaching the 50 dma.
I’m buying more!
"Baba is the cheapest large cap growth stock in the world. P/E next year is 16x. At this price even if it’s growth is 0, it is still a cheap stock."
I’m receiving a bonus from my job next week.Please keep the price down so I can load more shares.
"Sachem head 605,000 share purchase reported 13F filings. It will be very very interesting to see what Berkshire Hathaway reports in their filings over this weekend as well￼. Sachem:The New York-based hedge fund bought 605,000 shares, making it one of its biggest stock holdings on March 31, 2021."
Huge earnings push this to $250+ easy.......
"Last years dates with price per share movements points, there was ant  news though now same fundamentals; look how fast went up between dates6/29/20 211.78 7/9/20 268 9/1/20 298 10/27/20 319"
"As now, I would like to congratulate someone who bought BABA today at near the bottom !!!"
Chinese tech has outperformed the broad markets in the past week. Now it's time for the broad market to have a good week to add fuel to Baba's move upwards.
It is unfortunately I own 100 shares of BABA but it is fortunately I did not listen to all the long who tried to pump up the stock. To them even bad news can be interpreted as good news and someone even wished stock going down so they can buy more!!! Any long guys ever think about there are some bad news we don't know? Most of you just blame other financial companies tried to pull the stock down so they can buy it cheap!!!
"Down over 100K people，I cannot take it like a man anymore, somebody pls help me stop the bleeding, pleasssssse"
Last quarter's estimated YOY revenue growth is now 67.70%.
"We are at historic lows of babas PE, this is the one of the most bearish times for this company.Be patient and you will get rewarded"
"14,338,200 shorted as of today in HK. (2.91B). Compare this to 5,845,800 shares (1.264B) shorted as of yesterday."
Personally I would be happy if it trades sideways for 2 months (looking to add more).But option chain is telling me by 18 june 2021 price will be 230+
"If price of good rises, so will the sales volume for BABA who can set the price of services. The price from the BABA site is cheaper than from Amazon, I love to shop at Aliexpress with a much cheaper price than Amazon."
Nice to see baba still plummeting after hours.You are warned.
$198.00 in Hong-Kong and $ 209.00 in New York .... Looks like someone keeps price up until downloading. No point buy ADR if shares are cheaper and no dividend payments.
Why don't you guys sell more ? haaahaaaa+
210 is the new bottom (also was the old bottom of December 24th. Hope we close above it.
"After the big drop on earnings, last days show strength in the stockprice. Nasdaq is down and Alibaba again holding up. Good to finally see this strength, it’s the beginning of a reversion of the trend and we will move higher in the coming months (and off course years)."
"This stock is being shorted, and being traded back and forth..to keep a lid on it. It takes a lot of financial backing to keep a giant like this in a range. In my opinion...cooperation is essential. My humble view."
"Nothing about the company has changed, this stock is being held down purposely for Hedge fund to buy them at a low price. it's not just about manipulation it also deceit."
"Just bought 60 shares, good company, good price, and hopefully a good price recovery in the coming months."
BABA buyer's remorse !! Check it out down.
"There are plenty more DIPS ahead , YOU DIPS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"On Monday/Tuesday of last week there was huge call buying of BABA call options bought at both the $240 and $250 strikes expiring this Friday. Big numbers in which if this does get above the $240 strike early this week, then in my opinion, some institutions knew this was coming. Probably did a weekly spread $240-250"
waiting for wonderful numbers.
"That close tho, omg"
Great performance today and finally no down pressure during the days which we have seen for weeks. Keep it going guys!
very soon everyone will get a price that is lower than the IPO price within a month
I'm not sure even Munger himself is enough to lift the CCP dark cloud hanging over this . It is great news for the long term though.
"If you look at historical PE ratio's on Alibaba, back in the end of 2017 Alibaba was trading at one point near a current PE ratio of 60. Currently we are trading near 25. For Alibaba to be valued as historically expensive Alibaba has to increase 140% from the current level."
"Seems like the mental patients have started to show up on this board. BABA is a good stock... but hard to see how it will actually move, because regardless of how good the earnings are, and even good or bad market conditions, this stock just seems bound at around this area..."
"FREE INFORMATION: Last friday I measured the max option pain (FOR THIS WEEK) at 232,5 USD. Today that rose to 237,5 USD. Does that mean a rise is on its way? Maybe. Maybe not. Do whatever you want with the information."
"May 3 we were at 238 for a while, 16% higher..."
So if BABA jumps 6% in Hong Kong why would it only be up 2% in the premarket in the US? Wouldn't traders capture the difference?
An under valued stock? Absolutely. Uncertainty removed? Preposterous. (disclaimer...I was long the stock but recently exited at cost) Will Ant's IPO be allowed? Who knows. Will analyst's EPS estimate decline beyond the 7% it has already dropped? Who knows. How much will margins be effected by the forced change in the biz model? Who knows. Is Xi done working them over? Who knows. Will they be forced to divest from more areas of business? Who knows. Will anti-monopoly actions become a permanent fixture in China's politics? Who knows. Will Xi allow a forensic examination of BABA's books by US authorities? Who knows. Just sayin'. Good luck to the longs. You deserve some.
How low will BABA close? 
"On a down day for a stock, I don't panic. IF I believe in the stock, I'll press it up."
"I am bullish about this stock, I always was; we know of the jewels that this company has, so all these jewels will be reflected by the market at some point. Just to support what I am saying: in the 70s, Buffett realised that the Washington Post had an enormous moat but apparently the market hadn't realised and its price was really discounted. Buffett started buying so much shares as he could; he knew that the stock market price was really lower than the real worth of the company. The stock price of WP dropped almost 30% in the following months, and Buffett kept his conviction. In the following 3 years was in red. BUt then, the market started paying attention to the WP, and it end up becoming one of Buffett's best investments (a 10 bagger!). We dont forget, that Munger agreed with Buffett about the moat of the Washington Post, and both were right. Now, Munger has invested in BABA, not in Alphabet, not in Facebook, not in Tesla, just in BABA among the big tech companies. Munger is not a guy who just buy a company with a discounted price, he really wants to buy a extraordinary business at a adequate price. My suggestion, is dont worry about your investment in BABA, focus on other stocks in your portfolio, BABA will florish at some point, and everybody who is patient will be extremely rewarded in the long haul, probably, a stock that will change many lives.."
"The good news here is that when the price get ridiculously low like BABA, strong investors get in the boat and never sell quickly. That what has start to happen with Munger. Once we have enough big players, the price will go sky high!"
Here comes the Hour of Dour!! Get ready.Blessed be the warning.
"What lesson can be gained from the last few months of media coverage? It has been both too pessimistic in past weeks and most recently too optimistic. If in fact uncertainty had been removed (despite what analysts have been claiming) we'd be looking at a $250 stock as of today. But it hasn't. At least institutional investors don't think so. OTOH, whatever bullseye Ma may have had on his back has been hit so many times Xi may finally be lighting up. But the takeaway still should be the biz BABA is in will be extremely well regulated in the future. A future full of potential landmines to step on. That's never going to change. At least not any time soon."
Best stock in China is Sands of China ...always up and no investigations from the government
In at 280. I’ll never see my money back
I ve always wanted to be shareholder of this company got in today..its paying off already
So was the miss part totally due to the fine?
Short chinese tech long US cyclical. Free money.
Skyrocket Monday
"Alibaba will not be de-listed. Not a chance. What an amazing opportunity. Get in now, that is an order."
 please stop talking about the option chain as if it is a crystal ball. It is not.
"The fundamental problem is from the individual investors without re-treat and all of individuals have the bullish vision. Then institutions don't come to buy at high, they want to buy low to make the big profit! During 4/12 re-bounce, one analyst gave the comments, asked individual investors not in until institutions in. And Chinese market has a lot of e-commerce competitors, typically with the low-price competition. BABA profit margin will keep down with time if BABA wants to keep the revenue up, there is no choice."
Wouldn't be surprised to see the stock rocket upward on Monday. This is a big step in putting this mess to bed. Longs looking good.
Can BABA holds its tiny precious gain until close so the bag holders can celebrate? 
Pray the MM doesnt leave this opening gap at 221 otherwise at some point .......90% chance
"More hopes, dreams and pie in the sky from the Dreamers and Longs. Baba will not get better but will get worse.Consider yourselves warned."
Even if I go down 50% on BABA....my 8 digits investment porfolio can take it....so stop wasting your breath.Counting my profit everyday. Bye poor people.
"Th is amazing buying opportunity will be over very soon.BABa Is a 400 usd stock minimum.All other stocks have rallied 25% and baba was 30% down.For me.....strong. Us and all in.The biggest opportunity with a big techstock with the biggest growth potential among all companies.Retail, Health, financial, cloud services , media, press, etc.Antfinancial IPO will happen on 250 usd base."
"""Beautiful chart! Will it hold 200 by earning release?"" Ya, Alibaba down from $310 what a beautiful chart!!Consider this a personal warning."
"Shorts are not happy campers tonight. The minute they heard Charlie Munger was buying, they should have covered."
BABA back on track - vector points up.
Bought few more @X5
Why are hedge funds bailing out of Alibaba?
Exceptional quarter even if Stock doesn't go up - 32% growth is a lot for a company this size
They mentioned increasing innovation and investments. Wonder if they will invest more in XPENG?
"I am ready to buy more, but it looks like we touch the bottom. Get ready for the long run to 300$ and more!"
It will go up much higher.
"When will the average Chinese citizen/investor be able to buy BABA stock? Soon, I hope. Now would be perfect timing."
"NYSE close of $235.92 = $228.60 HK, and HK closed at$226.40 yesterday. Would like it to close above NYSE of course and build leapfrog momentum."
Alibaba is significantly undervalued at the moment. Strong balance sheet and profit growth is extremely fascinating. Buy the dip!
My sources are saying the delisting detail could be mentioned in the next conference call...thats what they are saying.Consider yourselves warned.
Another blowout quarter
Consolidating for next week's gains. This will see 250 no questions asked.
 show BABA some love  straight  from here
"So far all macroeconomic data has been better than estimated. Alibaba must have better results than estimated as well, one would think."
I love the people selling because it’s low. If you liked the company when it was more expensive why wouldn’t you buy more now?
"On May 1st we'll know whether Buffett added Alibaba to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. We already know that his friend and vice chairman of Berkshire, Munger, likes Alibaba, so who knows. Would be very positive news as many investors follow and mimic Buffett's actions."
Just received a bonus from my job.Please keep the price between the 222-228 range so I can load more shares tomorrow.
EASY 3% - 5% TODAY Credit Agricole SA
NY has been underperforming compared to HK for a week now. Strange.
250 today?
"I hope for the 223 gap fill this week, then a blowout report, then a 20$ spike in 2 days. But that would be too predictable and manipulators dont do predictable"
Up or down on Monday?
"A very healthy balance sheet, double digit growth in both e-commerce and cloud business for multiple years to come, huge profit margins, strong management, I mean, what else can you wish for?"
Two big names bought into this stock! Charlie Munger and Mohnish Pabrai. This is a testament to the quality and future of this company. I bet they are betting on the benefit from the 33% ownership of Alipay through Ant.
I just want to see a solid $4.
I have 400 shares at 221.4 I am hoping it goes to 190 then Im buying 2000 shares with a average cost of 195 Im an old man but my grandchildren will be well off .
"The fact that shorts are working extra tells me what we longs all know..now that unknown has been known and probable forecast of Ant ipo on Monday's press call, BABA is moving up from here and rightfully so."
under $215 is a buy
xD reading the messages here to get some stock info. And closing this page only knowing #Joseph doesn’t have a life LOL
BABA is at the bottom and will nowhere to go but up with 300 B cash
"I bought Yahoo in the past, sat for a while on a loss that eventually doubled my investment, sold that and invested in Baba at 70.00, sold that at 190.00 (bought my house with the profit), rebought Baba at 233.00 and I know for sure its going to buy my next big purchase... not plain sailing and I had my losses on other investments but in the end I took my chances with a company that will make big money... just stayed the course through all the negative talk."
"Where are all those KNOW IT ALL BABA shareholders hiding out today ????? Come out DAVE ( DANNY BOY ) !!!!!!! Come out Willie ( WRONG WAY ) !!!!!!!! Tell us all how BABA will go up like a ROCKETSHIP today, after earnings are posted !!!!!!! WHERE are you ""LIDDLE BOY's "" hiding ???????????????? Come out and face me !!!!!!!!!!"
Charts are still for 210 to 180 to 137. Get out before this happens. It's CCP company.
Mohnish Pabai and another 1 billion Indian people buying Alibaba shares now... All India willing buy more shares of Alibaba... Price will go to moon now.

“ happy that this is behind us“. Not aware of any other regulatory issues. Although he did say that the anti-monopoly investigations are ongoing for others in the industry.
"Congrats BABA on the $2.8B fine to close the case. Pay it, learn the lesson, and move on to greater high!"
New bull run starting this week.

"The fine is really a relief....it’s close to a best outcome, if tanking more next week, I will increase my position"
Cloud computing is going to be huge for the decade to come! Best player in a private country with one of the biggest population!
Triple bottoms have occurred at 222. It should be on a course of rebound next week. The consumer market in China is taking off and the cloud adoption is just starting with hugh market.
Buying the dip
"Munger was wrong about Posco and Wells Fargo. Now this. He made his money off of other people, from commissions, not by investing his own money. And people still fall for this old trickster?"

Be patient."

I just love it when people give me free money. This company is already making more than 2X profits compared to Amazon. I'll give BABA an intrinsic value of $1 Trillion (with mild growth). You do the rest.
2 Words.....Bagholder andTIMMMMMMMMMMBERRRRRRRRRR
"we'll close in the green today, get your shares at a discount rn.."
Loaded up today
This valuation is rediculous. I hope they are buying back all they have allocated for buybacks at this price. Should also institute a dividend like Tencent to gain interest.
"Alright buckle up, enjoy your ride to the MOON.…"
"While AWS accounts for only 12% of Amazon's revenue, it makes up 59% of the operating income: huge profit margins. Amazon's e-commerce on the other hand isn't that profitable. Imagine the possibilities for Alibaba. It does makes huge profits in e-commerce and booming cloud business in Asia will act as the new growth driver once e-commerce growth slows down. Then Alibaba has two major sources of income."
Outperformed Nasdaq by 2%.
Think I must be the only one that hasnt muted a single soul lol.. I like hearing good news and I also like to have a laugh at the ones that talk #$%$ then dissappear on good days.. Every ones sound in my book lol. Be interesting to see how many shorts are still here in a couple years ? ?
"If any Chinese stock sneezes, BABA catches cold."
this is going to be fun now! this Stock is seriously the best bargain in the stock market
"“FRIDAYAlibaba's reform plan dueA report to China's market regulator is due Friday from Alibaba Group Holding, updating the progress it has made in correcting anti-competitive practices on its platforms. Earlier this month, China's State Administration for Market Regulation slapped a record fine of 18 billion yuan ($2.75 billion) on the e-commerce group for violating anti-monopoly law by using its power to prevent merchants from using other platforms. Regulators also demanded that Alibaba submit self-evaluating compliance reports for the next three years.”May see small pop Friday"
"BABA will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect BABA to post earnings of $1.91 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 46.92%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $27.92 billion, up 72.95% from the prior-year quarter."
"I'm so happy, not only for me but for all longs here. Last months were so hard, BUT WE DID IT !!!!"
Charlie Munger just bought $40B worth of BABA at $245.... I'm in.
bottom line baba was a big hedge fund favorite it's not anymore. this is not a bad thing now may 22nd as it was done in the 1st quarter as in past tense. calper's sold all their stock. new positions were taken by other firms. buffett sold airlines and then they took off like a rocket ship.
"Alibaba is the Amazon of China, it seems Amazon did preeeeety good on there earnings, and so will Baba. +++++++++++++"
"Let's hope China retails sales come back bad, BABA may rally then. Because here's why US rallied today, you can't make it up:A 2.9% rise in motor vehicles purchases was offset by declines in spending elsewhere. Sales at clothing stores tumbled 5.1%. There were also decreases in sales at sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book stores. Sales at building material stores slipped 0.4%. Online retail sales fell 0.6%."
"Looks like we are getting price upgrade from the finance community ! Needham , now JPM... good luck shorties !"
"CFRA rating change was Jan 5, 2021. Now 4 months later the same thing is rehashed to hurt BABA again?Where is justice?"
"Personally, I sold 1/3 of my position @234,4 (241,04 USD)I had ZERO cash. I had 100% invested in Alibaba with average buy of 223 HKD."
"It's alarming that Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and JD all blew out revenues with yoy growth and guidance. The market was luke warm about all of it? The lower these go the larger our returns are going to be. Even if the market puts 'Verizon' low valuations one these companies, the stock will eventually track earnings growth."
Regulator ghost put to rest with one time charge and fueled by great segment growth all over. BABA is heading back to $250-$300. Always do your dd. Added 200 more shares. GL
here come the red ... if this staybred sfter earning I will withdrawal all my assets from equities and never back again.... more chance there to make profit in casino or crypto than investing into profitable growth companies ....
"In times like these, people just gotta remember a stock price doesn't accurately reflect how a company is fundamentally doing!"
I have been waiting for this. 100 shares will be ordered this morning. Just keeping an eye on it for the 1st hour.

Pain this week: 225Pain next week: 235The week after that one there is not enough options to make sense of it. Charts say 250 is high resistence.
250$ in few days
BABA is like REDFISH !!
Planning to be a buyer tomorrow. Anything under 250$ should be a steal. Don’t time the market people and just buy

Bled so much on this. Sold long position and will be shorting it. Hopefully i will make up for some of the losses.
Can someone please remind me the last time this steaming pile had an up day?!My memory cannot take me back that far
That's it! I'm selling!
$300+ in no time......
time to cover shorties..... we are not stopping till 350
"I am so bullish on BABA, it's my largest holding. The forward P/E ratio at 18??? Give me a break, for a company that's growing revenue 40-60% YoY. The one time fine is irrelevant IMO.Give my latest vid a watch, and cheers longs!https://youtu.be/HlClXCmVQ4E"
"Horrible sp performance. Show me one US company with the fundamentals and earnings of Baba that has sold off like this. There is no US company with these metrics trading at these multiples. If baba was a US company, it would be at 1000.00"
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"JD, PDD and Tencent fell as well. It's not about Baba, it's still about the regulatory overhang.."
That's it. Im going to sell everything.NOT.Let's light a candle for all people selling at the bottom.
"If we hold this profit we have moved above the 50 day moving average today. Moved above the 20 day last week and they are crossing each other in days (20 crosses above 50 most likely next week). This is a bullish sign and the phase of bottoming out has passed, it’s time to rise."
markets red in HK and UK .... what surprises me its-8% at softbank on record profits yesterday ... any thoughts today ??? baba turns red in HK as well .... things not look very promising 
time to cover shorts.
Just bought some shares !
News is out fined 2.8 Billion [.5 or 1/2 of 1% of market cap] Maybe Charlie Munger purchased before a rebound
"BABA is fundamentally more than strong buy, it is a screaming buy."
"I analyzed all the numbers when I first invest in BABA, but I would be curious to calculate forward p/e if the company was stopping all its investment and was buying back there shares will there actual cash. I think"
Once again it has been proven that Jimmy Z has superior stock knowledge to all you Ne'er-do-wells. LOL.Jimmy Z ROCKS!!You are warned.
If you miss AMZN don't miss BABA 250$ soon
+2$/week until pps 300$. Slowly but surely!
At the last minute. Got 500 shares @ 231. Next week let’s see 240. I admit I am not a long. Hopefully l will pick up a few dollars by next week.
can someone give me a Chinese companies not hong kong companies where they have been around for more than 25 years and their stock prices have been steadily going up
"BABA looks like a Royal Flush, if it goes under 200$, which is totaly impossible to me, I will be all in"
$202.50 in Hong Kong ..... Good discount ! Let set correct price in USA ...$219.00 is too much now
Look at the open interest on the calls and puts next week. Puts have a lot of interest around the 200-220 range. Calls have WAY more interest at the 250+ range despite being much further away from the current stock price. Very telling of the positive direction we’ll likely see next week.
if you adding more thumbs up if you selling off or shortinh thumbs down !!!! I personally added more ... risky
Oh my gosh oh my gosh after this post I just looked Charlie Munger says by Alibaba not treasurey bills!!!!!!!!￼ Charlie does it again!!￼
"The fact that BABA has a lower market cap than TSLA is mind-boggling. In reality, BABA should be in the same ballpark as AAPL/MSFT/AMZN/GOOG."
MEMO TO SHAREHOLDERS: Look at the money flow charts....look like reversal about to occur and either way IT IS NOT CONFIRMING A CONTINUAL OR PRESENT DROP IN PRICE....this is NOISE to AVOID and just STAY LONG AND STRONG KIDS. Boolean

this is a very weak and disappointing response from baba with the market up so much.
My choice for tomorrow: BABA or ROKU. Small position that I don't want to think about for 10 years. I've narrowed it down to those two. Who thinks BABA is the right call?
Last quarter's estimated YOY revenue growth is now 68.00%. Growing higher every day.
"Out of the last 18 tradings days, 15 days ended in red."
This is just another retail investor favorite and big money is out to punish retail investors. This will go back up as will many other stocks as soon as wall street feels they drained us for all they can.
"Longs know at this point amount of fine does not matter. It's the closure to unknown matters. Market can't keep 30% yoy growth co. at 20 x forward PE..LOWEST AMONG ALL FAANG STOCKS. Up or down...matter what happens Monday, it's a win for longs. If it dips, longs will buy more because ultimately we know where it's going by year end."
"Anyone breakdown the last 10days of baba price action, volume and volatility what picture can it possibly be painting. 300 soon "
"The uncertainties are clean and all the bad news were out, it is normally the best time to load up again. I am in as the fundamental moat has not changed. This is why Charlie Munger would like to have a share."
Not selling I am down 2.5%. A drop in the bucket. Case closed.
Looks like another down BABA Pre Market open coming in 40 minutes !!!!!!
"This decision cleans up,Allerheiligen uncertainty of Alibaba future.The penalty is not a problem for Alibaba. It has to adapt its business Modell, but will be a big cash machine in the further future.It is better than happens nothing over months.Now it’s clear....baba will be a cgreta company and maybe it’s fine because it will be a company which acts with more compliance as in the past. It is comparable to Amazon, but with a much better market which grows much faster, and there has nothing changed.A pe of 25 is ridicolous low and a bargain, China’s consumer world will grow for next 10 years and baba will from with it."
So why exactly BABA is down in ore market?
love the weekend news releases
Baba is back
Lil ride uptown to see the lights then back home to the $220s.You have been warned.
If i read 'regulatory overhang' anymore ill snap lol facebook has ten times the regulatory issues and has received bigger fines than baba ever will and that gets pumped and recommended everyday
$200 tomorrow
Great news for Baba it removes uncertainty and all they have to do is say they will comply
Might trade at 13 X eps by next year. Free money fed is getting scared.

"Putting things into perspective for today. BABA closed last Friday at $209.51. The low last week was $204.39 on a closing price. If this stays where it currently is down over $6, It's still up for the week. I Believe the low was put it last week, and now the trendline up is still intact. There will also be weeks where we are up $6, and a lot more. You can't keep great companies down forever. Tides turn. Energy and Banks were dead 6+ months ago, never coming back. DEAD! No use for oil, deflation is here to stay, negative rates. Where are those 2 sectors today? I made a lot of money going against the grain with them. I've made a lot of money on BABA, and recently invested more since it's way out of favor. BUY!!! I'm not alone, Munger bought as well. Keep the Faith, as Bon Jovi would say."
"Baidu inc $Bidu P/E under 18 , $JD P/E under 14 and $BABA P/E under 23 Chinese E-Commerce and Tech stocks get no respect all three companies are smashing earnings year after year with massive growth ahead in soon to be the biggest economy in the world"
Setting up to be another day of baba losses. Oh YES it is!!You are warned.
Morgan Stanley know BABA will be delisted in US 3 years from now. Sell the dead beat before it is too late.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/13/msci-to-swap-alibabas-new-york-shares-with-hong-kong-in-stock-indexes.html

If you’re looking long here you’ll be rewarded. Don’t panic sell. One of the most fundamentally sound companies out there. It’s going nowhere but up in the long run. If it falls to 200 I’ll load up up another 100 shares
What time is Earnings Report? Is ER before market open on Thursday or after market close.
It's amazing that a company as large as Alibaba continues to have high growth rates like they do. Glad I have no need to sell anytime soon. Ridiculously undervalued here.
Won't be surprised if we get back to $230 in the nyse today.
$305 before Christmas.
I am advising all of BABA share holders to DUMP their load at the MARKET OPEN !!!!!!!!
Set my buy price at 195. I'm all in at that price.
On a positive note: we are up still over 10% from the 52 week low
Thank you for the 3% discount todayNext week try to add another 5% so I can buy your shares 
Guys I wanna go all in on this stock but how do u feel about thr VIE structure risk?
Seems like double bottom confirm up trend from here
Notice also News out Friday night after NYSE AH close & no HK as well ￼
China's been steadily sailing ever deeper into troubled water. Guess longs on here never watch the news....
This stock CAN NOT hold gain at ALL
"Come on guys, we need one of those rational cheerleaders to improve morale before next week. Nothing works here. Even max pain theory with its target 227,5 (230) was smashed two dollars lower with 220 getting closer and closer. Oh well, I am bit too sarcastic, I know... Good work Ironman, Caesar, meltdownBC, perhaps even Cindy."
"We tested 225 many times with v feeble bounces and the market is scared of inflation; hence, the break below200 and below is v possible if market continues to sell off imo"
When is earnings?
Two quarters from now Alibaba will = Revenue of MSFT.
Pretty low volume.
US$ equivalent of 209.29 i HK.
Did the Archegos collapse involve baba? I've seen a few sources that included it
they only lower the price target by $10-$12??? wow that's awesome. still have the support of analysis.
"When will Baba lift off, go to the moon and all that other non-sense? Anyone.....?You were warned."
Baba will never hold this high prices. Just a matter of time before back to the $220s. WATCH IT HAPPEN!!You are warned.
Waiting for Jimmy Z to come on and roast us all.
"Where are all the $300 members, haven’t heard a squeak from them in awhile ?"
"CFRA...a New York based company, downgraded both BIDU and BABA today to sell ratings. The shorts are very pleased indeed that this double sell came out of left field today. It may help them comfortably cover and buy at the bottom. It must be nice to have the ability to trash two stocks, with absolutely no hard facts to back it up....and not be held accountable. This double call should be investigated fully, for any possible conflict of interest. But it won't be....LOL. In my humble view."
The Fed doesn't use its resources to salvage non-American stocks.
"Do not hate the move down. Keep doing your job and safe money to invest in profitable businesses for future returns.  Do not limit yourself and also look at other companies.On my list: Amazon 2700-2750, FB 225, MSFT 190, Google 1400-1550.I own Alibaba."
HARK ....I say unto thee .....behold the 223 cometh
BUY tomorrow am last if the pre-earnings lower levels over next few trading sessions [due to options expiration current level]
Alibaba annual active consumers in China beat analysts' predictions by about 20 million.
Is baba and other Chinese stocks down because meiutian and the poem the ceo took down?
Wow trying to delete cash that the company previously reported ahead of potential legislation requiring US auditors access to their financials if they want to remain listed.
Even a 1000% growth in earnings and Ant IPO woulnd't move this stock.
"Money money , I love the stock !"
"Looking to buy more here - let the weak hand sell, more cheap shares for me. The long term is all that matters with this stock and it's mega bullish :)"
This Chinese kids are actually holding the line better than the nyse.Tomorrow is gonna be a good day
$2.8 billion may be a historic fine and shameful but we are all glad we are moving forward. Baba must abide by Chinas rules and regulations even if it means sharing data. This is a bullish news!
"China seems to have a national team, they will probably increase favors and would push up the stock price to compete with US to claim the title of the world largest tech company."
I am scheduling BABA bag holders conference call. Pls bring your own coffee and chair !!
HK closed just below NY price. Up to NY to show the way.
Taking off in the Asian markets
My communist play in BABA feels just like that.
Note NYSE close of $229.88 = $222.80 appr. Hang Seng down 1.5%. Expect red tonight in HK.
There's a very wide base built up in Baba at the 225..235 range. Stay strong & long.
This stock isn’t an investment. It’s a punishment!
"Charlie Munger buying over 37 million USD for Daily Journal and saying this is equivalent to USD cash holding!! In other words as good as us gov issued money, I bought a lot today this will pop so hard 1 trillion company! STRONG BUY"
"Here we are at the end of a Record Breaking week for Most stocks !!! Oh right !!!!! Then we have BABA shares !!!! Going down the Dumpster!!!!!! I was right about Baba again today !!!!!!! You still have time to sell this BOW WOW company , and buy some Quality American shares like AMAZON !!!!!!!! Baba is heading to $210.00 very soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
On the positive side I suppose it’s still higher than 5 days ago
Did you guys know that the 3rd most popular website in the world is Tmall? And Taobao is the 8th?
https://twitter.com/antgroup/status/1383412870377984004?s=21
gap at $ 223 .31 . It didnt fill so that is the quick sand you stand on each and every day holding this stock .
"There is simple rule on any of finance board to use: if someone keeps writing same message multiple times per day and don't write anything else, just mute. Don't waste time reading useless post. It is really time wasting to read 10 'go go' or 'down down' posts again and again and again. If you keep complaining about it constantly, you are not much better either :)"
"The low valuation for this company is absurd, imo. At some point, the market will have to look at BABA fundamentals and make the necessary adjustments."
"The digital yuan news should pump this stock.Let’s see the reaction from this Chinese kids, I believe in you"
Who is selling ?
Is it Christmas already?
Charlie Munger is in the house!!! 37 million invested in ali baba! !!
"Zack's ranks BABA a #5 (Strong Sell) - in other words, time to buy."
"Poor Chinese kids, they did a great job yesterday and now we give them this price hahahaAnyway, I hope they bring rationality to this stock."
"BABA was a great company, not it has become a dead beat as it has upset Chinese officials. The company will be disintegrated as Chinese government only want their people to worship their government and Chairman Mao and not the companies and CEOs. Never underestimate what a Chinese government can do a company. They have done it before and they will do it again. ANT IPO is dead as Chinese government don't want it to compete with their banks. You have been warned. Unless you are people from China, do not invest in China where it bring the world pandemic and threaten the world peace. Hong Kong and BABA have the commonality where both are screwed by the Chinese government. You have been warned. China will be sanctioned very soon."
"For those of you who still don't understand the impact of Charlie Munger's 40 million investment into BABA, take this into perspective: Charlie Munger invested $15 million in Wells Fargo and Bank Of America in 2009. WF Average price was $8, and his reasoning was ""We bought Wells Fargo & Co. stock when it was at $8, and I don’t think we will have another opportunity like that."". Since 2009, the total dividend paid by WF is about $14, and the stock is worth close to $40 now. His other holdings through Daily Journal are made when the stock was very cheap. Charlie Munger coming into BABA at 270, averaging it all the way to 245 with purchases when the SP went down clearly shows how undervalued he thinks of this stock. I am not sure if he stopped buying yet, since the SP is still below his average price and he could as well be adding more at this price. Al Gore's Generation Investment Management also purchased 1,544,863 shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), giving the stake 1.6% weight in its equity portfolio. Shares averaged $227.43 during the fourth quarter.Let's see if Berkshire Hathaway also purchased BABA during this quarter. BABA still does not give out dividends, but maybe it is time they do to attract other investors like Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet. April 16 Options expiration will be a crucial date to watch for the SP of BABA."
"All my stocks were down big time this morning, now I'm just down very little. I'm blessed if you ask me."
Baba is a solid company if you look at their books there will be a big correction on this within a year mark my words on that
"Baba is finally trading like a real stock, great thing to see."
"Amazing earnings, but where is the price jump...?"
What does higher-than-average volume mean with this kind of price action?
"I've increased my share count from 400 - > 600. It is now 40% of my holdings and I'm comfortable about it. Their push to become a PAAS cloud provider in China continues to gain traction (ebita positive) with Chinese enterprises and SMBs, and is likely to reap big rewards over the next few years. Their main cloud offering s like a Workday+Microsoft amalgamation (less office 365) that has proven to be sticky especially because of DingDing (Dingtalk). If the government follows through with strict anti-monopoly laws (subsidies), then their main competitor Tencent will no longer be allowed to provide heavily subsidised cloud services, and we should see increased profit margins to the 40+% growth in revenue over the next 5 years. Based on this growth trajectory, the cloud business is likely to become the size of today's local commerce business segment in 2026. I'm conservatively predicting $25M in revenue and 20% Ebitda. You do the math on what the stock price will be then.To back my prediction up are a few factors:1. Nascent Chinese cloud penetration currently 1/8th of the US. 2. Aligned with the biz strategy. Daniel Zhang has mentioned in interviews that he sees the cloud business becoming bigger than commerce.3. AWS's growth trajectory but reserved for Chinese companies in a shielded Chinese Market4. Decoupling of US - China tech. Chinese companies and potentially some foreign companies will likely find it beneficial to use Chinese cloud services at least for China operations5. Economies of scale from continued massive investment ($30B over 3 years on hardware, software and heartware) There is a risk that BABA might become too big and successful in the longer term. My guess is that the Chinese, competitive and result oriented especially when it comes to money, would be extremely proud of having the world's most valuable company."
"Small fine in relative terms. Stock will see weakness on Monday but will start climb back up again give the end of uncertainty. No more breaking up of the company or any other major anti-trust probes. If anything, this is ‘good news’. Hopefully the Ant group issue will be resolved soon."
Does Anybody know any details regarding Charlie Munger (warren Buffett's partner) Made a significant investment in BABA-per Bloomberg? TIA
Good chance to see BABA under 200 in HK within few hours
"Do not listen to the basher of bloomberg. They do so, because they are supporting short bets.BABA is a bargain, the biggest bargain among all tech stocks. A screaming buy.Listen to Charlie Minger and all the big hedgefunds which are betting massivly on a bis rallye in BABA shares.Fundamentally strong buy, a no brainer."
if you will believe 0.95 billion users in 1.4 billion China population. Baba don't preach. accounting China style?
Earnings are May 21 Friday 7 AM _CNBC showing Thursday the 20th in Hong Kong which would be in NYSE as earnings whisper calendar shows Friday the 21st 7 a.m. eastern standard time￼. Sentiment is 80% beat 84% positive and 94% green by analysts & even more positive which is all Fibonacci extensions are pointing way to the upside on all graphs by then May 16th including then the short term {3 month} & all the way to the three-year starting that earnings week￼￼
"Today baba shares closed at the Same price it was on June 2018 !!!!!!! Over three years , it has gone no place fast !!!!!! And , you Long's are Happy about that ?????????????????? Three years making Zero in profit !!!!! Not even ONE PENNY in dividends !!!!!!! And , you Mock and make fun of me , since I was SMART enough to SELL a $ 310.00 a share !!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT a BUNCH of FLUNKEE""S you people are !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I live in UK. And now when I search to for stuff aliexpress pops up
Let's go red again I don't even care anymore by now.
Buy and stay clam.
"BABA growth is limited as it can only reach within China but not outside, The way how Chinese is treating their neighboring countries, More sanctions will be imposed on China very soon. The stock will eventually go to $50 like CHL due to political effect. BABA is a great company but it is destroyed by its own Chinese government. Same as Hong Kong, it is being destroyed by the Chinese government. Very sad."
"It's laughable that BABA was trading at $208 in Jan. 2018 (practically still 2017), and now we're only about $20 higher. Don't get me wrong, I'm holding long term, it's just interesting to think about."
"Expected earnings for this year (2022, which started on first of April 2021) is 11 USD. This gives us a current PE of 20.5! This is with low estimate of only 11USD profit and not reducing the enterprise value with the cash position of 70 Billion USD. Reduced with the cash position the PE would be 18.2, insanely low and certainly undervalued."
Sold some WMT and bought more BABA at $225.25........Time will tell.
Baba to the moon 
"Want to see something cool: check out and compare TSLA 6 month chart to BABA 1 year chart [12month], they look exactly the same!Remember the 6 month on TSLA to the 12 Month BABA#TSLA #BABA"
"Extremely bullish chart. Shorts have covered, people are buying left and right. One of the most undervalued stocks I've seen in years. Congrats to everyone who bought, and if you haven't, what are you waiting for?"
"Well, compare to 10% of annual sales they can be fined, 4% is much better. Anyway, I believe they will comply and quietly move on from this overhang."
"Good news everyone! I'm beginning to lose faith in this stock, and usually when I lose faith I sell and then the stock explodes. Not selling but the explosion is coming, weak hands have been shaken out"
keep buying till it gaps up then get out. One way to play it... but that doesnt always work but most of the time. Wall street trade programms designed to fool retail buyers
Pabrai brought a lot of baba!!!
I keep seeing stories about how great and undervalued this stock is since I bought back in October around 270 and it hasn't seen 270 except for a brief blink before dropping back to 220's.
"Based upon BABA fundmentals, analyst forecasts, and the positive posts on this message board, I gotta wonder who is still selling shares?"
"MAX option pain for coming Friday now measured at 230. So hopefully that is a good bottom. Still hoping for the time we measure MAX option pain far above the current price though (last time it did, the stock went up +10% on the news of the fine)!"
How many winners did you have last month? How about this week? If you don’t get at least one solid pick in your inbox a week you are doing something wrong. Change that now by joining (http://Thetraderguide.com).
Fundamentals- it’s there folks. Do your own DD. Semper fi.
"From J.P.Morgan at 11 April 2021: ""We believe Alibaba's share price will respond positively to the penalty decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) as a sizable fine along with a correction of wrongdoing of monopolistic behavior such as forced exclusively is widely anticipate by the investment community, in our view. We expect the share price enjoy a relief rebound, as the current share price only implies 10x CY2022 P/E on Alibaba's core commerce with our updated estimates of profit impact from losing forced merchant relationship"" - At least J.P.Morgan follows the common sense this time. Please short more so the short squeeze can happen."
let's see what happens when Alibaba reports double digit forward EPS.
"Strong buy here on fundamentals. The market for e-commerce in China is MASSIVE and much of it untapped, and no matter how you slice it, BABA gets a significant chunk of it. Historically, PPS peaks in late October ahead of Singles Day (Nov. 11th) which is BABA's version of Black Friday and Amazon Prime day rolled into one (actually, Amazon stole the idea of Prime Day from BABA). So, 6 months from now, expect PPS north of $300 for a 30% return on investment. The day-to-day moves of 1%-2% can be traded if you like, but keep a core position as it will outperform the broader market over the next 6 months."
"Those who fear China should be more fearfull of USA. USA caused the collapse back in 2000/2001 when they increased interest rate, put anti monopoly rules in place, targetted certain big tech (MSFT in particular), and increased certain corporate taxes/regulations. Microsoft stock price was destroyed by needing to share its source code. And it almost seems like hedgefunds script everything with certain news at key levels. Opposit to the big data long/short position of retail."
Come on BABA! You are able to win this unfair game.
"If we close green today, I will order takeout from Panda Express."
Next Week......WELCOME TO THE100'S !
Is this what the stock is supposed to do before earnings- take a nose dive? Why the cotton piling hell is baba down so much in HK?
"Negative news now out of the way, longs finally get their reward. Upside huge. BABA on the move...."
"We will end in green today, mark my words"
added another 10k shares at 228 this AM 9988.hk
Year end $250-$300!!!!!
"Baba is bargain, a no brained.It is one of the biggest trade and tech companies in the world and this in the fastest growing market.This for a valuation of pe 23 is unbeleivable cheap.Most of biggest Hedgefonds have added shares in baba. We will see here a big home rum soon. The fair valuation is about 350 usd.For me a clear Strong buy."
"hedgefunds want your baba stocks for cheap, dont give in to the manipulation, hold long and be rewarded. No company in the world has better fundamentals and instrinsic value than BABA...literally no company on earth.."
Couldn’t pay me enough to sell my shares at current SP. Some people must really need the money huh
Think about just selling
"Holding 196 next week is bullish, but close below 194 and this potentially crashes to 114 by end of year. longs should have stops set at 184 just in case."
Everybody knew about the fine. I don’t get this stock.
"The key note is unknown source, Reuters is paid by shorts sellers for this publication, so go figure that out!"
"Even if  did not ever ipo it should not have to do anything with BABA and its fundamentals and technicals. Sourced media fixated on  ipo has connected it to the BABA name and technicals. This being said any ipo of  at any valuation, or even the schedule of the ipo will clear just another obstacle for BABA technicals to anew forward."
"Management grew business at a 32% YOY - what more do you want - they are doing their job, in fact doing so well they China punished them. You simply want a higher stock price which management can't control. They can only control growing the business - exceptional quarter by them."
It's so funny that HK is so confused about price action of the Chinese stocks in the US. They literally don't know what to do.
I lost so much money here today that I will drink like never before!!! Partyyyyy
twinks trying to trade BABA
"I believe the stock is undervalued, but dont see any catalyst that could make it reprice higher. What and when could trigger a repricing of this? Opinions welcomed,"
I bought more. Now 25% of my portfolio. Will trim Dec 24th @350 Average still lower than Munger!
"Only position I am holding, liquidated EVERY other position. What a terrible market this is. Today will be overall red as well. Let's hope for some good earningsweek on BABA, otherwise it's done to just leave the entire market.MAX option pain dropped from 230 to 227,5"
"Bloomberg fines, no , jack ma, filling gaps(presently down) Is all what this is about and has become; not the fundamentals & not the earnings￼￼ though when gaps have to be filled on way up it will be nonstop back to 317 at this point to fill another gap....￼"
"Congrats guys, truly happy for all the fellow longs here"

"A Quote from Alibaba statement:￼￼ Alibaba “accepts the penalty with sincerity and will ensure its compliance with determination,” the company said in a statement. “To serve its responsibility to society, Alibaba will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen its compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.”"
"Buy this bargain now, and you will be beter tomorow! In god we trust!"
"The only salve I can offer is China mkts usually follow America's lead, and not vice versa. The selloff is after US tech got crushed yesterday. This is not company specific, rather the tech sector is selling off. So keep holding and add. Will be adding to LEAPS position tomorrow."
Seeking ALPHA Article: Alibaba: Reality Discredits Relentless Media Bashing On Chinese Firms
Looked up AAPL fine March 17 2020 1.3 billion _ The stock went from 2/3/20 @ 76 down to 60 the day before the fine & the day of the fine went to 57 for a few days 1 1/2 months later The stock was back to 76 and never stopped since. Perfect example here Alibaba on 2/17/21 had a high of 270 down 20% {same scenario} ... A month and a half from now will be earnings. We can get an eight dollar dip on Monday or an eight dollar advance I don’t think either way is gonna make a difference I think news will play out in the coming days literally and after this is behind us also IPO of ant  news can come out in between now and earnings anyway and earnings is a month and a half from now and the charts are showing a bounce by the end of this month anyway. The most positive thing we got is Charlie Munger bought at the end of March think of that one really hard￼￼ ￼ ￼
if we touch 230 today W
207.32 USD on the daily / 203.64 USD and 198.31 USD on the weekly / 193.78 USD on the monthly--- these are the levels to add --- I'm buying for relatives at this point; for myself I need to wait a few months. Goodluck my friends.
Hows cloud growth? Thats the only number that matters.
Dark clouds are forming around Baba shares for the pre market !!!! It does not look good at all !!!!!!!!
Solid results but not the blockbuster that so many were hyping. Lots of issues to digest. Will need to hear conference call. Still great long term buy and hold.
"Berkshire Hathaway 13F will be released on May 15. If Warren Buffet follows in Munger’s steps, and invested in Alibaba, that would be great news. Let’s hope that he did and May 15 we will all find out !"
HK only drops $7 so far but no worry since BABA has cushion and can sustain $7 drop for another 30 days before it gets down to 0 
"I?ve been in since 104, but it is a real #$%$"
"3/31/21 Charlie Munger 165,000 shares ￼"
"So SPCE, NIO, RBLX and all these other junk stocks are green while Alibaba is down over 6 in a day. Makes sense"
"If we can get back above 210, it will be a moral victory.Even the drunk BABA shorts can root for that."
"Undervalued or not, as long as it grow fast, we will rise in the near future, all longs will be happy here. When you buy at this p/e, you don’t have any risk. CCP risk looks totally stupid, China want to be the biggest economy, and they need there best company, especially Alibaba, for their success! Relax and wait for cash from this cash cow with massive moat, just like Buffet."
"IT'S DIP BUYING TIME for BABA and AABB for Gold-backed Cryptocurrency..""newschain asia broadband ""@^@)"
"Many people in this platform think that Alibaba stopped its rise because of the CCP; but apparently there were other aspects that are not related to BABA directly. The Archego's capital management fallout due to the lost of billions in margin calls; this caused that this firm had to sell most of its stock positions which in turn, induced to have several discounted stocks because of the sell off; stocks like ViacomCBS, Baidu, Vipshop, etc. Many hedge funds wanted to buy all these discounted stocks in the market; but given the fact that they did not want to increase their participations of China within their portfolios, they just sold positions like BABA to have more liquidity to catch those discounted shares in the stock markets. So, the dropped of BABA is not related to news, rumours of the CCP, regulations, business model, etc. In this drop, you know what you need to do if you are long term holder."
"A play on the short side: go short at open or near 226 and close the short at 220/219. A high risk low reward, 1 day play. But an option to play into the downside pressure."
Many countries are working together to limit China influences. Hence BaBa growth is only limited in China. Furthermore many countries are extremely #$%$ that China bring the virus to the world and the way how it is threatening the neighbors. Unless you are from China do u really want to invest in a country that will harm you in the future.
We are heading to $800!!
Appears 218s are on deck. Get ready.Blessed be the warning.
Baba will never reach that $210.00 level anytime soon !!!!!!!! Next stop $200.00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Better than 50% chance this goes under 200.

"For a typical US investor, at least 10% or up to 30% should be allocated to BABA or other China big caps. In particular, as US inflation concern flares up, the maximum 30% should be used."
Time to go long Baba
Stealing shares from the fearful and those who don't understand you buy equites based on FUTURE OUTLOOK AND EARNINGS and not on present NOISE. Too bad for the fearful sellers today... Boolean
They had some interesting insights about BABA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Looks like baba setting up for another huge downturn. OH YES!!You have been warned.
I could seriously see this stock going to 500 in the next two years.
"I worked out well for me !!! I dumped Baba at $310.00 six months ago , and bought up QQQ shares !!!!!! I'm DRIPPING in CASH today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
MSCI is switching to HK exchange for its Baba shares. Is that going to make the price fall further?
"Wealth investor are avoiding “Risk” due to uncertainty in future tax policy. Everything that is being promoted is avoidable except taxing unrealized gains yearly, which is a new item thrown against the wall. The ultra rich never pay estate taxes, because they setup charitable foundations and pay their kids millions forever. Loss of step-up basis has been floated before but was considered unenforceable. Taxing unrealized gains yearly is really unenforceable but has never been floated before. The increase in capital gains tax is moving money out of risk. Currently 80% of the investment in risk equity is held by the 1% of the wealth. The wealth is moving to value where they will hold until it’s safe again. If wealthy taxpayers live in California or NY they unfortunately will be paying 55% income tax. Anything above 50% makes taxpayers become a lot more aggressive."
So glad I dumped BABA at $ 310.00 a while back !!!!! It will take years before it hits those numbers again !!!!!!!!!!
23 PE ratio lol
tell your grand kids how you used to buy $2500 BABA stock for $230s in the 2020s to 2021
These posts are entertaining.
"L’action a triplée en 5 ans, soyez patients. Price is 3x higher than 5 years ago, look for long term investment. GLTA"
I'm so glad I dumped all my BABA shares at $310.00 !!!!!!!!!!! It may be another 3 to 5 years before Baba shares reach that price again !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This fine should hopefully end the Chinese government s investigations. Baba has about 460 billion cash or $171 per share. This stock should rocket soon.
"I follow about 70 stocks. BABA is the only one rated undervalued. Most of the others are rated overvalued, yet they go up while BABA goes down."
"Shorts earned more than 200 billion on BABA, it was an organized attack on this company. Today, a bribed Bron writes that it is not time to buy. Baby today should cost $ 500 or more. You have to compare BABA and Amazon"
The loss due to the Antitrust fine precisely because the company has been doing too good.
"More selling, so I can buy a lot more before earnings please."
"SELL today , before it goes down further !!!!!!!! Don't delay !!!!!!!!!!!! The rest of the Stock market ( USA ) is going through the roof , and your just holding that "" CHINESE BAG "" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Surrealistic to see BABA doing what it should do.
"Per an April 26 article in SCMP: ""China is gearing up for a month-long campaign to “accelerate the recovery of consumption and unleash the spending potential of its people, as the country has effectively brought the pandemic under control but is still struggling to boost consumer spending so that it is the driving force behind the nation’s economic recovery."" (you can google it, Yahoo wont let me post the link)this is added good news for Baba!"
I don't get what stops Baba from rising. Ant IPO should be nothing more than a bonus. Anti-monopoly investigation finished. What's the problem..
"I held this boy 4053 SharesBefore covid-19 , Ant ipo declined, Jack ma disappears, BABA Fine , i feel normally, i know it will go 500-600 usd in 3-4 years , why people just panic sell and switch stock? This stock is just a bargain. Just hold it. You will double or triple money soon :) ( Chalie munger also think like this so he jump in )"
"I was just watching an interview with a fund mgr named Francis Lun on CNBC. Given HK was red again (30 minutes ago) and the tech index in particular, he attributed it to regulatory overhang on all Chinese tech stocks that will get sorted out. Just his opinion."
Look at first 30 mins after market open. If still red then imo we close red and the Stock is broken hypothesis is true
"BABA’s stats may look good, but many people in this board are forgetting one thing. It is in China, which implies at least two major risks. (1) Political risk. If Xi Jinping thinks BABA is a serious risk to his control of the country, BABA will go bankrupt in a couple of weeks. In fact, it is known that BABA has close ties with Jiang Zemin who is Xi’s political enemy. (2) Shrinking Chinese population. Chinese government has been delaying the release of once-a-decade census results more than a month, which could indicate they are cooking the numbers. If their population has been shrinking as fast as many people are suspecting, BABA won’t have the opportunity to grow.Buffet once said not to follow big names in stock investing w/o DD, and I know of numerous cases in which you would loose money if you followed either Buffet or Monger."
"US companies go up +50%/+100% on a 20% increase in revenue, Alibaba goes up +0,32% on a 64% increase in revenue."
"In FY020, China was the only major economy to produce economic growth. It’s not surprising, then, that it was also the only major national market to see an increase in total media ad spending. Girded by this economic strength, China’s digital ad market hardly missed a beat, growing by 16.2% y/y in FY20. In China's AR advertising market, the market share of WIMI ranks first. $Baba"
-20% past 6 months. Only momentum is downwards. Until there is some proper news this is pretty much fake. Keep away.
"Ghost trade at 258 today during AH, interesting !"
Buy the dip. This is such an easy buy
"Bears are ridiculous. They literally have no case on why this company should be lower. Delisting fears are gone. Chinese government investigation is over, with the penalty being a slap on the wrist. The company itself has incredible growth and revenue and tons of cash on hand. Maybe if this stock was at $500 a share, I could say it's overvalued. But at $216, it's such a good price."
If for nothing more than the common good this pseudo stock really should be delisted.Blessed be the warning.
"I’m long Baba , but I can’t lie I got a little chuckle out of today’s price action. They really faked us out ."
"From TD and Benzinga this morning at 10.39 am eastern: Bearish bet, 580 Put Contracts bought (Expiration 05/21/2021, Strike $210).......Sure hope this guy has more money than brains (Or is hedging). Any thoughts?"
"Just finished going through the report, happy with the last year & look ahead. I think market is reacting to lack of guidance or solid comments on probe status. In any case, adding more today, don't see this report meriting decrease in price."
"Down four days in a row, $8.82....this is not good. I really have to take a good luck at whether to hold or pull the trigger. When earnings are good the stock continues to flounder, it does not make any difference what the P/E is etc., this goes no where and way too much gov't interference."
"So looking at the price action around earnings - the last 6 earnings caused the stock to drop. 4 of which quickly recovered and went higher within weeks. The other 2 earnings happened on peaks near ATH and lead to longer declinesOf the 18 total baba earnings, 8 were green and 10 were red. HOWEVER, baba has never reported earnings in a dip like this, not even close. Its always near peaks well off recent lowsSo the stock will rally into earnings or baba will report earnings in the biggest dip/lowest valuation to date.Last 6 earnings were red, people will expect that, so it might do oppositeI hope it runs to upper 230s before earnings, and that earnings can push us past 245 on volume. If not, we can fall back here. But if we stay at these levels, let's pray for a green earnings"
What forward p/e would be low enough to entice you to double your position?
lol. 1year target at 2000 now ? wth's going on ahaha
"Today will close red or v small green closeNothing you lot were hoping for on here, aka 240 close"
How is this company this cheap? I guess people are pricing in the risk of the Chinese CP? Still eventually valuations will catch. Just bought 15 shares
"It looks like some of you people have gotten your Hopes up today !!!!!!!!! Well , I'm sorry to say "" DESPAIR is on it's Way "" !!!!!!!!!!!!! Can't anyone of you on here see what is going on ??????? How these BABA shares are being Choregraphed !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Soon you will see !!!!!!!!!!!!"
I realize we didnt get blow out numbers but we came into print already down 30% while other tech were at highs when reporting
"14,745B in free cash flow 1 quarter.A 2,8 billion fine. That is 19% of 1 quarter free cash flow. And Alibaba dropped from 870B to 608B; 262B.How can a company lose 262B on a 2,8B fine?"
Headlines focusing on how Alibaba miss analyst EPS estimates is misleading. It was well known that this quarter balance sheet would be weak due to regulators fine. Wall Street just didn't update their estimates. That's it.
$ 210.00 a share any day now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Dow are up 200 points. The shorts are yet attacking the stock. Eventually they will have to fill their orders. Relax... it will go green today.
Up on measly volume is not a good sign.You are warned.
"HK up 8%, US will follow. Political risk has been removed, as I said up 20% in 2 weeks."
added more at close.
Bought the dip big time
"Every time BABA goes down, it seems a bargain for someone or ""good price"" and it has been 2 weeks. Hope nobody bought more shares every time BABA went down since they thought it was good price. Believe me it is a painful lesson for me 20 years ago, but I still make mistake but more cautious when I thought it is ""good prices"". Anything has to have a reason, I should get out when it was $230 to take a loss."
"Buy today and you will be getting in lower than Mungar/ Buffet. Buy and hold long term and you will be heavily rewarded. BABA is incredibly large, diversified and is evidently a top 5 company worldwide in therms of customers and revenue. Ignore the noise that doesn't effect BABA's business. Happy Friday"
Messages being deleted !! I REPEAT 137 on MONEY LAUNDERING !!
"Only 8 trading days before earnings, let’s hope they are good and can give the stock some direction upward."
"The fine makes Baba ""fine"" again. thank God"
"It feels like blood is in the streets, time to buy Alibaba (and other Chinese stocks). Fundamentally strong and Alibaba surely will get support from China now they are in line with the CCP. Takes time, maybe stock goed lower, but imho it is really an opportunity to take position for longer term. No worries, highly profitable and growing. Good luck all."
Overal conference call: we accept fine - we will have more fierce competition - we will offer more services to our merchants for free and continue to develop new technology - regulatory fine is 18.2b will be reflected in Q1 2021 - Alibaba will compete more for lower tier cities (good news - bad for PDD) - honestly.. not too much extra information from their previous letter on the ir website.
"Man this is a $1,500 stock!"
Down again in Hong Kong? Going for Dinner !!
So the stocks taking a bit of a dip. One shot fired in the South China Sea and it's sunk.
"A short introduction. I started trading after the 1st tech bubble pop and soon learned trading was a stacked game against retail, especially due to short term taxes. After blowing up 2 small accounts, I went in with an investors mindset and my 6 figure tech salary and went all in AMZN, NFLX, and GOOGL in Oct 2008. I held. I then added NFLX LEAPS in fall 2012 and huge positions in NVDA and AMD (sh and calls in 2016). The result lead to me being a multimillionaire at a relatively young age. Now, the only stocks I own are AAPL and BABA (just started buying BABA this week). I am 84% in cash and will look to further invest in BABA and Tencent. As a retail investor you must play the buy and hold game to win and shut out the noise. Both during my AMZN and NFLX holding periods, the shorts claimed bankruptcy was just around the corner. I still.get a kick remembering what those sad little smaller pecker shorts used to say back then."
Looks like another Dismal down day for Baba shares !!!!!!! Pre market sinking again towards $ 200.00 a share !!!!!
Please keep the price high until I unload my 1000 million stock !Thank you .
Time to buy.
lets go green...open bell!!! GREEN
Jimmy Z warned us
This is a 5 plus year accumulate and hold. Nothing to fear. Will be $500 plus by then. Relax. Normal market moves.
"BABA stock dropped 32% since all time high, but revenue increased more than 30%. Forward P/E is only about 16x earnings. How much cheaper can we go?"
Benjo is feeling good today cruising in his little Yugo .
Already rebounding! shorts find someplace else to bash. Run for cover! All bad news is out now they can get the stock price back towards 300+. Prepare for for lift off
Market is such bs!! Fn scam!! This is the Amazon of China trading at a 1/3 of the price!!
For any of you seeking free stock advise just pull my finger. LOL!!!You were warned.
We are back to where we are a week ago. One more rally and I have to bail out. There are other better stocks out there. Shorters kept sinking the price inpite of undervalue and never run out of negative news bloggers in yahoo page while the executives of Alibaba have been timid letting it sink deeper. CCP wants many ecommerce chinese company not just one dominated by Alibaba. Fundamentals does not work on this stocks. It is manipulated by the proxy private traders & shroters of the CCP.
"It's too bad this ""TINY RALLY"" for Baba share holders well be short lived !!!!!!! Soon to be $210.00 a share !!!"
morningstar and Argus research BOTH have 50% upsides for this company. For a large cap....thats INSANE! Al Gore's firm also nearly doubled their position @245. I don't think it gets more obvious than this one. Easy $$.
Good price to buy considering how the sellers can't drive BABA further down on a bad day for tech. Who would short BABA when they can short TSLA or PDD?
 Top Bullish Charts | May 2021  https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts
"Hi guys, this is the expected reversal and will be huge.We will see a fast run to 350 usd minimum or more.Baba is fundamentally MASSIVLY undervalued and the uncertainty is cleaned.All big hedge funds and even Charlie munger are invested in this pearl.I will buy a huge amount today."
"Close was positive (options activity?), technically forming a bottom if you ask me."
"Alibaba is undervalued, it's the only company where the P/E is lower than their growth rate, the only company that justifies this Peter Lynch's indicator. But if you check their cash reserves and their historical return on equity, you'll find out that it's not just undervalued. It's the best bargain of the last few years in the market."
This will be more expensive tomorrow. Get in now and dont be left behind. Buy with confidence!
"Max pain is 232,5 for tomorrow. Interesting how this is to be sorted out. I do not like idea of 6usd decline..."
2 big regret of my life1. marriage2. owning baba stocks
"All this news about Ma, delisting, media assets and so on does not affect Alibaba but still it keeps affecting the stock....."
"at this point after 6 months of non stop regulations news, lots of bad news already priced into stock"
I think the fine is roughly 3.4% of the total revenue of 2020. It is not that bad.
"It’s amazing that China who’s the king of Monopoli fines one of their companies for monopolistic practices. Whatever, I hope this is the end. Monday this stock will take off."
"At the moment, it pretty much looks like HK just tracking NY. Let's see if it holds up for the rest their day."
"According to my charts , Baba will be down AGAIN AT THE Market open!!!! It seems to be going backwards towards $210.00 a share !!!!!!!!!"
"what a bad day, falls so much stronger than the market and hardly any news which would explain it"
will baba be delisted?
Holy Snikeys...$213.75!! Ouch! Heed the warnings from the Great and Wonderful Jimmy Z!
"Buy as much as you can in premarket sale, market is always forward looking and guidance is good"
Bagholder looking for growth.
"Trading at the equivalent of $234 UDS now in HK, FYI. Bye shorties"
I think that the major international cloud client that they lost is Cloudflare. They have announced in the recent report that they had to switch cloud provider to JD in China. Though no idea for what reasons.
A double sell for baba and bidu on Friday option expire day. Nothing suspicious to me. Although many analysts did cut their projections from $450 to $350 per share
"I totally agree with Lin , that Alibaba shares should double in price in Ten years !!! As long as they are still in business !!!! In those ten years Growth Index Funds will be forced to buy in anyway !!! Yet, in the short run ( TWO or Three years ) the price will go down from $ 209.00 today more towards $ 150.00 to $ 125.00 a share !"
"With earnings coming out next week, it'll be interesting to see if the stock starts climbing in anticipation. IMO, that's usually the case, but we'll see."
"I tried to say this not even 24 hours ago! An incredible earnings report was ALREADY priced in! So very little upward potential from the earnings call, but much more downward potential if anything came back short of perfect. Caught a lot of heat for saying that. Now we’re looking at an EPS miss.To quote an infamous member of this page: honestly, you were warned!"
2.8B to ease uncertainty. Not a bad deal!
Jimmy Z was warned. blessed be the warning. 
"Chipotle dipped twice off of ecoli news and drops in revenue after those outbreaks and now the stocks trading at all time highs, alibabas drop is off in price is off rumors and speculation while revenue is growing yoy"
selling = to more buying after good earnings report. 100 million + volume on earnings day.
Hello Baba holders! Soon this drama will go away and Baba will move up!Buy buy buy!
"c'mon Joseph, I took your advice and sold Baba, you promised you was gonna tell me a better stock to go long, baba has atleast 50 percent upside at it stands, so I'm assuming you know something solid with maybe 70 percent upside + "
why isn't BABA giving a steady dividend? Would get more people to invest in this powerhorse of a company.. This company should be at 350 by the end of the year
$218.95 AH...YAAAAAYYYY!!!Blessed be the warning.
"This chatroom is very quiet, did most retail investors sold their Alibaba shares after four small downdays?"
Look at that volume . Extremely low. We need some type of positive catalyst. Hopefully ER surprises to the upside .
"Main problem here is that most of the baba bulls are calls holders. Just look at the puts/calls ratio. Same with most other Chinese and tech stocks. Ones holding the most ""real"" shares are options market makers. They can control and set the price anywhere they want to."
BABA should throw a few billion of their free cash flow into Bitcoin. Think about it... the attention and the gains...
"growing faster than Amazon, trading at less than a 20 forward P/E in one of the highest valued markets in recent history.. hmmm?"
"Don't forget BABA's major shareholder Softbank has been liquidating investments to raise money and buy back its stock. Incidentally, Softbank shares were down 7% yesterday. For the next little while, BABA stock could be at the mercy of Softbank's decisions."
I have been telling all you people to sell Baba shares way back at $310.00 a share !!!!!!! All you did was Mock and make fun of me !!!!!!!!
Since the end of 2017 Alibaba has been around the same price; while the company was still growing.After big funds accumulated enough shares you'll see several days of high volume and price action will go near verticle.
Over the years my portfolio has seen many stocks come and go. But BABA has been a long term hold for me shortly after IPO and will continue to hold this well run powerhouse for the foreseeable future. I believe every long term investor would be wise to have a long position of BABA in their long term portfolio.
My best guess of what happened today: institutional shorts covered and took a long position.How else can the volume be so high?
Green coming ...
Today is just the beginning of a new bull run. Can see it reach 280 bij end of the month.
You guys are hilarious thinking this thing is gonna get delisted its just a bunch of noise this is an easy double
8 AM conference call in China Monday morning which is 8 PM to us here NYSE Eastern standard time so we will see HK open first reaction an hour and a half later here Sunday night 9:30 PM HK is hot on this stock hopefully get a big jump open; they get their first reaction then to see how NYSE Reacts. Imagine if during conference call if they mention about  IPO￼ tomorrow night
"This stock is only 21% up from the lowest pandemic point ($170) when the economic outlook was terrible and everyone thought the great depression is possible. Knowing Charlie Munger's mindset and that he bought this stock gives a lot of credit to Alibaba in the long run. Charlie Munger's approach is to buy a great business with good economics and (ideally) never sell.In the short term (1-2 years) price can be anywhere, don't fool yourself thinking you can guess where the price will be tomorrow, next week month or quarter. Don't get surprised if it goes very very low (or very very high). But if you hold actual stocks (not options), are not leveraged and you are willing to keep this stock for a long long time (10 years), you have very good chances to get a decent return."
"BABA has been the first antitrust because China know this is the biggest player with large moat! Now, they will regulate all the others! 5 Times US population, biggest player in cloud, it will grow faster then Amazon for sure!!!"
Ok calling 208 as bottom
Munger ........... remember.............
I guess now it’s time to add...
"1.58 eps missed 1.78 expectations, even after excluding the communist party fine"
220 by friday
"My friends, do not worry, year to date I am now only up a few percents. I considered close some positions before earnings, because near 100% on earnings date Alibaba drops.Charts tell me we can visit 203 (basically did today at 204) and 190 (could happen this month) and even 163 if there will be an economic collapse.My chart tells me there is a HIGH probability we will trade at 230 again within the next 4 months.Flat earnings for current year from earnings call makes my projected end of year target 270 (IT WAS 300+ prior to earnings call).Longterm fundamentals will start to matter again unless you believe US and China will go to war, I think the probability of that is slim.Stay strong my friends. See you in better day. "
be a miracle if this stock is green tomorrow . if it is ..sell . Because the name of the baba game is SELL
Get your Pre market sell orders in early !!!!!! Avoid the rush !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Hold, don’t sell ,crooks tray to still your shares ."
Bought at 223. Sell or keep?
"Considering business model, profibility and growth rate, BABA's value should be 3 times more than AMZN. AMZN only counts on AWS, eCommerce doesn't make money. BABA is making real money, and selling many times more on its platform than AMZN. Also BABA's cloud service is huge too, but priced about 10% compared with AWS. BABA will be a big winner in the future"
"People who have been avoiding me on here , are suddenly out today Squawking how smart they are for holding on to this turd !!!!!! Well , over three years of holding on to Baba , you made in DOLLARS and Cents $ 0.00 !!!!!!!!!!!!! I , on the other hand was Smart to dump Baba at $310.00 a while ago !!!!!!! It will be many many years before it hits that number again !!!!!!!! Sell TODAY !!!!!!!!!!!!"
The gross margin line will be just as important as the top and bottom lines.
"Benjo told me according to it is sources we will positive Ant IPO news tomorrow , let’s go !"
I picked up more today. Baba is 52% of my portfolio atm
Thanks for everyone who is panicking!
"Antimonopoly pressure Is over, Baba will fly next week"
Baidu is up. Baba is down?
Only a matter of time until the market corrects on this. Fundamentally this is a very strong company average price is at 219 and not sweating in the least
11PM Tonight NYSE time￼ in Hong Kong will be March trade data for China-BABA Will take it as a positive. Also tonight possibly more news about ant  restructuring before it’s IPO. Traders in Hong Kong will celebrate great closing on NYSE; we should see some more great volume￼￼ tonight HK
Mediocre stock likely to drop even if it reports great results.
Alibaba will perform despite the hatred from both US and China governments
This stock has not done anything for a whole month.
"Although most are expecting decent earnings for Baba including myself, the stock last four quarters went down after earnings release despite a nice over delivery on expectations. Don’t get me wrong I’m a true bull on Baba for the long term and think the stockprice is heavily undervalued at this moment, but hope they can trigger the stock to go up by earnings although I have some doubts. One thing is for sure, there is almost no fantasy in the stockprice and it hasn’t moved up prior to earnings (that’s ok, probably a smaller chance for disappointment).Possible triggers are: - clearance about ANT IPO (I don’t expect that)- anything positive about cooperation CCP/Baba/Jack Ma (although I don’t expect earnings report can take away the hesitation most investors have to invest in Baba, time is the only thing that can heal this trust)- Reports of massive stock buyback last quarter and an increase of the buyback program (I really hope this, stockprice is crazy low so this is a great opportunity to revert on dilution)- Starting with payments of dividend (I don’t expect this, but won’t be a bad move to start with 1% dividend)- Massive over delivery of earnings (market is expecting 1.79 per ADS share for the last quarter but above 2.5USD non-GAAP would be insane and would definitely turn the stock green)Anyone with other thoughts?"
My avg is 227. I did not sold it when it was 270. But i am pretty sure it is a genuine company with great numbers. Hope for the best.
Bloomberg Reuters know news is coming out of  in near future most likely before earnings. A lot of speculation that will also be assumed before concrete {as per fine} will be conjured Before we go in overnight answer probably over a weekend at some point￼. This is being worked on though and will help BABA as a independent company itself to clear its way and its own stock price. On the technicals from now until May 9th 232-242 range and if the news is timed as did the 222 bottom we will probably get  news around the ninth and then let earnings play all fundamentals moving forward
"These are hard times but Baba isn't going anywhere, checking the market every day is bad for your health, it will go up eventually"
BABA better make a 48% run from here or there will be no new roof.
"I put a market order and I got 15 shares for 243.02 USD. It is my first investment, pretty exciting."
Bought some more today.. can not believe i am still able to get shares for these prices. My average is 214 lower than Mungar!
2 Positive articles Saturday finally /ones is from IBD another from a Chinese editor // better than for Barron’s to talk $@!}!**T
I say one word to the foolish shorts: green! Baba last thing you will short LOL
"Looks like the management of Baba are completely out of this world. No communication, no news, nothing."
"What will happen with the GAP between 232 USD and 236.50 USD?I have been all day looking at history of Alibaba, I can't find this type of GAP up on this type of volume to have any comparison. Frankly I'm surprised by the volume. Althought: Alibaba was on CNBC today 2 or 3 times."
"everyone is reacting based on day to day fluctuations, why don't you buy more, unless the underlying business has changed what are you so worried about? it's just a further buying opportunity in my eyes, keep accumulating and it will pay off in the long run!"
$210.00 a share for Baba coming sooner !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
what time we get the earnings?
"China KA growing MASSIVLY and baba at level years ago.A fraud , manipulated down and the biggest bargain.Earnings will be crashed again, the valuation is ridicolous low.I am adding more and more shares...here are waiting 50% profit once it starts to go up."
"Don't expect any price action following a good earnings. Alibaba stock never responds positively with good earnings. Although, with 1 more higher earnings behind us the forward p/e ratio will continue to decrease, potentially pushing it below 20 (we're at ~20 to 21 right now). A forward p/e of <20 for a growth stock is incredible (even in an undervalued market, it's still a good buy). Valuations are only going to go so low. At some point stock price will rise lock-stop with earnings. Maybe 20 fp/e is still too high for the market. Maybe at 16 fp/e it#$%$ bottom. In either case with the stock growing earnings 20-30% per year for the next handful of years. EXAMPLE: Say the market values Alibaba with a P/E of only 16, in 3 years with a 25% yoy earnings growth the stock will be 50% higher than today and still primed for multiple expansion of an additional 75%-150%. THIS STOCK CANNOT LOOSE YOU MONEY if your holding period is 3+ years."
If only Alibaba executives can come up with news twice a week then money will flow back into BABA.
"I have owned baba for 5 years, I am up 187%, not to bad. So lesson learned, at least for me patients, is important part of investing."
"All the news articles and investing articles pushing the stock and it goes down. Those articles are part of the manipulation....liars and swindlers trying to con, ambush and discourage retail traders. They dont like their HFT programms being ran over by retail traders so they break them."
250$ before earnings
I saw a couple of after hours trades last night between $185 and $200. I was worried what the open might look like.They must have been anomalous trades.Did anyone else see that?
"Big time down in HSI. iMO, 210 is tomorrow. Next week journey to 170 started. Look at BABA buyer's dilemma !!"
In last 40 months baba has achieved a monthly return of 0.4%!Wow
"Nov 2: ANT IPO is scrapped, BABA SP was $285 ( already factored in without ANT IPO )Dec 24: Monopoly investigation was started, the SP was $222 Now the Monopoly investigation is completed, and ANT IPO is still not in the plan, but the SP is at $239 instead of $285 - even after Alibaba Cloud became profitable in the last quarter. The real price of this stock is more than $300 even without the ANT IPO. May 15: Berkshire 13F will be released ( after Munger's investment in Daily journal there is a good possibility of Warren Buffet investing few billions in this stock). Last quarter when Buffet filed a confidential filing for an undisclosed stock, I thought it could be BABA ( it ended up being Verizon and Bank of America ), but this time around with Munger's investment, there is a good chance BRK will invest in BABA.May 17-21: BABA Earnings week. Cloud will stay profitable, and no material impact from the monopoly or ANT suspension - the SP will cross 300 by EOD May 21. Historically, BABA stock always falls after earnings result, but this time it's going to buck the trend.Hang in there !"
"If Benjo/Jimmy Z (Benjo alt account) told you to sell and Munger is buying a lot of Shares, who do you listen to? The basement dweller or the goliath in investing with 50+ years in experience? It's obvious!"
"A lot of uncertainty is now gone with this fine. Statement before the US bell on Monday. Will be positive and will most likely give an update on the ANT IPO. The bottom was in Friday, I expect a huge gap up on Monday, and follow through through earnings and summer. New all time highs in 2021."
"You need more buyers to move the price of this ""stock"" higher.Apparently, around 220, people don't get excited. $110 will bring in new buyers."
"Dear Alibaba merchants, consumers, partners and shareholders,Today Alibaba Group received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) of the People's Republic of China. We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination.

In this connection, we conducted a self-assessment of, and implemented improvements to, our internal systems while ensuring stable operation of our business. The penalty issued today served to alert and catalyze companies like ours. It reflects the regulators' thoughtful and normative expectations toward our industry's development. It is an important action to safeguard fair market competition and quality development of Internet platform economies.Internet platform economies are new economic structures created out of the latest cycle of technological revolution. Because of China's economic and technology development, as well as regulatory support for innovation, Alibaba has been given the opportunity to explore and create platform business models such as Taobao and Tmall with the help of millions of small- and medium-sized merchants and hundreds of millions of consumers. The platform model lowered the costs of starting and doing business, improved efficiency and enhanced circulation of economic activities. Today, Internet platform economies have entered an entirely new phase. They are an integral part of people's everyday life and affect all dimensions of the broader economy. It is not lost on us that today's society has new expectations for platform companies, as we must assume more responsibilities as part of the nation's economic and social development. At the same time, we are cognizant that the value of platforms comes from helping participants to succeed through integrating and sharing resources, as well as continuously creating value for society.We are acutely aware that our livelihood depends on keeping up with the times and our nation's development; continuously listening, understanding and servicing our countless merchants and consumers; and being steadfast in pursuing technological innovation. We will further strengthen our focus on customer value creation and customer experience, as well as continuing to introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs of operating on our platforms. We are committed to ensuring an operating environment for our merchants and partners that is more open, more equitable, more efficient and more inclusive in sharing the fruits of growth.Today is an important day in Alibaba's journey of growth. It is a new starting point for us, one where we tackle problems head on and commit to innovate. Alibaba would not have achieved our growth without sound government regulation and service, and the critical oversight, tolerance and support from all of our constituencies have been crucial to our development. For this, we are full of gratitude and respect. We started Alibaba because we believe in treating customers first and creating sustainable long-term value for society. These are our reasons for being, to which we are fully committed, and from which we will never waver.Alibaba Group2021.4.10"
"Now it is time for US to press ""anti monopoly"" pressure on Amazon and make Amazon lose 39% of its market cap in 5 months. Let's go! :D"
Another fun fact: checking `China Large-Cap ETF` - YTD is -2%It's like China +18% GDP growth is not good enough.
"BABA, $250+ in no time."
Something will happen to upside soon; News bashing to get the last of the weak hands out a couple more weeks out from here which is a couple weeks before earnings we will get Uptrend news
"I'm super excited about Q1 earnings, ANT IPO, digital yuan and wether Berkshire has opend a position. All good news from here on. Patience always pays off and shorts will crumble like the crunchy muesli in my mouth. I'm just so happy "
Can Ann Wilson of Heart get an fatter? Well of course she can just like Alibaba can go lower. You asked for it.Consider this a warning.
Cathie Woods sold a lot of BABA today
We are headed to $600
"Just like I thought, it is up. Hoping for $242 by Friday."
Considering NASDAQ's current 1.93% loss......BABA is holding its own heading into earnings.
Volume is increasing tomorrow’s going to be a really good day! Mark my words!
"BABA is going to reach 1 billion active users soon, cloud, alipay...surprised it’s not at the trillion market cap yet"
Looks like time to add some more BABA. Thank you markets for a hefty discount on top of already undervalued stock!
"So why might Munger be interested in Alibaba? We don't know the exact answer to this question as of yet. However, we can speculate on the reasons why this billionaire investor might want to own the company when he owns so few stocks. Best part of article! Is someone like Charlie is buying this somethings got to happen and soon"
Extremely safe investment for the week: lowest it could end on Friday is slightly below 240 USD. Upside is towards 250 USD.
since nobody knows anything and nothing or nobody makes sense ... I will continue to declare that......twinks are the cause of it all . Its just as logical as anything else here.
"8/24/2017: 177 USD was the intraday high (at open)today: 5/5/2021: 229,29 USD was the intraday highIn 1350 days the price went up a whopping 52,29 USD or 29,5%Or 7,24% gain on an annulised basis between 24 August 2017 and 5 May 2021."
Bloomberg is constantly bashing last 3 days doing great job for shorts another 7% in 3 days- check out all negative news it’s from Bloomberg
Jack Ma is back !https://asiatimes.com/2021/04/jack-ma-re-emerges-on-the-digital-yuan-vanguard
Be greedy and buy when ...? Good advice ! Buy for $225 next day sale for $219 ....and next day for $ 209.00 ?
sell sell sell this is the last time that it will be above 200
Plenty of room for more growth! There was (is) severe undervaluation due to uncertainty. Uncertainty is gone. Now BABA can get get properly valued!
"thanks Cfra, for lowering the stock price, so I can add more Baba to my position"
This is a sleeping giant and when it finally wakes up the patient investors will be handsomely rewarded.
Be patient. This is the best stock on the planet!
For your information..Things/items coming from shopify and amazon and other ecommerce business are coming from alibaba...i love this stock i dont know about you...
"Samething end of december. Out of bollingers bands, and the day after 30,00$ box up!"
"stop loss in place for sure, sad to say that, but just the thing you do when invest, dont know anymore, I wouldnt believe this can tank below 200 a month ago, now not so sure, long this but please protect yourself as well"
"My guest is that this is the last week we can buy BABA under 230$... awesome price. BABA should be at PE of 40, or more than 400$! People who bought at the highest level are still smart to my point of view. Congrats to all long! I love that company!"
13 days till quarterly results. Hang in there people.
What percentage is anticipated on value since Alibaba filed bankruptsy?
BABA earnings call https://youtu.be/bfJvRDJjes8
"If you know the quarter will be less than expected (due to the fine), most companies would scan their financial statements for additional negative components and take as many hits (i.e. accelerate expenses that you can, write down goodwill) as they can (all at once) to clean up their books. This is what happened here. All companies do this for setting up the next quarter and limiting tax liabilities. I have been in management in both public & private companies. This is what I would have recommended."
UP big time now! Shortees are no more in control! 300$ by year end!
MEMO TO SHAREHOLDERS: You buy equities based on FUTURE EARNINGS AND OUTLOOK and for that the BABA is going to ROCK-ET. Boolean
"The biggest red flag = no buybacks even with 1/3 price drop. This won't go up until the shares supply in the market get reduced. Look at the shares outstanding history for a moment. It actually increased from 2.3 to 2.76 billion shares from 2013 to now. They've been stuffing compensation expense into dilution for years. so much for the $10 billion buyback program. That nearly $3 billion in ""special dividend"" CCP got could have been better used in buybacks.."
"Today is an improvement from last Friday / Thursday, we only dropped 0.25% when Nasdaq went up 1.5%. Previously we would drop 1% or more :)"
"One big cloud customer moved away (due to non-product reasons), that is why cloud growth is a little disappointing. Probably a customer trying to reduce China exposure."
"9988 needs to get to $210.20 to normalize to NYSE $217, appr. So far, HK is underperforming as it usually does, and Thursday nights are typically a sell off for them. They have to man up."
"if you hold BABA stock and can afford it; adding slowly to your position with this 5% discount is a smart thing! You buy when there is blood in the streets, not when the stock is pretty! Good luck longs!"
$400 in 40 days!! Longs will win!!
Time for me to go chinese internet retail with BABA down to a 3M RSI 36 @$220.37 with a sell order of $316.84 (+43.8%) to keep the buzzards off my shares. 5/11/21

Bad days are behind us now. Next stop moon!
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Some updated info attached on Baba: Positive. Munger buy was helpful and a good directional indicator, but major catalyst needed on Ant/regulatory clarity, plus end delist noise (even tho it’s a red herring), and Jack coming up for air would be helpful (even tho it’s also a red herring). Longs: just a bit more patience IMHO. G/L!https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/baba/earnings-calendar"
Overhead resistance at $240 and then $270. Then sky is the limit!
Not even holding 60weeks MA
"Tomorrow $220 ,next year $400"
Probably another Chinese family’s margin call who bough too much doge at top
buying opportunity of a lifetime coming right after ER dump. probably around $188. If the whole market corrects 10-20% then $160s....
"China GDP numbers strong as expected, optimistic for tomorrow"
"When SEC clarifies its stance on the delisting rumors, BABA share price will jump +10% immediately. The delisting is fake risk."
Load up people!! This is just the start
"1/3 avg volumeBig day in two weeks.We all know the eps estimation will be beaten, we just need another major news.Good luck everyone."
The fun with BABA is over and it won't end well for those who have a short position
"BABA is now controlled by the Chinese Government. Hence, like CHL, it will be delisted in US 3 years from now as China won't let its book be audited by SEC. You have been warned."
"Analysts targeted price of 297 to 353..... in Yahoo Analysis section, I agree with their picks."
BABA is holding up well if you look at APPL.....do I sound like a bag holder 
We had one of the largest companies in the world have a 10% jump in a single day yesterday. Next day correction is normal. Everyone chill out.
Baba is priced to perfection at $157 PPS and you know it.Consider this a warning.
Solid beat. Waiting market to turn.
I have attached my baba shares for inspirations. I will be adding more on any DIP! Already added 123 shares today!See my attached shares below!https://imgur.com/a/jjWfcyL
"Avg accumulated volume to this time of day (1 PM EST) is about 8.3MM ... now is at 8.6MM ... need more, I'm thinking we see increased volume at the end of the day ... green-day depends on the big V"
I'm jealous at the people who were able to buy some shares in the 210s. And still very cheap in the 220s.
"Recently: when price was near 240 everyone is excited and nobody talks about it going down (I sold 55%).Now price is near 227 and I bought back all the positions and more people here look anxious.I think there is downside risk to 190 USD (in a sell off). That's part of the the game.The best thing to do is to do the opposit of what people here say; there are still a few bullish, so we might retest 222,70 USD (maybe dip just below it). To me that's limited downside risks. I can see US tech going down about 20% to 30%."
Does shutting down a school backed by Ma really have anything to do with Alibaba? Irrational markets continue!
"Next support is 180, 169, and then 137 be bottom, may be ultimate one !! Who knows, it Chinese."
Today’s news will all be about cloud
"Moral of story: when Charlie buys, you buy. Period."
"When giving the fine to Alibaba, Chinese government just wanted to give domestic and foreign businesses a lesson- don’t criticize the government or you get a retaliation. BABA has learned the lesson and it is going to be ok from now on."
earnings can be $10 trillion and baba will still fall if big money want it to fall.
I think it's clear that nobody is willing to short this under $220. Just look at the charts. We bounced off of $220 so many times. Had incredible earnings. Then fell to $205?? Makes no sense. This belongs above that $220 level at the very least.
"big players in but a lot weak hands out, sorry for them, cloud is clear, this will restore its true value very soon"
Many lies are being spoken here today. Bottom line is baba has yet to hit bottom.You are warned.
BABA FMV $262
"Conference call: ALIBABA WILL FOCUS MORE ON LOWER TIER CITIES (take market share from JD/PDD), GROCERIES ON DEMAND, DELIVERY EXPENSION, NEW WAYS TO TRANSPORT, CLOUD, ETC ETC... -- Only negative: THIS YEAR EPS FLAT - ALL WILL BE USED TO MAKE BETTER EXPERIENCE FOR SELLERS !!"
Pro-Robust growth in the core commerce segmentCons-Cloud computer revenue growth continues to slide lower-Media assets (PRC could drop the hammer on Baba )
The funny and the sad thing about baba is that not because baba violates the Chinese regulations. it’s about how Jack Ma criticized the Chinese banks and indirect way the regime. They want to teach him lesson and for anyone in the future.If he didn’t say anything about the banks the price would be around $280-$300 by now. Unfortunately we have no exit right and we just wait.
"We're at the very bottom of, or maybe even broke, the long term trendline. Indicators such as RSI and stochastics are pointing towards oversold area. Ratios such as PE are historically low. Volume was low but increased last week. Looking at TA, does this say anything about what we can expect in coming weeks or months?"
57% buyers vs 43% sellers in HongKong today
Most Chinese could fine by law is 10% of revenue. This was about 3-4%. Fantastic outcome. Big overhang is gone. Old Charlie timed this buy right.
"Fear not, when every one thinks this stock will go down, trust me, it will go up., The earnings will be spectacular packed with analyst upgrades right after that. I'm confident we will do just fine in 3 months. Back to $260 in 3 months. Great time to buy and hold."
"The Great and Wonderful Jimmy Z predicts losses shall continue!!! Any why not, this dog keeps serving up disappointment after disappointment with no end in site.You have no been warned."
I would expect ANT IPO by EOY if they can get things agreed upon
Those in panic..just leave and check back in during power hour!
"You know, talk about lucky (Or was it)? BABA literally could NOT have had a more conservative, stable, and trusted world figure buy in....Maybe if Queen Elizabeth could buy stock?"
Chinese people buy in Hong Kong for $199.00 ans sell in New-York for $217.00 !GREAT BUSINESS and HUGE PROFIT ! Clever people ! Buy non stop they will supply more tomorrow
"Monday I want to buy more shares, hopefully the price will not climb immediately by 10-15%"
I heard about BABA the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Capitulation !!!!!!!!!!! for BABA Shareholders very soon !!!!!!!!! Thursday will be the "" COUP DE GRACE "" !!!!!!!"
"""Texas boy, 10, hit by car while crossing street with Mother's Day gift"" No doubt this attack was planned and carried out by Alibaba operatives. I was concerned this could happen.Consider this a warning."
"I have been warning BABA shareholder's since , I dumped all my shares at $310.00 !!!!!!! What did people say on this site ( KNOW IT ALL""S ) ?????? They MOCKED and made fun of me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since then, Baba has gone down $90.00 a share !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I guess I'm getting the last laugh !!!!!!!!!!! HA HA HA !!!!!!!!!!!"
I bought baba for 245$. it's down now. when its going up? any prediction
Image this very conservative situation: Alibaba stays as undervalued as it is now and keeps growing by 20% for 5 years in a row. Then your return is 150%!!
we going to 300
buy buy! 52 week low is in!
"The estimated revenue growth, according to 30 analysts reporting to Yahoo Finance, has been adjusted upwards to 72,30%. It's so high that beating it would be absolutely incredible. Such a big, established company growing at these rates.. it's insane."
the Bullish Report on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.https://chart-analysis.tools/BABA
Up $14 on HK market
Oh my! Didnt know cathie wood owns chiese big tech... all of her holdings heavily shorted... it explains why chiese index under perform
Clear sailing to $500 by the end of the year
My opinion: you have to be crazy to be bearish on baba long term…I am not sure how many people here have any idea what is happening to Europe but baba is really valuable for countless bussines… 2T stock in next 10 years
"If Baba, goes back to 220s literally the BIGGEST deal on the market, Warning to all bulls/bears, Baba will rally May 10th week, Baba without doubt will be 250s by earnings on May 13th, mark my words, I will be right."
"Down everyday this week for an estimated $5.61, also next week I think the earnings conference call will be as important as the earnings themselves giving us information of looking forward etc., still think we are OK !"
"""imma go to China for easy money!"" - famous last words"
"If you are concerned with the Gov interference in China, look at what Hawley wants...crazy interference ..WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has been a staunch critic of Big Tech, said on Monday he has introduced a bill that would ban all mergers and acquisitions by any company with a market value greater $100 billion, a category that includes the five biggest U.S. tech companies."
I am holding with maximum leverage of x5 . I am determined to hold as until it hits 350
I can only afford 50 shares but China scares me. What should I do??
"Chinas gdp at record growth, revenue and earnings growing at 30%+, highly profitable emerging business as cloud.Few years from now people will say BABA was an obvious bargain and smart move.if you don’t have the guts just buy a few shares as a long term bet."
Monopolistic behaviors generated $20 billion in profits and name recognition that won't go away. Now pay a fine of $3 billion; great deal
"almost green at close, reversal trend is coming"
Does anyone know if earnings will be released premarket or after close of day on the 28th of May? Thank you.
They made sure it closes at session low in last 5 second. Amazing coordination
"I am glad the crooks are shake the weak hands ,let them out."
"BABA revenue beats expected estimate, earning is a little bit less than estimated number, but it is a positive earning or cash flow. Loss means negative cash flow. Too much misleading news out there"
Any prediction of tomorrow’s open? 195?
Hey....trying my luck at 223 . Cash waiting .
It's not too late to put your SELL at market open orders in tonight !!!!!!! You know that Baba is headed to $210.00 a share soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I dont understand, why BABA is falling so hard. All analyzes works for upside, BABA is before earnings and BABA stock is only falling and falling... It is due to present US and Chinese realationship?"
"I'm listening earnings call now.. retail sales 42tril RMB in China; GDP +18,3% growth..I will buy when it dips.. the funds have to push price sub 220 USD (options)"
"Those who bought BABA in June 2018, are still holding, and didn't average down have likely received 0% ROI."
Results just announced. 64 yoy revenue increase
"BlackRock was buying, GS was buying..... Charlie Munger was buying. I just follow...."
"OK; ;no HK market to look forward to tonight, so let's see if NY can move us up in the morning.(Happy Easter)"
"Just to BE clear, Ant confirmed Reuters news about Ma is FAKE."
It was a very good day for BABA. Long and Strong baby.
11 Million shares traded in less than 25 minutes.. 1/3 of the average volume
"Obviously Joseph is a bot, he keeps saying things without proof or reasons. Muting him makes everything cleaner"
Does any1 know the actual process of how MSCI is going to swap its US Baba shares for HK shares Is it gonna sell its billions of dollars worth of us shares and buy the hk ones. Wont that cause an enormous drop in NY Baba SP when it sells all its US BAba shares? Does any1 know the process
Stock market will be sharply higher on Monday. So will be BABA.
What is going on with you & BABA !!
BABA dips on earnings day. Whats new? Load up!
"Even if you bought in november 2014 and you held the shares for 7 years you would have almost doubled from 120 USD to 224 now. If you can hold Alibaba shares for a decade, you will make a good return."
"Looks like the same person also bought 1,000 190puts for 1/21/22. A million dollar bearish betSo I guess he expects a large move but doesn't know which way"
Why people scared of delisting?Even if Chinese stocks get delisted you still own part of the business. Remember that.Through Cayman Island you have the right on the profits.
I heard about BABA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
PRICE IS TRUTH....and as much as I want to buy BABA...............gotta wait until it stabilzes.
"It's 11:40 AM in Bay Area, and market closes in 1:20 minutes and this turd already losing ?"
I predict over 230 by tmrw...
"Adding a bigger pile of BABA today, going back to overweight. Very good buying point"
Jimmy Z!!! You little...
"Shorts have been played by these fake sell off , volumes were low, it was all in the options chain , insiders new it was coming this week!"
It will be super painful for the shorts if this now jumps 7% or smth like that during the weekend.
Just a 3% gain would be nice....
Bought 1 k thanks for giving me auch a gift 
"Congrats to the shorts, but not the phantom shorts like JimmyZzzzz who are short 0 shares.Like many of us said, this is a long-term play. And I was expecting red today, but not this deep red.Anyone have more information on the cloud revenues not meeting expectations? Why did they lose the customer?"
Here comes the final hour and BABA decides to go scuba diving again as usual 
Hi Jimmy and Gregoria!
"My last post to you guys (see you guys in 4 months ):Alibaba will go for lower tier cities, expand more to E-commerce and services abroad, invest in better logistics, invest in new logistic solution (example: autonomous vehicles), create more value for a better price for merchants (note: lower margin), expand cloud business as one of the main driver (30b investment in the comming years), on demand service (in particular groceries, sun art), EV (Xpeng), and a whole lot more is to come.The future will be exiting.Goodluck, my friends. "
"When it comes to China economy vs USA economy today , I wonder if England was saying the same thing in 1776 about the USA economy vs the England economy."
A close over 216.36 VERY positive with today’s action_moving forward. Have a great day ￼
BABA to the moon!
Can somebody recommend me a market leader making a lot of money in the fastest growing markets in a country that will soon be the next economic superpower?
Yahoo keeps deleting my posts.China retail sales are out Sunday night.
222 was a good buy in look at the history- it tries to break out but retreats back to low 220's. buy low 220's and sell 230 rinse and repeat
"Disney missed estimates, while being up 61% on the year, stock is down 2-3%. Compare that to Alibaba ER share price action"
CCP uses Alibaba as its own ATM. Baba will never succeed.Consider yourselves warned.
This is me today:
"People need to understand that stocks do not go up and down in a straight line. Daily drop and up is nothing. When it is in a longer period, that is what matters."
This stock never fails to dissapoint.
"Bad management is the worst thing that can happen to a good company (like Alibaba). Mr Zhang should be fired. He is also burned by the recent regulatory fine. In addition to that, communication towards oversees shareholders is below par. As long as these two aspects don’t change, this stock will always show a large discount."
beautiful price to buy people...long term
"Option chain suggests that by Friday Alibaba will be trading between $225 and $230; to me it looks unlikely, even though chains are often right (80%-90%)."
and the shorts said this would never hit 210 again 
Baba buying $20billion in bitcoin?
Bought it at 265 and lost a lot of money now am back at 213 and it’s still falling
Forward P/E less than 20. This is a growth stock trading at a value stocks valuation. Penalty is now behind us. We can grow and rebuild form here. Anyone that has more than a 6-12 month horizon should be buying this stock hand over fist.
"it's not perfect earning, anything not perfect gives shorts a reason to short....but it's definitely an amazing report....still hard to look my account now, too bloody,"
"Crazy volume after hours of more then 3,5 million shares already."
"Fundamental aspect......pure a great company, the biggest bargainAlibaba Stock Fundamental AnalysisWith a five-year annualized earnings growth rate of 29% and a sales growth rate of 47%, it's hard to find a company with a more impressive track record of growth than Alibaba. It's been a big winner since its IPO in September 2014.Expectations were high for Alibaba's Singles Day annual shopping event in November. The company didn't disappoint as sales nearly doubled from the year-ago period to $74 billion.The company has been able to stay in growth mode despite a slowdown in its core e-commerce business.Alibaba's business in China looks a lot like Amazon's in the U.S. Alibaba's cloud-computing business is showing solid growth, just like Amazon's booming web services business."
"Remember BABA is a great company. However the fundamental problem with this company is it is being controlled by Chinese Government like CHL, and will be delisted in NY 3 years from now for not able to meeting the SEC auditing requirement. Furthermore, Chinese company growth is only limited within China. You have been warned."
Thanks for all the extra shares!
$WIMI $BABA $JD where them bears at?where???
"Forward PE is adjusted to 15,65, by the way. Way overvalued. ;)"
At $140 per share alibaba may be a buy. LOL!!!You have been warned.
"Watch out for Amazon earnings, Alibaba could see a gain if their US counterpart has a great report. FB, AAPL, and GOOGL have me optimistic"
it seems that nobody wants to buy this...
"Once the market gets wind of Warren loading the truck of this at the advice of his buddy Charlie, price will easily surpass $300. If I remember correctly, Berkshire has plenty of spare cash ($40 billion plus?) to buy...."
Remember that time the fine amount was made public and the stock price jumped 8%? Lol.
No doubt 350 for sure End of years.Today i will add more 950 sharesTo have 5053 shares! Great pivet point.
I hope after earning this will be back on track
US market still has 3% to 5% upside fundamentally till the end of 2021.I think currently we might be a bit north of where stocks should be trading (except Alibaba which is being controlled with media and systems to maximize profits on options). IF weakness 226/227 or 212++-223 it's a good buy.
keeps heading towards a 52 week low. Lets be honest here - the days of zero interest rates in the US are numbered. It's going to affect the stock market when rates start climbing - BABA missed the window of opportunity to cash in on what should of been a 52 week high and then some.
+10% in Kong Kong
US mutual funds are encouraged by the US government not to buy Chinese stocks.
"Just watched 9000 shares (0.06% of the daily average volume) bring this down nearly 0.2%Big hedge funds can definitely play games with any stock, even mega caps like this one"
"Baba just reacting today , since, markets in General are up everywhere else !!!!! False Bottoms , are easy marks for BABA shareholders !!!!!!! Sell, while it's at it's high today !!!!!!!"
Exhausting stock
The sad truth is that baba sells off far more easily than it risesDumped today and no interest to buy even at 210.........
"I am all in:NYSE BABA 221,72 USD averageHK 9988 223,52 HKD average"
Why can BABA be at $300 with all of this gigantic income
"Did anyone notice they gave almost 100,000,000 stock in compensation to executives, untill they get rid of that on free market we are not going anyhere. Also its almost 4 times more than any year before just for compensation"
Forward P/E of 16x that’s a bargain.
"Last time this stock went up $21 was on 7/8; ( after a $16 gain on 7/6 and $7 gain on 7/2). In 5 days, it gained $45 ( from $215.95 to $261.58). EOW we should easily land back to: $265 -$285 range"
Market is going down and Alibaba is going up. This signals a bullish sentiment on Alibaba.
Sorry for the of topic. Do you guys know any good ETFs worth looking into right now?
MAX option pain jumped from 225 straight to 230: time to accumulate even more!
And still about Jimmy Z they keep saying....
"We are near historical lows of baba’s PE, all it takes is a big catalyst.Be patient."
bABA isnt holding up well. after bein battered so much its falling. Few months back no one could have imagined it would ever fall below 240. just cant say what will happen with this stock.
"The stock should rise by about 0,07% every day just to keep up with the company's growth."
You guys realize that today alone the stock lost $13 billion in market cap. A $2.8 billion fine is nothing. Pay the fine and move on. Facebook a couple years back paid 5 billion LOL. Not to mention Baba is down a couple hundred million in market cap in the last few months
"So tired of this f-d up manipulated market. Not in a loss with this or anything but things are just not moving anywhere. Slow bleed every day for 3 months is just incredibly dull and boring. On some things, volumes are 1/100 out of what they were in Dec-Feb. Bring that dogecoin money back to stocks."
"Was waiting for 223 to close , got it 215. Thanks shorties what a pre market fail ! This is going back to 240!"
there they go again stock closed 210.60 in hong Kong and hymie is already got it down a buck in new york
"Amazing that the stock can fall this easily without news or indexes really falling. Two positive things about it:1. hopefully Alibaba is buying shares back at increased speed at these insanely low levels, it creates indirectly value for us long term holders.2. If 210 holds it could be a higher bottom then the 204 from last week. Although things are red, it would be great if we close above 210."
"Interesting that MSCI released their news right before earnings. If that is not manipulation, I don't know what is. Was not expecting that. Shouldn't affect the price since then BABA would not be tracking the company at all. That would grounds for shareholder lawsuit."
Investing in Chinese Companies is like playing fire which will hurt you in the long run. The world should know by now that China cannot be trusted (take Hong Kong as a perfect example where they screw this country very much).
"Won't be surprised to see 250 today, BABA is trending everywhere even on yahoo. FOMO will do its job"
Wall street loves to test a bottom 3 times .....its how they work ....dont be surprised to see 222 support tested....and it better hold or ...another leg down .
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
The worst is over. I'm genuinely curious to see who would consider selling right now??
BABA is consolidating nicely and around 240 is now the new price floor. I can only see the upside from here.
"Even simple INDEX Funds ( S&P 500 , NASDAQ 100, RUSSELL 1000, DOW 30) that track all those index's are way ahead of this Turd BABA over FIVE YEARS !!!!!!!!!!! Doesn't that tell you something ???????????"
"It's all about money, the rest is conversation ;) -Gekkogreat value. 100bill in usd earnings. Alipay & Ant group only have growth ahead of it, & Alibaba will continue to grow with reliance for consumers ordering goods and not getting stuck in trafficThey call china stocks a flight to safety. Alibaba is better than spy puts during hard times, and only has upside on the growth factors & bottom line profitability.What i've learned from buying facebook & google when there was hate on it for outside factors, is that short term hate doesnt effect long term earnings."
Unbelievable...BABA has basically missed out on nearly the entire run during the past year. Absolutely no returns.
"Holding on to my 100 baba shares purchased at an avg price of $265. Still holding onto them; because when the hogwash disperse, this stock has no limits."
BABA up 6% in HK the day before earnings and slightly down in US....I’d reckon some investors in Asia already know numbers...just an opinion
Hedge funds are trying to scare away weak- heart investors before the earning report next week. You will see they will load up all the BABA shares one or 2 days before the ER
could have been down more if not a strong market day.
I repeat $137 max value with proper audit process. This is.nothing more than money laundering !!
Pabrai funds group sold MU & purchased 168K shares BABA {just reported} what is it with these guys including Munger 168K shares and coincidence that both average is 246￼
I expect this stock to soar now that the regulatory and fine are settled. The amazon of China and china is a bigger market then north america.
AMZN is bouncing ahead of Thursday's report and BABA is along for the ride.
BABA is way undersold at this level 
Anyone knows tomorrow’s earning will be before or after the bell?
"For anyone wondering what this 210 support is, it is what the market valued BABA in June of 2018."
8 day until earnings I think we will see 240 by the end of this month for sure....
Everyone look at the MACD on the weekly chart. Every single time the weekly MACD crosses to green its lead up to a huge run up ($20-$40) in the 2-4 weeks afterwards. Its been red for months but is on the cusp to turn green any day now
"The European Commission on Tuesday announced that it's filing formal preliminary antitrust charges against Amazon over the way the tech giant uses data from third-party sellers. The case could cost Amazon more than $28 billion in fines. Amazon could get 28 billion in fines. BE CAREFULL, YOU WERE WARNED :o)"
Just bought 310 more shares today!
"Biggest downward pressure on BABA sp is not the US threat of delisting, it is Xi and what his long term view of threat of big conglomerates like Alibaba. Until we see what a revived ANT IPO looks like and the PRC announces it is done with the major antitrust regulations on e-commerce and fin-tech companies, expect BABA to tread water. For me - I bought in early and can wait till these issues play out. Not worried about delisting - as the shares US investors own are in a variable interest entity (VIE) headquartered in the Cayman Islands, not in China. As one commentator stated very well: ""The US may get access to the VIE, but legally may have no jurisdiction over Alibaba itself. In other words, U.S. securities laws may be one step removed from Alibaba itself. That separation could make it nearly impossible for U.S. auditors to legally gain access to anything other than the books of the VIE."
"it can only go so low. Buy, hold and relax."
"Media always tries bring prices down with ""new anti monopoly"", old news!"
Baba buying back stock today... Hope so...
Premarket manipulation to scare ppl of their shares. This is so often to be seen guys! Get over it. Baba has such a great business with amazing numbers behind it. We have seen enough of the down trend now its time to turn things around. Long and strong!
"CFRA Put a bullish buy May 7th on BYND, stock dropped almost 10% recouping only recently. If they’re putting a sell on Alibaba we can expect an 8% gain from here￼"
I have 3 $250 june 2022 calls with an average cost of 24.5. Diamond handsss
"Joseph and Jimmy, if you put as much effort into researching stocks as the effort you put into talking nonsense on this board, you'd quickly discover BABA is at an excellent price no long term investor should refuse"
"This is one of the most dominant companies in the world, alongside Google, Amazon, Microsoft. There's absolutely no bear case for this company. Government intervention is in the past, with the massive fine that this company took."
"Amazon has great numbers, stock is up after hours. You would expect Alibaba to fly also a bit on this news, however AH not so much. May be tomorrow? At least it gives hope for next earnings of Alibaba."
"BABA is definitely not a buy yet. No momentum at all, which is very important in regards to making money. I personally would rather own many other boring businesses that make me money than have my money tied up with baba making nothing."
"Buying the dip today, first batch added and looking to add more if we see 225."
I’ve never been so excited for a earnings release in my life. Prove to everyone all the bs that has been happening for 8months had minimal affect on BABA’s actual business. Cloud profitable.
How to check HK pre-market for $BABA?
"A tech cold war with China, and growing tensions between USA v. PRC ... not good for these Chinese tech stock....will implode sooner than later."
"No ones actually buying. It's just hedge funds trading between their own accounts, setting baits once every often for degenerate call buyers to dump on them. Same with other tech stocks, except they have passive funds money flowing in to cushion the fall. This one haven't. Vanguard actually dumped like 58 million shares last quarter.."
Believe it or not this will help the Chinese markets and possibly help BABA￼
Maybe the mis information war will move over to another company. I’m sure the hedge funds have loaded up by now. I know I have !
News quieted down: Positive things to look for 8am HK conference call [8PM Sunday here] *Conforming to all new guidelines in a profit making way still. *new guidance opportunities now with direction stated*proclaiming economic expansion United with global acceptance *stock buyback *  news *welcoming more international investment {Munger}￼
"Alibaba will beat earning estimates in a large margin due to the longest and most important shopping period for Chinese New Year in February, economy growth, and large middle class population that is bigger than US population"
25 minutes to lower Baba stock shares !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Such a great company with strong fundamentals and finally a little bit back up. I was holding strong already and will continue. First step will be settling above 240 USD then 270 USD and then 300 USD. But still that is short term, medium/long term (few years) 500 USD would be verry likely. Good luck and enjoy days like these. Don’t trade to much but just hold."
Berkshire should take Baba private. Munger likes the company.
OK guys I lost half of my hair today time to take a ride take some air lol
The main resistance for Baba to go to 300+ is to leave the 240s.
I’m happy but does anyone know why is +1% in a bear day?
Up in premarket 
They seriously tried taking it under 230 in final minutes probably options related
Why is this happening?
"- Amazon has a twelve month trailing free cash flow off 26.4 Billion USD and a marketcap of 1748 Billion (66.2 times free cash flow). - Alibaba has a free cash flow in first 9 months 2021 off already 26.6 Billion USD (expect at least 30 Billion USD at full fiscal year 2021 on 13 th of may, possibly even higher). Alibaba has a marketcap off 630 Billion USD. Only 21 times free cash flow.Off course Amazon is a great company, but Alibaba has higher growth, more potential from Cloud business and is a factor 3 times as cheap when compared based on free cash flow. I understand there will be a discount since it is a Chinese company with all it’s uncertainties. However this shows that Alibaba in my opinion is way to much undervalued and will run this up in the coming years. 500 USD stockprice would still be low for Alibaba."
Amazon is trading at 70 times free cash flow (21.7 B$) just because it's an American company. Alibaba has higher free cash flow (26.8 B$ despite fine) and is only trading at 22 times. That either makes Amazon expensive or Alibaba undervalued.
Cathie sold 33 million shares
Fair Value = $262
"I just found some info on why MSCI's decision for HK shares might actually be very good news:There has been a lack of media coverage of MSCI’s decision to migrate to Alibaba’s Hong Kong share class over the US share class, which FTSE Russell indexes already have done. Why is this important? Stock Connect. Once Alibaba’s Hong Kong share class is more than 55% of the US share class in terms of volumes, it will be added to Southbound Stock Connect, thereby allowing Mainland investors to buy its shares in Hong Kong."
kathie Woods sold 162840 shares today. I guess has Liquidity Problems. Her investors are running for the hills
"Per Reuters:Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding has frozen pay for senior executives in 2021 and is instead giving junior staff bigger salary increases, sources said, in an effort to preserve its workforce amid a regulatory clampdown.Hundreds of top-tier executives at Alibaba are not entitled to salary hikes this year, unless they performed extraordinarily, four sources familiar with the matter said.The Hangzhou-based company, though, has offered considerable wage increases to junior staff, they said.The pay moves mark a departure from the usual for Alibaba, which has been the focal point of China's months-long crackdown on the mainland's big and powerful technology companies on worries about their market dominance and ability to sway public opinion."
Another good day to buy BABA shares on the Dip !!!!!!! It looks like every day is becoming a Dip day for BABA BAGHOLDERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Not to worry, Baba won't get delisted. It will just languish around where it is, for a long 'longs' time. lol"
Thumbs up if you will make a big profit on monday!
still a good day for BABA i m sure our HK couterpart will continue carrying the torch
this is the top Ecommerce of China. with a grat increase of sales. its a big buy!
On the bright side I don’t have to pay Capital gain taxes in 2021 .
After the HK selloff......I expected a bigger drop. Bought a few more shares at $231. We'll see how this plays out.
Gonna a be a ripper. The setup is there for a big green day.
Welcome to the bagholder club. Hug.
"BABA’s volume has increased quite significantly with uptrend and surpassed 3 month average since Monday. Guess it may be a positive sign, just hope the uptrend will last so BABA doesn’t become zombie stock again"
"For anyone who is frustrated just look at BABAs long term graph, its not the first time BABA sp is far removed from its peak.. those who have been patient have gained considerably.. a new peak will come. wether soon or in 1 year.. it will come"
Everyone giving it buy rating with all good words about company’s fundamentals. Still the stock tanks when NASDAQ is up 1.4%. BS
Very bullish closure of the day!
"I dumped Baba at $310.00 a share !!! I told everyone else on here to dump it at that time !!!!!! Today BABA shares are $ 105.00 a share lower !!!!!!!!!!! SELL now today , more bad news coming soon from China !!!!!"
"Dont hope the 200-220 range will become what the 220-240 range used to be in the past months. The longer we stay in this area, the harder it becomes to push to reasonable levels.."
"As always... just hold shares. The bear case is government intervention and meddling.However, this company has been around for 21 years, and still up and running. The alibaba group has been around for 6 years already. With China Joe at the helm, no doubt trade relations should improve with China."
Why do a lot of the bears and shorters on yahoo finance talk like 12 year kids?.... so weird for an investing forum..
I'm all in. 300 by the weekend
"Soon , as I predicted Baba will hit $210.00 a share !!! That's $100.00 less than I sold all my shares at $310.00 !!!!!!! HA HA HA !!!!!!!!! Who is sorry now ??????????????????????"
omg... some whales are starting to buy baba.. look at all the block buys
"In my view, there's no question...this is under hedge fund attack."
S& P 500 up 100 % the last 5 years while Baba up 1 percent...... So much for buy and hold
"Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988, ""Alibaba"" or ""Alibaba Group"") today announced that it has received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People’s Republic of China.Alibaba accepts the penalty with sincerity and will ensure its compliance with determination. To serve its responsibility to society, Alibaba will operate in accordance with the law with utmost diligence, continue to strengthen its compliance systems and build on growth through innovation.The company will hold a conference call on Monday, April 12, 2021 to discuss the Administrative Penalty Decision at 8:00 a.m. Hong Kong Time (8 p.m. U.S. Eastern Time on Sunday, April 11, 2021)."
"BABA trading volume has been consistent since last week, guess it is a good sign the maker hasn’t seen since last Nov"
Its all about Tencent tonight. Nothing to worry about
"according to WJ this morning, in 2020, BABA's sale easily doubled Amazon....but we are facing this struggling SP...."
Amazing bargain price. Buy with confidence. Anything below $240 is a great buy.. .. Price target for BABA is $300.
"Important to remember that we buy shares but we own companies. So listening to all the shorts and trash talkers lately reminds me that yes, the shares I've bought have been very volatile. However the company I own has been rock solid, in fact it's continuing to grow and expand its addressable market. Stay long, another knock out quarter on the way."
"In my opinion...this pre market activity is deep pocketed shorts trading back and forth. They are trying to squeeze the final drops of blood from a rock, prior to covering. I'm quite certain also, that their best clientele is being placed in positions as well. No big or small retail would sell on this tremendous report. It's sad that when investing your hard earned money, you have to be subjected to big money games like this."
volume today looking good if it keeps up all day
being a Chinese company is a fundamental problem where the company will be controlled by the Chinese government and will be delisted in US 3 years from now. like CHL the stock price will go to $30. you have been warned.
CRASHING TO 180.
RSI is 28....
Believing this will fail is like thinking Amazon will.. baba isn’t going anywhere. Believe me in 5 years you’ll have wished you bought into it when it was only 220
"I promise you when Alibaba report Q1 earnings shorts sellers are going to get their act kick so hard they will bleed, mark this post"
Short time ---180
"I’m now at 113 shares! Thanks to shortees! If it goes under 180$, I will add more again!"
Some random dude sold me his 30 shares for 230.5 at opening lmaoThank you
US investors argument be like:
Last quarter's estimated YOY revenue and EPS growth is respectively 68.70% and 36.60% (source: Yahoo Finance).
"Nice earnings from Amazon, I expect exactly the same from Alibaba! Nice ride to come really soon! Enjoy longs! Shorts are going to cry again!"
Looks like all the stocks are climbing back - BABA - please join this club.NAS is going green - ALL ABOARD >>>>>>//////^^^^^^^
They had some interesting insights about BABA on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"What a strong performance, love to see it as a long"
Just wait ANT IPO come out end of the year... it's goin' to be huge. BABA won't go under $222.
Are we going to pull a Palantir and reverse big at the opening bell? This is screaming BUY right now.
"Baba share holders should listen to a few good old songs on You tube , that might make you feel better about losing your money on a Daily Basis !!!!! I have two good ones for you tonight !!! Both sung and written by JOHNNY WINTERS !!!!! The first one is "" ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK "" !!! The second one is "" I'll DROWN in my Tears "" !!!!!!!!!!! Go listen to him tonight , that might take of the edge of losing !!!!!!!!!!!!"
"What is going on in CHina? All their data is great, all their stocks are getting crushed."
"Buy. Buy. Buy. Be greedy when others are fearful. This day, take a moment of silence for all the people who were surprised by the negative earnings, because they forgot about the fine... Now the institutions have waited a bit on buying to let the price drop... Bigger buying could kick in any time in the next couple months... Then we fly high....just a guess"
Nice to see green in HK but its not a significant move. Yhe usual $2 above US price. However the HK index is down as are US futures so green is still welcomed
So many allegedly shorts who are just waiting to plunge in at a good price.
"Hmm. So it is another media attack on Alibaba shares. Pure manipulation which aims to bring uncertainty to investors. And of course lower share price. If it was confirmed, it might be positive. But when press and Ant official are saying something different each, it returns uncertainty and fear among investors... Remember the price has lost much not only on the investigation announcement but also on Ma dissapearance rumour..."
They want you to sell so they can buy cheap shares!!
im not selling my $baba shares until it hits at least 300 which then may sell just a portion of it. whos with me ?
"Looks just like another down Dismal day for BABA shareholders !!!! Here we are at the Market open , and it already is down !!!!!!!!!! How low do you think it will go today ???????"
Don’t listen to anything in a media this week the truth is fine was lower than expected and between now until or into or the day of earnings when they announce an  IPO everybody will jump back on again no matter what happens here￼
"If Baba goes to 250 we are going to the moon, Baba just needs to break through the 240s which in the last 3 times has dropped to the 220s right after."
Will be over 220 by EOD
"China loves the confidence , big rise during the Asian session !"
Joseph how can you claim your right when it goes down not even a whole percent but yesterday you said 200 is coming and it was up 9% after ya said that soooo???
"Bottom for the day is in. Gap filled, weak hands flushed. Updraft begins! Fight for Green close. Long and Strong...."
Looking at alibaba like...
 It was at 215 at 9:30 and 207 at 10:30. USA FINALLY showed Baba a little bit of love today. And then China smacked it back down like a dog. This stock is gArbage.
"With Thurday’s ER the stock will be trading around 20 P/E which is a bargain for a company that is so dominant in its space and keep growing in different sectors. One thing to look for should be the Cloud business. Alibaba currently holds the biggest market share in Cloud business in China and as we know from US, this sector will grow more and more in China as well. I look forward seeing the revenues for this quarter. I can list why I am so bullish for BABA below:- Growth of the company YoY has been so bealthy, especially the profit margins are extremely good compared to other mega cap names.- Ant IPO will come into play at some point. I expect it to be by the end of this year. Once that happens, all the uncertainty on this stock will be over and institutions will feel more comfortable buying BABA (although a lot of them been adding BABA to their portfolio recently).- Growth of China and the big potential of Asia market. I personally believe that the Chinese economy will surpass US within next 10 years. And I see it as the inevitable end. With this economic growth and increase in demand for e-commerce in China, Alibaba will retain his dominance in this space, growing their revenues even more year by year.You should have a long term mindset for this stock. If you want to make quick money you shouldn’t really be in this stock. Maybe try playing with option market instead. For me this is a 3-5 year hold and it is a stress free hold as the numbers don’t lie. This is one of the healthiest businesses out there with a very reasonable price. I am currently adding more to my portfolio and will keep adding if the stock continues falling until $190-$200 range.I wish you all luck and don’t forget, patience always pays off."
Great trading stock. Sold some puts to play the next move up. This should be high 200’s but China has put a lid on all China stocks for now. Shouldn’t last for much longer.
"10 minutes to open in HK. 9988 will not go even .01 down -> BABA has a 10B share buyback wall that is going to be in place. You have seen the low for the next 5 years or more. Unless BABA announces a 8:1 stock split, you won't see this SP anytime soon."
What is the guarantee that CPC will not slap another fine on BABA?
If you're smart move your money to BABA fast. China is the new world leader. 3× our first quarter GDP. Wait until consumer awareness kicks in. Someone shorting this is as delusional as can be. Will be the most valuable company in the world within 2 years max.
Apple EPS rock!! Imagine BABA!!! Ufff cant wait!!
"Buy now or wait ? WAIT ! Price can go to $180.00 .... This is possible , not because I hate CCP or the company ...I'd buy but not for $200.00"
"the news on ANT is that they already started to help ANT make adjustments. it will be back for IPO soon. may not be the previous valuation, but still a big plus to BABA holders."
"Matsuyama victory was the bullish signal we needed. Go BABA, cheers to the asians!"
"When price was 240 USD media says buy, when price is 225 USD media says sell. Do you guys follow the recommendations?"
"Days like today make me feel SO GLAD , That I , the ""GREAT JOSEPH"" sold all my Baba shares when they were at $310.00 a share !!!!!!!!!!! I warned others on here to also sell !!!! What did I get in RETURN for trying to help ??????????"
HK is close.... do we have enough positive energy to pump this up tmr? HK market is more positive on BABA than US these days...
"Crazy stock performance and clearly trying to shake out weak hands (for months already). Remember, fundamentals are great and longterm stock performance will be positive...don’t look day by day."
Rumor has it that BABA bears have joined together and are launching a go fund me page to help cover their puts
so no downgrades? Just a few token target adjustments ?
Somebody tell me how Zacks equity research wrote an article about the projected 70% revenue growth and 40% EPS growth but still telling people to sell... makes no sense.
"I'm telling you people to go watch on "" YOU TUBE"" "" Ticked off VIC "" !!! He explains the stock market for us DUMMIES !!!!!!!"
4th consecutive green day in a row
Munger said BABA will be very cheap this Friday ? Why china selling baba ?
Man talk about over sold
1 direction to EOY. back to 300+
Jimmy Z and Joesph are quiet
OK we're past the U.S. $243 mark. Let's see if we can make $250 before NY opens tomorrow. (or even after)Nite all!!!!!
"$260 possible next couple days. Next month income report will come out next month, $285 is possible."
"Love seeing all the shorts tryna scare investors away. Look at the 6 month chart people, lotssss of room to fill still. See you at 300"
What is the tragic news today???Jack Ma is constipation?
Very little to none to support the stock price from NASDAQ trading bots. The earnings call seems not providing more guidance and details on the status of regulatory pressure and management was reluctant to dig into further developments. Simply general projections and forecasts.Hoped for comments to delist from hostile soil and SEC details. In my opinion Alibaba should file an application to remove the stock from trading in USA. It could improve price discovery and steady sock price removing impact from NASDAQ tracking bots.
"Dont forget, 1 year target 313"
just switched out of BA to buy BABA....thats why BA is up and BABA is down....
If Charlie buys I buy. He’s 95 I’m 25
Well they {THEY} timed news impeccable and obviously with double bottom 222; now  news should come out ‘on the charts’ when it hits 265 [hence jumping over the 276 entry point] making people buy at 285. Don’t play the game_Live It! IM
"Just keep buying more Baba shares the DIPS !!!!!!! There have been many , many DIPS , since I sold all my Baba shares at $310.00 !!!!!!!!! I hope you people keep buying more on the way down from today !!!!!!! GOOD LUCK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Try this one:https://seekingalpha.com/news/3682772-jack-mas-exit-from-ant-group-could-revive-worlds-biggest-ipo
keep buying short term calls instead of actual shares and you will never see it trading above $200 for years....
Pe 23….What else as this low valuation is fraud ?Baba is after the fine a no brainer.
"Nursery school math though sometimes unnoticed, 5 steps forward and 4 steps back, better than 2 steps forward 3 steps back. Moving in the right direction now!"
"Berkshire Hathaway Inc Annual Meeting - there was a Question about China and Alibaba; Munger praised Jack Ma, and also said that China is not going to stop Chinese companies from flourishing.Buffet added that China has 3 large cap stocks from his discussion earlier."
MEMOR TO SHAREHOLDERS: Look at Bollinger Bands...already tightening so volatility is way down vs open...as expected and Money flow again...is not confirming this drop as the bet to make. STAY LONG AND STRONG and Jack Ma....keep thy mouth closed....you were given 2 ears and one mouth...use them in that ratio. Boolean
"Big funds -> several big funds were max leverage and hedgefunds were selling shares. In China retail has been deleveraging for some time now.Historical low PE ratio for high growth is 20 PE. We are almost making history.Downside risk is a lot lower than upside risk, especially if you can hold 2+ years.Do not worry my friends and goodluck.Add when prices are low, sell when prices are high. Historical high PE for Chinese tech is near 60."
How is it possible that the company with the highest growth has the lowest P / E.
"If BABA price does not ""jump"" then probably get no reaction or even sell off as weak hands leave. But still great long term buy and hold."
What is going on are the shorts going on holiday !
Rise like a Phoenix ! 1500 shares here.
Any legit reason for 3% down today? I can’t find anything.
Anything under $250 on this stock is still a fantastic buy. Either as a swing trade or a long term buy and hold.
I'm hedging the market will react kindly to the bright future ahead for BABA. It is after all a highly profitable company.
"No upside catalysts but a lot of downside risk, I am modeling that we will see at least a 60% downside correction - STRONG SHORT"
I wonder who is selling..
Finally some movement from BABA!.. I can see some large block buys.. must be more hedgefunds loading up.
Volume too small today to make up for the weeks of losses. Little progress has been made.Consider this a warning.
This stock is under the control of some very bad people. It is called Wall Street!!!
"As it drops, still is the best value of any company on the planet - this is a WINNER long term!"
My prediction of $ 210.00 a share is slowly becoming a Reality !!!!!! I told you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Chartwise (aka TA voodoo), BABA still looks OK to me on the daily. Even with all the ""bad"" news, we are still above the 220-230 band of support.RSI holding near 50(want it above this), +DI above -DI (and ADX), and MACD line is positive sloping trying to break the 0 line with positive hist. Negative of course is the downward sloping 50 and 100 sma, with that 200 sma ceiling at 260 (all ema's are negative). The 20 sma is positive, and I would like to see BABA stay above it at 233.18.Real test is to see if we can break 240, and finally 245. After that, clear sailing to 260.Unless there is some positive catalyst(earnings?), this will take time to resolve. Have patience. The good news is that volume has been anemic since the gap up to 245, and that gap has effectively been filled.Holding BABA at these levels is like holding cash with an ITM call option. The downside is very limited."
"Here come the filings: Flossbach von Storch of Cologne, Germany, bought 70,797 additional American depositary receipts of Alibaba to end the quarter with 336,295 ADRs. ( barrons: big-buys-apple-alibaba-stock-large-investor-sold-ea-activision-stock-51620240256)."
$ 210.00 is where it's been !!!!!!!!!!!!!! $ 200.00 is coming in !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Look at the 6mo chart to get an idea where we're heading.
"I have been POUNDING the TABLE over the last Six months on here telling you people that BABA would hit $ 210.00 a share !!!!!!!!!!! Well , it finally happened !!!!!!!! Only one person , out of hundred's on here , sent me a thank you note !!!!!!! Only one !!!!!!!!! What's that old saying in the Stock Market , "" IT gets ""LONELY at the TOP"" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Looks strong today
"BABA has more revenue and earnings than Amazon, Google, and even Microsoft. PE in low 20's. Forward PE of 16. Is there a question why Munger bought? I added more in Friday as well. You normally can't get stocks at these prices, and when you can, you buy in big. People will look back and ask themselves why didn't they buy more instead of sitting by in fear?"
Anyone read that article on investor place regarding baba? Indicates a 50% run up to 345 this year. Any thoughts on that? It's on Google. Came out a day ago.
"I totally agree with this statement :This is one of the most dominant companies in the world, alongside Google, Amazon, Microsoft. There's absolutely no bear case for this company. Government intervention is in the past, with the massive fine that this company took.Even ken fisher no Charlie munger have invested , ken fisher it is one of the biggest Position in his Fonds with about 2,8 % of total volume….wow. And ken was often right, he is a legend."
In the next 10 years Alibaba is likely more than double the current price

"Chinese online retailing behemoth Alibaba Group Ltd. is being fined a record 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) after an antitrust investigation found it abused its dominance to punish merchants who sold goods on rival platforms, China's market regulator said Saturday morning."
Im out valuation is not important anymore what matters is sentiment. Just name 1 chinese company that has uptrend price action. The whole world is shorting chinese companies. Free money to long US cyclicals.
OK !!!! MARGIN CALL at close today 4 pm !!!!!!!!! PAY UP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Meanwhile, GME is up 5%. Go figure."
"If BABA is such a powerful company and China is such a power company, can someone explain why the Chinese bank such as 3988.hk, 1398.hK, 1288.hk are less than $5 HK dollars per share after so many years. Will BABA become like them also????"
"Bro, u should buy at this point when everything seem to be bad but the prices is around 220-230 levels why?.1. When the good new come it will fly like a Rocket.2. If its really bad why its not down below 200? Its seem like the market maker want to accumulate at this level..Once the Dust appear, it will move 300+ , this is an smart move to join this ride."
Chinese stocks make you sleep with one eye open. Too many good US companies. Why buy a communist controlled company?
Green is green. Build a solid base in 230s and move to higher regions after earnings.
"by 1:30 PM, typical (avg) volume would be about 10.3MM shares, and we hit 12.7MM, so Volume is running 20%+ over recent avg; a very positive sign"
If everyone knows baba is undervalued why is its SP unchanged in 3 years and 4 months?Little buying pressure - stock is struggling to hold 213
"As the day goes on , Baba price continues to go lower !!!!!!!!! Little by Little Baba shares are falling down !!!!!!!!"
this is atleast a trillion dollar behemoth if not more.which means atleast 360 dollars a pop in share price.China is a giant and Alibaba is its engine.350 this year
"WOW......both JPM and GS saying buy BABA? Earnings on Thursday, do they know something?"
"When I read the assessments of certain bearish analysts in Seeking Alpha, InvestorPlace, etc, I am very cautious about them and ask myself if they have done their homework. Most of these bearish analysts say that the delisting issue is critical, other ones say that the delisting issue is not critical but the current regulation inside China is the critical issue, other ones say that the competition from PDD and JD is a threat. Apparently, these guys dont know what are the competitive advantages of Alibaba, they dont know how the regulations are not really impacting Alibaba's business model, they dont know what are the core values of Alibaba that make it well prepared to embrace any change in the market conditions, they just write about this company without making an effort to go beyond the news, because that's what an analyst must do. It's really hard for any competitor in China to actually compete agaisnt Alibaba, knowing that this company was made since its inception to compete. Alibaba innovates continuously, offering more and more innovating services to its active users, if its market in China is decelerating, its market is South East Asia is still in a early stage; its cloud business is going like a rocket, its other promissing businesses will be a reality at some point and Ant is advancing to adapt itself to the new regulations, reaching agreements with commercial banks in China to increase its fees which will compensate the higher capital requirements, so Ant is advancing in its process of its future IPO. Combining all of these, with the fact that the government of China really dont have the incentives to weaken Alibaba's position because it is one of its weapons to fulfill its own goals to expand Chinesse operations in the world, particularly in Asia. Im sure Munger saw all of these plus other information that he is managing to put money in this company. I am sure these bearish analysts are waiting for a better environment for Alibaba, but then, the price would be more than 350$, and then they will say that you should buy!. In other words, not buy at 225$, buy at 350$, laughable!, that's why they are just analyst! not professional investors!"
$245 next week. I think so....
Wake up - the market doesnt like the ER or we wouldnt still be floating around 213Need another catalyst
Normally when I see these insurrections of bear nonsense it means there will be pushback and no flare of 10% push is realistic the day of but remember why this got big in the first place. It’s real growing and will continue to do so. Alibaba is a movement and so was Amazon. This stock does not represent alibaba and alibaba does not represent the stock. But oh boy is it going to in the next year
"let's leave for a second the fundamental and the cash flow which is great! the potential growth of baba its greater than amzn, its why the financial advisor at Charlie Munger bought the stock"
Am I reading this wrong or would they have beat estimates by about. Ten cents if not for the 2.8 billion fine Xi extracted.
"Alibaba HK up 6% ,,in premarket, let's see if it can hold until the end"
"Its kind of hard to believe, but we are pretty much back to where we were in Jan 2019. The company has delivered very good performance in the meanwhile. It won't sit here very long. It's a growth stock that has become a value investment!"
"That sheep upgrade to save his clients. I repeat, this is $137 at max. It's breaking down hard"
According to the fundamentals to the technicals on RBLX Alibaba is worth 1467 a share
"Baba is about to the price where a drastic reversal it due. Enjoy. You have been warned.Oh wait, I already made that statement....BAAHH HAHAHA...you were warned."
Can't wait for the quarterly results. Good growth might shake off the hesitation some people still have despite the ending of the antitrust probe.
The stock price went down for good earning report. Wait till China is being sanctioned which will go either further.
If I wasn't over leveraged in BABA I would buy more!!!
"Don't worry about HK price. They were closed when earnings came out, so they should drop ~6% too.And we saw how when HK rallied the other day, the US price closed down. So forget it.Be patient as this builds a new base to slowly take off from."
"Even at this price, it's an extremely undervalued growth company. It's a cash cow. A P/E of 36 would be appropriate. Plus, the Ant IPO will happen!"
Stop your crying out there !!!!!!!! I can hear all you people crying at my house !!!!!!! I told you to sell !!!!!!!!
If I can convert all my shares to MICROSOFT at the same price level I would do it in a heartbeat
"Folks....relax, Baba is not going anywhere and Wall Street will not allow the US to tank their investment - or pension funds invested in BABA. China will need US investors $$$ for a long long time. Things will work out. And as for ANT. Whatever it’s valuation - BABA shareholders (and holders of its ADRs) get ANT for free."
"no retail investor would sell here, after this mornings report."
Baba is still in a downtrend. People don't do research anymore.
"No one selling today has made profit in like a year, they should have sold a year ago not now. Company is growing 30-40% per year, forward pe now under 20. Insanity"
beyond oversold.
Next week option chain looks like a 230.00 USD expiration (+-2.50 USD)
Great news from Hong-Kong ! Alibaba up 1% ! New price $200.00 ! This is amazing !
All the theories yet nobody really knows anything about BABA price action.
These are the happy times and when baba goes lower there will be more happiness!!Praise be the warning.
"HK Market Short Sale of BABA Stock increased to 1.193 B (5,461,900 shares ) on 12 May from 945.2M (4,537,600 shares) on 11 May.On Monday 12 April ( after the settlement announcement was made ), the short sale was up to 3.07B ( 13,187,100 shares ). Expect an increase in Short sale after earnings."
just waiting for CCP to make BABA a state company
And here we goooo
"I know this isn't exactly BABA, but help me understand please. Why did nasdaq jump with bad jobs report? Expectation of loose monetary policy to continue?"
"""BABA is trading about 34% below its all-time high and 18% below its 200-day moving average. Historically, there have been two times when BABA traded this far below its 200-day moving average. Both times BABA staged a strong comeback and produced enormous returns for those who bought the dip."""
They had some interesting insights about BABA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I’m 23 and just went all in with one year of my salary If value investing works as old folks say then I’m gonna be riding a Lamborghini at my 28 birthday
Should I buy calls on baba?
I'm getting tired of this slowly dying stock. Losses keep adding up as the stock market goes up. And the stock pundits keep praising it. ? Are we getting played?
"Alibaba has over 1 billion customers worldwide while Amazon has only 300 million customers. BABA also has much better PE ratio and revenue increasing rate. The only problem Is the Cold War between US and China, but that is unlikely under the current administration"
"A trader earns regardless of market fluctuations, I started investing using Jared Moolmans signals in June of last year, he shared his commercial techniques and helped me achieve my goals and now the profit rate is exponential. TeIegram> @jaredtrade"
It’s clear that the CCP does not allow western investors to make money on the back of Chinese companies.
Looks as though Eric is having a bad day. He seems to have the perfect demeanor to handle the ups and downs of the market.
Did you see PLTR today go from -10% in pre market trading to now standing at +7%?... shows how quickly the sentiment can change.. one day soon BABA may also rocket 17% in a few hours
Great call! 
Charles Thomas Munger already knew this news a week ago. This is how rich people get richer.
"My only focus come earnings will be any announcement in BABA complying with new US reporting regulations. If BABa cant affirmatively state it will comply (and perhaps when) after nearly a year, then Ive lost the remaining confidence I have in the stock. Despite what many post on here, delisting is a real headwind and until that is lifted, I fear we underperform the market."
"BABA litteraly has more income every year than companies like (MFST, AAPL, AMAZON,...) It is for sure undervalued and will skyrocket when the world forgets about the delisting and fines.."
"yay! baba is only at Christmas massacre price now when I bought and thought ""well this must be the bottom"""
"As someone just posted: ""China was the ONLY major economy to record growth in 2020, expanding 2.3% as many countries struggled to contain the caronavirus"". (Credit to CNN Business). Wondering when BABA will respond?"
HK up to 234 (nearly +7.5%) and shows BABA opening up to 241.5+ tomorrow
Downtrend and descending triangle are strongly established and reming in place. Enjoy!!You were warned.
I see the bashers are all out today. That's good sign
Shopify and Amazon all getting their items here in Alibaba..so educate yourselves people!
lots of volume with increasing price. Over demand now. We will be back to 300 in a short while!!!
"Alibaba (09988) 3Q net up 52% to RMB79,427 million"
"Average babas 5 year PE is 38 and maximum is 62, that is higher than apple and Facebook and the same as google.All of the “discount because Chinese” is mere propaganda brainwashed kids believe."
i told you guys at the start of the day... there has been many block buys since morning.. the whales have had enough of sitting on the sidelines
"sad to say, but this is dead money, and likely all chinese stocks are now."
B Ron bashing Baba again today {actually saying it’s to big for it’s bridges {and mentioned 2.8B fine again} ; they did this to aapl in the fall of 2012 then had and has its parabolic run since.
BABA better get this stock back on track or else watch investor money disappear. I'm sure many investors are fed up with what's going on and aren't willing to forgo much more lost opportunity cost.
Will earnings save Baba we will see.
Buy and hold to $400
"Today , was the last time you will see Baba at $ 210.00 a share !!!!!!!! You might want to take a picture of that moment !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Up 8% in HK. Short squeeze in US open will take it even higher. Well done longs! Nice to see shorts out back in thier places. Enjoying the view from the sidelines.
Super triple bottoms and supports at 222.x was exactly the inflection point for super up swing to recoup the 30% lost. Super upswing.

The stock is broken:- SP almost same as Jan 2018- And yet volume is still low- Still down 3x Naz
This is mostly shorts covering their position. Not convinced the downward trend has reversed already.
Today another RED DAY ! Investors in Hong-Kong said $197.00 is better than $200.00 .... NYSE will adapt new low today
Not a very good day needs more volume. But anyway second green in a row! Let’s go!
I’m working a second job just so I can buy more at these prices

12noon news : Goldman Sachs amongst hedge funds surveyed￼￼Alibaba one of top picks
MEMO TO SHAREHOLDERS: This drop won't last - tomorrow a big up day. Boolean
Will be up 6-9% tomorrow!
Please keep selling
I wonder which hedge fund did a big dump during market and still after market since price is constant its a calculated change of hands by a hedges
I have added another one…..ridicolous reaction.Baba is on the right path.
Genuinely comical that people will buy NIO with both hands but don’t like Alibaba... chase the stock up thousands of a percentage in a year.
Very nice last half hour and close. High volume and recovering from almost day low. 210 has acted as a support today.
BABA is a Titanic that it got sank by the Chinese government.
"you buy companies, not charts lol."
Thank you communist Chinese leaders for making it so easy to short sell your company's please continue to fine ALIBABA and tencent please take ant data and all profits i reccommend taxing baba 95% and use profits to bolster your military
"Alibaba reports 78% revenue growth and almost $150B revenue forecast for 2021 ... and the stock is down focusing on China penalty and still very valuable asset Ant Financial?? My advice, buy BABA while on sale today!"
"Every Chinese company do money laundering. They just issue 5% shares at IPO, then pump and issue shares at the top. Check FUTU, PDD, YY, MOMO. GSX, and so many. Kick them out of US."
"When is JPM ever right? Sell NIO at $5, while it’s at $7 and heading up? Yeah. Go listen to JPM, MS, and the rest... you sure will make a lot of $$$."
just hear to laugh at bears
Down 3% on NOTHING
"Objectively: the deal the Chinese goverment gave to Alibaba was more than a sign of goodwill and a quick way to move forward; if they were to postpone it, it would have likely resulted in more serious consequences.Media: the media says it is a bad deal that the fine is ''HUGE'' in fact ''HUMONGEOUS'', if you are from Zimbabwe you know numbers mean nothing if you don't put them in perspective. Alibaba has near 50B in cash, minus 2,8B still leaves about.. uhm.. 47,2B. More than enough cash to buy a piece of bread in Zimbabwe during high inflation."
Last chance to buy today!Over $250 by EOM!
"CNBC Flash - Goldman Sachs Picks 'Inexpensive' China Stocks - Alibaba, Tencent and BaiduPain will now start to shift to you shorties. Cover now and take your profits as you will see this baby at much higher levels fast. You have been warned as Jimmy z shorty would say."
"Good-morning fellow Longs!-that was a kick in the nuts yesterday; in fact its been rough for several months now-the Baba financials yesterday were fine, all over ... Revenue and subscriber growth exceptional-I haven't seen any downgrades today, just a couple ""maintains"" from Citi and Keybanc ... I cut n paste the target prices from the excellent summary provided by @stocktargetadvisor in his post from 2 hours ago ... my experience is these targets are set at about 65% - 80% of where they believe the SP will end up, give themselves a cushion-note that yesterday, PBOC/SAMR renewed Baba's Ant license; although mostly a formality, it was still a positive move-we are not out of the woods until the so-called regulatory overhang is put to bed ... plus the China-US-Aus sabre rattling is a wet blanket as well: there is no quick SP acceleration and drops could still be in the forecast ... but there are a lot of intelligent ""Investors"" on this Board that know that already, and thats just the way it is Godspeed, and keep up the informative Posts!JMHO and GLTA! $BABA (from @stocktargetadvisor, thx Man for the excellent info!)Target Lowered by Citigroup Buy USD 338 » USD 306Target Lowered by Benchmark Positive » Buy USD 310 » USD 285Target Lowered by KeyBanc Overweight USD 305 » USD 275Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 305 » USD 275"

"I have the idea the price is manipulated due to outstanding calls. A lot off retail investors buy calls and hope for easy money. However, the reverse is true -> smart money is selling calls and will keep prices low. The retail calls will end worthless and it is easy money for smart money and no reason to let the stockprice raise (they are earning on these low levels). At the moment retail won’t buy calls, the stockprice will rise...I hope we will ever become this smart. I only poses stocks by the way."
I’ll pay for psychology services of anybody that thinks this is going down tomorrow. Try up minimum 5%
"This should clear the way with  and the gov: Ant officially tested China's digital yuan in July 2020. By November 2020, the fintech company had deepened cooperation with the central bank's digital currency institute over many projects, including OceanBase database.In December 2020, Ant launched a digital yuan trial in Shanghai, according to the company's poster. It also showed that Ant started to roll out the digital yuan in different parts of the country for a variety of industries at the start of this year.A MyBank representative said that it ""will steadily advance the trial pursuant to the overall arrangement of the People's Bank of China""."
WOW! BABA GREEN. Maybe those put-buyers were wrong??? Sure hope so.
Off to a good start in HK:236.40+3.20(+1.37%)21:36:34-Delayed Data.($243.96 US)
Why is BABA even in a correction with the other high growth tech stocks? It's almost like trying to get the air out of an already deflated basketball.
Anyone who is an expert in technical charts can tell me if its likely BABA will fall below 210 in the near future?
Thinking to buy 1 year out of the money call options.. strike around 400. Any thoughts?
"This is going to drop to $150. Way undervalued, but too many questions from the Chinese govt."

I have 95 shares at the average of $247 . If it hits its previous high of 325 I will be taking home a big chunk of profit
Only 4% up since the great news about the ending of the investigation...
Let’s vote!Who thinks baba is a buy here?Thumbs up buy thumbs down sell
"This is way undervalued (compare the numbers with AMZN).This was in a strong uptrend, until the fears about government regulations take place.The strong uptrend than has changed to a strong downtrend.Since a while now, the hand break was/is in.The fears are now gone and the hand break will be releases soon (as soon as the price remains stable or go up slightly, what is in progress right now).After the hand break is released fully, this will go up fast to the old heights and above!So.. buy right now and be part of the ride up!!"
"Added so much when it was in the 220s, my account is about to explode!"
all the options from 225 -235 wiped out for todays expiration. look how low the volume is again? hopefully volume picks up next week cos right now there is 0 interest in this stock.
Could not even imagine this stock would turn out to be such a big disappointment!
"if it wasn’t for the fine Alibaba paid for anti trust probe, the estimate eps would have beaten with no hassle. This is still a fast growing company and the share price will reflect that in the future."
"Baba received another Buy, this time from Needham. Analyst Vincent Yu assigned a Buy rating to Alibaba today and set a price target of $330.00. The company’s shares closed last Friday at $222.02."
Jimmy Z you can warned my Big D
Forward PE on Baba a little over 15! Amazing on a growth stock!
"From Bloomberg:""Chinese regulators say Tech firms should heed Alibaba's example.""So now the Chinese ""the man"" is holding up BABA as a well done example of kissing tail. Definitely a major indicator that BABA is back on the path of increased share price. No idea how long it will truly take, but see the longs at $300+ sometime in the near future."
"Chinese government want BABA to go down as they want people worship Mao and not successful companies or CEO. Can't invest China like a regular companies. Furthermore, China will be sanctioned soon. This stock will be $25 soon once it has been delisted in US."
"Love this stock regardless of the short term, it is a solidified long term hold"

Why is everyone so surprised?Man you guys need to wake upThe momentum is on the sell side - fundamentals dont matter atm
"Am a bit afraid a market market wide correction will push Baba even further down. More regulatory news, even if not relevant, can also affect Baba. It's all about stuff not directly related to the company right now."
They trying to get cheap shares before earnings blowout!!!! This is incredible manipulation loll
China Joe has a yen for little boys and little girls and Xi has plenty of tapes to show the world. Round eye Joe had no idea Asians were such good videographers. Who knew?

Huge earnings just came out by Berkshire Hathaway buffet is buying back stock! now for just a mention BABA pre-earnings he bought a little bit BABA {to back up his buddy Charlie Munger}￼ can catapult this _not to mention yet any  news At earnings release even if it was to mention that it was ready for next year would clear the way fir the charts positive momentum moving forward starting this May. Now. 12-18 months looks very promising & with also cloud exposure news advancement and its growth from these stages with potential for far more growth ahead in that field ￼￼opens wide open opportunities in fundamentals To technicals
"Baba prices ever so temping, though HK seems to point up and indicating over-reaction for yesterday's selloff. I'm happy with the size of my BABA position and the cost at which I was able to build it, so tuning out for a while and check back later to see how things are flying with this. Remember gents, patience is your friend, dont sell low and fundamentals on this will eventually prevail."
Where are all those KNOW it ALL's TODAY ?????????????? You know who you are !!!!!!! Come out and face me !!!!!!!
The bears have been saying Baba will hit 200 for months now and the bulls have been saying 250 for 2 weeks now lets see who's right.
Hi Jimmy!
"Baba does not seem to be going anywhere fast ????? Most of you people on here will be putting in for SOCIAL SECURITY , way before BABA reaches $310.00 a share again !!!!! I never like taking back the same REAL ESTATE over and over again !!!!! Make your profit then get out !!!!!!!!"
WOW (that’s all I have to say)
Until the delisting issue is resolved this is going nowhere’s.
OK that's getting really redicolous..... I hope very negative news to come so the stock price will pop up 
"imagine if HK was green, +15%"
We have buyers !!!!!
"Weak hands, penny flippers are selling. I can wait for a couple hundred thousand dollars payday in few months."
"Baba has come down a long way , since , I sold all my shares at $310.00 a while back !!!!!!!!!!!"
Why is this lagging? Looks like fundamentals don't matter. Politics?
"Every bump is sold off in the last 6 months. Some bumps take weeks to sell, some days. I wonder what would make BABA run again. Yes, some mention options. But looking at option chain we would be at 225 in two weeks again. Is that really so? I do not want to believe that."
Had 700. Added 800 on the date of fine. Huge chunk of my folio. JD occupies half as much space in my folio.
New support is 210That’s free advice.
"Fearless prediction $230 tomorrow, $245 after earnings, and $250 by Friday"
"Empower Clinics Inc. was said to have declared that the expansion of Kai Laboratory to triple its current size was nearing completion.

"Ok shorts, tell me one mega tech stock with such great fundamentals where I should put my money instead of BABA?"
So very tired of the manipulation.
"Isn’t anyone worried Jack Ma is not visible, maybe something happen to him no one talks about? Shouldn’t the SCE investigate since we have so many investors in BABA? If Elon Musk were to disappear surely the news would be scrambling, is the China government coving something up?"
I see $250 on the horizon again. Yup.
What a day for the longs  enjoy it boys.
"""On Wednesday (01/18/18), the European Union slapped a record 4.34 billion euro ($5 billion) fine on Google for using its Android phone software to stifle competition.""The stock was trading approximately $1,131.41 and the fine was to be paid to a foreign country,while today the share is trading well above $2,200+BABA was fined $2.7 billion within its own country and recently closed approximately $223. Now that BABA has this prior pending issue behind it is a better position than Google was when it was fined double that of BABA and paid to a foreign entity. In my view BABA has and continues to be extremely undervalued, so is l now be the time for the investors to buy? Mr. Charlie Munger (vice president of Berkshire Hathaway) disclose he thinks so with his $37.5 million investment in BABA as of March 31. BABA's current shareholders and potential investors may now be in line with that the share price will now reverse to the upside as it has now the ability to regain momentum throughout the markets to align its share price with its competitors that have always had a smaller footprint and revenue stream. What may be required from BABA is to better inform the market on how it will now focus on making the long term investor some solid returns over the next few quarters and gain the trust of potential investors it will only go up from its 52 weeks high of 319+ when it regains it and that it will continue to go vertical from there.In the long run for BABA despite the fine, can finally move past it and China was the ultimate beneficiary of the $2.7 billion dollars it will get in return. The share price may have a pullback or it might go up from here knowingly that the Ant Finacial IPO may soon be announced to be in play for some time this year, which BABA would make up for the fine paid within minutes or hours and then some if it were to occur, and every BABA investor should be rewarded too."

"Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) had its price objective lowered by Stifel Nicolaus from $305.00 to $290.00 in a research report report published on Tuesday, Benzinga reports. The brokerage currently has a buy rating on the specialty retailers stock. Been watching stocks like this. Found a service that tells me buys and sells. https://investena.today/wncdgv"
I would expect a huge run this week. The stock is MASSIVLY oversold and fundamental a screaming buy.A tech bargain. Hence I will add on Monday.
November 2022: 350 USD price target.End of 2021: 270 USD price target.Goodluck my friends. (target prices adjusted to the downside: earnings call mentioned that Alibaba will support merchants more in cost of margins)
Any chance of a little pre-earnings run in to the close?
Anyone seen molester Joseph today? the guy was so hyped yesterday not even Yahoo personnel could calm him down.
I repeat $137 on this. Let's play !!
Why do we want to invest in a country that bring the world pandemic?
Baba sure is piling up the doo doo logs.You have been warned.
I heard about BABA the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Five days after the disastrous (or was it?) earnings report.....And she's recovering nicely. Congrats to those who didn't get shaken out (And double congrats to those who pumped the dip).
Why the sell off?
China is probing ANT's Listing process-Bloomberg. I always believed the IPO would be this year..............
I'm glad I own at 179. The under performance of this earnings monster is insane. Once it hits 300 (if ever at this rate) I'm dumping 25 percent of this dog!
Imagine selling for these prices lmao
by this board I guess baba soon goes to $0 so why don't you guys just short it?
Interesting to see whether Alibaba will be able to stick to the long term trendline in the next weeks
"Where are all the ""KNOW it ALL""S hiding out ????? C'MON come out , come out and face me !!!!!!!!!!!!"
Buy more and hold
"So investigations are over, Baba pays a pocket change, and it is moving onto other things...this is the cheapest big tech stock - should move up - I say $250 - $270 soon"
"Yesterday was good since BABA was inversely correlated to the Naz. Usually this is not the case. Let's hope this continues, though we're down with the Naz in pre-mkt. ~215 is the first resistance we need to break while holding 212."
"I sold part of my shares back at 265, I'm pretty sure this moove have some legs and 260-270 in few weeks is probable. I'm not adding on the news but riding with what I have now"
"I was right on the money today about BABA taking a dive !!!!!!!!! Yet, not one of ""Jealous Little PEOPLE"" thank me !!!!!!!!!! WHY is that ????????????"
Maybe the Chinese leaders are shorting their own stocks and then will cover and go long before announcing that they will agree to let their corporations open their accounting books to western regulators Forman’s te amo of approval. They would make hundreds of billions so it makes sense. It’s the wonderful part of being an autocracy. You can do any illegal ante the al thing I want to manipulate markers without repercussions
HK should celebrate NYSE holding up tonight {& wow}
Everything's green today but volume is below average. I smell bull trap. Let see how it goes on Monday
"Looking for HK? Forget it:National Day Wednesday, May 19, 2021 Closedtomorrow"
"If you think this is good, wait until they announce the Ant IPO soon..."
"I added twice in small position today:$239,51 and $238,68. If it continues up I am happy (get rich); if it goes down I am happy (add more). Always be happy :)"
"Mungers fund buy with 7 out of 10 positive buy rating: Daily Journal purchased 165,320 shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), giving the position 19.02% equity portfolio weight. Shares averaged approximately $245.98 during the first quarter; the stock is significantly undervalued based on Tuesday's price-to-GF Value ratio of 0.66. If average price 246 held for 12 months total fund inception they will be looking for 12% value hold time since fund inception; so let’s say held 8 months averaged down here they will be looking for a 270 exit or 300+ yr 2022"
"why investors may be afraid is the (vie-shares). I'm not afraid of it. Charlie Munger, for example, said china's government would allow listed companies to flourish. it is possible that china gets a lot of lawsuits from big investors. this will take them a lot of time and a lot of effort. You never know about china, but these are some of the risks that investors are reluctant to take."
looks like a low vol open today at HK...
"People still buying bank stocks after a 90% run. Media says they are still 'cheap.' Media also telling people not to buy baba until it breaks that 270 resistance. They always want retail chasing high prices, corruption"
"Last days down with low volume, this is classic shake out. Don’t get fooled and hold strong."
"Sell overvalued us tech, buy baba! Btw big tech IS VERY inflation-proof! STRONG BUY"
"Option chain told me it will go to 225-230 by Friday. Honestly, at the open of today I did not think it was possible."
We've been in and out of BABA. We see it as a solid long term growth stock. We sold and took profit when The Chinese gov't announced regulations. We bought 10k on the announcement of the fine in pre-market on 4/12/21. Intending to sell half on the bump and hold half long term. Sold 1/2 for a small 3.7% profit. Then watched it trade sideways. Seeing it was not getting support and heading down we sold the rest of the position for a 2.9% profit. It's now well below our buy pointWe're disappointed that BABA can't overcome negative sentiment short term. We remain confident in the long term prospects but don't want to tie up funds that can make gains elsewhere. We will be buyers again when BABA gets some solid support.This dog can't hunt in the short term...
Forward PE of 18 on company growing rapidly ! I am going to hold the line! Who is with me????
Funny how media on the west are repeating older post...bullish on BABA. Any valuation metric will show that current baba valuation is heavily undervalued. The revenue generating capability is much much greater than Amazon. Only difference is one is a US company and the other a China Company. Would you bet on a growing economy and continue to grow in the near future? For the the choice is a no brainer which will be the largest economy in the future. Very bullish on BABA

"Fasten your seat belts.Earning reveal at may,13th.Baba will wipe out all expectations no this with a pe of 25.This is so crazy and irrational. Crazy investors are buying massive overvalued Tesla stocks with a pe of 700 and a ugly profit from car sales I. It’s last earning reports, that’s fraud."
"so excited....the peanut fine means CCP gives baba a pass to move one, please let me buy more before it soars!"
"Amazing time to start accumulating. MAX option pain did drop to 227,5 USD, but that would only provide more opportunities for further accumulation!"

Don't blame me and my warning on this. I put $137 on this with chances of getting to 84-89.

I wonder what people are buying in this stock market since everything is going down. where is the money goes?
BABA has only one way up
"Ant  IPO On Monday, Ant's Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Jing said in an interview with a state-media outlet, The Paper, that Ant would maintain the continuity and quality of its services while it complies fully with regulations."
"Big sell off is coming. They are not going to make it. Under 200 anytime. CCP is doing money laundering via BABA, Tencent etc. Be safe"
"Same price of one year ago. Check the end of the day, and tomorow. upupup until 220.00$ Remember me.;)"
"Buffett news again, article says that this guy James has beaten buffet: ￼James Anderson has been running this fund since 2000 and has built a reputation on picking out the most promising growth companies of the future. Tech stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and Alibaba (BABA) have been particularly rewarding investments. Anderson recently announced he will be leaving Scottish Mortgage next year."
"I hold this stock, I hate this stock"
"Doing some random research: on March 26 Cathy Wood sold 51,000 shares of Alibaba on April 11 {just 15days later} Charlie Munger bought 167,000 shares! which is more interesting￼"
"this stock should be up much more than it is, on the news story released Saturday. In my opinion."
this stock makes me question every bit of fundamental analysis I know
"2 weeks ago max pain started going up to 240, insiders/market see the fine as a catalyst! Sp will rise next week!"
"Other than possibly earnings, anyone know what's behind this move in the HK session? It's on nice volume too and outpacing other Chinese big tech names by a wide margin. Wonder if record cloud rev # was leaked or ANT/Ma news?"
250$ by earnings
green? must be dreaming
High volume would make this stock at 235 easy
China will become the first country in the world in which e-commerce accounts for more than half of all retail sales in 2021. Alibaba will hold a 50.8% share of the Chinese e-commerce market this year. The price will climb to $300 by December 2021.
Looking at HSI 6 month {& 1 year chart} bottom could have set in [2 bottom point filled]
"Always be a flight to value & quality- weather be metals commodities the dollar stocks bonds, cyclical flight to quality"
"Please stay and close above 50 day SMA of 243.31 ... If done, BABA needs to trade above this level for several days and then it's the 100 and 200 day SMA (249ish and 260ish) that will probably prove to be strong resistance (IMO, the 200 day SMO will ne tough to breach ... )"
"Just woke up, best Monday morning in ages"
Load as much as possible.. this is a sleeping giant… it will blow up anytime soon
Reason? No reason?
Don't ever fall in love with a stock or company!
Price target in a year cut to $310? That’s a forty percent increase. Bad news only of you are expecting a fifty percent increase. You guys ask for too much.
Minus 2 % but volume only 25% of the average. Meituan investigation  .... and all tech companies down. Chinese government never will stop  doing such things in the future...IMHO
"The last days it went down on low volume, the last hours of today it went up with bigger volume. This is actually positive and are signs of bottoming out also with a nice turn over the day. "
"Yup. Called under 200 at 300.. now we see under 100 next... get out.. after US files huge claims on china for unleashing their virus on the world, all china companies on us markets will stop trading.."
BABA overvalue & anti-trust now settled so must get in now. Earnings report will be on third week of May 2021. Expect as usual that BABA will meet its target EPS numbers.
Here it is - again talks of blacklisting in the US. That was the reason for the drop
Alibaba will be expanding to lower tier cities (take part of PDD's business)
"Look at the graph and the present price appears to be just a little bit lower than it’s normal growth rate. It will double by 2024 if people continue to fear China. Otherwise, it will be a lot higher!"
Guessing HK likes corporate America tax hike
Shorts are going to cry! Were is Joseph? :)
I'm so stress beyond recognition
"LMAO, the only positive thing for BABA today is the volume surpassed 3 month average "
Can baba just buyback 5% of shares already and start the run up
"Honestly , Charlie Munger have best friends as China Hedge fund manager, i think he knows that baba will get fine first but he still invest on it. What does it mean...??If something isnt good , why he purchase it? The dust will appear soon. Let's see big Rebounds."
Ant group made 3.4 billion and Alibaba own 1/3 of the company. Just sit back and collect money. I’m expecting 50% return within a year while I sell covered calls. Good luck everyone.
Everybody knew this is going to drop after earnings. Apple did. Amazon did. Amazing numbers and amazing growth. Im loading up today. What a cheap #$%$ prices
bruh bruh bruh...
"Do remember Baba is very good in making V shapes. Just look last year's graph. Also, more and more people will be willing to buy at these bargain prices."
And China government imposed penalty on Alibaba and Tencent again. This time they focus on teaching apps.
It’s consolidation after a $22 pop.... who cares about these noise. Will be higher with the week. Relax.
"$WIMI $NIO $BABA This is the middle line, take it, wait for you to grow steadily"
"China said they will crack down on bitcoin mining and trading activities as part of efforts to fend off financial risks, Bitcoin is probably a con and a crack down is justified. I think BABA is a legitimate enterprise and should not be subject to a crack down. I think."
Those who hold and buy in the biggest drops when everyone else is scared will be the MOST rewarded. Look back at your trades quit making the same mistakes. If you don’t like the company go put your money where you feel more convicted. Most people in here know this is trading extremely low on all levels. You will look back in the future and laugh at why you didn’t buy more. That’s simple.
Monday premarket price predictions?
Puts calls ratio was equal around 1 this morning. Then calls buyers came in and it started dumping. Now .491 keep buying calls if you want it to go down lol.....
"Back to 300$ very soon, enjoy the ride longs!"
"NYSE is below 9988 ($214.24) ... US big money/hedge funds looking for a reason-to-buy, and now looks like the pattern is HK has to be the leader and drag NYSE up: that would be a new role for them, I've found that HK is upward timid and downward volatile ... the Valuation is there, just have to continue to hold (if you believe the value-prop) Interesting newsbit from China Peoples Daily (controlled by CCP) ... years ago, no one (other than Buffet) thought oil could be economically shipped by rail, and now we know different ... New China-Europe freight train service launched(Xinhua) 16:19, May 18, 2021LANZHOU, May 18 (Xinhua) -- A new China-Europe freight train service was launched on Monday, linking Wuwei City in northwest China's Gansu Province with Duisburg in Germany.A freight train loaded with 50 cargo containers departed from Wuwei South Station on Monday, heading west to Duisburg.The journey of more than 9,000 km takes 18 days. Compared with offshore shipping, it saves about 30 days in transportation time, according to the China Railway Lanzhou Bureau Group Co., Ltd., based in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu."
"BABA will surpass Amazon in 10 years, GLTA longs!"
To everyone who bought... congrats! And good luck everyone with the earnings report tomorrow
"Well, I’m in a $213.58. Hope this works out.￼"
Thank you for selling your stocks..So you know all things are made in china even your wives underwear!
Looks like I jumped in too early at 213 but even though I’m negative Baba because it’s a Chinese stock I feel it’s a good add for a swing trade today.
My chart pattern says next week we are at the bottom. There is not a single stock on my list with more value than Alibaba.
"The big run for BABA has started for a few days now, I won't be surprised if it's the stock of the year."
Heading to 180 support--just watch the action !!
Alibaba is up nearly 8% while the market is selling off 1%.
"Jack Ma needs to step down from Alibaba and hand over control of ANT as well. Xi Jinping clearly did not like to be criticised publicly as Ma did, and Ma is paying the consequences of this actions.. If Ma steps down, this stock will take a huge U turn, as this is a solid profitable company"
"s3 208.82 , strong volume,"
This is getting very frustrating
Was today the Darwinian flush?
"staying above 200 would be the best scenario today, forget 210"
At the moment it looks like HK's opening price for BABA will be in the US $248 range.
So wealthy investors are going to stop buying shares because the capital gains tax is going up? Doubt it.
"9988.hk $218.80 , Baba $226.02"
"JimmyZzzz, I heard a rumor that the CCP is working to find your IP Addy. They're getting close to finding your real identity. You've been warned.PS The librarian wanted me to inform you your 30 mins of computer use is up."
"this price movement is scared retail investors running away, while big boys are stacking cheap before the takeoff, seen it way too many times before"
Tomorrow we will see if Alibaba is profitable or if it needs to file for Chapter 11 bankrupcy.
"Ok, longs, done my homework tonight..reply as many as I can, stay strong!"
Buffet Calls this a fair price for a great company. Actually it is not just a fair price it is a bargain at this price. I bet WB is loading BABA this morning
"Folks, fwit, here is a picture of Jack in today's SCMP at Alibaba's Family Day ... I guess the CCP is letting him out of the cage more ... man oh man, I wish he would have shut his mouth back then (Yahoo keeps deleting this message, this is my last try at showing Jack's mug)https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2021/05/13/47526f9e-b394-11eb-93b7-03206dd91175_972x_231806.jpg"
"I totally agree with this statement below.Baba is a 400 usd stock, mention a pe of 20…..Never seen such a fraud and market ignorance.Even Charlie munger is a buyer and ken fisher one the biggest experienced greta investor.Expected earnings for this year (2022, which started on first of April 2021) is 11 USD. This gives us a current PE of 20.5! This is with low estimate of only 11USD profit and not reducing the enterprise value with the cash position of 70 Billion USD. Reduced with the cash position the PE would be 18.2, insanely low and certainly undervalued."
$BABA Target Lowered by Citigroup Buy USD 338 » USD 306 Target Lowered by Benchmark Positive » Buy USD 310 » USD 285 Target Lowered by KeyBanc Overweight USD 305 » USD 275Maintains KeyBanc Overweight USD 305 » USD 275
"When old man Charlie invested in BABA, I was telling people he meant to buy BA but seeing double. Anyway, much respect to the wise man. At 97 he is still teaching us about risk and investing where there is no risk there is no gain."
"Where are all my ""BRAINIAC FRIENDS "" on here today ????? Have not heard a Peep out of them !!!!!!!! Baba continues to go down in value as we speak !!! Getting closer to $210.00 a share ! Just as reminder , to all those ""know it all's on here , that is $ 100.00 Dollars less than what I sold all of my BABA shares at $310.00 a while ago !!!!!! I'm so happy I dumped Baba when I did , I also told everyone at that time to do the Same !!!!!!!"
"Good article on Motley Fool ""3 Cathie Wood Stocks That Warren Buffett Would Love"" (Yahoo won't let me post the link) ... was notable that Ark has a major position in Baba ... Munger + Wood = Helpful Catalysts!"
And again volume begins to dwindle to be followed by another step down in price action. You have been warned.
"not the best idea I've heard. there are a lot of stocks that go up and have been going for a year. seems questionable to wait for a ""big kill"" on something like this. watching as others pass you bye"
240-245 with low volume. 245+ with high volume. My prediction for today
"After paying the 2.8 Billion fine, Baba will still have over $360 BILLION in CASH on its balance sheet. This is VERY POSITIVE and I think this is going to start a run towards $300/share."
High Tide is coming
Shorts got lucky and had a chance to cover today. High volume block trades end of day. Its only going up from hereConsider this a warning.
"Gap closing , time to buy back in !"
The river card just got dealt and I’m going all in.
I read that Alibaba is in talks to buyout Wish again.That would be great.
"Excellent entry point on BABA with the double bottom, and on triple support level. The moat of BABA can only grow from here as the consumption of China is rebounding strongly. US has many cloud players, China only have Baba and Tencent. It is a hugh cloud market. Not to mention payment, Media, etc."
"Why every stock I own are falling so hard? Is it just me? $BABA, $SQ, $DKNG, $RKT, $AMD ....I am a sore loser."
The call is going GREAT!!
"Well Folks I guess that SMART investor on this site , named JOSEPH , was right about BABA again !!!!!! I wonder if he ever gets tired of WINNING all the time ??????????????"
We may looking at an amazing earning but with not much price actions? Anything less than amazing will tank this further
"China Holiday, BABA had one of the biggest sales day. $235-240 coming tomorrow."
Earnings in 13 may. Sooner than expected that’s good!
"Why do Chinese companies go to the US stock market if they do not get any benefits, even they are treated very badly. The whole list of Chinese companies will be at 52 weeks low as opposed to US companies which are 52 week high. This is just my observation, BABA at such growth and income should be a minimum of $ 400- $ 500 or more."
"Not expecting any earnings pop, based on history. Regardless, I am holding for the long-term since I like the risk-return profile. I don't want to hold too much cash earning nothing or losing to inflation, and I definitely don't want to hold mega cap US tech after the run its had. Let the JimmyZzzzs of the world play with their used undies and their imaginary short shares while I sleep peacefully knowing the CCP will allow BABA and Tencent to be the face of the China duopoly. Jack Ma's divorce from the company, ANT Financial finally being floated as a public co, and the enormous cloud growth in the yrs ahead in a closed-to-American-tech environment will be our tailwinds heading into 2022."
We had 19 red days in last 23 tradings day. Now it's time for 19 green days.
Worst is over...
We all know Alibaba was deeply discounted. This is easily a $300 dollar stock. Would not be surprised to see BABA have a quick runnup to at least $300 within the next few months. Remember Baidu doubled its stock value in less than 3 months recently.
"40% of your portfolio is too much, esp for a stock with this high a BETA. EVEN TOO high a percentage for an industry in general, let alone one stock. I am also bullish on BABA, and have been long for a few years, but I would seriously consider diversifying."
"Green in a red market while there is no news, bullish sign."
I covered my all shorts. Too much money struck. I am not interested in pennies. It's very good profit..but
Even if earnings are awesome does it really matter? Market wants to tank
If we close 250 or higher tomorrow I’ll buy a slurpie for everyone in 711 down the road from me.
"Macd Week Cross AlreadyIts will bullish momentum next weekFirst target, 250 275 320 ATHNot optimistic, chart showing that :)"
Unbelievable there’s no reports about China digital currency connects to Alipay on Yahoo fin.
180 is coming. I have said it over and over.
All clear to baba opening tomorrow 235 to the moon
Baba down 24% in the last six months while the market is in the biggest Bull market of our lifetime. Being long Baba is a regret you will have to live with for the rest of your life.
Yahoo says 8 days to earnings call ! I think we will be back to 245 by then .
"China continues heading into troubled waters. After you're left holding your bag, you may take a serious interest in the news. However, judging by the shareholders here, I doubt it."
perfect buy point
What is earnings date?
It has been tanking down big time pushing more lower lows. Almost 1/3 of BABA price have been slashed in 6 months. Even it announced good earnings still slides down as if no ending.
"Nasdaq , S and p , Dow jones all went up today !!!!!!!!! HOORAY !!!!!!!!!! Hold it !!!! BABA SHAREHOLDERS ( BAGHOLDERS ) their money went down again today !!!!!!! SORRY FOLKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
300 by Friday
"Why did BABA change earnings release date earlier? Found this in a Forbes (research) article from their research over two years ago very interesting: ￼Bad news travels fast, but according to research, not for corporate earnings calls. Researchers at the University of Texas and MIT have discovered hidden information contained in when exactly companies chose to schedule their quarterly earnings releases. If a company schedules its earnings much earlier than normal, then earnings are often better than expected and share price gains typically follow."
CNBC spoke at length how good Aliababa is as a Company and mentioned the upgrade by GS but missed hearing about JPM. So need to verify that before I post.
"Next week Alibaba will trade about 220 USD210 strike call option, and a jump above 220 for profit taking"
6 week’s to earnings Cloud  expansion Ant  newsCar  announcement {possible}Fine  charge not implicating earnings All graphs 3yr 1yr ... all set to implode
They had some interesting insights about BABA on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Cheapest big tech out there, with massive growth potential and huge markets, nice new initiatives, and Rev growth even starting now with cloud in Asia... This is a 2 trillion usd company, all in for the long term, epic annual return, and even Charlie munger of berkshire buying! Best deal in this market ALL IN"
My allocation is currently:90% in 9988 (Alibaba listed in HK)5% in DADA (logistics)5% in ZEPP (health watch)Today made a transaction to cut half my DADA in favour of ZEPP. To have a bit more balance on my speculation.Alibaba is a solid company with good diversification and high free cash flow.
By far my most frustrating stock but ain‘t gonna sell it 
Going to buy some calls today and will sell those at 235+.
$BABA $WIMI $NFLX Buying cheap is the best way to invest. Always stay where there are fewer people
Need to see this close over $210.. way too cheap under that
"bought more shares today, good luck everybody"
The list of excuses/rationalizations for the price decline and predictions for a recovery in the stock are all too familiar. This EPS miss on higher than expected rev means margin compression and a re-rating of the stock by analysts. Expect the PT and EPS numbers to come down further.

BABA is a must to have in your portfolio. China will be the biggest economy in the world sooner or later. Exposure to Chinese stocks is a must. $XPEV $BABA
Under 200 by Friday !! Watch it out--$7-8 earnings for Chinese junk means 90-100 at max. No audit--they lie a lot.
It's going to earn $7-8 @ max. By Chinese standards that's calling for 12-13 PE n fair price 84-89. I am generous for 137.
"If the anti monopoly probe is complete, then this is a bullish sign. Baba will move up nicely."
273$ EOW my very conservative target price considering what happened the previous time we were in 220s
You'd better sell while there are still some bids.
"BABA to enter EV market, should announce soon..."
Expecting a P/E ratio of 19 on Friday.At a 25% revenue growth this is an easy 5x on the next 5 years.Be smart 
finishing even slightly Green on a Red day in Nasdaq would be a good first step.
I am long but unfortunately there is an EPS miss and operating income miss. Costs increased somehow.
Ha ha told ya so. Commies took all the profits. Never invest in Communism.
"To BABA investors: the latest months could be hard for some, but every big companies, all the FAANG have been in the same situation before everybody realized that they were real cash cow. If you invested in AAPL in 2012 at 24$, you were truly disappointed in 2013 when it fell to 16$ or 33%, but if you were confident enough that the earnings would continue to grow for the next decade, you are now holding shares 6x (127$/share right now) your initial investment in 2012, which is not so bad. Here is the same with a company that look ready to grow as much as Apple for the next decades sss(at least 2). And when the the market will be saturated, they will slow down there investment and start buying more shares, which will contribute to continue there ascent, just like Apple again. I think BABA is a 10x bagger if you stay for the next 20 years. Plus, you got that cash cow, with massive moat in a country with almost 5x US population and technology growth at a ridiculous price (comparable to an oil company). China CCP is not only bad, it also avoid other companies to get in the country, which is a really good news considering that BABA is the biggest play in China right now. You maybe bought BABA at 310$, but you can still sell it more than 3000$ in 20 years, or 1000$ in 10 years. Cloud, retail, grocery, entertainment, autonomous, EV, find the best way to make money and BABA is already doing it in a country growing faster than all the world! Congrats to longs, see you in 10-20 years on the « playa »!!!"
no matter how bad it gets for us BABA holders..at least its not as bad as PLTR holders.. rip PLTR
this is a complete bargain
This will be 210 by Wednesday
"I just want to remind all you who are JEALOUS of me , that , you could have done the same as me and dumped Baba at $310.00 !!! But, you chose to Mock and make fun of me instead !!!!!! Only, one Decent Person on this site , thanked me for my good insight's concerning BABA shares !!!!!!! ONLY ONE !!!!!!! Well, I guess one is better than none !!!!!!!"
Back to $300+
This is the only stock that could tank 6-10% by lowering its P/E
10 days to earnings ! i wouldn’t want to be short!
I was right again !!!!!!!!! It's headed towards $210.00 a share !!!!!!!!! only $ 11.00 dollars more to go !!!!!!!
China's economy grew a record 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year.
"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day! This fraudulent ""no need to work"" policy of the US Government will END TERRIBLY very soon!

Ignore the Great and Wonderful Jimmy Z at your own peril.You are warned.
This jumping well above Short term ranges & holding; if keeping above % gains daily HK movement positive momentum
"Berkshire doesn't own many non-US shares, so chances they bought Baba shares are slim, but Buffett just mentioned they've bought shares of some new companies they think are great (didn't want to name them yet). Who knows.."
This is bizzare
BABA should be delisted so it will end the misery of its bag holders for good
Maybe someday Bloomberg will have something better to report then the 2.6 billion fine Alibaba got￼
Start owning your stock China. Figuratively and Literally. US is dictating the price from the looks of it.
5 houses lowered PT today although maintaining buys
What's going on BABA - Alibaba Group Holding Limited? Source: http://snd.qlitrk.com/r/hnpks
This will end green today
$380 by end of july!
"Every shareholder knows the risks of Alibaba. Don't think any shareholder is shocked by the outcome of the investigation. In contrary, many are relieved and were hoping for this. My feeling says we will see a nice plus on monday and end this month at 260 or higher."
BABA is going under 230 agin and again 
"Ok it seems we have a bottom now around 220. Stock will move slightly up, takes time and patience but hold tight and enjoy the ride up. End of summer could be around 300 again."
"I m adding, total irrational"
My sources are advising the long awaited delisting gets closer by the day. YIIPPEEEE!!!Heed the warning.
I remember the future oil could drop to negative. But I'm so sure Baba will rebound to 300 someday.
 BABA 
I just want to see baba go to the moon but its launches always fail :(
"Anyone who’s been holding through the down days and been accumulating ever since, congrats to you. Smart investors understand how undervalued Baba is :)"
"Those who hold BABA, patient pays off, BABA will rally soon as soon as Buffett most likely will be jumping in."
BABA sp will increase much more when it joins the HK stock connect. Hope the announcement will be out this year. And that’s when we can have a big celebration; just imagine the number of Chinese from mainland China waiting to buy BABA stock !
$250 by end of May!Enjoy the short squeeze next week longs!!
"She moves... slowly, but she moves..."
Calls are still nearly as cheap as the day before the 10% rise.
Love that they are doing more investments. Should mean big time long term growth.
Wow !!!!!! Baba just went up $ .25 cents !!!!!!! Yeah !!!!! Now I can go out and buy a Quarter of a CANDY BAR !!!!!!
Any thoughts about possible catalysts? My feeling says the whole sector simply need no news about antitrust investigations for a while.
Alibaba shareholders in a few months from now:
"Too bad for BABA shareholders !!! There is more Suffering and Anguish coming soon ,since more downward pricing pressure in the future ! SELL !!!"
"baba hong kong opens up 8%, currently at 6%."
"Until the Blackrock money manager is fired or wakes up and realizes that selling the fastest growing tech in the fastest growing economy at a 30% discount isn't the best idea, i have little faithThey have 80m shares valued at 20B and have been selling daily since October"
"Baba last six months has been punished for all the wrong reason. It has lost $216 B in market cap. It's very attractive at present levels, it will be +10 tomorrow. It will dip only if the indexes collapse again."
Nice additional UPWARD move by BABA (and the HSI) after lunch. Bodes well for tomorrow and into earnings.
Options chains.Big funds -> they write options -> they will make sure options chains expire worthless.Friday is convinient because that is usually a low liquidity day.
After Hours trading up over 1%. Looks like another big run for BABA tomorrow at the opening bell.
"The 2.8b fine is already priced in guys, don't get manipulated by the premarket numbers!"
"Let's just assume the forward PE ratio stays this historically low forever. Then, since earnings grow with double digits for years to come, you will have great double digit yearly returns! But, in reality the forward PE will increase as sentiment improves, so your returns will be even sweeter!"
"FANG’s sell off, BAT’s {BAIT w/IQ} now trend. it took a while we are priced well above BIDU; Time for this baby to surpass FB￼ price"
"Feeling good about my amd and Facebook.Now it’s your turn baba, make me proud."
"Expectations were high but the company did great with strong growth and very nice predictions for this year (30% growth). Unfortunately a little less profit but no big disaster, especially long term. Weak hands are shaken out, but Stock is oversold and will move up soon. Good luck all, all newcomers have the possibility to buy the shares for a bargain."
Last quarter's estimated YOY revenue growth is now 68.20% (source: Yahoo Finance).
"Still, Currently, BABA is the 5th best favorite among Hedge funds. Dwelling on what happened is the most stupid thing. calper's news was leaked on Friday and those quick stupids sold some shares, so BABA was down on Friday, but considering that other similar stocks like Tencent and others also were down like BABA, so the news was treated as old news. The calper's thing simply explains why BABA was down in 1st quarter so big. That's it, it is time to move on. One of the key properties of hedge funds is its excellence in contrarian action. Time to be act like a contrarian with the hedge fund excellence."
Hang Seng Index and HK BABA down.....Completely shaken off in NY. This should clarify who follows who.
buy amazon of USA and sleep good at night and enjoy amazing long term compounding gains
"I think Institutional Holders and Mutual Fund Holders are driving the price down prior to ER,"
Bloomberg speaks of a 58% expected revenue growth by the way.
"$238,94 / share I bought small position today. If it drops to 227-232 I will add again, and at 220 I go max long."
"Three Green Days in a ROW, been a long time plus $7.64...let's go for our fourth tomorrow !"
Is anyone meeting up with @josephs wife today or is she free? I have a big load brewing and I don’t want to waste it....she’s always willing to take it.
Is the downward pressure we’ve seen for MONTHS purely based on investors fear of commie regulation? I see no red flag financially.
"Enjoying the buy back at the end of the session bous ! Bye shorties , this will carry on in Asia !"
Company is doing great. Revenue is going up. Who cares about news and noise around.
"(1) people become used to regulatory news and (2) there simply is a decreasing amount of regulatory news. There is some unfinished business such as Ant and media assets, but for the biggest part it is DONE. People can start to become rational again."
Smart investors adding in this levels. Most people want to be wealthy....yesterday... it doesn't work this way.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Fairstox.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
BABA is as cheap today as it was June 2018... if you don't recognize this 'gift horse' you might want to take up a day job.
This is a big brain play ma dudes
"Bershire has been at the same price for 5 years from 2007 to 2012 then pop again after to 3 times its 2012 price. BABA will be growing much faster then Bershire, but we can’t predict short term price. I can only say I will be very proud of me in 10 years with my shares!"
Today it is likely a good opportunity to add long positions in Alibaba especially for those with a longer term hold. I expect 221.xx USD to hit. Goodluck my friends.
"if Baba up 50% after opening from earning, what about shorts? we need to protect them also."
Under 200 by next Friday !! Journey has just started. Margin calls being issued.
"Maybe down on monday, maybe not. But this stock will fly in coming weeks."
Can I hear a 210 anyone? Lol
"NYSE closed at $244.01 = $236.44 HK. Currently HK is $235.80, so appears that tonight they will revert to their traditional pattern of following NYSE and not leading like their amazing effort last night. SP should move up in a more measured way from here on in, and that’s fine!"
I want to switch all my shares into Microsoft which is more reliable
Pretty new to investing. Can someone explain me why pre-market rate is lower than the at close rate of yesterday? Does that predict something? Thanks a lot.
"New sheriff in town.Guys, pull up a 5 yr, monthly chart and plot the typical MAs. BABA is still in a long term bull mkt.Then pull up a YTD chart. With a the bad news and doubts, BABA is clearly showing a basing. The best bases are built during many months, not days. BaBA is a cash machine with cheap debt, and in a country that is embracing tech like no other. China pushing hard into crypto with the digital yuan (CBDC) will only aid tech Titans BABA and Tencent as more Chinese citizens fund it easier to get online funnel.monet into the system. Ant as a traditional bank holding company and arm of the CCP will benefit."
Be honest. Who would actually dare to short baba at this price? I want to meet the brave soul who would put in the order like that
"If this ever does run up to $220, to be honest I'm selling and looking to play swing trades. Of course this stock has incredible fundamentals, but it can't hold any gains what-so-ever!"
Low volume. Low volume. None of this weak upside move will mean much until we get more volume. Volume is a better indicator of movement (up or down) right now than news reports
"This is an excerpt from investors business daily article that just came out today_ just goes to show that even the editors don’t know exactly what they are talking about; the article actually says when they report earnings after the close when most people, if not all know that it’s Thursday morning before the close- here it is: ￼ continues to deliver strong earnings and sales growth. Some might argue that all the bad news is priced into Alibaba (BABA). But is BABA stock a buy with earnings due Thursday after the close?"
Accumulation phase. I need to wait up to 4 months before a large amount of cash is accumulated to buy shares again. Maybe in 1-2 months. Anything below 227 USD I will be a buyer.
"The best thing any longs can do for themselves right now would be to stay away from these chat rooms and any silly ridiculous Reuters or Zacks articles until earnings on 5/20. We all know recovery is coming then. Actually it's likely to start before then because any short sellers with a fraction of common sense will not want to risk holding short coming up to earnings. Hang tight, block the noise, and stay disciplined. Don't let trolls on here sway you from a very smart long-term investment."
Bloomberg states we will have to wait for the opening for the price reaction but speculates this news conference was positive for the company and probably the stock price opening up.
Let's hope we will never see 220s again.
"+10% tomorrow..... just look at every other stock that is levied a fine. Short the rumor, buy the news."
Alibaba shares on sale now. Looking for a better price? 223 USD (+-1%)
Looking great in HK
Honk Kong pre-market appears to be for indices only. There is NO pre-market trading in BABA in Hong Kong!!!
"Record Economic mimic data , Retail sales in China + 34% , I love my Chinese stocks ! Too many bashers is a good sign ! Buy and hold !"
"Looks like another down day for BABA shareholders !!! The rest of the Markets are going UP , UP and AWAY !!!!"
"Stayed out for a day, seeing so many shorts pump out, please read the ER and tell me which item is negative to you and deserves 7% sell off in one day...30% off from its high? Buy buy buy!!! And sleep like baby at night, this is life time opportunity, we back to 18 price while triple the growth"
Lower than the xmas eve closeWowThis stock is beyond broken
What a bargain this is! It ticks all my boxes.Finically healthy: checkCapable management: checkGreat business model: checkGrowing EPS: checkUndervalued: check
Buy and hold BABA and you be very happy.
I don't think Baba can even get up to $.99 cents Today !!!!!!!!!! Do you ???????????
"BABA PPS 2030: >1000$. That is all I need to predict to jump in the boat! It’s maybe or maybe not the best investment for 2021, but it is one of the best for the decade to come. Cloud computing is the key and China is a close market. 5 x US population, middle class growing fast, regulation is done, biggest player with real moat at a real discount, I really don’t care about Joseph or others shorts on this board! GLTA longs!"
load up for a technical bounce next week to $230.
Do yourselves a favor and sell all your shares of Baba at the Monday morning open !!!! You will thank me for doing that !!!!!!!!!!!
Estimated revenue growth (YoY) last quarter is 68.40%!
Don't listen to the shorts even if BABA drops below 200 I will average down. I want to know what will happen to them when the margin calls will be coming in.
"Upvote for today higher than 230, downvote for today lower than 230."
$WIMI $TSLA $BABA DON’T MISS OUT ON THE DOGE TRIP TO THE MOON
Getting hammered because of the anti-trust fine. They aren't going to have an anti-trust fine every quarter.
Loading up!!
Next stop $220
What they are saying about Jimmy Z....
Why does this under perform other chinese tech some days but over perform on other days? Most china tech green today. Alibaba more popular in the etfs being sold off?
"CFRA's top reason for downgrading BABA to a $198 target, was the delisting risk. That's precisely what happens when a rumor like that floats around without resolution. They know very well BABA will not be delisted...And if they didn't, they are just plain stupid. These rumors have been out there for years, and are more centered on clear cut abusers...not BABA and BIDU. But these financial institution use this continued ""uncertainty"" to move the stock radically...in a way that benefits themselves and their ""exclusive"" clientele, and chases out small retail. They have been setting traps on these stocks for about a year....The SEC should investigate! But they won't.....In my humble view"
"Setting up for a solid close.... The run has begun. Once it gets going, it's going to really take off"
I feel like such a BAGHOLDER......
Look at the comments below! You people actually thought Baba was going to be up big today because of the pre-market! And then it went bust INSTANTLY! INSTANTLY!
"ANT IPO announcement must be near, the fine is now known and and lower hit than expected.all lined up for ANT payout!"
miracle closed in green
Hard to bash CFRA when they downgraded it months ago and they were right. The stock fell just like they said.
Anyone know where the bottom on this is? 160 - 180? Thinking to buy.
"""According to my charts , Baba will be down AGAIN AT THE Market open!!!!"" - Joseph (17 hours ago)."
"Still green , after US CPI data ! all good !!!!"
It's time.
"no profit, no dividend"
You guys think this is bottom?
"Hey, guys, what does the Barrons article say in a nutshell? has anybody read it? Just don't want to pay for subscription, haha."
Up while the main indices are down. Let's see if the shorts are able to take over at the end of the session.
Imagine selling/shorting one of the most undervalued growth stocks after Charlie Munger bought along with PT from multiple firms above 300. Yeah... seems real logical
large investment institutions are holding this stock in a range to unload as many shares as possible to retail buyers before they do another engineered selloff like last Xmas eve. When will the next Xmas eve take place ? probably another holiday when everyone is absent from the markets.
"Institutions will add more in coming weeks, shorters will cover and FOMO kicks in. Reasons enough to make more profit."
"As of today, BABA should be $ 500- $ 600 rather than $ 200. That must be a joke."
"Some system will auto buy Alibaba in larger quantities when 240 / 250 / 260 / 270 gets hit. The higher it goes, the more sticky it will become over time."
Fight fight fight!

"I regret not having more money to buy more today.Anyway, we are heading towards a 300.Good luck to yall"
"Looks like Baba shares having a last Gasp , before it declines to $210.00 soon !!! Enjoy , these few hours , until Baba declines again !!!!!!!!!!"
Coming off their lows already. Should close green.
amazon of china. holding on long term--5+yr horizon
"The shorts here are not even shorts. They have no position. Like Sonic says below, guys like JimmyZzzz are on here simply for attention. Looking at his history he has been wrong too many times to even have a nickel to his name. But we do love the real shorts, the institutional shorts. Once they start covering, the rise will be all that sweeter. You have been warned, neanderthals.PS You definitely want nerds on your side. It's the digital age, and who better to have on your side fighting your battles than these guys:"
They still managed 11.3% growth compared to same quarter last year with their huge fine.
So ‘Fast Money’ episode makes this move....
"The main thing is that GME is up, who hasn't seen the money yet. This is the whole Wall Streat parody"
BABA up in HongKong equavalent to US $ 230.57http://www.etnet.com.hk/www/tc/stocks/realtime/quote_chart_interactive.php?code=9988
"Susquehanna Capital issued a Buy on Baba today, PT $350"
in for 10 @ 213.40
"Doesn’t look good, even earnings beat, I think it’s still goes down, bad may market"
"Never thought I would say this, but would be very satisfied if we reach 210s today and move back to 220s next week. Don't want to stay this low for long."
Not worry at all. Sentiment can change very fast and then everyone will rush buying.
worse than expected eps was reported by the china communist company
"Bitcoin money is exiting. It will flow into companies making real money with real business that is growing. Top pick is Baba as the best value growth stock with lots of cash in the warchest, no debt and will rise and beat inflation by a long stretch."
"BABA, past 5 years, +176%. Not bad at all."
shorties are sweating lol
One good word on Ant and this is back to $300
No volume no volume no volume.Needs to change to leg up
PE Ratio of 25 reflects an amazing value at these price levels. Can't wait 'til the next ER!
"translation from China daily: The monopoly case of Alibaba Group, which has attracted much attention from the society, has been resolved: On April 10, the State Administration of Market Supervision imposed administrative penalties on Alibaba Group in accordance with the law, ordered it to stop illegal activities, and imposed a 4% sales amount of 18.228 billion in 2019. Yuan fine. This punishment is a specific measure taken by the regulatory authorities to strengthen anti-monopoly and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital. It is an effective standard for illegal activities of platform companies. It does not mean denying the important role of the platform economy in the overall economic and social development. It means that the state's attitude to support the development of the platform economy has changed, but it is necessary to adhere to the equal emphasis on development and regulation, grasp the law of platform economic development, establish and improve the platform economic governance system, and promote the healthy and sustainable development of the platform economy."
I am #$%$ at this turn of events. Fundamentals don?t mean anything here.
Closed +1.97% in HK - will accelerate today!
baba is not a regular conglomerate as it is controlled by the Chinese government. eventually the company will be delighted in US as it won't be able to sec regulations and baba will be regulated company not for profit company
What if Jimmy Z is actually a nice swell guy and he’s just been trying to warn us this whole time for our own good? 
"Baba has what they call in the trade,"" Downward Momentum"" !!!!!!!!! It's going to keep on going down over the next few months !!!!!!"
"$JD $BABA $NIO $XPEV Don't be missing out on this live-media E-commerce company launching an in-car solution with Nio and Xpev as potential partners, (rumored)"
"Quitte Some volume after hours, almost 1 million shares traded."
BABA indicated 8.5% higher in China! The fine is a pittance compared to the cash flow.
You will not make money !!!
"Baba can't even go up ONE DOLLAR today !!!! And , you call this going to the moon !!!!!! What a joke ???"
yes i am long . i take a lot of losses here it seems that this stock are strong manipulate by china haters.whats the point of being right but loss my money when are we going to see strong upside
THIS IS GREAT  FOR BABA ITS ALSO GOOD  TIME TO BUY NIO
"If this dips below 220 today, it’ll be the lowest price since Christmas Eve... the very morning after they announced the anti-monopoly investigation in the first place."
"Picked up more shares and calls (Jan 2022 300) today at avg of 226.8. Moving my total cost basis down so thank you weak hands. Sorry JimmyZzzz (who predicted 3yrs ago BABA would fall to $100) and other trolls and shorts, this is a long-term play for us bulls. And we'll more than happily accumulate on weakness.Mostly in cash (now 79%) and looking to deploy more in mainly BABA (also Tencent)."
Both Barrons (a right wing pub owned by Rupert Murdoch) and Reuters writing articles suggesting China's move into digital currency will hinder ANT and in turn BABA....why? According to this article ANT has been testing the digital currency for the PBOC and will be integrated into its future plans....how is this harmful...thanks
"HUGE finish at the end for BABA AND some very good technicals breached: 1) BABA closed above its March high of 242.79 2) BABA closed above its 50 day SMA 3) there was very strong resistance between 240 and 242 which was broken and finally 4) trading volume was enormous. Now this may appear to be nitpicking, but these were all very crucial technical levels that had to be breached. Now BABA needs to hold and trade above these levels for a few days. I wouldn't be surprised to see an initial sell off tomorrow morning BUT if BABA fights back to these levels, it'll all be positive. So hang in there people. I'm long BABA and just before BABA corrected a few weeks ago, I bought the July 16 300 calls and I thought this was dead money but today those options are now about 9% down instead of 60% down. If we get during the week another move like today, I'll be a very happy camper!!!"
"I am holding Baba for since 2019, guys, all you need is to stay patience and good luck to all of you!"
When will Ant finally go public and BABA goes to $500 ... the price where it belongs ... way undervalued
Charlie Munger will be the biggest buyer on Monday!!
"Funny that the western media remains so negative about China tech companies and Alibaba in particular with China attacking their monopolies etc. I would assume the CCP won’t be happy with this negative attention for their biggest tech firms and do something positive about it, especially with all Chinese stock prices down and American stock prices at records. They could for instance report something positive about constructive dialogues between them and the tech companies in the Daily Journal (their medium). I don’t believe they are happy with reduced stock prices, only thing they want is power and loyalty from these big firms. Which they already have assured with the fine for Alibaba. Western media is to negative at the moment, they mis the bigger picture in my opinion."
Looking good 240 today
"Is anyone concerned with the high ""Share-based compensation expense"" that Alibaba issues every quarter?"
"Even recently, the Average S& P index funds are beating Baba's performance over the last three years !!!!! Why be in such a risky stock like Baba , when you can be safe and sound in an Index 500 fund of 100% USA companies !!! ( That even pays nice dividends ) Why take all that risk with your hard earned money ????"
"Started adding option positions here at 229.6. Focusing on Jan 2022 calls, 300 strike.Original position is in stock."
Every BitCoin holder also own BABA !! Looks true..margin calls next week !!
"It’s official, we closed below the closing price on Christmas Eve day, which we all thought was an absolute anomaly low at the time. I normally try to stay patient and optimistic, but this is looking really, really bad"
"RED pre-market makes no sense, I am buying at 212, please fall down a couple of $"
"I have a small position in BABA and holding a small loss. What worries me isn't the earnings, it's Taiwan. If China invades Taiwan; I don't believe the US will go to war over it. It would be a losing battle. Therefore, the US will have to sanction China. The US may need to sanction China even if they don't invade Taiwan; as China will continue to use strong arm tactics. So my question to my esteemed fellow investors is:1.) Will the sanctions include dropping BABA from the US stock market?2.) Will China invade Taiwan?What do you think?"

"Everybody knows Charlie Munger is conservative and cautious (And old). So if he believes in BABA, AND is not worried about any uncertainty......You can take it to the bank!"
Bought more at 214.06 lucky me.

"Looking forward to the earnings release. I don’t really care about the price actiin tomorrow. If it rises, great. If it drops, also fine, I’ll add even more shares at these already insanely cheap levels. Have fun all :)"
"Alibaba will publish even better results than FAANG as China was already battling COVID last year whilst the Western world was still fully operational. Indeed, all qestimations I can find point to a very large growth in EPS and revenue."
"Honestly, I would like to see a stronger push upwards now considering how well everything else is pushing."
"Wow, that close just set us up for even more of a rally. Great day longs."
Hoping for even more seeing Nasdaq going up

This is the best outcome. Finally!
All the hype stocks making little to no profit getting crushed today Baba holding strong tho
Finally! the road is clear now for baba to move up! I guess Charlie munger knew something we didn’t
"Like someone highlighted the fine is equal to 1 usd a share ! We dropped 40 usd a share based on uncertainty, well priced in !"
"Expected earnings per share 2021 = 10-11$ Meaning the current P/E is only 20-22. Considering most big tech crushed estimates, and Baba probably will at least top estimates, it is probably much lower. That is really cheap! I think we’ve really touched bottom now."
Current PE ratio of about 20. Worse than an oil company and Alibaba is a tech.

"I was VERY SMART to sell all my shares of BABA at $310.00 !!!!!!! I also, told everyone on here at that time to do the same!!!! What did people here do ?????? They Mocked and made Fun of me !!! Calling me names I , as a GENTLEMAN can't repeat on here , since I am a MAN of Integrity !!!!!!!"
Very low volume today and yesterday. Not necessarily a bad thing because the price hasn't changed all that much. But be wary of the fact that low volume makes this extremely susceptible to catalysts and news. I would avoid any short term options on this one for a bit and stick with long stock
"People love selling on zero news it’s hilarious, losers sell on red days"
I keep reminding myself JPM estimates are $350 HK and sure Charlie is not selling. We always go down on earnings day good or bad. We will bounce back !
"At a triple bottom. I believe we push higher today into earnings but if we break to downside, watch out below"
"This stock has been a complete disaster. However, on the other hand, at this point, BABA may have 75-100% upside from here over the next 1-2 years."
"JD, PDD and Tencent will have similar fines shortly. They can't just fine BABA and let others go scot-free"
"I know CFRA is negative on BABA for political reasons but their fair value calc tells a different story:Fair Value Calculation USD $407.40Analysis of the stock’s current worth, based on CFRA’sproprietary quantitative model suggests that BABA isundervalued by USD 175.32 or 75.54%"
"9988 moving North while HSI moves South ... that shows buy-conviction in a very skittish HK market ... if Volume stays strong to end of session, it will be a good NYSE day tomorrow ahead of ER on Thursday"
"Read Woods comments on fintech, payments, etc. Specifically says Ant is one of the biggest and best. They (Alibaba) are making so much money, and will eventually IPO. This is not including any other investments Baba has, OR their cloud, and sales platforms. Extremely undervalued!!! Who you going to believe Benjo, Jimmy, or Munger.  Don't take my word for it...."
This stock was manipulated down to line some pockets later. Trust me though this will be above 300 in less than 2 years if not a year
"This is the market rotation to inflation protected equities. Tomorrow CPI data should be released, the market anticipates bad data."
"I suspect BABA will have an earnings beat. Last similar situation was in June 2018 which lasted for 6 months. Right now this situation has lasted for 6 months, CCP regulation situation is coming to an end, they already got their fines, things are becoming very dangerous for shorts both on a fundamental and technical level."
I wonder who is selling at this price...
What are the news? For this spike
9 days red in a row...
"Why is the sale so organized, because someone wants to buy cheap. Don't be surprised when BABA will be $ 225 on Monday"
Would be great to regain the 220 level this week

Alibaba. from the same great country that brought you covid 19. Wonderful
This action seems really really sketchy.

"Today makes it official !!!!!!!!! If you held BABA shares for one full year today , you made ZERO in EARNINGS !!!!!!!!!!"
Concerted media effort to bash Chinese stocks. The fear is palpable.
"I'm not the most sophisticated investor, so a little honest feedback would be appreciated. This company appears to make a ridiculous amount of money. Is the relatively low P/E because of the Chinese government?"
"BABA's stock price will most likely trade in a small range until earnings at the end of this month. After earnings, the stock will trend upward with corporate guidance and recent CCP compliance. Over 20 analysts view BABA as a strong buy. Average price target is $312. You are long for a reason. Patience will payoff big time with this stock."
"market red, BABA green: good signal, this stock should skyrocket soon"
"good time to accumulate below 240. Over time the political stuff always blows over, and its back to fundamentals. The large fund managers then disclose that they have accumulated a blue chip at low, low prices and become heroes. I remember BAC at $5-$7 only 10 years ago."
I am baba bull.but love Jimmy Z's passion and dedication to this stock lol
To be honest I’m a bit suspicious of the US pricing of BABA. When Hong Kong closed on April 1st it ended at $225.6 which is in HKD currency. The correlation I saw with the Hong Kong price was if it ended $225 our price would be around $233.I wonder if big banks took advantage of the chinese holiday to instill more fear in retail investors to sell.It’s a bit suspicious. If BABA goes up before Hong Kong opening. It will confirm this Bias I have.
Trusting Charlie munger even more come May earnings call now
"Great news! Finally the uncertainty is over. Yes, fine is big, but is small for a company of that size! The stock price is cheap, it may lower tomorrow but is good news, fines are good, many people was expecting a more severe penalty!!"
"I hold baba shares and quite frankly have been disappointed, a lot of longs chant about it being cheap all the time, how about buying it on the uptrend instead of down one, like when it hits 250"
Just a bunch of noise.
If I lose another 10% in my portfolio I lose all the gains from last year :(
"The worst is over with. $2.8 Billion to Don Xi , and we can get $100B in market cap. There was no way out for Xi other than to ""appear"" hard on BABA, but still a historic fine of $2.8B clears the worst hangover. I read somewhere that Apr 16 bullish calls expecting $260. We might as well cross $260 by end of next week with this out of the way. I hope Berkshire and Munger bought more at this SP, because they are not going to see this price again EVER."
Guess today the bulls proved all the bashers wrong. Tonight we take the loved ones of people like @JimmyZ and @joseph to Pound Town. Congrats
"Direction for any random stock is usually opposit of what retail investors feel. A lot of bullish people here, myself included."
Alibaba should be at least half the price of Tencent eventually if you look at the HongKong price.
"They continue to short the stock but hold your shares, we will prevail and benefit in the long term !"
I have just joined the party and bought BABA. If I look at the relative value vs AMZN it stands out. The current growth rates vs PE are pointing towards bargain territory imo. Yes there are some risks - but I believe these have been more than priced in. Good Luck all.
"Oh god please let the sell off continue in nyse, I need to buy some more"
HK up 5.97% pre market?
Some New names in the chat and I don't see the old ones. Seems like some of them have lost the battle.
"Everything happens for a reason, Baba to the moon. The fine was the last wave, Charlie knew, Joseph,Benjo and Jimmy Z had no clue."
BA and BABA have too much potential to move upside! You will have a better sleep to hold these two stocks
I hope at the open i can grab shares at this discount price!!!pay-tience!!!
What are other reasons big funds are selling?- Certain funds have targets to 3 to 5 times increase the value of their assets in the next 5 years; this is easier achieved with small cap stocks.Some funds are also swing trading Alibaba. Some US funds sold Alibaba between 300 USD and 320 USD to buy back at low 200 USD. They likely have tools at their disposal to read sentiment and moneyflow; just like you.
On 4/1/18 BABA & SHOP were both *181 a share SHOP PE now 462BABA PE now 26Can we at least double stock price from here Charlie...
"So what is going to move is forward if earnings,near resolution of CCP regulatipns and good China economic news wont do the trick? And dont say Ant because that aint happening anytime soon."
Look at pace of sell off today and lack of real interest at 210Not a good sign
Baba is supposed to be a GROWTH STOCK ?????? After Three years it is exactly the same price ????? What kind of Growth is that ?????? Is it Growing SIDEWAYS ???????????? You tell me ?????????
Well....here we go

"I came to realize that their was a lot I didn't know being an American investor owning Chinese equities. I owned Bidu, Tencent, BABA, YY, and momo. I came out with maybe a 15% gain total in 5 years. Many ups and downs. I'm NEVER going to put more than 3-5% in Chinese stocks again. I'm diversified so much better now and much happier."

Excluding that one time charge BABA delivered a positive EPS. Just by paying that one time charge BABA has cleared path to achieve higher revenue and EPS. Check out the outlook people. Don’t get fooled. GL
Cramer says buy baba and coin. Everything he suggests goes to hell
Great time to add
This will take off as uncertainty is removed. Bad news was priced in and a fine is the better alternative to breaking up alibaba. Now they’ll make peace with the government and eventually there will be news of the ANT IPO
Finally green! Is it for real?? Will this trend finally go away?

I thought @joseph said we would crash to $210 today? What happened?
I’m 12 and just invested 10k in baba because my uncle said it was a good buy right now for a long term hold...should I have listened to him?
"Alibaba is a huge company, the current stock price is not the fair value for $BABA"
"So what is the play here with BABA. It drops so low that when earnings are announced it jumps 5% back to what it was before dropping, and everyone gets excited and starts shouting at how great this company is and that its gonna be just upwards from here on out??"

"Just brought another 300 share, missed the 223 mark it was too fast to catch it, lol"
up 64% yoy - this company is a money-making beast !
So BABA is the most undervalued stock in the market now?
"Regardless of arrogance of power on the part of Xi in his heart of hearts he knows that if he destroys the companies that are the face of China it will not be long before foreign companies find friendlier confines. President Xi you must realize when people think of China they think of Baba , Tencent , JD and etc. When they think of the Communist party people think of concentration camps, Uighers, the destruction of freedom in Hong Kong and threats of invasion when it comes to Taiwan, maintain your fig leafs."
"Alibaba's y/e report:https://seekingalpha.com/pr/18316001-alibaba-group-announces-march-quarter-and-full-fiscal-year-2021-resultsFor me, the most important part of that long, long, long report is this portion:Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders was RMB150,308 million (US$22,941 million), and net income was RMB143,284 million (US$21,869 million), which reflected the above-mentioned Anti-monopoly Fine and the increase in share-based compensation expense described in “Income from operations” above. Excluding these impacts and certain other items, non-GAAP net income was RMB171,985 million (US$26,250 million), an increase of 30% year-over-year.Diluted earnings per ADS was RMB54.70 (US$8.35) and diluted earnings per share was RMB6.84 (US$1.04 or HK$8.09), which reflected the above-mentioned Anti-monopoly Fine and the increase in share-based compensation expense described in “Income from operations” above. Excluding these impacts and certain other items, non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS was RMB65.15 (US$9.94), an increase of 23% year-over-year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was RMB8.14 (US$1.24 or HK$9.63), an increase of 23% year-over-year."
"If you are investing for the long term 5-10 years, buy more on the dips and sit back and relax. If you are short term investor just know that the market can stay irrational for a long time..this is why options and margin buying is not recommended."
"Below I read that some people are considering selling BaBa. In my honest opinion I think this really is the bottom and all negative news is priced in at the moment. Fundamentally the company is very healthy with double digit growth in revenue and profit. Cloud business is making a profit since shortly and they are ramping up investments in the food delivery market. Very healthy cash flow, 70 billion USD on cash and 10 billion USD share buyback. This stock just needs 1 positive trigger and it will start flying. Can be earnings or probably a deal with Chinese government or better USA/China relationship, you name it. Some patience would most likely pay of, just don’t get yourself fooled by selling on the bottom. It is exactly what the smart money wants and why they are pushing it down a bit more to let te last retailers surrender by selling their stock. Hold and you will be rewarded. Best of luck."
"Please let me know I am not color blind....GREEN, Yahoo !"
This stock needs sentiment change and a focus on long term prospects
"Who will pay $240.00  on 13 May even Baba reporting 1000% profit for 1 quarter 2021 ? I think people who did that mistake few weeks ago will not repeat it again. Where to find someone who pays $240 again ? You can buy very cheap but disbelief growing fast and you will not sale after with profit....Just my thoughts , nothing personal"
A penalty was planned and priced in (and a maximum of 10 percent of sales was possible). It was important whether other measures come on top. There is nothing new to read here for me. So I see the news as very good. Regulation completed. Insecurity is gone.Or have I thought incorrectly about that?

"Found this article in full Chinese translated it _this is China’s media’s News! Posted by theChina Daily Journal 4/6￼Buffett partnered with Munger’s company to buy Alibaba, with a market value of about 37.5 million US dollars Surging news 04-06 19:29 Daily Journal Corp., a newspaper and software company owned by Warren Buffett's close partner, Charlie Munger, disclosed that it has increased its holdings in Alibaba (BABA.N). Daily Journal was founded in 1987 and is headquartered in Los Angeles, California. It is the largest legal newspaper group company in California. Later, it entered the field of professional software services, serving courts and other judicial institutions, and realizing case management in the cloud. Charlie Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, is the chairman of the newspaper group. According to the 13F file submitted by the Daily Journal to the US Securities Regulatory Commission on April 5, the company opened a new position in Alibaba US stocks in the first quarter of 2021, and held 165,320 shares at the end of March. The market value of the holdings was approximately 3,750 based on the current stock price. Ten thousand U.S. dollars. In addition, the company also holds shares in Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Posco and United Bank of America. These investments have not changed since the end of 2020."
Alimama goes down after good earning report! It happened so many times before. It's normal. Wall Street hates Chinese stocks.
Earning is before or after the market for tomorrow?
When was the last quarter that our BABA reported an increase the day of earnings release ?
"it will go back up when the mm's decide to let it go up. unless you day trade or have margin calls, just sit back and wait for it."
Here we are again
"HmmmmBABA broke pass EVERY support line average 2 year, 20 day, 50, 100... The only support I see is the line that connects 2016 and 2018 lowest points which brings BABA to about $190 per share.This stock screaming BUY at this level. Or maybe another 10% more lower."
Barron’s wrote an article that BABA was sold by a major pension fund along with GME; along with GME? Is thus a real story to begin with?
Last quarter's estimated YOY revenue growth is now 68.50% (source: Yahoo Finance).
"i m dumping another 20k into BABA today, bringing my BABA total to 230k, looking forward to the bull run coming"
This fine will mark the bottom for the stock. Don’t be surprised if we end up $15 higher Monday
Who is selling shares?- A combination of retail investors and big funds who use Alibaba as a piggybank. There are certain US funds sell Alibaba to buy small cap Chinese growth stocks. If you search for it you can find more precise which major funds are moving the money.
"9988.hk $216.80 , Baba $223.80"

"BREAKING NEWS ! SELL RATING !CFRA SAYS..........SELL !We maintain our Sell and cut our target by $17 to $198 due to: 1) growing delisting risk with the SEC now enforcing SOX-mandated audit reviews the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Chairman Xi refuses to allow, potentially sparking a preemptive CCP retaliation by rejecting equity ownership claims of mostly U.S. shareholders and forcing an unfavorable conversion to HK-listed shares China's citizens can legally own."
"whatever happened to Alibaba producing their own chips... with the chip shortage there is in the world, hopefully they can produce and deliver enough chips in china."
i will buy if it reach 140 lol
Hopefully close at $232.60 (or higher) in HK equaling $240 NYSE; set the new plateau for tomorrow. Dow and Naz futures are both green.
Look at 1M chart. Volume has been high since earnings. Lots of buying at these prices.
Positive article on China macro numbers in Peoples Daily May 18 (CCP mouthpiece) ... perhaps that article might lessen some of the red I expect from there tonight given todays NYSE chaos ... a close above $211 would be much appreciated ... GL
looking for a good stock to invest in so I can fund a communist party and a autocratic dictator. I think this checks all the boxes.
"As investor I'm not disappointed at all by earning results, on the contrary. Downfall today is an example of what Buffett call ""market irrationality"""
I have been right six straight months in a row on BABA shares going down from $ 310.0 and then to $210.00 !!!!!!! The next six months Baba will continue its downward Spiral in price !! China Gov't only in third inning of diluting Baba making them follow GOV't STATE Guidelines !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Next stop for sure is $ 200.00 a share !!!!!!!!!!!
"Like uh, what part of 'get out of China' do you longs not understand?"

Not saying this will happen again though 4 trading days from now will be 1 day before earnings￼￼, add another 2.5% would put us 233 {max pain} before earnings. 241 & 256 after that if going to gap up 2 months time frame _3 months to 271 / October to 300. Going by 100DMA solely from today’s action. Maybe Munger is correct for 2021."

"BABA will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect BABA to post earnings of $1.91 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 46.92%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $27.92 billion, up 72.95% from the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 7.53% lower within the past month. BABA is holding a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell) right now.In terms of valuation, BABA is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 21.94. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 64.39.-zacks"
I have a limit order in at $180. Getting there
"looking through all dozen fresh analysis coming out today, not a single negative side of story I can see there, sp target from 270-345, hope these can build the confidence in the market...for a guy following baba for so long, I know these analysis may means nothing in price action when comes to baba, but should give all people with common sense enough reasons to long, have a nice weekend"
' THE STREET ....claims that under 212 then next level is 185 . No way its gets to 220 or 185 without being manipulated . So ..nothing you can do its legal if you got the money.
"BABA and Ant Financial are insanely undervalued. Soley on the current offering is one reason, although when considering when taking into account Ali pay and future deployment of future deployment of cryptocurrency services the Ant Financial as FHC the share price should at some point has to be more equivalent or exceeds Amazon, their largest competitor in the USA with a much smaller footprint. For some time, BABA is trading ridiculously low and the financial market will eventually have to come to terms it is not going to remain as is and it will take off and become much more in line where it should be trading today and will trade at some point in time. While it does not seem to want to gain traction and get to a minimum of $500+ today in my view this none event should soon become a market event, especially when it does have two trading platforms (the USA and Hong Kong) that can turn their share price around in a very short period of time when the moment does present itself. Presently the some of the SPACs and direct listing do not present a better opportunity for wealth than BABA for those willing to get in now and continue to wait for a major breakout which I expect to occur. It does appear it's a matter of time for BABA/Ant Financial to become a major moving market event around the world."

CCP will never allow dividend payments to shareholders. These listings are designed to raise capital from enemy (USA) to rage economic war against the enemy (USA) from within. US investors are funding the enemy's growth until they become the global overlords. $bidu $pdd $jd $nio
"Hi what do you think.. We are on bottom? Believe, it will hold until tommorrow.. This stock is massively oversold."
I am opening account investigation for this turd. Can u imagine next year they claim revenue to be $143 and earnings just $11. This year revenue $100 B and $10 earnings ! Something is really fishy !!
"CFRA says sell in am , then noon GS says it’s a top pick for hedge funds now ; could weekend news get even better ?"
"“If you aren't willing to own a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.""We all know who said that. This is a stock for long term investors, not a quick trade. Just buy a 'forget' about it if you believe in the company."
"Few positive points though positive thing Aldo is they are working on clearing the way: The company hoped Ma's stake, which is worth billions of dollars, could be sold to existing investors in Ant or its e-commerce affiliate Alibaba Group Holding Ltd without involving any external entity, one of the sources with company ties said.But the second source also with company connections said that during discussions with regulators, Ma was told that he would not be allowed to sell his stake to any entity or individual close to him, and would instead have to exit completely. Another option would be to transfer his stake to a Chinese investor affiliated with the state, the source said.Any move would need Beijing's approval, both sources with knowledge of the company's thinking said.The accounts provided by all the three sources are consistent in terms of the timeline for how discussions have evolved over the past few months. On the company side, one source said Ma met regulators more than once before the Chinese New Year, which was in early February. And the second source said Ant started working on options for Ma's possible exit about a couple of months ago. The source familiar with the regulators' thinking said Ant had told officials during a meeting sometime before mid-March that it was working on options.The source familiar with the regulators' thinking has direct knowledge of conversations between Ant and officials, while one of the sources with company ties has been briefed on Ma's interactions with regulators and Ant's plans. The other one has direct knowledge of Ant's discussions about options. They requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.The Ant spokesman did not provide any comments from Ma. Alibaba referred questions to Ant. Jack Ma's office did not respond to Reuters' request for comment made via Ant. The State Council Information Office, PBOC, and CBIRC, also did not respond to requests for comment.The high-stakes discussions come amid a revamp of Ant and a broader regulatory clampdown on China's technology sector that was set in motion after Ma's public criticism of regulators in a speech in October last year.Another positive: Ma's exit could help clear the way for Ant to revive plans to go public, which stalled after the tycoon's speech, both sources proximate to the company said. Ant, which was about to raise an estimated $37 billion in what would have been the world's largest initial public offering, aborted plans the day after Ma's Nov. 2 meeting with regulators.""China still likes to promote its technology firms as global leaders just as long as they don't get too big for their britches,"" said Andrew Collier, managing director of Orient Capital Research.CONTROLLING STAKEAlthough Ma had previously stepped down from corporate positions, he retains effective control over Ant and significant influence over Alibaba.While he only owns a 10% stake in Ant, Ma exercises control over the company through related entities, according to Ant's IPO prospectus.Hangzhou Yunbo, an investment vehicle for Ma, has control over two other entities that own a combined 50.5% stake of Ant, the prospectus shows. Yunbo can decide all matters related to Ant and exercise the combined voting power of the three entities, the prospectus shows.Ma holds a 34% equity interest in Yunbo, the prospectus shows.One of the sources with company ties said there's ""a big chance"" Ma would sell his equity interest in Yunbo to exit from Ant, ultimately paving the way for the fintech major to move closer to completing its revamp and reviving its listing.Reuters could not reach Yunbo for comment. Ant did not provide a comment on behalf of Yunbo."

Look at Indexes inside China. All fell badly. Don't look at HSI !!
"Honestly, this may be a catalyst up. Clears the uncertainty. Play by the rules and let’s move forward."
All the bad news is long priced in. Buy more from weak hands
"Looks like another DISMAL DOWN DAY for you Poor BABA shareholders !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Going down in the PRE markets again !!!!!!!!!!!!! Glad I dumped these Baba shares at $310.00 !!!!! Since then , It's been No where's Ville for BABA !!!!!!!!!!! Time to sell maybe ?????????????"
"ANT will go IPO, may not be that high valuation like before. CCP already announce that they don't want to destroy Alibaba, but to teach them a lesson. Alipay is touted as one of their FOUR NEW GREAT INVENTIONS. You think they want to destroy it?"
"Remember that scene from Star Wars where the X-wing pilot is in the alley of the Death Star and saying, ""Stay on target... Stay on target..."" all the while his X-wing in shaking and cracking up. That's this stock - the target being Single Day (November 11th). You've got stay on target knowing that this thing is going to be up significantly by that date. Yes, in the movie the X-wing pilot was ultimately vaporized by a Tie-fighter's laser, but that's only you if you sell. Don't sell. Stay on target!"
I will be watching HK tonight and hope we can be strong again tomorrow. Maybe we can be $255 to $260 by end of the week ! DON'T SELL :-)
"Great quarter and we bought our way out of trouble for a few years… China did their damage here and will be targeting others - not BABA for a long time!! Honestly, probably a lot cheaper than lawyer fees dragged out!!"
todays options expiration plus we need give this 3 days before it may start to move up.
Has anyone considered the relative pricing to Amazon. Amazon has earnings per share at 5x more than baba but trades for 15x more per share. Have to discount for operating under a communist regime but baba is in a country with a population 4x that of US. I don’t see how this doesn’t go to a value equivalent to a 40 P/E ratio. Presently at 28 P/E. I think baba should be in the 350-375 range or nearly 50% upside here. Tell me why I am wrong.
BABA vs PDD which is better to invest?
up 5% in Hongkong premarket
"Attention !!!!!! BABA BAGHOLDERS !!!!!!!! Major Mutual Funds and Large Institutions have been quietly dumping blocks of their Baba shares !!!!!! If you don't believe me , then , look it up !!!"
"$BABA Patience, just buy on dips, collect your dividends and wait for Buybacks to take place!"
Seven we need you to cheer up the bag holders with your funny posts now 
"Until Chinese delisting threat will not be clarified, we must accept volatility and low prices."
2.75B$ roughly 4% of 2019 domestic revenues. May go down around $210-$215 tomorrow morning but will be temporary. We will know it tonight in HK market reaction. This regulatory threat came to an end & the uncertainty is over.
Looking good in HK
"Investors are looking at the 2.8 billions a pay off, and a path of moving on. The doubt is now on other Chinese tech companies."
China bond sell off could be the reason it's tanking. Also the bond yield is a lot bigger in China: 3.15%
Seems another red close is in the offing.You were warned.
Its ALL about the conference call tomorrow IMO. Huge beats havent been moving stocks this quarter or longer for BABA
"Just another "" SIDEWAY""S"" day for BABA SHARES !!!!!!!! I can't take all of the action this stock is providing !!!!!!!!! Glad I dumped my shares of Baba at $310.00 a share !!!!!!!! I made a lot of money !! Today Baba is going no place fast !!!!!!!!!!!"
Alibaba up 1.5%! That was the shortest shallowest day of consolidation I’ve seen in a while
Stocks always priced for future aspects. We crossed Bottom last week.
Just think how long it will take for baba to get back to 318A long time
Thumbs up if you also ignore China anti trust articles like advertisements
Who else is looking to buy ASAP?
"Chinese stocks in Wall Street, just like that. Short sellers use any excuses to hit Baba in last few years"
Jack Ma is working with the CCP on the digital Yuan. This should be great news for Alibaba stock and lead to a run-up until earnings. Is this the end of the bad blood and punishment for Alibaba?
"You investors are struck in a mud, which CC is not allowing to get cleaned. Read the news, and chalk your way out of this or wait for long time.Exclusive: China's Ant explores ways for Jack Ma to exit as Beijing piles pressure - sources"
"I recall facing plenty of naysayers 4 years ago when I bought shares in AAPL for around $170, and had to stare down at a 20% paper loss as the brickbats grew louder. My current outsized bullish bet is BABA. While I'm frustrated with the market's lack of appreciation and understanding of China and Baba's growth potential, like AAPL, I believe its fair valuation will prevail. For those with a 3-5 year time horizon, I suggest accumulating on every fresh 5% dip."

"ok, friends, as a long term long, I want to be more self aware, here are some concerns people pointed out in their ER, and some my answers:1. er shows they are doing much worse than last q...(it's like you compare amazon's sale between holiday season and spring break...);2. er shows loss in this q, even takes out the 2.8b fine, still the margin is not promising (if takes out the fine, they have a big jump y to y, cost increase is due to big expansion and new adventure, all achieve 40-100% growth in revenue, and when that transfers to bigger margin, it's will be huge, their reach to the lower tier market /cities in China is unbelievable, even they have lower margin now, but with the China speed, they post themselves well when the time comes);3. cloud is their star new adventure, and shows a slower growth (they mentioned they lost a big oversee client, still they keep 37%...how many cloud business at this scale can do 37%? if they got that client, I guess it's tiktok, their q growth should be around 68%, we can see how its competitors like BIDU Tencent are doing in the same q, but this wont bother me at this point);4. ANT, what happen then? (so, just be clear, even with IPO pause, they made 3-4 b profit...mind blowing, its fintech dominance is beyond any competitor's reach...that why ccp pay so much attention on it. IPO 2.0 is for sure but with holding company version, conservative speaking, should still valued at 50% of original)5. regulation, us delist...(how many times you heard about this, how many times you seen it really happens...Xi mentioned BABA in his gov report as one of china's great achievements, so they wont destory baba, on the contrary, they want to grow baba to make them proud but with more control for sure; baba is maybe the most transparent tech giant compared with its competitor their, their audit and book are done by PWC HK, they intentionally use a HK but not a mainland big accounting firm to show people their serious about transparency and not cooking anything there)6. SP target overstated? (depends what scenarios you are looking at, based on their guideline and a scale down ANT IPO2.0, 300+ should be a humble one, of course, using a more negative one, we can also conclude some number around 250, anything below that is hard to find rational way to support that)we are below 210 now. in the past 6 months, how many people can really believe we will see this level again after last winter? these are all I can think of, welcome any informative thoughts"
BABA is a prime example of why it's very important to diversify. I'm sure there are people who made BABA their largest position 2-3 years ago and are currently looking at a sub 5% annual ROI.
See what kind of negative news Barron’s prints in the morning. The wall street journal newspaper weekly and Barron’s on the weekend were the most (mostly only) informative and respected investment print in the 80s 90s. _investors business daily {IBD} came out 1984 with its raw numbers as the newest informative print as well at that time ; now years later sitejabber site [online business review platform]￼ has customer reviews of Barons a 1.5 star rating and both Wall Street Journal & investors business daily are both rated around by customers a 4.0￼￼￼ customer star review rating
I have rewired this stock....the red and black wires were incorrectly placed and switched during general maintenance - so this will be addressed this evening and 2morrow we go GREEN by 5+..... Boolean
I’m so confused ??! Zack’s Rank for Baba is strong sell while analysts said the target price is $300or even $400 this year. I don’t know who to believe!!!I’m not sure if it’s going to stay around This price the whole year or what??
waiting for big earnings!
Benhold at the Pakistani call center.... working as professional bashersBut still so happy making $1.46 USD a day LOL
Alibaba is in Jim Cramer‘s Action Alerts Plus bull pen and I expect him to open a position in Alibaba soon based on what he said and didn’t say on CNBC today￼.￼
The worst growth stock I’ve seen. I’ve been holding for 2 years waiting for the market to see the greatness in this company
Buy the dip!
"Baba is moving up, finally! Bears are retreating in their gloomy caves..."
BABA will fall like its uncontrolled Chinese rocket. HaHaHa
What has happened in the last 8 hours between the NY close and the up-coming HK open that's making BABA jump over $10 in HK?
"stop loss @205 , manage my loss"
"I don't know how may AABA shareholders may still be looking here for news (none, of course) till now. But now, with AABA's 1st q having ended and there actions in past to post their results just 5 or 6 weeks after the end of the period, wonder if us ""survivors"" might not want to keep an eye out for their results. We could possibly having some cash headed our way."
Margin Call. Most likely forcing people to sell. If the market is strong. Hopefully it jump back before earning numbers.
"Just to clear up for everyone, while I agree that Alibaba is a fantastic stock, alibabas revenue is NOT greater than apple’s Microsoft’s, e.t.c. The revenue is reported in CNY which has roughly a 7.75 CNY to 1 USD"
BABA currently has an average 12-month target of US$323 and rating of buy (representing an upside of 45%).
“Ant group is exploring options for founder Jack Ma to divest his stake and give up control”. This is good news.
Very low PE!Loading up here!Anything bellow $215 is a steal!
"Went up about 0,75% last week. The first green week since the ending of the antitrust investigation. Pathetic and really thought that, with the ending of the investigation, we could look upwards instead of falling even more. Hope better times come soon."
Amazon 400 billion annual revenue and market cap of 1.6 trillion Baba 500 billion annual revenueAnd market cap of 600 billion
Hate to break it to you but the political interference and headwind will only get WORSE. BABA is extremely limited to Chinese market while US tech companies are fully global.
China ends Ali Babas anti trust probe!!$300 here it comes
Guys you don’t need to be brave to hold a fast growing company. It’s to easy for me 
Premature reaction as usually.Very good report.
"Added @213,8; worst case scenario China just says ""Alibaba is ours"", unlikely to happen. More likely is US going to put more anti monopoly rules in place sooner or later. 389k fine with stock dropping 20b is unreasonable."
Today I got back into Baba and KWEB. Let them roll higher!
Let us take a in depth look at your BABA share price after hours !!!!!!!!!!!! It doesn't look good today again !!!
"Low volume lately. The low volume is likely the calm after the storm. The selling appears to have ended. The bad news is already in. Sooner or later the institutions will restart buying, the volume and the stock price will be up. Hang on!"
2 years ago I remember to bought Baba shares for $173. Really hard to believe that is sitting now @$204.
"WELL, WELL, WELL, !!!!!!!! LOOKIE , LOOKIE !!!!!!!!!!!! Was I right ?????? Or WAS I RIGHT ????? I told you so !! Everything in my charts point Baba shares to continue it's downward projection !!! Only $10.00 left to go to hit $210.00 a share !!!!!!! That is ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS less , than what I sold all my shares at a while ago for $310.00 a share !!!!!!!!"
"We are back at support levels not seen since last year, May 2020. Chinese stocks are out of favor now. Don't believe me, take a look at the three month chart of any China ETF. I don't pretend to know the future. I do know that the stock market is an irrational beast and BABA is in a downtrend. Consequently, the trend is your friend only if you are ""short"" BABA. Disclaimer: I am not short. I own a small amount."
Any bets on where the stock is next week 200 or 240?
"Good luck this week to all Baba longs and possible new investors. Even if the SP goes down a bit tomorrow, just keep in mind that all the Price Targets are at +$300. It will definitely go there. GLTA!"
Looking at this over and over and over: tomorrow morning pre-market could and should be the last entry dip & possible to hit low today’s interday price {226-224} after that should be smooth sailing until we hit May 9 week and then steady uptrend from there on all graphs￼
Some massive purchases being made in the last hour. Will hit normal daily volume by the time they break for lunch.
"how the Amazon of China is trading at a lower market cap than Tesla, is incomprehensible. Their rate of growth is unprecedented for a huge company. I believe there is currently an active short/ political agenda, that has this company in it's sights. In my view."
Wild 24 hours (To say the least). Things really turned in favor of the longs.
4 billion in profits despite the 2.8 billion fine. They seem to be doing just fine.
Ma yun showed up in Baba headquarter
Baba $250+ in no time.
Do u really want to invest baba when jack ma is being house arrested?
"No way to sugarcoat it: today is ugly ... I was hoping for Ant news, and that would be the Up accelerator - no Ant news means the regulatory overhang remains, and that overrides what was actually a good set of numbers, especially around operating margins-many on this Board said Baba never rises at ER, and they were correct, whereas I thought today would be the start of the uptrend-next step: relax, let the cup n'handle form, and see what next week brings (today/tomorrow and HK tonight are likely more pain)-yes, I still believe in Baba for many reasons, but the path up is a lot longer than I had anticipated-one more thing: never, ever go against GS ... if they forecast a rise in SP, you can bet the farm on it ... they are head n' shoulders above all other investment housesGLTA!"
"WELL , WELL, WELL, looky here !!!!!!!!!!! HMM!!!!!!!!!! I would tell you Baba shareholders today . "" I TOLD YOU SO"" !!!!!!!!!!! But, "" I told you so , just 12 hours ago , to dump Baba shares !!!!!! It goes lower from here today and in the future !!!!!!! SELL !!!!!!!!!!!"
"I just searched ""CFRA"" and the last thing I saw was they already had a ""Sell"" rating on BABA back on Jan 5th when BABA was 240. It then sold off, then went to 270 a month later.So disregard."
"They need a dividend or buyback, nothing else is going to get people interested with CCP storm clouds ever looming. Profitable business, but poorly managed stock imo."
Only nit-wits would be selling now
"Lets be real here. Today, even at BABA, has been a gainer day. 9988 was big in the red and BABA was like -1% at some point in the morning. Today has been fine. This is a slow moving wagon on the uptrend."
good time to buy shares
"Alibaba Group Holding Limited $BABA is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2021 results on May 13.For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.91 per share, indicating growth of 46.9% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure."
"Max option pain has dropped from 237,5 USD earlier to now 235 USD."
"Trading at Dec. 2019 (pre-COVID) price. If you want exposure to Chinese markets, this is the best price in a year on what is probably the best single company."
This stock is so undervalued now with the earning report it should be able to go back up to at least a decent level.
I would not be suprised if ARK had to unload China stuff to cover losses in its high-flyer bets like Coinbase
"Really glad for all the longs on this board to see big players slowly getting back in and to have a green day. As said before, shorts and media will still try to hold this stock down as long as possible. Then again, that will be temporary as you cannot hold down forever one of the biggest companies in the world. Stay strong and glta."
Without any positive press release from BABA the stock price will just hover in the low 200.
BABA CFO: penalty will be written off in March Q and over with!!!
Baba heading to $500
"per my TD Ameritrade alert updates, GoldmanSachs (GS) re-affirmed Baba as a buy with a $350 PT ... in my experience, they are literally the gold standard on stock forecasts"
"6% down in a day, 15% down in a month is bad, but some of you are acting like it's the end of the world. Remember AMZN, NFLX, TSLA fell by 50% or more during their runs. Yes, BaBA won't give you a 10+ bagger like those guys, but 50% in 6m is quite possible, so is 100% in a year or 2. Have patience and play the long game"
the entire market is controlled by mm's and hedge funds. most of the financial media caters to them. they cast the reason for market drops so they can short and then pick up cheap shares. it's a cycle they play.there is no supply and demand driven prices anymore.
"Why fight the inevitable BABA SHAREHOLDERS ???? You know , deep down ,Baba shares will be going further south , why hold on and lose more of your cash again this week ?????? WHY ???????"
"Loss of $5.14 today...YAAAYY, YIPPEEE, YAAHOOO!!Blessed be the warning and the holy fall out."
Those poor bears.
So sad  I loved you BABA - you used to be fun and exciting
ok so this is the end？
"Facebook has been fined 5B and the share price went up, this is the end of uncertainty!"
It seems to be getter closer to it's 52 week Low Price of $189.00 !!!!!! Forty Dollars more to go !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
News bloggers are again trying to pull down BABA but Moody's analyst says it was not a downgrade. It may affect the future revenue of course but Alibaba is in good shape financially.
Shoulve been in AMD who beat top/bottom line!!! But then again you mules keep your precious Alibaba and plan for more disappointment and tears.You were warned.
"BABA is currently trading at a 2021 P/E ratio of 18-19x based on 12,7$ net profit per share. Forward P/E 2022 around 15-16x. Growth rate +25%. That is probably the cheapest large cap in the world. Last time I bought shares of Apple at this price-level in 2011. Analysts were as pessimistic as hell. Growth rate would be even single digit. We all know what happened with the share price. I bought BABA shares in 2018 but have no return yet. I wonder how much longer a patient shareholder has to wait...Please advise."
Alibaba agreed to comply with the Antitrust case and let the sellers use any other platforms. Good for $JD obviouslyGood for $BABA as resolves the uncertainty
"1) Trading at High volume. 2) Green and Increasing price while s&p is still red/flat. 3) Significantly Undervalued. Even the most conservative Munger hopped on.4) Have all the room for growth.Enjoy the BABA ride  there might be some bumps, but 300 isn’t too far for those who know this game. Cheers "
"Fundamental value of Alibaba is around 270 USD and towards 300 USD+ by year end. With conservative estimates on free cash flow. Because Alibaba is ""Chinese"" and US has the ""delisting"" as a tool (used 4 times), the US hedgefunds and big funds can control prices and therefor maximize profits on options."
Time to buy more
10% 15$ up from here potentially
CCP has sold over 300. Now they will own ANT n this state run company with Tencent.
It's 4AM !!!!!!!!!!!! How low can these Baba shares go ????????????????????

Buy calculating an WACC of 15.45% and considering a growth in free cash flows of about 13% (less then the average growth) i ve got a present price of about 336.45 $ .. bought in the deep after earnings see u in a couple of months
"Not liking the lack of volume. It’s rising slowly and gradually but very little conviction behind the move. Hoping to see volume go up by earnings, because these levels are not inspiring much confidence"
"baba reports tomorrow, before or after the bell?"
BABA poised to lift off to $300 by mid may
Shorted this stock all the way down from $305... Made a fortune  Will flip this stock at 190 and go long.
"Major fund MCHI is converting all Alibaba shares from NYSE version to HK version by May 27th. This trend is only going to continue, as they are virtually identical and with far less political delisting risk. I’m very bullish on the company itself long term... but might want to consider switching out of the NYSE Baba before more funds start following suit"
up 10 down 10 ..swing traders are making a fortune here . More in a week than a long makes in years .
"Lots of fear in the air, but nothing changed in fundamentals. Adding to position again today. Smaller batch now and waiting NYSE to open to do a bigger buy."
"shorties sweating - the market is red and this is up, wait when the market goes green this will fly !"
Wow still 220sAll this hype and optimismSad really
"Isn’t it amazing how news comes right out when it hit its double bottom, true double bottom, and a in the three month time span as if they wanted to catch it right there [222] to make it go up ! impeccable timing￼"
"Sooner or later, the market will realise that Baba is a good hedge against American inflation and/or weak USD."
Like to see it break the trend of rising in the AM only to sell off later in the day. The strong volume buying in the very final mins is a good recent change though.We need a close above 215 on strong volume and for BABA to show relative strength vs the Naz to bring in more buyers.
BaBa is going down as the world now know not to buy Chinese companies which will support China and bring the world another pandemic again!
"Positive earnings probably were leaked to the big boys and they are making their moves. Should see a nice run up until the day after earnings, then a dump. Happens every earnings report."
I smell desperation.. Haven't seen so many fake news posts on here in a while.
A word of advice. Don't make your buying/selling decisions based on analyst recommendations or price targets. Look how well that's turned out with BABA.
Baba is significantly undervalued
"If you are a BABA investor and feeling down, here's a thing that should cheer you up:at least you are not JimmyZzzz.Thanks."
"My source tell me, next week the price actions for Alibaba would be anywhere in between 210 and 225. By Friday it will close at 223.41"

"This begs beliefEarnings have grown since Dec last year, and the investigation is overYet the stock is even lower.....This is a very worrying sign"
We are approaching the top of the market and baba keeps falling. I wouldn't put $10 into this falling knife.

"Mobile MAUs on our China retail marketplaces reached 925 million in March 2021, an increase of79 million over March 2020."
"No matter if Alibaba beats it or not....It will back to $220.00 in next 2-3 weeks No point to buy and hold , buy and sell !"
What a shocker.. Baba is underperforming the market like it has the past 3.5 years!!!!
Even Charlie Munger is buying BABA.
"Hang Seng Tech Index fell by more than 30% since Feb 16, mostly due to regulatory concerns. Now, people start to put these concerns behind them. Time for Chinese tech to recover."
"Settle down Joseph. Take it easy buddy. We've heard you, don't worry. Just settle down, get some ice cream, go for a swim. Enjoy the day. Don't worry about it."
"You will cry if you do not buy BANK shares now ! No one can do better in this situation , no one can make more profits than banks. Forget EV ,semiconductors, basic materials ,.....they will not go up more but Banks share prices will go up at least 20%-50% ! If you do not belive me , just ask investors from high inflation countries like Russia, Argentina , Brasil ,Turkey ,..... BANKS there make more than all other sectors"
still yet to hear Jimmy z recommend a good stock for a long position...
Did not have nerves to add today. Was expecting 211 to add a bit. So nothing for me today. Shame but I already have BABA bag too large
"Playbook? Just like yesterday. Open red, close up $3."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"nice uptrend, lot of room to grow, all of us we knows the fair price of BABA is around 300 (if not more)"
this is the only stock I've ever averaged up this far above my cost basis. but I bought those shares years ago. hard to turn down these prices today
"From bloomberg website ( google search for: as-ipo-looms-all-you-need-to-know-about-jack-ma-s-ant-group ) here is a breakdown of ANT Group:Online Payments: $17 T processed via AlipayLending: $290B in Consumer LoansAsset Management: $173B FundInsurance: 107 M people insuredEven if lending requirements change from 2% to 30%, and even if the Lending reduces by say 50%, income is not going to be impacted that much, and the valuation of $225B that was given last year could be reduced to $150B, BUT if you noticed that the IPO was oversubscribed many times, so on debut, the market cap will definitely become higher.ANT Group has the most number of patents in Blockchain and other related categories and a company like Stripe if its valued more than $100B, ANT can easily be valued at more than $200B. The opening up of other platforms makes it easy for ANT to get more profits and in China and other regions of ASIA, Alipay is still the dominant payment platform. Employees of ANT are waiting for a way to monetize their shares, and this will soon go an IPO and we will cross $300 soon ( all it takes is 5 days or less to cross $300)"
show us green opening the only stock I got faith on is baba at the moment !!! 1 year flat
Time to load before it explode to 300.
"So big money managers have been pilling up their money since mid-Feb 2021 in Dow Jones companies which have seen the EPS obliterated since Q2 2020 and yet no recovered. We see that in average the stock price of those companies have gone past the value prior to covid crisis and yet with awful earnings. PE ratio prior to covid was <20 whereas at present PE>30. Then ""smart"" people come here and call BABA stock a risky investment. Well looking at companies fundamentals I would say BABA is a safer investment than any of those pre-historic overvalued companies in the DJ. Good luck to all with your investments."
"When shorts celebrated what seemed the darkest moment, baba shot up 10%, that is why good company always reward long term believers and leave weak hands in the dust."
A Great Reset is coming.Every stock will be cut in half. (Phase 1)It's non-negotiable.Later everything will be cut in half again. (Phase 2)

"This is absurd, this stock should skyrocket right now, and all we know that"
"Look at the 5 day chart, entire weeks gains wiped out in one day over what? This isn’t normal, something is up"
The volume in HongKong is extremely low. With small amount of shares Alibaba can be used as a ragdoll by hedgefunds making 100s of millions if not billions on the option chains.
Morgan Stanley downgraded china internet ecommerce sector to underweight sector last night. A little late don't you think ?
"Today hurt, but no intention of selling for years. I still think I will make MONEY."
Was hoping to make a move out of BABA this year but it looks like that ain't happening. Not taking a loss on it. I'll ride this thing into the ground if need be.
"Baba is a bargain, a no brainer to invest.It is on al level of beginning 2018 while stock market has raised more than 50%.The earning report was great and investors will expect a lot of Good News in the Future.I am adding and I am sure with ken fisher …it is one of the best investments you can actually do.Even Charlie munger has bought."
"Over the past year not a lot of things made sense in the markets, including the BABA drop. If I remember correctly, when the trade war was announced BABA fell like crazy as well. Everyone was scared about the future of the stock, and I bet everyone here wish they bought that dip at $132 in Dec. 2018. Just like last time, nothing has changed fundamentally in the business. All of this is just panic on panic. If you’re long and can set your money aside for a few years you’ll be just fine. Baba is still 50% of my portfolio. Now I’m not saying go out, take a loan, and put all your life savings on the line, because that isn’t smart regardless of what you’re buying."
Feeling bullish today :)
Big earnings and huge price drop means the big institutions want to push this down to get in cheap and shake off weak hands.
"Why are China stocks tanking? FXI (index), BABA...all of them????? FXI chart right at support, but 50 day rolling down....hope it does not cross 200 day avg."
"Analysts expect it to report that revenue soared 72% to $27.8 billion for the period ended March 31. In addition to being its best growth in three years, that would also be Alibaba's fourth straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth.With all the crazy things going on and my limited time/ability to day trade I have found https://dailytrading.tools/rp7ber useful"
Had high hopes for BABA but it’s fading fast. Seems to be falling apart
"It becomes more and more a big pain and it smells for manipulation.Baba is valued ridicolous cheap, never seen such a fraud around with respect to such a big capitalised stock.I will add shares, baba is from fundamental point of view a 400 usd Stock."
"Let's go BABA, time to catch up with pdd, JD, Bidu. Time for rotation into big Chinese, completely undervalued tech. Queasy stomach? But VWO and open all of them, and then some. I topped off earlier this morning, a lot cheaper on BRK.B, VTI, VWO, USB, and VTV. Happy investing everyone!"

"Huya is at a 52- week low, in spite of good earnings. I don’t know why traders hate Baba and Huya, lately. The drops feel excessive."
Baba can make a trillion dollars revenue but the stock gets pushed down
Good day everyone. Let’s see more green tomorrow!!
Here comes the capitulation. they might be trying to take out those stops at 199.99
"Tencent fell, why does any negative news has to move baba too???"
Alot of people saying back in December that all the headwinds on BABA stock wouldnt be a big deal....well here we are. These trends will continue
I pay top dollar for anyone who can keep Jiimyz/Joseph quiet.
"There is no reason the stock to be down, their earnings were good but took a one time charge for the China BS."
Finally one day up. But the profits are vanished thanks to short term holders.

Here comes the loser baba bear spam. Excited to see how quiet the bears get on the conversation page when earnings are good and stock goes back to 270+ in a month.

"Sorry up than 210.00$ end of the day, and check after hours....OUFF we go up!"
"Baba shares seem to like that number $210.00 !!!!!!! That is what I said it would be !!!! You Mocked and made fun of me !!!!!!!!! Lesson learned today !, Never , Ever, Mock or make fun of the ""MASTER "" !!!!!!!! You will lose !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sell Baba , and move on to better choices in the Stock market !!!!!!!!!!!!"
I hate 2 as leading digit in front of this. Let's get to 180 !
"When Sleepy Joe raises the corporate tax rates in the US by 5+ percent, people will be clamoring to get into these high growth Chinese tech stocks that will be taxed at a much lower rate."
Sub 230 USD short gamma will kick in (more selling). 226-227 USD is the first support and 220-223 USD is the second support. Below that there's a gap to 212+ to the next support level.Goodluck my friends :) eventually we will rise albeit slowly.
It is right on the support level and rebounding from 206.08. Excellent result and we can ignore the one time penalty.
Bought more today - even though all I've done is lose on BABA - The numbers are too good for this not to get off the mat.
"October 2020, BABA 319"
Despite the news of last weekend and the market being down overal Alibaba is up and showing strenght.
"People just don't know BABA has offended Chinese Authority. ANT IPO is dead. WeChat Pay and Alipay will eventually be replaced by the digital yuan developed by the government as they want to eliminate underground money movement, control the macro and micro economy and how people spend their money. BABA cloud platform will eventually acquired by the government as Chinese government just want to control the data as this is typical communist where they want to know everything about their people . BABA will eventually like CHL state owned, and the company interest will never be aligned with investor interest. Study This is fact based on their history."
NICE.....And just remember that this stock is controlled by the NY market (NOT Hong Kong).
IF 218-223 levels comes or lower it's a good entry.There somehow seems to be fear. Anyone fearfull here?
"Delisting rumors are fake. Politically connected Goldman and Al Gore wouldn't be recommending/investing in BABA if that were true. Just rehashed nonsense.What is true is BABA, Tencent, and others are raising their spending to invest in growth, mostly in the same areas, which will drive down earnings near term and potentially reduce future investment returns as competition heats up. But the Chinese and Southeast Asia market pie is so large, BABA at a trillion dollar valuation in the next year is still within reason.Remember, Tencent released earnings and is down slightly more than BABA, and I think that was driving sentiment more than some CFRA nonsense. And, as they say, May is historically a weak month for Chinese stocks.I said earlier that 212 was support and we're not that far from it even after a bad day full of rumors and rehashed ratings.You need patience with BABA in this market. If you're looking for big gains in a week, buy a meme stock the kids are into."
Is it too much to ask this stock to perform to nasdaq and not lsoe everything
"baba is falling is not due to shorts...just no buyers right now, earning will be the moment to define baba's next several months, people have a lot questions, let hope they have clear and positive answers. imho, this is one of the best stocks you can find in this market, I guess we just need that earning to convince everyone..."
"OK people !!!!!! The ones who bought these wonderful ( CAN'T MISS , SURE THING ) BABA shares on MARGIN !!!! Today , is payday !!!! Pay your MARGIN CALLS !!!!!! Get it up !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"If we assume that Alibaba can grow at 20% compounded annually over the next decade (conservative estimate) before slowing, and then receiving a PE of 15 (historic average for all stocks) from the market, then in 2031 the price of Alibaba would be $923. Using a discount rate of 10% per year, we arrive at a fair value of $355. That's over 70% upside... crazy cheap!"
"The old adage is ""Sell in May"" after buying in Mar.Remember mkts have seasonality and many times sell off in May only to rebound in the summer and then again in Q4."
BABA ...ths train is going to next stop 220th- st. it will stop for a while there to continue to 230th street.. buy your tickets
"This beast will unleash itself one day and become one of the fastest growth stocks on the market. Politics are the only obstacle, but Alibaba will climb out of nowhere. Be ready."
Jack Ma lets his success getting to his head sometimes. He needs to be more humble. BABA can run itself fine now without Jack Ma. He should focus more on charity works now and enjoy his old age.
"Idc what people say, I’m loading up here!!! Love the potential growth!!!"
Cramer was touting baba this morning. That was your clue to SELL SELL SELL!!You were warned.
"KBC Securities and Keybanc released new targets, respectively USD 320 and USD 305."
I thought the fine was a game changer that removed uncertainty. Nope.
"C'mon JUSTIFY why your PRECIOUS BABA SHARES are tanking today !!!!!!! Who can you BLAME it on today ??? C'mon , let's hear some of those GREAT REASONS !!!!!!"
we will end up on green today
"Green premarket, green forever.Welcome to the new Alibaba"
"The penalty is one-time event, which makes loss.But Baba will not pay penalty every quarter. the low P/E is buying opportunity."
"Price target Alibaba by end of year 2021: $270.00 - $300.00.At 208,50 and 210,56 I added positions for family members. I am currently maxed out; likely in 2 months I will add if price stays below $227.00."
Could someone who knows comment on what would happen with shares if it was delisted from NYSE? Would it be just traded in OTC? Would I be forced to sell or pay capital gains if I am at the profit?
"Can you BABA investors verify the Yahoo Finance statistics of total cash=$462B vs total debt of$148B and cash per share of $171. If these numbers are true, no wonder a $2.75B fine is ""not material"". Also supports why most analyst have this stock pegged at over $300/share."
OH NO....its has happened again!!You were warned.
"There seems to be no interest in the stock, all the bad press has hurt us over the months. Down for the 5th day in a row for a total of $9.92, we will see a green day soon !"
"Shorts, can you go easy on us Bulls? Aren't we all humans here? Well, not sure about some of you...but show some compassion, dangit.Anyway, yes, you were right, I was wrong. But, you won the battle, not the war. Aug Q will be ours, and in Nov, we will serve your heads on platters.Thx."
Tesla Ponzi System pe 1200. vs baba value stock pe 25My goodness....what will I buy? Baba is a no brainer.
On the 3 year week chart using all studies 217.50 is now the pivot point with 12-18 months high 336-384 {calculating this on the continuing long term chart} [double of the current bottom intermediate averages now shows 434 18-24 months out]
"Jeez, got to admit this is painful. 10th red day in a row. No signs of short term improvement. Best is to stop following the ST for a couple of weeks, but can't manage that, lol."
"Bottom of the 2SD bollingers on the daily AND the weekly charts, and also hovering right on that 200 day moving average. These next couple weeks are going to have some pretty serious implications on the direction of this stock for quite some time, from a technical standpoint. GLTA"
Huge premarket volume.
"225-230 usd was in the option chain for this week. For those interested how I found that level: just look where most options expire worthless. Normally option writers are the big US funds that like to make money and also control media. Media can influence people's mind and the stock market is more a game of psychology than anything else, though fundamentals will eventually push prices in a certain direction."
Fearless prediction $245 next week
Joseph get a life 
"I don't believe in Jesus, but I believe in BABA. Hoping for close above 212 or better to end the week, to set us up for a run to 220 where we can start forming a base again."
"Baba went up 18 points in HK this week, not bad."

Large buying volume coming in
"It really gets lonely at the top !!!!!!!! I was right about Baba !!!!! I can't help it , since I am SO SMART !!!!!!!!!"
Great buying opportunity at 200. Will be 300 within the next 12 months
I love the way this and Tesla are basically the same market cap even though baba makes 10x the profit of Tesla
Rule of thumb : everytime it reach the oversold line ... just SELL as it will definitely retracks bigtime. Shorters are taking the shots and taking advantage of investors who wanted to see Alibaba succeed. Chinese proxy traders are shorting BABA.
How much Charlie Munger paid for BABA?
Easy money. Over sold. Profits. But buy buy.
"Being baba investor you don’t typically just buy, you always buy the dip"
I wished that wayward Chinese rocket crashed on Joseph's (one of JimmyZzz's many handles) head.
Check JP Morgan on CNBC online this morning Chinese Tech stocks at good buying point
"This situation of China's US counterparts (BABA vs AMZN, GOOG vs. BIDU, etc) being consistently valued at 3-10x has to correct at some point. Either US valuations will have to come down or China valuations will have to increase in a major way. I have no idea which will occur, but if the goal is to acheive fair value at some point (as the market is supposed to do), it will have to happen."
Wow ... walked back the whole pop today.
stop talking this one down... with the fine / punishment now sorted this monster of a stock can move forward..... the price by Friday will be 10% up... I am buying Monday!
"Caught the dip at 212, great sale!"
Hoping for a big beat
"With our price action the past few months, you’d have a hard time convincing me that there isn’t trading on inside info."

"Everyone should go on Alibaba’s website to their investor relations page, and read their letter to investors from today. It sounds quite encouraging and if the press conference sounds anything like their letter, we will be in a good spot next week"
Any explanation for the huge letdown in HK market?
"the way of it . . . Polen capital, great article."
"Strange, no one mentioned that Alipay is working with the Chinese central bank on digital currency. They have an option to use it in the Alipay App. Good or bad for Alipay? At least the Chinese government is not going to destroy BABA."
kind of crazy that the low target for this stock is $250 yet people keep selling.
at least we have higher high yesterday
I expect shorts squeeze monday morning
"Let's not lower expectations too much. 211 is very, very low. We really need 220s this week to not form all kind of new barriers and lower bottoms."
"@Joseph, we all know you are a financial guru and you are working overtime here but time is up. Need to go to your mamas basement again."
Going to pop above $250 soon!!
"i am still in, only because of Munger. He knows more than me"
"Media actually says sell Alibaba now, but buy when price crosses above 280."
BABA fundamental value is better than most of American companies now; the only problem is it is a Chinese company and Americans hate Chinese now due to Covid-19 and political tensions
Will break 200 on margin calls--
$270 by end of week. This will not go down from here before it touches $300 again. The cheapest blue chip tech stock
"Looks to me I was Right again !!!!!!! Today , Baba is Sinking in share Price going down further below $210.00 !!! My charts have been Correct !!!!!!!!!"
"BABA is barely hanging on to support levels while the rest of the market soars. Consider the ""opportunity cost"" of hanging on to a struggling stock when you gave buy one of the FAANGs or a Tech Index or ETF. The rationale for holding or buying BABA is getting weaker day by day. Disclaimer: I am a bag holder, not a short. I fully expect BABA to go up once I give in and sell. I will let everyone know when I sell so you can get the ""Buy"" signal. I have a proven track record of buying high and selling low, a perfect contrarian indicator."
keep selling! please!
I just joined BAba for the first time. I think it has very good long terms prospects!
Get those sell orders in soon !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Asia red all over, including HSI. 9988 down $4.60 (live feed) but JPM call to $350 getting nice airplay on CNBC right now."
someone please go on reddit and post about BABA and how the shorts in it must get crushed. thanks
"it really surprises me when I heard old Charlie bought baba...he is really old old school and rarely touches new market stuff....which imho is double positive news, means even conservative person like him see how solid this firm is....hope we can break 231 resist and heading to 240 this week"
Sell some 230 puts today or buy 240/250 calls especially on a longer time frame could be an idea if you area really bullish.- this is not financial advise -
Alibaba Group (BABA) reported mixed results early Thursday and set a milestone by serving 1 billion active users on its e-commerce platform. The Alibaba earnings report for its fiscal fourth quarter prompted a drop in shares. Been watching stocks like this. Found a service that tells me buys and sells. https://investena.today/lderql
"Just loaded up on more shares today, doubling down on my original investment. Again, this is a long term investment, the key words being LONG TERM. Buy into value and good fundamentals, and you’ll be fine. It can and will take time for value to be realized but it will be realized. A recent report by Morning Star had 55 out of 56 financial analysts rated this stock as a strong buy. I would wager that this many analysts aren’t wrong. The declines are painful, don’t pretend they aren’t. I’m down 5% on my original investment, and I know there are a lot of people down much more then me. However, the stock will recover, and despite what trolls would have you believe, the stock isn’t going to magically go to zero. Hold strong, and don’t keep obsessing over your portfolio, because time is on our side."
China's GDP rose 18+%. You can bet BABA's earning will be awesome. Wait for it!
"Buy the dip, hell of a great deal! STRONG BUY WHAT IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR MUNGER IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!!! all in"
So far: the new regulations will push into more competition and make Alibaba offer more services to merchants for free (good for merchants). Multichannel sales through other platforms are allowed now. Alibaba is also going to compete for lower tier cities (PDD will get more fierce competition). Goverment will also look at peers. -- to be continued
"Rev +64% / +40% (ex sun art) / Profit (ex fine) +48%, EPS +12%35B free cash flow.. so 35B of cash causes a +0,23% increase premarket? LOL"
Lol who think it will close green now
"I've finally muted the known trolls here like JimmyZzzz and his many handles. They were good for cheap laughs, but now it's time to get serious and focus on our BABA. Weak hands are washed away, not let's see if we can have some positive momentum for once. Hopefully the Nasdaq will cooperate."
Jimmy Z the master has spoken. Baba is going bankrupt so let's risk everything on the Baba train and get some profits before that happens. Super-bullish!
$239s.......Imagine that!
"The only issue with this stock is being delisted otherwise, it would be a 500+"
"Baba is way under valued compare to S&P by 35% this year. So, this will catchup by the end of year to $340 dollars."
"BABA slowly climbing the past few days. I suspect some large fund(s) are slowly buying in, but are avoiding doing a large buy to prevent the stock price from jumping up. I think they're just taking out the weak hands."
"What is the rush people have with baba?The sooner this explodes the less money you will make, buy shares now before there is no way back"
Everything is green and this stock is red. Its stroooooong fundamentals don't seem to be able to support it. It appears only the ppl on this board seem to support it :). I think maybe dreamers on here need to give the SP a pep talk and remind the institutional investors of what a great stock BABA is :). Maybe they will listen.
"I was right before about Baba shares , and I will be right again !!!!!!!!! Sell today , while it's up a few bucks !!!!!!!"
does Alibaba pay dividends
"Finally, today’s volume is higher than 3 month average volume"
Trading below HK close with NYSE up If NYSE lets this go up will be 20-30% run within a 60 cycle when it does (like last time 230-317); question is how much farther pullback [Not too much if still and positive market trends] & how long before run will start again ￼

Looking at the six month chart showing confined range 222-236 Not to break this range for another month yet till around May 10￼. So if we go by that chart we are at the double bottom￼_ unless a descending triangle within the next 30 days prove that wrong to test 217-208Going to the one year chart looks very positive once breaking 236 will test immediately 271￼￼ and that can start immediately following the two weeks May 10 area which Un-coincidentally earnings is on May 20￼￼. Timing & technicals combined are in a range followed through with volume issues though held up by fundamentals. Negative news only can keep this in this range short term 20-30 days before next earnings
"Approaching 52w lowsIts not like the fine has been dished out and the anti-trust regulatory uncertainty dissipated?Odd one, the stock is stuck"
"There is a news article almost everyday saying BABA is one of the best stocks to own since last October and yet it isn't even close to the price it was in October. Are they looking 10, 20 years into the future?"
Anybody thinking between $260 and $270 by Friday?
Just reposting what I posted two days ago sticking to it:￼Reuters Bloomberg Will bash 12 more days until the three month chart can break 241.71 around May 9 just like we bottom the 222 on the chart and it had to go up. From now till then 236 ~if breaks 232
Some people always yell “delisting” while Charlie Munger “secretly” bought in. Which one should I trust?
Unreal. The market is booming green and we’re all taking losses today. Never seen anything like it in a company this size
Have a buy order right at 208
"just added more thank you, I promised myself for the last 3 months I wont buy any more but seriously at this price, cannot resist, no way is this going any lower"
Ready for the run? I expect really good news in the coming ER! GLTA Longs!
Currently I own a few shares but who really owns this company?
"Love me and my price targets $137 on this & 102 on BIDU, FUTU & BILI are rated @30"
"Birkshire Hathaway releases their 13F tomorrow. Does he join Munger in purchasing one of the cheapest, most extremely profitable technology companies?"
classic wall street. Triple bottom....then go lower to trigger the stops and try to start a panic sell. Then load up. LOL
Red again?
"Monday….I will go all in.The stock is a big bargain, the same as apple in 2012 and 2013 and amazon as well.All these great companies had the same issues with exaggerated fears. ONCE THIS IS OVER, WE WILL SEE 350 USD….and it will go very fast for sure, because everybody is jumping on the train and shortsellers have to buyback shares with huge amounts."
"what is an antitrust violation? Because BABA is growing too fast too big, CCP is afraid it will become a monopoly. Got it? BABA is now an unstoppable giant. whether you think CCP is evil or not, BABA is long for sure."
now that china interference is over...this is going to 300 this year.
"Just bought some BABA's, as I think there is a lot of upside potential right now...Good look to all longs (including me;-)"
"Come Tuesday morning I expect at least to open at $250, anything less is unacceptable"
Just bought 20 more shares not a lot but now I hold 62 let’s gooooooooooo 
Buy Buy Buy.. This stock is cheap.. anything below $250 is awesome. Dont be left behind.
"shares have been on a downward run into earnings. Why? Not because the earnings are going to be bad, but because the CCP likes to make sure any positive BABA news gets taken down with negative BABA news regarding some made-up violation or other nonsense. End of the day, Xi has a grudge against Ma. It isn't going away and he takes it out on BABA and ANT Financial, since that's where Ma has his $$."
"Truth is this needs to drop to at least $180 to make it worth the risk. And I am long. And down big-time.Everyone is either pretending to ignore the US-China issues (US already lost by the way), so they have nothing to lose at this point on having it traded here or not. Now granted there will be major turmoil if this escalates, but why not wait until it all boils over than getting creamed in slow motion. CCP is also in control behind the scenes, and we know it, which is not to say U.S. companies have their ""own"" nuances which are roughly analogous/comparable to China's market system."
Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Expected to Post Quarterly Sales of $32.91 Billion. See details: http://snd.qlitrk.com/r/hnpks
You have been warned Jimmy
"ALIBABA stock is the NUMBER one Disappearing Magic Act in the WORLD !!!!!! "" NOW YOU SEE IT < NOW YOU DON'T "" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Today Friday looks like another down day for Baba !!!!!! If I had extra money to invest , I have plenty of other investments buy into that are have been going up over the last couple months !!!!!!!!"
3 more hrs to trade . Thinking 203 ?
"Tim Seymour and Karen Fineman both spoke to Baba on Fast Money today and I would paraphrase them as saying: it’s a good stock, it’s been painful last few months (both are long), under valued, and Govt uncertainty is the culprit ... Tim then made it his Fast Money pick at the end of the show"
Gap filled; next 219 & 225
Baba is buying back at 210? it held there.... expect 212$ end of day.
Thumbs up if you will become millionaire when BABA will reach 1000$
These are past dates last year with the gap run ups starting from this same 211 range check it out￼. 6/29/20 211.78 7/9/20 268 9/1/20 298 10/27/20 319
"Why is BABA constantly punished by the market so harshly while TCEHY continues to thrive? Both are Chinese megacaps and are involved in a number of different businesses/industries, yet, BABA trades like it's on the verge of bankruptcy while TCEHY trades comparable to US megacaps like AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, etc."
Forward PE of 19 for one of the fastest growing big tech companies? I’m in.
"A lot of profit taking from the +9%, Baba will most likely be green tomorrow with more buybacks."
"Thanks to Baba shareholders donating their cash to China, maybe now China can afford Space craft that can come back to earth with a guidance system attached to it !!! Not , just crash anywhere ( INDIAN OCEAN ) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The price is so attractive that I am sure all Hedge funds will buy the stock at this price. Can't wait for the Aug 16 Filing deadline to see who bought at these low prices.As for true longs, there is no loss if you hold on to your stocks. Doesn't matter how many lows we hit on our road to $300+."
I think this is positive news. The provision for the expected penalties is over $ 7 billion . So it can be paid easily without affecting the result. China Fines Alibaba $2.8 Billion
"Declining on this fine is nonsense. It is only 389.000 USD! It’s sentiment and trying to flush out retail. Fundamentally not a problem at all for this company, relax and think it over."
"Very good read on this SAAS innovator, this could be a very undervalued look; https://prem.li/eo3"
"There is at least a 50% upside, fundamentals ultimately must be reflected in the price."
People buying calls and they drop the price to steal ur money. It’s sick
Baba 233.2 +6.972%240 USD
i dont know about you guys but im happy with my purchase at $ 205
Any one heard additional information on the delisting? Serious replies only and thank you!!Consider this a warning.
"There appears to be a lot of market manipulation going on with BABA. The media stories coming out daily just fan the fires. Keep an eye on the companies fundamentals. Five years from now, this will be a blip on the chart. Longs will be well rewarded."
I set my new buy at 190 in my Ameritrade account.
"Ride hauling group in Southeast Asia to go public: [uber type]Lazada, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding (BABA). A GoTo IPO is expected later this year. ""These big four are plying their wares in basically the same sandbox,"" says Brendan Ahern, chief investment officer at exchange-traded fund provider KraneShares. ""It's a battle royale.""In other news {Barron’s}Mr. Ma and his sprawling e-commerce and payments empire have been the hardest hit so far, with Alibaba slapped with a record $2.8 billion fine by antitrust regulators in April."
June 2023 - 270 strike - call options - keep an eye on them if you like to add more risk (compared to just buying stocks).
"And were back at 220, maybe 4th time is the charm for 250."
"At this point, What will move the stock up on Earnings Day isn't numbers, but a shoring up of investor confidence. This can be in the form of positive guidance for 2022, >$3B share buyback, or big-name value investors filing 13Fs with Baba included. BTW, I think there's actually a decent chance of missing the lofty Q4 expectations."
Some sit said earnings after hour today. They should delete the info. 2 more weeks.
"The relentless bashing by Reuters and Bloomberg on this company is unprecedented...In my view, that indicates accumulation by the well to do. Think realistically...not with the flow. It doesn't work where greed is concerned. In my view..."
might probably get pinned under $210 whole day because of those weekly calls expiries...
this fine can be paid out of funds already held.. this will not hurt the company in the long term
"John Freeman of CFRA is a big short, he made a move last year to short Alibaba, his intention is to short it down to $180, his followers including JimmyZ aka Joseph, Benjo, value stock investor, kihong, and among other. I urge everyone long here don't lisen to John Freeman and continue to bet against this thug。"

"Today Alibaba Group received the Administrative Penalty Decision issued by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) of the People’s Republic of China. We accept the penalty with sincerity and will ensure our compliance with determination. On this occasion, the entire team at Alibaba would like to express our gratitude to the trust and patience that our merchants, consumers, partners and shareholders have given us. We would like to share our thoughts and plans for the long-term healthy development of our business in the future."
Let’s go
"KEEP listening to those TV pitch men on CNBC and other Business stations !!!! Put all your trust in them , to speak the Truth !!!!! Then , send all your cash to China and buy more Baba shares on the DIPS !!! Yes, there are plenty more Dips coming in the future for BABA BAGHOLDERS !!!!!!!!!!!!"
How does usa inflation hurt a business inside China?
"Some bears can’t even read financial reports Read it clear ! Cash per share is around $170!Excluding cash Baba is priced at $50/share only , which is 5 years earning. It is ridiculously low. Buy as much as I can."
Dont let a bloomberg article written by a journalist trying to get maxium views deter you from a sound investment which ticks all the boxes for fundamental analysis and technical analysis.... there is literally no better intrinsic value stock in the market than BABA
"HK almost more expensive than NYSE Price, LOL."
"My feeling says that once we break some technical barriers, whenever that is, there will be a turnaround in sentiment providing the liquidity for a consecutive second run upwards. Like a two-stage rocket. Once we go, we go fast. Hopefully the March results can push us through the barriers."
"I expect red from HK tonight, usual end of week action for them. -My assumption is Volume starts to accrete on Monday NYSE, and only with volume will we get an accompanying SP increase. -ER will beat top and bottom and add a pop to SP, but if there is only limited accompanying volume, we will likely remain in the existing sub $235 channel, partially due to macro sabre rattling. -I really hope they give Ant news Thursday morning, that’s the SP tailwind. JMHO and GL"
"What happened today to the Great Baba shares ???????? Soon , back to negative territory !!!!! Sell !!!!!!!!"
If a test of the 50 dma holds it looks to be fairly clear sailing to $265-270 in to earnings in a month or so. It'll be interesting to see where the option players line up for Friday's expiration.
Buy and hold.
I’m a buyer @190
"When you buy shares of Baba, you are buying shares of communism"
Every long (including me) is feeling fearful. Just picked up more at $213.50.
"China will dominate Asia for a long time, BABA will dominate its sphere for a long time! Time to buy is now, time to sell is never"
"How many of you are aware that Generation Investment Management, the firm co-founded by Al Gore, purchased 1,544,863 shares of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), giving the stake 1.6% weight in its equity portfolio. Shares averaged $227.43 during the fourth quarter. Charlie Munger bought a mere $40B ( Average price of $245 & 19% of the daily portfolio ).This is going back to the $300's where it belongs soon !"
"Very soon it will be the "" COUP DE GRACE"" for BABA SHARES !!!!!!! Oh WELL ! They had their day in the SUN !!!!!!!!"
It should rise 2-3% at least today in NY based on Chinese data. Let’s see how this unfolds.

You’re all waiting for a bus that ain’t coming. Missing out on the great Bull market.....How sad : (
I love how we're all cheering at $213....when this would've been a nightmare price two weeks ago
Fire sale!!! What an opportunity to buy the dip!!
All former beaten down high fliers are up double digits today with the exception of BABA of course. Broken stock.
People please remember that Facebook stock went to record highs in 2019 after that 5 billion fine because it removed clouds of uncertainty. It was then said that Facebook got off easy again. I am hoping this should mark the bottom for Chinese mega tech firms and should only go up from here.
"AaplMsftamznFbGoogl They all beat, you know what that mean for baba? "
"So, we're back in the 220s despite the long-awaited positive outcome of the investigation. Starting to lose faith in human mankind.."
Thinking about buying BABA now. My family in China told me they have big news coming soon. To be or not to be. But seeing it going down hold me back a little. I was told by earnings it will be 300. Any ideas guys ?
Last quarter's estimated YOY revenue growth is 67.40%
"Al Gore's Generation Investment Management purchased an additional 1,452,645 shares of BABA ( an increase of 94% ) in the last quarter at an average of $245.98. In 4th Quarter, they initiated BABA holdings by buying 1,544,863 shares at an average price of $227.43. Total shares owned by GIM is now 2,997,508 (2.85% of their portfolio - $679,625,000). What makes me think that they are not done with buying BABA? We will know on Aug 15 if they purchased additional shares of BABA during this Quarter."
"5 & 20 day SMA broken thru; finding support at its 50 day SMA (243.25) but I think it'll break as momentum is strong; RSI (61+) is still NOT in oversold territory. However, there will probably be strong resistance at its 100 day SMA of 248.54; we may have some consolidation for a few days but once the 100 day is breached, BABA's 200 day SMA of 260 will be next level of resistance. Once this level is breached, 300 will be the next psychological barrier. Regardless, this is very good for the bulls of which I am one of them."
"Funny that China keeps hitting one of their very good companies and do so right before earnings. Stay will energy, commodity plays - also casino plays like Goldrich Mining/grmc on the bet their mine report is very positive....commodities are the new FAANGS. Also cisco/csco and Seagate/stx remain solid tech in a risk off tech market. Boolean"
"The valuation of US stocks suggest that in the next 10 to 15 years the annualised return will be sub -0,4% annualised. In HongKong the current valuation suggests an annualised return between 5% and 6%.Based on CAPE and PB. Add oil, my friends."
"Revenue keeps growing yearly at 40% rate and the fine is a one time event.I feel sorry for all the kids selling today, you are gonna regret hard in 5 years."
"-Thursday ER is shaping up as a tug of war. -On the left side of the rope is Naz (tech) sell-off, trade relation spats, and China regulatory uncertainty (ANT direction, Jack?, Govt concerns of tech market power) versus the right side of Baba $$ fundamentals, positive China macro financials, and future opps (Cloud, digital currency, etc.). -For months now, the rope's centrepoint has been pulled to the left.Need volume to increase into Thursday and then the ER and Management guidance should give us some answers that contribute to SP lift. Hopefully."
"Good! Now the Ant issue is out of the way, expectations are set from the CCP banking regulators and full clarity has been provided.All the cards are finally laid out on the table. Stock should be back in the $250s by weeks end."
Will be back up at $270 by June
Berkshire should buy some BABA!!
Baba was just fined by Chinese government for approximately 2.8 B us dollar. I will open a position next week and start buy the dip.
Alibaba price 3000 USD in 2030
I'm sniffing a 230 by 18 june 2021
"Volume dried up at 210, nobody wants it even at this price. Will go down further, when market fall or when shorties add again...Tomorrow at 200 at most. Next week 180., next month 150. Shorties paradise"
Bloomberg bashing again; and when they do about 3 weeks later good news comes out and we go higher
"For old-timers (still holders of AABA).Here's the latest I just heard from Altaba IR.Hi ..........The Delaware Chancery Court held a hearing on April 20-22, 2021 and has scheduled another hearing for May 28, 2021. The Court will issue one or more final orders as it resolves the issues. We do not know when the Court will issue its final orders. Altaba cannot guarantee the amount or timing of any future distributions. Regards,Becky"
"Everyone thinks that great earnings will be the saving grace for this stock. You realize that EVERYONE expects the earnings report to be fantastic right? Nobody has ever criticized this company for its earnings and growth, but for all the risk and uncertainty surrounding it - both from China, and from the US.I believe an amazing earnings report is already expected and priced in. That means a great report will give us a small boost, maybe 2-3%. Anything even sort of resembling an earnings/growth miss will be devastating, perhaps bringing us even below $200. More downside than upside in the short term here."
since IPO 7 years ago in 2014 baba is up 123% vs. qqq up 226%. Invest in america and get better gains and sleep good at night.
Thumbs up if you think BABA pps will be higher than 1000$ in 2030.
"amzn is more expansive, and tons of company is trying to compete. Baron is wrong"
Little surprised the BABA is taking a hit since it is already past all these regulatory issues - BABA should be on the upside. All the research firms have the value significant higher. This could probably still be in the green later today
Even a company like Exxonmobil is trading at multiples closer to tech companies. Exxonmobil is not a tech company!
"Logging out for the day, Will check on this place intermittently. But know that I will be accumulating shares and calls( Jan 2022 300 strike) if this dips further. This is a long term play and you need patience. BABA and Tencent are two of the very few stocks in this mkt that are cheap but still offer great growth. Good luck and ignore Jimmy and his dozens of other spamming handles. Again, check his post history to see how wrong he has been on this stock and AAPL the past 3+ yrs before he deleted his history."
"eps of 9 with 20 billion share makes about 190b. is this eps meant for quarters or for full year?? im not sure, im a noob at stockmarket "
"The 2021 slide continues...the month of March was not kind for BABA losing another $13.40...and it was really the final two weeks that turned the tide against BABA...Week of March 1-5 - down $3.87Week of March 8-12 - down $2.02Week of March 15-19 - UP $7.92Week of March 22-26 - down $12.53Week of March 29-April 1 - down $2.90For the year, BABA is now down about 3.6% (or down $8.37)...it seems a lot worse...but BABA roared into 2021 and was up $25.89 over the first three weeks of the year. So that helped cushion this slide. Since then...BABA is down 7 of the past 10 weeks since then. Let's hope BABA springs back to life as Spring begins."
just here to preemptively laugh at bears
"Expectations for earnings on this board and with analyst are really high and everyone silently is also hoping for a beat of these already high earnings expectations. Although I really have the stock for long term, strongly believe in the fundamentals and know they will deliver great results...changes are that the stock price will respond negatively. We really need news about Ant (which I don’t expect) or massive stock buy back in the last quarter or start of paying dividends to have a big positive response. Sorry to be a little but careful, let’s hope that I’m wrong."
Move towards 180 has just begun. Selling is just beginning.
Give me the next 2 trillion company for 600 billion PLEEEEEEASE COME ON short it LOOOOL
Short squeeze about start. ￼ ￼
"At these levels, this stock is really cheap. P/E current year is less than 19, forward P/E is around 15x."
Stock is now below the level before they’ve been fined. With no fundamental reason at all.
"Alibaba stock price is so strong now, that even with 55% institutions selling we are climbing the ladder."
HSI is going to increase the weighting of BABA from 5.59& to 7.33%. There will be more upside on this stock as institutions need to buy shares to balance their indexes before 7Jun.
My Updated Shares reflecting pre-market gains. Way better than 40K loss. This is for Jimmy Z :Dhttps://imgur.com/a/00qjOWK
"Now that the fine is done, and some regulatory clarity is here, next step is for Ant! But get ready for bearish delisting BS to be pushed by Luddites in a wrongheaded effort to stop this train. Although some systemic risk is there given South China Sea provocations, cooler heads will prevail."
"Estimations about earnings and revenue growth are about 40% and 70%. No matter if Alibaba beats it or not, growth will be massive. Really hope to hear something about dividend, buybacks or excellent cooperation with Chinese regulators. Growing cloud profit margins would be nice as well."
215 has been broken :)
wouldn't doubt that china's stance on crypto effecting baba today as well as granthom cutting his position.
When did Alibaba file bankruptsy?
Ive watch and owned this for awhile. I think the problem is looking at this company thru the lens of America economy. Baba will never be an amzn or even remotely close to it. Yes the potential is there only when you are looking at it thru the eyes and ears of the greatest weath generator ever known to mankind. When reevaluating upon its own merits its probably is 50% overvalued based purely on accounting and china. Ill still hold but i doubt this will ever reach over 300 in the next 10 years.
baba $250 in a blink........in 10 years will be bigger than AMZN
Nice performance and especially turn around in stock price. Let’s hope we have finally seen the bottom and that earnings are as good (or even better) then most expect. Good luck and keep holding strong.
Bought the dip
"Unless you are from China, it really doesn't make any sense to invest in Chinese Companies where the country bring pandemic to the world, threating the world peace, and the Chinese government do not want any companies still their limelight from them. ANT IPO is dead as Chines government want to control the financial industries. You have been wared. This stock is only worth $20 3 years from now once it has been delisted in US."
May 2018 revenue 250B pps 190; May 2021 revenue 717B pps 210. Question what pps should be in May 2021 if revenue nearly tripled?
"For long-term investors, BABA stock offers potentially one of the most compelling opportunities on the market today. Alibaba is perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime buying opportunity at existing levels. On a forward-looking basis, it might be reasonable to expect BABA stock to trade well more than $500 per share."
today we will close at: $240 today the market is bull.
What a great earnings!!
Geez. Bouncing all over. Expecting a big move one way or the other
Bloomberg hit the nail on the head . This type of investigation would take years in the USA in China 4 months. That puts an end to uncertainty. Now do get it?
lol baba hk is up 7%.. most probably this is going open high later
"I think it will be dropping for a couple of days on bad earnings prospects but then they announced expanding capex, so revenue will likely continue to grow impressively - guess will start rebounding again next month."
"China's online retail sales maintained steady growth in the first quarter (Q1) of the year as the economy further recovered from the impact of COVID-19.In the January-March period, online retail sales went up 29.9 percent year on year to 2.81 trillion yuan (about 434.5 billion U.S. dollars), according to data released by the Ministry of Commerce."
Fine is .45% of market cap. Stock was down 2.1 % just today!
Got my 10% prediction in the AH. Thanks BABA. I’m going to Disneyland 
"It won't stay down here forever, there will be movement between China and USA. They will get together on this one."
way oversold. revenue outlook is outstanding. next quarter the eps numbers are clean. if you have a horizon beyond a few quarters the equity will go higher.
Two scary words for longs: PCAOB and delisted.
"Goodnight everyone, see you tomorrow when Alibaba is up 9+% per market. Volume 50 million tomorrow."
manipulator has complete control over the stock . Someday they will take it up like they took it down on xmas eve . when you least expect it
"BABA may keep beating top line, missing bottom line, but it’s being squeezed by the competition....competition that is being promoted by the government. Which is honestly healthy for the Chinese ECommerce ecosystem. BABA is no longer original and has become tone deaf; Ma is no longer involved and has been muted. Competition has been growing and it’s been predicted that they will lose their title of largest eCommerce by Q3-4 2022. See other e-commerce growth companies. I will not promote them. Grab a few shares here but you will absolutely get a better price when this breaks below 200. Stop listening to the brethren on this page promoting horrible mantra of its potential. It’s not about potential, it’s about price action, and the price action and technicals have broken down. Do not buy until this hits at least 183 ish support. Good luck to all."
This will dump after earnings regardless of results. It always does.
Hopefully Thursday is when earnings finally drive this stock significantly higher...it has been way too long a wait already and I see many funds betting now is when it happens. Watch Occidental Pet /oxy tomorrow and see if that play works out...also keep watching Goldrich Mining/grmc at 5 cents...my last buy was 3 cents as I said. Boolean
2.8 billions fine on a 600 billions market cap its a joke
"Revenue was RMB187,395 million (US$28,602 million), an increase of 64% year-over-year.Excluding the consolidation of Sun Art, our revenue would have grown 40% year-over-year toRMB159,952 million (US$24,413 million). Annual active consumers on our China retail marketplaces was 811 million for the twelve monthsended March 31, 2021, an increase of 32 million from the twelve months ended December 31, 2020. Mobile MAUs on our China retail marketplaces reached 925 million in March 2021, an increase of23 million over December 2020. Loss from operations was RMB7,663 million (US$1,170 million) due to a RMB18,228 million(US$2,782 million) fine levied by China’s State Administration for Market Regulation pursuant toChina’s Anti-monopoly Law (the “Anti-monopoly Fine”). Excluding this one-time impact, ourincome from operations would have been RMB10,565 million (US$1,612 million), an increase of48% year-over-year.

"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME --- THIS IS REAL MONEY IF YOU BUY THIS :Credit Agricole SA on Friday posted a sharp increase in net profit for the first quarter, as revenue rose and provisions for potential credit losses fell. France's second-largest listed bank by assets reported a 64% increase in quarterly net profit to 1.05 billion euros ($1.27 billion). Revenue rose 5.6% to EUR5.49 billion, while loan-loss provisions fell 38% to EUR384 million. Profit increased across the bank's key divisions.

Do you want 5% profit next week ? + Dividends week after 6% ? If yes ... there 2 French banks very cheap now . Their share prices low because today USA said banks are not good by Apple and Google .... Check if you do not believe My number 1 is CREDIT AGRICOTE (64% profit increased in 1q 2021) ...number 2 is BNP Paribas (P/E 9.6 when US banks 20-60 ) .... This is very good chance to make easy money
"My messages getting deleted. I repeat 137. Today EU cancelled CAI with China. That's duty free export. That's why BILI, PDD, BABA and many were pumped last year. BABA and Tencent r going to be hit hardest."
https://www.google.de/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN2C40ABIs that positive?
I'm so glad I own this stock in the mid-170s. but frankly I'm sick and tired of this thing. I think if this thing ever runs to the 290s or 300 like it did before I'm going to reduce the position by 25%
"The fact that this stock has a market cap of only $580 billion is absolutely absurd. And anyone with any investment savvy knows this...However, I think we all know that until this relentless hedge fund/financial institution short attack relents....we will not see a realistic price scenario. This will likely occur once wealthy money is long...at the bottom. In my humble view."
"CFRA initiated a sell on both BIDU and BABA this morning. This double ""kitchen sink"" sell downgrade of 2 stocks that just posted good quarterly numbers, is absurd...and in my opinion a transparent effort to aid heavy hedge fund shorts and accumulators of the stock, in a last ditch effort to cover or buy. The fact that they included both companies in this sell downgrade, tells the story clearly. It's strange how this firm comes out with their ""suspicious"" ratings, when there happens to be hedge funds heavily short...and or heavy institutional/wealth/affluent accumulation. There's no doubt to me that this was to assist someone on the short side. In my humble view."
Buffet wouldnt buy a chinese stock controlled by communist government. That is not anywhere near his style.
"Wow, heavy buy volume today"
"Hangzhou, China, April 30, 2021 - Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE: BABA and HKEX: 9988, “Alibaba” or “Alibaba Group”) today announced that it will report its unaudited financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 before the U.S. market opens on Thursday, May 13, 2021, and will hold a conference call to discuss the financial results at 7:30 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (7:30 p.m. Hong Kong Time) the same day."
"bouncing back, tomorrow will be green"
"JMIA closed GREEN on Higher than usually volume. While unfortunately the DOW, S&P, NASDAQ, $MELI, $ETSY, $WISH, $OZON, $EBAY, $BABA, $CPNG closed RED.Shows a base has formed and buyers are here to stay. There will still be a battle with the short but the fundamentals are on the Longs side. Since JMIA is heavily shorted and over sold any buying pressure will send the stock soaring."
"The problem with these stocks is that every single day, the Communist Party can wipe of 15% or more off your investment with the stroke of a pen. $BABA $BIDU $JD"
buy now or wait for 200 ?
BABA is now basically moving on with double digit growth rates and no turning back !$275 by end of April
We will cross Charlie Munger's average price tomorrow ( $245 USD is his average price ). BABA owes it to him :-)EOW $275 at this rate !
Qingming Festival in China. buyers will be back on 4/7..$235-$240 in 3 days. Let's go.
"Could be worse, we could've bought bitcoin at $63,000"
Checking China consumer statistics. It is setting up very well with increase consumption.
"The last week of May 2021 expiration 28 May, there will likely be a retrace to a level below 225 USD. Exact number is not yet predictable, because of the low number of options currently in the last week of May."
"GOODBYE , $210.00 !!!!!!!!!! HELLO $200.00 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"OK, HK; your move next."
"The stock was worth EUR 207 on Jan 13, 2020. The stock is worth EUR 188 now, 16 months later (@ Xetra Frankfurt).EU stockholders have lost 10% due to devaluation of USD. Meanwhile, there was a bull market and EPS grew by about 30%..."
At least she showed a little life at the end of the (HK) day. I'll be buying tomorrow (And trying to catch the bottom in NY).
At least 10% on Monday
"a TON of puts have been bought moving the max option pain from 230 all the way down to 222,5 USD.Good news probably to see so many puts bought, once retail sentiment switches to bearish, moneymakers will step in."
Are we going to end that day in the green? The secret is to start in the red. Lol
"Alibaba in HongKong is currently trading at 239,4 HKD or 246,28 USDIt's party time!"
"So funny how the news makes the fine sound way worst than it is. Companies like JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Apple, etc have all been popped by substantial fines thats are little blips on their books because of the amount of revenue they generateand cash on hand they have.Truthfully, China let Baba off easy and slapped them on the wrist. They could have smoked them for 5x this amount.A message was sent. Everyone can move on."
Today alone 42B added to Marketcap.. so the peanut fine $2.8B really worth. To clear the way along
"Looks like Jack Mao is neglecting capitalists, what a surprise!"
Ut-oh. Dudes back down again...
"Everybody on panic mode. Am I the only one who just doesn't care about CCP, US or other news? This is a no brainer. I will be holding at least for 5 years and in the meanwhile watch poor investors lose their patience with this. Patience is a virtue."
relatively low volume so same maipulators we see on a daily basis.
"The only positive thing is that the volume is way up, should surpass 3 month average volume by close"
i can go all in if it gets @ 200
Same pattern. Seen it many times before. Down pre market and up 5 points during trading session. BABA is number one e commerce In China. This is one stock u need to give it time to make $. We will be see 240 very soon.
ANT leapfrogs to top fund sales. Still high margins
I would expect a big rise of the share price because the uncertainty is over.
"What gives? All my Chinese stocks are down today: bidu, nio, iq, and yrs truly."
I have completed the rewiring of BABA so now we should see a surge tomorrow when the power is turned back on...OK... Boolean
i put an order yesterday at 205... missed it
"If you’re looking for a watchlist covering the great stock setups every day before the open, I recommend https://tradepicker.today/h5ju9d They send daily set ups and its free. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"P/E is close to 20. For a growth stock it's cheap (just compare to AMZN). Yes, there's political risk, but FAANG stocks get fined yearly by the EU and others for billions, so what..."
"Crazy, baba keeps underperforming the broader market. Especially it’s quote at Wallstreet. Seems like big funds are still selling day after day and the market can’t absorb it...waiting for better times (and tomorrow increasing my position wen new funds get in)."
"First day of low volume since ER is a red day, not worried. Every hk holiday leads to a bad baba day. Not sure why just an observation"
Short squeeze is coming today at your screen! LOL!
"Just like I said....a triple bottom then lower to trigger sell stops then up. Its how its done. Now....if there is no damaging news from the libhouse or the CCP, BABA will test 240 for a breakout this year at some point . HFT Trade firms will still move it up and down because it pays them really really well . Millions per day. Now who doubted me and called me names ? Begins with a T ........"
Definetly keep. Easily going to300.
earnings countdown...
At a 15% revenue growth over the next 5 years PE is around 9 LOL
I just have to keep telling myself to be patient here. There is no fundamental reason that a company like this won't see huge jumps in SP now that most of the anti-competitive concerns with the Chinese government are behind them. A blowout quarterly report in early May could be the catalyst to this taking off
How is it possible that a company with 64% growth has 52 weeks low with 19 P / E ??? It can only happen on Wall Street.
"All this company does is produce and go lower. That is not accurate, it also shoots up like a rocket too. Hang in there"
BABA to $260... buy with confidence. Boom.
"Looks like I can buy some more sub $9 on $SDC after all!! Come on sellers!! Sell in May and go away!! I’ll be buying in May and socking away for a rainy day!!! Also buying $AAPL, $COIN, $HOTH $BABA $CNK $AMC $LL $VIAC $ZM $PRVB and $SBUX to name a few!!"
If recent low of $213.00 does not hold then we could test sub $200.00. Maybe $190 range? Great long term buy and hold at any price imo.
"Stop to cry about the price, this is the best company to hold for the next decade. That’s all!"
"Why do people care so much about the delisting issue?Tencent is ""delisted."" So what if BABA joins them? Am I missing something here? Just trade your BABA shares OTC like you do TCEHY. Problem solved..."
"Down on a down day after a big rise on Monday. Nothing wrong and just hold on. Earnings day is coming closer and everyone wants to take position before. Keep tight, it will go up, time is finally our friend."
"Someone just bought 1,000 280call options 1/21/22 for $1065 each. A million dollar bullish bet"
Current US administration views strategic competition with China as the most important goal. BABA listed in NYSE would be a medium to achieve the goal. Selling American products through BABA online would be an example. Access to massive China consumer markets through BABA online would be essential.
The Great and Wonderful JImmy Z has once again shown himself to be correct on predicting the baba pullbacks. YOU would do well to listen.Appreciate the warnings!!
Mega green tomorrow
Confucius Sez......I See A Lot OfTIMMMMMMMMMBERR TODAY !
Nasdaq recovering tomorrow would give extra power to an eventual earnings pump.
"it will be great to let cathie explain why she abandoned $ BIDU and long $ JD, looks she doesnt care $BABA much these days... all look undervalued but perform poorly recently..."
"Great report, that's all you need to know! - the next 3 years will be great reports too!"
BABA Revenue in 2018 - 250 B CNY Stock price : 208. BABA revenue today : 730 B CNY Stock price : 207. Screaming Buy. This stock will give more return than Apple and MSFT in next 5 years.
I quoted my price $137 on this..months ago. Asked u to jump.
"Not sure why investors have to worry about Chinese regulation audit on Technology companies, it just make Alibaba operation better in legal way. Fundamental facts are good such as economic and online expenses growth significantly last quarter, that would help Alibaba. Chinese government wanted its technology companies pass US’s, not getting behind or destroy them"
"Very cheap stock price / book .59 , I’m buying with any pullback!!!!!!!"
RSI 26.31 now
Was HK on vacation today?
Adding at 218.75USD. Maybe not the bottom but wowzer that's cheap. Easily 50prc upside vs. limited downside.
"I had the same with micron. Traded on a pe of 5, wouldn't move. At one point I got sick of it and sold for 35, because I was waiting for months. Now, it's 90. This is the same, we need more patience but in the end, this will be a winner"
It's good news that Charlie both Baba. But always good to keep things in perspective. 1. He only bought 165k shares which is peanuts for him. 2. He bought at a low price. So if the stock continues to show volatility he will simply sell it n still make a reasonable profit. What is more important is we see a general uptrend to this stock. Let's hope it rises in hk n by follows suite.
Growing company!! Heading to $1000
Yet again Baba outperforms the NASDAQ.
"Will load up more if this is down on Monday. Need to take advantage of this cheap share price, if you can buy and hold you’ll thank yourself greatly when looking back. Too strong of a company, this isn’t NIO. Solidified and supported by its financials."
"All my Charts and Spreadsheets , continue to see Baba shares going lower !!!! Congrats , to all those former BABA shareholders who dumped all their shares !!!! I would like to hear from all of you on here today !!!!!!!!!!!!"
it really sad how desperate some of the shorters are here... surely you can find better ways to make money than spamming here all day long?... how about spending the time reading and learning about value investing i'm sure it will work out better for you in the long run.
I'm holding my shares for $240 in a few months.
Bought some today for $206.65. The MACD and RSI are still showing possible downward trend towards the next resistance of about $196. Great stock to hold LONG TERM !!!
"Benjo is not even short , he’s just all in on TLT . Which is why he spends his days bashing any and all equities. I added a bit more at 219. Still see a lot of value here ."
BABA has traded 100% on regulatory risk for the last 6 months. Nobody has even considered the fundamentals.
Chinese economic output in the first three months has GDP up 18.3% YTD. 18.3%!!! BABA will blow away current expectations. We are likely currently trading at 15x forward PE.
$240 tomorrow.
How’s bag holders holding on to the fading away tiny gain 
"$300 soon, perhaps even $1,000"
220 seems like to floor. Hesitating to buy but it’s very tempting to keep averaging down here
So let us all take a count of how much money BABA share holders lost again today !!!! Another full 2 Percent !!! Keep it up !!!!!!!!!!!!
"They fined BABA $2.8 billion and it went up 8% the next day. Anyone who thinks that shuffling around Jack Ma's Ant shares is a negative event is just nuts. No disrespect intended, but Mr. Ma is great for tabloids and message boards, where he provides clicks and revenue. Shorts and bashers need to create a new story, because this one only works on the weakest of hands."
"However, he expects “some kind of compromise” to be eventually reached on the regulatory front.“Going forward, their valuations might not be, you know, 50 or 60 times of earnings. Still ... they’re trading at around 30 times of earnings and they are at a very good position in China,” Wong said.He was referring to price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio — a measure of a company’s stock price relative to its earnings. A high P/E ratio could indicate an expensive stock price compared to its earnings.Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed stock had a P/E ratio of 26.34 while Tencent’s P/E ratio was 33.36, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon.In comparison, some U.S. tech stocks have much loftier valuations. Amazon and Netflix have P/E ratios of 75.71 and 91.6, respectively, while Tesla’s stands at more than 1,000. At least China’s does not talk $@^+%!¥@& about their￼ Companies"
"Who knows what will happen next, nearly everyone on here has been proved wrong The facts are that the SP is almost unchanged since Jan 2018"
This stock has essentially lost all the pandemic gains and is back to 2019 levels.
That was a funny post. Why did Jimmy_Zzzz and his 3 other profiles flag it? Awww shucks.
In for 100 shares... thank you.
"Keep buying more shares on the Dips !!!!!! Plenty of Dips coming today , and the rest of the week too !!!!!!!!!"
"I'm seeing a $0.20 miss, $1.58 vs an estimated $1.78."
"Uncle Buffet will join his buddy Charlie buying Alibaba shares, mark this post"
"BABA is fined for antitrust behaviour. It will bot just about the rmb 18bn fine, but BABA no longer can force the merchants to select only one e commerce platform and is now facing more fierce competition from PDD, JD, ByteDance , Kuaishou."
"Positive note: Alibaba is holding up quite well considering what Tencent (-4%), PDD (-10%), JD (-5%), Baidu (-4%) experience today. It's showing we're really close to the bottom, if not there already. Just too bad the whole tech environment is quite toxic at the moment."
BABA hit its head twice in the last month on its 50 dma and was repelled each time. That 50 dma is now down to $232. It will need to get above that level and stay above to establish any kind of upside momo.
"Don't listen to the other guy talking about gaps ( he must be talking about the gap between his ears).The only gap that matters now is the gap from 4/12, which has now been filled. We are also above 230 which is long term support. Next stop is to break resistance at 245."
"Just came back from Looking at my charts of BABA Estimates !!!!! Looks like another ""DISMAL DOWN DAY"" for shareholders !!!!! $210.00 a share by close of BUSINESS on THURSDAY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The reason for today's BABA down so far today is not BABA-specific, but it appears industry-wide issue. One indication is that Tencent is down worse than BABA so far. So, it is not time to fold, you've got to relax, take a deep breath, and hang on."
Zero percent. That’s how much a full year of baba ownership has returned during the best market in decades. Zero percent. Zero. Zero. Zero. 0%. Zero.
"wow, are we going ot end in red today....while the whole market is up up up"
$300 by friday?
"Does not look good at all for BABA shares !!!!!!!! All my charts look the same !!! Soon, $ 200.00 Dollars , then , $190.00 !!!!!!!!!!!"
Time to get away from American growth stocks and look to players like Alibaba.
it's fun watching people who invest in Chinese stocks lose their money. keep propping up the communists!
Just hold tight until earnings guys. Not surprised if we trade in the $235-$245 range until then. Earnings will be an enormous catalyst upward
BABA should be seen by Social Services as the abuse it has been submitted to is beyond anything yet seen in Equity markets...stocks like FACEBOOK that are as abusive don't get anything even with all the rhetoric against it....BABA should be over 1k a share and not suffering as it has. So tired of this...I am winded. Boolean

Accelerating the economic development of China’s countryside, where about 36% of its 1.4 billion-strong population lives, has long been a priority of Chinese President Xi Jinping."
"I'm buying more, thank you to everyone selling :D"
Below 200 this week? I don’t want to buy too early as 190 may be possible?
Great growth!!
What's up with Zacks calling BABA a strong sell?
Who sell at this price!??
My BABA is literally lagging everything else I own. But when she catches up....
"May 13, 2021 7am eastern time baba to announce earnings........"
"Very frustrating. Basically all gains from yesterday given up. Who knows what next week brings. Might be more flat and basically not move at all, if people will be scared of pushing up the stock price beyond $210 incase of a dump like this."
I sold and took a hit on this one lost 900$ what scared me was the vie structure but then after doing further research I think the likelihood of the chiness wiping out US/ CHINA SHAREHOLDERS IS 0% If I do come back in BABA it will be at 200$ and It would be 2% MAX of my Portfolio
234.20 in HK = 241 in USD. More then 1% gain when compared to Friday close on Wall Street.
"For some reason, whenever I buy at support, that support NEVER holds."
BABA bag holders
Looks like the BABA Buyback wall is set for HK230.00.
who is still holding this from $300 days ? comment with how much stcks? any topped up at the bottom?
"Only $9.00 more dollars to go , before it hits $210.00 !!!!!!!!! We are almost there !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I am adding shares today before the ER see what happens.
"Ant Financial remains in a great space now as an FHC in China it is now equivalent to a JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, ects. Because their blockchain technology and data center business is advancing at an exponential rate they will likely become more valuable than before Bejing made this request. Now that China has settled its issue with BABA and Ant Finacial is to become an FHC the IPO could and should be announced soon because there is nothing wrong with any of their business. An immediate vertical incline for BABA to $400+ makes absolute financial market sense today. BABA should breach this target price no later than this week with no further resistance."
7th red day in a row. Unbelievable.
"Exciting how the stock will react, we will see it in Hong Kong stock exchange. I hope bottom has been reached!"
buy buy buy
"Another low volume sell-off day like every other sell-off day below 240 and since the gap up last week on 50+ mill shares.Another day JimmyZ and his 2004 Yahoo Answers profile still wishing for doom. Use days like today as opportunities to accumulate shs/ call contracts like I am doing. In the long run, don't fight big tech and still relatively low lending rates."
BABA will definitely dip below 200 before earning. After the earning release BABA will trend even lower.
