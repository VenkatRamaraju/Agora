Recent headlines and conversations for DIS
"Disney, Fox shareholders approve $71B asset deal https://seekingalpha.com/news/3374992?source=ansh $FOX, $FOXA, $DIS"
"With a bit of inheritance money I've been learning about stocks. Much the novice and a relative dabbler but what I am investing is a good bit of money for me.So, my wife has owned Disney stock for years and done quite well out of it. We love Disney but I do get baffled by box office and park takings breaking records but price dropping after steady increases before. Seems counter intuitive.. Still, I've got a couple of positions I'm not happy with which will be sold very soon.. When I sell I was thinking of moving it to Disney. Thought I'd do that shortly before ER or if I see the price down to $140. Am I on the right track?"
"Well, DIS is dead money for at least 2 months. The coronavirus is just going to get worse, decimating a few of DIS’s revenue streams. The only silver lining is that the more ppl that stay home, the more traffic Disney+ should get"
Raya had one of the worst openings ever recorded for a major film producer.
"Investors obviously don't understand that the record sales are already priced into the current price. Everyone has known for a month this would be a record breaking movie and has run up the price accordingly. Movies are one time hits, not constant income."

"I think Disney+ should have a preregistration period. Maybe a month before launching. You could create an account, pay ahead of time, and maybe even set your preferences. That way when it launches you can just download the app and login. The consumer part of me wants this so I can start checking it out right away when it's available, and the investor part of me wants it so Disney can report on preregistration numbers. :)"
To the moon ... love this company
"Meanwhile, Zacks (a company I've actually heard of) upgraded their DIS evaluation from a Hold to a Buy."
I bought DIS at $33.96 and am still holding!
$200 incoming next month $220
"Why are people so shocked at the stock going down a little? The stock is up over $20 in a month! That is based on the hype of Disney+ and Avengers End Game projected numbers. It was overbought a little and there is some profit taking going on, movies are one time hits and Disney + is still just hype with no real numbers yet. It rose $20 based on this, enjoy the price, but it won't just keep going on up based on a one time hit of a movie."
"Disney's D23 advance subscriber discount went so well, that they are now offering a similar 2 and 3 year bundle for Disney credit card holders. The release of these advance subscriber numbers should put to rest any fears from Apple+."
Major trouble for Disney at these levels be very very bearish
Disney is now trading ABOVE what it was trading in MARCH OF 2019 $109. Dinsey+ wasn't even a zygote at that point. Zero revenue from parks right now. That $109 was 100% parks and movies. This makes no sense...I'm absolutely baffled as a disney shareholder. I was insuring against low $90's...this is crazy movement.
"DIS will never be like Netflix. First, DIS has a great library - no question. NFLX leadership is superior to DIS. DIS is burdened by the club of executives and directors. DIS is the steady growth, predictable and quietly run company. DIS is not about growth."
just changed my icon. hope you all like it
Saw Avengers Endgame yesterday. Was absolutely fantastic! 3 hrs of movie bliss. Side note read that Disney is interested in adding rights for Sunday Ticket to ESPN+. So so hope that works out. Would drive subscribers big time.
The run will continue. Buy. Hold. Chill.
Dis hasn't even open the park or small fleet of cruise yet but soon it's going to be . I can't wait till all cylinders are moving. it will be trading around 275
"I read most bullish article about Netflix in seeking alpha. Who thinkin 2021 - Netflix will have 143M international paying customer, 75M usa paying, Subscriber cost raise 20% , and expect interest cost will go lower than current, margin will double, will trade at 48 pe.All combine he still value company at $408 in 2021. then he argue trade $300 based on 10% discount model.Now Risk reward analysis of his way optimistic number still make this stock work $200 in my opinion. Sure if it continue grow even after $DIS entry and without disney content, could worth $400 in 2021 But that 3 year out. Why pay so much premium now."
Why isn't a good report with over a 100 million subscribers mentioned bringing this back over $200?
thoughts on the possible deal with $DIS http://snip.ly/mo5g3d
"Disney's Streaming Servicers will be raking in by the Bs. Their content strategy and host of linked TV(stream)-to-Movies-TV is an excellent execution strategy, plus their play on theme parks linked to new content is going to be amazing! Btw Avatar 2 onwards will be flying under the Disney flag after Fox was acquired. So are they worth today's numbers? I would honestly double it."
Do we eclipse 200 today
"Love Disney, but there's simply no way they beat in q2. No parks, no cruise line, no movies, no live entertainment, store closures... Am I really to believe that a $12.99 streaming subscription could keep all that above water? Looks to me like Remy the rat has been cooking the Mouse's books."
Waiting for more short sellers to push it higher.
"I'm going to start buying at 104, will buy heavier at 98. What are others buy ranges? Who thinks Disneyworld is delayed too? Anyone think the NBA season doesn't happen after all? In either of those scenerios I think we could pick up more stock in mid 90s but it will probably be a small window as people will buy heavy I suspect."
Holding Jun139s with a nice gainLoaded up some Aug 45s
"https://time.com/5834087/shanghai-disneyland-sellout/Not only California but in China as well.World is opening, Covid-19 is ending, Disney will rise huge.And right now stock price 200 dollar is during Covid-19, i can see this easily rise to 400 dollar end of 2021"
To infinity and beyond!!!
"Anyone claiming the recent ""rally"" in gold is somehow indicative of a downturn in the market is drawing conclusions.Why would a hedge fund invest in gold?Maybe because gold broke under 1300 and was priced to sell? Having a ""7 day rally"" means little if gold drops back under 1300.My guess, and it really is just a guess, gold couldn't reach 1350, so I wouldn't be surprised to see it back under 1300.Dis on the other hand had a strong bounce at 131, broke 137 today and could push back into 140 range. Im not bashing investing in gold... I just don't see any reason to sell off my Dis shares to do so."
Stocks are worth more in shutdowns. Might as well keep everything closed you make more money !
200 million plus subscribers are coming fast what don’t people not understand. Netflix laid the ground work for acceptance and anyone with a child understands the true value
Buy order set for 107.00 hopefully I get in
"hmmmm how is it this stock has so many sellers yet has so many buy ratings,,, what am i missing"
should i invest here $20.000 or is too expensive at that price?
With Disney+ announced when it takes off the stocks will follow. Buy now!
This stock being played big time by funds. Run up to earnings and regardless it will tank like apple so they can recoup their losses from reddit squeeze and thwn slow up to 200 by June imo. Glta
Subscribers are growing...LOLI would most probably sell on this news at this late in this roulette cycle.....LOL
"Wow... after that report only 1.56% UP??? This market primed up and ready to crash, y'all"
"Disney price targets by several analyst $225, it want take long to get there probably by summer, with parks doing wells."
Grats longs!Past couple months seemed brutal and full of folks predictions Dis would dip below 120 before ever hitting 145 again...Long and strong! 
"I can't believe how badly this company wants to destroy itself. I grew up with Star Wars and lost interest with the last three movies. I tried to like it but it's all political now and I just want to relax into an adventure. I started watching Mandalorian during season 2 and they gave one of the most iconic moments with the return of Luke Skywalker and I was actually excited about it again. Now they fire Gina Carano, who I've been following for years because of MMA, over some tweet? A tweet almost identical to another co-star? When are they going to realize the people that complain aren't their customers? I'm their customer and they just lost me again! They clearly don't care about investors as well otherwise they would be working to make actual fans happy. Fans spend money!"
Only 12 million vaccinated so far. You will see this stock at $300 BY FALL.
They should revamp Disney quest in MG to be an E-sports arena and theme park for cutting age VR and immersive experience!
Never seen a stock go up after a bad quarter and cutting it's entire dividend out.
Curious downgrade a day before earnings. Why jump before numbers and guidance being released next day. This is obvious manipulation. Saw a similar thing with FB on the Q4 earning release where on the earnings release day there was an analyst upgrade that pumped the stock and the earning disappointed and the stock crashed after earnings. Could this be a similar situation where it goes the other way?
Europe and India next month plus a bunch of new shows coming
load up on discount now
Added 50 more. Easy Money
"$GNUS $DIS BUYOUTs often happen on Mondays, so don’t miss out! Disney wasn’t able to create anything new during the pandemic and needs GNUS really bad! More than just the upcoming Stan Lee characters deal too!"
@Bob ...the next time CNBC asks you to do a post-earnings interview simply tell them I'm NA that day . . .
Even at $142 I still feel they're underestimating the potential subscriber base Disney + will have
I am not surprised if the share price gets cut in half from here by the end of April. Maybe we will see $30 by summer
Another good run for Dis today. Fingers crossed. Hope Dis hits 115 before the end of the week. 
where is Tommy
"Market place article just convinced me not to read any more of their garbage.There is nothing wrong with the economy and interest rates will not go up for a long while because the Fed done it's damage.The China trade will get worked out and if you go outside and look up, the sky has not fallen.Relax and enjoy the holidays!"
Dis spent a fortune on Star Wars land so they need to pack I. People and extend lines to pay the billions in loans back. As part of this they banned strollers and cut down trees to free up every inch for liner lines - sounds like a real dream vacation and it only costs $150 a person ( including kids) to wait in lines all day leading to a maximum of 4 rides
And as a new investor earlier in week I added more shares on open. Only regret was not getting in around 110 but that’s just nit picking given I’m long on this stock - years.
avengers has destroyed 1st day pretickets sales records in just 6 hours. This movie will be huge
Just a note of interest 1.9m shares traded after hours something’s brewing 
Getting ready to push high over 200 this week
I believe today's issue is the EU ruling re: SKY and the connection to FOX. This too shall pass. Solo & Avengers coming soon....
Media trying to downplay frozen 2 . “Those kids who saw the first frozen are grown now. No interest in seeing the sequel” they said.. just wait ! This Frozen 2 is going to smash box office records . Frozen is bigger now than it was when the first one came out
earning leak?
"Oversold on all time frames, this is worth at least $200.00 All these people selling will be back once all Marvel Original shows on Disney+ are released. The Mandalorian was just a taste of what's coming. Park Revenue will have a slow recovery but that part of the business is already priced in as dead IMO. $180 stock price is only the valuation for Disney+, Hulu, ESPN, ABC and all the other networks they own. Toy Sales and Licensing alone is a multi-billion dollar business and Disney literally owns every mainstream franchise. WAYUNDERVALUED"
Such a strong stock. I see this being a strong year for DIS.
You will be rewarded for your patience.
DIS is incredibly undervalued and has so much runway ahead of it. DIS has yet to scratch the surface of its streaming potential. Almost everyone who understands investing can see the potential of DIS simply by unlock their old business models and become leaders in online streaming through the offering of their vast media library and unmatched growth with new stories. For media or content they are one CEO away from becoming the TSLA or AMZN of all media entertainment. Their competition is giving them the opportunity of a generation.
Breaking through 200 day moving average on heavy volume. Is Disney streaming just a pipe dream?
"Disney has made me so much in profits, capital gains n options, I’m never abandoning Disney, they are the company that gave me the courage to invest in the market. Disney for life!!!!!!"
DIS held up well even in this fear based sell off
Been waiting a while for this run up!Nice
To all. The DRINKS ARE ON THE HOUSE
Expect another nice pop for the stock once Disney + goes live on Tuesday.
"60 million on welfare, 11 million unemployed, 160 million do not have $1000 in emergency funds yet Disney has 90 million new subscribers!"
"if this move is like last ER, then I suspect it to move upwards next week. it's just frustrating to see my calls crushed by IV . I believe in Disney but watching this stock is like watching paint dry. GLTA"
At $500 a share this would still be undervalued. I expect a lot of covering at earnings. If the stock gets some reddit yolo attention wouldn't be surprised if it hits big and shorts cover like crazy and boost the stock up to obscene levels but we will see.
Ok what is everyone’s call for trading after ER. I am going to say $95 then rally to above $100 to close the week.
Yup. He said he pretty much wants to be at Disney every day. He loves it and she does too.
400 in a year
"This stock, I tell ya. While the rest of the market has been rallying for months, I feel like I'm missing out on other opportunities."
Just bought another $380k worth at 101.95 let’s do this.
"What happens to DIS's earnings in 2Q and 3Q 2020?I just did a back of the napkins calculation for just 2Q 2020. Below is what I came up with. You can use your imagination for your own estimate of 3Q 2020. Even if Disney manage to open its parks and release movies, they will sustain even more significant operating losses because attendance will be down 50% to 80% and they will still have to pay the park stuff and show performers. If 2Q and 3Q top lines are 75% down, then, this whole year is a toast, 4Q will still be similar. I suspect that it doesn't matter how well contained Covid 19 will be by the end of the year, its damage to DiS financial results will be for the rest of 2020 because the Covid 19 present a systematic risk the health official in US, Asia, and Europe will not be able to justify. Today's downgrade by the analyst on the surface is a downgrade but in reality is to reassure to DIS investors that DIS will still have positive earnings of $2.90 per share. This certainly allows the big institutional investors who want to exit DIS enough time to get out if they have not got out already."
Anyone know how many Dis Subscriptions are the free for 1 year ones ? I know I got rid of mine after I had to pay for that terrible content.
maybe go back to outdoor movies again. more fun and room to play
I mean they only made 12 billion in movie sales this year and it took them a whole month to get 20 million subscribers to join their streaming service
re: dis sp > the short term chart vs long's sentiments/emotions shows the stock in a mid 140's base after the low 130's sp base dating back to this past summer = look for the next nice sp pop in feb with the next base being in the mid 150's aka 2-3 steps forward vs 1 back is all good from my long perspective.
Would like to see Disney crash super hard. Left is pumpin this so hard
Hair cut coming...you heard it here first
I have held Disney stock for over 30 years..back in the day when it used to hit 100 and split 4:1...my initial price was 15.50 and I now own over 1000 she's.... one of the best investments I ever made...150 around the corner...200 is possible
"DIS acquiring FOX is all but assured now! CMCSA hasn’t counter bid in past three weeks, and the announcement today that the DOJ APPEALS JUDGE’S DECISION ALLOWING AT&T-TIME WARNER MERGER"
Buy buy buy!
NOT Good for disney
Verizon has close to 50 million unlimited customers. So 50 million exposure right away plus international customers and non verizon customers. Watch Disney hit 100 million subscribers quick. Revenue will poor in end of 2020 from this.
Told you all that it wasn’t going to break after ER... said it would have a nice day going up to it. 100% right. You can read my messages. This will go down all the way till next earnings. Why would it go up? They wont have a better 1/4 than the last one and you know it. Good luck. My last Disney post. Feels good to be right.
"Just read an article on Seeking Alpha that basically said the outlook for Disney in 2019 is not good because streaming is going to cost them a lot of money. If we judge something on how much money it's going to cost instead of how much money it's going to bring in, then Netflix should be paying people to take their stock! I just don't get it. They are investing in streaming, of course it's going to cost money! Unless you are a short seller of DIS stock, I see absolutely no red flags here."
Buy during profit taking profit after good earnings
When is DIS going to start making Barbie movies???? They are the number 1 toy sell
"All I will say is that I do know explosives .....but when it comes to great companies and their stocks, sp basing and low volume, I have to say ""wait for it"" .....and I do not mean wait for some ending punch line to a youtube video clip ....but rather the DIS sp explosion going into november < eom but remember this post on a yahoo msg board >"
"If in a couple years Disney announces amazing earnings and reports great stats on streaming and we are still at 110, then I'll start to worry. Until then, who cares what the price is! People who complain that DIS has been flat for the past few years are not looking into the WHY. If you look at the reason investors lost interest in DIS, then you'll see that Disney is fixing it. The only reason it is still within the 100-120 range is because investors want to see results before they build trust. Those who lost trust have doubt that the way Disney is fixing the problem will work, so we are not out of the weeds yet. Personally I never lost trust, so I'm just holding tight."
Love waking up to Green. Let's do $135 today? Ramp up to the Avengers weekend?
Who bought in above $180? Lols.
"Good luck tomorrow peeps. Im sure there are lots of people hoping Dis will make a solid move one way or the other. Get that money!Im not gonna lie... I would really like an opportunity to load up around 135-137 before earnings...I really don't know if that will happen. But whatever, I'm happy with my position and looking forward to the next few months before Dis+Untill then, get that paper peeps!"
Ready to climb. Mark my words.
23 mil subscribers confirmed. On the halftime report on CNBC yesterday (answers your questions segment) analyst Margaret Reid noted that the Disney + app has been downloaded 23 million times as of last week. Higher than expected. By earnings should at least be 30-45 million. Disney’s goal was to have 60-90 mil subscribers by 2024. It is feasible they could hit half their target by earnings in Feb. Amazing! Why aren’t more outlets reporting this?
"22 million downloads only on phones. Image when we add iPads, roku, fire, smart TVs. We hit over 50 million downloads. 175 coming fast!"
3.2 million Disney plus apps downloaded on launch day in Australia alone
Don't get tricked by hedge funds.... They are trying to rip off your stocks shares. WHy premarket up so much and now down when whole market is up? It's been happening unreasonable for 1 month. This is clear manipulations.
"Hi from Scotland.I have a spare $1400, is it a waste of time to buy 8 or so shares, if I was planning to hold for >10 years?"
"regardless the critics comment ! fans still going to see it anyway, as my self and wife, and so are my sons and their family. if it turns our good, great, but if not , then oh well. that's ok.. but we're going to see it."
Is Disney park opening next month?
"I'm confused why the stock is continuing to go up with all the news right now. I'm enjoying it, just confused. I've heard 2 different reasons that contradict themselves. Either 1. investors have confidence that Disney will win or 2. investors know Disney doesn't need Fox and would prefer not to add more debt so they hope Comcast will win. Thoughts?"
1 MILLION subscribers per day since launch? Wow! Here comes the next leg up to 160s. Dont worry if you missed 150. It will drop down for consolidation after hitting 160s. This is a steady march to 200s.
Disney stuck under $118 is clear sell signal. $100-$105
$NFLX earnings will no doubt effect this stock hoping to get in then good luck to all longs! Bright future ahead of earnings
When Disney+ launched 15 months ago...their goal was 55 million subscribers by the end of 2024. Sounds comical now.
"NFLX will have to spend much much more to retain customers when Disney starts to pull their contents from their steaming service in preparation for Disney's own. Naturally, NFLX will have to price to either buy or make their own contents which will turn many subscribers off and force them to look for better bargain. Disney already has tons of contents that are just sitting. Their stable of directors and studios can churn out tons more at a steady rate. Hard to argue that Disney will dominate this segment. Who will challenge Disney's dominance? Trend is people are staying at home more and more to watch steaming services at home....I'm in the process of buying a 55"" television for $300 at Sam's!!!"
"Even if Warren Buffett was suffering Dimentia he wouldn’t buy Disney at this price.He’s a value investor,that means not buying at the top of a valuation.Less then .001% he buys this"
"Hello all, I tried to warn you last week may have been the last great opportunity to sell. Hope you listened. Anyways here is my advice if you decide to listen to experience and common sense:Of course you have heard oil prices are at record breaking levels (negative mind you). The ensuing oil company bankruptcies will also add to the already staggering unemployment numbers and further adding to the ruins of this economy. It's not just about coronavirus and social distancing when it comes to Disney, the whole economy is about to tank. Disney will just be hit extra hard, in the nuts. Sell, scrape together some cash, and get ready to buy in 6 months all the amazing deals. Here are some great companies with my personal targets:DIS at $80AMD at $35MSFT at $120GOOG at $950FB at $130RTX at $50INTC at $40Good luck everyone!"
Great investment!! I’m not going to call this price point a gift  but a logical time to participate. It has to many pros than cons!!!! 
This is so undervalued Disney has so much going for them this year
Never buy into the most active stock on the market on an up day.
Under 95 this week guys! Watch your investments!
"if common sense and ""circle of life"" stock market history patterns don't strongly show dis being in a real sling-shot pattern to move higher to folks ....then i say go do your dd on amzn, goog and nflx ...and nflx doesn't release box office hits, have world wide theme parks and merchandise which dates back to 1923"
Once Disney buys out comcast and hulu becomes sole possession then Netflix is in trouble. An offering of hulu/Disney+/ESPN+ for roughly the same price as Netflix will be a force.
"Anyone long DIS here is what I want you to do, sell it all and then short an equal amount, this DIS plus stuff is a 2024 play in the meantime he play is SHORT"
this thing better turn green tomorrow
I think a stock split is likely if this holds above $200 for very long. What do you guys think?
"Let's keep it simple... Dis will be a giant in the entertainment industry for many years to come.That doesn't mean break out today, next week, or even this year.My strategy is simple... Buy shares and hold on to them for a long time. Cheers Dis Fam. "

The beauty of a problem in its effort to resolve such problems depends on us getting to balance not going past balance, My friends we are going well past balance Headed to the other side of the spectrum which will only in grain more hatred division and discrimination"
isnt there anybody who saw stock price was falling down about 30 percent a few minute ago?
210 pps would be here by Wednesday if the MM didn't hold this back from 1230 pm Lmao..They put a bear spread on dis..Not to trap rather hold it down.MM..sVs.The real MM Mackey mouse
Dont get fooled by daily trade. Just check back after 2~4 years and it’ll be new netflix.
The same analyst(Jason Bazinet /Citigroup) that upgraded Netflix with a 580 PT on the 14th said to Disney instead as their subscriber growth is about to explode. He was right on NFLX ...lets GO!
Done deal!!! Disney-Fox Deal Passes in Brazil With Divestment Accord https://s.yimg.com/lo/api/res/1.2/BjsR07FXqeKSrsXTmhLdlg--/YXBwaWQ9eXZpZGVvZmVlZHM7Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQyNi42NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Mzt3PTY0MA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/bloomberg_markets_842/a84f083db21b56e5cf0b057a4f4fc586 https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-fox-deal-passes-brazil-211333161.html
"Disney can use its streaming app to sell Disney cruises and resort vacations . They can cut out the middle man which has a lot to do with the high cost . Not only will it lower the cost to consumers, it will be more profitable for Disney. They can also promote and sell their merchandise to their target audience"
"I thought I'd post a medium length report on our recent trip to Disneyland. Fair warning right up front I own shares in Disney. I bought a pretty good chunk at 112 and have held it since.So - I went with my wife, three kids and their significant others. Also coming were my daughter-in-law's father and my beautiful two-and-a-half year old granddaughter.Perhaps you've seen some recent reports on low attendance at Disneyland. I heard a couple of reports calling it a ""ghost town"". That is total nonsense! We went on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, Naturally Thursday was the least crowded, but even then there were plenty of people in the park. What was true is that the opening of Galaxy's Edge has changed the distribution of people within the park, The lines at Smuggler's Run were substantial and took the pressure off a lot of the other rides. Speaking of Smuggler's Run, this is perhaps the best ride in the park! This is especially true if you can go with a group of six friends or family members. Unlike any other ride I've been on, the small group of six goes into a small vehicle simulating the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon. The group is not just ""along for the ride"" but actually influence the flight and success of the mission. The six of us unanimously agreed that this made it an overwhelming success. My only regret of the trip was we didn't just turn around and jump back into line for a second run.You see a lot of critics of the parks saying they are both ""too expensive"" and ""too crowded"". I don't understand this. If you make it cheaper it will become even more crowded. If you want to make it less crowded, you would think you would have to make it more expensive. (It's like Yogi Berra's quote ""No one goes there anymore, it's too popular""). But I think Disney has actually succeeded at this. By opening up Galaxy's Edge at the north edge of the park, other rides have had their lines reduced. I think the number of people attending has increased, but the new attractions have increased the capability of the park even more.Other observations-The fast pass and max pass features are wonderful. I don't think any other amusement park has anything close. While waiting in line for Smuggler's Run I was able to make fast pass reservations for Toy Story, Soaring and Radiator Springs. We were then able to go on all of those rides within about 90 minutes. The Disney app had many other features too. Pulling up the map would tell you the wait times for all of the rides any time you wanted.From a stockholder's viewpoint, Disney has expanded on their ability to painlessly separate visitors from their money, It certainly worked on me.On our last night we dined as a group at Carthay Circle, This is a wonderful high end restaurant and it fully met all expectations. Total tab for the ten of us with cocktails, wine and dinner was a little over $1K. (which I had planned on). From a stockholder's viewpoint this was the only negative in that the restaurant did not seem to be completely jam packed. I would say it was about 80 percent full.Overall this trip has convinced me to sell some of my other stocks and buy even more Disney. My target is to make it about 15 percent of my portfolio."
When will the dividend be comming back?
Fells like it should be at least $200 right now
Dis had a nice bounce today. I'm surprised people here aren't more excited... It's almost as if they were expecting and hoping Dis would drop more. 
Here comes the higher frequency trading crowd to confuse you before investor day... just look back tomorrow morning.
the factor on the movement of this stock is no longer the Parks and experiences it's Disney+
100 million daily active Hotstar users and 300 million monthly. Disney is already the global streaming leader by a wide margin.
Shorting is best as theme park closures will extend and theatres and movie business won’t b back. DIS+ streaming loses money so they can’t expand rapidly as once believed as no money to borrow for losses as profitable segments like theme parks and marvel movie biz are closed and possibly not reopen for a while. I see 60-70&/ share if things persist for few weeks.
Disney fox is a done deal.
Disney is giving everyone a chance to buy low.. because it'll never be under 150 again after February earnings report
"Admit it everyone wants it to go down, but only so they can buy in/more lower!  So I predict if there is a small decrease it quickly gaps up again... likely, however, since everyone is already expecting it to be bad then any negativity is already priced in and any half decent news on Disney+ doing well sends this higher..."
I'm guessing this rally is partly drive by Berkshire taking a large position ... we shall see
This is not even up 2%. It's going to open red tomorrow
Brazil expected to approve the Fox/Disney merger this month.

"$190 is the ceiling, guess we have to wait till the bell. Not sure if I want to hold into after hours"
"you know what is weird? So many people saying how low DIS is going to go... Do you not think that the big investors who own the majority of this stock right now don't know that the future is baked into the current stock price? I don't think you buy or own stock for what it is worth this second ( unless you are day trading) the investors buy it for what it will be worth down the road. If the big investors thought it was going to be $50.00 per share in a few months, wouldn't they sell it all and buy back in later. That doesn't seem to be happening here does it?"
Comcast will drop its bid for 21st Century Fox if the ATT/Time Warner deal doesn't go through. Deadline for ATT/TimeWarner merger is June 12 at this point. So basically we have another month of uncertainty. There are many flaws with the ATT deal and quite frankly I do not think it will happen. In such case Disney should prevail! Both ceo's of DIS and FOX seem to be in agreement that the deal between them will get done.
Disney +’s announcement video has 6.4m views in 8 hours!! The power of Disney is something else.
wow! It's a miracle!

Netflix just cannot compete with Disney.Disney is going to turn Netflix into a knock-off streaming brand.The mouse is in the house.
Is this the start of the run up before earnings?
"So let me make sure I understand. When Netflix gets cheap subscriptions from international customers through dollar differential or discounts, it’s good but when Disney gets cheaper subs through internationals or Verizon, it’s held against them. OK, someone explain why please."
Back up we go

Look at that gorgeous candlestick. I love this stock long. Mid 90’s tomorrow I guarantee it. Get ready to buy more.
"folks heres is what we know. for whatever reason the money managers want dis at $130ish level before earnings (could be they are trying to edge there option bets). However, I do believe we are in for a huge up day before earnings amd earnings will shoot us up. I see 133-135 before earnings and 141-146 after. glta"

mmmmm look at that chart :) exciting times ahead
This one shoukd be above 160 not here . They own entire market for kids programs. They are streaming king .
"I'm holding a $245 call exp 2/12 that went berserk for a second, then looked and saw the spike. What in tarnation happened?"
Our only hope for the short term is if the RSI dips low enough to be oversold and it causes a rally. That's why Netflix was green yesterday. No one should be worried long term.
Eating a nice steak dinner tonight!
"My advise for disney. Sell ESPN, purchase netflix."
Buy and hold forever
i just bought 13 shares for earningsq. why not! . if earnings are good and stock rises along with good forecast. ill hold onto them. i love disney. been to disney a lot throughout my life time.
Woot! Come on 112! 
I don't sign up for any subscription. I just invest in the companies that people sign up for. I've owned Disney shares since it was trading around 50. I prefer YouTube content cause it's free.

IM NOT TELLING ANYONE BUT NEXT WEEK $110.00.
For all you shorters who continually post that temporary closure of a park or two in China is sinking this stock. Disney has multiple sources of income. This is one. https://markets.businessinsider.com/amp/news/hasbro-earnings-stock-price-disney-toy-sales-fading-tariffs-q4-2020-2-1028894060
Cramer says Disney has more to run
Our hopes will basically revolve on this earnings. Let me explain before the thumbs down.. last earnings dropped the stock.. so right now it’s critical for them to hit the numbers.. but more so the box office hits alone will hit the revenue. Toy story and the upcoming frozen will give this call good numbers. We need to have positive guidance and increased expectations. Also the biggest thing that can push it up is the numbers they will release on the pre-order of the Disney stream. If that is huge this will be easy $150 before the launch in mid November
Shall we see a new 52 week high this week? Sounds like a good plan to me!
"I just finished watching the Mandalorian, it was great. And there are 4 more star wars series in production for next year... wow- The Mandalorian S3- Ahsoka- Star Wars: Rangers of the New Republic- The book on Bobba Fett."
"I am wondering how mamy subscribers disney+ will add with the cv situation. 100 mil subs will be easy in the next 2 year. 6,99 a month means 8.6 billion dollars in revenue from disney+. these numbers are pretty conservative."
Disney joined the hate train.
Place ur guesses here for Thursday’s big announcement:
"You find me a household that doesn't own Disney movie, and I'll be looking at a hermit's cabin in the woods. Do you remember when people gobbled up new blu rays for $30 a movie? It seems ridiculous now, because that could get you half a year subscription to 100's of epic movies. Disney is less than a month away from dropping the atomic bomb on home entertainment. Sorry Netflix, and the dozen companies scrambling to take a sliver of the pie."
So glad May is over. Hopefully the May selling has stopped and buyers will be coming back in over the summer leading up to November DISNEY+ launch. Citi Buy rating and PT of $160 announced today is good news.
I almost sold 10% of my DIS shares at 135 but didn't. Glad I kept all of them. 140 is coming soon.

"I love how bears knock the stock, but it’s only been going up. Lol."
"wow expected loss of .38 , NO actually we made .32 and beat on revenues! DIS is a beast!"
Trend looks to finish above $195 today
"Tomorrow will be your day... im sure.. if the market is up 500, DIS could rally 0,1%!"
Lets make Disney do what Gamestop did. Buy shares of Disney
Looks like FOX is all ours!
It’s going to be a blowout quarter. That is a given what with the movies and Xmas season Park attendance. Streaming Subs is the big number and that should be fantastic if you can read the tea leaves. The only thing giving me pause is their take on the Coronavirus affecting their two China Parks and the impact on their ER’s. That’s the only wildcard. IMHO.
"Luckily It flushed out the profit taking out from May 8, I still don't see DIS is under 140 by Friday, because tomorrow Jay Powell will come out and pop the market up again."
Under 190$ bargainBuying more
Well Done Disney. Just a matter of time for massive breakout. IMHO
Disney ceo sounded pessimistic this morning. Should I hold the stock?
"For what it’s worth, it took Netflix 9 years to get to 95M subs."
200 plus for sure mid feb just buy and shut up thx
$DIS - How about reinstating the dividend?
"When AVENGERS hits the theater weekend, I bet you that the movie will score the new record again, that why I bet that DIS will crush 140 and move to 145 next week."
"I'm wondering if a large number of investors and traders are sitting on the sidelines until the DIS/FOX deal shakes out. Uncertainty is making people unsure, so the price is not acting the way one would expect based on earnings"
JNJ vaccine is effective. Disney is going over $200 today
Crushed it
With earnings AH on Thursday I see this at 195 tomorrow
"It just bugs me how this stock is so undervalued and should be over $200 a share. You have a trifecta of Moderna, Pfizer, and Astranzenica all with 90% effective vaccines. Death rate is below 1% chance for Covvid as the virus weakens over time(yes it does that as it passes from host to host). We have amazing therapeutics as well should you get the virus. Disney has incredible disney plus growth in over 70 million subscribers in a year and over 120 million total streaming subscribers, well on their way in passing netflix in a year or two. How this stock is below $200 right now is mind blowing."
This is the price point where Disney traditionally splits
200$ pre earnings
Now someone explain to me how tariffs impact Disney more than Tech stocks lol.....
"Shorts will make this a roller coaster ride next week. The question is, what will be the new base price?"
Nice run up today. Was hoping it would have dropped tonaround 106 first to add more but still a good safe price at 110
"Stocks go up and they have pull backs. After rising from 102 to 109 after the news, a pull back is normal. Overall trend is up, dis is under valued, is still in the drivers seat until fox says the Comcast offer is better, at which point Disney does not need to beat, only meet since they are the ones with the already agreed upon deal."
The earnings anticipation is growing. 5 days until liftoff.
"Market heading green, too bad DIS can't be up $67 pre-market like AMZN."

Netflix reports tomorrow. Anything positive is good for Disney. Anything negative is good for Disney.
Shorts going to roast going into earnings. They still can't understand the fact that streaming is fundamentally changing the stock valuation. Lot of room for growth. The company reorg to maximize streaming is going to reap huge benefits for longs.
"This could cause the stock to double quickly ... ""Disney Announces Digital Summit Inspired by Minnie Mouse in Celebration of National Polka Dot Day"" ... This is yuge !"
The bounce on DIS tomorrow is gonna be quite the show
Do people really think Disney+ cant succeed in a content driven entertainment market against Netflix? Disney's empire was built on entertainment.
Another quick in and out. Most of the market traded to the bottom bands today. Going to wait until they all peak again and short heavy and buy puts. Make way more money bearish than bullish.
Good conference call. I see testing the 52 week high over the next few days and passing it
Never bet against the mouse
I cannot believe imperial capital downgrade Disney to price target of $147.00.

"With the 2nd fiscal quarter ended, and with the earnings announcement about 1 month away, it's time for my quarterly prediction. I will use last year's 2nd quarter as a starting point - $1.50.First, add about 20 cents for the tax benefits. Now look at the movies – last year we had three good movies carrying over from the past quarter (Dr. Strange, Moana, and SW Rogue One). This year the three “carry overs” did, generally, better – probably about $500 million more, although the carry over amounts are probably better (if SWTLJ did better, I would have added something). Last year, we had Beauty & Beast, a very good movie, but it came out in the middle of March, so all of its $1.25 billion can't be considered. This year, we have BP, most of its $1.275 billion in the second quarter – a huge hit. I would add about 15 cents for this movie – but Wrinkle in Time, which added some revenues, it not so hot. It's domestic is not great, and it is not generating a lot overseas. Take off 5 cents.The other segments are doing well – at least the parks. The parks will add 5 cents, in part because Shanghai is not a drain, but a positive, and the overseas parks (particularly Paris) are doing better. I think that consumer sales benefited by Star Wars and BP (and I saw one article about video games), but I'm going to say even. I think that ESPN and media and cable are about even with last year, but there may be some benefit because the New Year football games were in this quarter this year rather than last year it was in the prior quarter (although revenues might have been offset by expenses). There may also be some expenses for setting up the new ESPN app. I would say up a penny. One other issue, Easter was earlier this year, affecting the 2nd quarter. That may add something to the various segments; further, some stock buybacks are going to add something – I'm going to add 4 cents.There may be some expenses for the Fox merger and other app expenses. I'm going to take off 5 cents.That would give you $1.85. Add that to the the 1.89 for the fits, and you are at $3.74 at the half way mark. Next quarter, with Avengers ($1.5 billion?), Hans Solo ($1 billion??), and The Incredibles ($750 million?) will give the third quarter reason to approach $2.00 a share. That will give Disney a shot at $7.00 a share."

"Disney trades at 'historic discount' while building out OTT, says Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne believes Disney's (DIS) new segment presentation could benefit shares by highlighting Disney's Over-the-top, or OTT, opportunity and providing visibility into the earnings power of its core businesses. If Fox (FOXA) is included and Hulu is consolidated, Swinburne estimates Disney's OTT and Direct-to-consumer businesses grow to roughly $6.5B in gross annual revenues by FY20, while noting that the stock is currently trading at a historical discount to the S&P 500. He maintains an Overweight rating and $130 price target on Disney shares.Read more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2722432"

Blatantly overvalued. 150-160 tops.
my buddy saying Disney+ HDR and 4k is better than Netflix. and he thought netflix was the best streaming picture. yup. this is going to $200 real fast. buying more!
Disney will be worth $500+ a share in 2-3 years after subscription growth keeps growing and growing each quarter. plus parks and merchandising
What’s happening?
"Frozen II is an example of why Disney's business model will help DIS+ and Hulu thrive for the long term. Being able to release movies in the theaters and continue to produce smash hits, it will help keep Disney's free cash flow positive, unlike Netflix. They will be able to fund themselves, rather than have to borrow money to produce new content. Not to mention the revenue generated from parks and merchandise."
Love people complaining about turning profits when these same people probably are all about Netflix... Disney will turn this into a money machine before Netflix even makes profit :)
you all realise that the markets were weak today because Canada was taking a 'me' day.Our lazy day of drinking and feasting slumped this market. but have no fear we shall return tomorrow.
"Bearish Doji star formed today. If validated, we may be in for a short term down trend. But with a beautiful EMA line up like this, it will most likely not be validated or be extremely short term. Just enough to load up more. ;)"
"Its always a little difficult to discern real movement on pre-market activity, but Disney seems to be up a this morning on some activity. As I said earlier a couple of times, it is noteworthy that it is above the price that Fox shareholders took the shares over the money. Maybe it's the upgrades. Maybe it's the upcoming investors day. Maybe its real news on specific shows that have been slated for Disney + and Hulu (as opposed to Apple which gave a lot of fluff). It's certainly not Dumbo."
DIS has a debt problem now...with hi merger costs. Plus the Murdochs as shareholders. Dont like it.
"It’s funny, read the critic reviews of the Lion King and all they can do is complain about how much money Disney is going to make, or roast them for spending money on the cutting edge CGI. I think they’re missing the point: Is it a great remake for the newer generation that expects beautiful CGI? Luckily for my portfolio, the people LOVE the movie."
Does anyone have breakdown of how many of the 10M subscribers are paid vs are getting it free from Verizon as a mobile or internet customer?
"This is getting painful. The market is taking a breather, but I wish this could stay in line with the DOW. It has no reason to underperform the market, yet it is."
I expect a very positive presentation on Disney + on Thursday and the stock will respond accordingly. Why do I say this? Disney is still developing/producing many shows exclusively for its streaming services. IGER has said this is priority #1 for the company....they wouldn’t be giving a preview/overview this Thursday if it wouldn’t “wow” or “impress” the investment community!
"Today's society is so quick to judge based on headlines without reading articles. They read ""Disney threatens to leave Georgia"" and automatically assume they support baby killing. But if they actually read the words that came out of Bob Iger's mouth, they would know it has NOTHING to do with supporting abortion."
DIS is on a mission. cheers to all shareholders!

"I signed up for DIS+ and used it a bit on my phone over lunch by adding shows and movies to my watchlist and boy was there a lot I added! The app on the phone has been easy to use and navigate. No errors like I've been reading so far. Looking forward to experiencing it at home after work on the big screen watching The Mandalorian. I also tried out ESPN+ for the first time over the weekend, and I'm a little bit disappointed. Peyton's Places is what I've been watching so far (which is entertaining) and 30 for 30 is always good. Outside of that I haven't seen much else appealing, but perhaps I just need to dig a little more. I'm hoping ESPN+ continues to grow and attract more live major sports. There is definitely potential there to grow. I think the bundle with DIS+ and Hulu will help with that. I also think there is big opportunity for ESPN to get into sports betting to compete with the likes of FanDuel, DraftKings, MonkeyKnifeFight, etc. They already have a solid customer base with their fantasy football leagues each year. But maybe there are some legal obstacles preventing them from jumping in? Anyone know? Just my 2 cents for the day. Enjoy DIS+ tonight everyone!"
Disney will be able to promote their new up and coming movies on Disney plus and even sell movie tickets and bypass the third party thieves

It is very entertaining to read the frustrated and perplexed posts by the shorts on why Disney hasn't fallen more. Most of them fail 2 recognize 2 big factirs:1. Disney did fall from a 52 week high of 153 to a 52 week low of 79. That's almost 50%. I guess the shorts feel it should have been a 70% decline. Thats just wishful greedy thinking.2. The US Congress and the Fed are now in the picture dumping a limitless supply of fiat funds on corporations and banks. They have an unlimited checkbook. Post 2008 should have taught you something.Now Disney has announced fastastic numbers for its streaming service and plans to build a new theme park. If the Covid19 numbers improve quicker than the gloomy predictions are saying the retail shorts will get crushed. So there is significant risk in shorting this company with little upside potential. JMO
...and we haven't even scratched the surface for people who are going to give a subscription as a Christmas gift.
So does anybody actually think Disney doesn't have insurance to cover loss of revenue from their resorts Nd theme parks due to natural disasters and acts of god?
"Poll/Question for the longs here: from your perspective, how much do these upcoming earnings actually matter? I dont expect Disney to post a ""beat"", they might even report negative p/e End Game numbers wont be included in this report either. with the addition of Disney+, are you expecting more guidance?? really interested to hear your thoughts on this, I'm relatively new on DIS and am curious what your thoughts are here."
"John Kerry a ""climate czar""?

"the ESPN app for S5.99 a month will do little for Disney. DIS has great movie and show content to stream. alot of good Marvel movies coming out for the next 3 years.

It is quite possible that it will do quite well the week after New Years, and ""close the gap"". It also has China coming up, and that has a good chance of surprising.But we shall still see."

"Disney+ downloaded 15.5 million in first two weeks; competitors unaffected to this pointDisney+ has been live for just about two weeks now. The data in this report is through the first 13 days of launch. Thus far, we estimate the mobile app has been downloaded 15.5 million times and has generated $5 million through in-app purchases. Apptopia revenue data is always post app store fees.[Sidebar: Shortly after we announced Disney+ first day download numbers, the company itself announced 10 million subscribers. Some were initially confused on the discrepancy between 3.2 million mobile app downloads and 10 million subscribers. This makes perfect sense though; our numbers say that on day one, 32% of subscribers downloaded the mobile app. For this type of service, mobile downloads come second. Most people install Disney+ on their Roku or Apple TV first. While Disney’s 10 million subscribers are impressive, they were not all signed up within 24 hours. Consumers were able to sign up for the service weeks before launch. And while I do not know this for fact, I assume the 10 million subscribers have not all agreed to pay the company money. A certain percentage definitely have, but many were either on their free trial or receiving the service for free through Verizon.]Disney+ has been ranking #1 overall in the U.S. iOS and Google Play app stores since its launch. It has been #1 in iOS grossing ranks since 11/19 and since 11/20 on Google Play. With regards to revenue, keep in mind that due to the free trial, there was not much money being generated prior to a week after launch. There are also many users receiving the service for free due to Verizon’s deal for its unlimited data customers. Many users may choose to pay outside of the app as well."
"Just got an email from Disney saying that our next dividend will be $0.88 a share, paid on July 27th. Pretty nice. I only have 400 shares, wish I had a lot more. In six months we will get another dividend."
Everything is opening +stimulus check. Here come disneyland!!
If this stock doesn't end in GREEN I'll eat my shoes. The boys are just playing with the lemmings. I said so in the morning too.
D invests based on how people look and speak. great strategy!

Who's this Joe guy?
Dis to 120 very soon.....
How can I calculate if these shares are profitable at the moment? New to this
Looks like we may have a down open related to trade war worries. Hold strong. This will pass and rebound.
I am ready
Your last chance to buy DIS before the rally tomorrow.
Geopolitics nice and positive this morning.Good morning and welcome to a wonderful day of green.
Just broke a new high
Iger sold 84 million in stock from Wednesday-Friday last week and nobody could see the writings on the wall???

"Hi American friends. The rest of the world is not going to die for the stock market.I have been a strong critic the irrational pumping on this stock for a long time. I did however have a 10 day stay booked for September at the Caribbean resort in WDW FL.We are canceling. Ending lockdown early is suicidal.You do what you think is right, but understand that you’re alone on this one, America. Act accordingly."
"A spokesperson for Disney told CNBC the company ""takes the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+"
Just imagine Disney is a pot of water and the heat is gradually warming the pot then the water  until finally its boiling.... don’t think Disney isn’t being accumulated once the float is gone then things get interesting. We saw it about 6 trading days ago and we are setting all time highs so it’s going to keep going higher
BREAKING: Disney and Comcast are holding talks about working out a deal for Comcast's 30% stake in Hulu...' -Tweet From CNBC
"You do realize that 30% of DIS revenue comes from parks, right? Keep that in mind for earnings next month."
Tail winds keep making it harder to hold Disney back let’s review... One month of service 22m app downloadsBob Iger top businessman of YearTop 20 stock picks for 2020Frozen 2 makes 1BDisney breaks 10B in movies this year Apple and Google confirm top app last 30 daysOk guys this is the stock to put your family and friends in and rollout the Disney plus subscription cards for Christmas  See you at $170 on or before earnings 
"Disney is just falling with the stock market overall. It mainly falls with light volume meaning buyers aren't there to pick up the stock as short sellers take it down. Who wants to buy anything in this environment? It's justified! As soon as the market bounces or hits bottom, Disney should be able to recover fairly quickly. Fundamentals are still improving with the FOX deal and Disney remains a long-term SUPER BUY company to own for decades to come. Take advantage of these prices to buy around 100 because this may be the last time we will ever see these prices on Disney again. You'll kick yourself for not buying Disney at 104 when the stock is 200 in a couple years. it's a GREAT opportunity so don't let market fears push you into selling."
"Disney CEO teaches MasterClassIf you happen to be a person trying to increase your knowledge, you should become familiar with the MasterClass web site. The reason I mention it here is that I just went through Disney CEO Bob Iger’s class on strategy and leadership. Most impressive. Here is a leader made of the Right Stuff.I particularly enjoyed his observation that when you are in the business of creativity, everything has risk. His comments on how to live with that can help us all.If you go to the masterclass web page, click on “browse classes” to see a free preview of the Iger class. Of course, if you want see the whole thing, you have to subscribe. IMO a bargain.Note to Bob: Be careful you don’t work so many hours that you burn yourself out. A doctor once said “I’ve never seen someone on their death bed say ‘I wish I spent more time at the office.’”"
"the more it drops, the more i buy. there is no reason for disney to drop. my 4 year old loves Disney+. All of our friends with kids also have Disney+. I can imagine everyone with kids that doesnt have cable has Disney plus. @6.99 is no brainer. 25millioon subscribtions by next quarter. possibly 18-20million paid. the rest on trial or through verizon promotion."
Went to an international Airport today. 1 other car and an ambulance (for some strange reason) besides me. No way this economy going back to the way it use to be....no way.
Do you guys think Disney is fully valued or do you think we’re underestimating the impact that Disney + and Hulu will have?
"DISNEY is about to become NETFLIX on steroids. DISNEY content catalog, plus sports access, plus their latest FOX buy. DIS stock is very cheap looking forward. The margins are gonna explode with being able to distribute direct to consumer."

Why isn't Disney up today after the positive Earnings?
"Theaters closed, DIS parks closed. Price of stock not based on earnings anymore."
"Wait until Disney reports 10-20 mil Disney+ subscribers purchased Raya, box office will mean nothing"
Everyone who knows someone having a baby. Get them Disney plus. It’s the best gift ever!
Obviously DIS will put out great numbers off of all the recent high flying movies but what about next year and the year after that? This is what scares me about DIS. Not buying into 52 week highs.
Does anyone follow the business here or just the daily stock price? Anyone notice the cash flow in 2018 was 14.3 billion and now it is closer to 5.5 billion? Stock is up 80% on the Disney plus storyline.....Fun speculative market enjoyed by Tesla and Disney shareholder alike!
Holding at 130!!!!!
"Why I am bullish on $DIS:Disney will be pulling all levers by this time next year, with some important near-term ones being executed.•ALL parks will be open by April 1. Capacity will keep improving through spring and into summer. Then it gets better as covid cases continue to plummet. May is the new target to get all eligible Americans vaccinated. •Fall will bring another lever. All cruises will start selling even if they aren’t sailing yet. •EOY we’ll see usual EOY entertainment production revenue, as the company will benefited from movie box office.•The streaming lever will be interesting by this time next year. Disney subscriptions will add value to the stock. I guess we will see."
AMC and GME is causing so much to be on sale. These will all POP huge when the GME dust settles
"Friday Numbers released $90 million domestically. on track to hit $600million by Wednesday, after Christmas. Worldwide $700million."
Rough day. We touched green then died due to the market. 120 by next Friday
Let’s go Disney!
What? This is crazy. WHY would it go down after a good report?
The strength of DIS was clearly evident today.
Zootopia-themed expansion announced for Shanghai Disneyland
Go Star Wars! Avatar 2-3-4-5-6! Zootopia 2! The Incredibles 2! Marvel Superheroes! ESPN!!!! Will be an interesting year for NFLX and AMZN ;)
disney has nothing to do with china and yet the stock not performing based on Frozen broken records. i should see this as good buying opportunity because next quarter is approaching. i guarantee disney + will reached 20million. frozen will be close to breaking 1.5 billion. also star wars coming out this month. don't forget the new yodi and frozen merchandise and holiday park ticket sales.
sold my holdings at 126. I think there is no more good news to be priced in after this rally
"all is held up on the FOX deal,,,bet its pinned at 100 a share so it cant move till then,,we should be at 115 already"
It’s Time https://www.techradar.com/news/disney-plus-is-now-available-in-australia-and-new-zealand-heres-how-to-sign-up
"Cancel Disney for canceling Gina Carano! Abhorrent is squashing that rare voice (for Hollywood), who is strong enough and smart enough to draw the apt comparison of how a very uncomfortable-to-talk-about point of history is becoming dangerously close to our current culture of contention, and how a lopsided standard is allowing one side (the left) to get away with persecuting their opponents with labels like racist."
199 coming up boysIf you think it’s expensive at 190.3 the short it !!!LolSee how your life turns out as it rockets to 199
C’mon man!! 
Looks like Disney will correct the next few weeks was a good run in to earnings I I say 140-150 should be good
I dont know why i sold this so early. missed out
"Stock is undervalued. Just think what is going to happen when every kid in America has access to 24/7 on-demand disney content, what do you think they're going to do? ""MOMMY I WANT THE DISNEY TOY!!"" ""MOMMY I WANT TO GO TO DISNEYLAND"" etc.Buy as many shares as you can."
here comes 95
Up over $1.90 after hr last night then closed .24 I think this market is burnt HD earnings better be good cause the Dow has to save Disney today
Disney sold YES network (Yankee Network) for $3B+ that should help earnings 
Time to reload before this takes off!
$250 by end of next summer once the parks and theaters are full tilt again...
Good position to start? 180??
$200 when the $2000 stimulus is signed!
Disney is actually outperforming the market- I can't believe my eyes we shall see how long this lasts
"Like a few people on here, I used to think events like today were already priced-in.But they aren't (from experience) which is strange, but also why it will be over 140 today on the strength of today's launch date."
"It's ridiculous that Disney dropped to the negative this morning before bouncing back. Is the extra 28 cents of earnings the result of the tax bill - maybe, but not all of it. And is ESPN having some problems - well, yes, have you read the newspapers??? - but even with these ""problems"" (which Iger was candid about 2 years ago), it is still pretty level and poised to start showing increases because costs are leveling off, cord cutters are leveling off, and the app is around the corner. Are consumer sales down - yes, but from very high levels, and we may begin to see some increases (Cars wasn't any help, but I bet the Incredibles help nicely). Were the movies off - surprisingly yes, but this was more of an issue of dvd and on demand sales, with Cars again hurting, and last year having some nice movies to help - that will start to look very nicely soon if ""A Wrinkle in Time"" performs well (Black Panther is a given right now). The Parks have demonstrated the strength of Disney's brands, which are only improving because Disney knows that they must keep on investing."
"Disney being scamed by NFL. From CNBC: Disney agreed to pay $1.9 billion annually for Monday Night Football in 2011 — a deal that runs through 2021. That dwarfed the average $1.1 billion annual cost for Fox, $1 billion annual price tag for CBS and $960 million for NBC’s Sunday Night Football."
This dip is because it’s May. A rising tide raises all ships. And a lowering tide... took some profits and positioned for a longer duration. It’s also good with DIS. Feeling blessed!
"DIS is getting absolutely annihilated. My average is around $120 now, I started buying earlier. My plan is to keep adding as it goes down. $60 is very possible in the next few weeks. Expect more bad news due to increased testing, gloom and doom news etc...Given that DIS will 100% exist in the next 10 years, this is all a buying opportunity, if you are a long term investor and don't second guess yourself everyday. It is absolutely impossible for DIS not to bounce back still this year. So, I will keep adding. If you are afraid or need money urgently DON't invest now in DIS."
@IronNippalz what time does it go green and stay green today? Asking for a friend.
I bought 150 Options for $150 Jan 2020. Can't wait to just make easy money
"I just wished they had a marvel show to roll out sooner. Kinda dropped the ball on that one. Other than that, it’s been fun getting a bag of popcorn and watching the classic stuff with the little one. I enjoy the UFC stuff on ESPN+ as well. There’s going to be bugs to work out, and the service can improve over time. I am curious what Netflix numbers will look like in the coming year. Do we see a decrease or not impacted at all? For investing, I think I’m going to wait for a market cool down. Get in at a better position."
The app is crashing and people can't watch.. too many people at launch.
So...mysterious. 75¢ drop after hours yesterday... We new high... But end the day -. 75.Coincidence? Thoughts?
I'll take a 1/2% rise every day rather than a 10% spike the day after earnings. Slow and steady wins the race.
"As a frustrated Disney shareholder for many years, I've never seen s stock that has had so much opportunity yet always stays rangebound for so long."
"Just signed up for the kids and family. Nothing like it for the price. They just hit paydirt, and should have done it awhile ago.The content will bring millions if not a billion subs around the world. Also, killer app."
did you guys receive the voting slips ? The board suggests voting against showing investors disneys lobbying info and other activities... i love the company but I'm def voting yes on this
I feel like a crazy person... keep buying every day it goes down further.. Not worried here :) just have to wait it out. Over double the position I had coming into this year.
Disney or Netflix? I think Disney will need to do well on streaming (future of media) in order for the stock to spike.
"https://www.ibtimes.com/tesla-partners-disney-tomorrowland-ride-will-make-speedway-electric-2806766Ok, this sounds fun!!"
200 soon - Dec.
buy before it heads to $120
BUY BUY BUY. DISNEY WILL PREVAIL
"nice bump. even if parks don't open, DIS+ is still a money maker."
Ouch!
"Let’s see, travel bans, nba cancelled, DIS is involved in both Travel, cruise ships, Parks and they have sports channels, ESPN, this stock could fall to $40-$50 easy, be careful buying to quick."
Half of the AH profit gone. Not sure what the close will bring.
It’s a good thing Disney released the The Rise of Skywalker today on Disney+. The stock would have fallen further had it not imo.
"I scan through the posts on this board. Everyone is trying to find bottom of DIS stock price. The most important question is does DIS have enough liquidity to cover costs/obligations until corona virus disappears. I firmly believe the answer is YES! Moody’s also shares this view. People will flock to the parks/cruises, movie theatres when things return to normal and I believe everyone canceling trips now is immediately rebooking for later this year/next year. The yoy earnings comps are going to be through the roof in 2021. Every dollar Disney is not making now will be realized when things improve. Find a reasonable entry/add price and go for it if you are a long term investor. You won’t regret it!"
No reason to be peaking this high since Disney has been shut down for a year now. Way overhyped and over bought
Does anyone think this stock is worth what it was in early March before they closed everything; because that’s where it is right now.
I honestly thought today we would move between $195-low $200s. This legally have no movement! Any advise before close
Yay its coming back down. Rising too much too fast worries me more than it trading in a tight range. What goes up too fast tends to crash harder too
"I'm definitely enjoying the excitement on this board lately. I must say though, the pumping on here is hilarious though or maybe it's just overly optimistic. Think about it this way, most, in the know people knew Dis + was coming and signed up on the first day (that is the world we live in, everyone wants to be first). The second wave won't be even remotely as big, as it will entail old generations that get talked into it by their kids or grandkids. We are by far the largest population that will get it, so other countries will add to it but in a much smaller capacity. A percentage of the signups were through Verizon, being free to the users for a year. Like XM, some will let it expire after a year. Another percentage of signups were through the trial version which some won't extend it and pay for it. Way too many players in the streaming game to get overly excited about it as it costs money to keep content fresh and new and subs coming in and renewing. I love Dis, but this stock isn't heading to 160 anytime soon, it will likely level off in the mid 140s which is still pretty awesome. I'm sure the optimists will downvote this and leave snide comments, but I expect it, they only want to see the bright shiny light and not the reality."
"Apptopia will release 1 month Disney + download information on December 11th, I would expect a big jump on that day. Get your DIS while it’s cheap"
"Days like this are best time to buy. The stock is down because of people selling whole index funds etc. Not a single piece of bad news for Disney. In fact, Barrons just came out with another positive article today."
CNBC runs segment this afternoon “Disney Dominates”.Where is the beef?
Disney board meeting
This could take off tomorrow after peeps see the great earnings report and realize Disney+ is launching next week
What a cruel joke whole market is up but not this lol can’t beat these hedge funds
"Thank you to everyone that has shown kindness and helped dip my toe in the market this year. It's been amazingly fun. Some lessons were costly... But the more you fight for what you want, the more you appreciate it. Ups, downs, I'm thankful I was introduced to the world of trading and investing.Whatever happens, its been a life changing experience.Good luck everyone in 2019.May your portfolios help you achieve your goals.Much love to all! "
Now the END GAME money starts to flow in. It seems like DIS will be in GREEN today.
"These days, Disney is only playing like Netflix (Disney+, HULU, and ESPN+) with about 80% of their business being shut down. When the parks, cruise ships, movie theaters, retail stores, etc. open, this stock will be over $250 within less than a year .. If the streaming business was not opened in November 2019, on time, Disney stock would have been under $50. All the rest of it to its current price is because of the streaming business (about $130 worth).Who says Amazon, Apple, Microsoft valuation with a not a whole lot tangible assets should have a market cap equal to 6 to 7 times to that of Disney with all that assets, tangible and IP’s that Disney has. .. Buy it and sleep like a baby .."
tariffs are gonna hit markets badly next week. the focus gonna be on uber ipo today lets hope disney could hold up next week
One day this will be a great example of market irrationality along with TSLA. Interesting to see if Robinhood traders can keep it up past earnings.
IMAX CEO must be delusional. People are not screaming to return to theater. They are screaming for streaming and NOT to have to go back to the theaters.
Where's Roland? I need him to make a prediction so DIS can have another great day!
"Netflix is about to get some real competition, and with it the first real test of its steep valuation, Tara Lachapelle writes for Bloomberg Opinion. It has reason to worry as Disney, AT&T and Apple roll out their own Netflix-like products. If anyone will get a new product right, it's Disney. But AT&T may have the best assets, despite its debt burden, reorganization and scandal."
"Boom. Going to be a big jump 5% Premarket across the board. Interest rate cut, tax cut, plus an oversold market! Disney will pump hard in the AM! "
Disneyland Anaheim just implemented a hiring freeze due to soft attendance following the opening of Star Wars land. Can't be a good sign. Entire park has been a ghost town all Summer so far.
"Help! My wife just found TWO stock certificates that she forgot about for 18 shares of Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., from 1994. Now we know that Disney bought out Cap Cities, but my question is are the stock certificates still good? She as never contacted about new Disney stock or anything like that."
"I don't remember what I predicted on revenues, but I predicted $1.61 on earnings."
"Bob Iger is so masterful by timing the launch before Christmas, releasing two blockbuster movies eoy and launching in Australia this week coming. He’s conducting a symphony at the moment and next week is part two  have a great weekend everyone"
i will be starting my slow purchasing orders for the remainder of the year next week. i only have 13 shares but want to hit 30-40 by end of year!
"a billion more in profit will not move this stock,,BUYERS are needed"
"Breaking news: Disney is not a streaming service. And if you think it is at this price, it is not a very good streaming service falling way short of its subscriber goals. But we are in an environment were declining numbers are presented as positive and people are being lied to. Disney is actually a closed studio, cruise ships sitting off the coast of Florida, EMPTY and burning fuel. Disney are parks that are not open and when they do will disappoint the purest and cost new attenders an arm and a leg. It is hotels that are empty and facing increasing costs. Really.....starting at 250 a night for the cheapest room??? But lets run this stock to a ridiculous all time high because it is a streaming service company that has taken forever to hit 100 million after it said 400 million is its goal. Shallow promises, no dividend, losses. ALL TIME HIGH FOR STOCK. This is a sell stock for sure."
"there is no media company on the planet that can even compete with Disney content wise now or over the next 25 years, its a no brainer people, they will be the leader of streaming for many years to come."
Need to add $2.5 billion in their earnings from End game.. Load up.. 150$ I see you.
NFLX has a market cap of $186B. DIS has a market cap of $182B. NFLX membership is only 2 time greater than DIS+ and HULU; and DIS+ is growing much faster. What am I missing?
glad I held through this pullback. was waiting for 118 to add more but that never happen very bullish that gap was never filled. Congrats all longs!
good time to buy disney! its a steal!
Solid company.
On the way to 200
Why would CNBC ever give DIsney good coverage? They are owned by Comcast. No conflict of interest there I am sure.
Got 25 calls for 152.5 to gamble. Lets get rich
"Endgame, Aladdin, Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen, Star Wars. Star Wars :and opening, huge year for Disney"
"I'm thinking DIS will focus more on quality shows/movies than quantity, or at least I hope. It will be interesting to see how competitor's choose to approach spending on content. I for one don't like the shotgun approach Netflix uses. As a consumer I don't subscribe for Netflix because they have 1000s of shows (I don't have time for that). I subscribe because they offer a few shows my wife and I enjoy, and an occasional movie (usually a licensed movie, not original). DIS has shown in years past that they have been responsible with their financials, which is why I think they will continue to spend only on quality shows that will appeal to the masses. Even with the stock down since July, I don't feel worried holding this stock because of it's financial history success."
"agree ....when the market opens, you will see the upgrades and the huge buying volume...disney 140$ Plus yes sir..."
Open under 120? That conference call was not inspiring and I don't think Bob 2.0 really inspires confidence in himself alone either. This stock is going to take a beating for the foreseeable future.
"DISNEY WILL BE ADDING A FEW NEW SHIPS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THOSE SHIPS WILL PROBABLY HAVE A 1000 ROOMS THAT WILL BE AT OR NEAR FULL CAPACITY AT ALL TIMES WITH THE AVERAGE FAMILY SPENDING BETWEEN $4000 TO $5,000.00 ON A 5 DAY CRUISE. BUY DISNEY ON THE DIPS SHOULD BE SAFE TO OWN"
Mickey coming up!
"that price is pretty enticing, November release just in time for all the holidays. People will be gifting this left and right to their relatives that season. Might see a small bump up tomorrow and then a gradual ramp up to November release? Thoughts?"
AVENGERS
"More upgrade is coming soon.Upgrade: Rosenblatt Securities Lifts Walt Disney Price Target to $175 From $170, Maintains Buy Rating"
Well done Disney! The Force is strong in this one. You can’t win Shorts :))
"Can this go back to the $180 level? GOD, this is way undervalued"
"Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu w/ ads bundled for $12.99/mo? Sounds legit to me!"
Why is it going down..?
"Volume very light, we are still a bit over 2 weeks away from earnings . There's a reason why they are releasing Disney+ november 12th (few days after earning). Disney has many catalyst and products in there pipeline. glta"
Come on Mickey you can jump that $200 hurdle
Jumped in at 110 for the long haul.
Dont get the price this is supposed to sky rocket from streaming service
"Disney vs Universal: Comcast today announced a new park will be build. Disney is adding new lands and several rides over next few years. With younger kids/families....Disney is almost a lock. I can’t recall hearing a young family with kids under 13 say we’re going to Universal. By the way, I like Universal and have many great memories spending a day there in the 90’s when our family took a trip to Disney. Universal is fun and probably more appropriate for teenagers or adults. I would like to hear others thoughts on the park wars in Orland between Disney and Universal."
Flat day around here with Monday being up close to 300 points.
"Is it time to buy into this, looking for a support level"
"I dont know who needs to hear this but the lowest Disney is going to hit is around $55. Im 6/6 on “predicting” DIS. I know a lot of you will just ignore this but if you’re smart, you’ll keep that noted. And when stocks start rising again, this is going to hit a clean $200. Higher/stronger than ever. Tried to keep it as straight forward as possible without explaining why those are my predictions but hope it helps. Either way $55 is a great price for DIS. Can triple your money in 1 year."
"EPS isn't a huge deal for this report unless the numbers are awful. Even then, they're not the focal point of this report. The number everyone wants to see is the subscriber count and what their reopening plans are. This might drop initially based off the EPS number, but bounce back *if* the subscriber count increases. Disney has great things ahead and im looking for an entry tomorrow hopefully. - Sincerely, someone who didn't buy Disney at $130 :("
holding till 1000
Those playing the Russian roulette contract wheel....GOOD LUCK. This can easily go either way. Your 50/50 gamble has 50% chance at paying off....lol

Purchased 1 single call option yesterday for $1.34 $118 strike price. Why didn’t I purchase more?!?!?!?
"This is going back over 200 soon, RSI gaining momentum"
"No Disney divvy, however. Dis + needs it to fund original content. Iger wants 100 new shows a year, so it's going to take time, talent, and cash."
big buy orders coming in today somebody must know tomorrows good news. buy buy to $120 we go
Ath on half the earnings
"Hello everyone, i dont currently own shares as i write this however, what the people are saying on this board is correct. a few months back some shmuck at goldman downgraded general mills at the time stock went from 53 to 48ish in less than 2 days , a short time later it jumped between 54-55 its been stable since. This is nothing short of a money grab so they post negative article at will to make stock go down then they buy in. Nothing changed with disney in the last week when it was 139ish this is a good entry point maybe down another day would be a great entry point. Disney will recover this slide within a few days .Rock on !"
watch long term. this stock absolutely go up much higher than now.
"When you think a out it, consolidation and profit taking should have made DIS go in the deep red, but in reality, we got out down only a few cents, tomorrow will be great!"
"DIS earnings reported to be better than expected! Predicted to rise tomorrow, Buy it before stock goes over that 117 mark"
I'm in. All my friends on facebook are blowing my feed up about disney plus.
theme parks will be open in China soon....then U.S.....let's go
"Disney adding first-ever Miami summer cruises, new ports on European trips for 2022! California’s gets first scanning for the people after a year! Huge boost with NFL contract!! What else do we need that this!!"
IMHO buying now at 140 is still cheap. This will be 170’s by next ER.
"Disney really needs to buy a theater chain. A straight to consumer pipeline like that would be insane, they'd make all the money from tickets, concessions, toy sales in the lobby. They could also provide discounts to Disney+ subscribers. Huge potential."
"DIS is not going to be ""your immediate growth "" stock. Slow and consistent evolution. Stay long...winner."
"Here is why this will go higher after earnings. Company revenue was 69.6 billion in 2019, 65.4 in 2020. Profit in 2019 was 11 billion, LOSS of 2.9 billion in 2020. THE STOCK WAS UP OVER 35% IN THE LAST YEAR!!!! WHY? The story has changed to DISNEY +. No worries about cable cutting, loss of revenue, actual loss, or ESPN. Now the only STORY that seems to matter is DISNEY +. Direct to Consumer in 2019 9.4 billion, 2020 17 billion...up 81%. I would expect further growth announce after the bell. Direct to Consumer revenue will likely be over 5 billion. So even though the company as a whole is going to show declines from 2019 in 2021, the DTC division/Disney plus is the whole story. VALUATION BE DAMNED! Nothing matters other than a growth story and a bull market."
I'm expecting a green day Monday. only reason we are not higher is because the market as a whole was a dragging everything down. Be optimistic
Any idea on how “Soul” box office/viewer numbers played this weekend?
Bullish
Thursday before close should run up nice.
"Monday open at 130, close at *it doesn't matter because I'm long DIS and Disney is timeless and one of the safest stocks on the market.* You can quote me on that! "
\Why won't Dementia Joe or HEELS  UP HARRIS take questions from reporter's?Dementia Joe doesn't know what day it is!
"Where are all the shorts saying this stock was going to $50 today? Like I said many times to you shorts, you don't know DIS, you never knew DIS, you are wrong about DIS. $80 was the bottom. I am in at $82. Shorts taking it in the shorts. Love it."
POWER HOUR BEGINS
it was only a slight miss this will be green soon
It’s funny the media chose to focus on a 0.3% slowing construction in the private sector report instead of the incredible 12 billion dollar weekend blowout which is up a roaring 18% over last year !!! US economy is absolutely roaring !!!
Our first Disney buy was in 2000. many buys after that. Never sold. I showed my son what happened yesterday and told him that 500 of my DISNEY shares will be his when he graduates college in 4 years. That right there makes it all worth the investment in time. BTW each of his 2 brothers will also get 500 shares.
Wanda vision was great so far
"I think anyone investing big on NFLX should balance out between NFLX and $DIS. I exit all my short on NFLX last week. Should have waiting until Thursday but I decided to exit completely and didn't stop.I do went long on $DIS on Friday (Also $FB).Here are reason why.1.> Disney Launch of ESPN stream will likely huge success. Lot of people waiting for that. This should known in 6 month.2.> This might help Netflix somewhat (Not whole lot of as most in USA at least already have netflix, With sharing, I think 80-90% penetrated which is incredible but also mean not much left to gain. ) and Most International market specially development country, Cable is still much cheaper than Streaming service.3.> ESPN pricing means Netflix lost pricing power. Now it will compared with ESPN. Also Most of local channel either easily available through Antenna or Free with Advertisement on most of TV Streaming box apps (Like ABC, NBC, FOX....)3.> As Disney launch full streaming service, Their offering will appealing and remove any remaining pricing power Netflix has. It might forced to lower price (Depend on how aggressive Disney is)"
Watch for a gap-up over $145 & run to all time highs on Earnings Report. So many bull catalysts. Bet we hear ab announcement that Disney+ will be released early
"Stock should be around $180 per share, according toBuffy Smithers."
"It is not even the Christmas quarter. This baby is going to rocket after the holidays quarter earnings come out. That Q1 earnings call will include real Disney+ numbers, Star Wars Last Jedi and Frozen 2 etc."
Simple: Thumbs UP if we close green tomorrow. Thumbs DOWN if we close red tomorrow.
"I wrote to Disney Investor relations asking about the dividends and also about any plans to split the stock. I wasn't expecting a reply but they did. They said they have no plans to make any changes at this point. Of course, thay may, and probably will, change soon enough. I am still long in Disney."
"Not a shareholder but just wanted to tip my hat to DIS longs, you guys deserved today (after a long long wait for a big gainer kinda day). Respect to DIS for the power moves they continue to make!"
what would be the best Disney calls to buy right now?
"This Rise of The Resistance ride at Star Wars Galaxy Edge sounds so epic!! There are now new details emerging about Rise of the Resistance. Attractions Magazine reports that guests will load onto a large ship as part of the pre-show, with that ship getting captured by the First Order. Guests will then exit into an area that features animatronic stormtroopers and TIE fighters before being loaded into First Order prison cells that lead to a second pre-show area where they get safety instructions. After that, they are loaded into trackless ride vehicles and enter a room where a Droid is hacking into the First Order's computers, beginning the escape mission.The transports begin moving down hallways and into rooms, with multiple encounters with Kylo Ren. Guests will also see a room full of near full-scale sized AT-AT units, as well as a room where stormtroopers are firing into space at Resistance Fighters. Towards the end of the attraction, rumors suggest that guests will experience a Tower of Terror style drop that will simulate getting shot off into space and back towards Batuu where they will crash land."
"News is pretty mixed right now. Closing the Blue Sky studio was probably smart to keep losses as small as possible. But they're also keeping those employees and finding them positions in other parts of the company. Also, the parks are slowly starting to open at a small capacity. I think they're making some smart plays, and factoring in Disney+, I think DIS will do okay. They're focusing on where they can make money and closing areas that are bleeding them. Besides the cruise lines."
"WOOO GOOD EARNINGS! Watch out all shorts tomorrow!! tomorrow up 5%, hold me to it!"
"If you thought the Shanghai park closure dropped the stock. Imagine the carnage if the US parks have to close, or ticket sales plummet. I'll take my loss now at hundreds, instead of risking losing thousands. I am not shorting, or advising to sell for a long term holder. Just too much downside risk for me. I really like Disney long term, when there is no weight attached to Mickeys tail."
"Disney was not over bought before, it has been in a long consolidation pattern. Do not forget star wars land is opening as well this summer, could easily hit 150"
"When the Market is up 1 percent and this thing cant even move a penny it tells you the whole story.Not even traders are willing to jump on board after last weeks push to 105. No momentum, no big money. Just trading around 100 dollars since 2015."
What are you all expecting for earnings?
What happened to your $200 pumpers?
"$50 before $90, watch out for huge margin calls kicking in this week..."
"We bought Dis before the recent runup and I was talking to someone who had just returned from taking grandchildren to Disney and for the 4 of them, they paid $800 for 4 tickets. Of course they had to buy food there too so the cost of everyone attending is huge. It is the streaming that sent the stock up so much, but the parks have to be making money since tickets are so much."
"As a few others already posted, DIS will be one of the tops stocks in the next 10 years. Adding more and more to my portfolio. Two key plays coming in digital entertainment. On-line esports and entertainment content. DIS will own the content space. They could also expand into esports and set up royalties if third party game content developers apply Marvel characters. Imagine gamers using their avatar in MARVEL theme esports and competing. DIS is not set up for competition and will need a theird party to partner or buy out. Regardless, DIS will continue making great digital entertainment. Theme parks and travel will be another source of revenue. DIS will be over $1T in 1-3 years."
Never touch it on earnings. Guaranteed sell on ER! Will be down the rest of the month. Won’t see a $200.
"It is interesting that Disney said it would take 5-6 years to get to 60 million subscribers, and after just 6 months they are at 54.5 million. That is some serious growth and some serious low ball estimation by Disney. They must be following the Netflix model Perhaps and I suppose they didn't realize how much better their content is than Netflix."
Boycott is picking up steam with the woke censorship of content for the debt ridden name.
"FOX Board to convene on Wed (6/20/18) and will discuss CMCSA proposal. If DIS was smart, they should announce their counter bid at close of markets on Tuesday (6/19/18) leaving little time at all for CMCSA to counter before FOX Board meets. This would render a lengthy discussion about CMCSA proposal during the board meeting!"
140s in site. Will be very soon. Too many good things happening with Disney and folks leaving Netflix to join Disney camp.
"LOL, Netflix is scared and already panicking... Nickelodeon Original Content Is Coming To Netflix"
holding with the price target increase...anyone think this dips into the 160's prior to earnings?
gonna breach 105 prior to close
100 million wow!!
That upgrade by Wells Fargo is the gate way on up over $125.00
https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/frozen-ii-sets-thanksgiving-box-office-record
As far as I understand Comcast has not officially made an offer for anything. It's all speculation at this point.
"Disney currently (2017) had over 150,000,000 guests visit their parks world wide...average guest spend per boat is huge...At $8 or $15...I am guessing hundreds of millions of people will be willing to pay for streaming content..."
Cramer will pump this today as well
All these price target  raises will eventually cause Disney to pop higher the pressure cooker is ready to go higher 
Verizon is the one paying Disney for the recent deal.
Disney now a streaming company and can easily add another 100b to market cap.
Watch dis rally once fox reject their bid.
"Any rational investment decision for long-term success should be based on return capital, return on equity, cash flow, profitability of your target investment.To me, Dis will not escape its fate of falling below $50.00 per share at some point in 2020 because DIS will not have any positive cash flow to speak of for 2Q and 3Q and for the foreseeable future. Before FDA-approved vaccine comes out the market, DIS will not be able to open its Theme park, cruises, hotels or restaurants, or sports events. Its profitability will be a shadow of its former self before coronavirus., perhaps even none."
Outlook is going to be incredible.
"I love this. people with like 5 shares complaining that the divvy is not reason to hold. I have accumulated over many years and I can tell you the divvy is a great reason to hold. On days like today, before earnings, its typical to see the price drop. If you saved for a rainy day then use those funds to accumulate. Chances are many dont save a dime and cannot buy when the opportunity presents itself."
"Disney up all week while the rest of the market crashes. Today, the tech stocks rebound and Disney is down. Go figure. Cheers to the weekend."
"I see a lot of articles saying that Disney is trying to buy back the rights to Star Wars movies from Turner for their streaming service. But why can't Turner AND Disney both have the ability to stream Star Wars? Disney owns LucasFilms so I don't see why they can't stream all the movies. It won't be exclusive, but it'll be there. Anyone know what's going on with this? Articles I see don't really address these questions."
"As much as I am kicking myself for not loading up on some more when it went under 130, this is still a buy. Why you might ask? Because the 10 million subscribers were an overwhelming number. Analysts were pegging it at 4, or 8 million by the end of the year. I really think this means the 20 million will be signed up by the end of the year. This was just the tip of the iceberg. Families will be signing up to keep the kids busy for Thanksgiving and Christmas. The Verizon customers will be signing up over the next few weeks (Do you think they all rushed in on Tuesday - probably a small portion). The new Star Wars show seems to be getting good publicity, and that will put pressure on it.And, while the Verizon is ""free"", Iger has said that Verizon is paying an amount for each, and, after a year expires, I bet a lot stay on."

"This is expected to have negative earnings growth and flat to negative sales growth year over year, for the next several years. It is trading at a PE 20+. I dont doubt its a great company, but it is priced for absolutely flawless execution and as if its streaming \\is already a success. At this price, at best is dead money for a while.""This entertainment company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.6%.Revenues are expected to be $14.64 billion, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter."""
"Part 2 @Scott on my Disney/company, now DIS/stock, sentiments from 2 days ago. To think of DIS in this recent ""7 trading day"" vs ""11 calendar day"" slide from what was appearing to be a solid base in the mid 140's over the last few months (12/3 - 1/22 approx.), and on absolutely no negative news from the company, suggests to those whom which have developed that ""6th sense"" on the stock market over the years that DIS has simply been put behind an essential market wall by those who try and control (yes manipulate) the stock. Think of it like a deep military front + second line of defense from our Civil - WWI/II days, or even a deep NFL defensive front + middle where any type of offensive push simply gets knocked right back by the 1st or 2nd or even 3rd wave of defensive lines = market maker inventory = book depth in the case of the stock market control of some security. The ultimate question but relative simply and point-blank obvious question is why? Answer > Because those who know how much of a market staple The Walt Disney company has been in the country/world, and dating back to its beginning in 1923, and the stock market, dating back 50+ years ago, know that, not A, but with THIS/THE global leader in entertainment that Walt Disney has been is now in a legitimate cross-over or hybrid state into media technology (streaming) or think of it like The Walt Disney company setting it self up and its ultimate shareholders to being able to literally have its cake, the icing and being able to eat it all too given the company's ultimate success history in animation/shows, films, theme parks, merchandise, and now being able to take all of that historic content coupled with its trusted and cult-like followed brand and be able to create and add even more brand new content for the world to be able to continue to enjoy. However, going back to my sentiments on DIS, the stock, and what has been going on with this recent sub 2-week slide, think of the stock price action to that of one big rubber band or sling shot being pulled back, compliments to the pro mm's, as the company heads into a very-much anticipated Feb 4th post-market earnings release; where anticipation meets anxiety for many on the hopeful streaming number release/forecast = the NFLX factor on the future stock price action all in my very honest opinion. The pros/mm's feel it, the institutions and fund managers feel it, the long shareholders feel it ....but I do believe that the company actually KNOWS it! #DIS_LONG ...and I mean LOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
what time are earnings
Would you rather invest in a company like DIS that is making money or ROKU that is losing money. The valuations will come back to what makes sense eventually.
Would anyone like to offer their price predictions for the end of next week’s trading?
Are the numbers good? Hold or sell?
Major correction we should see this settle up at 150
Sold my tiny investment in DIS this morning. Unless they announce buying fox I can’t see anything that will make this go higher. ESPN will probably negate any gains by the studio division. Is anyone paying attention to the nfl this year?
"Just sold all my shares lost 48,000 on this deal. Moving on"
"lots of scare tactics on this board today. That makes me feel like they are nervous, which is good :)"
"im very skeptical about earnings this Q. Not that they'll be bad or anything, but my gut tells me to be cautious optimistic instead of thinking we'll see another blast off like last Q. That is how I am playing this."
Did Warren buffet just put all his money into every stock or something? Everything jumped
be nice to see a $5 pop. but i don’t see anything happening till earnings.
Accumulating in low 130s before earnings pushes up into 140+ territory.
congrats to all the longs. Patience pays
Iger is now in charge of everything and the CEO reports to HIM for the next 2 years ! LOL
Thank you Australia & New Zealand! We see $150+ today?
20 times 9.50 is 190
"Bye bye 130s, and hello 140s!"
"I believe DIS will not drop like the last two days. I can see the support, and I think the sales side is slowing down."
Go Dis.
"After watching Disney let Kathleen Kennedy destroy Lucasfilm, I don't care about any of their IP. Will my opinion make a difference? Doubtful. But its a horrible company in my view. Their stock will do ok, but not with my money or my family's."
"Wanda-Vision is epic. What a show. The introduction of SWORD, Strucker Watch and Monica Rambeau all point to action pack confrontations with Skrulls. Bring it on Marvel."
It has begun. Disney+ working its magic on the stock today. Here comes 200.
Hope all those waiting to buy Dis under a hundred are starting to question their entry goals. 
"Doesn't the Comcast offer mean that Disney will likely benefit from a renegotiation of their deal with Fox, possibly at a better price since Comcast would pay top dollar to take Fox's interest in Sky? Seems like good news, selloff doesn't make sense."
Why short Dis when it holds up so well ? Look at all the red out there making lots more money for shorts. You can throw a dart and hit a better short target.
"Keep adding more on the WBA 55 puts, top band is at 55.60 bottom band...51.31 way more downside potential from these levels than upside risk. DIS is trading in no mans land zone waiting for it to go to top or bottom band before getting back in."
Disney+ is out and I feel pity for Apple and Netflix -
"Options calls & puts are both negative. There is no clear way to navigate this market. Earnings beat, stock down! I am open to any type of guidance?"
I thought we got our dividend payment today? I didn’t get anything did you guys?
Get on board the DIS train now.With PE of under 15 and Netflix PE of 200 what do you think is going to happen when the streaming service is launched? DIS PE should at least double to 30!This is a buying opportunity of a lifetime!
What would be a good entry point?
Trading and D have deleted their terribly inaccurate posts and are now broke & running scared.
So there steam is going to be around $6-7 that is not a bad price. I bought this stock at the dip it recently had for my little one #longtermholder
Looks like MM wants the price of Disney stock to be as close to 148 as possible
Down on Ned Davis Research downgrade from Buy to Neutral.
Green - WOW
Dis can't miss numbers......the projections are 25 to 35 million subs by the end of 2021.....we already have that in the bag. Theme park attendance was through the roof with park closures in mid day. Star Wars missed but it wasn't that bad either. I believe Dis+ will make up for Star Wars. Just concerned about forward looking statements from them
'Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker' outsells 'Avengers: Endgame' in first hour - https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/22/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-outsells-avengers-endgame-in-first-hour.html
This is what happened to Apple right before it rocketed past 300.00 . Buy 2021 calls sit back and relax .. it’s going to the moon .. give it time

"DIS should make a temporary run with Avengers movie coming out, probably there biggest blockbuster of the year, bigger than Black Panther. Stock will close at a high on the close Friday with anticipation of big tix sales over the weekend, and another pop Monday if the #'s R big. Longer term, 30 days later, Star Wars movie comes out, and for dividend players, that comes in June?. U can buy and hold through all these dates, but U take risk of the market, or U can play and sell into the strength on Mondays open if U think sales R going to B BIG. Personally holding until Monday open and reevaluate then, looking for 106."
dead money for now.
I should’ve kept my calls over the weekend
Disney has so much potential yet this thing has remained flat for four years will never see over $115. At least it makes for easy short term trading because it's so predictable. Buy near $110 and sell near $115.
"i knew it...they missed...Movies didn't help! wow. well, just buy back in later at the low!"
Don't listen to the guy on cnbc that said sell at $200.00 .Instead wait until it goes to where you want to sell it at.
"Big disparity in Puts & Calls for May 15th on 100, 95, and 90. May 15 95 puts almost 2 to 1."
"I’m curious, how much would you pay for a book signed by Walt a Disney himself? Authenticated."
"At 140, DIS would reasonably priced relative to the current, fully priced, Market. At 102? Back up the truck. Some films might not hit 2 billion globally like Black Panther? DIS might have to stream its content directly to the consumer hitting a few bumps on the way to exceeding the original dreams of Hollywood entrepreneurs for a direct link to their customers? ESPN will transition to more streaming and less cable? Yes. That's all priced in as fully negative, while in reality it's a substantial growth opportunity."
Overextended stock especially with closed Disney parks. We have 2 quarters of losses . The vaccine pace is slow. At this rate we have 5 years before everybody gets vqccinated
This is a tough stock to watch!
Still pleased that I bought it at $93.
"it looks like there some decent profit taking today given volume, still loads of support to push it right back up. pretty happy I held my July calls."
"To all DIS stockholders: Let's subscribe to Disney+ to increase Subscription number. At least I did. It costs only $6.99 and I like it better than Netflix. If you have children, it's a must ="
"Definitely oversold right now. Anyone wanting to go long this is a really attractive entry point. When November rolls around and the new streaming comes out, this will take off and I am very optimisticOn next quarters earnings seeing as how the deal with 20th centuryFox won’t weigh down the earnings this quarter and of course the new Star Wars addition to the theme park to add extra income."
"For new investors that picked up shares yesterday, congrats! Good entry point, even though today is down. Ignore the bashers. DIS is full steam ahead!"
I had call options for 200 Do you think it’ll touch that today or even get close? Thanks In advance
Don’t think it’s the right move to pull content from Netflix while trying to ramp up Disney plus. They could have just kept Netflix and ramp up at the same time.....why loose that revenue? Because they are trying to stop the growth of Netflix and stop the bleed of subscriber from traditional media to Netflix. They know their traditional platform is being challenge
"these panic sellers or money managers who are selling can't shake me out of my shares. I can endure the pain, done it many times."
today was a good day
This stock has MOMENTUMLong time shorts doing all they can to push down with contrived excuses. Game has changed - get on board.
I told ya this B4 strong support at 182-183 level we going back up PT 225 soon not too late to get in
i’m selling if this doesn’t pass $150 after earnings. ill start buying apple.
Big day fella's.... Disney is the king of billion dollar media franchises so I expect an excellent presentation that will get people excited. If you got in 2 weeks ago like me it's been a great ride so far but this will be why we came today.
"Sorry I have to laugh, go ahead and mute me, however we buy stuff when it goes on sale, we feel good when we get a good deal. Buying a car we try to squeeze the seller or dealer, what ever it takes. But when buying a Company like Disney goes, on sale, we think of everything that for sure will cause this company to close it doors. My advise if you can buy a company cheap, this biological event we are in only comes around a couple of times in a lifetime."
$110 today
Y'all think plus launch will boost stock price tomorrow?
https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2019/07/11/smaller-crowds-shorter-lines-reported-at-disneyland/
Solid. This stock never goes down. Only up even with bad news.
"I perma-hold disney until a reason not too. Been holding for years, buy my kids a couple shares every year for bday/xmas. Go long you can't go wrong"
It's getting tougher and tougher to want to hold on to this stock.
signed up for plus...
200 within 12 months
You couldn’t pay me to go on a cruise ship right now .
"Wishing I could add more, but spent my powder on loading up yesterday"
This stock is headed up
Love this stock!
"Crushed it already this morning 142,141,puts even made a quick in and out at 142 CALL. WBA puts are my focus now!"
Realistically I think D+ added 5-10M subs. Would be amazing if we topped 100M already.
Holding up very well in this volatile market
I have a feeling we are in a pump before an earnings dump..I don't see how this could be at $150 with 100% everything all going great and then only lose $40 and be over $110 pre market right now. This should be low $90's on future value with very little present revenue. 2 $5 billion dollar bonds over the last 5 weeks and zero revenue from anything right now. I've sold calls and bought puts to collar my position pre earnings. I'm shocked to see the stock hit $110...
$200 light sabers.. add $10 to the stock price :)
ahh so much better muting david and optionstrader. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/disney-reiterated-as-outperform-at-imperial-ahead-of-analyst-day-on-new-star-wars-theme-park-2019-05-20?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
I predict a new all time high in DIS stock price of the investor day next Thursday (4/11/19) if all goes well.
Bob Chapek will bring a lot of energy to Disney. looking forward to the new CEO.
I feel like DIS will start going up soon. I imagine the drum solo to Tom Sawyer playing in the background right at the moment we begin a good run up in price.
Every day its the same thing with this. Only moves up pre market. It spends all day chasing the highs but never comes close to it. Should have bought puts
"44% of Disney revenue comes from the parks, which will not recover until COV recovers, who knows when! Meanwhile the streaming business is not making any ground breaking news and will be a while before anything is shown to the bottom line to compensate for the parks and cruise loss of revenue. Thus the lethargic and laggard behavior of the stock! ."
just think of all the people that are waiting to go see Rise of Skywalker like myself. this will be the number one movie for weeks and months to come
Mission Accomplished! New all time high. 
Bloomberg $178 price target!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The lower price is about the Comcast Fox Deal, let see if it lands in our favor"
This needs 155 today !!!
Instead of dividends disney should buy back stock
the short sellers are in trouble today. Thank you Goldman
250 by April
Let’s go to $200 Mickey
"I tell you what folks, I listened to the conference call and we have a mother of a giant on our hands. 3 years out Disney will be trading 3x current PPS.Those who sold today will be short term sales and buying long soon enough. Disney is the greatest American company bar none!"
Heading to 140s and new high-ya gota luv it
“The consumer demand for Disney+ has exceeded our highest expectations” -Disney Spokeswoman
awesome is anything but awesome
i’m not worried nor care if this goes down before Disney+. i don’t think it will. but anything below $130. you better buy it before disney+!!!!
Huge uproar over Gina Carano being fired for her conservative views. Many people threatening to cancel their subscriptions. Does anyone believe this will effect the stock?
Disney joins the 'Progressive' reign of terror; not sure I'd want my money here...
"December 18, 2020, for Avatar 2, Disney now owns Avatar cuz the fox deal"
amazon deal...........hulu deal.....fox ......what else world wants
"Been LONG since 2015. Not the best returns, however I bought more at $80. The long term prospects outweighs this year, and especially the last 5. This is a LONG term investment for me. Plus they paid many workers and continue to during this crisis? A company that takes care of their own is the ONLY way to survive this decade and the centuries to come."
after all episodes of season 1 for Mandalorian is out. i’m gonna watch them all again.
Ford vs Ferrari # 1 this weekend for Fox/Disney
Loaded up at 148.40. Good time to buy
"Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Pixar are unstoppable! Things are looking up! With the Fox deal, expect more elaborate and amazing movies to come especially from Marvel! Welcome back X-Men and F4!"
At Noon today on CNBC they are going to talk about Disney and the upgrade.
I don't watch sports at all.. hopefully a bundle that removes that stuff for me :)
"DIS has been identical to Netflix in terms of earnings, at least temporarily while theme parks and theaters are closed. Analysts could care less about earnings and revenue. It’s all about Disney Plus’ subscriber numbers. I expect them to be above expectations but you never know. Either way if subscriber numbers miss it’s a buying opportunity. The future return of the 80 percent of its business that’s shut down due to COVID combined with Disney Plus’ largely untapped future subscriber base means the stock is at a big discount to where it will eventually trade."
Disney+ will easily get the 130 million subscribers world wide. Within a year or two or maybe even less?. That is a massive amount of money on a subscription model. This climbs to Netflix comparable eventually in my opinion.
DIS will end around 136. Give or take 50 cents.
"In a recent article that appears in the Yahoo Finance page for Disney about Disney's moving up the European release of Disney+, there is the following statement:"" Disney has not revealed how many subscribers have signed up for the service in the U.S. but a report last week from Sensor Tower said Disney+ has more than 41 million subscribers. ""Again, this is probably ""downloads"", not subscribers. But if Disney+ has 41 million subscribers, watch out. Disney will jump 20 points on that announcement by Disney (not some third source).And I remind you that 41 million subscribers could be as high as nearly $300 million a month ($7 x 41 million = $287 million), or nearly $3.5 billion a year. Although Disney isn't getting $7 month for all its subscribers (a variety of deals are out there), That could make Disney+ profitable now, not in 2024 as they've said is their goal."
give me thumbs up if it going tomorrow above $111
I was really hoping to sell to someone over 195. I guess 191 will have to do.
"does everyone see the premiums in the calls and puts that expire tomorrow,, wall street expects volatility tomorrow,, could be a huge sell day or a medium up day"
The record for the most $1 billion plus grossing movies is 3 in one calendar year. Both Disney and Comcast achieved this milestone. Disney is almost guaranteed to have at least 4 billion dollar movies this year. 1) Captain Marvel (maybe this weekend)2) Avengers Endgame—this is a no brained. Likely $2 billion +3) Frozen 24) Star Wars Episode 9Other possible billion dollar movies from Disney this year 1) Lion King (Likely)2) Toy Story 4 (Good Chance)3) Aladdin (Questionable) Curious to hear others thought?
So done with predictions on this board. Nobody knows what the dis price will do in the short term. flip a coin. If you have info of value then post it if not nodody cares.
"Why are most people dissing DIS? I don't get it. The company has 100 years of great content. Reasonable PE. The are in streaming already and the DIS+ looks like a winner and stock pays a dividend. I want to buy more. I like it, but I missed out on NFLX, but I think it is overextended. Any longs there in both?"
This will crash today
"We haven't gone below the 50 day EMA since March, before Disney+ was unveiled! Not that I'm worried, I'm actually enjoying the sale before earnings. I just think it's crazy that we can go that low with such a bright future."
Question for real investors out there. How realistic is it to be able to manipulate a stock's price that trades at such high volume? How would say a large institution go about doing that?
Dis Knee mgmt are Knot Seas!
So when is the stock going to split?
This trading action on a day like today sure looks like a bottom for Disney. No sellers left. Unless we make a complete mess of the ER it’s upwards from here and the stock could fly.
Longs...the key to this is it took NFLX 10 years to become profitable from streaming. Now it looks DIS+ may become PROFITABLE THIS YEAR...2022 THE LATEST!
Watching Avatar the picture is awesome 
INCREDIBLE ER ....I MEAN...WOW!
You'd think after 3 years of consolidating before this breakout that there wouldn't be a WHOLE lot of sellers about right now... I'm thinking $120's soon...
"Give a THUMBS UP if you believe that the World staying home till this thing pans out is GOOD FOR DISNEY STREAMING. It should be a boon for Disney’s bottom like and shore them up through these hard times of reduced theme park revenue, etc."
"Sold my options prior to close and before earnings report. If Disney falls near 137 - i'd say it's a buy again. If you currently own it. I'd hold on. Long term, always a great stock."
There’s only one Disney. The happiest place on earth! Technology will catapult this company into the next trillion $ market cap company
"That pays for my Disney cruise, and for the next ten years of cruises"
"The service is not even profitable yet. The 50 million paid subscribers globally number includes free trials and Verizon customers who got it free. Of the 50M subscribers, 8M came from India. (On March 24, the service became available in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and other European countries. And it launched in India on April 3, last week. These numbers would be higher given stay at home orders. This was just a well timed news release. Parks (36% of revenue) gone to zero/ negative because they are refunding season pass holders. Media networks is 34% of revenue led by the ESPN, which had no sports. And studios are another 15% of revenue, basically ground to a halt. The smallest segment is doing well and the 3 largest segments are getting crushed. ) Predicting they materially cut guidance within the next few weeks."
Annnnd... I bought more. Great sale price before earnings
"Why some people talk negative on DIS+? One day beat in subscription means at the end of year, it's an incredible number. If you sell this stock, you might never get back. It's going to keep on rising."
"The reason I think Disney will dominate streaming in the near future... I watched Birdbox once, it was a good movie. I have seen about 30 of the disney childrens classics at least 3-10 times, both as a child, and again with my own children through the years. I have seen Starwars countless times. I tend to watch watch a good Marvel comic movie multiple times. At the end of the day, I believe Netflix makes some hit movies and shows, but Disney makes classics, and has a full library of them from the jump. Disney will not need to go into massive debt to create content like Netflix. Classics will draw a massive subscription base at half the cost of Netflix.That being said, I believe there is room for both services with the cable cord cutting movement that continues to build steam. I simply believe Netflix will take a backseat, much like Hulu currently.I watched Birdbox once, it was a good movie, but I doubt I will ever watch it again."
"Yes Wrinkle in Time flopped. Let's look a little further:April - Avengers May - Han Solo Star WarsOctober - NutcrackerDecember - Mary Poppins2019 - more Avengers, Aladdin, Frozen, Lion King, Star WarsDIS is going to crush if you are able to see patterns."
When the peps like Trading start spamming... you know you are on a roll :) a month from now.. we will be up even more :)
Hey D/Trader... did you just cover when it was -0.20% ?? that might have been the right time...
"People do not understand how undervalued this stock is. If disney stock traded at Tesla's optimistic stock price it would be over $500/share. By the end of this year Disney will have at least 170 million paying subscribers. At $10 per subscriber, we are talking just over 20 billion in revenue in just Disney plus....by itself. Not including hulu, espn plus, etc. and park revenue, etc. We are going to see gross revenue north of 100 billion in a few years, That's amazon territory boys and girls."
What's a mom gotta do to see $136 today? Let the replies begin.
"so glad I bought Disney last year at 110, about to unload and buy back in the near term. Disney+ is the future of media"
wow 30$ per share in just a few weeks. #blessed by the magic
Looks like Mulan to be released directly to streaming. At $20 it would take 50 million household to achieve $1B. Very achievable. Disney does not need movie theaters anymore in ages of streaming. Don’t listen to naysayers here- Disney has so many tools to make money. The new CEO needs to prove himself right now.
"Plus set to launch in America, Canada, New Zealand, Netherlands and Australia Nov 12 . tricking out to the rest of the world in the early part of 2020 . With 20th Fox acquisition they will have boatloads of contents and will not have to pay a dime in royalties. That’s what’s hurting Netflix.. Disney won’t have that problem"
too expensive
hopefully will be able to close over 111 today!... :) bought some future calls for 114 several weeks out to double down with my shares...
"I think over the next 1-2 months we see more analyst upgrades. When you look at this stock it’s nonsense to look at earnings for 2020 or 2021. Disney needs an open economy that has consumers with deep pockets. Worldwide fiscal stimulus at unprecedented levels has produced a consumer that is richer than ever.Rich consumer + lots of pent up demand + reopening economy = $250-$300 stock price by the end of 2021 or early 2022.The parks will be earning record revenues. My family of five is dying to buy annual passes. People are dying to have experiences right now and I don’t think there is a more perfect company that can capitalize on that than Disney. Throw in a streaming business that is due to have several blockbusters come out in late spring/early summer.There is nothing but catalysts on the horizon for this company! The only thing that could derail the bull thesis is poor execution by the government on vaccine rollout or by the South African variant taking over. Novavax’s vaccine has great data, even on the variants. I think there’s a good chance the others will be effective too.A handful of positives vs 1 big negative? I’ll take that risk all day everyday."
Fantastic numbers -- great news -- How soon do you think we see $200?
"The more brick and mortar stores they close, the more cash they will save. Great move."
Earnings report will either show how slow and out dated DIS leadership is or a change in the old way of doing business and a digital entertainment mega company finally embracing all that technology offers.
Trading like its going out of business 2 weeks before they report RECORD SUBSCRIBERS for DIS+
"Firstly, I'm just an average Joe with no professional training. I'm self taught and a novice at best. The following is just my thoughts, observations and opinion. Been following Dis for the past 3 years and it's current range reminds me of its trade pattern prior to its breakout of the 120 range last year.It happened time and time again... Hit 120 area then down. (way before covid and lock downs)My logic, Dis was hovering around 120 with parks at capacity and billion dollar blockbuster every other movie and the excitement of a new streaming platform. I have a hard time rationalizing Dis over 120 with no revenue from cruises, parks, theater releases, sporting events revenue via ESPN etc. I still see Dis as a great long term investment, but I have to be realistic and consider the lack of revenue brought on by the global pandemic.I have faith that Dis will hit the 150 mark SOMEDAY, but it might be a while... If you aren't willing to leave your investment for long term or your trying to play the short game, know your risk tolerance and plan accordingly. Best of luck Dis Fam. I've learned to ignore the Trolls preaching the end of the world, but I've also learned to be patient and pick better entry and exit points. (avoid panic buying and selling)Best of luck, hope this is able to help some of my fellow investors. Respect. "
Disney will have over 200 million subs by the end of 2020! Disney is the next Trillion dollar company!
"""The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 2 days time. Investors can purchase shares before the 13th of December in order to be eligible for this dividend, which will be paid on the 16th of January."""
"By the way for the DIS longs, I also suggest looking at BAC if you have spare cash. Currently Buffet’s #2 holding and very cheaply undervalued in terms of PE historically and forward, as well as their continual growth in earnings. The CEO is turning things around and like DIS it has been relatively flat but posed for a breakout."
When you spend Billions of dollars on buying movies and content you can sway the opinions of critics but appearantly it’s FAKE NEWS everyone loves latest Star Wars 
"no parks, no sports on espn, no movies in theaters, no movies being made, no content being made for disney plus, no cruise lines. I probably missed something.dont get me wrong. I love disney but no operations means no money. disney plus is a plus but not gonna cover it"
"just came back from Disneyland and it was packed, longest lines I've seen in a while, no one seems to care about the coronavirus on the west coast. has anyone been to Disney world recently?"
"Disney is due for a big breakout, 145 to 151 in horizon very soon"
Earnings leak?
"Just rode the Rise of the Resistance, the ride that opened today. And not a single person getting off didn't say it was the greatest thing they had ever seen. They have another big win"
Disney annual shareholder meeting is next Thursday (3/7/19). I expect Iger and team will announce a closing date for FOX deal!
"Someone please explain to me, Avengers, Lion King, amusement park, Disney+, positive discourse and a common belief that Disney are going to be a very serious player in the market in the coming years. How on earth does the stock fall?Do not get it wrong I plan to stay here and not long ago I also increased my investment but when will we see a sequence of green?"
Soon...tonight ;)
I think Ds position expires tomorrow... Hopefully he will leave us be now :) if 0.10% down was crashing ... 2% up must have knocked him out of his chair.
"Is anyone raving about their great trip to the Disney parks? NO. Are they anywhere near their promise of 400 million subscribers to their rerun access. NO They are not even at 100 million after promising 400 million. Are people really looking to spend their rent money on an expensive trip to Disney. NO, The studios are still closed the ships will not see paying families for another year, the stores are closing. This is not an opening stock, it is a stock that is 100% overpriced based on hype, misleading guidance, lowered numbers, hidden losses and crooked wall street pumping a cash short company saying they are worth the same outrageous valuation of netflix."
Told ya....you bag holders with those $200 Calls LOLOL
remember when this was sitting at $125-$130 for 2 months. now it’s sitting between 145-150. we can only assume it’s going higher with what’s in stake. $165-$170 will be the new average after earnings.
This is a stock I'll hold forever. It is the definition of a stock with a wide moat. Netflix is a one shot wonder.
UBS upgrade from neutral to buy with price target of $200 from $155
Disappointed I didn’t get my quick little buzz from the price jumping on earnings like everyone expected. Happy for the opportunities to buy more.When 2023 comes around I’ll look at where I’m at.
I'm considering buying. Is $147 a good entry point?
$65 tomorrow
"Fellow Mouseketeers. We are entering a slow and steady continuous rise up for the next several years. Content is king and the king of content is the Mouse. We don’t have to spend ungodly amounts on content that Netflix does. It all sitting there in our vault. So grab some popcorn, relax on your sofa and enjoy the ride up. And of course....... May The Force Be With You. :))"
"dont believe the bad star wars episode 9 reviews. the movie is worth watching. once the final tally is out, it will be a blockbuster. Buy now, stock will be 150s before the year end."
"see how red can make u HAPPY!pass it on, we're here to help one another, and teach when we can, we are not alone"
THE MOST WALLSTREET PUMPED STOCK PRICE EVER. THIS IS HEADED DOWN HUGE.
When does D23 Expo and announcements start officially? IT says 23rd here - https://d23.com/d23-expo-2019/ but some folks in this thread were saying some announcements are coming early?
"A former Walt Disney Co. accountant says she has filed a series of whistleblower tips with the Securities and Exchange Commission alleging the company has materially overstated revenue for years.Sandra Kuba, formerly a senior financial analyst in Disney’s DIS, -0.15% revenue-operations department who worked for the company for 18 years, alleges that employees working in the parks-and-resorts business segment systematically overstated revenue by billions of dollars by exploiting weaknesses in the company’s accounting software.Kuba said she has met with officials from the SEC on several occasions to discuss the allegations.A spokeswoman for the SEC declined to comment.A Disney spokesperson said the company had reviewed the whistleblower’s claims and found that they were “utterly without merit.”"
"So I've heard on the news (which could very well be false) that if Comcast can partner with someone, they could offer as much as $90 Billion for Fox. If I've done the math right (which could also be false) that's just under $48 per share. I'm sure all Disney has to do to win the hearts of Fox shareholders is match the deal. Does anyone think it will get to this point? And if it does, will Disney shareholders go for that high of a bid? Aaaaannnnddd discuss..."
"just so you know guys.. D is here to help you make money. He has been wrong most of the time in the past... but he thinks he is right now... so listen this time because ""it is different"" :P"
Moving towards $145.00 .Then with a boost of great news will move up to $152.00 !!!!
"Did anyone else find it interesting yesterday that park attendance was up 1% but food was up 4%? The parks are overcrowded, so they are obviously working on getting the people who are there to spend more money. If you look at the food options at the parks, they have really shifted to catering to foodies. On YouTube there are vloggers that vlog exclusively on Disney food. Great strategy Disney!"
watching a live stream. ResortTV1 of Galaxys Edge. they open the section for everyone and it is packed!!! $150 next week!!
"So far, Disneyworld is operating normally. The storm has shifted. But some people may have already cancelled plans for the weekend; I would probably do the same."
A great day for Disney. Looking rock solid today in an unstable market.
It is my opinion that there will be the opportunity to buy more shares under 96 dollars.
Seems like every time it goes up around .50 pre market it tanks when it opens
"buying opportunities with recovery of theme park, cruise and hotel. DIS will double."
I would rather be in DIS than any other stock. Holding up well in comparison to most other stocks.
"... and I’m out, only made $250 on 20 calls. I was planning on making $10k - still not a long term holder here yet."
"Disney stock price essentially is all about Disney+. We all know its amusement parks are closed, Movies for theater is shelved and cruise ships are docked. Once the pandemic is over you are getting the parks, movies and travel for free. Stock will be $300 by then."
former ceo bob iger just sold 87 million worth of shares 
I bought Disney about 20 years ago for $40. I keep thinking of selling it because their dividend is so low compared to my other investments. But darn - it keeps going up in price. So I guess this one will have to go in the capital gains column.
we have over five million shares trading after hours. This does include the 1 million block trade at 132 which I am beginning to believe is Insider stock award. I am amazed at how high this is going after hours and this is all without any Disney plus subscriber information. I think the deal with Amazon is fantastic and is probably what is helping this stock so much
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/12/disneyland-scores-permits-to-build-marvel-inspired-theme-park-land.html
200 today!
Is anyone else apprehensive about the CEO in waiting?
this is a 400 per share stock and then the split
How about DIS offer to buy NFLX. What would the market say? Maybe congress would block.
DIS should report good earnings after hours today.
"This why you buy the stock outright or options that have an expiration date far into the future. But make no mistake, the powder keg is only getting more primed for the moment Disney+ is released. Thanksgiving tables this year will include chatter from early adopters of their new Disney+ account. Then, 2019 will be remembered as the ‘Disney Christmas’ with everyone huddled around the Christmas tree watching their favorite content- from the best entertainment company to have ever existed."
Gild news that it kind of work on 100 people was enough to shoot the market higher 700 points. News that it doesn't work at all didn't even cut any market gains. This bubble market wants to go higher.
"I bought at 144, I will buy at 137 as well. Good time to build position for the next 10 years."
This is one of the most obvious buys in the market right now. Added to my position today.
Analysts and traders will figure out the Accounting maneuvers from Disney by tomorrow. Will be a steady sell off to $ 100 before things improve
i’m buying more monday morning at the opening bell!! Galaxy Edge exceeding expectations!!!
"Ever since we broke out of the triangle formation, I've been trying to figure out the new formation. I'm calling this the stairway to heaven. We skyrocket for a while, and then are flat or a little red for a few days. Then we skyrocket again! Thus creating a stairway to heaven!"
D - i ran some new models today. made some moves. Hows your day going? Did you update your models?
"I find it interesting that Disney is being punished for growth, when 99% of companies would be rewarded for this move to acquire. I guess sellers at these prices have no future vision."
"Have Verizon went on the Disney plus platform, wow the way it’s set up very easy to use everything is categorized from movies to shows a clean sleek look with lots of potential."
Why are they spending so much money on advertising Star Wars? It's everywhere.You'd have to be living under a rock to not know about it. Spend it elsewhere...
peaked
Disney has no limit !!!!!!!!!!
I bought dis at $82 and change....If it goes over $225 I may have to sell half....then see if it hits 300!
Watching steamboat willie .. too cool too cool ..
disney we belive in you supporter
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2019/11/28/disneys-revised-subscriber-numbers-reveal-soaring.aspxLet’s see what happens next week my money is on Disney 
"Their balance sheet will look terrific within a year if they can reclaim ~$20 billion for the RSN's, ~$16 billion selling their stake in Sky, and several billion from Comcast's stake in Hulu. Reinstating their stock buyback wold be nice too.One positive I see is the cost cutting measures from synergy with Fox, that includes up to 5,000 employees getting the ax. Unfortunate for them, but good for us investors."
Someone is buying a lot of Disney something or someone knows something is coming
2500 shares of DIS. Do the math. I am happy.
"So, DIS will eventually double, right?"
Smiley face on the stock today as a sign for the whole year.
this is not a pop up. it is a new base.
The puts got a lot cheaper today. Nice!
Short
My conservative approach to buying DIS backfired. Bought half a position at 130ish (late Sept) with support at the time of in the low 120s. I didn't think there would be such a big push past all resistance levels here in the mid to upper 140s. Time to go back and study the charts to find another entry point to add to my position!! I'm thinking a lot of Johnny come lately retail buying is pushing the price but it's okay ... !!!
Now it is time to buy value stock and DIS is a value stock.Imagine DIS is valued over AAPL.
Correct me if I’m wrong but Dis dividends are being paid out if you are reinvesting it back into the stock isn’t it a good thing it’s going down for a few more days atleast so you get more in return?
All time high today with an increase to the dividend around the corner as well!!
Nothing but down since the latest 'Star Wars' installment

"If they can do so well with one hand, it will definitely do even better with both hands when their parks and cruises will be open"
Disney shareholder meeting.
Jim cramer say ...
"Verizon offering free Disney + is indicative of how valuable Disney + is seen, DIS is taking off, 150 bey year end"
I own 300 shares and wait calmly for 10 years. let's see where disney stands
Baby Yoda about to cause riots in stores. Be careful out there fam!
Money tomorrow
"I believe disney will double their gross revenue easily and the math is simple. Disney plus will have 500 million subscribers paying monthly. At a $10 per subscriber that is 5 billion a month, and annually that is 60 billion.a year which is what disney makes now. I think max disney plus can charge is about $15. So if you think that is about 7.5 billion a month, or 90 billion. Their streaming revenue will surpass revenue from parks/cruises combined. Would not be surprised if disney stock starts trending on reddit before earnings."
this will recover because it is Disney but its gunna go back to the low 90s maybe high 80s territory and that's when I'm buying
1T this decade
"While US is classifying coronavirus meetings, German chancellor Merkel saying 3/4 (58 million) Germans to catch virus. Trying to slow that process down will help hospitals from being overrun."
What Happened?OMG someone sold a lot at once.
gonna pullback for the next couple days but this for sure goes to huge numbers in the next year
No reason to sell for a while people. Avengers pop still to come. Earnings pop still to come. Believe me people. This is a nice run up to come after years of sideways trading. ENJOY
The Rise of Skywalker is at $724 million world wide gross in 10 days. Not bad considering the negative critic reaction. It will probably cross $1B by end of the week.
Avengers Endgame Most money making movie!!!!
Welcome aboard former Netflix investors! Disney is scheduled for a nice cruise. Give a thumbs up if you sold Netflix recently!
JUST BUY DIS WHENEVER IT IS IN RED. IT IS NO BRAINER STOCK FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS.
"I’m afraid Thursday is going to be judgement day. Goldman Sachs is expecting 2,000,000+ for the new jobless claims. That’s going to cause a lot of panic."
If the market wants to give me cheap calls today I just took some!
"DIS is up .55 in the premarket hours, and was only down .54 yesterday. Since D said it ""plummeted"" yesterday, can I say DIS is skyrocketing? Since we are making such radical predictions, I'm going to predict DIS will be at 130 by EOD just because of a 55 cebt premarket jump. "
"Disney was trading at 120 a share in july 2015!! Who would stay with this dog so long.Full disclosure, I owned disney at around this level and after 6 months of going sideways, i sold it."
$200 here we go
bought some delicious LEAP calls today at a juicy discount. See you in summer-autumn once their parks reopen and Disney+continues to grow. cheers and GLTA 
"DIS, AMC, TLRY, SNDL looks like bullish rebound!"
Trading doesn’t have to be about losing all the time. It doesn’t have to be about letting the markets pummel you day in day out. Fight back with (http://Rightpicker.com). Beef up your defenses and join them.
"Disney back over 200 again soon, Cali reopening the parks 4/1 was the catalyst it needs"
"Short term Breakout tradeWATCH for possible breakout above 150.07Target: 157.74, 7.2% P/L ratio: Excellent"
New 52 week high today! Are we ready?!
CNBC news on Disney
"What happened to the posters calling for 100? Like I said, same signal three days before the run started last time. Dis hasn’t signaled a pull back yet as the shaft keeps opening up. However I think it’s getting close to a point where it needs to pull back soon. Last time it was 11 days before a slight pull back, we are on day 10- day 11 last time was a large gap up followed by a run the to close towards its opening price. Then it was a couple of down flat days as it closed it’s gap up but didn’t really pull back much, then followed by flat for a week. Then a few strong up days, and then we started the pull back that retraced roughly 70% of the run up."
4 days left for frozen 2 tickets are all sold out already
Disney is a $300 stock NOW. Buy it whiter you regret it!
Damm dis little sneaky mouse..Every time I think to buy Little guy.. Moves over 190 lmao186 was a good number yesterday. Do I pull trigger  Before earnings.They seem to go up 8percent after last.2.earnings..
"A few people have posted some really stupid stuff about Disney valuation and earnings...First you have to understand that cord cutting is growing and that alone creates streaming service demand, second Disney has acquired the assets to provide that service through Fox, Hulu, ESPN and Disney plus. More importantly and notable they used operating capital to launch these business hence earnings haven’t grown in 8 years but assets have increased by $140b. Stock multiples are based on growth Disney typically grew at 8-10% annually but over the past 12 months and with launch of Disney plus they are growing in the 20-30 range causing the multiple to expand and be rewarded. Today we are at 22X by the end of quarter they multiple should increase to 28/35X based on revenue and Disney plus growth imo"
Not sure why Iger is considered a great manager. DIS is up only 20% over the past 5 years and trails the market averages by a wide margin.
Market wants to go downBuy more and hold
"The people saying this is going red tomorrow are the same ones who bought gme at $150. Stop creating your bogus theories and irrelevant points to justify the stock ""finishing 160 tomorrow."" Anyone with at least 5 hours of trading experience know what to do with this stock after the ER. Crazy how people let random guys named Jeff on the Yahoo Finance conversation tab with 7 likes control their portfolio. Hope you enjoyed by Ted Talk, RIP shorts."
"These dips are just another opportunity to buy more before earnings call next month, dividends, Star Wars Florida, and Disney+."
"Huge news with Verizon and DIS+ deal! Verizon has 140M+ customers in the U.S. That's a lot of exposure to the service. Now we just need the content to hook them in and become paying subscribers after the deal is over. Disney is king of content, so that shouldn't be an issue."
@Thanos over here excited about the 5 buck drop after a run up of double that! by my calculation you are still down on the week and on the year. nice calls (NOT)
Guys Guys... don't buy Disney... because GE went down in the past...
I got in at 139 think there is still more gains in for me?
"With my earnings from Sprint I’m buying Disney, Xom, and Sbux."
Did yesterday not happen? Was Verizon news just a dream?
"Oversold, sell your winners to offset your losses. Where and what do the short hedge funds sell to meet margin call. When will it end. Throwing good money after bad. No doubt GME will correct big time....but when?"
let's hope big guys don't start selling once we reach 132/133 again...
So guess who won the box office yesterday? Spoiler alert. It was Solo again.
Wow came in from plowing I thought 174-75 today this is great looking at 180 by Friday 200 earnings
alright guys Tommys new nick name is Desporado. so everytime he makes a new post call him Mr.Desporado. You netter not hold your short over the weekend cause you will regret it.
Walt Disney is up 5.86% to 201.12
"Hey! If you love Disney, here is a fun poll featuring $DIS! https://twitter.com/thestockpoll/status/1358670505918623749?s=21Enjoy!"
"Dear Mr. Iger (part II)• I’ve cancelled my Netflix and HBO account • Instead of adding mom to my Disney+ account, I’m making her pay for new her own Disney+ account• I’ve painfully watched now 2/3 of live action AladdinI’ve checked all the boxes to help Disney earnings......hoping to get a 11% pop in after hours then. This stock has been hard to watch over the last 8 weeks :-/"
"Since the time I had purchased DIS around $120 in Nov 2015, it has not gone up to even that number since then. Sitting on a lot of stock."
Hope you enjoyed that shorts. That’s all you get. Now it’s our turn again.
HAHAHA Where is D ?
Disney To Skip Dividend Payment After Earnings Miss Badly; Stock Falls
"Unless we close above 144.75, then the downward trend will be validated. Fingers crossed that it's a short term trend and some of us get to add more! I think it will be. :) GLTA!"
The fact that this is holding the line in the face of massive volume is a very good sign to me. Tons of profit taking but only down 1%.
I just bought disney! Let's hope it will close $200 eod
Just picked up 250 shares at $99.70. Thank you sellers!
"Too many catalysts lined up, Endgame obvious profits, then ACTUAL ER report, then a few more positive earning ER's due to marvel franchise, theme park (starwars), then the massive juggernaut= Disney + in November. This puppy according to analysts is pointing up."
If this retracts to $115 today I will be buying calls. Just the excitement for Investor day could run this to $117 or higher.
"while this is mostly mostly not talked about, Disney's India portfolio include the streaming service Hotstar with 400 Million users with a record of 25 Million concurrent sports live viewership. Imagine the all Disney+/Hullu/ESPN/NatGeo content being released on this platform. I would say Disney has built-up an ecosystem to be the leader in this space."
woah... I sold my shares 2 weeks ago but now I'm thinking of rebuying...
I added 4 times since earnings. Now I sit and wait.
"Disney familyNo words to define the price action. Thought 150 plus last night and today. Outstanding company, but to see every other stock rally to new highs daily. To see subs break estimates, all indexes (again) gapping green,,,,Disney is 142 now What did we do wrong"
"Everyday can’t be green. Volume is really light, which means you can’t worry about the drop while the stock consolidated before earnings. Do you have any doubt in DIS ability to crush earnings at the end of the month? Dis+, movie season, parks, and toys during Christmas will bode well for all longs. Just hold or buy more on the dip."
Over 1 million US subscribers for Disney+ and it hasn't even launched yet. Let's go!https://techcrunch.com/2019/10/31/study-claims-disney-already-has-over-a-million-u-s-subscribers-pre-launch/
"I just wrote Disney a letter and I complained that they didn't ban ALL strollers and kids. I told them to make Disney adult only! YES! nudey bars and all that old stuff! D, what do you think about my idea? Will send it to $250!"
"I was off. I said 1.90 per share - it was 1.84. I'll take it.With hindsight, what hurt Disney this quarter was A Wrinkle in Time. It should have done about $200 million more. That would have put it at about 1.90 a share.This coming quarter is going to be very very good. Last year, this quarter, Disney opened Guardians, about $855 m (for which Disney was very satisfied with), Pirates, about $800 million (which Disney was ok with given its overseas haul which is why it did it), and Cars, about $350 m (which Disney was not very pleased with) - these total about $2 billion, or a shade less.This year they have opened with Avengers, which could do $2 billion alone!! (I saw one online site that said it was between $1.75 - $2 billion, which I think is a fair estimate - we will know more by the end of this coming weekend). Then we have Solo and Incredibles - both could do $1 billion each. This would translate into 40 cents more than last year's 1.58 per share. We have estimates of $1.96 so far, so that seems about right - but I don't think the tax savings are factor in (about 20 cents) - this could push it nicely over $2.00. But the earnings call mentioned a few pending losses - putting that into context, we might just be a few pennies over $2.00. An early estimate might put this $2.05..The reason this is important is because this could push Disney to have results of over $7.00 a share for the fiscal year."
"Just curious, I’ve seen a few comments that Disney+ won’t be profitable until 2024.... how is that possible ? 50+ Mill subscribers doesn’t make that streaming service profitable ??How much can it cost to run ?? Honest question."
"I buy DIS for the bright future platform. I guess the streaming platform for the fist 2 quarter will hit over 60 million subscribers in a rushing manner. I have no doubt that DIS will transform from entertainment sector into the service sector pretty soon. Watch out when the streaming business starts, we will see DIS starts to get monthly revenue in a big way,and don't forget DIS can add on the ads with the platform. I see DIS will hit 200 by next year."
NFLX share price goes from $90 to $327.DIS share price stuck @ 100.
"back to 150 in no time with zero revenue. Wow, just wow!"
Wow! What a month so far!
Parks will be closed till end of April...they have to be and even when they open it will be slow for awile.
"Panther, Avengers - Infinity war, Solo and The Incredibles 2 ... these are list of Disney movies that will top $1-2 billion box office worldwide in Q2. 2Q Earning will be great!!"
Thanos won this day
"Mark this prediction. Disney will have a very nice investor's day. It will be a lot of fluff. But it will still be good, and leave those paying attention that they have a good series of streaming products that will compete with Netflix and be above the rest. There will be some announcements on the sales of the Fox sport television networks. They will average around $1 billion (without the YES net work which will be about $3.5 billion for Fox's 80% interest). These announcements will start in about 4 weeks. Captain Marvel will have about $425 million in domestic box office by April 25th, and about $700 million international.Dumbo will garner about $225 million domestic, and about $300 international.Avengers will open to $290 million domestic. I will wind up with about $2.2 billion worldwide.Disney will announce second fiscal quarter results in early May. Earnings will be about $1.65 - less than last year, but beating projections. They will also announce that ESPN+ is over 3 million subscribers. By the end of May, Disney will announce that the Fox transaction is taking place, or will take place.Aladin opens on Memorial Day Weekend. It does $95 Million for the first four day weekend - not great, but a good start for a weekend that has been driving Disney crazy for the past few years. It will wind up a $250 million domestic, and $650 worldwide.Toy Story opens to $150 Million. It winds up with $400 million domestic, and $1,05 billion worldwide. July 15th - the Fox merger is completed. Sales of the local sports cable networks are proceeding on the basis discussed.Lion King opens. $200 domestic. Winds up with $500 domestic, $1.25 billion worldwide.Third quarter earnings announced in August - $2.50 earnings - a record. Espn+ up to 3.5 million. Disney + announced opening shortly at a price of $4.99. Disney announces that it bought AT&T 10% interest for $1 billion. September - Disney announces that the Disney+ signups exceeding expectations. October - Disney announces that its sold its interests in Fox Brazil and Mexico for $5 billion. It announces a few other sales required by Europe for $2 billion.November year end earnings announcement - $8 a share. Disney Plus has 4 million subscribers. February, 2020 - Disney announces that it has an agreement to buy Comcast's 30% interest in Hulu for $3 billion.May, with the earnings announcement, Disney announces stock buybacks of $5 billion. Announces 7 million subscribers for Disney Plus. By June, 2020, stock price at least 150Mark these and tell me if I'm wrong or right."
"CNBC trashing DIS because of increased oil/gas prices. Claiming that increased oil prices will hurt theme park attendance. I call BS. I don't think anything short of a nuclear war will stop people from going to Disney theme parks. These parks have operated at maximum capacity for decades through high and low gas prices, recessions, and world turmoil."
Wow! DIS hasn't been at these numbers since before the earrings run up.Grats to those who hung in there during the slump. 
They’ll reach 10 million subs by tomorrow 
some how i don't see any crash here ...i think Disney+ is going to be the new kid on the block with 100+millions subscribers....
Don't worryNext Friday 200$+ againYou all know this is a 450-500$+ stock by the end of the year
"“We are pleased to deliver another substantial dividend to shareholders, reflecting our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019,” said Robert A. Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company. “With the upcoming launch of our Disney+ service and a greatly expanded portfolio of powerful brands and businesses from our acquisition of 21st Century Fox, we’re confident that the company is extremely well-positioned for continued growth.”"
"I cancelled my disney+, Hulu, ESPN+...not giving them any more of my money!"
Great companyTomorrow earnings 200$+Buy buy buy
"CMCSA knows they won’t get FOX now with today’s news, so the “win” or concession for them now is to drive the price up and make DIS pay more. I believe CMCSA will come back with a bid of $42 per share, then DIS will top that with final offer of less than or equal to $45"
"This is becoming a binary event and I think Iger is playing it for all its worth. He put together hit releases for final quarter, spent on technology refresh in Q2&3 and is sitting on a gold mine with Disney +. By not releasing numbers he is building excitement and a thrill for investors. Ride this through earnings and enjoy this ride. It’s not very often you get to invest in new deals that change a company "
"The current correction has reached the extent of two of the last three major Dow crashes since 1987. This also explains why the market is slowly starting to move back upwards. In the coming months, however, the risk remains that sales will continue in the dimension of the 2008 financial crisis. That would give a Dow level at 14,000 points."
"Posters keep on asking 145 is too high to get in. I would say no, if you are not in yet. But as it is under 140, stop hesitating if you are not a holder of Disney. If it goes under 135, I might add.And I saw one other commentator state what I already believe and stated, Disney ganging up with sure-fired hits are geared to Disney+'s opening. You want to see Avengers End Game (or anything leading up to it) - get Disney Plus! Toy Story? - Disney+. Aladdin? - Disney+. Lion King (the first or second)> - Disney+. The only ""fly"" in the ointment is Dumbo, and I'm hoping that it gleans a following on Disney+. I'm hoping that Disney announces that it has 10 million subscribers for Disney+ on its cc in early February (and nice rises for Hulu and ESPN+) - that will mean Disney is going to be over 200 in February, 2020 - mark my words!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
Tradings predictions are 0-7 since Saturday. He’s so bad that he’s posting from fake handles to avoid more beat down. Same excuse for that loser D who disappeared. I told I all last week when I bought in before investor day this thing is going up into 175-200 range over 1-2 years. Possibly more but I try to remain realistic.
"i think the n f l ratings show that the average person is getting tired about the antics of the players,the interference in the game by the officials, and poor announcers. i get tired of the players acting like they won the lottery after every decent play the make."
"Looking to score tickets to the hotly anticipated ""Avengers: Endgame""? Get in line. Just as presale ticket sales for the next Marvel Studios film went online Tuesday morning, sales just as quickly seemed to have gone offline. The rush of activity took down the AMC Theatres site and app, left fans with over hour-long waits at ticketing site Fandango, and also caused issues with the Regal Cinemas and Atom Tickets apps.MONSTER"
"Disney — Disney stock fell 1.5% Friday after it announced the Shanghai Disney resort will close until further notice as officials try to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The closure comes at what would normally be an exceptionally busy time for the resort, China's seven-day Lunar New Year holiday"
"Anyone with over 10 years experience, is what's going on in the market normal when shifting from a bull to bear market?"
Added DIS to my portfolio recently. I expect this company to grow tremendously over the next 5 years. Disney+ faces no competition for the youth streaming market. Intellectual property and production is AAA+. Multiple diverse revenue segments.
You’re out of your mind if you think this is going back down . Launching Tuesday in Australia and New Zealand and Frozen 2 coming out next week . Will reach 150 million subscribers before the end of the year
Could it be $500 this year base on the subscribers blow out this week?
first bit of good news about coronavirus and this is back over 120 and the momentum will be based on whats happening with Disney plus which likely means by the end of year Dis will hit new highs. 5 dollars of downside and 40 of upside with a stock you can sleep at night holding.
Aladdin looking like the next billion dollar franchise... with lion king and toy story yet to come bank on at least 4 franchise billion dollar hits this summer.
The best play for growth and value. I am all in.
"Where is Disney Stock Price going to be when they announce over 60 million subs in 2019? 200$, $300, $400, $500, $600? Disney+ is a Trillion dollar platform!"
I sold before opening....this should be down earnings were terrible I don't get it
Bob's burgers used to watch on Netflix now I will be watching it on Disney plus
Up after hours! My expectation is $205 tomorrow:) 100 million subscribers that's something most likely will take disney to $250 in a month or so
This is HUGELY overvalued. Look at the 2021 fiscal report. It should not be at this level but much much lower. There is no fundamental reason for this to be perched at ATH zone.Yahoo censored me for saying this in a previous comment.
"I believe that END GAME will pass 1 billion dollars by Sunday, so DIS hit the jackpot in less than a week. The real cost is around 500 million dollars including the ads and promotion. So by rule of thumb, DIS starts to make money since this coming Monday. Let's see how much DIS will go up this week. Mario predicted that DIS will be 160 by June. A lot of analysts give the top DIS at 140, we can tell that MARIO should be the better guess."
Watch this finish green. What a gift for those that had powder to take advantage.
"This has been another fun and exciting week for both Dis and the overall market.From my perspective, Dis has been slowly building steam despite the ""scary"" market.Even if Dis only jumps in the AM, and gradually comes back down in the pm, so long as Dis maintains it support levels I will continue to hope for the best. Up, down, or sideways, good luck on Monday everyone!Enjoy your weekends."
4 words:Avengers Infinity War April
no joke this could pop $5-$10 tomorrow
I’m crying with so much JOY.....I love you Disney!!!And this is just the beginning!!!!!
"Seems to be quite strong in early morning action. Any reasons why??Maybe the Avengers End Game opening?? I see continued strength in it opening at $300 million. Some movie theaters are going to be open 24 hours a day. I don't think we saw this with Star Wars, The Force Awakens. Helps with the the head winds of the 3 hour plus running time. I read that they have upwards of $140 million in presale tickets. Star Wars TFA had about $100 million, but a fair amount of that was for a week later on Christmas Day. There is unlikely much of these presales after the first weekend. To those that say one movie isn't really much of an effect on profits, I once read that for each $100 million in box office, you gain 2 cents of profits for Disney. That may be slightly affected by the increase in stock shares as a result of the Fox purchase. I really think that you could see $3 billion. That would translate into 60 cents a share. I am unsure of the quarter for Jan. - March's results, but the next quarter I think you might see $2.25."
"Disney put in a price protection on their stock for around 114 on the Fox deal. Funny how the stock doesn't stay above 114 for a long period of time...until tomorrow, that is. :)"
Oh boy another upgrade to 165 pre earnings  that’s two back to back lol I’m guessing smart money is moving in before earnings gl everyone and have a great day
Coronavirus cases reported waaay down in Hubei. Big up tomorrow.
Fingers crossed. Dis opens 119+ new all time high by lunch. ...just my bias opinion. 
Disney already hit 100 million!
"Seen on Yahoo news today: BREAKING: “Avengers: Endgame” now stands as the second-biggest movie of all time with $2.188 billion worldwide.The Marvel juggernaut became the fastest film to gross $2 billion globally in just 11 days, crushing “Avatar’s” record of 47 days."
"According to an article published today, Disney+ was the number one 'breakout' entertainment app in the U.S. for 2020 (in terms of year-over-year growth)"
Bye comcast
"my plan for Christmas , sitting on the couch and watching Disney plus"
one trillion three hundred dollar stock end of summer
"what a SCAM...this market is so rigged ""Longs"" Congrats it is what it is however you know it shouldn't be but that's the way it goes,cant fault you guys for ""hitting it"" Shorts I have no words I'm sitting on (100) 115 PUTS...I'm with ya, how this stock is up is beyond words I guess disney is TRULY magical and ""MICKEY"" waved his wand....let's hope for the best"
Why the stick plunge? Maybe numbers are not good and was pre-inflated fir a drop of 10% after earnings just like mm's played retail with Apple
"This play is getting really old. I've seen it so many times with AAPL.Every time when the earning report is released on Thursday, on Friday the stock won't move a bit, because all those option sellers/hedge funds will keep it down. They will let Friday's options pass, then pump up the prices on the next trading day.Disney just had a blown-out quarter. Not only it earned much more than anticipated (+0.32c vs -0.38c), the subscription number is much higher as well ( 94m vs 90m), the AH rose up for the great numbers.But then today, why it doesn't go up to the roof like NFLX did? Yeah, all because of option sellers, and hedge fund guys who happily oblige them. This is market manipulation, plain and simple.So load up your stock or options now, Tuesday we will see the real momentum."
I predict that analysts will have to raise price target and rating before Xmas and this will be another boost for the stock. Q4 results will beat expectations when you factor in Disney+ and Movie results. Onward and upward
Some good news to ponder we are making another higher low today that’s second day in a row and options expire tomorrow so that should be interesting 
"After their April media day, with the announcement of specific Disney+ programming, the stock jumped from the teens (plus 100) to the upper 140's. What happened since? -- they blew past expectations, and announced over 10 million signups in the first day (analysts would have been satisfied with that number by the end of the year, if not after one year). They are not making any more announcements until the February earnings conference call (in accordance to the announcement of the 10 million plus first day signups). I am going to through out a number of 25 million. I could be as high as 40 million. Why you might ask? - I can't really believe that every parent signed up in the first day - a lot had other things to do. And grandparents don't have any motivation until Thanksgiving and Christmas (and other holidays) arrive. And their has just been a lot of growing excitement with the good reviews of the Mandalorian, which is released on a week to week basis (no immediate binge watching!!!).If Disney has a number of 20 million, it will approach 160. 25 million - 165; 40 million - 175 plus. Then we are going to see a few other issues play out over the next year - Does Disney continue to expand its subscribers? Does it lose subscribers when the promotional rates end? How are the international roll outs going (I think Australia has started - any numbers there?).Before Disney entered the streaming wars and bought Fox, I saw Disney as a sure home run - it had a steady growing base of media, parks, royalties, and movies, and selling its content to the streaming media, and was buying back stock at a good rate, so that it was going to increase earnings per share to about $25 over the next 10 - 15 years (the buy backs were a major component). This is a real gamble, but see the better returns over the next 30 years (can you see 1 billion subscribers at $20 per month??). I can."
"According to Snow White, Sneezy is hung like a pony."
The market should be up tomorrow because Apple beat reduced estimates and it should uplift technology and media companies.
I’m gonna write out my predictions and analysis on Disney when i go on lunch. stay tuned.
Disney said they would be letting investors know of how many customers they sign on a continuous basis...Deep pockets .Netflix trades at a pe of 90 plus Disney at 17..Disney will look cheap at $175.00
They are going through Comcast earnings on CNBC - they are acting like it is another Disney! NOT!
"Pension funds, institutional investors, investors over all who see the educational and entertainment value of Disney going forward into our future, mic drop"
"$150 here we go , they are doing all the right moved and the opportunity for future growth/profit is incredible. The analyst need to wake up..Apple may acquire 1 day ."
Every couple that gives birth to their first child instantly makes them a future Disney+ customer 3/4 yrs later. And that is not going to change FOREVER!!! They continue to create a new princess character every 5 yrs. Disney is a family oriented powerhouse.
The mouse just woke up after a multi-year wintersleep? Never seen DIS move this much.... wild stuff. I can only conclude that a lot of investors have just come to realize that Disney is joining the streaming scene - and that this is a good idea.
"We have an interesting week.First, we have some news on the sale of the local sports cable channels. They seem to have been sold for $10 (not including the $3.5 billion for Yes). This may be a disappointment. It may also had been calculated into already. We have the opening of Avengers End Game. I could be a worldwide $3 billion bonanza. I could be only $1.5 billion. It is more likely about $2.25. But if it breaks $1 billion worldwide this weekend, watch out. And this is a very tricky thing. We might be able to see some early returns from overseas on Wednesday."
"a board bet ...from here on out every 5 buck move DIS makes, the ATM strike moves as do the calls and puts ...so my point is, say, come november/december if DIS was to make a serious momentum/anticipation/bandwagon run with a slew of noob investors to 200 bucks ...my board bet is that our ol' board pal joe will definitely be along for the ride ""warning and begging"" us to continue to follow his lead and take our profits and buy puts. what's my point? ol' joe is simply a chaser himself hoping to buy lower, sell higher and play options to hedge his 18-yr old-like game. hint: there are over 1000 joes on yahoo mb's ...but some of them are just more of those pesky flies that buzz around during a barbecue :)"
Anyone else thinking about loading up in $185 calls? Sept expiration
The trolls are resurfacing. This must be a good sign.
I don’t see Monday being good for Disney with the updates from this weekend...
"Disney is far more likely to sink to $85 than to increase to $135. Here is my take:$7/mo subscription for Disney+ and 50M subs means revenue of $4.2B. Disney had $70B revenue last reporting year which would mean Disney+ accounts for less than 6% total revenue yet this stock is up 10%+ over recent news on Disney+. Sounds like market pumping to me and it will pop. We all know the serious damages the pandemic will hold on parks but people don't seem to realize how it will effect parks long-term. The precautions won't go away and Disney won't be able to operate at full capacity for many years, if ever again. Combine these issues with the operating costs, and you have a Disney company with less profit margins and ultimately a worse performing stock compared to other companies. There are much better companies to invest in right now."
Marvel tV show set in Wakanda in works black panther director signs 5 year deal with series on CNBC

Now that the correction has started how low can we see this go ?
picked it up at 109. soooo long on this one!

Would like to know others thoughts on Comcast potentially try to top Disney’s bid to buy Fox?
I would choose a disney plus subscription over Netflix any given day. Families around the world are gonna love it. Disney is the undisputed king of content. It’s a no brainer.
Fellow Mouseketeers. This is what happens when the planets aligned for your company. Like owning Amazon when the cloud came along or Apple now with 5G. Now we have Disney with streaming where content is king. And among all the pretenders in the jungle....Disney is The Lion King.
Disney needs to reign in it's actors who spew out hatred . ( lion king ). until that happens no shares for me .
Disney way undervalued. $152.00 I estimate it's worth based on ticket sales.
117.2 today
I will be paying to watch Mulan. For a cool 29.99 my 3 kids and my wife will enjoy it from our TV. Instead of paying 60 dollars plus drinks popcorn. Thank y out very much
Rah... holding prices like it has park traffic growth and strong box office and higher cruise rates. Looool I laugh at you fairytale longs buying here. Viacom has better earnings that this
Disney is still paying some employees through these hard times. It’s hard on the numbers at the end of the day but I am willing to jump back in if it goes down to 40 we’re sold out last time.
"With all the IP they have their streaming service is going to outperform Netflix. The parks are starting to bring in significant revenue as well, the book value from Disney's property aassets alone is astounding."
"What's the cause for this rise, not complaining but I had already buckled down for the dip "
Anyone hear of Apple TV having any technical difficulties? Disney is too popular 
Cancel DIS+ they are all about censorship
Cynical stocks are gonna skyrocket this year.
Any word on DIS declaring a dividend yet ??
Just saw Mary Poppins Returns;It was perfect In Every Way!Another masterpiece!
"Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World Resort are going to stay shut down until further notice, a spokesperson for Walt Disney Co. said in an emailed statement.The spokesperson said this is due to ""this unprecedented pandemic"" and follows ""direction provided by health experts and government officials.""Disney is going to keep paying its hourly parks and resorts staff through April 18, the spokesperson said."
"Disney Cost To Make Movie??Anyone know why Disney spends considerably more for its animated movies ($125MM to $175MM) compared to Illumination (Despicable Me, Secret Life of Pets) which typically spends $75MM per animated movie? Yes, Disney quality is better but for that much extra production cost???"
Disney Board meeting
Look at what happened to Shopify when it cuts its sky high guidance today! Even Shopify is affected by the outbreak of coronavirus.What about Disney? When will Disney announce that it is cutting guidance for 2020? Will Disney also cut or remove their dividend?
"Dropping below $100 from what I'm see it's due in large part that Comcast is tentatively offering more than Disney is for Fox. Murdoch wants DIS to get it because he still maintains some control, while the Fox shareholders want Comcast to get it while they make more money; at least that's my understanding."
Disney is all over the place. Who's driving this train?
"...just as WalMart ""lost it"" less than 10 years after Sam died, so too did Mouseketeers in 70's after Walt left this earth... I remember his Sunday monologues... he would NOT approve of today's pc-correct sterile pablum being served up as ""family entertainment""... or sports... or news... all biased to a sad rotten core... I would not own this ticker for any profit for any good purpose..."

Good to see this acting like it should! Now keep it rolling!
Interesting timing tonight for the onslaught of GC posts. Interesting because I really didn’t see much on here today until after the ER was released.
"This is no longer Disney of parks, movies, etc. Disney has embraced technology, and has over 61M subscribers × $7/month × 12 months = $5.12 BILLIONS per year....and DISNEY+ streaming keeps growing. That is why you see price lingering arond $120 and not going down...I would like to go down to add more during times of uncertainty but next year as we go out of COVID, with other business segments picking up revenues, DIS will pop."
This is making my buy-in with cost basis of $23.96 look pretty good right now!
loving this!!
Walt Disney reached an all time high at 185.24
Aw man
Give me 110 for a buy order. Theme parks are closed. Movies delayed.
Disney market cap of $200Bn now updated for FOX!
"i have a gut feeling that disney stock is gonna explode after earnings to record highs. The parks have been packed this quarter, disney plus is bringing in truck loads of cash, and forcast should be strong with new shows and movies coming spring and summer to Disney+ then add Mando season 2 in the fall. this is a great stock to buy and hold for the next 5 years. $300 is achievable."
"Buy at $98, sell at $101. This has been the trend for a while now."
They should bring the dividend back.

"Excited about Disney streaming service!! Gonna be a game changer having all the classics be accessible! Will definitely be happily paying to watch Disney, marvel, Pixar movies!!"
Oh wait and there’s more ... Frozen 2 will be out in two weeks ... and that’s not all Star Wars next month !!! Love it !!! Go Disney!!
It makes no sense.They are hurting in all departments and the stock goes up.
Hearing recent news that DIS will move movie releases to D+ is huge. Times are changing and DIS is moving along with the pace of change. Theaters will find alternative revenues from gaming. Gaming is becoming the next big social media play. D+ will blow all others away in 3-5 years.
Going to hold this until it hits $400 like Netflix and Roku ... Disney will be around forever!!!
DIS needs to throttle way back on the wokeness.
"congrats to everyone who held,,i wish i did,,,,i just was spooked with that drop again the other day,, made a good profit butt should have just bought a put to protect if they plunged it again,, with 2500 shares i did not want to see a 10 point drop ,,so took my 5 point profit,,,so its a good win just not the great win i was looking for,,"
Anybody knows the exact day when the Disney+ number of subscribers will be released? what about those subscribed using the D23 special deal?
if earning and guidance are good it might touch 150 end of week
I am not short Disney. Wandavision is a complete waste of time as even at the end of the series it tells you basically nothing and does little to advance the MCU outside of vague references. The entire plot could have been compressed into 1 or 2 episodes. Save time and find faster ways to watch it if you must see it.
will Disney go down to 85 by Friday or will this stimulus package make the stock go up to 105ish? what do you think
wow what a great company I can see the news DIS beats earning est by %30 only loses -.30 a share instead of -.42 and only 170 bucks for that .
You know after Trumps tweet nobody would sell today and forgoe the dividend so you can watch how MM’s us options to control price until demand swells up and over runs them.
$145 today???
Pretty soon it will be $150
155 I’ll faint
"I think you have the wrong conception on whats going to happen when Disney release their own streaming content. I dont think netflix will lose much subscribers but more what will happen is people will see streaming is the way to go and have both netflix and disney and so on. The companies that will be losing shares are the cable providers. Both Netflix and Disney will dominate the streaming platform because of content and the delivery of that content. I'm not concerned about Netflix because they deliver a different niche of products and it is already known what really drove subcription growth for Netflix in the first place which was when they started delivering marvel series to their streaming content. Then after is when Netflix began delivering their own originals. Imagine Pixar series, Star Wars series, new Marvel series coming to Disney streaming content. That is not even considering the kid programs that can be added. Imagine espn and fox sport( when Diseny owns Fox)being bundled into this package. live news, UFC, Movies that were in theaters, the lis goes on and on of what is capable on Diseny streaming platform. I find it very hard for Disney to not succeed in the streaming business."
between disney plus and all the new updates coming to Disney Parks. this will be $200+ in 1 year.
Big Joe hammering it down LONG N DEEP!
"Disney is undervalued at this level. Stock will easily hit $300/share this year, and possibly $500 / share this year. All this is is profit taking. People didn't want to take profits last month so they wouldn't be taxed for it in April. If retailers are smart you buy their shares. If you are not smart you are selling shares. Smart money is adding during this dip."
\HEELS  UP HARRIS!I wonder how she got that name. Anyone? She won't tell us.
"DIS is country and audience neutral. It appeals to audience of all ages and specially children and we know DIS will appeal to children in every country out there that can stream DIS on their devices. I think it would not take more than 2 years to reach 50M subscribers. At current level of 10M subscribers, it's $840M revenue per year with great margin as they already own all the content and licenses."
BMO Capital upgrades DIS from Perform to Outperform up Target from $114 to $140.
Interesting to see DIS up in a very red market open.
To Infinity and beyond!!! Go Disney!!!
"I could have nabbed me some at 129, damn. I knew this was coming. But I still got in though, and very happy I did. Look at netflix as an easy comp to what Disney can easily become (369.15). Disney will be the key streaming service every household, my bold prediction, will have. We are entering the inexpensive multiple stream phase or era, and it seems like for the foreseeable future, will be here to stay for a very very very very very very long, very long, extremely long, yes, time. The other streaming services, ie netflix will be a specialty content streaming service, but the main service in any household, will be Disney, that will touch every market sector, = age range, is DIS. And we haven't talked about other sectors, such as geographical locations, and if any streaming service has an iota of a chance to break into the chinese strict censorship for their public consumption, it's the mouse that has a chance. And DIS is positioning themselves for a piece of the specialty content action, ergo, the comcast deal. The magic kingdom is moving to the real world now, as far as the entertainment, living room watching sector. They have what matters most= CONTENT tried and proven for over a hundred years, it's basically checkmate. And DIS is actually pulling it off, like a smooth surgeon, ninja. Good on them, and all of us investors. 6.99? A month. At millions on a monthly basis?...this will increase er revenues to such a massive level. This stock will only go up. Solid americana brand."
closing today at 199 or more
lot of manipulation this week. looks like a big run up after ER is released
Patience
Fundamentals are out the window. Everything is upside down.
33 days till Disney plus launches and takes the world by storm !!!!
"The market sold off hard at the last hour, but Disney manage to stay above $135. This stock is strong. Hang on tight for the rocket launch"
This will go up on Tuesday. In talks with NBA to restart season at Disney in Orlando in July.
"I guess that I knew that a red day was coming, and I am prepared to buy into it, but it still hurts a bit to see the red after so much green. Ha ha ha."
why down pre market?
Remember yesterday morning how we were all siting here saying it was going to 150..
"Very few times do you get an opportunity like this to buy a company with the ability to quickly scale to NFLX subscribers in less than two years not to mention they have strong in roads to China which would allow them to surpass NFLX in a day lol China loves two American past times Basketball (ESPN) and Disney World  This is the beginning of watching TV through streaming and Disney owns media content and creation. It will be paying its studios to create new content unlike NFLX they own both sides of the coin, they buy content from themselves which only increases their revenue as a company. If you don’t buy Disney and hold for next 18 months it will be one of the biggest investment missed imho "
$160 tomorrow...people moving fund from Netflix to DIS
Here's to hoping all the crybabies of this board that complain daily will sell today. Leave a long term play like Disney to real investors.
I hope D does stay around. He is our good luck charm. If he leaves... Dis may tank!
"We have big problems. UPDATESCoronavirus pandemic changes way of lifeBy Jessie Yeung, Joshua Berlinger, Adam Renton, Meg Wagner, Emma Reynolds and Mike Hayes, CNN"
Black Panther OVER A BILLION IN REV. DIS WILL GAP UP ON Monday.
DIS on fire today. Too bad rest of my stocks are #$%$ the bed.
Just heard that Disney cut bonuses for Bob Over and others. This may indicate that they are having BIG problems that we have Not been made aware of yet. I don't know how to interpret. Very cautious
With a budget of approximately 200 million if Black Panther makes around 800 million worldwide (conservative estimate based on Thor and Guardians 2) it's a nice payday for Disney. That's not including the licensing and merch associated with the new movie and franchise. Add another multi-film super-hero franchise to the Disney stable. I'd be willing to bet sequels are already in the works. I don't think anyone thought Panther was going to be this well received with overwhelmingly positive praise. Nice surprise and will hopefully move the stock on Tuesday.
"CNBC Half time hosts all say Disney goes up from here, thats why we got the quick bump up."
Don’t know why....this movie was phenomenal and much better than the first one that ended with $750MM global total. https://variety.com/2019/film/news/maleficent-mistress-of-evil-box-office-opening-1203375715/
Morgan Stanley raised to 135 target from 130
I think that the spike is a reaction to this news story that came out about 45 minutes ago:https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/14/disney-was-the-most-downloaded-app-in-the-u-s-in-q4-2019/
"disnety,,,like a said could NOT hold 112,,too much selling was happening,, 109.50 is the buy"
Any predictions on next week? Back to 140 or back to 145?It will be an exciting week either way. I predict Disney will beat on Tuesday.
"you know you are holding a good one when shorts just give up and start posting ""Please SELLLL"" :) hahaha."
"alright, most pirated show in 2020! Beat out game of thrones. Great news for popularity, but not so good as it's being stolen???"
May close green - whaaaaat?
WHAT happens when the numbers fall off the table because all the free memberships expire //explain that on to me.
Makes 32c profit vs. estimated 38c loss. Stock up over 4 points after hours and climbing. Go Mickey!
160s by year end especially after reporting more than 20 million subscribers for Disney+ and success of the Rise of Skywalker
Wonderful stock to own right now!
Disney+ is just getting started. Once Disney electes new leadership to see the potential for streaming their products it will unlock value like never before in their entire company history.
I just noticed Disney's market cap is above Netflix. ;)
"Here's an interesting article to contradict anyone who tries to scare people into not buying Disney because a ""recession is coming"". It's from 2016 but true today, even more so with Disney+ around the corner. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3960025-invest-recession-proof-business-disney"
Seems like it's setting for a healthy correction.
"BIG TIME momentum coming in 2021. Parks will reopen, Marvel shows galore on Dis+, movie theater revs back at some point. Streaming is the big game changer though. It's going to push the stock way up! Deniers will be disappointed. Too bad for them!"
"Wondering how much Disney movies sales will drop as a result of Disney+? All the DVD/BlueRay movies everyone was buying are now free for a year. Anyone with kids buys more than $100 a year of Disney, Star Wars or Avengers movies. I see this as a loss for Disney’s revenue."
will be up higher tomorrow than current AH levels when banks raise their price targets and reiterate overweight ratings. JPMorgan has $DIS as top pick.
Did everyone hear the update on the earnings call? Iger said the Disney+ subscriber number has grown to 28.6 million subscribers as of February 3!What do you think is going to happen as more content and exposure increases globally?
Congrats to you longs go Disney!!!
Why would anyone hold Netflix stock when Disney is about to run way ahead of them. Not to mention all the upcoming movies and new park openings. To name a few reasons why Disney is crazy cheap.
WOW ... yeehaw!!!Avengers: Endgame' passes 'Avatar' to become the highest-grossing film ever
"it's great to see the rise of DIS , creator of the rise of sky walker.this stock should and would be at least $175, or more by now, it's a bit slow getting there. but will get there."
Great streaming service numbers and COVID gone by fall equals stock price going up! BUY MORE!
What’s a good sp to get on board?
Should be a fun day longs. Close out at 145is my guess
Hopefully 140 tomorrow!!!!!!
"Wow, wandavision audience just blowing numbers away compared to Netflix. Show is confusing as heck but it draws a crowd"
"Winter Soldier premieres today, could be good for next week!"
Netflix upgraded today.Surely Disney will this time next year be a streaming giant! Get into Disney now!
can someone tell me why we cannot see Disney's P/E?
Cancel Disney Plus
We all knew this would happen but it's nice to see it official! https://www.slashfilm.com/hulu-disney-add-on/
13 days away from earnings. big money trying to shake out weak hands and assume position at a cheap price. Long and strong!
"Not sure if someone is trying desperately to keep this below $142, or trying desperately to get it above $142."
"In at 136, happy to join the Dis Shareholder Fam!"
ATTENTION: Please be advised that this company has zero income from about 1/3 of its operations being shut down. Debt has increased in order to pay executives as well as dividends. Outlook is very questionable due to no vaccine. Please be advised that past performance is no guarantee of future results. Plan accordingly.
I agree with analysts saying Disney is underestimating how popular their streaming will be.
Lol all these bag holders desperate for 200 price. It’s never going to see 200 for rest of the year. Enjoy your bleed down to 150 this year.
Newsom needs to intern for DeSantis to see how things are done.The state of california and reopening...
Disney you LOSE
have a great weekend longs!!! we have been waiting for this :) party hardy time
I wished alphabet would pop today like dis cos i own both!
"If Disney decides to close their US parks, this stock is headed to $65. Fairly close to its book value. I’m going to wait."
Going below 100 more delays in sports revenue for espn park openings delayed ... covid surging
Anyone else having connection issue with Disney+? I can stream just fine on my phone but my brand new TV won't connect. I've heard it's a known issue. I can't say that I'm mad though... Disney+ broke the internet twice! First time was when they broke the D23 website with sign-ups! That means the subscriber numbers must be insane!!! Go Disney!!!
"This time next year, after the roll out of Disney+ the stock will be up by $40 or more."
Jim Cramer upgrade disney twice this weekBuy buy buy now Cheap stock
Are people expecting a pull back after the 11th? Looking to double my position if it heads back to 115!
Buy the dip 
"Three short months ago, Disney was sitting at $129... Reading this MB, you would think this is the worst stock in the market. Everyone posting negativity is not a long term investor, because long term investors are still up 30-50 percent. Go get a bottle and a blanket short term holders."
DIS should buyout EA or other game developer...anyone agree?Next level of synergy.huge growthNew interactive opportunitiesSeems like a missing componentWhich company would be best fitStream\create communities on Dis+
When will this break 145?
"hey all , been on vacation.. missed a lot stuff happening. I am glad Disney went down so much into ER.. I think we will be happy tonight :) Bought some more calls on Disney yesterday. Should be nice up-trend in coming weeks."
"Disney needs to forget about Fox. It's over priced. All it needs to do is team up with Netflix. Not buy it, but be a partner with it.Both stocks will be much higher. Of course you can't discount what GOOG and AAPL can do."
"When fundamentals break down, like they have with Amazon two weeks ago, and now with Disney, the breakdown and dis-connect is getting worse and will be swift."
Netflix will always be the best
wait till you all start hearing the subscription numbers. Will be close to $150.
"$DIS and $NFLXwho going to ultimate winner.Business perspective both will winner along with CBS and HBO. (HULU will majority own by Disney soon and likely buy atleast time warner 10%, Comcast might not sell it's 30% given fight between company)Stock perspective:-NFLX will big loser (Current Growth is unsustainable and so it will take many years to justify such valuation)Disney:- Huge winner. They likely worth $250B valuation in 3 year as it become clear that it's wining market share. (WIth so much superhits kids content, Sports It sure going to take over market share).Apple is disruptor and can take huge pile of money to take over market. Disney still winner because Apple willing to pay high dollar for content still."
This is dropping so fast it reminds me of my first swirly.
Markets will bounce due to stimulus package before markets opens. How much and his long needs to be seen
Any less than $200 is undervalued.
"The Box Office for Thor and Coco are looking up.Thor seemed to have nice box offices for the last few days - it was tracking nicely in step with Dr. Strange, but it seemed to jump up a little over the tracking of Dr. Strange at the same time. Although it will hit a brick wall when Star Wars comes out, it is helpful. It is very possible, particularly with a nice weekend, that it may do over 315 million domestic. And the overseas numbers are still doing nicely. I've been saying that the worldwide box office is going to limp towards $850 million, and probably fall short - I think it might just beat that $850 with a little to spare (not much to spare, but something).And Coco seems to be breaking out nicely - it was running about 10 - 15 % under Moana (which just fell short of $250 million), and was compared to the Box Office of Tangled (which did just over $200 million). But over the past 4 days its gone past Moana's numbers on a day to day basis. It will interesting whether, on an absolute basis, whether it beats Moana's weekend business a year ago on an absolute number basis. If it does, it can approach Moana's numbers. It will be hard to beat Moana's $248 million domestic number, but it could hit $240 million. And if the overseas numbers hold up, you will see a total number tht beats the overseas number of nearly $650 million - perhaps $750 million.If you don't think that these numbers mean much, I'd say this - I really think that Disney was a touch disappointed with the numbers last year from Moana, Guardian of the Galaxy, Pirates, and Cars. I'm not saying that they were disappointed (well, maybe with Cars), but they probably saw a scenario where they could have gleaned another $500 million in box office - and that would have given Disney with just a slightly better year end figures. That may be the reason that Disney is only buying back about $6 billion in stock, and didn't increase dividends by another penny or two."
"They did run the band up to 142.90 today. The question is...what warranted the run? Was it just because the rest of the market was flat and down with DIS being a safehaven stock? I have a real hard time believing the daytraders won't dump this tomorrow, no seasoned trader will hold this into a holiday. Only longs perhaps,but lets be honest the daytraders run this stock."
who in the right mind would visit Disneyland and Disney World or even watch in the theaters while COVID-19 is uncontained? Disney+ is not big enough yet to counter the decline of the park's. DIS will be in the 90s. The overall market still has frothy valuation
"Oddly, every single one of my stocks are up except DIS. After yesterday's close and after hours, thought we'd see $204 at the open."
"DIS green and up a lot by end of the day. For who ever fears, you should buy more. Because Star War, theme park, streaming that DIS is in right position. Time to cancel NETFLIX. FLIP it over."
Indicators are on strong buy at the moment
Disney needs to come out with some Disney + t-shirts. I would buy one in a heart beat. Free promotion.
"And Andy, tell me...how profitable is Netflix now after how many years in the business? They lost money for years to get 160M subscribers. Disney has 50M in a matter of months. What’s Netflix’s market capitalization - 162B vs DIS at 182B. Can Netflix cross sell via their programming into their merchandising, theme park, etc. businesses once this mess passes? After all of these people and their children sitting have been sitting at home watching Disney + for a few months, what do you think they’ll be buying and want to go on vacation? Wall Street and anyone with any brains wants to see subscriber numbers at this point, not some meager profit."
"Only folks worried about Dis price right now are shorts. Anyone long on Dis knows that 120-130 is just the tip of the iceberg.If you feel like gambling, good luck.My strategy remains the same. Keep adding shares when affordable, and hold on for YEARS. Untill then, laugh at the nonsense. Cheers Dis Fam! You know whats up. "
"Invest in after hours, will return great dividends!"
Can earnings take it passed $200?
Only hold long term if you believe Disney will succeed with their streaming service. Do not buy into the fox deal hype. That’s only good for headlines and for media to talk up. In actuality the only guarantee is getting back x-men and ff; they will replace avengers or allow them to spread them further out.
"Disney and Appl #$%$ up. Same thing going to happen to DIS. Drop 10% aftwr earnings, watch!"
"Since the 153 price, this is the 3 bounce off the lows of 145-146 range. Strongly hoping for a year rally to 160!"
"Bob Iger ran out the door with house on fire. Smart man, somebody else problem. Kind of like having VP Pence in charge of virus problem. Somebody has to be the fall guy."
"The Disney dividend of 88 cents has now been in place for 3 semi annual payments. The last time Disney didn't increase their dividend was in the years 2008 and 2009. I believe that Disney is just being a little conservative and wanting to pay down the Fox debt. They've stopped the stock buy backs already (I am actually hoping that they are spending some money on secretly buying back some stock, however minor it is). This may be the reason for the leveling off. I wouldn't worry too much. Disney is very conservative. The real event to look at is the number of Disney+ subscribers that they will give you at the February earnings conference call, as well as the ESPN+ and Hulu numbers. I do think that something like 40 million is possible."
"i added today. Also will add disney streaming service. I have fire tv and netflix. I keep spending to much time finding decent movies on netflix. A lot of series and third quality films. Poor acting. If all DIS stock holders add the service, it should be a good way to support your company. How about the praks being closed? The market looks six months ahead. Also they are talking today about opening parks with a temperature check."
"The deal is going through.1. DIS has the best offer for fox, .2745 DIS shares to each fox share plus $13 billion in cash=100 *1.85 billion shares x.2745+13=63.8 billion offer, Everyone only keeps stating the value of the share offer, forgeting that DIS is also taking on $13 billion of debt from FOX, which a cash offer does not.2. Comcast won't do deal unless ATT deal is approved3. Comcast does not have the funding yet for such a deal--only trying to get approval nowAs for the big drop, DIS is still in its trading range of 98-mid 100's, We are still higher than it was a few days ago, buy when its under 100, sell above 100. Keep some for the eventual turn up. The company is not going bankrupt, has a solid balance sheet, great increasing earnings--it will eventually have a break out move up and will soar like it did when it went from 34 to 100."
so whats the story around the stock price holding flat? is it because the counter offer seems too high?
Y isnt the share going up with good earning report?
"CNBC Guest today said all Disney business are very busy, The cruse ships ,the parks.the movies. Summer time is when more of all they offer is bought. It makes people happy,including the stock."
to infinity and beyond
"honestly reading these messages are funny. alot of people explanation for high share prices are like ""why not"". you guys should do research on Disney. Disney makes 11 billion dollars from box office hits. lets all be honest movie theaters are never coming back, their a dead industry, they were dying covid just expedited it. and Disney makes 20$ a month per user from cable. so you have 11 billion from box office hits and cable revenues from ESPN Disney channel declining rapidly. all your doing at best is replacing current revenues with Disney Plus at a 30x multiple. at 500 a share thats 60x and at 750 a share thats 90x. thats ridiculous. and Disney has alot of baggage, they have 200k workers so if there's another recession and the parks have 50% occupancy their basically losing money. its a cyclical business. Netflix only has 10k workers. thats why Netflix enjoys the tech multiple, less workers, high concentration of algorithms and high focussed. Disney is not a tech company their a tech enabled company. Now if Disney Plus is spun into a separate ipo which I doubt will ever happen because it leaves the park business vulnerable then Disney Plus is a tech company by itself. And tbh I dont think consumers will pay 20$ a month for Disney Plus, I think 13 max so they'll never replace their cable revenues. I think Disney is valued fairly at 185, will probably go to 90 in a recession when multiples shrink and gold rises as inflation rises. my guess 2025-2027. btw this is coming from a guy that bought nio at 1.35, Tesla at 185, qep at 20 cents and GameStop at 5$, I know a thing or two about analyzing stocks."
As ive been saying all week. Will end today at 4PM right near 130
"I was just watching news coverage on the Fox deal, and a reporter mentioned that 20% of viewed content on Netflix is Disney content. In theory that means that Disney will grab about 20% of Netflix subscribers, plus those who aren't subscribed to Netflix but are Disney lovers, when it launches it's streaming service. That would be a great start!"
"To all you naysayers, Shanghai Disneyland sold out its tickets within minutes of opening at 8am! Who says Dis is dead money! The harder u push this giant down, the higher it jumps back up, it's like compressed spring when released. Disney+ is doing extremely well too, signing up over 50m in just 6 months, years ahead of target. Disney's cash registers won't stop kaa-ching all day long, just u watch when this pandemic is over, Dis will bounce back harder and faster than ever before!"
I'm looking to buy stock is there a minimum amount you can buy getting started
Upped my DIS holdings 33% yesterday! Let this baby fly!
this is way to cheap. buy buy before it heads up to $120
Love all the shorts calling this the start of the end! haha. you know as well as all of us that Dis stock is being watched by many who want in.. but can't help but troll to try to scare people into selling. I am sorry you have been hurt in your lives.
"CNBC has made a very big deal of ESPN for years and Disney has been flat during the entire time. Meanwhile Disney's Marvel has been pumping out blockbusters, Disney's Pixar has been pumping out Blockbusters, Disney's Star Wars has been pumping out blockbusters... It doesn't matter what happens with Fox, or ESPN, Disney has a quality set of assets and over time they will figure out all kinds of new ways to monetize those assets $$$$$"
I bought my son 500 shares today and want him to hold this for 10 years
DIS should out perform Netflix at earnings with subscriber growth. Way better programs available
Called it! I knew it was going to drop. ANALysts have hyped this so much all earnings are baked in...We need a major correction to get back to normal...
selling Disney to buy more MSFT best decision ever
"I don't see disney as a great return stock. At its peak in the last five years, it was at $153. Only chance I would buy it if it goes lower than $90 per share"
Today around 180
strong sell now--get out
"DISNEY is a screaming buy. Once Disney+ gets going and all the hard work the past few years to build it is done we just let the subscriber count beat all expectations every quarter. Then Iger will make one more large acquisition -possibly EA. Then look out! This is a $1,000 per share stock in 5 years."
Thoughts/estimations on earnings?
"Lol. So close to closing at 115... Until that crazy after hours drop. Im really excited to see what happens next week.I was originally thinking Dis would break over 117 and settle around 115 when all the dust settles...What ever happens, good luck everyone. Next week is going to be exciting! "
Cool! Dis broke 120 today. Grats to those making money. Good luck to those who tried shorting this week. 
"Nibble, nibble, nibble"
after hours ATH??!!
Numbers should be astonishing
"BMO raised its price target on Disney to $170 from $140(All credits to CNBC)BMO said it is bullish on Disney's new Star Wars-themed lands coming soon as well as Disney+.""We continue to expect Disney to join Netflix and Amazon (also both OP rated) among the leaders in global streaming. DIS shares may need to consolidate near-term, but potential catalysts include two Star Wars-themed lands opening in Anaheim (May 31) and Orlando (August 29), and the launch of Disney+ on Nov 12. For Wednesday's print, investors should be prepared for ESPN sub declines to worsen as vMVPDs rationalize, but we think ESPN+ is a vital new offset, and we offer a deep dive on both it and Disney+ within.""Credits to CNBC"
"This is nothing more than Twitter but now being played from the left side this time. Stock goes down because of a tweet, a week later people eventually get wrapped in some new story because they are too dumb to remember something that happened a week ago, people lose integrity and the willingness to fight stock goes right back up. Same stupid people trying to sound important who think they mean something to the world in the end money always wins not people and their feelings. We will be fine"
Disney will be the best performing DOW stock in 2019 - Mark this post.
Go figure. Only Thing pumping right now is GME.
Disney have blow out motion pictures 3 billion end games streamline tv next Earnings 200
Now that DIS is out bid big time will the bidding war continue or will Dis fold on this deal?
Had to start reporting Trading... too much nonsense about GE
lets go $180 would be nice... keep up the good work Go Mickey Go!
word on the street is r murdoch wants disney stock
just like American Airlines the country is not going to stay closed forever the parks will be open in addition to the pole forward of the sit at home coronavirus event we have going on
Wow Disney is strong!!!
"Aladdin is leading the way for a great quarter. less than a week ago, the general consensus was that it was going to do $75 million this four day weekend. It seems healthy over $110 million, maybe $115. That is a 50% beat. It went from a movie that might break $150 million, and lose money, to a nicely profitable one that might break $300 million. If there is any downside, it is ""only"" at the top end of foreign box office predictions at about $120 million, with only Japan being the remaining market for it to open at. This will make it difficult to break $1 billion. In fact, it may ""only"" do about $750 million.Avengers is ""winding up"". It has about $2.683 billion, just under $100 below Avatar. It does have about $60 billion left from the domestic (it is running, at this time, comparable with Infinity War, so that is what it had left at this time). Can it squeeze another $40 million out of International? - it's going to be tough because China has ended its run. But it is possible that, since it is the last of a great run, it could glean a little more here and there. And it is possible that all of the overseas numbers have not yet come in (I'm not sure that Saudi Arabia's numbers are included at this point). And Disney may have a re-release to drum up some last little business.But Aladdin is the nice nice news. It breaks a Memorial Day losing streak. And it will really means that this quarter is a winner. And this means something because Disney needs a new catalyst to move to the next level. Yes, it has the openings of Star War features at Disneyland and Disneyworld, but that isn't much. And Toy Story 4 will be a hit. And Lion King will be a hit. But there is little else between now and the opening of Disney+. But a profitable Aladdin really means a profitable quarter (with the bookends of Toys Story 4 and Avengers EG) - I think it will make something over $2.50 before charges that Disney noted at its conference call (about 75 cents for dilution and streaming charges). Disney could demonstrate that they are really making real money that will support them as they get streaming in line."
"Congrats longs! And those who avoided selling their shares during the last ""dip"". "
"People need to take app download numbers more realistically.Lets say on avg a family of 4(which is not a stretch given the family friendly demographic of Disney).Now lets say on avg each one has 2.5 devices (TV, phone, tablet, laptop etc).So that 1 paying account, accounts for 10 downloads!So 40million download = 4 million subsNow it gets more interesting, as what % of those subs are from free trials, that churned after the trial. Or canceled after the mandaolarian finished (which was trending on twitter).Let say this is conservatively 20% ( i think it is higher than 20),So now the remaining paying subs:4 million - 20 = 3.2 million.Now what percent of those are getting it free thorough Verizon and will cancel once they actually have to pay.Now you get the picture."
Upgrades coming
Guys word of advice. Own this stock before disney plus subscribers surpass netflix subscribers. That is going to be approximately 9 months from now. When they make the announcement disney plus has surpassed netflix subscribers you are going to want to be holding this stock.
Why is this better than netflix. answer that no so called experts ever talk about . A huge vault of Movies that kids watch over and over. Movies that never get old and they are all paid for. Disney could make a movie a year if they want and still grow. Netflix has to continue to pay a ton for new content. The kids born today in 5 years will be still watching all the old Disney movies Dumbo etc..
"Sell, sell, sell. Get out now. Democrats win the senate in GA. The sky is falling. You’re going pay higher taxes if you don’t sell now."

10 million is just a sliver... Disney owns Hotstar in India which has 300 MILLION monthly users.
Disney could fly up high very soon...they own everyone nowadays and makes banks ....the most profitable company alive right now after Amazon..
"You know Netflix Investors are worried about Disney+, as they should be. I have a feeling we will start to see more Netflix pumpers on this board. This is a good sign for Disney."
Can we break the 150 barrier today? Would love that
Now expect some pullback...
Thank God DIS is up in early market I need to get out of this market and at a loss with this miserable stock.

Is this right during Lockdown in Europe?
I am surprised to see it is still in the red AH. The whole market is going rocket in the last 30 minutes. This stock should have jumped by now...
Does anyone know why the markets keep rising this past week yet Disney appears stuck in a $111 trading range?
I have a feeling it will go back down. I’m waiting before I buy more shares (I bought some around 80). The parks make up for so much revenue I don’t think their streaming/ TV services can make up for it. That said Disney inevitably will go back up. Probably to 200. It’s more so a matter of when
"Even if Disneyland opens this summer, what family of unemployed parents are going to be able to pay $300 per person to enter the park?"
"I'm predicting this will pop after earnings. California is opening up soon and we'll get an update on Disney+ subscribers. It's been trending down the last several days, though last month we were in the 150 range, so, longs are looking pretty good."
Top 2 Holders of $AMC and venerable $DIS :BlackRock and Vanguard. Both betting in parks opening and On-person Movies.
"destined for 80 dollars, good company, terrible time"
"Disney will be over 150 in 2019 and will go a lot higher once their streaming service is out. I plan on canceling my Netflix and adding Disney streaming service. If Netflix stock is over 300 now, I expect Disney stock to more than double once their streaming service launches."
they mention going to 180 in the Trading Nation video. and reiterate it is not overvalued at 137
Always buy the panic on a blue chip stock.
After the bell Dis will be over 110$ hold on to it tight!
can it hold $100 or is $90 the next stop?

"There are a lot of bulls here because of the recent rally and over-optimism. There are rallies in every bear market, including 2008. If you are considering of buying some DIS shares, please read and understand the risks. Don't just listen to the people who own here and are trying to pump this stock up further.Unemployment is rocketing. Jobs will be lost and it will take years for them to return. Think about the big picture here. Oil companies are going under this year at a record pace and layoffs are in every sector. It's not going to be a simple, smooth, and fast transition. We are in the beginning stages of a recession and it will take over a year to enter another bull run. Disney in particular is hit hard because of the closures and Bob Iger of DIS has stated that parks will not open the same when the quarantine ends. There will be limited capacity to social distancing and other precautions which will eat at profit margins. Combined with severe job losses, there will reduced earnings for at least a year. Not saying this is a bad company to buy, but right now it is overvalued. Every pandemic of this scale has resulted in a recession that saw a bear market lasting for over a year. We are 2 months into this. Be patient. Disney+ doesn't add enough value to bring this stock to $125. It will hit $85 before it reaches $125."
This stock action is really shocking.
I don’t see how this stock won’t skyrocket. Disney plus streaming will be the new king . Disney is smashing box office records with their movies . Disney parks are overflowing and merchandise flying out the stores
Way undervalued
DIS beats earning..why there is no breakout? just because of the US-China trade war?
"Went out to dinner in state that's been open for few weeks already. National chain with plenty of tables. 10 minutes for party of 5. Total tables filled in restaurant?....about 10 total. Only 3 filled when we departed. No way leisure stocks going to make money anytime soon. That restaurant last night was losing money being open. Long long long road to recovery here folks, let alone to earnings and then to some semblance of growth. Go out and see for yourself."
"With down Dow day, DIS held up at highs all day! Tomorrow we break 118.00"
Disney parks not opening for a while. Especially if new strains are not covered in vaccine and they keep opening and then closing again. Loosing the free Verizon accounts that do not renew currently. Don't see anything happening fast but maybe in a couple years after pandemic and all cylinders can be firing. Not so sure this upcoming earnings call is only going to meet or lower than expectationshttps://insidethemagic.net/2021/01/disney-parks-reopening-kc1/
"Quote me This will surpass Netflix within one year,"
"Awesome, this was the secondary pop that I was looking for a couple days ago from an opening sub # announcement"
I sold 2500 stocks yesterday at 104.2 . GLAD I SOULED !! picked up a nice 5k profit vs. keeping it till today...
Get ready to break $200 after the next earnings report
Marry me Disney 
Prediction on price next week?
Frozen 2 = Sold out everywhere. I smell a record opening weekend. Scalpers might even get involved based on the demand. :) An update on Monday for Disney+ subscribers + Frozen 2 blowout = another big gap up.
way too cool to keep the hype and excitement up up up! https://www.space.com/mandalorian-rise-of-skywalker-date-changes.html
anyone at Galaxy's Edge Disneyworld today? I can see on Disneyworld app that wait is 150 minutes for Smuggler Run. How is line for Oga's Cantina?
"HBO Max blows away Disney and Netflix...Eventually, you old people will see that. My opinion but of course."
"Disney has given most of us our youthful memories, Aladdin, Lion King, Theme parks etc. I believe it was good, it was wholesome. Is this a business? sure. but the reason Disney even exists is because of how we feel towards its product. It doesn’t make food or microchips. It makes humans feel something. Disney is us and i think of it as a positive part of all of us. So do i want my children to have this in there life? Yes! This business means more then money to all of us. So forecasting and posting on here is trivial. Lets get together in support of a national treasure during a bad time for it and rally. Disney plus has better content then Netflix especially for kids. I have them both. Its just a matter of time until Disney plus has more subscribers. And netflix is over 400/share. Subscribe!! Lets get them over 100mill."
"Already in the stock, investors on the street are the last ones to know on earnings day. But at least this will keep it from pulling a Qualcomm"
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/21st-century-fox-board-announces-120500224.htmlNEW YORK , June 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc. (""21CF"") (NASDAQ: FOXA, FOX) announced today that it has entered into an amended and restated merger agreement with The ..."
Im going to sell half my position. Because when you see solid profit. Take it. Im torn between what will happen tomorrow and what im given right now I think doing both will be best
"I was not sure what is number of Verizon wireless subscriber. See below.Image result for verizon wireless subscribers 2018:In the first quarter of 2018, Verizon Wireless led the list with 151.48 million subscribers, followed by AT&T that recorded more than 143.83 million subscribers that same quarter."
"NFL needs top dollar over its Disney affiliation which is damaging the NfLs bottom line with its far lefty propaganda BS,that dividend is never coming back when the deal gets settled it?s going to be insanely high,NFL is losing viewers and revenue with all the political #$%$nobody with a brain wants medical or political advice from a jock"
"Just my thoughts. Apple is purchasing Disney stock on the open market. Iger is on the Apple board. The stock is an investment for Apple. The stock rises and therefore the price DIS will pay for Fox goes down. The Mouse eats the fox, the stock rises, making Apple $ and they stay connected to the Disney content and streaming possibilities in the future with DIS as a friend not a foe. aplle has to invest there cash somewhere. DIS stock has a lot of up if streaming takes off. They want to stay close to this."
"Can someone explain as to why P/E ratios between Netflix and Disney are so far apart? If Disney is a serious competitor to Netflix and the revenue and profit growth rate of Disney from the streaming service is forecasted to be similar or better than Netflix, why would not Disney warrant higher multiple P/E?"
All I can say is that when all of this is over everyone will be going Disney in record numbers. And they will be raising ticket price to make up for the loss. So get ready for a great comeback.
Buy Buy Buy Buy !!!!!!!
Any less than $375 is undervalued today.
Market hasn't been this bearish since the big drops February.Took about 3 weeks before things got back to normal. Wonder if the same thing will happen this time.
"Until Chapek gets the guts to fire Kathleen Kennedy from Lucasfilm, I cannot even think about investing in this company."
Looks like it is moving higher and higher into close... maybe it is slowly leaking of great numbers like last quarter. Buy and be rewarded!
market is sky rocketing and disney is only up pennies.
Disney’s delivering great entertainment the way Apple delivers great Tech products. Only a matter of time my friends !
"Had to at least give D+ a try since I own stock in it. Mandalorian was pretty good and I was able to check out some Disney movies I remembered from the 1970s. It has a very impressive catalog beyond what appears on the main screen. The interface and resolution are quite good and system does remember where you were at in a given show/movie. However, they do need to have a section that shows what you have already viewed, rather than having to go back and search it up again, like Netflix does. But I am sure that will come. Clearly the D+ service itself is G and PG stuff so I assume if you want more adult content you will need to do a Hulu add-on with it. However, for households with children this will be a necessity. Having every Disney channel show and Disney movie at the ready for the little ones will be a no brainer (little kids can watch Pixar stuff on a loop practically). Add in the cheap cost and there will be no reason not to have it. Meanwhile Disney seems to be advertising for D+ everywhere. I am hanging on for the ride."
"last year, same time, DIS could be had below $100. Cheers to longs and new investors!"
big sell off set up now
"Today, I went long. And I feel really good about it. 2 Days ago I bought the 3 year Disney+ subscription. And I felt really good about that too."
i feel like i should take my kids to Disneyland with all the profits i made. As a thank you lol.
If frozen 2 is as good as the first one that alone will generate insane revenue
"Hey Dis Fam.It's been a while since I've posted on this board. Been focusing on school and work. Hope everyone is doing well and staying safe.Im bummed to see Dis so heavily impacted by the covid-19 situation, as many companies have been.Im not pulling the trigger and jumping in yet... Ima wait a bit longer and see if Dis makes a quick recovery, or if the lingering affects help reach new lowes in the coming months. Good luck to you all. keep your heads up and your eyes on the prize.Grats to those still making money, and better fortune to those losing right now. Much love to you all."
"Well, with DIS earnings tomorrow, just hoping for a better Dow day and a train heading North. GLTA."
Im amazed that stocks go up or down when a upgrade/downgrade is announced. What gives that rating so much influence and power?
when is the next ex div and how much please?
"Economy is opening post covid19 but Disney stock is not moving higher further, on the other hand online stocks are not deterred even decline in cov19d and store opening. Why?"
Strong Buy!
I asked my daughter. What is better Netflix or Dis+ she said Dis+. She noted Netflix is running out of ideas lol got to love the advice of a 10 year old
What’s yours guys price target after earnings?
Disneyland sold out of tickets...$75 just to walk around disneyland...no rides open. Streaming industry will continue to grow and Disney expected to dominate. $500 stock by years end.
"Everyone whining and complaining about DIS stock price.....sell all your shares and be done! The impatience and lack of understanding of what is going on because market is up big and DIS stock is down. There are so many positive catalyst that will take time to manifest into meaningful profit, but I can’t think of a more reasonably priced and favorable long term growth story than DIS."
"Well, ROKU and NFLX are having a good day. Expecting to see DIS back to $150, the party can't be that short lived."
next quarter subscribers clearing 50’million in the IS before Mando season 2 and Marvel unleashes it series. $200!! let’s go!!!
"look on the bright side, there is hope that in a year or two Netflix might buy disney. But dont expect a premium."
"DIS needs to announce earnings with the large cap tech like NFlX, FB, APPL, MSFT, etc., to benefit from earnings momentum."
99.5% of shorts underwater and gasping for a dip to cover.
cancel disney
Great News
$160 tomorrow
113 next week
"That 1 month gap is filled, back to bull trend"
Can’t wait for Disney theme parks to open
"DIS A break-up at the top trend line at $116.24 will firstly indicate a stronger raising rate. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 12.15% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $121.52 and $130.36 at the end of this period."
Pe is 140. Needs to pull back a little.
135+ today
Lol wow this is impressive. Record number of tards buying this up.
Wait for there numbers As the park is going to be closed at least a month
I would buy dis before it breaks the resistance at 140 right now
"Hey D. Hows it going? I saw that CVS is having a huge sale on Vaseline. DId you pick up any because it appears that you need it. Lemme know, brah!"
going to break 200 after hours!!!!!
"Disney said at its investor day that it now expects between 230 million-260 million global subscribers by the end of fiscal 2024, up significantly from the 60 million-90 million target the company posted in 2019. Disney+ is expected to become a profitable business segment by fiscal 2024 as well. And the company will also be increasing the price of Disney+ by $1 to $7.99 for U.S. users starting in March."
"SHORTS, an advice for you ... cover now or cover at a much higher price tomorrow. The choice is yours."
Wow last i checked was $138! What happened?
My friend that works in Hollywood got me in to see The Mandalorian in a movie theater. After seeing The Mandalorian on a three story screen I think I’ll take my 100 inch 4K television and put it out in the trash.I had forgotten how much better a movie is in a real movie theater.
"Yay for great earnings , we are being rewarded with a red day."
Apple+ and Disney+ are going to take business from Netflix. Parents can't find much on Netflix that is kid-friendly.
just cancelled Netflix and signed up for Disney+ its terrfic love the menu and all the content it will take me years to watch everything
Parks closed indefinitely. Glad I didn't jump in.
The streaming busniess is not subject to the costs thatcneflix business is having to build product bon dylan just sold the profits for disney are far higher per user than netflix so the share price jusy for the streaming is 500 and that cluod easily be double they own pixar colme on 
Fasten seatbelts were going up today
Big order buys after hours. Someone bought half a million worth of shares. I am buying more in the morning.
House of Mouse may well feel the hurricane. I think the stock will plunge today.
"Buying opportunity?This really seems like a buying opportunity. After hitting 145+, it is in the 120's. Why is it down when it announced such an aggressive slate of productions? Competition - people are concerned that Apple's price will draw people - but Apple has been searching for a winning slate with its Apple TV for a while, and its price is good for its streaming, but its slate of products is very very limited. Disney is in transition. It could have stayed pat, producing content that the streaming venues would have tripped over each other to bid for, but it decided to go on its own - which is a worthy shot given its present content - Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar - and even more so because it can unleash its library's value. Disney had a similar choice in the 1950's - should it just keep on selling content, or start a tv channel. It choose the former, and lost the opportunity for about 40 years (and then paid a lot for ABC). It's not doing that again.This is a big job. A job carved out for Iger. And one more point - Disney doesn't see it just competing against Netflix, ATT/HBO, Amazon, Apple, CBS, NBC/Universal. Disney+ is looking towards a certain segment (people under 25), which includes Grandparents who want to entertain their grandchildren. Parents will want to watch Star Wars with their young children who want to re-experience the thrill. Hulu certainly is a competitor with the others mentioned, but it may get a boost from the packaging that only Disney can provide. Buckle up - its going to be a rocky ride."
"The launch of Disney+ in various countries during this pandemic is sort of a benefit to Disney. More subscriptions as a result. (Do not intend to downplay the bad effect this virus had though). In essence, Disney+ on it's own could be the equivalent in size to Netflix. So, Disney has the added benefit of its parks, movies, cruises, etc. as they all come back on line as compared to Netflix. Disney price should move higher looking forward."
"NO Gina , no DIS- sold will never rebuy and will cancel DIS +. GLT"
Earnings will be ALL ABOUT how ESPN+ is doing. When we begin to show streaming traction is when the multiple begins to increase a la Netflix!
"Disney should just let Comcast have Fox and then go under with all that debt. I think they already have enough quality assets to launch that much awaited streaming platform in 2019.BTW, I think if the stock fails to break above that 110 level, it's likely going to go much lower from there, based on technicals."
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/01/hulu-gained-twice-as-many-subscribers-as-netflix-in-us.html
"Other Companies Disney+ threatens, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Facebook!"
Everyone loves it already so wondering why it should outperform
Disney is doing massive improvements that they were never able to do while the park was open. Like projects that you guys couldn't even imagine that I've been put off for years.. So they wouldn't ruin the magic of the park for people. Disney is going to flourish.
Don’t flinch...I still say 105 after earnings...
"I'd like to add a little positivity to today - If you look at the charts from 2015 on, the lows are getting higher while the highs are staying consistent. So if you are a long term investor, then this coil pattern that's been happening for 3 years shouldn't scare you too much. It's trend is still upward with promising futures. The gap is closing, and I think the formation will eventually be a straight line up. :)"
DIS has taught me a valuable lesson in Stock trading ..... patients !!! Look at every investment as a long term investment and don’t expect to make a quick fortune
Disney will buy Netflix in the next 7 years . And the Mickey will be king
DIS plus is getting massive cancellations since Lucas fired Gina. Going concern for DIS being political !
Bag holders
150.00 Heavy volume 46 Million shares today
110 maybe 108 tomorrow. good luck.
"Too many people expecting Disney to jump 7-15 a day lol  this is going to slow grind higher as news breaks until it breaks $147 once it breaks that then you will see those big run ups in the stock. You can bet the phones are ringing off the hook to partner with Disney, you can also bet there are some board meetings going on about how to compete or buy Disney lol What Disney has is a vault of feel good movies for over 50 years. The price is not objectionable and the numbers will start to be revealed. Patience it took Disney years to acquire and assemble this content. Meanwhile tell your parents and friends to get some stock and sign up for Disney"
Should I buy before or after earnings this week? im looking to start a position and hold long.
Record box office weekend of 1.2 billion dollars for one film and the stock price goes down.......time to buy more.
The impact will be felt in full next quarter not this quarter
"Disney is a very unique stock, it's literally the only one that has treaded in everyones childhood. It's Americana. The market is 'partial' to it's success. And if you throw in actual solid numbers, investments, results, you have holy fire friend."
DIS is a long bet
"dis is now old disney + netflix , only this netflix has massive brand recognition behind it. Easy double in the next 3-5 years but probably much sooner than that."
The party is just starting boys!! Exciting times.
"I refuse to believe that i lost a small fortune, therefore, tomorrow is the day, ESPN drafting, Avengers financials, and the rewards of consolidation will all hit at once, causing Disney to skyrocket 7-10% in one day. We will all be rich. (Probably not though, I am just speculating/praying)"
"4 painted walls dry faster than waiting for DIS to make a decent move up. i got excited seeing $139 today thinking if was DIS, but NO, it was my ROKU."
"Ticket prices at Disney theme parks are ridiculously overpriced. It amazes me that people pay these prices just to stand in a line for 2 hours per ride. But instead of complaining about the prices, I decided to get on the other side of the equation. Bought the stock in 2016, and recently sold for about a $7000 gain plus dividends. That more than paid for the tickets and extras. Waited for a cold day during January when Park has historically had lower attendance, pulled kids out of school, and I don’t think we waited for more than 5 min on any ride. In fact, at the end of Splash Mountain, the ride operator gave us the option of staying in the boat and riding again since there was no line. He told me on a normal weekend, guests would wait 2 1/2 hours for this one ride. Geez. We had fun but don’t think we’ll ever go back to a Disney Park. So many better options out here. My kids and I hiked the John Muir Trail this summer for several weeks and it was so much better than the artificial entertainment that Disney offers up. But to each his own."
"Elevator reached the bottom floor and is heading up now. If you missed it, you'll have to take the stairs."
Buy buy before it’s too late
"So let me understand this, Only about half the parks are operational and 15-20% normal capacity, no conventions so the hotles are maybe at 25% capacity, no Disney Cruises. The parks will not see 60% for at least 9 months to 1 year. NBA just started 9 days ago and MLB might be done in two weeks. TV reruns galore on ABC. My kids have pretty much not watch a movie on Disney Plus in 2 weeks. No dividend and the stock is only down 15% in this cash burn environment. Either this stock drops 10-15 after the bell or this is a bigger rigged game then the Fed funding the market!"
"ex date less than a month away, hopefully we get a steady climb leading up to it and earnings in july"

Time to sell?
What is going to happen to this stock after the weekend and Avengers Endgame is a sellout everywhere???
"So now that Comcast won the Sky bid, what are people's thoughts on how this will effect the DIS stock? Will investors be happy that Disney isn't racking up more debt? Or will investors be disappointed that Disney missed the opportunity to have more European coverage?"
told you it would be down today-- garbage earnings report
"I saw ""The Rise of Skywalker"" last night! ...It was Great! Get ready to join the whole audience in crying, laughing and cheering! as the film makers found a way to bring the past, present and future for old and new Star Wars fans onto an excellent movie complete with a few surprises and twists directed by mastermind J.J. Abrams. There is a reason audience goers have already given it a 90% approval rating - it deserves it!"
"Lol earnings call is playing ""it's alright"" song"
Will it go up today?
Remember that these companies made it so we had to pay $130 a month to watch decent shows. If everyone supports them in streaming they will jack back up their prices.
"Money coming out of the COVID names and other high multiple growth stocks and going into reopening plays like DIS, MA, V, etc. I am hoping once things go back to normal that the reopening plays stay up."
so the billionaires that lost in game stop are shorting the SPY fututres and now thats how they make their money back in a blip
"Would love to get in long closer to 165. With parks/theaters closed, revenue stream is now fully reliant on streaming. Waiting for the dip when earnings reveals this"
"cost average your way in using pull backs, leave your emotion at the door, you're investing for the future, dividend reinvestment Disney is a core"
Is it smart to sell now and buy back after earnings (probable) drop in SP??
$150+easily by friday! $160 next week. then it will take a break before next run to $170!!
"Is it just me, or is the market very confused this morning? And I'm not talking about the usual big moves in the morning. Stocks that should be red are very green and vice versa. Weird morning. Meanwhile DIS is only slightly red, so nothing to sweat. Especially for longs."
"I just don't know why people want to buy this yet. 37% of their revenue is from theme parks. Cruises , movies and hotels make up another 25-30%. This virus even if we get a vaccine by October would still take forever to get 335 million Americans vaccinated. Throw onto that Disney plus is rolling out but they still need to drop millions more into it. Last quarter they sunk in 600 million for infrastructure so it won't be even come close to make up for the lost revenue and high profit margins. Lastly you have ESPN, but all sports have been cancelled so what are people going to watch ? Lastly if their debt gets downgraded here they could be in a world of hurt. It's best just to stay on the sidelines until the picture is clear"
"DIS to $153 Monday 11/25/19 Looking at previous box office break of Marvels ""Avengers End Game"" DIS went up $7.25 in 2 days back in April. Once Frozen 2 breaks the 100m opening weekend, + good news on merchandise ..."
Amazon Fire TV will carry DIS+ as I think many of us expected to happen eventually
111/113 works for me M-E
"Sticking to my $153 call for today. Open market is always volatile. The /es looks great. Huge weekend with Frozen 2, merchandise for the holidays is a super +, and frozen 2 going toward Disney+ is another added no brainer."
"Disney D23: The list of what to expect out of Disney's (DIS) D23 is long and intriguing. Studios will be front and center as Disney, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel all have an extensive film slate that could be previewed. Upcoming content plays from Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu are also likely to be discussed in detail for the first time. The next trailer for Star Wars: Episode 9 could be a showstopper and some theme park news on the integration of Marvel attractions is also a possibility. Shares of Disney are up 23% YTD into the event scheduled to begin in Anaheim on August 23."
i heard the lightsaber building experience is awesome. wish i could make my own xD
I have 100 k ready in my Ameritrade acct. ready for deployment. Now that the US parks have closed for the time being any thoughts on entry points and entry times. Thought out responses are appreciated
Hold your earnings for 5 more days. That's when Apple and Disney launch. More money
https://heroichollywood.com/disney-executive-fox-deal-almost-done/
If this movie pull close to 1 Billion including international over the weekend I can see 143 145 Monday
Remember the Russian collusion hoax these guys ran on their viewers for 2 years? And not even an apology? In fact they tried to move right into a cover-up story as if you can cover up something that never happened? These are bad people and this is a sociopathic company.
no one knows why this is down today. people are just selling because they figure they should follow everyone else
"I am definitely a customer of Disney Plus for the first few weeks. You know when I watch all my favorite shows from a kid, and then once I watch all of them and get bored of it, I am going to cancel my membership with Disney Plus because Netflix on the other hand is continuing to create new content and will always have my interest."
"The whole media group is down today, just added more shares of Disney.... again today. Good luck & great investing!"
No aftermarket gains ??? What's wrong with DIS. Earnings were ok. Subscriber numbers are on par ... What else it need ?? Do I need to get out of this ??
The ONLY benefit of being in the Dow 30 is every single day the market opens up so does Disney  so it takes a lot more selling just to get the stock to move lower... this won’t end well for those who sold puts or short  wait until next week when the buyers start buying before earnings
"Prediction: Iger will focus on Disney+, drawing conversations away from losing segments (majority of company) to less profitable winning segments. Short term good for stock, long term ouch. I want more Disney but I tend to not buy more of a company that's bleeding cash. Just my long term strategy I stick to."
"I agree with Austin, the difference between getting in at $140 to $135 is trivial compared with where the price is going to go. Never mind the dividends and increases that are sure to come."
Great move for ESPN to partner with UFC. The first fight card thus past weekend brought in almost 600k new subscribers to ESPN+. That platform will have huge growth this year.
I think it’s fair to say Disney has made a lot of enemies by launching Disney plus  I’ll evaluate after Wednesday numbers but I think something is trying to hold the stock back  my options don’t expire until April so this is just delaying the inevitable 
DIS holding up very well - market snaps back we move back over $115
"I knew yesterday was too good to be true. Thanks for never failing to crush my hopes, Disney"
Anything under $250 is undervalued.
"Will rocket to a 'fresh' ALL TIME HIGH tomorrow without its theme parks, theater releases, and cruise ships.Who would have thought......"
Let's see this rockin again on Monday. Futures are green. Good news about the the France launch. Huge subscription reports for Disney+ almost daily by various sources.
To the guy who says “would you watch (blank) a thousand times” the answer is.... my kids will!
My predictions were 140 at close and 142 Monday Tuesday 143/145
Spiros Segalas from Jennsion Associates $181 BILLION dollar mutual fund discloses 3.2 MILLION shares of Disney. Not to late to join the run to $150
Mickey mouse clubhouse with good AH movement so far
"I expect CMCSA to counter DIS revised bid today...and totally for personal reasons/ego. It is very clear that DIS/FOX want to be together and there are many other factors that are in DIS favor. That being said, I don’t see any reason for CMCSA to wait to counter. Am I missing something? It was mentioned today the DIS expects to get DOJ approval in the next two weeks. You know both DIS and CMCSA have run multiple “what if” scenarios and therefore should be able to look at playbook and make the next move."
$147 to $150 Monday
what do we think Disney will do with Alien and Predator franchises? Thoughts?
I muted NFX ages ago but i wouldn’t be hearing him with all these GAINS
"One serious question about Disney+ streaming service. To compete with netflix, will Disney release new movies immediately on Disney+? If it does, it will gain more subscribers. But Disney will lose revenue from movie theatre. So there will be gain and loose. Which do u think is bigger?"
Just think what Disney+ growth will look like! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hulu-achieves-rapid-growth-hits-130415667.html
One red day for the first time in forever and the bears are like
"As announced a month ago Fox and Comcast will enter in to a three round auction Friday/Saturday for Sky. If Fox is able to purchase the remaining 60% expect a temporary dip in Disney as an acquirer tends to dip, but is a great buy long term. If Comcast wins expect a temporary spike as Fox will benefit from their 40% ownership but long term it would be a negative for Disney."
"Markets are red and Disney is green premarket. Yesterday was the push we needed. Hopefully, no bad news from the market and phase 1 deal will be reached. Disney 150+ will then come."
Disney's scale advantage has kept them on top for nearly a century. Netflix is on track to surpass them within 5 years.
disney getting cancelled
Luring in more retail bag holders. Buy the top
"DIS needs to rethink its executive structure and board member relationship. They continue to operate under the founding principles that worked very well then but this is a new world and DIS is underperforming because of a lack of vision, leadership and management. DIS could be so much more but they have the wrong team leading the company."
Tons of parents at theater with their kids some even dressed as Elsa from Frozen 2.....easy 100 million weekend
Dont be late to the DIS train!
Watch for a big profit taking and bigger rebound. It’s just heating up.
I miss the days great quarters resulted in great gains... what is going on????
"Lets face it, if Disney was down for a reason would not be good. But with market up or flat and Disney down 3 days it is ONLY a buy-in opportunity. I am now fully loaded with call options."
"You just can’t make these things up!“Frozen 2” earned $41.8 million domestically on Friday while adding another $57.8 million internationally for a nearly $100 million global single-day total.Disney’s “Frozen 2” is teed up to roast the pre-Thanksgiving weekend box office in its debut with an estimated $124 million from 4,440 North Americans locations.https://www.google.com/amp/s/variety.com/2019/film/box-office/box-office-frozen-2-debut-a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-21-bridges-1203414252/amp/"
"YEAH!!!!!For now, we’re just hearing hearsay about the Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu+ bundle. But for sure that when market hears that this had been made OFFICIAL through statement by Bob Iger, WE’LL BE DANCING LIKE THIS!! (Sorry PUTS, it will be too long for this stock to be taken down after decades of being asleep)"
Jim cramer gives Disney a target price 200$+ after earnings this weekend
"Disney beat the expectations, why is it down?"
Diving 
my guess from below on Monday wins! woohoo! :)
"the game of expectations....The parks, experiences and consumer products business segment posted an operating loss of $119 million in the first quarter, though this was much better than the loss of more than $530 million expected"
Do u guys think it will go to $220 tomorrow?
"This is a long. Disney has parks, movies, tv, merchandise and now streaming with significant content. Multiple income streams and stability. Don't get caught up in the moment. Hold on and sell out or give to your kids in 20 years."
Why isn't DIS tapping the video game industry? Almost all of their audience (kids mainly) spend all day playing some sort of games and disney isn't making any of them. Any thoughts?
"Bohemian Rhapsody, dead pool, Glass. This is Disney content"
baby yoda merchandise goes on sale today
"Feels like February all over again. Seemed like certain words were floating around predicting doom back then too. Couple months later stocks were higher... Now they are lower.Relax. Have faith in your investments. If you are uncertain and nervous, find out why. Learn and improve.Good luck everyone. "
"Mark Cuban just said something that I never thought of but will probably happen and will blow the lid off of the value of DIS: sports will first come back to zero live fans contests, i.e. broadcast and streaming will be the only way to watch. This should drive ESPN+, ABC, and other Disney sports ‘broadcast’ properties to significantly higher viewership!Do not underestimate the Mouse House!"
"Disney plus and the rich content will provide unprecedented levels of earnings in the years ahead, as the whole market shifts towards a new mode"
Disney getting crushed with the US parks still open? Can't imagine how low will this go if U.S. parks close. Just a matter of time.
All the short sellers yesterday saying it’s going to 80  a stock can go down some days but in the long term Disney owns sooooo many companies. It is the Amazon of its industry
"The company now expects to have 230 million-260 million Disney+ subscribers by 2024, up from its prior estimate of 60 million-90 million for the same time frame, with global subscriptions across all services reaching 300 million-350 million. Netflix (NFLX), by comparison, has 195.15 million subscribers.See you at 300 soon enough ."
"Not too many times do you hear a CEO tell the truth. I hope this revolves soon. Disney press release: ""We have closed our theme parks; suspended our cruises and theatrical shows; delayed theatrical distribution of films both domestically and internationally; and experienced supply chain disruption and ad sales impacts."" ""In addition there has been a disruption in creation and availability of content we rely on for our various distribution paths, including most significantly the cancellation of certain sports events and the shutting down of production of most film and television content."""
Tomorrow will be red! But it might be green! Or it might be completely flat! I'll just pick the right one when that time comes and then say I was right! (How's my impression of OptionFaker?)
Bob Iger has built one of the greatest companies of the 21st century. Hold long and compound!
"If AVENGERS hits billion dollars by Sunday, DIS will hit 150 this week. It seems like a lot of mutual funds pour money into DIS for the last few weeks. I don't care about US market much, I care about all the smart phone users, that is the gold mine that DIS wants. DISNEYLAND is a good insurance policy, If DIS does not hit the target any year, the park will raise the price, so DIS should be the long term stock to hold. Disney streaming business is a game change for DIS. NFLX should be panic right now, it has not much content, no sport, no entertainment. But don't short NFLX now, wait until DIS starts $ 6.99 per month first, then you can start to short NFLX. I believe NFLX, will go lower from now on, because every body wants a piece of NFLX."
"Disney is in a little rut. It seems to be stuck between 110 and 112, give or take a little.In the next 3 weeks, there are only two things that will move Disney. First and upgrade or downgrade. Second earnings, with a good or bad cc. Although positive on earnings, I am willing to get off my high horse slightly - SWTLJ did not do absolute gangbusters - it will approach $1.4 billion, but not more - a small but significant minority did not like it (was not as high minded as some might have preferred, although critics liked it), and there might have been an element of fatigue (and it simply has fallen flat in China). Further, consumer sales may have been off on it, at least as compared to a couple of years ago. Although I am confident that JJ Abrams will put it back on track with his last installment of the trilogy, we will see if the Hans Solo installment this May is well received. As to earnings, I had been touting $2.00 a share. Although the leveling off of SWTLJ may affect the 2d quarter more than the past first, I still will take off an give it only $1.90 per share."
"What if you made an extra 4 billion for 3 years. What would you do with all that cash? That's Dinsey's 12 billion dollar problem. They were not expect to hit their number for at least 5 years publicly, but internally they were expected to do so in 3 years. Now the question is how to spend that money? More content? More dividends? More stock buybacks? No Matter how you slice it, great for share holders. Happy Holidays and let's see 160 by Jan 1, 2020."
Only 189 days until Disney+ launches! It's practically tomorrow! :)
A lot of negativity from Barron regarding Captain Mavel. They are expecting 1/2 of the revenues from Wonder Woman. Maybe hiring Brie Larson was a mistake.
"Held the $150 mark like a champ today. The overall market has been insane. It seems like futures are green, and a new record is set almost daily."
I don't know anyone that watches or listens to the mainstream media anymore. Bias was bad enough. propaganda is unwatchable.
"Been doing research on new streaming services n this is going to b bigger than anyone thinks. Think of assets owned, Disney, Marvel, Fox., ABC, etc. There is so much great content there, plus ESPN for sports! Then you also have Hulu and deep pockets for development of new content. Disney will very quickly become the new streaming leader and will leverage all their assets to grow this new revenue stream much faster than anybody anticipating. Do your own DD but very excited for additional news coming up on today's CC!!"
Is now a good time to start a position? Been waiting
"Is it practical for Disney to have 2 or three streaming subscription services? How many services are consumers realistically going to pay out for each month- I suspect many only want one and that's Netflix -- maybe that's wrong but with Netflix, Amazon Prime already established, is Disney seriously going to displace them? It could be very expensive for Disney to compete here."
"Get ready for a strong close. The DOW is green, and we are down for no reason. Analyst gave a bullish report today, launch tomorrow, consider this a buying opportunity."
"sold at $97.5, too afraid"
Anyone elase can see a 10 points pop up this week or it is just me 
"Finally looked where the bands settled from yesterday. 143.29 top band which is curving down and just touching top keltner, as that continues down it'll push the price down. The good news for you longs is...141.75 is the bottom band unless of course heavy shorting/selling occurs."
"Whatever is driving up the price, it isn't Star Wars."
A classic bubble here come on ppt moved money into de dis etc overt as f
"So...now that we know HULU will be 100% Disney owned, how long before Disney announces package deals, maybe enjoying HULU, Disney+, and ESPN+ for $19.99 or less? Or a mix and match allowing a choice of two for $14.99 or less?This was discussed at the investor's meeting, I believe, and could be huge. This, I think, is what Netflix should truly fear."
"DIS has a PE 14, NFLX PE 129, DIS is value priced and is growing fast. NFLX is way over priced. In a down turn NFLX will drop like a rock, DIS is much more resistant to a downturn. Which one should a smart investor buy? Thumbs up for DIS, thumbs down for NFLX. You be the judge!"
"Been right so far said $120 by this week. I feel $200 by end of year, possibly more as I get the feeling Disney will be trading like a high growth tech stock(trading much higher than current valuation) due to the obvious growth Disney plus will have."
I can't wait till Dementia Joe and Heels Up Harris raise your taxes and caves in to China.
"Analyst Actions: Imperial Capital Lifts Walt Disney's Price Target to $144 From $143, Maintains In-Line RatingBY MT Newswires— 8:50 AM ET 02/06/202008:50 AM EST, 02/06/2020 (MT Newswires) -- The Walt Disney Co. ( DIS) has an average analyst rating of buy, with an average price target of $161."
NEVER DOUBT THE MOUSE
Everyone will be buying Disney today
In this market a strong earning report can only mean one thing - joking
Don't you think the $96 price has priced in park closures?
"Just read an article saying that Disney (or Amazon) could end up buy Snap. That's an interesting thought for Disney. They haven't really dabbled in the world of social media much, outside of having a Disney account in all of them. Disney could leverage the intellectual property to enhance their Disney Parks app, which is getting more interactive. Any thoughts on this hypothetical acquisition?"
"The numbers are insane and the weekend isn't even over yet!!!!NEW: ""Avengers: Endgame"" made $350 million in the U.S. and Canada, far surpassing the previous record of $257.7 million set a year ago by Marvel's ""Infinity War.""It also set weekend records in China, Brazil, France, more than three dozen other markets."
As for a reason why COULD it be going down. This stock made about 40% last year. Investors are taking their profits in January and don't have to pay taxes for another whole year. Just wait for earnings and you all will be happy....
$75 price target
Remember November
The volume is low which makes it easy for MM to push stock but eventually the demand will drive us higher.
Wonder if the recent Disney movies will be released exclusively on Disney plus... if so that will be a huge draw
its the happiest place on earth
Disney is the next Netflix plus
Mid day analysis: 50 is STILL in the opposite direction.
Why’s everyone act like Disney is cheap. But for the past 5 years it stayed in the range $95-$115 range. It only recently went up on the streaming service hype without numbers. Now we are back in regular territory.
"Loop Capital Initiated position, price target at $130!!"
"we will see $400 before the end of the year. $300, 30 days after all the parks finally open up. Cabin fever will bring those who never even liked parks before. Everyone just chomping at the bit to get the family outdoors and enjoy some fun and fresh air. GLTA and Go DIS"
Here's a magic thought on DIS sp pattern/volume vs MM's vs ultimate potential for this 1923 company .......just continue to watch this base form on avg/low volume while the sp remains in the mid-high 140's ...but think of it like a sling-shot slowly being pulled back! once next feb earnings/sub numbers come out just then the MM's and the market will let it go = remember our last 10-12 pt move ....so the next one/run could be epic!
They just said ( The peeps on tv ) they could see over 140 as high as 190 on the upcoming breakout! that's sounds like crazy talk but I like that kind of talk :)
Market up 500 pts this week and DISNEY down. Hate to say this but someone knows something about the 2/4 earnings report. There is no way this stock should be down.
Strong fundamentals on this stock. Many angles to play and money to back. Sorry but shorts will lose. We’re going up!
Bad buy at this price? Chance of a slight pullback after hitting $200 recently?
as per chart it should move further down if market turn into green it will go up to 101
exactly 2 weeks away from earnings. Disney has many weapons in its arsenal
Added more on dip I mean...cuz I'm totally green on my first batch of shares...bought up some more today...
Seeing $cat and $de at these levels is disgusting. $dis too. Also other cyclicals like $ph $etn these things are old industrials trading higher then when trump was in let alone prepandemic. This trash should be avoided buying cyclicals at highs like this is extremely dangerous
"A very armature investor says.....""So we got netflix which is so awesome that it is considered one of the FANG stocks."" But a movie streaming service is easily copied by other companies. So Disney comes along and starts up their own streaming service just like Netflix, and then on top of that they still got all those resorts, and movies like Frozen 2, and cruise liners. Lets not forget that it's Christmas and all the kids will want star wars toys, or Marvel toys, or other Disney junk. So if Netflix is at almost 300$ a share then shouldn't Disney be worth like 148 Quadrillion $ a share instead of 148$?"
Why do people pile in on a day it pops on good news. Shouldn't you wait till the market drops to buy it?
FB has caused the lemmings to hold a fire sale but to those paying attention it is based upon no volume (FB excepted).As long as they don't cause a market wide panic tomorrow this will all sort itself out and after the vote on the 27th we will should see a spike due to all the noise dissipating.
Canceled my NFLX this weekend and bought DIS. So much more and way better content. Goodnight NFLX
"One of the strongest entertainment giants the world has ever seen, has only swung upward since before March 2020, and its real estate sector has been on standby until recently..what is there to discuss here? Buy in and enjoy your earnings."
I swear Disney could be like Frozen 2 breaks the trillion dollar mark and Disney plus reaches 500 million subscribers and the stock would be like up .10
I don't have a CFA designation but I did study for CFA. I am not sure how this guy came up with $93 price target. 1) DIS is starting streaming next year. 2) making ton of money with films and parks 3) Solid Balance Sheet. How come this company is valued @$93 vs. $490 for NFLX. We should send these analyst guys to jail.
Wow. Crushes and it’s up 3 bucks....typical
strong buy for disney. avengers end game and star wars land will drive stock price to new 2019 highs
DIS does have $40bn less debt than Comcast.. hmm
welp there goes my Disney calls
There is no way NFLX should be valued more than DIS. This is just an insane stock market.
"Disney streaming service could amass 160 million subscribers, J.P. Morgan saysBY MARKETWATCH — 3 MINUTES AGOJ.P. Morgan analyst Alexia Quadrani penned an upbeat note on Walt Disney Co.'s (DIS) prospects in streaming on Wednesday, writing that she estimates the forthcoming Disney+ service will ultimately be able to attract 45 million subscribers domestically and 160 million subscribers in total. ""According to the U.S. government census, there are 34.5 million family households in the U.S. with children under 18, and we believe 75% of these households will eventually sign up for Disney+ due to the service's popular appeal, exclusive content, and brand recognition,"" she wrote. In addition, Quadrani expects that 30% of U.S. families without children will sign up for the service due to the presence of Marvel and Star Wars content. Internationally, Quadrani predicts that 115 million subscribers will ultimately sign up, though she warns that the growth trajectory will depend on when Disney (DIS) gets some of its content rights reverted back. She wrote that Disney's (DIS) ESPN+ streaming service has ""surpassed expectations"" with 2 million subscribers as of an announcement in early February. ""We view streaming services as a positive addition to Disney's (DIS) ecosystem,"" Quadrani said. Disney (DIS) shares are down 0.3% over the past three months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 3.4%."
"will load up on some more PUTs come monday, closures will remain longer than expected.."
Apple and Disney launch streaming Tuesday. Showing uptrend for the next 3 months. Beat earnings too

Yahoo!!!!! Time to buy some more! Long live LONGS!!!!
Based on cash flow its literally never been as overvalued as today
Mickey mouse to the moon!
I think Disney is still cheap.
I really wish they would bring back dividends.
Best run company in the world with a ridiculously low PE for a media tech giant. We just got a discount on shares this morning.
Disney should make Baby Yoda doll available exclusively to 1 year Disney + subscribers .
Who is pumping this stock so high?
"There’s nothing holding Disney back, with all of the future marvel content which will bring endless streaming success and parks opening back up nothing will stop it from soaring"
I'm starting to think Disney doesn't care about their stockholders.
Disneyland reopening date is imminent.... CA Schools already have reoppening date for March. I would say April for Disneyland at latest.
"Everybody chill.....Disney isn't going to go bankrupt. Share price will eventually go back up, it's just a question of predicting when the bounce will happen. How many times have you held a stock and wished you'd got in when the price was lower? Well, here you go, this is your opportunity. The only people that should be sweating are people who want to cash out in the short term"
"We don't even need to hear the Outlook with 8 Marvel films, 4 Avatar Films, and mutiple star wars films along with updated parks and Disney+...:) Long term hold and make bank. This is not a stock to trade."
were tired of the constant nickel and dime mentality its so bad for our country honestly
CDC Guidelines saying that vaccinated people can gather with other vaccinated people (and with low-risk people...i.e. kids) with no masks or distancing. With over 2m vaccinations being given daily...that is going to be LOTS of people eligible to spend big bucks at theme parks during April school vacation week 
$140 on Monday.
Disney. here to save the day
"Own DIS for many years, shares bought through years starting from $26 and until recently about one year ago at round $95 to $98. Will hold until retirement which is about another 20 years. Good luck longs."
"Six month's investor 10k, stagnate stock , no dividend increase. Seams (is manluipated) by wall street. Earning a better return on speculative bio-pharma stocks."
"I Like the $DIS numbers. Anyone else think even without the up coming squeeze, that AMC is a re-open play. The price here seems reasonable, and they are more or less coming out of bankruptcy. AMC is an easy $5 billion market cap company."
Going to $193 soon
I think DIS 125 about 6 to 8 months.
The experience at the parks is horrible.
"Solo not doing well, that probably wont help the stock come Tuesday. DIS needs a change of leadership throughout."
95M subs future looks good.
Do you think Disney stock is on the top ?
LG offering free Disney plus on new TV  and this is Disney every day cutting deals with everyone 
"Dis+ at about half the subscribers of Netflix. Netflix worth 250b. Dis+ worth 125B. parks cruises inevitably go back to previous levels, unless you believe pandemic never ends (and if you think that, you are selling all stocks to buy gold right now). DIS at 300b pre pandemic and Disney plus. 300b+125b = 425b = 235 a share after economy re opens fully. Experts say herd immunity by fall at latest. Then factor in 240 subscribers by 2024 target for future growth and pent up demand on parks and cruises if you are a bull.. short this stock and drive the price down I will make it my biggest position"
"Walt Disney Co said on Tuesday it had eliminated performance-based bonuses last year for top executives, including Executive Chairman Bob Iger, as the media company looks to soften the impact of the COVID-19 fallout."
Is that a green color? It’s been so long I can’t even tell.
$145 Monday.
Just subscribed for the year! The platform UX is fantastic.
"Keep your cool and buy as much as you can. The DIS game will soon be over, and the stock will end today in GREEN. Nothing will stop that."
"Disney 115-120 by end of December. If they close the deal with Fox this stock will skyrocket. Here is a partial list of the franchises Disney could acquire in a deal with Fox: Avatar, Alien, Planet of the Apes, Predator, Simpsons, X-Men, Ice Age. Just consider how many billions Disney could mlk from these iconic franchises.DISNEY LONG."
Frozen 2 on Disney Plus EARLY...
Disney will come back up .. Too much revenue to not .. The acquisition of Fox and the lost revenue of Netflix is already on the books .. No where to go but up .. Bettet grab em now ..
@IronNippalz - better buy some wine and flowers tonight. DIS closed above 114!
How is Disney steady breaking box office records yet the stock declines?
The future looks green.https://jordanbusinessreview.com/walt-disney-nysedis-stock-rating-reaffirmed-by-rosenblatt-securities/
California disney is opening Hopefully this will move to 183-184 WithJobs report 8:30 if good markets will be upAgain 
US and China decided to cease fire on trade wars. Let's hope this stops the correction period!
"Aladdin officially hit $1 billion this weekend. Lion King came out last week and is already at an estimated $962 million worldwide. Toy Story 4 is at $917 million. Toy Story should hit $1 billion in the next week or two. Lion King will cross $1 billion this week easily, and I think it will eventually settle between $1.5 - $2 billion."
Like if nervous
Disney also confirmed that “there are no plans to release Disney+ subscriber data outside of The Walt Disney Company’s quarterly earnings calls.” The next time we’ll hear about subscriber numbers will be in early 2020.
Great time to buy people
"FOX Shareholder vote set for 7/27/18!!!Shareholders of 21st Century Fox Inc. are set to meet July 27 to vote on Walt Disney Co.’s $71.3 billion offer for its entertainment assets, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The special meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. at the New York Hilton in midtown Manhattan, the person said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. Disney won antitrust approval for its deal from the U.S. Department of Justice Wednesday, giving it another edge over Comcast Corp., which is also vying for the assets."
"Up a little but even with good earnings, spectacular movie openings and over priced park admissions, this stock can't seem to budge up anywhere near $115. What's it going to take? I had higher hopes for DIS."
"Seriously, What educated, financially able person to afford $150-$500 night hotel room would risk 1, or all of his children's life for a trip to Disneyland?.....think about it for a few minutes....even a 2% chance of death.....who would do that?.....certainly not someone that could afford to put off a vacation for 6-12 months."
$200 right around da corner
200$ by tomorrow 
Climbing fast now
"For all the longs out there, I am seeing great things on the charts for DIS. The EMA's have a healthy distance from each other and are pointing in the right direction for a continued upward trend for a while. He who must not be named is constantly spewing stats that only shorts care about, so I thought I'd switch it up and point out that technicals for longs are looking great! GLTA!"
It's so cute to see shorts still trying desperately to convince people to sell. Poor guys.
"Anyone have an estimate for Disney+ pricing? Give me your best guesses. What about a 3 headed plan? Disney+, ESPN+, Hulu combo?"
"Goldman reinstates its buy rating on Disney and its 12-month price target of $142, which would translate into a 26 percent gain for the stock."
Still falling...
"You see the new article by investopedia? Basically says sell due to chart/price history. I get these chartists... but really seems odd to never take anything else into consideration. If nothing had changed with Dis over the year(s) sure maybe the chart would be the way to go, but when things are changing within a company how can you only look at the chart? They do this all the time and are wrong a lot when there is changes within the company or ERs. Oh well..."
"Now is the time for calls. They’re lower cost. The stochastics indicate now is not the time to sell, but an indicator to buy."
"Today is the day, better soar like Maleficent and break $150, make it $!60 at this point."
"I wasn't a believer in an ESPN streaming service but now with the DOJ saying that Disney will have to sell the regional sports networks, all the hype around the potential of an ESPN streaming service should be gone. So what is ESPN going to offer now?The future of Disney's streaming services looks cloudy to me; I think it's going to be very hard to convince people to buy in. But I'm looking forward to seeing an X-Men reboot."
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/08/disney-nears-10-billion-global-box-office-record.htmlWOW!
undervalued.......should be trading above $300 per share minimum
The re-organization announcement with Kevin Mayer leading the push for streaming service sounds very positive.
"Disney Longs - Change My Mind. Can we agree that SVOD is the only growing part of this business? If not, please give arguments to change my mind.The following are my key concerns with DIS.1. Theme Parks - Covid19 permanently changes behavior and this becomes a declining revenue business. (37% of DIS revenue) - Please change my mind....2. Movie Theaters (16% of revenue) - Covid19 is the last straw that pushes more movie releases to different platforms. People aren't as likely to pack into crowded theaters for a while. I believe some theaters will survive as a nostalgia play, but it will never return to normal. Change my mind.....3. Cascading effects of theater downturn will decrease the demand for SVOD because of the lack of marketing and the excitement around the opening of theater blockbusters. Streaming is the future, but I'm leaning toward AVOD, or ad-supported vs the subscription. Change my mind.....4. Hotels - How much of Disney's hotel business is tied to the theme parks?5. Cruises - I don't think the cruise industry will ever be the same. I've been on three cruises in my lifetime and I vowed to never go on one again, prior to Covid19. I'll admit I'm 6-2 and 235 pounds and I don't like small spaces. Also, I don't like buffets, so I may not be objectively looking at his. Change my mind.....6. Linear Television (ABC & ESPN) - This is the most profitable area of television, but it's in decline. SVOD & AVOD will continue to erode this business. Change my mind....7. Disney Plus is what all long investors are excited about. However, I argue that it is more reactionary and ultimately less profitable than linear television. Change my mind.....Last question: How long can Disney survive with the parks and movie theaters being closed (53% of revenue turned off)? Currently, their quick ratio is at a level that indicates risk in their ability to pay current liabilities. How much longer can they go with the shutdown before they need to sell assets, or raise capital?Does anyone know what their daily/weekly cash burn rate is currently in the shutdown?"
Anyone catch that red? Went by pretty quickly!
"Maybe if Disney changed their name to ""Disney Blockchain"" the stock would actually move up?"
Anyone else see those 2 aftermarket trades at $106.92 ? Good sign for a quick bounce back I guess.
my Yahoo app is really glitchy today with the stock price updates. just using my brokerage account for stock prices.
Any less than $200 is a crime to humanity.
"Thank Jim Cramer for piling on to the China flu virus scare. Not to minimize, but doesn't the flu virus appear every winter and unfortunately cost some people their lives? Media creates way too much drama. Sounds like China is taking aggressive initiatives to stop the spread. This is an excuse for a market correction. Take advantage of the buying opportunities."
"I'm hoping despite the volatile market, Dis breaks through again!Dis can do it! "
The headline says “Apple ready to burn cash on streaming service! “ ... Disney doesn’t have to burn cash on their streaming service . Unlike everyone else Disney is well established and their movies are paid for . They already have a massive collection of kids shows and They have the infrastructure to make new shows
Any less than $200 just isn't right. This stock is way too undervalued and should be sitting at $250 considering the vaccine distribution.
"Last night on Fast Money, Guy Adami said he doesn't see Disney going above it's 52-week high for a long, long time. That was 12 hours ago. LoL! The market hasn't even opened for regular trading since he said that, and he's already wrong. How embarrassing is that?"
Should I hold my breath that we will ever see $114 in the near future or is this trending back down to $100?
I had early problems with Disney Plus yesterday early but they were all resolved by evening. Don't know who's responsible for such outrageous issues like Dutch subtitles on the High School Musical and countless movies that wouldn't load. Today things are running very smoothly but the bad pub was done.
"Since all the Netflix fan boys love to stop by.... Disney is up 30% for the year, while Netflix is now down over 2% for that same time frame. The gap is about 33%."
Migration from Netflix to DIS ...will steadily climb 135 sometime soon.
Cancel your Disney cable and boycott their stores and parks...
$150 today??

"Shorties be trying HARD to make this a negative ER. Everyone expected terrible earning and they showed a small profit. No one saw that coming. Another one of those situations where you need to say oops, cover your position, and move on to the next. Feel free to give me a thumbs down on your way out. Nothing but smiles here."
why is it down so much???
"ALERT: Longs are being setup for a classic pump n dump. Last week was part one, the pump. This week is part two, the dump. These valuations are not supported by the lack of earnings. Plan accordingly."
i’m just about up $10 a share since i bought in before earnings. can’t be any happier than that.
get out now before the backlash... disney is learning...go woke..go broke... free fall coming
"If you’d like to my know my top stock idea for the economy reopening, it is Disney. The combination of theme parks being shut down as well as theaters has crippled Disney’s revenue and free cash flow. In addition to that Disney Plus is expected to rival Netflix in terms of streaming, and has only touched a fraction of its future subscribers, or in the finance world we call that TAM (total addressable market). All in all that means the stock is very cheap at these levels compared to where it will trade in the future. Once theme parks and theaters reopen Disney’s revenue and cash flow will soar, and Disney Plus implies hyper growth is ahead for this name."
"so with the pre-thursday screenings added to fri + sat, it's looking like a $130+ million weekend draw on frozen 2 minus the sun day numbers ....but keep in-mind that on thanksgiving the theaters will be jammed with parents waiting to take their kids to see the film then = $200+ million from thurs - thurs estimates (domestic). frozen 2 will challenged frozen 2's worldwide numbers from now - next weekend imvho!"
Thousand and one pumpers. I miss our quiet board
19 November - launch in Australia !!!
Disney will hit $200 this year if economy picks up. They are taking market share from Netflix.
Buying more DIS in the morning. Disney Plus adding Singapore to its ever growing expansion on Feb 23th
Going to sell a couple 190 puts next week.
Interesting fact. It's Mickey Mouse's birthday today. Mickey turns 91 years old.
"Nobody likes a down day. the trade war is all theatrics. every time the dow get above 27,000. there is a negative headline, its almost comical (very obvious). I look at alot of stock levels then I like a disney. Its potential, a proven company, amd many catalyst going for it. Remember the people that make the money are the ones that buy good companies on the dip. If we wait a day,week or a month then we wait. Patience and we will all be rewarded young skywalkers. ASK YOURSELF if you never owned disney amd have an opportunity to own at these levels would you?"
Disney plus was the most downloaded app of Q4 in 2019
New highs today.$203 next?
"I often predict what earnings are coming out as. There is too much noise, this time, however.I somehow remember that Disney gives some real advance notice of the earnings announcement. There seems to be some delay. Maybe they are still coming to grips with the difficult Fox purchase, at least as to the movie studio. Maybe they are waiting for some numbers on streaming (present ongoing numbers, which won't be in the earnings, but they might want to give to boilster sentiment [which I doubt because they don't do that). But not optimistic delays.Normally, I would say that Disney is going to have great numbers this past quarter - a blockbuster that they've never had this quarter - Lion King - but the lack of stock buybacks (recently stopped), and the Fox issues, don't help.As frustrating that the Fox movies have been a victim of the delay in the merger, Disney will turn it around, Disney will have a firm entry on the older segment that they have never really had. This is worthwhile. And they will have a real streaming presence - I went on site to see what Netflix movies I might want to stream - there were over 3000, and I noted less than 20 (and I might only get to about 4) - and there might have been a total of 100 (if that much) that might be considered quality - almost all were junk. Disney+, with its Fox library, will have hit after hit. They will be light years ahead of Netflix. Yes, Netflix has some new productions, but so will Disney and Hulu. If you see the stock drop any more - buy. It will be 150 in the Spring. And I wouldn't be surprised to see it hit 200 by the end of next year. And, if you see that, you are really off to the races."
"Now let's just hold at 132 until Disney+ launch, and then we are off to 135."
52 week high. Dow 30 stock. Disney will rolling back licensing for Netflix Next year and Sky to favor their own must have streaming service. Parks are hitting all 4 cylinders cause the economy is hot. It should break 120 this summer easy. Don’t be a fool to sell here
"That's it then.Bloomberg has just labelled disney 'a tech company'.This will be priced accordingly and I don't see a netflix style price earnings ratio it is likely to reach somewhere in between where it is now and netflix astronomical PE.I'm going to sleep, and try not to let dreams of all the money that's to come keep me up.Good luck all."
Just realized there appears to be a lot of those spam messages again... Do they only appear when Dis is poppin?
This stock is a keeper boy. Onwards and upwards.
"Management is not about what Walt wanted!! We (Disneylovers) have seen first hand how much the parks have changed since Walt died.. it is all about money and they don’t care about the customer. Walt Disney believed in innovation, animation, and resilience. This new management only cares about making a profit. Walt Disney wanted all children both young and old to be able to experience joy and laughter at any age. Now the parks charge 200$ or more for a day ticket. I remember when I was young it was 100$ a yr. my 7 yr old doesn’t want to go anymore cause she says it so to over crowded. Be careful with your money."
"Hey Shorts & Doubters, you elation is premature. If you are trading (day trading) good luck to you. Personally, I invest & do not trade (day trade). I prefer roller coasters at Disney not with my money. Once again traders (day traders enjoy the roller coaster. MAYBE I'll see you at the bank. I will be there, will you ?"

"I don't get why people think that by creating their own content for streaming, Disney is burning through cash. Disney already creates their own content...it's what they do. It's what their theme parks are based off of. It's what everything they do is based off of. So Disney was already going to create these films or series, why does putting it on a streaming platform automatically make it more expensive? Movie theaters, DVD/Blu-ray, Disney channel, streaming...these are all platforms that Disney uses already. So why not own a streaming service! It's a no-brainer!"
"Dear Mr. IgerWhat have I done to deserve all. • I’ve subscribed to Disney+• I’ve painfully sat through a third of the live action film Aladdin • I’ve painful watch the markets and all other stock gap up. • I’ve googled daily Disney news to help keep Disney up in top search fields I’m exhausted, can’t wait till earnings, the expected pop of 12% I’m dreaming of"
Looking forward to tomorrow.
"Bloomberg: Brazil expected to OK Fox-Disney deal without divestmentJan. 3, 2019 4:07 PM•Jason AycockAntitrust regulators in Brazil are expected to approve the media-asset deal between Twenty-First Century Fox (FOX, FOXA) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) without pressing for any property sales, Bloomberg reports.The regulator, CADE, is expecting to see a proposal from the two companies that includes behavioral changes after some back-and-forth meetings in December.Concerns centered on the sports impact from the combination of ESPN and Fox Sports, according to the report, though CADE is aware that other services compete in sports broadcasting.A ruling could come as soon as Jan. 30, when regulators come back from year-end recess."
Markets should explode today with approval
"I'm getting really tired of all these people promising that DIS will go down! When??? I want a quick dip so I can add to my position! Everyday we hear ""it's going down! It's overbought!"" Yet everyday it keeps going up, up, UP! Where's my chance to buy more?!?! "
over priced IMHO but what isn't ?

"I've officially started incorporating Trump psychology into my prediction of where stocks will go lol. I think since Trump wants to get reelected, he will bring good news to the table very soon. I also think he wants to end August on a high note in the market so he doesn't continue to upset Wall Street. Normally I would be cautious about a stock raising just because of news on trade wars, but in this case I think it's a safe bet that the upcoming days will be good."
Can’t wait to see price in 6 months :) 140-150ish :)
"A simple lesson in investing today: Netflix over Disney. Tesla over Ford. Amazon over Walmart. It is simply Future over Past, Growth over Value. That is what the stock market is about and always has been. Not what it's worth, what it's going to be worth."
"Word on the street is, if we can close above 136 there is a good chance we will break out of 140 shortly after."
After Tuesday earnings could be at 112.00.
This is a lifetime hold for me. I won't sell until I retire or may pass it on to my kids. It's a safe investment pretty much guaranteed to grow over time. I have plenty of other investments that I plan on selling when they reach a certain point. There really is no ceiling for Disney.
"DIS as a buy. Going forward, the Marvel and Star Wars assets remain infinite gold mines. Disney is the no.1 player in the $200 billion global IP licensing business.The latest Avengers movie will break global theater gross sales. Further, this Marvel franchise movie will generate more sales from IP licensing.Disney’s stock has a P/E valuation higher than the average ratio of its peers. Going forward, Disney’s library of movies, brands, TV shows, makes it the King of Entertainment.The upcoming launch of Disney Plus paid streaming service is another inspiring tailwind for Disney. Maybe two years from now, investors will value DIS like NFLX: https://iknowfirst.com/disney-stock-forecast-raise-your-bets-on-disney"
"This is frustrating. I think the market was expecting a number of north of 30 million subscribers (and I was too). But this was just a little too optimistic. But if you compare expectations only 6 months ago, I would say that 26.5 million (or 28.6 as of Monday) is quite a number. And the real number is 2.1 million additions in the last month. That puts it on target to have 50 million by year end. And this number is only really for US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. I think 75 - 100 million is achievable with the next year. And I understand that that Disney has a lot of subscribers that are paying the full $7/month, perhaps more than expected. And there doesn't seem to be a ""churn rate"" - that is, people dropping it after seeing the shows they were looking for.It as a buying opportunity at 136, and it is a buying opportunity at 141. And it will also be a buying opportunity at 145, 150, 160. And I think you just might see 150 in the two weeks"

"Disney's stock the only Dow component gaining ground premarket, after analyst boosts price targetMARKETWATCH - 15 MINUTES AGOWalt Disney Co.'s (DIS) stock (DIS) rose 0.4% in premarket trade Tuesday, and was the only one of 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average components gaining ground, after an upbeat analyst call. The gain comes in the face of a broader market selloff (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-lower-as-trade-tensions-stay-in-the-spotlight-2019-05-07), with Dow futures tumbling 222 points, amid concerns that the U.S.-China trade dispute is escalating. Analyst David Miller at Imperial Capital raised his stock price target on Disney (DIS) to $147 from $139, while reiterating his outperform rating, as the media giant's blockbuster film ""Avengers: Endgame"" continues to break box-office records and ahead of Disney's (DIS) fiscal second-quarter report scheduled for May 8."
Please let today be a good day and keep all crazy people from tweeting.
Is it me or is DIS STILL not down to $50...let alone $70?
buy buy before it reaches $120
Impressive revenues but earnings missed and will only get worse.
"i can only watch so much stuff between Netflix, Huhu, Disney, Amazon etc. Theme parks are rotting."
"Disney+ not worth the priceI bought it for a 1 year special for $60. Loved the Mandolorian. Glad I got to see Hamilton, which was terrible, but glad I watched it. That's it. There was some unforgettable animated film out a couple of months ago. I've seen everything else. No original content. Not worth the price. Now they want to charge you $30 for the remake of Mulan? Will let it expire. When Mandolorian season 2 comes out will buy for 1 month and let it lapse after that."
how is this UP?

wow! dont we have the most optimistic people on this board. fellas we are up today. 12 days away from.earnings and roughly 2 weeks away from Disney+ launch. Were going higher! GLTA
Hope the field trip is going well. Beautiful day in Anaheim.

"I’ve been thinking about Disney +, Hulu and ESPN streaming. We all know Disney is king of content, even more so know after Fox deal. That being said, I’m excited about getting access to Disney’s vault of older movies, being able to stream and watch everywhere Disney movies in lieu of buying the DVD’s or buying digital rights. But none of these are enough for me to continue paying a monthly fee for streaming. That brings up the question...What would make you keep paying a monthly fee for Disney streaming? They would have to offer something different than Netflix and create series or expand story telling on their popular characters and movies. They certainly have plenty of brands and franchises. I’m confident Iger and team can accomplish this. Imagine if Disney released a handful of movies each year exclusively on its streaming platform (ie: Avengers Endgame, Lion King, Frozen 2) The number of people subscribing and remaining a customer would be substantial. There is so much more to discuss about Disney streaming but I would like to hear other intellectual opinions."
"I saw so many analysts on tv saying that they were waiting for Disney to close the parks to buy the stock because that will signal the bottom. Here’s the thing, that could have been true if parks were closed in conjunction with the virus peaking. That is not the case and this will probably be a fake bounce. It is better to buy the stock for an additional 2$ than to buy right before it drops another 10$. Not sure why people think the market is going to jump to pre- corona market conditions like nothing. If during a great economic time, most people can’t afford to skip a single check, what makes people think that we are going to bounce like nothing has changed?"
Disney is way oversold and a pop rally will take this back to$110 by Friday. GLTA
What a great stock to own. I can't count the number of posters warning that this start was going to 120 or 130. And here we are hanging around 140 on a down day for the market. I admit I am concerned about the upcoming meeting with President Xi but Iger has played his hand well with China and hopefully Disney will fare better than most if the trade war escalates.
"Disney will do fine. Family incomes are up, travel costs are down. Business will be stronger on those factors."

Its kind a funny how DIS waited till a day like this to be up. Most people would have sold it during an up market and DIS is in the red. Now regret that they have sold !!!
Slowly dyingI still see great weakness in market it was near 100 last week. The market will go through some bad spots next 6 months. It’s nervous as hell right now so watch for more weakness. But if Netflix is 270.00 with only streaming service look out for Disney second half of 2019 and beyond. They won’t do it but I would love they put all there streaming in one bundle ESPN+ HULU and DISNEY+ Anyway this is only beginning for Disney.

i ain’t mad if it closes red today.
"Gents, I applaud all of you. We stuck with why we bought Dis. I truly feel sorry whoever sold prior to earnings. I have been in this game for many,many years and the biggest lesson Inwas taught was always ask yourself why you bought the stock in the first place. Bravo gentlemen!!! gotto catch my 6 pm steakhouse reservation. One last thing whoever paid these trolls/spammers did a horrible job and were not very persuasive."
Beat earnings....down nearly 1% on a great up day for the market. This seems worrisome.
underbought from Friday - will be up big Monday
Dis will test new high within a few weeks. Aladdin opens up the early summer and new park in Orlando opens Star Wars. PR will spin the news. This is the classic case for DIS to test new high.
Hmmm.... What's with all the after hours red? Any theories?
"Just bought more but dang, getting a little expensive. Yes, new price targets will do that."
MAGA!
"There is a report that Hulu is expanding very very nicely. Much better than its competitor Direct TV Now.I did not realize that Hulu is similar to Direct TV Now. I had Direct TV Now last summer for 3 months that it was on special. I was very satisfied with it, but switched when i could get Cable for cheaper (I've already told you too much on price, so I won't bore you more).But this is very interesting. If the DTVN format is really the Hulu format, this is a real product that can substitute for cable. You can get a nice variety of local and national channels, get ESPN, Disney and, if Disney bundles, ESPN+ and Disney+. And there is a lot about Cable losing 20 million subscribers - and this is a real issue. But add Hulu's 23 million subscribers (that may be a prediction for year end), and that makes up on this for that loss alone.I believe that Hulu is the real gem of the Fox purchase. They will own 60%. They will pick up ATT's 10% soon. They will force Comcast to sell it the other 30% soon - I think they are biding their time on Comcast, because they have a wink wink agreement because Disney didn't push the SKY deal more to wring out a little more money from Comcast (they could have refused to sell the remaining 39% Fox owned unless they upped the price)."
"Bear flag, target $155, bearish."

bought into DIS pre-earnings release yesterday thinking it would easily jump to 200 today ....didn't see it dipping back like this.
Congratulations longs! This is just getting started!!!!
All I can say at this point is buy this dip and hold
It’s hard to imagine that this stock won’t skyrocket once they build out the synergies from Hulu and fox. They are essentially cutting out the middle man (directv/dish etc) and will own the whole process from production to distribution.

"DIS EARNINGS gear up long-term , but it's stock price did rise long-term, some investors fear AMZN and NFLX, SO they sold out DIS, but DIS EARNINGS still rise, that means NFLX and AMZN didn't affect DIS business, SO it's time to buy DIS now,"

Does it get better than this?
So I think given the massive run up that DIS will actually go down after earnings. Bet my wife 50 bucks. She thinks it will be near 140 when all is said and done.
lets keep the positive momentum going!!!!!!!!
"I bought more than 3K shares last year and now am suffering from downward. I am sure if Disney had prepared their own contents along with the Fox merger and Disney+ launch, we could have enjoyed stock price high just like Netflix during this Corona outbreak. No original series since Disney+ launch except several Mandalorians. They had done nothing between Disney+ announcement in April last year and Disney+ launch in November last year, what a shame! They just enjoyed they became a huge entertainment company."

"Dis stocks been shady lately. I guess this is just an over reaction to any news that pop up. Dis be making more right now from streaming than when all their parks, hotels, cruise line, still function. Just my opinion."
"Disney has a real shot of hitting $250 by EOY. They have so many new shows planned that will attract both young and old. Their streaming service deserves a Netflix multiple and with time we’ll see that play out. Sports betting will increase espn+ membership, marvel and Star Wars will drive Disney plus, and Hulu just needs to keep steadily growing as it has been all this time.Throw in so much pent up demand for their box office hits, cruises, and theme parks. Suspending the dividend to reinvest in the business is going to lead to the best 2-3 year run the company has ever seen. I really do see a “roaring 20’s” mentality hitting the world in 2022 and 2023 and Disney will be the biggest beneficiary of that.Is this where I’m supposed to put 20 rocket emojis?!? "

Big deal about the outages in DIS. There were plenty of outages in NFLX when the stock was in the 100's and 200's.
Roku really makes no sense. Talk about over inflated!?
"For those wondering about the spike: comcast (nbcuniversal), disney, and sea world will be meeting tomorrow afternoon to discuss plans to reopen the park in orlando. With all the nba talk for disney world, i wouldnt be surprised if that news was released as well."
Disney is setting itself up to be the king of media . There’s no end in sight to the billion dollar movies they’re pumping out year after year . Disney Plus is going to be a world wide sensation and they’ll likely turn 20th century fox into another money making machine via better movies / blockbusters
"Disney debt has risen 16% to $64.42 billion, with $54.20 billion in long-term debt and $10.22 billion in current debt. The corona crises is at the beginning stages, not the end. All streaming growth is with no profit. Growth at expense of profit. This is not going to end well. Perfect time to sell into this short squeeze"
"Not sure how many here are long term Disney investors but I’m going to bounce this thought out there... Iger went out and bought all these media companies and content, content creation, he even acquired the streaming hardware company and nobody ever put those pieces together that he was building a streaming service, he even got Netflix to rent his media content.... After watching him 4 times on tv it just seems to me that he knows something we don’t, I think he knows his brand is huge and Amazin, Google, Apple or Comcast is going to buy them out. We are missing something because clearly this company and content is worth $300/share easily TODAY, but if he can roll this out including China I would bet he has over 300m streaming customers overnext two years. Thumbs up if you agree thumbs down  if you don’t think someone will buy them before it’s too late?"
There's potential for a pop tomorrow if Disney does a surprise announcement of how many people were subbed for the opening day. If the # is impressive we may see a nice surge.
"I think the 112.00 level will be tested, and I think it holds today. Anyone elses thoughts?"
is this stock frozen as well?
"Just purchased my first shares since converting to cash two weeks ago. Disney is turning into a subscription model which justifies higher PE ratios, look at Netflix. This virus will push Disney plus subscriptions to the roof and benefit Disney in the long term. If you need short term cash you should have sold already and I would not be buying. 5-10 year horizon this is the time to buy Disney. I'm young and a high risk investor though. 66% cash, 33% Disney is what I'm currently sitting on."

More strong hands will keep piling in. $189 is the new low I am not complaining. Many people get in...stock gets manipulated and people get out. Been holding on the ups and downs since the 90s when the pandemic hit. Will not sell until this is a $1000/share which it will be in the next 3 years.

Mannn if it breaks that $200 wall...as the kids say these days TO THE MOOOONNN
"Ready for 146 this week? $150 next week. Anyway, I’m thinking today Disney starts ripping higher"
green!
"No matter if the numbers disappoint, everyone invested in Disney should be looking for guidance and long term . When things return to normal after the pandemic, this will be back up over $125-$135 to $150. This is not a day trading stock. People who own DISNEY shares are long time investors and even investors that have passed away and inherited the stock from generation to generation."
"China said to approve Disney, Fox deal without conditions, Dealreporter says China's State Administration for Market Regulation is on track to complete its antitrust review of Disney's (DIS) acquisition of 21st Century Fox (FOXA) assetsm, Dealreporter reports, citing two sources familiar with the matter. The agency is expected to approve the transaction without conditions, sources told Dealreporter."
"Disney parks are not likely to reopen this summer like the bulls here are hoping for. Disney is burning cash by the day, which is being covered by that $11 Billion in raised debt. If you think Disney+ will cover the enormous overhead costs of their parks, stores, etc. then good luck to you and buy all you can. It just won't and Disney's earnings in a few weeks will show the mounting damages. Disney+ has 50 million subs which is producing $3.2B in revenue. Reports suggested before Covid-19, Plus wasn't even profitable! This does NOT offset the approximate $6 Billion in losses from the rest of the business. This stock will tank to around $80 per share if not lower, if parks cannot resume by the end of this summer. This next few weeks and onward will get ugly for the entire economy, as jobless reports keep coming in, and Covid-19 earnings reports start rolling out. Just like in 2008, the false bear market rally ended in another 30% market wide drop. Good luck and be patient to buy in.https://dvcnews.com/other-resources/4736-california-florida-officials-cast-doubt-on-theme-parks-reopening?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=facebook&fbclid=IwAR1sLkEN4hUt8XHAv0h4swPs-JaybtNYoxaEynKhmrbPizsPH8FyNS9IWJQ"
"The 1, 2 and 5 year charts of Disney and Starbucks are very similar. Both considered growth stocks until 2015 they are now going sideways but with Disney performing less well than Starbucks, especially in recent months. Disney has more in common with Starbuck than it does with Netflix."
Y’all heard about the new Disney ride? It’s called the  all aboard!!!
DIS PLUS PROFITABLE THIS YEAR WITH THE PARKS FULLY OPEN...WE ARE LOOKING AT A $300 STOCK
"Much like AAPL the 1st year of their transition to service heavy company from HARDWARE , Disney is still being valued as a theme park operator and purveyor of movies, NOT STREAMING! The LIGHT WILL GO ON eventually and Disneys NEW STREAM OF REVENUE will push P/E'S to reflect it....Then we will trade closer to 175-200....PATIENCE!"
It would be nice if Verizon has a good earnings report today. That may help get DIS a few mentions about the partnership and get that in the headlines again.
Managed to buy some more when it slipped under 133 for a moment
"People have patience with DIS. It will pay off to be a long term holder. You can't guess which week or which Friday it's going to go up. If you don't believe this company has a superior product and service, then dont buy it. I bought 1000 shares of this in Dec 2018 when the whole market was going to hell and then I bought another lot of shares one week and 2 weeks before the Disney+ announcement. Yes, the price has come back down to the April level and now I'm adding more. Trump isn't going to get impeached, so this is just a buying opportunity. It may take a month or 2 before this stock resumes upward movement. I think when the streaming service is launched and we start seeing the subscriber numbers, it will move. Just like Netflix went down when they announced losing subscribers."
Win 4. Dis!!!
Friday my option was up 2000% I should have sold it.
Nflx subscribers are switching to DIS. Brutal for NFLX longs tomorrow
Who else is excited for the new episodes to drop on Disney+ tomorrow? Disney+ bringing families closer together one episode a time!
By close tomorrow DIS should be up around 120 already :) hahaha
past couple trading sessions i’ve noticed that anytime it’s been down more than $1.00. it always comes back and regains its loses. great time to buy.
Disney launching a whole collection of toys and merchandise around baby Yoda. lol. I love this company.
180 tomorrow. Sell now
"Question; If you subsrcribe to Netflix, Can you subscribe to Disney also. Sorry, I am having a hard time with this keyboard."
perfect setup going into earnings. plus tomorrow!! easily hit 145-150 before earnings!!! then 165-170!!!’
Still afraid to reenter. This virus gonna affect things big time. Still on standby
$120 On the Way ....
This trade war talk is all temporary. Trump is also temporary. DIS will hold up better than most.
Waiting for $145 to enter
Never thought people give reward to Disney for their leadership. It's good. Right stock going higher is better than anything in this market. At least few thing going right direction.Wish I kept my stock but happy for other who able to hold and profit.
disney will blast through 1 yr high... Look to mid 120s next week.
Strong brand. DIS is definitely a cult stock.In for 250 shares avg price $117.34.Will flip
"The truth is Disney + is a binary event and until February 4th you won’t be rewarded for investing in Disney but to listen to these people whine you know they didn’t do their homework before buying Disney. If you had you would have known Disney removed stock buyback two quarters ago and the impact that has on a stock entering a binary event. You would have dig through the news releases to learn that Disney despite price movement was executing on its Disney + strategy, park renovation strategy and Fox acquisitions . Here’s what your missing Dave and other weak hands.... Disney + in less than three months will have 35-50m subscribers when they report which is AMAZING growth, they will CRUSH their earnings with the release of two blockbuster movies this quarter and good weather for parks.You can trash talk Disney for price action but you should have done homework before buying and entered at a level you felt comfortable with. By March we are closer to $200 than $150 and hopefully you (investors) that just expect a stock to rise the day you buy it will be watching from the sidelines lol "
UuUGggHhh.I hit the buy button..I never go into earnings .But something is saying. The price is not totally baked in here.I think it breaks 208pps..
"Bought at $82 on Monday, sold today for $104.28. Will buy again cheaper next week!"
"Investors and analysts are starting to realize that Netflix is overvalued and is going to have a lot of competition soon. Disney and Amazon are the main competitors but Disney has the advantage in my view. They are undervalued and have a tremendous amount of intellectual property. I'm not saying Netflix will go bankrupt or anything like that, but I think from an investment standpoint DIS is the place to be in the streaming market."
Crazy stuff. Netflix said that Disney's subscription numbers are impressive. Goofy traders are selling Disney. The Market is upside down.
"DIS stock split is coming, you heard it here first; I wonder if they will announce it at earnings? Look at the history: They split every ten years or so (over due), plus the share price is high, with tons of room for growth (streaming): retail like DIS at 35-75 Range. Why not reward people who held during pandemic? I think 3-1 is around the corner...12/18/1962 103 for 10011/16/1967 2 for 103/01/1971 2 for 101/16/1973 2 for 103/06/1986 4 for 105/18/1992 4 for 107/10/1998 3 for 106/13/2007 1014 for 1000Past MOTLEY FOOL article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/09/29/will-disney-split-its-stock/"
glad i didnt buy disney now.. under 165 this goes
"Gotta love the American version of capitalism: On one hand, the government tells banks that they can't kick people out even if they don't pay mortgage for months. On the other hand, they keep printing money to hand out stimulus checks. Well, what did you expect would happen? People keep spending and buying stuff, also ultimately, money circulates back to the corporations. Yay!"
DIS could easily add another 100 billion to its market cap based on streaming. It's no longer just a media company.
This is obviously big money keeping the stock down before earnings. This is a very good sign! This means that people who actually know what they are doing are predicting a surge after ER! They are making room for it. :)
https://www.ocregister.com/disneyland-and-other-theme-parks-cant-reopen-for-months-under-state-planFeeling sorry for those who bought Friday because of FOMP
Back to 200$+Let's do it
Easiest sell ever after hearing that Carano news. Thanks for the bread disney
Strap into this roller coaster today is going to be wild if pre market selling is any indicator.

The stimulus approval will move markets up at least 600 and gdp and jobs report should push this over 200
"When you get in markets like this, and I have been through two of them, there is no telling what prices you will get so what I am doing is looking for stocks that are good businesses with single digit PE ratios and high dividend yield. I bought some FUN for a single digit PE and a dividend yield of 20 per cent, and then it went even lower. Arguably DIS maybe a better company than FUN but in many respects amusement parks are amusement parks, though DIS has the movie and content component that are very valuable. Maybe put in a limit order at 30 and see if it fills. Probably won't but you never know. If it goes lower then you will have to deal with that for a while but that 30 price looks like theft over the long-term."
"very cool, report is out!----------------------------------Top Takeaways2★ Disney+ has been downloaded 22 million times inthe four weeks since its official launch★ Competitors remain largely unaffected in termsof their performance★ Disney+ is boosting new installs of Hulu, ESPNand Roku"
"Man, it’s too early for the booger sugar mr options trader. Chillax !"
100 million subs ESPN deal Park’s opening 1st Cruises end of May Dividends coming Stimulus today checks out next week vacation money to Disney This has to move in 225s
A simple thought. This pandemic is a worst possible scenario for a company like DIS. I'm happy to see how DIS has navigated through this catastrophic storm. Smooth sailing ahead
This should take the path netflix did but in a year or two. I see this priced at $500 by end of 2022 with the expectation that it will grow into that early price surge. If Roku can explode within 12 months why can't this.
"109 topped then dropped fast today...why,,,everyone wants out at 109 early this morning,,,,now the struggle to hold 107 and run,,,lets see 120"
"Good opportunity to buy some more, right?"
Back to 185s
"Tell me again, why am I holding this?"
Disney too the moon!!!!
"I noticed CNBC didn't even mention the deal getting regulatory approval. It's ironic because they have a ""Breaking News"" alert every 10 minutes."
NFLX up big after hours which proves that streaming is the future - and DIS will be a key player. Get on board DIS now or miss the boat.
Easy hold thru reopening. buy. hold. chill.
There is a dip every morning and then recovers.Someone is trading it everyday.
Not sure who would be selling the day before the historic launch. I'm not getting left out of this one. It will be the talk of masses tomorrow. Big subscription numbers to follow soon enough.
Im currently shorting Nflx and I really like to do my homework so I started to really research Disney..... I truly believe Disney will be the biggest player in streaming. I dont say this because I want to see NFLX take a hit. The content Disney owns is unreal...The deal for Fox net them so much content to their already massive library its scary. Then you think of how Disneys content is truly world class known across the globe. You think about how they own the majority of Hulu. Its mind blowing stuff. You talk to the average person they dont even know whats coming with Disney.
"""When you wish upon a star....."""
and why is everyone saying wrinkle in time is a flop. I meen have you actually seen the film yet?
"It was a bad day for Disney, but it did manage to nearly cut the losses in half off the -4% low. Futures are green. Maybe Disney can make a run back toward $144 tomorrow."
Looks like George Lucas won!! He could buy back the Star Wars franchise for half price....
I would pile into Disney when rest of stocks in red. China trade news shouldn’t affect Disney.
Is Disney channel available in overseas market like Netflix ?

Kudos to the fella who suggested I start using the mute feature. It's a lot easier to think when you filter out the daily and weekly news and focus on the long term. Slow and steady wins the race! 
I’ll be using this money to go to Disney 
"The question, after all these numbers being bantered about,is how many subscribers does Disney actually have. Disney has said that on day one they had 10 million plus, and they aren't going to report any more until the cc on earnings. The number by Apptopia is 22 million, but that is downloads, and that may not be the same because one subscription may lead to more than one download (as each subscription allows more than one user, and users may download on more than one device). And remember that Apptopia's numbers don't include those that subscribe through Disney+.I believe Apptopia has said that there were 200 million hours on Disney+ in the last month, while Netflix had 1 billion (I don't know if the exact same time frame is being used for both, as 30 days haven't really gone by for Disney+, but I'll assume so). But that doesn't mean that Disney+ is only 20% of Netflix (assuming each subscriber spent the same amount of time each device), as Disney had no subscribers at the beginning of the month - so if it had 200 million hours of use, that might be 400 million if they had the same usage per day for the month based upon the number of users at the end of the month. So that is 40% of Netflix - and since Netflix has about 60 million subscribers, that may work out to about 24 million subscribers right now. That is a tremendous number right now. And it will grow, particularly as Christmas creates more. I think you'll have about 35 million subscribers by January 1st. And it Disney reports a number as of the cc on earnings in February, I think you'll see about 40 million. That is a tremendous amount - and I think that will push Disney to reach about 175 in February."
going back to $150
What happened the Chinese not going to watch Lion King?
why does everyone assume that hulu will stay branded as hulu. do you think it would be advantageous to move it all under the disney+ brand? why does everyone assume there will be a bundle and not one awesome offering at low cost?
Disney land opens April 1st announcement made Monday
every article being posted has been positive for disney. no reason to sell. just add more!
"For the first time ever Disney will completely detach from fundamentals and become a speculative play, forward PE ratio could reach 100+ where netflix travelled to which could, though it sounds unfathomable, put Dis at a share price 500-600. I doubt they will release subscriber count anytime soon, but tomorrow will be the biggest single day % increase, I wouldnt rule out that they already have 10 million by tomorrow night. This is Disney guys, the Mandalorean alone will have 1 million viewers."
can someone tell me why disney is up over 2 in premarket trading. some analyst up grade??
My goodness those are impressive earnings!
"In an update to today’s earlier story, sources indicate that Disney has changed direction and has decided not to reopen the EPCOT Monorail line for the foreseeable future. Disney tested running monorails on the EPCOT line a few days ago, but it was ultimately decided that opening the EPCOT service would cause some physical distancing issues in places, mainly at resort monorail stations where space is limited as it is.Disney park visitors will be walking miles from the parking lot to the park in hot temperatures wearing masks"
All of these people are still trying to jump in front of the train. Just let it go down and see where the price settles. They essentially lost 65% of their revenue and who knows when it will come back. At the earliest people are hoping for a vaccine in October ? Then it's going to be another 1-2 years before they get 335 million people vaccinated in the US. What about the rest of the world ? They have 52 billion in debt and 6.5 billion in cash so at some point over the next 2-3 months they will need to draw down on their credit lines for more money. What is that going to do to their bond status. Then I see a lot of posts on here about Disney plus going to pull in tons of cash. Last quarter it was a sunk cost of 600 million and they projected due to infrastructure they were going to have to dump millions more and maybe even another billion plus. I would just wait and see on this as most of their business is dealing with people.
Soul and Wanda vision both put out . Easy 14 million signups. SOUL alone prob drove 10 million
What is wrong with Disney. Blockbuster hit after blockbuster hit. Disney parks making money hands over fist. Yet SP 2 points from 52 week low. Seems like Disney has been in its own Bear Market forever.
Just bought 400 more !
"I just made good profit on that dip. Weak hands can see the exit, while buyers come in for the easy beat."
See you at $200
"I love Disney stock but I sold all of my shares 2 weeks ago and don't plan to buy it again till the world gets a handle on the virus. I Dont care what the Fed will do because the bottom line is that nothing will start to go back to normal till the virus is taken care of. While you drip buyers keep buy on the way down & losing more of your money ,I will be sitting on the sidelines with my profits that I took when I sold 2 weeks ago. Right now is not the time to buy because we haven't even reached the bottom, time will prove that. I will be able to take full advantage of the bottom with me sitting on cash, therefore making the most out of this correction. People that say you can't time the bottom are either lazy or don't use common sense. The bottom will be so obviously in your face, when the U.S. has a handle on the virus the bottom has hit. That will be the time to buy. The dividend won't be enough right now to cover the downward trend of the stock price to keep your shares until the bottom. Drip buyers think that they are smart to hold & add while it goes down ,but the ones that sold & took profits are the smart ones cause they haven't lost anything & can buy at anytime with more money then the drip buyers. My predictions are that Disney will hit a low of $50 before the bottom. The U.S. is still slow on testing therefore all things will be slow for a while. More pain to come in the stock markets."
"I don't think DIS earnings will be as bad as everyone is expecting. Sports are back so that will help ESPN. Disney+ will help and parks are open. Yea, I know all the bad but DIS has hung in there that past month I think $118 is the price would not be surprised to see $118 after report."
4% up After hour!!! HAHA
"Imagine this. A more profitable Netflix, which owns the hottest content for children and adults living in their parents basement. Star Wars , marvel, alone will get 100 million subscribers , add in all Disney kid movies and shows, and you got 200 million. Add a slate of movies and shows and it will take off. Wanda vison already prob added 10 million to the platform alone not adding in when they do Loki show."
"UPDATE: Disney is off to a roaring start with 22 million mobile downloads3:40 PM ET 12/14/19 | MarketWatchThe app averaged 9.5 million daily active mobile users, landing the top spot on Apple's and Google's app stores"
"Very strong company with very low P/E.The price of the sock is fare.Easy easy day by day, each day climb up a little. When the Vix is high, disney stock rise. That can contonue for the next handerad years to follow."
"Could Disney #dis buy Roku soon??? The fact that they're launching Disney+ on almost every platform except Amazon's FireTV is very weird. Even though the market share of FireTv is not that big, Disney's CEO did say that he wants 90% of market coverage for this biggest service launch ever since he became CEO 2005 and to make Disney+ also available on FireTv should be very easy to do as well."

"I'm thankful that Disney closed up today and is now trading at 52 weeks high.However, when Roku came out with its recent disappointing earnings and its stocks dropped from 160 to 120 overnight ... immediately the ANALysts showed up and upgraded the stock. In a very short time Roku bounced back up to over 160.Disney on the other hand been coming out with nothing but great results (blowout earnings, over 10M Disney+ subscribers on first day, still over 1M daily, blockbuster after blockbuster movies, record box revenues) ... and finally one ANALyst came out today and upgraded the stock. Where are those ANALysts when we need them? Geez!!!"

"A lot of us are patting ourselves on our backs. We had a nice gain today. Makes up a little for the losses over the past couple of days. But stocks fluctuate. Yes, fluctuate. But don't sell yet.I am very strong on the long term nature of this stock. It will go down, and it will do up, and over the long term - 10 years, it will go up 5 - 10 times fold.But enough about the long term. I throw out the following short term scenario.Disney will give up a couple of points from today. Then it will come back, and hoover around 110 for a couple of weeks.But Disney will buy the Fox assets they want. There are simply too many economy of scales that will allow Disney to make more money. It gives them a ready stock of materials that will allow them to compete nicely with Netflix. And the Murdochs would rather own a piece of Disney than Comcast.That being said, when Disney announces the Fox purchase, it will jump about to 115. Then, some will also realize that Star Wars The Last Jedi is really another huge hit, garnering north of $1.6 billion, and also realize that Thor and Coco have garnered quite a few dollars - and we may breach 120. Then earnings will come out - another bump of $5 - we could well see 125 in February. And then we will see a slew of other movies and results that will give it a little more momentum. And when others see the ESPN app and the Disney app coming through, you will be seeing the upper 100's, and in about 2-3 years over 200. , I may be a little overly optimistic. I bought into Disney early in the 2000's, and bought in the teens. I saw some solid results, and then the drop in the fiscal crisis, a recovery, and then a solid rise from the mid 20's to the mid 120's. Then some leveling off, and even panic (remember the drop to 80 - I got in a little more then, and few other times at higher amounts). But when others complained, I felt this was no different when Disney was meandering in the 20's. And, if that is the case, we should see this go to the 500's at one point in the next 10 years."

They hit the pricing perfectly on Disney+ $6.99/month and there won’t even be a second thought for anyone with kids to buy the service. If it priced over Netflix I would have probably passed but at this price point it is a no brainer.
"For what it’s worth, I was there a couple of weeks ago. It was very crowded and all Disney hotels were sold out months in advance. The rooms that were $600 to over $1000 a night, filled months in advance. I’ve been going there for over 14 years now ( local) . Business is booming. I know parks are just one part of the equation but anecdotally, it was crazy busy. I’ll say 105 by Tuesday."
DIS seems to be picking up a contrarian vibe - te stock is down when the market is up. Today the market is down so this baby is up .... a pattern that has reappeared over the past few weeks.

"I think Disney's problem is when this whole pandemic started the theme parks accounted for 35% of there revenue. There doing well but at 51 times forward earning's it looks rich here. However, hope everyone one on this board knows who Ray Dalio is. On his last major interview titled Pandemic, China's rise he talk about why PE's don't matter in this market.

"got a 177 and a 175 targets and already 500 up, let's make a good cash run"
I spent a lot of time researching this weekend and came to a couple of conclusions.... Disney has grown in net worth over 60% in the last 6 years through acquisitions... It has used it’s profits to keep from leveraging the long term future of the company. Every acquisition has already returned profits back to Disney with the exception of Fox and the new streaming business  Disney allocates $800M in losses for Disney plus but with early adopters and pace of subscribers expect Disney to turn a profit raise guidance and be rewarded by expanding its multipleTwo things Disney needs to do to shore up its stock offer a stock split and authorize a stock buyback and we will see $200 imo
DIS should double or triple using p/e that NFLX trades at.
"Just bought some more, confident in this stock!"
When we will get a information about 10 millions subscribers? End of month or sooner?
we see 140 tomorrow? would be awesome to end the week on!
This beats barely moves NFLX does not and it went up almost 100 overnight????????
"If DIS closes green today, then there's a chance we could see this go up faster than I thought it would. If it's in the red again, then it's just the steady trend of climbing up in waves that I've noticed. We could hit as low as 105 and still be ok. That's the bottom of this wave."

Let’s crush through $120 by Friday!!
"A few days ago I said that, if DisneyPlus had 20 million subscribers by the end of the quarter (which Disney would announce in the Feb cc), it would approach 160, if 25 million - 165, if 40 million - 175. I also said that 40 million was possible. And I also said that, although official numbers would be issued by Disney until Feb, analyst numbers could move the stock price in the interim.Well, someone did come out with these numbers!!! And I think that 20 million is a given. 25 million very very likely (remember that the 15.5 number does not include subscribers from the DisneyPlus site). And 40 million still very very possible. The question I poise is whether you buy on the rumor and sell on the news? While we get some more numbers thrown around over the next few weeks, if we see Disney rise to 155, then 160, then 170, do we sell on the day earnings are announced (because they will only confirm the rumored released numbers??). As a long time long, I would not sell. Iger knows what he is doing. I've seen his meticulous mind. The only ""misstep"" is when he went on media about 4 years ago to tout Disney, particularly its movie revenues, and had to admit that cable was leveling off, and Disney ""leveled"" off. But he re-examined himself and Disney. Disney couldn't hold pat. Disney had to enter streaming, he decided. Not only did it represent the technological change media was entering, but it allowed Disney to realize the value of its immense library. Disney will not only make streaming a major money maker, but it will generate funds to buyback stock. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Disney will be 500 within 10 years - if not 1,000"
"Just finished watching ep3 of Mando. This series is awesome, buying more today."
Disney leaving California will be a huge boost to their top line. Florida offers so much more in talent and expansion. Bold move.
Streaming blowing up! Get long!
"Captain Marvel seems to be having a good second weekend. Doing a little better that the average Marvel movie for the second weekend. May improve a little more with the actual numbers (or do worse, but let's see). It may be doing better because it is drawing in more females this weekend, which bodes well for its legs and for Avengers Endgame. Let's hope. Disney will need the money because for all those Fox Shareholders that are choosing cash instead of stock."
"This is a buying opportunity.The reason this is a buying opportunity are the reasons it is being held back. First, the ESPN and Media Issues - Disney is turning this around, steadily, by putting together a real package. It will take 2 - 3 years to put it together.Second, is the Fox (and SKY) purchase. Comcast is attempting to compete. Disney made an offer 6 months (or so) ago, that was accepted and Disney is going through the necessary processes to get it approved. Comcast made an offer at the same time, but Fox decided to go with Disney, at least because Comcast refused to provide for a break up fee – a fee in case regulators decided not to proceed. That was Comcast’s decision. They cannot have it both ways. Fox would have to wait additional time if it decided (if it could) to go with Comcast at this time. Comcast tried to buy Disney about 15 years ago, and some might argue that they are still upset that they were rebuffed.SKY might be a different issue – Comcast is trying to make a late counteroffer. Disney may have to pay extra for this. But, if anything is proven by Comcast’s actions, it is that Disney is getting a very good deal.So, this is a good time to accumulate. It is going to make $7 a share this year. More next year, whether or not all falls into place. If it doesn't all go as Iger has it planned, Disney will be making $10 a share in three years. If all goes as Iger has it planned, it will be worth a lot lot more.So, accumulate"

Keep holding this one till at least Monday. Technical analysis suggests further bullish movement.
money cant buy you everything disney. quit disrespecting the people that made your company.
"Has Dividends be released yet? Look at past years, it may be possible for a Div increase. Please let me know what you think."
"nappy Friday Dis Fam! we made it through another crazy week in the market. Dis just needs a little momentum, and watch out! "
500k downloads on android so far
"Time to go to cash , Markets make no sense and that is when this end very badly for most"
Disney still has November 19th in 4 other countries..then...Europe..Going to $350.00
It's Disney time to shine today! Go Mickey!!!
So basically the reason the market is not pleased is that they expected Disney to have more info about their streaming service right?
"everything is down. tired of all the negative chatter. disney is closed. is that new news? so are all the restaurants, and the airlines, and the mom and pop stores. stay strong America."
Mid-160s before jumping higher? I didn’t like the volume today.Possible correction soon?
Anyone else notice a little buying near the close?
Woke Disney puts viewer warnings on the Muppets. The Progressive reign of terror rolls on...
Even in after hours up by 1.5% lol what a joke
We should see $300 in the next 2 months ...a beat will put DIS tomorrow @220 .Expected move is only $11 we may see 2X or 3 X that tomorrow or after hours .
I honestly see Disney stock growing a good 50% over the next 2 years. Once investors realize Disney is a tech play I see this stock going up pretty significantly. It can directly compete with Netflix with the robust growth in the world of monthly subscription market. The international potential in China is huge with disneyflix. Disney be able to offer ABC/ESPN/fox and insane amount of owned content. The best part is Disney is profitable with a PE of 16 compared to a Netflix 250 PE ratio.
"Frozen 2 over $1BStar Wars will break $1B 25-30M Disney + paying subscribers x 6.00 month $150M - $180M per month NEW revenue I see a long term trend here , I think Disney + is just getting started I don’t think it will be recognized in a few years as they add new content from their studios.... France and Europe coming on-line in March  let’s say 45-55m subscribers by Q1 2020"
Disney owns 66% of hulu and analysts not even talking about it.The subscription number should be DIS+ latest 24million + Hulu subscription 26.8millions.The Walt Disney Company(67% equity; full control)[2]Comcast(33% equity; silent partner)
Is it time to sell Netflix and buy Disney?
"they really are pushing the special content only on Disney+. it makes sense. The fans of this stuff are all about it. This will for sure get more subscribers. Its nothing I care about, but a huge group does!"
"ostias, va 198 !!!!"
"People forget , everyone use to take their kids to the movies and spend 100. You think they won’t spend 6.99-10.99 a month for all the content and movies like Frozen 2 and Soul. You guys are out of your mind. Forget the parks. Disney plus worth 300 million alone. Will be profitable in Disney plus by early 2022 if not end of 2021. No one is canceling, buy buy buy. Netflix and disney plus are a must for anyone. 20 bucks a month total. Disney should make a play for Netflix"
I think Disney should announce that they are closing their parks and docking their ships permanently - they may be able to get up to $200 a share LOL.
Stock riding on strong support at 182-183 should see a reversal back up soon
I got in at 147. If it goes down averaging down is the plan. Ready for a long ride. The Mandalorian is a surprisingly excellent series. I wasn’t expecting much from it. I’ve only had Netflix for at least seven years. Disney+ is a very welcome addition. I have an elementary aged kid that loves it as well. National Geographic is also a nice to have.Frozen 2 and the new Star Wars movie are coming out soon as well. I don’t know how much that will help the stock price. But I doubt it will hurt it.Subscriber numbers will be the drivers going forward.
Today will be one of the last great buying opportunities for DIS
This my next purchase I must have Disney. I bought a few shares a while back for my sons portfolio but I need a serious position badly.
"I keep buying the dip, 10k position now"
"Naturally, I was in this at 94 and sold thereafter. Back in now since they are opening the CA Disneyland end of April."
I love watching the desperation in PUT holders like Joe. When you own DIS you just sit back and wait. When you are trading PUTS against it ... you are rolling the dice... Will it go down 1%???? ha. Don't sweat the small moves and GO LONG! easy money long term.
I love how Yahoo deletes my comments for no reason. Endgame just went to $1.343 billion since its $1.2 billion on Sunday. Disney has been around ~100 years and knows what they are doing.
"Follow @DisneyPlus on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter."
"Honestly do not get this market. I guess the only stuff deserving of sky high prices and multiples are money losing, high debt ""transformational"" companies. Other than endless short squeezes and cultists, what has justified TSLA more than doubling in 3 months? Yes, NFLX has decent number but is still negative FCF and states they have to keep going into debt to feed the content monster. Meanwhile, DIS had 2 blockbuster movies in the last qtr, a seemingly successful streaming service rollout, new attractions driving massive crowds to parks, new cruise ships coming out, streaming to continue expanding internationally, etc etc and the stock has just been bleeding since last ER. DIS has multiple revenue streams. How many does NFLX have? (haven't seen any Stranger Things theme parks lately). Also, DIS owns the largest streaming service in India with approx 400 million subscribers. Why is this never mentioned? I am holding through ER but just very depressed. Everything going parabolic and the solid, profitable, sound balance sheet stuff I own does nothing but go down or sideways. Guess I need to find the next fad and hop on it fast."
Way overpriced
"Not only does Disney offer more than enough for the kids and family, but it also offers nostalgia for millennials all the way up to baby boomers !!!"
"Here Holland Disney+ went live today, i got a trial period of 2 months for free. It is what you expect of it. Disney movies, Marvel, star wars and Natgeo. Its running ok. Not much on there i like personally but for my kids its nice. Not sure if we will keep it after the 2 months. That depends on what and how many new shows and movies are added. But for a few months its ok next to Netflix."
"Tracking near term value of Disney stock just leads to emotional selling. Whether your average buy in is in the 130s, 90s, 100s, or evening the previous highs of 150s etc. you are safe in this stock. Just wait a year and watch your money double, triple, etc"
"They already lower the forecast earnings by 50% before Earnings. and Disney still managed to miss the lowered forecast by a shocking 40% on top of that, DIS is dead money not investable until it drops at least 20%-30% from current level."
Barron's - Disney is headed for 220 next spring.
The only green in my entire portfolio. 
"In Argentina, Toy Story 4 just broke the Opening Day and Single Day Admissions record with a unspeakable 417,955 admissions"
"Another point I will make as fact vs anything else is do people/investors have any real idea of just how big Walt Disney is in the family (hint kids) not just across America but throughout the world? To think of my grandparents being born after Walt Disney was formed in 1923 and growing up on the early animation, then my folks, me, our kids and so on tells/confirms to me just how much of a cult-like staple The Walt Disney has had and will continue to have as a trusted household name for grandparents, their grandkids, parent and their kids, etc. ....and now you factor in the media tech streaming-effect/factor = $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
speculators special
"I usually post about movies, but I have something a little different to crow about.At Comic-Con, Disney unveiled a series of different entries from Marvel onto their streaming platform. They are very impressive - because every Marvel fan will be intent on getting them immediately - which means they will need Disney+. Remember, Avengers End Game had an opening weekend of $357 million - that is about 35 million tickets. And at least one third will want Disney+. There may be families in these numbers, and friends that will share, but this is very impressive.Going back to the ""Movies"", one other commentator has said what I have said - I suggested that Disney doubled up on hit movies this year to lead into Disney+ --- Captain Marvel , Avengers, Aladdin (somewhat of a surprise blockbuster that will break $1 billion when doing over $600 million was a relief), Toy Story 4 (perhaps not the overwhelming blockbuster that some thought it would be, but it will be over $1 billion, and may be nicely over $1.1 billion - and where are you going to be able to see ALL four Toy Story movies??), and now Lion King. Granted, Mary Poppins Returns was not the hit some hoped for, and Dumbo was a not a winner, but if you don't swing for the fences, you're not going to hit home runs.Disney is already rebounding from its poor Friday. I'm hoping that it is over 144 by earnings announcement. And then I'm hoping that we have outstanding earnings, and some more clarification on Disney+ - this could propel it over 150. A good opening of Star Wars in Disney World will also help. As we approach Disney+'s opening, may be we can approach 160. And if we can hear good things, and a good opening, that may add some fever. The Conference call in November, with another blow out quarter and fiscal year end figures may also add some real momentumAnd then we will have a cc on earnings in Feb, where Disney will have to announce its streaming results. I think Disney+ will have at least 10 million subscribers by January, 2020. That means, in my opinion, real excitement, and a price approaching, if not exceeding 200 by February 15th.And then, watch out."
I think will hit $197
"Those call options was the problem for this stock, once it get burn then we will going up!"
Disney has fixed whatever glitch this morning. Been watchin Mandalorian just fine.
will wait till q1 numbers and sell off to get more
"I initiated a position and added to it this month. This should climb to at least 150 by the end of the year. They still have to deal with ESPN, but their films and parks are gold mines."
"I finally read the cc transcript. They had higher expenses on the Fox merger (about 30 cents more than the about 35 cents predicted), and disappointing results from Fox. They seem to think that the extended time for the merger hurt (at least compared to the Pixar and Marvel purchases). I think that the Fox personale ""phoned it in"" during the last 18 months or so. And Disney has its hands full with creating synergies and excitement in the Fox movie and tv divisions. Eventually, they will, although it may take a couple of to four years before we see real results from these divisions.Interestingly, Disney may have gotten a break on interest on bonds being issued. Disney had a special offering on Disney+ that ran through September 2 - $140 for three years - works out less $4 a month - compared to the $6.99 a month. I'm curious how many signed up??At the cc they announced that ESPN+ had about 2.8 subscribers - I was hoping for nicely over 3 million. Maybe football season will draw them in.Disney has some work cut out for it. I think it's still cheap. But, when there are some more bumps in the road with the China trade talks, you might see it cheaper - I'll be happy to wait it out, or simply stay with my holdings already."
charts are showing this stock is poised to breakout .....just sayin
Go Woke Disney? OK....Go broke
$350 millions and counting.... $1B post thanksgiving!!! Let’s go
Chinese goverment owns 57% of Disney in Shanghai.Why no media posts about possible delisting for Disney?
"Today I sold me Netflix shares with minor losses. I’m afraid this company is done. There will be more and more pressure from other streaming services (incl $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPL, $HULU, $GOOGL and other service). $NFLX is burning a lot of cash and the only strength they have is the number of subscribers which will decrease with the increase of competition/alternatives. More, today (the next day after Disney released their new streaming cheap service with great library!), Netflix announced increase of price [face palm]- I got an email. Last but not least, mostly, Netflix’s library of content is garbage - I have nothing to watch there. So, I do not see bright future for this company, but good luck to all those who are long here"
People are boycotting Disney in droves as they have become political with the political firing of Gina due to her conservative values. I expect this stock to fall like a rock.
"Disney market cap is 258 B, who could afford to buy? Impossible! No fishing dude~"
"Disney's Mkt Cap is about $344 B vs. Netflix $249B. Let's think about this for a second. It took Netflix close to 10 years to get to 60 mil subscribers. Disney Managed to do that in the first 6 months. Netflix currently have 200 mil subscribers at their valuation. Disney has this many subscribers between Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. They are predicting to be at $300 million by 2024 and likely will surpass Netflix in the next 2-3 years. Their valuation should be double if not triple that of NFLX. This stock should be at $500 if not $750 a share."
Disney to $300 in a year from today. You’re welcome
Come on Dis! . Let's lock in that 117.20 support!
"I bought DIS as my first ever stock at a cost basis of $112, I can't pretend I was expecting growth this high before Disney + subscription numbers begin to come out, that's when I'm expecting we see the biggest growth, hopefully a $200+ stock by early 2020"
"Not gonna lie, i did not expect 4 days straight in the green. That goes for ALL the stocks. I smell some BS floatn around though."
Bob Iger is resigning from Apple board. Not sure if it will have an affect on either stocks. But might be a cause for some movement on Monday.Any theories?
Disney is the greatest stock ever
Only sad thing about this climb is that I wanted to load on more cheap Disney :p
might hit $150 Monday or sometime next week after toy story 4 results.
My only green stock today. who would have thunk it...
"I have 133 calls that expire tomorrow, should have gone longer. do you think it will do well despite this now being a longer term story. Will roll them forward tomorrow"
"$200 by the end of day, strong streaming numbers"
"As a long time DIS shareholder I have to say there is SO much wishful thinking here:""Panther movie will move the stock.....""""Avengers movie will move the stock....""""ESPN+ will move the stock....""""Star Wars will move this stock...""etc....etc...NOTHING moves this stock at this point. Even earning beats barely move this stock. The only thing that will move DIS is a big game changer like a successful absorption of Fox and/or their own direct to consumer streaming service. Everything else is just BS."
Funny how D and Roland are taking turns ranting. It's as if they can't be online at the same time...similar to how it is when 1 person creates 2 accounts...hmmm...interesting.
"imagine Netflix with the licensing that Disney has, yeah that's exactly what Disney is going to be, easily $400 within the year"
"Lol. Never fails, Dis has a red day and all of a sudden every short jumps out of their whole with prophecies of doom and gloom.One Dis consolidates and starts ramping up pre earnings they will all disappear. Untill then,I'm just going to sit back and watch the folks playing the short game spin their game. Let's enjoy the show! "
I said the price of the buyout was already baked in. I was right.
Alphabet is bring bad vibes to the whole market. Will be a good day to pick up some DIS
"Well there is not sugar coating it, I got it handed to me today! DIS and BA disappoint big time. All my other stocks and mutual funds are green. DIS and BA are the only clunkers I have. Very disappointed....."
"Ok if you are long DIS here is what I want you to do, but only if you want to make money, sell all your shares after hours for whatever you can get and first thing when trading opens tomorrow short an equivalent amount."
Would Dis stock price have an impact on the upcoming SKY / Comcast auction?
140 forward PE
200$+ todayWe can do it
"At this point, I will start to sell...I think all the good news is baked into the price...i will still hold 25% of my position but will start liquidating after DIS crosses $200...there is just too much churn now. The only remaining catalyst that I don’t see baked into the stock price is DIS releasing their movies directly to D+. If they released Black Widow for $100, I would buy it. Having 3 friends over and splitting it would make it worthwhile and not paying crazy prices for refreshments means I would still save $ and I could watch the movie as many times as I wanted. Sometimes, I wonder if they should have a tiered system...4 weeks before release, $30,an additional incremental amount of money each week closer to the release date...secure the money early on but no idea how viable that plan would be. The only other catalyst would be the announcement of a split. I really thought they would last earnings day but they didn’t. Oh well..."
"Frozen, Star Wars, Disney +, all added up to a great quarter!! Disney + is so new and it’s one Stream parents can trust, growth potential is HUGE!!!"
Earnings were good in pandemic . I buy DIS herePossibility that it could see 196-200
Lion King is incredible. Very well done. This will do 2 billion.
"Be patient, there is no good news coming anytime soon. Things will only improve once a functional vaccine is administered in mass."
$147! New 52 week high folks. That is a easily verifiable breakout on heavy volume.
$170 after ER.
The FOX Business channel is reporting that Disney will be moving more operations from California to Florida. This will help the bottom line. Rumors continue about closing the California park in building one in Texas. My friends in Texas tell me that the China Virus was more or less a nonevent there.
Considering last year I was worried about Dis breaking under 105 and this year my worry is Dis getting back to 140+ I'd say I'm heading in the right direction.Short game must be very exciting and expensive right now. Good luck on earnings shorts.
I visited Best Buy on Sunday and there was a crowd of about 20 people all together asking how to get Disney+.
Argus Research $200 PT
was trying to enter this stock at at 105-108....what do you guys think?
low volume....
"Hotstar india streaming service which is owned by Disney has now more users than NFLX. One of my colleague was watching cricket on it today, something that stuck me was the live users watching was showing 5M. This is great for DISNEY"
I got Disney+ to watch Hamilton and then canceled my subscription (guessing I'm not the only one).
More downgrades coming...
La schools closed for the rest of year. What makes you guys think Disney will reopen
"The latest Star Wars movie caused some pause in the beginning of the week, as the weekend results was less than overwhelming - about 178 million, but still not a number over $200 million. And the reviews were less than wonderful.But a few commentators noted that the timing may have led to the numbers for the first weekend. And Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday' numbers were quite good. Tuesday, as Christmas Eve, is a poor day usually, but had one of the highest ever for such a day. And Christmas, perhaps the busiest movie day of the year, had the second highest ever. These are preliminary numbers (at least for Christmas), but still quite encouraging. This may have true legs. And, for what its worth. I liked it. I thought it was one of the best. Perhaps the best of this last trilogy. I think it satisfied traditional Star War fans, particularly the ones that did not like the last one, These may come back to see it again and again. Although it was a mistake that was difficult to see, they should have had the same director for all three of the last - JJ Abrams, although he may lack some originality at times, knew what this trilogy required, and either he or Disney dropped the ball in this regard. (the Russo Brothers proved that sometime you need the right person to take over a series and end it appropriately)."
Fix Fix Fix Missed by 500M top line and beats the bottom calling it cost savings or more like temporary layoffs and keeping hotels in the dark while shutdown. How can any of this be real????
Anyone else see Aladdin yet? I thought Will Smith did a great job. And he sang some music that reminded me of his time from Fresh Prince of Bel Air.
"Oh but the parks are going to open in April( oh, but they fired a great quantity of staff months ago, so who is going to be working? )Oh but there are plenty of new immigrants who can work the parks Management is everything, and DIS doesn't have it."
"Now that we've broken through the 139 resistance in the ""cup"" that's forming, the next resistance line seems to be 141. After that, we may just create a ""handle"" for the cup and it will be tea time all the way up! Happy Friday!"
"It seems that the big picture of the economy is still good. DIS jumped over 20% in less than 2 weeks that is a lot. It is the main reason of pull back. Give DIS another two months, the investors will forget that 140 is too high. i believe I will see around 160-170 at the end of 2019."
I just had a thought - I sure hope Disney is in talks with John Stamos for a Disney+ series or at least a movie! He's the biggest Disney fan as far as celebrities go. I wouldn't be surprised if he approaches Disney about it first!
We need a list of all the $50 stock price doomsayers. Anyone who said that have the cohonas to man up?
Why is Disney still trading below $150? Shouldn't it be trading above $170 with its BLOWOUT earnings? Roku would have easily. Not sure what people like about Roku ... not even making a profit yet and is trading higher than Disney!
Glad I bought in from yesterday’s dip. Great company and will always add on weakness.
"it is slowly recovering I guess it will hit -2% today and tomorrow will goes up more than 5%, tesla sellers will buy Disney now wait and see"
the acquisition of fox will make Disney unstoppable $200 will be here in no time
For the people who have Disney+ how’s the selection like? Hearing people are spending hours adding stuff to the watchlist!
Hold
WandaVision is different. Disney+ is going to be interesting and ballsy with Marvel
This drop has pretty low volume. It's barely even affecting the OBV. Should be up again soon. Has the potential to dip down to 141-142ish but I doubt it will.
New high today!!
BYE BYE COMCAST. DISNEY GOING TO WIN THIS BATTLE
Tomorrow is a new era. We got this longs!
"it’s looking like Disney is probably going to bundle its Disney+, ESPN+, and Hulu services at a bargain price. Basically, from what we know as of right now, the launch of Disney+ is going to be colossal.Positive responses from the media so far."
Disney is still cheap (P/E = 17.82) & nice cash flow. Netflix is not cheap (P/E = 131.02).A no-brainer; class dismissed.
"So with all this market volatility which was predicted last year and is true up to today. I believe we will continue to see this trend for the remaining of the year. The rest of 2019 would be the time to start buying on every dip you can and have a large hold position going into 2020. Disney has a great roadmap for the next 3-5 years with Galaxy Edge opening 2019, Disney+ 2019, Future park updates along with new hotels being built. Movies, star wars, marvel, pixel, Hulu, espn+, disney+, Fox. this is a very strong portfolio going forward. $200 stock price and beyond can easily be achieved. For the people that are negative and think being a bully on a message board is a way to change people’s thoughts about buying and selling. get a life. your negativity has zero impact on a yahoo message board. I will be buying this stock for the next 5 years and holding it. Good luck and May The Force Be With You!!"
with 50+ million verizon subscribers getting Disney+ for 1 year and disney saying they have 10+ on launch day. would that make it 60+ million subscribers already?
I read through DIS Earnings Call Transcript and an absolutely shocked that no analyst asked for an update on the closing the FOX acquisition. IGER just said they are waiting for a few remaining regulatory approvals.
How low can this thing go? Its like Disney plus never happened... Waiting to buy back in
DIS has been in a 148ish to a 144ish base since 11/12 with peaks to 153+ = not too bad since the pre-april streaming pop from 116 . . .
at $148.08 we are currently up $16.63 a share in just 1 month. i consider that huge gains considering we haven’t had an official earnings with Disney+. ill take $10-$15 a share every month for the next 2 years
"Since the semi-annual dividend has been suspended for both July ‘20 and January’21, it would be appropriate for the board members and company officers to likewise suspend their bonuses. If you agree, give it a thumbs up on this post."
Analysts will raise to 160
Anyone know why Disney is down the last few days? Haven’t heard any news that would impact it negatively ?
3...2..1... HAPPY MERGER DAY!!!
That was a crazy day. Looks like whole market volatility is here to stay for a while. Thankful that Disney is in a strong position currently.
$160 in two weeks!
"Team Disney.Nice gap on the VZ news, though shocked it did not continue the uptrend....the news should eventually add to our bottom line. Speaking of which....Place your bets. Earnings are getting closer (dividend as well:<). Where do you see Disney stock1. Day of earnings 2. Day after earnings 3. End of yearNow, the real reason for my post...pls name your favorite meal/snack at Disney World good luck trading"
Price after earnings guess? I’m going with $80 immediately then slow downhill roll to $65.
Overvalued I’m waiting for it to correct before getting in
"picking up a couple of shares here a couple shares their it's about the future price of the shares the price for picking them up now at is in material, the homeworks been done we're confident with our investment and the future looks bright, next on the agenda 2 for 1 stock split"
"If there is just a smidgin of doubt, a little bit of uncertainty in this call... this will drop so fast. It’s not all about what they did last quarter. People need to pump the brakes with all these numbers."
Fantastic day. Will probably give back some tomorrow
When Covid is by bye
good luck every body
"Disney, Netflix, Roku were all down today. money was probably shifting out of streaming into tech. money will come back overflowing in the next couple months leading up to Disney+. Disney is easily a $200 stock end of next year."
How can you tell when a company is really doing well? How can you tell when they truly are profitable? THEY PAY A DIVIDEND.
"Very positive call... they talked about growth in most aspects of the business and have baked in downside for CoronaVirus for 2 months of closure which is very unlikely. This means that next quarter, it should be a big upside when the virus impact is much less."
"So Disney about to have another 1B movie come out, they have theme parks, hotels, restaurants, cruise ships, streaming service and their licensed characters are on everything from food to diapers to toys to clothing to band aids, etc. etc. and the stock goes down while NFLX goes up. Yep, makes sense. As more companies pull licensed content from NFLX the cash firehose will have to keep flowing 24/7 to keep up flood of original content (with no other ancillary sources of revenue unlike Disney). As the saying goes, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."

Disappointing price action. Wish I understood what's holding this stock down.
Let’s just says if this stock goes down to 100 dollars in 30 days then I win 1 grand!!!!!!
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/disney-gains-as-analyst-reinstates-coverage-with-a-buy-14914249
"As soon as DIS starts to do streaming. It will be a new page of DIS stock. DIS will not be an entertainment stock again. Watch out, DIS can do a lot of things with so many channels. Ads may be one of them, and very high profit margin."
Are you kidding me Roku shares up 16% and upgraded because of streaming platform? Come on DIS get moving!
"One thing that I have learned after 30+ years if investing------Never listen to what an analyst has to say, because they always have an agenda."
Anyone else think this is one of the most undervalued stocks as far as Blue Chips go in Market Cap? 250 Billion for this company is really low.
Stocks do not trade based on current earnings they trade on future earnings. Disney shall be fully open for business sooner than later and the accelerated Disney+ subscriber numbers will accelerate future earnings and thus the stock price.
This will be over 200+ in the morning
200 or back below 190 tomorrow.
"I'll buy more if this dips under $100. This is super bargain territory. When covid is gone, this will go back up. Mandolorian and Baby Yoda will see to it."
What happens when they go internationally? Think about the revenue? 10 mil subs just in the first day in the US! What happens when they decide to raise the price to 9.99 or even 14.99? People will pay it. The growth potential is huge.
Got a little bruised up after hitting the 200$ wall a few times. Will recover some energy and try again soon :-)
Any news of restoring the Disney divvy?

The best thing about Dis vs nflx is that 99% of their content has been bought paid for and already turned a profit
One of the big problems with Disney is thier leftist political stance. Smart companies stay neutral and avoid politics and tenuous popular trends.
"Looks like 50M+ and a global prediction of 137M-155M for the opening weekend of Dumbo, the numbers are kind of all over the place. This is the first of the four animated adaptation scheduled for the year, the group should do well. I’m really looking forward to the release of Endgame in April, will see it the second week; Disney has an impressive lineup for 2019. I’ve been buying in the $106-$108 range (RSI neutral range below 42 or so) for our retirement accounts (long hold) the last few weeks. Interesting time to be investing in the media group, I’m probably a little heavy on the sector right now but have positions in sne, disca, t, cbs and lgf-a. P.S. I hope that sports wagering (some form) won’t be a lost opportunity for Disney. Maybe initially focusing on 2 or 3 of the major championships and March Madness? Any thoughts! Good luck & great investing!"

"Giant ratings agency Moody’s Tuesday outlined the massive financial hit Disney is taking in the current coronavirus pandemic but said the company has enough cash to weather the disruption.“No change in ratings or outlook (at this time). Liquidity reins supreme,” said Moody’s SVP and lead entertainment analyst Neil Begley.He said Disney has a total of $12.25 billion of revolver capacity, presently undrawn except to backstop its outstanding commercial paper, It also has a sizable cash balance. That’s more than enough to cover bond maturities through the end of the fiscal year of about $2,4 billion. “We also expect the company will endeavor to control costs, delay capital expenditures and pay significantly lower taxes for fiscal 2020.”"
Disney has an easy figure this earnings compared to the previous quarters....
a few days ago we were struggling to pass $132. look at it now. Beautiful!!
"The Murdock’s, Bob Iger and Trump/DOJ want DIS to acquire FOX. This whole saga may play out a little longer....but think of what the DOJ can do. Challenge CMCSA bid and drag that process out for well over a year. DIS can close its deal for FOX much quicker once shareholders vote."

Why do you see the stock decrease? It is the streaming wars with who has the best content. You really want to bet on management that has no experience with this. Check out AT&T and how well they did. They way overpaid for Hulu. They should have dumped Hulu.
Higher higher
Is this going up after Star Wars release
What happened this week? We broke $115. Hit @$115.80 high Friday and Monday AM. Now we can not hold $113? I do not see any news that justifies the move. Keep hoping they will finalize Fox purchase. It seems issues in Brazil are getting resolved. Any ideas why the stock is getting hit so hard this week?
"earnings beats and forecast exceeds. $180 by January 1, 2020"
I am new investor. Just saw reports and Disney New price target set at $71.32. I bought it at 109. Do I need to sell it before suffering loss? Heard lot of good things about Disney 6 weeks back with expected opening in July. Don’t know where to go from here. Patience or just let it go? Suggestions will be highly appreciated. Thanks!
I just saw the Rise of Skywalker and was thoroughly satisfied with the end of the series. Once again for me Adam Driver stole the film and finds his place as one of the key characters in all 9 films!
Uncle Warren may be have been and will be BUYING !
Wheres all the peeps saying Disney is not going to go below $90? I want to see you all in these comments starting monday ;)
All long term investors need to stop worrying about short term movements in DIS stock price! Why is it down after hours? It’s down almost 2% today...why? This is an exciting and probably once of a lifetime transaction to acquire broad and diverse set of assets from FOX. There may be a couple of tough years from EPS standpoint but buckle up because I believe DIS is well positioned for superior long term gains! Don’t doubt Bob Iger...he is the best in my book!
Why the big fall from $153.41inside of 2 months during a DOW run-up time frame?
"Earnings beat coming. Wouldn’t be surprised to see $200. Stay the course, know what you own."
"Slight pullback today...that's normal. Eight days until ""Frozen II""....those opening weekend numbers will send it flying again."
I love Disney Land
The only company reporting Q on a Thursday - Friday to pop up!! $130 - $150 for a Xmas rally!!!
It is astonishing that anyone would sell Disney now.
Disney looking strong again on another bad market day.
Not very exciting week for DIS. But that is okay for long term holders. It also sets up a better scenario for next weeks report.
Hold for tomorrow or sell?
"When is Disney Land opening? oh look @ the ACRX chart, thank me later!!"
"Interesting press headlines claiming that Disney ""sold out within minutes"" for Shanghai reopening. A quick fact check: - Disney can reopen at 30% capacity, so 24000 people - ""CEO Bob Chapek said during an earnings call Tuesday that the park would initially operate well below that capacity and then ramp up to reach that 30% cap over the course of several weeks."" So maybe they will try to sell 15 000 tickets?- Disney's reservation website: All dates available for half day passes (including May 11th). All dates except May 11th and 12th available for full day passes. - Disney knew park sales would be scrutinized for reopening, so I'm sure the amount of ticket actually available for sales was very limited to give that impression of high demand. https://www.shanghaidisneyresort.com/en/tickets/shdr-half-day-dated-ticket-with-meal/That nuances"
"Hearing that Iger will appear on CNBC after bell seems pretty bullish (who would go on knowing earnings were bad or needed some serious explanation for?) Iger was all over the media prior to last ER, which I found quite bullish (and it was) Sadly, DIS gave back much of the prior ER pop over last 3 months despite a spate of blockbuster movies, D+ growth, theme parks overflowing, etc. Hopefully his planned appearance portends great numbers (including great D+/bundle numbers) and stock will take off and stay up. I never thought I would see TSLA explode like it has and Disney is in need of some overdue wall street love as well"
What Disney really needs to work on is the Disney+ app. Who the heck wants to sign up two services Hulu and Disney?￼ why not incorporate Hulu with Disney+ on one real time app so it’s not so difficult to switch between apps and then charge what Netflix charges. I think it’s convenient and they may not half to maintain two different types of software it will all be easy and cost less. ￼
$150+ after the blockbuster ER. IMHO
Top pick on BNN Market Call tonight. Disney+ hasn’t even launched in Europe or India and has more subscribers to date than forecast.
"Betting against Disney long-term is the closest thing to personal finance sabotage I can think of. Bet against Disney +, I dare you........"

Alright folks I'm taking bets! Green or red today? who's in?
"After June 24th, no reservations needed for Star Wars Park. , gates will be unleashed.....(reminder, initial reserve tickets sold out in a matter of hours.)"
All parks closed Disney up
One thing I can state as a rare fact on this board is that DIS has held a solid $20 pop/gain since early April or approx. a 20% gain since that time to form a very solid base of investors at these levels. With that said I would be just as cool with another solid 20% pop and base from here come the launch into EOY/holiday season or a $160ish level ....yep
$110.75 to $111.25 tomorrow on this and they know it
Why are we down today?

Too many dismissing Park revenue - Its not back but earnings will show its on the way.
"Disney, hulu, ESPN package is looking really good right now?"
Just stopping in to point and laugh at Roland/Tim/Ulrich.
"We had a good week. I'd like to think that the Lion King's opening was the catalyst, but more likely the dip under 140, and anticipation of the streaming (including the excellent Comic-Con presentation of Marvel's streaming entries).Lion King may just be a little more front loaded - this week it may be optimistic that it will break $80 million (initial predictions of $95 million have faded). But please don't be disappointed - Toy Story, Aladdin, and even Avengers keep marching on. We will have a nice quarter announcement in August, and then in November. The interesting key for the November earnings announcement may be Ad Astra - Brad Pitt's movie done under Fox - it was moved out of May, and Disney may have a big roll in testing its promotion abilities for this type of movie. Just like Aladdin which surprised some (coming out of the rough Memorial Day Weekend) and cemented this past quarter, Ad Astra is coming in September, a month Disney has not had success, and can make the last quarter of the fiscal year wonderful."
If you are a short term trader you may be able to make some money over the next couple days. I am not. I am holding DIS forever and giving the shares to my kids some day. I am buying on all substantial dips. DIS will still be a powerhouse a long time from now despite the enormous short term headwinds. As always they are managing the company responsibly in a very tough time. Good luck to all.

Disney stock was downgraded to underperform and the price target was lowered to $105 a share from $107 at Imperial Capital
quiet board this morning. oh wait. it’s from all the people i have muted 
Green today. I feel it.
good week for Dis. hopefully everyone now realizes $5 price jumps dont just happen overnight. ideally we continue the climb next week :)
"How Disney handled the sell-off today, considering the Disney closures, and the market over reaction to the virus in my opinion is a very bullish sign. Earnings should be great great place to be holding  see y’all at 150 in a week or 2!"
"as of this moment, Disney is top DOW performer today"
Overvalued? I don't care if they reopen to 125% of previous capacity......earnings do not support this.................looking to short when it hits $200.
"Good afternoon. I'm new to this board and looking at taking a position in DIS. I'm not delusional in thinking that Disney + is going to topple NFLX, because NFLX is too embedded in people's lives at this point. However at $5-$8/month I can see 100+ subscribers within 12 months for Disney. Can this stock be in the 120s within 12 months of the launch based on 100 mill subscribers despite NFLX still growing? I don't see the streaming service space as a winner take all. Disney+ would make a great ancillary service (especially for $5-$7 month) to current NFLX subscribers. Thoughts?"
"$160-$175 soon, once Corona plays outExpenses were high this quarter and they still beat on earnings. Unbelievable company"
"Sold half, always play with the houses money whenever you can."

"98 shares are available for sale at 120.95, any takers?"
Just casted my vote for the Fox acquisition! Let's do this Disney!!!
"Regardless of stock price, Disney+ is freaking awesome out of the gate. I was worried the interface would be clunky, but it's beautifully laid out. They definitely took a lot of inspiration from Netflix's interface which I'm fine with. Disney should be proud."
"Disney + DID NOT GER HACKED!! ""Hackers"" basically had the passwords of several users from other apps. The fact that the users used the same password for all their apps, banks, etc made it easier for the ""hackers"" to access to the accounts. In this case, there is absolutely nothing Disney was able to do. It is like saying that it is Apple's fault if someone steals your Iphone"
DIS Only down from Quant traders. In sync with NFLX and ROKU!
Indexes are all down. DIS has been trending with the Dow all day.
"This stock really tests your patients . Dis is crushing it on all fronts .. box office , merchandise, streaming, theme parks and franchises... everything they’ve touched lately turns to gold .. this stock is heading to the moon ... it may not happen for a few months but I believe sooner rather than later it’s going to take off"
Can someone explain to me what causes these 10+ dollar jumps like from previous close to the morning open the way it did at like 130 dollars at 9:30 am???
Goldman to Buy ratting DIS Price Target up to $142.
200 tomorrow.
Lots of good news this week with more to come. For most of Disneys lifespan they have been single digit to low double digit growth so it’s going to take time for the analysts to get their heads around a company growing this fast... I have complete confidence Disney beats earnings this quarter and the subscriber counts will help analysts rethink forward guidance. I’m happy to see 165 by February. 175-200 if numbers break 35M imo
"Get woke, go broke!!"
"Disney, in 1-2 years will be the type of investment that people will say, ""I wish I had bought it 1-2 years ago."" If you wait for all the parks and cruise ships and movie studios and TV/cable operations to return to 100% functionality, you will have missed the boat."
good comeback!
"Another movie Disney released yesterday was ""Togo"" on Disney +, their streaming service. It has a 94% on Rotton Tomatoes, 98% approval of viewers.I just finished watching it and have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am NOT an animal person to say the least."
earnings trade: buy disney at open sell tomorrow at open. buy sono tomorrow and sell it friday at open.
"With OTC direct to consumer growing sales and increasing margins, even with a simple $8.50 earnings in the next 12 months at 17 times earnings puts DIS at $145/share. DIS is adding a ""Netflix type"" distribution component except with the best possible content catalog. DIS stock and margins will explode as DTC rolls out. How is this not a strong buy?"

"$DIS Top 5 box office movies of all time: 1) Avatar 2) Avengers Endgame 3)Titanic 4) Star Wars Episode 7 5) Avengers Infinity WarAnd Disney owns Fox, Lucasfilm, Marvel and other companies, this means that 4 out of 5 biggest box office movies are made by Disney.Soon cinemas are open, soon we get more movies and Disney owns it all. Basically Disney owns Star Wars, all superheroes (except DC), Indianan Jones, Avatar etc. And diden't Disney own Discovery and sport channels as well? And Disney just started with Wandavision, first superhero series. And they already have 100+ million people who own Disney Plus. Now they make 20 new series every year. If Covid-19 diden't happen, Disney stock would be 300$ right now. But soon Covid-19 is over and overtake Netflix as well."
"if, say, me or someone with big bucks were to buy 1000 shares of the Walt Disney company's publicly-traded stock today for $141/share, what difference would the volatility mean/make to me or that someone say, in 2024/25 if I or that someone was to awake from a ""coma"" to their brokerage account if I or that someone was an investor in the company aka a true long-term shareholder is the ultimate question vs., say, someone who is just looking to make a few bucks here and share over the short-term as some form of day trader and regardless of them being a novice - advanced level short-term day trader? Joe posts because he simply does not care about the company as a shareholder vs. him rather being someone who just looks to make the short-term trades/gains. My advice is if you can truly afford to be a long-term shareholder, trust the company and the facts aka numbers and just leave these boards to the short-term players and clowns who simply show their character in life on a public message board while hiding behind a cyber identity. Summary facts moral to this story: either you are long-term or short-term in/out long/short calls/puts < eom > be well, se/usnswc"

Why is it up?
I bought Dis when it was $35.

The stock was previously pushed up ... now the air is out and it collapses like a house of cards

If Trump can agree to a Phase 1 real which will postpone the tariffs that are supposed to come into play this Sunday. And Star Wars dropping on the 20th. I see that the stock can be above $153 by the end of the year.

Approximately 18 million shares currently short wondering how much of a squeeze we are going to see going into the long weekend. I see a lot of investment coming based on E/R as well as parks and cruises opening by the summer vacation season along with greater subscriber numbers.
$116 end of week
Seems like a sell the news mentality has infected earnings reports like a cancer. This thing is a money making machine but still dropped after great numbers. I expect a better week starting on Tuesday since monday is closed.
Even NFLX is green
Watching some NBA practices now at Disney. Every team has arrived to prepare for the season beginning July 30th. Parks open today. Disney plus numbers will be amazing and still has not been introduced in parts of Europe and Latin America. Exciting times ahead for this company.
I’m new to the stock market. Is now a good time to buy Disney shares?
DIS has been trading flat for a month. In 3-4 weeks when earnings are released this will get a HUGE Price Increase.
"with FOX acquisition, watch out Netflix. In a few years there will be a new king in streaming services. I feel bad for the holders of Netflix when that happens. Buy Disney now and thank me later."
Dis should be up more today. I’m surprised it’s struggling pre market
I guess Disney has to come up with some wield dream crypto coin move forward. Solid telegraphed plans don't work In a crazy market.
"Anyone who buys in front of the numbers at such prices is really brave.Results will be released after the close of regular trading on August 4, 2020."
I had to sell some shares with this pop. I had 6000 shares and wife says that was too much. So I sold 4000 shares and kept 2000. Dont be mad at me. I may buy some back later on any dips and not tell her.
Nice to see a message board with no shorts trolling around. They no when to pick their battles. This is one they can't win
I love how all these analysts are late to the party with their upgrades. They talked about ESPN for YEARS ignoring every other positive Disney marketing channel and got left out on this massive upswing. I’m not saying there isn’t room left to run but the name of the game is buy low sell high...duh.
We bought our Star Wars tickets this past weekend and the guy at the theatre said all 20 of their screens will be showing the movie starting every 30 minutes. He said first few shows were nearly sold out and that they had never seen such early sellouts 5 days prior to film release. This is going to be a record setting weekend for Disney! Next Monday shares will fly!
"For those who take account of this, Aladdin had another very good weekend. It is nearing $725 million worldwide - after 3 weeks plus one weekend. If it had no competition, it would hit $900 million. But it is running into Toy Story. But these are really nice numbers. I believed that Disney was ""hoping"" $750 million. That will be exceeded before the weekend starts. And maybe Toy Story won't hurt much. Like Avengers End Game gave Captain America a little bump, maybe Toy Story will give Aladdin a little bump."
"I think it will be very profitable to have people pay a monthly subscription to have Disney promote their movies, merchandise, parks and future income streams to their very own customers. Outside advertising could also be huge if they go after those advertisers."

See you guys under $100 soon
Revenue up 7% over prior period.Damn good
"I’m completely disgusted by what Disney has done, but I gotta say, money is money"
"I'm holding. Might take a while to go up, but it will eventually. I'm in no rush."
We will likely get some updated subscriber numbers released tomorrow.
1000 dollars in 2024.
People don’t realize Disney has been a loaded spring since earnings. Trump Mexico tweet muted its upward trend.
While I am bullish long term for the market I am not sure an argument for $106 can be supported for Disney. They will have the hardest time regaining revenue traction. The average company will take 1 year to regain traction and Disney may take 5 years. I see it going to $80 just on a relative valuation argument.
By the end of the year after the vaccine price over 300$+
I bought more yesterday. I guess I should have waited until today to buy more.
"There will likely be more studio consolidation. The best remaining targets are Sony, MGM, Lionsgate and STX. Curious to hear thoughts on who might buy each of these studios. I think the buyers could be DISNEY, Comcast, Time Warner, Viacom.....or maybe Netflix, Amazon or Apple. I still believe Apple should acquire Netflix."
When does Disney double anyone have a calculated guess. When does it hit $230.00
"Holding $TSLA, $BABA and $DIS for 10 yrs. Good luck to all!"
"It's hilarious that conservatives threatening to boycott $DIS. They will not succeed as long as they have kids, and most likely, liberal kids."
Disney and TWTR - is that enough news to move this to $120 anytime soon?
AVENGERS SMASHES THE RECORD TO HIT 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS. DIS will pop up 3-5 points when the market opens on Monday morning. I will hold until DIS reports earnings on May 8. I bet on it because DIS just raise the ticket price at DISNEYLAND HONG KONG.

"I’ve been to Disney springs, Disney parks and Disney mall stores and I’ve seen ,with my own eyes, mobs of people buying Disney merchandise. Disney is on fire right now ! Their movies are breaking box office records and now their streaming service is about to be unleashed. This stock should be soaring right now"
"Lately I've noticed I've been losing my cool when reading some of the nonsense posts by shorts.Im reminded that one of the best ways to deal with anger is gratitude.Im grateful I jumped on the Dis boat when I did.Im grateful for the longs on this board that encouraged me to stop playing the short game and actually learn to invest.Cheers folks! Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That's why it's called present. "
Why would anybody bet against a Disney streaming service loaded with billion dollar franchises lead by the ultimate media king.
is this a good entry to buy for longterm investment?

How on earth is this still $95 when this virus will destroy almost all parts of this company for at least 2 full quarters? I love Disney but this is trading on its name - not fundamentals or reality.

thanx disney sold at 150 ..love disney ..will b bck wen it come down to 136 to 138 ...jumped in tgt ......tgt is a great stock ..earning nxt week
can't believe ppl sold shares after the beat on the quarter. just put it in the account and don't touch.
last 5 days and 1 month has been consolidating. next run to $140 coming sooner than you think!
netflix is ok but they don't really do anything of really high quality except I did like ozark
NFLX cap is at $125 so for my a$$hat analysis if disney + realizes it's full value - I'll give it a conservative addition of another $100 bill to the cap which makes the stock at $185. Thoughts ?
"Once upon a time after a stock reported higher than expected earnings, the stock price would increase."
Gap up 215
"I am not one to jump on the latest fad. My investments are based on price, earnings, dividends and growth. I bought a big chunk a few weeks ago at 112 dollars per share. At the time it represented about 5 percent of my portfolio. In hindsight that was too conservative. I’m selling several other stocks to allow me to boost that to 20 percent."
"All 3 guys on fast money CNBC are saying don't buy it, wait for it to drop to close the gap, or if you buy it today you will regret. Because all there are of the same view you know the stock will go a lot higher. They always try to talk down a stock when it has a big up day but never worked."
"BURBANK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Walt Disney Company (DIS) Board of Directors today announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.88 per share, payable January 10, 2019 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 10, 2018. The Company last paid a semi-annual dividend of $0.84 per share in July."
Is this for real?
"Give me the option to bundle Disney+, Hulu LiveTV, ESPN+, and the ability to convert my DVD collection to be stored in the cloud (similar to VUDU) including the option to purchase other non-Disney movies to add to my 'digital library'. Having this all available under a single seamless app would provide a better user experience when finding what to watch. Users would still have the option of picking just Disney+, or just Hulu with ads, etc. But they wouldn't need to download a new app for each and would make users more willing to try out all options. Maybe call the single app Disney Digital or something similar. I'd be willing to pay $55-60/month for a bundle like that. I'd probably still keep Netflix around just for a couple of shows that we enjoy watching, but may consider canceling if the quality of shows don't get better. Especially if I would have the option of buying digital copies of Netflix shows/movies and adding that to my digital library. Just my 2 cents on the potential I see with Disney and streaming. I'm rather new to investing still, so don't have a lot of skin in the game. But Disney seems like a safe long term investment at this point. I'll look to add to my Disney shares as I find more funds available and see buying opportunities."
Massive closures at Disney stores. Americans are boycotting the woke bigoted company.
One of the main reasons why Disney will trounce Debtflix is because the House of Mouse already has the content.
This movie has too sell out this weekend to get a pop Cridics said flop same as Marvel but we know how that turned out
Back up to 112.50 today! Then down to 112 the day after. Rinse and repeat.
GO DISNEY
Im in my seat - wife went to get popcorn. Go time soon!
it’s coming
relax it will be ok
"i am @102.32,"
"Disney is a phenomenal company . Making all the right moves, acquisitions, movies , parks and streaming . I love their vision . Great leadership and yet the stock won’t budge an inch ... painful"
DIS higher after Iger’s interview tomorrow’ morning on CNBC
"Got in yesterday @ $139 even, because I liked that they were getting into streaming, and thought it would rise over the next few weeks or months based on that. Today's pop on earnings was a gift I could not resist, so I sold in the last 10 minutes, with a $10 per share gain. Thank you, whoever!"
"I'm a little more optimistic about Disney's balance of movies for the next 6 weeks. I checked the Hollywood Stock Exchange, that tries to set a bar for the first 4 weeks, And Aladdin is at about 250 million and Toy Story at about 340 million. I am worried about Disney's poor streak during Memorial Weekend, and some weariness on the Toy Story franchise. This seems to put my mind a little more at ease. If Dumbo had been a nice little hit, you'd be looking at some quarter!!!!"
Disneyland is going to reopen soon. Looking forward to hover around 190 by EOY. Hold em if ya got em.
"A better day, my girl's loved Black Panther."
Notice the consolidation a few days before earnings? Even the shorts know what is coming. They will get quieter in the coming days as they cover. 4 days till liftoff.
"We all know this is going to the moon next year... it should just hurry up and start heading that way.No hesitation for me, personally... I have Hulu and 3 young kids. Disney+ (& Hulu) will be happening for me, and Amazon Prime & Netflix are more in danger of being cut from my budget than Disney+ would be. I think many are in the same boat as me."
I imagined this going differently in my mind LOL
"we weill hit $160 by the end of year easily. Frozen will smash all records next thanksgiving weekend. Next month we have Star Wars and then earnings in January. We will get a clear number of Disney+ subscribers. I wouldnt be suprised if we hit 25 million by January. In March Disney+ will be released in England,France Germany Spain Italy. those 5 countries alone I can see another 15 million subscribers combined. We are talking 250 million living in those countries combined. I see France getting the most since we have Disney Park in Paris and they advertise inside the park."
"Called it perfectly, made some option money as well."
Light bulb finally went off in people’s heads...if Netflix is killing it and Disney + is getting a huge amount of subscribers in a matter of months that took Netflix years to do...Disney plus will be as big as Netflix by itself. Getting this stock under $500 is a really good deal 
I think DIS runs up tomorrow if it's an up day. It got cut short today by whatever was weighting the market down!
Dis adding companies like.....
On Disney plus  $DIS
Would it be a good time to get in now? However I could only buy 22 stocks. Is it worth it?
DISNEY & FOX DONE DEAL
Be honest shorts... Who thought Dis was going down today only to get creamed by new highs? Rinse and repeat. 
Wow..Disney skyrocketing after hours. 
"The deal by Disney today puts Disney streaming service closer to mirroring Netflix. The big draw will be everybody with children( + grandparents) will have to buy the service. If you remember in the early day's of cable TV the Disney channel was an add at the cost $10 for one channel. They now have covered all the bases.....toddlers, little kids, teens and adults. Something for everybody! Did I forget to mention sports?"
don’t be fooled by the after hours. this will surge tomorrow.
"Let me ask all the shorters and bashers of Disney and the markets a few questions.So if the market gets turned into rubble and all the federal, state and corporate employee pension plans get turned into rubble along with it what will our economy and country look like?And understanding the federal reserve and other central banks will do everything in their power to prevent the markets from turning into rubble which direction do you really expect the markets to go?And if the federal reserve and central banks fail in their efforts to prop up the markets it will only be after tens of trillions of new liquidity is pumped into the economy. At that point what will be the value of your fiat currency profit that you managed to make off of a failing market and economy? The answer is fiat currency will be worthless. The federal reserve and central banks, if necessary, will inject tens of trillions of dollars into the markets and economy. They will not allow deflation to occur. Cash will become worth less and less during this process. Disney is an iconic American company. The Mouse is the most recognized symbol of America even more so than our flag, George Washington or Washington DC. It will not be allowed to fail or even suffer excessively more than the overall market."
"so there is a rise in coronavirus cases in South Korea and there is a great fear in a second wave. so yea I f South Korea argually the country that has handled this whole pandemic the best, sees a second wave than the USA will almost be guaranteed to see one as well. I will be buy this when its value makes sense to what the current situation actually is for Disney. i mean yea i may miss out and this may double before it goes back down to where it was but there is too much uncertainty not being priced in."
I got in Mickey Mouse make me proud!!
Long term Disney shorts are in over their heads. How he likes to claim Disney won’t beat the S&P 500. He is living in the past. With Disney+ this Stock experience hyper growth. The reaction on Friday to the quarter was completely wrong and I have no clue why hedge funds are trying to short this. Some may argue it’s already at a premium but much for the future upside is still not yet discounted. Even if some of reopening is priced in The run is far from over and anyone with a brain can see that.
Havent paid attention to near term pricing since buying at $90 a year ago. I know major growth is ahead.
"look at the vol over this past week and know that this is a classic base forming here. those long are in tight while others out looking to short/trade will only do so on any next news event thus creating the next run/wave in volatility. if i'm a trader i simply cannot make a living sitting/waiting on movement because my income depends on it now; thus why good traders always rotate stock in/out of their, say, starting lineup to trade based on pure volatility/volume."
Not looking good
It’s a Mickey Mouse Miracle Ladies & Gentlemen..... GREEN
On the board. The rocket is leaving soon.
hello i bought 1 share
"Funds are slowly unloading this before earnings, so obvious and retail arw buying. GltaInflated to 190 to allow for a drop back to 175."
HULU news has to be a positive matter of time before this stock takes off.....
$125 next!!!
"Don’t know why people come to these board to make predictions, i.e. DIS is going down because of this or of that. Long investors don’t care about short term. When you hear good news you buy and sell as stock price goes up. For example I would buy 2000 shares and start selling 200 shares at a time when DIS hits $115. Set a goal or price target and stick to it even if you will leave money on the table. I bought DOCU at $103 and started to unload 100 shares at a time as it goes up. I left nearly $5k on the table but no regrets as I also made money."
Stock is only up 33% on the year stop trinkling down Disney!!! I wan't 50% gains!! Feed Me Gains!! MEOW!!!!
"Feels like a coiled spring, just too many positive catalysts to keep this down"
Sudden spike. What's the news?
"139.75 is the key level of support. If we can end above that for the week, then the short term uptrend is still intact."
"Lets see how long the market stays up. Hopefully this is a mini start to another bull run after the quarterly drop we seem to be having ever since this pandemic started. Just hope this does not turn into another obama up down up down, down down up down market"
"One analyst has dropped its earnings for the quarter just ending because of Solo. But, I wonder, whether it took into account better earnings for Avengers and The Incredibles 2. They are both producing about $300 million more than might have been expected (although the Incredibles has just started its run this past quarter). I think that $2.00 a share isn't outrageous. But I wouldn't be surprised with only $1.90."
"Great report buried in that news article yesterday, three big takeaways I saw.... Disney in 6 weeks last year had more downloads than any other app on google and App Store for the ENTIRE year.Hulu was trending higher than I anticipated.Disney broke all download records for apps  in USA.That’s pretty darn impressive "
"DIS and FOX deal to close last week of January 2019! According to industry insiders, executives are expecting the deal will close and be finalized in the last week of January 2019, according to a new report from NBC News."
Everyday I love you more Mickey Mouse.
Upgraded to 160 by citi and a bunch of other analysts.. will continue to climb before ER. https://www.google.com/amp/s/variety.com/2019/film/news/disney-avatar-star-wars-marvel-1203207661/amp/
Disney has been brilliant with their acquisitions . They turned Marvel and Star Wars into cash cows and now they have 20th century fox and a streaming service !!!
Disney has poor leadership and their mismanagement of the Star Wars franchise is proof that they do not understand the audience for said franchise. No one should have confidence in Bob Iger for allowing this to happen. It just shows how they do not have a clue on who to hire (or fire) to manage Star Wars properly.
"I'm surprised no one as made the joke that DIS is going up based on the announcement Bob made that he won't be renewing his contract, and not because of Disney+ LOL"
doomsday tomorrow. start preparing for this. it’s only getting worst.
What’s with the after hours drop?
"Disney reports 'Avengers: Endgame' box office to date $169M, Bloomberg says"
Thursday 11/07 ... Disney BLOWOUT earnings. Stock will go North $150+ after ... that's all you need to know.Any questions?
"DIS should not be sitting here over $101 with all the negative news; a terrible ER, cut the dividend, parks closed until who knows when, sports not ready to start up and movie pipeline delayed/theatres remain closed etc. The positive offset is park in China opening and Streaming.....do not see the positives outweigh the negatives. DIS may be interesting sub $90 to nibble a small position."
What's happening on the 11th? I see a few of you have referenced that date.
Disneyland is opening
"When Disney lists number of people subscribers of Disney + , does that include free ones. I have one year free from Verizon which I will not ever pay for. I never watch it. I don't even think my wife watches anything on it. So I am wondering if I am included as a subscriber, then how many other free customers will actually pay when the free one year is over."
"I can't help but think given Disney's 1923 history in, not just American households, but also world/global households, its current library of shows/films along with all of the future possibilities on FOX/Hulu original content ....just how truly epic the cross-over from straight-up made-for-TV/theater, entertainment/theme parks and all of the merchandising NOW INTO this 800LB+ GORILLA world of media tech/streaming can ultimately be for this nearly 100 yr old company and its stock .....yep one magical ride is in the works ...and it's not just some new Disney World ride ...but rather the ""Mega Magic Money Mountain Ride!"""
please drop 5-10% so i can buy some more. also lol @ options gamblers.
Here we go again...
"You have to read the Market Watch article on Disney! Now remember, these are supposed to 'so-called' experts financial writers. They write that the Disney 'surge' was a surprise... Disney + subscriptions were way up! Seriously? They were surprised?"
"Let's see, leaving out the past year with both a $79 low because of the pandemic and the $153+ high due to very irrational exuberance, the previous four years saw a well run company making a good profit. Duri g this period the stock averaged just about where it closed today. Hmmmm. If many years of profit rewarded the company with a $110 stock price, why would anyone think that this same company with much of its profitable ventures crippled for the foreseeable future command the same price. The cultist would say but now we have Disney + which the company says will be profitable late 2023. That is your argument. Crippled and suspended dividend that retirees counted on. The current stock price is justified only on the minds of the mouse cultists. Dream on."
no wonder this stock has fallen. i’m back to being Bullish!!!https://www.barrons.com/articles/giant-canadian-fund-sold-disney-starbucks-stock-blackberry-51581534218
still over priced
Massive pricing power here. Will double quick
"Fox Says Regulatory Concerns Could Delay, Derail Any Comcast Bidhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/fox-says-regulatory-concerns-could-151315078.html"
$142 tomorrow
new subscribers incredible
"LOL, reality will soon set in. losing 50-200+ million per day. Can't even really calculate the losses per day. Overvalued at this price in a thriving economy, let alone a pandemic crisis total shutdown."
All time high! Buckle up
Earnings after close. How high do you think it can go?
Know some more people who just got back from the parks. Terrible experience. dis is a lousy over valued company.
You guys think this will drop again after the small gain today? I sold when I broke even in hopes it would drop below $100 so I could re-buy Any thoughts?
"Profit taking is still going on, but I will wait because it will end soon before the earnings report, May 8 for sure. DIS will come back full force because it is one of the best stock in DOW 30."
imagine what Avengers far beating expectations will do for the ER call. I bet they have to adjust the guidance numbers quite a bit :)
"Around a third of US tenants didn't pay their April rent.... Judging by this stock, I guess they are saving up for when the parks and cruise ships open?"
If Disney misses Suns Nflx will be up 10-15 tomorrow
"You buy $NFLX and I'll buy $DIS, we'll see which one goes up. Friday, it looks like investors ran from $AMZN, $APPL, and $NFLX to $DIS. Not only has Disney been in business since 1923, it has family oriented content. Netflix is ok, but for me, it's entirely too liberal. I get it, Netflix is trying to appeal to everyone, but I still don't like it. Disney has a ton of potential for growth that investors like, for example, amusement parks, streaming, cruises, it just acquired FOX, etc."
What ya think for Monday? Rise in the 1st hour to attract us simple buyers then sell hard so the big boys can make some extra money off us?
Gina Carano gone? DIS stock will suffer
The trap!!!!! Nicely played market movers. Hold on guys we'll pick back up in a week.
"New all time closing high today.Look at the volume, must be some institutions buying and plenty more shares for them to buy more."
"earnings report (next week, may 8th ) around the corner and remember november ; ) plus historical endgame revenues, beautiful year for this stock."
"Corus Entertianment CJR.B has signed many deals with stream companies such as Netflex, .... etc. It owns a lot of content for childeren and can be high growth with the the stream deals. I believe that it may sign up with Disney and ride the wave of streaming growth."
great company. what can go wrong? number of subscriber will skyrocket and guidance will be good with vaccine outlook
It’s been realized that over thanksgiving and Christmas people will talk about Disney plus. Some adults will be thinking I should buy this stock like Netflix.. . Psychology will drive the price way up as well as fundamentals and technicals. The accumulation phase is over
"I know disney does hulu and cruises but the 35% of it’s revenue from parks does affect it’s profits. The cast members are rude, nasty ss soldiers and yelll constantly at guests to put up thier masks. They yell at you to cover ur nose even in empty spaces late at night. People can can not breath in the FL heat. The unecessary show of rudness and mask wearing for pictures , eating, recordings to wear it all day, high prices long time consuming lines, rides breaking, over crowding, and no social distancing, tatooed gender bending staff will be long remembered, people will not come back. Cruises are not coming back soon even with fake vacines. Netflix has so much more than hulu. This company is going down. PS they need to find Jesus."
Market going downRed week ahead again
Folks we are $1.50 higher than Tuesday and thats with the dow being down 255 points today. take it in stride pour a glass of vino and enjoy the weekend everyone
"Is this because of the Theme parks and Cruise line potential Corona exposure? they are such a diversified company, i think this is a buying OP if so."
"Disney is one of best investment at this price. There is no brainer.As Disney get into streaming business, All will focus how many subscriber they can get and it will add millions and millions in just year. (I expect to end more than 10M-20M first year itself.) While Streaming service still has some time, Market look forward to price and so expect disney to raise.I will add slowly and really hoping price remain around this level so I can keep loading slowly all my profit (Right now so far this year I have no profit but quickly cover my losses. Once turn into profit. All my profit I plan to invest in DIsney)"
"I'm long and been long for a year+. Question: realistically, why the pop the last week when it's been flat for so long? I just want to prepare myself for further run up, or drop (hopefully not). is it just anticipating closure of acquisition? or movie lineup upcoming this year?"
Its always wild when i see a stock rise 11% after reporting a 5 Billion loss. All that tells me is there are nothing but new investors here who have no idea what they are doing. Yes im talking to all of you Robinhood traders.
"Even if parks do open in April, what happens to corona virus?! It’s only gotten worse"
Figured this would be at $200 + this am...what gives?
"I own DIS one year tomorrow, in at $97.81. Had an initial great bounce many months ago to around $115 and then pretty off since then. Not sure how long I'll keep this in my IRA but had higher expectations owning the stock. Should have bought many years ago, all about the timing."
if Disney rises while the whole market is down. you know something big is gonna happen 
Everyone on here keeps talking about the new Star Wars movie but box office success does not correlate with the stock rising... I'm long and bullish but not getting my hopes up... Frozen 2 was a big success and the stock went no where after the box office results...
I just found out Disney owns the die hard series
why down ?????
i’m not gonna celebrate till we cross $155.
Look at all those buys! I guess no one is listening to Traders advice.
$500 bill cap soon!
"Here we go, if this doesn't rise with probably $3 billion in new movie sales at the current moment, something is really, really off. More off than Trump."
I will be in again at 145 :). After going up by more than 7% one day it was expected to have a few days down. but this is still going up mid and long term
Sympathy pains for Apple today.
I just realize that Disney owns the avatar series past present and future how big that be to the bottom line
going to be taking a break from this board after today. Best of luck to all through earnings.
"Woohooo! Stock market closed tomorrow, our first non-red non disappointing day in a long time! Can't wait!"
My DIS calls I sold for 2.25 is now $11.10. I will be remembering this for a long time on how not to execute.lesson learned.
"i helped its sale, always buy Dis' apples fr costco:)"
$200 is a given at this time ....today or tomorrow . Load up !
Buy ahead of earnings like I did. 99.99 percent chance DIS blows subscriber number expectations away. IF the stock sells off you buy even more. This company is sitting on a powder keg...the combination of Disney Plus' explosive growth plus 80 percent of their business reopening down the line mean much higher stock prices than where the stock currently trades.
I don't understand this; dow is up 500 points but disney is only up 50 cents!! What's wrong with disney today!! It's so under preforming today
Also rise of the resistance opens in WDW's Galaxy edge in less than 2 weeks
"Amazon,Samsung, LG Disney+ confirmed by iger. full distribution day one."
I sold Disney early this morning. You're welcome. OMG. Eye roll.
COVID-19 is just getting started. You haven't seen anything yet. The countries in the world are making it very easy for the desease to spread. Yes you can make a few bucks day trading the ups & down in the market but we will continue in a downward direction until a light is seen at the end of the tunnel for the end of COVID-19.
Holding strong.... expect a little dip before the 11th...... then boom.
$GME index + Hedge fund covers = $DIS dead money.
"One of two things, he’s ill and stepping aside or he did something the board didn’t like!"
It's content alone is worth 60 dollars a share; no other company can compete with Orlando assets; you think families will stop visiting Disney in our lifetime; ESPN is just a distraction
"Racist imagery and cultural stereotypes in six Disney animated classics including Peter Pan, The Jungle Book, Lady and the Tramp, The Aristocats, Dumbo and Swiss Family Robinson are being flagged on the Disney+ streaming site with warnings and detailed explanations of the “negative depictions” in each title."
Disney+ growth rate mirrors Facebook but unlike FB it is free! Disney+ platform will be the valuable platform in the World!! Worth Trillions!!!
Kevin O'Leary claims DIS might be the 'buy' of a lifetime at these levels. Once that streaming machine gets going there is no household with children under 12 that will not subscribe at any cost. DIS is building something unique. Remember when Amazon began building something unique and its stock traded at $12 a share!?!
Was their any talk about the dividend during the recent call?
"It's fine folks, just some people profit taking. I have no intensions of selling.... Disney will be just fine and in a year or two investors will be very happy"
I won't get back in until there is proper information about the virus impact
The only reason this is dropping is to free up funds to either cover short positions in GME and AMC or to jump into the madness and try and make a quick buck. It has nothing to do with DIS.
"They missed EPS by 20%All the new subscriptions came gratis of the world government and pandemic stateI say this is the very very top for all indexes. Finally, after all the #$%$ earnings we are ready for the great correction!!!"

ty shorts I was able to buy back my 138 calls I accidently sold last week
How high do we go?!
Eye of the hurricane calm right now as they say...I'm continuing to short every time it hits above 105. Fed won't be able to do anything with all the chaos everywhere. I wish all these companies well down the road but I feel there's a great opportunity now to get in right before the big crash coming soon.Mark Cuban and many others wouldn't be sitting on cash if they thought these stocks were all great to jump in now..time will tell.
"I've been flowing Dis everyday for the last year... Yes I worry Dis will break under 100...BUT I'm confident that if market conditions change for the positive, Dis is going to soar.Untill that happens enjoy the ride, and get ready to pounce when the time comes.Good luck everyone!"

Almost no short Interests.. except a couple misguided souls on this board.
Option trader suffers from a severe case of LIGMA.
I would like to understand what 150 million subscribers to the Disney streaming service will do to the stock price. Anyone have some financial numbers on this?
"Question: If and when the DIS/FOX21 deal closes, it is expected to not be until 2019. What in the interim is going to keep DIS share price from further decline? Apparently, theme park, cable biz, espn, and outstanding movie revenue isn't enough! This is very disheartening!"
"Hong Kong Disney reopened today, Disney Paris on April 2 and after that Disneyland. Buy in now and hold long!!!"
"Sell ABC, for $60 Billion!Qatar Investment Fund sitting with buckets of cash."

"Disney + will have, Marvel and Star Wars content. See ya Netflix."
Wow I remember when this was at $108
Disney can double in valuation. Disney + will be huge and open doors for margin high recurrent revenue. Still wonder that with all the cheap money on the market those entertainment companies havent done any major akquisitions.
ESPN+ debuts today and DIS stock disappoints as usual.
"Goodbye Disney+, goodbye Disney stock."
Does Anyone see DIS as a millionaire making stock?
I think next week will be crazy again but after that I am excited for the smooth sailing for Disney :) I also can’t wait to hear what the bundle options are with Hulu. It might be cool to see some Disney+ + Hulu add free .. and even Disney+ with Hulu live... Maybe throw all that fox content in the mix as well. Lots of opportunity to take in bundles of cash.
Scanning the new content under the Star module on Disney Plus makes the breadth of their content across different demographics pretty dynamic....and what about potential sports programming under an ESPN module or even perhaps live sports like the NFL on Amazon Prime.
Took profits from DIS and invested them into GE & PRTY this morning.
Is any one here concerned about DIS/FOX deal receiving EU and China Regulatory approvals?
Thumbs up if you expect more upgrades to DIS after Investor's Day on Thursday.
"HA Joe trying too hard. Were here long term man, just nice to have fun up days like this :)"
"There are currently only 38 films that have crossed the $1 billion box office threshold, and 21 of those are Disney properties..... just saying"
"I think before the year is out Disney is bought out by Apple, otherwise Disney will dominate the streaming space and stock is an easy double here."

I’m skating to $200
Once Disney starts paying dividends again it will soar.
Being given 75 million subscribers on the house thanks the the w o r l d g o v e r n m e n t is not growing your business. The reaction to earnings says it all.
I just can't get over the action on this stock after their earnings report. This is exactly what happened to Amazon. This is the cheapest you will ever see Disney.
DIS-
Will eventually hit 200 once parks open and more licensing expands next year. Disney plus adds another 50 billion market cap and growing! 
Options expire tomorrow...curious to see what happens on Monday...i’m holding

I just cashed out half my position at $103 for a profit of $21 a share netting me $5250. I continue to hold 250 shares of DIS. Let's see, RCL at a $21K profit, DIS at a $5K profit, CHK at a $10K profit, OXY at a $15K profit. The only concern is BA and I am holding at $98 per share. A BIG THANK YOU to the SHORTS!!!!! Now what to do with all this money?????"

DIS plans to use the profits of bitcoin to do stock buyback!Disney investor relations
What if Disney subscription come close to Netflix next year end of 2021? DIS will be $350?
love the paranoia of nflx posters on this mb. u can’t win vs disney.....ever
Did a DCF Valuation on Disney for my MBA. Value came out to be $167. Definitely undervalued.
I don’t like the price action myself but I think starting in the morning we are going to see some hard buying especially as numbers are rolled out. Probably going to be the last time we see these prices as long as Disney delivers on there end. Iger knows how to deliver so wait for tomorrow and Verizon to release customer subscribers added to the Disney sign ups.
OK I'm giving Disney and upgrade to 175 now let's see if the stock reacts
"small investment 300 shares at $132.40. Tempted to exit, but long term play; plus div. Never been a growth stock, it's Disney hold . Live near Disneyland, annual passes sold out."
Disney Plus is going to be Huge. I'm long on this one.
going downhill from this point on
CNBC just said call options for DIS high volumethis stock can't miss I am buying all the calls I can afford
still up nearly 4% in last 30 days! no complaints here! thumbs up if you received a stimulus check
I think it’s interesting that there are Disney movies (Song of the South and others) that are not on Disney+ yet you can buy them on Blu-ray. The Woke culture and censorship is amazing.
"I want this to get into the $130's again, I'd like to add. Still a little too expensive for me but I really have high expectations given their depth."
steady accumulation to 133 then short squeeze wave 2 of 3
Because of the winter time. Expect huge subscriber growth. Let’s go to $210
"According to reports, Rosenblatt analyst Mark Zgutowicz on Tuesday reinstated his coverage of Disney with a buy and $150 price target, citing compelling risk/reward based on what he sees as promising potential with its Disney+ efforts."
i’m ok with this staying at certain levels and not spiking lower or higher every day like tech does. disney+ news and earnings will take this higher. no need to worry if it goes red or closes lower.
"I don’t understand the stock market. So many companies loosing revenues and market is up. Disney reports dismal revenues and I don’t think they can go back to normal revenues for several months, yet stock is up. Why ? Who else is buying Disney at $100 ?"
Anyone know why it’s still dropping?
Have to say nice work Disney...
Congrats to all the longs..
"Does anyone know if The Mouse will release first day subscription numbers for Australia, New Zealand and Pierre Rico tomorrow?"

"movie was good, why all the fuss?"
"WOW.. Disney can't go down! It must be that too many people are wanting to get in before it continues back up, so every drop it bought before it gets very far. :) love it. Makes it harder to add more shares... but I guess many are in that same boat, and its a great boat to be in!"

I can not wait for some positive news about controlling this virus I can not even imagine how fast this is going to be going up
Disney can easily fix park attendance by dropping ticket prices. they got to greedy with star wars opening and i don’t blame them. they could drop prices next year and easily make up the attendance analyst we’re looking for. Plus! even if they don’t decrease park tickets. Bundle+ Tyler. wanna be my friend?
"I’ve read and watched most comments interviews so far on DIS higher bid. Few things. 1) Iger and Murdock had dinner last night...sure they talked about this deal; 2) DIS offer of $38 per share surprised the street...showed them IGER is ready for battle; 3) Timing of DIS revised bid was so perfect that FOX Board announced today that they have entered into an Amended Merger Agreement with DIS....this suggest that at FOX didn’t even go back to CMCSA...again DIS has Murdock’s in their side and relationships in place. I don’t think CMCSA is done, but I feel much better about DIS winning this in the end. Separately, I’ve watched CNBC for over 20 years (for those that don’t know, CNBC is owned by CMCSA) and I’ve never seen such a bias in their commentary on the FOX deal. I love how defeated the commentators looked today (David Fabre and others)."
200$ coming real quick
Why is it only up .82 after hours?
"It is quite interesting that the stock price is just over, or around the ""collar"" of the Fox transaction. For those not quite familiar, Fox shareholders are entitled to a certain amount of Disney Stock equal to $38 a share. The higher the stock price, the lower amount of shares (and conversely, the lower the Disney stock price, the higher number of shares). But there is a limit - once at 114.31 the number of shares is set (and if it goes higher, the amount of shares issued does not change). I want it to stay above 114.31, to limit dilution. I'm sure Disney wants the same (the more shares outstanding, the lower profits per share). I wonder if Disney is buying back stock to prompt the price (it had said that it was stopping its stock buyback). It is curious that the price has lingered around this number for so long. It took Disney a long time to get its number of shares down from 2 billion to 1.5. I was looking forward to seeing it at 1 billion. I don't think I'll ever see that. But I do bet that Disney starts its buybacks, at least publicly, in the next year (after it buys the remaining Hulu interests).By the way, I've had a couple of other stock exchanges recently - ATT bought my Time Warner - that was UNDER the collar price, so I got a few more shares - but the ""purchase"" price was less than originally stated because of ATT's stock price slump. So I don't know if there is any real improper actions (I really think Disney is on the up and up, although some stock buybacks wouldn't necessarily be out of line."
Well on a positive note I shot an 84 today on the golf course so I got that going for me.
"Still about a $1 difference between bottom and top bands to trade in, Friday weeklys should make me a lot of money, risky,but also very rewarding and usually cheap premium."

"Spent my Tuesday at Disneyland, party of 8 adults 5 children. Total spend on tickets $1,600 for 3 day pass, $25 x 3 cars for parking, Disney souvenir $32 and $350 for lunch at downtown Disney. It’s only lunch time I am not done. Crowds are insane 70 minute wait for each ride, I only went on 2 rides... I am more confident than ever that Disney is a money maker."
I feel like this will rise well once the parks open back up at a normal capacity and functionality.
What are the chances the reinstate the Q2 divi?
I cancelled my disney+. I am gonna be selling my shares next week. I am not interested in China Disney

Don't quite understand why we're dropping...
"Guys, calls or puts for tomorrow?"
Nice
Just signed up for that 3 year subscription. November 12 can’t come soon enough!
New high coming today! The MOUSE rules the house.
"A report came out with survey results...""23% are likely to cancel Disney+ within 6 months""....I'm glad DIS is holding strong today despite that. When I read that headline, I see ""77% are likely to KEEP Disney+ within 6 months"" :)"

Adding UFC deal to ESPN+ is going to boost the subscriptions through the roof!! UFC is growing rapidly and having an option to watch it at home for a monthly subscription is going to be an incredible add to Disney’s subscription revenue for 2019!
only reason it’s down is cause everyone is getting ready for earnings. Box office news can only add so much. earnings will be the next factor before it rises $5+
2020 is going to be a big year for Disney with all the original programming coming to Disney Plus. Especially the Marvel & future Star Wars shows. Favreau has a winner with Mandalorian...best Star Wars product since original trilogy.
$150 by year end . I will take it
My Disney plus freed 6 months is up - No way I’m not continuing . This qtr will be great - I can only imagine what next will be like .
sell the news type of day?
"Long term I believe DIS still has room to run higher. But short term it probably has more downside risk since for the past 2 weeks, it has gained more than 15%. We have the first day of distribution on last Friday, if the distribution continues for 3 days, then there will be more downside risk. I will wait for the confirmation before selling more puts to acquire shares."
"no need to read news and what analysts have to say about disney. ask yourself if any other streaming service has the power of Disney. even Millenials with no kids that have netflix at some point they will either get Disney+ or visit one of the parks. Think of why Warren Buffet bought Apple because of its cycle with costumers. People who have iphone will purchase Imac, airpods etc. Same thing with Disney. Kids who watch Frozen will watch another Disney Movie, they will buy its merchandise and will go to the parks. As a parent of 4 year old it was no brainer for me to get disney and my son apsolutely loves it. will hold till the end of 2020. Europe will Get Disney + by march and that will add another 20 million minimum considering England, Germany, France, Italy, alone have 300million people combined. Enjoy the ride to the moon people and Happy New Years.Oh did i mention the 7 billion dollar movies for 2019 and 13 movies that are coming out this year. possibly will we get another Frozen from these new movies coming out"

"The most logical reason I’ve seen for this fall $DIS has taken today is that the AT&T ER is also bringing down $DIS. That makes some sense seeing that $DIS, $T, and $NFLX are all down substantially. Having said that... what does Time Warner do in the realm of streaming?Besides that, if this down move in $DIS is due to $T, I can’t imagine $DIS not snapping back. People have to see the difference there... but... anything is possible... we’ll just have to see..."

"I'm no expert, but I think the fact that DIS got well above 112 today really says something. Even though it cooled down shortly after, the fact that it got there shows that we are REALLY close to staying above 112. Once we get there, I think DIS will officially be out of their current funk. Again, not an expert, just my opinion."
Solid day. Predicted 102-102.5 came up short but tested the waters. Feel like tomorrow will be another strong day for all markets. Let’s get a damn good day

"Let’s be real, you probably are already paying for Netflix. And there are plenty of reasons to stay. You need to know whether the next season of Stranger Things will venture to the Soviet union or see how The Crown handles the Princess Diana years or are hoping that maybe El Camino isn’t the only Breaking Bad movie that will find its way to the streaming service. You’re already hooked, and it’s going to take a really compelling bundle of shows to un-hook you.The library is massiveEven if Netflix were to lose all of its licensed content, the company has prepared by building a huge catalogue of original shows and movies. Plus, now that they’ve poached just about every big name in TV from the floundering networks, including Ryan Murphy and Shonda Rhimes, they’ve essentially replaced the networks as the key provider of television content."
Is this setting up for a big drop after earnings? Seems like a lot of risk to be buying before earnings.
Can we get our dividends back?
All personal opinions aside why would one buy DIS over MSFT at $145? Just curious what information attracted you here.

"We need a dip today and tomorrow to finish out the triangle formation. I know I've talked about this a lot, but we are at the tip of it so I'm really hoping it closes out by tomorrow with one last dip. Remember that the presentation doesn't start until 2pm PST, which is an hour after market close. So if it plays out correctly, we should see red tomorrow and a breakout on Friday."

"Mouse house rocked it again. Disney streaming baby sitting service. The kids stay glued to most shows. gives us some time to clean up the house, make meals, etc. 70.00 a year, no problem. 200.00 in 2020 sounds good to me."
covered my short on friday. buying long now
Don’t look at this stock everyday. It will only make you sad. Long term I see this going up but most days will be either red or non existing.
16 yr long shareholder here. added over the years. recently added on the way down in a trading only position. I am at a very nice profit on that and taking it. My long shares will be there for my kiddos and one day grand-kiddos. thanks!
Has anyone seen the dividend paid in their account? I have it down for today. TIA.
Disney's service sector revenue is 60 Billion (87%). Direct to consumer (Disney+) revenue is 9 Billion (13%).Don't be underplayed by just the increase in Direct+ subscription. Disney services are completely affected and there is going to be huge drop in its revenue.
"The trend is definitely up, but am I the only one waiting for today's profit grab?"
Earnings will be a blowout no doubt
welp that pre mkt uptick is gone fast
"Does anyone know why Comcast is bidding on Fox AND Sky? Why would they try to compete with a company they plan on owning? It seems more sense to try to win one or the other. If they REALLY believe they can win Fox, then let them have Sky so you can take it when you win Fox. Making Fox pay more just means you'll carry that debt when you buy Fox. My only thought is that they don't truly believe they will get both (or either) and they are just messing with Disney and Fox to make sure they pay as much as possible for both."
I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on the part of the Disney/Netflix deal that brings movies made between 2016 and 2018 back to Netflix in 2026. I can't see Disney just letting that go. My thinking is Disney will end up buying out that contract so they won't return to Netflix. Netflix could use the money to chip away at their debt and/or create more original content. It would be a win/win. Other's thoughts?

wow! good marketing. Did everyone see the 2 minute Star Wars commercial at halftime monday night football last night? Looks incredible
Star Wars over half billion in revenue so far. Looks like it’s catching up to revenue expectations after all. Hopeful Disney will bounce back to $150 before the new year

"The ESPN viewership will remain a persistent headwind. The problem is not cord cutting of cable, the problem is the increasing number of people not watching ESPN anymore. DIS should seriously consider selling ESPN, this part of business has very little synergy with what Disney does. Their theme parks, movie studios, consumer products, cruise line are all doing well, what does a sports channel have anything to do with any of these? It's time to cut it, and share price shall rise."
"So Netflix has 167 Mill subscribers, Disney 50 mill. Both roughly the same Market Cap. Does Disney have a chance to equal that valuation with just streaming if they get around the same subscribers ? Without all the other businesses they have? Espn, cruises, Disney world, etc...?"
111 is hard resistance for today. Let’s see if it only gets there and plays around this area or if it can close significantly above.
Disney sitting on value. It will be interesting to see what happens once they drop their old ways of thinking and adapt to full streaming. Black Widow is just sitting on the shelf collecting dust. As they delay releasing this film Ms. Johansson grows older and may age out of her role. It amazes me how so called loyalty can over ride common sense.

My predictions for earnings report today. Disney announces 2 for 1 stock split and also that Black Widow goes to streaming on Disney +.
"Captain Marvel is saving the day.It is on track to hit $155 million to $160 million. Given that it was around $100 million 4 weeks ago, that is very very nice.And overseas it seems to be on track to hit $300 million. Given that the Disney was hoping for $350 million worldwide this weekend, this is really MARVELous. It is exceeding expectations. To be candid, I am a little surprised that its not doing a little better. The local movie theater is packed - I saw it this morning, and it had a lot of screens reserved for it, and all had it noted as ""limited seating"". I saw a fair number of females going to see it. I would have thought that a number 10 - 15% higher wouldn't be surprising. But maybe my minor survey is not truly accurate or reflective. In any case, it set up Avengers End Game for at least $2 billion, and I think $2.2 is not out of the question.One minor point - this movie only cost $150 million in production costs - a little less than others - I think Black Panther was $200 million. I suspect that marketing costs were $100 million - perhaps a little on the high side - but Disney did not want to have anything less than a hit - this is an advertisement /lead in for Avengers.And, for what it's worth. I thought it was great - it exceeded my expectations. I thought that the last 10 minutes might have been a little flat, but that's my opinion."
"I remember when I first started trading options...I used to buy and sell everyday skimming a little profit .it's exciting and a rush...because its grambling. sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. since going long I've made as much in the last 3 months as I made last year short selling. my point, I would much rather go long on a stock I have faith in then aggressively gamble with my money. just my 2 cents."

With Endgame’s success, upcoming blockbuster movies, theme parks opening, possible Dis hotel prices increase, possible Hulu total ownership, not to mention the upcoming Disney+ launch, I’ll keep my longs and will buy more. Congrats to those earning on this week or today’s options."
great earnings but only up by less than 3%?
PM should turn GREEN before the bell.
Let's get ready for a great week
"How about on Fast Money on Thursday one of the guys said Disney would underwhelm with it's new Streaming Service and with his Final Trade said ""sell"" Disney. Good call there..."
1 BILLION DOLLARS!
When is Disney going to buy FOX.
"Wow, my alerts were set to $110... missed the chance on open to grab them slightly above.. solid company for the long term, sellers feel free to drop the price more so I can pick them up! ;)"
My wife is going to be so happy. i dont own disney but she does
"Quote me, she will break 120 by end of next month, Way too many good things going for her."
Anyone knows any site to see the latest news on stocks instead of relying on rumors and having no clues why the stock is going up or down ?
Lots of insider buying yesterday at 146. Star wars is going to have a good weekend and Monday shareholders will have a nice bump
"I mean, Comcast should just give up, really...but I know they won't yet... https://seekingalpha.com/news/3365713-disney-set-double-asset-sales-secure-fox-deal"
I hope you’re right
"DIS will be in GREEN today, no matter what, because the END GAME money will overcome the profit taking money."
What a discount. Oversold all morning long. Hope it does not continue.
"$94 is still a gift to fox news viewers......This is going to $50. Hundreds of millions in losses, containment and possible lawsuits over dragging their feet on closures. Anything can be litigated in court, whether they dragged their feet or not will still cost them untold millions in legal fees.....Hotel rooms....thousands upon thousands will be empty for months and months."
2 words: Gap Up
"05:44 AM EDT, 03/22/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Walt Disney(DIS) is closing the Fox 2000 film unit as it begins to restructure and consolidate operations after its acquisition of 21st Century Fox (FOX, FOXA), according to media reports.Disney (DIS) will complete the Fox 2000 films currently in production. Meanwhile, previously released titles such as ""Life of Pi"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" will become part of Disney's(DIS) movie library, according to reports.MT Newswires does not provide investment advice.

Went to book a Disney Christmas trip hoping I would get a good deal. Unfortunately it said sold out. Guess I am late.
We have Baby Yoda and he's 50! How cool is that.

"Don’t be scared by Iger stepping down. He learned a lot from Eisner, and Chapek no doubt has learned a lot from Iger. We’re in good hands."
Struggling with the $200 wall.
oh quit crying everyone we all know Disney is the safe bet...I just added more shares..now over 55% of my portfolio
"Disney streaming service uptake will be phenomenal. All the Marvel and Star Wars hero’s, plus decades of children’s Disney movies. If you think this past quarter was good, next earnings report will be amazing."
Doesn't DIS stock chart resemble a bull flag? What does this mean going forward?
"Ride the earnings until Friday, watch the virus news. If it get much worse- take profit on Friday."
"So many people are trying to get the D23 deal for Disney+ that it's broken the website!!! Temporary bad news for those trying to sign up, but a terrific sign for DIS!!! PS...I signed up last night, just waiting for my Disney+ invitation. :)"
Was the new Marvel theme park mentioned?
"sad how I'm excited about a 30 cent move while bloated Tesla up 60 to absolutely insane valuations. aiming for 500,000 cars but valued higher than multiple car companies selling millions of vehicles. unreal"
"Disney streaming is a stay at home parents dream. If you need a break to get laundry done, make dinner etc. You wanna know how many subs there will be? How many kids worldwide are in pampers? That doesn’t even include the Star Wars market."
"Anyone think DIS is ripe for a stock split? If the streamer service is a success. I see the stock climbing in 2020. A price approaching $200, is psychologically inhibitive for parents who traditionally buy Dis stock for the kids in an educational account. Its been approx 20 years since the last split."
Sell DIS. There is nothing to watch there. This bump from 130 to 175 is speculative. NFLX is the king. Most DIS subs are gonna go back once they find there is no content to watch to pay for increasing NFLX sub rate. DIS will have to spend billions to catch-up. Friends left NFLX no issues. Office will be no impact to NFLX. DIS is over valued.
what a surprise....analysts had their estimates too low!!!! who could have guessed
I am torn between watching Disney plus or watching the stock market.
"This is why the Disney Fox transaction makes sense. It is costing Disney about $35 billion - I know you say it is about $72 billion in stock and cash, but Disney is getting the SKY $16 billion, plus it is getting about $20 billion for the local sports cable channels - that brings the price down to about $35 billion. I would even tell you that Disney is going to get more money because it will be able to repatriate money parked overseas for tax benefits, money that it might not be able to get otherwise. And this doesn't take into account other assets that Disney might sell - Draft Kings anyone?? Netflix is paying $15 billion a year for original content. They need to do this because they don't have any library. But Disney is getting Fox's library - that saves Disney $30 million over two years - yes, I know that Disney will still do some original content, but no where near $15 billion.And Disney is getting an active movie production company, channels, Hulu (30%), and other assets. Disney has said that they will be getting $2 billion in synergies a year for consolidating operations. I trust Iger. He knows what he is doing.The market is waiting on the streaming services. We will have to wait about a year. It will be well worth it."
Where do you guys look up analyst upgrades/price target changes?
got in at 130
Lmao end of day bag holders panic buying
Boy is this one tired from the run. Buy the dips!
Funny how Chinad president look exactly like Winnie-the-Pooh 
I expect and believe Disney must and will respond to Comcast’s bid for Fox by no later than end of business this Friday (6/15/18). It will be a combo of stock/cash...I’m guessing $72 billion total....but should be closer to $75 which I think secures the deal for DIS even if Comcast counters a bit higher. Others thoughts ?
"When this thing has an up day, it doesn't even dip, it just pauses."
In the 140s after thursday’s Announcement
"If you think NFLX earnings impressive, wait till DIS posts it's Q3."
"Any take on Apptopia's numbers that are coming out today? I would have thought that it would have been issued by now, as it was released in the early morning two weeks ago when they first issued their take."
"Hello there Joe! Well based on the info I received from some colleagues that I did post a few hours ago I increased my positions in DIS by only 100 shares, BA by only 100 shares and RCL by 100 shares 15 minutes before the close (Joe - this was via my financial advisor of course). So glad I did! I actually feel gleeful that the S&P will never see 2230 something again after I dumped half of my dry powder (bond money) which was an additional 225K into it (via annuity) on March 23rd that I also posted a few days ago (I think sleepy Joe was making fun of me about this). So sleepy Joe, I think it is official, you will never see $65 on DIS. I am winning this tug of war contest. The news came quicker to the US then I thought it would. But I knew it would come. Now granted this is an after hours pop so as soon as I get done laughing at all the shorts LOL and wishing sleepy Joe well now that he is going to lose all his money LOL I will take a look at some data and send stop losses to yes, my financial advisor that Joe laughed at so he can implement right after the open. Good luck sleepy Joe!"
Disney is going to make a lot of people wealthy. Just have patience.
Disney sees those Netflix multiples and they want that
I just read whisper numbers for Disney plus are at 30 million subscribers  wait until this news hits the wire lol go Disney
creeping up to green before the bell
"Kind of weird how silent you pumper longs got? Don't frown for too long, you have a chance still to lock in some nice gains on the next pop...if you are SMART"
"Y'all calm down! The market hasn't even been open for an hour! Almost every time the stock opens green, it dips down to red. People always sell in the morning to get some profit. It will climb back up."
i bought more shares 
"Almost everyone on this DIS message board is bearish and displays disbelief that the stock is up, so who is buying it up then? "
any idea why we are going down with good news. I cant imagine if there was any negative news in the last week or 2 but there hasn't been.
Approaching 50 dma - technically approaching oversold on many fronts - let's see if it holds and starts to bounce finally.
THINGS WERE LOOKING UP AT THE MOVIE THEATER WHERE MY 10 YEAR OLD SON WENT AND SEEN FROZEN 2. HE SAID IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST AND THERE WERE CHILDREN EVERYWHERE.THE TICKET PRICE WAS $17.00 A PERSON AND HE SAID THEY HAD 3 DIFFERENT THEATERS SHOWING THE MOVIE A FEW MINUTES APART FROM EACH OTHER. HE HAD NO TROUBLE GETTING TICKETS ON SHORT NOTICE HERE IN CENTRAL FLORIDA.
I just hope Sneezy is wearing a mask.
I think if Disney+ continues to grow the stock could hit 260-270 in a few years. Do you feel the same?
Beats on both TOP and BOTTOM lines. DisneyPlus announces 95m total subscribers. 146 million DTC subscribers. Wow! All without the theme parks and cruise lines. Wow!
It’s going to $210 today
"What happened to $198 p/m? There's clearly a pattern I see with my stocks, as soon at the all the tech stocks rise, this drops."
127.59 million US households. 41.4% have children. 52 million instant subscribers.
"please explain how DIS is barely moving despite the upcoming Disney+ launch and owning some of the most popular and revenue generating entertainment franchises/properties? Disney has money coming in from a million directions (parks, merchandise, licensing, cruises, tv, etc. etc.) Meanwhile, NFLX is continuing to borrow billions for content while getting revenue solely from website subscribers, but the stock rises. I bailed on my NFLX subscription some time ago and now just share one with a family member. Yes, NFLX has a large library by this time but I find myself still watching their non-NFLX content mostly (I have found myself watching more Amazon Prime original content) and it seems their kid friendly offerings are limited. Have to imagine every home with a child will shell out for D+. Frankly, I find it amazing that anyone has time to watch all the content being pumped out between streaming, tv, etc. Personally, I would rather have a life (or something close to it) than watching endless hours of entertainment. Have to wonder what is considered a ratings ""hit"" these days given how much content is competing for eyeballs."
happy new year Disney investors.. can't wait for all the great things coming up!! ..
No reason for this stock to be down today. Buying more. It was up in the pre market. Could be people taking money off the table. Make no mistake the stock is going higher from here.
"Walt Disney Co has hired the head of Netflix Inc’s original film division, Matt Brodlie, for its streaming service Disney+, according to a report by Deadline on Tuesday.https://www.reuters.com/article/walt-disney-moves/disney-poaches-netflix-film-making-chief-for-streaming-service-deadline-idUSL4N23W3SM?feedType=RSS&feedName=companyNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+reuters/companyNews+(News+/+US+/+Company+News)"
This is as shocking as Amazon after earnings.
What they did to Gina Carano was wrong hope people cancel and the stock tanks.
"Funny, I liked Disney better with a 15 handle on a PE ratio. Now they are burning through 5 bil in losses per quarter and the stock has skyrocketed like 50%. Funny."

Here’s the plan. Buying in three increments. Buy once a week at 92 or below from here on out. Probably make three total trades then sit on my hands.
Is it breakout time?
The corruption of the mainstream media will be fully on display. Stay tuned.
Oh I’m about to short this thing!
www.bloombergquint.com/technology/apple-hire-of-disney-video-executive-highlights-talent-rivalryApple hires Disney+ exec.......What if Apple is planning some sort of Disney+ Apple TV+ tie-up......there seem to be some synergies in my opinion.....
"Cautiously optimistic at the rate the day is going. Earnings after hours, it would be so great to see this hit into the $140's after hours. Good luck to all."
"I’m happy with DIS getting FOX. Don’t understand why they need SKY. Yes, they get 24 million customers in several European countries and some sports rights. DIS owns BamTech which is said to have the best streaming technology out there....and they can use their streaming service in the same way Netflix has to create a global direct to consumer business. DIS can save over $35bn by not bidding for the 61% share of SKY. Curious to hear other opinions."
Soul is fantastic. It has all of he elements of what life is about. It reminded me so much on how my parents managed life's tough questions when I was 5-6 years old. For any parent who is raising children the message is as tried and true today as it was when my parents raised their family. These values stood the test of time for decades and still apply today. Everyone should learn early the value of hard work and the contributions we can make from it. Imagine if everyone followed these simple rules that are so basic for all of us. Soul is spot on ans so up lifting. Soul will either re enforce what may have already learned from their formative years or will make those who were less fortunate hit the pause and reset their lives to do more good for humanity than harm to others. Bravo to Pixar - you rekindled the spirit of true American family values.
The full Lion King trailer was released this morning and it looks phenomenal! I know this movie is globally popular and nostalgic for many of us. That being said...I don’t understand how to forecast global box office results assuming this is just a near perfect live action remake of the original movie. Everyone knows the story and part of fun or enjoyment of watching any movie is not knowing what’s going to happen and other exciting twists in the plot. Curious to hear what others think about this.
here we go boys!!!! Good luck everyone.
"It’s natural to give some back after this amazing run! Next major catalyst will be earnings, more upgrades would be great too!"
"James Dontino, selling at this elevated price.Great long term company."
"These are very very good earnings. Good because the Parks and Media carried them. The Parks were expected, but the Media is a nice surprise. I think that the cutting of cable is stabilizing, and what Iger said three years ago is correct - ESPN has a lot of increased expenses, but the increased expenses will ease out in 2018-19. It is good because Movies pulled it down - last year they might have done $1 billion more in box office for the same period. If they had 80% of last year's box office this year, they would have blown everyone away.Someone commented that profit margin is down, with expenses increasing - yes, of course, the movies they had this year were just as expensive as last year, and they grossed less. That pulled margins down. This quarter they have two big movies - Dumbo and Captain Marvel. Next quarter, three - Avengers, Aladdin, and Toy Story. Then the next quarter they have Lion King. They just might do $8.00 a share (there is a small tax benefit in the last three quarters of the fiscal year as they average the benefit over four quarters, and only 75% of the benefit kicked in last year.And this lead to why this quarter was particularly good - last year this reporting quarter was at the old tax rate - this year's first quarter used a tax rate of 24%, opposed to last year's 31%, and the 21% they will use going forward."
"Disney has been a bellwether stock since before most traders were born. Why buy it now? Why the upgrades? Star Wars, Marvel, Fox, and their original content in one streaming service that costs less than Netflix? That and theme parks, merchandizing, etc. etc. A solid company that has become a growth stock."
Tomorrow is another investor day correct ?
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/14/sell-netflix-in-favor-of-disney-says-expert.html
https://seekingalpha.com/news/3366589-dj-doj-approve-disneys-71b-fox-deal-soon-today
"OK, Germany, Italy, France and Spain starting to get back to the work place slowly starting next week. My colleagues from Germany are to report to the office on Monday at noon. France and Italy on Monday morning. That puts the US about 2 to 3 weeks out. Looks like early May (hopefully). So if I can hold sleepy Joe from reaching $65 on DIS for another 2 weeks there will be vast improvement in DIS, BA and RCL at that time. Until then, it is all about volatility."
I don’t know why disney is moving with Nasdaq not Dow! This is a real mess stock if it doesn’t move accordingly!!
What time is earnings report?
May the Force be with DIS and Us shareholders!
Another fun fact.... The Mandalorian is in the running for Most In Demand Series Debut and most in demand streaming series which has surpassed Netflix Stranger Things and HBO Game of Thrones  source observer dot com
Lots of momentum for 2021. Anything under $300 is undervalued.
I think these prices are an absolute gift didn't think I would see this below 140 before earnings and subs...
I'm thinking a 20% pop tomorrow? People underestimated Disney + big time especially with the new information that people are dumping netflix and other streaming services for it. I would like to see Disney start catching Amazon and I think their streaming service is just the beginning.
this Fox and Hulu acquisition is a lot bigger than we know. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/owns-india-apos-top-streaming-195700640.html
Nice work everyone! Positive news for the park reopening today in late April. Hold strong here for a very promising near term and long term outlook for one of the best companies around. All shareholders will be rewarded!
"I'm guessing Fox will announce a new date for the vote on Disney either today or tomorrow, now that the DOJ approval is official. Either a new date, or reinstate the July 10 date they cancelled."
"Bottom line, this company just has too many catalysts in the pipeline to be held down between the corporate tax cut, the future streaming service, the Fox deal (which is already done, the Comcast stories are a desperate attempt to hurt the mouse) and now the gains to ESPN from the sports betting decision. Not to mention all the hit being cranked out by the movie division. This is probably one of the few large companies that has multiple defined upside catalysts. This is going to get big quickly."
Things must be looking good. Joe/options trader/D are scared again :)
"Do you think that Disney will reinstate their dividend payments soon? Also, I saw that some here believe the stock can hit $1,000 in the next 3-4 years. What makes you believe that?"
Upcoming Disneyland parade.
"Disney was losing 30 million dollars a day before they laid off 100,000 employees. So now they’re probably losing 20 million dollars a DAY . This is going down before it goes up . That is massive bleeding of cash . They had massive debt before this shutdown, now they’re compounding debt with no end in sight"
so what happens after i download everything and have watched everything twice????cancel?

Nice dip. Will start position today b4 earnings
Low key the best stock you can invest in.

My condolences to all the families for their loss. No words can describe all the pain from losing a loved one."
"There is a story that claims Dis+ will exceed Netflix subscribers in 2024. Unless Disney has a capacity or throughput issue that will limit the number of subscribers their network can support, it is far more likely Disney will surpass NFLX either later in 2021 or sometime in 2022. Disney has a slew of new content coming and will offer new movie releases sometime in an upcoming announcement. There is so much bad or stale content out there that Disney can easily surpass NFLX with any amount of reasonable effort to boost content sooner. The only ingredient needed is desire from their leadership to do so."
Disney is set to become one of the streaming giants worldwide !!!The Netflix numbers were amazing but I belive the Disney numbers are even higher !!! There is no stopping the mouse !!Today it’s on sale !!!
71 Billion is way to much if you ask me. Netflix spends that on content in 8 years orso. Instead of buying they could have produced 4.500 episodes of Game of Thrones for example. That is 1 episode a day for over 12 years.... What a whaste of money. I own a few Disney stocks but this move i don't like at all.
"At the Star Wars Premier in LA, waiting for the cast later tonight"
Once the numbers for DIS + come out=Katie by the door.
we are GREEN...WOO WHOOO
"So, let me get this right. A new company, without an extensive history, raises lots of money, invests it all in creating inventory, and hopes it succeeds, maybe is making a little money, but burning all its cash, essentially gambling all it has, and the market thinks it deserves a high pe ratio. Another company, well established, with a history of profits, and presently earning a very nice profit, with great cash flow, decides to invest in a related enterprise, with solid planning and a wise/steady roll out, utilizing inventory that is not otherwise being used or available to others, and the market penalizes it.Makes sense to me!!!!"
just bought an additional 335 shares . might buy me a porsche once it goes up after nov earnings
This is why don't buy a stock post ER that the all the legacy institutions are unanimously bullish on. You could see this selloff a mile away last night. I have yet to see a big institutional analyst get negative on Disney since the Dis+ announcement. Who is left to buy?

SJW issues are starting to take their toll on Disney properties Star Wars and Marvel. They need to right the ship and make what people want to see. This is a business and a stagnant share price and low yield are not going to cut it. We don't need more headlines like this one. Or watch writer/directors get tossed to the curb over old tweets and then get picked up by Warner to make DC movies. You can have strong female and minority leads without getting in the face of fans. https://cosmicbook.news/disney-shutting-down-marvel-comics

Disney looks like it’s going to pop by Thursday earnings by tomorrow 187 by earnings 190 If we get there and Disney blows away subscribers then you’re looking at $210Friday
I now have this as my number 1 position and average cost is $104-> is there any near term catalyst that can turn this around? They way this is being priced other than market tanking hard to see this getting much lower- thoughts?
"Attention all posters bashing Disney: you will not understand Disney and the power it has if you don't or have never had kids. It's that simple. Trust me, if you have kids, especially 16 and under, you are going to spend a lot of money on Disney products. Birthday parties decorations, vacations, it's just unbelievable how far Disney's reach is."
Yes sir
Like if this will break 145 by earnings
Remember D. Said he was going to buy a Lamborghini with money made by shorting DIS the day before Investors Day. That was so funny!
Surprised it is red still today with the news of the early European launch. Likely green at close.
have you ever noticed that kids will watch the same thing more times than buffett has money. over and over and over. as long as theres kids disney plus and disney will do fine. Im still hoping for a short term drop of 80'ish. disney is closed !!!!
I feel today is the beginning of a mass exodus of Disney+. The Mandalorian was the only reason to even subscribe. Most of the demographic that watches the Mandalorian will agree with Gina and cancel.
Closed all the parks and yet today up 7.93%

"Wells Fargo initiated Disney as ‘outperform’Wells Fargo called the company a top pick and said Disney was in “rarified air” as it appeals to consumers of all ages.“DIS is arguably not just a Media company, but a unique global consumer brand leader. Its DTC business is second in value only to NFLX. It’s $116bn Park & Consumer business is a large cap in and of itself. Studio is arguably the biggest and best in the world, now even bigger with 20th Century Fox. Media Nets aren’t growthy, but they’re cash annuities, and we apply an academically consistent 6x EV/EBITDA multiple on ESPN, given our bearish sports view. We see Disney as being in the rarified air of appealing to consumers of all ages and generations across continents and product offerings.”"
"like Apple Disney waited for the streaming business to reach maturity and direction, then sets into motion a plan to take control of their own future, drawing in advertisers, in my opinion as the family unit and Disney reconnects for BRIGHT future"

glad I bought Disney at 97
Just wait till DIS launches in China
i know the second i sell. it will go back up. not down. which is why i never listen to a message board and think i’m gonna get back in at a cheaper price.
"Now DIS controls its own vertical platform, which is the best solution. DIS will dominate the streaming platform as soon as it starts. I expect the subscription will be over 60 million when it starts within 6 months. The content that DIS already has is more than enough for luring and bring in subscription. The strategy of DIS is stop NFLX and PRIME to grow and deviate to cut NFLX growth which I think it will take a few years. NFLX will have to invest even more but I think its content is not worth 12.99, so I think NFLX will deflate itself eventually. DIS will dominate the streaming because DIS has other revenue to support the long term war with NFLX."
go long

"I have been in this market for 31 years and I can't believe people who are buying the dip here. Are you worried that it's going to go up 10-15 a share. The downside risk is so great here I am not sure where to start. What happens if they need to start closing parks. Where do you think their share price will be ? I would not stand on the tracks with this one and I really believe this is going to re-shape big crowds in the future. They did say the same thing about Lehman, Morgan Stanley, BofA, Washington Mutual and almost every bank back in 08. Lehman is a steal at 60 it can't go lower.Look this is a great iconic company that will do good over the years, but I wouldn't jump in front and instead let it play out. The upside is what 10-15 a share where the downside could be catastrophic."
"Will CBS sell Star Trek and will Disney buy? Yes, yes and yes."
"so my theory today is, if Netflix goes higher after earnings report. does disney go too?"
AMC theaters in Denver is charging $18.00 a pop to see the new Star Wars Movie. Does Disney claim extra ticket charge in revenues?
back over $200 in no time!
"Recession proof stock, strong balance sheet, diversified revenues, nice divy and huuuge upside potential with Disney+ and Hulu. What else you need?"
Warren Buffet will buy Dis in the future
"I don't know what to be more excited for...all the details of Galaxy's Edge FINALLY coming out, or all extra cash flow coming to the parks! I'm a tech geek, so I'm really looking forward seeing what technology is used at the new land. I also love money lol."
Setting up for earnings on Feb 3rd. Keep selling and I'll be looking to add more just like I did at 90 and 131 before the last earnings call.
"The people that are pouring their money into DIS aren't expecting a quick buck. They know a clear winner when they see one that has virtually no competition. DIS has a clear grasp over the future generation. Something Netflix is clawing at and Amazon Prime paws. DIS is the future of immersive entertainment. Disney+ will change everything,"
This is one of the many things that's going to drive Disney+ to the top at lightning speed! Marvel fans who have unanswered questions will have a chance to get answers on Disney+ shows like Loki. https://comicbook.com/marvel/2019/06/09/marvel-studios-reveals-first-look-at-loki-disney-series/
Told myself I would sell after earnings..I did not..lol.. I probably would.have at the beginning of the day when it was up but I was busy..so back to my long term hold position I guess lol..
"CNBC just said baby shark video has been seen over 3 billion times. Top 10 youtube videos ever. SO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE, Disney+ will dominate parents. Imperial Capital knows nothing!"
The stock is set to soar once again. Make Disney Stock Great Again!
I am in confusion. 
Traveling with the kiddies in the backseat watching home alone 3 on Disney +
The dips are your gift to get on the gravy train..overall price will continue to climb. Too many catalysts...just way way too many catalysts...
my new addiction is watching live streams of Disney on youtube. but not watching any new rides. just walk around the parks and watching classic rides.
New ath coming soon to a stock mear you!!
Target should give Disney a boost. They are best of breed retailer right now and they are big partner with Disney. Frozen2 and Star wars merchandise will sell like crazy.
Just loaded up in shares. This stock is so undervalued. This will pass Netflix in the next few years.
"""Frozen 2,"" Disney's sequel to the 2013 animated phenomenon, has set the record for the highest-grossing weekend in Thanksgiving history. It made $123.7 million domestically over the five day holiday weekend."
positive earnings while 3/4 of the business is shut down. priceless
AHHHH Everyone Sell!!! The Solo movie didn't do as good as the other blockbuster hits by Disney this year!! Still time to get out!!
Glad the market is closed on Monday so I don’t have to look at red to start my week...
To all the people doing Black Friday shopping... I have a deal for you. Look no further than Disney. “To infinity and beyond” - Buzz Lightyear.
RBC gave it a buy with a $128 target. Seems more reasonable this Mr. Rosenblatt whoever that is
"I feel I owe all the longs an apology because I know the true reason DIS is tanking today, it's because I bought it, so I apologise. If I would have not bought DIS on the good news after the ER, then I am sure it would already be up to $175 by now. I guess I could sell and take my loss and just take one for the longs team because I know as sure as the sun rises in the east the second I do it will take off like a rocket lol!"
"OMG, the overload problem means Disney need to buy more servers and bandwidth to run contents for unexpected number of services.... Subcribing is overload."
"""The company said it added 790,000 phone customers who pay a monthly bill in the fourth quarter, well above the average analysts' estimate of 525,000 subscribers, according to research firm FactSet."" > so I read 200K+ new adds over analyst estimates on the DIS+ factor!"
pumped for a release about info on bundles with HULU... :) I want to jump on the Hulu bandwagon..
"It's amazing how many ""investors"" believe that DIS's subscription service is going to bring DIS out of the depths of losing BILLIONS of dollars. DIS was designed for people engagement at its parks, cruises, hotels and watching movies on the big screen NOT sitting at home watching old DIS, Marvel, Pixar etc movies. The dividend has been suspended indefinitely, parks are still closed and losing billions, theaters are virtually all closed etc. DIS might be a buy at prices 50% or lower from these levels. DIS management need to show how they will get that personal engagement back at the parks, cruise, hotels etc AND NOT at 50% engagement! The parks were and ARE not designed to be profitable at 50% or even 75% capacity!!!!"
"Disney is a huge buy now. Do people not realise that amusement parks only generate about 35% of total quarterly revenue for Disney? And that’s going to shrink once Disney+ continues to gain subscribers. It’ll bounce back, I’m holding."
200 nearby
Netflix needs a Miracle! Disney controls all the content everyone wants to see! Disney is so valuable to Wireless plans even ATT is going to have to give it away for free!
"well,,,we are holders for a decade now,,,no growth in stock price,,,so when shorts cover we will see 120,,not until then,,"
Bob iger is the man!!!!he just released the Star wars trailer today 1 hour ago
645 Movies and Shows on Disney+!!! WOW!!!
We cancelled everything this year in Florida including Disney World. Let's see what happens next year.
"Hey @Joe ... going around saying ""No"" & ""Nope"" is not a great strategy to scare others into selling. Maybe try saying Disney is going bankrupt! Or some other troll like statement. None work, but at least put some effort in!"
nobody likes a down day but a beaten-down stock going into earnings is better than a hyped-up stock
Every stock is rising market is up. Disney earnings are good... what have Disney done to deserve this punishments from funds???
Wait for the First 30 min to pass. This is not smart money yet. They might wait till earnings.
$DIS is a fantastic company. Not worried
"When things open around summer , I would expect a special divvy to reward the shareholders."
Goodness what did they expect 100M+ subscribers by 1st earnings call
"I wouldn't be surprised if we see another hostorical, multi-year rally."
"Dis would be Smart to Pull All their Marvel, Disney, Lucas Film Content from Netflix. I'm ready to Purchase Disney Streaming."
I never thought I’d say this but some people should not invest their own money lol nothing has changed from the time you bought the stock except for the better but because the stock doesn’t go up every day or even drops it’s a pos... stock is like a pressure cooker it takes time to build up pressure then it shoots higher the weak hands sell and price has to readjust then accumulation starts again this is healthy and natural... this stock has hit ALL TIME highs twice this year expect this to continue at least through the next two quarters based on the news out
WE will Close$190.00
"You all have mentioned nearly everything, EXCEPT the new Lion King due out in July. The head of AMC suggested it may actually beat Avengers record. Both are Disney. Both are more than welcomed :)"
"So you picked up DISNEY, your getting paid to own the stock, you used discretionary monies, this is about the future, emotion, spend that on your love ones, your preparing for their future"
after market and pre market mean nothing anymore for disney. only thing to worry about is when and how fast is this going to the moon!!!!
Well color me shocked that a 10% gain the day after closing both parks and pushing back movie releases wasn’t built on a solid foundation
Streaming glitches mean the service is far Exceeding even Disneys expectations! Great News
"Disney is a great company and it’s stock will jump back up after this virus story goes away, because it will go away. The fundamentals are intact: great timeless content, tons of revenue streams, people around the world love the brand and everything it represents."
How much would this go up if they made an announcement that they were getting out of politics and intending to run this once great company based on business decisions?
Good numbers to see. Next quarter we break 100 million.
Wow Fox deal is going through
"So much to the $200s!!!! After hours was a bust, let’s see pre market and opening tomorrow"
I became a free general D23 member this morning and the Disney+ discount offer showed up on My Account page this evening. I haven't recieved the email but I don't need it now. Already signed up for 3 years.
"Matthew Lohr, calling for $175 per share in immediate future."
"Just bought 11 shares of DIS in my Roth IRA account, time to let them sit there for the next 40 years and let compound interest work its magic "
$400 by July 4th.
"We have now crossed under the 50 day Moving average. You can't expect it to just go through the roof without any facts. Buy the dips and let it ride. Netflix didn't skyrocket over night. It takes facts to do this like concrete subscriber numbers, which we won't get until the earnings release. After that then the questions will be growth and subscriber retention. Its going to take time to start moving the multiples."
Lots of room for divy increase. Buy
We’ll be opening the market on the greenside guys! Look at the pre-market price now! Seems like no pull back!
Ain't going down...GOING UP!!!
I'm not sure where to put my cash. Disney is my favorite stock. also have TGT and F. Ford announcing electric Mustang SUV next week.
DIS clever management knows how to enhance shareholders value.There is alot of upside potential coming very soon.

"Will the NBA coming back at Disney, this stock is heading up"
"If CA is opening theme parks soon, that is huge huge news..... should be close to $200"
"Mickey charging. I was afraid of some profit taking today, but we are still looking bullish."
"Back to pre panic price even before earnings! I predicted as much two weeks ago, and it has played off handsomely. You see the desperate post from J below? As the shorts begin to realize they are losing all profits from the recent dip, they will scramble to cover into close, and again at open tomorrow of earnings go as expected."
What is this stock even moving on? No news has happened
i am excited
"I'm new to this board, but very excited about owning Disney shares … The best is yet to come."
Below $110. Would love to buy this stock @$105 as an investment for 2020. Obviously the street has given up on this stock until we are done with the heavy spending to start streaming. I think Disney plus works but you need to buy it really cheap because it is dead money for until next year.
"I am rather new to all this. I have only 50 shares of Disney and I am making money so I am happy. Question, I see Disney has not split their shares in a very long time. Do you think sometime in the future it will happen. I would love to see lower share prices so I can buy more."
Can't stop the Mouse!
Mickey says believe in magic cuz covid will be gone one day
"The Dow is up, Disney down big time. This is only the beginning. Yes, there are still a significant number of Americans that are anti-communist."
in two weeks we should hear the approval of Disney buying fox. stock going to $120
this stock is a bargain today....you will wish you got in at this price
$MARK and $DIS have a confirmation on their deal as well —- here is the list ofDisney current supplier contracts. https://csimarket.com/stocks/suppliers_glance.php?code=DIS
Not interesting in owning any disney at the current price. The virus is changing the world and some things will never recover..... at least until a vaccine is available. And even then many people won't take a flu type shot. So the virus is not going away completely.
Wondering how much DIS share would be for earnings ? I expect $175 on Feb4th and $200 on Feb 5th.
Hopefully Iger will deliver some good news on the conference call and push the stock up.https://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/fb7mio2a
"Disney plus will allow Disney to cut out the middle man that sells and profits big time from Disney vacations, cruises,theater tickets, park admission and hotels. This will increase their profits and lower the cost for consumers. Not only will it be a HUGE increase in revenue but Disney will be able to advertise their parks, new movies, vacations etc on their streaming service free"
this stock should be over $450....
Do you think the older investors are too out of tune with the digital world? Maybe they don't understand that Disney is more than a toddler's tv channel?
"Comcast is such a #$%$, for both customers and competitors."
Disney to the moon tomorrow pump pump pump pump it up !!
So much cheering here
"ALGOS are selling this down, take advantage and buy the dip"
"Results are Ok, parks are still close, looking fully open by Q3, will wait for pull back, 170-180 handle for a position"
Approaching 52 week High with everything that is going on that is HUGE. Guarantee within 3 months analyst's raise target  price and rating. Don't Mickey around with this stock. Don't be Goofy stay Long and Strong
"I know Disney likes to celebrate Christmas early, but it's only September! This red, green, red, green business is way too early! Let's get through Halloween first!"
"Of all the streaming services to invest in which makes more sense and which has the better value? Disney, Netflix, and Amazon. The latter two are quite expensive already. I do have some AMZN but I place more of my money on DIS."
"Wouldn't be surprised if moved lower so money managers can swoop in and buy before close, hoping for a pop"
"It's impossible to time the buys just perfect. I buy when others are getting scared and selling. I have been buying DIS this way for years. Whenever I buy on dips, I'm always glad later and it usually turns out to be very profitable."
Disney can open up it's own Theaters now with the content it has and remove the need to split with theater owners and distribute their own movies.
why this high volume?
How much of a correction do u guys think Disney could go?
Can’t wait till Disney plus is available in the Asian market
Hope too many of you didn't follow that gambler that sold disney to buy target last Friday as that didn't work out at all.Do your own DD and don't take advice from people on a forum (including me lol!)
if it can close above 140... Zoomy Zoom :)
"I love when shorts start to celebrate a red day across the entire market due to trade wars. Like it has anything to do with the company, or can't end the day green or close."
"In last 5 years DIS revenue did not improve by 50% and the company is still not out of woods (means no profits this year) but share price is more than double in 5 years. In my opinion, retail investors should sell some of their holdings and book some profits at this moment."
Nice pop. Board seems a bit quiet. Wonderful company with all parks opening likely within the next 2 months. Streaming will only increase during this time. Not a bad idea to get in before this gets over $100 and doesn’t look back.
Here come all the analysts to the party. Let the upgrades begin.
From $183 to $160.
"POS Stock, don't stay in for the divvy, CD's pay a lot better..."
200 in a yr!!!!!!
Zippy do dah! To the MOOOON Alice! SMART Disney!
I've been following the online dustup over the firing of Gina Carano from the set of the Mandalorian by Kathleen Kennedy? No numbers are being outed but their are claims of large cancellations of Disney Plus. Anyone know if it's possible to get actual numbers anywhere?
STAR launches in 10 days and no ones talking about it (basically hulu launching internationally under disney+)
"Dinsey parks will be closed for 2 years. Movies will be closed for 2 years. Disney stores will be closed for 2 years. The company will go bankrupt. The only thing stopping bankruptcy will be a bailout but the stock will still be worth almost nothing. I easily picture the stock in the 50s during this crisis and would not be surprised if it dropped lower. Only 2 things can stop the virus: The majority of the population gets it and builds an immunity, or a vaccine. With social distancing it will take many years for the majority of the population to build an immunity (Based on 1% death rate and 240,000 predicted dead by Anthony Fauci), this equates to them predicting 24 million of the 350 million in the US will be infected. The vaccine, as was stated, early and often by the CDC takes 18 months between development and human trials. It will take a minimum of 6 months to mass produce and deploy to 350,000,000 people in our country or 7.8 billion people around the world. Anyone speaking of a few weeks or a few months either has an agenda (Keep the stock market from tanking) or is just being optimistic because the reality is a hard pill to swallow and does not know the facts. Look up everything I have mentioned and let me know if you find anything concrete to to argue otherwise. I have heard a world of quick turn around claims, but I have yet to hear any type of convincing argument that this will be less than a year with actual facts to back up the claim. I'd love to hear it and I'd love to be wrong but am afraid I am not."
I bought shares today between 146.25 and 146.39. the star wars movie reviews and impeachment rattled wall street. no need to panic.
"a lot of laugh out loud posts these past days, loving the banter. excited for next week. best of luck to the bears, I'm bullish here and am honestly surprised we're holding up so strong. Bring on June."
I know some people don't like Cramer but he has been a believer in Disney for a long time. And still is.https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/07/cramer-ranks-his-top-7-video-streaming-services.html
"Just think the success off of the already filmed starwars live action show and Loki show Disney + will have set to launch. To go along with the marvel universe properties that are already billion dollar franchises. Add in children programs, blockbuster movie vaults and much more. The upgrades are great but in my opinion still very underestimating."
$191 soon
"I question why Disney didn't get into streaming sooner. If they didn't give Netflix a head start, there would be no competition. Give it a year, there will be a new champion crowned in the streaming service cash cow market."
"now you have something for adults, incorporate FOX sports, all the pieces are there, why not combine,"
"Wow, was going to wait until tomorrow to add, just to be safe. But this NSX guy is making think I should just add now. When the shorts are this desperate things usually pop."
"My guess is that at complete random, some analyst will project earlier streaming profitability and it'll go nuts. May be tomorrow or months away. Hold"
"When shorts start trolling a stocks forum page, you know which direction it is headed in"
Wait until disney slides one ad before and after movie! It will become a 200 dollar stock!
why is disney down???
Anyone see another large dip like months ago? Or should I get in at 190 before parksOpen up and it likely rises
Market is now close.Time for ENDGAME.Love Disney!!!!!!
I cannot hear that guy that sold at the top (apparently) and is going to buy again at 138.Next time I call a Bull flag maybe he will listen instead of talking 
my daughter is asking for Disney movies and toys this year for Christmas
I’m more excited about this earnings then the super bowl on God
Dis is holding at 132 like a champ!I bet it holds at 132 tomorrow with zero difficulty! Have a great weekend Dis Fam! 
"Dont you lomgs understand that Disney is bleedimg cash and is deep in debt? Do you think the parks, resorts, cruises, movies, will open next month? And no, Disney+ will not offset all those losses. A $7 monthly subscription does not offset the losses from the other revenue streams."
We should see a very nice pull back on Disney load up around 150-160
Disney's Strategy Is Working https://seekingalpha.com/article/4312390?source=ansh $DIS
good to buy. Nancy Pelosis husband bought $200 call options expiring in March 2021. he will ask Yellen or Powell to pump the stock up if necessary.
Great report and we have a strong consumer!
"Like clock work. Cashed out my calls almost time to switch side on the puts and short this heavy back under $100...wash,rinse,repeat DIS is my little cash cow."
Disney already owns all their shows and movies . Unlike their competitors they don’t have to pay billions to lock in deals with actors and producers. They’re miles ahead of the game and they now own 20th century fox . This is a no brainer!
Streaming services go up anyway. Hold tight
DIS going to raise prices this year to offset loss in attendance?
"Bought another $40k at 138.02. Good timing for once, although I plan to hold for at least a year."
"BIG BEAT, GUIDE HIGHER, but what will Vinny do?"
European+Shanghai marketGreen today 210$+
"This is going back up to 200 soon with some volume, Ran on 2.6mil today when it usually averages at 16mil"
"Disney holders owe the Russo Brothers a huge thanks. Domestic is estimated at $250 million - this is an estimate of Disney - it could go a bit higher (or lower - and I bet higher - when you have such and over performer, Disney tends to be very much on the conservative side). Estimates, before opening, were between $190 to $235 millionThe worldwide, however, went much higher. than the original estimates of $450 to just under $500 million - it has turned in $630 million as an estimate, and, this, too, can go higher (and, if one looks at Black Panther, it usually does).These global numbers are even more impressive when one considers that China and Russia haven't opened yet (2 weeks and 1 week from now, respectively). By the time it opens in China, it will be somewhere over $1 billion - maybe $1.2 billion?? This movie could easily do $1.8 billion. And maybe $2 billion is not out of the question.The Russo brothers really know how to do a movie. We owe Josh Whedon an element of thanks - he did a great job with the first Avengers, but fell a little flat with the second one - and his efforts show just how hard it is for one person to do so much - the Russo, although Disney has characterized them as tiredless and enthusiastic, demonstrate that hard it is for one person to handle this franchise."
Knew they would hype the numbers. The problem is they are actually pretty slow growth on the Disney+. The 100million is the hype number. That includes all their subs from all services. Disney+ grew pretty slow over the last 2 months. Need to go back and read the previous numbers releases and factor in pandemic fueling a fire for streaming. I figured Disney+ would have grown to 75 million subs by now considering how cheap it is. Also they advertised about $1/2 billion for Disney plus on Facebook alone. The add spend exceeds the revenue for Disney+.
Going to 210-215 easy!
Disney stock price target raised to $165 from $128 at UBS!!!!
Newsom just banned public gatherings of more than 250 people.
"Not going to lie, I kind of regret selling at 130 because I thought there would be a significant dip to buy back in on but I don't see that happening. the news and outlook for the company is too strong"
This is the time to be buying. I'm an option trader and the 146 and 147s are looking pretty good going into earnings.
left cancelled the right during the pandemic. maybe tables have turned now.. would be great justice
This Saturday would be the bid day for Sky unless a player drops out. If Disney pulls it off Monday can bring some attention
"440 dow rally disney not participating,,,,,what is the issue here now"

"Six months ago we were at $141 so we have been sideways and consolidating for the past 1/2 year. Usually when you see this from a great company it takes a catalyst to break out of it and send it into space. That catalyst is the ER. If you been reading the tea leaves as I have, you can’t envision anything less than a blowout quarter. Everything riding on that. I am counting on the Mouse to come through. On to Pluto!"
back to 140 today
bought at 110 let's go to 150 or more love Disney
"Mulan to be released Marrch 2020, not an animated version. l believe Disney will rise, they are making great growth return."
Disney will be announcing that they made more money then any other company last year. And with that announcement... the shares will fall 20%.  Imagine if their movies tanked and Disney+ wasn’t a success.
"why it is going down , I dont understand the shareholder sentiment?"
"DIS up $ 5.00 / share, not too shabby for 1 day of work, looking forward for a Merry Christmas, going long"
Should be a nice correction on Disney it way over head
Disney is long and strong! Solid company and great fundamentals. Cheers!
I wonder if Dementia Joe knows where he is and what day it is?
Let’s go to $200
"loving this sideways move, helping me add bit by bit."
I'd bet Avengers Endgame will be the highest grossing movie of all time
Amazing company. Great Report. Unique world class assets.. Only question is if it is worth the current multiple. That will still be tested if the market softens.
"140+ is the target that DIS needs to break through, It will go through 140 like hot knife gets through the butter, when NFL draft choice will be big event that ESPN will shine on Wednesday."
Why is DIS still trading around 145? It should be trading around 175 will all the block buster movies in 2019!!!
Disney will blow it out If markets rebound Disney will be up 143 +Blow out will be 8+ added looking at Wendsday 150 Friday 155-160
Dis going to 200 quick. What type of parents wouldn’t buy Disney plus for their family? I already subscribed for a year for only $70
Netflix market cap 258 billion. Disney only 350 billion.
Do you guys think they’ll announce 4K streaming as a surprise?
Come Friday or Monday we are breaking $155. Frozen 2 will continue to break records this weekend all the while Disney+ will be watched and added by millions.
why is DIS down today so much
"The only mystery is what took Disney so long to ban smoking? It's a family themed fun park. Not a casino. And even then, some casinos are banning smoking too."
"do you see what I see, I THINK I see a HIGHER high coming "
How sad that the market moves up like a rocket ship and DIS barely budges.
As a long term holder (cost basis is $54/share) I would still like to see a more exponential per share price increase or a larger dividend. with the slew of new movies this year plus Fox acquisition plus streaming should make for good revenue increases.
I'm getting excited about my $55 puts bought yesterday just before the announcement of park closures
The trajectory of DIS this last year has been phenomenal. I'm all in. Cheers!
Amazing stock and amazing company. I bought more yesterday and today.
Mr market looks confused today. I just bought 73 shares. Bought previously at 130 sold at 140 at earnings. I expected a little pullback because of people like me but now I am long on this one.
"During a ""mass health world panic fear"" time such as now, people and their family(s) will look to stay as active and preoccupied as possible until all of this passes. Parents will want to keep their kids indoors as much as possible and when you think of all of the spring activities they will not be able to take part in, they will look to watch TV, movies and play games and so on; meaning that networks, streaming, gaming will simply explode in sales/subscriptions. Outside of the other big ""few"" names out there, adults/parents will miss Disney/Marvel right there with their kids and simply hit that 6.99/mo option. APAC/EU loves Walt Disney even more than the US when it comes to the people numbers, so expect 100+ mil DIS+ subs from EU from the March launch - April end of month = BANK ON IT $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
I bet everyone that got DIS as a result of the Fox merger has a Huge smile on their face about now.
"Lots of little princesses at the movie I attended, packed theater!"
Will the T problem coz DIS to go back under $99.99
Don’t let these day traders get you down as we witnessed yesterday we are one headline away from another new high. We launch in Australia on Tuesday and I’m guessing by next Friday we have 25m streaming business 
Just added a bunch to my shares. bought a few Sept calls as well :) Good luck to all ! :P
"Disney stands to gain during COVID and a democrat ran country. Disney's leadership for better or worse has strong ties to the democratic party with Iger running as ambassador for china. Strong growth ahead, $400 price target this year."
shoudlnt invest in disney i think
$150 will be a nice entry point.
Closed over $111!!! Cheers guys. Enjoy the weekend.
"These rich “1%” need to grow some thicker skin , cmon a democratic led government is not the worst that can happen. We had a republican led senate and house and I didn’t hear “ people saying the market need balance “ or more democratic influence."
Whats happening??
Big put options 
"Boom, my short position cashed out. Profit going up and down today. $3,221 gain. Holding February calls going into tomorrow"
This baby is never hitting the $130s again.
Great few days ahead. Looking forward to Iger’s interview.
"IMO look for DIS to acquire a content provider, it is the missing most important key to mindboggling success, VZ, T, Sprint, TMobile only options. They have massive content but no distribution. At the mercy of the most important aspect of outsmarting Netflix to the bank. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/john-malone-streaming-wars-media-154732445.html"
This hit $206.25?
I didn't buy more at 132 because the short said it was going to 130. I guess I won't listen to him anymore.
"Keep in mind, both ""China"" Parks from Disney are only 47 percent owned by the Walt Disney Company, with 53 Percent Belonging to the Shanghai Govt.Keep it also in check, that Disney Parks, is only 25% of their Income, with the above factors in placed, China parks represent a very small fraction of the Global portion that parks represent. If you go through the financials, it just does not pan out that closure of their two worst performing parks are attributing to this correction. The retail market is saying, ""I am scared. Here hedge funds, take my shares."""
Also remember $Dis disney is backing fubo heavily (directly in shares + the own 16% of Fubo's parent company Facebank group). They want a big piece of the sports betting pie  via Fubo because they can't roll out wagering on their own channels or in their own parks/cruises
Cause for the quick pop?
"Take some profits or hold because short term this could dip a little, long term this is a diamond"
We should see some upgrades to Buys or Overweight within the next week. That would be a big boost.
Disney announces they are reopening Disney Springs by May 24th.
Thank me at 140+ after 6PM today
It would appear a credit downgrade is good news...
Soon everything will open againBuy buy buy
Not just sold out at the movie theaters but also sold out in toys at most places. Man! Frozen 2 is really cracking the ceiling. #DisneyPrintsMoney
Disney plus is expected to make 3 billion dollar in 2021 so buy now at these low prices
"Longs, do not be afraid. The price of DIS has been upgraded. Big players are running the stops to drive down price so they can begin to accumulate shares at a lower price point. As they begin to buy shares, the price will steadily increase over the next several days."
very happy with today’s session. more + days ahead.
"The weekend results for Avengers Infinity Stone are beginning to come in. And the one that means the most is China. China's opening day, Friday, was about $70 million. That means about $200 million by the end of the weekend there alone.In the US it is somewhere between $55 to 62. Mothers Day may be hurting it a little. I say ""hurting"" because it has been running a few dollars more than Black Panther the last week or so, and it will probably fall short of Black Panther's third weekend amount of $66 million. Avengers had a lead over BP of just over $50 million yesterday. Black Panther will wind up with about $705 million (It had over $694 m as of yesterday, and is on its last legs. but Black Panther had very very very good legs, with little competition, and a bump from, ironically, Avengers. Avengers has a lot of competition, including Disney's Hans Solo - but maybe it can glean some nice money over the summer. In any case it should break $700 million, and be around $750 unless it collapses.China's opening day of $70 means an opening weekend of about $200 million, and a final number of over $300 million. Add that $300 to this weekend final numbers of a probable $1.45 billion (w/o China), and you have $1.75 billion. That means $1.85 billion is a given, and $2 billion very very very likely. I think you will see a final number of $2.15 billion.The interesting number popping up is India - which is nearly $40 million as we speak. That beats Jungle Book. And it means that India is becoming a market. With a billion or so people, it has a potential market of competing with China - think adding $150 million per picture to each Disney's movie. And maybe India can be a focus for the next Disney World project. Add Africa in, and you are doubling Disney's foot print in the long term. In a world looking for more and more leisure and entertainment, there is no better outlet for such wholesome entertainment, something that families crave.In the short term, last year for this quarter, Disney had three movies that garnered box office numbers that totaled $2 billion. Avengers, alone, will beat that number. $4 billion for Avengers, Solo, and Incredibles is looking more and more likely, and something nicely over that is looking like a possibility. Disney has been stashing away cash of late (as opposed to buying back stock), due to the Fox purchase, higher streaming cost startups, and paying down debt which has increasing interest rates. But maybe they will use some of this to buy back more stock. Next quarter will break $2 a share in profit. Easy. The only question is how much, how much will roll over into the 4th quarter, and how much the final year number will be - I've been consistent at $7 a share, and I'm sticking by it."
The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. Ive said it once! And ill say it again!
When will they bring back dividends?
Analyst gives disney 210-220$ pruce after earningsBuy cheap today
Box Office: ‘Star Wars: Rise Of Skywalker’ Suffers Massive 81% Plunge
Maybe people are starting to wake up to the power of Disney? The revenue they will produce will be significant.
200.00 club!! there's just a nice ring to that. Congrats to all the longs here.
"JIM CRAMER SAYS , DISNEY IS STILL MAKING MONEY, AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN AT 50% CAPACITY"
Standing in long lines for hours is just not my idea of fun.
"I'm just going to add to my position on any weakness, until the inevitable gap up due to the launch. I believe people will be shocked with the value and content. I is going to be a frenzy."

"I have a feeling this runs into earnings and gets to around $190 and unless earnings are absolutely incredible it will pull back and consolidate before moving back up. I hope I’m wrong I’d love to see it at $200 after earnings. Expected move is 8.9% after the earnings call. So in between $165-$200. That’s using today’s IV ATM strikes ...etc. the range is pretty wide. I also underestimated the numbers a bit , especially on IV. I hope we get to $200 "
2000 by Tuesday
This tanks back to.180 sooner than we think..Sold here gl.all
Easy beat... count on it. Digital growth huge. Stock will be up 10% in ah.
"Everyone is talking about 140. I'd like to see this stock get to 140.11354323108760. That specific number. Yes, that looks about right! Once it gets there, the entire world will hold hands and be happy."
Are we seriously heading for a $2.00 drop in price on literally zero negative news?
"As president of this board, i command all to but more DIS"
It's not only emotions but you have to look at the big picture. Do you think the Dow should be at 24k? Don't you think Q2 is going to be ugly? It definately is going to be. Then why is Disney valued at $100? Because we can see the light at the end of the tunnel for corona and Disney has Disney+/hulu numbers increasing. SImple as that.
There’s no reason why this shouldn’t be exploding with all the amazing news and revenue Disney has been bringing in. The future plans and path we are on are going to be huge for investors!
Closing Green
Bank of America analyst Jessica Ehrlich reiterated her Buy rating and $168 price target
Good news and stock falls it's a pretty good bargain
"Disney is a long term hold. Stop trying to buy today and sell tomorrow. I bought it 25 years ago. At 79. Rose over 100 and split 3 times since. Relax everyone. Think long term, retirement"
"Nice little bullish hammer candlestick today! If we are green tomorrow, that could validate today and cause a reversal upward. Then it's back up to 145+ in no time! (take note little joe, this is the polite way to make a prediction.)"
What time are earnings ?Anyone?
"Big gains yesterday, small pullback today. As expected."
"I’m long Disney but some of these PTs people are putting up is crazy. Hell DIS to 700$!  in 3 months!! Smh , I know some of you are happy, as am I but there’s a difference in being happy and having logic and being just beyond over enthusiastic and making no sense. It would take a small miracle for tbis to be at $210 by the 19th. It’s run hard, I hope we are in between $190 and $200 after earnings. We need a great call for that to happen. This isn’t a company with 60M float that swings up and down 20%+ on any news. The expectedMove is about 8.9% using fridays IV and ATM calls. so let’s just call it $65- $200 range. Most open interest and volume in ATM or NTM is 180c and $170p , that will change, but we have a huge call/put ratio. Prob about 5 to 1 last I looked yesterday early. Again, I hope this goes up but just protect your positions. I will probably buy a few butterfly spreads depending on IV on Tuesday and Wednesday. I’m also buying a few calls against my shares to protect them and be able to buy more at a lower price if it does happened to go down. Just my 2 cents! GL all kings!! I meant longs but my autocorrect fills in “kings” , I like the sound of it! So let’s go all long kings! . Hope everyone is ha I got a good weekend and keep your fingers crossed"
"Hey guys, just occured to me that since Disney has announced sold out Galaxy's Edge reservations and Hulu growth rate double Netflix, we should all buy NFLX stock. Makes sense right?"
"I didn't ever think I would see Disney in the 120's again. Coronavirus is a temporary cash flow issue. It will return to insignificance just as SARS and the H1N1 did. Nobody knows if this is a short term buy, but mid to long it looks like a strong buy here."
Very bullish. Sudden appearance of trolls confirms it
Once this week rolls through. I think we can see possible price target upgrades the following week.
"Is there going to be some Disney magic today after hours? Breaking out over $190? GLTA. I'd like to be anywhere in Florida right now, sick of looking at close to 3 ft. of snow sitting on my decks."
No reason why NFLX goes up $5 every day and Disney opens up then falls. Stock is being manipulated
Looking for upward movement in DIS tomorrow! So far I'm really liking all of their maneuvering in both the Fox and Sky deals!
I have been a huge Disney bull but Iger stepping down at this point is terrible. Things just went from bad to worse.
Oh my lanta. nearly 30 % up in just over a month. GO DISNEY
"Always buy best of breed. DIS, MSFT, AAPL, CRM, TGT, SBUX."
Disney will be the next NFLX in streaming
"Launch Nov 12, 2019 @ $6.99/mo. All the movies & shows will be available DAY 1. Just around the corner, lower than NFLX and will cost 1-2B over several yrs. The numbers look reasonable. And BTW the animation on the Lion King is absolutely SPECTACULAR."
I'm a buyer @ 100
"CHEERS TO ALL THE LONGS, WE DID IT!"
told my friends to buy more today we back in the green again
"Looking into solely the content that Disney is pushing out this year through movies alone is AMAZING!! Avengers Toy story 4 Aladdin The Lion King Frozen 2 Star Wars IXAre you kidding me??Oh and BTW, Disney + only for kids? Disney+ will dominate each and every area of the market. The Disney brand is for everyone. Oh and not sure if you realized that Avengers will break every record for revenue and viewership?  Stay strong longs!!"
Any chart experts think this goes green today?
Tendies?
Bought today.Highly oversold. Streaming service is amazing and will see a bump do to self quarantine peeps need to entertain themselves.
Anyone buying today?
Just watched the 5th episode of the Mandalorian. This show so far is phenomenal!!The High School Musical show they created as well is also great! I will be watching the new episode later tonight.
"Two downgrades today by two major analysts to 100.00 and 107.00, this after hour pump by company of money losing Disney+ is suspicious at best!"
"Disney will be catapulted to stardom when it has its new platform ready for everyone across the globe and collect results from Marvel, Pixar, etc. movies pending for this 2020 and 2021. This goes for long but I clearly see a price of 300 or more in 2021 or so. Your company policy allows you to accumulate money unlike Netflix that burns you nonstop. When the competition is 100% real between Netflix, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, we will see who has it bigger! Also the entire industry of merchandasing and amusement park behind Disney guarantee a slow but forceful rise. Come on Disney!"
The girlfriend and I were asking the kids if they watch Netflix and they said no. Found out they were paying for hulu on their own. Time to cancel netflix.
"15 minutes before the close, I sold April covered calls in QS and used to money to buy calls in $AAPL, $MSFT, $CRM, $DIS on the weekly in case we get a reversal tomorrow. Little play for fun with free cash from the covered call."
"I don’t get Disney at all . They were absolutely crushing it last year in every way shape and form. their stock surged a couple of times and then gradually went back down and then went stagnant and then tanked from the virus. Now their only revenue is streaming and merchandise, but they still have massive compounding Dept and it’s holding strong in the 90 $100 range . It should be around 40.00 considering the fact that when DIS was roaring on all cylinders the stock would barely movie"
Heading to 152 now
Really low trading volume on this stock. Looks like most people are holding. Let's hope for good headlines from Star Wars land.
"Why is wallstreet against DIS? Killed estimates and still not budging? Netflix doesn't even make money and the stock goes up,up,up! Please help me understand."
World record box office receipts for Disney this past weekend. Be ready for Disney stock to show a 3% rise today to $202.
Sell or hold?
"Just sold my DIS position that I've been holding since $104. I love everything Disney, but I believe pretty much everything is priced in at this point. Here is where I'm having trouble seeing DIS stock moving much higher... I realize that parks and studios are doing great. But let's face it, the story of this stock is about streaming. It has been since ESPN subscribers started jumping ship. So if we take the current projections that DIS will have 160M subscribers in 3 years, we can do some quick math. In comparison, NFLX has 149M subscribers now, so the following math assumes DIS surpasses NFLX, which I believe is very possible, but is as rosy a projection as we could reasonably apply at this time. Anyway, at $7 a month, DIS will be adding approx $1.1B in revenue every month. That's $13.4B a year. DIS currently makes $60B in revenue a year, so we're looking at a 22.5% tailwind for the stock. I bought the stock at $104 and sold it at $145, making roughly 40%. I understand that there may be additional revenue growth from both the parks and studio divisons."
Netflix disappoints - Business as usual for DIS tomorrow!
"The quarter has ended, and it is my turn to give you some earnings prediction for the next quarter.I use the same quarter from last year as a basis. I compare the various segments.Last year Disney made $1.95 a share. The first segment I will look at is Parks – they are as busy as ever, and then more. They have increase prices. They have opened Star Wars at Disney World, and nothing is stopping them – add 10 cents.TV/Media: ESPN has been pulling it down. ABC et al has been exploding. But ESPN has leveled its expenses. And cable cord cutters may be leveling off. I’m going to add 5 cents.Movies – through the roof. Last year they had Avengers, then Star Wars Solo (a dud), and then The Incredibles. As much as it seemed impossible, End Game beat its predecessor by about $700 million, and then Aladdin broke the Memorial Day jinx for Disney. Ironically Toy Story is not beating the Incredibles’ numbers, but I’m going to ignore this. Also Dumbo had a chance to add some real income opening at the end of the prior quarter, but may still add. X-men hurt, reeling in a otherwise fantastic quarter. Video releases may be limited too, but I am also going to ignore that. I am going to add 25 cents. Royalties/license fees – Avengers had a record $150 million, and then Toy Story matched it (or close to it), and I don’t think that includes the toys sold through licensing. And then add Aladdin. And nearly all of this is profit. I would suggest that you add 10 cents.That would give you $2.45 cents a share. But Disney said at the last cc that there were Fox dilution and streaming costs of about 70 – 75 cents a quarter. But I think that is just too much. I think it’ll be about 50 cents. That means about $1.95.But really think that Disney is trying to make as much as it can on a quarter to quarter basis. Before, Disney had reasons to keep earnings down just a little. Maybe they were trying to avoid anti-competition issues in trying to get SEC approvals and the like. Maybe there were other subtle issues, such as timing and taxes (on this last issue, they are using a lower rate than last year due to tax law changes). But now all gloves are off. Add 25 cents. I think that 2.20 will be the number"
"Prediction: Tomorrow will be green. Nothing astronomical, but it will be green."
I need this to pop back up at yesterday’s high almost 198 the vaccine supply for everyone Texas re opening Disney Parks this has to move on this news
3 days Powell speaking markets always reversed
"When Disney announces its parks will remain closed past April 1st, this will fall much faster."
I think the train just left the station
"Hey math guys, so here's a thought on revenues. At what point do deep investors and the street start to crunch the numbers on lost revenue in China vs what the DIS+ sub revenue is/will bring in from the US - EU/APAC starting next month. I also tend to look at an SP valuation based on future forecast projections to that of the street ....so if DIS was at 116 pre-streaming announcement last April my ? is at what SP price point does the market essentially say ""hold the line"" on the stock. If you recall DIS tended to become quite the safe haven to hold during recent spike downturns in the market over this past year (specifically), so now you have a ""flu bug"" being manipulated via the world wide web, a CEO who wants to ficus on the new streaming business which officially puts Disney in a hybrid crossover entertainment - media tech industry(s),and keep in-mind I am saving the best part of my personal analysis/theory for very last ""The world loves Walt Disney and the world will absolutely confirm that over the next 3 months when the subs double+ what we have already in the US > hint 29 million .......so average down because its the 800 lb gorillas in any industry which will always recover first/fastest during these 2001/02, 2008/09, 3rd/4th Q 2014, etc....."
DIS is down due to coronavirus which give traders a reason to take profits. THANK YOU! I am buying on all dips and running to the bank.
"I'm new at this. Half position in $BABA, half on $DIS...what can I do? Greetings to all from Argentina"
with the sell of Fox sports division it should be positive for the stock and bump the price.
"Wow, I really thought the jobless numbers would have a greater impact. The market jump is...strange."
Let’s get back on track!
Iger and co plan to reopen Florida parks April 6th. I have a vacation club source.
Buy buy buy. It’s gonna go up Tuesday. Happens every long weekend
"Expect constant and consistent ongoing upward earnings revisions as DIS goes OTC direct to consumer. Ironically, cord cutting that hurt the company is going to help their margins immensely as DIS cuts out all of the ""middle men"" in distributing their content."
$112+ looked much better. Dividend on the way.
"see 134.60! sell your DIS now, it's going to drop, i know in next 12 months disney can go up 150$-170$, but right now it's dropping, you can let your money sit out, come back to buy DIS when trade war end, you can save a bunch of money."

"Lets hope The Falcon and Winter soldier is a heck of a lot better than the WandaVision snooze fest. WandaVision was also dumbed down as much as it possibly could have been. Thankfully I fast forwarded most of the show to not waste hours. If you absolutely have to watch it, skip episode 1, watch episode two (you can fast forward a lot of it) and then skip to last episode. You won't miss a thing."
Stop posting political bs in here. This is stock message board. Post relevant thoughts and commentary on the company and the stock. Jeez.
Disney wants to play SJW Activist.They might have made a lot of money on Marvel and Star Wars based on the Pre Disney memories of what they were but they are ruining those brands.
AMAZON DEAL!
"This is really quite overwhelming. Having been boosted by the wonderful presentation at investors' day, Avengers End Game exceeded even lofty predictions - it may even hit $330 domestic, and over $1 billion worldwide is a given (at least in my opinion). This has propelled it this week from the low 130's, to just short of 140 (and after hours has it up another point to almost 141). You have another event in about 10 days - earnings. Analysts have it pegged to around 1.58 - last year it 1.84. But this year we have a lot more headwinds, and Disney has told this quite clearly (primarily movie timings and sales of dvd's). Disney does have continued strength in parks as a positive, and some tax benefits. But I am worried that they might disappoint - but we will see how the market reacts - it may be that they really don't care. And, if Disney is on the plus side, they will run higher. But we may finally have a run on Disney. I, personally, believe that investors want to invest in Disney - it is a nice wholesome producer or products, and find it a safe haven, but want the ""hot"" stock while Disney might be considered ""boring"". But boring no longer!!! And, if it runs to 150 next week, gets some boost from earnings, sees good openings for Aladdin and Toy Story, and then a good opening for the Star Wars Park in California, we could see 160 - 170. Then, you might see some boosts from Lion King, and a wonderful report for the April - June quarter. This may put it into 170 - 180. When Disney Plus opens, and if it opens well, you will be pressing 200. If it can break 200, you have a stock approaching the Apple / Amazon models. But Disney, unlike those companies, have real assets and real income.This has been a very satisfying two weeks, I rode Disney from the teens till now. I added at various points, I have told friends and family to get in (with various results). They have given me a hard time for the past 3 years as Disney has bounced around. And, for at least the past 2 weeks, I have been able to say I was right."
"is DIS is valued the same way as NFLX, it would be a $500 stock. way undervalued company's"
"Wishing everyone a nice Easter and Passover Weekend. What a turn around for DIS, long time coming. Kinda wish the market was open tomorrow when my kids are home from school and fighing with each other. :P"
DIS is my stock of the year for 2018.
Bargain price vs netflixBuying more on monday
What causing the downside? Anyone? Cheers
Word is is getting out on the sleeping giant.
"Next quarter the losses will be covered with the Disney+ revenue, Bob Iger really created something called Disney+"
"Just checked Santa's Wish List, #1 is Disney+ in every country in the World!!! Disney will become the most Valuable company ever!!!"
Buying AMC. They will run the new Avengers movie 24/7 in multiple screens in every theater !
"Everyone is focusing on D+ as if that's the only cards Disney has in its deck. Crazy thinking. Ups and downs, shorts and longs. Bad news and good news - Disney will prevail longer than any of our lifetimes."
I have most of my long term inv money in Disney
"Walt Disney (DIS) PT Raised to $168 at BofA/Merrill Lynch, Added to US 1 List"
cancel culture can work both ways as I cancel my disney trip and subscription. my daughter isnt going to be happy but she will have to deal
I smell $200.
"Remember it’s all about transitioning the business to subscriber based revenue. Keep in mind that subscription to Disney plus will have a very small impact on the Disney Movie club revenue. Why you ask? Disney movie clubs get early release of new films such as the new Frozen 2, Disney subscribers don’t get access to this movie for a few more weeks. From personal experience, I’ve been a Disney movie club member for a few years, we subscribed to Disney Plus thinking we would just get rid our Disney Movie Club subscription and save some money, well guess what? We didn’t cancel because we don’t want to wait a few more weeks to see Frozen 2. Disney sure know how to do business. I put my money where my mouth is I currently hold 618 shares at 138.47 cost basis."
"I'm a huge disney fan but I honestly think that this stock is dead money right now. In the long term, there is a lot of upside but I just don't like all of the what ifs (fox deal and streaming service). Disney is fully capable but its going to take a lot of work. Selling my position today."
Now is not the time to be holding pricey equities.
"I’m a huge DIS fan and also stockholder. I have no plans on selling my stock anytime soon, but I do believe DIS will be range bound until the FOX deal closes. There has been some regulatory pushback in Latin America (ie: Brazil & Mexico). There are many catalyst to support strong growth and DIS stock price appreciation."
"The question is, do I trust that Disney Plus+ will keep this stock at a slow but steady increase, or do I pull out now before the media crushes this stock in the next week."
I watched end game yesterday. It was a great movie!
"The world is just overreacting (like they always do) to the Coronavirus right now and those fears are holding down DIS. Once it blows over and everyone finally realizes that the world is not coming to an end, DIS will immediately start reacting as if they actually had a good fourth quarter. I am actually glad for the overreaction as it provides a great buying opportunity to turn a quick profit when the fear subsides and the share price goes up."
Love how a movie can “crush” opening weekend with 25 mill and Disney’s latest openings have been 4 times that or more
just got in on DIS today....see what the rest of 2018 brings it... expecting good things to start happening :)
It is very strange that DIS did not raise its dividend.
If you are interested in the daily and cumulative box office for Frozen 2 - here is a link. https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2424210945/?ref_=bo_hm_rd

I have a portfolio of 9 stocks and DIS is my best performing one so far. My tech stocks have earnings coming soon. Great job Disney!!
"I'm loving these continual upgrades, but I'm a little worried that we are still within the triangle range. We need to break out of 119 in order to break the triangle. Otherwise it's a few more months in the pattern. Here's to hoping! Go DIS go!!!"
Next week boom  boom  boom  110.00 tell all your friends get in the train  because it going to the moon 
Hey guys do you think its too late to get in? Should i wait after pr before earnings
Today we break 180$
Get ready!!!!Been waiting for this and this is just the beginning!!!!!
Um.. I just went negative hmm..
Can Disney reach 120 a share?
all the disney employees were laid off a yr ago massive cost savings and many leases dropped a lean mean entertainment machine ....will print money as far as the eye can see
The bears have exited the chat
"Netflix's stock falls 1.3% premarket, after Disney unveils $6.99/month streaming service"
"HULU's news of 25MM users is pretty good new. They also mentioned 1.5B in advertising revenue in 2018. I still think that is the difference between HULU and Netflix (not necessarily saying HULU will be more successful, just that they are different). What also makes a HULU customer worth more than a Netflix user is that they have can buy so many add ons... Live TV, Ad free, etc.I hope that Disney+ and ESPN+ eventually become add on's once Disney has majority stake. If they let you add each for like $3/mo it would be fantastic as both a customer and investor."
Disney on fire :) & more marking joes as spam and muting!!! more fun ahead
"After Disney buys the rest of Hulu, can’t they just turn that into a subscription content behemoth like Netflix and put all the Marvel, Lucasfilm, Pixar as well as everything else they own on to that platform and just build off of that?"
"As bullish as I am, I cannot say I expected $117 today. Disney seems to buck the overall market sentiment often."
Once all products line are up and running DIS will be $300 easy.
"Yes, Walt Disney just reported a bad quarter. Yes, the miss was almost entirely due to worse-than-expected performance at Disney ’s newly acquired 21st Century Fox properties.But nothing has changed in the part of Disney ’s future that matters most for investors: its direct-to-consumer streaming potential. The outlook there is still upbeat, and so is our view on the stock. Barron’s has long been bullish. (See “Working More Magic at Disney,” Dec. 28, 2018; the shares have returned 30.5% since then, versus 19.6% for the broad market.)On Tuesday evening, Disney posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and revenue below analysts’ expectations, sending its stock (ticker: DIS) down nearly 5% the following day. The biggest shortfall to estimates came from poor performance at the newly incorporated TV networks, film studios, and international brands that Disney acquired from 21st Century Fox in late March. ( Fox [FOXA] and Barron’s parent company, News Corp [NWSA], have common ownership.)The addition pushed Disney’s third-quarter sales up 33% from the same period a year ago, to $20.2 billion, but the new assets didn’t earn as much as Wall Street had expected. They cost Disney 60 cents per share in its third quarter, versus guidance of a 35-cent drag. Disney’s overall earnings came in 22% below consensus at $1.35 per share.But 21st Century Fox is just one part of the Disney story, and there’s no new reason to doubt the long-term bullish case for the stock. Disney’s deep and valuable content library, its global brand, and its ambitious approach to direct-to-consumer streaming have set it up for continued success in both its legacy and new businesses. And Disney management repeated its prior forecast that the 21st Century Fox deal would add to Disney’s earnings per share in fiscal 2021 when big cost savings kick in.“In our view, the investment thesis is the same, and if we liked the stock before earnings, we love it on any weakness,” J.P. Morgan analyst Alexia Quadrani wrote after Disney’s earnings. “With so many moving pieces between the newly acquired Fox and Disney+ launch, there are bound to be some hits and misses each quarter.”She sees November’s launch of the Disney+ streaming service as a catalyst for the stock and reiterated her Overweight rating and $150 price target—about 8% above the recent $139.20."
like I said Friday in the $200 house next week $210
"My guess would be 5-6 more upgrades going into shareholder day next month, moving the stock into the$125 range may/june, then $150+ before end of year"
"Short term Disney is overbought. It has been on its upper end of its chart for awhile and I have been waiting for a pull back. It’s lower end is around 108, and upper end is 117. Right now it will stay between those ranges and I expect they will use results to shake it down between 112 and 108. Long term Disney is still undervalued, and after merger will have potential for significant upside in just a few years."
"Look at that, over $107, Mickey High Five."

Will see $110 tomorrow.
bleeding stops today. tomorrow we Rise!
I usually stop in to point and laugh at the Disney shorts. They are gone again today :( Tommy? Tim/Ulrich/5 account guy? It's just not the same board without them.
NBA is paying Disney almost 2 mill per day. Next season will most likely be played in Disney as well.

Friends buy Taop stock soaring
Move this stock today another 3
If you can't close green on a day like today you have serious issue.
"You read it here first via CNBC just now ""Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne boldly states and even bigger initial footprint in Europe next month when DIS+ launches there!"" = WOW!!! .....and Disney + NFL pact coming simply amazing!!!"
with 160 upgrade to buy.. i am in..
"Disney stock in a nutshell, ""The operation went great, but the patient died anyway""."
disney people are fanatical......almost brainwashed by mickey mouse......this should be 500 per share.....
"With the success of Dis+ , did Disney leave a lot money on the table? What I mean is, they could have charged 7.99, 8.99, 9.99. When is a good time for them to raise the price? When will discuss additional content creation for the service because this is very limited release? When do they split? Too many thoughts and all lead to increased prices in the shares."
Cramer says BUYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
it will close at high of the day
What is your DIS entry point?
Today disney citigroup target raised to $160
How does this Comcast all cash offer impact Disney?
volume today was more than double than the average volume which indicates that the market believes that this is a good price to buy in. these price levels won't last for long
price bounced off the 200 day moving average at 103.47 and support level at 104 range. a few days of consolidating here and then the stock should move to resistance at the 109 level then hopefully on to 113.00 next
Any less than $250 is way toooo undervalued this at the moment.
Hulu numbers releasing today would be beautiful
"Market has been taking a few days to reward good ER, it'll go up to 105 in the next week"
"Dips are scary, keep backing lower, watch out."
Who all has purchased Disney+ this morning!
This pandemic will end and Disney isn't going away - smart to close stores. Buy and hold.
$MSFT and $DIS make up 90% of my portfolio haga
Everything is gonna keep growing with Disney even with covid
Anyone notice Disney is just like Ford? A range trade.
I bought a Disney + subscription for my daughter and she made me watch the movie Starstruck. I actually enjoyed it. Another reason more me to own more Disney.
Who would sell before Disney+ is released to Europe and India next month. It’s an easy 20-25M more subs very quickly.
This might explain that push at the end of the day. https://www-fairfieldcurrent-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.fairfieldcurrent.com/2018/11/29/walt-disney-dis-stock-rating-upgraded-by-imperial-capital.html/amp?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQECAFYAQ%3D%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairfieldcurrent.com%2F2018%2F11%2F29%2Fwalt-disney-dis-stock-rating-upgraded-by-imperial-capital.html
does tarriffs effect this company?
13 days away from earnings!!!!! LETS GO!!!!!
This stock is so manipulated
Great earning report! Just increased my position by 75 shares
"honest insight here.... clearly there are paid commentators that negate this stock or there just salty from a previous loss. DIS is a great company and has many different ways of making money. I see this going more up then down every day. That said, DIS is an investment. the fact that they have to bring up a PREVIOUS story just to try to negate the stock is sad. Even if true, they pay a penalty and move on. Have you not seen the box office smashes the lines at the parks. the $10 Mickey ocean cream bar. c'mon people as long as disney keeps firing which they are you will be more than fine owning it. The lion king and Avengers box office receipts weren't even factored into last earnings because it takes a few months to generate true number. Can you imagine the revenue for the quarter coming up when you include those receipts. oh and btw I dont have a position in DIS bit looking to get into these attractive levels. GLTA"
Imagine when Apple buys the streaming services at Disney
I laugh at all you fear monger people on here. They have a lot more business than the parks. I promise this: 1) after the virus has been defeated or subsides the parks will be packed again. 2) Sports will resume (think ESPN). 3) Movies will be released (some on demand). This stock is a value at 80. I am in at 80 with a large stake. How do I know? I have fought the traffic around disney every day for the past 20 years.
Frozen 2 was incredible. Another billion dollar movie on the way for Disney content!! #winwinwin
Disney price and volumes up because it's obvious they will acquire Fox...Comcast price and volumes is up because shareholders are glad to hear Comcast won't shoot themselves by being the most indebted company ever...it's clear both sides want Disney to have Fox. Roberts just needs to realize that and let it go.
The Gained some/a lot of subscribers this last quarter which makes sense but doubt there will be another additional push as their target market is already signed up. they will be lucky to hold onto what they have right now.
the movie theatres depend on disney for revenue not the other way around. disney can survive with out the theatres. the pandemic is proof
So much negativity here. If you're looking at buying or selling Disney shares and looking for advice or guidance and you look here. Click on the person's name and it will show you all the other posts they've done. If they are trying to help or not help Disney. Some are so negative and almost or always negative that they just want to pull you down.
"in december when Disney made a deal with fox,,,stock was 109,,,"
way undervalued......$300 range next month
buy more. good downgrade that allows me add more position.
"Would like to hear others thoughts on whether you think Comcast can stilk outbid and steal FOX from Disney . My rationale for why I think Disney/FOX combo will happen:1) Political Support for DIS/FOX deal...Trump congratulated Murdock and Iger on the deal. DOJ that is opposing TWX/AT&T deal part of Trump and US Govnt.2) Murdock family and FOX shareholders prefer to own DIS stock instead of CMCSA. Perceived better long term value 3) DIS has foot in the door already. Iger has met with Murdock’s and top FOX executives and has already applied for regulatory approval. Yes, there have been deals like this in the past where someone swooped in and stole target company from original acquirer. I don’t see this happening here.4) DIS could easily match or top any rival bid from Comcast given its strong liquidity and underlevered balance sheet.5) Stronger and Natural Synergies with DIS/FOX deal (ie Avatar, Star Wars and Marvel)6) Even if TWX/AT&T deal goes through, a DIS/FOX deal would still go through less scrutiny than CMCSA/FOX deal 7) TWX/AT&T could challenge and unfavorable court ruling in March 2018 which could delay a final decision for over a year, at which point DIS/FOX deal may be close to already received all regulatory approvals."
"DIS is yet to launch to other countries where Netflix already operates. By comparison, DIS took significantly less time to build 10M subscriber base than other streaming providers such as Netflix or Hulu or CBS. I feel the stock has potential to go up to 150 easily, soon."
just saw infinity war. Pretty intense.
Disney reopen on April 30
Why going up again?
Rise of the Resistance￼ is out of the world. Should boost park sales before earnings!
Monday open 130.23 close 135.73
if netflix adds 8.8 million and stock is up $10 after hours. and Disney adds 70 million. does this go up $80 a share? i say yes.
This great earnings report already priced in now...take your profits and run...the big boys will tomorrow...beat em to the punch
"Market Chatter: Walt Disney Company, Fox Deal to Get OK in Brazil on ConcessionsBY MT NEWSWIRES — 02/26/201905:30 PM EST, 02/26/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Walt Disney Company's (DIS) $71 billion deal to buy media assets from Fox (FOX, FOXA) will be approved by Brazil regulators on Wednesday after Disney (DIS) promised to divest some assets, according to Bloomberg.Disney (DIS) agreed to antitrust regulator CADE's demands to sell Fox sports and all the broadcast rights, according to the report.A similar approval is on tap for Mexico on the same terms, it said."
Anyone else catch what Dana White said after the Mcgregor vs Cowboy match? He said streaming numbers were crazy high for the UFC and ESPN did an amazing job marketing it. Disney owns ESPN.
Did someone come out will a bad recommendation on Disney - this might explain the drop today.
Looks bad today but expect analyst to crunch numbers for oversubscribed disney plus and upgrades next week.
"Institutional investors now hold 68% of all Disney stock smart money is buying Disney Streaming business is up 19% yoy so Disney will continue to grow....Last figures I’ve seen in print Disney, Hulu and ESPN have 45m streaming customers in less than one month "
"My guess is most of you are under 50 years old. The 50 share I bought 30 years ago at $79, between stock splits and dividends are now 500 shares without putting in another penny. Todays people have no patience. Want instant results. Disney will split again at about 122."
GAAP (General Accounting priciples) shows a loss of $2.62 /share....adjusted earnings are just make believe. Take $4.7 billion loss and simply divide by 1.8 billion outstanding shares. Not pretty.
Disney long forever!!! Proud to be an investor. May we see new highs soon.
Here’s my math150 million subscribers times 12.99 per month times 12 months just over 23 billion in revenue.Call me crazy
"Disney vs. Comcast: Who will win FOX? Th battle will begin tomorrow when federal judge Leon rules on the AT&T Time Warner deal tomorrow. DIS stock action past few days suggests the smart money thinks judge may rule against the AT&T Time Warner deal and as a result there will be no competing bid from Comcast. Or, that DIS will ultimately win a bidding war for FOX that won’t be too dilutive. I don’t see any way that Comcast would win Fox over Disney. Curious to here others thoughts 1) Murdock’s prefer Disney are are large shareholders/voting power. Rupert would rather chew glass then sell to Comcast.2) DIS is better strategic fit (Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, ESPN) and best in class at monitoring content across its vast media empire. 3) DIS all stock offer is a tax free spin to FOX shareholders. Comcast’s all cash offer would be a tax event. 4) DIS has a 6 month head start over Comcast on Regulatory approval.6) DIS has balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity to win a bidding war. I guarantee DIS will match or exceed CMCSA bid 7)Trump showed his support by congratulating Rupert Murdock when the deal was announced. Yes, Trump is not the DOJ but his opinion does have value. Look at AT&T trial...Trump was public ally against this deal.9) DIS has no bad history with DOJ and clearer path to regulatory approval. The DOJ does not like CMCSA...much more difficult path to regulatory approval. 10)On 6/7/18, DOJ issued comment saying that DIS used precision in structuring its deal for FOX from a regulatory perspective. This removes regulatory uncertainty. 11)) DIS has lined up cash financing in event FOX board demands some cash to counter a bid from Comcast."
Well Lookie here.....CNBC just reiterated on Half Time report that Iger comjng on after the market closes between 4 and 5. Like I said he isn’t come on unless we are talking about a Blowout ER. IMHO. :))
"Some Thanksgiving thoughts.Thor seems steady reaching around $310 - 340 million. probably about 320 - 325. It could go a little higher, or a little lower. Justice League is hurting it a little. Foreign is probably around $520 - 525 million. If either of these numbers expand a little, that will help it break $850 million - but that will be tough given the competition from Justice League, and then Star Wars.Coco seems to be coming on strong. It is tracking behind Moana, but its reviews are very strong, and the movie goers seem to love it. It may be hurting a little from Wonder's wonderful showing - and kudos to this family movie. I think Coco should easily break $200 million domestic (unless it is hurt by Star Wars)."
"People can scare Disney stock holders as much you want but Disney is growing since Covid-19 will be over soon. And Disney is strongest stock in the market. Non stop growing. Don't forget movies! Disney own movie studios as well. So when cinema are open, Disney will earn even more money.Bearish people want this stock to fail because you have ""call"" on lower price. And calls expire this Friday. And you lose lots of money."
the reversal back up has started :) my options for Friday are now profitable !! this is going higher by Friday so keeping them another couple days.
Anyone hoping for a 15-20% downside correction?
"Disney could put Netflix out of business. While Netflix, with no P/E and drowning in debt, Disney already owns its own content, has Hulu, and is able to multiply its earnings in first run movies, with merchandise and theme parks. Disney also has the sports which Netflix is spending like crazy to match. Disney has a P/E around 14."
"I have a DIS stock account and automatically reinvest, but have not received my January dividend? ???"
Seems Gamestop is worth more than Disney . Is this real life? 
Betting on Disney with Frozen 2 is like betting at ER but with surely win. Disney knows how to attach younger audiences and build a loyalty base all the up. #DisneyPrintsMoney
Wells gives #Dis an upgrade this week and it goes down. Now same with AMZN.
Come on 117!
with a covid vaccine theme parks are gonna open up so bump in around Q3 ?
"Am I the only one scratching my head over this price movement? Still not covering, but it just goes against all reasoning right now. Is it going to keep going or is it being propped up? I can always cover and rise up but just doesn’t make any sense at the moment. Sure $79 was too low to fast but up this much is just as concerning. Even if over sold a 60% increase this fast is just odd especially with no real catalysts"
"WOW was expecting a boost from Comcast but bigger than I expected. This is not the same as Pixar, marvel, or Lucas deals and will be the real test for Disney management. What will they do with fox content? Regional sports as a bonus espn service is gone. What will they do with Hulu. I’ll be waiting in anticipation"
I just bought more. This is down because people actually think apple TV can compete? Wait for the numbers.
"COWEN CLAIMS 24 MILLION SUBS TODAY! 175 SOON!Disney+ has signed up an estimated 24 million subscribers in the United States, according to new research from Cowen & Co.https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2019/12/18/streaming-roundup-disney-dinging-netflix-per-new.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoo"
Falling hard.
double standard America will stay divided
I’m guessing quite a few people in here bought Dis around 120+
Keep buying more.Definitely it goes up to 200 or more.
Engame is certainly not the end:-Lion King-Alladin-Toy Story-Frozen 2 - might have a chance at competing with Endgame

"At least it's green, and it's early."
I really hope this pops off tomorrow. All I'm left with is why?
"classic Disney. 1 step forward, 1.275 steps back. such a great company but nobody cares. quick, where is the next multi billion dollar losing tech company promising personal jet packs in 25 years"
my cost basis per share is $139.52. i’m happy no matter what.
"If you like ol' Dis, you'll love their cancel-culture activities: ""I woke to this Gina Carano story. Seriously, a woman who speaks the truth — absolutely speaks the truth about the left’s attempts to dehumanize their fellow Americans — is canceled by Disney?"" I wonder who will be next by this once great American company?"
"WAY overpriced. Damn. Even at 120MM subscribers and assuming they ALL stay on once their free trials expire and assuming that EX-US still pays $8/mo (which they do not) and assuming they have HUGE margins of 50% on streaming. That is still less than $6 billion/yr in profit. Even if you assign a multiple of 20x on that that BEST CASE scenario in 4 years for their streaming business is already priced in and their current valuation priced in at 3 times that. Unless you price their streaming business at 50x multiple as assume unrealistic payment and margins this thing is just not quite there. I love Disney (stock, I don't actually own a TV), but profits needs to catch up a bit."
Disney for the win!
"I'll take $160 for $10,000 Alex."
"So let me understand the new game in this market. Profits, sales, and income do not matter. No one cares about dividends. And because subscriptions are the only positive number for this troubled poorly ran company, Disney is now a streaming service and we are supposed to pretend there are no theme parks, no empty studios, no cruise ships, no hotels at 20% capacity? It is just valued on $6.99 subscriptions ? Shouldn't it be an 80 dollar stock then? What am I missing. Disney is bleeding cash and piling up losses, and it it more valuable then ever before? Robinhood may be nice for the market, but the fraud is not going to go on forever. At some point they will have to move out of the parents basement and buy a jet, two Teslas and subscribe to Disney Plus. This valuation on DIS is just stupid ridiculous."
let it snow let it snow..
100 million disney plus subscribers coming by earnings?
See you at $200! Bingo!
Waiting on CC and it'll go up to 140
Guys More UPGRADES are going to Bump it to new heights.
"ok I'm bored and have some time to kill and wants some opinions; how many of you think majority of consumers with kids will own both Netflix and DIS+? I'm not sure why everyone is hyping up Disney to kill Netflix, I feel like most white collar households will just have both since DIS+ will be so cheap?"
It’s going to fly when the virus lifts
Year of the disney double. look for 200 year end.
This breaks 144.18 and it's going to 145.18 fast! Buckle up!
been a good 6 months. thanks to the announcement of Disney+ it’s been able to go higher. 6 months from now should be in the 170-180.
Hello all New to the Disney family jumped in yesterday and I’m so happy I did
"my situation today. I am very long DIS and AAPL. I also own a small position, relatively speaking, in NFLX. NFLX pays me no div which I dislike. I am going to drop NFLX from my portfolio today. Once DIS dips, and it will dip at some point, I will add to my long position. thoughts on dropping NFLX?"
What happens if all the Disney Parks close for a few months if Caronavirus spreads?
Im gonna short netflix and add more to disney
"love dis been tracking it for years. i remember the good articles the bad etc. disney is in a great posiition. disney is not just a company/brand its everywhere. in the movies, theme parks , target, stores, ice cream bars etc amd now tv service. the money they made from the avengers and the other box office smashes are not even factored in yet. they will.smash earnings easily see this 145 in the near term and 160 after earnings."
love the breakout...just needs more volume
True Star Wars fans will not care about what critics say. They will go and watch the film no matter what. That then translates to revenue.
"I am in my late 10's and I'm looking to invest for my future. I'm not sure which companies to start investing in, but I believe Disney is one because it is a company that I believe will always continue to make strides. Any advice as I begin my journey?"
How many people are going to go home after seeing Star Wars and Download Disney+ to binge Mandalorian!?! I DID! Monday she opens up strong!
Disney BOD follows Tesla and buys 2.5b worth of bitcoin-SEC filing
LMAO.....here come the Bag Holders. missed on all!!! Hahahah
Out of buy range
I hope box office numbers come out Monday for end game. Hopefully they’re excellent and we get a pop. End game has zero chance of going on Netflix and 100% chance going into Disney+
The Frozen 2 will pay for the Disney + expansion and pave the way to higher profits earlier. If this plays out like I expect Christmas revenues will help add subscribers as gifts to Disney+ and kids are off school. This next quarter they need to hit the cover off the ball and we will smash $175 before March 2020 
Credit Swiss upped subs to 30 million by year end......175 here we come.
"Sbux and Xom call options making me rich right now. With as much March and April call options I have in Disney, I’ll be retiring this year."
this is going up $12 a share tomorrow
"This was a good entry point day. Solid div, good future catalysts (OTT, etc), 13 forward p/e.... bought toward the close. Will continue to buy with anything under 99"
espn is done.. parks are done... but people really think frozen 2 is going to hold this empire above water
this month should be very good for disney.
"My fathers Uncle bought disney Stock in 1955, when they were raising money for Disneyland. likely for a few dollars a share, as they were not rich at all. I think they bought less than 100 shares. My father inherited 1/5 of the shares in 1973 (73 Shares). My mother passed in 2017, and left 1130 shares to my siblings and I. I have 450 shares today, and believe that all of my cousins who inherited from my aunt, and uncles still retain their stock today. It is amazing that what was a 500.00 investment back then is now a 1.1 million valuation. Yes its been 65 years but it is a great family story.."
I live in Spain and the service starts today. There is a huge demand for this streaming considering all the kids are at home because the schools are closed. DIS will be the new babysitter and the price is very affordable for 1 year subscription.
how can comcast afford the bid for SKY? wont it put them heavily into debt?
"I have Netflix while many still hold on to Dis shares. These are now static for the next 12 months . . . . though I'm sure some will be saying ""It's going to hit 300, no 500, in two months time. Fine, now I'll just go back to counting my Netflix, a company with no amusement parks, cruise ships, resort hotels, or lots of studio land where nothing is taking place."
Did anyone buy today? I did earlier when I posted and so far so good on that lot. I will add up to 3 more times if the slide continues. I wouldnt mind at all because I do think this will be positive on future guidance come earnings day
I guess this is the usual and irrational upgrade stock and sell off immediately move.

I got a question I only have 5k but i know this company is solid and will make me money in the long term should I get in at this price or wait for a red day?
This stock has been acting nuts this week.
"Hey Tommy, have fun selling those shares back cupcake."
"I'm usually the first to feel bad for shorts... I used to be in their shoes not too long ago...But I can totally see why longs are annoyed by shorts.It often feels like shorts really have no idea what is going on with Dis and are only playing the ""it has to go down"" card.Lets take a second to evaluate the situation...Dis has been on a massive up trend and after weeks of moving up, today it went down a few cents...Why on earth would a short be gloating?Longs, don't let the noise fool you!Let's be honest... Longs aren't going anywhere! "
MASSIVE PROFITS MADE! THANK YOU DIS!
Why is this thing diving???? 
"Disney has created a new employee mentality to be rude to park visitors with mask rules and stuff. This mentality has shifted the mindset to wear the ""magic"" is gone."
"We won't see a real rebound until we get some really good news. For now, keep your powder dry; cash is king. Some great buys are ahead. Don't pounce too soon. Take nibbles. DIS, CRM, NFLX, V, AAPL and even index funds: DIA and SPY.I am not an expert and not a professional advisor."
I was hoping Dis would hold 140 pre earnings... If this keeps up we might hit and pass 150 by earnings!
"A bit overvalued considering all of the cruise ships are docked, The Hotels are closed, the movie theaters and closed THE PARKS ARE CLOSED. Disney was a solid buy at 110-115$, but I think that it is overvalued considering that Media is only 38% of their revenue.I do own disney, and I am shocked by the 10% jump, but I don't necessairly think that it reflects their earnings. I sold my 100 shares today, hoping to buyback when it has its reflux"
"I added Disney+ on Roku for a trial. My kids love it. I already have Netflix, so I asked them which one I should cancel. One said Netflix and the other said Disney, so I kept them both."
"I enjoyed reading the 'Dis at 220' posts last week. There was no true basis for expecting 220, as they are not a profitable company. Many 'Big Tech' companies do indeed bend over backwards for China at the expense of the US. Myself, I cancelled my D+ subscription and got $70 refund! I predicted a collapse in this stock, and . . . so far have been correct."
"So frustrating to see a world class stock like DIS get kicked around while money losing garbage like TSLA rockets ever higher on hope, faith and dodgy accounting gimmicks. Name another company that has the reach and breadth of a Disney in terms of raw money generating power. DIS is growing, profitable and expanding its entertainment and consumer enterprise daily and yet NFLX is trading at a sky high P/E while borrowing billions to keep the content spigot open with no other source of revenue other than member dues (no theme parks, toys, etc)"
"just purchased a few puts. betting the er is not what folks wanted. will use profits to purchase more Disney at a lower price tomorrow. the x factor is the Disney stockholders are a resilient bunch. would it be a pun to say ""the force is strong with them?"""
"264,000 shares traded pre-market so far +.60"
"Netflix is worth $350. Disney is launching a streaming service in 2019. They have far more content than Netflix. Fox, Pixar, marvel, star wars, plus all their ABC and Disney content. On top of that they have amusement parks and merchandise. This stock will definitely double or triple in the next few years. Best to get in now while its reasonably priced. Stay away from overpriced stocks like Netflix."
This should be trading in the 150-160 range. Makes no sense to be where it is with so many good news. This is frustrating
I gong to say their subscriber base is so much better than expectation as the service seems to be overwhelmed with user that it cant keep up.
Just added shares. 1st time buyer. I’m typically a tech heavy portfolio and like the potential Disney + is going to fiuel for rev growth. Like jumping in before investor day and build up to next earnings will have this pop
"wow, the earnings drop really wasnt that bad now that the story behind the numbers are coming out. mostly just tons of investing/capex that outpaced sales but sales up 33%? that's pretty incredible."
117 hit... 118 in sight... New all time hight before earnings? 
"After this weekend, people will regret why don’t they jump on Disney this week. #Frozen2https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-11-19/-frozen-ii-is-set-to-heat-up-box-office-in-need-of-more-hits"
Bought in at $117 and havent looked back! We are in for a nice bump once solid word comes for hard date CA parks reopening. Sea World has a date now......just keep holding 
Can’t wait to see this break 200 and hold !!! Exciting Mouse !
"Shutting parks, people not going to movies, movie production halted … short this stock in the near term."
Wasn't it a lovely decision to buy yesterday at 116.75!!!
Seems to be attracting the speculators today. Love the Disney + story...cash flow and earnings down...will likely be down in 2021.
Disney has on average beaten the market 14 to 10 percent. Disney + is just something to end the 2010s with. There is so much more to come.
Imagine is NETFLIX owned theme parks and resorts all over the world. You don't have to imagine. That would be the new DISNEY being built right NOW !
Disney stock is going to fly like a rocket ship next week. Remember Disney has 4 total streaming services including HotStar India with 300 million subs.
I need help in understanding how DIS and TWTR both with EPS of <$1 can be trading at all time highs! Both combined with market value ~$400B. Somebody please educate me.
"Obviously, wish I had stock in TSLA but the price movement is sheer madness. Would not want to be the one holding the last bag when reality sets in. Meanwhile, holding onto my DIS ( real company that makes real profits and pays real dividends)"
Just signed up for Disney+. Seems like a good deal (the monthly $6.99 or an year subscription for $69) where we can trust Disney to have safe entertaining content for the whole family. Looking forward to the launch on Nov 12.
Im actually going to be a longtime subscriber of Disney plus. GO DISNEY
Mickey says 'buy Disney'......much to the chagrin to the shorties.
Read market all overWe need to hold strong all the week until the correction is over
"Just took the family to watch TS4. I honestly think I might of enjoyed it more than the little ones. The Disney brand is going strong. What an amazing year Dis is having! And the best part is, there is still so much room to grow. To infinity and beyond! "
"Oversold too much, 2019 there’s 7.8 billion revenue in Asia pacific, total is 61.8 billion worldwide. Assume Disney closed 2 weeks out of 52 weeks. Revenue impact 1/24 * 7.8billion= 325 million impact maximum. Not all region in Asian pacific is China, takeout Japan Disney impact is $200million. In 2019, total revenue is 61.8 billion. Impact of virus is 0.3%... way oversold"

I was wondering if someone can tell me if Disney really is looking into giving controlling stake of Hulu to Comcast if they let go of sky. Am I right? Am I sorta right but some details wrong? It’s important to me to know if there’s a scenario where Comcast has 60% of hulu. Or even 51%"
"Disney should Buy Genius International, GNUS, Big Streaming add and thats the Future!!!!"
"Woot! Back to back green days. I like how Dis was able to hold that 109.5. Hoping it can hit, and hold 110 this week."
"Is it just me, or did I just witness 3 times.... a 6,707,463 share sell at $151.64 ... uhm...?"
No position here but how on earth is this trading over $100?! Does this stock trade on reality or brand name?
"@Howie seriously doubt you have over 100,000 in stocks and then come to Yahoo's chat board  to give advice. I say you own zero shares and just here to troll."
Disney is a hate group. Proof is the firing of mandelorian girl Gina Carano over a tweet encouraging people to stop hating people over politics! The firing proves disney endorses hating people for thier political beliefs!
“To infinity and beyond “- Buzz Lightyear
well looks like i am the only long on here and will lose since the bid keeps getting hid everytime someone places a bid
Just sold a substantial position in Disney. Love the stock long term but expect to buy it back at a much lower price. The likely pandemic spread of this virus could close all their parks. Cancel all thief cruises and stop people from going to their movies. Streaming for now won’t make up the difference. Great company in a potential horrible short term position the stock is acting accordingly
Next trillion $ market cap company. Buy the dips alll the way up!
Is $150 coming next week? BLOWOUT earnings and beat both top & bottom lines!!!
Just heard GinaCarano was fired from Disney and will no longer be starring in the Mandolorian. Does anybody think Jessie Graff would be a good replacement (american ninja warrior/stuntwoman). Mando is one of many series on DIS that I think sets this service apart from Netflix. The momentum is only just beginning. 2021 will be a big year for movies...can't wait.
"It's all about being patient. When I bought at 90 everyone on this board telling me to sell blah blah blah. Did the stock have it's up and downs since then? Absolutely, what stock doesn't? But I knew Disney was going to be a high growth stock so I stuck to my guns and now I'm up big, and I will continue to hold for a decade. There is simply no other company that produces classic stories and content that Disney does, time and time again."
"This stock has to go back into the low 90's, right? Nobody is bringing their kids to Disney unless there is a vaccine"
What’s a good entry price?
Jim Cramer .disney share after earnings this week over 200$
Sell NFLX buy DIS. Love it
"parks were soft, anyone that has been can see this is the expansion year. Next year this time star wars will be open and parks will boom."
Back to 150
Stacked up on June 28th 140 strike puts .77 good for a 25% ROI oh yessssss will add more if they go cheaper
HAHA
BUY BUY BUY DISNEY. IT'S GOING UPWARD
"I dont have HULU but am all over signing up if they do figure out how to merge this stuff into 1 app with a bundle thing. I already have HBO go, amazon streaming, Netflix, and Showtime streaming. No more apps please!!!!"
Any dividends on this stock?
Double or triple earnings in 3 years.
Netflix would pay up to have a character like Dumbo that Disney has in its vault. When you manage characters like that well you can count on it bring in money day in and day out.
"wow ,,,look at the ship slide down into the ocean,,,"
"its Disney, why wouldn't u hold?"
"I love Disney. This was my first stock my dad gave me as a kid in 1995. Im not a mover and shaker by any means, but I did have 200 shares in Disney. I think this was a poor decision to pick Chapek. Chapek is a great guy but not the right vision. With Disney+ launching, and the company vision supposed to be going a quite a bit more digital this is a huge step backwards than what they told us would be happening. The guy overseeing the parks is not the guy to lead the digital age. I'm selling all my shares and hopefully buying again once I see this guy's vision for Disney."
"Investors can expect the Dow Jones to test its December 2018 low at 21,712 points. As a result, new investments should be waited for."
Wait till the parks are at full capacity 
"Does anyone know why Disney is moving today? And remember this, it is really around 145 as I speak because it just went ex-dividend.I, personally, think it is getting a little ahead of itself. There is nothing really to move it - a good Lion King opening should be priced in, and is offset by not a crazy box office for Toy Story (at least domestically - it's breaking records in Latin America). But the movie box office is not the mover that it use to be either. (Aladdin is still moving nicely, but its at its tail end). Earnings are a few weeks away - maybe there was a consensus that it really is going to blow things out of the water.Streaming is still about 4 months away - but maybe there is some anticipation for some announcement during the earnings cc.I think a break out over 150 is unlikely until we wee what the signups for Disney+ are. But, I do think that that will trigger a run over 175. And if it breaks 210, then you might see a run to over 300. And if you see a run over 330 - you could see 500 within 12 months from then."
"Comcast doesn't want just 61% of Sky, just as Disney doesn't want 60% of Hulu. But Hulu hasn't made money, and Sky is worth more. Disney, as a 60% shareholder of Hulu, may call upon the other participants to put in more money. When all is said, Comcast may have to pay an additional premium for Disney's portion of Sky, and Disney will give Comcast between $1 billion to $2 billion for the remaining interest in Hulu.Disney will have three streaming entities - ESPN+, Disney, and Hulu. I think they may even break up the Disney into different portions (think animation, Marvel, and Star Wars). It will give consumers the option of bunching them together for one price, or purchasing them separately. By 2025 Disney will have 100 million subscribers for its streaming, ranging from $5/month to $30 per month - it will be grossing about $10 - 15 billion a year. And it will only be putting in about $1 billion of year for new content."
Bring the dividend back
"Hey all, this stock is nearly $20 higher than what it was at its peak pre-pandemic, when everything was open and running great. I understand Disney+ is going to do well/add subscribers and revenue, but there's no justification for this to be so much higher than its ever been right now is there? The parks are closed for the time being all around the world... Anybody foresee a sharp correction around earnings?"
2 for 1 split coming. Watch out shorties. You’re toast
"DISney and DISappointing, till Monday."
"Not exactly sure how it works, but when Disney was dealing with Comcast and the Sky assets, is it possible they could have made pre arrangements with Comcast’s 30% of Hulu before completing the deal? Don’t know if they would have announced it then, or if they have to wait for the dust to settle with all the other mergers going around the two of them."
#canceldisney+....go woke go broke
ITS CRASHING SELL SELL ... ha. I need more shares... so please sell :)
"Hello everyone, welcome to the cheap DIS shares. Please shorts NETFLIX, TESLA, and APPLE because they are all overvalued. Put all your money in DISNEY because it's been shorted during christmas rally. Now it's time to put your money to the cheapest stock compare to all mega stocks. Now is your chance. Boost it up to 300. thank you thank you"
Buy the open. New highs coming
Way undervalued. Load up or get left behind. 300 billion market cap with 66 billion in revenue last fiscal year. Do the math.
Finally closed above 200!
Today the first case of covid19 was reported for a nurse AFTER vaccine. That's not a good sign.
i tried disney+ and i could tell it’s fail. Nothing to watch other than good old classic stuffs
"Returning dividends soon, more paid subscribers than anticipated, parks reopening very soon, and cruises possible end of summer return, push for online retail this is 200+ easy, I can see all the bears here trying to post negative propaganda cause they are getting scared"
Tons of action: hold...
Going to blow through all time high post earnings
It was 201 Monday Dropped 7 yesterday ?? It has to go back over 200 especially that the stimulus will be signed today ESPN deal and 100 million subs 1/2 of NFLX Park’s opening 1st soGood news should push this in the 225s
So will everyone in the parks have to wear masks ?What a fun time that will be ....
"A bear view : In coming years, many revenue will be lost by Disney in DVD sales, TV subscription and show/movies no longer being rent to other streamers. Based on expectations, Disney + will run in the red until it adds earning in 2024. While subscriptions are excellent so far, many will just subscribe, on and off, months at a time, like I am for HBO. Also a #$%$ load of money has been lost during the pandemic and debt burden will increase further in 2021.So... Should we expect a serious correction sometime in 2021?"
"Wow at BLOWOUT earnings!!!If it was ROKU, it would be up 20% easily. Not sure what people like about ROKU."
Disney paid 4.3 billion for marvel in 2009 . They’ve grossed over 22 billion since the purchase. What an investment!!! . Just wait till they turn 20 century fox around !!!
shorty thinks 145 is roof ..they do not know 145 is floor 
AH predictions???
Go DIS Go!The Apple / DIsney dynamic duo will be the ultimate winner here folks!
"Wife and I are talking about how to handle a market downturn this time around. If it were to happen we will likely have to liquidate a large portion of our portfolio to preserve some extensive gains in others companies, but while the tax burden will hurt, the time has arrived for us to start thinking about lessening the risk. Gotta have a plan!"
Hello? NFL!!!! Enough said..
Next stop space mountain
I'm long both Disney and Nintendo. Both are iconic brands. Both have incredible moats and margins. Check out Nintendo folks.
"Anyone else feel with all the Disney hype about Dis+ and Maleficent and Frozen 2 coming out, why can't this be closer to $!60 by now? It just seems this stock with rise and then fall right back. ROKU is almost back at it's 52 week high and I got in that stock a lot later DIS. Just thinking outloud. Happy Thanksgiving."
"Anyone else cringe when they read an article saying that Disney will loose $1-1.5billion a year on Hulu once they own the majority? Not cringing at the thought of Disney losing money, but the fact that these articles don't take into consideration that Disney can turn it around to make a profit. Just because Hulu is currently losing money, doesn't mean Disney can't change that. Plus, look at Netflix. They are losing tons of money every year."
Out at this level. We will test low 80’s again and then im back in.
"Great report! But now. the haters are already out. First out of the box was CNBC, and the latest is the Wall Street Journal. Funny stuff."
"Variety first paragraph:""Disney has thrown down the content gauntlet.The company capped a three and a half hour investor presentation on its plans to move aggressively into the direct-to-consumer arena Thursday with news that produced gasps from the roughly 250 Wall Street analysts and reporters in the room"""
"with all the good news rumor, this stock should be at $150, instead of this? cant's stand it."
"Bought some shares at 100+ a few weeks ago. Just got out and took a little profit. Don’t get me wrong, I’d love to get into Disney again, but I’m uncertain about the coming weeks."
I’m going to take a bath in hundred dollar bills after earnings. I have 212 call contracts ready to sell.
This is going to be HUGE this summer..Covid vaccinated peeps will go in droves..
You can't beat free
Hoping earnings end on a HI note today!!
I'd just like to point out that short interest on DIS is less than 1% right now. Carry on.
At $200 Disney is undervalued. There is too much growth ahead for Disney to be at $200. keep telling people to get in. its not too late this will be well over 200. $400 price target next year when disney surpasses netflix in subscribers
"Netflix never made a profit never will.They pay for bad content Once in awhile something like tiger king pops up..lmao still.Disney is Disney .Parks ..movies.. ships..pixar..Etc...In today's marketplace this is the most undervalued ""real company"" out there..Love.Mickey mouse"
200 Tom
Gina C'ant act! Glad to see the Exec made the stand
Great BEGINNING to the weekend for Frozen & Disney. What is everyone thinking? Can this have a big impact?https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/24/frozen-2-breaks-box-office-records-with-350-million-worldwide-debut/amp/
"Man some people must be #$%$ about their shorts or something. Guys this is an EXTREMELY strong company with more content control and brand recognition than any other company in the world. It was a great buy and still is. Look I get it this market is crazy, but you can't get mad when a company actually makes some good moves and the stock price has a fair reflection. Look at past growth and compound that with 2019 which is going to be a huge year for Disney. Not just because of Disney+ either. New parks, multiple records for their film sector, and doubling an already legendary amount of content. I mean seriously, stop whining and actually look at the data."
BEST ER IN THE HISTORY OF THE MARKETS CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA PARK STILL CLOSED AND THEY STILL MADE A PROFIT!
Disney just lost their head of streaming.https://www.thestreet.com/investing/disney-streaming-exec-tapped-new-ceo-of-tiktok?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo
"Go find the CNBC interview with Bob and Bob from earlier tonight if you are interested on why. Iger is still the #1 guy on Disney. He has one direct report and it's new Bob. Bob has all of Iger's direct reports to him now as the CEO. This was straight from Iger and Bob. Iger clearly does not want to stay on past his contract at the end of 2021. They apparently have been planning this for a while to give new Bob some on the job training with Iger leading the creative vision. Why today? Who knows specifically. I'd speculate it's a good time to embrace the drop that already happened instead of taking a major drop twice. It could be everything was just finalized. Iger repeatedly mentioned determining creative vision and having a lot of work to do in that capacity before retirement. Sounds like he's mapping out things for the long term particularly with content (as that's not new Bob's speciality). I'd guess that would be determining future of Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, etc. I wouldn't be surprised to see some shake ups there to set up for the long term. Star Wars in particular. Declining interest and revenue in the brand has to be concerning."
"The rumor of relocating Disneyland to Texas would solve many problems. A business friendly state, and a fully air-conditioned park."
"Personally, after their Mando action today - I'll be cancelling my D+ subscription. Will be interesting to see if they don't take a fall for their leftist bend."
Somone is trying to make it look like it’s popping in after hours with small trades.
The streaming business is the money flow to Disney executives. Economics 101.
Is it still possible for DIS to announce a dividend increase before the next pay out?
"I think I speak for most of us wondering how a stock like DIS is ending today about $10 off the 52 week high. Yes, I know, profit taking, blah, blah, blah. BUT, with movies out all year, Avenger's which was insane and successful, Star Wars, Maleficent and the grand prize of Disney + - how is this not at least in the high $150's by now? There's always the old timers here that have had DIS forever telling you to just keep holding but I think going into 2020, one more big run up and that is with the expectation of getting into the 150's again - and it's a sell. JMO. Almost 2.5 years here and although there's a decent gain, not a stock I plan to hold for 10 years. Happy New Year, diversify and good wishes."
Good news and stock falls lol
Plz go back to green. I bought at $190 :(
"and D. don't forget to post how much money you ""made"" today."
"Maybe they should announce again day 2, 20 million subscribers reached."
"What are people's thoughts on AT&T's announcement on launching their own streaming service? Personally, I don't see it as any threat to Disney Play, and think it'll just get lost in the shuffle with the rest of the streaming services out there unless they really plan on spending some big bucks."
"What will be the pulll forward for DISNEY in this at home world looking for great content in a World looking for heroes, moral, ethical, fables,, with cause & effect,, content that the parents can sit and watch with their children"
I think we move higher tomorrow after Netflix disappointing earnings/lowered guidance.
Regarding Tokyo Disney...you have to remember that Disney does not own these parks...the Japanese operator does. However Disney receives around a 6% annual royalty based on attendance revenues which works out to about $25 million per month..which goes straight to the bottom line. Two weeks closure means a minimum $12.5 million reduction in revenue and profits.
"IF DIS could perform like SHOP, I'd be a rich mom."
Last hour aheadBuy buy buy190$+
Did anybody else make over 1000% and options today?
Closing above 130?... one can hope.
ANyone think this backs up to $160 before going higher?
"Let’s set the record straight... Disney is part of Dow index so market up Disney up... market down ditto unless there is positive or negative news.... Disney will be going higher there are more positive catalysts to come buy the stock, hold and acquire when you can and go watch paint dry or take up a hobby and in 18 months you will be rewarded  just keep your eye on things but unless something dramatic happens this baby has lots of upside "
"Baby longs, tomorrow reality sets in. Hope you took profits, if you didn't OH WELL!"
Jon Najarian is long DIS calls.
"So, did I miss anything! I’m so impressed by the long-term investors that didn’t (completely) nibble/sell today but can see the long-term (1-2 years) picture. So many positives yesterday from Disney’s investor day, but what jumped out at me was that magic word “Hotstar,” I think the possibilities will be amazing. Love this quote from today’s CNN Business, “India has over 500 million internet users, more than any country except China. But there are more than 800 million Indians that have yet to be connected. Companies are racing to reach them.” fhttps://www.cnn.com/2019/04/12/tech/hotstar-india-streaming-disney-netflix/index.html"
Disney’s most profitable ventures will be forever changed by this virus
Everyone's talkin Disney i see new highs ahead
"Europe approved the Disney/Fox deal! China, you're up!"
"New account ""KUTAY"" ... 1 message so far. What's the angle ?"
Its so funny watching the amateurs say things like WOW its tanking at the open. Dont you people realize trading in the first and last hour are the worst times to trade? The volatility is out of anyone's control especially during that first hour. Not possible to make an assumption on the rest of the day off that.
DIS is way tooooo undervalued.
NEW 52 WEEK HIGH BABY!!!!
"DIS is a has been, it will go to 145 quickly."
Is today the day DIS finally breaks into $155??
$200 by Friday! Monday alone will be $193.
Watching DIS charts is like watching paint dry
Maybe news on Parks opening
"People that want quick game should not buy this stock you're better off with Bitcoin, be patient it will go up if you are willing to do so."
There projecting 41% increase in numbers they announced on msnbc end of day on Disney Earnings blow out numbers this stock should be over 150 right now
On the launch pad and ready for blast off. Giddy up.
"The profit number is good + .32c vs -0.38c.the subscription number is good. 94 mil vs 90 mil est.so the AH is higher, but surprisingly low, only 1.5% up?? !!"
I will attend the Disney stockholders meeting in St. Louis and propose that all shareholders with at least 100 shares and held for a year BE GIVEN A FREE PARK TICKET EACH YEAR. ( a park hopper too)
This will probably go below $100 after earnings. Will easily be their worst earnings report in the history of the company.
"i’m so happy right now. Disney stock has forever changed my life. no i won’t be rich from it. but the money i make will allow me to buy things, take vacations, and eat well whenever i want."
Magic let’s break $200
Im in
"Great week guys! Way better than I would have imagined. And now we’re setup for possible more of a run. If it pulls back.. buy more :) as always, win win with Disney!"
When Cramer says buy you BUY BUY BUY!!! This stock has a looong way to go before it’s over valued. Consider that China  already has Disney parks so streaming there should be a lock  add 500m subscribers please lol
"Looking into solely the content that Disney is pushing out this year through movies alone is AMAZING!! Avengers Toy story 4 Aladdin The Lion King Maleficent Frozen 2 Star Wars IXAre you kidding me??BTW, Disney + will gather millions and millions of subscribers and we are just getting started. Stay strong longs!!"
"Forget about the sling. It is undervalued. Look at Apple, Tesla, FB their stock already exceed way above analysts target."
Hello Disney PR dept. you have anything to tell investors about dilution of 100 million shares in the SEC filing the other day?
$300 by 4th of July! Only 12 million vaccinated so far. Hold on this is going to be fun.
"The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) Board of Directors today announced a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.88 per share, payable January 16, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 16, 2019. The Company last paid a semi-annual dividend of $0.88 per share in July, bringing its total dividends for the fiscal year to $1.76 per share."
"Carano told us today: “The Daily Wire is helping make one of my dreams — to develop and produce my own film — come true. I cried out and my prayer was answered. I am sending out a direct message of hope to everyone living in fear of cancellation by the totalitarian mob. I have only just begun using my voice which is now freer than ever before, and I hope it inspires others to do the same. They can’t cancel us if we don’t let them.”pretty soon these liberal losers will only have themselves to cancel. LOL $twtr $fb $nflx"
"Netflix casually up 3,5%. If youre lucky thats how much Dis moves in one month."
Real action will take place Nov-Dec and a solid 2020

Hey everyone.. have an odd question. Do you use yahoo finance mainly on Desktop or Mobile? ... If you wouldn't mind responding I would appreciate it! ha.
Big drop in aftermarket. Why?
Tomorrow we dance
up and down and around we go two upgrades one downgrade the analyst they don't knowjumping up and down yelling look at mesticking with your plan your dividend and Disney is the key
"No China exposure. New Theme Park= massive revenues. Remember, November is coming. Star Wars movie around Christmas. Vacation season. Netflix comp. Disc prices. Abortion Agenda means nothing to this stock, Extreme far right evangelicals love Mickey too much. Besides, Netflix is the 'smart' Streamer that decided to make it an issue. So Disney stock will rise perhaps with Netflix taking a hit. If that even happens. They are just boycotting producing and filming in specific states, not eliminating streaming. No big deal."
These are the days you are relieved that Disney doesn't follow the market.
"DIS market cap is only $275B, P/E of 23. Compare this to NFLX at $137B, P/E of 100, and saddled with debt.Either DIS will double or NFLX pps be cut in half. $200 is doable whether we have a recession or not. Beyond that depends how high the overall market marches."
"Barron's - ""This is the year of the Disney Double. Price target upgraded to 225."""
"Why does Disney need its own streaming platform? What's wrong with what they're currently doing? Licensing their movie library to Netflix/Amazon/Roku etc.. they get maximum revenue at minimal cost. Did Disney ever make a push to build their own movie theaters in the 20th century? Didn't they just license their content to theater chain owners? Why do they feel the need to build a modern day movie theater (i.e., streaming platform). I don't get it."
I remember just 2 weeks ago this board had maybe 5 posts per day
Disney = Fake Woke.
wanna see 1000.00 eod friday!
"“So far this year, only three movies have made more than $100 million during their opening weekend, all of them Disney films. ""Captain Marvel"" brought in $153.4 million during its opening in March and ""Avengers: Endgame"" smashed all-time box office records with a $357.1 million debut in April.Disney's ""Aladdin"" had the fourth-biggest opening in the U.S. with a $91.5 million debut.”Disney has secured spots 1 through 4 for highest debuts this year. We still have Lion King, Frozen 2 and Star Wars IX coming! Disney continues to be the top movie content provider across the world! #Disney #bullishto200"
Black widow preview looks great. If it makes 1 billions in box office what does that mean for Disney stock.
"I am buying on this slight dip.Adding to my position in GPK, near ATH!"
Thank you disney..And yes I am a subscriber since launch
is anyone else's Yahoo being really buggy? cant really see chart for today or anything
190 next monday
"Reviews for Endgame are pouring out...this will be one of the biggest, if not THE biggest film of all time. I've never seen so many reviews mimic each other so thoroughly with their praises...now, what will this mean for the stock?"
Any less than $200 is way toooo undervalued.
If you’re long I urge you to read “how to invest in stocks that hit all time highs” it explains why we have this pullback until a new floor is established and that we can expect a 27% rise next new high” this is shaking out new investors and setting a floor nothing less nothing more... see you at $165
scary decision to make.....
starting steps to 120 again!
I wonder if they'll increase the ticket prices for Disneyland next year.
Truly amazing. I've seen DIS up 3% or so on good earnings but this is just crazy. Makes the additional shares I picked up yesterday at 116.45 look cheap. Where does everyone think this will close? 125 looks possible.
"Tomorrow will be huge, once profit taking and consolidating are done, which is today, this will absolutely skyrocket tomorrow!"
Long time shareholder but sold all my shares until Disney fires Kathleen Kennedy. She is destroying the Star Wars brand and is now negatively affecting Disney.
looks like Disney is giving people a chance to join under 150 for a little bit longer...before the straight shot to the MOON
The puts I’m selling are getting filled. Sweet!
Gotta love this economy. Hey. We will be closed indefinitely and lose our major source of income. Ok. Up 3 points for the day. I hate to say it but the whole market is propped up right now. When the bottom falls out on sticks like this one and BA there are going to be so many people sitting there going duh what happened. I thought this was a quick V rebound.
Just bought another 100 shares
"How cool would it have been if at the end of TROS ...and kind of how the Avenger films show that very last cliffhanger during the credits, if The Child aka Baby Yoda was to appear on the screen, put his hand up to use the force, and cast a bright green hologram image on the wall which says ""Now go with my force and watch me at home"" :)"
$Dis lately it's one day extremely high others extremely low me like it starting early May when the parks have been open for a couple of weeks this will probably only move higher
Maybe Disney should stop canceling actresses? 
Up to $124.40 premarket! I love disney! Here's to them taking on NETFLIX. Another one I really like is http://rite.ly/woZd. I'd pay the $6.99 streaming for all the disney shows ...man the classics can't get gotten anywhere else... besides Netflix is getting too expensive....what is it $13 bucks a month now? getting up there with cable bill already

Willian where in Disney do you work? You never look at any negative news as true or relevant.
Everyone ready for the $70’s by Thursday? Disney is beyond overvalued right now. This belongs in the $65-$72 range.
Huge $115 today
what is the guidance for next quarter? does any know? thnx
I will add here and up to 3 more times as short term trades. Will do nicely as usual.
For those of you that didn’t know ROKU IS OFFERING DISNEY PLUS :Dhttps://blog.roku.com/disney-plus
Come on $130 before close
"I think a lot of people are forgetting how big Disney really is. Not only do they have parks, cruises, and disney+, but they own ABC, ESPN, Marvel, LucasFilm, Touchstone pictures, Pixar, Hollywood records, 50% equity in history channel and Lifetime, etc... this list goes on way beyond that.. to all the people saying this stock isn’t worth $50, your brain isn’t working correctly. I do agree that the price is going to continue dropping, but once the corona is gone, this stock is shooting up to $200 without a doubt. Were getting a great deal on this stock right now. Its on special for a limited time and we should all take advantage of it. Im not sure why people seem to think Disney is a dud all of a sudden... it will be one of the very few companies still standing in 200+ years. No if’s, and’s or but’s about it. To all the people saying Disney is going to go bankrupt, you are the human equivalent of cat feces and should not be allowed to have control over the device you’re holding without supervision of a parent or guardian."
wow there was shares for sale at under 141 today???....discounted for sure!! less then 2 weeks until reporting and 10%+....let's Disney 2020!!the biggest year for Disney by far so many good things to come
The top is in.

"I think the early bird will leave with wads of cash. long term , I believe disney could be pushing mid to high 300s in 2-3 years . Disney has made it clear there all in and if adjustments are needed I believe they'll make it."
"Hi everyone!Disney longs are holding strong!If you’re here for short trades, you’ll definitely burn your money. You should be trading some tech stock then for higher chances of profit. But long live the LONGS! Can’t wait for August’s earnings report."
Haven’t seen green for a while. It was in the 140s last week. Hoping it will continue to gain all the way to ER.
Sad did not jump
with the upgrade Target prices I'm looking forward to a 2 for 1 stock split soonGo Disney!
Lots of $150 calls bought today and yesterday. I think we see $150 tomorrow
"Remember, Disney loves to put shows and movies into moratorium. You should back up on Blu-ray any shows that you really like."
Disney is a money making machine
"Question is how many ""paying"" streaming subscribers. Not free trials. And what kind of churn are they seeing."
"I'm long on this but I don't understand this move today, can anyone explain why dis is going up?"
"Taking profit on Disney puts. Still holding spy, dia, and qqq puts. Not buying Disney until slow stochastic crossover."
"When you compare Netflix to Disney and how long it took for Netflix to generate over 100 million subs with endless debt, Disney is killing it! Quality over quantity my friends! This thing could easily go ballistic after launch in India and rest of Europe without spending the insane boatloads of money on content like Netflix does. Easy double in the stock price over the next year or two."
It's looking like a green day today. We need Buffet to say Berkshire is buying DIS. But happy he's buying AMZN.
"Why $200 / share and up by this year? Simple math really. If only half of the 60 million disney plus subscribers buy Mulan that is 30 million at $30 each, or 900 million of which Disney keeps 100% of the profits. No middlemen. Then you have the additional subscribers from those who subscribe just to see Mulan increasing the disney plus subscriber base. Disney plus is going to see huge growth before the next quarter, and yes...will be profitable a lot sooner than expected."
My average cost per share is sub $25.00 so I am a really happy Mousecateer
Place your morning predictions? I really thought last night was going to be better than $137+.
"who knows, rise of skywalker could do $10 billion this weekend ...and yes i'm sober"
nice sale on one of the greatest brands/companies on the planet earth. DIS at 13 times earnings and 10 cash flow. I will take it all day long.
"160s to 170s by year end ... Minimum of 20M subscribers by end of November, 30M by year end. That is only US."
Kids getting vaccinated relatively soon and Disney just announced re-opening on April 30th. Here we go.
Yet no basement analysts came to pump Disney when it splashed to 160$
"People really think that streaming will keep Disney up? Even though their cruise lines aren't bringing in revenue, their theme parks around the world aren't bringing in revenue, movies are on hold, there's no sports on tv right now, their stores are closed...it's going to be a while before they recover."
:( My only regret is that I didn't buy more at $107 a month ago. (Tom cries into Disney gains filled hands)
"Is China theme park open yet?.....get the picture? Early to mid 2021 and only after a vaccine. Small retail longs say it doesn't matter as they'll hold for years, but it's just common sense to sell high and buy MORE # of shares at a lower price. This is what Funds do all the time. Believe me, there's no well run Fund buying in big here."
have friends that work at both Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm ( a theme park about 10 miles from Disneyland) both parks have called general employee meetings both in person and online. both parks will close at the first sign of a cluster in Orange County CA- and there well be a cluster there.
$400 by end of year.It can explode like ROKU
"So what happened? I thought today was ""analysts day""? All DIS did today was bounce between 133.5 and 134.11"
so bullish on Disney long term but went to cash before Q1 - looking at June and sept market corrections
Considering the Dow is down over 500 & NASDAQ down over 100...DIS is hanging pretty tough today.
B of A upgrades DIS to 223 price target. Theme park revs just waiting to explode! Vaccines rolling out. Slowly but steady!
The trolls are out in full force. Means Disney must be doing well
"Increase in Roku devices Great for Disney +! With more options comes more eyes needing better content! Yay DIS. How long before we hit 25 million subscribers? I say end of year 2019, 50 million end of 2020! Stock eclipses $200 mid 2020."
WHAAAAOOO WHAAAO WHHHAAAAOOOO THERE WE GO
ill hold Disney forever and couple of FOX shares
it's going to be a long bull market no recession in sightI've got leap calls option contracts on Dis 200 call 19 Jun 2021

"Time to invest in now before avenger, earning, star war, frozen, Disney+ launch and many other good news"
Cult stocks win in 2020.Thank you for the $1100 scalp after hours ;)
wake up and get out-- you got lucky -- dumping by the institutions is in the implementation phase -- better get out
seems like this is just stuck here..... why can't this go up with the market?
Once the stock hits $200 it should be an easy ride to $250 over the next couple of months as theme park openings are announced along with the continued massive decline in covid cases.
This almost seemed inevitable. Felt like the media/analysts and mms wanted this exact action. This stock should be thriving. But they won’t let it.
SPLIT SPLIT SPLIT! Maybe....
DIS has at least 3x more value than Netflix. All DIS has to do is get leadership to wake up.
Data from analytics firm Sensor Tower on Friday estimated that Disney+ had been installed by an estimated 28 million customers across five countries since its launch on Nov. 12.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-debut-march-france-exclusive-225338009.html
"#$%$ How is this stock higher than pre covid, okay Disney+ is a VERY good move and is growing big time, but Disney has sooooo much financial issues right now"
I'd be worried if it went green for no reason than red. the red keeps me calm because we know where its going after earnings. red gets me more time to add another 50 shares before earnings.
Just curious what other stocks have you guys bought in the past week? The up and down kind of has me spooked.
Disney Says 'Avengers: Endgame' Opening Day Ticket Sales In China Estimated At A Record $107.2M

Paid Disney + subscribers now top 100 Million. Wow
"I’m afraid the MM have the upper hand short term on Disney. Unless we can break 150 they will just keep selling puts waiting for a down day to cover. Disney doesn’t have a stock buyback in place, dividend is locked in and Disney won’t release numbers on subscribers so either hold your nose and wait for earnings or hope the volume significantly increases to shake off MM fleas "
has been going down since DEC 31. Only goes up on premarket and spends the whole day chasing the highs while making lower lows. So #$%$
"I am actually concerned about Mr. Lassiter's stepping down for the moment. He has been the strength of Pixar and, more recently, Disney Animation. Of course, he must be respectful in all respects.But, perhaps, this will give Mr. Lassiter a reset. Pixar, although it always has great movies, Cars 3 and The Good Dinosaur, and, even, Finding Dory, may only have been ""good"". I was most concerned that Cars 3 was off the mark - perhaps because of Mr. Lassiter's infatuation with cars which clouded his decisions to put this sequel forth (although the marketing of toys may have played a real role) - perhaps this will give him an opportunity to put some things in perspective and give some renewed innovation of an element of the Disney movie studios that has been a strength for so many years."
Bill to reopen theme parks in CA
200 by tomorrow
news saying buy it before 2020 bc they coming up with new upgrade for Disney plus in January get ready
If earth shattering news broke that Disney discovered time travel and created a ride that would literally take you back in time I think their stock would go up like 10 dollars in one day and then gradually go back to like 145.00 
"There are several events coming up that will build some momentumFirst, Brazil and Mexico are to rule on the Fox purchase - I suspect that Disney has agreed, in advance, to the conditions - i.e., that they sell the Fox Sports channel - Disney will still have ESPN there, and this may be a disappointment (Iger went down to discuss it with at least one of these countries' boards), but Disney will get good prices for these portions and it will put Disney in good position credit wise.If these are done by late February/early March, Disney will try to close the deal quickly. This will put Disney in the upper teens (plus 100).Disney has an Investor's say in early April. They will have momentum from Captain Marvel and Dumbo. They will show wonderful things for Disney+, and probably have an closing date for Fox and a date for Disney+'s availability. A lot of excitement will build. You may see 120 breached again. Then we have earnings for the second quarter announced in early May. They won't be very good. But they will beat estimates. And Avengers will be doing gangbusters. It will hopefully hold over 120.We will then see Disney+ introduced. If we hear good numbers, it will begin to rise. The third quarter's results will be announced in August - they will be very very good - maybe over $2.25 - it will have Avengers, Aladdin, and Toy Story results, plus most of Dumbo's box office will fall in this quarter (with its expenses already attributed to the prior quarter). And you will have Lion King's roar of a box office booming at this time. If the Disney+ numbers are good, you may see something over 125, maybe more. Mark me down. Criticize me if I am wrong. Give me a high five if I am right."
"I can see Disney heading towards 200, and splitting . Maybe I'm wrong, but I see nothing but good things ahead"
"To infinity and beyond !!! Bull run ahead ,got 65+ contract calls with $DIS ,let’s get it"
Crack open a BUD and chill
"Well, i’m still way up but buying a lot in the low 140s...added a lot today along w/ selling puts...i think everyone knows that earnings will be massive so MMs dragging this down to buy at a lower price...i didn’t think it would go into the 130s but now, i’m not sure...if it does, i’ll buy even more...i’m prepared to hold forever as this is the only game in mainstream entertainment now...good luck to longs and shorts"
"My wife and I bought 9000 shares in 2001 at $15.47 a share, our stockbroker tried to talk us out of it. Even at todays price Disney is a value and will continue to increase in value. Disney is a world wide brand, don't give up on its stock. What we do need is a return of yearly dividends."
"ok, so the elections went as people expected it to go. which is great for the markets. markets like order and certainty and not surprise. My projection: Wednesday and Thursday we continue to go higher into earnings. if we beat earnings, we move up 3%. miss earnings and we fall 4%. my opinion on Tuesday night. i'll check back Friday AM to see if I was right. Thumbs up if you agree. Thumbs down if you down if you disagree."
Coming up on a holiday weekend. Load Up Now!! 
"Lets say that the new 22M subs are paying - thats 154M in revenue per year.In one month, Disney loses 300M+ in revenue having parks closed. Nevermind, having the movies/content shutdown as well."
And here come the upgrades price target  $168 subscriber count raised
"Watched the Overwatch league last night that DIS paid for, it was incredibly boring to watch."
Why this stock can't break $200 even with news daily.
Pre disney+ the market cap for disney was about 180B now add 95B ( netflix is worth 137B). Can someone help me understand if this is a sell now(temporarily).
"Well, I was greedy and waited to see if it would go down to 130 before I bought more and I think I lost my chance to add today. Oh well, it's a great problem to have. :)"
"Until cinemas are fully open with a steady stream of blockbusters, this stock will drag. Streaming films is a disaster. Just look at Wonder Woman. Box office on WW dropped 92% from week one to week two in China. Why? Piracy. Streaming will never be a profitable model for big blockbuster films. The theatrical models with shorter windows is the future. Disney will bounce back this summer when cinemas and theme parks are open."
Finally earnings today... here’s the deal we break 148 and this easily goes to $169+ if the MM didn’t buy his 3.5m put back then add even more fuel to the fire  Subs 35M + imho
Anyone knows if there is any news bringing down this stock ?
I just bought which means it will go down now lol
"I was expecting Dis to peek at 118 then come down around 110-112 for earrings.Today was different from any kind of drop I'd seen in the past 6 months (with the exception of previous earrings miss).I think today was a combination of factors. Market was down, Dis bounced back to new highs at 119+ after last plundge. Im hopeful for a solid bounce back to 115 this week. Fingers crossed.Good luck everyone!"
"Something doesn't seem right ... with all the awesome news came out of Disney and the stock is up less than 1%? If it's NFLX, it would be up 6+%. Talking about being so unfair!"

"Genius Brands International Announces Unprecedented Distribution and Content Lineup of Premium Family-Friendly Children's Shows Available on ""Kartoon Channel!"" Down to $3.00..wow9:00AM ET on Tuesday Jun 16, 2020 by GlobeNewswireCompanies Mentioned: GNUSProgram Slate Includes ""Baby Einstein,"" ""Angry Birds,"" Minecraft themed ""Journey to the End,"" ""Llama Llama"" (shorts), ""Stan Lee's Mighty 7,"" and MoreUpcoming Tentpole Series, ""Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten,"" Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Now in Pre-Production for Q1 2021 Delivery and Debut on Kartoon Channel!Following the Monday launch of its new free digital Kartoon Channel! across multiple AVOD and OTT platforms, Genius Brands International (NASDAQ:GNUS) announced the new programming slate of premium content for children 2 - 11 years-old and their families set to debut on the channel.""Kartoon Channel!,"" our 24-hour, free, video on demand, children's program service went live this morning with unprecedented distribution reach, and an unprecedented initial content lineup,"" said Andy Heyward, Genius Brands CEO. ""In my three decades in children's programming, I have witnessed kid's television evolve from Saturday morning network with shows such as Scooby Doo and the Smurfs, to 1 run syndication with shows like Inspector Gadget and He Man, to dedicated cable channels (Disney Channel, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network) to digital platforms ranging from Netflix, Hulu, and Disney +, to game platforms, mobile, YouTube, and all of the new and emerging technologies. Throughout the above, I am not aware of seeing another channel launch with such a volume of content, across such a broad range of platforms, penetrating virtually the entire United States TV Household universe. We are loading our episodes as fast as possible across all platforms and expect to have over 4,000 episodes available by the end of this month. Similarly, we will expect all of our platforms to be rolling out with full delivery in the coming days."" ('where to watch' link information below)Among the initial 1,000 episodes of entertaining and enriching content offered on Kartoon Channel! is the animated short feature, The Pig On The Hill (see link below), narrated by Pierce Brosnan; the hugely successful Angry Birds series, from the billion-dollar franchise; Baby Einstein and the Baby Einstein shorts, as well as Llama Llama shorts, and the Minecraft-themed show, Journey to the End. The upcoming comedy-adventure series, Stan Lee's Superhero Kindergarten, currently in pre-production and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, will debut on Kartoon Channel! in Q1 2021.Heyward continued, ""A volume of content this large is not simply 'flipping a light switch'. That is particularly so when we vet every single episode to make sure that it is compliant with our programming code developed by Stanford University Professor Emeritus Don Roberts, with whom Kartoon Channel!'s Program Code was developed in order to ensure the delivery of positive purposeful content that parents can always know will provide safe viewing for their children.""Currently, Kartoon Channel! can be accessed via Apple TV Devices, Android (mobile devices), Android TV, Amazon Fire Stick, Roku Devices, Xumo, Dish (AVOD + SVOD), Sling (AVOD + SVOD). The Company's other platforms are rolling out as fast as the content can be loaded. (see link below for access on various platforms)""Having produced and broadcast thousands of children's episodes across a number of the kids networks, we wanted to make Kartoon Channel! stand out as a brand, not just because it is free and available to everyone, but by putting on shows, which tell positive stories. That is very very important to us,"" said Kartoon Channel! Executive Chairman, Margaret Loesch.""Kids and their parents want uplifting stories. They want positive messages,"" added Heyward. ""It is also important to us that Kartoon Channel! is free and available to everyone. It is no less important that the stories are positive and with enriching lessons, whenever possible.""""Representative of the original shows that we are proud of and which will differentiate Kartoon Channel! is 'The Pig on a Hill', narrated by Pierce Brosnan. It is a fantastic story, and without ever saying so, it is about kindness, and it is about getting along with people different than ourselves. We are going to be a positive channel, and not just a babysitter with a screen on it."""
"$DISHey Disney people, with the deal to be announced this month with GNUS for the Stan Lee characters they control, any chance of a GNUS buyout from DIS, per the rumors?"
"It takes a tremendous amount of money to do this to a stock as big as Disney. So the question you have to ask yourselves is,Why?"
https://www.forbes.com/sites/megandubois/2021/03/16/disney-is-on-the-way-to-being-the-largest-streaming-service-in-the-world/?sh=653ca0a36673
Disney let Netflix do the heavy lifting to get streaming off the ground and jumped in at the perfect time ! Netflix and Disney will thrive together!
Godspeed to Alex Trebek. One of the good guys.
"Hope that we don't run up, only to fall again after earnings report. Seems like that's always Disney's pattern. Would like it to continue to move higher for once."
WOW I didn’t really think we were gonna hit 200 this week
"I thought Disney was a stble stock to own,,but what i see is a wishy washy stock,, seems very easy to push down at any time,,,so its no longer a buy and hold stock,,,,,its just a trading stock"
Clear path to 200 before the next earnings report.
Lot's of speculative rumors that Buffett may be buying Disney. The 13F reports come out end market today.
"Disney is more similar to AT&T than Netflix, a has been and now a never will be."
"After this pull back and all the vaccines out in the world some will have to work, Dis will be back."
"Wait until the earning report come out next week, the magnitude of Disneys loss is being ignored by investors. This is called fantasy investing at $105 a share. It will take years for recovery. It's a buy at $85."
Hoping someone can help me see what I am missing. Our family has always loved Disney. I just cant understand how the stock isn't getting crushed. If they open Disneyworld this year this year. I feel crowds will. E way down to meet government guide lines. Even getting to Magic Kingdom will take a major retool. You cant just park you car and walk in. Disney transportation is the only way in or swin haha. I just am not see it. Any thought would be appreciated.
How did the company get to 95 million Disney plus subscribers so fast ? They converted many of their Non US customers to Disney + (Read recent annual report) in addition to doing deals with he largest telecom companies to give 12 months free. Both Verizon and AT&T have over 120 million customers.
"I am reading various articles, can't figure out which one I can agree with.....is it 15.5 million subs, 18 million subs, or 24.5 million subs. Plus google now giving Chrome buyers 3 months free.....come Jan, will we have 60 million Subs. Every family gets together for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Watch movies.....Disney makes the best family movies.....is 60 million subs far fetched by Christmas? I think it's almost baked in."
Evertime Zacks comes out with an article about Disney the Stock drops over a point. Someone at Zacks hates Disney or has a lot of puts.
"Not a doomer but 105 after earnings, DIS is losing millions daily."
@awesome It's just profit taking by the large investment companies to offset any losses for tax purposes. Happens to every stock with a good pop in December. DIS will recover and climb in January.
"Short sellers will drive this down tomorrow. Therefore I am selling pre-market (I got in for $92), and buying back end of day (which I think people will sell to shave off risk for the long weekend)"
picked a good day to get back from vacay 
I always thought a well made Incredibles sequel would be Disney’s answer to Comcast’s Despicable Me...bingo!! Incredibles 2 was awesome and even better than the first! Tons of happy fans of the original and a whole New group of younger kids bodes well for future movies if Disney decides to make more!
So I bought this stock on the news that Disney is basically printing money. Billions of new subscribers. Building Cruise ships. World takeover. Got 65k in it. Net loss 3 grand. Wallbridge mining. Got 5 k in it. Up 2000. Why is Disney FROZEN?
"With gasoline prices rising again, who has money for DisneyWorld?"
"...and don't forget all of those Sunday (today) family ticket sales after Church and so on since Monday begins a new work week! yep, GO DIS :)"
don't worry at all. disney + looks good and the numbers will be good too. small decrease by the corona virus. no panic

It seems like big news coming out soon
Wanda-Vision Show coming out Friday on Disney+. First Marvel Original of many! We should also start to get an earnings run up soon. Lets go ladies and gents; PT $185 by Friday
this can drop $5. idc. just bought in yesterday at $135.01. i’ll be accumulating as many shares as i can fit the next 3 years. $250-$300 i will sell
PT predictions earnings ?mine is 195-200
I'm very pleased with recent outcomes and expect a solid steady increase in DIS. Just added for third time.
"apple is gonna tank the stock market tomorrow and down goes disney since it always follows the snp and nasdaq, good bye to my calls fml"
"Day traders just laugh all the way to the bank, I just can't believe it that DIS downed over 3 points. it will go up to 140 right after May 8."
To those who keep bashing day one streaming issues ... It’s called overload !!! Remember when Clark turned on his Christmas lights and blew the power companies circuit breaker? Overload!!!
Looks like we get another earnings after hour tomorrow..
Frozen 2 Poll for Friday: Thumbs up for BullishThumbs down for Bearish
"just signed up for triple play . espn, hulu, disney bundle . by by Netflix I am no longer"
I am making the call now. OptionsTrader is back in the form of Joe. Based on the ALL CAPS and some of these posts. I'm pretty sure they're the same dude.
160$ after earnings?
The random spike is because California Legislators are moving to allow theme parks to reopen soon.
Even the news that Disneyland was slowly reopening to guests yesterday did not keep the stock out of the red today??
If Disney is offering $38 per share for FOX and 4 shares of FOX equal 1 share of DIS this should be trading close to $150 if not more. This is based on fact that for every 4 shares of FOX you get 1 share of DIS. What am I missing??
picked up some shares not too long ago at 108.86 looks like it is coming along nicely.
Disney cheerleaders not see their 62 billion in debt? The new streaming content will cost them a fortune.
Just release another number of subscribers to scare the pessimistic hedge people away.
Closing at $205 today....
"People are underestimating the worldwide rollout of Disney Plus. With Shanghi Disney opening on Monday, France location not far behind, media growing n now being forced to better innovate, once Disney US opens n.all these other businesses r flowing, this is an easy double. Just look at valuation of Netflix. Buy when.everybody.else is panicking in.solid companies n u will make lots of money. Disney is the blueprint!"
all aboard the Disney train. excellent last buying opportunity
200 pre earnings
"@JOE.. you know how I know you are an amazing trader. You post what you say are your trades on a yahoo forum. Thats what all the pros do! I too buy puts / calls but do not post them all on forums because I am not at pro level status yet. Do you guys not get it? Were all here long term for the next $50 up.. not day to day swings. Over bought , over sold, dont matter when you dont want to sell buy sell buy.. .its too much effort when you know its only going up long term."
"The beauty is that the entire ecosystem can support one another Disney + on cruise ships all hotel properties, Disney pays its studios to create exclusive content, Disney can offer discounts at ticket counters buy a one week pass get Disney + free for one month etc etc it’s really a way to own and manage the entire empire. I think what most people underestimate is just how popular this will play in foreign countries "
"Looks like today was a dead cat bounce for stocks in general. On the Bloomberg channel, they said volatility was still high. So, expecting another dive down tomorrow."
"if you guys want some real entertainment, go take a look at the Netflix message board right now."
175 next week just like nflx did after reaching 593
94 million subs for Dis+ barely a year in!
I can’t help but think Disney is going to absolutely explode after earnings. The Disney plus subs are going to be incredible and foreword guidance is going to be very strong!I can see 175/185 very soon.
buy buy this stock is going to $120 and even higher
it should be up 2 dollars today
"Mandalorian's episodes 1 and 2 out of 8 were spectacular. If this is the future of Disney contents to come, not just for Star Wars but also Marvel and Nat Geo, it does not matter what Netflix does but I expect new subscription sign ups will be break neck the next 3 to 6 months. Hard not to imagine Disney hit $200s by end of 2020."
Disney mess up the West Coast so now they want to leave.
Just compare PE of Netflix to Disney and you can see where it will go!!! In a short time
"get woke , go broke"
This stock should be over $200...
"In the words of Hyman Roth ""We're bigger than US Steel!"""
"Below 100, finally. Good to see the price beginning to reflect reality."
"Argus just raised PT to $200 on strong growth within the next few years, not only from streaming but from parks and consumer as well"
"I'm going to give my take on the Movies.I am a little disappointed in SWTLJ. I saw it the first weekend, thought it was a little busy, and tried to do to much, but was well done. I thought, after the first weekend's initial domestic numbers, it could approach $2 billion, and certainly have a good chance to hit 1.8 billion - before the opening, I was looking at just over 1.6 billion (a traditional 20% off for a sequel).Then, the overseas first weekend numbers, although good, weren't quite as good as the domestic first weekend's. And the domestic numbers from the first weekend weren't adjusted upwards much, which was a little surprising. And then the weekday figures seemed to be off from SWTFA by a fair amount (although there were more schools closed this time around). And then a vocal minority expressed disappointment because the hopeful theme seemed to be replaced by some humor. And now China has been disappointing in its opening.This movie is still going to do $1.4, maybe 1.5 billion. It may have made a misstep in abandoning some themes to a certain extent. But I think that J.J. Abrams will get it right, Disney will take a few years off with the next ""trilogy"" to build up interest (and it will have a few Avatar movies to promote in the interim) and to get it really right. Remember that Return of the Jedi was not favorable received, but is considered the best of all the SW movies.I do think some of the themes, instead of the humor, could have done better. But it should not be considered a failure.And China is disappointing. but this isn't quite their genre. It is particularly disappointing because this would otherwise be a very nice market. But the force is strong elsewhere, and we can't be winners everywhere. Maybe, somewhere in another time, China will warm up to SW. And, remember this, as disappointing as SW is in China, Disney gets a small part of the gross sales in China, and Shanghai Disney isn't hurting for the moment.But let's look on the bright side - It will do about $1.5 billion - how many movies have done that amount?? Thor has done quite well - it will finish with just over $850 million. Coco will do over $700 million, and has done very very nicely overseas - particularly China - and this success in China (over $180 million) gives hope to the Pixar franchise which, until Coco, has never done well - so this bodes well for other Pixar titles, particularly The Incredibles 2, which is on deck in June - this could be very very nice. The first three titles of the year will gross over $3 billion. And Disney's slate of movies remains very very strong."
"Congrats to Disney longs, steaming is the future!"
"I wonder if Disney is going to raise the prices for admission, again, for the parks in Florida?What goes around,, comes around!"
Positive news regarding cinemas reopening is good news for DIS. An incredible amount of movies ready to be released immediately.
ya i remember when this hit 180 and dropped to 160 and i had no worries. I mean if you are gullible enough to sell this stock with the growth it has ahead you should not be investing in stock.
"Probably gonna sell in the morning if the price is still so high. Disney showed they are willing to pull off parlor tricks to make it look like they earned money. Not a good sign from management when any company does that. I just don't think they are honest anymore, sad because I like the company and a lot of the product. Make's me wonder if they are lying about sub numbers too. Maybe if someone got the bundle they are counted as 3, since they'd have disney+, hulu, and espn."
I pulled out of this stock and buying back in when it hits 100. I have to protect my earnings
Any chance this goes 160 plus by January?
I just saw a D at the liquor store begging for money. What a shame he wanted the short Disney and ended up like that. What a blessing Disney has been for everybody who saw it and listen.
If record ticket sales like Avenger -Infinity war happened to NFLX probably stock could have doubled. This is so unfair. I am wondering who is behind this.
My guess: 140 next week.
A few days ago I rolled the dice and moved the majority of my portfolio over to Disney. Now I think I'll keep it here a while. Go DIS!
"Gentlemen, so what stock will truly be the winner here short and long term? Disney or Fox? Guessing Fox short term. Would appreciate educated responses friends. Have a great day."
It has been a while since any analysts upgraded Disney. I think we are way overdue. Stay tuned my firends.
DIS should have been up $3 friday.
Wall Street journal came up with a story saying all the kids that watched Frozen the first time were not going to watch it because they had moved on to more grown up content do to the dawn of you tube. Yet here we are with another movie breaking 1 billion soon. Good or bad Star Wars will make money because of the fan base. This however does not mean going forward it will always be like this if they don’t do things right.
Time will show that Netflix is overvalued garbage and Disney+ is undervalued with rights to the highest grossing film franchises of all time.
So let's say the DOJ approves the Disney/Fox deal today...does that still mean Comcast has until July 10th to rain on the parade with a desperate last attempt at a higher bid? Or could early approval accelerate the process? Thoughts?
Dis+ = MONEY
Just need to hold 116.50 for the week.
regretting selling half of my shares.
Discount day!
$200 a share on the horizon. With Disney Plus DIS should be trading much higher in the future than where it's at currently. I have a very hard time believing Disney Plus' growth potential has already been fully priced into the stock.
Does not anyone think the value of the ESPN / sports content is being heavily discounted unnecessarily? It is going to be a long time until the public will be able to attend stadium style sports - but I think the games will begin much sooner in empty stadiums and ESPN / streaming will be the only choice for fans.
Happy long weekend! Closed market on Monday! Enjoy Aladdin this weekend! We're going tomorrow.
Great opportunity again at this level but after reading several of the postings I wonder if the average investing timetable here is 10 days or less?
So is this the big crash from the whistleblower scandal that we're seeing right now? Wow...I don't know if I can recover.
Y’all are going to be shocked at the price spike Disney will experience at market open tomorrow!
"Jason states that ""only"" 800 young people (under the age of 50) died from corona.800 people in, what, two months? That would be like 4 fully loaded Boeing 747 Max airplanes full of young people that crash with no survivors. Luckely the Boeing 747 Max is kept on the ground for more than a year now. That is called ""talking responsibility"" and citizens would be furious if the government didn't act. Can somebody explain to Jason that opening the country and start up business is about slowly start up some crucial production processes and indispensable businesses. Germany is slowly reopen but mass gatherings and and all fairs are forbidden till end of August.I have no idea how smart Americans are but can somebody else please tell Jason that he won't ride a rollercoaster the next months? Seems like he doesn't listen to me."
Disney also has Pricing Power....No one in their right mind would cancel D/T a Dollar increase!
If you’re scared get OUT
Have Disney moved into the money printing business?Last time I checked their parks were closed and they aren't making any money. So how is the stock up 10%.
anyone who thinks Disney + won't be successful must not have kids. Remember having a catalogue of VHS and watching your favorite Disney movie 20+ times? Kids still do that. long term hold we will see 200 in 5 years
Will we open above 150 tomorrow??!!
"Box office will make a billion, merch and licensing will make 2 more. There is no line item for rotten tomatoes score on the earnings report. Back up the truck"
Looks like the sell off has started. Had a good run.
Fellow Mouseketeers this was breathtaking. But from the Content King you better get used to it. Because we are way undervalued and about to go a lot higher. Can you feel the love tonight. Hehe :))2
Let’s have all green week!!!
iPhone Disney. I hope the stock keeps dropping. Maybe if it drops low enough they'll get rid of some of the liberal slobs that control this company.
"i guess as long as you make no money cut dividends then a stock is valuable, unreal,"
can you guys believe fight club the movie was produced by a subsidiary of disney??? mind boggling
this morning movement on a Friday is no real surprise. anyone with puts this morning might of made some profit if sold at the bell opening ...but Dis is FINE! just go long and avoid the noise and headaches. #Dis2020@200happy Friday Dis fam! enjoy your weekends!
I work for a large school district. Literally EVERYONE is ordering Disney+
I said I thought it would back up to $160
Folks Disney finishing in the green today amd tomorrow. Shorts getting squeezed the market is down yet DIS is up. imagine if the market was up. Not too late to get in . I see this at 134-135 by friday
Wow this stock keeps going up even though it is not making any money....wild
"Longs, pumping is not going to save it. The numbers are out, 3 mo to next q. No incentive for buyers to come in now. Shorts will win then longs will win. This is how the market works. If you are keeping for long time you are safe otherwise just trade it with the direction it's going."
350 MILLION!!! Wow !!! Another box office smash by Disney ! Heck yeah!!!
loving the 5 day chart!!!!
Is now a good entry point?
Disney will surpass Netflix in 10 years. star wars and MCU alone are insane to own under one roof. the quality of content Disney will feed the masses will be unrivaled
After hours shows talking about Disney. All like it. Earnings next week. With a very good possibility of parks reopening should only add to enthusiasm. Later cruise ships will be reopening adding additional thrust to share price. Stock up over 1.5% after hours.
Are we going to $300?
"To much debt, uncertainty of future, only streaming service is positive news YET multiple people taking off their subscriptions because content will be drained for 2020...I love Disney but this is far from the bottom....this company can survive and thrive at a 90-100billion market cap but the debt is 50 billion with only 5 billion cash in hand...jobless report is going to be significantly worse shortly (already was worse week since 2012 sandy hurricane)...this is not the time to buy"
Wreck it Ralph broke the stock market yesterday. That’s the only logical explanation for yesterday’s selling. I think the manipulators were looking for capitulation and they didn’t get it. Let’s hope that was the bottom
Anyone got the Real P/E on Disney?
yahoo censoring news... ABC Maintains BLACKOUT of Cuomo COVID ScandalCNN Conceals Corrupt Cuomo Cover-Up of Nursing Home Deaths from DOJ
"200 again soon, more upgrades on Friday"
"I am putting my money on Disney+ being the family stuff only. Pixar, star wars, etc... Hulu is Hulu.. .fox stuff goes nowhere yet I guess. maybe the family stuff goes into Disney+... but I bet they won't even want Simpsons on Disney+. and So I would need 2 apps minimum. 3 if I wanted sports as well and still not sure where to watch the Fox assets via streaming."
JoeydoeyThe stock has been flat since 2015 I think they get big streaming numbers up very quickly. 100 million subscribers monthly @$10.00 = 1 billion a month. Then you factor in what effect this has on merchandising let alone the PARKS plus the cinema. The sky is the limit for this stock. We can buy it constantly now just keep growing shares.
Cramer mentioned we will takeout $200 following earnings release.We might see $250 by summer.
"Question: If you subscribe to Netflix, can you also subscribe to Disney?"
Does anyone live around Disneyland?
I think we hit the bottom today. Up from here 
I am surprised that Disney hasn’t put out a PR about the secondary offering that they filed with the SEC days ago. It even states that the shares will be sold no higher than $116.
"Stock is getting excited as it getting closer to earning, watch for breakout above $200"
"The soon to be released ESPN subscription app is for people who already have a ESPN subscription through a typical cable or satellite package. For additional $5 the app will provide additional 2nd tier content to those who subscribe. Knowing this, I do not think the ESPN app will be a game changer nor do much for the stock or company. What DIS really needs is to roll out a ESPN a la carte streaming service for those who do not currently get ESPN through a traditional cable or satellite package. Now that would be a real game-changer."
"So much for that nice little pop last week. All gone. So frustrating. DIS appears to be firing on all cylinders and is a 24/7 cash machine but they will not let it get back to 150. Meanwhile, TSLA continues to lose money hand over fist but the stock has been bid up about 100% in 3 months because they modestly beat delivery numbers. Meanwhile, their accounting is all smoke and mirrors. Amazing how the market endlessly chases money losing unicorns while actual profitable companies have to scratch and claw for every uptick."
This is a stock for trading. Been going sideways within a wide range for over three years now.
This thing is ready to take off!
140 is a lock....145 easily soonest...150 at end of year
"I remember some of the posters here from last quarter too. some of ya'll aren't happy regardless of good or bad earnings. price falls, you're mad. now good, you're mad. I too wish it would go up $50 after earnings, but this is not a dramatic swing stock. just isnt. I'd be happy at $120÷ tomorrow."
You member that one time that Netflix surpassed Disney's market cap for a millisecond? Hahaha We now have 100 billion more in market cap since that day!
OK...just FYI...in Church today the pastor asked the congregation how many people signed up for Disney Plus 80% raise their hand for both services!
sold all my disney that I bought a few days ago and put it all into tesla. Now I have no worries.
"We have HBO, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and Disney + at home. Netflix is becoming the odd man out here. Honestly there is very little content that anyone really wants to watch on Netflix. Also my wife's family is from a small town. We were just out there. Several of them without kids had Disney +. Not sure if they were on free trials. But they loved baby Yoda. I was a little shocked they had it. I'm considering canceling Netflix and I never thought I would consider it. But there is nothing the wife and I watch on Netflix really. I think Hulu and Disney + are going to have a monster year in 2020. And Netflix is going to flounder. Paying way too much for #$%$ content. How much did they pay for El Camino? And it's already long forgotten. I think we see 25% upside through earnings. I think numbers are going to just blow everyone away including Disney. I'm predicting 80 million subs by year end 2020."
This stock is Netflix on drugs with billions of their own content people are willing to buy other than Netflix.
Did someone come out with a buy recommendation today?
"If you look at the chart comparison of NFLX vs DIS since the April 12th announcement of Disney+, DIS is up 18% while NFLX is down 15%. On Tuesday's earnings call, Iger called Disney+ the ""most important product that the company has launched"" in his nearly 20 years at Disney."
Anyone that sells before endgame needs to have their head checked.
The vicious savages at Disney have failed to cancel Gina Carano. Bigotry is this company's operating norm.
This stock was at $140 pre COVID. What did u expect?
In 2025 DIS will have 500 M subscribers worldwide at an average $10/mo or 60B annually in revenue. Take out $30B In production cost and that is 30B a year profit. Add in in 5B form park and we are at $35 B a year. Apply a 20 PE and we are at $350-400/share
"Hilarious how the stock doesn't rise as Frozen 2 breaks all time records, yet articles claim the stock is going down based on only star wars critic reviews? In what world does that make any sense. Star wars fans will still see the movie."
disney+ subscribers gonna blow past estimates in earnings coming up
just bought another 335 shares at 131.20 . great buying opportunity
Disney+ Is Already Losing Titleshttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/12/disney-is-already-losing-titles.aspx
"I consider Good content,loyal members ,grate numbers joining streaming services good name as pluses, whilst competition underutilisation of huge asete like the parks due to prevailing conditions as significant weakness @ present.Probable changes to the future ball park matters."
"They said on the conference call we’ve already at five years level worth of subscribers and they are just started this thing, come on, we should be flying!!"
Significant subscriber numbers to start with. Congrats to all the longs. This will be a long term hold. Added more at 133.
I was promised this if earnings beat tonight. Lets do this!
price targets friday or more likely next week. will shoot this to $140+
It won’t be the blowout earnings rather it will be the Disney+ subscriber numbers and forecast upward that will blow this to $165 immediately!Better get in now!
"Congrats to the longs I was able to average down, officially in positive territory average price before CV was 129. Now it's 95."
"I took my VERY modest discretionary. surplus and bought into this expecting good things w/the Disney+ launch. A 2.7% gain to date isn't encouraging. I'm holding, but the knuckles are getting white."
"Been wanting to add to my position on this so bad but been waiting for a pullback that has NEVER happened. All time highs in the market and in DIS. I see it hitting the 200’s if DIS+ is successful (I think it will be) but I’d love to get in around $130, I just don’t know if we see that if rates are cut."
"increase in share price and ON DOWN DAYS A DIVIDEND, to take the sting away, hi ho hi ho"
"Won't stay under 100...Green tomorrow, bad news expected and all priced in"
"If it gets to $70, I am buying. I have 18 years until retirement. This might only last a year, tops."
Way overvalue being that revenue is currently 0.
I reiterate here again this is a long term stock worth holding with its plan laid ahead for the rest of the year and some of the next. Hold for at least a year so you dont gotta pay short term capital gain tax and u will be handsomely rewarded
How in this world is NFLX and DIS valued almost the same? This makes absolutely no sense to me. Not sure why I bother investing in the stock market. I think I'd rather go to Las Vegas and bet on the roulette wheel.
I have a question. Would you take your children and family together on a Disneyland/Disneyworld trip knowing the risks? I would not because as a Parent I am cautious. This is just reality.
"Dang, I only bought 700 shares yesterday. I’m stuck buying call options now."
Friday on the $200 house
Anyone else catch that beautiful bounce at support level? Let's go big D! Time to push of the fear and get back to business.
i am one of the fortunate few who bought less than 1 month ago at under 110 ;) got to know when the pressure is building!
"I am a believer, because I don't believe that DIS is overvalued at this price. Only the reason that causes DIS to pause because it moves up over 28 points with in a week or two, but the intrinsic value is still there."
Great earning report. Manipulating hands and too much expectations. Will see more plus $110 tomorrow.
"There are many companies going into media streaming and these stocks have declined due to possible competition. Disney has showed some strength in that they appear to have the best catalogue of content compared to others. A huge library plus lots of future content. Avatar 2,3,4,Star Wars, Marvel Universe, Pixar, Disney, Fox, National Geo, ESPN sports and the list goes on. Don't know where the stock will go tomorrow or next week, but looking out a couple quarters it should be a good deal higher IMO."
Good for investor need to buy more waiting the 98.00 after that they will finish the fox deal then win against comcast starting their nDisFlix ... 200 is the target for 2019....
"I sold out of my large position a few days back to make some moves elsewhere. One has paid off well, the other two are a work in progress. Lots of red there. Nothing like watching massive quantities of red piling up in your portfolio to remind you of what you (briefly) left behind. DIS is stoic. The future is bright, and it's coming soon. Maybe not tomorrow, but by years end and early next year, the rocket won't stop.I only wish I would have started my position buyback today instead of yesterday. Oh well. Adding more as we speak. Lots of green coming for us all soon."
Happy to had sold my 127 shares today. Tired of big business bullying people for not having the allowable opinion.
"Well Kathleen Kennedy of Lucasfilm has to go and she will then take Rian (Ruin) Johnson with her. The Marvel movies are holding up well though. Do many of you hold shares in disney, netflix comcast, and various such competitors and collaborators?"
Walt Disney reached an all time high at 182.06
Let me start by saying that I am Very Long on Disney but I am concerned that the FREE Disney+ subscriptions from Verizon are about to expire. How many will renew and how many will Not. What effect will this have on stock price??
"DIS will be lucky to earn $2.00 in 2020 and $3.00 in 2021. Using a 25 PE, which is rich, it’s a $75.00 Stock at best. Reality has not completely set in to this market yet."
why still at 98? wait till q2 and q3 earnings. wont go anywhere near this stock for a while.
Year and half or maybe just a year...to reach netflix current stock price...could be a year. Wouldn't surprise me.

"Disney is a tariff proof stock. Legacy branding coupled with world wide historical box office record breaker IP, plus direct to worldwide consumer model, in a couple of months, plus Q3 ER. Example= India population 1.3 billion. Europe population = 700 million plus, a fraction of that on a monthly basis, not counting U.S., and you have an understanding why netflix is at 360/share. Disney will easily surpass that. Coupled with legacy theme park and IP franchises like Starwars, Avengers, stock in short order will fly past Netflix comparable very very easily"

Is Disney a sell the news stock or does it go strong?
"Good luck everyone , we got this!"
Just another Disney shareholders meeting
"Bought more last week, but this run up today is emotional buying. Remember, DIS + is subscriber based, just like Neflix and others, where when they first started, the stock skyrocketed as well. Can DIS survive off of Star Wars content and old DIS movies forever? People get tired of it after a while. I'm absolutely bullish over the long term, just don't think DIS + being a cash cow will last more than a few years."
Last time to get back into Disney below $110. Rally is here folks more short covering in the morning !
"Again that being said, this thing is going higher,"

"Bottom line, ALL content on Disney+ will be of the highest quality. Movies, shows and documentaries for all ages. Possible live tv add-ons. Every single piece of content will be in high demand. Which other service will be able to compeye with that. Take off all of the filler content on Netflix, what would be left? Disney+ will not require any filler type content. All high quality and demand. Hands down, DIS will continue its rule in the media business. Mark my words"
"Where's the Disney love today, no $112-114?"
tell me is it a good idea to drop 50k into walt Disney on monday?!?!?!?!!?
at this rate we should see $140 by tomorrow. after they announced some box office numbers for avengers
Why is it down on a good day
be patient and big money will flow into Dis. we are the only company who is not over valued. we will see $200 by next quarter. holding my 530 shares strong
"Why does Jim Cramer keep recommending this stock for children, to get into investing, if it has done nothing for five years as I'm reading over and over in the comments. Is it because his charitable trust owns it?"
SQM will be a huge grower! Doubling production this year. EVs will be everywhere next year!
"Those who argue that Disney+ is only for kids has obviously never been to a Disney park. At the surface it looks like something just for kids, but then you get in there and there's something for everyone. All ages have fun at Disney parks. Disney is doing the same thing for streaming."
The most OVERVALUED stock in history

"If the market doesn’t turn, this will be hitting new highs soon:) beautiful chart."
Disney stock will be over $300 a share in 3 years.
"Im not hearing much talk about price action from earnings. Up, down or flat? Whats the general consensus?"
I bought today at 132.62 after selling off my Amazon. So far looked like a good trade and am hoping to stay long.
Got in yesterday at 107. I see their streaming service launch being huge for the brand. Every household in the US will be signing up if they both look to restrict access to Disney content and also license appropriately.
Any chance for a dividend increase?
"It's crazy how unified the stocks have been lately. If you look at the S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq, they all follow the same pattern and have for quite some time. The pattern seems to always align with DIS (and other stocks I own or watch) too. I know it's all related to economic news, but it still baffles me how uniform it's been the past few weeks."
I’m loading!Imagine Game Stop is more expensive than Disney? LOL!!
"I haven't seen it mentioend here - but in the earnings call, Iger mentioned that they have a deal ""in principle"" with AT&T too. That should help the stock nicely too!"
@ awsome. You seem far too emotional and nervous to be trading options.
I think I'm gonna buy more shares... does anyone think it's going to dip slightly?
so disney has full control of hulu and disney+ will have its genesis in 4Q.= goodnight nflx
If Netflix is over 300. Per share. Disney should there or much higher in a couple of years
150 easily by eod tomorrow. I am hoping it run ups like tesla did to 200. I miss that train lol
"This is the low water mark for DIS going forward. Two years from now when the package of DIS/HULU/ESPN content has surpassed Netflix in subscribers those who hung on or bought into DIS now will be glad they did, as the value of this stock will have nearly doubled in that time."
This will take a while to play out. I bought my 6-year-old a few shares she can watch it grow till shes at least 21.
Earnings are going to be great. I woukd bet disney+ revs will offset park closure loss
"If you look at the 3 months chart and look at it from Aug, you will see that it is in a downtrend slowly going back down to $100."
"Once comfortably above $180, I'm setting a down limit sell for 25% of shares @180. Even if FY21 is a huge gain from the dismal Covid year of 2020, up 188% to est. $4.81, or beyond.. it's still way under FY18 and FY19. And that's if everything clicks and there's no surprises. In FY18 and 19, the P/E's were 16.5 and 22.5. At EOFY21 the P/E would be ~38... way overvalued, anyway you look at it. It will not sustain double it's historical P/E. That's why I'll continue to keep the down limit sell. For all you fanboi's, I'm not a short but a LT shareholder just doing the numbers."
More bag holders. Excellent. Buy more plz
Just bought a larger position on the downturn. I can't imagine it would go below the line of when Disney+ came out. Plus they are launching in Europe soon. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/01/21/disney-accelerates-european-debut-disney-plus.aspx
Nothing personal...bought yesterday two minutes before the close @ 116.67 and sold this morning @ 128.00....all about making money!! Plenty more later...
a lot of buying this morning.

"I like Netflix but not enough to support it when PE is at 92, as an investor DIS is a no brainer"
There’s way too many great things going on with Disney for the stock to not soar .
"It's obvious someone is working hard to not let Disney break out and get anywhere past 111.84. If if the market went up 500 points today, this stock is stuck."
My crystal ball is saying today 103.05 by end of day

"Nancy Pelosi is making money off Disney along with a bunch of other stocks. Pretty sure its a law that no one in Congress can ""make money"" with insider information. Liberals bend the laws for their use."
Anyone else here use charts to help them time entry in and out of a stock? Yesterday was a clear bullish engulfing candle and today we have the FIRST higher low in stock price which meets the perfect criteria for entering a long position. Options expire on Friday so I guess we are at or between 146-148 by eod Friday. With just 12 trading days left this thing is going to get crazy the closer we get to earnings. We were range bound today which suggest a move up is imminent and unlike most people I put my analysis out there to share and always happy to learn gl everyone tomorrow is going to be a good day to be long 
Someone on stock twits think dis is being shorted like crazy by one person. Moving 7k volume at a time multiple times an hour
@ $122.00 People will understand that DIS is going well into the $150.00's and more
lets do it!
This stock is worth a lot. Investors know the upside outweighs the temporary downside. I want to get in soon. Disney has a lot more to offer than just theme parks and their portfolio will continue to expand investor pockets.
This is the greatest content and distribution property in the history of media. Good luck Netflix. I wouldn't want to go up against DIS and T.
5 day speaks for itself. 210$ by Q2
"I think Disney is a fantastic company and will own shares again, but you are CRAZY if you think this has bottomed. Florida and California are just starting their infection curve and those parks are not opening anytime soon. Reservations have already been pulled for anything before June 1st. ESPN has no sports to cover, movie theaters are closed, why exactly would you be a buyer at these levels if you are an analytical investor. I'm looking to get back in the 70s."
This better go to 144. Now I’m stuck in two put contracts. And my cash short position is down $50.At least I was able to pick up a couple 140 contracts at this current bottom.
soon Disney will break out upward and people wish they have bought it. when fox deal is done disney going to be $120 if not even more.
"target 75, then 50"
If they're not making money close em down
"They could easily have 16 million subscribers by the end of 2019, which would be twice what analysts projected. Amazing. Netflix watch out."
"Disney is for young adults, kids and family, it’s not going to hurt Netflix. The package is going to be serious eye candy for everyone and it will spark serious imagination which will make it a streaming giant, but I don’t think it will take customers away from Netflix ."
Going up with summer coming. Movie season
"Everyone knows Disney + is no joke. People are calling it the most successful product launch in history. People are ditching Netflix for Disney plus according to various articles. This is a game changer, and Disney plus...on it's own...will be bigger than Netflix in a year. Think about that for a second...in only one year! What a buying opportunity...with this kind of growth I'm thinking new highs by the end of the year, and possibly breaking that $200 / share barrier. And once it does that it's lift off. It's like buying amazon at a $100 / share if you think about it."
"up 10 in a month, DIS is your classic long term hold"
Today's chart is starting to look like the Disney castle...
"This is just following the Dow. Nothing more, nothing less. Nothing in the stock market moves in a straight line. If it did, we'd all be rich."
3rd quarter earnings will be higher than 2nd quarter don’t expect DIS to be this cheap for long
going towards earnings May8th. will this be a price driver leading into?
Share prices the same as 2015 and a 1.6% return on your investment. You would have to be Goofy to be happy with that!
"If you think the economy will go into a major recession, you are most likely right. But if you think Disney will not survive you are wrong! Disney has a lot of potential and synergy effects between its segments which will lead to a major success of Disney+ in the future years. Yes Netflix is the king right now, but there is always room for a follower. The advantage of Disney is that it can operate in a niche market for parents with children while meanwhile they can add unique content for adults to challenge Netflix over time.Check out my analysis on youtube (theinvestmentabc) where I also give a fair value for Disney!"
I’ll buy when goes back to 100
makes sense to take profit here and buy after earnings settles
"I just want to be clear. Disney had 1.89 in earnings in the first quarter (beating by 28 cents). This quarter has been upped to 1.68 a few weeks ago. The next quarter is 1.98, and the total for the year is 6.91. These numbers are TOO LOW.Black Panther is simply one of the best movies. At the end of the weekend, domestic, it is going to be between $390 to $400 million, with a $100 million weekend. Four weeks ago, I thought anything over $300 million would be a huge victor, and, maybe, 3 weeks ago I thought $400 million could be a possibility. Now, $600 million is not out of the question, and over $1 billion looks more and more likely. This movie, 4 months ago, was a maybe $500 million total gross worldwide.Add 2 cents in profits for each $100 million. That is another 10 -14 cents. That means we are looking at about 1.80 for this quarter. May/June has three blockbusters scheduled – if they all hit, and BP is a good harbinger, Disney will see more than $2.00 That is $5.70 (and I think it may be a little more than that) before the fourth quarter. Now, the fourth quarter is not Disney's best – but they do have the Ant Man on board in July, which will give it a nice boost.The only thing that might hurt is A Wrinkle in Time, which, if it falls, it will hurt. Oprah will not let that happen.What I am saying is that Disney is going to make $7 a share. At 20 pe, that is $140 a share. That is why Disney is worth it. When it turns around its Media/ESPN segment around, all bets are off."
$142.98 is close enough to $143! Congratulations !!
Love how quiet its been around here today :).. Calm and steady....
We are 50$ over what we were before covid. Can someone logically explain how 190$ is a value rite now? Doesn't make sense to me.
"looking forward to what ESPN+ will offer. especially with Monday night football! If disney has a nice Bundle with Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ for under $25. i would so do it. or Disney+ and ESPN+ for $14.99"
Will go over $200 today?
Likely going to see the slow drip drip going forward on stocks. Down each day until we hit a new low
"I don't know what I'm better at. Buying a stock and then it goes down, or selling a stock and then it goes up"
What are the predictions for tomorrow?
Will Pelsoi's option drive DIS to < $100?
"4 to 7 months before Disney is back to ""normal"". This has along way to drop, sorry Mickey fans but in 2 years it will be back to all time highs."
Iger Just now - Disney has distribution deal with Amazon !
The thing is.. if you get out now.. DIS will do this again after earnings of Q1 and by that time.. the quick buck you made will seem hardly worth it after selling now.
"Whoever is predicting a strong down turn in Disney is out of your mind. Guidance is thee most important factor when it comes to earnings. Do you see where Bob Iger is taking Disney? Acquisition of Fox, streaming on ESPN & HULU.. talks of a buyout on COMCAST. Competitive subscription service for $6.99 a month. And let's not forget the all star box office block buster year they're having in the theaters! Captain Marvel, Dumbo, The Avengers, Aladdin, The Lion King, Frozen 2 and the much expected 48 years in the making Star Wars 9 .... you're crazy if you think this is a sell."
You buy Disney and just put it in a safe place for years and years.
"I'm hanging in. Just got a big, fat dividend from DIS and believe there are games being played with the stock to keep it depressed in the face of constant good news and upgrades. I do not know the options world and what is done behind the scenes to manipulate stock prices to screw options players this way or that. However, given how many other equities are massively overvalued based on hype, that the solid good news and hopefully good earnings underpinning DIS will move this solidly up very soon. fingers crossed."
"If Disney was smart they would be putting a massive amount of content into the streaming service as quickly as possible. Put up movies from all their studios and also put up the movies released in the last year as well from their entire catalog of studios. They are too greedy IMO and they are old school,"
Guess people are buying as they listen to the CC...stock on the rise.
After Tuesday's earnings it will be about 106
Most parks closed or limited capacity and stock at all time highShorting this garbage big time lol
Short position rose from 27 million shares to 43 million shares from February 14 to March 14. Oops!
Good Grief! 
Lots of short interest right now in disney. Should see a nice rise in the stock next catalyst.
there has to be big hedgefunds with a straddle and strangle here. 190 resistance and 186 support last few days!!!!! This passing 191 before earning will not happen.
"Glad I pinched off some shares @200 yesterday.. I might buy that you deserve that fwd 97P/E when you start paying a div again, and make it quarterly, Chapek."
Awesome earnings report. Would be nice to see them beat their next earnings as well and then I think things will really heat up. This turns into a Wall Street darling when things are going well. Could easily run up near $200 in a year or two.
I've spent half my DIS allocation and will keep the other half in cash until the scare is resolved. Lots of money to be made as she recovers.
Here comes $200.00
Why is everyone in such a rush to have dis skyrocket? Let it happen organically while you build a very strong position for maximum appreciation
It's about to take off!!! $155 or more by the end of the day!!
"DIS is up 2% in the past month, which doesn't account for the April surge after Disney+ was unveiled. I don't want to jinx it but I'm starting to think there is no ""gap"" to fill. I could be wrong."
Disney+ doesn’t work with Comcast?? Is this true?
Guess what? Bernie McTernan the great analyst UPGRADED Disney to $170. Go Disney!!!
"I've been eyeing Disney for a while. The markets will recovery and Disney will recover just fine, it's Disney. What is a good entry point for this?"
disney will have record breaking attendance for the summer quarter. $150+ after earnings. $175 when Disney+ launches.
Disney...is pure MAGIC
This company has a Kathleen Kennedy problem.
"Load as many as you can now, this is cheap, you won’t see this price by the end of the week."
Disney+ trending on twitter. You know the service is good when you get viral by just existing! Netflix who?
I have a few things with Disney plus.. being in Canada I don’t have access to Hulu and Epsn which is a big deal to me. I think the success to Disney will have to be the content they create and maintain as well as diversifying and expanding to other markets either than USA
"Disney near all time highs despite closed parks, changed rules, empty ships, expensive hotels, revised ticketing costs....OH WAIT. They have a small streaming serivce!!! Projected 400 million and they can't even get to 100 million. I do not know what you are buying here. They are burning cash, changing rules for the worse, no studios, empty hotels, ships floating around Coco Beach Florida. Where is the Dividend. Man, people will buy any stock these days and pay premiums for declining businesses."
Don’t sell unless you need the liquidity. Half a trillion market cap incoming.
As a avid mouse fan. I will buy when I see the numbers
Most undervalued stock in the world right now. Fair value is $300/share. The servers literally crashed during the last wandavision episode. This is the ground floor before Disney hits that trillion dollar market cap. $1000/share is inevitable.
"I owned Dis a number of years ago when they were in the high “30’s”. I sold them at around 45 and was glad to make a small profit because the price dropped considerably. So...what I’m asking is now that the pps is about 2.1 times where I sold, I wonder what is supporting that price. Is it still a “good buy”?"
Smart money loading up after hours. Feel sorry for the slups who sold today.
Congrats... just as expected. Ring the register!
Great stock for longs. Real money coming in future years this is all a build up. Earnings are just ok. Endless stream of revenue on the way. Iger staying. Must have in all portfolios.
someone needs to come up with a company that the pure purpose is to exploit people that are in power that are funding these media briefings
Is this nice trend going to continue? GLTA? What's your selling point?
"A report out today showed an increase in Blu-ray and DVD sales. The author speculates that people are switching to physical media because of the rampant censorship and banning on streaming services. When you own the movie, the PC police can’t mess with your movie."
Say no to bigotry. Boycott Disney.
145 Friday 4pm. 4.3 million shares disney puts/calls will expire worrhless.
Topping is a process no ultimate $qqq bottom until apple hits 99 and $msft is a 12-15 pe again. Until $tsla is back to 100 which is really 400 presplit. Ev company or two like $ride will have to go bk too. All of this and spiking treasuries and a hate for tech will be in place. This could take months or years and eventually same thing happensnto the $dia as tons of overvalued cyclical stocks like $dis $de $cat are this high only due to money printing. Much better deals away from big caps IMO who can flip the bird to indices
NBA and Disney are about to finalize the contract to resume the NBA season at DIS wide world of sports. Hotels will be filled with players and media. ESPN will televise all the games and commercial revenue will be tremendous. DIS will break $120 tomorrow.
6 days until earnings. Showing some strength today. Tick tock.
"Today we snap back to reality, ope their goes gravity."
"anyone rushing to sign up for apple plus today? yeah, I didn't think so. But when Disney plus launches, you know everyone is going to sign up"
Wow when virus ends I’m losing the bus at this crazy discount in 2-3 years it’ll be at 130-140 again and I’ll be swimming in the cash
disney plus growth is gonna be huge with everyone staying in. cheap entertainment
I’ve never done a short before. If market open at 108-110 do you guys think it would be a good idea to short?
I don’t know how to handle this move upward . Is the world coming to an end ?
Do yall own a single stock and only worry about it as opposed to a portfolio of stocks? My portfolio as deep in the green today and there is nothing to worry about on DIS so why worry about one single stock?
"All the talk on here of $160 by the end of 2019 isn't happening. $160 by the end of 2020 is a strong possibility, but not this year....that is why you take advice from this board with a grain of salt. Everyone here wants the stock to keep going up, but it's not reality."
Got 5000 shares at 99. Big fan of Disney and a great investment
"here we go again,,disney going down again...100 seems to be the top,,"
Are we going to break out of this range or what?? Hasn't Disney China already paid for itself in about a year? Starwars almost paid for itself in movies and cartoons alone.
Boycott Disney. Nattzi Regime must be stopped!
"This will go up after Trump addresses the nation, mark my post. Corrovirus is largely overblown fear mongering meant to take down Pres Trump. It's not much worse than a bad cold or the flu. If you want to look at rate of deaths caused, do not compare flu death rate in US to Corona death rate in China, that is apples and oranges, look at flu death rate in CHINA compared to Corona death rate in CHINA, compare apples to apples. Coronavirus will come and go and be no big deal at all. It's nothing."
Think that the streaming will be a big surprise and Disney will go to $250
121 after earnings.
"I love the sudden rip upward into close from red to deep green. Really a classic example of how manipulated the markets can be. We like to pretend we have some sort of control base on our theory, analysis, chart reading, etc.... It is all just smoke and mirrors."
"Paul Pelosi bought 25 call options for shares of electric-vehicle giant Tesla with a strike price of $500 and an expiration date of March 18, 2022. He paid a total of between $500,001 and $1 million for the Tesla stock options.He bought 100 call options for Disney stock with a strike price of $100 and an expiration date of Jan. 21, 2022. He paid between $500,001 and $1 million for the Disney stock options."
my prediction: tomorrow close at $145-hover around 145 till friday-then jump to $150 next week!
"If you bought 100 shares of DIS in July of 2015, you invested $12,000...as of today, you're sitting on a cool $13,932. Congrats on the gain of $1,932 over nearly 5 years."
"Patients will be rewarded with this. CNBC owns Comcast so they asked the ceo questions they knew he would not go into details about. I do my homework. Strong company that just had really good earnings report and bright future. New park overseas, new toy story addition to parks here. Blockbuster after blockbuster movie wise. 2 Star Wars coming out within a year. And when sports gambling because legal which it will soon in places other then Vegas that will be a big boost to espn. Matter fact think in the AM I might buy more"
My prediction is right $147 to $150 tomorrow

Guess what Netflix has been HACKED 100 times more than Disney but SHORTIES want to keep playing the negative press releases. Guess what Netflix went through it too. This is the way of the streaming beast. Disney will get through it and get better securities in place so no more hacking. https://www.her.ie/business/netflix-has-been-hacked-heres-how-to-check-if-your-account-is-affected-268027

Disney will now be unstoppable.Pathway to 100% HULU ownership makes this a streaming juggernaut.I would go short Netflix!
Analysts saying lion ling will bring Disney stock to all time highs 168
"I will try not to post much more.It seems more and more likely that Avengers End Game will hit $1 billion for the first weekend. Deadline is showing for the US some where between $260 and $300 (but I would suggest that it is to the higher based upon early ticket sales, it could approach 300). On the low end, these total $510, on the high end, 610. Let's say $550. The add $50 each for South Korea and UK - that will give you $650. Then there are about 6 countries that can average 25 - France, Germany, Austalia, Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines - that puts you at $800. then there are close to 10 countries that can do $10 million - that puts you at 900. Then there are about 20 countries that can average 3- 4 million - let's say that puts you at about $975. Then you have to glean a little more somewhere to hit $1 billion. And it the numbers in China and US are better than a combined 550 - that will make $1+ billion. I think you could possibly see $2 billion by the end of the second weekend - but let's get through this first."
"Idw to jinx it, but can I look for a $200 by end week?"
# of Netflix subscribers in Australia is roughly 13 million and another 2 million in New Zealand.... That is adding another 15 million easily attainable subscriptions tomorrow. I think we will have a 30 million total subscription number come out next week or possibly late this week.
"Here's to a long, slow ride to $200.00 a share in 6 months....IMHO..."
Can DIS get back above 142-145 before EOW?
HBO Max from AT&T $14.99 a month lol. Disney best price for streaming period. better than Apple TV thanks to content. Disney is the best streaming service come November 12.
150 by Friday!! The best content in the world!
Overvalued
"Can’t believe only thing operating is Disney+ and that doesn’t even bring in revenue... won’t be net positive until 2024... just adding to all the losses, ughh this is going to 55-60 easily"
EmpVol all time high - ready for mean reversal ? Free membership never going to hold...
New ATH Monday - earnings are gonna rock next month
...CRAMER! 
You either believe Disney revenue will reach 1 trillion in revenue down the line or you don't. With Disney plus growth it definitely will. It is a long play for sure but a safe play. $1000 a share down the road.
Been long since DIS acquired Marvel. All in my 401k. Really looking forward that retirement in a few years. To the moon Alice...!
"Listening to the earnings webcast! 4 quadrant product, men, women, kids and Everybody else! Love this stock!"
"I have to think Disney + is adding more subscribers than I first thought, I originally thought we might have 25m subscribers but based on a few articles I’ve read I think that number might be double or 45m-50m if they don’t release numbers until earnings then I predict $175-190 after earnings  buy hold and be rewarded "
6 Month Comparison:Netflix up $67.05Disney up $2.91what a joke. ill be selling after june once this has been long and disney reports. should of stayed in the tech sector and not ride the bandwagon of Disney+
Time for the PC fairy Iger to go. Stock has done nothing in 5 years.
Shorts better run. News flash..Disney+ already have almost half of the subscribers that Netflix has and it’s only a little over 4 months in. Y’all scared? And wait until the parks open:)
today’s action was a preview of what’s to come in terms of going higher.
The night is darkest before dawn. This is the last chance to get in before the Netflix competitor is up and running!
"Just be patient, but I believe it is about to dry down this week. I will go for it because I don't DIS will go down any further. END GAME."
75 today. Close all parks for three months
"The pattern of interaction with the SEC suggests the regulator is taking the allegations seriously, said Jordan A. Thomas, a former attorney in the SEC’s enforcement division and chairman of Labaton Sucharow’s whistleblower-representation practice. As Thomas told MarketWatch: “The SEC receives more than 25,000 tips, complaints and referrals each year, and the vast majority do not make it this far. The fact that the SEC has asked for more information more than once and conducted interviews suggests an inquiry is underway."
Toy Story Land opening soon
"Dis is gonna do what Dis is gonna do.All you can do is place your investments and hope your analysis or theories are correct.There is nothing wrong with Dis. In fact, it's still trading closer to its highs than Lowes.That being said, you can't blame Dis if you bought in at the highs and Dis does not Rocket to 125 after one earrings.Whatever happens, enjoy the ride and good luck."
Would love to see it hit the 140s by end of week. See no reason to why it shouldn’t.
This is a fitting shelter stock fromThe rest of the market woes due to its content and growth along with their long term possibilities. It sucks tat amazon messed up. But gdp was better than excited expected and consumer spending is up if you listen to visas conference call. All of which will be good for Disney. It will be a bad day but I think over the next week it will recover and start to grow back up to 117 range.
"I looked at this board in private browsing so I could see what OptionFaker is up to, and boy is he nutzo! He really needs to move out of his mommy's basement and get a day job. And saying things like ""longs have taken a beating these past few days"" shows he knows nothing. Obviously longs don't care about the day to day stuff, so how is that taking a beating? Personally I check day to day stuff because I love the company and it's exciting to me. But never once do I think I should sell. Especially with such a bright future ahead!"

"If Frozen breaking records didn't move DIS, I don't see how the new Star Wars will either. After a huge month, DIS will now go into lul for a while. Market is up over 300+ points and DIS is barely up. Investors aren't going crazy for DIS anymore."
I dumped some of my Disney stocks thinking it was going to sink. should have remembered that the mouse never loses.
10 million subscribers on the first day!
nice pullback :) been waiting for this... Good things to come folks :) let it keep dipping and then were ready to move forward and upward !
"Up up & away, today!!"
tomorrow is run up to earnings buy in now
Jumped back into DIS with some new PUT options. $104.47 is Topped out price for DIS today.
The blood bath begins today
Shareholder meeting today. It will be streamed. Always fun to watch.
Money making machine! Disney was packed this weekend. $220 end of week
Someone said the recent stock increase was based on Avengers hype. Not true. It is based on streaming prospects and park attendance increases. JPM specifically raised PT to 150 based on expected increase in park attendance.
"I JUST BUY SOME MORE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT BRAND OF DIS IS LIKE KO. 6.99 A MONTH IS JUST A GIMMIC, EVENTUALLY IT WILL BE 12.99 LIKE NFLX."
"I changed my mind and decided to sign up for the DIS+ bundle after finding out that the bundle works with Hulu Live TV. Before that I was only planning on getting DIS+ with the year subscription and skipping ESPN+. But after the credit that they give you each month on the bundle, it is only about $1 more a month to get ESPN+ through the bundle. https://thestreamable.com/news/how-to-redeem-your-disney-plus-bundle-even-if-you-subscribe-to-hulu-no-ads-hulu-plus-live-tv-or-espn-plus?via=fp&utm_source=23843948032900217&utm_content=23843952472050217&fbclid=IwAR2BxDw5wCiSrhBTgdJKxX2DcV1ktUlaXvOBZNz9ghNFxTKnE42inWyUro0"

"Any company without indication of revenue growth/positive guidance just churns through a cycle. DIS is not breaking out to new highs this week, but it also isn't breaking out to new lows. The only companies that will make actual progress over the next few months are tech, healthcare, and the trendy companies like shopfiy, zoom, and beyond meat. Most companies run ahead of themselves on baseless optimism, then pullback after one dose of reality. If you want to buy DIS, sell puts at a strike you want to own at, get paid to buy the stock, then turn it over on an up-day. Rinse/repeat."
Cramer just said buy Diney. going to way higher
Nice to see common sense investors on this board again. I can't recall how many times I've seen posts about how this will drop to the $80 or $90's.
who is crazy to buy this over 180? hey....I have a great story....want to invest?
DISNEY+ LAUNCH IN INDIA MARCH 29th:https://techcrunch.com/2020/02/04/disney-to-launch-in-india-through-hotstar-on-march-29/
anyone buying more before next earnings? i’m debating or going to keep saving my cash on hand.
"A little profit taking is all, will climb. Everyone is buying right back in. New Upgrade by JP @150.00 will continue to climb."
DIS will go over $200 a share once parks reopen and Disney Plus should get them to 300 mark. We are talking hyper growth coming to this name just like NFLX. I've been bullish on DIS before but now I'm more bullish than ever.
Cramers giving relationship advice now!!
If this ends above $143 today I am going to read some of the doom and gloom posts from this morning for fun.
Shall I go long?
Do your own homework but this is going much higher and swing trading can be fun just make sure Iger doesn’t burn you with a press release lol  Disney is just building some steam before she screams higher was lucky enough to add at these prices 
Everyone I speak to is watching Wanda Vision and also circling back to watch the Avengers movies. Just sayin'.
"Disney, stop your political agenda. your job is entertaining people, not to be in favor of one party or the other one"
Restore the Disney Divvy now!
Why the big drop in price near closing and after hours?
Good time to buy in the market
CLOSE OVER 200 TODAY
Shorts Toasted.
"Fastest way fir me to ignore your perspective is to tell me how long you’ve been trading for. As if that matters at all, lol. There is no crystal ball. You can’t pick a bottom number. But you can reasonably say what the stock will eventually do. This will definitely return to at least 150 in 5 years. Buy now or don’t. Try and reach fir those extra nickels. Nobody who sits in this for a year orc more will regret it. Lots of people taking short trades making pennies and getting heavily taxed. Good luck."
If you get out now you will regret that decision in a few short years. Disney + is launching via HotStar in India end of March. Currently that service has over 400 million subscribers. Think NFLX can compete with that exposure? The best is yet to come!
Let’s goooo Mighty Mouse!!
Stock is undervalued. Should be sitting at $200/share and many analysts have set that as their price target.
21% of my portfolio is Disney long. I keep saying everyday “I will buy on the dip” ... or “ wait for the pullback” . I think I will be waiting for a looooooong time. Ffs
Good ol Disney... where a good day is not losing too much. Should’ve listened when I was giving great advice for free here on ER day.

This is the way
"Can you believe how much Disney has invested in Disney+ ? Iger has literally built everything from the ground up buying streaming hardware company, media content, media creation and leveraging his media library created over 50 years. It hasn’t cost anything but reduced earnings but it has solidified them as THE best family entertainment content provider around the world. Instead of renting new content he bought the studios to make his new content basically paying himself to make more content this is pure genius because the revenue hits his bottom line so at $6.00 per household it’s pure revenue to the bottom line. Next earnings we will start to see the addition of those revenues even while Disney expands internationally. The ONLY thing that can stop Iger is a hostile takeover of Disney before he achieves his expansion imo either way in 2 years Disney is $300/share"
had a feeling we would get back at least 50% of yesterday’s loses back.
This is what crashing up looks like. Economy contracting by 5%. Non-essential consumer discretionary company stock price roaring up even while it has virtually no earnings and huge and increasing debt. Time to plant a garden and read up on the Weimar Republic.
"This stock has a history of doing NOTHING for long periods of time and moving ONLY after ER reports. This is probably stuck until Feb. 10 when they report.Hopefully, it won't go much lower anyway.White House says they will start COVID BRIEFINGS 3 days a week. If we can get some positive news on the vaccine rollout this may move up as its parks are a boat anchor around its neck at the moment."
all analyst says disney needs to make its library quantity sooo much more ...only 600 titles is soooo low ....
"I am surprised by the stock's jump in AH/PreMarket trading. I would have thought that it might be up a couple of points. But the market, apparently, has been soothed on the 20CF merger issues, and is enthralled with the streaming prospects. I give it about a 50/50 chance of hitting 150 by the end of this year. The real test, however, is how many customers Disney+ will have when they report earnings in February. If it is a number that excites the market, then it could jump to over 160 in the short term, and hit over 180 by mid year."
I just noticed Fidelity updated and removed all sell opinions for the stock. Updated equity score is now a 7.2 Bullish rating. Was a 5 Hold last week at one point.
ESPN+ revenue will be insane on balance sheet.
Even with the theme parks closed around the world this stock continues to make better moves then the competition on streaming $T $CMCSA

"So....Disney was oversold after consecutive red days...Now entire market is red... Dis looks pretty good to investors looking for a stock not hit by all the negative news.As a result... Dis will close strong!Just my wishful thinking, but wouldn't it be awesome to see Dis close at 112. "
Ahhhh those folks who hold $200 Calls....I laugh....
"the spamming of comments has started to decrease :). Hi all happy day to all the longs on here. is Dis way too undervalued, Netflix way too overvalued, or both? Ill go with both and lets meet with PEs in the middle?"

great stock. isn't going anywhere soon but a great long hold
frozen 2 $738 milliin world wide in just 12 days. broke the record ahead of hunger games for thanksgiving movie releases. dont forget star wars release this month. Dis $160 by the end of this year.
Boeing posts a loss and it's up 9. Disney down again nearly 2. love the rational market
Nice recovery in last mins!
is it just me or is this stock ridducoulsy undervalued?
Would be nice to start 2021 at 185
"Anecdotally, I mentioned DIS+ to four people yesterday and all had already signed up for DIS+. It is what brought me to buy DIS stock immediately. We'll see if they can gain a Netflix like recurring subscription revenue stream."
Only .32 cents profit and the SP is $190?
What Disney has right now is called freight train momentum. With nobody wanting to get run over by this stock short there are simply greater buyers than sellers. Everybody finally wants a little Disney magic!
Must have had a bunch of day traders and calls to clear out this morning lol  nice to be up and I expect another bump on Tuesday and then it’s managing press releases to keep excitement up until Feb. earnings. Everyone has it pegged between $155-170 and I don’t think it will be contained once we break $147 imo
still waitin for the breakout to new highs again ;)
wow!! congrats today everyone!
Content going down hill and the future isn’t so bright pushing their LBGTQ agenda
Held this stock for almost 5 years now and am still down... haha. Pretty sure stubbornness of seeing a breakout right when I sell is keeping me in
when is the Aladdin remake opening? Do you think that will impact Disney?
Disney+ and revenue it will generate within 2 year may more than $NFLX.With $29 for big movie on first night is way to go and very innovative way to handle.They will generate $300M on just that move.
im very happy with this stock and bought most of the dips and has rewarded me handsomely ^^
$100 by end of month
"Dis+ is having technical issues due to the high demand.... Most the kids are in school! what happens when they get out? What a short term issue, but overall bullish news."

"Relax guys, DIS will add 3#$%$ tomorrow."
"Well, Well, Well. Finally the posts are down to a realistic number. For me that's a win. It's GD to get rid of the rif - raf. With that said, someone wanted to know how to buy into stocks at a low price?? Easy, wait until everyone RUNS. Spent the day transferring  into my account. Now I will be shopping."
"Disney stock is up 35% in 2019 which is amazing. There are lots of reasons why but the success of the movies in 2019 (which really helps sell Disney+ IMO) is truly unprecedented. Here are the Top 7 Domestic Grossing Movies for the year: 1) Avengers 2) Lion King 3) Toy Story 4 4) Captain Marvel 5) Spider-Man 6) Frozen 2 (will certainly move up the list) 7) AladdinIn summary, Disney has 7 of the top 8 grossing movies of 2019 with only SpiderMan Homecoming not part of Disney Studios (though obviously still a Disney property). In another week, Star Wars will make it 8 of the top 9 for Disney Studios. Dumbo and Maleficent were also in the top 20 for 2019. Can't ask for much more than that..."

Pullback is healthy. It is just finding a channel. Should be slower but safer growth onwards if they have a good call
Why is Netflix so overvalued? Up over 2% today. Why? Because they have a series about Thai cave rescue coming? Doesn't make sense to me.
"Why hasnt disney caught the attention of warren buffett by now?? Dis has all the attributes wb seeks in a great company, huge moat, pricing power, pays a decent dividend and trading at a reasonable level. Dis would most certainly qualify by wb as buying a great company at a fair or even discounted price if you factor in the tremendous potential of disney plus. Cmon warren!

Sell!! Selll!!!
The good thing about Disney is it has a lot more shares outstanding so it won't move like NFLX. It will move slowly up or down...not 100 dollar jumps up or down like Nothing Flix
Yeah... Whatever's going on (shorts/puts etc) I must say this is the wrong stock to pick.

Looks like Disney’s stock splits right around $110-120...any rumors of 1 for 4 split?
"I went through a few of my verbose posts from yesterday, and I cannot help but think about only one key factor on Disney, DIS+, and the whole buy the rumor sell the news mentality in the market > ""Smart money will evaluate this earnings report along with the current and future subs in the US, EU, APAC"" > DIS goes up and finds a new solid base/support from here!"

"This might sound crazy, but if we see a resistance right around 115 in the next day or 2, that is a VERY good sign.

NICE move up. New subscription numbers coming to General Public soon ? What say you ?
still a great 5 day and 1 month chart. don’t see this going below $133 anytime soon. next earnings should easily hit $145-$150. we have had a stable run up since earnings. add more on the dips and hold. only take profit if needed.
$169 after earnings....
It's great to believe !!! But ladies and gentlemen your here to make currency..the problem is looking to get a miracle and to reap something from it..mother Theresa would say the same...this is the market not a sit down or pow-wow.

And just when it seemed like Dis was going to tumble ""something"" came around and mDe its share price rise instead of fall.I am in no way saying it will happen again... But if you are shorting Dis, don't be surprised if Dis jumps to new highs when you expect a drop. The next couple of weeks are going to be a blood bath if you try to short Dis. Longs...all you need to do is lean back and enjoy the fruits of your investment.Good luck everyone! Let's get paid! Again... Im a newb investor, but if you are not sure what you are doing, I'd suggest studying the Dis chart before assuming Dis will be pulling back anytime soon."

not going to disney anytime soon and aldo cancelling DIS+ since heading back to woek physically. May be a good buy at 70.
"There is support at $140 from the 100-day moving average, should hold then bounce form here into/after ER"
Its beautiful. As the DIS plan comes together we're going to see even better earnings soon. Risk level low. Love this.
We love Disney plus !!!!
"If Disney buys the rest of Hulu from Comcast, that would mean they own 3 streaming services in its entirety! What other company can say that? None! The holy trinity of 3 streaming services is what's going to make Disney the top player. It allows for consumers to have more control over what they choose to buy and watch. Netflix isn't going anywhere as a company, as they still have good content. But Disney is gassing up and going full throttle with streaming, and will soon zoom past competitors!"
The ideal Disney employee.
someone doesn't want Disney to go over $149. It reminds me to the weeks we didn't go above $132-133. I hope on Monday we will break that resistance due to good news regarding Frozen 2 box office. Fingers crossed
"Everyone knows that you lose money when you pay Goodell for content. Disney pays WAY too much for the new NFL content contract and the stock will go up because everyone is chasing a stock that has gone from profits to losses. Based on the surge in this overvalued stock, another bad management decision should be good for this stock."
"Random thoughts, leading to the question all the way at the bottom :<)• Congratulations long• One can dream but....Disney over 200 in 3 years time • Disney+ is cash cow - Wall Street adores recurring revenue on monthly subscriptionsNow, back to ground• Market is a way too hot, ripe for a correction • Disney will refill gap• Streaming won't be profitable for a short bitWhere do we see Disney coming down to for support before the ascent higher"
"So here is a non-hype recent historical fact on what many folks have shared/said to me on some of the more recent high-flying stocks, say, over the last 5-10 years. ""Wow, I really missed the boats on stocks like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG and NFLX!"" My response to them, just over the last week or so, has been ""Here is your next chance to buy some DIS today when you simply compare the numbers vs. potential to what NFLX has done."" This is coming from a guy who is more of a ""Protect America"" type of fed role (former military) who also has ties to folks working on the trading floors (traders/brokers), and these guys do know value/hype when it comes to those past high flyers and the markets, sentiment, etc... Cheers -SE :)"
"Do you know why the call it ""Disney +""? It is because its Disney + all the money they are making!"
Closing Disney stores and making a bigger push for e-commerce was a power move
Random thought of the day: I think investors should stop worrying about the number of subscribers ESPN+ has and start focusing on what Disney has learned and will learn from their first real streaming platform. They are using the low profile ESPN+ platform to test out the waters for streaming. It doesn't matter as much what is on the platform or how many subscribers there are. The knowledge they have now will allow them to hit the ground running with their streaming service.
Don’t be surprised to see a $500 bill cap very quickly. This is a new company. Unlocking the streaming with it’s content is huge!
"should i buy on a red day like today or wait a couple days before earnings. either way, i’m going long."
"So I just saw Disney cannot stream any pre 2019 star wars content on their streaming service until 2024. Reason being is that the television and streaming rights are owned by TBS. If true, this concerns me."
Disney long term!!! Win win
"For all the longs, it can be so hard to buy on a big down day. Your emotions tell you to sell, but these types of days will be the most profitable when the ship gets turned back around."
I’m expecting more than 30 million subscribers
"Was today a really good day for DIS?It didn't match the pace of its peers, or the S&P 500.DIS +5.52%VIAC +12.15%AMCX +10.06%DISCA + 7.03%FOX + 13.20%ROKU + 9.86%AAPL + 8.72%S&P 500 +7.03%"
No volume at all in after hours!! Tomorrow the upgrades come in and this stock will go up :). Less than 2m shares traded that is nothing :) best of luck tomorrow!!
Cutting through all the hype we see Disney+ only had 1.1 billion revenue for the Q and it continues to fall further behind Netflix.
Glad I picked up some more on Monday morning.
Anyone else see ER bringing this down? More FOX merger losses? Full disclosure: long

"Team Disney - pls don't beat me up. long term, the trend is up...but over the short term. Sold all my shares for a healthy profit during earnings call, looking for re-entry. Market continues to grind higher (sadly, Disney wasn't participating over the last few weeks).Thinking we revisit 128- 129 level.Launch occurring this coming week, but don't think will be positive on stock (you really think they will announce number of subs). The market needs a pullback, a healthy 10-12% pullbackBest of luck on trades, and any thoughts on short term are welcomed"

considering yesterday’s close and this mornings pre market. i’m very happy.
"Disney hiked its DisneyLand prices a sizable amount, but did nothing with DisneyWorld tickets. And then I saw an add for 20% off of DisneyWorld resorts. Although the later may be traditional advertising/campaigns, I will keep a careful I on the DisneyWorld results in the coming earnings report. I probably am reading too much. The DisneyLand hike was sizable. Maybe DisneyWorld will hike prices as its Star Wars attraction opens."
"So I've been wondering, are the posts about politics and religion real people? Just seem really random and out of left field most of the time. I've noticed Dis had a lot of posts like that not too long ago, but they seem to come and go. Any insight?Oh... And Dis green today!  (if I keep saying it, probably dictates I will eventually get it right!)"
"I think I figured something out. Disney has cut back on stock buybacks (over $9 billion last fiscal year, and an announced $6 billion this year - and so far just under that rate for this fiscal year). And dividends, although up, could have been a few pennies more. What are they doing with this extra money?The Fox merger requires them to assume some debt (I think about $10 billion, maybe more). This debt is probably at a higher interest rate than what is routine or what Disney pays. I speculate that the money that they are saving from buying back more stock or paying more dividends will go to pay down this high interest rate debt.They could use the extra money to put into capital expenditures and related items, but they seem to be at a consistent rate (they have put a lot into Shanghai, which, with its opening, has, presumably, gone down, allowing for improvements in the US which have increased). So, I don't think it's going there.Just my thoughts.Just"
Gee... Netflix domestic subscribers flat to down.. wonder why——- Disney+.This will inch up starting today.
"Disney is going to smash 100 million subscribers. The growth of the platform is growing faster each day. I project 200 million easy next year. 2024 number till be hit by 2022. They going to keep lower the year of profitability . Seems so simply , why doubt micky"
disney will loss asian market once for all. all american politican are war mangos. so a recreation company will go no where

"Twitter discussion heavy on Mando actor firing because she warned that: turning people you don't fully agree with into 'others' was a precursor to the violent take-over in Germany. How disney responded to her proved her point entirely. Myself, I have a D+ subscription, and will cancel it TODAY."
"Wait until we see the Disney+ portal programmed into every smart tv menu like Netflix, amazon and YouTube are now. That's when subscribers will dramatically rise. Can smart TVs include such an update or do they need to be sold that way? Has anyone heard what disney might be doing to accomplish this?"

I'm actually surprised the upgrade didn't move this stock at all.
Markets are going up. This will too
"bought back at 145.30. consolidation in the 145s before the next leg up to 160s. Disney will be a $200 when it hits 50 million Disney+ subscribers, my estimate by summer 2020."
"I love Disney but what upside are longs expecting now? Reopening of parks, success for Disney plus, priced in so what's the benefit of holding? the market will beat this stock for at least a couple of years. I would rather pay taxes on my gains and get hundreds of % in the meantime somewhere else, so many good businesses with success not yet priced in. DTIL, SHSP, KLDO, MGNI even SWKS will do better..."
I wonder what magical fairy will produce more money out of thin air for Comcast to win this bid...Disney already owns all the magical fairies.
The streaming interface is smooth and the initial content including the simple search features along the top of the streaming site is about as user-friendly as one could imagine. To think of the ESPN+ w/ HULU bundle on the additional content such as Family Guy and live sports will be epic as content continues to build; including all of the original content in the works .....so one word #Amazing
"I think we need a little realty. Disney does seem to have made a nice level just over 140. It revisited the highs of about a week ago, and even exceeded them for a few minutes on Tuesday, but couldn't hold them. I'm not one for technical numbers, but it seems to have a base of 140 for the moment. Can it move much higher? Not much for the next few months. Maybe Toy Story can cause a pop IF it breaks $200 million for an opening weekend (it seems to be around $165 million, which really isn't too shabby). And maybe Lion King can move it, but only with its own $200 million plus opening weekend. - We're really lucky if it exceeds 145 because of these two items, and I doubt that because movies are not the immediate movers they once were.Earnings report in early August? I think that an unadjusted number (without streaming preparation costs and Fox costs) of $2.40 - $2.50 is possible. But, as nice as this is (as it will begin to put a down payment on the Fox costs, thereby reducing interest costs), the real news that could help is the streaming news - specifically a date for the opening of Disney+ and a date that people can sign up for Disney+. This certainty could add 5 points. But with all this, it is only possible for Disney to reach the high 140's (although staying over 140 should be considered a nice achievement).The real even is November's opening of Disney+ . Will signups be significant? (5 - 10 million by the end of December would be a nice accomplishment, and I think 10 - 20 million is a possibility). Will Disney have a few new shows just for Disney+ when it opens? - this ""teaser"" seemed to move Disney in April. If Disney dips under 137.5, it may be worth picking up more. I'm kicking myself for not picking up a little more at 108 back in March."
This should be at least 198...stop selling cheap!!!
Rate cut coming if it’s 1/2% then markets will hit new highs Friday Disney will hit 150 +Earnings will push 160 +They made alone over 20 billion on 4 movies so far

"For everybody concernced about the Disney+ (the new streaming platform).Right now 46% of disney revenue comes from media networks. That amounts for $23.5billion. $16.5b comes from cable networks (disney channels and espn) and the other $6.9b from broadcasting (abc group and radio networks). AnalysisThe cable networks are divided between ESPN and Disney Channels (xd, junior and the normal one.) ESPN has and audience of aprox 80 millions usersDisney Channel has and audience of 90 million in the USA and another 130million internationally.Taking out ESPN and focusing on the Disney channels, the disney channels rack up aprox $10-12b from that revenue. That means that at a price of 7.99$ x suscription, the disney channel would need 104 million suscribers to match that revenue (half of what they currently have on the network tv channels)ConclusionDisney channels are now currently watched by kids only but diseny is planning to put franchises like star wars and captain america, and nat geo, which would potentially increase the audience to nerds and long time fans of the series. Plus: Netflix is trading at 132 times their earnings. This is because investors think that netflix can penetrate markets like china and india, which they clearly havn't been able to do. Disney will, because all the movies they make are huge $1b+ box offices around the world.This means that when disney+ gets out netflix will have to pour even more money to create content and report losses to compete, while disney already has a ton of premium content, plus all the content from 21 fox century. When the contracts are up, why would tv shows and movies be on netflix when disney is taking over? Comapanies will switch and netflix in 2 years will be absolete."
"Disney vs Comcast: Fox Assets (My thoughts)I don’t see any way that Comcast would win Fox over Disney. Curious to here others thoughts 1) Murdock’s prefer Disney are are large shareholders/voting power. Rupert would rather chew glass then sell to Comcast.2) DIS is better strategic fit (Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar, ESPN) and best in class at monitoring content across its vast media empire. 3) DIS all stock offer is a tax free spin to FOX shareholders. Comcast’s all cash offer would be a tax event. 4) DIS has a 6 month head start over Comcast on Regulatory approval.6) DIS has balance sheet strength, cash and liquidity to win a bidding war. I guarantee DIS will match or exceed CMCSA bid 7) Ego’s: Disney’s Bob Iger and Comcast’s Brian Brian Roberts have long rivalry as media titans."
"What was that little dip about! I'm guessing some don't want Disney to fork up the extra cash just to compete with Comcast, but oh well. Shorts can throw their fits while I hold for the long ride. I'm a firm believer this acquisition will be better in the long run, regardless of what Disney has to pay."
Buying some before open tomorrow. Have a feeling this thing will take off tomorrow once buyers get a chance to hear about today’s news.
"May will be over soon and the ""sell in May crowd"" will be coming back in. This trade talk may linger and push everything down, but DIS is a strong one and has lots of irons in the fire that could push it up. I bought 200 more shares today. Added 1000 shares in last 2 weeks."
A majority of $dis income is gone for atleast a month and there still paying there employees for the time being . Puts are the way to go
Disney+ and Apple TV+ will be the top 2 TV/Movie streaming services in less than 1 year.
"It appears DIS will be the breakout story of 2021 if it continues to show subscription growth at current levels. This is truly the proverbial crown jewel of streaming, media, and entertainment."
"Small limit order in for $121, go DIS.."
Godzilla awaken to reign fire on shorts....
Disney is the absolute worst stock you could be in given present circumstances. I normally don't short stocks but if I did it would be Disney and Twitter. I suspect a short wall grab huge gains in a very short amount of time.
I read on Apple news that Disney Parks won’t open until January 2021. I brought around 80 and I’m a long term. I believe this is going down much further than 80 . Be careful with your cash guys
Last week Thursday and Friday was oversold on DIS. This week will rise again and again. I bet you more and more subscribers join DISNEY. Kids love it.
I did major research before buying Disney long term. I also know the streaming business will only accelerate Disney ecosystem and revenue streams throughout it business lines. I also know Disney hasn’t had a stick split in many years because they only split after breaking and maintaining $100/share price. Disney is still a small company compared to some of the behemoth companies and this might be their last chance at buying Disney before they become defacto in streaming business. I predict $170 by January earnings date or a buyout at $250. Good luck to all investors 
"was it priced in or was it not price in, that is the question! :-DD"
"up 2% after market, likely with Netflix’s subscriber beat, giving the idea that Disney might burn through estimates too"
"Here’s something to consider if you’re short go long if your long go longer Disney has not missed back to back quarterly numbers since Iger has been CEO. I’m guessing when Iger even thinks he’s going to miss his numbers he goes all in to make sure they don’t miss the following quarter, a good CEO will pre order in the bad quarter and eat the loss to make sure he doesn’t miss the following quarter. Second point, guidance was lowered to .95 when last quarter miss they made $1.35, so peak season summer the parks and theaters are full of customers but earnings are less than 2 years ago? I’ll give the thought that starting streaming was expensive but I know Iger was smart enough to order in previous quarter so he didn’t have added expense in this quarter. Go long trust Iger is a great CEO and will beat the numbers and with Verizon deal and pre-order raise guidance. Bank it "

"Africa Strain in the US. Anything considered a re-opening trade is going down. Unfortunately, DIS has parks."
"Dis- way over valued, A lot of big giant businesses and profits come from the theme parks and they are still dead after a year"
"Can't believe anyone is selling DIS. This baby going to be trading at $200 by next summer, if it's not sooner.With the holidays coming, all the new movies, streaming, theme parks, cruises and stores ... mama mia!"
"i think we should all stop guessing and especially posting $150 and other price targets every week. We all though Frozen 2 would take the stock over $150 today. well. it hasn’t happen and even if it did. it wouldn’t be because of that now. Earnings and Disney+ is all that matters now. Till then, Buy the dips or keep buying if your Disney 4Life!"
Disney's chart looks exactly like SPY. It's just moving with the market
Netflix is now in 190 countries. Disney+ is only in 24 now and growing rapidly.
just got disney+ bundle! 12.99 let's see what it's all about !
Will it drop after earnings?
every1 jumping on the disney train easy money for everybody
DIS is a long term holder. Company's revenue will only grow after Covid.
Netflix has been reward with a big p/e ratio. Disney's could now be perceived with the same p/e magnitude with the intro of Disney+. And how stable and ingrained a company can you otherwise find. DIS has a very big future.
190-195$We all know next month 240-250$+Short sellers you are waisting your time
Major trouble for dis Sell the close

"This board just got spammed big time with shorts. Hulu Disney + bundle for 12.99 is a huge announcement. Keeping the ads on Hulu will be a revenue generator. I don't really mind that much, we have the ad free Hulu now and it's $11.99. We will definitely get the bundle."
Yay!! finally!!
last week people were dishing DIS. Now they can't get enough of it. They totally forgot the re-opening trade stocks are in play till it fully open. And we still have at least several months of re-opening trade to work out.

Just added more on this great price! Happy Friday y'all!
"Disney cruising is dead in the water (pun not intended), Parks are closed and costing company about $20 million a day, movies are all delayed. Employees laid off or furloughed. What positive news is there in the next 2-3 months? There’s no way of knowing the full extent of damage. $50 might be a stretch but not impossible. More like $70 in next drop."
How are my options for next week down?
plus side.. .we have 1 less company in the mix with HULU.. might make a buyout closer and a combo deal more easily achieved :)
"Watched Captain Marvel with the family. We enjoyed it for the most part, but felt like the story dragged sometimes. I noticed a lot of the scenes and humor in the movie were intended for the female audience. So, I liked it, but it's definitely not my favorite Marvel movie. That said, I can definitely see this movie breaking box office numbers. What's more important, I think Marvel created a character on par with Wonder Woman. This Christmas, expect little girls to ask for Captain Marvel, and Wonder Woman toys! "
Our patience with the stock will be rewarded
Any less than $200 is a crime to humanity and completely undervalued.
At what amount do you think DIS might think of a stock split?
just cant leave 110
Will hold until 400 then split 1 for 4 and still hold strong. This will be DIS turn in this decade for content is king.
Do y’all ever just want to punch an option?? Like actually just punch it.. right out the window ugh 
The bots are going crazy on here pumping a massive selloff. 1.) Why does Yahoo not censor their comments? 2.) Why has Disney been stuck in this range? They've now probably surpassed 100MM global subscribers.
"James Demarco, has stated that DIS, is over priced.VZ, great buying opportunity."
Will be interested to see latest monthly institutional buying and selling of Disney this November. I think they traded a ton of shares this past month. Lots of new calls at $165-$220 which usually means something exciting is brewing. I would love to see Amazon or Apple take a bite out of Disney  expect the unexpected this month.
Booyah boys and girls 120+ tomorrow
"Can someone explain how Disney can be worth more today than a year ago? Because of the pandemic, they lost around 8 billions in earning vs what they would have made otherwise (to date). How many years of Disney + will it take to compensate for that lost stream of earning?Also, while they will eventually bring in money with Disney+ and ESPN+, this will for sure cannibalize some revenue stream from cable tv. I am a big fan of Disney content, Marvel stuff in particular. But can't jump on the stock at those valuation. What am I missing that others are seeing??"
"Yahoo really needs to control the political talks on here. Changing topic, how about WandaVision?! Amazing show"
"Iger, I hope you considered your over zealous political correctness in your recent move to pull off Fox. A lot of decent people support the police and believe things are getting pushed too far by the radical left. You too can be replaced."
"Let’s all be realistic, DIS will not open this year! We need the VACCINE!"
"i shouldn't have bought this if i wasn't willing to add if it dropped,"

Buy the dip!!!!
doodoo day in the market today. If you have some cash its a good day to make some moves.
Give me 150 Earnings will push 160
Any negatives were cleared away today - may be slight dip in a.m. and then mover over $118
AVENGERS already passed TITANIC just in two weeks. It will hit 3 billion dollars within less than 2 months. The latest number in over 2.1 billion dollars.
Disney will benefit massively from this virus. The HULU and Disney + sales are being ridiculously accelerated. Parks will be up and running at full capacity by July. Super excited about the long play. Definitely see a plunge coming in the next three weeks.
Marvel and Sony agreed to new deal. Spider-Man is officially part of the Marvel universe once again.
Huge potential despite being near all time highs
When parks do open at full capacity I expect this to triple.
Only 2.00???? wth?
Come on Mickey!!! Daddy needs a Mansion in Cancun

Guys disney plus will surpass netflix subscribers. When people say $700/share PT I honestly wouldnt be surprised after seeing a lowly retailer like gamestop go up 3200%..these are different times and this is a real opportunity to get in on the ground floor of disney's eventual streaming dominance. Disney plus is at almost 90 million subscribers with just mando and their original content....disney projects 240 million subscribers in four years. They low ball their predictions...They said 60 million subscribers in four years...They hit that target in less than a year..
jeezus this stock is not moving.
Disney has earnings approaching relatively soon... a run up before earning that leads into a beat could push DIS above 150 I hope they beat all these other big players have been above 150 for a while DIS deserves to be their also
A large put at $170 of 3m bucks was bought on Disney today for March 2020 I told you this was a fight lol 
Just announced Disney Plus on Amazon
"Let’s assume 15M subscribers. Assuming all are paying $7, that’s about $100M per month in revenue, assuming people stick around after episode 8 of Mando."
Google was down 4% AH last night and finish UP 1% today. I really don't care what AH pricing is at such a low volume. Tomorrow we'll see the true determination.

I honestly thought today would have been some profit taking. Pleasantly surprised by this today.
endgame was beautiful i saw
"Dis has both sides covered, get out and stay at home....set up is solid, technically looks good also......expect 200 shortly"
I've never understood how supports work. Keep listening to people saying the next support is at this price and so on but what's the point of it if you don't know whether it will hold on support or break it?
"Big win for Disney!!! Hulu, FX buy rights to show Lions Gate films - report https://seekingalpha.com/news/3470609?source=ansh"
"Disney gets $26 billion or 35% of total $75 billion revenue from Theme park, hotel, and cruise ships. $5 billion or 50% of the $10 billion net income is from Theme park, hotel and cruise ships. In the next 3 months to 6 months, a significant part of those revenues and profits will evaporate and will mostly be losses as there will be substantially less revenue from that segment. That is $6 billion in quarterly revenue from this segment on average. Disney movies will also take a big hit. In 2018, Disney had $3.1 billion revenue from movies and in 2019 Disney had a hopping $13 billion revenue from movies! https://apnews.com/1eef5653bdf27f2cb1a99b56ba18cfc5.The above two segments combined, Disney generated $39 billion out of the $75 billion, or 52%. In 2020, these two segments will take a huge hit when compared to 2019 due to the coronavirus as the pandemic spread throughout the world. Can the newly formed online video streaming business replace that quickly? I doubt it. Don't listen to any one who will tell you so. At best, online video streaming business will have an annual revenue run-rate of $4 to $5 billion by the end of 2020. In this likely scenario, Disney stock price can easily drop 40% to 50% from 52-week high of $153, yielding a stock price range between $76 and $90 per share."
"Why is everyone suddenly acting like us Disney longs think Netflix is no good? I personally love Netflix and think it’s content it better ( for me) than Disney’s. But as a parent I’m all over Disney+. Lots of my friends are into marvel and Star Wars stuff , so they love the idea of Disney+. So both have there demographics. If Disney finds a way to make more edgy stuff and add that stuff from fox to Hulu then I’m getting a bundle :) we can all win folks."
I have no doubt this Disney will report great Frozen 2 numbers and more grear Disney+ numbers. The issue is when will they release those and how much will price fluctuate until then. I will keep accumulating meanwhile.
Wait for it. It’s coming. Blowout ER around the corner.

That being said, there is only so long I can continue to have my money essentially put to sleep."

"I am not touching predictions on earnings with a ten foot pole. And they are really meaningless. There are only two issues - is the Fox merger going better (unlikely, although it will all work out - this weekend's opening of the nicely touted Ford v. Ferrara might help a little). Second, the real question, is streaming. We really won't know anything until next quarter, but is Disney willing and able to tell us how many customers they have signed up already and/or how many they expect to have on day one next week? And then, if so, will the number impress?Earnings only mean anything to the extent that they pay down their debt from the Fox purchase."

Disney world sold out for spring break
Buying with both hands on any dip
"I'm beginning to focus on Avengers Endgame. It is breaking records in China for presales. I thought that a worldwide opening weekend of $850 million was optimistic, and I criticized someone for suggesting $1 billion, but I think that is very possible. China could easily break $200 million (Avengers Infinity was $199 million), and it is a 5 day weekend there. I think $300 million is possible in the US (I just checked my local theater, and they have 23 showings on Thursday, and 21 are essentially sold out - the 1:00 a.m. and 1:15 are very empty, but I think they just added them). I think the US and China numbers could total $550 million. I think the UK and South Korea could add $50 million each. And then Brazil, France Germany, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Philippines, and India could average at least $25 million each. That gives you $850 million alone. It may be be difficult to glean the rest elsewhere, and it really has to break the numbers mentioned above, but $1 billion is not out of the question. And that means that it may approach $2 billion by the end of the second weekend. This could be quite a bonanza."
What you think a best case for Disney's stock is a year from now? 20% gain from here likely? Thats $235
"I didn’t buy Disney for this earnings report, I do believe however Iger isn’t paid $66M annually to miss earnings two quarters in a row, a seasoned CEO knows how to navigate those type of problems. Today is about GUIDANCE not numbers will they guide higher EPS, release early adoption rates, etc. This company is worth way more than $130/share my guess is a hostile bidder would offer $250/$300 easily and who wouldn’t want the Disney brand? This is a double or triple in 18 months as long as they can roll out streaming services seamlessly."
Mickey charge

This will complete Disney's entrance into steaming in a very big way.Overseas numbers are coming in on Avengers End Game. China's first day haul of $107 plus was complimented by anouther $45 million (I am actually a little disappointed, but one can't complain about $152 million, when Avengers Infinity did about $190 million in its entire first weekend). Other markets are 40% to 98% higher. I think $1 billion for a first weekend is very likely at this point. The only question is whether the US number is over $300 million."
I can’t see anything on Disney+ everytime I click on a title it says “Oh No” there’s been a problem
"We finally moved up a little today (in a down market). This stock should be 2 - 4 points higher. It had a nice purchase. It's Star Wars movie, and others, are doing nicely, and even the dollar is dipping which helps it overseas income (which is a lot considering the overseas box office.I'll add this - the backlash against SWTLJ, which I think is a small but very vocal and savvy minority, may help increase the box office as it may draw in some to see what all the controversy is about.We should see another bump in February when they announce earnings for the first quarter."
Lots of growth ahead!
"Bugs are a good thing, system under max load because people are LOVING IT!"
wow! What is the reason stocks are rising?
The Legend Mario Gabelli called this to go to $200 back at the end of 2019; his estimate is off; this can go to $300/sh by eoy
ALERT: Over 20 million unemployed and counting. Virus running rampant. Global depression under way. US is a consumer economy and the consumer is not buying anything. Therefore cities are not getting sales tax revenue.Energy sector going bust. Corporate debt will continue to be downgraded. Sell while there are still buyers!! You have been warned Plan accordingly.
going to 95 next week
What do you believe the subscriber count of Disney+ is already baked into this number? I feel like its in the 15 million range.
"where are all the shorts talking about it’s going down, hahaha."
"Sorry to say but Disney seems quite screwed in the short term... - lost a great CEO in time of crisis- Disney Shanghai/Japan closed- Disney Cruises impacted - Disneyworld hours reduced now- Disneyworld potentially close- Cinemas to be hit hardest by CV- Many movie release dates to be pushed out- Many Asian themed movies in production may have limited audience The only bright spot might be Disney+, if they can leverage that and move their new movies to premiere there instead of in cinemas.Long term I’m bullish but seems like a lot of pain coming... they will likely be forced to close Disneyworld soon."
"This board has gone half Disney, half Qanon. Shame. I wish yahoo would delete what doesn't pertain to the stock. Price targets upped to around $220, I'll hold."
A 32 p/e would take Disney to $230/share.. Netflix p/e is over 100 !
Netflix earnings is going past 550
"If Disney sells ESPN, its stock price would soar!"
"Wandavision release tomorrow, huge pop for the stock"
Why is DIS the laggard here?? Everyone's up 1% while house of mouse is not even half of that
"What an over hyped joke! Disney plus will save us... please. This stock is a terrible short term investment. Hold and forget it, eventually it will crawl up at a snails pace."
I think BigJoe has about 15 million this week on DIS alone according to adding up all his posts.
Whose buying now?
"THEME PARKS AND MOVIE THEATRES CLOSED FOR A YEAR SO FAR - Price keeps rising, earnings ok ? What am I missing this stock should be tanking. Disney just announced its closing blue sky studios their animation producer."
"Trading weird, too many retirement mm's keeping falsely priced."
Amazing....50% of revenues are GONE for the next year - parks ARE NOT gonna open this year. and the stock is down what? 20%
Disney announced they are Not hiking prices for the July Reopening.
Is Disney going to buy WWE?
"Anyone else think Dis movement today was unusual? I can't remember the last time it it stayed within a 20 cent range for so long. That sudden spike at the end was also interesting.But anyway, that's in the past. Time to enjoy the weekend.Good luck next week Dis Fam! Let's hope Monday brings us some good news. "
We’re going to the moon boys 
"I don't know why so many people freak out over new streaming services. I honestly don't see Disney as a Netflix killer and I REALLY don't see Apple hurting either one at this time. I have position in both DiS and NFLX and I have been adding to both. DIS is family oriented and NFLX can be a bit more adult. I look at it this way, The Disney channel and HBO co-existed for years I think there is room for DIS and NFLX for the foreseeable future. Am I seeing this wrong?"
Buy it up fellas. Be good little bag holders. Lolol
"Once again WHY is Disney still trading below $150? Blockbusters after blockbusters movies, record Disney+ subscriptions and jamb packed theme parks! Doesn't make any sense to me at all."
"GUYS START BUYING NOW, NEWS ON THE WAY. WILL BE 110 VERY SOON"
Does anyone actually pay for Disney+?
This explains the dip today...https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/11/vanguard-cuts-expected-return-for-stock-market-over-the-next-decade.html
"Top pick tonight on BNN. Disney + not even available internationally yet. As it rolls out, subscribers will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate. Product line is extensive."
"My ultimate Disney stock plan: buy long term puts. Sell the puts, and put it all back into shares. Bear short term, bull long term"
"Some really good posts guys thank you. I’m thinking about investing in Disney, looking for opinions. Should I wait to see what happens this week or end of month? Thank you all￼"
Looks like Dis has support at 183.00. Time to buy!
Sentiment will remain strong in the coming month. This may hit 20 p/e multiple before correction.
"TAX BILL QUESTION. Is there an accountant in the house? I recall our CEO over the summer in an interview on CNBC saying last year the House of Mouse paid a 34% federal tax rate. Yahoo shows ebitda at $16.8 billion. My calculator says that would have made federal taxes over $5.7 billion. New rate (20%) comes in around $3.2 Billion. Is Disney really going to save around $2.5 billion a year on federal taxes if law is passed or am I missing something, like perhaps the impact of over seas earnings?"
so happy disney isn’t a trade war stock.
"I’ll tell you all a secret. Once it goes back to 110.00 I’m selling, deleting the symbol and never looking back. Good look to all longs."
"A monthly subscription model, is where it's at. Look what it's done for Amazon, Amazon Prime. Excellent model. Volume, and low fee, is the key. Solid business plan."
"i bought a call contract 110, jan 18. i really hope it can reach it."
Say 100m users=1b in revenue and only 500m in profits. Not so much after all. Right now we are only 1/10th of the way there.
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4311509-disney-content-prom-queen-is-constant-buy
Think they will do another 10 million next week when they open it up to Australia Puerto Rico and New Zealand...Hey Europe in March..ASIA UP NEXT..DIS IS THE NEW Wall Street DARLING ...$350.00 12 months
"everyone talks about Netflix and original content, but Disney is the original king of original content. they have 90 years of original content."
Finally some magic from the Magic Kingdom!
"112? CHECK!Im guessing a little time to digest before the push to 115...But Dis has been consistently pushing up for the past two weeks.If investors shake off the fear, Dis could break out again this week! BTW! I'm just giving my opinion and should be viewed as such. I'm long on Dis and bullish. "
seeking alpha said the movie could bring in 1 billion dollars
Get ready for Frozen 2 big impact on quote next week!!
2.8 Billion A PossibilityMarvel Studios Blockbuster Could Pass $2.8 Billion Record Set by 'Avatar' to Become Highest-Grossing Movie of All Time
Will this hit $250 by April 16?
"Bought subscription for Disney plus yesterday, love the app. Time for long position here"
$127M in US alone and $350M worldwide ... just the first 3 days. WOW!! $155 here we come this week!
Sure be nice if Yahoo did something about all the spam on these boards!
"DIS has performed unfavorably since the effects of cord-cutting became a real threat. Once the revenues from dtc priducts start to balance things out, and eventually tip the scales, I suspect to see another breakout similar to previous multi-year runs. The breakout is inevitable. DIS generates huge revenues and operates very efficiently. Solid company for generations to come."
Yes everyone saw the bomb coming except the analysts that were guided by Disney to much higher forecasts
Disney + averaging 1m subscribers per day see you st 160-175 
I’m going to Disneyland.. and Disney paid for it. Thank you!
3 star war movies in the making and 3 marvel movies. Here comes another Billion per movie (my words)
Those >=195 calls are looking pretty bad today.
Did people start traveling and are the parks open..stock up on what news?
"Disney is a covid proof stock. Stock should be going up, more pandemic just means more streaming subscribers"
When I got to the office this morning everyone was talking about how they canceled the Disney streaming service.
The shorts are about to get steam rolled and they apparently know it based on the posts below that are trying to scare longs out of their positions with absolutely nothing to support their point of view.
Frozen 2 in theaters tonight!!! Excited for the movies release as it will positively impact the stock.
"Sold my AABA shares and wanting to find something else....so I bit the bullet at $139..not wanting to miss the Star Wars wave, although i should've bought way sooner...but now I'm still glad I bought in!"
Thanks DIS! out of my 480 Aug 145 calls. In at 2.3 average out at average 4.65. 100K profit. Plan was to be out before FD and Disney earnings. Don't care if I miss any pop at earnings. Evaluate where Disney is going after those big events. Also China questions this week. Thanks again for the opportunity Disney!
"Everyone who is congratulating themselves for a run up today at close remember this post on Monday... next week will be bad, you can't have all your major business units close and expect the stock to rally like this. Fully expect Disney to be down to $90 by end of week next week."
love holding this stock. low risk high reward. Not easy to find that. holding for months is no risk high reward. :)
140 tomorrow
I wonder if there will be a dividend raise.
1 HOUR to go green end of day !!! COME ON DIS !
Heil Disney
This May surge on Monday. Iger lives to make this stock go up. Disney execs are paid in large amounts of stock
This is revolutionary move by Disney ! It will pass Netflix imo
"I've posted a lot in the past, being very strong on Disney. I've taken the position that Disney is a company for the ages, will provide entertainment through various channels for a world that will have more and more emphasis on entertainment in an expanding worldwide economy - it would only be jeopardized if there were some worldwide catastrophe.Ten days ago I liquidated my entire retirement portfolios; because: (i) we were facing a worldwide catastrophe, (ii) I couldn't put my family's future at risk, (iii) the news was going to get worse and worse, only adding pressure on the markets, (iv) whenever I've seen this played out in the past (1987, 2001, 2008), the loss wasn't just in the first few days, but over the months to come (and we were into this for only about 2 weeks), and (v) I believed that our President did not have the capacity act competently (I don't mean this politically, but objectively - his demeanor is set by his headstrong attitude, which is not consistent with good management in a crisis - even after his change in tone (widely complimented) in the last day, he still rated himself a 10 (not a humble position), referred to the virus as a ""China"" virus, and blamed China). I was a little tempted to go back into Disney when it was under 80 for a few moments today - but it is very hard to catch a falling knife. I think the Dow will hit 17,500, and stabilize there. If I'm right, you could see Disney revisit 80, and probably 75 - if real panic sets in, 50 is a possibility.But things will return. People will go to the Parks and Movies. I will go back into this market, particularly Disney, and a host of other stocks that I got out. And remember, the stock market performs best under Democrats (and this statement is partly objective and partly political) .Good luck. And stay healthy."
"I agree with a lot of people that $50 is a bit drastic right now. $65 to $70 might be a safe bet to land though. The problem is all their major revenue streams are shut down right now + cost associated with running them in the meantime, changing of the CEO is happening, and this virus is only going to potentially get worse over the next 45 days, cost with working with backed up reservation, potential extra customer care cost, automation breakdowns, just lot of extra cost that are going to hit on next earnings and one after, that are also going to cost some points. So, it's not a hold, but yes $50 is drastic considering current information. Wait 2-3 weeks, we'll be in the $65-$70 range."
By the volume in puts looks like a lot of people are betting on $110-$115 by end of Oct.
"Stock pumpers are so entertaining; this prices are great. lolDIS is not a buy until it get below $103 and even then its still a bit risky unless you are VERY VERY LONG.Parks have the potential of being shut down, movie theaters already postponing premiers, what about the additional cost they will incur in the following months-years from clean up etc....Anyone that is seeing something that I am not, please share because I am trying to figure out if it makes sense to buy a stock and hold it over the weekend with all of these unknowns."
"Stocking up on Disney soon and patiently waiting for them to launch their Disney Streaming Service in 2019. With the amount of content Disney has, it will put Netflix to shame. Just Imagine Marvel, FOX, Lucas Films, Pixar, All their animated shows, cartoons and Kids shows. It will be an instant beast for all genres."
"Today’s news is that Netflix is increasing its debt by $2 billion, with increased competition from Disney and Apple I can’t see how Netflix can handle more debt without reviewing its all business model, I like DIS more and more because has deeper pockets and income from multiple sources, going long."
"While you guys are arguing about earnings, gold and silver markets, which are still open and trading are skyrocketing. Gold up almost $50/ounce, silver about $1.50.....keep arguing folks :-)"
"Folks 2 weeks back were pumping/cheering for '220'. I'm watching the stock, watching a general downward slide. It will be snagged for the call deadline Fri, but then go back below 175, then fall even lower when inevitable dismal earnings are reported. Very curious to hear their D+ subscription numbers after their mismanagement."
"To my DIS holders, how are we feeling about Iger possibly stepping down come 2021 ?? I’m trying to stay for the long haul but I want to know what are some of your thoughts for the future of DIS if he really decides to step down ... I finally got into the stock world back in August and bought shares for DIS so I’m still all new to this lol"
mario gabelli says with conviction dis stock goes to $200 in 2 years. follow the moola
Reservations are needed to visit the new Star Wars Galaxy Edge at Disneyland Los Angeles between May 31 and June 23. Estimated wait time for the rides could be up to 8 hours....and they just keep on coming!! Disney is firing on all cylinders....
Anyone brilliant enough to have bought this stock this morning on inane sell-off in the $185 range is to be congratulated. You are brilliant and a WINNER! Stock will soar Monday plus the nice gain you made today.
"Fox to sell Sky stake to Comcast https://seekingalpha.com/news/3393110?source=ansh $FOX, $FOXA, $SKYAY, $CMCSA, $DIS"
Might be green tomorrow. DIS is not as much reliant on China business as Techs are.
after disney reports and the virus is controlled. the market will go up 500 points and disney will run to $175
When does DIS announce their DIV
"Going to 150, all ABOARD!"
"IN the end everyone will try to stream. But like one analyst said...only a few 'top dogs"" will win....NFLX and DIS are the 2 BIG DOGS that will own this space...Amazon Prime Video also. Now excuse me while I drink a bottle of bleach to prevent Covid infection."
Someone at Disney looking at yahoo message board. I posted an hour ago someone should be fired for not announcing subs till earning report. Then magically an article comes out 15 min later. You’re welcome guys. This was all me. 
Just wait until subscriber numbers come out. This rally is just beginning
Day 1 launch - exceeded their most aggressive expectations.

"I am seriously doubting they will make a lot of money of disneyplus in the first few years, but i am definitely gonna switch from netflix."
I am from India and we love streaming.. eagerly waiting disney+ .. not to mention very positive impact on the overall growth
$170 here we come!!!!
"Fast Money confirmed 25M downloads from Apptopia not adding this week, new Star Wars movie launches and Christmas will add even more subscribers sorry but this is MM trying to manipulate until earnings or new figures are released buy,add, hold and tell family and friends to hold on for a long ride higher "
Have $190C for tomorrow. Hold them?
15 days until opening of Galaxy's Edge! Major competition for Universal's Wizarding World.
This is shocking. Just like after the blow out Amazon earnings. Fundamentals are no longer working.

I expect the $79 low to be tested again next weekThe Elliot wave theory predicts this as well
If one only knew 1 year ago :) good for those who invested !! Right now valuations seems abit stretched
Great price to buy this money machine!
Buy more now cheap and then wait for next quarter earnings to POP!! Who’s with me?

"Here’s what I can foresee, Iger announces Disney + launch in China 2020 with ESPN bundle then we go overnight from $190 to over $250 per share just need to ink and announce deal imo"
"So, NFLX hammering DIS again today. NFLX making ANOTHER new ALL TIME HIGH while this 'so called' stock languishes. NFLX - I'm sure glad I bought this months back vs. this stock. Oh, and you guys can have the divi. I would rather make the nice capital gains (almost doubled in a year). Thank you very much!"
Had a friend who went to the premiere on Monday. He said people were standing up and applauding at the end.
Lol... Anyone else added during today's dip? 
It is quite safe to stick with DIS at this time around. ALADDIN is coming and the park's new theme will open at the end of the month. It brings more MOJO to the stock.
Older Star Wars movies are in 4K!?!?! Goodbye forum see you in 16 hours or so.....
Disney's rsi is way oversold on the daily chart. Disney will need to rally multiple days in a row to correct! Short sellers will give us a nice rally as they cover losses in the days ahead!
"Here's a blunt forum pole: Compare a red ""ent media/tech"" apple in NFLX with a current PE of 98 and SP at 307 vs a larger red ent/tech apple in DIS with a current PE of 22 and an SP at 147 vs existing/future content with everything each company puts out. So the pole is what should or where will the PE's and SP's of each company be in just 1 year, 2-3 years and, say, 5 years from now is the pole forum question? Hint: DIS = 1923 vs NFLX = 1997 (history)"
"Food for thought:$DIS has rallied $21 billion with the news that their new streaming service added 10mil new users at $7 a pop. This is the equivalent to the entire market cap of Snapchat. With that same logic, when Snapchat gained 10mil users at $2.5 ARPU shouldn't the stock have rallied 3/7th of the Disney move. Combined that with another 10 mil users between 3rd and 4th quarter 2019. That should make up the entire move of Disney aka Snapchat valued at $40bil."
1000 shares @98 and holding for the next 5 thousand years
If you bought PUTS for 131 ... for 60 cents :) your in the money take that quarter and get a gum ball
"just look/think of it on the reverse sentiment side of things ......so when the MM's want to sling shot DIS back up we may just see another 12 pt move as we did last month! we based in the low 130's, now we are basing in the mid 140's, next run i see DIS basing in the mid 150's, and so on ..... = not too shabby from some 52 weeks ago! happy holidays -se :)"
Still to be released this year. Mulan and Frozen 2. Frozen will be huge. Enormous profits.
330 in 3 weeks
$200 by end of 2019!!!

"What's the next big thing here since The Avengers is done now and that pop to $142 lasted for a split second?? Summer is approaching, the markets slow down, don't want to sit at these levels or lower all Summer."
Should I buy now or will it drop again down to 100 or less
"The much higher income taxes coming will be GOOD for Disney! People will have less money for entertainment, travel, dining out, and to buy things. What will they do? Disney+ streaming."
"When you think about what Disney has upcoming this year and the fact that it has been range bound for so long, it should fly to the moon!"
UNDERVALUED IMO.......GEEEESH CMG TRADES AT $1500
"What do you guys think the outcome of the earnings call on 5/5/20? It is obvious that it would be bearish. Due to the virus forcing Disney to shut down Theme parks, Cruises, Hotels, Slowing down movie productions, subscriptions from sports, and more. Causing them to be losing millions of dollars for these 3 months. You can't tell me Disney Plus will make this bullish on earning call. When it comes to seeing the future of the company for the next quarter. It will not be good for them as well since they are still force to be shut down for most of there assets and productions will still be slow. Unless they are allow to open if they manage to test every single person to go into there theme parks, etc."
"Does anyone think that Comcast will end up getting Sky? If so, would you sell the rest of sky to them? And why doesn't Disney just go buy 12% of sky on the open market and when the fox deal closes they will have 51%of sky."
"WASHINGTON – The White House is not ready to roll out specific economic proposals in its response to the widening impact of the coronavirus outbreak, administration officials told CNBC"
DIS would be ripe for 300 price tag if we were still early in this bull market..now im not so sure...
I have no words. But tomorrow is another day.
"So much for my ""analysis"". I thought Dis hitting 120 was good... But 130?If only all of my mistakes could reward my bank account the way Dis has done today.Congratulations to everyone who made money Today!Cheers!"
This market is one big mess!
When is Disney going to open Disneyland and tell Gruesome Newsom they don't care about his illegal orders? I can't see how he could ever stop them. Maybe he would have the mouse shot?
"I understand you may think this is a deal, but they have no parks open, no sports and movie productions have been suspended. WDW will lose billions in the next quarter. I think this stock honestly goes down to between $60-$75."
Rough day for DIS. Everyone that bought after the earnings report in under water. I thought DIS would try to consolidate @$140 but it seems the earnings report is getting used to trim or dump the position. Very disappointing action in DIS. Do we recover or do we go back to the low $130’s. I thought the report and streaming was a game changer but it seems it is not the case. Thoughts? Any hope DIS recovers?
Can I get some thumbs up for the desperation of #CoveringTommy!
The Sony deal is a big win for future Marvel movies. Spiderman is the most well known and popular of all Marvel characters
"As if by some strange miracle, Dis rises back to 12.25 premarket. Monday is going to be very interesting. I imagine either a solid push up to 12.75, or a drop back to 11.50."
"CS raised PT to $218, JPM raised to $220; everyone reiterating overweights... institutional money will add to this and makes this $200+ very soon. Likely will pause in the 200s and be sidways for a while after that."
netflix is a one hit wonder - streaming content. Dis has marketing channels and revenue streams for days.
"If Joe knew anything about the stock market, he would know about the cup with handle chart formation that DIS broke out of. https://www.investors.com/research/disney-stock-comcast-cadence-stocks-lead-software-sector/?src=A00220&yptr=yahoo"
Lol shorts been getting fried
"Buy DIS now, all the tiny negatives are already in. Time to go up."
Here's a fun poll simple ? > So how many sub #'s will we see tonight with earnings + any shorter term future forecast sub #'s? I will go first and say 30 million+ current subs (above expectations - moderately bold optimism).
Chart analyst said if it gets above yesterdays high look for new all time highs next week. Sounds good to me :)

"What's wrong with this stock? It'll move down with the market, but not back up? Dow is up 1.6%, but this stock is only up 0.5%.There's something wrong. I'm thinking of dumping and picking it back up before earnings. It seems as if this baseline just isn't going anywhere until they release earnings/subscription.Is there anyone that can talk me out of that conclusion?"
LOL 105% up eh?
140 tomorrows open!
Disney > Netflix
There always the mute button for shorts unless u prefer to downvote all their posts. Next weeks earnings will definitely shut em up and they will crawl back in their cave as usual. Hopefully the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged and bull market should continue as usual
the global launch of disney is going to be a nightmare for netflix market share.
BAC upgraded WFC to 235 for 205 but the stock go down. Double down my share
All this AND Disney releases the Star Wars teaser. Nobody knows how to put on a show like Disney and that is why this company will dominate streaming like no other! This is easily a $200. Stock!
I bought a bunch today . Bargain shopping
disney is going to have its best quarter in years. parks are packed and disney+ is exploding thanks to Baby Yoda and hit after hit in the box office.
who wants to pay me to sell my shares. I bought back in 2014 and since then this stock hasn5 done a thing. I know as soon as I sell this stock will run ip
Shorts: DIS is gonna go out of business !!!!!Even if it tanks I’ll buy more 
i’m so glad i sold semi stocks and bought Disney. this is a lot more secure then tariff stocks. however this may/will drop some because of it. but doesn’t really have any impact on it. i wouldn’t be surprised if this closes green tomorrow.
we’re about month away from earnings!! i’m expecting a huge beat and very strong guidance with disney plus. so today i’m buying more!
Hercules! Hercules!
It appears an excellent buy in AH trading
"cant wait for the next Mandalorian episodes tomorrow. take advantage of this weeks consolidation. DIS will be 160s by year end, perhaps 200s in 2020. every fund manager will want more of Disney on their clients portfolio on 2020."
Sold the last of my Disney shares. Going to buy puts to $85. Thanks bulls for all the fun. I am now going to bet against mouse. Good luck.
"Um, the China park closing for a few days will ultimately have little effect on Disney profits. Not only that but the upcoming earnings report will be for a quarter which won’t feature today’s and the next few days of China activity at all. In other words, it’s not even a drop in the ocean. After Feb. 4th, Disney will be at least $160 so a $20 profit per share in less than two weeks means it’s absolutely game on and you should buy, buy, buy."
"Reasons why I loaded up premarket today.1) 6 out of the past 8 years DIS has increased from Nov to end of Dec. 2) Lion King 9th highest grossing film ever3) Frozen 2 comes out on Thursday 4) Streaming rolls out Nov. 19, in Australia and New Zealand5) NextGen Marvel timeline coming"
"Billionaire value investor Mario Gabelli said on Thursday's ""Halftime Report"" that investors should be buying shares of Walt Disney, as he believes the stock could climb to $200 per share in two years.The longtime investor is a Disney shareholder and explained that the company has a combination of strong earnings growth, minor capital expenditures, and an attractive multiple that will push the stock higher.this was Nov 8th"

"Needham says still 'too early' to buy Disney, keeps Hold rating after earnings Needham analyst Laura Martin said Disney underperformed her lowered estimates ""by a lot"" in its fiscal third quarter, noting that its revenue was 23% below her estimate and its adjusted EPS was 55% below her forecast. She sees it as ""too early"" to buy Disney shares and remains on the sidelines with a Hold rating until the structural economic impacts of COVID-19 are clearer, Martin tells investors.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3139839"

hahaha love earnings season when all of the blue chips go up on nothing and small caps get wacked on great earnings what a game it is
guys--i need this to close green today. Trust me I need it. things will be good if it does
What a rollercoaster today!!
"Disney = CROWDS. Their movies, parks, cruises, hotel, shopping areas etc. at least 60% or revenue! Fair value $75-$82"
"Federal lawsuit over Disney cooking books,they either spend a fortune to sweep it under rug or become Enron/Lucent 2.0.Don’t become a bag holder like those poor soul investors.Only a profit when you sell.Wait this out until Disney cleans house and gets rid of the executives running this company into the ground,Level 2 at the -$4.00 mark looked shady AF"
Markets are down because unemployment is up again. This is Biden's economy. It will continue to fall. More people unemployed. Democrats are wasting taxpayer money on their own games. This is not our America as we know it.
"They Can Walk away with all Stan Lee Portfolio which is owned by Genius (Gnus) No brainer, they own it, they control it and they profit from it. Genius been awfully quiet last few months as they await the announcement with Marvel.!!!"
"I would say this week will be your last chance to sell your position. Next week and onward is when earnings reports will be flying and we will see the real bear market begin. Just like in 2008. Market plunged 20 percent in a month, recovered over half of the decline in 6 weeks, then the real shock began which saw a bottom of 50+ percent. Listen to experience and be patient. This is definitely a great company, but only for $80 - $90 right now. There are better deals out there instead of buying Disney at $105. If you insist on going long still, then get ready to hold for 3+ years. Good luck!"
"300 by year end, but only if they fire KK"
"Run, Disney, run!!! I don't normally stay in after earnings - my best decision so far this year!"
This will be down 10 points tomorrow
if 197 is the new low that is a good thing. Near term prices mean squat. That is why I am up 100% in just a years time because I didn't sell when there was a small pull back.
Everything is reopening to almost full capacity in Canada. Disney will explode up 
"$300 by year end, strong streaming and parks reopening"
$200 = check
WAY TO CHEAP CONSIDERING CALIFORNIA PARK STILL CLOSED! And legislation to open it SOON!...look for a run to 225 in the next 30 days when legislation passes
Buy $DIS $PG $AMZN $MSFT $PEPBoth very good healthy growing companies that make moneyMoney will flow back from hype in quality
Disney should buy genesis cartoon network out. GNUS ee the stan Lee cartoons it would greatly expand their business
"Had this in my ""old people"" part of my portfolio along with oil stocks and other saturated large caps. Looks like Disney is finding some new life, the streaming services should open them up to a brand new market. Couple that with the insane value of the real estate they own in Orlando and their other parks and we are looking good."

DO NOT BET AGAINST THE MOUSE

People are canceling Disney plus because of Mandalorian debacle

Somebody just bought a ton of shares on the ask in AH...hmmm.
Wow profitable during a pandemic with parks closed. Imagine if all parks were fully opened. Surprised this is not way past $200.
next week earnings gonna be magical good luck to all longs and call holders
When do we get the next update on Disney+ subscribers? I expect it to be off the charts good. Everyone I know has or is signing up for it. I think DIS has another really big move upcoming...
Netflix has content that is watched once. Disney has content that is watched a dozen times.
"Pre market will end at around 143.50. To start, there will be a spike down (dropping the price to 141) then a spike up (rising the price back up to 143) from there the price should slowly and steadily rise to 145 by close"
"For those who are wondering how Disney is going revive ESPN/ESPN+, the answer is eSports. This is what the future generations are interested in, and apparently this is what Disney is focusing on. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-disney-espn-apos-esports-203108178.htmlShares of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) surged over 3.8% following an announcement that it landed a multi-year deal with Disney (DIS) that will see its esports Overwatch League broadcast live on both ESPN and ABC during the July postseason and beyond. Now let's dive into why this deal matters not only for Activision Blizzard but for Disney and the future of live TV as well."
AHHH - the suspense!!!!!!!
"yep yep good stuff >>>>> November 27, 2019 09:25 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- Analyst ColorOn day one, Disney+ registered 10 million subscribers.“I believe the number could’ve been greater if the massive number of hits did not cause a glitch in the website,” Tigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth wrote in a report.The Early Success Of Disney+There’s little reason to doubt Feinseth’s instinct. In its first two weeks, the Disney+ app tallied 15.5 million downloads and $5 million worth of in-app purchases driven by hype around the Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) content library and the launch of ""The Mandalorian."" By some estimates, it’s continued to accrue another 1 million new subscribers daily.“The huge initial numbers continue to show that Disney+ will be a significant competitor to Netflix,” Feinseth wrote.In its 11 years in business, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has accrued 60 million paid U.S. subscribers and 97 million international subscribers.“The strong initial results of Disney+ means it could easily exceed its initial 60-90 million subscribers forecast much earlier than its initial 2024 target,” Feinseth said.Investors see great potential in the young streaming service. Since launching Disney+ on Nov. 12, Disney has risen 9.4% to an all-time high. Netflix appears undaunted. It has spiked more than 7% in the same time.Why It's Important For DisneyFeinseth expects Disney to sustain its run and continues to recommend purchase, partly because the effects of Disney+ are not isolated. The Disney+ craze has boosted sales across the company portfolio. Hulu app downloads have risen 55% and ESPN+ 50%. To Feinseth, the across-the-board surge suggests more consumers are selecting Disney’s $13 bundle package instead of the $7 standalone Disney+ subscription.“Most importantly, I believe the success of Disney+ will also drive merchandise sales, park visits, cruises, increasing other business through its massive halo effect,” Feinseth wrote. “I believe that Baby Yoda, along with other Mandalorian action figures will be in huge demand.”Disney's stock traded around $151.64 at time of publication.Related Links:Disney+ Accounts Reportedly Hacked, Sold On The Dark WebHow Trader Sentiment On Streaming Stocks Has Changed Since Disney+ LaunchPhoto courtesy of Disney.Copyright  2019 Benzinga (BZ Newswire, http://www.benzinga.com/licensing).

No one talking about the low box office results for Raya? Seems to mean that the price is built on a lot of streaming and reopening hype. Unsure how much Raya cost to make and i don’t recall much news or marketing around it.
those selling Netflix today will need to put their money somewhere. Disney is the most logical choice.
Disney Parks will be Disney’s #2 source of income per quarter while Streaming will become #1. Streaming will take this stock over $200 easily.
"Said with bewilderment, why, why, WHY is this down???"
"no matter what happens after ER, this is still a top 5 all time stock and can reach $200 before eoy"
Looks like shorts are working overtime on this message board.
is it safe now?
Official name of Disney streaming service: Disney+. Funny how the rumors were saying it was going to be called DisneyPlay. I like Disney+ better.
Just subscribed for 1 year. Excited to see all this product has to offer. More content will be added as well. It's a new age for streaming.
Operating income of $4.00 billion is a 9.29% increase YoY from $3.66 billion. The Disney earnings report also has net income coming in at $2.13 billion. That's a 23.66% drop compared to its net income of $2.79 billion during the same time last year.
How can anyone invest in this CCP supporting company
"remember disney last earnings the stock was 109,, now we struggle at 100,, this stock with disneys profits and raising prices again should be trading in the 120+ range by earnings"
I’m embarrassed to own this stock.
I like the way it acted considering. I see it bouncing HARD Monday and running into ER
"What happens when South African Variant takes hold? People who were infected with Covid, can get sick, again. We will be chasing this virus for years, with starts and stops in re-openings. Good luck, tomorrow. I hope people don't die because of opening up too soon. Politicians has no creative response to the Covid economy, so dropped money from a helicopter, instead of supporting the people, like Disney employees who are, truly, out of work."
disney should sky rocket today on the cancel disney news
DIS a tech company now. Undervalued compared to NFLX and AMZN.
I agree with everyone’s that Disney ‘s future is bright. In the short term the charts show a drop. The daily charts show a head and shoulder with a possibility of hitting 144 by Friday. The weekly charts show Disney stock hitting 139.50. That is the 50 day moving average that is rising with the 200 day moving average at 133.80. I would save some bullets to buy under $140.
"Just got an email from Hulu that they are increasing the price for Hulu Live TV from $44.99/month to $54.99/month starting December 18, 2019. That's quite the jump in price (22%) and makes me consider canceling and moving over to AT&T Now for only $50/month which includes HBO. Only downside is that I don't get the local channels with AT&T Now (unless that has changed in the last 6 months). Regardless, I'd still keep the DIS+ bundle for $12.99."
"Hey long-term DIS investors, please remember that (1) Disney+ has only been rolled out in four countries as of now and (2) Disney has stated that it will not be profitable until 2024 due to its low initial pricing. So, you all need to grow a beard and learn how to be patient."
I hope DIS ups the bid for Sky to run the price up on CMCSA like they ran the price for Fox up.
That hedge fund that bought $3.8M calls at full price are using their powder to hold this down  this is a huge WIN for longs.... when the powder is gone they will drive us higher
"$DIS could easily buy out AMC, and get a lot more eyeballs."
"I still don't see any actual numbers from Disney. Something must be very wrong. I'm betting the numbers are disappointing and far lower than expected. Disney doesn't benefit by releasing them, so they're stalling in hopes more viewers will boost the data."

The call not going well
Bought in at $95 but only 10 shares. What a mistake should have boughten 100.
Surprising how strong this one is today. Would have thought it would tank considering that it’s unlikely for the theme parks to open this summer.
Watch for the $193.85 break out
Is this thing done tanking ? Like can we move up now? For the love offfff disney
Here we go again. Market making new highs and Disney stuck under it's high made 3 years ago.
Mickey is Riding the Dragon 9 to the moon
About time peeps recognize
Covid numbers going down. Just think of all the ones that already caught the virus and the ones that were vaccinated already. This economy is getting ready to rumble and will be great for Disney!
i bouth quite a few shares over many trades in the last week. I did sell half AH. My core position through is always in tact and isnt going nowhere. Im expecting a better dividend payment for Q3
disney gets an upgrade. goes up $6+ in one day. disney gets downgraded with a price target higher then the current stock price. Goes down less then 1% SMH! Imperial just wanted attention. $200+ next year.
"Earnings per share, -2.74 , nice, oh . . . . wait, that's a loss"
Looks like it could bounce off of $189-190 support. I’ll be looking to go long when it does.
Just break 200 already
"I'm no genius, marketing or otherwise, but wouldn't it have made sense to release this on May 4th, and capitalize on that day as being a Star Wars fanatics holy day? If I had a nickel for every ""May the fourth be with you!"" social media headline I see on that day then I could fund the next Star Wars movie..."
4x volume and up 6% and it’s only launched in the USA/Canada. Asia and Europe are bigger markets by far according to Disney financials. This will hit 50M next year.
I’m buying Disney gift cards for Christmas  stocking stuffers
Really Disney! Everything is going up and you are going down an down!! This is unbelievable!
"With Hulu being 1.99/month, are we going for another 30 million subs? No matter how you slice it.....Disney win and the stock is going up, there a burn roof."
did you honestly watch today's action and decide to sell now?
Anyone not holding for earnings either didn't study economics or doesn't want to learn.
Love the dis day today. Can’t wait for next week more upgrades coming. :)
solo has failed domestically and internationally. Something needs to be done otherwise episode 9 will fail too.
"No worries, all expected. This is a buy tomorrow. CAn't judge a stock on one earnings report. If you do you're missing the point. All my fellow longs are resting easy as they know this company is a powerhouse!"
"I made my $400 for today and that’s enough too much volatility everyone is trying to make a dollar, soon as earnings come in, people will dump it back to 170$"
it's gonna be a good Monday
You go Disney! 
"You member the days when DIS used to tank super fast when there was bad news for the market (i.e. trade wars scare) but then take for...ev...er to get back up? Now it's the opposite! Bad day for the market means a slow trickle down for DIS, but as soon as the news has passed DIS is back up in no time!"
"Coronavirus not making sense. Disney getting slammed for it individually despite a great quarter, yet the broader market is at all time highs like corona never happened. Seems unfair to Disney stock but this has huge international potential with dis+"
this stock will plummet. I am a charting expert and it doesn't look good
"Another feather in Marvel's cap is the success of ""Spider-Man: Far From Home."" The film is a collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony, part of a deal struck between Sony's Amy Pascal and Marvel's Kevin Feige in 2015.Sony would finance and distribute the film, but Marvel would produce the film, overseeing the story, picking the director and tying it in to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. While Disney doesn't receive any box-office money from the film, it does still own the merchandising rights to the character — toys, clothing tie-ins and other merchandise all go into Disney's pocket.On Sunday, Sony reported that ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" had earned $847 million globally. This is just under the $880.2 million ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" made during its entire run in 2017. Expectations are that ""Far From Home"" will surpass $1 billion before leaving theaters this summer."

"Congrats longs, another reason to celebrate."
Someone dumped. ...Dis will not.reopen in CA.. april 1st.
"HEy where is the ""i shorted 500 at the close"" guy? Let me guess he shorted at the high and then closed out the position profitable at the low exactly to the penny. Right?"
Let’s take out the all time high. Disney+ is tremendous. Better than I had hoped.
Disney ate Netflix lunch and that's why Netflix subscription was way down. DIS will report a VERY GOOD Q2 earnings with all those record blockbusters movies in Q2!
"Australia tomorrow, Europe next, Christmas will be the icing on the cake"
"Seems like a big mistake on call where they mentioned Disney+ will just have ""family friendly"" content. And even their FX network, will produce just for Hulu, because it is too mature for Disney+."
"Disney made a brilliant move buying Star Wars . It seemed like a lot of money at the time, but they’ve done a superb job promoting it and moving it forward . I’m sure 20th Fox will payoff big with the streaming service . Disney is just killing it . I can’t believe this stock isn’t moving by leaps and bounds .."
Apple content won’t hold a candle to Disney’s. Lol
DIS analyst on CNBC says its heading to $175- $200...NFLX trades at 130 pe..DIS is cheap imo.
"This Q's earning results are going to be mostly about guidance going into Disney+. EPS and Rev matter, of course, but folks are looking for the good guidance which will dictate how they position going forward. Stay tuned."
I'll buy more when it reaches $105/share again.
Does DIS just buy NFLX now?
I heard they are giving out free lifetime subscription today if you buy 200 shares. Well ill be using my profits to fund free disney+ for life
"Disney stock goes to show how manipulated the stock market is. It is a rigged game and individual investors are just pawns. Bad news is good news. Good news is bad news. The market makers are not fools. They are here to steal your money. In reality, not the fake reality we call the stock market, the virus has just started in America. We have another 6-8 weeks of dealing with it. Disney’s revenue (other than disney+) is getting absolutely pummeled. The bottom line is be careful buying here. Good luck to all."
"Wonder what d, d2, trader gained from all the spamming? :) not any money."
I'm buying NOW! $120 after the CC.
"Don’t get too cocky. Longs need to keep finding buyers who are willing to pay higher multiples like Netflix stockholders. Momentum investors and growth investors. Disney has some great catalyst coming. Star Wars at Disneyland and Walt Disney World, new hotels, new movies, Frozen 2, Starwars, and Disney plus. It is a great stock and is getting its due, but it’s investor base is not the same as Netflix. Maybe it will transition some, but it won’t 100%."
I look forward to visiting Disneyland with all my gains.
"Disney is a Worthless Libtard Company now. Sold 5,000 shares I’ve held for years today and ZERO interest in buying back. Woke Company? I have Cancelled you."
"Earnings per share: $1.53 per share vs. $1.44 per share expected, Revenue: $20.86 billion vs. $20.79 billion expected10 million subscribers increase from November 2019 last quarterGuidance of 90 Million subscribers by 2024 at $5.5 a month subscription."
Bought at 112$ in june. And planning to hold this for years.
Here we go boys and girls!
Today was painful for call holders. Hoping for a green tomorrow.
"You know you are in a good position when you see green and are like.. ""oh man, I wanted red so I could buy more shares""... WIN WIN"
"@WheelinDealin I hear you, I’ve owned this stock for nearly three years and I’m actually down money on it. It’s atrocious, I think pure stubbornness of refusing to sell at a loss is keeping me holding onto this stock. It lacks innovation"
"This should be 80 not 105, Disney will announce longer park closure after hours soon, by guess is tomorrow so people can think on it all weekend and not trade the news."
There is a lot of things that are all good in Disney and their future. Things are just in a temporary lull in the stock price. The fox deal uncertainty is keeping the stock down at the moment. Disney earnings will continue to be good quarter after quarter. The upcoming films in the next few quarters will earn billions and billions plus the parks upcoming Star Wars land will be a huge boost to earnings in 2019. Might help if Disney would do two things. Do a 4/1 stock split. Plus a small dividend increase. The split would be more a psychology move in the sense it encourages more small investors to start buying the stock because of the lower price per share.
"Just saw Norwegian Cruise lines cancelled trips through September. Dang, not good for Disney cruise trips. I'm hoping this drops down to at least 105 again so I can buy more long term. What are others buy zones? I'm thinking this could hit high 90s. NBA, baseball up in the air... not good for ESPN either."
"My dad is very high up in Disney, he expects 140 by the end of next week."
"Disney, doesn't need to stream. They are fine with their franchises, products, theme parks, content formula. But now, they will have access to a monthly subscription from hundreds of millions of people, potentially around the world. China, well they'll be much more accepting of Mickey, vs Love Death and Robots from Netflix with the f word in every other sentence, (which i entirely love). So you tell me who will be king as pwr market cap, Disney or Netflix?. Netflix has only ONE, and ONLY ONE source or stream of income, that is its subscribers. They are I believe 26 billion in debt?, I saw on cnn?. They rake in massive amounts of money per month, still one source of income, makes this now media company, a little more prone to negative market conditions, Disney, doesn't have to worry about that. Disney is the epitomy of diversification. Netflix, is sadly has all it's eggs in one basket. You do the math."
"The only thing I can attribute this fall is to the announcement that 50% of Fox Shareholders are taking cash, about 30-35% are taking stock, with the rest undecided.I think the market was hoping for more options on stock, because they wanted to minimize the amount of cash being borrowed.I'm not so worried - First, Disney is getting the Sky money - about $16 billion. Add in the local sports networks, that is at least $15 billion, and I think $20+ is very possible. And then add in the other assets Disney is selling. And remember, that Disney has been stockpiling some money of late because it hasn't been doing stock buybacks (at least they haven't been telling us they haven't - the cynic in me says that Disney is buying at least a few shares in the past month. But I'm not really worried. Disney, in effect, is doing a stock buyback when they pay cash instead of stock for the Fox purchase. When Disney is over 130 by the end of the year, all will be saying that Disney got a 15% discount."
"like I said...wait for conference call. ""anonymous """
"When Euros sell our stocks, we BUY! $180 inbound by close."
let this thing pop up. I see a few buck increase with the streaming service in November
Buy and hold. No options.
Where's all my special people saying this is heading back to 100?
"$1,000,000,000 Monday morning..."
too late to buy?
Thankful we only have a few more days before earnings you can sure learn a lot about people in this room lol  on the 5th everyone will be changing names to protect their fragile egos lol  if you did homework you would be playing golf twice a week or enjoying this time nothing has been lost unless you bought on margin or sell  19 analyst three of which have upgraded to $170 in last two weeks and that leaves 16 more upgrades after earnings  on February 7th I’ll be staring down $155-$170 per share and never looking back 
Bout some today
I see $300 in a year or less.
This is shocking!
Omg i think whenever game stock does. The whole market does the opposite. Why is that? People need money to cover?
When are we going to see $200? I thought it would happen after earnings ....?
Disney+ to be available starting November 12 for $6.99 a month? Count me in. Count every family in. Globally!
"DIS ended strong, lets hope it carries into tomorrow, any predictions? I have calls that i want to get out of"
Just buy DIS because I think it is no brainer stock. My dad told me to buy the good stock when it is in red.
"OK folks let's play ""Where Do We Open 12/14""? Enter your prognostication for where DIS opens tomorrow with a pre-market deal announcment for FOX."
Pretty sure this stock should be trading between 100 and 120.
People getting ready for next catalyst to be released ... go Disney!!
"Losing streak reaches 5 days. Down 17.94 (12.7%)Tied for the longest since July 30-Aug. 5. that was a drop of 8.09 (5.53%)First time since at least May of 2008, that it drops at least 3.5% THREE days in a row.Worst close since 116.599998 on April 11 of last yearNow down 30.05 (19.59%) since the all-time high of 153.41 on Nov. 26, 2019"
"Disney is firing on all cylinders. they are exceeding at all of the categories and markets they produce in. this should easily be $200 a share by the end of 2020, if not sooner. Ill be adding more soon. and not selling till i make 50%. i’m up 6%."
"If this upward trend for Disney stock continues, I can't help but wonder if the company will consider resuming its historical pattern of stock splits."
So with Disney do you take the profits and run or stay put. Disney just seems to not be going anywhere (except today).
I like Disney but just way overvalued right now.
"If the pre-market is anything to go by, it looks like The Mouse will quite easily get past the $150 mark today."
Why the drop ? This stock market always goes opposite
If we go off the past shouldn't we expect dividends next Friday the 6th or Monday the ninth?
"You have items that cost 30 cents to make in china, that are sold for 12.50 at the dis store, yet this is suddenly not profitable . . . because they have enflamed the ire of their true former customers. It will only start making sense again after they fire KK."
someone wake me up when this nightmare is over. I have no choice but to take my calls through earnings now for a chance to see green
"Star Wars + Tax reform + FOX assets = DIS $150, mid 2018.Get in NOW!"
"Well, the short story is COVD is great for the economy. I mean just about every blue chipper has reported stellar earnings. Someone get with China and have them come up with something new. Or, just intensify what we have."
"Makes no sense! DIS beats earnings and goes up less after hours, than it lost for the day."
"I love Disney stock, but truly hate that they cater to the CCP. America First always "
"Dis CEO totally misrepresented what Gina said- imo no truth, no honor just lame b/s from Dis CEO. As soon as my year is up Dis + gone- Epic and HBO max much better for adults. GLT"
Disney is the beauty and the beast right now. its totally a diamond in the rough. 5 years a sleeping beauty but now she stirs.
i got in at $135.40 before last earnings. very happy with my decision and looking forward to adding more on dips and holding strong for 5 years. Disney+ will sky rocket the stock over $200 easily.
"I've just over $1,350,000 saved from my pension and been waiting to invest in a well managed company. I'm not getting any younger and always like Disney. Really want to buy at least ten thousand shares. My account said Disney will double. What time does the stock market open?"
"Short-term pain but LONG term gain ! This will come back and come back BIG as pent up demand for Disney Parks and just ""get aways"" will come."
wow look at the fake accounts trying to make disney look bad. Disney is amd always will be a rock solid stock. Thisnisnan excellent opportunity to buy Disney... Frozen 2 coming out and Disney collaboration with target stores taking effect. Disney+ will do amazing I already pre ordered it. Disney will be $140 before you know it
"The drop in price is frustrating because, I understand, that the number of shares to be issued to Fox shareholders is based upon the price of disney, with a collar at 114 or so. At this point, more shares of Disney are being issued. Perhaps we can see it break 110 again.But, if it closes in the next 6 weeks, that will be nice. I bet you see Disney Plus come out soon thereafter. And I had an interesting conversation with a young couple with a child. They are anxious for Disney Plus to open - there are several movies in the ""vault"", which they assume will be available to Disney Plus subscribers. I hope that they are not the only one.But I have another thought. Disney has three live action animated movies this year Dumbo in March, Aladdin in May, and Lion King in July. Three in about four months. They've not really done more than one a year in the past. I think that they are trying to load up on these movies to give a push to Disney Plus. they may not even put these into dvd's. Just my thoughts.I'm hoping that Disney Plus is going to push Netflix very hard."
Way over valued but cant complain.
Park revenue will show improvement. Its not just streaming
Give me a 174.02 close so I can start my position in GREEN!
"""Black Panther,"" Marvel's first film directed by an African-American, brought in an estimated $192 million for its three-day debut in North America this weekend. That's the fifth biggest opening of all time.Disney estimates that the film will bring in $218 million domestically for the four day holiday weekend. The film brought in an opening of $361 million around the world."
New catalyst for Disney this coming weekLaunch in Australia Frozen 2New streaming numbersPlus more upgrades and new deals to be announced 
"you guys know this is 100% short-term profit-taking by day traders, right? remember that day traders make a living on the stocks that they rotate in/out of their volatile range positions after run-ups/downs. they watch most actives on a daily basis while always looking to get in/out thus affecting volatility short-term. a joe can be long a core position but also look to trade, and especially if he is retired with absolutely nothing else to do with his monthly checks."
So let's see...Disney opens the week at $140.41...suffers through a turbulent week in the markets...has a terrible earnings report...and finishes the week at $138.52?!?!? After THAT week it's down only $1.89?? That's the sign of a great company.
"A few more sessions, it is about to buy DIS at a good bargain price. I really like the weather like this, when good stock goes down with out good reason, just it goes up too high too fast. DIS deserves every point it gains since last week."
"I dunno man. I really think with Disney plus this is a $200 stock. Just the speculation of it is worth the inflated price.Anybody else surprised by bad earnings or is it just understood that analysts marked expected outrageously high earnings just so the stock would fall Also, do bad earnings really matter at this point? Disney is a cash machine and pretty much does whatever it wants at a high level"
What did this Gina actually do?
"So, are we seeing $140 today before the bell rings?"
"Hey Netflix here's an idea, make an original movie, release at the theatre and make 350 million worldwide and have a nice movie to eventually ad to your streaming service , oh Yeah Disney already did that this weekend with Frozen 2."
Disney expected to beat street by 79 cents a share. Barrons
The fact that everything is going to be downloadable is a huge plus (pun intended) for me! Being able to watch Disney movies without internet is going to really make business or vacation flights more enjoyable. I hate having to pay for airline wifi.
I’m having a hard time understanding why this stock is under $300 PPS?!?
Yahoo ... are you protecting Disney? Shielding them from comments about how wrong they are for censoring and firing GC?
European markets 10%upBuy cheap last chance
The Mouse that roared. On to $200!
"No panic, rotational market dump"
My girl Disney taking off a week after I sell as per usual
Dis stock at $112.80. If anyone is aware of the reason why the stock is down $2.16 this morning please share.
"Hey BIG D - I thought it was going to drop .75 at the open and that you would start making $$$ today? Now thanks to you I cant pay my mortgage, I sold my car to get money to short disney and my wife is leaving me! We're broke thanks to you!!! what do I do?"
I bought twice today. Will do the same tomorrow and next day if needed.
It's painful seeing how flat this has been since 2015 and thinking about the money I've missed out on my keeping my investment in Disney. I'm in for the long haul but man have we all left a lot of money on the table these last 3 years.
Fair value is 136.41
very nice day.... nice for a change!!!
"Hey Apple, thanks for giving us a sale! If you think Apple content is going to be able to compete with Disney, I've got an invisible yacht to sell you!"
That was a nice Disney + commercial at the end of the 3 quarter on Sunday Night Football.
Everyone cancelled Netflix because they are just waiting for Disney! haha.. so not true.. but great thoughts!
So Disney owns 60% HULU.. and HULU bought 10% of HULU from ATT... I think thats where were at right?
"How quickly people forget all the good news around Disney. For example, Oct 4th Disney will open store within store at select Target stores, with more to come."
nice bump that caught the day traders off guard - all aboard!
They seem to be gaining subscribers from Netflix... Clearly a huge win given the growth for first quarter.
"TV channels , Movies , Theme Parks and Disney+ equals analysts upgrading stock and raising price target. This time next year DIS will be at a minimum of $200"
Don't buy the pop today in Disney. Wait
"OMG! It's at a 0.75% loss, what should I do Yahoo board? I must sell. >Shorts: ""I win""."
"Theme parks reopening in California is GREAT news for Disney next week. Also, Raya is expected to be #1 at the box office raking in $12 million, the best weekend since before the pandemic!! Disney $200 HERE WE COME!!"
Fellow Mouseketeers. Getting into the elevator at work this morning this guy tells me he has been on hold for over two hours trying to order Disney+. If that isn’t anecdotal evidence of what’s going on with their streaming nothing is.
OptionsTrader having a full blown conversation with himself on this board lol
"As of today, Disney + is still #1 app on iOS & Google Play Stores. We are almost 4 weeks post launch."
"All bets are in. Good luck tomorrow everyone. Whatever the destination, I'm with you on the journey. Let's make some money! "
"although this is amazing with Disney+ and I'm hearing great things about mandalorian and such, I'm just hoping there isn't a ton of drop off because people are done watching shows and movies over again and then figuring out they don't need it anymore. regardless, let's see what this baby can do"
When does Disney report earnings ?
dont let the shorts win
"Bought this stock before Force Awaken was released, 3 years later I've only able to collect dividends. WoooHooo!!"
I'm feeling a bit of de javu from the time Dis sold SKY to Comcast. Good times! 
I hoped everyone enjoyed the Cyber Monday discount today. Back to business tomorrow.
"The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Executive Chairman, Robert Iger A, Filled Form 4, on 03/10/2021, Disposed 120,946 shares, at Price $200.82 worth $24,288,513.Follow On Instagram, money_insider_stocknewsFacebook Earnegy InvestmentsFor Stocks Inside News and Details."
The cliffhanger ending of first Mandalorian episode is just brilliant writing.
"Disney is suffering a backlash after firing Gina Carano. #canceldisneyplus is trending. Stock is down considerably immediately after favorable financials. Meanwhile, Carano's social media posts about her future endeavors literally are nearing a million likes/comments. I personally canceled my subscription, and sold my shares. I'll never take my family to a Disney park again. Why? Tired of the hypocrisy and politics. Countless Disney stars can post very similar posts to Gina's and Disney doesn't bat-an-eye. A Conservative does it and they are bullied and canceled. So: #canceldisneyplus #selldisney"
DISNEYLAND REOPENS APRIL 1st.... STOCK JUST POPPED 4 BUCKS!!! WOOOOOHOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
How many Disney holders are subscribing to Disney+? I feel like Disney investors spend on Disney the most lol
Good job for those of you who bought when this was down today. Solid move.
"We're having some trouble pulling away. g89We had a nice bump the other day. But can't seem to follow up nicely. Why?1. Dumbo is having a little trouble getting nice reviews. But I've seen one or two nice ones. But this is a small project in the scheme of things.2. Investor's day is coming up. But Apple's was a dud. Too little on content, and too much on those presenting. It's up to Iger to do something great to shape things up.3. Just a little leveling off.But there is some good news. Avengers may really really break records. $2 billion is almost a sure thing. I'm betting that the first weekend might, world wide, really approach $1 billion ($850 million is really a more realistic goal). And Captain Marvel keeps plugging away.But the pressure is really on Investor's day. They have to show some real new content for the streaming services. Have a date for the introduction. And a price. And show that ESPN+ has an increase in subscribers again. Maybe an announcement on more Local Sports Cable networks, or other aspects of the Fox purchase. Or maybe an announcement on buying ATT's 10% interest in Hulu."
Everytime I look at the numbers this seems like the best buy out there yet it goes nowhere while overvalued teh stocks continue to climb and be the stocks to buy on dips. Does Valuation matter anymore?
"I'm a newbie to investing (outside my retirement plans) so I could be totally wrong...But it seems to me that Disney is a too complicated stock to comprehend for an average investor like myself. Too many moving parts/variables like the theme parks, licensing, toys, Disney movies, Fox, ESPN, HULU, Pixar, and now a streaming service. It's not an easy to understand company with only a few core products/services, like Adobe or AMD."
"Excellent jobs report means more people are employed and that means more money is available to spend and where do people spend their money? Vacations, XMAS, Movies all of which Disney participates in."
Netflix increased subscribers by 8 million for the last quarter of last year smashing expectations of an increase of around 6 million. Stock price is now looking to open up 12% higher tomorrow in the USA on the back of the news.This bodes well for Disney who should also see an increase in subscriber numbers if this is a trend across the whole industry.
"Huge news, Disney taking full operations of Hulu and has option for Comcast’s interest and can use Comcast content"
"Hi I'm a high school student and I'm looking for a financial expert for a project to advise me on hypothetically buying, selling, or holding stock in the Walt Disney Company and why? I will also need to cite your name and firm. Thanks!"
can we all agree $150 tomorrow?
It’s coming down right before earnings. Good sign it’s going to take off after close .. seen this a thousand times
wwwwwhat ! wow :)
Let’s do this 102.00 I’m putting up $100.00 that it closes 102 today
well with 50 million viewers playing 7.99 a month this could be 400 million rev per month... sooo.... 12 months... 5 billion a year?!?
Will it hit $120 this week? That's the $1 Million question!!
$DIS just blew past subscriber growth. $CURI is next!! $NFLX here we come!!
Mickey makin it rain......
"Once their semi-annual dividend is back, this stock will go even higher"
"sold some at 195, whould it go higher???"
"Its $10 above what it was 3 years ago, it is not over bought, it was a bargain and now is breaking out. Think about it, after Lion King they will have 50% of the domestic film revenue of of 8 movies"
Am im the only one regretted got into Disney from April? $137 avg cost tho
A dip before earnings is good. Gives us room to run up after ER.
"Good numbers for DIS, where is my dividend?"
There is absolutely nothing to watch in Disney+ and ESPN+. ESPN+ is not ESPN.
"Took several kids to see Aladdin last night. I thought it was alright, but everyone else seemed to LOVE it. It got a standing ovation at the end and all the kids said they thought it was great. I have only seen a few movies where people actually clap like they did for this one... ha. Disney knows what they are doing... :)"
"RSI is at 34.5 oversold, very close to bottom band. Longs wouldn't know prime time to BUY on the low if Mickey smacked them in the face!"
so 700mill revenue instantly added to Disney?? after launch of disney+ 
guys i told u buy tgt ....massive earning beat ...i jumped from disney at 150 ..n bought tgt at 108 ...now tgt is 11 usd up
we're going up up up today boys and girls.....
I find it so odd that they keep boosting companies like TSLA and SHOP with P/E 1200 and 900 yet DIS with P/E of 100.. Although Overvalued will get bashed down on good and improving earnings. It makes no sense to me.
I really regret not loading up on the low today...
lets dance!
Never underestimate Disney. Always reinventing themselves to meet the current times. I think we have yet to see what Disney is truly made of. Undervalued is an understatement.
Every kid has to watch Disney
Wow
can’t complain with $5 today. ill take it. i’m pretty sure we will net another $10 per share next week.
"I agree it makes zero sense for this to be above $100 now. BUT people like DIS and willing to take the risk, I guess. Its a BIG risk!"
where we headed guys...96?
blast off
https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/disney-movies-will-still-come-to-netflix-after-disney-launch/
110 tomorrow?
As the integration of 21st Century Fox continues DIS is a money machine
Airlines are seriously outperforming today. Good indicator that everything is. You can’t go wrong here but where to get in?
just my thoughts: i think we will settle around $145 till earnings approaches and hit $160 after earnings. $175 will hit when Disney Plus launches then $200 after 2020 first earnings reports.
"While I think DIS will end up with FOX and even expect DOJ approval by next week, I caution everyone to get to excited and think this is a done deal. I mentioned last week and there was a report out today that CMCSA was exploring raising additional cash from a PE firm Ir strategic investor (i.e someone like AMZN). While CMCSA would love to have FOX movie studios for the content library, if they could get 100% ownership of SKY and say their partner AMZN takes the rest this scenario is still a huge win for CMCSA. Why is that? Because it’s main competitor/enemy DIS ends up with nothing"
"looks to me that this stock market is finished for many years, stocks cant go up and hold anymore,,seems many are sellers on any up day,,,,wish i was not long,,hope to see Disney past 110 to 115,,but no upside at all,,they hit the bid at 100 evertime"
"This virus deal could be the big “correction” we’ve been expecting . Whole month of February could be rough for the stock market, but big buying opportunities will come if that’s the case . I’m seeing DIS as a great long term deal, not a get rich quick ."
"Weekend box office results are being presented as though it is a ""glass half empty"" and not half full. Maybe the box office returns were slightly lower than anticipated because so many people have signed up for Disney+ that it makes no sense for them to go to the theater and pay those excessive rates to see a movie that will be streaming on Disney+ in a few months. More thought needs to be used in regards to what is really going on."
"Disney will break it's all time record of $132.70, if not if, just when. They are 27 Wall Street Firms have an Buy rating. These institutions will be putting more money into Disney stock. Being conservative by next 4/26/19 we will have surpassed that"
160 170 stock by summer.. until everything opens up
"good night guys, hoping for a bounce a tomorrow. sigh"
JP Morgan ups Disney target to $150 tonight after hours!
Anyone have any predictions for the month of march? I dont want anyone ones “wishful” answers though. I want real predictions pls.
"Question for all you guys since I view Disney owners as longs I’m new to stock investing and I would like everyone’s opinion on what stocks are great 10 to 15 yr stocks to own or buy now? I own some Disney, little Microsoft and Cisco and a small amount of three different cannibis stocks for a dark horse. Just a 39 yr old guy trying to build up a little cash to help put three kids thru college! Thanks in advance!"
This will drop back to two digits again guys.Everyone around me is shorting the market...
I just bought yearly subscription.
"Analyst upgrade with a $150 PT and 35% upside, and the share price falls???"
Just hold. No time for action. We simply should wait and enjoy “The rise of Skywalker”

"What I don’t understand about this stock is. Why does everyone who wants to sell this stock post on here that they are gonna sell this stock. Just do it, we don’t care. Have a nice day!"
Still undervalued... market and stock only go up up up. Bull market where DIS goes higher and higher!
$DIS | Disney Q121 Earnings: Revenue: $16.25B (est $15.91B)Adj EPS: $0.32 (est Loss/Share: $0.38)Disney+ Subscribers: 94.9M (est 90.7M)Hulu Subscribers: 39.4M (est 38.4M)ESPN+ Subscribers: 12.1M (est 11.5M)

"Disney Does It Again At Box Office, Bullish Option Flow: Disney does it again with the #1 movie at the box office for the second week in a row. Disney’s animated adventure “Raya and the Last Dragon” remained King at the domestic box office,…"
What is today's problem?
"It’s interesting to see all these frustrating posts... It’s hard to imagine a company growing faster, making more Blockbuster movies and watching the noise... There is a bunch of things going on right now.... investment firms live fast growing companies but we only have seen two indicators thus far 10m first day and 1M per day for first two weeks. We (investors) can’t realize the profitability of this new service yet... It’s going to take a little longer for this data to be absorbed and to be analyzed... I won’t say be patient, be diligent and evaluate the product yourself and the data being released and measure against Netflix. Both are different and operate differently. Disney has been in business for over 50 years, makes money and has the ability to grow the business and brand through its extensive library. We have relationships with China and can expand service into China, Netflix never will have this audience. Disney is family entertainment and streaming is growing yoy. Buy hold, add and relax no rush just know what you bought."
id rather wait for earnings knowing that it will spike $30+ than worry about an artificial pump now like netflix or other companies. at least if there is a bad news in the market DIS will not drop 10%-15%. stay rational and wait for the earnings next month. when we will strive next month a lot of people will look at dis and regret not buying at this range. i also got call options for feb 20th $165.
well it will tank tomorrow just like every single one reporting positive earnings
"Fox and their content is one thing, but the reason I popped on $dis after years of scoffing at the idea of it: they are going to pull all their titles from other streaming services? You got me Disney—content is capital and between animation, marvel, and Star Wars—well that’s a lot of capital."
"If we are using pre market as a crystal ball, then DIS is already recovering! it was a lot lower and now it's coming up already!"
If Frozen 2 has great songs along with a great story it will smash box office records worldwide
Apple should just get some loans and add it to its cash in hand and buy Disney. Case closed
"Doug Ramsey, the chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group, warned clients that the day is coming when the dire state of the economy catches up with equity investors. “The stock market punishment doesn’t fit the economic crime,” he said. “We expect it eventually will.”https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-much-more-severe-selloff-looms-in-the-stock-market-strategist-warns-2020-05-10?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"Walter Elias ""Walt"" Disney, what happened to your Disney? Day after day, the share price is going down despite good news!"
Why moving so low today?
"was just watching yahoo news live. and they keep saying that disney is in the best position going forward for streaming TV. they were also talking about CBS and Viacom merge and saying one of them could buy Sony. Imagine if Disney started buying movie studios like Sony, Lionsgate Films, etc. If Netflix was smart they would be merging with media companies instead if losing billions in context. which is why they keep losing US subscribers. Disney will be better than Netflix in just 1 year."
Will Disney split soon?
Looks like investors are happy with the new leadership. Good luck everyone! https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3395818-disney-formalizes-leadership-change-media-business-fox-deal?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#aoh=15390471617237&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Fnews%2F3395818-disney-formalizes-leadership-change-media-business-fox-deal
What's happening? An inside candle
I think im going to add at the close
ROLL CALL to all my option players. How did you guys make out today? Hope you made money with BIG JOE. Waiting for this to bottom out then will grab CALLS again.
"as great as Disney + will be , the park expansions this summer will be even better for the bottom line. Disney makes most of its money from parks and resorts."
I hope I'm wrong because I want the market as a whole to go up... but i think $70 is the magic number to go in on. much will be learned this coming week
how about a dividend
"Congrats longs. The mouse has never disappointed long and loyal investors. It’s been a great ride since March 2020, and an even better ride from the decades leading up to now."
"It would not surprise me if Disney soon announced plans to construct a new mega theme park in Texas The new park could have the latest features and using a more economical foot print than the park in California. Once the new park opens, Disney could transition all operations from California to Texas. The land sale from the California site would cover a lot of the costs for the new theme park. It is coming."
"This is a very critical week and weekend for Disney/Marvel.Captain Marvel is coming out. Disney hasn't had a runaway hit since Avengers last May. Yes, it had Antman and Ralph and Mary Poppins, but none really owned up to expectations or were true blockbusters.Captain Marvel is the run up to Avengers End Game in April. It is the first stand alone for a female Marvel hero. Marvel needs to bring in more female customers for its Marvel movies.Disney has put a lot of advertising into it. Disney has not lost its ""mojo"", but after Black Panther and Avengers last year, Disney needs to prove itself again.Estimates are $100 million, give or take 20, according to one article I saw. Another said $125 million. Only Iron Man and Black Panther had over $100 million openings for the introduction of a Marvel character. But with the promotions I've seen, I think Disney is betting a lot. I am really hoping for over $150 million.I heard one commentator, earlier this year, say that Captain Marvel was a $2 billion gross movie. That is unrealistic. Maybe $1 billion. And the China box office seems to be pointing towards a nice opening.Disney needs this. And they are putting a lot into it to get it"
Apple has been considering buying Disney for years. The time may be right. Got a feeling this is coming. Lots of discussion in the Apple world about this.
"Disney stock is going to drop when market open on tomorrow. you should sell your disney stock before it's going down to 130$. I know Disney+ can make big money, but we are in trade war with china. And Disney+ is not release yet, so disney stock can't go 140$-170$."
They are hiring storm troopers. Maybe I can get a job and get some inside information for us!
Sold! for $129. Good luck to y'all. Hope you all do well and make some good money. I might buy back in at if it drops enough.
Sold Apple bought Disney last night now enjoy the Disney Earnings this will pop over $8

"Disney is a stream play, your invested money is streaming out the door."
strong like a rock . long term play for me
"I just read that after the Verizon customers get a free year of Disney+, the subscription will renew and be charged on their Verizon bill. People may not even notice the small charge as compared to the large cellular part of the bill and this alone should likely help retain subscribers."
No point for this to be getting sold
"Disney is a great company. 70% of revenue will be back in 6 months. Long-term hits are cruises, movies and theme parks where volume will be down significantly for at least 1-2 years. $100 is not cheap given relative valuations. At $75-$80 I would buy shares here."
"Sell Netflix and buy Disney:Netflix has a PE of 233 whereas Disney has a PE of 18.3. Netflix is spending aggressively $8 billion in 2018 to feverishly come up with its own content. Will it be good? Will it be bad? While Disney has all of the proven content, franchises, and library of classics to feed their new streaming service. Let alone a lock on sports to feed the new ESPN streaming service.Putting together the mechanics behind their new streaming service is binary and will be flawlessly executed. But Netflix content??? Not binary and could be a failure.Disney deserves at least a multiple that is 5x where we are at today. $500 stock price!?!This is the Disney future.Buy all that you can."
"I think there is a lot of confusion here around shorts vs. put. Most people saying the stock will go lower are playing with volatility, not the long term outlook of Disney."
"Confirmed: Disney is officially buying 10% more in Hulu from Time Warner. We all knew it was coming, but now it's official."
"mkts will test lows between now and early may as bad infection news keep on coming,"
i agree cancel disney. they always wabt to play the everyones after me card. the next time you stiff a waitor or talk down to someone remember that person is equal to you.
Big price spike is happening tomorrow!
"A real question...i am surprised and a little dismayed by the lack of mention of a split. Does anyone know that in the past, did DIS announce splits during earning calls or just randomly in the quarter?"
"New just in from guy in the pitAbout 14.5% of Netflix(NFLX) subscribers say they are considering dropping the service in favor of Disney's(DIS)$6.99-a-month offeringAbout 14% of Netflix Inc.(NFLX) subscribers, equal to 8.7 million people, are considering dropping the streaming service in favor of the coming $6.99-a-month offering from Disney Co., at a cost to Netflix(NFLX) of about $117 million in lost revenue a month, a new survey has found.The study, conducted by research company Streaming Observer and Mindnet Analytics (https://www.streamingobserver.com/ netflix-disney-survey/)of 602 current Netflix(NFLX) subscribers, comes as consumers gear up for the release of yet another streaming service from Apple Inc.(AAPL) that will offer competition for the existing services from Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com Inc., (AMZN) as well as the Disney+ offering."

"Mickey Mouse, just said buy more Disney stock"
"Entry here is at $88. No way it can keep its valuation when parts of the market are selling at 6x 2021 earnings. It is being priced like a Google and Cisco which will have much more rapid demand recovery than a Disney. At best, will remain flat for a year while the market recovers."

"This will steadily climb, boost on er, and continue on its ascent until november, when D+ debuts"
When is Disney earnings day?
Reopen the Hall of Presidents !
I think it’s down because rise of Skywalker didn’t open as well as the previous. Seems like this stock goes down on any small negative news but does not rise much on any positives. I guess we have to wait for the earning report to see any kind of jump. I bought it at 150 so I definitely have to hold.
who is thinking of going to parks this days . 90$ by the end of week
Does anyone know or has anybody here heard if Disney would reduce their dividend payout to free up some cash flow?
I spent 125 bucks watching endgame. 7 tickets in the luxury seats at AMC and lots of popcorn. My contribution to the many millions this movie will make in PROFITS
Trading in hopes & streaming. $190 next!
this will fly after hours
"big day Friday gentlemen. (and boys, JD ) Galaxy Edge Opens i’m Disneyland. Just my prediction. But $140 coming next week."
"Today’s selling seemed systematic... which is confusing to me. I mean ... reactionary selling to news or panic selling I can wrap my head around a bit with the right catalyst involved. But systematically selling DIS to this degree based on very little tangible info doesn’t stand straight to me. Of course the overall market being down is a reason, but why DIS would be near the front of the pack amongst stocks most impacted by the selloff... that’s what beguiles me..."
"Dear Mr. Iger (part III)• I have changed my watch to the Mickey Mouse watch face• Finished (and stomached after multiple viewings) live action film Aladdin....what were we thinking with this • Purchased your book “The Ride of a Lifetime I’ve done everything to help get this stock back above 145, and the 9% (I hope) pop into earnings. Rally caps on Team Disney....Rally caps on"
Nice afterhours burn. Let’s go!
Somebody knows something......this is picking up volume tremndously
this stock needs to cover my 12.99 for disney+hullu and ESPN bundle hahahaha....i think my 240 shares should cover my costs for a couple of years
"Who else wishes they were a fly on the wall at Fox right now? I'm confident that Disney will win, but curious on how it will all play out. I was always the kid that wanted to peek at the presents before Christmas. Wish I could do that for Fox!"
Disney will not be releasing subscriber numbers for Disney+ next quarterly earnings (or maybe never) all that matters is earnings beating the top and bottom line.
I’m sick to my stomach. My $90 puts will be worthless 04/24 starting tomorrow. This stock doesn’t deserve its price at the moment.
Curious what will be the market response tomorrow to Netflix and it’s effect to Disney. I hope the two stocks just rally all day tomorrow for I love and have both!!!
"Disney is a must own Stock!! Best content by a mile and will easily add 200 million subs over the next 12 months! The is no barriers to adding subs anymore, if you want to stream on a computer you can, a phone you can, a TV you can! Streaming is now ubiquitous!"
Mirroring the DOW chart precisely. Picked a the bad day to do so.
