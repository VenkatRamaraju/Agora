Recent headlines and conversations for GRPN
Interesting article and one of the reasons why GRPN has a difficult time moving upward.https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/the-6-most-shorted-nasdaq-stocks/ar-BBIfIKP
If they're not selling anything the workers are furloughed how is this stock still trading?
"So now rich Williams is in hiding again relying on short trolls like brad to cover for him,"
And I thought of buying at 5 lol
GRPN reached a new 52 Week Low at $3.10
"Groupon taking a nice healthy breather. Looks like good consolidation after a big move to me, I dont own any shares but I would make a bet that this thing coils a little longer & pops to close the gap at $35ish. CEO is really turning things around for the better for them. Probably a buyer of sept 18 $35 calls by the close or monday at open & holding them thru next week. Stock market cannot be predicted, so maybe im wrong, but my bets placed on a move to 35"
Why all the constant infantile bashing and schoolyard taunting. Aren't we all trying to make a few bucks? This is getting tiring!!! Grow up already!!!!
Looks like the chatter on this board has subsided for the time being. Will be watching closely as there has been some activity on the options side. Expect some volatility over the next 2 weeks.
Hey guys how’s it going over here
Don't be surprised if GRPN closes close to unchanged!
impressive volume AH
160% gains in 9 months! Hey Brad what's in your wallet?
Alibaba should just buy this one and not just invest in it. I only own a few shares but I would love to own BABA.
"Loaded up some shares. Groupon makes more money then Tesla, so a safer investment in that conparison. I am buying at this time, as low is when it makes sense to buy, even with couple cents a share impovement a small or mid size investment can yield wonders"
GROUPON needs to be bought out by a buyer who can hype and manage its strengths and grow its customer base.
"Looked good into close, but got pounded by last 1/2 hour selling. Market up 1% and this closes red.Is Alibaba selling? 25k was offered and cracked bid. S&P crushers are manipulating by crowding out bidders.Company could buy some shares here and turn tables on short sellers. But there goes the cash. Always looks easy on the outside...Good luck Pirates!"
Artificially inflaited stock proce due to insiders pumping the stock.....after the earnings call - which is super late....this DOG will be below $1. They have no viable product....no sales force.
John/Ji you’re post history clearly shows you’re supposed buysIf this is true. You have lost big timeBoth you’re money and mind LOL!!!!
Alibaba buyout I hope?
"Everything that is being said on this board is just the numerous ""POSSIBILITIES""; as was quoted from Rich Williams."
"""Although our financial results continue to be significantly impacted by the crisis, we are encouraged by recent performance trends that indicate our business is recovering more quickly than we expected."""
"director sell shares mean something wrong with company! next cfo and ceo sell shares.!Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) Director Eric P. Lefkofsky Sells 1,500,000 Shares"
"Grubhub would make sense, both great Chicago based companies with a lot of synergies"
JOHN I hear you are real good on the penny slots?
"market going to 0 debt global crisis, neg earnings, job cuts, fraud whitehouse reps. and many other things."
Guilermo tells you it’s going to $100 how cute is that
J how’s the chart looking?
"Best suggestion is this. Sell now to get your $12,000 back, use it to buy 12 shares TSLA. in 5 years your $12,000 will become $120,000 or more. After you do that, print what I said here out and put 2/20/2020 on it. Frame it, put it on your desk. On 2/5/2025, tell your story of how you changed a losing trade to a winning one."
Hari you call this a bullish trend??
Well it finally drowned
I like boardshorts in the summer
This hacker has been hacking the whole stock market and controlling GRPN stock price.
oh lala oh lala!!
Cosmetic moves?Shuffling chairs on the Titanic?How much time does this company have to turn things around?
G 5 BINGO!!!
Johnny still deep in the red
I just short it! whish me luck
Someone speak to Hari please Jeesh
This is where it should have been before all the excitement earlier in the week.
I think this is pump and dump.
"Wow, just read the 3rd positive article on Groupon in the last 30 days, is this a trend folks? Prior to these 3 articles, it probably was 3 years of articles where the mere mention of GRPN held a negative connotation. First time in long time, I'm feeling good about this stock... keep it coming!!"
I think the price is low and a buying opportunity.
"This stock looks a lot better than other restaurants like CAKE or PLAY,, They have something coming in right now..."
$2+ tomorrow. Market green.
"Groupon needs to connect with T.J. max Burlington,Walmart Ect for over stock or discontinued items. Make the big box stores login to groupon, post the item with price and they get a cut."
"Absolutely nothing to see on the Lefkofsky share sale. He has been selling 1.5 million shares per quarter like clockwork every quarter. Look it up. And to get a feel for the scope of the selling, he still holds more than 87 million shares."
why do i have a feeling we are going to 4 bucks after earnings on short covering
Here come the 2's
Does anybody remember that ticket co that grpn sold off a major stake in but retained i think a majority interest in what ever happen there Have they any mention recently
is it worth buying Groupon share
Go to $6 now
"Wow wow 152 million share trade today I seen something like this one, many investor bought share today tomorrow will be Grpn $ 2 and up up up......"
"They are competing with Uber and Grubhub which has every restaurant out there. Who is going to win? Groupon needs to get that inventory on its platform, but they have no idea how to.. hopefully they find someone that is able to get the job done.."
They have to do more then beat earnings they have to BLOW OUT earnings. If they can manage a double digit earnings in their worse quarter (1st) then i think we'd be on our way. I like the plan the company has i'm long and i'm patient.
Comcast invested 250 million dollars in Groupon when it was in the mid $4 dollar range after Alibaba invested in it around $4. Comcast has the right vision of GRPN to go to $12 long term.
"i don't believe any buyer out there, game over for groupon"
Looks like this stock will fade in thin air with no trace.
Allowing vendors to self-post absolutely brilliant... for this reason alone I think Groupon moves higher
Good entry under $3....
"DA Davidson analyst Forte, who “rates Groupon’s stock a buy with an $8 target, is upbeat about the Groupon+ program."
"In 2 more quarters the company will be @ about $ 1.25 if that, then bankruptcy."
"Decent results however not surprised by the end of day selling. Many other firms that had good if not great earnings fell short of Wall St expectations. Take a look at Goldman, JP Morgan Chase and others in the financial sector. All reported stellar numbers but their stocks fell after the news. The one point about GRPN's earnings release that has me going hmmmmm is the $300M stock repurchase program. I hope everyone on this board felt this was a BAD thing. Why, well the company had $135M remaining on it's previous repurchase plan and it chose not to utilize the funds before it expired on April 1. Why then would it be considered a good thing for the company to buy $300M during this program at higher stock prices? The company had plenty of time to repurchase stock at lower prices...again it chose not to. This is the thing that has driven me crazy about GRPN's leadership. They must feel another dip in price is on the horizon and want to lessen the float to account for the RSU's, options and other stock awards the buyback will offset. Something is not right here, at least with the repurchase program."
DO NOT SELL. Will be bought out by end of the year. Will triple sp from here
Oh yes something smells real bad here and once again it's not Fer
How much will the BO be? anyone buy options here if so which month?
Whoever is buying GRPN had better make their offer very soon or they will be paying quite a bit more.
Up almost 25 percent in last 5 days and good volume any news on this
GRPN is at $42 after hours. I sure hope it holds on!!
Is it time to buy GRPN on this pullback?
"Remember Cramer said to buy $grpn at $4.75 a month ago. IMHO, he IS the kiss of death...Looks like $3.75 looming."
Beautiful high today at $35.68. I look forward to see $40 or higher after Thanksgiving.
"Take a good #$%$ at the Groupon website, they categorize their deals in five different sections. 1. Things to Do2. Beauty & Spas Good 3. Goods4. Hotels & Travel5. CouponAs virus fears roil the world, many people will choose to stay indoors, which means less outdoor group activities and travels. That is a big hit on the revenue Groupon getting from sections 1, 2 and 4. Knowing that Groupon is moving away from selling Goods, so section 3 will no longer bring in any revenues down the road. For section 5 (Coupon), this is a just place where other businesses $MSFT, $AMZN advertise their deals, and we can quietly often find those deals on business official websites, so those coupons are not even exclusive at all and haven?t said that, I doubt Groupon is getting significantly revenue from this section (5). Anyway, do your own DD. Nevertheless, at this moment I rather investing stocks that are not impacted by coronavirus fear, such as cybersecurity."
People are posting that Groupon's earnings come out today but Ameritrade says May 7th
what a pos this stock is. holding it from many years and they just go down. may book my losses.
"profit is as much as GRUB...just not the market cap.. that is why they are upset... they need to buy every short share and every sold share,,, and they have the cash to do it.. they need to defend the stock like CLF's CEO.... and Williams has to make a purchase on the open market, for the street to take him serious.. And that goes for all of management..."
"This is new GRPN, shorting this stock at your own risk. GRPN has one way is up in long run"
"Wharton marketing professor David Reibstein says “Groupon has a business model that made much more sense during a downturn in the economy,” he notes. “As the economy has picked up, there is less idle capacity and extra inventory, and there is less to be available"".That comment was made in 2017. How's the US GDP doing? dropped 32% last quarter.Is that a downturn in the economy? Guillermo thinks that a 32% drop with small business closing everywhere should be considered a downturn.How much was Groupon valued at the last downturn in terms of market cap? $6B. Today? $0.9B. So 7 x, 7 times is how much we can expect Groupon to grow. And one last point. All Groupon competitors went out of business or were bought out by Groupon (Livingsocial example). So maybe that $6B should be rounded to $10B. So yes 10 times today's price. Guillermo has told you. Now keep this little secret and keep buying because $100 a share will be the BASE for the next leg-up...shshshshhshs."
"Please debate the best vs. worst candidates for a *post buyout transition:* AMZN, BABA, BKNG, COST, IAC, GOOG, or maybe even FB? Best fit I feel would be BABA, BKNG, or GOOG. Thoughts?"
GRPN is up 12.24% to 0.55
Sorry the pump is being sold. Any long active trader would take something off table here. I'm a bear...
GRPN historically reports in the AM i don’t believe earnings will be released after the close. Pre market is my guess
It would be a surprise and nice to have GRPN management provide some guidance to Q4 performance. Point being this is the busiest and most critical period for GRPN. Instead of speculating like most of the time let's hear some specifics....or did we hear indirectly today via the 5% pullback.
Thet said they have lots intrested in the company .so why sell or short the stock ?
"jan 2022's 5.5 strike..... earnings this week prty tlrd prty so july calls for a long run. Huge event for wtrh june 16th so july calls. food and grocery delivery app tht hires drivers has 10 states locked up.. igt is next dkng who is working with fan duels, huge news, as this leaks and more retail newbies find out stock soars everyday for awhile so you want june calls."
"If you look at the major points of the ER, what we have is an EPS beat of consensus estimates, but a Revenue miss of consensus estimates. Even though it was an EPS beat, the actual number NEGATIVE -$1.63/share, is still terrible. The Revenue miss is of course a very bad thing. Here are the actual numbers:Groupon Cl A (GRPN) reported a 1st Quarter March 2020 loss of $1.63 per share on revenue of $374.2 million. The consensus estimate was a loss of $1.92 per share on revenue of $400.2 million. Revenue fell 35.3% compared to the same quarter a year ago."
I think yahoo conversation is equal to yahoo message board but not being used. Why?
SHORT AND COVER AT 50 CENTS
This company literally has no value. There is no viable product.
It seems Motley Fool recommended GRPN based on cash flow and profitability trends. This should help the stock today.
TOO THE MOON!
Pure manipulation
I should of known it was bad news when Cramer recommended GRPN the other day.
Rich Williams its time to take the bid and sell the co. your time is up
Website is down
"funny all this talk about bankruptcy and going to zero, companies with over 300million in EBITA healthy cash flow , 500 million in cash and 48 million customers don't go to zero ...they get acquired"
Well looks like we are losing old Ji/John. Heart beat getting slower and slower
Sales of $2.8Bn and Market cap of $2.2Bn ..isnt that odd .
Buying
"There are so many analysts and brokers missed out the chances to buy Groupon and they said now it is a good buy, but they will wait for it to pull back. Why would you want to give up your shares now so they can take your shares from you?"
it looks like shorter's might get burned
"John I’m in love with your comedy,not grpn"
"Many small business will rely on groupon, Ubereat, gruhub, yelp and etc. The grpn stock did not reflect on it properly. Small bus owners need Groupon more than ever."
Hello fellow GRPNville citizens. Another down day with the stock dripping all of its prior gains away. That’s OK though because we have stopped the chart reading and other technical analysis. We now concentrate on karma and positive vibes. The big G also known as GRPN provides us happiness and comfort just by holding our shares tight. Let’s enjoy the weekend and look forward to next weeks action...Go big G!!!
"strong buying into the close, you have to be a damn idiot to sell now"
3.50 today.....
"8,000,000 shares traded on a friday"
JOHN you celebrating 3.04??
Lifeless stock...not much hope. Long wait will be very tiring.
SELL SHORT NOW going under $4 in few min
Where is everyone on this board. First action like forever over .20 and not a post. Go grpn!
Classic tug-of-war between buyers and sellers taking place. Volume is average. The festivities usually get a bit crazier around 3:30 EST as the volume tends to accelerate. Waiting for the next leg up.
J you running out ofpump?
Arsm put the vodka bottle down son
"I don't think analyst are correct 95%, it's just manipulation but what a gift!"
Groupon is no up today as the result of a short squeeze. Look at today's SEC filings. Blackrock purchased 1.6 million shares of GRPN. But now you nay sayers better run for cover.
"What a nice massage I just bought, love groupon!!"
"Someone, somewhere, knows something."
This was also great news longs >>>>>>https://finance.yahoo.com/m/af1ad5e5-5c57-3388-ae0f-344d8b5fe40f/groupon-taps-tbwa%2Fchiat%2Fday.html
Time to put the company on sale. Tired of hearing from the CEO the same old talks on every earning report for YEARS!!!. It is high time to Deliver results or You're FIRED Mr. Rich.
Above 4$ by tomorrow
@Brad is crying hard again as he doesn't know how to play with equity market......I am keep saying don't emotionally attached with any equity...play carefully!
Amazing how the company is not going to zero on an up day.
Well the good news this Tuesday is Barry's back. That can only mean one thing...the stock is going up!! Nice to have you back Barry.
Business model consistently fails to adapt to the moderna era of savings. Fair value for groupon is about a $250M M/C and/or abouts $9 a share
The call so far is a train wreck. No guidance available until 2022. Will take at least 1-2 years to determine if strategy will be working. The new CFO is throwing out pro forma data with little to no basis. Wow...this is as bad as it gets. I will keep updating. Q & A is starting
"Time to buy, finally getting out of goods, and focusing on experience, launching a new app..Things will turn around..cutting costs thru getting rid of goods a big big plus!!"
Oh Hari This is great now that I’m done with J and John l have you
I was thinking I bought good stock but going down every day after I bought st 5.79
Yep. A move to high 2's
"I think GRPN is struggling this season, big time. Is it just me, or is everyone else getting hammered by Groupon in their email accounts this year. Seems like I am getting 4-5 emails per day lately."
Short for sure.
C is a short- post all you want
"Groupon screwed over ALL its customer base by REFUSING to give refunds back to credit card payments - They issued ""groupon bucks "" instead-- Dont believe me ? ""google it --"
J and Hohn could not be happier with their investment 
"@J You always mention technical chart, why do you ignore the super bull weekly and monthly chart for GRPN? Only weekly chart and monthly chart can tell you the long-term trend."
Bought some more late yesterday and today. This is a buying opportunity before q3 results and q4 revisions higher. IMHO
"If Alibaba wants to take a bigger stake in GRPN, I don't mind.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-stock-owners-fear-pinduoduo-153602470.html"
this one's going up to 42
who still bagholding since last earnings?
"Good luck to all the short of grpn, i ain't shorting grpn since i see this stock is going up. Old grpn is not the new grpn"
Volume drying up
Hold on Tight....

J losing daily 
happy to break a buck..
I just loaded up
You really have to love the 'golden cross' chart formation that happening now with GRPN. It bodes well for future upward price movement. Let's hope the price can get into at least the mid 4s on this move. GLTA
"Short that #$%$. This company is dead. If the revert split will take place, the stock will find itself back to its current value pretty fast after."
"Groupon is rolling out a new format for new sellers. This means that an ebay , amazon or alibaba could move inand purchase it. Also, Walmart, or any other big retailer. Look around November - Jan for a possible buyout rumor. If you're in, stay in, Christmas is always good to GRPN. Especially in the 4th and 1st qtr."
I’ve never owned any Groupon but just bought 500 shares. It’s kinda like I used a coupon to buy a cheaper “experience!!” Finger crossed!!
Buyout! Announcement after the bell
"Shorts would love to see this price go below $5 and play on your fears. Unless insider info was leaked (unlikely)...Many ""small cap"" stocks will see this pattern with the information void before earnings to take out stops."
Look at my post from 6 hours ago. GRPN is the Darling of WALL STREET again.Search All Financial sites and make an informed decision.
Time to load up...
I sold at 28. Something Gonna buy back lel
"So glad this is going up. After getting whacked on the Facebook news, need to get some money back."
Earnings +++ We're Back.....Go GRPN!
"Grub hub missed, I’m surprised GRPN is holding up this well. In the past it had reacted quite a bit to positive Grubhub news"
John it is well documented in your post history every buy you claim the share price has dropped the stock has not showed a decent trading pattern for you to trade in and out of like you claim you lost big time
BaBa is the only buyer that makes any sense.
Website of GRPN is almost like Amazon now. Go GRPN !
Doesn’t Groupon do well in bad economic times. Isn’t that the premise from 2008. Their product is more attractive to both retailer and customer.
This stock is truly despised. A 10% drop on this report is absurd. This is exactly what I have been asking Williams and team to mitigate. Until management can change the perception of this company it will continue to languish in the depths of irrelevance.
GRPN is up 15.73% to 1.03
Groupon lost some major segments prior to corona; and got even hit harder due to corona.Maybe a take over play; or a post covid play later on. For now it's a sell in my opinion.
"I would have taken that 75 cents a share too, nice pickup. Holding steady."
J here come the2's. You still happy and confident with your investment?
ok i am in at the money aug 14th puts.. let's see if this can hold well worth few hundred bet this falls back to 20 in next 3 days
GRPN reached a 52 Week low at 2.18
https://www.chaffeybreeze.com/2017/02/24/groupon-inc-grpn-stock-rating-upgraded-by-zacks-investment-research.html
So when is the reverse split?
It's a buy in high 2's
This run up is due to the upcoming SB commercial. Groupon has enough money to buy a spot. It’s a bullish sign. You’ll see spikes in sales post SB
Buy all you can at these levels. Wow.
GRPN/EBAY makes a lot of sense on paper... EBAY is going through a major business change and has been encouraged to spin off StubHub...They have massive scale and could possibly integrate and utilize GRPN in ways GRPN can’t as a stand-alone... Expecting an ultra positive quarter for GRPN and much higher price going forward
JOHN and J. Ready for 2's?
"I just sold another 8000 shares. 20000 shares sold Friday and today. If it isn’t going up, then it is coming down. Not much profit with these trades."
Thank God at last JOHN has found a new friend in Hari It’s been tough on him since J’s death
told u....
"If you own this sell for a cheaper price... shareholders are not happy with this company. Price will be driven down dramatically. Earnings are bad, not a turnaround story here.."
Hasn’t been profitable in 10 years. Reverse split tells that story. I don’t think their business model is working well to be profitable. But who knows if they make significant changes in their business model to be profitable in future.
"19% shares held short, if earnings and guidance are positive this will run big time"
13F's are coming in and a couple of interesting updates...First Trust Advisors increased their position by 5.5M shares to 17.1M shares and Pictet Asset Management added 4.8M shares for a total of 11.6M shares.The only notable sale to date is SG Capital Management who closed out a position of 1.3M sharesSumitomo Asset Management maintained their position of 7.6M shares.Funds have until May 15th to report prior quarters activity.
does groupon still exist???????
This stock is going to free fall down
Brat/brad has 419 posts.Every single one is putting down other posts. Look at them.
"so I got a free share from robinhood long time ago, and suddenly disappeared after the reverse split....so I basically lost it then?"
"Groupon to Release First Quarter 2020 Financial Results on June 16, 2020BusinessWireGroupon, Inc. announced today that it intends to release its first quarter 2020 financial results on Tuesday, June 16, 2020 after the close of market trading. The Company will file its Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission, issue a press release, and post a letter to stockholders and a slide presentation to its IR website.While Groupon will not host a conference call to discuss its first quarter financial results, the company does intend to host a conference call when it discloses second quarter financial results in August. The Interim CEO, CFO and investor relations team will be available for follow-up calls with investors and analysts after the first quarter financial results have been disclosed."
"just a bad DNA within this company...bought an item for 199 and the PROMO code did not take...then immeddiately repurchased the same exact item and the promo code was accepted...now they REFUSE to return my $199.00 no one to speak to in the USA, so this is not how you keep customers."

An upgrade is always good
Groupon worst investment I've ever made in 50 years!!! Will be $0 soon!!!
Wouldn't give a damn if Williams is not trumpeting and tooting his horn so long as he delivers results that delight investors. We all shall be witness to Q4 results. Making excuses and promising better next quarter will not fly with analysts. Where's the beef?
After buyback is complete.. 15% of outstanding shares will be gone. Ticket Monster should go public in coming year... This stock will be ready to rip to $8..
"Groupon Press Release Confirms Q4 Adj. EPS $0.07 Misses $0.15 Estimate, Sales $612.3M Miss $709.35M Estimate"

WORSE THAN MACYS KMART WHICH IS IRONIC SINCE GROUPON WAS AT THE START OF THE INTERNET KILLS BRICK AND MORTAR RETAIL
"It seems that a major concern about GRPN relates to declining revenues. However, it seems that mgmt purposely decided to trade revenues in exchange for profitability. Mgmt has been very successful in increasing ebitda and cash flow. If there are any hints in the next call that revenues will again start rising, this stock could skyrocket."
buy buy buy. grpn too cheap to ignore
Buying more
3 dollars tommorow buddy ride the wave....u aim getting no pointers from me
Plug power went to .10 now every one loves it at $4 things change and timing in the market is everything Grpn $3 buyout
Good time To get in?
Volume in the first 90 minutes is slightly above average. Sellers are in charge for the moment. There are buyers out there based on what I am seeing on level 2. We will see how the remaining 5 hours goes. Short interest will be updated after the close today.
if they think they are returning to growth then why the rs
After hour bid:Bid 48.05 x 800Ask 48.07 x 3000
It looks like some big investors buying in GRPN.
The .95 GRPN loss was calculated using pro-forma accounting method. If earnings would had been calculated by the Gaap method the loss would have been 2.53 per diluted share.
"Be patient, it will be over $6 in a year"
"rich Williams did not show a single penny in profit in 10 years, why is he still there."
Who said 40 by thanksgiving??LOL!!!!!!
Company is turning around! Awesome!!
"Interesting last 3 days. There is quiet accumulation on the dips, and the MAC is showing overbought. Merger Monday accounts for one-third of the weekly mergers --so, there may be some bets o. The coming week. It's unlikely, but may a count for the buying on the dips.We shall see."
A possible buyout by AMZN at $24.
anyone listening a call at 9am...pls update us.....
Is there a deal they got? Great jump!
"Tomorrow’s activity will tell all about the earnings. Who has calls or puts into Friday’s release. If you can’t read the tea leaves by tomorrow’s action then you are in the wrong stock. J, get off your high horse about charts and the other BS. Come out with some concrete predictions for GRPN’s share price at the close on 8-3, that includes your rationale. Your time has come to see if you have any idea what you are talking about."
Losses continue.Net Income Avi to Common (ttm) -226.1M

"GOING DOWN TO DEEPEST HELL, NEW ALL TIME LOWS THIS WEEK"
you RBS
Got out of this bear with a profit. Been holding it for a while. I’ll buy back after it drops again (and it will). This won’t get bank to pre-covid levels until a vaccine is approved.
Shorting this company along with all of ecom even if they have great earnings street wont care because pandemic economy is over $shop $grpn $ostk $w $gddy
Longs have no hope to get there money back for a very long time..
How great would it be if GRPN not only posted a beat...but surprise dropped it today after the bell instead of tomorrow?? My portfolio needs some sunshine. Ugh.
Russell reconstitution will end the sell off. Watch the volume at the close tomorrow.
"Great ER Crushed EPS, 779m cash in the bank & running costs significantly reduced."
"Numbers are fair, guidance raise is good news. The new COO is a plus and the change in board members is also positive. GRPN looks like they are making sound investments for the future."
after all u guys sell I will pick it up 2.5 cheap
"Maybe not, but nice move and it's not retailers."
Did they revise forward earnings at all? At least they made a profit GAAP and beat revenue. It’s not a terrible report. I’m not sure where they got .13 from. last year they estimated .09 and they made .07. So it’s 43% year over year profit increase.
FER IS NOW 2.88
I could agree at some level with that..the company has some work to do still believe the company is worth more than current levels .. not expecting sky rocket numbers here .. maybe investors are tired of waiting amd moving on
Sweet heaven to me!! Predicted pattern!! Easy!!
Be buying
Lunchtime volume is STRONG
"sad to say,,, the Financials do not match the share price.."
"As I posted the other day, this is all we needed: Positive quarter with raised guidance. So we will see $8 per share in 2018. The new acquisition, the rising of the international side and Groupon+ taking over is the recipe for $8. We might get to $9-$10 to retract to $8. Then, next year I see $12 by Spring.I listened to the CC: in some markets Groupon+ has surpassed regular vouchers: people and merchants love it. And this is just the beginning because G+ is missing from hundreds of markets. It will get there in the next 12 months.Plus deals with Ticketmaster, MLB...Finally the mobile app is becoming technically top-notch (thanks to the newly hired CTO) embedding tickets, allowing electronic payments (commission fee!!), etc.GLTA"
no need to panic. they still got Cash
"Who's loading up the truck, not Brad he's broke!!"
Groupon has changed they business model in a good way. I'm buying more. This is a huge opportunity.
"I solf half my position with an average price in the 2.70s right before close as I had a feeling they will miss. The question is, should I pick up the position now in the aftermarket? Reverse split is not going to happen as no sane shareholder will approve it!"
"Short interest decreased slightly from 37M to 35M shares, approximately 6 days to cover. UBS upgraded to neutral however the PT remains at current levels. As I mentioned in a post yesterday afternoon, I am suspicious/ leery of the repurchase program. All the other news during the earnings release was upbeat. Why would the company feel the stock is a good investment at these levels when it chose to leave $135M of the prior repurchase plan on the table. The one way the company can show the market they have faith in their strategy is for Williams and other execs to buy shares on the open market."
John every time you have posted a buy the stock falls to a new year lowYou’re thoughts??
This stock is and will continue to be the best short of 2019!!!! Makes the list year in and year out..
Whisper number is .12 with revenues of 860M. Consensus earnings number is .09 with revenue of 852M
Bought another 1000 shares today.
IHow Groupon could get these numbers and beat on revenue by $1.71 in this bad economy and pandemic? How the stock could go up 34% in after hours ? Looks like they have manipulated their report. Time for sec to investigate.
Poor Brad and .01 missed their Shrinks Appt this week
"Sorry boys & girls...made my option money.....now waiting for a buy out to come within 3 months.....thanks for the 2,500 hundred made this week....not bad fro a weekly salary..Thanks again"
Looks like there is a solid floor at 5.20
Sorry can’t buy into a company that gets its stock up by taking away people’s paychecks
This is looking a lot like yesterday. Shorts or whoever sells off 1st 60-90 minutes then they start to cover. Or buyers appear (whichever scenario you prefer). I think a buyer would need to buy before earnings are announced or their price paid might be a lot higher.

It's all about the Earnings.If you believe we beat...BUY. If you believe we don't beat...SELL.I'M BUYING and HOLDING.
sold some more today... sell more than you buy... it works well.. make money going up and down.. but more is made on the down side than up on this stock... otherwise it is dead money...

"Only company that does not want to make a sale of an item online for a discount, hence them having lower revenue and they are trying to claim that is good shareholders .. what a joke"
"Use covid to right size the company and refine business plan to exploit the 750 mil in the bank and the existing sales channel. R/S... so what... that can be bad if your broke or have 1 foot in BK..... GRPN is no where close to that, so a R/S could have a contrarian effect with the 750 mil cash balance, rather than the typical post split drip..... that is IF they even do a R/S after all. Certainly they will be pressed for a R/S update and time line on next quarterly call."
Down on a up market?? Not good ..
I love the shorts that constantly do a THUMBS DOWN on all longs posts. Hey sissies...identify your lame butts. Have an intelligent conversation if you are able. Ask mommy to help you.

markets up by 1000 points and Groupon goes down?
my prediction IAC will acquire GRPN ...MTCH initiated a special dividend and IAC will receive the bulk of it...they needed the extra cash for the deal
What a bunch of long dreamers about a buyout. Its amazing how they talk themselves into this stuff and why in the world would they make an announcement after earnings are posted? They would announce during the call .
Why didn’t I sell the other day? I lost thousands on this stock 
Great earnings and a very positive outlook going forward. Company has had its ups and downs but I think it’s finally finding it’s place and market.
Congratulations to the shorts!!!Beautiful!
"Looks like they crushed earnings: .13 cents a share, rising revenue, guided much higher for next quarter. CONGRATS LONGS!"
REAPOST FROM 21 Hrs ago. Call activity starting to pick up so will the volatility. False signals will start to appear everywhere. Don't be a weak hand to many players.
.01 and Brad must be heavily sedated!!
"All in Groupon now, SCHAWB reported Groupon may get upgrade. They're making money company!!!! $5 soon"
Does anyone know when earnings call is? Thought it was today
my gut is telling not to go crazy on Groupon
"This is way over brought and pumped stock, company reported second quarter loss and jump over 100%, Local revenues of $99.7 million declined 59.6% from the year-ago quarter. North America Local revenues decreased 53.8% and International Local revenues fell 73.6%, excluding foreign exchange effect. International down 85%"
J is John is George 
This company is going bankrupt. Living Social is actually still a half decent site cause they kept the customer service separate.
Johnathan put the vodka bottle down son
"If there is a buyout down the road ---we will see a $4 billion dollar purchases price, combination of stock and cash for the company. That places an approximate price of $6-6.25 per share buyout. That would be a nice premium for stockholders.It is probably a likely scenario, considering the M&A activity in this space, Groupon not denying rumors, and better than expected earnings moving forward. What a buyer from the big internet companies would be looking for is expanded user base rather than just top line profit. GRPN would fit that bill."
J what are you on man??
Black Friday deals are doing very well.....GO GRPN!
hold on to GRPN! its slowly will work its way back to $10 or quickly if it gets bought out (BABA!).
somebody doesn't like the private offering Mr. CEO & Mr. CFO!!!
Just bought discount airport parking... thanks Groupon!!
"Cash is king in retail, not to mention online presence. With those 2 in hand you have alot of maneuverability."
"No news for us, but someone has the inside scoop."
Where do people think the stock price will be the day before earnings? Realistically people.
In @1.38 will unload at around 1.44
"Got a partial fill on that last pop, but not 100%. Still want a few more Short shares at $27.50..."
J has a special brand of comedy. Just like his stock picks
Sold this stock last year for a higher price than the current price. I was hoping some day GRPN would get their act back together so I could re-purchase - but - nothing has changed. If this stock follows its normal pattern after earnings...expect it to dip into the upper 2's lower 3's...
Just saw GRPN published on the daily alert watchlist at (http://stocktip.xyz)
Congrats longs! Trading at $1.35 split adjusted!
Grub is the best G spot in town!!
Watching Google kicks themselves and drooling about not to proceed to bid higher price for Groupon years ago when they wanted it. Google wants to have a business like Amazon and until today they still don't have it. Groupon truly is a good candidate buyout target for Google.
Lefkowsky purchased 250k shares last June 18th @21.57. Happy now?
they will wait till the 3's to buy back shares
"GRPNs sales tax collection won’t affect it like it will affect Amazon. If your are buying a big ticket item then the sales tax might make a difference where you purchase it. If you are buying something for $30-$40 having to pay sales tax isn’t really doing to influence many people, because all internet sites are affected so they will have to drive somewhere to buy the item which is more expensive than the sales tax."
"What is the deal with Fave of Singapore, buying Groupon?? Anyone have anymore info"
Month end qtr end selling. No volume. Nothing going on but a chart. Too cheap to sell.
Brad & Barry when are you going to apologise?
there should be a class action suit filed against the BOD. Where is their financial oversight and boligations to the shareholders?
Holding strong!!
Any predictions for today?
1 for 20 ouch
There is a lt of BS in those numbers.
Im buying 1000 @ 2.92 just for entertainment
"It blows me away that Groupon has $780MM in cash, with an $860MM market cap. I understand that the company needs to find some footing and they are not selling quite as many deals as they used to, but why the heck won't the street value their active customers and their positive cash flow? Despite what shorties say, they aren't a BKO candidate. I would hope the stock would be a bit higher ($40's-50's) based on existing metrics -- but I'm not predicting or even expecting that to happen."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-warming-groupon-inc-014258186.html
My heart sank when I saw the earnings report.But then I noticed the chart over the past 2 years with their declining revenue. Holding my short! Thus thing will sell off in the coming says as the robinhooders get their margins called
someone knows something volume through the roof IAC buyout coming
Was there an upgrade today?
Hahahaha....holding a stock were bad #s will be reported.
volatility is all over the place.
Why did this spike today ?
I guess there allowing the shorts to cover now

"sell no bad new for grpn, some one down grade grpn to 2.3"
I have been a customer of GRPN for a few years now which was why I decided to purchase stock. I have been watching Alibaba stock and I read all the customer reviews of people who have shopped online with Alibaba and there are so many bad reviews. I know the business structure is different but the horrible reviews of Alibaba compared to their stock price is ridiculous. I am surprised the stock is trading that high and GRPN is at this price. Makes no sense.
Broke through $21 pretty resoundingly.....
Possible covering from shorts coming in now …...
Amazon will buy this and give coupons on the world. Here we go!!!!!
"Piper Jaffray maintains Overweight on Groupon, price target of $5.50.From here we are talking about a 58% raise. Not too bad.Then, if we can stabilize in the $5 area, financial institutions/indexes will have to buy GRPN back. From there road to $10 should be pretty smooth.One fact I would like to underline: under R.Williams, current CEO (since dec 2015) :Every single earnings CC, GRPN has beaten estimates by at least $.01. Revenues: 2016 Q4 has increased year over year that justified a run to $4.75 in February. Now if Q2 rev show improvement (in 2016 Q2 rev were $750M) now analysts estimates just $670M, a big stock price rise is possible. If rev come at 700M+ we might see a 20% rise in stock price that day alone..."
Groupon is up 18.55% to 1.47
"I never rely on any analyst’s comments for my investment. Do you Remember a very popular guy commented GE stocks earlier this year , he said many times GE target price was $6, he was always wrong ."

I say short GRPN for at least a year from now.... I see it tanking.
"Just after the ER, this stock spiked to $28. Since then it's been down almost every day. Today it dropped to $16. Most likely, it will keep on dropping. Thank goodness for the reverse stock split. We would have been delisted already."
A lot of short covering by day traders playing on earnings Tomorrow may start weak but investors will step in and take her right back up Don't. Be fooled by this action
Monday should be earnings report

"its over for this company, very red day tomorrow"
"GRUB is up 6% PM, but GRPN nothing so far!!"
LOL 20$ and this is off the rails!
Rally next week because I sold all my shares this week.
Short interest decreased by 8.5% to 32.3M shares. This is a consistent pattern when you look over the historical reporting data.Nevertheless less short interest as of now.
up on a severe down day and high volume..............you know what that means right?
It would appear to me that GRPN should do rather well if the new tax bill is passed. YELP (similar) has taken off. Anyone think otherwise?
ouch!!
Buckle up it's time to take off......
"Volume, meaning interest has dried up. Crazy how management spurns the marketing machine. No news, nothing to report. The company invests in a new COO, has new products like Groupon + and yet cannot find a way to drive awareness and build momentum."
John celebrating this share price??? How cute is that
Back in at 5.36 with the stock and calls that i sold around 6...Looking for 6.50-6.75 as the next target. I believe 5.25ish is as low as it goes.peace!!!!!!
"Well guys, happy with the gains at .93. Going to go count some cash. Good luck to all"
J and JOHN happier than ever with their grpn investment 
"Whenever Grpn hits above $5. It is wise to sell the whole position, if you are holding, because history shows that it will always go back into the $3 to $4 range.. do not buy this stock if it ever goes back to the 5 range.. buy and sell this great company and make money, very easy with this stock.. don't buy above five or you will cry..just buy now!!"
"Aegis names internet M&A potentials for 2019.

Potential buyers stretch across large cap internet/tech stocks and PE firms."
Big announcement today!
Volume is light so far. Let's see how the rest of the day plays out. The technical look good. The stock needs some sort of accelerant to get kick started. C'mon Williams work your magic!
Grpn should be pushing ads through the holidays..Looking for a positive news in the coming weeks...

"Wayfair has identified products that are selling in the work from home venue. Groupon is doing the same. Wayfair stock symbol W....is up over 40% since it announced revenue improvement driven by work from home products. After all, we are staying home for all of April...and then some."
Down a whole 8 cents on a closing basis from the day they announced they were shopping themselves. July 9th. People this company is worth two times what it is currently trading for.
Interesting seeing the same law firms jumping on the bandwagon once one starts their action. Sorta like vultures if you will. I saw the same names in another stock -- nothing came out of it as I remember. We need a change. At least we can agree on that.
Hopefully 70 is in a week and 100 is the best wish in foreseeable near terms but the market is not stable right now.
why is this up?
Read the earnings report.. decline decline in everything but yet they earned money!!! Lol smh
Guillermo has another tip for you. Virgin G. just started moving at $17 after losing about $15. High chance that next stop will be about $22...thank me later.
Sounds like a Berry and James Bond are the “Mike” of this form like INO
Groupon best earning last quarter and has sufficient amount of cash reserve. It deserves to be rewarded to no less than $36. It is also set up as a potential buyout target by Google Alphabet. Long term target at $60.
Will this ever go up to $60?????
Companies planning reverse stock splits are usually not takeover candidates..... Avoid irrational exuberance....... MTNB
GRPN is a pure online play. Expect explosive online growth in merchandise sales as consumers sit home and buy online. Rising tide lifts all boats.
So Groupon Mgt thinks it will attract more institutions into the shares by instituting a Reverse Split? Seriously doubt that considering the dire straits of Groupon. But there will be Shorts waiting in the wings after the RS.
"Sold KR for a nice little profit, looking to get Short now at $27.50+"
Let the short squeeze begin. I'm not selling any of my shares anytime soon. GRPN leadership is finally on the right rack. This baby now has legs to get back to its original IPO price and more. Would not be surprised to see buyout either. GO GRPN!!!!!
Looks like it’s going back down .. sell
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lawsuits-filed-against-bbby-grpn-002000447.htmlIt wasn’t misleading? Robinhood investors just pumped the stock because it was under 5 bucks. They buy anything under 5, they got crushed and now think it was Groupons fault?"
"Hopefully soon.. “D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte sees potential in bids from IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC -0.6%) or Booking Holdings (BKNG +0.3%), along with a scenario that would combine it with Yelp (YELP +0.1%)."
"Failure Is Not an Option. Bad time for many stocks, hang and see what earnings will bring. I'm still confident the $6 range is on the near horizon."
Roller coaster. Again chart still hold the bull. Hold on! Even more volatile next week. We should see the trade between 4.6-5.5 before next Thursday. Friday will give us a clear direction to break $6. Take a rest in weekend.
Pumpers blindly pumping without reasoning. Aiding and abetting.
Looking like this will pop to 4 after closing
it will be 20 bucks by lunch time
When is the earning report?
if someone is going to buy them they better do it now its go time.

Big volume today...
"Groupon seems to have turned the corner. In 4Q20, GRPN reported $14.0 mill in profit. Marketing and selling expense way down. Groupon is finally cash flow positive. The number one change for the better is allowing merchants to list and modify deals themselves. By eliminating the need to go through customer support, the process is less labor-intensive, less expensive and provides better experience for merchant and customer. Groupon is down to 4,159 employees sa of 12/31/20. Anyone else see the turnaround?"
This stock will definitely end green. The company is steady blossoming. I personally know tons of people who use groupon so the activity it there and increasing.
I can’t wait until the Black Friday numbers come in. I bet Groupon sees record traffic throughout the weekend.
"1) $400M in revenues in a quarter when a) VIRTUALLY ALL BUSINESSES are shutdown is INCREDIBLE b) the company said were shutting down goods sale2) Tremendous cost cutting efforts with further workforce cut.3) Projected EBITDA of $300B a year from now.4) Businesses reopening, vaccines, covid going away, etc. make any current estimates WAY UNDERESTIMATED. Soon analysts will have to double those.Make this a stock worth NOW AT LEAST RIDICULOUSLY LOW $40 ($2) per share. As covid shrinks analysts will keep raising stock targets all the way to $90 within 12 months.Guillermo has been in this business for 20+ years. Guillermo believe GRPN will have a OSTK like trend.Great job CEO and new execs!GL to longs"

Latest short interest will be released after the market closes today.
Yep. And let the drop begin
"That's quite a lot of volume for the day and a move of a nickel for closing .... any ideas what this is leading too? The only thing that stands out is the 10 DMA crossing the 200 DMA, will it cross or bounce next week?"
"No worries - heading into the Best qtr,s for GRPN. Low volume with some short manipulation. Hang on to the shares."
"I only knew about Folios Garden in Palo Alto until Groupon was offering the tickets. Groupon offers local entertainment, local winery, local get away, local spas and the list goes on. It is the perfect site for all of us who are ready to get out and have fun after the lock down eases. $65 no less is my target."
IBM sues everyone its a part of their business
"opps, 1.17 got squeezed a bit today. Maybe crushed to $7.11 soon?"
5$ by Friday
Come on make a nice comeback
"I love falling knives, so catching some GRPN here at $2.395. Maybe will catch some more below $2.30"
Groupon investment for long run. Around 1B in hand with huge revenue. Their just need to pivot the model to make Groupon profitable then GRPN share will increase price in no time.
John everytime you claim to buy the stock falls more....
When do they BK?
Good time to buy.
Get ready guys
Groupon is up 19.33% to 1.53
"I’m not sure what will be discussed during the call. However, based on the Q3 call, it appeared that Q3 would be the low point in terms of the short term headwinds they were seeing from the G+ rollout. Q4 would start seeing more of the benefits of G+."
Should close 3 and above today
Don’t forget $WLL we’re up 100% right now
"Mig Capital, Blackrock and others did not increase their ownership the past 2 months just to throw their money away!!"
why isn't GRPN going through the roof even with these numbers?!
Exposure is key once GRUBHUB and credit card service kick in.
Doesn't BABA own a large portion of this Co. ????
Im glad I only had 30 shares from a few months ago when I was dabbling... otherwise it would be pretty painful watching the price shrink day over day.
What did you think of the Groupon Superbowl commercial?
The 2018 Russell US Index reconstitution schedule is as follows:May 11 – “rank day” – Russell US Index membership eligibility for 2018 reconstitution determined from constituent market capitalization at market close.June 8 – preliminary US index add & delete lists posted to the FTSE Russell website after 6:00 PM US eastern time.June 15 & 22 – updated US index add & delete lists posted to the FTSE Russell website after 6:00 PM US eastern time.June 22 – reconstitution is final after equity markets close.June 25 – equity markets open with newly reconstituted Russell US Indexes.
Again sector wise Red day but SHORTIES manipulated this  bit more as usual... WAIT till earnings surprise to crush them badly!
grubhub! love it
I'm buying more this is a Christmas gift
the more it drops the more I buy
Painful for all those who sold regardless of the close. Value always has a floor and GRPN is apparently found it. Not sure where it's going but i think low 4's may be a bottom. Let see where it closes. GLTA
Will be over $5 soon. Company is doing an amazing job creating successful partnerships & concentrating on making money in the right places while streamlining operations. Stock has great momentum now. Good job to those who held on when it went to the low 3s on nothing but manipulation.
three fifty three seventy five four dollars!
Groupon reached an all time low at 1.15
Why the spike?
"EPS is what matters, not emotions. GRPN has been for sale for quite a while, per ReCode. You would think the Chinese or Europeans would want this, but no. 2 before 7."
Groupon...looking good. No one propping this dog up.
Anyone wanna guess a bottom?
Single digits
"to all the short, you will lose a lot of money. "
where does this stock go from here?
Barry I think Guillermo is the new John
"I saw a buyer a while back on level 2 that bought 30,000 !! That must have been roughly 150k.."
Anyone else getting sick with GRPN always down?
"No matter how you slice it, I suspect large volumes of MD 20/20 will be consumed at the short camp this evening."
Check option open interest. My post was deleted reporting 4.50 Oct19 Call. Unusual bullish action in OI. Don't get caught unaware.
They need a doorbuster for the stock on the Groupon site. But looks like they need to have better deals year round and do a sale like this each quarter.. only then will revenue's grow..
Based on last print GRPN is down 5 cents from the July 9th closing price of 4.83 after the rumor of a deal was announced. Nothing to see here just a deep value stock for patient investors.
"Lets evaluate what has taken place: Chairman takes a bundle of funds that's owed to him...Groupon Plus is taking future shape..... Groupon selling Headquarters in Chicago for a nice profit..... tax selling will be taking place for end of year..... market charts still looks good and hoping that it trends sideways beginning next week. All we need now for Christmas is lots of buying from GROUPON, so that we can have a Happy New Year in the Fourth Quarter."
Grpn stuck in a tide range. I hop we gona see a move north next week in time for earnings
"Folks should understand things about business and why GOOG still is a candidate to buy Groupon. Perhaps now more than years ago. AT the time of GOOG's $6 bil offer for Groupon (2011?), Groupon was unproven. Yes they had massive growth...yes they bombarded peeps with emails to get that growth. Back to Goog and its offer. Do you really think that GOOG's BOD would have easily allowed that $6 bil purchase? Without much scrutiny? No way, it would have been tough...by that I mean tougher than today. Groupon is stable. It is an authentic company earning money based on a business model that works. Sure further tweaking of said model would help ore in the way of profits. At the end of the day though, it has been streamlined to a smaller, more prosperous, country foot print...lowered its labor head count, restrained from making silly acquisitions like Order Up and Bread crumb any more. If the BOD of GOOG, were to be tasked with approving a deal now, vrs years ago, I am confident the odds are WAY HIGHER for approval. Integrate the platform in to GOOG business and WAM BAM lets make even more money than we do now at GOOGLE!!!!!IMO of course;)"
Wow 5x or 30m shares traded.. ya May go down tomorr but im guessing sellers gettn exhausted and we r gettn close to a bottom..
Why don’t people understand GRPN is a data analytics company. Not a discount consumer haven. I mean it is but it’s more than that. They aren’t going below $1. The only way they can possibly get a RS is if it falls below 1 dollar and gets board approval which it won’t on both instances. If it’s sub 1.50 that’s a bargain and I will be buying conservatively over the next 6 months long term. They have brand recognition and solid long term client base.
"The CAO decided to start selling again. 15,000 shares on 5-25."
"Groupon stock is currently halfway through its third straight year of losing money, and according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, the company has begun burning cash (reporting negative free cash flow) as well. Analysts who cover the stock are forecasting continued losses for Groupon stock almost as far as the eye can see. The earliest most analysts believe Groupon might resume reporting profits is 2024.With losses mounting and a recession looming, Groupon stock might not make it that long."
Third highest volume day of 2019 outside of earnings on 2/12-2/13 time frame on zero news. Proof that there are machines buying and selling shares in publicly traded companies who could care leas about anything but shear price movement and CHARTS. GRPN should die at 3.50 for foreseeable future.
"filled the gap down through 4.40,can't fight technical strength!"
Brad and .01 off their Meds again!
does anyone use this now since covid have yet to use for anything
Did Groupon reverse split?
Groupon's ap is well known to be one of the best in the on-line merchant business.
"such low volume.. just 2Mn in first 4 hours, almost another 2 hours about to go.."
I see insider buys not sales
Institutions will be buying now and the future is going to be great.
Strong Buy. Will explode https://cweb.com/groupon-still-the-king-of-daily-deals/
It's been kind of rough reply and GRPN board started to become DIRTY instead of valuable information or news... There should be valid reason or opinion about Bear or bull but no personal attact or bad mouthering.... Anyone opt-in for healthy discussion with little fun along the way??
My order at 2.50 was triggered...
That's it .. I had enough. Sold .. Took a 5k loss .. not seeing this going up enough anytime soon.. And if it did how much could it possibly go. Not worth it anymore at this point. Took my 5k loss and took my remaining balance and jumped more into the MJ sector.. Bought more ACBFF and CRON.. more of a potential upside and could def cover my loss on GRPN. Real shame I have been a customer of Groupon for years and also a shareholder.. Def will remain a customer but as an investor there is more money to be made in other areas.
Shorts better cover
"Volume for the last month is 50% below the avg. There is zero interest in the stock and the chart looks awful, but that doesn't change the value proposition."
3.60 today. 3.49 tommarow.. rinse and repeat for weeks
Load up!!!
J celebrating current price. Loves his grpn
Yes or no
I wonder if the company is buying any shares as part of their repurchase plan. Not that it will move the needle. I just would prefer they take advantage of the opportunity.
"From ER Q2>During the second quarter, we repurchased 4.2 million shares for $15 million, ending the quarter with $260 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.Groupon bought back at $3.57. They should buy back more at this value."
Time to squeeze the SHORTS
"D.A. Davidson analyst Tom Forte said that there were low expectations for Groupon heading into the report, prompting an initial relief rally after the numbers hit. But he sees a number of reasons why the stock came under pressure shortly afterward, including a change to the earnings-call format that focused it less on prepared remarks and allowed for a frank discussion of traffic-related challenges facing the business.Forte, who rates Groupon’s stock a buy with an $8 target, is upbeat about the Groupon+ program.“It’s an example of a material improvement that they made to Groupon that makes it so much easier for the customer to use.”"
Alright this stock should go up nicely todsy
"WISH regularly stays at #1 for all shopping apps, beating out $AMZN, $EBAY, etc. and for overall ranking is consistently in the top 50 for $AAPL and the top 25 for Android. This is due largely to how Wish has positioned their app, concentrating on the browsing experience as opposed to the shopping experience. App users can open the Wish app, spend five minutes browsing for deals that might interest them, and go about their day. It feels more like a habit-building daily deals site, like $GRPN or Woot"
Manipulation is always there and sec knows that. It is in the name of option market
"Given its inability to get out of the doldrums, perhaps getting acquired is not such a bad proposition? Any opinions on this?"
"Buyout will probably come after earnings report, which should be good. Mergers, unlike individual stock Pickens, are not based on a specific price, but are developed over a period of discussions and negotiations. I think the buyout will come, regardless of the earnings report. Plus, a positive earnings report allows a board to better convince their shareholders that a deal is good for them. Look for buyout after earnings report."
$25 today. Enjoy your margin calls shorts hahahahaha
Alibaba take over in next 6 months??? More reasons for yea than nah!
When GRPN has a good quarter with a strong move up on day one. It seems to trend up aggressively for 10 to 15 days. Then subject to pull back. Check out historical price action to see what happens.
"Management would like an LBO. Shareholders would like a buyout.With all the cheap money sloshing about, you'd think this would be a layup.Problem is this isn't a coveted enterprise or it would have been snapped up already.Longs stay long and Shorts stay short. Let Mr. Market decide the end to this story..."
"The company is not for sale, a trade for a license agreement between I.B.M that lowered amount on what they owed and back up around the $4.00 and above until they report. Tariffs are still not full blown that would affect the markets."
Look at the downside volume great selling as usual. Going higher
Large premarket trade of 676K shares...interesting.
WHEN does this hit zero?
Who bought puts? Should pay off handsomely tomorrow
"You can thumbs down all you want, but reality is Buyout or YoYo stock with nothing to show .30 Big DEAL that will disappear, multi year holding and feed up. BABA $$$"
Back to $2 soon
Very cheap at this levels https://cweb.com/groupon-still-the-king-of-daily-deals/
"1. Marketplace for the experience economy.2. As local businesses reopen after Covid and protests, the Groupon marketing channel becomes more essential than ever.3. Balance sheet is solid.4. Platform and assets are valuable despite years of underperformance.5. New company leadership.6. Significant insider buying off the lows.7. Think about who uses Groupon - millennials. Same people who are blowing up short positions across Robinhood.8. PPS is ""cheap"" - inexperienced investors tend to buy more of a company when the PPS is low (vs. looking at EV, or even market cap), it's just market psychology. 9. Technicals showing a clear breakout. 10. Huge gap from $2.02 to $2.83, once it enters that gap, it will fill. There are prop desks that do only this."
"They have to keep cutting the fat for this to have a chance, way to many employees."
Brick wall at 5
"Has anyone else noticed that SWBI does not have a Yahoo message board?? Very odd. Every stock seems to have a board, even very obscure OTC stocks trading for a few pennies? My first thought was anti-gun bias by Yahoo, but no, all the other gun companies like Ruger, do have a board... Odd..."
Covered at open. Fun ride.
What will happen when she drops below $1? It the stock then delisted and worthless?
"Collapsing more right here. Bad ER, bad future, bad company with no path to profitability. Company was on wrong track before the virus hit. No reason for this to go up today."
did the call start
JOHN and J going to get taught a lesson this week
"Report other than the .01 miss on EPS is pretty darn good. Cash and cash equivalents improved. Customer growth expanded. FCF is excellent, so is EBITDA."
So that means every 20 shares is now 1
Easy short.
I Repeat GRPN needs to be bought out. It has a much brighter future as art of facebook or baba or some other platform with explosive member growth. There is a lot of brand value here hope they don't let it go to waste. Current management team has got to be seeing this. Anybody else agree ?
"Celebrating today by buying a groupon to a local restaurant, and a contribution to Qtr 2"
My email just sent to ir@groupon concerning the R/S
"Groupon stock price history is provided at the adjusted bases, taking into account all of the recent filings. As of today, the current price of Groupon is 25.77 , as last reported on the 9th of August, with the highest price reaching 26.45 and the lowest price hitting 21.33 during the day. Groupon is out of control given 3 months investment horizon. Groupon holds Efficiency (Sharpe) Ratio of 0.13, which attests that the entity had 0.13% of return per unit of risk over the last 3 months. Our standpoint towards determining the volatility of a stock is to use Groupon market data together with company specific technical indicators. We were able to interpolate data for twenty-one different technical indicators, which can help you to evaluate if expected returns of 16.72% are justified by taking the suggested risk. Use Groupon Market Risk Adjusted Performance of (0.37), risk adjusted performance of 0.2168, and Downside Deviation of 6.17 to evaluate company specific risk that cannot be diversified away."
"Groupon is a powerful brand and a great value proposition for consumers and vendors. Yes, the company has problems, poor management, bad user experience, etc but it is still a company that will get better over time especially if a great management team gets put in place. Needs an activist investor!!"
Groupon is selling for 25.77 as of the 8th of August 2020. This is a 56.66 percent increase since the beginning of the trading day. The stock's open price was 16.45. Groupon has about a 43 percent probability of financial distress in the next few years of operation and did not have a very good performance during the last 30 trading days. Equity ratings for Groupon are calculated daily based on our scoring framework. The performance scores are derived for the period starting the 10th of May 2020 and ending today.
GOOD NEWS FROM GROUPON. ONLINE WILL BE HUGE FOR REVENUE. BUY BUY BUY https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/live-blog/coronavirus-updates-live-americans-fly-home-europe-intensifies-lockdown-n1159296/ncrd1159761#liveBlogHeader
"First of all... a reverse stock always ends in disaster. They use this company as their personal bank by decieveing the truth to Shareholders. Finally, the last 5 years all that is done is take money, load up on stock options and continue to replace board of directors with new ones. VOTE NO TO REVERSE and freeze company assets with a Class Action lawsuit."
"Where does all this speculation come from? Too many speak with ""authority""-let's see some ""credentials"". This can be so tiresome."
Going to short this in a few minutes with 1000 shares. I suspect a downturn when the ER comes out. E*Trade not even saying it's hard to find shares. -$3.00 EPS vs .60 last year. And who was going out to dinner 1st Qtr 2020?
I asked Jesus about Groupon buying Yelp. He's crunching the numbers and will get back to me.
"Looks like i missed alot over my long weekend..IBM settled, earning Aug 3...lets go groupon!!"
"Just bought 16000 shares. I think last weeks slide was end of year,selling to balance profit /loss for tax purposes."
"I think I know why GRPN had a whooping 1 for 20 split, the company knew its earnings were not going to be good, and it would become a PENNY stock again. This stock is a disgrace, it is already down 25%. Are the officers still drawing the same salary, or was it divided by 20. What a SCAM."
Brad and his alter ego .01 must be at the shrinks today..upping their dosage!!
Where is the hype in the chat????
Obviously quarterly earnings were leaked.....this is not going to be good.
Oh JOHN 
John/Hari tell you it’s going to 10.....
Disappointing performance
Is there a Groupon on these shares today?
Stephen and Fer twins separated at birth??
"The Co-founder and Independent Director Eric P. Lefkofsky purchased 250,000 shares on June 15, 2020 at an adjusted price of $21.57 per share and a value of over $5.39 million dollars. Leonsis Theodore, Director, bought almost a million worth of shares on April 20, 2020. Founders, executives, and directors are under no obligation to buy shares with their own money so when they do, you should pay attention. They have an intimate knowledge of what's going on behind the scenes, so when they start spending their own money on shares, breaking news is coming...it's just a matter of when. Insider transactions are up 300% for a reason, so Short sellers beware.Analysts, even as a result of the pandemic, estimate GRPN's EPS next year to be 92.7%. Why you may ask? Analysts know that customer acquisition will be big business as the economy reopens and getting customers in the door is Groupon's specialty. Groupon looks like an ugly duckling now, but post-pandemic, it will grow into a swan without the need to merge or be acquired. Gross Margins are still over 53% and analysts' average price target is still $24.40 per share. I can't tell you whether breaking news comes out tomorrow, next week, or next month, but I'd be willing to wager it's coming sooner rather than later."
should I buy this stock?
Where is Bellamaxi???? He/She was scurrying so hard to paint this sugar-coated feces yesterday after earnings release and today has vanished. What gives???
3/27/17Citigroup Initiates Groupon (GRPN) Buy $5.00
Your shrink said it would only be $1.17 to up your Meds!!
every single news and update from this company is a lawsuit. Jesus
"I am a shareholder and also a customer. Recently I bought a local deal and realized that an appointment was needed and when I called, the appointment was booked out further out. Cancellation was a breeze compared to one of the other deal company. Also, the merchant couldn't handle the redemption it seems which means demand was strong. GLTA."
nice!
Earnings missed!
forget any further movement today except down but do not sell. This rumor was put out to strike up a conversation that Groupon could be an excellent takeover or merger and thats it. Not a bad strategy by the investors but for now they are accumulating. My measely holding is not going in their hands
To the Gimps! Whoop! There it is!!! 2.58
"What a day it has been.... Automated sell off triggered based on the hoax news which helped to create sell-off momentum for SHORTIES, And off course.. retailers gets afraid and sold"
Wow. Nice to see GRPN going up.
Another red day. Thanks bagholders. What's cheap becomes cheaper...
Google shall buy Groupon at $80 dollar and it is still cheap.
And we're off!!
"As suspected the COB Lefkofsky sold another 1.5M shares this past week. 750K on 3-7 and another 750K on 3-8. The form 4 filings were released late afternoon yesterday, typical for GRPN. The CAO - Stevens also sold shares 15K. At least Williams and Randolfi have held...for the time being. If they start selling I encourage all of you to run as fast as you can from this stock.I have been following this stock a long time and I don’t recall any officer or board member buy any shares on the open market. Those who lead this company look at the stock as their personal ATM. Just once I would like to see one of them put their money where their mouth is."
smart buying? steady accumulation? why tip your hand now by paying asking price? ANYWAY U L00K AT IT SELLING DRYING UP IN THIS ST0CK
"Grpn is the take over target not yelp. Groupon would be the best acquisition for a shopping center Reit or a major retailer, Not a yelp possibly IAC"
"Wow, this is nuts. Are they pricing in BK?"
Groupon will appeal the jury verdict. Read the CNET report. IBM was 100 percent overreaching and the jury didn't really understand the facts.
Large short seller at $3.00 into earnings. They have beat 50% of the time. If they beat there will be a gap open in the AM on short covering.
Only going up from here. Over $3 tomorrow and hold this time.
FER...see you over 5!!!
"Lesson taught, but students failed to learn. Value doesn't equal price. Management matters.E-coupons are from 2012.Listen to successful traders,not pumpers on a message board"
Time to short!!!!
GROUPON NEEDS NEW ADVERTISING!!!Change your ads to be more beneficial to your users. SELL THE BENEFITS. Offer a promotion that gets current customers to show their friends how it saves them time and money. 100% stop your current ads... THEY DON'T WORK.PLEASE STOP WASTING SHAREHOLDERS MONEY.
"Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) Rating ReaffirmedThe broker has just set a target of $6.3 on Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) shares. This is 13.31 % from the last stock close price. In analysts report issued to clients and investors on 2 November, B.Riley FBR kept their Buy rating on shares of GRPN."
"This will go to 12 just on pot sales, CBD anyway"
"One of the Best Position company for rebound.Groupon already announced that will continue with shopping deals and know with the Economy coming back. Institutional Investors and Company Insiders are Buying also. All indications are positive. Comparing to online retailers like $EBAY , $SHOP , $ETSY , $BABA Groupon is way way cheaper. Strong Buy!"
"nice how the deleted my whole message. But they still allow BS posts with people advertising junk websites.But my post on Groupon, no they take it down. Good job yahoo!"
"FER, I read your earlier post about selling at $4.91. What motivated you to sell especially with your prior posts touting the stock and company? In fact I recall there was a post saying that $9 was your target exit price. I am not being critical just trying to understand / learn why the change. Thanks."
Will be interesting to see if grpn stock's price can imitate interest rates and go zero or negative.
Are they really going to vote on the reverse split on June 9 or somebody just talking non sense. Because I’ll probably sell if it does
"6 billion 2010, wish is 228$ per share today"
"Don't see this not tanking on earnings with how PINS, EBAY, Etsy have all done."
I expect GRPN to hold up well as many investors flee tariff related securities.
Groupon’s bad managements will catch up eventuallyTranslate this link in french:https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/entreprises/201906/05/01-5228984-groupon-ne-repond-plus.php
I love all of the excitement created for Groupon the New Darling of WALL STREET.
"I guess Wall Street discovered today that Groupon is not dead. LOL. Been widely known here for a while, but people kept shorting and hoping for a complete disappearance. She's gonna live boys - she bounced on a small earnings miss and is actually up large on bad news. And, the math here - still over $1.5 billion in sales and half a billion in cash on hand, yet valuation not even $2 billion. Sometimes Wall Street can be irrationally negative. I am actually in the black on this dud. Not blacker because my clients said they'd kill me if I bought more when GRPN was testing the high 2's about 6 weeks ago; they were right in that there are better opportunities. I expected a comeback, but not this much this fast. A drink for all the longs today. As for the shorts....there was a ride from the 20's to here, but how much lower do you really think this is going? She's off life support and will live and thrive. Even Costco using. Unfortunately the tone of financial press articles still implies that companies using GRPN are in trouble; that's not true anymore and hopefully the Costco deal will help change that perception."
Grpn gapping up strong buyWill soon be new 52 week lowIn a month will be 4 plus range. Stock will push even higher
Barry the Ferry is back just in time for some comedy!! His crystal ball says bankruptcy too!!
"If I were a company considering buying Groupon, this drop would seem like the perfect opportunity to get it cheap."
"Groupon to reverse-split sharesJun. 10, 2020 9:06 AM ETGroupon, Inc. (GRPN)By: Stephen Alpher, SA News Editor The company board last night approved a 1:20 reverse stock split. It's to become effective at 5 PM ET today. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) closed at $1.60 last night - more than tripling from the March low, but still down 55% Y/Y."
"Should be a good start to the day with a bit of positive news from Morgan Stanley. Market looks to be a bit choppy but internet companies, just like the end of last week, look to open up positive."
"I bought some today, this company taking away its debt have about 1.49 dollars cash so at this price your just paying .15 cent a share for the company value"
Sold mine yesterday's chunk today at 1.45. Will get in again soon!
"WOW, crazy trading day, glad I held!!!"
"just our luck market tanks, close to 4th qtr earnings....such bull"
time for this to shine
Big announcement coming after lunch
The .20 cent drop erased after hours.......feeling good about tomorrow!!
"Josh, good call on getting out last week. Hopefully you were able to sell before today's 4% drop. Whatever you are seeing as a merchant, certain investors are aligned with your concerns. GRPN senior management is in a coma and refuses to create shareholder value."
"This board is useless, thanks to the bickering. No facts, no info."
"Cramer just said buy, going to 5, says business is better than most people realize"
"and the point I made yesterday is obviously a salient one.....earnings sucked, but who in their right mind was surprised? Market reacts to surprises."
Brad joined the circus
"Last thing of the day. With the stock sub $5, most of mutual funds, retirement plans, hedgefunds could NOT purchase GRPN. Now they can. What happens is that groupon is building a foundation of solid investors that hold shares for the long time. No more share flippers. Again, this is what a reverse split should be about, unfortunately many companies do not have the financial stability and CASHFLOW that Groupon has, so they fail. On the other hand Groupon is and will be succeeding."
Great sales this am
"Short it into the bell, short into oblivian.... should have been shorting last week at 35"
660M in cash and 450M market cap. This is looking really cheap.
"Zacks Investment Research,InvestorPlace•July 19, 2018Chicago, IL-based Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is expected to report second-quarter 2018 results on Aug 1. Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of +74.20% and sports a Zacks Rank #1."
I just don't see any good food deals in my area of Los Angeles anymore. They need to be merge with yelp.
"Ouch... Seems someone know some positive in call, Already accumulatig... Still wait till call though I would be bit late!"
LOL load up on the dip...its a new dip each week......
Stock is performing fairly well today albeit with very light volume. Maybe this is a sign of things to come.
"consolidation, see you above 6.20 soon"
What a surprise GRPN closed on the moving average now what?
I bought 200 July $2 calls!
Gap closes at $3.54 almost there.
jack ma and repurchase program on my side...js
Smart investors would not sell at current price
Are the shorts done covering yet?
The Vultures are circling.

Congratulations 
I finally ended up buying some at 1.40 and the lawsuit news drops an hour later and already lost 10c... this is fun.
"OMG - I looked at something on Groupon and have bought many things through Groupon - but this time I decided I wasn't interested, and they are now STALKING ME - trying to get me to buy what I left in my cart.I had NO IDEA Groupon was stalking me - tracking what I looked at, and was going to try to force me to buy what I didn't want. I'm DONE with Groupon."
Brad said this was going to 1 what a muppet! Where’s your champagne and fireworks now you little stoner?
Perfect stock for insiders and major shareholders. Manipulation.....
cramer was right when stock was at $3.5. he said it was going to $5. I don't like Cramer in general but I think he's right...
"Green Media sold 1.5mil shares at $3.80-3.82 on last move down. Still long 34mil on disclosure. Gotta pay for that condo downpayment and a boat slip, I reckon..."
12.5M shares traded as of 2:53 PM EST. 20M is in sight!
Bingo! Today Grpn jump up to $3.5 soon
Got in this @ $2.3256 and have not looked back. Very nice solid gains. GL to all longs.
I'm here and watching for the turnaround.
"300 million share buyback?? what a joke they are obviously not buying back , which probably means they sold the co. for alot less than expected my guess 5.30"
You should have Bought the Dip
Groupon is down 9.78% to 52.31
"I can hardly wait for earnings! remember that they had to refund all the cancellations! not to mention charge backs, legal fees, etc!"
At this rate we will be under $4.00 before the end of the week. Nice job by the board
Maybe GRPN could make a market in and accept Bitcoin. Wow.
Where are all my chart readers?
"Comcast invested over 200 million dollars in GRPN more than Alibaba. Shorts need to be careful to short GRPN this low. If Comcast announces to buy GRPN, GRPN will go double over $6 easily!!!"
@Guillermo Etsy is a terrible comparison. They are not even close to comparable.Etsy Revenue:1.73BEsty Earnings: 349.25MGRPN Revenue: 1.42BGRPM Earnings: -287.93M I hear a pump.
10% in one day on the short side. Thanks bagholders !!
Brad thinks it's time for J to check into rehab
I don’t see GRPN surviving this correction. It is doomed to fail.
GRPN is a profitable company now and the bottom has been already formed. No way this could go south further. Why sell?
"Guillermo thought Q1 was the biggest danger. Lots on unknowns (NO CEO, NO ER conference calls, NO Groupon events...) and actually results are BETTER than expected. Emergency is over, free to go over $30 this week. Let's remember $30 is just $1.50 so the stock is still totally UNDERVALUED.Tomorrow will be a bloodbath...for people who started short positions. Sorry guys, this is NOT the typical reverse split.A new CEO is going to be announced very soon...Guillermo price target for 2020 is $100."
"Zack's articles is the last bad news , groupon would began to go up."
I didn't know GRPN has a lot of potential to grow if the mgt doing their Job good. I hope they will find a competent new CEO that make the company grow big. I think this is a good long term investment. Will add more tomorrow.
I not buy .
picking up steam let's go!!
Trading arround moving avergaes is a joke look at GRPN and all the amatures and fast money idoiots who have no clue about the stock want to trade it. Best of luck. This stock was 5.20 after the the most recent qtr
Is it a good time to enter at this price .
Congrats to all who are long. Hope GRPN can hold the gains through the close. Remember there have been big run ups preceding prior earnings releases and just before the close the bottom drops out. Hopefully this quarter will be different.
"Like Eric Cartman said, “You got Poned”"
3.15 today
"If the 10 day DMA can stay and close above the 50 DMA it will be great, the cup has formed from $5.94 to $5.99 followed by the handle that's taking shape to go higher up to new 52- week $$$$$."
I hate Roller Coaster.... too much manipulations....holding this since the IPO day..
SO NO GREAT INPUTS O N THIS BIG DROP TODAY ??
$GRPN With the new CEO and going back to shopping with a huge quarterly sales we will surpass $ETSY Groupon has a lot more VALUE then ETSY and more cash on Hand. ETSY is Over $40. BUY BUY BUY!!!!!
Just SHORTED AT $55.22. Ridiculous up 27%. for why ?? hahaha
"I bought back at much lower price, I believe management did massive buybacks at 48c, I also believe that the brutal firing of rich Williams and the coo will have huge implications on the betterment of margins and ratios under the right management.We are expecting a severe recession where people and businesses will pursue an equilibrium of price vs discounts,Williams was a nightmare of a CEO and his departure was long overdue,The price currently at 1.28 is a bargain and I believe alibaba will either accumulate to to the top or acquire Groupon as whole,Glta."
Crystal ball says 4Q earnings is as bad as the company.
"The issue is the head and shoulders that is forming in my opinion and so technicians are watching to see if it falls from here and brakes below the neck line… Looks to me to be purely technical and if it reverses and had tire from here, buyers will come in in my opinion… Look at the three month chart"
Short interest increased by 19% to just over 43M shares. This represents approximately 8% of the total float. I'm surprised by the increase and the stock performance over the past couple of weeks. If GRPN can announce some notable news there would be a good squeeze in the making.
huge volume today.. almost touching the avg. volume already..!!
"Patience, plenty of time for the collapse. I NEVER sell AH for any loss, never."
"keep going, keep going !!"
"The more you read the ER, the worse it looks...."
GRPN reached an all time low at 1.65
Don't let the IBM verdict good or bad get you to sell your shares. That may be the presipise to selling the company once it settles there is no overhang and perhaps the path to making a deal.
Oh J 
Wonder why people running this company cannot seem to care for any move. For example try and sell the company. Steer company into new direction. Or anything that breaks the long ongoing to nowhere. Does this company have anyone that cares abou it. What a pity pos for the shareholders.
"End Of Day, i think it's below 2.90 and more selling again tomorrow."
"Yes after-hours may give up some, but again Guillermo isreally optimistic. Best reverse split ever.In the end the balance sheet is rock solid..."
Congratulations to all longs who held or averaged down and loaded up.
4.96 was the high during market hours after they announced they were shopping themselves. Huge volume day no substantial option activity getting interesting for sure. Giddy up.
Clearly if GRPN is to survive and blossom they must continue to innovate through new services and meaningful partnerships rapidly. They have brought some heavy hitters on board so what exactly are they doing to improve and expand the business. There have been no partners announced since Grub and we don't know whether Grub is adding any meaningful revenues.
"quite a bit of complaining going on, YTD the S&P up 8.23%, Groupon up 24%, , whose fault you didn't get in at a better price, Management?"
Those oct $4.50 Calls got crushed. Good for the seller...
"Steady decline in grpn valuations ,ratios are terrible and top line growth has never been displayed,Williams is by far the worst CEO on Wall street"
Weird day for GRPN low volume 4%....Ok
who is buying before earnings. . $2 stock soon.. load up
I bought on the dip
"MMMM!!!!!!, The Interim CEO, CFO and investor relations team will be available for follow-up calls with investors and analysts after the first quarter financial results have been disclosed."
Looks like it is setting up to go much lower
NICE!!!!!
"Close at 3,30! Why? Always the same at ws, they making money with fear and when all sold cheap, value come back."
Brad the Puffer..has no money to buy!!
Check my all the posts.. Making around .10 cents per share every day!
still lower...
I have a question: isn’t this stock currently trading lower than it’s cash on hand. Using Yahoo’s Data they have 380 million in cash and 276 million market cap. Wouldn’t that infer that risk is limited?
Poor JOHN and J thought it was going to continue to go up here come the 2's
this co already has a buyer and they are stealing shares
"2.99! Praise Jesus! The Gimp boys, Brad, Barry, and .01 should’ve bought at 2.35!"
GRPN reached an all time low at 0.66
Our favorite basher is off his meds again he deleted all his posts...lmao
"Who shorted this morning? Where are the geniuses, Guillermo wants to congratulate them. It must be Brad. Oh sorry Guillermo forgot he's on mute.Let's be constructive and talk about how long to break $35, how long to break $50, how long to get to $80?Buy call contracts, make lots of cash."
"Making more money on same revenue, a good sign."
Bought a facial for $60 dollars based on $100 dollars value today. Looking to pamper myself this afternoon. Cheers.
Revenues below $550m. Watch out below..
China tariff is hurting groupon
This is getting brutal and I don't think it's shorting
Buy buy what i can say
Interesting how John and Hari have the exact same choice of words when posting.....
Hope good will those 2nd Quarter #s be??? HAHHAHAHAHAHAHHA....their sales force is working hard - OOOOOPS - that's right - they fired the sales force.
"As much as I would LOVE for GRPN to be ""the next Reddit stock,"" the market cap is currently under $1B, and WallStreetbets has a ""rule"" about not posting companies under $1B. So, everyone start buying some shares and get that cap up -- LOL! Good luck, longs."
An interesting take: https://techstockobserver.com/groupon-inc-common-stock-nasdaqgrpn-did-okay-in-q3-but-so-what/

Wonder how much money the shorts have lost on this board... Brad? Barry? Care to share?
Nobody looking at April calls volume? Monster volume....
it's going in the wrong direction!!!!
J’s after funeral party at John house Who’s going?
"E-commerce was a bright spot for Walmart, with sales growing more than 40% in the quarter.“We feel good about the direction of the business and remain confident in our ability to grow sales by about 40% for the full year,” CFO Brett Biggs said."
Whenb does this go to a dollar???
Messed up stock. Wonder who controls price....MS
Ultimate is up... Tons of cash in hand... Restructuring is done...things are shaping that poor Analyst can't see!!
We will see who is buying this in the coming weeks.. company is slimming down for a buyer
Part of me wants to buy back into this..
Shares should get a boost from the broader market today. Not sure if there will be some rotation out of tech to jump on the industrial momentum. Latest short interest will be released after the close. This report will be the last until earnings. There is another update after the market closes on May 9th.
"Tinyprofit, agree with your comments. This has been my sentiment for at least 12-18 months. It seems like Williams can't operate on multiple fronts. He has done a great job of streamlining the business by exiting underperforming and focusing on bottom line performance. He has not performed as well on the partnership/ marketing side. Sure there has been the Living Social acquisition, ParkWhiz and GrubHub. The Groupon+ product presents a real opportunity. Quite a bit of yesterdays call focused on the international market. It seems like deja vu all over again. I would like to know what the new COO is bringing to the table since he is also now leading product development. Again, your comments are spot on. The BOD should be more active however the guy leading the charge is the same guy that took this company public, said no to Google and offered zero direction when he s the CEO. And oh BTW he is the largest GRPN shareholder. Thanks for your comments."
Bullish. Strong Buy https://cweb.com/2018/05/02/cweb-groupon-acquires-cloud-savings-company-ltd/
"Stock is bid up right now, but I don't see any ER yet...."
"Has GRPN officially announced earnings call? If so, when is the next earnings release?"
JOHN celebrating 3.14. Now that's just sad
"Huge volume, huge move up. This is just the beginning. In the next 60 days1) Q1 earnings will be STRONG thanks to the covid online shopping2) new CEO will be announced. And that will be a huge name. Someone mentioned Mark Cuban's name.3) Q2 earnings Each of those will be 20-30% moves, so we might see $5 before September.Guillermo Puertas, world known billionaire."
Quite a conundrum. Cautious but optimistic. Headwinds from an expense standpoint in the short term.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-traders-betting-big-move-135001500.htmlAre Options Traders Betting on a Big Move in Groupon (GRPN) Stock?
"Really stupid to think that it does not rise. Good advertising, good offers and more customers. Super bowl advertising will be clearly reflected when earnings are published. On Friday we are at least 25 percent higher."
"People seem to be forgetting that the superbowl commercial which was 6th best commercial, just happened two weeks ago, I owned a stock siriusxm and the company once they got their act together they were notorious for lowballing outlook and then getting a beat every quarter"
Where are all my negative Nellie's.
Happy Thanksgiving to all!! Including puffer!!
"It seems as if Groupon is sinking in a sea of lawsuits, no viable business model, corrupt c-suite executives, self serving chairman and 16 quarters of loses,Groupon is gone."
Board has gotten quiet again. Kind of like the stock. What are the predictions for today? The options event expires tomorrow.
"Why do so many post so little relevant information? This pandemic is unprecedented so how can any surmise anything. I have been seeing more Groupon offers popping up on my iPhone and they’re not about “experience” related deals,"
30% up!! buckle up!!
"Conference call just completed. No surprises. It will be interesting to see how the analysts react over the next week or so. Stock price volatility is somewhat muted. Volume is strong. Not sure what GRPN will close at today. My consensus is there is progress being made on a number of fronts. Customer growth, FCF, EBITDA and gross profit. Lots of runway for Groupon +."
Bad news coming..
"Price will reset soon. Yesterday carvana sky rocketed, with same speed it's coming down today."
This is better than some NFL games I have seen.
".48 cents is the 52 week low in poopon. Hit .71 low today, still 32% off low. Expect a small bounce after 6 down days."
I’m not worried it’s a loss it will go back down. You will see
TIMBER!!!!!
Seriously? can't even go up at least thru the morning
I wrote investor relations and got a bs form letter response
Guillermo tells you it’s going to 500LOL!!!!!!!!!
"Remember banks and institutions can now buy GRPN because above $5. They are just building the foundation of the ""new stock"". The pullback will attract even more.Then the new CEO will be announced together with the earnings results. Call me crazy but I believe the stock will move towards $100 ($5 before RS) this year.Guilllermo"
GRPN reached a new 52 Week Low at $3.53
GRPN trending on scanners on green side !!!
"Here is an example of letter to send to investor relationshipAs a long time investor in Groupon I am asking Mr. Williams to resign immediately. He has been a terrible CEO, he has followed missteps over missteps, made mistakes everywhere. Terrible strategy, terrible execution. One also would wonder if Mr. Williams' actions may be indeed criminal with the intent of taking the company private or selling to competition at an under market price.Again, Mr. Rich Williams must resign IMMEDIATELY or be fired by the board of directors.Will report Mr. Rich Williams to the SEC for failure to respect the code of ethics. We will also contact other investors to sue the CEO and some of the board members.Sincerely F.M.------------------Let's get this behind us stop the nightmare and get the stock back to $3 in few weeks. Absolutely DOABLE. GLTA"
Added 4.70  you
Guess Monday's open??? I say $5.75
Looks like a OSTK run beginning
"The overall markets are in for more choppy days .... Has the bleeding stopped for Groupon+ yet .... I believe not for the next 9- months based on the report Williams gave .... my Humble prediction here some may not like, but if your not up to it; then I suggest you get out. The possibility of hitting $ 3.75 - $ 3.80 can be surreal, then I suggest you load up for the next wave up, I am still in and long here. Groupon needs to start thinking out of the box with new ideas, instead of making this their personal A.T.M in order to keep investors on board; as well as, bringing more large investors."
This stock opened at 2.90 the other day which was strange and the has done nothing but go up ever since. Short covering or new buyers seeing value at these prices?
Brads chart says 2dollars!!
buy AH 800000 shares 4.49
Overeaction!
Seems to be a serious leak in the plumbing on this stock …. how could that be?
"GRPN up 64% last 3 months, 30% this month. Congrats to all other longs who have kept faith and made money here. I’ve taken half of the table as it hit my target of $38 but will monitor closely"
"I just redownloaded the Groupon app, still great deals like I remembered in the past. When I upgraded my phone, I don’t know why I didn’t redownload the app."
Grpn continues to drop but J and JOHN delighted with their positions
Christopher. A green close??LOL!!!!!!
I owned 70 shares then thay did this reverse thing and STOLE 67 shares. That in turn STOLE money from people . i now have 3 shares left ... And in the negative by alot .. I can see if I was negative and still had 70 shares . that is how it works .. BUT taking what a person owns like that is ILLEGAL for STEALING .. And if its allowed to do this then a company doing this SHOULD CRASH AN BURN
Should be support right here
What happened to know it all Jack?Fer do you know?
Why haven't Groupon tried on-line bulk items as another means of sales?
Plus 30k of the Octobers 4.50 calls but those had 21k open interest. So tomorrow we will know the change of the open interest.
Let me guess what's going to happen. GRPN is going to come out with pretty good earnings. Stock price will go up to $5 in a week. Then it will slowly go down for 2 months until it reaches $3 again. Sound right?
Brad at the shrinks office today..getting pumped up!!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/options-market-predicting-spike-groupon-134801085.html
Happy New Year!
WOW.. what a move and what a volume... go GRPN..!!
Only 5% down despite the big market sell off yesterday. The bleeding is stopping signaling the bottom. I think this is a good dead cat bounce play right now. GLTA!
"bought 30k yesterday at $5,16 , , , , i feel weeeee taw dud right now"
No after earnings conference call???? How can that possibly be a good thing???
5/10/18UBS Upgrades Groupon (GRPN) Sell ➝ Neutral
Short ratio has gone down to less than 1%. Think most bears switched position and went long. :-) The price action inks the upgrade target price of $38. Great consolidation the past few days. We are ready to take off from here.
Total short interest as of 12-29 is 41.3M shares. Up slightly by 600K shares.
Do we have a major sell program tomorrow ?
Sell now
J you happy about the decline in price?

Oh boy..guess premarket did not matter woohoo
Move down was on higher volume which worries me....Insiders with knowledge may be selling on news that hasn't hit the public yet? not sure wt heck is going on? Still holding my core position
I’m laughing right now!
The company is not buying back shares.. price is too high for them!!
This volume is a record for stock market and GRPN.
Hari told you this would go to $10
Isn’t there a reverse split?
For those if you who are interested..... Short interest increased by 8% to 34.9M shares. Some of you could care less. Keep living in your walled garden of delusions.
One super hacker has been manipulating GRPN stock price since approximately early of 2015 till present because he has been stalking one girl and wouldn't wish her to make money.
"""IBM invests nearly $6 billion annually in research and development, producing innovations for society,"" GRPN got part of that t for $83 Million. That's a great deal! LOL"
Grpn is time to bump back up to $4.23 started tomorrow

Clive what were you saying about you’re “gains”LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
anybody following or getting included in the stockholder lawsuits??
Yes they did - helps to own a stock that has been lagging past month on a day like today. Two more legs to this market maybe Grpn can get a leg up on the next move.
Morgan Stanley gave a price increase from $4.30 to $4.40 a share. Wow they are really going out in a limb there!

I heard this is going to $40 soon?Cant believed they'd have another reverse splitso soon after the last one! LOLShort at will.
"By the way, this general stock market pullback is just technical. After rising 10% needed a 5% pullback. Funny how sites like CNBC says it's due to the second covid wave. While again it is pure technical. There might be a second wave but1) there will be a vaccine2) might be as mild as a regular cold (as it is proving to be now in Europe where people are virtually not dying anymore).3) businesses are hiring back HUGELY because in the worst case scenario a 5c mask will protect you in 99.99$ of the cases."

If sold at 60 it would be fraud to all long term share holders.. shorts are rewarded more than longs.. no ceo.. no big 4th qtr. Revenue..
COVER COVER COVER and begone. Goodbye. Feel free to contact Guillermo for free advice. GRPN under $40 is a steal...

What’s going on with this stock? Anybody?
"Most of the analysts have Groupon as a hold or sell. 5 buy/strong buy 8 hold and 5 underperform. The price targets are also behind the curve. There is a lot of room for upgrades and price target hikes. If you are an analyst and have this at an ""underperform"" and it's up over 50% year to date you start to look like you don't know what you are doing, so as the price rises these guys who are behind the curve will change their view. Very few analysts put buy ratings and up price targets when stocks are at 52 week lows and the opposite applies to stocks at 52 week highs"
Going up a bit
J here come the 2's. You still madly in love with it ?

"- When all the Restaurants , Concerts and Travel was canceled , postponed or shut down ; Groupon REFUSED to honor it's "" EXTRAORDINARY Event Policy "" which clearly stated , that the refund would be issued BACK to the original form of payment.

"Groupon Inc. (GRPN) released quarterly earnings of $-1.63 per share, uplifting the Wall St consensus estimate of $-1.91 per share. This Q2 report means an earnings surprise of 14.66%. Company's revenue was $0.00 versus $188.0 million predicted by analysts.In comparison, the EPS for the same quarter last year was $0.20, so posted EPS is a drop of -915%. Looking at turnover, figures sank a -35.31% compared to $578.4M same quarter 12 months ago.Groupon releases Q3 earnings report next November. Market estimates an Earnings per Share of $0.00, compared to previous quarter that made $-1.63. If you hold or you are considering buying Groupon shares, you must be careful as earnings reporting day usually has a higher than usual volatility, and price can jump up or down with exceptionally low liquidity and not respecting your buy/stop-loss orders. You can uncover more information about the earnings conference call and the earnings reports on the Investor Relations section of its website: http://www.groupon.com."

Oh JOHN
"Happy New Year....it looks like GRPN is trending similar to 2016 after a nice rise. Daily losses with average to above average volumes. The chart is turning more unfavorable with each trading day. As a long shareholder of this stock, I am getting very concerned. A 15% decrease in price in 3 weeks while the market is sizzling is worrisome.Williams and team need news, a solid quarter of earnings and strong guidance. Otherwise this stock is going to the 3's."
"Top Institutional Owners for both YELP and GRPN are as followsVanguard, Blackrock, State Street.Both reporting on Nov. 5th!I smell Buyout!!!"
"50,000 shares that is"
I have ordered many items from Groupon and had only a small handful of issues over the years. Customer Service is online chat only which can be annoying but I have requested a call from a supervisor who did call me within the hour and rectified the problem. What I do not understand is all the horrible customer reviews of Alibaba (BABA) company and the stock is trading at over $150.00 a share. Complete nonsense. Read all the customer reviews of the company. It's a disgrace.
Cup and handle pattern
"On this Pure Earnings play, only ONE thing made the difference between LOSING a few $k and GAINING likely $15k+. That one thing was/is: Patience.

Anyone buying?

deep puts
Nice puke. I'm sure some hedge fund just threw up his shares before month end as thier timing is always impeccable. Great volume going higher.
Well.......they beat on the Revenue number...... that's a positive....
"The EPS for upcoming qtr is 0.01 cent compared to 0.05 cent posted in most recent earnings. This is clearly why the stock trades slightly north of 4 bucks. They are going backwards instead of forward. What half-intelligent institutional investors will dive into this stock with crummy performance statistics? It's difficult to imagine that Williams will suddenly act differently to substantially grow the business and draw attention from the big boys. Many of us on this board have expressed a change in leadership. Personally, I believe Lefkovsky and his lack of business acuity is smothering the company from flourishing. Thoughts welcome."
Right direction! focusing on the bottom line while pursuing growth based on strong foundation of the EBITDA!
"I wonder why AliBaba holds 5.76% of GRPN shares? Are they planning to make a move and buy it? Someone is depressing GRPN share price for some reason, which seems like an acquisition is coming soon."
CEO will be stepping down... he has done nothing for the stock price since he took charge..
I feel that this could be a pivotal quarter that if i had to forecast is going to be pretty good and I think that is why Rich Williams has made the decision to sell to the right company
Millions of short shares waited to be covered. The real panic will happen.
release the numbers. .. or announce a deal... groupon will be on sale again! !
Not bad in my opinion. Beat revenue by 16 million even though missed earnings by 2 cents.
"Wow, I sold the last couple of shares in after hours yesterday. I didn’t think it would break $2.00 so fast. They always miss Q4 but I think the reverse split is what is killing them."
Sold my stake at 1.34....will be in soon!
Shorts are nervous!!
Great to see Barry as well. Just needed a negative day for the trolls to poke thier heads out of the woods. Great to have you all back!
AMC deal to kick in...
no worries Bob this stock will take off more plus buyouts will happen when is the question
"another 25,000,000 volume day"
beauty of today was the gap was filled on the downside good luck shorts
Well even adding $6 the stock is basically a buck considering the 1 for 20 reverse split. It might be worth more than $1 with that quarter and more like it to come.
JOHN you still treating yourself to vacations in beautiful Las Vegas?
#keepdreaming
4 dollars today
I will buy today's low and sell after hrs high!
Will make position tomorrow based on conference call!
My trading friend told me that Groupon is an easy $65 since last June.
Merger deal confirmed?
"GRPN shall re test $4.86 again as it did back in March 3rd. I added 20,000 shares at $4.60 in April with the total of 100,000 shares today that I own. I plan to hold on to Groupon until it reaches $20."
monopoly. SEC probe in sight for insider trading
Seeing Groupon selling wine right now no doubt great move!
"wow, another 4% haircut. Will it drop all the way to cash value?"
This year is the perfect set up!! Analysts will have lower numbers to beat! And Groupon will beat them every quarter!!
Didn't expect such a drop in the market today when there is hardly any negative news.
Good times coming

DNT and his government hate Jeff Bezos and would love Alibaba to come to town.Alibaba needs to clean up ALL FAKE MERCHANDISE and it can do 25 Billion Singles Day type sales here. GRPN is a gateway to legitimize Alibaba and their synergistic relationship can make all LONGS rich like Trump and Ma.
Why the conference call is tomorrow at 10.00am. Its quite unusual.
loads of volume ill take it ! anyone know why this is back at the 6 month high ?
Watch some big investor gonna swoop in and add a huge bundle of shares!! Its a new company going forward!! Anyone remember when alibaba came in!!

Poor Broke Brad...His shrink has no more advice for him!!
"All the volunteer work that the workers do, plus Groupons donations to causes is not helping this stock for investors. There needs to be immediate changes or resignations throughout the company. No one within the upper running the company has purchased share out right in years."
"Grubhub should really buyout Groupon and Yelp. Meituan, China's version of Groupon, Yelp, and Grubhub, just filed an IPO with an expected value of more than $60 billion USD. This perfectly shows that there is a lot of value combining these businesses together. Right now separately, Grub, Groupon, and Yelp have a combined total value of $16 billion in market cap. I believe when they merge together, with all the synergies and cross-selling opportunities that can drive revenue/user and total user growth, the new company (Groupon, Grub, and Yelp) will be valued at least $25 billion. See the difference? The value creation?"
Hari this is no bullish trend as you say. Put the bottle down man
$35 coming up....
Class Action Lawsuits are starting to be announced.
J why you not talking About charts and moving day averages anymore for ??? Cmon man give it to us!
Fer you were right
"it's so good to see PE number against GRPN. EPS turned positive and looking good now.. PE at 208, but by end of the year this number could easily be like 25-30 with current share price!!"
J its declines daily. But yet you tell the board it's a good stock?? Maybe time for new meds??
Who is doing all of the THUMBS DOWN on all longs posts. You are the Hillary Clinton of this board.You lost now die.
Rumor is heard that alibaba is interested in buying this. Hope it is sooner than later.
Interesting where and how GRPN serves the market.
Brad and .01....
"Good news ahead? “Activist investors seek change.. Another thought from frustrated stockholders is that the company buy back a lot of stock or should sell itself to another company which could better foster growth, according to the Journal.The company said Groupon CEO Richard Williams is ""actively engaged"" with investors, the Journal reported."
They pumped it up horrible I thought it would hold 1.20
2.8M shares traded hands yesterday. One of the lowest volume days in GRPN history. The lack of interest is concerning.
"good comeback for Groupon in first half hour, from low of 5.18 to now 5.29!!"

Not a bad close
"Losses are down next to zero, that makes it two consecutive promising quarters. Highly impressed by how they’re managing to bounce back up even in the pandemic"
"Fer is hurting himself,sigh"
up up and away pleaseeee !!
"Longs, we managed to re test $5 again since our super over blown earning. $5 is going to be the floor of the stock price this week. We are ready for $6 before November. I guarantee you. Mark my post and stay strong investing this."
"This stock had dropped INCREDIBLY at the end of December for no news. Except news leak that revenues were horrible. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. Fire the CEO and also investigate the board. This is ridiculous. And proposing a reverse split? That is just to take the price per share down. This is so they can either go private or sell the company for peanuts. Call your district attorney, call your senator, email the SEC, this CEO and the board must be investigated."
Its a clear buy given the trend. I expect it to be above $5 in coming weeks.
"Broke resistance this week and no resistance till $60. Chart looks stellar, lots cash on hand and vaccine news will only push this up. Bullish!"
Bollinger base at 4.86. Searching for buyers. Retracement to 5.00
"Volume is lighter today. The market is trading sideways. GRPN bounced off $5.02. Those long need to be cognizant of trading heading into the holiday weekend (markets closed 1-15). As I mentioned in earlier posts, GRPN needs a catalyst to move higher before earnings. Without any news the stock, just like today's overall market action, will trade sideways."
squeeze all the shorts!
This company is heading to the graveyard. If you have shares I encourage you to sell.
"wow 10 million shares already traded, someone has been using the market downturn to buy a lot of shares......."

Barry what happened to our dear John??
How is everyone doing today x
"Yahoo's headline says Groupon beat earning and turned profit, stock soars. Where is the soaring after it hit $5.49?"
I wouldn't waste your time with this one. hopped onboard yesterday when it was down 10% hoping it would recover. Just barely got out without taking a loss. there's so many other stocks out there to bet on. lost opportunity if you stay and drown in this stock.
There are some shorts that still think that it will go back to $3. Dream on. Next step $6 by end of this month.
"I think this is a fraud, ceo is a fraud. why would it go down on positive news unless ey"

Brad the Puffer has visions of $2....
"How is Q2 not going to be better than Q1 ?From report:'Throughout May, we saw sequential improvements in Local unit performance in both North America and International, as more cities reopened and reduced restrictions, which allowed merchants to begin to reopen their businesses. For example, in North America, Beauty & Wellness units increased 40%, albeit from a low level, in the second half of May vs. the first half May. This improvement was driven by trends in Florida, Texas, and California where restrictions have eased and we’re seeing customers purchase laser hair removal, botox, and hair treatment offerings. Overall, we are encouraged by trends like these that led to an 18% increase in North America Local units in May compared with April. In addition, May International Local units increased 30% versus April. June month-to-date consolidated Local units continue to improve sequentially compared with May.During the past few months, our Goods category has been a key asset, as consumer demand shifted to physical goods instead of local experiences. While we’ve seen strong year-over-year growth in Goods units globally during April and May, clearance and promotional activities drove lower unit economics, as we worked to sell through our owned inventory. These dynamics, together with a shift in category mix, unfavorably impacted Goods gross profit; that said, Goods gross profit sequentially improved in both April and May. In fact, Goods gross profit in April and May alone was greater than the total Goods gross profit we generated in the first quarter 2020. June month-to-date North America Goods unit growth remains steady compared with May, while International Goods unit growth has decelerated as consumer demand begins to shift to Local. Regarding cash flow trends during April and May, we generated free cash flow, which reflects both the positive impact of the cash preservation measures we took and the sequential improvements in operating performance. We ended May with $767 million in cash, including $200 million of borrowings under our revolver. We are also having ongoing discussions with our lenders under our revolving credit facility to obtain covenant relief. '"
"IMO, Shame on GRPN's management. Announcing ""they are putting the business up for sale"". If I recall at least two (2) weeks before earnings and then not having a suiter/buyer now two (2) weeks after their earnings release. What's next? Seems they really have no business to sell since IBM owns the patent that they have/had been using to conduct their business. Fortunately, I reduced my holdings by 95%. Limiting my losses and moved on. There are 100s of other stocks/companies to trade.GLTA"
Oh yeah grouponnnn. Keep holding. Forward PE of 18. PEG ratio under 1...GRPN making a comeback
why GRPN volume is very low recently ?
"$GRPN Groupon, Inc. (""Groupon"") (NasdaqGS: GRPN) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2026 (the ""notes"") in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""). Groupon also expects to grant the initial purchasers of the notes a 13-day option to purchase up to an additional $30,000,000 principal amount of notes.1y Target Est 42.70 before this large offering.."
Anybody have/seen the call?
JOHN how much more can you afford to lose?
When this thing breaks 20 it will free fall.
wow
Pump and Dump is happening. This happens to all Dog companies. Were you Pooop ed on?
Fer will be right about 1.77 too. This stock is toast
"@FER what do you think about the move from here, you have always been good with support"
any updates yet?! see 5.60 pre market..
"High Brand awareness, good Management, better Deals, more Customers, buyout looming, Will Not stop before Double digits, no Doubt."
"Let's hope they beat the earnings, and share something positive about this year."
gap closed at $2.54 ! lets hope we don't go much lower due to tax selling.
Then you probably own bitcoin because of its value. Good luck to all
It is too cheap...I want to pay $2.75
big block trades happening this is going green today
Remember Guillermo tells you it’s going to $500....
Hope the management did an aggressive share buyback when the price was below $0.50.
The board should start a gofund me page for Broke Brad so he could buy a couple shares I'll donate .007cents
Chance to buy low before 7AM
"I'm in the S.Fla. area, It was good to see Groupon had quite a few ""NEW""local ads today, from good restaurants to Miami Marlin tickets (no jokes please) and local services.""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" -Warren Buffett"
$GRPN Lets look at the price os $YELP and $ETSY . Groupon is way cheaper compare to them. Lot's of cash and great value.I saw ETSY going in one year from a $4 stock to $70 few days ago. Groupon needs just to engage a little more with PR on the great features and savings they offer to customers. BUY BUY BUY!Will not be surprise to see $10 very soon. To much value at a such a low price.
"FER, good analysis. I suspect GRPN might see a turnaround this week. Huge block buys came in again near Friday’s close. Similar action to previous weeks activity.A 5% move to the upside would ease the pain from last week"
We predicted lower than that and it happened Try and pay attention little one
"For the quarter, Groupon (ticker: GRPN) posted revenues of $612.3 million, down 23% from a year ago, and well below the Wall Street consensus of $709.4 million. Adjusted profits were 7 cents a share, falling short of consensus at 15 cents."
Some top management changes are needed. Messed up company with no clear direction or purpose. seems like a gambling company than a real business.
"On 3/3/21, with GRPN trading at $61, Jim Cramer recommeded Groupon as a ""Buy."" I think this is more evidence that Groupon may continue its winning ways. Groupon's revamped sales model of automating deals should prove to be a winning strategy."
"Just to clarify my post from yesterday: I did not intend to imply that GRPN would go down to $1. It probably won’t. My point was that most investors associate reverse splits with stocks struggling to stay above $1. By announcing the reverse split, Groupon planted the $1/share number firmly in the minds of thousands of investors. This $1 level is acting like a psychological magnet right now, pulling GRPN further downward. Who knows how further it will drop."
"I'll play Captain Obvious here....because of the low retail float, the selling is coming from institutional investors. Lefkofsky might be selling his 1.5M-3.0M shares too. It's within the timeframe of his previous sales."
JOHN won't share how much he has lost 
30 Million tickets sold 2017!!!
Yahoo Finance has GRPN reporting earnings before market opens tomorrow. Anyone see something different?
Even as it's on it's way to the 2's J in complete love with grpn
John turning bearish on his precious Grpn but unfortunately he is drowning in dead sharesPoor old man
Tanquan and Anonymous A match made in heaven
.007 has no cents..poor fella
I'm good for a buyout @ $7.50
I am holding.
Volume was good and GRPN held $5. For the stock to move forward it will have to break $5.17 and the ever important $5.35 level. The ER will be out on 11-1. The action will be interesting leading into that event.
"third quarter 2016 financial results on Wednesday, October 26, 2016 , at 5:00pm EDT"
Buyout???? If TWTR can achieve it why not GRPN. could it be BABA finally looking to increase its revenue base. GO GRPN!!!!!
"What a couple of nuts Brad and .01, make a cute couple, when they say going down we know its on each other..LMAO"
I think Hari blocked Brad the Puffer
"Three positive news articles about Groupon in a little over a week, hopefully tomorrow is a bright day!"
tomorrow 
I gave up and sold it 2weeks ago. Congrats to all who have been patiently holding it.
Do not get rattled!!
"this stocks sucks, FER is right. am out Monday"
"For those who have been following and invested in this stock, your first red flag was managements lack of confidence by not using any of the $245M remaining in buyback authorization. Now with 75% of the stock held by institutions there will be a fire sale tomorrow. I expect at least 150M shares traded with a closing price around $1.70. The company has proposed a 1 for 10 to 1 for 12 reverse split. This translates into a $17-22 share price post RS."
"I meant to cover before the close yesterday but got sidetracked shorting HOME, so I covered earlier this morning. This looks like an options move up because their fundamentals are awful and there is no justification for it going up. I'll be looking to short again before their next earnings release, especially if it runs back up over $25. GLTA!"
"WOW....pretty much closed at the low of the day. Any guesses on how tomorrow, and the rest of the week, looks? I'm thinking <$20 by the end of the week now looks pretty likely."
I am buying a lot of things on Groupon since many stores aren’t open I am long
Buy now on this dip.Monday is closed and next week will be up despite large Wall Street firms trying to steal your shares at a discount.
Oh CliveLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
soon will be 3
GRPN is at resistance. Either the shorts push it back below the 200DMA or watch out above.
What companies are forming right now? very few? so no new business to be made so Groupon let go of some workers that cant make money? Turn them commission only. Smart moves keeps money in the account. Shaving the fat till you are ready to springboard is needed. Good work. Execs need temp furloughs or delays till it explodes in 3 to 4 weeks. I guarantee this will be highest gross Memorial day week for them over.
RetailMeNot is getting bought out for 2 times sales. GRPN is trading at .67 times sales. Makes no sense. Need an activist investor to step in.
bought in at 1.59 . what can we expect from groupon in the future!?
Covered my short at $21.49. Made 4.2KThanks guys!
When is the earning release? Does anyone know?
Chances are grpn will break the 1.18 resistance
"There are here still a lot of people that got here only because they did a filter for reverse split and the GRPN symbol popped up. So they started shorting at $20, then at $30, then at $40, then at $50. LOL Guillermo invites you to stay here till $100, in 2021.There are very few shares thanks to the reverse split, so covering is pretty tough. Four out of five reverse split end up badly because done by companies in extremely tough situation losing money and so on. Groupon is PROFITABLE.So Groupon statistically belongs to that one of out five reverse splits that end up EXTREMELY WELL. Please stick around. We need you to keep chasing the stock price all the way to $100, this year.THANK YOU!"
"Just like clockwork Eric Lefkofsky dumped another 3M shares this week. The COB continues to sell each and every quarter. Set your clock to the first week of June for the next round of dumping. Not one GRPN executive has bought shares on the open market for at least 3 years. It shows they believe in the Rich William's turnaround plan. GRPN is a mere printing press of options, RSU's and other deferred compensation awards for the leadership team."
worst case is a loss of $300M best case is loss of $172M... get very short on this stock.. only way to make money.. This company never gets a free pass..
accesswire says earnins should be up 118%
rebound through this recession is going to make many deals come through. . starbucks will be back on groupon soon. so will whole food's. . and six flags.. Chipotle and so on..
"Longs, I am very very sure that Groupon is a best shining star pick for 2021. It will be the next Best Buy successful story."
didn't they made .07.
This looks like a textbook PUMP AND DUMP....It is hard to imagine that the bottom doesn't fall out of this tomorrow after earnings. Thanks for running it up today...it gave me an opportunity to short at a higher price!Who still uses Groupon???
Interesting calls for August 17 !
Poof...just like that all of GRPN's gains over the past week are gone. I know the chart readers probably saw some pattern but they don't have the same amount of hope and resilience us long shareholders have. We will win in the end. Be patient and enjoy the ups and downs of GRPNville.
Wall street will have to start taking notice!!
Nothing seems to stop GRPNs progression up!Not even day trading profit takers.Go GRPN
@brad poor Brad!!!
Any company that does reverse split is not a good company. The stock will almost go down to the same level before split. The management have no idea to turn this business into profit and don’t have a clear direction of that they are trying to do. That’s what reverse split means.
Need to get this puppy back to 75 per share (just for the tons of people / investors that purchased around $3.50 last year)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groupon-soars-push-eliminate-hassles-145324917.html
"Groupon Chief Financial Officer Michael Randolfi Resigns >GRPN8:55 am ET August 22, 2019 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Colin Kellaher Groupon Inc. (GRPN) on Thursday said Michael Randolfi resigned as chief financial officer to pursue another opportunity. The Chicago online daily-deals provider said Melissa Thomas will serve as interim chief financial officer while it conducts a search for a permanent replacement. Groupon said Ms. Thomas, 39 years old, will also continue to serve in her current role as chief accounting officer and treasurer. Mr. Randolfi had been Groupon's chief financial officer since April 2016. The company said his resignation wasn't due to any disagreement on any matter."
Who made FER aka $1.17 spokeswoman for shorts?
Everything is green....except Poooo p On
Anyone else confirm the new SEC13F buys?
OMG it’s in the green!! Don’t blink you might miss it!
Crickets
who came up with groupon select. I paid 5 dollars and get 25% off most deals it's crazy money losing business
Selling short into this flash pop. Easy money ahead. Bagholders should be selling into this too...
Mark every time you buy you lose money??? New meds maybe?
J and JOHN almost completely covered in hot steamy doo doo 
I told you guys
"In 2008, Groupon skyrocketed in a down economy. This market feels like 2008 all over again. Will business look to increase sales and will customers look for good bargains? If so, GRPN at $1 is the steal of the century."
"on RB, when stock split, does your equity amount for GRPN freeze/disappear temporarily from your portfolio amount? just curious!"
will GRPN close in green again like yesterday?!
The handwriting was on the wall when grpn went public. The business concept would never be sustainable. Should have sold to goog when they had the chance. A Reverse Split is only going to deplete shareholder value even more.
Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN): Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.07 misses by $0.08; GAAP EPS of $0.13 beats by $0.01.• Revenue of $612.31M (-23.5% Y/Y) misses by $92.56M.
"Comparison. It's amazing.If you look at fundamentals and compare Price to sales ratio for same category companies, like Ebay, Amazon, Yelp, as suggested by Google Finance, you find that a raio of 3 would be appropriate (as it was in 2014). Groupon is now sitting at a ratio of 0.75. Now, yes there are other parameters that must be considered besides Prices to Sales , but if the restructuring continues (as it has proven for the past 4 Qs), even maintaining sales of $3B as of now, Groupon should legitimately trade at a ratio of 2 (if not 3), or about 3 times today's price, that is $12-$15. On top of that, let's consider the latest synergies with credit card companies and the Grubhub partnership. Those alone could further push the stock price to double digit by Q4 2017.Exciting times. GLTA"
">They now want to immediately change to growth. >Have not grown in more than 5- years. >Unable to deliver and capitalize in years. >They said, Groupon would be profitable by ""2018"" now its ""2022"" now. When they speak through their teeth nothing truthful comes out, ""BEWARE"". GOING BANKRUPT before ""2022"""
Oh JohnLOL!!!!!!!!!
Bobblehead Brad bobbing again today!! Good Bob job Brad!!
The CEO has been for 5 yrs. all the things he tried have been FAILED. It is a total and complete disaster for GRPN holders and customers.
JOHN and J thought 4 was going to hold 
Relax Breathe all will be well!!
Stock never holds any gain
Sold most again at 1.86....Still few averaging 1.74. Will close if cross and reinitiate tomorrows any dip
"As we approach Labor Day in Chicago. The birthplace of labor day. Approx. 3,000 employees in Groupon building. If there's a buyout, I believe there will be a headcount reduction. Great for longs but bad for employees... hypothetically, if they cut headcount now, the share price would got up making $grpn MORE expensive for buyers.The cash on balance sheet valuable. The debt load is a burden. Stock unloved to my eye. Happy Holiday!"
A reverse stock split unfortunately is a HUGE...red flag and clear indication that the ship is sinking.... Take the money and run.......... MTNB
Tracy calling you a coward because you won’t buy shares of grpnShe must be a relative of John
Hallelujah!!!!

"Im my opinion, this company will never be profitable based on their business model. To prove it, look at the stock history and earnings since their IPO. They failed to get their shares up to their IPO level. Then, reverse split which means the company is struggling. A while there was some news that they wanted to buy YELP, what a joke? Short it now while it’s up which shouldn’t be because most companies that does reverse split will go down to the same level. There are far more better companies than Groupon to invest and never fall in love with stock or chase a stock. Good luck all."
J bought 10k at 3.15Yikes. That’s why he probably drove his car off the cliff
stock seems to be stair stepping upwards on a nasdaq down day...we'll see but I'm looking 3;40 in the short term
20 to 1 reverse stock split in the summer of 2020 to boost the price from two bucks a share to $40 a share to avoid getting pulled from the exchange
"Short squeeze won’t last very long, it was known they are for sale or they would have denied it last week. You will probably be able to buy shares later at 4.30’s before close JMHO"
Don’t wanna sound cocky but I’m saying 29$
3 cents. You're rich.
Wheres Brad..
YahooEarnings calendar had today reporting after market close?! &&!@
Zacks says Strong buy buy buy!!
"Yesterdays close was similar to a few other closes over the past two weeks. High volume, with the stock price moving higher. Volume overall has been trending above average during this time. Only twice in the last 15 trading days did this pattern occur where the stock price went down. After hours volume has also been unusually high. My hypothesis is someone is accumulating and is trying to do so in a very quiet manner. Watching level 2 towards the end of the day, specifically last 45 minutes of trading, shows large bids with sellers holding firm for higher prices. The buyers show no reluctance to pay the higher prices."
"After all these years of changing strategies, now the new/interim CEO has to do just one thing right and GRPN will see $5 soon."
Is everyone holding through earnings?
how GrubHub are doing so great and Groupon is falling
"With this stock, the river flows in opposite direction..uphill. Funny!"
"Earnings are April 30th after hours, NOT May 5th. Decide whether or not you want to hold. History says sell before earnings."
Petar and his 30 shares. That is just too cute
This will be pennies soon. June 16th - massive crash
Ok John/Hari I’m sending you to English lessons. Pack a lunch
Oh John LOL!!!!!!!!!
"Seriously, the Board of Directors and the CEO should all be FIRED!! no excuse."
"At 3:50pm someone did what appeared to be a market sell order for 900,000 shares. Yeah that is normal. The Share price dropped 18 cents down to 4.80 lol"
Im all in
only thing I see green is grpn
Q2 earnings will be here next month or aug . Huge upside today and near future. Strong balance sheet and once covid 19 cools down more and more people are gonna start buying local deals from Groupon. Super buy !!!!!!!!
Q2 guidance is critical. That’s when all the small businesses closed.???
"Brad, please come out now!! I want your hilarious comedy in this underperforming time...Though It has been almost 4 consecutive qtr!!It's time to play with this not long though!!"
"Look at the Management of ARAY, these guys are solid. They put their own money in the stock and now you have confidence in the stock, also up $2 from the low. GRPN executives have no confidence on there own strategy. The need to show that they care for shareholders; which we know was never the case for this so called socially responsible company... $30 to $2.."
6.00 by friday. after 6.00 we will soar to 10.00 baba and comcast knows something we dont
PDD wants to buy grpn for 5 billion... they said no!!
whats first.. 24 bucks or 63? 24 looks good
The ad was clearly meant to give big viewer exposure to Groupon. Strategy from management to help attract more users. Viewers will remember the old dude getting hit in the nuts with a football. Impact. Clever.
We will close $22.67
just wait for it..
Free cash flow and half billion in cash
I thought BABA had part ownership in GRPN? am I wrong?
Yeah ...I’m demanding a fair price for my shares as well..
My prediction is the verdict in the case was leaked and they will be required to pay IBM how much I don't know but in the long run changes nothing about the investment. Also the fact that they announced an earnings date before a deal tell speculator's to exit. Just my thoughts.
I went through this with AMD and held. Was #$%$ off every day. Here I go again. Hope it turns out to be half the move.
J did john deliver that bottle of hooch?
Ji/John posting on cbwtf board tooFollowing me around like a little puppy how cute is that
Intrisic value posted everywhere $4.33. Buy out premium? Coveted stock?? Bidders seem quiet. Market price means something when its your account at 3:01pm...
"There is a reasonable underlying business here with cash to weather the crisis and brand, customers, product to help SMB. Some of the doom and gloom here is overdone. Zullily RetailMeNot Grub and many more acquired for very very high valuation."
interesting how my posts are automatically deleted...wow just trying to prove how cheap the stock is now...
When does this hit $2? SOON
My little observation with GRPN: don't do that cover calls with Groupon because you will lose your shares. It will be $36 in no time.
"Groupon Q1 Results Beat Expectations; Shares Surge9:03 AM ET, 05/09/2018 - MT Newswires09:03 AM EDT, 05/09/2018 (MT Newswires) -- Groupon (GRPN) shares advanced more than 6% in pre-market trading Wednesday after the operator of online local commerce marketplaces reported Q1 results that beat Wall Street expectations.Non-GAAPearnings increased to $0.03 per diluted share in the March quarter, from $0.01 a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Capital IQ had predicted breakeven per share.Q1 revenue decreased to $626.5 million, from $673.6 million. But that beat the analysts' consensus of $604.2 million.Moving forward, the company boosted its expected 2018 adjusted Ebitda to $280 million to $290 million from prior guidance of $260 million to $270 million."
Who remembers when Brad and his boyfriend Barry said GRPN to $7 LOL
No news....it usually is up on a down market and down on an up market. That's been the trend. They go in opposite direction. Don't know why....
Should we expect announcement this week?
quarantine will end. and all the cabin fever people with less money than normal will turn to groupon to save money and experience life that they have been missing. There is no way it can gail. Simply cutting the actual product sales was a slap but it is focussing on customer experiences and almost a concierge service. And if they go that route and do the concierge of services.. they will have little competition related to coming close to the branding. yes.. keep beating this stock down.. and i will keep buying it up. Too many people dealing with their own speculation except they forget the end game.
Never seen so many imbeciles in one location as this board.Company is not going BK with 750 million in the bank.
"All positive, wait until the non retailers step in for a long position. GO GRPN!"
Oh JOHN. Thank god you are here to pst news that we can easily see everywhere elseman you are a TOOL
GRPN reached a new 52 Week Low at $3.27
"Rich Williams seriously whats up ? you've got all these partnerships with major players, solid ebita and cash flow projections going into next year, the stock is at a 2 yr low, why arent you or the CFO triggering buying backs NOW! today! why no news? or updates? incredibly disappointing"
J 2.99....
"lite volume, it will pick up shortly. :)"
Brad and .01 drinking heavy today
Zero faith is this companies management. Look at the history of missteps leadingup to a reverse split.
by Black Friday this wouldn't surprise me that we edge around $3.40 or so
John taken to hospital this weekendOld age and Tourette’s taking its toll
As GRPN makes buying goods and services more user friendly via credit cards and eliminating paper vouchers... we will see better profits through increased volume.
Got in late on GRPN at high $30 and is preparing to add more this morning. Glad to see the stock is recovering.

"Raised guidance, good report, knee jerk reaction. Will be up tommarrow after conf. call tonite. Don't go by headlines:)"
"Both the CEO and CFO reiterated guidance for the quarter and FY 2017 during the earnings call two weeks ago. Furthermore they both mentioned April was strong and May has similar potential with Mother's Day and graduations. The only thing that's changed is a few news stories that may affect the timing of the new tax programs.Most of those in the know feel earnings and not politics has been the driving force behind the markets move to 21K. In the grand scheme of things more institutions invested in GRPN in Q1. Total investment increased by 5%. That translates to approximately 28M shares purchased. Two major players BlackRock and Citadel now have substantial stakes.Board membership consists of Joey Levin - IAC, Michael Angelakis - Chairman Atairos, Robert Bass - Vice Chair Deloitte... all have significant ecommerce experience. They all have vast experience in M&A. These are not passive appointments. Angelakis was a key contributor to the success of Comcast and their acquisition of NBC. Let's see how things playout over the next couple of weeks."
Volume really light today...wont be surprised if the stock closes slightly lower because of profit taking and not wanting to hold over the weekend.
"Bought 10000 shares of GRPN, good time to buy."
I actually was long I got in at 94 cents and sold before the split. Was a long position now I’m going short. We will see what happens
2 buck chuck....one buck soon. When do layoffs start?
$5 x 405m shares = $2bnThat is possible
"Since 7/9 volumes ahve been declining steadily GRPN is done going down as fast money is leaving until the next headline hits. Back to avg 6 to 8 mm a day, dead for now. Patience"
"a rs tomorrow geT ready for a scaryscary crash 25 to over 35 percent crash tomorrow then over 85 to 90 percent crash within 3 to 4 month. that usual pattern IN A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT , RS IS BAD FOR STOCK PERIOD"

"Groupon will test levels again from 2013-2014 at $12.- Groupon grew faster as a company than Amazon (headcount) - Rapid growth led to silos in the organzation - now streamlining and integrating tech- Trimming the fat overseas and shutting down offices where not profitable- Discontinuing business on low margin accounts- New Leadership in place (Randolfi, Williams)- Bottom line on verge of being positive- CASH $$ - Comcast/Alibaba investmentThis is far from over folks"
"It finally placed its footprint in the market, its been awhile that this has been seen with this much strength."
the company should be buying it's own stock back --investors need to run away--far away
This is like a mafia stock
Loading Aug 5 calls. Will definitely go above 5 by first week of august
Wow........25% haircut..........and the announcement of a R/S ?............. What else will go wrong ?
just remember to sell on any pop up..
"I believe it will slightly exceed $6 this year, but I'm hoping for a buyout. I have been waiting way to long to be thrown pennies. Not really funny, my money tied up forever."
"I have to revise my baseball analogy. Originally, I was expecting a ""ground out to the pitcher for for an out"". Immediately following the earnings release, I considered it a ""seeing eye single through the infield"". After further scrutiny and digestion of the numbers it is obvious that they were really an ""infield single off the pitcher's glove that should have been ruled an error"". At first glance, ""beating"" EPS estimates sounds great. However, when you scrutinize more deeply it is evident that they simply implemented cost-cutting measures (i.e. by furloughing thousands of employees) while at the same time their revenues tumbled more than expected. There may be a short-term uptick, but the prospects for the company to actually have any net profits in the near future look incredibly bleak!Good luck to all!"
any clues/inputs from the conference call?!
"For the past 2-3 years there have been multiple posters evangelizing the imminent decline of GRPN. Many on this board refused to listen. Now that you see the stack trading sub $1 how can you even rationalize ownership in this company. If you own, sell! This pig is going to ZERO. There is no mistake about it!!"
Send a press release about share buybacks and balance sheet..
Over 2M shares exchanged hands in the seconds after the closing bell. This is the 3rd or 4th time in the last 10 days Groupon has had unusually high volume at or shortly after the close. Anyone have any thoughts on the activity?
"GRPN down 10% because Alibaba invested big in GRAB. Makes sense, absolutely, NOT, ridiculous!So Alibaba gave up on Groupon? That is nothing to do with anything. Grab is mostly a Uber competitor but they do sell goods and do electronic payments. Again, any connection with Groupon? Absolutely nothing. This short move on Groupon is one more time made by amateur traders.Bottom line: Guillermo's advice of the day: load up in Groupon before it moves in the 40ies for GOOD."
"Do not let the big boys take your shares today… Taking it down to jump in and take it back up… Watch and see, but don’t let them have your shares"
"Keep adding to your shorts... when this tumbles , it goes down like a sack of bricks..."
"Furthermore all of the shorts and bears here, portray GRPN as a hodge podge deplorable online retailer that pretty much sells garbage and tricks customer into using a worthless service..... so with GRPN being a household name in e commerce, it could become the face of the Reddit army, since Wall Street pretty much looks at the Reddit traders in the same way (deplorable),.... alot of similarities here."
"Half the normal volume. This is a great sign going into earnings. So far no huge institutional selling, but probably mom and pop scaredy pants taking their money out."
"Let’s see, beat earnings... check... beat revenue..... check..... raise forecasts......check...sign new deal with AMEX.... check.... GRPN down $1.00 when rest of market is rising like crazy. ??? Very strange price action. Lots of huge market order sells that make no sense unless someone is trying to push the price down. Each share they are shorting will need to be bought back eventually."
"I am not convinced the recent decline is at all related to the overall price increase GRPN has experienced during the past 12 months. Volume was way to significant, 3X average, and the lack of any news is a cause for concern. I am not an alarmist or pessimistic by nature. My thoughts are predicated on years of following and investing in GRPN. If GRPN can stem the downturn in the next couple of days then the future looks good. If not staying in the 5's is in question. Remember the stock only breached the key resistance of $5.95 during intraday trading. It closed below the resistance and has not closed above it at all.GRPN is definitely at a crossroads."
I am out made a little change. They have talked about take over for over 2 years now and nothing. ha watch them get taken over tomorrow lol
pre market morons selling.upside is strong...stay long.
"low volume, so far .everyone must be buying a Groupon local deal.go Groupon!!!"
"Value always will rise to the top. This stock is worth 8.50 to 10 in a buy out based on comp valuations. Just remember charts never work for all those who sold, Do nothing with your position a deal may not be immenent but it's will happen hopefully by year end. Time will tell GLTA"
buy some more puts ....lol
"Groupon...you’ve been a massive disappointment for several years. I’m finally cutting my losses and moving on. Kissing my 16,800 shares goodbye. Peace everyone."
$5.73 today possibly higher!! There is no stopping this stock now!!!
Brad and his alternate ego .01 getting their Meds refilled today!!
"Next correction coming for the market, what do you think this will trade at.. it has not been double digits since it went public.. that means get out and delete from your favorites.. close positions and revisit in a year or two.. buyers are not willing to pay up--sale price is very low.. even Cramer admitted he is wrong on this company.. new CEO is coming, but don't wait for a miracle either.. again sale price if any will be at lower price.."
"Not only do I not think a buyout is coming. I think, the company will announce in the next 24-48 hours that they do not have any insight as to why the stock is rallying. And, they will specifically say that while they are constantly looking for partners and/or companies to sell to, there is no deal in the works. With that....timber. I have been watching this dog and pony show for a long time, and it just repeats itself every few years.Storyline: Contrarians think they found a gem that has been unfairly discarded, has loads of cash on the books, and a functioning business. The stock bounces a bit on a small earnings beat (profit jump on regularly declining revenues). The company will discuss ""restructuring"" and focusing on local. The company hints that they are looking to be acquired. The stock jumps, then reality sets in with the company denying rumors, analysts focusing on declining revenues, and a non-growth business that contrarians want priced like a high tech growth stock.Rinse, lather, repeat. Trading range $2-ish to $6-ishon a 12-18 month cycle."
Did you buy OSTK below $10 ? Watch GRPN
"With all positive, why is this stock not at $20"
"List of analyst clowns for this stock: Tom White - Macquarie, Aaron Turner - Wedbush, Samuel Kemp - Piper Jaffray they all claimed the price target of this stock would be $6 - 6.50 -------> yeah right!"
Groupon needs to update its commercials to get more users. BENEFITS SELL.Show all of the many areas where customers can save.Offer incentives to existing users to sign up new users.Management needs more creative skills to develop the users experience.
Some buying interest starting to show up...multiple large blocks showing up. Just saw 500K pass through.
"Because these numbers were delayed, Q2 will numbers will be here very soon..... and the commentary suggests that will be less bad, and demonstrate recovery of which management will be on tap to verbally discuss on CC."
I hop some good news after the close
Gee what is happening ? Is there light after this RS ? I lost don’t know if 10 shares after RS valuable . Sad
Call me crazy but Groupon has huge opportunite. Im buying more
Were you poop-on this year????? 270 MILLION in loses....nice company. Quarter after Quarter of LOSES.
Let me paint you a picture 2-3 months from now... 150+ million with vaccines and $1400-$2800 in hand from stimulus... what will people do? After. Being locked down for a year? People will Get mani/peddies... buy travel vacations from Groupon and or any other good and service grpn offers :) 3 months from now GRPN could see a huge boom
From now on I will check GRPN everyday and every PM and AH to see if the BUY-OUT news hits the wires. Keep my fingers crossed!
Easiest short call I’ve ever seen.
I am a customer at upwork. They recently changed things having us pay $49 a month and I do not mind. I see this stock at a higher price but I am currently in grpn because they have similar valuations and grpn is a better brand but I am a solid customer with upwork and its worth it.
GRPN is down -7.38% to 4.39
We will see 5 again before we see 4.
JOHN and J in total love with grpn that is tanking daily
https://theolympiareport.com/2020/08/11/stock-traders-buy-high-volume-of-put-options-on-groupon-nasdaqgrpn.html
"Can someone explain to me how this is not seriously undervalued... Revs of 1.3B for the year, about 600M in cash and the market cap is only about 600M????? So crazy."
J thought it was going to 4
bulls getting nervous
looks like it is about to breakdown...
coming 2dollar next week
Heading back to $1
I do not exclude the fact that the new CEO could be Chinese and connected to BABA making GRPN their US based HQ. That would be huge for BABA as it would be for GRPN. GRPN could grow 10x plus within 1-2 years.Guillermo
still down
"Ridiculous manipulation. September stock crash has caused a bloodbath due to general market weakness.Now looking at some Chaikin Oscillator and Money flow Guillermo sees that long money has already starting coming in about a week ago. In other words if we drop lower it create EXTREME pressure for a stronger rebound. Technically speaking $20 now is = $16 in July. $16 doubled, so it should be clear the stock is getting ready for the move to $40 in the next 2 months. So the question is: is a two month 100% gain a good enough return? LOL"
Barclays wants to buy your shares at a cheap price.Don't be fooled.
"Groupon beats by $0.03, beats on revenue"
"Retail price $50, Groupon price $15. 70% OFF. Limited time offer."
When does it go to $1 in December? I ve seen this too many times.
back over $4 today and staying there
isn't going to to drop...but if it do....I got some Puts in place...lol
"Just my 2 cents, stocks do not normally announce a reverse split until they are fairly certain their stock is going below $1 and/or stay below $1 for a period of time. Recent examples are (RAD and SUNW). I thought about buying some after hours on the dip, but now i can't help but think mgmt things things might get worse. I could be totally wrong, i didnt even listen to the call and haven't really been following the news much since i sold 99% of my shares a few months ago."
how about 6.00 by fri. not thanksgiving!
I see no deal and beck to $4 in spite of Jim Cramer cheerleading! FYI...long
J sitting looking at his grpn shares with tears of joy
"All the selling will be done by next Friday the 22nd after the Russell index reconstitution takes place, if you don't know what it is google it. For all who don't believe wait until you see the volume on that day, then you will understand. People are selling because company weights increase or deceases in the index based on market cap weight. It has nothing to do with anything."
Cowen & Co upgraded GRPN to Marker Perform. Price target $5.50.
"Hey, @AR -- I'm not sure what is more impressive: The pure volume of your posts, or the complete inaccuracy of your predictions. Don't get me wrong, I am ""so sure"" Groupon will be in bankruptcy any minute now! LOL."
yeah why all the buying? wassup?
CEO is speaking on CNBCnow
delisting is the future
nobody sell
"It has been many moons since I posted on here. We are a GRPN merchant that ironically enough performs VERY well with this company. That being said it is almost accomplished by magic, we literally NEVER hear from our sales rep in spite of leading a very competitive market in voucher sales. This is simply a culture issue, upper management is horrendous, period. Significant value to unlock in this space, just not by this team. I only own a few thousand shares of common stock but have a deep interest in seeing them succeed as they have contributed greatly to our bottom line for several years in a row. Would love to see a meaningful change at the top,not just the fluff they keep pulling out of their hats."
this is ezay money
Predictions on what the shares will be at by end of 2017?
So tempted to add!! Anyone adding to the position?

"it does look bad, but after removing the costs and the lost revenue, it looks like ebita of $200M+. look at all the other companies like yelp, znga, grub. Groupon will have comparable earnings."
J and JOHN aka Laurel and Hardy 
Congrats to those who sold near the high. This will now drift into the 4.30s until more news comes
"Groupon Announces First Quarter 2020 ResultsFirst Quarter Performance In-Line with Preliminary Results Announced in April• First quarter gross profit of $201 million• First quarter loss from continuing operations of $211 million• Adjusted EBITDA loss of $22 million• First quarter GAAP net loss per diluted share of $7.53• First quarter non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $1.63• Ended the first quarter with $667 million in cash, which included $150 million ofoutstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility"
"William's experience is wildly different from mine. I used Groupon to buy a hotel discount voucher. When I got to the hotel, the manager explained to me that they had so many vouchers that night, that they were only selling the last few rooms at full price (it was a casino and was fairly full that night). I emailed Groupon that night. The merchant apparently broke with the Groupon agreement; there was nothing in the fine print that allowed the merchant to not honor the Groupon. Groupon asked me details, whom I spoke to and when. I was issued a full refund and an apology. Incidentally, I have not seen that merchant on Groupon since. But, my point is that I had a very positive customer experience with Groupon customer service, despite a bad one with a merchant who sold me a voucher on their site."
Next batch of short interest data to be released after the close on Wednesday. Other than this news this is a relatively quiet week unless of course Williams and team decide to stir the pot.
What is going on with GPRN?
GRPN is up 5.15% to 4.49
"WOW. Shorts are having a field day. Picked up 2500 for at 1.90. Let's see where this goes. Percentage wise, the company has less debt and more money that amazon. LOL"
Is anyone giving Groupon a birthday gift??
"This dropped much further than I thought it would. I don’t think it would have dropped this far if they had not mentioned a possible reverse split. There was no legal obligation to mention that. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s almost like they wanted the price to drop. I was 100% out @ 2.20 until just now, picked up 10% of my previous position at 1.40 if there wasn’t a virus out there I would buy back 100%"
"I am holding close to 300,000 shares of grpn currently and on several occasions traded all my shares for cash. Each time I sold the stock it never went down? Just curious as to why that big of a sale would not even move the stock price 2 cents."
GRPN down grade news out before market close. 2.3 soon
And right to yesterdays lows keep reading charts they never work.
Anyone have some onsite on the stock fall? No news and this has been a substantial slide.
This is not about earnings....a buyout seems to be in the offing
Has to be insiders selling!
"this is where all you professional chart readers sell as the stock test the 4.73 level on the 200, best of luck"
Sold all my shares at $3.50 ..Took a loss then.. I was considering getting buying back in if this went to mid 2’s.. but honestly where is this stock going ? Possibly back up to low 3’s and then nowhere after that ? What company would actually buy GRPN ? They blew that opportunity a while ago.. Any honest opinions?
Xavier all your money gone yet??
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groupon-transformation-working-141800828.html
THIS STOCK IS TOAST
You can practically buy almost everything you need from Groupon including booking local entertainment and vacations across the world from Groupon. What's not good about that especially during this pandemic time.
Looking like a nice day! spring has arrived!!
People who buy this volume 104 million till now know how should make money. Next week it will be $2.50. Do not sell your shares cheap.
"People who bought $GRPN yesterday after hours thinking they got a 16% bargain is now surely disappointed at 40% crash. This is why you want to stay away from a losing stock, one that lost value in the last 10 years, while market index more than doubled. And $YELP is next."
Look at the bright side: net income was rising :) why not try to take for that low price some shares...
soon it will be over 5.
Where's Groupon+ being advertised? Where is the short video on their website to explain how to use and sign up for it? I don't see it when you go to their website. They're not sending me an invite even though I'm a groupon email subscriber. If this is what will propel the stock and is a big part of their future business plan I think management is doing a poor job of inviting users to use Groupon+ at the moment... Is it just me???
another positive start!!
People still use this app?
Where is William's Buddy Cramer!! Both are wrong on 'this stock.. don't listen to them..
Does short get burned?
I’m not surprised at the least about Groupon’s all new lowest. They will continue to struggle to move beyond and stay beyond the $5 mark.
Volume slowing up. Midday trading will push this higher probably
Buy buy buy
"Roku has revenues of $500Mn and has a market cap of $6.66 Bn , Groupon has revenues of $2.8Bn and market cap of $2.4Bn ..WoW Wall St Con men ..wow !!"
LONGS JUST LOST IT ALL
"I feel very confident that we will be much higher in one year. Once GRPN starts reporting some positive news (i.e. Groupon +) we should see a steady climb upward. This small ""fall"" is but a bump in the road. Note $5.40/share is a strong resistance level so risk is best to the upside at this point."
$GRPN CHEAPEST BUY. Groupon has more value then $ETSY Etsy is over $60 today. If you invest in Groupon today one day you be looking at over $50 Secure company lots of cash and they went back to shopping. Plus when the full economy opens they will profit a lot more again from local deals.
Brad u still here?
"this smells of major resignation, CEO, CFO"
"They have changed their goods model as well into more Amazon-esque where they are charging a commission and having the vendor cover shipping....it won't work like that. Amazon has much better costs and efficiencies that Groupon does. The 'experience' portion of groupon is done. Goods is what is trying to keep it afloat and their current, new model will not work or grow. It is not profitable for the sellers without 20-25% price increases. Shoppers will go somewhere else...."
"Groupon has needed to continuously spend to acquire customers and build relationships with merchants, and such spending may limit Groupon’s profitability.If merchants become disenfranchised with its daily deals, they may either flock to Groupon’s competitors or push back against Groupon’s high take rate.Operating leverage, if any, is only for the short-term as Groupon will have to keep spending more to acquire new customers in order to increase transactions per and ROI for the merchant.Groupon’s business model makes it heavily dependent on daily deals, which is a major headwind. Since most of the offerings are consumer discretionary products, demand is heavily dependent on macroeconomic conditions. As redemptions are high and unused Groupons are low (revenues recognized upfront in daily deals, so an unused Groupon boosts the company’s revenues), the transition is expected to negatively impact the top line in the near term.Moreover, Groupon needs to continue spending on generating awareness about its offerings, which will drive up costs. Further, the company is likely to incur sizeable expenses owing to the ongoing restructuring activities, which can weigh down on its profitability. Additionally, aggressive investments for mobile, infrastructure and product development will continue to drive operating expenses higher.Despite growing billings, Groupon is yet to earn significant profits since its inception. Moreover, revenue growth has slowed down in the last couple of years. Furthermore, the new restructuring plan directly contradicts the company’s earlier business model per which itundertook rapid international expansion at the cost of profits.Intensifying competition remains a major headwind, which is also likely to hurt profitability. The company expects competition in eCommerce generally, and group buying in particular, to continue to increase. In addition, increasing presence of the social media companies in the e-commerce space can also pose serious challenges to Groupon’s recovery as merchants are increasingly adopting these platforms to sell their products."
Relax Dan tells you $40 by Thanksgiving and Guilermo tells you ultimately going to $500 a share
Bashers are never short just burnt longs who never got over the fact that they were wrong. That's why they disappear when the stocks go up. Trust me on that one.
John you ready for this???You’re precious grpn is about to tank!
WOW. Groupon caught lying AGAIN>
Shorts will be working hard today.
going to 5 a share near term.
Nice pop for longs yesterday on huge volume. The company has remained silent on its intentions. Let's see how the next couple of days play out. Will the momentum continue or will the downward drip return? Latest short interest will be released after the close tomorrow. I'm curious to see what the change is and if there were any whispers about the most recent news. The July 15th update will show how many shares covered after the Recode news.
5-18-20 are earnings I think will be good. I’m buying a lot of goods on Groupon and I’m sure a lot of other people are also
"Shorts will have a hard time explaining away the top line beat of 395MM vs street 200MM, even highest street expectation was 338MM and they blew that away, and did it during the quarter where covid had the greatest impact."
"Gonna load up the truck again, have to know how to play the game..Brad take another Puff"
When the Stock Brokers will liquidate Short positions?
"Updated Jul 9, 2018 5:28 PM EDT ~ After the first quarter of 2018, the company raised its full-year-adjusted EBITDA from $260 to $270 million to $280 to $290 million, prompting Gabelli & Co. to rate Groupon its, ""Best Idea of 2018.""The company's international business proved more resilient: Groupon's international gross profit rose 19% in the first quarter and the international customer base expanded to 17 million.Tom Forte of D.A. Davidson & Co. considers that unjustifiably low, even after factoring in Groupon's slow growth rate in recent years. He's a set a $12 price target on the stock, assuming a sale to a suitor like Priceline (PCLN) , Alibaba (BABA - Get Report) , Alphabet (GOOG - Get Report) , (GOOGL - Get Report) or Facebook (FB - Get Report) . He added that even if GRPN isn't sold, it should still trade between $6 and $8 a share."
people sitting home probably planning and buying from GROpN ...one Lock down over they all run for vacations and activities
Great deals on Blue Apron and Home Chef!
"Recode article says Groupon trying to find buyer since at least June. $6billion offer rebuffed. Valuation approaching $2bil. Humongous office building, 6,000+ headcount and declining; margins (thanks Amazon), ROE, revs and EPS.I'm sure someone in China, London or Australia wants a shiny empty building...High price target $8, low $4. Trading below low price target again. LBO? 10cent? WalMart? JD? Alibaba (Green media)still long 33million shares. They'll take any offer at this point, I reckon. Good luck- lemmings, pumpers, bashers and trashers."
jump up ya'll
no direction I mean
Cramer is such a clown- jumps on the bandwagon- loser-
this would be a great buy for EBAY
9M shares traded in 3 hours. Very high volume. Let's see how it trades in the second half of the day. I wonder if the company is buying any shares? We shall see soon enough.
Hmm maybe buy @1.40
SQUEEZE THIS!
$1.11 today ? When will it break 1 bucks ?
What happened? It keeps going up
Wants to sell itself?Market cap is 3.5 times cashNegative income. $0 positive cash flowStagnant income for previous 5 yearsThere are no takers
"Anyone see our resident shorters??? I can just smell those short burning!!!!!Groupon Announces First Quarter 2020 ResultsFirst Quarter Performance In-Line with Preliminary Results Announced in April• First quarter gross profit of $201 million• First quarter loss from continuing operations of $211 million• Adjusted EBITDA loss of $22 million• First quarter GAAP net loss per diluted share of $7.53• First quarter non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $1.63• Ended the first quarter with $667 million in cash, which included $150 million ofoutstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility"
Thinking we Retest 2.89 low than leave the 2s behind..
sell off in the pipeline!!! Fall before elections = market dip 10%
Groupon is worth a lot more than its current price. $7.50+ would be a fair price for shareholders.
J you lost. How does it feel? No wait I will answer for you. You feel great right?
"Next few days will be interesting. Resistance at $5.35 then at $5.67. If GRPN is to crack $6 I believe a catalyst will be needed. Earnings of course will be key. I expect the recent storms to have some impact to both top and bottom lines. Houston, Miami, San Antonio, New Orleans and SW Florida are large markets for GRPN. Someone is accumulating and there is a definite pattern to when the buying is taking place. Look at the charts over the past 3 weeks, especially the volumes from 1 PM on. I am long and waiting for that catalyst before I make a move."
"Groupon is discounting it's shares...They've been on sale all year. How low can they go??? Check the new low list to find out...J, are you still pumpin'??"
"For all those people who say that GRPN is ""going bankrupt"": Groupon went from $751,000,000 in cash 12/2019 to $850,000,000 in cash 12/2020. And the market cap is only $1.25B! Over $29.50/share in cash! Say what you want about Groupon pivoting their business model, but you can't argue with the numbers. Bankruptcy is not on the table. Sorry."
Up on a down day with decent volume!!
"They are going to need to find better deals, in my town near Boston they have one valvoline oil change deal. And anyone knows not to trust valvoline."
I hear Groupon is in lot of issues. do you suggest to hold the stock now ?
heading in the right direction
"Great buy in this range, hold it long you will be rewarded!!"
"Don't give up, Don't give in..."
Pretty much just a summer market. No progress up or down in a week. Selling into every rally...
"Board of Directors counting, while the investors lag and stock price tumbles"
No volume today.
will it once again fizzle down or make the move up?!
Hit the like button if you want to Fire the CEO...
After the 4.6 standings this stock will be back over 5 in no time!
15 cents and dropping 
Open. Down 25% Already.
Just picked up 250 shares of this bargain of a price. As soon as Rona is gone people will be dying to get out and do things and businesses will be looking to recoup and bring people in.... this is going to print money soon and has the cash to back it.
Groupon is priced for bankruptcy . More risk more returns . Personally I like their new strategy by focus on experience and rebrand itself!
short squeeze tomorrow?
"Okay, what do I do with my Option Call? Woke up to 98% loss. How do I get my money back?"
Remember John....LOL!!!!!!!
If Jim Cramer says buy on tv.. he actual is saying don't buy.. stock is almost a real buy in the 3's
"It seems that Groupon has lost its mojo with the people on this board, investors and a lot of its reputation. B.O.D's need to buy back stock instead of constantly taking on a quarterly basis and not allowing it to build the stock price. They are draining this dry with excuses, while taking investors for a ride."
We are back in the game people .02 hike after hours.... There is no stopping us now.
"What is interesting is that quite a few recently beaten down stocks like Pandora, Zynga, Yelp and Snap are performing well today. Not sure what the similarities are other than their overall under performance and tech sector affiliations."
shorted this before last earnings and it played out well. same story again? ER out Tues.......
"It seems to me that Groupon is running more ads this 1st quarter then last. Perhaps it's because it payed off in the 4th quarter. Looking for a strong beat and raise, i see this going to 6.50 then right to 8's. Retail has been terrific place to be this earning period."
Another glorious day! Have a good one all!
"For the next 5-10 years grpn needs to buy all the outstanding shares of the stock as they can, if the price does not go higher than $4.. need to get the outstanding shares down to 250M share count.... the last 7 years have been a horrible investment for shareholders.."
It was not to long ago we were at this price - I plan to buy a few shares at these levels - just added!
"There used to be a dance called 'The Slide"". I hope everyone on this board knows how to do this. If not, you're about to get a lesson."
Ah c'mon already!!!
lawsuit is bad for this co. it will hurt pretty bad..price will drop.....
Guys I am telling you GRPN is a grift from this price it’s come ones a life time just buy and hold
short??
"Portfolio's taken a massive beating, but there isn't news attached with this, so not concerned."
Next week will be big... 50 cents in either direction. . but looks down with a reversal! !
"Don’t know about fundamentals, but people need who like money and cash back need to use this. Once I found out about the restaurant cash back offers I immediately linked my Uber credit card w/ 4% cash back on all food purchases and coupled that the cash back deals at restaurants found on Groupon. Found out a cafe my fiancé and I eat at all the time had a 30% cash back offer on the first purchase and 10% back on every purchase made after...now I’m getting 14% back every time. Free money is great, Yelp has a similar cash back offer, but with usually less percentage, I can see Google or Amazon incorporating some of Groupons deals. I buy what I know works"
"Looking good! Pretty solid close above the 200 DMA. Unless the entire market corrects down, this is heading to 50+ by year end!"
Large blocks in last 10 mins trade. Ignore Yahoo volume. Js number correct.233k900k900k 100k123k363k737kEverything done at $3.90 in the last 10mins. Looks more like matched orders as one fund sold to another. These trades were .02 off low. Selling into 4.13s.
Nice double bottom has been formed . Lets hope we're on our way to closing that gap at $4.80 - $5.20 . Market momentum could be driver!
Hitting new lows dailyLike John 
GRPN is up 10.54% to 5.35
Stock now positive for the year. No longer a tax loser for selling in Sept or Oct. very positive.
Strong Buy cheap at this levelshttps://cweb.com/2018/03/18/groupon-the-come-back-kid-stock-cweb-com/
Monster earnings report. Wow
Wow J time for new meds ey?
Can we just talk about Groupon guys?
An official filing has yet to be released.
why is it so quiet here today?
Watch GRPN closely. “Hint”
Huge block right at close- close to 2mm
"basically if you compare groupon's fundamentals to amazon's, if amazon is worth $1600, groupon should be between $8-$15. I think analysts will catch up..."
They have insiders propping up this dog. Good comedy. Directors trying save their horrific investments.
$25 in Jan-18
John told you that owning this stock “ is good business sense “LOL !!!!!
"I'm in S. Florida and have been receiving groupon deals for a few years and occasionally purchased a deal or two but recently noticed what seems to be an upgrade in companies using them, even the pro hockey team. Bought some stock on the pull back. P.S. bought a JC Penny $20 gift card for $10 bucks."
4M shares trade with one hour to go. Let's see if we have a feeding frenzy over the next 60 minutes...I hope so!!!!
John Najarian on from CNBC just mentioned he purchased Groupon. Could explain the pop today.
Oh lala oh lala.... Robinhooders free shares are being unloaded!
Will buy a few shares toad at as a gamble at $3.15 or below. Been punked by my sources in past. Did make $$ on IQ. Lots of chatter out there though. Will go to $4.25 soon.
Is this company being bought out or not?
"As with most reverse stock split (PIR, Blue apron etc), stock price will likely crash another 50% after RS."
Getting bought out soon. You’re welcome
hoping for sub 3$ tomorrow
"I used to think that Rich Williams was the right CEO, but he simply has failed and not turning around this company, the right CEO should be putting up 1 billion per qtr in revenue, ridiculous that with all the partnerships and the millions of customers that they cant figure out how to generate more revenue, very disappointing QTR and Call"

"Big seller at the close, over 2M shares dropped in the final 5 minutes. Lots of buying preceding the selloff. Could have been short covering."
GRPN reached a new 52 Week Low at $2.86
"I find it amazing that a company like Pandora with out paying customers and mainly ad revenue, share price is now over $5"
"GRPN is listed as having $785MM in cash, with only a $990MM market cap? Is that right? Do they have a ton of debt not accounted for? Any insights appreciated."
"GRPN's history of beating estimates is hit or miss. They have not, in recent history, blown away estimates. Guidance for the most part has been conservative. No different than many companies. Williams needs to deliver a banner quarter. If GRPN can deliver .15 or better, revenues of 875M or better with positive guidance then the stock will rise. Look at TWTR. There results were good, the outlook equally as good and as a result the stock is on a tear. Furthermore there is a significant short squeeze taking place there. GRPN is similarly set up. A large number of shares short are betting the company will disappoint. Should they surprise the stock could easily catapult to the mid 7's. If they meet or miss the stock will see the low 4's or worse. The action leading to Wednesday's announcement does not indicate much. The broader market is schizophrenic and GRPN is acting much like the market."
"Every single time, GRPN starts to make a good move, something major negative happens within next 2-3 days to bring it back down.. every single time!! Friday was no different, such hate for this stock is unbelievable!!"
Tuesday fun day !!
"Government will bailout anyone due to the corona virus , if necessary. I would not worry about cash."
Sounds like they have a buyer from the call..
expect good numbers. should see at least 10-15% gain.
The super bowl commercial did not gain any traction at all.Simple job is show the consumers how they can with GRPN in so many areas. Black men kicking white guy in the balls did nothing.
Way overdone. There’s plenty of value in the company which still makes 28 cents EPS. Buy it!!!!!

"What to Expect from the 2018 Russell Rebalance TradesTraders Magazine Online News, June 7, 2018 Friday, June 22, will be one of the biggest – and busiest – trading days in the U.S. equity market, with turnover expected in the $300 to $400 billion range, as investment managers adjust their portfolios in accordance with the Russell Reconstitution, the annual change in the benchmark FTSE Russell investment indices. The large-cap Russell 1000, small/midcap Russell 2000 and broad Russell 3000 are among the most widely followed U.S. indices, with an estimated $1.2 trillion in assets tracking the benchmarks.Like what you see? Click here to sign up for Trader Magazine's weekly newsletter to get breaking news, exclusive features, the industry photo of the day and more.We project that this year’s reconstitution will lead to approximately $30 billion in net turnover, higher than last year’s $23 billion in turnover. Some highlights of this year’s trade: We are projecting 290 constituent changes to the Russell 3000 (excluding migrations) There are 7 projected additions to the Russell 1000 index, including Spotify (SPOT), AXA Equitable (EQH) and the second share class of CBS (CBS.A). There are also 2 likely deletions from the index, Ingersoll Rand (IR) and Delphi Technologies (DLPH) There are 164 projected additions to the Russell 2000 index including Zscaler (ZS) and Avaya (AVYA). 39 companies are expected to migrate from the Russell 1000 to the Russell 2000 and 43 companies will migrate from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000 The largest sector inflows are expected into Healthcare (net $1.8 bln to buy across adds and deletes), where we anticipate 66 additions to Russell 2000 (40% of all Russell 2000 additions) along with 32 deletions Some of the biggest expected trades include Spotify ($519m to buy), Jazz Pharma (JAZZ, $375m to buy), Ingersoll-Rand ($692m to sell) and Ensco (ESV, $293m to sell) Depending on index membership, we estimate that firms benchmarked to Russell indexes own more than 10% of the total float shares outstanding in some of these names. As a result, additions or deletions from the index can generate significant price impact and create a substantial liquidity event. These liquidity events make the Russell Reconstitution a noteworthy occurrence even for many traders who are not benchmarked to the indices.While a substantial portion of the trading takes place into and at the close on rebalance day (June 22), we would expect trading activity to rise in the weeks ahead of the Russell, particularly as traders reposition themselves ahead of the S&P and FTSE index rebalances on June 15."
Where are yesterday’s geniuses that said up big today??LOL!!!!!!!!!!
Adrenaline rush time!
Groupon is going to get bought out very soon
"Groupon (GRPN) is higher this morning, thanks to a positive initiation from Gabelli & Co.Analyst Matthew Trusz launched coverage of the stock with a Buy recommendation and a $7 target price. He sees five main catalysts from the stock.First is the fact that it has 32 million customers in North America, and that base is growing at a 15% annualized rate. He applauds the new management's revitalized marketing push, which have led to six million organic net customer additions in the last six quarters."
buyout $6.21!!!!
57 million dollar payment to IBM priced in already? Or we are witnessing a death spiral?
Usually the opposite it falls day before release!!
"As I suspected, J the biggest GRPN pumper is nowhere to be found. Earlier posts all deleted. He mocked FER, aka $1.17, when the share price was $4.50+ and FER was emphatic about GRPN's imminent decline. Well today ladies and gentlemen FER's original target price was hit. J, in his dubious and condescending words, was constantly touting how he was a buyer and supporter every step of the way. All I can say is if you loved GRPN in the mid 4's you must be madly in love in the high 2's. Personally I see this thing finding a range in the $2.50's. I feel bad for all the longs who have held tight. You have been betrayed and mislead. I do not see an immediate catalyst for the stock. A white knight is all that is left."
Quite a positive close. Stock catapulted higher on strong volume. Solid action when tech and the NASDAQ had a down day. Thought maybe there might be a surprise with GRPN ringing the bell today. Regardless a good day with solid momentum for the week.
time to write a letter to the CEO or reply to his asking for immediate resignation.4 years and stock price lower than where it was. He messed up Groupon plus. now after 4 years comes up with the membership idea that I had 4 years ago. Spent millions in marketing for nothingGet out worthless person.
Has the reality timer been triggered yet?
"volume to hit 10,000,000 by close"
Where is Barry when you need him?
Actually sears is a better company from looking back at history... Groupon cannot get a bid higher.. Kmart was bought at over a $ 100. Per share... we are lucky to get 5.50.... weak management.
J ecstatic over 1 cent move
You would think after screwing up a $6 billion dollar offer and screwing the investors and stock holders they would make more frequent announcements about future plans .... anything .... something... absolute disgrace... I have been a customer for a few years and have no complaints but as shareholder I’m absolutely disgusted.
Groupon had a breakout 4th quarter. Look for it to test 52 week high shortly.
im buying more
taking off now....moon here we go
@michael I don’t see any fortune tellers here just regular folks talking about fortune takers...called Groupon!
None of you guys will ever reach the level of John He was pure comedy
"Brad getting new Meds from his Shrink today, hopefully he gets visions of $2 out of his demented mind!!"
100k at 2.91 let see what happens...
What other companies are potential buyers of Groupon Inc at $3B+?
"Buy-out might happen anytime. The company is for sale. Look at Call Option volume/open quantity every month. It is the most for October 19, 2018...It might happen before that date, imo."
"Cesar5 hours ago>They now want to immediately change to growth. >Have not grown in more than 5- years. >Unable to deliver and capitalize in years. >They said, Groupon would be profitable by ""2018"" now its ""2022"" now. When they speak through their teeth nothing truthful comes out, ""BEWARE"". GOING BANKRUPT before ""2022"""
4$ calls nov
GRPN will skyrocket to $10 this year as a result of the trade dispute. higher cost of goods will make people searching for Groupons..
Guilermo tells You triple digits are coming how cute is thatLOL!!!!
I said this before at $8. No one is buying this company. Gonna keep shorting till it's less than $1
Only possible good news was Sarah Butterfass joining the company ... few good changes to come.. now just get rid of the CEO and put someone with a much greater outlook and change for this company
So much pressure on this stock by pump and dump day traders.
J and JOHN thought it was going to 4
Will take profit after it hits 1.90
Time for me to buy more shares
Firm tied to billionaire Groupon co-founder pays $31M for Four Seasons condo in Surfsidehttps://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2018/09/04/lefkofsky-pays-31m-for-four-seasons-condo.html?ana=yahoo&yptr=yahoEven the co-founder is taking the his money into a better investment....
Cramer said to buy at $4.72 has he had any comments lately?
2.83 tomorrow some big sell off 3m shares
Stormy Daniels just upgraded GRPN to a strong buy and giving coupons to her shows.
"The company went to selling discounted merchandise because it needed revenue from different revenue sources other than couponing to become profitable. Now that merchandise sales has become a failure, what does the CEO think he can do to to turn the company now that he is eliminating 30% of its revenues?"
"Short 4000 shares GRPN at $27.41 average price. Got most shares filled at $27.50+, but then grabbed a few more on this downward slide...Still very happy with the fill price, huge downside risk here on a bad ER, IMO."
I think that the buyer rumor is just hype. 5.25 will be the top
Were you poooop -ed on? Again?
Grpn to ring the bell....best advertisement for grpn and its free!
If you guys are so sure there is no buyer then short the stock. Do you think it’s easy to buy a multi billion dollar international company? They have to evaluate every part of the business. There are still 2 weeks left before earnings and it was $4.30 before this announcement so only .38 cents away from that. A buyout will be around $6.75. So you might make .38 shorting or $2.00 or more going long.
"They said they were talking to several interested parties for a sale and that was back when the stock was in the 5’s if those parties are truly interested, They should be able to get it for around $5.50 a share based on the current share price. A 33% premium or so to keep the shareholders happy so they vote yes. The share price falling this much makes a buyout more likely, that is on course if GRPN Mgmt will let it go for that price. My guess is they want mid 6s we shall see."
Premarket volume is too light; doesn't look like the early morning gains will hold; let's see what unfolds.
Well today we see light volume early only to have the volume accelerator pressed as GRPN heads to the middle of the trading day. Buyers and sellers are both active. This is to be expected with earnings on the horizon.Watch closely. The ride is beginning.
Gain given back AHThis thing is going to tank on Monday
Exceptional!!
"IMO, the sale of Groupon is contingent upon the final decision of the litigation. Currently, they are ordered to pay approx. $83 million in damages to IBM. The judge in the case has the authority to triple those damages if there was willful intent. Until then, with final damages impending, no sale will be consummated, IMHO."
"traditionallyTraditionally Q2 is good. It's Spring and people start go out a do stuff. And they buy groupons...That is why we are getting the pop. Anyone shorting until Q2 is released would take a big gamble. After Q2 then maybe.Bottomline: to bring this stock back to $8-$10 this year, (totally possible) all management has to do is that some initiatives are taking off. Like the credit card embedded discount. If we get some traction there (with a big name like Amex, or similar) then this could be overnight a double digit stock. Keep in mind that there are stocks in the same sector out there with financials similar to GRPN and trading with much higher multipliers, which means a $10 stock price is absolutely reachable."
Be careful..Cramer pumped this and the usual result isn't good...
BABA has 33 billion in cash and already owns 6% of the company.
Averaging down to 1.75
"Can I dream a little YAHOO people! Wouldn't it be wonderful if GROUPON became alive again - YES, a buyout would be amazing. . . and it makes so much sense because the company has excellent customer foundation. Let's hope it goes to $10. in one day (like the old days)! I can dream, can't I?"
Though I didn't loss anything but trimmed badly my gains... Thanks God I closed my calls just to reserved my capital!!
Trading was halted during after hours....too funny. Well below $2 tomorrow...... .50 cents in a month.
"did I just see it hit 4.82, going negative?!"
J and JOHN told you to buy buy buy...
Pretty solid close today. Stock rallied up .10 from the lows. Strong volume at the end of the day.
Is this a long term? Or quick sell.
"This is a hidden gem that's set to explode. Last time it beat the earning estimate by 0.95c, which was incredible! This time it will be exceeding the estimates a lot once again, and the stock hasn't price it in yet. Can't wait to see its numbers tonight! GRPN jumps back to the 50s !"
$GRPN the shorts have a strong grip right now. It's nothing that strong EBITDA growth won't cure. New slogan: Go Groupon!
Ji/John told you“Owning this stock makes good business sense”LOL!!!!!!!
what time is the earnings reported today?
I wonder how much money Groupon paid Cramer to be on his show?
"next step, create 2 day shipping options. draw goods closer to compete with the big boys, and in time for holiday rush"
John/Hari tells you it’s going to $10LOL!!!!
"Wow I missed alot friday..big drop, big comeback!!"
Someone knows of bad earnings? Awful fishy....
"GRPN needs acquisition. Like this they can never make it. Low customer base, low quality product, and low active users. This is a death sentence."
What happened with the reverse split
"Groupon said non-GAAP earnings for the three months ending in December came in at 10 cents per share, up nearly 43% from the same period last year but 3 cents shy of the Street consensus forecast."
Girls...take a chill pill.
"50 million global users mean potentially 50 Billion dollars in revenues ($1000 a year per family/user, no biggie).$50B revenues means a market capital of at least $50B, so a stock price of almost $100. Which means today's $5 is laughable. I think it should sell at/around $10 a share.The current leadership has done the first step: clean-up the books, cut the fat and streamline the business. Now for the new leadership it's the easy part...ALibaba can come in and start selling their stuff to the 50M customers...again, even just $500 a year per customers translates into $25B revenues...that can be achieved in 1-2 years. Groupon will sell by October, mark my words."
@Brad @Barry 
Blue Horseshoe likes Groupon. Hear from GS grapevine that a $5.50 offer from GRUB may be announced.
This stock had to reverse split it just a matter of time before it goes down
Good Morning All...Q4 13F filings are in and Groupon saw a noticeable increase in institutional investors. I've pasted the link for your review. Almost 63% of all GRPN shares were held by institutions as of 12-31-17. https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/grpn/institutional-holdings
This stock should be at 5.50 -6.00
Yes I agree... Made that mistake years ago and learned from it. I actually made up most of my loss just in pre- market on the additional shares of ACBFF and CRON I bought yesterday when I sold GRPN. Still disappointed in Groupon but that is the risk of investing. Even if Groupon does make a come back I am still happy with my decision. Waiting for a .25 - .50 price increase versus a multi dollar increase on another stock is much better for my portfolio.
Ouch day - blew through a lot of stops today.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smart-money-groupon-inc-grpn-002117482.html
This dog drops 50% tomorrow.
Grpn continues to fall. J ad JOHN continue to worship it
"If Alibaba still holds Groupon, Jack Ma would not let this opportunity pass by. Alibaba could just buy the rest of Groupon for chump change."
wow....interesting....as per yahoo finance.....GRPN has 1.09 cash per share......lets see how bad can it be......Groupon accept a buyout or a tleast liquidate....we may get more money than the market price.....
"Brad, you can't denied that it's on bullish trend, but #$%$ news about buying trash company could change! Hope it's rumor only!!"
not many options be traded which says traders are holding the stock and not buying options. Probably a sale of the company is in store . Go GRPN
This should be a $7 billion company.. come on bulls. Start buying!!

"Grpn used to have $14 cash per share., now it has only $5.32 cash per share. It burned a lot of cash in the past 2 qtrs. The pandemic is killing its business. Its model is no longer accepted by today's life style. It needs a big change. When the market corrects, it will drop below $10!"
Going to a all time low of $1.40 to $1.50
No news just selling volume disapating. The IBM news is old and meaningless. The deal will come when you least expect. The only interesting thing will be how they address the rumors in the quarterly call if there is not deal by then. GLTA
We now know why the stock spiked with significant volume on 12-12. See link...https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1066867/000119312518356302/d670400dsc13g.htm

"All fantasy. Reality is that Grpn isnt gonna be bought out. Not anytime soon at least. We are entering a bear market with huge sell offs coming. Short the market, including GRPN. amazon had a blowout earnings call and still went down...the bears are coming out of hibernation"
GRPN misses by .02 beats revenue by 13 million guides higher for the year. .07 eps 873.17 revenue
Spike in volume is on in the last 20 minutes
Groupon has great deals on music concerts. saved 50% on tix compared to ticketmsster for 2 different concerts this year.thanks Groupon!
"11/13/19 (WED) - This message board is boring. Where are the real traders and investors for GRPN? If I took out all the posts from the Puffer triplets (John, Brad, & Hari), then I could go without checking this board for a week and still not miss a single thing of importance."
the lawsuit thought it was gonna slow this tiger down.. nope! reason have a bullish run because it has something value... soon we back up $1.45+ this week or Monday+https://www.quora.com/How-can-Groupon-GRPN-perform-better-to-increase-the-stock-price
One hour to go and my prediction of 8.2M shares traded needs a big close. GRPN volume stands at 4.9M. so let's rev the engines and get those 3.3M shares traded (hopefully more interest on the buy side)!

"Much to the chagrin and disappointment of shorts and naysayers, post ER this stock has taken on a new personality. I believe the aroma of freshly cut stimulus checks and the evaporation of lock down mentality has suddenly made GRPN a favorable place to be. For now, the market seems to agree."

$5.00 per share by Mid-august
"Since Groupon is the 2nd largest on-line goods company after Amazon, it would make sense if a large retailer bought them for their on-line expertise. I could see JC Penny buying them and using their stores as wharehouses to ship the goods, it would get them into a position to compete with Amazon quickly."
I can see GRPN going to $3.00 within 1 year.
"I been using groupon for years and its save me a ton, specially on services"
"Serious question please, how many down day left? It is already 6 without green, it's kind rare"
https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2020/06/10/groupon-plans-reverse-stock-split-to.html
"This company can be huge, they need a bigger cap ex budget to develop thier tech. They need to not the business onto a travel company ie Airbnb or Expedia. Etc."
"I bought before the last earning at $ 3, after the price dropped to $ 0.5, I injected each drop, I had the average of $ 1.7, and I sold all at $ 1.77 last week :) good luck"
Down today....?
It makes absolutely no sense how their ER could be good. I smell some books being cooked
"Looks like it hit my target of under $20 one trading day later than I predicted. I hope this runs up some before their Q2 earnings release, so I can short it again."
"let it hit a 52 week high -- if that happens, then make some news about it.."
WALMART
It's up 5 cents!!! Buyout coming!!! HAHAHAHA
"if this path continue i am afraid GRPN will need soon another reverse split when share reach $ 1 however, this time any reverse will remain with no value"
Buyout soon? Market cap low. 2.4 billion.
Bought it at 1.77. God do I hope this rebounds. Hoping the insane volume work contribute. Some traders bought millions after the drop.
selling pressure. some investors really want to get out. We need more new buyers.
"New PT coming soon, IMO $5"
"Its Groupons Board of Directors turn to spark the new ideas and innovations that will get this company and this board talking again, in the meantime there is really nothing to say. Low volume during the first half of the morning daily now since reporting 4th quarter ...."
l00k at the bright side its falling slower
This stock is up almost $8?Isnt the loss per share also almost $8Amazing! Absolutely amazing!
coupons
I use Groupon all the time and I believe GRPN can be rewarding in long run.
"FWIW, short interest decreased slightly to 47.8M shares."
Little run before the big dropWatch!
"I see less and less groupon deals... especially restaurants, i guess they all think it doesn't make sense to put their business on groupon due to non-repeat customers."
"Someone just purchased 400,000 shares. Nice popSomethings up"
If we don't see news on sales we better hold tight until earnings it may get a bit shaky. GO GRPN!
"Also one word nobody mentioned yet. MONOPOLY. Groupon is the local experiences' monopoly...it is a huge market and Groupon owns it. That is why 5x-10x is REALISTIC.That is why techs dropped 12%, Groupon gained 50%. Just the beginning. Stay greedy my friends"
Who want to make money because the door is opening up.
.01 Isn't it time for you to get Brad at the Shrinks office!!
"Don’t listen to negative nellies.. market will LOVE this Great move buying yelp.. $200 mm in cost cutting synergies , cross selling, should finally return grpn to growth ..."
Lot of Volume very early.
"What's your opinion of the CEO? What advice do you have for management? Share here, & if it's valid, I will pass it along."
I was glad to hear that Groupon replaced their advertising agency. Hopefully they will not use the same spokesperson.
2.88 does not get paid for his posts when the needle is moving up ..
Haha its funny how everyone is against this stock.I cant wait for it to pop so you all go away with nothing to say
Any news if they have a buyer?
@brad where are you?
Gonna bust thru $4 after er tmrw! You read it here first!!!
dorsey must go
Anthony must be related to John/Ji
U guys seen pre market
Would love to see $4.50
"I will buy more at $63... unless it blows past it and runs to 84... big buyer is about to be disclosed on march 12,,, remember when it jumped up to $5.50 per split.. no more rumors -- costs are down... profit is going to be up!! BABA, FB, ABAB.. just to name a few who want this company ,,, and a ticket monster sale would drive this to $160..."
"ER is scheduled for 4:10 ET, so we might see some decent AH reaction, even though this stock does not have very heavy average volume..."
"10% only.. contact Groupon customer service, they greet you with. We have a lovely day here at Groupon !! Seriously don't they know they are killing the company!!"
GRPN is definitely one to watch. Especially at current levels. Keeping my eyes on it for any buy opportunity comes up. Watching it and also this other stock as well https://financialfreedom.news/v3va2
this new CEO is even worse imho
https://cweb.com/cweb-groupon-acquires-cloud-savings-company-ltd/
Some good opportunities right here!
Again. 88% is owned by insiders/ institutions. Of the remaining 12% half is short. This is why it is so heavily manipulated.
Nice action!!
Huge crash after market. Still have the insiders propping this dog up.
John and J. I told you going to 3’s you laughed Going to 2’s you laughedYou still laughing??
The market Dow is down for tomorrow
I'm buying on this pullback here. Using money from the notes offering to pay down debt or refinance seems like a great idea to me. Makes the balance sheet even more solid.
"I'm afraid that experiences are of the menu for next couple of months, as no one wants to experience a Corona infection... really quite an unfortunate situation for Groupon."
GRPN just became a WALL STREET DARLING.That means shorts will be crushed and longs will be rewarded with a well deserved spike.Earnings will pleasantly surprise and shock the world.
Up thirty cents. Not sure if it will hold as short sellers unload by EOD.
back to back 4-5% up is not pump and dump!
J the genius losing daily but still in love with his grpn
"Read about how Groupon issued ""Groupon bucks"" in place of Refunds back to credit cards.. That people is the ONLY reason the company had ANY revenue !"
"This is how to trade: Identify a stock that is in ""zombie"" mode but for whatever crazy reason has run up in price, then Short it just before earnings release. A classic play right here, utilyzing my strategy and system, that only works 75% of the time. But that's good enough for me!"
Wow look at premarket
Analysts don't know GRPN stock price has been manipulated and controlled by one super hacker.
Shorts are coming for this tomorrow
Dow future is up 220 points and Nasdaq is up 72 points. I look forward to our stock to $100 before 4th of July and $80 before Easter.
On its way to the1's but JOHN and J stand proud 
WATCH GRPN for a possible breakout above 5.07Target: 5.73 - Excellent
"Unless Groupon starts telling what is working for them we will see this stock move sideways. Thats the only way the day traders will make any profit.Its not hard to see why then daily trade averages 20% of the general public float .And i disgree ""nothing"" is working for them ..We have been hearing that since the day of the IPO and GRPN is still here. Unless you have run out of patience , longs stay long. Any good news will take this stock which is heavily manipulated to very high."
"41 million active costumers is based on one purchase a month of what? a $5 jewelry? I used Groupon in the past buying restaurant deals, activities, massages. Are people able to even use those deals with the Covid-19 situation? The answer is no.Now, I haven't bought anything since March. Also had to get a credit for the deals I purchased in my Groupon buck.For the last 6 months, I have been trying to find something worthy to get for my credit and there has been nothing worthy to buy from their website. Are they counting me as an active costumer because I logged in ?? It's much easier for me to buy thing from amazon.Do you think they even have a chance to compete with big ecommerce companies?Yesterday action reminds me of pump and dump of KODK recently."
Buy out imminent!
"@samuil @Lee Did you bagholders expect this to gap up on bad earnings, and bad fundamentals?"
"just a bad DNA within this company...bought an item for 199 and the PROMO code did not take...then immediately repurchased the same exact item and the promo code was accepted...now they REFUSE to return my $199.00 no one to speak to in the USA, so this is not how you keep customers."
"Where is the guy ""J"" with the Dr. Seuss character avatar? The rebalancing event is over for the Russell. I am curious as to the next round of excuses for GRPN's stock performance. As FER and others, including myself, have mentioned this over the past 3-4 years has traded very predictably. I wouldn't be surprised if it tests the $4.15 support and eventually the dreaded $3.90 level."
Jump in before earnings?
Lets Do it
GRPN is down -10.58% to 4.65
"grpn will go to 0.0 very soon as nobody is buying at groupon. Goods Closed, massage, spa, restaurants, travel-- all banned!"
J and JOHN aka Laurel and Hardy here come the 2's
"Sell in the morning, buy in the afternoon....buy buy buy"
"Did any of those legal buzzards, have a first hearing in court yet or even serve GRPN with papers?? anyone know"
It makes sense that a company such as IAC or Alibaba (who took a 6% share in Groupon) would be interested in acquiring Groupon -- if for the active customers more than anything else. I just hope it sells at a fair price. I don't want IAC using a Groupon to acquire Groupon.
"Shorts should have known when the co-founder dumped millions of his own cash back into the company with huge insider buys, there was something good in the works."
6 please Cmon!
"Google apparently offered to buy snap last year for $30B ( about 26/share). That was probably before Instagram killed snap. Now $GOOGL would maybe buy it for $4/share max. Remember, Google's the same company that tried to buy $GRPN for an insanely high price and was also ( luckily for Google shareholders ) rebuffed by that company's greedy and stupid CEO."
The stock hasn't dropped. It's a reverse stock split. Stock is rallying actually
"Someone is trying to keep the price down again, they will probably do another huge market order near the end of the day again so they can unload their 5.00 put options and or have the 5.00 call options they sold expire worthless. Expect more of the same tomorrow then massive short covering come Monday. Just my two cents since I trade often. Long term holders can ignore the price action for now and go enjoy the weather. I’m going to the Indy Car race tomorrow if you want to make some $ Buy at the end of the day Friday and sell on next weeks rally."
I bought more today.
Brad and .01 at the Shrinks today getting their Prescription refilled..Puffing not cutting it!!
FOSL we are not
Down nearly 4% on pretty high volume .i don’t see any news out there. Was there a downgrade or is this the shorts being nervous about GRPN breaking out above the 200DMA?
GRPN is up 10.09% to 4.80
GRPN is up 6.75% to $3.48
Smell fishy
Looks like FER is gone along with all of his/her associated posts.
Slow and steady!
"Over $6 tomorrow, obviously"
waiting for a breakout to sell and buy again on the natural sell-off diphttps://nasdaqnewsfeed.com/2020/01/23/still-not-convinced-about-groupon-inc-nasdaq-grpn-2/
"They only had to pay 1/2 the amount to IBM, they admitted using the patent so that is as good as could have been expected. No earnings date yet. Nothing stopping a buyout from happening now. New could happen anytime. If they work over the weekend to finalize could be Monday pre market."
All the best guys.. see you tomorrow morning!!
June 2 is now showing earnings from Charles Schwab
it is hard to swallow that they still have a billion in revenue. and only are worth a billion. merger/buyout best hope for cost cutting and revenue growth. whoever is willing to buy this company will get there money back from its untapped asset aka ticket monster.. this is money in the bank at this price.
BABA!
holding pretty strong with good volume !!
will surpass 52 week high todayy....GREAT TIME TO BUY....Who doesn't buy from groupon...even my Mom spends a lot with groupon!!!!!
Can someone please explain why the stock is going up after poor earnings?
Here comes the crash!!!
Looks like heading down to $2 I might get some at that price
#$%$ty to work with Groupon because they charge merchants way too much. But if they start turning things around and cut costs and eventually lower prices then I?m bullish. Groupon is by far the best way my business gets new customers and other business rely on it. Groupon is not going anywhere.
I am just hoping for a trading halt today !
Net loss from continuing operations of $15 million
"I’ve been tracking them for over a year now. They’ve struggled to get over the $5.00 mark. When the do, they’ve never been able to hold their position. Just when all hope is renewed, they’re back in the slumps of the $2/3 mark. #bearish"
Guilermo and ZeljanicaA match made in heaven
Brad and .01 are hiding under mom's basement!
institutions own 345 million shares of this. It has to go up.
"Grub Hub hit a home run and they are just food delivery but do it well apparently. They are up 20 bucks at near 90 bucks per share. GRPN is peanuts in comparison. Like Jack stated, need much more noise from Williams. Haven't seen a significant announcement in months. What investor can be excited about that? Food for thought."
it's gonna hurt!!
I think the problem is that amazon can easily get into this market as well if they wanted. Similar to their lightning sales but instead start offering services for local businesses that match what grpn offers. Amzn does have a bigger customer base than groupon.
did i just see green
I'm surprised this dog is not down more. 35% revenue drop? $7 a share LOSS
We will see a stead uptrend
"Good PR, and as covid shrinks, GRPN will CONTINUE to skyrocket. $100 by year end not far fetched."
Stock you must be related to John right?
Ji/John following me around everywhere Like a little puppy How cute is that
"Groupon inking deal with parkwhiz, to make parking easier, I've used groupon at airport parking, great deals!"
sinking I guess no takeover this year back to 3
Released this AM.....Cowen maintains a PT of $5.50 and a market perform rating. Likes the trends.
Brads crystal ball says bankruptcy again this week!! Poor Puffer!!
I'm ready for the move up tomorrow.....GO GRPN!
On its way to 15 John
"There goes that free stock I got for signing up to Robinhood, Down 40% Thanks but no thanks robinhood"
"why is GRPN up? Guillermo says why it took so long? GRPN is still trading less tha 1x sales, ridiculous...when you have other stocks easily trading 40-50x sales. So a 5x sales, would put GRPN at $200 a share. All they need to show is continuous improvement to the bottom line, and free cash flow.Stay greedy my friends."
All they have to do is beat $.01 1/2 cents - $.0.151 from previous years total of $.10cents./ meet or exceed $.10 1/2 cent. L.M.A.O!
"Full disclosure. While comparisons against $GRPN are made to the S&P500, it is NOT a member of that index and has never been.At $2.4bil it wouldn't meet market capitalization requirements of $5bil. It is however on the Russell 2000 index and meets listing minimums.I believed posters without fact checking first.Lastly, in my research of GRPN, the chance of BK is only 1 in 10, a 10% chance. Do your own research."
I got few share .hop to dubble in a month.
Well......they BEAT on revenue.!!
"$GRPN LEFKOFSKY ERIC P, 10%-owner,Director of Groupon, Inc. bought 250000 shares on 2020-06-18. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=GRPN"
I haven't looked at Groupon stock in years and I thought what the heck is it doing trading at $26 then I look at the Historical charge then I concluded there must have been a reverse split and of course there was a 1 for 20 the Boost the stock price they should have just left it alone I would have expected that it would be trading for the equivalent of about $2.60 a share since it always traded in the range of 2 to $4
Those pooooop on #s will be fantastic!!!!!!
Does anyone know when earnings are supposed to be released? Seen all sorts of different dates mentioned?
"Green, green where are you."
JOHN pumps. Stock dumps
I’m a Groupon select customer and Groupon makes it impossible to cancel your account. No wonder they are in the position they are in. I’m not sure why anyone would want to own this long term.
JOHN you celebrating 3.01
This is a stock you should short... They rob you... Paid for a sub to the WSJ and did not provide it. Called WSJ and they said they had no record of my purchase.. I followed directions. There is no number to call Groupon.....The E mail address is no longer active...No wonder this is a two dollar stock...
John how you feeling these days with the huge amount of grpn shares you own??
"They are bleeding cash, they burned 213 million in one q they have 700 mil left with 150mil of that on credit all this report showed us was if they keep bleeding they will be BK in 2-3 quarters without external funding I picked up 6/19 23p this morning at .05 cents and rode them to a 1.50$ you guys do the DD learn why stocks tank before it happens"
Maybe grubhub is interested!!
shorting this after reverse. yiu will never see your money after this does a reverse. reverse is never a good thing. never
"hoping to catch a dead cat bounce here, jump in now or next week?"
Anyone on this board think GRPN can benefit from issuing their own credit card like AMZN and do something innovative as a tool to drive up revenues?
Interesting pattern of large volume sell orders 15 minutes after the market opens. This has been a fairly consistent practice over the last 3-4 weeks. Then there are two other similar trades late AM and mid afternoon. Anywhere from 150K-500K of shares traded. I don't know if s means anything in the grand scheme of things but it is fairly obvious as you watch the activity throughout the day.
.01? Brad? Must of booked a double session at the shrinks!!
Hari/John you forgot to add “ puffer”
GRPN is up 15.69% to 1.18
GRPN is down -100.00% to 0.00
"Selling already dried off. Volume today half daily volume, recovered almost $1 from daily bottom.Let the short covering begin!Yes if you shorted at $34 you made $5, awesome, now going up $20, which one direction is more profitable? Tough question, LOL"
There still can be a buyer......just not today......
see my previous post
"What a LOSER company. A lot of these buys were electronic - antipating more. LOSS....loss of $9.3 million in its second quarter.Did I say LOSS - AGAIN. Was supposed to be breakeven on a per-share basis. Revenue of $662.6 million in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Seven analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $669.5 million."
RIP Tom Petty. 'Cause I'm free falling...
GRPN is up 17.29% to 0.86
Bullish trend continues!!!
"Hey, Purearnings short seller, please let us know in advance where you and the gypsies will be setting up your next short camp."
I guess the toilet paper is a hot goods item!
"Groupon stock is definitely & clearly NOT at any risk of being delisted. Google the ""NASDAQ's minimum bid price requirement"" for yourself. :)"
Board just not the same without John and his old truck
"Yahoo is showing earnings call is today. Either way it’s a winner. It either pops, or gets dumped down by 20% or 30%. It’s still a multi billion revenue generating company. Imagine getting in at .75 and holding long term. Once the stay at home is l lifted businesses will be looking to Groupon to rebuild their customer base."
I think MS is controlling stock price....
John and J how you enjoying the 2’s I warned you about and you laughed about??Oh wait you’re loading up rightBoth of you have lost big time here 
"Calm down Brad the Puffer its gonna be ok, your incessant posting is not helping your mental state!!"
"Groupon makes money, no chance for bankruptcy! Traffic will rise, because new partnerships with Expedia, mlb, ticketcompanys and more. Groupon+ creates a stronger relationship to the customers. CEO and shareholders will rewarded big time in the next quarters."
Is there going to be an up day soon. Please someone tell me.
Rated T for teens.
I agree completly -Groupon has changed they business model in a good way. I'm buying more. This is a huge opportunity.Very Bullish and Gap Up open is coming by 10$...
20% down in the last month when the market has been rolling doesn't exactly exude investor confidence. Any thoughts from the gurus?
Wait till those 2nd quarter #s......when does this company fold? and that is WHEN
"Shorts trapped here, hence all the negative comments. Check back in 1 hour, you might be surprised."
The upside potential for GRPN just got a whole lot more interesting. https://awesomestockalerts2.blogspot.com/ recently alerted this company i think. google them.
"should i sell or hold the bag, Im in the 5's?"
@John I hope you adjusted your portfolio!! I am bit worried about Puffer Brad!!
Whats up with everyone making the same post? Looks fishy to me.
"Hiring a lot in Chicago! They might want to put that on hold for a while. The price is getting juicy for takeover, might happen sooner than later for companies wanting to compete with AMZN."
Y/Y means very little to a company that reorganizing and now having a better profit margin and direction
What's a better buy...Facebook at their haircut number (given their stability). Or...Groupon given the potential explosive upside?
Will someone please give some attention to John!Jeesh it can’t always be me helping the old and sick
Lee tells you“ Groupon will most likely double by end of year . Don’t miss your opportunity to buy it now”LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!
red because they pushed back earnings date?
"Guillermo is laughing while seeing all these amateur shorting traders posting here nonsense...guys you are clueless going against alibaba, vanguard, billionaire insiders...this stock is equivalent to pre-split $1.25, which is NOTHING for projected cash, revenues, EBITDA. Fair price today (pre split) should be AT LEAST 2 bucks which is $40 post split. So if you short at $40, OK Guillermo could tell you, you guys have a chance to make a couple of bucks. But here at $25 ($1.25)? Are you insane? You will get steam-rolled, LOL. Good luck you will need it. This is going to $40 FIRST, then we will see if there is further progress (and disclosure: THERE WILL BE QUITE A BIT). Then $60 and easily $90 by Q4... Again, WRONG stock to short, WRONG. Go back to the library and open a random book of economy.."
Where are the analyst upgrades?
BaBa.......Please!
yay were at a buck!new management needs to announce initiatives to restore the company.
Tried using groupons a few years back. It was not good. Stock price makes sense.
You bought this stock based on emotions?
Do I hear $30/shr? Or $1.50/shr pre-split? This is possible today!
6.3M shares traded and another 500K settled in AH. That's 3M shares in 45 minutes.
Will someone please speak to our little Guilermo this is getting sad now
J bought 10k at 3.15On top of his other buys he is now blood red
Is there other news that came in ? Why the sell off ?
Here come the 3's
J and JOHN salivating over their grpn shares
My back of the envelope math calculates if the stock trades at cash levels it could go down as low as $1.40 per share.
markets down 600 dont think they have any chance of being higher than a $1 with 50% cut in numbers across the board on the balance sheet
"Any idea what's going on today? We are right at our typical volume today (15MM shares traded), with 19MM shares reported as short. It doesn't seem like a squeeze, but maybe...?"
Pretty simple e-mail address: rich@groupon.com - public company. Want the board?
no upside.. sell and never buy the stock... just buy the groupons only part of the company that will give you value..
"There will be a rude awakening for those, here, that claim to understand buyout candidates...when it gets done! Share price means squat. These deals are orchestrated based on comps (sector tier 1 preferred) and only comps. I take that back. High dollar research reports are used as well (costing $100k & up). Share price is illusion created by mm's, or spec, to increase their inventory as [cough] more reasonable (greed) prices! Period!"
R2 down 1.5 % today it's getting smoked
3 months and it will be back to 3
"back to the 4's.....people will get hurt....they never learn...but, it is still excitingWow!"
why is rich Williams still there?
Groupon was $54 after the earning beat. I guess that many took profit. This stock is still so cheap. I am not selling because it has been beating earning steadily. The management has a very good leadership and long term the stock price will continue improving to $75. Keep in mind that this shall be over $200 if without the reverse split.
"Hated the drop, love the turn around......GO GRPN!"
BUY DPW I SAID THIS 3 DAYS AGO
soon this will be $5+
"Do not understand the sell off, would think holding till the 14th"
Earnings leak? $4.49 and suddenly $4.74
It's time to fire the CEO and some....

"Groupon, Inc. operates online local commerce marketplaces that connect merchants to consumers by offering goods and services at a discount in North America and internationally. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank 1. In the last 30 days, one earnings estimate moved north, while none moved south for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings rose 4.3% in the same period. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 118.2% compared with the Internet - Commerce industry’s estimated rally of 11.1%. You can see"
"Dec options expired, this will be on the run next week. Glad the big boys kept this under 40 so I got to keep my stock. Fridays action was all about options and keeping it under the 40$ strike. Let it run to 50 now."
"Getting closer to $23.00! Come on baby, just do it! I believe in you and 23 is a BEAUTIFUL number! :-)"
J and JOHN going down with ship. They stand tall and proud 
I heard about GRPN the other day on http://greatpix.xyz. It’s looking like an interesting play.
One way we can think if Groupon will bring deals like other travel sites than we can expect stock jump of 10X. But not sure how groupon had partnered with Derbysoft!! :D
"if Groupon does not have any black friday deals, like for goods.. As they did last year... this will be a better short than last years drop!! $5 is the target, if they do not have products that folks want to buy.... Short with every last $$$'s you have holding this #$%$.. Since they lost Starbucks as a customer it has been a very steep decline.... get them back and I will close my shorts..."
A possible buy out??
"Interesting volume pattern....if you review trading since earnings, there are volume spikes during the final hour of trading. This practice has occurred frequently over the past 24 months. In some cases hundreds of thousands of shares trade settle after the close. Not sure what this means. Chart is indicating a bit of positive momentum now that the gap has been filled."
"Looks like it will be a bad day for the cruise line sector. CCL is down a lot PM, bad news on when sailings will resume for another cruise line, + negative analyst comments specific to CCL. I've been eyeing CCL as an attractive Pure Earnings Short Sell, but if she drops a lot today, I will of course re-evaluate the play, specifically regarding risk/reward ratio. Meanwhile, things are quiet for GRPN, no surprise as this stock typically trades very little outside of the regular market session. I continue to expect a sell-off today and I will not be eager to take profit early as I think the stock is more than likely to decline throughout the day. Happily Short!"
"AR and Brad are here, .01 must have not made it back from the shrinks office yet!!"
"December mid month short data will be released after today's close. I expect an increase based on the recent stock performance. Speaking of the stock, nice rally yesterday after a horrible first half of the day. Stock finished strong. Hopefully this will be a new base with an upward trend going forward."
Unfortunately this will be a day trader stock 3-3.25 for a while until it closes over 3.25..
70K shares out for now.. Thank You GRPN..
THIS IS HUGE: I was able to use bitcoin today on GRPN to purchase tickets for trip to Italy for four people. How come there has been no announcement of this from GRPN? Clearly this is big news if they are taking crypto-curriencies.
UBS price target raised from $4.15 to $5.50
Is anyone seeing ads for Groupon plus? I’m not sure if they are getting the word out that you don’t need to have a voucher any longer. I hope they are advertising on the dating sites. Can anyone confirm that? I’m holding over 5000 shares I bought in the 4’s this .09 has me a bit worried but the whisper number is .12
1 dollar up tomorrow morning
Only 1.4M shares traded more than halfway through today's trading session. Light volume with just one week to go before earnings. Tough at this point to predict anything other than the technical. Need to stay above 4.61 and move past 5.14 and ultimately 5.35 if GRPN is to attain that next leg up.
"Credit Suisse?s Stephen #$%$ wrote in a #$%$ne 18 report that he saw ?early signs of stabilization? for Groupon, and maintained both his Neutral rating and $32 price target."
"1.17 .. time to cover GRPN and GE short remember the old saying ..”pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered”"
Hari tells you “Buckle up it's time to take off......”LOL!!!!!!!!!!
"I admit I exited 95% of my positions in GRPN on Friday. There are other Investment Names with more positive outlooks available to trade. IMO, GRPN needs to do an Elon Musk/Tesla fiasco and announce that they want 'go private' so that they can killed their business 'in Private'."
"I thought this was a Groupon information site, instead it's a circus site."
Looks like Eric decided to double up on his previously scheduled sales of GRPN and sold 3M shares this period. How does that the longs feel when the COB not only continues to sell but accelerates his selling at lower prices?
Even as a Bear I don't think BK is inevitable. Debt load of 45% seems under control. There are declining revenues...and raising expenses. Amazon dominates online sales. What about Groupon Europe? Not much detail available online.What about that $2.26 low in 2015? Someone will buy the remains of this company at the right price. Somewhere between $2-3 would be my guess.
BUY BUY BUY. Fair price $50 a share NOW. Anything lower is simply ridiculous.
"Nice move yesterday on good volume. Today will be interesting to watch. Late trades yesterday pointed to the downside while money flow suggested a bullish move. With the market closed on Monday I suspect higher volumes again today. Pre market action indicates the stock to be down slightly though I do not put to much into what happens during this period. I watch but rarely take action unless there is definitive news.Speaking of news GRPN has been relatively silent in the last 30 days. Many retailers have brick & mortars have shared holiday results with some of the big names like Kohl's, Nordstroms stating that holiday sales were above forecast. Let's hope GRPN also had a good season."
Short interest data will be released after the market closes today. As of 1-15 there are 44M shares short.The stock is in a free fall. I don't believe there will be much change. We can only hope for a short squeeze next week after earnings.
J kicking back drinking his koolaid. Even when it goes to the 1's he still won't worry
FER - call out some numbers - I won't troll you for it. I am too happy today.
wow no profit throughout the year.. and up 50% is the whole Rob IN HOOD that crazy.. time to SHORT.. PUT this for later this year.. the valuation is off the charts at price above 20.
Wow...the ask is getting hit hard. Just the opposite of earlier today. 10 blocks of 100K just went through....
Rumor is there is a deal coming and there finalizing. We shall see. Time will tell
This was an email from Grouponto all store portals
same thing happened last quarter. beat eps.. opened higher... closed down 30%. ready for this to fall tommorow
OK...the volume has returned however so has a bit of the manipulation. We shall see how the day turns out.
3 dollars here we come
"Vetr is a crowd sourced ratings firm. Kind of like a Yelp for equity investments. I wouldn't put to much credit or weight on their ratings. The bottom line is the fundamentals are improving, the technical look good and the management continues to concentrate on the metrics that will drive a higher stock price.One last thing, the entire management team has a sizeab"
"Alibaba Holding Ltd 5.7% passive stake in GRPN is a formidable catalyst, IMO..."
they should buy back 300M shares on the cheap.. The founders seem to not be behind this. they should give groupon the $150M to do it. Good leaders when making these big shifts need to double down. Is the board not buy this stock. WFC's CEO bought $600k worth on the open market-which was 20000 shares. come on Rich W. make some money! should come out stronger during this crisis
We could see $3.95 today if the market continues the current trend and any large seller steps in. Unfortunately the chart is just awful. The technical on all fronts are not in favor of long investors. Fundamentals are what they are based on the last earnings call.
"I'm not selling . I learned my lesson with AMD and left a lot on the table. Don't listen to #$%$, earnings were just ok and did not deserve a move up. It is oversold today, so hey rebound is in the cards, good product and now a little advertising will likely spread the word."
A steady climb begins. GRPN offers a huge opportunity whether with or without buyout. The brand grows and becomes more valuable.
I say 6 to $10
very disappointing end after a splendid start.
"Over reaction!! They beat on Revenue and still made a profit and settled the ibm lawsuit..How many times did they beat on bottom line but because they came short on revenue stock got hammered, now its the opposite...Buy Buy Buy"

"Anyone else accumulating shares here? I bought some more at 4.50, 4.31 and just now at 4.185"
Bad quarterly #s leaked......ouch
A lot of buys coming after them not denying that the company is for sale
What a dog. ALL revenues down. ALL numbers DOWN.
Well this is nice I can buy some more now...
Loading up the Truck!!
I guess staying above 5 bucks is too much to ask of wall street. Best hope for longs might be a buyout.
"the shorts will bring the price down, they always do. that's what happened to ENPH and CRON. best to wait for a dip to $4.25 before buying."
Garbage....no need to say more.
Intelsat at $3..........now $4.40+
"This thing is going to be dumped big time right before close, after hours, or Monday am"
"It looks like we have an ""Albert Einstein"" on board here, folk, by the name of Barry. The apparent IQ is astonishing!Barry: Thank you for your unselfish concern regarding a stock that you have no interest in. It's much appreciated."

10/28/16Piper Jaffray Cos. Reiterates Groupon (GRPN) Overweight $6.50
I picked up some more today. They blew away earnings last quarter and that was without the AMEX deal. I don’t see any reason they won’t beat earnings again. Customers paying sales tax arent going to affect purchases less than $100. Especially since all websites will be charging the tax. Only other alternative is to drive to the store and loon around for what you wanted.
"Dan here mentioned another stock HOME as a comparison.Let Guillermo here give a little finance lesson (not to Dan just in general):HOME: market cap $1.2B. , Revenues $1.2B, Ratio: 1Groupon: market cap $800M. Revenues $1.5B (PROJECTED), Ratio: 0.5HOME: sector home decor, average Market cap/REVENUES ratio: 1.GROUPON: sector TECHNOLOGY, average Market cap/Revenues ratio: 10-100.Now if Groupon becomes HIGHLY PROFITABLE as with the (NEW, UNPRECEDENTED, MAJOR) changes the new CEO started implementing, an AVERAGE 5 ratio is not far fetched.5 ratio would mean a $300 stock price (today we are at 0.5 ratio, so 5 is 10 times today's market cap, assuming NON GROWING revenues). Yes it seems like insane, but it is TOTALLY POSSIBLE. Remember also that as covid shrinks tons of restaurants/local businesses will need groupon. So revenues actually may start skyrocketing.So when Guillermo said $100 price target, that was CONSERVATIVE (it is $5 a share. Let's remember this business has traded as high as $20 during economy recoveries). You are lucky if you are reading this because you are witnessing the beginning of an EXPONENTIAL TRAJECTORY STOCK PRICE."
After earnings GRPN will be a 5-7 dollar stock.....
This is very bearish but not swelling
Short interest decreased slightly by about 2M shares to 34.7M shares overall. This represents almost 7 percent of the float. Let's see how today goes. GRPN needs to hold 4.61 and climb past 5.14 and eventually 5.35 to move higher.
"Be very patient, longs. This is the real business and real strong business this year. It will go much much higher."
Someone sold....& ...Someone Bought.....Right....we will find out in 15 minutes...when the market closes??????? Godd Luck
up 5% AH to 4.51?!!
FER...ARE YOU SHORT GROUPON?Simple question and deserves an honest answer.
When the crash first started a person on CNBC said that we would see a 12 percent decline - I should have listened. If I were a betting man I would say the wash-out is today or Monday - a lot of co-workers put sell orders in today on the 401k .... giving-up...
"Fact, The largest and most successful hedge fund in history has a position (long) in Groupon. Fact, this same hedge added 7 mil shares in June/2018. Fact, their position now almost equals that of Vanguard and Baba.Who? The King of hedges, Black Rock"
"feel free to short Groupon but dont cry if you lose a ton of money. Groupon business model has changed. Groupon is selling the experience this include goods, trip discount, etc.Im pretty bullish about this stock"
"Before you dump the stock and take a loss, consider this:GRPN just had a reverse stock split - 20 shares to 1. This has automatically eliminated penny stock day traders. The current outstanding shares are just about 25 million. This is relatively very small. Once you get institutional investors come in, the supply and demand consideration will kick in. They have a good business model and they will do well. Nevertheless, the decision is yours."

"does anyone notice the stock sitting on the moving avg line for ever, shorts love this its a zero plus tick until there done and then its lifts, the better hope they have a lot to go."
The end is getting closer. T-minus .97 and counting. I hope Rich Williams is proud of what he and his team of this debacle. He should be walked out the door immediately! My condolences to all those who have held in hopes for a turnaround. Sell what you can. This company will be gone by EOY 2021.
The positive earnings report from GOOG heightened speculation they may be a suitor --large Monday after-hours buying and Tuesday pre-market buying suggests there is smoke ---we will see if there is fire.
"Does anyone think the will make .13 this quarter? Last year they expected .09 and they made .07 so .13 is almost double. Not trying to be a naysayer, but I’m just not seeing it although it is certainly possible."

At this rate I be happy with anything over $4 a share buyout. How to kill a company unbelievable

"The multiple alias train has arrived. The BS is spewing at a rapid pace. If there was a buyer for GRPN or if it is truly for sale, then why didn't Williams and other execs buy shares 6, 12 or even 18 months ago. Why is Lefkofsky continuously selling 3M shares every quarter? I guess he need $3M a month for living expenses."
looks to be about to bust out of a massive cup and handle..... and conferences could be the catalyst
"$8 is now in sight in 2018. I've been an investor for 4 years and I can be wrong but I believe the chance is extremely high. All we need is 1) increase in revenues guidance (possible thanks to new acquisition and AMEX deal)2) continue profit or at least Break Even (very possible thanks to Groupon+ which could push profit margin to level Groupon has never seen).3) increased cashflow (which is happening already)Based on #1 and #2, #3 stock should this time break above $6 first and later in October touch $8 . From there we might go to retest $12 in 2019.Yes we've been stuck around $5 but that is normal. The company needed to clean the balance sheet, and become ""lean"". Now that is has been accomplished, any deal (like Amex or VocherCloud) can literally make the stock price double. Why? Just based on the additional cashflow and revenues.GLTA"

"Apparently GRPN shareholders are in a bit of conundrum. The market isn't buying what Groupon is selling and the GRPN management team doesn't appear to be interested in moving the share price higher. Look at the lack of announcements and direction from the company. The only bit of commentary since the earnings release was the JP Morgan investor conference. All of what was said was just a reiteration of the company's strategy. Again, the market doesn't appear to be buying what GRPN is selling.It's time for Rich Williams and company to do something. Otherwise as some n this board have stated this company will erode into another Living Social.All in all its truly a shame. The company has potential. Just don't think the leadership can drive the value that shareholders seek."

"Piper Jaffray's Sam Kemp maintains an Overweight rating on Groupon's stock with an unchanged $6.25 price target.Groupon's stock fell as much #$%$ percent Tuesday after third party data suggested the company's November performance was weak, Kemp said in a note. The problem is that third-party scraping data has proven itself to be ""ineffective"" given the company's focus on Groupon+ and complete data can not be collected by third parAs Groupon+ becomes more successful over time, the company will actually see lower engagement of traditional vouchers which is what third party data gathers collect, the analyst said. In other words, it's likely weak trends are ""actually suggesting strong adoption of Groupon+ (a good thing).""Groupon is expected to show a strong performance in the fourth quarter due to higher marketing spend, momentum in customer frequency which started in the fourth quarter, the re-platforming of LivingSocial, early signs of success in Groupon+, and an overall branding campaign."

Who or what is preventing a buyout? Any thoughts from this board?
good news that they released their earnings date announcement. If they were going to disappoint they would have put out a release prior to announcing earnings date. So could be a positive earnings surprise.
It's a new year for Groupon. This company is finally focused in the right places. The stock price is going to catch up. I am holding because I believe in this model. Many of my family and friends LOVE groupon coupons.

"I am watching GRPN closely and while I was a bit hesitant a few days ago, today's bizarre 14+% upside move so far, has convinced me to do a Pure Earnings play on this Bloated Baby. As long as this stays above $26.50 I plan to Selling Short GRPN just before market close today, to hold through earnings release. Stock is significantly over-valued, business model appears to be failing, company was in big trouble even before the virus hit and I do not see anything to suggest a bright future or a good ER. I think this will miss consensus on EPS and Revenue and I expect a big nosedive, probably to the $22-$24 level, as a direct market response in the AH session today and the regular session tomorrow. Excellent risk/reward ratio on this one, most especially given the huge run-up today. What a gift!"

"How much more does this get beaten down? This is a company with almost $1 billion in cash, and $1.5 billion in sales. Yet, market cap values it at barely $2 billion. I realize it is fun for pigs to bash the dot com sector. But, what am I missing in terms of valuation here? I understand growth has stalled miserably, but this is a real business with money, sales and revenues worth far more than the current stock price."

Keep selling. The stock was here when they announced Q3 earnings incase you forgot.
"Looking at the filing, losses close to doubled since 2019?"

People really utilize this service but its advertising doesnt seem to be strategically targeted. They will figure it out. Either by existing mgmt or by new blood. This name is almost as popular as google and once marketing is figured out the stock price will follow. Give it 9 months and I truly think you could see a double or more.

This dog should be close to zero after those earnings loses. 2nd Quarter will be HORRIFIC. Who the hell lent them money?

SSR in effect tomorrow. I think it's gonna spike up very early in the morning tomorrow. Might do you some good recouping a portion of your losses buying it ~10mins before close and selling it early tomorrow for some margin - don't hold for too long.
Bad times once again for Groupon..
This will be the 1st earnings report in 2 years that I don’t own any shares. I’m just not seeing how they make .13 cents. If past history is any indication the stock will likely drop back to the low 3s high 2s. But I could be completely wrong and they somehow meet/beat .13 even though they only made .07 last year in Q4 which means they have to have 90% profit growth year over year.
John just got the waiter at Denny’s He’s lost it
Very confused by this drop. I want to call it manipulation and hope I'm right. The market is what it is. Come Back GRPN!
over 10% short momentum to the buy broke through 3.40 resistance 3.60 is next

Wow back to green.
What does this close at today?

"The voucher-less business is a game changer in terms of business model, with partners like AMEX, etc. the revenue ramp will be a difference maker when it gains traction."
very sad with the results and today's performance.. at least need some love from this company..
Morgan Stanley is playing the stock - smart - Had it not been one of the best holiday retail seasons plus the big impact the reduction in taxes will have on the company plus the addition of Groupon + then I would say the Morgan Stanley call was good.

"Looks like 16.50 is the next stop... if that dont hold, like 18.50 didnt hold, then you have nowhere to go but to 14.50. If that doesnt hold & buyers dont step up then your easily lookin at $10 again. Fundamentals are not in your favor here & the technicals are screaming SELL"

Bad news I just lost 44% Good news I have only 1 share Very good news it was a gift from Robin hood and they must have stolen it from someone extremely rich. What's not to like .Why cant they steal from Tesla?
Blowout
Groupon will start holding vendors' money for 60 days. Another words people who are selling at Groupon will have to wait 60 days to get paid. Unbelievable! I need to lower my average asap.
The post earnings performance of this stock is quite similar to prior quarters. With the stock now back at early July levels there could be more pain on the horizon. New short interest data will be released tomorrow after the close.
"J saidJust buy the company is sold, learn metrics,,,,,,,,,3.50,,,, babba"
"GRPN really didn't do anything about Jack Ma rumors. Since 2014 it's down 70%. Wallstreet isn't a fan for sure, I have listened to earning calls for 4-5 years, solid platform and I am former IT ORCL. They need do to GRPN of a car or truck, one color ( blk ) no extras.. Like the FORD Model-T.. They need get bought out and save the stock holders.. Cmon Man.. When baseball season :-)"
Can someone please confirm what their estimate EPS and Rev is? I am getting a lot of conflicting info. Is it -$1.91 EPS or -$3.42 ?
Buy and hope the new buyer will offer stock instead of cash.Anything is better than GRPN.
GRPN will see 4.82 today. Bank it.
Hope this stock hits $5 soon!
Buyout or merger is only way forward for GRPN. They have great brand recognition but they need different business model.

J it just keeps dropping. Tell us why?
"It's amazing to see the big moves with many stocks during the past couple of weeks. Best Buy, Guess, BlackBerry and so many others. Companies from a variety of sectors showing strength during this latest market run. I'm surprised by the apathy the leads at GRPN have shown preceding and since earnings. We all understand the strategy to focus on markets that will deliver a profitable return. We all understand they are working to streamline processes so each market doesn't function in a disparate manner. What I don't understand is how the company is looking at the bigger picture.How is the company looking at partnerships? Firms such as TWTR, FB, SNAP etc are just a few of the companies that could change the dynamics of this company in a big way. What about the Comcast investment? What has Angelakis brought to the table? How can GRPN & CMCSA find mutually beneficial synergies?What about the BABA investment? BABA owns over 33M shares of GRPN. They have held their position for over a year now. What has Williams and team done to leverage this investment to make it beneficial for both parties. Does anyone think BABA will continue to sit still over the next 6-9 months with a depreciating stock price. They have $100M invested. I know this may be small potatoes for a company of BABA's size however Jack Ma is a proven winner and I don't believe he likes to lose...ever!Lastly what is the company doing to leverage the findings from the start ups founded by Lefkofsky and Keywell. Lefkofsky is the COB and Keywell a board member. GRPN needs to explore what opportunities exist between these companies.The continued focus on the operations is important. It is just a component of the bigger picture. Can Williams and the rest of the leadership team balance more than one thing on their plate. So far that answer is NO if you evaluate solely on the stock price and GRPN's latest quarterly results."
Wall at 4.71
"Take profits based on follows:- GRPN stock price increases more than 80% over 7-month period; it is too much for an ongoing earning lost retailer due to high competitive industry. Let’s explore earning data against increasing stock price.- Year-over-Year Data: Revenue is decreased by 4.59%. Net income lost $86 million (reduced lost due to reduced capital spending). Book value/share is decreased by 78%.- Book value/share = $0.33, P/B is around 16.78 (all time high over 10-year of GRPN).- Many executives sold around $5.23/share. - Many retailers have mass selloff with large discounts before closing their doors forever. That will be detrimental impact on revenue, earnings and stock price for coming quarters. This situation is similar last Feb to Jun 2017."

Never lost hope with Grpn. @1.52 but I believe it will easily get there by next week. Prolly $3 by July.

Wow .. amazing this company trades at a 15% discount to their FY19 Sales assuming the keep the same trend for FY1 Q1 and Q2. Shouldnt this be valued a lot more now that the IBM lawsuit is settled . I am picking some stock .. i was on the sidelines still not sure of what the settlement would be and though I did not get it at the bottom better to get in now .. this stock always does good towards the holidays .. i can easily see it going to $4.4 or a 20% uptick by Dec

That news was already known and the stock was around 4.35 when the rally started. If you don’t actively trade then it shouldn’t concern you but if you do selling at highs and buying at lows is the only way to make $ in this stock. It’s been i a range from mid 3s to 6 for about 2 years. Buy in the low 4s sell in the mid to high 5s. There could be a buyout still, but I’m less optimistic than I was before. What worries me is why is grpn putting themselves up for sale in the 1st place?"

"Notice how the stock is actually up with very high volume, classic case of friendly analyst downgrade who gets no business from GRPN but has larger clients that are short, the analyst does a downgrade, the big guys cover and eventually it actually goes up, without this downgrade we would have hit 4 today.

Something is rotten in Denmark. I am really surprised at downgrades just before a company's earnings release. I always heard that some give a downgrade so they can buy shares cheaper. Now we shall see.

I have owned GRPN and made money and lost money at different times with the stock. It missed earnings and revenue estimates yesterday and the stock price deserve to drop. It is the announcement of the R/S in my opinion that caused its big drop because typically a forced R/S only causes the stock to drop further. I am a consumer and buy the groupons on sale. There is a decent market out there that makes it viable and is good for small and large businesses alike. The company has net cash and is not in the red from what I can understand. I am holding and looking to add. Thoughts.

This stock never has gone up for the long invester. I owned this at 12 before split which would be 120. now. and held to 10. Then bought again at 6 and watched it go to 4. Bought again at 3 and watched go to 2 Then the reverse split and then it was 25 again and went up to the 30s now just sinking again Will be back down in the single digits again.

"Shorts: Not saying this can't go down but stock corrected both before the reverse split and after the reverse split. What is your arguement ? All R/S's plunge no matter what? Further, they are about to get a new CEO that could spur dynamic change and most importantly that 700 million cash or so looking you right in the face, caps the downside risk. Not to mention what happens if the robinhood contingent gets on board... Just seems like much better candidates to short than this one. This is fun, right ?"

"GRPN decreased North America marketing spending a very significant $15m in Q3 2018, as compared to the Q3 2017. This explains better than anything else the lack of rev & active user growth in North America. The good news is, based on comments from the call, GRPN has now recognized that they’ve gone too far focusing mainly on profitability, and indicated they have now increased NA marketing spend in Q4. In my opinion, this change in direction will increase the attractiveness of the stock."
"Groupon, ignored and laughed at by small businesses will now become their vehicle by which they will attract customers in the post-COVID-19 era."
I think that this stock will get squeezed to $63 today.

"FER and others, I've been thinking about the BABA investment in GRPN and trying to figure out the next course of action. BABA has held since Q4 of 2015. The investment has netted BABA over $50M to date. A drop in the bucket compared to BABA's own stock appreciation since 2015. The question on the 2 year anniversary of the investment is ....NOW WHAT? I see a few different scenarios for BABA from selling (not desirable) to a full blown acquisition. My point is I believe the a quo is about to change and I am not sure what the change willI am interested in"
The timing for this stock could be pretty fortuitous. They will be reporting near the bottom(hopefully). A good report could provide a substantial bump. I'm north of 60% positive.

"GRPN’s current net cash balance is of ~$0.80 per share. HOWEVER, almost all of that cash is earmarked to pay vendors when services are rendered OR to return to customers if services are not rendered due to the businesses being closed due to coronavirus. After you subtract liabilities, GRPN has about 5 cents per share tangible net assets (incl. cash). GRPN’s business will be as hard hit as any restaurant or spa they partner with. Essentially GRPN will have zero revenue starting in March until the crisis is over. GRPN also has some debt. GRPN is going through a very challenging period with almost zero revenues and mounting losses, in my view."

Did Groupon make a deal with the Kushners or something??
I'm ready for earnings. HUGE beat Go GRPN!
JOHN thought it was going to 4
Can never hold it's gains SMH
I’m not selling a share. It was not a lower low when you look back a couple of weeks… The big boys continue to try to take your shares…
here you go everyone. I'm out 12% loss. hope it goes up for everyone that still in
"Another new 52 week high. I used to sell 1000 shares or so on a rally and try to buy back cheaper, but things seemed to have changed, I'm afraid to not be holding 100% of my shares at all times now. If someone were going to buy GRPN now would be the time or they are going to have to pay a much higher price in the future."
Still hanging in there right at the support level. The Russell rebalancing affecting things… Do not let the big boys still your shares for cheap
Sold another 1000 today. I am all out of GRPN shares.
Ba Ba Ba Barry!!! BasherMagooo!!!! 
"Were up end of day, down beginning of day!!"
"Another poster claims buying GRPN on the other way down is a way to capture value. This is a good way to go broke. GE is another value trap. Sure I bought XOM at new lows in April $73, a value... Trades $86 plus juicy dividend today. Thats how a real trader makes money."
THOUGHTS on Glance Technologies .....................?????((((((((((((((((((( G L N N F )))))))))))))))
little bit disappointed. it did not made up $4.0shorters worked so hard...it's a long day
Where is Jack our visionaryLOL!!!
16% premarket which means over 20% today
I bought 150 calls of October 32Let’s see how it will react
Tempting to buy at these levels but as a merchant it is still a ripoff. As soon as we get some returning customers we will ditch Groupon because they are too expensive. Once they give merchants a reason to stick around then I’ll be bullish.
GRPN is up 5.83% to $3.27
"I've been trading groupon for over a year selling the pops and buying all the way down. This should be an interesting quarter since they closed some more markets, and had more layoffs and had social living for a whole quarter. 1st quarter is their weakest,and mkt. is expecting -.01. I'll sell any pop after earnings unless they crush it .10 , any sell off i'll be buying.For the record i like the vision this CEO has, if you haven't read it go to Groupon.com the bottom of the page go to blogs find the post Dear Stockholders April 29th, 2016good luck all."
Yelp is a failing company their interface is confusing and their marketing is too aggressive. Thank god this is just a rumorGrpn should go it alone and find value in other smaller start-ups
Next stop $35!
"I'm starting to get a good feeling. As long as we stay above $4.50 I can deal with the wait to $7, but who says we have to stop there. BaBa?"
John you have lost on every posted buy.... this is hilarious
What shall we expect today....
Good time to get in before there bought out by some giant company.
"They need to advertise on the superbowl. Everyone knows about groupon, but dont realize how much it can save them and also promote businesses"
Good things are going on with derbysoft for better travel results. Presence AI for Groupon Select customers. Group in trending for costco membership sale. I guess they should start discounts like ticketsatwork.com provide to the company employees as inclusion with groupon select in order to attract more customer base.
this stock is going to break out soon. Way too cheap at these levels.
"I haven't been in this stock long, but i must say i am very disappointed in it at this point. I will wait it out as i am never a short sell guy, but jeez, could we get something going here?"
Deal of the Day: Will Groupon Get Acquired?http://www.barrons.com/articles/deal-of-the-day-will-groupon-get-acquired-1506037370?mod=yahoobarrons&ru=yahoo&yptr=yahooI told you all
I guessed 12M shares traded today. I am now revising upward to 16M.
i GOT IN THIS MORNING YIPPY
"Verdict is ok, no Win for sure but much less what Big Blue ask for."
The whole stock market is up like crazy and this POS is doing nothing! The earnings better crush it for Q4!
Trading WILL be halted tomorrow - guaranteed. Every investor will try and get money out - pink sheet soon.
Sweet...lets keep it rolling into tommorrow!!
Gap-Up open tomorrow with a close in 60’s is eminent.
John claiming he buys low and sells high on thisLOL!!!!!!!!!!
:( waiting for the Blood In The Streets to happen..... looks like lower days are coming (again)
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groupon-launches-effort-west-town-185300919.html
"For those who may be concerned about a possible late-stage economic cycle, based on my review of Groupon’s history going back a decade, my conclusion is that a slower economy would likely help, rather than hurt, GRPN. A slower economy would encourage many folks to take advantage of Groupon’s discounts and coupons. The great recession is seen by many, in fact, as having propelled GRPN’s impressive growth at the start."
"If Groupon is looking for a buyer why have 50+ recent open positions and a renewed lease till 2023? Additionally, the Company is ongoing a recent acquisition of cloud savings company? Make any sense of this?"
More they sell more we buy. Going down on low volume meaning no mass selling just trying to shake weak hands
"Close at $3.8 today ,hopefully towards $4 tomorrow ."
"Just trying to understand. The company has revenues of $1 billion a year from sales. They have cash on hand of about $500 million. But, because they ""missed"" by 2 cents, it is a worthless stock? It has value - maybe not $50 per share - but $4.80 is not an accurate valuation either."
rsi at 30. buy buy buy
Under 4mm on Friday already 1mm in 45 minutes. Volume will dry up.
grpn will be bought in few days
This thing has been exploding ever since that layoff announcement lol
"Market down, nasdaq down, Groupon up 3% after a 22% run... definitely a weak stock LOL"
"Buy now is not late , this stock worth much more than you think ."
Volume good
Volume dried up not even shorts are interested in this anymore
Volume was 5.1M shares traded with another 500K in after hours as of this posting. Well below the averages. Let's see what tomorrow brings.
Thumb up if your short Thumb down if your long. 
"A buyout would be around $6 - $6.25 which would be a combination of stock and cash.Since GRPN is seeking a buyer, which seems the case since there has been no denial from the company, this looks like something will happen. The timeframe is undetermined."
"The order imbalance on the sell side is unbelievable. Traders who buy must be ""flipping"" based on the action on Level 2"
remember July Earnings day
Has there been any update on the Alibaba stake in Groupon? Have they increased their shares at all?
buy buy
"I just spent some of my profits living it up in Vegas, while your here bashing and bobbing with worthless .01!!"

"Take profits based on follows:1) P/B = 11.21 is extremely high 2) Dow up around 200 pts, GRPN is down and under downward trend3) Morgan Stanley deal @ $4.50 until 2019 - Who would buy higher than $4.50?"
buyout tomorrow

$CRMD *Cormedix Shares Up 21.6% After Independent Data Safety Monitoring Board Determined Statistical Significance In Phase 3 Trial Result I’m gonna sell GRPN & buy more CRMD
$GRPN One of the directors purchased $1 Million shares close to $1 valuation. This stock will never go again under $1. Financial firms have increased position on Groupon also recently. $5 is around the corner. Groupon just needs better PR and press releases weekly and we will be like $ETSY . Strong Buy! Lots of CASH. Strong Valuation. Will benfit from Shopping Deals and also when economy opens from LOCAL Deals. Don't think twice about this Stock . ER should be next week or May 5th. We should see positive numbers and cutting cost.
TIMBER!!!!!!
"just a bad DNA within this company...bought an item for 199 and the PROMO code did not take...then immeddiately repurchased the same exact item and the promo code was accepted...now they REFUSE to return my $199.00 no one to speak to in the USA, so this is not how you keep customers.Reply"

"Something fishy is being played by the #$%$s of Wall St . This stock was averaging $4.4 for the past 10 months, Since Aug it has fallen 20% on apparently no news. The Re/code article on a potential sale is at best a rumor that has been going around for many years . Agree with the below comment that some players are pulling the stock down to sell it out in the cheap. It may also be an insider wanting to acquire this company on the cheap. This company is out of favor with the wall st #$%$ and is doing a poor job general public to become investors. Although on the business side of things they seem to be doing well. Seeing a ton of new listings on groupon , higher engagement on Groupon + and Groupon goods have renewed their lease for many more years. Its a real company , doing real things ( sure they have failed and so has amazon ) and making real profits , just not the type the wall st #$%$s hype like the yelps and rokus . Having entrenched so much within local businesses this stock will shoot the roof if they merge local and social. This platform is one of the best and most effective local platforms out there."
And here comes my drop!
Earnings got unfairly hurt by the IBM litigation according to their Non-GAAP losses imo

Big jump today. Big volume. Buyout imminent.

SHORT SHORT SHORT. We have a squeeze party to prepare for
"Wayfair stock is up 40% as online sales have doubled. People want bath towels, home supplies, and home appliances. Stock symbol is W."
Randolfi was cautious with 2018 guidance based on investments in marketing both in international and domestic campaigns.
"No earnings to report.. and no guidance to give. . they should only report yearly. ..... not making money is good in this environment. . making money is bad, just look at the market. .. stock goes up on bad earnings. ."
Brad and .007 spent all their funds at the dispensary this weekend!! Poor Puffers!!
Value trap.
Time to add
The hurt locker!!
"full year 280-290 million in ebita cash flow healthy, the bottom was in at 3.04 all up from here"
I love how the naysayers never post their name or reason for their thumbs down.I've been in GRPN since 2.90 and love the current price...and forward guidance.
"Loading up the Truck, dont be a coward (Brad)/.007)..taking the risk..."
Headed back to the $3s
"Guillermo is watching and sadly saying ""I told you so, kids, why you didn't listen, AMATEURS""."
Sell while the price is high.. make money don't lose it on groupons.. earnings will be bad again.. time to get out before hitting $2.50.
GRPN showing good resiliency here at the close. Volume is good. More buyers than sellers. Congrats longs. Hopefully the stock has staying power into tomorrow and through the rest of the week.
"For all you guys that watched this loose 1/4 of your funds today, while the board of directors cashed in on your money today, there will be more to come on loses."
"@ Booey, agreed!!"
Did anyone even see this? I like it more and more at this price. https://investor.groupon.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx#

3$+ I think so
"Alibabe issuing US$ senior notes...hmmm..wonder what they need US$ for, US acquisition?"
"GRPN's range today is 13 cents, do you remember when spreads were 1/8, 1/4......etc. There is nothing going on."
Poor John thought it was going to 3.40 on Friday
Will someone please offer 1.17 a ride to his anger management session!!
$35 by Friday my thoughts
"okay, this is purely speculation on my part...a few weeks ago someone on here mentioned Alibaba might buy out Groupon, and those comments were largely dismissed. now we hear Alibaba is making a push for the US given their current stake in Groupon and their aspirations to challenge Amazon what are the chances those rumors are true? just from an average consumer standpoint I saw a company like Uber making a play for Groupon but with today's announcement I think it could be Alibaba. what do you think? any realistic possibility here considering groupings user base locally?"
Just purchased Groupon @2.85 they did very well during the last recession so I think that they will do well again if we get a economic downturn again.
1.3 million bought at mid day causing a reversal. looks like a dead cat bounce like all the rest.The only thing that will save this company is a buy out.
Low volume all on the sell side. Not enough buyers out there. Looks like we will give back most if not all of yesterdays gains. Rich Williams and team better start finding ways to promote the company. Crazy how they have had little to say.
Does anyone have their email address and the CEO?
"Noticed thatthe volume has dropped pretty low after the recent run up. Any idea what it means?Also Eric sold 1.5Mn shares recently, he has started again? What does that indicate.. any cues?"
"What a gift, see you all in 2020!!!"
Going higher - Don't fight it!
$GRPN Look at $SHOP $ET . Shopify $600 Etsy over $62. Where do you think Groupon will go one day to $100 a share. Groupon can turn the next $AMZN Strong Buy. Easy money after ER to $4-$5
Those who bashed GRPN for the past couple of months...glad you are not part of our success.
"normally reverse splits are bad but i believe this is an exception. The new CEO and leadership can be a game changer Let's not forget the company founders, the biggest Chinese electronic merchant company (it's possible they put one of their guys at the help of groupon) and others own millions of shares. They won't let it go for less than top dollars.Also with the stock trading in the 30ies, new retail and institutional investors will be attracted. I believe this will be a new Wall Street success story (like the various NKLA, BYND, etc.).Guillermo"
here we go ... breaking .70 to 71
LBO? Inside sales of 7 million net shares... Hmmm.
"@GRPN. Low volume drop today on support. THE BULLS ARE BACK. Sorry you lame ol bears. The numbers won't lie. Here to cash out on our powerful stock market. Bears beware. In at tomorrows open.All your logic is based on unknown numbers. Truth is groupies are selling off the hook.Bears will battle, while bulls won every war."
2 buck chuck
Is it true BABA has been buying shares in the open market on pull backs and this is the reason for the large volume? Anyone know anything because they sure keep it quiet! Why are they not paying a premium?
"They totally missed earnings , investors should be running for the doors get out while you can. Dont let them get your last $3 a share !"
"Good, now I would only have to tell one company to leave me alone. Both these companies are relentless!!!!"
Could be Alibaba news?!
"It seems this board has a number of new posters who believe more in hyperbole than data. As a recent GRPN investor, I continue to follow to potentially exploit overly zealous trading patterns. I am NOT a trader, I am an investor. Recent events such as earnings have dictated a change in strategy in how to play this stock. Short interest continues to grow. Why is this stock so heavily shorted? On a positive note Williams and Randolfi continue to hold on to their shares. They have not made an open market transaction for over 1.5 years. More institutions were invested as of 12/31, over 62% of available shares. This stock has to demonstrate a consistent pattern of reasonable growth in FCF, EBITDA and cash from operations. Not to mention overall sales and bottom line performance. If you believe in Williams then ride the cycles. I suspect it will be a choppy ride. I believe the stock will see the 3's again. This pattern is quite similar to 2016. The one thing for sure about GRPN is history does repeat itself. There will be swings than can net investors good returns while conversely causing others to lose significant $$$. I will be a buyer once should the stock fall back to the $3.50 range. Don't think for a moment this can't happen. It's conceivable the stock could retest the 52 week low. The chart plain and simple is just awful."
testing that .69
what happened? someone knows something.
Well that is terrible news. John and Hari took the truck out last night and crashed into a gas station Both terribly burnt but aliveThank God!
"re: the 250 million offer to comcast, does that mean the stocks would be diluted as such? or it has been diluted already?"
"Each day that there is no buyer the stock will likely drop. Not everyday of course but the trend will likely be lower. I posted this after last earnings report and I’m sure I will get a bunch of angry replies but GRPN was my largest holding and now I have none and I’m not short. I think it the bottom is getting close though, probably around 3.75?"
Next 1-2 weeks a Buy rating
J losing thousands

Is it going to 45 anytime soon???
This earnings will give shorts a fit. Go GRPN!
Seems like the old model of vouchers did work.. trying to reinvent the wheel? Bad move..
52 week high. Buyout imminent!
"dont get confused the real price of GRPN is only $1.6 ( remember the reverse split 1:20 ?) its average price for the last 5 years show $3.6 and with its improving business it easily can return to $4.5 meaning $90 on the new pricing , wait to their next release where the will bit again reaching to $60"
"Ignore the bad quarter, anyone can tell what the company actually worth at moment,? As he total cash in the balance sheet isn't that bad, no? If do sold to others, what is the buyout price would be?"
J proud as can be of his falling stock 
Last one left turn out the light.....dead company.
Are we seeing $5 today? or this will be tomorrow?
If BABA hasn't sold yet....watch out....that would be 30+M shares on the sell side. Institutions and hedge funds are fleeing in droves now. Carnage. GRPN longs deserved better.
I buy a put right at .97 just incase it drops....but I see 3.00 today
Yesterday am was day shake out the weak hands.. give it a week will be well over 3
One trading session and this final hour to sell your shares before the final nail in the coffin!! Halloween all year round .. no thanksgivings for Groupon!! ..
"Old School analysis. Stock has one analyst with outperform, everyone else Neutral to bearish. How is that manipulation??"
GRPN reached an all time low at 1.41
come on 3
"Even if your not fond of Zack's, # 1 STRONG BUY rating is a big deal. GO GRPN!"
For now it seems that their earnings r going to suprise...
Thanks for the cheap stock today.
"I started looking at this stock 5 years ago and thought it was the short of a lifetime, but I lost interest. I looked at it today for first time in at least a year. Consider that it is Christmas season and Covid season at the same time.Products (old batteries, cheap pots/pans, etc)....accounted for $1.2B in sales last year.....GONELocal (wine tasting, hockey tickets, movies)......it is Covid season, and everything around the world is closing down......EXTREMELY TROUBLEDTravel.....(airfairs, B#$%$ motels)......see ""local"" above......EXTREMELY TROUBLEDWhile they might have some cash on hand, there is just not a compelling reason to do anything but short it."
"groupon board of directors , have nothing to say?? very weak... cut cost and drive up profit since they are not looking for increased revenues. they need to give a monthly update, since they are at almost zero.."
"The art of stealing from the everyday joe to benefit rich Williams and his buddies, Wall Street at it’s worst"
"theyre strategy to sell services and discounted popular niche products is very good. they sell local to each area and are a unique forum because they not only introduce great services but those services are discounted (I.E. sports game tickets, fishing charters, shows, massages, spa days, trampoline parks, amusment parks, gift certificates, and the list goes on!). this is a good product with room to grow. WHEN YOU PAY TO COMMERICIALIZE YOUR PRODUCT DURING THE SUPER BOWL YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE AN AGRESSIVE MARKETING STRATEGY...I have faith that not only current numbers will be good but future numbers will be looking GREAAAAAT"
anyone been noticing the 2X plus average volume going up and pretty consistent for over a week? Any insight would be greatly appreciated.
"Get in there and Sell Mortimer , sell , sell....."
Lets see some deep red -$1.20
Will the stock fizzle next week if no buyer is announced?
"if this stock can break 63 in a short time, then buy,. it then can run to 160 very fast..... otherwise being short is much easier... average your shorts, start small and then add more as price goes up... easy money ..."
Looks like today’s price action says “sell”. Won’t go any higher than today’s high.. sell

"Groupon, Inc. (GRPN) (Market Cap: $2.14B, Share Price: $3.75) will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial results on Wednesday, February 13, 2019, at 10:00am EST. Groupon plans to publish a letter to stockholders along with its fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial results after the close of market trading on Tuesday, February 12, 2019."
"I bought 12, any possibility that goes that price"
"What are the chances of Groupon peaking over the $5 mark, maintaining and growing from there?!? I’ve been tracking them for over 2 years now. Steep climb then a bomb rush drop. To be seen."
It will stay around $3.5
"GRPN is buying out inside news, Ali baba buying GRPN $4"
Who was saying it was down because of IBM lawsuit..LOL
When it pass 1.20 it will fly. Lol that is my point
Grpn earning is Feb 10....and they're going to beat their earnings
Groupon needs investigating... this is the worst corporate stealing and lying to investors I have ever seen
Big early jump. Let's see if it holds. Buyout imminent
John told you that owning this stock is “ good business sense “
"Simply a company for customers, not for investors.. investors have already been ripped off from day one.. any buyout at a lower price than when it went public would be a shame.. they keep saying this company could be significantly higher, but that has not happened in the last 3 years.. CEO will be resigning, stock will tank further.. this company is an add on product for an existing money making company. Will not survive alone. Share will be given away for free!!"
"GRPN Breakout tradeWATCH for possible breakout above 5.55Target: 5.97, 9.1% Stop: 5.32 Loss: 2.7%P/L ratio: 3.4 : 1 - Excellent"

what time will earnings come out in the morning?
"So anyone who had shares in groupon, lost all?"
"Time to make some money, load up the Truck..Merry Christmas!!"
At this price how can you not buy in or buy additional shares.
$5 is a BIG DEAL....Lets see if it will and wake up the Big Boys.
John loaded his truck all the way from the 5’s to 1’sSaid it was good business sense Then came the reverse splitJohn set his truck on fire
007 I gotta ask. You were calling .97 months ago before all recent events. What were you basing it on?
People are starting to give Groupon a serious look... There is a lot of risk in the market now and these guys present a very good risk/reward.. Expecting a very good quarter and healthy move up in price...
"Grpn is down over 50% in the last 5 years. S&P up 60%... it is near impossible for this stock to make those kinds of returns to catch up. If you want to be happy, don’t buy the stock only the Groupon coupons! Short sellers dream stock, long term investors nightmare.. CEO is a nice guy, but he needs to step down. So we can cash in!!"
"Management is clearly aware they are not providing shareholder value, and haven't for years, but I doubt that's on top of their list of concerns right now."

"Next stop $33, when she breaks through 27.30"
"Maybe ""the goods"" will fly off the shelves - due to ""Corona"""
Nice love the volume as it breaks the 50 day moving avg. Charts never make money. Best time to buy is when other are selling for no fundimental reason. Time will tell.
"can anyone tell me what the 200 day moving avg. is 4.87? at 9.42am exactly where all the selling came in, this is getting easy. Thank you for the cheap shares today. Keep reading charts they never work...."
Headed for bankruptcy and it's up 20% in a day. laughable. this company makes no money.
"Iterating again, 2020 belongs to GRPN...Once bull case started it will go back to where it was around IPO time..."
Groupon reached an all time low at 1.10
buyout coming soon or something!!.... let the price get low enough... that is when investments are made..
"Cyber Commerce consolidation must continue. It is Business 101. Groupon will be acquired. Only 3 questions. When, who & how much! Odds are high for 2018 takeover, yet not guaranteed. It is, ""Primed"" if you understand that concept in M & A (Mergers and Acquisitions)."
"I love the chatter about the rebalancing/ reconstitution taking place within certain indexes. If you knew this event was going to reduce the stock price by 15-20% then why wouldn't you sell and buy back when it is over? What sane individuals willingly make investments that will lose money? Economic sadists perhaps. I don't doubt the reconstitution has some effect, but there is history with this security and it continues to play out similar to events of the past."
Mixed 4th quarter results.Totally an overreaction by retail mom an pop holders and not by institutional selling. I am betting institutional owners will add more and after we go back over 5 new ones will buy.Groupon management needs a good kick in the #$%$.
Sell -- it is green and best price!!
52 week high on a down day. Me rikey!
Christian tells you it will rise over 5 at close... thank god for comedians
GRPN Rebounding on high volume...
Buyout imminent!
User of GRPN I bought GRPN shares after using the services. There is no other similar platform available. They can also go international with ease
"Eps BEAT by over 2x “Groupon Inc. GRPN, -0.31% reported third-quarter net income of $44.6 million, or 8 cents per share, after income of $59,000, or breakeven, last year. Adjusted EPS was 4 cents. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 3 cents and sales of $602.0 million"
guess the buyout rumor didn't last long huh
"Based on cashflow GRPN is worth $80+. Guillermo thinks that all they have to do is: increase revenues. But the good thing is that will happen IN AUTOMATIC as the economy is reopening NOW. Based on that Q2 and Q3 will be tremendous. Q4 will be seasonally excellent, as usual. Which tells me $80 is in the cards in 2021.Hasta la vista amigos and, be greedy with your shares!"
On 3/23/21… Groupon issued $300 million of convertible debt… ￼amazingly… debt only pays 1.125%… and conversion price $68.12… shows tremendous conviction on part of the investors
This is no longer an investment --- it's a gamble.
"Volume six million the past four days, 15% below avg, sitting on the 50 day MVA and now dead money until further notice. 4.50 to 5 and the summer malaze continues. GLTA"
Beat the revenue and missed the earning by 2 cent..! Looks good. Not bad.
Total manipulation and overreaction.I'm holding.
.01 and Brad puffing away at the dispensary...
"Even with a RS, many funds will not buy shares in a company with falling revenues and GAAP losses. This company is now profitable only on a non-GAAP basis. As they exit the goods space, revenues (at least initially) will fall further. So management can now blame future bad numbers in that transition. Can they turn it around? Not likely from the same management team that got GRPN to this point. Anybody disagree for a rational reason?"
Basic. You lose a lot on this one?
50 dma crossed over the 200 dma today. chart will turn up the next couple of weeks
Buy Buy Buy
You guys thought it was going to a have a good move up 
My buy bells were ringing with this one this morning so I got in.
Hedge funds will only prop this dog up for so long. They manipulate stocks - they do not care about performance (obviously).
"Stock hit exactly $23.00, but no fill for me. Zero shares. Looks like there was a Big Boy ahead of me. Oh well, just a little more patience and this should work out. I'm not giving up even a single penny on this Buy Cover. $23.00 or Bust... :-)"
only reason to rs is to dilute to implement their growth plan
wow.. in 20 mins - 2Mn volume!!

Keep panicking so I can buy more!!
This thing will be somewhere between $1 and $6 after earnings. You read it here first!
This stock is a joke.
"This might be the best board ever... thanks John, Brad and .01 for the daily amusement."
Its been a nice green week so far..Happy Hump day!!
It makes no sense for Groupon to be trading at this low of a price.
"Absolutely no other message board has this entertainment value... period.The comments, banter, videos, entertainment are worth 2$ a share. LMAO"
R u kidding me Groupon? Down a dollar and some change over the last week or so? What’s going on here?!!!!!!
Everyone says recovering on next earnings report they better blow it out of water or this will sink faster than Titanic
"Huge block of shares, approximately 1.2M, traded to move GRPN green. Someone wanted in this stock in a big way."
"Good day today. I hope you are adding call options because Guillermo has.Guillermo wants to bring your attention to market cap.GRPN in the last 10 years had a market cap of $2B with spikes at $3.8B (after the big recession) or about 4 times today's market cap.We can say now GRPN is running with one cylinder (goods) while 'experiences' (the other cylinder) are just starting. Already now it should be valued probably like $1.3-1.5B because experiences are already moving and goods are going at full power, which translated to PPS should be about $50 a share. What a coincidence the number Guillermo has been talking about for months!!! Then once we go full power full power on both cylinders then we should get 4 times from here so about $140-$150 a share (again, a number Guillermo has mentioned before). This without particular synergies (that will develop in the next couple of years), new lines of businesses (that will develop in the next couple of years), new partnerships (that will develop in the next couple of years)...that is why the target price will be actually $200-$300. And, with a perfect executing theoretically $500. Now as both cylinders will run nicely GRPN should"
Zeljanica cmon don’t stop now
Should GRPN shareholders be concerned about the pending results of the IBM lawsuit?
"Just like I said, this is just the beginning, if GME did it, GRPN can do it too. Hold for 100’s"

"Volume finally picks up, unfortunately for longs it's heavy on the sell side of the equation. Something is definitely wrong here. Market up over 400 points and GRPN is down 3%."
"Revenue was $626.5 million in the first quarter 2018, down 7% (11% FX-neutral) reflecting our continued focus on revenue generation that maximizes gross profit.Gross profit was $324.9 million in the first quarter 2018, up 5% (1% FX-neutral), led by growth in International."

Wedbush upgrade with move to neutral and $4 price target. Not really a bullish call...
Start using Groupon and be sure to spread the word. GO GRPN!
30 minutes right then we will know this is a miss?
Morgan Stanley Maintains his equal weight rating on GRPN today but moves his price target from 4.60 to 4.80. That's quality wall street research. I guess I can tell you who didn't get the banking deal. Quality work.
I say we are headed up this week!!
down almost another 6% after closing!
JOHN and J are desperate pumping clowns who ended up losing 
Glass half empty or half full.....The stock is much cheaper so any buyout would be a better deal at this time.The Superbowl ad ate some earnings this QTR but will it help earnings in next QTR.Rev's were much better - always a good sign for a growing company.
Some technical numbers I am seeing as Bullish for GRPN. Alexa rank increased(traffic) by 100 which is huge for groupon. Membership will give some benefit if people are joining because you have to continue for atleast 6 months.
"Funny fact: today at $28.88 the stock is still exactly HALF from where it was in January. Two words: DIRT CHEAP!Fair price as of today probably $50. To get there, break $35 (last high) then no resistance till $50. Then if in the meantime we get some positive updates we will get back to square one: $60. From there like Guillermo said over and over: 2 good quarters and $100 is served."
Blood bath.
What's the reason for today's move?
Earnings was a bland event. Nothing to be overly excited about. A key piece for me in the report was the company bought ZERO shares under the previously announced repurchase program. Even management didnt believe the price of the stock was worth the investment. If that isn't telling I don't know what is.
Hedge Funds are liquidating their positions.
"SO.... Mr. DowPete is a 'shorty' that has now ""covered"" his short at these levels. (good for him). But for some reason, he will hang around here being negative: why? Mr. DowPete, let it rise 20 to 30 percent again before ya spew all the negative commentary. ((sometimes, ya give stuff a REST and revisit it later.)) just sayin."
John take it easy in that wheelchair otherwise we are taking the wheels off
Here we go......Couldn't hold $24! Selling pressure continues on this Zombie Stock.
I hope everyone is ok look it's going up!
"It's great that there are all these beginner traders shorting GRPN and then chasing it higher. Good lesson to learn as long as you are still young. You will remember Guillermo's words for a while LOL.At $30 it is still extremely cheap. Pre-split we are talking of less than $1.50, peanuts. GRPN with worst financials was trading around $3, which post split is around $60. That MAYBE, if you really want, would be a starting port to short. $60 with today's financials, FAIR. maybe a bit overvalued.With the stock in the 20ies? Are you insane? LOL, you will get destroyed.And $60 in a couple of months can be AGAIN unvervalued if financials improve...so bottom-line: not a good shorting candidate...Good luck"
Is the Q4 profit really supposed to be .13 cents? That is a pretty big jump from last year. Looks like Wall St doesn’t think they will even come close to that number
Priced at $29.... is it still a buy??
J are you RW? Maybe you could buy some shares instead of selling a million this year.
Someone wants the price down. The action on Level 2 wreaks of the MM's games.
Another 500k buy today
Looks like 9.2M shares trade hands. 2.7M in final hour. Not as much as most days but still a significant amount in a short time.
Recession in the making evaluations too high. Headed to 2.00 range
"this company is a big scam....... go ahead and trade its stock.......enjoy the rideHind sight is always 20:20 . Search the databases and you will not a single internet company that survived while losing money as a core business practice. They go up, they go down, Insiders are milking the market but they always end up at Zero. there is no reason to think that this one will be any different than thousands that fail and folded over the years"
"Once Groupon goes back to sales with an improved business model and cancels the reverse split, grpn will have an up trend"
GRPN is down 14.45% to 0.56
John puffing dead leaves
anyone know if living social is a publicly traded company? ticker symbol?
still over overvalued at 0.7. true value is 0.0
"I like that Groupon is participating in upcoming conferences (REAL ones -- not some #$%$ conference). It gives us an opportunity to hear them respond to questions that weren't asked on the earnings call.Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ: GRPN) announced that Aaron Cooper, Interim Chief Executive Officer, and Melissa Thomas, Chief Financial Officer, will participate in two upcoming conferences:1. U#$%$ Global TMT Virtual Conference - December 7, 2020 at 3:45 p.m. ET2. Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference - December 10, 2020 at 9:00 a.m. ET"
"Broke Brad had a long night looting stores, I am sure he will be back to stalk the board soon!!"
"Longs, do your body a big favor to buy this machine on Groupon made by Rock Solid now you have made great profit. This machine is an amazing machine."
Where are all my chart readers we are though the 200 day moving avg you should be buying 4.89
Must maximize winning plays. Doesn't matter that I am up over $10k right now. This looks good for more downside and so I will not cover even one single share. Greed is Good when you are in this type of a winning play!
"Remember Econ 101? Markets clear at equilibrium price. Supply / Demand at Price/Time.No conspiracy here, just very basic economics for you gamers. Lesson is taught when prices are marked to market."
how is this going up ? earnings tomorrow watch out
"Broke Brad says bankruptcy, poor puffer cant afford 1 lousy share"
Watch JACK come on here with his great words of wisdom and holier than thou smacks against everyone.
Visit Russell Website tomorrow after the close you will be able to get an idea of where GRPN stands in terms of amount of shares to be added or deleted GLTA
Guys is the rumor true that BABA is buying out GRPN at $4/share thats why there is a jump happening?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groupon-finds-most-people-plan-181800671.html
GRPN is about to break $5 and stay be there for it or dont.
"And Guillermo forgot one thing.$60=$3. Except at $3 no mutual fund could get in.Today at $60 hundreds of mutual funds, pensions, retirment funds are buying GRPN thanks to the reverse split. Which means PRICE STABILITY and up up up stock move.Stay greedy my friends!"
Dan and Guilermo A match made in heaven
Short interest decreased slightly to 37.5M shares. GRPN now ranks as the 22nd highest shorted equity on the NASDAQ. If there is any semblance of good news and a promising outlook the short squeeze alone could add $2-3 to the current share price. Conversely any negative news or poor earnings will only serve as an accelerant to further downside pressure.
too many chart readers
"Anyone have an opinion on Groupon's earnings coming out tomorrow? Given the lack of merchants I see on the site, I'm not expecting much. Anyone expecting positive earnings?"
Strong Friday in a 900 point down market.
"It took me a few day to figure out what was actually going on with GRPN, I finally figured it out...The Russell indices rebalance on the 22nd of June, so the preliminary numbers are circulating before the final decisions are made. Therefore some was trading in front that thinking there would be stock for sale, that game is very 1999, and does not work anymore, but I am fairly certain that's what casued the volume up tick recently and it may not be over we will see. but look for a bounce from what ever level on the following Monday."
we just tested .71
"Groupon is a great company if you are user. The problem lies with the Chairman and the Board .. greedy , their history of granting options leaves little as general float. Someone should investigate as it could very well be the insiders buying and selling at every did and pop .. Make 2% each time and do that 10 times a month .. Do the math .. no do that for 3 years .. these guys have already > 300%"
If up today- down tomorrow... that's a given unfortunately
"Whisper number is .15 on $791.85M revenue. Grpn emails me all the time. They email the same few items over and over again because I clicked on them once. There isn’t any variety in the emails they send. Shouldnt they mix it up a bit? Anyone else notice this? I do use Grpn for oil changes, carpet cleaning, items they sell etc, I just think they should have better software to choose what items to email people as suggestions. If I didn’t buy the service or item the 10th time they emailed me about it why email me an 11th or 12th time? Why not email a different item or service?"
"Frank we could use some of your hilarious predictions today,wake up"
No surprises. Results as expected
"IMO, the big boys are pulling everything back right now to get a better price with the market ready to rip and this one will go along with it. Don’t give up your shares today"
"Losing 3% on an up day is disturbing. The good news is the stock rebounded with a flurry and quite a bit of buying occurred in the final hour of trading. If you look at a volume chart, the downside in the morning accounted for about 8M share. Once the bottom hit the buying started and over 11M shares traded. Lastly, did you see the after hours volume. Almost 4M shares traded. Final trades so GRPN up .02.Barring any political or other issues this weekend, Monday should be very interesting."
"If GME can do it, so can GRPN."
"Once they cut the real estate bill, they will see a profit in 2023.."
Any chances that the stock will go back below 3 bucks.
Wow.. chef and play adopted ‘poison pill’ and they stock skyrocketed. But Groupon is a stick in the mud or concrete!
"Buying more today, just look at the fundamentals this company is very attractive for acquisitions, just remember alibaba has 5% stakes.."
"this thing is sold...too quiet, moving for the past week on zero news"
You guys Should have gotten out while you could. This bull is over weight.
Brad and .01 at their Shrinks office again today!!
just signed up...https://finance.yahoo.com/m/62cefdf7-abf5-3861-9c91-28229543c9f2/groupon-launches-%245%2Fmonth.html
great news on GRPN this morning...it will go higher today....adding more....
this stock is done honestly below all indicator strong sell why buy now and keep losing money next quarter is gona be bad
nice ride.. thank you... but gotta get while the getting is still good. hate the long weekends.. it seems to always simmer down and drop... have a great weekend..
Easy money every day!
"Hold this till Easter in April and we shall see over $80. Millions of shares are still not covered while more people are getting in to invest the stock. If you learned about the stock back in 2012 when it went IPO, it went over $20 and Google wanted to buy them out. If you time the reverse split 1 for 20 then we are actually trading low $3 dollars. Forgive my earlier post that I made mistake of 1 for 7 instead of 1 for 20. This stock has much more room to go up."
Why is this company so hated? I am buying a few K shares just to see what happens. Only a 2.99 downside is better than my swings on NVDA and TSLA LOL
Yolo the long who has lost thousands 
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/997793de-c5ac-313b-9470-310b6254e4ce/groupon-has-a-new-activist.html
Time for management to sell. Time for Big Boys to swoop in and start goobling up the weak. I see it coming in many sectors. The sttong get stronger.
"Short interest decreased to 42.8M shares. A good sign though this is a typical pattern if you review the short interest history. Today's action represented a rotation into energy, financials and technology. GRPN benefited earlier in the week from all the noise surrounding possible trade wars. Volume has been exceptionally light over the past 3 days. Not sure what to make of this other than the market is pausing on this security.I welcome your thoughts and comments."
go baby go
"There have been a number of references to EPS, GAAP vs non GAAP, etc. Yes the company reported a profit this quarter however the top line performance and guidance was awful. At some point if you need to show an expanding market presence and to do that is to generate more sales. That was definitely not the case this quarter. Q4 should have stronger top line results but lets see how it comps with 2016 $905M and 2017 $873M. I expect continued revenue declines. I understand some of this is a result of the change in business strategy. At some point though the company needs to have revenues accelerate while maintaining good margins. This is where they have fallen short."
"The wrong move was made when he said, Groupon is For Sale without a buyer(s) in place and since then its tanking. Its time for new leaders across the board that won't take this company granted, as a A.T.M machine and advancing forward with innovative ideas. Anyone on this conversation board can do a better job in running the company. L.O.L"
I have to admit the guy would predicted 2.88 nailed it
Owned this in 2016 and made 25%. Time to buy again.
Earnings already expected to be low. Only thing they have to do is beat a low call
3rd party model is so much better...
7 dollars by end of year
"Recent Form 4 filing for Lefkofsky shows a sale of 1.5M shares, 750K on 12-6 and 750K on 12-7. Lefkofsky also contributed another 2M shares to his charitable foundation. I am never fond of insider sales especially coming from the board room and Eric is the COB. He does own 88M shares and this sales and donation represent a little over 3% of his holdings.....a small transaction in the grand scheme of things.I would suspect some of the volume spikes I wrote about in a prior post are a result of these sales.I would be more concerned if Williams and Randolfi were selling. I will be watching closely over the next few trading days."
"To put some perspective to yesterday's CC numbers.There is a possibility of reaching $300M EBITDA by 2022.Ebay EBITDA is about $3B. Ebay market cap? $40B so about 10 times its EBITDA, fair.Groupon's market cap today is $700M. It is not far-fetched to assume Groupon valuation (stock price if you prefer) to grow at least 5 times in the next 12-18 months. So yes a stock price $100-$150. That is why today's volume was 30 times average, that is why the stock had the highest one day return in its lifetime.Anyone wants to short now? This is another OSTK...good luck to all."
So is this going to be a hit or miss after the bell.... I think miss
Up $6 AH!
$ETSY takes aim at $AMZN customers. $OPY gave a price target of $85. I believe $100 is very possible. $GRPN has bigger numbers very undervalued. Cheapest to Buy at this levels. Saw ETSY from $3-$80 in one year. Groupon will do the same and more. https://seekingalpha.com/news/3573362-etsy-takes-aim-amazon-customers
They're starting to digest the earnings release and recognizing that simply beating the consensus analysts' EPS estimates by furloughing 25% of their employees to cut costs doesn't hide the fact that revenues missed HUGELY and that they're consistently dropping.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groupon-grpn-reports-q1-loss-214509282.html
"Volume has plummeted. Fast money, HFTs and shorts reduced market cap. This isn't going to zero, so shouldn't management be buying? Hmmmm."
will close up
"this time its real, no head fake"
"so is anybody keeping up on the class action lawsuits? Did any actually get filed.? if in NY Fed. the case can be followed on line, I guess the same in Calif."
Someone wanted out yesterday at the close. Large blocks totaling over 1.3M shares traded in the final couple of minutes. Volume and price action are not ideal heading into Friday's earnings announcement. Let's see what the next two trading sessions bring.
What Brad doesn’t want to tell you is how much he’s lost here! He’s the true pumping pig! His insults are pointed directly at himself. What a muppet!
Tomorrow TIMBER!!!!!

John again telling you to load up as it continues to fall....
Look for a 2$ gain in November.. just Remember to sell.. Buyout is being formalized..lol
"only 2 stocks are positive today GRPN and GRUB, a perfect match"
"Guys, two analysts said down side will b $4.5, N no buyout it will go $6.30; then buyers step in, double from where it's standing at the time. Offering price will be$11. Please share what you thought of your price will be"
Looks like grpn is done and dusted. Tumble back to $10 in the near future?
"God willing and the sales and profits of GRUOPON, good luck and faith that we will have good results"
"Volume is falling off the chart. Not good for bulls or bears, but ok for the birds and bees."
"when i saw the futures, i thought cha-ching.... only to see it was a 1:20 reverse split. lol"
did this managment really need to do that massive reverse split this year??? what did it really serve. Could they not purchase and retirestock??
"Hey, Rich Williams!!! What is a 7% interim day loss for you, 44% sounds proper"
Here comes another fizzle!!
Anyone buying more at this huge two day drop?
Chris4 hours agoWe will close $22.67WOW...what a prediction!
After I bought 5.77 and then straight down
Wow...back to 4.
Berkshire and Buffet must be getting set to take a stake in GRPN just like they did with SIRI when SIRI was trading in the $4.50 range.Good value and they will make a load if GRPN goes from 4.50 to just 5.50.
I bought today at 2.40 seems like a good deal to me.
"people are smart , they should sell it immediately"
GRPN moved from Russell 1000 to Russell 2000 where its weight in the index increased causing demand for shares that is why the increase in volume and share price. GLTA
Thinking GRPN may pull a GPRO this week. Looking for a big spike! Jesus says back up da truck!
MOSTLY FOOLS says Groupon is dead.That is a BUY BUY BUY signal.MF is always wrong.
Volume has exceeded averages 12 out of the last 13 days. Lets see if the increase in volume translates into an appreciating stock price.
Could this stock double in a week to $32.90/shr or $1.65/shr pre-split basis??? Why yes captain...
Biggest question now.--- What stock will we have fun with tomorrow?
I am surprised
J meet J and JohnEnjoy each other
"Chinese Groupon has IPO tomorrow. The valuation is $28.8 billion. Investors might rethink that Groupon is only 10%, something wrong here!!!"
Wheres 2.88 at the Pshyciatrists office!!
The shorts are in charge at the moment. I wouldn't be surprised if the ER results are below expectations. All leading indicators point in that direction. Williams has the ability to reverse course by delivering a stellar quarter. Something he has yet to do as CEO.
No way ER was that great for a 50% Gain....
"Groupon earning will see below $10, i switch to JCPNQ today,"
"Not investable, until CEO leaves.."
Q4 EBITDA will be 120-130 million look out shorts
$6B no brainer
"This won't be allowed to go up til all the big boys have covered their shorts, they will use a shill analyst like Barclay to downgrade til they can cover all they need to, so have patience once they have covered its off to the races."
I'm new to this but they made .07 per share. it looks like the sell off has slowed
It’s worth at least 6.50
They had some interesting insights about GRPN on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
They will say this is another transitional year and they need more time for a turnaround!! Same old story...
SHORT this Puppy Every chance you can
"Too many people playing the weekly take over game, are leaving the playing filed each Friday. will have a better afternoon once those participants leave the game. You can't make money trading a sub 5 dollar stock on a weekly basis. GLTA #chartsneverwork"
"The Street is still buying into Groupon's association with problematic companies. Toxic headline. But, it comes from the same press that picked Hillary winning an election, etc. They are woefully unable to gauge what people are thinking and how brands and trends are perceived by the public. Groupon is now a comeback story and association with her brand are no longer negatives. If you need to publish and teach (""poop-on effect"" in business schools) that a brand is negative....it is probably not. Watch Poop-on go from Wall Street's most hated to the comeback kid. Sit back and enjoy."
"Why would anyone want to invest in a company who's stock is strongly trending down, company being sued by it's shareholders, has #$%$ management, in a bear market that wiped out a years worth of gains , and while a bioweapon virus pandemic sweeps across the globe affecting *groups* which is what Groupon's effective function is to bring together..... No, the up-spikes are people taking profits covering to buy their shorts. This stock is going to .01 cents until there is a Coronavirus vaccine which isn't for a year at least, THEN it has to pick up the pieces and rebuild which they do have the infrastructure to do but will take YEARS!Anyone buying this is either daytrading the ""buy to cover spikes"" or gambling long term with money they have to throw away like institutions which will accumulate slowly so the price keeps dropping for another year."
going under 3 tomorrow
Earnings today ?
Latest short interest data will be released after the market closes today.

"$ 4. Is a cheap cheap price if Baba consider to buy out Groupon now ,if they wait for Groupon ER next quarter , may need $6 ."
going to close $3
Grpn and yelp. A recipe for disaster
Fake news lures buyers in.. always drives this to $2.30.. .... earnings going to be bad.. can't wait till CEO leaves..
If new customers and mobile users increased a lot then this stock should fly...
"I am excited about the upcoming earnings report for GRPN. I see an improved bottom line due to the ""Order Up"" business. Also I see a lot of institutional interest and investments into GRPN. Some are speculating an AMZN buyout or GOOG or BABA or even FB. however, i think that GRPN and its O2O platform is a very desired business and will do great on its own now that theyu are focusing on the core business and removing non profeitable international business. i think that GRPN will be a major player in as little as two years and a partnership with either FB or Yelp will propel this company into the double digit share numbers."
"Oh no l, what do I do if GRPN crosses the 50 day moving average after I sold my shares earlier in the day when it broke the Moving Average on the down side. 4.62?"
70M+ volume.. looks like a short squeeze
GRPN is getting it's mojo back!
"buying more shares today. ""c'mon, groupon, let's go - move it up"""
this stock is going to explode today.
"Like I said last Friday. This stock will trade between 4.6 and 5.5 before earning. After touch 4.63 today, it will keep going up and close between 5 and 5.5 by this Thursday to wait for earning release."
"I think the big question to ask is...how much of the $750M in cash is going to be left after the 2nd Quarter? 2,800 employees let go with 60 days severance (Warn Act). April and May Revenue in trouble. No Earnings Report is probably a good idea!"
J rest in peace
sell sell and lose $$$$
LOL!!!!!!!!!
We are really in business if it holds 5.20 and heads higher again

"The climb continues with the 200 DMA chart that's forming the handle to take off in the next 6-months or so to the new highs past the $6.00 mark. The Directors of Groupon need to work to make the changes its needed to evolve, revolutionize and obtain market share in its industry."
Wow...Barry's back aka the Groupon good luck charm. Time for the rally to start. Thanks for coming back. I was getting nervous!!
This stock is the classic pump and dump. More proof it's easy to manipulate a stock.
Rich did a great job on CNBC this morning... hope we seen some new buyers
short sellers enjoyed for last 4-5 sessions. Its buy back time for them. Stock will bounce back to 36 and then touch 40 before this Friday.Todays closing clearly shows this pattern. Bounced back from strong support of 30 today.
Expectations seem pretty low this quarter. Share price is well below any of the analysts estimates. Wall Street must be expecting a miss. If they beat on bottom and top lines this should move quite a bit higher. Not sure why shorts wouldn’t be covering here.
The new Yahoo Finance layout sucks!
"now over 54 million suscribers,that subscriber base alone says take me baby"
Let’s see if we can sneak across $5.84!today
Multiple support levels have been breached. The stock is not acting well even with a slightly depressed market. On a positive note the volume has been below recent averages.

Are you guys awake?
Groupon is a very smart company. Due to the Corona this will be the best time fro Groupon to get back in the game. Retail is deal. Groupon is alive. As soon as they announce back to shopping this will go back $4-$5 and in a year with new partnership $30. No need to spit just announce positive news on shopping and we fly to the moon!!!!!!
J and JOHN aka Laurel and Hardy
People have no idea what to do and it's Friday so they will exit thier weekly position. Volume and volatility will shake your shares loose. Looks for price action to continue plus IBM verdict could come this afternoon. Stay long and ignore averything. It's going higher. GLTA
lets move this back up
"Groupon miss expectation and it is a suprise to me but im okay with reverse split.In short run, this will be painful but the reverse split might attract other big investors."
$5.84 seems to be the magic number
"This company is so out of tune with their customers,they are selling Yoga lessons as an example ,when they should be selling Yoga mats for use in ones own residence, just one example. And try contacting customer support? It doesn't exist. Meanwhile Amazon doing exact opposite they give customer service reply same day. This company could make barrels of money if they change a few things.Alibaba should buy this on the cheap and establish presence here to compete with amazon."
"Does anyone think that investing in the S.B ad will affect the earnings ( of course it will) if they didn't have the funds to invest to the ad or thought they were not going to do well? Then they wouldn't have done it! Its been years that they did an ad! Stay strong, long and be patient. The rattle has been out shaking out the weak with the markets move."
"There has to be some news out there, this is huge volume."
"I'm still not going out. My hopes is that it stays above $4.50 ....I still think its a great buy under $5 with one of the two happening, buyout or thrive. I have several investments under $5, really like Groupon and still think several adjustments need to be made, trimming the fat has been done and we should see a turnaround very soon. That earnings was not that bad. GLTA....GO GROUPON!"
why is it sinking so low when the rest of the market is HIGH! please explain
Im guessing Barry never received his Groupon Delivery?
"Heads up traders and investors! FED is tapping the brakes, and promises no more acceleration. All in, doesn't work anymore. Blue chips going down on good news. 8th inning, here folks. Guess I need to get my bear suit out for Halloween. gl"
"The uptick in short interest and end of quarter fund management leads me to believe the stock will continue to face pressure. GRPN needs a catalyst at this point. If management does not supply the impetus then there needs to be some analyst upgrades. Though I do not subscribe to their recommendations.The point being, the stock is mired in a holding pattern. Perhaps the buy interest showing up on Level 2 can be the spark the stock needs."
When the market corrects this will be an ez short imho
"Will have to wait for tomorrow real time trading. AH now, just not enoughvolume IMHO to establish true real price, just too sketchy on this volume."
Strong Buy. All Departments stores are closed. Groupon will profit a lot! https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/764789-cweb/5431890-why-groupon-stock-is-strong-buy
Obviously going to get bought out. I’d say next week some time. Wish I would have backed up the truck at 50 cents. Going to $5 folks. Enjoy the ride
Anyone else notice that the Groupon site is down?I get a Temporarily Unavailable message...
Just read that they are considering a reverse stock split. This company is headed in the wrong direction.
I am anxious to watch the final 45 minutes of trading today. The stock was in a pattern of high volume with some aggressive buying taking place. Todays action has been not stop selling......
https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/122407442/groupon-says-it-has-closed-its-new-zealand-business
keep trading and buying groupons!!!
Do in hear 4.89 top today by all my technical friends ?
"why is down today, any news?"
Nice close no volume. Guess you have to sell !
J how’s that chart looking?
Anyone see any company buying Groupon this year at a premium? say $6 per share...
She's forming a massive cup and handle that finalizes at $60 within the next 1-2 months.
TIMBER
Where's Neel?
Good time to short.. make money going up.. Make more going down!!
what time do we see earnings tomorrow? the vonference call is 10am pst right?
I ALOS LOVER MOVING AVERAGES LOOK HOW GOOD THEY WORKED FOR ALL THE BUYERS AT 4.87 THAT ARE HITTING THE STOCK AS IT TESTS THE 50DAY 4.65.
John/Hari cmon you’re falling behind. More comedy please.....
See ya in the $2’s :)
"GRPN says they're transitioning away from deep discounts, but isn't that why people use GRPN? If you're not looking for a discount, just go to yelp and choose a vendor."
annual sales is 3 billion
Market down 750! Sell sell sell!
good to short.. for 15%
"I have a online business, I see a lot traffic to my site since shutdown. I belive $GRPN got a lot traffic too. People will start to looking for coupons when the economic is slow. I can see Groupon either buyout or will hit $4.50 next year"
"GRPN has 2.8B in sales but yet can't get out of its own way. You look at other companies such as GrubHub, Overstock, TripAdvisor and Match Group all performing well and exceeding expectations. Williams has been with GRPN long enough 2+ years as CEO and 4 years as COO before that. He and Lefkofsky are tied at the hip. They keep issuing RSU's to mitigate any stock declines. Whatever happened to performance based compensation?Maybe FMR, Chase, BABA and other large shareholders can revolt. Where is Carl Icahn when you need him? Heck, I would even take Ackerman over Lefkofsky any day of the week."
What a Great stock!!
Come on. Break through 24.
Nothing has changed in this board since 2016.
So don’t look at the stock price. Look at our WOMAN CFO. Look at our two new WOMEN board members. Is the stock going up yet? No? But we’re adding WOMEN so it has to go up. Can we tell you about our CLIMATE CHANGE policy? We’re saying all the magic words and our stock is still tanking
"Remember Groupon turned down the Google’s offer for about $6 bil a few years ago? Now it’s only $1.6 bil company and maybe the board consider selling for the half of original offer? Anyway Groupon makes 4 cents per quarter, that is 16 cents per year (even excluding the future growth rate). This is more than 5% return on current stock price, which is awesome investment. Either way I will keep buying this stock over time as long as the price is under $6 or $7."
"I have 3 different sell order prices among my 24,000 shares. $84, $95 and $100."
I feel like they have a buyer at a low ball price like $6.50 and share price is being driven down to justify taking the bid
John celebrating 1.32...Oh dear
Today is the first time I have been in profits in GRPN in a long time.
Pppsssttt. It’s nearly in the 2’s but don’t tell JOHN
Groupon will reach $1.85 by April 30
Anyone shorting this before the earnings has a lot of guts!
Buyout coming? Amazon merger?
Let’s see if we can stay in the positive on such a down day
"Hi - I reached out to IR on earnings date. See their response below. Don't believe all the false prophets in this board.Hello,Per the 8-K that we filed in April, our next earnings release will be in June. We will announce the specific date via a press release as it gets closer.""The Company expects to file the Quarterly Report in June 2020 (but in any event no later than June 25, 2020 which is 45 days from the QuarterlyReport’s original filing deadline of May 11, 2020).""Thank you,Groupon IR"
this news should give it a bit of a pop
What's that saying...sell the news. Beautiful!
this company has money it's not hurting
"J and his charts, moving day averages,metrics,now telling you to double down....sad"
What is going on?
#prayforbrad
John tells you owning this stock is “good business sense”LOL!!!!!!!!!
"Groupon won't die... I get it honestly I really do, it's been a poorly run company for a while - and I love to short stocks too. But this is not the one (not right now at least..) too much cash, too many users, and a business model that doesn't require brick and mortar. There is a larger chance of this stock doubling in value, than it losing 50%.If you love numbers.. Long GRPN, if you love gambling... Short GRPN"
"Based on cashflow, cash on the balance sheet and guidance, this is a $40+ stock in December.Guillermo needed confirmation Q2 was not an exception. Here is Q3: it's a confirmation this is just the beginning of the new trend. And as Covid shrinks, revenues will double in a matter of 2 months. Which means Guillermo is positive we will see TRIPLE DIGITS within 3-4 quarters. Stay thirsty my friends."
Wasn’t GRPN supposed to report earnings today??
"Since Nov 2015 when current CEO started, the stock dipped from $8 to $3-$4. What a freaking disappointment. Today's earnings IMO are the last chance. Then based on performance he should RESIGN or be FIRED. Basically he got rid of all the growing markets (that were expensive to the company but consistent revenue growth) shrinking the company itself. Today they MUST show positive sign with revenues or get the founder back as CEO. It's been over 3 years and the stock price is JUNK. Unacceptable."
For those haters who don't use the mobile app or short sellers trying to make a quick buck know this: based on the current yearly average user growth rate trajectory Groupon is projected to accumulate 75 million active users in 10 years from the current 51. I want Groupon to remain solo but if my favorite shopping app obsession must be bought in order to flourish...so be it. I'm scared as hell about the wrong buyer taking over the company that changed my life.
Morgan Stanley downgraded stock this AM with a PT of $3.50
brad I unmuted you. You can chat now
Wow 4mm in 30 minutes
Groupon is still around? Didn't they destroy enough small businesses?
Maybe I’ll be up enough to get out. I bought at about 3.50
Can someone explain why did Groupon shares Skyrocketed?! Thanks
"This company is no longer a good short. Time to cover and make money elsewhere. If this goes down a $1. No big deal.. not worth the time of a real short seller, but a buyer yes.. that money has been made already.. This is a dead stock, let it Rest In Peace for the remaining $3's.. Alibaba will purchase for $2.50 someday.. amzn and tlry are better shorts or longs than grpn..."
what is happening with the stock
J what were you saying about the charts??
"$211 m in debt, $567m cash, TTM CF ops $193 m, TTM FCF of $120m. FCF yld of 8.6%. Maybe BABA buys it all!"
As you can see by the close still to many renters still trying to make 10 cents. Good luck
did they come out with earnings?
I got lucky. I was able to buy my shares back at the price that I had stupidly sold them on Friday.
"Brads Prediction this week $2, Poor Puffer"
"Yes I think the low is in. Hmmm.06 off a 52 week low on a green day. Maybe there was never a buyout? Elon Musk? Funding secured? Strangely of all the stocks I've shorted, there was never a bounce back rally other than the WedBush short cover.Try shorting Chipotle..."
"Levels of 17.91, 17.11, 14.49, 10.7, 5.33 are share price targets for Groupon Inc GRPN Downside intraday target 17.91Downside intraday target 17.11Downside short term target 14.49Downside mid term target 10.7Downside long term target 5.33"
Volume picking up
"Fire the CEO tomorrow, stock will rickety rocket up!!"
J and JOHN in a hug
"Dont worry Brad we will donate some wings for you, We know your Broke!!"
cc tomorrow. Earnings tonight
"If GRPN continues to trade below $1.00 / share it will be delisted from NASDAQ, and will have to move to OTC or ""Pink Sheets"" markets, where there are no big institutional investors to support it. GRPN last closed above $1.00 on March 9, so as of close on 3/24 that's 11 days closing under $1.00. It has to close above $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, hard to see that bounce above $1.00 anytime soon - IMHO!"
The meeting was today does anyone know the outcome of the reverse split.
Groupon FOURLOUGHS sales staff. Grpn is too retail heavy (brick and morter) to survive. Good bye.
"Ticket monster valuation $4.2B. Something the company will not acknowledge, nor any analyst will speak of, since they like to keep this B down. Soon this company will be a free giveaway.. I think 2.88 makes sense now to me.."
now you can buy a groupon on groupon stock..44% off!
The company has $245M remaining on its prior share repurchase program initiative. I wonder if there will be any purchases during this free fall....
I think Guillermo is rightThis is going to 100
I suspect Lefkofsky will be dumping another 1.5M - 2M shares in the next week or so. His sales have been fairly consistent.
Brad and .01
Who uses Groupon anymore? Serious question.....
Can anyone explain the drop?
much higher after march 12.....
Interested to get comments on the volume today. Based on recent history GRPN may trade 14-16M shares today. Personally I like the interest in the stock. I know the shorts may have an itchy trigger finger with 53M borrowed shares. I would love to see a squeeze just like TWTR.
"Groupon did not issue a new 250 million offering, the only offering done was in Apr16, to Comcast, what people are reading in investor relations is just the year end paperwork that needs to be filed because its still outstanding!!!!"
This settlement should affect next quarter and leave it lingering with a lose.
Buy buy
"when corporate profits take a hit, they all will be on groupon. I mean big box and corporates. but they need to ask for bigger volumes and less take. it's better than sending a coupon in the mail since that is not a garentee and adds to green house gas. but to add this management does not know what they are doing and are not marketing correctly. not a fan of this management that is unable to deliver. lots of people have already quit."
"What's that smell? Smells like they're cooking the books...Lowered expectations, lowered. Shedding employees and revenues. RW a seller I believe."
"This is crazy. They beat Wall Street expectations and raised guidance . Buying back shares and the stock price is down . Pure manipulation, Wall Street made a mistake and they Wanna your shares at cheaper price !!"
WHY on earth wouldanyone throw money at this dog. DECLINE. It wa a big joke that it was going up. This will be $1 soon.
Where are the longs?
Holding again for over 5.Added more on dip into low 4s.Rinse and Repeat!
"Since earnings GRPN has not had one day that ended positive. For the cheer leaders out there, the market has been on a tear and this stock has depreciated aka ""dripped"" downward every trading day. What about this company or stock gives you the inkling that it will be turning around soon? BTW its almost time for your Chairman to sell another 1.5M - 3M shares.How many insiders have bought shares on the open market in the past 6 months, year, 1.5 years?"
"The reality of the situation is that GRPN should go nowhere until one of three things happen, deal or no deal and or earnings. So therefore any other movement is based solely on overall market moves or large one way order flow like this morning. Analyst haslve no idea what to do with this stock just like in the past, not one has been correct anticipating it's direction. Sit and wait for news and stop speculating with a postiond and or stock that is dead until further news."
"We went through days like this, during the middle of June until the end of June....and then things moved up again for awhile. :)"
"Buy NUMD, improving lives through Inhaled Nitric Oxide (INO) delivery systems."
Cramer just recommended a buy for grpn
split is not good for 99% of the company but maybe good for GRPN? who knows?
Looks like those supporting the bear side are the winners. This stock will be in the 1’s tomorrow. What about this report can be construed as positive? I’m anxious to learn what the pumpers have to say.
True POS
"If more potential buyers are added to the mix, and we all know who they are. I see a double from here."
"The quarter was above plan. Revs, GP and ebitda. Company focused on beat and raise."
"Grpn got rid of its phone number, it’s just a recorded message telling you to chat online or send an email. Must be cutting costs like crazy. It wasn’t easy to find the chat on the website though. You have to click on the FAQ page 1st"
We'll be back up tomorrow. At least that's while I'll keep telling myself.
Proxy vote today on reverse split.
John you just lost a lot of money and will not get it backHow do you feel?
Poor John. Is he still alive?
Can anyone explain why the book value per share dropped from 13.90 pre reverse-split to the current 6.73/share?
Grpn is just going up in long run
I guess that I'll stay for a while.
Buckle up to $36 before Xmas.
GRPN - the Rodney Dangerfield stock of the Nasdaq gets no respect whatsoever.
Can this be a $50 stock in a year???
@FER where are you and what do you make of this stock pattern?!
Don’t worry. Guilermo tells you it’s going to be a $500 stock
"Looks like Morgan Stanley wants to buy more shares so they gave a ridiculously low PT for GRPN through 2019 @ $4.50 per share. This note is what is causing a big bump in pre market activity. Over 125K shares traded.Anyone hear anything else beyond the Morgan Stanley BS?This is why GRPN's management needs to get ahead of possible detractors like MS, GS etc. Doesn't help morale at the office when most of the leaderships compensation is directly tied to the stock price."
"Can only go down from here, 800M cap with 600M debt...Yelp,google and all the other already has Groupon like features"
any news on this pop?
"At the midpoint of EBITDA outlook for 2018, grpn would have an EV/EBITDA ratio of around 4.7, based on today’s pps. For many value investors, that ratio is downright mouthwatering."
"wow, thats even better than I expected, and I am a long term bull, this should be trading around 8, based on the numbers."
over $36 this week.
"Amazing volume, somethings clearly up."
There it is. a very nice collapse at the open! :-)
According to Yahoo finance this years earnings estimates were raised from .19 to .24 in the past few weeks.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-bottom-bouncing-opportunities-151500033.html
"That was a weird open, actually covered a portion down at 25.08then it popped up again where I thought it would hit my limit for another short.Think it might be a tough week for Groupon."
"Go 20, Go 20, Go 20!"
"Its time for a class action lawsuits, C.E.O. must GO!"
come on 1.50 then over 2
"CEO, Please step down, Give other people an opportunity, Give Groupon an opportunity to survive. Give GRPN holder a hope for the future. We beg you!"
Street Insider is reporting a .02 miss with revenues of 873M
If management puts together another two quarters there will be more believers and should see 8.
Can't wait for the earning call....those #s will be disasterous. .15 cents soon.
"Groupon says it has closed its New Zealand businessThe company’s website carried a similar message.The Groupon phone number had a message saying that their phone lines were currently closed.One Groupon customer, Ethan, said the site closing down was a big surprise as it always seemed to be full of deals.He joined in early July to buy a watch, but was sent one that was different to the one he wanted.He was refunded in Groupon Dollars, which could not be used or redeemed now, he said.Vouchers were issued specifically to a vendor so the customer only needed to make an appointment with the service to redeem it, while the Groupon Dollars sat in the customer’s account to use through the website, which no longer offered any deals."
Brad must be Puffing hard today!!
20Million users * $200 spend = $4B
GRPN is down 13.95% to 0.74

"low volume till now, ppl waiting on sidelines?!"
Guilermo tells you it’s going to $500LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
buy now; 2 indecision candles. bears are losing strength. they can't sell any lower.
Johns lost without Hari Kinda sad
"Short money was made shorting at 35 on June 8, and covering at 20, 3 days later for a sweet 40% pop.Those guys are sipping top shelf margaritas about now, and you guys are trying to elbow your way inand do it again when the uncertainty is gone and the expectations have been beaten. There are plentyof free websites out there that could help improve timing, Mr. Market doesn't know or care about your timing or what you feel entitled to. Go ahead, try to talk it down tomorrow as well."
Sorry if I missed the post… But does anyone know when they’ll be reporting 2Q?
Please please see this as the failure it always has been. Save YOU from yourself.
A GIFT AT THIS LEVELS. BUY BUY BUY. GROUPON WILL ANNOUNCE ANY DAY GOING BACK TO SHOPPING DEALS.
"If your considering buy this stock and wonder why all the kvetching it is because the people complaining about this stock buy it after the stock pops 30-50% and they complain the whole way back down. Please look at the charts. Buy the dips ( 4.10-3.50) sell the pops. There will be another pop I promise you (my guess a collaboration with Comcast)but you have to sell it not buy or your be another complainer. This stock will take off for real when they totally blow out earnings, which i think will happen sometime in '17 ."
"Triple digits is AROUND THE CORNER. Guillermo wants to remind everyone this was a $20 stock during the 2013 economy comeback. That, at reverse split prices, translates into $400 price today.And this comeback is going to be WIDER and DEEPER than the big recession. Remember this time we have millions of people dying to go out, travel, experience, enjoy. And they have millions of dollars to spend. Stay VERY greedy my friends."
.01..He knows his worth!!
GRPN reached an all time low at 0.96
Let's break the barrier of $5.25 and position for $6 today.
"Short 1000 shares at 24.40. Tomorrow will be a blood bath before earnings, and then more carnage after earnings. We about to make a killing."
GRPN has a 0.20 time revenue valuation. That is ridiculous. Once the CEO is announced we will go back to a 5-10 time revenue valuation and the PPS will skyrocket.
The surprised earning date announcement yesterday destroy the momentum. Up with 40M volume and back with 6M volume. The short term and long term chart still looks good. Big roller coaster this week! The resist of $5.5 is pretty strong and will be conquered next Friday.
"If GRPN stayed the same for the next decade in terms of it's financials it would be 3$. 3blm in revs, breakeven with 700mm in cash. It's a must own here regardless of a buy out. They need a partner to grow to 10bln and they know it to provide shareholders with a value proposition. It's cheap period, the merger or buyout it inevitable"
it is going green again
John you told the board “Owning this stock is good business sense “??
Nobody beats Johns comedy Man I miss him
"With shareholders restless, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is pursuing an acquisition to juice its performance, the WSJ reports, and the big target could be Yelp (NYSE:YELP).• Yelp is up 3.5% postmarket following the news.• That could merge business reviews with deal offers and transactional services for customers engaging with merchants.• It would also result in synergies that could save $200M, sources told the WSJ.• “It is reasonable to conclude that a relatively large acquisition by Groupon is forthcoming,” says Chapman Capital founder Robert Chapman, whose firm had been building up to a 1.5% stake but sold Tuesday since Chapman thinks a big acquisition is too risky.• And during the company's July earnings call, CEO Rich Williams said “We see the potential to create a much, much bigger business that is a growth business that can be a part of consumers’ and merchants’ everyday lives."""
The main reason this keeps getting beaten down is because it is easy to manipulate. 88% of shares out is owned by insiders/ institutions. Of the remaining 12% half is shorted. With the buyback program the 12% is shrinking.
"I think this definitely trades sideways for 3 months until next ER, anything else would surprise me, and in August big pop, but that's what I thought pre ER for 1Q 2017. We didn't expect big numbers of course for 1Q but watch out 2Q, 3Q, and 4q I hope Kramer is right"
Only up bc the entire market is.....we will see red again soon...can't wait to get out of this stock!!
Market cap 643M at today's share price. Cash 779M gives a 21% potential upside as the Company is finding direction on cost-cutting and drive growth.
"Since we are on the subject in the financial press of taking companies private, I think Andrew Mason should take Groupon private. He has a passion for this company, and would make it thrive."
they're discussing for reverse split tmrw or on wenesday. Probably would fall.
"Fer, we need your positive vibes!! Decent spring break numbers continue for us as a merchant."
i better use my groupon for kayaking b4 the bk
Too many people trading a binary event for a stock that is so cheap relative. Just sit and wait.
Groupon bought?????
AR where are you??You’re comedy sorely missed
"it is worth every penny of that cashflow, that is $80 a share."
Remember when SODA was dead !
Groupon Announces Second Quarter 2020 ResultsCompany Reports Second Quarter Adjusted EBITDA Above Outlook RangeGenerates Over $70 Million of Free Cash Flow During the QuarterSees Local Business Improvement from April to June• Second quarter revenue of $396 million and gross profit of $137 million• Second quarter loss from continuing operations of $73 million• Second quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $1 million• Second quarter GAAP net loss per diluted share of $2.53• Second quarter non-GAAP net loss per diluted share of $0.93• Ended the second quarter with $785 million in cash
Over 10 million shares traded and a close over 20 cents is a great sign for a Monday.
"Not a huge concern, but some insider selling and some share dilution announced in the last week. Ive been burned by this before so... That being said, 8 million shares plus of institutional buying props it up. Im still long from $4, but experience gives me a trigger finger on the sell button."
"What we see is a company that is more profitable than last year, even though sales are less so are expenses..step up the buybacks........."
01. For your thoughts...not even worth that!!
$61.50 hit. Go higher high today. $63 before the close.
"FWIW, Comparing the trading leading up to last quarter and this quarters earnings is night and day. Volume last quarter was 2.5X and the price fluctuation was frenetic. If you recall we saw the stock up 8% with a few minutes of trading to go only to see it finish up less than 2%. Furthermore the intraday trading was a steady ascent upward then the floor dropped. Today on the other hand was a rather orderly day, volume relatively light for the first 4-5 hours. Some downward pressure but not crazy selling. Buyers started to appear about an hour before the close. Most of the volume were interested buyers with trades hitting the ask price. Based on this very small sample size of activity, analysis and recent trends, I expect good news for GRPN shareholders tomorrow."
"They can’t run with big boy tech. Not so sure it will fail. Transparency is imperative. Experiences is the way to capture the space and make it their own. Let’s see... might be a bargain stock, time will tell. Sidelines for now."
"price action today is typical short seller who cant get anything off on a zero plus tick and is looking to take it to the 200 to break it. The volume is low, Stay. The renters are selling not the owner. Its only getting better not worse for the company."
Why is this 30? They’ve lost almost 8 dollars a share... wow
"These guys are dead. Accounts unable to access Groupon. Password resets that don't work. Customer service that sends same password resets that don't work, millions a day in lost revenue. What a horrible company."
Hot pockets or hot hand? 5% stake held by MIG Capital. Good luck with a dead cat bounce...Groupon running out of lives.
it does that people trigger buys after that pop so most likely it will fall
Bought in today .91
Shorts trying to influence the narrative
Why does this stock go down when market goes up? Can anyone answer?
"Does Wall Street have this company all wrong? When I look at the ""Apple Event"" going on at Groupon right now, there are items that have sold more than 100,000 each (cables). Wall Street likes to print that any company - recently Costco and Nike - must be desperate simply for using Groupon. Maybe marketers at those companies already realize Groupon has staying power and a very positive brand image with upper income urban mom's, and is gaining momentum nationally. There is no such thing as ""The Groupon Effect"". The most money you can make on Wall Street is being on the opposite side of an emotional trade. I think the past 2-3 years' debacle in Groupon stock were an emotional oversell. We will see."
Why are we dropping I do not get it
Some NEGATIVE posters who are not current shareholders sure missed this runup.
On the call they didn’t mention anything about reverse split and the analyst didn’t ask them about reverse split also??????
GRPN Alibaba when will you buy GRPN? Alibaba billionaire buys the Brooklyn Nets for U.S. pro sports record $2.35 billion
"Any investor in Groupon should also invest in actual vouchers.. otherwise you will lose money, So ten shares a quarter needed for them to succeed, keep doing this until they hit a $1B in revenue per quarter, otherwise no love for this stock... Short it and be happy.."
Way to read charts in the first 30 minutes. Was able to buy again at 4.70. Anyone see a pattern ? Deals happen over weekend most of the time. Not that one will but they don't call it merger Mondays for no reason.
"Long time holder. With the new CEO, GRPN has started an uptrend reflected by the chart starting in May 2017 at $3. From there a CONTINUOUS uptrend has begun (analysts finally acknowledging positive effect of restructuring).This trend is 100% similar to 2013 uptrend, where from Feb to Sept the stock (8 months) continued uptrend from $4 to $12. Which, by analogy, tells me we should get to $10 by January. Reason being is the final stock price acceleration from $8 to $10 which can be achieved in just few weeks. Been there, done that."
"Priceline was at below $5 once and now $1,800"
"Market higher, Grope on lower. Summer volumes. See you at $4..."
John it’s now about to go onto 1’sAll of you’re posted buys are deep in the red nowOuch
52 week low....
Great - now it should go up to like $40 or $50
"Fellow GRPN owners here is my .02 FWIW, the results were good, not great. FCF, EBITDA, customer growth and revenue very good. EPS below expectations. Guidance was disappointing but understandable. More transparency than what I expected. I believe the overly cautious tone is their way of ""under promising and over delivering"". Am I happy with how the stock is performing...absolutely not. Am I happy with a so/so mixed bag with regard to earnings...absolutely not. The company is profitable and growing on a number of fronts. This is appealing. They appear to be investing in growth vs. managing expenses which is also good. The balance sheet is solid.I will continue to hold."
"Fer escaped again in his hospital gown,all covered in ketchup"
Is anyone buying up grpn dirt cheap??
"Bet we finish up at least a nickel! Give me $.05 cents every day till Friday, that’s all I ask. "
I think punishment has been given and expection has been removed
Wheres the comedy of Fer when you need it?
Who thinks this company will do well on cyber Monday?
FER WAS RIGHT 2.88
"Management will sell this company like a Groupon, 90% off fair value.. get out and save your money.."

"Fall out, hope to stay above open."
"Possibly a decent time to buy in, GRPN is being thrown out with the baby and the bathwater based on the Supreme Court ruling, but the truth is GRPN has always had the merchants be responsible for the taxes, it is in each contract."
How much will this fall next weekend...
"put high sell orders, that way shorts can't borrow your shares and push the price down, $7.50 it is"
"It is so weird Groupon still haven’t announced the earning date yet. Based on history Groupon announce earning date 16 days in advance, so Q2 earning date will be after Aug 9 for now. which is way late than estimate. Something behind to postpone earning release. I guess there will be other big news release before earning...."
I haven’t seen any bad news about this company but I have seen more positive news in recent past (few weeks).
what is this lawsuit going to do drive stock even lower?
possible buy out now...
I was hoping the write-up in Barron’s about Groupon+ would have given the stock a boost. Maybe tomorrow.
Short squeeze this back to Mid $40s
what does Yelp give people that left reviews?
Just bought 1000 shares. Let's see what happens (fingers crossed)
Going under 1. John has lost a lot of money LOL!!!!!!
"Wow, I thought $GRPN is dying and now it's going to moon."
going down soon.. all credit cards have moved into groupon+ niche market. nothing special about this company. be on the right side of the trade---long term short.
"The whole market is down, don’t panic!"
They are on life support.. did the reverse split because it is going down big after earnings.. they do not give this company a pass. Facebook will be acquiring in the next year.. just hold..
# 5.25 today
"Groupon merchants need to be more fair and accurate about the after result of customers using Groupons. Example. I did a test late last year. 1 market so the sample is small. However, please read further.1)A restaurant manager told me they lose money on Groupons. When I asked about add-on's he admitted that drinks and deserts do get added but he did not know the amounts. DOH! Bad move on your part. Need to include all sales from a Groupon!2) A Conceal Weapon course owner told me he makes minor profit on selling the course. He then freely admitted that he ""Cleans up"" selling the advance course after and better yet custom grips for folks weapons. The grips are high margin, like $90 each yet his cost is $20.3) An oil change place owner informed me that they barely break even on a Groupon oil change. However, as in other examples, he then proceeded to tell me he sells a lot of wipers for vehicles. Also, an occasional brake job or other related car repairs. Note: This is a Full Service station.So...merchants...please be totally inclusive of all customers purchases or add-ons when you tally up the results from your Groupon Marketing efforts!!!!"
PAR capital dumped 35 million shares
52 week low $1.4 sub $1 soon
GRPn voted the best stock in the world to short. lol
I keep blocking these people posting this long post that goes to link they use multiple names. Reported but Yahoo does nothing
This company will go down to a buck as they have no business model plan and not profitable. They failed to go back up to the same level as when they first issued their IPO. It’s been over 10 years and they can’t make it.
Ok Missy
10% short ...ouch buyout news imminent going to squeeze em all out
$5 finish!
"Lets give credit to the CEO, doing a great job turning this company around! All the 2017 partnerships, Groupon+, Credit cards, superbowl commercial are paying off! 2018 the turnaround year!!!"
Never fall in love with any stock just set your target profit and sell if you achieve that.
John and J thought this was a good investment 
3/5/18Morgan Stanley Upgrades Groupon (GRPN) Underweight -> Equal Weight
"what happened to those posters that were shorting at $56? Guillermo sees few changed their username, some deleted their comments, some simply disappeared. Kids played with fire and got burned!Stay greedy my friends this is just the beginning!"
Target price of GRPN was revised to $4.23.
"I am not short, but will $2 be a good and safe entry point is a question. Please help or hint."
Short interest increased to 46M shares in the most recent reporting period. This is approximately 10M more shares short than in mid June. The bad news is sentiment continues to be somewhat negative based on solely on the number of shares short. The good news is any kind of good news will propel the stock price even higher to allow for the shorts to cover. The days to cover did decrease based on the high volume days the stock had in late June because of the upgrade.
say what you want but 32 cents equates to about the patent lawsuit. And no matter who wins this gets appealed.
Anyone sensing Green day here?
Grpn making a comeback.forget the 164 milion dollar.lol
More red tomorrow boys.
Dan and Guilermo you would’ve loved JOHN
"We can easily see green today.We are now ready for the buyout announcement.As shown last week there is big interest in accumulating shares. At these levels means a buyout would happen between $7 and 7.50. But a bidding war is not to be excluded. Because of Trump's war to China, Chinese companies now have to have a presence on US soil to succeed. So there might be 2-3 Chinese companies which are making their moves for GRPN. If that is the case the stock could easily double from here. Valuation wise GRPN could already trade $6-7 without a buyout. With a bidding war prices will be in the teens. GLTA"
Cover while you can
Solid business in place. Fidelitys Danoff holds a lot
Buyout today!!! HAHAHAHA.....nope and nope
this stock will be a gold mine just like amazon and ebay bullish!!!!!!
.50 cents today for Le Poooopon
What does groupon do nowadays? Still ripping off restaurants?
"what was meant by the comment that Groupon ""owes all its cash to BABA and Comcast"".??"
Oh JohnLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
J in rehab?
Dead money until someone buys GRPN. Was surprised that GRPN beat on revenue that wasn’t suppose to happen according to the genius analyst!
Seen this before - Stock goes higher just before earnings and then falls after the earnings are announced. I sold many months back but waiting to see if earnings provide the clues needed to get back in. Good luck.

Noting net distribution today...large blocks sold at highs leading into close .
When will we reach the bottom on this current drop?Or...when will the faithful buy again to go long?Opinions are appreciated.
Can someone tell me why they purchased long at $25 or more ?
Brad made a appointment with .01's shrink!! what a sad case they both are!!
This is going to feel like a hangover tommorow morning. L.O.L
"We are approaching towards a Golden Cross with the (WEEKLY) 50 DMA that will be crossing the 200 DMA very soon now. The Nay Sayers are becoming nervous and the Short Sellers will be heading towards the exit doors. Add, Add, Add …. G.L.T.A. Longs!"
I bet all the shorties are ready to lock and load. This is going to be epic 
"earnings today? I see a huge beat, 30% up after hours. That should project the stock back to 2s in June, 3s by next quarter. We will get also a big name for CEO.And if I tell you, that it is going to happen, believe me. It's me, Guillermo Puertas world known multi-billionaire."
J still sipping his koolaid not worried one bit. Grpn a solid winner to him
Seems like a buyout coming!! Even Cramer said buy.. time cash or crash in
"Another new low finally brought about short-cover rally by fast money traders. Insiders?? Fuguglyer chart. Nice weekend to bulls, bears and elephants in the room."

Brad I think you are more my type ￼
The board of Directors should be replaced if this is how the run a business please sell out to amazan
I will wait for 0.8-0.9 to buy.

Did they think rs is going to solve the problem!
J this goes to $1 and you will still be in love with it
Grpn is going to be bought out very soon
"Ever Googled"" Groupon reviews""? Makes me glad I'm out...not bashing, just sayin', read some reviews."
I am interested to hear reasonable explanations as to why GRPN traded down on a day when the market was up 400 points. I know the stock was up over 5% on Friday but todays losses are tough to explain.
Are we on a upward trend!! Buy Buy Buy!!
I told you so. Many believed and stayed long.Others mocked and missed the boat.
"Time for Guillermo to further scare the little shorties here.Etsy somewhat comparable to GRPN. One of the many out there.Let's see some numbers.ETSY 2020 revenues $2BGRPN revenues $1.6BLet's look at the market caps for a sec. Market cap for the beginners is the 'size' of the company according to wallstreet, that is number of shares times price per share.ETSY $32B fair.GRPN $1.6B . No it's not a typo. It's not $16B it is $1.6B . Who's laughing now?This with Groupon during the pandemic. This is with Groupon and very little revenue from experiences. So revenue is possibly doubling in the next MONTHS, not years, MONTHS.So is $1.6B a fair valuation. Looking at ETSY, maybe $5B could be fair. Maybe. So we are talking of a price per share between $150 and $200.Guillermo's question: does it make sense to short under $100 a share?Amateurs, LOL"
Almost 3 hours in and less than 1M shares traded. Low volume is one thing. Total disinterest is another and that’s what is happening here. I guess the silver lining is institutions are “holding”. Should any firm start to dump the bottom could drop out.
"bye, by, buy"
Will go lower. Radioactive now. Stay away let it settle before you buy back in or average down. (If at all).
"Hopefully Brad will use Groupon to find a new Shrink, Doctors will be advertising on Groupon soon!!"
Retailers slumped today because they are losing to online retailers. Time to load up on AMZN and GRPN
"Downside volume tell the whole story. Don't be surprised to see this stock close to unchanged at day's end, just saying."
"Groupon is actually more useful than FB every day,... They crushed expectations. wow.."
JOHN tells you going to 3.40
Now the question is can GRPN hold its gains with the market reversing? Volume is unusually low. As others have pointed out this stock trades in a contrarian manner. Just over 3 hours to go before the market closes.
John Hari MicLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Tiime to buy again and hold.
"Hold you horses. Reverse split will be proposed and can be voted down. It is NOT a done deal.And if this CEO is gone tomorrow as I strongly BELIEVE, the RSplit story is over. Get a CEO with some attributes and this thing is over $5 this year, period. All you need is to do some partnership/alliance with big names (thing that used to happen with Lefkofsky and done deal. Like with BABA: Groupon was supposed to partner with BABA. What did Williams do? NOTHING. A complete zero."
6:50 tomorrow 
No they have no idea why it went up or why it's going down so thier pre concived bias tells them to sell beucase it always goes down. Plus you have players that bought it because it was going up now need to exit. Plus charts always work can't you see how well. Stay long
"For those of you who believe the Lefkofsky selling is not a material event think again. He does not have to sell the shares on the open market. He could, if there was a willing partner, negotiate a prearranged sale with an institution or interested buyer to sell a block of shares. This would have a couple of benefits....it would stop the quarterly bleed of his sales and downward pressure of the stock and it could identify the firm/individual purchasing his shares, though not a guarantee. I have no problem with founders and officers selling except when the stock trajectory is pointed downward. Look at FB, Zuckerberg and Koum have sold millions of shares. They announced their intentions and provided clarity on the rationale for selling. That kind of transparency does not exist at GRPN."
LIST ONE S0LID GOOD FUNDAMENTAL REASON TO GO ON HOLDING THIS STOCKLET ALONE BUY MORE
"35 million americans need to buy 7 or more groupons, and we have a winner. Actually 20 to 50 a year is realistic if you are a person that likes to eat or go do things. It is very easy to do and does become addicting saving money and having fun!"
This is a 250+ million dollar day for the market cap on good volume. Something is up. I can’t find any news. Maybe major short pos is covering?
Watching this stock trade on level 2 is eye opening to say the least. The shorts are definitely in charge. The price action is robotic. Unless huge blocks come in the price will stay flat or lower. There have been relatively few blocks on the bid. Someone wants this stock at this price.
"I will not be surprised that Google, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are watching Groupon like a hawk as Groupon will become unstoppable competition in the on line retail business."
"Why isn’t Rich Williams being replaced, his performance is disastrous, this company didn’t show any profit since inception, Why is he still there?"
where did all our friends/longs go?
This Stock could Drop to .90 cents soon
low volume trading again .
Great buying opportunity
10k shares @ 3.67....good move?
Ticket monster's valuation is never accounted for in this stock.. current value is $3.5B. They are waiting till it goes public.
On its way to the 2's J happy as can be
BABA could be one of these that want buy GRPN
John getting real frustrated now. Can’t even do his cross puzzle
any negative news that justifies the fall? ..anyone? ..near resistance price?
"GRPN does not have a lot of analyst coverage, but the most recent call was by 5 star Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. On 5/7/20 he recommended a Hold on GRPN, with a 12 month price target of $18.00. It will be interesting to see if he updates this call tomorrow. A PT raise to, lets say, $20, would not be helpful to the stock. :-)"
big overreaction by sellers
They are out in market looking for buyers and Davidson just put a $12 take out value on them
https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=16345173&gfv=1
If GRPN can continue to find a nich as they have been doing ....then this is only the start of a long run higher. The next earnings report will show us if they are on track.
Volume has dried up...the stock needs some sort of catalyst. Trading 7M shares after an average of 9.3M shares over the past 90 days is worrisome. The price action is OK considering markets craziness.
Serious Question: Who is jumping in on the Class Action Lawsuits and with whom that is listed?
28.50 above bet later in the day

"More or less a merger, both companies combine at a 6 billion valuation, Yelp will lose out.. grpn doubles.."
"Maybe they should diversify and/or pursue a completely different business model and start ""Groupon Green"" to participate in the growing marijuana market? I need a coupon from Groupon to get my Grey Poupon delivered from Blue Apron......"
"Shareholders, let us send emails to IR@groupon.com asking CEO to step down. this is the only hope that this stock can rise."
Christian hows that close of over 5 looking?? LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"The stock continues to drip downward. I am not worried. I stopped reading the charts and have the support of some GRPN message board posters. This is all I need. Besides if I lose these important attributes, I still have hope and time on my side. All is well in GRPNville. Kumbaya to all!"
The final nail in the coffin. Poor John 
Looking at it from the view that everything else is going down anywayDOESN'T HELP 1 BITall its doing is absolving the do-nothing management
"All we know is that this stock is not a turnaround candidate. Just buy Groupons, not the stock. CEO leaving?"
Short interest decreased to just over 40M shares. This represents 7.5% of the float. Overall not that significant.Today’s action was ugly however volume was light. As FER mentioned GRPN crossed below the 50 DMA. This typically is considered bearish. GRPN needs to regain some of the momentum from earlier this month and soon!
sudden spike

Grpn bullish
Breaking News! GRPN $5 tomorrow!!
"if AMZN has a forward P/E of 90, a price to sales of 3.60,GRPN with a forward P/E of 23 and a price to sales of .072....anyone good at math?I see a 5x factor between the 2. Like Groupon is 5 times undervalued compared to Amazon!!! (90/23 or 3.60/.72...)that means that if Groupon were trading at 5x $4.00 = $20 would be as fairly valued as Amazon is...So, based on that, a $10 price per share in 2017 is nothing crazy, if the company confirms revenues and cost controlling. That would also justify the recent 30% stock appreciation. Obviously the first stop would be $5-$6, but then we could head to $10 by Q4. I invite everyone to check with their brokerage on Groupon performance under the current CEO. He has always beat on earnings and revenues...so a pretty good record. GRPN reorganization started 2 years ago and now the finish line is in sight: few profitable quarters which would bring us to double digit stock evaluation.GLTA"
"If you time 20 for today's price based on November 11th, 2011 price of $485 without the reverse split, it will be like trading at nearly $900 dollars. I would love to see Groupon to continuously growing and to at least go to the IPO cost of $240 dollars."
new company will have between $55 to 80M operating profit in 2021.. It's not as bad as everyone is making it sound. They can buy back stock at this price. As they most definitely did. Plenty of assets that can be sold if cash is needed. .
"I just contributed to the 2nd qtr, airport parking and a nice massage....."
"Just buy the company is sold, learn metrics,,,,,,,,,3.50,,,, babba"
"that chart today, hmmm"
Made up for yesterday's losses and then some. News coverage today. Buyout imminent
I am not convinced the selling is entirely related to the Lefkofsky activity. His trades occurred last week with the filing on Friday. GRPN would have seen more selling Friday and Monday if that were the case. I believe the short increase has an impact. Let's see how the day goes. Not happy with the 5+% haircut in 45 minutes of trading. Volume is above average for the start of the day. Maybe this is a strategy to shake out some week hands.
"The earning release numbers are very impressive, this is the stock that I would like to hold for the long term.It is a fast growth eCommerce company, and that means that the share price could be $7 to $8 within one year, $30 in a couple of years, and $200 in 7 to 10 years."
Nice move on GRPN over the past few trading days. Congrats to those who continue to hold. Fundamentals remain the same. Technicals are improving especially with the recent run up. Volume remains light though this seems to be endemic with many other stocks. Some of this action can be short covering based on the 40M shares that are currently short. Wish I was in but happy for those that held.
Time to load up the truck
"For goodness sake, why is this stock tanking 5% a day?"
Will we see 5 today?
Groupon Cl A (GRPN) reported a 1st Quarter March 2020 loss of $1.63 per share. The consensus estimate was a loss of $1.92 per share.
"Technicians will be looking to stay above approximately 5.20 level… If it holds, expect that technicians will have a positive view. This looks like a decent shot for those that are late to the party right here. You know your downside risk and we seen the start of the upside in my opinion"
Every once in a while I come back to check on GRPN .. Took my loss and sold it at 3.50 bought more heavily in the Marijuana sector to try and recoup.. I wish you all luck I just don’t see GRPN ever making a comeback unless they change their whole business model or a another major company combines with them. Maybe I am a wrong but after a several years of owning GRPN I had to cut my losses. Good luck to all.
"Can anyone on this board provide a decent analysis of Groupon statements,"
"@Mike -- Saying that the Dow is ""headed to 40,000"" . . reminds me of a fake British chap (actually from Canada, in the form of Mike Myers) . . . who demanded a ransom of . . . one MILLION dollars! Ah . . . umm . . . one BILLION dollars!!! No . . . make it one TRILLION dollars!!!!Why not say the Dow is headed to 400,000, for MAGA's sakes!"
"This is a great direction this chart is moving towards, it will give everyone a chance to add before it becomes to late or they can add at later times when it moves further up. I am standing by this as a HOLD and Buy too add to your position. G.L.T.A longs!"
Sad to say I bought in at 5.12 and have not seen much profit. Might take the loss and pull out
see you at + $5 after hours
Guilermo tells you it’s going to $500....
"Anything? On occasion, the crowd sourcing value of sites like this can find reasons for unusual stock price moves. Based on volume being traded - and the fact that that volume is not slowing with price spikes - I presume there is a buyer out there who thinks they can get this via a hostile in the open market more cheaply then via a clean takeover. Hostile buyer will also smoke out all the shorts very quickly. Or....this could simply be an unexplained bounce due to reverse. An auditor may have stupidly told family about coming earnings, and there could be some trading on material non-public info. Insight from anyone who's got it would be appreciated. Or...maybe FER is right, and this is simply technical in some way. I doubt the last theory (FER being right) though."
Look at ALL the lawsuits.
Groupon also buying back 300 million dollar buyback..hmmm writing is on the wall
Grpn is making a comeback.

"can no get customer support anymore. the phone recording says go to the web page where ""you can connect with an agent if you need to"". No luck there (using my laptop). Trying now through the mobile app. Lots of hoops to jump through to get to live chat. Waiting for an agent for past 5 minutes. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! Will definitely not invest in this stock."
Just picked up some shares @ 21.30. $1.06 pre split.
seems like 1 cent off eps is the only bad issue on the report. everything else seems normal and in line with all what we already knew.
I wonder if Alibaba will take this over.
"Don't sweat these intraday swings. GRPN was up over 15% yesterday and the overall market is down today....some profit taking was to be expected. I'm actually surprised it isn't down more today. The next leg up hopefully gets is solidly above the 200 DMA, then the price will trend higher and higher for some massive gains!"
Now that the volume has died down the shorts can control the price again. Not sure if I would want to be short a stock that is in talks to be bought out. Any buyout would likely be a 30% + premium. And GRPN would have to drop to $3.30 in order to make 30% before this was announced it was around $4.30. I just don’t see the risk reward of shorting it here.
Great opportunity
Depressed
Groupon is up 8.84% to 41.48
Very weak.. bug up days and no 10% pop.. this one is sure to drop.. hold on to your shorts!!
"As much as I would like this to keep climbing, who here thinks this will fall back down to below $4 in a month?.... seems to always be the natural flow for this stock"
Whether long or short..... good luck and all the best tomorrow. Cheers.
"This is going to get bought out it is a ""technology company"". it will start going up like tsla waifair amazn"
"I do believe they will eventually be sold. 32 million users the impetus, plus I believe Groupon focused on profitability to show wall street it is morphing into a profitable, viable company."
I wonder how much they will benefit from there Ad in the Super Bowl.
This is from grub doing so well
No buyers? I guess they can't sell the biggest Groupon of them all!!! CEO will be leaving soon..
Stock is trading like a champ today. Strong volume with the bid getting hit hard. Nice to see. Congrats longs.
"Would have sold if I knew rs. They announced it this morning, I missed it"
I remember so many shorts were bashing all the longs when the stock was $36. The tide has changed. Longs are in excellent position now to squeeze the shorts.

over 9million volume at close 3dollars tomorrow
Just got in at 3.77 I am excited to see groupon blow earnings out of the water again.
"FER, volume ended up to be right at the recent averages with 8.5M shares traded. After hours had another 450K with the majority of those share settling shortly after the trading day. The 50 day moving average was tested again. Earnings will be the key."
"$GRPN MIG Capital, LLC has filed Form SC 13D/A with SEC. Reporting 5.7% Ownership.More Investors are Buying!!!!"
"What are earning going to look like for Groupon next qtr,? US consumer might be looking for deals sitting at home. Do you think they could do $500M in total revenue or more like $400M. A shift to doubling down on Goods is key and they should keep goods until end of next year. Since they have no model like grubhub , postmates and uber eats who are killing it with restaurant inventory."
Who was the company interested in Groupon? Must be short of real value of cash flow..
This stock is never going to r/s it either goes back to 4 or down to a nickle.
Groupon is known and used in Asian countries as well

"Today's action was a bit unusual. Down to start, then a solid recovery and finally a large selloff at the end of the day. Two huge blocks of over 1M shares each traded in the final hour. Volume overall was big. The market was up huge with most stocks recovering prior days losses...except for GRPN.Anyone out there have any ideas on the trading patterns. Thi unfortunately is out of my realm of understanding."
Any real reason GRPN is getting hammered today?
Time to get new management in or sell the company. Real shame such a great brand is being run into the ground.
So the earnings are Friday August 3rd? Zacks has it wrong. Not surprising.
"1) GRPN had rose 400% in the last 12 months, so a 20% retracement is PHYSILOGICAL2) during last recession, 2011-2015, GRPN revenues rose 400%...the stock was trading, reverse split adjusted, at $4003) this latest stock offering was then only 'negative' (it's not negative at all, but short term created selling pressure) event of 2021: excellent buying opportunity.From here the stock will follow a similar trend to 2020's. Expect a 100%-200% increase. GP's 2022 Price Target: 160 pesos americanos.Stay greedy with your shares!"
"Dan, as of July 31st, there are over 15% of the short ratio on GRPN. When are we going to see a short squeeze? Thanks."
"I’ve seen this type of trading from other volatile stocks like NIO, FIT, SCOR. If this stock does not do a reverse split, any type of positive news or improved earnings will move it back to $3 territory and $5 if it’s buyout news."
"From 5/15 to 6/15 it had 9 Million additional shares shorted. It went from $4.86 on 5/15 to $4.68 on 6/15. That isn’t much of a drop for 9 million shares shorted. This new drop since 6/15 is much more severe, I wonder how many shares are being shorted this month? It’s quite a gamble for someone(hedge fund etc.) to be short millions of shares when they announce earnings."
Heading to $4.
Good to see GRPN hold onto the recent gains (so far).
Why the drop after hours ?
"Now she runs!!! Solidly over the 200 DMA.....$50 and $60 by the end of the year seems like a lock, unless they under deliver in their next ER...if that happens, she goes back under $25. They seem to have adapted to the COVID-19 environment well, so the former seems more likely. GLTA"
When are earnings?
up almost 4% on lower volume not a good sign for the sell side
Groupon is up 16.29% to 25.95
$2 soon. Timber.....this company has np clue on how to make an actual profit.
Donna you’re post history proved you’re not firing on all cylinders
Blue Apron now under $1 will Groupon face the same fate?
38% short float looking for 100% moves up just saying.
"The after hours price is a gift. I bought 1000 shares @3.67 they blew away earnings and revenue, what more could Wall Street want?"
LoL! I read a story about groupon and grubhub and had to see for myself that Groupon still exists and was listed.... I honestly didn't know there were still some people grouponing. The fad came and went faster than hammerpants lol.
"Guillermo kept an eye on latest GRPN products. Groupon goods are everywhere. From Costco memberships to ED medications selling in the hundreds of thousands. Next quarter will be record and so the following one.People are dying to do online shopping and Groupon like Amazon will double its goods footprint. As far as small businesses are concerned, like A. said, as the economy reopens, Groupon will be a must for thousands of new or restored businesses. Like in 2009-2012 when Groupon went public and was worth NORTH of $5B or 10 times todays' valuation. In other words a stock price between $100 and $200.For that reason the reverse split may be genius because a stock price in the hundreds will INFLAME new investors that will chase Groupon to $200, maybe $300 a share next year. Call me crazy? Let's talk in 2021 and you will owe me HUGE."
I see Brad but I can't locate FER. Anyone?
Groupon is trading at a discount.
What's going on here in pre market ? Dipping
How does this company still have a billion in revenue and $750M in cash! is this how a bankruptcy looks like? Looks more like a buyout to me.
Brad needs 2 puffs today...
"Update on the 13F filings, Citadel Advisors sold their entire position of over 13M shares and FMR (Fidelity) reduced their holdings by over 11M shares. Over 24M shares from 2 powerhouse institutions.FMR still holds over 60M shares."
How ya’ll doing over here in Groupon land? Still dreaming for a buyout?!
Golden cross next week. stock is coming alive now. 5s are coming.
Sell to save
"Hello, I am trying to open a position into GRPN, is this a good time and what price should I try to get in at? Any help is appreciated, but Iean help, not people saying this is going to 500$ without a clue as to why  thanks in advance"
"ER BAD miss and potential Reverse split (which usually means a definite reverse split). In my experience I have never seen a reverse split help a company's stock go up. This will likely be below $2 in a month, and quite possibly before market close tomorrow. My advice to longs would be cut and run, it's all bad news."
On its way to red
"This is a classic example of why you never ""panic sell"" as a Pure Earnings player. You must give the market time to properly digest the earnings release, and at the very LEAST, wait until at least one hour after the market opens, after the earnings release, before you decide to get out with a loss."

I hope this spike holds. Or is it just for the insiders to make money. SEC!!! Hmmmm!!

A sinking ship.....

"This qtr results will be far beyond expectations, huge buying opportunity right now !!!!"
"JOHN we are so lucky to have you bringing the news to this board. Where do you find this stuff, you must have big connections??"
GRPN reached an all time low at 1.15
in your dream
"The fact that about 80% of the posts here are from short sellers, makes this a strong buy."
The value of the company looks fairly to undervalued based on the fundamentals. I believe this is an excellent entry point for an investor with a little risk tolerance. I really believe a move is on the horizon soon.
shorted 2000 at 57.9
$GRPN If you guys Remember $ETSY was around $4 .Today they are over $60 Groupon has a deep bench and a lot of revenue channels.Better positioned and has more cash then ETSY. This is a GIFT to buy at this price. Including the Covid -19 will even shift more revenue to Groupon. Insiders and Institutions are also Buying. Strong Buy!
I bought this before earnings at 4....been waiting since then. It's getting better day by day...
I think I think today’s sell-off is a result of the recent add they issued - up to 10 dollars off next meal when you register your credit card with Groupon +. Some would say this will cut into their bottom line. I think it’s a great way to swell its user base and a big plus moving forward.
Guillermo Puertas and his wife Belinda wish everyone a happy 40% rally.The Guillermo Puertas foundation approves this message. The Guillermo Puertas foundation has made a $10B pesos into Groupon and rates Groupon Strong Buy.Stay greedy my friends.

"I noticed that a couple of individuals here keep posting political campaign #$%$ and they get a lot of reactions. Please, people, ignore those posts and report as ""Does not belong here,"" mute them, and let's keep the discussion centered around the company."
This might be the key to the future...http://www.atairos.com/about-us/
Yeah sorry to say but
I was contemplating reestablishing a position in GRPN however as I listen to the call it seems to be a repeat of the prior 3 calls. I like the bottom line improvements but the top line revenue declines are quite concerning. There is only so much expense management a company can do.
The whole re-opening trade in one stock.
"I disagree the new groupon + needs maybe another qtr or two to work minimum.More need to be added still,"

"If you don't like the stock sell it already, there is a lot of speculation happen. Forget the shorts they have nothing to do with the rally. If there is a deal great, if not you can buy it cheaper. Only odd thing I find is they have yet to confirm there earnings release date. One they do publicly the watch all the selling that happens."
Low volume selling of a very under valued stock.I didn't buy more but will HOLD into 2018.
cmon 4.30s!!!!!! I want back in
The Cramer effect. Should be at $6 without his flash comment.

A 3 party bidding war and $20/share(longshot, yes 3 parties want but to bid war is rare).GL"
Sold half of my GRPN and bought ETSY.
The selling (volume is low thankfully) has been persistent all day with few buyers. It's almost like there is a tug of war happening with the momentum of this stock. Lots of buying on heavy volume early last week then drift sideways on average volume and lastly a volatile Friday with huge selling then feverish buying at the close. Now today we have a day where the stock drops steadily on light volume.Very strange. At some point in the not to distant future I believe GRPN will make a 20% move one way or another.
I say no to the poison pill idea -- let somebody creep in and shake things up
What a great buy this a gift guys don’t refuse to accept it. It’s come ones a life.
How can anyone retail investors invest in this company. They have made so many promises and haven’t accomplished anything thing in over 5 years. The change of CEO haven’t done the co any good. Because of the service they provide a was an addict to Groupon once. Their good became horrible and customer service wow .
John how does it feel owning all those dead shares?
"If GME can move the way it did, so can GRPN. Stay long and be strong. You’ve got to risk it to win it. $60 by 10AM EST."

And we are negative!! Very predictable..on the money
01/19/17Piper Jaffray Cos. Set Price Target Groupon (GRPN) Buy $7.00
Get ready for a crazy day. Hopefully this will be turnaround Tuesday. Down hard early with a sustained recovery throughout the day. If the rally loses steam look for a 600+ drop again in the Dow.
I'm feeling better than expected earnings in February will knock the ball out of the park and shoot us over 6.Alibaba will buy more shares and institutional buying will increase.
"I bought CHK, it's going be a great investment"

Bought OSTK now buying GRPN
"Groupon’s leaving tons of money on the table thanks to archaic systems and incompetent tech support.I’ll try to make a short story long. I wanted to take advantage of Cyber Monday sales. My first order blazed right thru. Then my subsequent orders were rejected on multiple attempts using several different credit cards and even PayPal for 2 days before I gave up in frustration. I even tried on a different PC. I had a friend try to order on her account with exactly the same results – first order OK, subsequent ones rejected.The end result after multiple messages to/from tech support was getting told my order (singular) went thru. The yo-yo in tech support looked only at Available orders not ALL! Does Groupon really pay these people?If I were shareholder I would not be happy. I’d have the CFO on a carpet. I raise the issue here because the board and management team are unreachable. I copied Groupon's media director but still haven’t gotten a reply. Apparently it’s not his job. Hopefully a major shareholder will read this. I’ll gladly furnish supporting correspondence. I doubt very much ours is an isolated case. I wonder if the stock’s tanking has anything to do with customer dissatisfaction.I loved the deals on Groupon but I hate being jerked around. As they say, more fish in the sea – Amazon, eBay, Costco, Walmart just to name a few. That goes not just for myself but my family and several friends. You can kiss our business good bye."
Groupon reportedly seeks a buyer as stock languishes.....Keep your fingers crossed that we don't get screwed.
Alot of chart readers out there today. Soon you will wish for your 4.89 stock back. #200DMVA. Glta
To contact CEO and board just send to IR @ groupon.comIR is investor relationship. then in the subject specify to forward to CEO or Board. They will get it.Rich Williams needs to resign immediately. Worst CEO I have never seen. As bad as IBM CEO who just quit as well.
guys an educated consumer is going to check the price against amazon and most times groupon super deal is same price amazon has it for every day plus most have prime so free 2 day shipping comparied to groupon chargimg and who knows when it will show up groupon is done sorry to tell you no insider buying even at these levels tells you it is doneface the facts
"Trading pattern for GRPN same as GRUB for the past month, and they had 3 downgrades. That gives a positive feeling, if GRPN does well."
This is a playground stock for daily traders.
"one yr ago today this was at its low,,, did it come to high to fast????"
The short ratio is so high as the shorts kept piling on their position when it hit $40 and now they are in desperation.
Oh lala oh lala!!! Dream equity if know how to play!
Delayed earnings mean really horrible data
John doing his comedy routine on cbwtf boardPrecious!
This stock should be .97 cents and will head there by next quarter.
Oh Yeah!!
Groupon has had 25 times of failed rallies in the past. Shady business!
If the Earnings do not meet/above 0.09 cents and revs 852M then I will sell. Revs may look weak this qrtr compared to last year but that is because of the intl pullback so anything in this range should work. The key will be the forward guidance as always.....
Where are all my chart reader 200 day 4.89 ? Hmmm. Read my previous post this stock is cheap wheather or not a buyer emerges in the next few months or no there is little downside because this company will eventually get sold or merger don't sell any.
Dont get caught with your shorts down
What are Soy Boys Brad and .01's predictions today...Oh yeah $2!!!

Groupon is going to be bought out
this should be a interesting day
Perhaps GRUB buys and or merges with GRPN after the deal they put together with order up in July of last year and GRUBs new found stock wealth.
Zeljanica you said easy going to 60I would call that a terrible callBut the comedy you bring to the board is precious
This company has no Spicket where they can just turn on the revenue to make investors happy. Last ditch effort is group+. Which is not working well at all.. CEO will be leaving soon. Stock will move up afterwards..

sell short as this is way overdone. The company is losing money and has no advantage over other similar businesses.
I think the stock is actually very resilient. Good price action today. Don't get fooled it never should have been 5.50.
I don't believe a company will have numbers to report than GRPN.

"Groupon: Don't Expect A Swift RecoveryBy being a marketplace for local experiences, Groupon thinks that it will be able to reinvent itself and return to profitability after years of sales decline.We don’t see how the company will benefit from fully pivoting to the local experience market in the midst of a pandemic.It’s unlikely that Groupon will receive any financial benefit from the current restructuring this year.We believe that the company is uninvestable at this stage.After failing to become a major shopping service, Groupon (GRPN) decided to close its goods division and pivot to the local experiences market, where the company believes it has more opportunities to create value. By being a marketplace for local experiences, Groupon thinks that it will be able to reinvent itself and return to profitability after years of sales decline. The problem with this plan is that the local experiences market relies on people connecting with each other, and it’s unlikely that Groupon will be able to get people to share experiences in the midst of a pandemic. Since the majority of its users are from North America, which is the epicenter of COVID-19 in the world right now, we don’t see how the company will benefit from fully pivoting to the local experience market.With a fully drawn credit facility and a history of failing on numerous projects, we believe that investing in Groupon is a risky endeavor with a high chance of getting a negative outcome.

at what level is the next resistance?

"Any suggestions hold , sell or buy ?"
GRPN is up 14.32% to 0.64
"Its time for GRPN Management to seriously consider strategic move to be acquired! GRPN has great brand value but they need resources to grow brand. they need BABA, Comcast or another large entity to help them grow. Otherwise their doomed to failure. This new management team should now recognize this."
What are the real facts of this company? CEO brags about increased business on CNBC. Not reflected in stock price. Is this company for real??
Ji/JohnLOL!!!!!!?
How does the analyst know ahead of earnings ?? Isn’t this insider info passed on to the analyst ?? Strong yes. It’s easy for the analyst themselves to pump the stock based on insider information. Wake up. Sec investigation required.
Between Brad Barry and AR it would seem GRPN has produced the lowest IQ forum on Yahoo Finance
Time to buy
John told you “Owning this stock is good business sense “LOL!!!!!!!!
Another buying opportunity
Someone must have leaked the morning report. GRPN beat earnings in the a big way. I mean really big way. 17 cents a share is the numbercongrats longs. SHORTS are going to get crushed.
This is a great fit and yelp is bargain down here. It’s a cash flow machine The stock is cheap at 9x EV/EBITDA estimates while the EBITDA/share grew by 50%.
Unfortunately...a miss and drop will make us feel “normal.” HOWEVER!! I’m pulling for one of those classic GRPN beats that ushers in a +20% POP AH. Come on GRPN!! Your faithful deserve some good news and a good night’s sleep for a change.
"Sooner or later as the restaurant business gets even more competitive, even the places that don't need them now, will have to earn your business and what better way then to offer a groupon plus. A nice 15, 20 or 25% credit right on your card."

"Price is half what it was in January. This has a long way to run. Great development on the Rezdy Experiences inventory deal. As coronavirus gets under control and the economy opens up, there will be a huge demand for this. Good luck longs!"
"Congrats GRPN holders. 3 green days in a row. You have to go back to Spring to see more green.Okay, IBM resolved via balance sheet or EPS. Takeover talk pretty much dissolved. Will earnings be above concensus? Cramer recommended Grapeon. If that isn't the kiss of death...what is?"
GRPN is down 6.39% to $3.30

Going down.. sell at any price..
It's a big day..
it might hurt at the end of day
Hari/John did not turn up for English classes yesterday....oh well I tried
The stock is on hult.?
Heavy speculation. There may be an announcement after hours or pre-market tomorrow.
3.50 next Friday
"GRPN needs a shove of sorts to change directions. The stock moved higher with the market, unfortunately not to the same degree. The sell side has been dominating for about 30 days now. The company has not released any significant news or offered a peak into Q4 performance.2018 guidance will be the most critical piece of data when earnings is released in February. I do not believe a date has been confirmed as of yet for this quarters release.Based on how the stack has been trading, more sell interest than buyers coming in, I suspect there will not be any news or other events leading into the conference call date."
Fer what was that about 52 cents ??
Baba next week?? If they do not announce buyout.. this will hit 3.90
$GRPN read about $ETSY . This is why Groupon strong buy. Etsy: Great E-Commerce Platform For The Stay-At-Home Economy https://seekingalpha.com/article/4337960
Yesterday down 22% and today it look like it going to DOWN again (struggling ) it can’t be down today if down again I will sell OFF. DONE NO MORE
"GRPN: UNDERVALUED!""The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the cash flows, which in this case is US$2.46b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding, or the equivalent number if this is a depositary receipt or ADR. This results in an intrinsic value of $4.33. Compared to the current share price of $3.92, the stock is about right, perhaps slightly undervalued at a 9.5% discount to what it is available for right now."""
The recent move eliminated the possibility of completing the head and shoulders… This will be bullish for technical traders. Looks to be a strong buy here Given relative performance in the last week
Those who bash the users of charts and other analytics might want to start thinking twice as they move forward with GRPN as an investment. This stock continues to drip downward. Short interest continues to be high based on the number of available shares. The talk of a buyout is quitting down with each passing day. What is the compelling reason to own shares of GRPN?
Groupon is overdue for a 40-70% pop between now and august. Good luck to all.
My physical therapy doctor owns a violation machine for all of his customers after the Cryotherapy from Groupon. I bought one also from Groupon for myself and gifted my son one as well. You find all the good products from Groupon that Amazon doesn't offer.
With proper marketing and focused ad targeting GROUPON can make every quarter a great quarter. People go out 24/7...not just Christmas.They need better sales through awareness and not funky millenial ads.
"I love the selling, people have no idea why they are selling other than the chart, with price targets that have absolutely no justification or valuation metrics associated with them. GLTA,"
Alibaba wants more buy can't say it as it would drive the stock up. They already own 6% of GRPN and vowed to Trump to create thousands more jobs. Alibaba wants in imo.
"The Groupon and Ingresso integration is expected to launch in the fourth quarter. Other marketplace partnerships announced by Groupon include: GolfNow - tee times, Tickets.com - tickets, Grubhub- food delivery, Viator - tours and activities, ParkWhiz - parking and CourseHorse - local classes."
Does anyone use GropeOn? Most friends complain about the available deals not being as good anymore.Seems like yesterday's stock...IMHO.
3.30 coming soon

"FER said it best. GRPN is a seasonal company with the most recent quarter as their best for sales and profits. What is the catalyst to propel the stock upward. Guidance was light and the launch of Groupon+ will have a near term affect on margins and revenue as they transition voucher oriented sales to this platform. The GrubHub partnership is still in the integration phase. Not sure why it has taken so long to move it forward. The more I think about it, the more I feel Williams and Lefkofsky have reached the end of their abilities to move the company forward. Lefkofsky adds no value. Williams is an operator. If I get s"

Buy when others fear....

Earnings are not usually postponed specially at the last moment until something material to the company is changed which could effect the share price. I believe some news at the last moment may have forced to change to tomorrow.
groupon need a rating platform for there deal and a mandatory review per deal. when you see this you will see $8 plus
Couldn’t find a page for investors on GRPN website .
market dips..grpn can go to 15..
Who is actually buying this into the weekend?
Gotta love groupond scaring the impatient
I’ve seen this run up before earnings only to have it collapse. This time it feels different.

Ye Hari what a bullish trend ey
John what boat did I miss?? The Groupon boat?LOL!!!!!!!!!!
Groupon's chart looks extremely bullish. It is set up another new high when the senate passes the aid for small business.
Thise numbers were ATROCIOUS. Revenue DOWN 44%. Sinking ship. Good comedy. Slowly sinking ship. Losing money over all.
When she crosses the 200 DMA at 33.30 watch out!
"From what I can see groupon has a lot of value for the price. They have change their business model, I'm pretty happy about that and Im buying more."
If it gets below 20.58 watch out!
"Analysts have been revising their revenue forecasts down for the rest of the year, but raising their earnings projections. I'll take that."

Where's Runner?
Strong Buy https://cweb.com/2018/03/12/good-things-are-in-store-for-groupons-stock-cweb-com/
"I am in awe of the civility taking place on this board. Constructive discussions based on everyone's research and belief's. I had to double check to see if I was reading correctly. Great to see. Latest short interest comes out this week. It will be interesting to see if there is any material change since the Recode announcement. Also the institutional filings are coming in. They to can be enlightening,"
"So here we are less than one week away from GRPN's Q4 and FY earnings report. Twitter, FB, Snap and a host of other have weighed in and all have beat estimates. Does GRPN's CEO have the same panache as Zuckerberg, Dorsey, Spiegel etal? Not even close. Williams is confident yet reclusive, focused yet obscure and most of all he is bland. As a marketer the messages his company delivers are benign and confusing. His approach to new products and partnerships has been reluctance and overly cautious. The BOD is made up of some highly influential executives that can open doors and promote a new for GRPN. I believe this is lacking. As a former executive with Amazon, Williams has yet to bring the same disruptive approach to GRPN. I expected more as he learned the business during his stint as COO and as a CEO he continues to act as an operator versus a visionary. His strategy is sound but limited. It offers a slow plodding growth opportunity that can and will be disrupted if new products and partnerships are not introduced. I am not attacking Williams per se, just disappointed based on the expectations I had with the company's direction. I believe the company missed a huge opportunity by not touting a broader relationship with BABA. What has Angelakis and the Comcast venture capital relationship done for the growth of GRPN? This is the most disturbing thing with Williams management style. His inability to make noise in the marketplace with the tools he has at his disposal.I will be in through earnings. My expectations are low. In fact it wouldn't surprise me if they miss and restate their strategy is on course. Williams time has come and if he cannot deliver then it is time for him to move on."
Dead cat
"Nothing much has changed, its still a company that had to resort to a reverse split.Losses continue.Short at will."
no question grouponionion is going up after earnings
"This stock is like a tire with a pin hole leak - keeps going around but each time it does a revolution it becomes a little flatter.You would think that with the economy at full power, no hurricanes and a big tax break to boot.... that management would have at least give a positive upgrade to future guidance........ they actually went lower - go figure."
"Here we go, payday is in sight...."
"It's obvious by now that nothing is going to move Grpn until *earnings,remember 1st quarter is their weakest, if they can surprise and have a real good quarter then i believe the dog days will be over. *buyout rumor, or Comcast collaboration would obviously move it up,I live in S. Florida they are doing a nice job picking up local deals in rest. and things to do. Still a long way to go, but i believe the right track."
this company should have great report on earnings. They really need to step up fast.
I guess GRPN doesn't go up when the market goes down this time
J quiet now ey
GRPN will big drop any moment....... big boy taking profit now. check in real time. 2.9 tomorrow
A close above $1.28 today is all we need to launch 
People who bought in today be prepared to hold this bag.
Brad is disappearing after .01 pops up confirm This!
"Guillermo says:this is another Overstock story. Give it few months and you will be sorry you didn't buy every share you could have. Triple digits is coming very soon. Groupon was almost dead but it has been resurrected. Current CEO and his team are making it happen. Not bad, not bad."
Zeljanica telling you going to 60 within 2 weeksHow cute is that
looks like maybe I was wrong!
I predicted GRPN last summer of a target price at $65 and I am still standing firm with my prediction.
support at 4.51… Don’t let the market manipulators/big boys take your shares Longs
If any of you still remember that Google made an offer to buy Groupon and was turned down.
Groupon inventory has improved Good sign for uptrend
"Buy, Buy,Buy"
do you know? is the CEO of Grouporn still buying shares?
Great new story on SA.Seeking Alpha .
Where’s Dan and Guilermo when you need them ey?LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have not listened to the call yet - But....Stock is fairly priced. At this time will likely stick with the stock. Did anyone hear if they discussed what the FY18 tax cut will do for the bottom line? This alone should be a Big plus going forward......
Where’s Guillermo when you need a laugh ey??
I bought Groupon and overstock last year I’m at massive loses is it worth my while to just hold on for a few years and just hope or just sell what I have left and move on
Only thing going down is Brad and .01
"This is a big beat, but I have never seen a beat like STMP laid on the table a couple of hours ago. Wow, explosion coming tomorrow over at STMP"
"For me, I am surprised that the large Institutional Holders are letting this/their investment holding deteriorate as much as it has/is."
They made .10 cents .13 was expected
"Even though GRPN is slightly lower it is holding strong with huge selling taking place. Frankly I am surprised at how strong the stock is performing. With any kind of broader market reversal, GRPN will finish in the green."
Still Time to sell this company..
2106 it was 14 now 140. 300mm to 3bln. It just takes time oh and look at the PE ratio. GRPN has tremendous value don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
is Q1 going to be $500M in revenue?
$5.50 hit!
All the selling is from the chart readers. No people who buy value
Yelp and pupon......two companies that destroy small businesses.
"Joey Levin ceo of IAC just joined Groupon's Board, IAC just bought Angies List and IAC's stock soared along with Angie's List. Wonder if they are also looking at Groupon, why else would Levin join the board....."
That's why this is not a high flying stock... big sellers only apply.. starts with management..
AR must work for GrouponLol
as I said down to 2.5 then earnings and 4
"They should post a profit next quarter, if buybacks are in full force.. 15% less share count will help.. they have the opportunity to go real big and double down if the price is right., looks real low for a company not going bankrupt..."
Load up the Truck
"Don't think any of the offers will take you back to 2015 or 2011 share price.. offers are at $5.80 a share.. no sale will happen, someone trying to get out. Classic pump and dump.."
Does anyone know anything that might explain today's rally and extremely high volumes both during the market hour and after market hour?
Where's that guy that said it was going to 7? 
Held over 5
Will IAC tip some cards on conference today? They had an excellent quarter...perhaps an announcement that their kicking the tires at GRPN?
It beat expectation why down 15%?Can some one explain?
good day to buy
Good luck to GRPN longs over the next 24 hours. Quite a bit of information to digest during this time.
"Sullivan's departure actually took place on 1-17 so the trading that occurred when the news hit is your typical buy the rumor sell the news event. As far as Sullivan's leaving goes this was not a mutual decision. The key words ""effective immediately"" in the press release tell you all you need to know. I am never a fan of someone in the C suite leaving however the COO is new and took time to evaluate his team and felt Sullivan was not the guy he wanted. I am impressed they took action and are moving forward. Krenzer"
Buy buy buy...Gonna be a good 2nd qtr
"Groupon now goes by the name, Coupon."
"Buy Cover order in place at $23.00. Not expecting it to hit, but swinging for the fences as usual. Plan is to stay Short and try to ride her down all day long. :-)"
"Do you notice the timing of three GMTFO ( Get me the F Out ) orders are approx. 1 hr apart, tells me that we have someone selling risk off their book for a client order. Keep Selling its only going up when your done"
looks like Groupon survived the bloodbath today
"I’m genuinely curious on why people think this is a $100 stock. Declining year to year revenue, negative eps, declining stock price, the list goes on and on. I do recognize a recent partnership with another company, but it doesn’t seem too special. I’m not here to call anyone out I’m curious on why people are so bullish on this stock. I don’t own any of GRPN btw"
I am still long and holding and buying more on drops.
"How can we block those automated annoying comments,?"
@GRPN Look out below tomorrow!
Dan and GuilermoWe miss you’re comedy
from 20-something in 2012 to a buck 70
"So here is where we sit as of 2/10/201 at 11:32 EST. Short interest update came in last evening and Groupon now over 52M shares short...a whopping 18% increase. GRPN is now the 11th most shorted stock on the NASDAQ...not a great development. The last time GRPN's short interest was this high was last year in February. In addition, recent 13F have come in and there have been some notable changes;East Bay Management sold out their position of 4.97M sharesState of NJ sold out their position of 4.5M sharesSG Capital sold 1.88M of the 3.1M shares they ownThere have been a couple of buys of over 1M shares;Old Mutual bought 1.4M and now owns 1.5M sharesWells Fargo bought 1M and now owns 1.5M sharesThe net is the money flow is all to the sell/down side. Short interest along with the institutional ownership changes are less than encouraging. As I said I am holding thru earnings. Probably not smart considering these indicators and recent stock performance. I welcome everyone's thoughts now that we are in the home stretch of GRPN's most important earnings release."
Things are shaping nicely for the ER....
This stock is going to sour 200%. Twice the expected revenue.
FER good call on 5.09 low.GLTA LONGS.
To The Moon!!!!!!
Through the roof go GRPN! At $1 I break even and sell out
"No shares available to short at Fidelity or Schwab since Wednesday. Could be bullish, but still net selling..."
Groupon lost 80% of active users this Q. earning will be terrible. dive to .50 after earning for sure.
"Today's action is interesting. Volume high, no news and other companies in this are mixed in trading today. Insiders have held with no selling other than Lefkofsky about a month ago. I am sure we will see soon enough on what is causing the drod today."
Broke Brad/.007's crystal ball says bankruptcy!
Look at the hype of a buyout.. I have seen this story before.. keep looking for a buyout for four more years... a sale now would be a giveaway...
NOTICE FROM GROUPON CONFIRMS BUYOUTKey Dates Worth Noting:In Q3 2018 the Groupon Stores portal will be deactivated. No sales will take place through that platform from this point.Q1 2019 is the anticipated open enrollment period for new merchants on Groupon Goods Gateway.
This company does not know how or when to buy back stock!!
I am holding it from 2013. started with 9 and average down to 4. don't want to put more money in it. wait more or just book loss. I already lost more than 80% on this stock. 
"B.Riley FBR analyst Sameet Sinha initiated coverage with a Buy rating on Groupon Inc (NASDAQ: GRPN) 7/2 at 5:02 est. today and set a price target of $6.30. The company’s shares opened today at $4.31.Sinha said:“We reiterate Buy on Groupon (GRPN) as we view shareholder concern based on headline revenue declines and the implied associated deterioration as overblown. The stock trades at 7.0x 2019 AEBITDA vs. comps at 14.0x and the aforementioned concern lacks appreciation for the business model shift from agency to broker (first- to third-party) and economics tied to Groupon+. As Groupon+ grows (we estimate 4% of 2Q transactions), transaction tracking services will not capture the data accurately. We believe the addition of new partnerships increases the propensity for consumers to use Groupon as the de facto source for all local deals and inventory.”"
GRPN is up 12.71% to 0.62
Brad and .01 predictions for tomorrow $2..go figure!
"Well at least I know where it is going down too ..... hopefully, the bounce from around $5.25 will hold and return to see it pass, plus close above $5.94 next year. Sorry, Mr. Eric you need to go, this is not your personal ATM."
"One more time, 2020 belongs to TWTR/GRPN/NOK keep in mind...other big bubbles are about to crash while those will rise to the !!"
oh J. 
J still thinks it's a Winner 
Well well well... He's back.. It was so peaceful yesterday not hearing from him.
Goldman Sachs tried to bring GRPN down. It did just the opposite by going up over a DOLLAR since their strong sell advice. Aren't you longs glad you didn't sell.I added more as I posted and got thumbs down by idiots.I will take DOLLARS UP and thumbs down every day.
Revenue falls! As will Groupon
Market is pointed upward with the financials leading the charge. Let’s see how GRPN performs today. $4.11 is a key support level. If the stock drops below that number it could easily see $3.90.
Now all of the tax sellers should be done.I hope we stay strong and get new buyers and over 8 million shares in volume per day.
"Back from vaca, see I missed alot of Fer and Barry nonsense..Up we go!!"
Anyone else watching level 2 notice that each time the price drops a penny someone buys 100-200k shares within a second or two? It look unusual to me. Not really sure what to make of it though.
"Greed has severely damaged Groupon and will eventually destroy it, if it continues this path. I said long ago that Groupon should adopt the Taobao model. Let its customers to distribute their e-coupons for free! Only charge when a small fee of 15% when customers redeem the coupon. That will get most company's on board and turn Groupon into a true platform. Time is running out because without really good deals on Groupon, there will be no Groupon. There will be no really good deals if Groupon is asking for too much of a cut from their transactions."
I miss Barry...has anyone heard from him! I am quite sure he is stalking the board
J we have yet to see any informative post come from you other than your love affair posts on grpn
now we are head back below $20
the deal of the day = down again
Today rumors comes up saying that Alibaba may own Groupon. Because of this i sold all my grpn stakes
Geez. Wow. What a swing. So dumb. When we’ve missed in the past...the bottom falls out 20-30%. We BEAT this time...and we stay the same (at the end of the day). So lame. Still...riding this thing to the moon. This stock will be in the $20-$30 range in due time.
my earlier post seems to have been taken down 1 for 20 -------- really 1 for 20 what a rip off - only the insiders will benefit ----We are going to have to wait a year or two toget close to our investments
shook the tree and the weak hands fell out. My gues is that this will close above 3
Will GRPN pick up momentum into this weeks earnings release or will it trade sideways or perhaps drip downward. I suspect there will be some buying this week. Price could retest the 5 level. Friday's news and subsequent conference call will be the gating factor. I am looking forward to the analysts questions about M&A activity.
Double beat - back to 60$ we go
this stock is a day Traders dream. It'll turn red by the end of the day
"Wheres Barry, he always disappears on up days!!"

Can't keep blaming the shorts. Short interest is low. This stock is just a dog. DOG
"Groupon Staff,I would be fine with this result if your customer service rep hadn't been misleading with the information I received over the phone.Backstory: I booked a room 5 days in advance of the check in date. The cancellation policy is 4 days in advance, fine.My friend arrived from Georgia, visiting Colorado for the first time in years and the altitude immediately made him sick. We didn't go up the mountain for fear of his altitude sickness getting worse. I called the hotel at Beaver Run and they said that it was up to Groupon to administer any refund and that I needed to talk to someone at Groupon, because no one at the hotel would be able to help me. So I called your customer service line and got a Very Helpful response from Timeka. She said that she couldn't process the refund but she would escalate it to a supervisor and that I should see a refund in my account in 3 to 5 business days. I thanked her for her help and the phone conversation was a quick one, because Timeka was able to ""resolve"" my issue so quickly.In the future, please be open and honest with your customers. Their time and money is just as valuable (if not more valuable when considering the business to customer relationship and what a business is without a customer) as your time and money. So don't lie to your customers just to get a problem off of your plate.Whereas a simple helpful response with honest follow through might have earned you a customer for life, your incredible failure and lack of attention in this instance has alienated a customer instead. I will be making an EFFORT not to use your services in the future. Moreover, I will be letting all of my friends and family know that Groupon is not an honest company and that their hard earned money is best put to use with other service providers. Your service rep was misleading and dis-honest and it looks bad on your organization.I am sorry for the lengthy post, but I was very upset by this process and the manner in which the blame for my request denial was pawned off to a third party. This is a micro-cosmic view of the state of our country nowadays. All we do is push blame on someone else. Own it and bring some integrity back to this nation. You have a huge responsibility to your customers and the world beyond.Jacob Lison"

"keep buying groupons.... stock will be bought up big, like last time,, interest payment just went down.... stock is not diluted yet, if 2022 turns around totally in the clear... profits coming fast.. merchants coming back this summer... a few bucks down does good in the long run.... buy groupons on the app..."

Bad earnings report
"The spike is for several reasons, here they are: 1. A possible buyout 2. Shorts under pressure to cover, have to buy to cover and with buyers seeing the covering,the stocks rockets like this normally. 3. Shorts recognize there is a buyout coming , cover, while institutions buy in.Groupon is one of the heaviest weighted stocks owned by institutional investors. They know all too well, that groupon is a buy, like priceline sometime ago, going up to 100 thenplummeting down to under $5.00, then, all of sudden over $1000 per share....Groupon isn't priceline, but it has good assets, has a website in addition to mass mailing and hasover the past several years streamlined their business. It is inconceivable that walmart, ebay, microsoft, google or even amazon is not looking. They haveto put all of that money somewhere and why not into a great asset that they can make even better. Truth told, I do use groupon, amazon, walmart and ebay, but all are used, groupon is a valid choice inpurchasing and a household name. It's valuation does not reflect it's value.I"
At least some interest in the Groupon message board now. Lol
Should find a bottom around 1.80
soon grpn will be bought..
@.01 I even gave you free idea about Groupon specially start climb after 1:00 EST to play day trading or swing! But your brain won't catch that!
"Good move up and more important on HIGH Volume,,,good news coming ...adding to my position"
"Groupon is a great Reddit buy candidate, plenty of cash, already done a R/S to shrink outstanding shares, good outlook and sizeable short interest. Very explosive situation here, let's all put this one out there on the Reddit board."
This is going to Roll-Over (go down) further.....just look at the volume.
"IAC Interactive a potential suitor,too. Baba owns 6% from higher levels. The market for daily deals is over. Funny when you Google ""Groupon bankruptcy "" the results will surprise you...Bankrupt at IPO...BK In 2011,2013, 2015, 2016,2017.??"
So now GRPN is worth the same as what it was before they blew away earnings. Looks like a buy to me.
Heading to $4.00. It will reach there by end of next week.
can you handle it? i expect a close of 27. my opinion
$16 tomorrow!

"DO NOT FIGHT THE TREND. To be successful you have to be like a surfer in the ocean. Ride the waves as they come. Do you know any surfer (even the best of the best) able to ride a surf in reverse? NOPE . Maybe they would be able to do little TEMPORARY zig-zags inwards/outwards but eventually you have to go with the current and INWARDS or you will be smashed like bug on the rocks. LOL So in Groupon's case the surf is going higher.PERIOD. Why? Because it has been going the other way for too long, NEW management has come and showed things are getting WAY BETTER then they were. Once it gets to $60 if management shows it messed up, then the surf may change. But only then. RIGHT NOW it is just FOOLISH. You're fighting the current, your are fighting the a foot tall surf trying to go out in the ocean. GOOD LUCK or as Guillermo Puertas would say: BUENA SUERTE!"
"Another big partnership with Parkwhizhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/heading-redeem-groupon-partnership-lets-162900404.htmlHave you ever driven somewhere to redeem that Groupon for an exciting family adventure, relaxing salon and spa package or mouth-watering restaurant deal and needed a place to park? Thanks to a strategic partnership with ParkWhiz, Groupon now offers convenient parking that you can find and pay for using the Groupon app."

Yawn - Low volume and no news.
Remember charts NEVER WORK
Unfortunately for the rest of board Brad/.007's shrinks office is closed..No sessions available to them!!
Sold @1.01..Will in again!!
"I bought 4 3.5 puts Exp 2/21 that costed me about $220. Assuming that GRPN opens at 2.3 at the open and I sell it at that price, what kind of return should I expect? thank you all for your feedback!"
US STOCK MARKET and other multiple names spammy same posts .Report and on other boards too.
No more buyers only sellers .. FB needs to buy this company so it can survive and grow with WhatsApp.. that is the play here.. look at pdd
Who would short Groupon now !!! The only way to go is upppp
John and J told you it’s not going to 2’s
CEO seems so visionary as he proposed RS before mandatory forced down!
GRPN will see 5$ in the near future ...
look like 5 dollar soon
Brad this thing is about to hit $30. What’s going on?!?!?!
put your money where your mouth is... buy groupons and a lot of them.. make the earnings go up and buy some shares too.... it does not work if you do not buy the products........
I think Snapchat should buy Groupon.
"The next Priceline. It's gonna go to $2,000 after hours."
"What trite phrase applies to this situation?""No worries, this will buff out"" or,""A reverse stock split will increase the share price. What is wrong with it?"" or,""Nothing has changed with this company. I am buying tomorrow with both hands!""Take your pick."
"Way to go Rich & team. You surely know how to drive shareholder value! If the stock continues to move in the current direction your practice of granting options, RSU's and other unearned compensation will be a mute point.Get off your behinds and DO something!!!"
Zeljanica don’t be scared come out and play

We should all buy a nice massage on groupon to celebrate!!
Smaller cap today...
Anyone optimistic?
Priceline Could Be the Top Contender to Buy Groupon
"Not that it matters, but cards on the table, I added about 13,000 shares today. Just meaning to give context for my participation in the discussion today."
Latest short information will be released after the market closes today.
"Groupon UNETHICAL business practices. Really? Stalking me? Trying to push me to buy something that I didn't want after investigating it further? I was SHOCKED to find that Groupon was stalking me, tracking me without my permission. I'll never buy anything from Groupon ever again."
A few more days like today and you'll have nothing left......... MTNB
Groupon customer accounts were hacked.Tell the world you are fixing this.
going under $2
"Quick Question: Is There A Stock Buy-Back Plan....if So, can you provide the details? (since when, for how much $, what has been completed, has it been renewed, etc.etc.)"

J in corner hitting the bottle He thought it was going up big today
no one is buying. everyone is sitting on their hands
Read my post from 5 hrs ago enough said.
"impressive closing rally, must be some big news beginning to leak, like a monday morning buyout"
"Amazing the pumpers are as bad as the bashers. There is nothing going on but a whole lot of waiting. Deal or no deal, otherwise dead money until 2019 atleast. If you own it get comfortable."
"Many amateur traders saw reverse split and thought this was an easy money maker shorting it to zero.Guillermo is sorry but he has some very bad news for you amateur traders.This is a rare case where a reverse split is successful, PERIOD.Bad signs for amateur bear traders:#1 right after the reverse split implementation the stock rebounded 50% --- rare event post RS event#2 Groupon insiders bought tons of shares (including Lefkofsky, a cofounder BILLIONAIRE, who owns on millions of shares) --- rare post RS event#3 Alibaba still owns 6% of the company#4 Vanguard still owns about 8% of the company#5 The three years following the big recession made Groupon grow tenfold. Post covid most likely Groupon will grow even more.#6 The last quarter showed the new leadership was able to initiate a paradigm shift despite impossible local deals condition due to covid. As condition improve there are condition to double, triple, quintuple Groupon revenues in a matter of 2-3 years...GROWTH.You still want to short Groupon? Guillermo wishes you good luck, you will need it."
"I think I see a major source of the problems with GRPN. On the calls, mgmt seems to have as a key goal to keep improving gross profit per customer. My question is WHY? That doesn’t do much for the company. In fact, it can work against it in the long term. My suggestion would be that Groupon make each customer that has not placed an order in, say, the last 6-8 months AN OFFER THEY CAN’T REFUSE , even if there is 0 gross profit for Groupon for that transaction. This would reduce the GP/customer, but it would result in more active customers and higher revenues. In the long run, that would be good both for the company and shareholders."
buy out at 4 bucks ?
Groupon will beat earnings estimates and surprise longs with a reward. Or WE WILL JUMP SHIP.
volume picking up today as well as the price..
selected!! ?? Groupon is giving $50 bucks to everyone today.. instead of stock repurchases.. cash went down $100M on promotion.. 3rd quarter results don’t look so good on paper.. keep buying the stock..
I think this stock may end up green today. Volume is very strong. Short interest update will be available after the market close today.
They need to fire someone..
Once again this stock should be shorted on any big up move....this is truly garbage. I still hold a little long (400 shares at $4.20) cannot wait to get out at least break even then short this pig.
GRPN is up 5.44% to $3.49
Scott I hop so been holding for a while it always tanks for some reason I don’t think $5 it will get hopefully $3
"30,000,000 at the higher price :)"

Groupon also said its board has approved plans for a reverse stock split of between 1-for-10 and 1-for-12. The company expects the reverse stock split to be effective by the end of the second quarter.
volume down and market falling down if we go down to wuhan danger zone sub $1 soon
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT. FOR EVERY 20 SHARES YOU HAD YESTERDAY YOU HAVE 1 NOW. TO PREVENT DELISTING. GRPN STILL DROPPING EVEN AFTER A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT .
"I've been long forever and frankly have little faith this will breakout. Let's hope for a buyout, it is time for someone to take notice on this small turnaround. Let's face they have been throwing darts for a long time, this is a poorly run business and may take them on their own forever to increase pps."
green is coming
Perfect buying opportunity if you still believe in GRPN.
Dropping daily but J not worried one bit. Grpn pure gold to him
Hear M Science an alternative date provider put out something but don’t have details.
DREAM DREAM AWAY....The CEO and The Head of Sales are BOTH driving this stock into the Ground. Would not surprise me if they are shorting. BACKWARDS algorithm sending out emails to deals that are already doing good??? HOW ABOUT ALL THE DEALS THAT ARE NOT DOING GOOD?? JUST A SPLOTCH ON A WEB PAGE - GET YOUR NON-SELLERS TO SELL THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT YOU BOZO'S
Stock is done..
"If they can't hit $950m in q4, stock will be $1.50... it's better to sell now.. save money for the your holidays. Don't give it to Groupon employees' who should not have a job. Can't they see what their so-called hard work results into.. of falling stock price. Same deals, same stuff on the site.. nothing new to be excited about.. that's called lazy employees who sit at home.. hire some new amazon executives and get rid of the current management..."
"To be fair, the Russell 2000 was down 1% yet $grpn down 1.3%. 30% worse than the its average...Russell index seems in short term downtrend from record highs. Financials weighting in index."
"Sorry Shorts, but GRPN is going higher....I was one of the Shorters back in June and made alot of money riding from $25 down to $16.....I then moved onto HOME and did well until they surprise, like GRPN did.....Since their surprise, HOME has almost doubled and continues to go higher. This market rewards the turnaround, so GRPN is going to continue to trend higher, too. The biggest hope for the Shorts was a bad ER....that's gone now, so there is nothing to make it go lower now. Buy some in-the-money Call options and ride it higher the next few months."
Timber. Should be in the low 40's by the end of the week. Strong short.
Nice selling volume into the close. Good luck to all. Don't trade the news tomorrow you will surely be worng.
this is a buy and hold baby!
AR..LOL!!!!!!!!
"Groupon clearly is a pandemic loser as indicated by operating losses that grew five-fold in Q1 2020 YoY over Q1 2019. Since they derive a large chunk of revenues from small businesses, the restart narrative may initially appear to benefit the Company. However, small businesses that have been shut down during isolation mandates would think twice about further discounting products and services as loss leaders through Groupon to get the limited foot traffic in the doors as mandated by regional jurisdictions. While stay-at-home mandates get lifted, social distancing policies will continue to remain in effect for the foreseeable future which results in capacity limitations of up to 50% for stores and restaurants. Groupon’s model is flawed as numerous businesses have identified customers that only engage when Groupon coupons are available. They are conditioned only to pay a discounted price and shun paying full price, which is the opposite outcome that businesses originally anticipated to get new customers in the door to stay. It’s comical how Groupon attempts to give the façade of sophisticated restructuring which is mostly layoffs and furloughs. It’s typical smoke and mirrors attempt to improve the perception of a bulk discounting business model with tremendous competition and few barriers to entry. Reverse splits are usually a sign of desperation and a nail in the coffin for shareholders. From local mailers to Yelp (NASDAQ: YELP) , the competition is endless. Groupon investors may want to unwind their positions while shares are still trading on hubris and savvy experienced traders may consider playing the downward spiral."
Looking good!
"At this point will hold and not sell. They are taking it way too low for no apparent big news. Nothing fundamentally has changed. Tell me it is only politics. Who knows how low it may go , but will make a new high."
Let’s not forget the bottom line “GAAP EPS of $0.08 beats by $0.10” with all the overpriced stocks out there this is a winner here at 2.90
"Sadly, no shares to borrow to short. No upside potential..."
Speaking of the next few months Guillermo has some predictions for you guys. Based on historic data:1) Gold will get to $2500-$30002) Market will continue rising but there will at least TWO 20% NASDAQ drops in the next 12 months with quick RECOVERIES. Those 20% NASDAQ drops will be great chances to accumulate.3) Small caps (like GRPN) will do great. As an AVERAGE the sector will DOUBLE in the next 2 years. That means the sector's winners will grow 5x-10x. Groupon is positioned to be a winner. So a $500 stock in 2-3 years is absolutely in the cards. May be way sooner.
Oh please flattery will get you everywhere
Bradley how has your week been bro?
But out news ? May be tomorrow
You have an insurance policy going into earnings. Let's say earnings were so so. The forward guidance should be decent with new tax cuts. Forward guidance is more important in my book.
"Groupon started Groupon select membership last quarter and have 260,000 paying members at 4.99/mth thats 1.297 million a month."
Insiders have been buying which is a good sign.
We need that buyer to come in before we hit $4.

"How can Paypal pay for a money losing mobile coupon venture that has perhaps only 1/3 of Groupon's revenue at 10X value multiple to revenue and is money losing for $4 billion? While Groupon has only a market cap of $1.6 billion with mover $2 billion in revenue? Something is wrong with Groupon's management for not selling to Paypal. With all the hundreds of thousands of merchants that Groupon has around the world, it would have been fantastic if Paypal acquired Groupon. I do not think that Paypal did not consider it. Then, it must have been Groupon's management that screwed up this potential deal with Paypal."
Groupon is up 18.81% to 28.36
There is 45 minutes remaining in the trading day. GRPN has 3.8M shares traded. Let's see if the feeding frenzy continues into this week.
VETR downgraded from buy to hold with a price target of $6.09. Is the reason for the sell off today. Not so much due to insider selling.

"Groupon, the local experiences MONOPOLY.The Marketplace goldAs small businesses reopen and look for new customers will all knock on Groupon's door. That is why there is a VERY HIGH chance of doubling revenues in the next 12 months. Guillermo heard a rumor of some cryptocurrency initiative soon. If that does materialize, game over. Groupon's comeback story will be bigger than Gamestop's. Keep an eye on it...Stay greedy my friends, stay greedy."

$GRPN Wedbush boosts target to $60 from $29www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/wedbush-boosts-target-on-groupongrpnnsd-to-60-from-29/
"Another quick lesson. Topic today is EBITDA. Many HOT sectors have Enterprise/ EBITDA ratio of 20-30 . AMZN Enterprise/ EBITDA ratio for last quarters has been 100.Groupon is projected to produce $50M EBITDA in 2020 and $250M in 2021. Now just focusing on $50M now, with a 100 multiplier we are talking of a valuation of $5B for Groupon (versus current $800M). So 6 times today's value, so $180 a share. With a 50 multiplier we are still talking of $90 a share...In other words if Groupon continues executing as in the second quarter a valuation over $150 a share is what is coming for GRPN, AUTOPILOT!Now if EBITDA goes to $250M as estimated, we might finally reach a decent market cap of $10B, something that analysts had estimated following the big recession (2011-12). $10B would translate into a projected $300-$400 price per share. Obviously that will require a near perfect execution. But DOABLE. Guillermo rates Groupon STRONG BUY."
The loud crying from the shorts reminds me of someone that thought that lying was the way to stay in control. Keep rolling GRPN!
"Management is about to short change investors big time, in the near future... they will except $3.5 per share for for this company. That is why it is trading down.. only a goodbye at $2.50.. needs new CEO, to make some big deals happen. Get Oprah in here, she can make this company great again!!"
"Groupons best customers only have to spend a $1200 bucks a year to make this company work. Many are spending more, but seems like only 3M customers use groupon. I would continue to short."
I got in at $5.50 thinking they would smash earnings. This GRPN bull is moving on to greener pastures.
Groupon's success completely reminded me of the success by Best Buy that prevails over Amazon and come out as a big winner.
GRPN and YELP with all the travel discounts it does should be in talks together and get this over this
"Grpn wont stay unnoticed for long, neither will prty that never should have gone below 5, july calls on it and wtrh next dash, bj next cost, vbiv next nvax. Riot pops to 5 almost immediately, hopn to 3, mnkd to 6."

"I see a lot of accumulations on Level II. Someone is quietly snatching up shares. I got in 10,000 shares at $4.14 and I think Groupon is under great radar being bought out by the big boys at $12 dollars a share."

"This stock had a reverse split 20:1. It surely does not help investors pre-reverse split, even of it reaches $500 per share."

"Dan, just read an article from an analyst has a near term target for GRPN at $38. However, given that Groupon’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility."
"4.50 close on 6/22 after the Russell reconstitution accompanied by qtr and month end selling, and we are right back there. Hmmmmm patience, the most hated undervalued stock in the space."
Just a run up before earnings so it has run to drop like a stone after earnings.
GRPN holding up nicely on a down day with decent volume. Interesting...
power session today!
37 million shares short. That’s going to be tough to cover. I imagine they will try to push the price down then cover then push it down and cover. But even then they had better hope some institutional traders are selling some large market positions. By 3:00pm things will get very interesting. If no massive sell orders available they will have to cover in the open market.
"$GRPN Always remember that Groupon has better value and cash then $ETSY look at ETSY stock. Groupon can do the same. They also better position for booming sales due to the corona virus since Groupon offers deals and coupons. Major players also have stake in the company including $BABA , Also $FB and $AMZN can easy bid for the company. A lot of value on the table. STRONG BUY"
Groupon now also provides discount on their stockprice?
This selloff should turn into buyers and runup before May 9 CC.
Ji/John following me all over the internet How cute is that
Any news why so high today??
Market Cap is equal to the cash the company has. So effectively the share price is 0. It is only up from here. Can’t go lower imho. Got some April calls. Hoping for a big return. GLTA.
Today will be the lowest volume day for an earnings release in years. With no volatility traders are uninterested. Best day in GRPN for real money. #nospeculation

"When this Corona virus has passed, guess who has the platform to reach millions of businesses and customers? GROUPON!"
Looks like a nice pop for the stock at the open...congrats to those who are holding. Be mindful of the trading today. Already 2.5M shares changing hands in premarket trading. I suspect the majority of these are shorts covering. GRPN is set up for a good short squeeze based on the number of shares short and available shares to cover. Institutions will play a big role in the coming days. They have the ability to increase the total float significantly. That is why trading needs to be monitored. If they start selling short sellers will have more access to shares driving the value down.
"GRPN is a horrible company and the only way it can go is down. Don't deceive yourself. I bought 5000 shares of it for $38000 in 2014, and sold it last December of which I lost a little over $27000. All these few years I was hoping it would get better, but it never did and never will. The good thing was I made the same amount in the Chines company of BABA which offset my losses. Please don't listen to these so called analysts. They were terribly wrong and kept me with false hope. The business model GRPN has is not workable. I checked many times and they really never had a good deal that I could like"
how disappointing can it get.. couldn't hold on to the gains even when everything else in the world is going up..
Dan L. would you take a look at NIO for me please? Bank Of America has a target for NIO at $18. I will appreciate your input in you can take a look at it for me. Thank you.

LOLGuillermo is all in, but is prepared to possible weak earnings later today: we had no CEO for most of the quarter and historically Wall Street has been really tough with GRPN. No surprise there. If earnings disappoint Guillermo believes the price per share will rebound very quickly because the announcement of the new CEOs and of Q2 results will be huge catalysts in the next 2 weeks. Guillermo firmly believes GRPN will be above 50 bucks in July.GLTA longs. GLTA shorts while they move to a different stock licking their wounds."
"After Red Robin's disappointing news it is becoming more and more apparent just HOW important GRPN will be to the future of the restaurant business, especially with the millennial demographic! I'm waiting for the next dip, and I will load up on shares. I'm a believer and Groupon has name recognition!"
$GRPN Strong Buy. This will explode like $ETSY Be patient. https://www.cweb.com/groupon-makes-and-impressive-turnaround/
I’m short at 24 and can ride any spikeWhen should I cover teens?
How low does this go on Friday??? I say below $10. Factor in the 20 to 1 reverse splot and that's what? .10 cents a share?
"let me tell you one thing, This baby is my life saver...All the time!!!"
earnings? ??
"Revenue was $495.6 million in the third quarter 2019, down 16% (15% FX-neutral).• Gross profit was $277.9 million in the third quarter 2019, down 9% ("

"With bad management the stock will never recover, Rich Williams never made a single penny in profit for the last 10 years, Tutes should remove him immediately"
buyout incoming
"After reviewing a number of GRPN quarterly results, I concluded that, because of the transformative changes that have been implemented by the CEO, it is not meaningful at this time to base the company’s progress on the revenues alone. The company has shifted a great deal from transactions in which the entire sales amount counts as revenues to transactions in which only the commission collected by GRPN counts as revenue. EBITDA, cash flow, and, even gross profit are more meaningful measures of GRPN’s progress."
Remember - Groupon has the platform and PATENT for services! Why is this so difficult to understand?
Today starts the next leg up.....Closing above above the 200 DMA....extremely bullish!
"Is anyone doing the math? This price is not even close to actual value, and I even question if the books were cooked.. this is at best a 19.00 stock at best on the news.. so this tells me gain ROBINHOOD to the hype.. Anyone in their right mind gets out before it falls back next qtr to 15"
EBAY and GRPN makes some sense ...GRPNs customer base of 50/60 million has significant value and has been way overlooked...In fairness they have not unlocked the true value of this co. but the potential is clearly there... EBAY also looking to revamp its model .. may be able to integrate into their biz for minimal cost... very important quarter for GRPN imo ..
Amazing how much the charter goes down on up days....hummmmmm
this stock is the worst when will be ever break out of this range! What happened to earnings must be BK if they announce earnings or goes to 10 on some shananigans
keep buying.............. puts... then cover and watch this stock go
"Any predictions?? I have one, Brad will be Puffing today!!"
Need some advice!! Should I still buy in at this price??
Guilermo you need to get into stand up comedy!
"Why is that? As Groupon advised this morning, its Annual Meeting of Stockholders yesterday approved a 1-for-20 reverse share split. In this scenario, investors who owned, say, 1,000 shares of the Groupon stock this morning will end up with just 50 shares when trading resumes tomorrow. ""The reverse stock split will become effective at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on June 10, 2020,"" said Groupon. But it appears a lot of investors aren't interested in waiting for the closing bell to ring. They're selling their shares ahead of the reverse split."
Candlestick Buyhttps://www.americanbulls.com/SignalPage.aspx?lang=en&Ticker=GRPN
Groupon will most likely double by end of year . Don’t miss your opportunity to buy it now
Volume at 3:15 EST was approximately 3.8M shares. Low comparatively speaking to the prior 7 or so trading days. Let's see how the stock closes. Down on low volume is not a big concern.
"Look at the volume drop, only fast money is selling because it touched the 200 day 4.89 go figure buy all weakness you will be rewarded if you have patience. GLTA"
all about volume
Hey Christopher - you're looking good cupcake. HAHAHAHAHAHHA
"To all bagholders, the lesson today is to never invest your hard earned money in companies with bad fundamentals. Yes this trash beat some low expectations but the company has very poor fundamentals. To expect today to be an up day is psychotic and you very well played yourself."
Insiders can't prop this dog up....wait til the next TWO earnings calls. This will be a low penny stock.
oh lala oh lala!
Latest short interest gets released after the market closes today. I expect minimal change from the November month end report.
Combination of last quarter which went nowhere with a good report and this one that appears to be even better. I.M.H.O.
Guilermo is Dan is John LOL!!!!!
ready for the short squeeze?
Good luck all - I sold - was not happy with forward guidance and the dilution of shares.
Only people looking for a discount buy Groupon stock.. how can an investor ever get full value in a stock like this.. it will never happen.. google would never offer 6 billion again.. maybe 3 billion.. it's a Groupon.. disappointment coming..
"In one session the stock then from failing to break through the 200 day Moving avg. of 4.87 testing the 50 day Moving Avg. of 4.6566, for all the people on this board who keep talking about charts how is that working out? Charts don't make you money. Stop reading them."
If we beat the expectations of earnings...will we POP and how much?
I would be a lot happier about this news if we were sitting at $6 before the Recode piece came out. Do we really think we'll get a fair price on the stock? I'm doubtful (but still a holder...). Good luck!
"Funny, Groupon outperforms Amazon today. Nasdaq was down 243 points last check, ouch. Hope people are well diversified. Time for a Single Malt with a Tums chaser, let's make it a double."
Lefkofsky sold another 1.5M shares this week as reported late this PM via the company’s Form 4 SEC filing.
"I am a solid ""hold"" on Groupon -- I need to see some leadership and direction. That said, I thought this analysis on SA was pretty good. Nothing is being sold here..."
Perfect time for a buyout just like fitbit. Just look at how many customers they already have. Same shorts say it can be replicated yet google already had a smartwatch and bought out the competition. Because of the customer base
When a company losing this much money has their stock go from 4-40... you know the market is gonna crash!!
wait till the upcoming Reverse Split announcement. Will lose another 20%.
Going down .. make money daily with this stock - not never .. still have a chance to sell at a good price..
John/Ji told you “Owning this stock is good business sense “LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Lots of cash and short positions that will be unwinding and propelling this higher. AH panic among short sellers trying to convince others this company has no chance. I'm not saying this is a great pick for an investment, but certainly there are better short candidates than one with so much cash, already been thru R/S, and obliterated wall street numbers during covid quarter. I mean, can't you guys find something with better downside ?"
Old good news https://www.fintechinshorts.com/groupon-gets-new-activist-investor/
"If one can put their wishful thinking aside and look at the fundamentals of how Groupon earns revenue, there's no other option than to short it into bankruptcy. Merchants use Groupon to promote their goods and services and many of these business actually receive Zero from Groupon as it's a means of customer acquisition. So here's the question I pose to all you people with GDS (Groupon Derangement Syndrome)... what do you think the merchants are going to do when someone walks in with a Groupon when they have been shut down for weeks and possibly months? EXACTLY."
"Thought I would share the latest short information data with the board so everyone can get a better understanding of the bigger picture. Again if Williams wants to make a big splash, this is his opportunity. Otherwise the BOD should start looking at alternatives as Williams has been CEO since 11-2015 which is plenty of time to turn this ship around.http://www.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3062-nasdaqshort-highlites.html"
Was there any good news??
GROUPON is underpriced by 45% from its highest forward estimated price.Watch for more upgrades from legitimate brokerages going forward.
the pinnacle of.. wait we havent had an increase in corona cases... might show light at end of tunnel. and all these venues.. need filled.. how do you get groups to max out the venues because now every dollar made counts.. yeah.. selling the experience with groupon. since nobody is having any experiences... they will be running for cost savings to compensate for the boredom of quarantine.
"I noticed the Groupon app climbed up this weekend to #6 in the Apple App Store rankings for the Shopping category. Not sure completely what is it implies, but I would say that’s a good sign for a company that has been beaten down by short sellers in spite of it being more & more profitable."
"overreaction, oversold. wait for the short squeeze"
"hello, a long time holder of this stock, but go back to 2013/2104.. the stock was at 10.00 pre-split (200) .. unless you are a new buyer, this company has no clue to pivot... I recovered from others due to covid .. I am saved #happyholidays"
Going down- sell when it is green at any price! Basically for all stocks you can use this methodology in the current market..
1st qtr.rev. $295M ?
Anyone think they would take a buyout rather than a reverse split?
Groupon sales are heavily down during thanksgiving and black Friday. This can be easily seen in current runup post Monday. Future prospect is also not good as there is going to be heavily decline happening in local sales due to COVID situation worsening. Fear of Hospitals getting full and staff stretching is bad for groupon types stock.Q4 EPS and Revenue Estimates are heavily up. There is no way Groupon going to meet that. It will lag by easily 20%-30%
"A year ago this company would have missed badly and blamed the weather. But instead had solid results versus plan and raised guidance. Really like the beat and raise strategy. Best way to grow multiple. The management team has done a good job repositioning, investing, launching new products and weathering adversity. All about local and those key metrics and profitability were stronger."
Going down more in AHOh John....
Looking for it to break $3.88 and above for positive E.R.
"Groupon WILL continue to sink in price for ignoring their deals that are NOT doing well. Their algorithm pushes deals that are doing good (strange WHY you push a deal that is doing fine by itself) and it ignores almost 7/8's of the deals that are not doing well. Seems to me, to get better sales and volume you push the deals that are not doing good into doing better. To top it off they really screwed up Living Social as well (who was doing well with sales on deals that we not doing good). And after talking with the head of Travel Sales, I was told, and I quote ""your sales will NEVER be the same as before"". This coming from the HEAD of Sales...hmmm someone need to be replaced that is FOR SURE. Until they start TRYING to sell they NEVER will, all you are is blotch and link on their web site"
Board better than Comedy Central channel
"Waiting for the finalization of LivingSocial acquisition.I had been an investor (more than 8 months) for GRPN and had to dump my shares in the AHS after the SocialLiving acquisition announcement. GRPN CEO says it is a non-material event, but, I do not think so. At this time, it is very interesting the timing of this acquisition announcement, well, most of investors know that GRPN has been almost 5 years as a public company and its share structure is supposed to be changed soon. There are too many things to worry about investing in this company again, but, definitely I will wait and see how the acquisition will be finalized. Perhaps we will have some good news ahead...I"
"Will have a hot tip for you at 4:00 PDT for a short sale. Hoping midday tomorrow I can say, ""Told Ya So""."
Global short squeeze today on all stocks 
"To see what can happen post revers split, look at Nabors (NBR), ..... they did their reverse split about 6 weeks before GRPN. Remember GRPN is LOADED with cash already, no financing or offering in the works here to dilute common stockholders.... R/S was brilliant move."
"As a follow up to my prior post PAR Capital's last reported holdings was 6.9M shares as of November 14. They have been the large buyer since the end of Q3, approximately 35M shares.https://whalewisdom.com/filer/par-capital-management-inc#tabholdings_tab_link"
Short interest dropped by over 20% from 44M shares to 34M shares. This is the lowest amount of shorted shares in 2 years.
GRPN is down 13.15% to 0.85
I think FER's prediction yesterday is appropriate for today based on the way the volume has set up over the past 5 trading days. To reiterate +/- .25 today.Happy trading!
Hari go back to bed
Its getting closer to Thanksgiving which means its Black Friday time!! Let's Go!!!
Jack the VisionaryLOL!!!!!!!!
"Reducing the SG&A by streamlining process is really amazing and a big step forward. Company said in the letter""we made the decision to streamline and simplify the business. We were operating in too many countries with too many systems and an overly complex organization that slowed down decision making and progress. In the past three years we went from 47 countries to 15, from eight technology platforms to one and from a peak of more than 12,000 employees to just over 6,500. We’re now producing more Gross Profit than we were three years ago, and we’re delivering it with about $200 million less SG&A.""Go Long!"
JOHN told you 6 today
"I could not believe what I just read, not the missed numbers after ER but the reverse split that they want to do that companies typically resort to when the share price is below a dollar and are told to do so. This announcement might just drop the stock to go under a dollar. The management team is running this company to the ground after paying themselves. Why would they announce a reverse split when none is needed? Thoughts."
Mic Must be related to John
on June 15 Groupon going to shut down his retail market so called groupon gateway marketplace which is most profits groupon gets from there. I thing by end of the month Groupon will go back to down $2-3
"CEO and CFO have to go, they're failing. How about shareholder appreciation. Step down, or sell the company, you need to be paid to perform. $1 base annual, gravy train is over"
Start selling —- this down to $2.5.. then BABA will put more money in..
Game time. Back in for some more quick profits. Lol so funny to see the same ol bears still here bashing since .80 cents. Give it up already guys. SOO many other stocks to profit from in this market.
Goldman wants to BUY your shares at a lower price.They do this all the time.They need to be investigated by the SEC.
"Yes, currently they have more cash then debt. Here is the but, Groupon generates less revenue each year!!"
"No buyers here.. uber looks to be a better long, even if they lose this company’s market cap every quarter!!"
Either way its going down!
"Basic, thanks for all the warnings. LOL Market seems to be listening to you.Who would touch GRPN now ??? Apparently alot of folks..... and eventually you as well.Unless you are here to just blow hot air."
Poor J shell shocked 
back to where it was 5 days back !!
great company! will go back to 60 in no time...
Try August 3rd...Don't believe everything in the chat room.

were going to squeeze to 4$

"Gentlemen, I believe with the right trigger - we could have a massive short squeeze unleashed here."
Below $2 than delisted Groupon
"Earnings is in 11 days, we should run up until then with states reopening"
Any idea what time they usually post earnings? I wish everyone luck tomorrow (except the people who are short of course ) they made .03 last quarter and things at improving so I’m thinking .04-.05 best case scenario would be a halt for news the. Bam! Buyout announcement. Not likely but defiantly possible.
I will take slow and steady!!
Plummeting revenues....a failed business model and a planned reverse stock split....No thank you......... MTNB
Consistent & steady rise back to $10+ is underway. GO GRPN!
Double beat - back to 60$ we go????Oh Zeljanica LOL!!!!!!!!!
"Wow, that was a quick .20 drop at the close"
"nice move last couple of days, but low volume.. Go GRPN "
"If you divided the reverse Groupon made, the stock is only trading under $10 dollars from its early day high of $20."
Not worth the advertising money. Starting to feel this stock is hopeless.....someone snap me out of it!!
Brad..Once a Puffer always a Puffer!! Groupon has a nice Bong on sale for you!!
UBS Adjusts Groupon's Price Target to $47 From $30; Buy Rating Kept
Reverse splits avoid delisting. Not many companies can RS to success. That 27 print seemed like a short covering pump.
"Check out Brad's post from 2 days ago. He was right, no denying pumpers..."
"As I said the action is crazy and a bit eye opening. A bid comes in for 200K shares and it disappears. A large block, 350K, hits the ask and fills instantly at a lower price than the prior bid. Eye opening. The selling is orderly and almost controlled. Not sure what to make of all of this."
"Why sell? Ridiculous, next earnings will be a blowout. GO GROUPON!"
Agreed FER is a moron and is clueless
Alibaba and Jack Ma are now taking over banking in China. They want to do the same in America. They want to own the internet and financial services throughout the world. Owning GROUPON is a legal foothold in the USA. This will happen.
"Give it 3 days for margin shorts to cover, then is the time to short. I actually use Groupon from time to time, but it certainly is not what it once was."
"What a laugh!! I thought six or so weeks ago the Management of Groupon I believe said they were looking for a 'Buyer'. I also believe the Alibaba is a major holder of equity in Groupon. Apparently, Alibaba HAS NO Interest in culminating a deal for Groupon. I expect a slow deterioration of their/our Investment.....SAD. Realist_one"
"big banks and funds hold and buy this. why we small fish worry at this price level. with brand and technology and customer base, Groupon can be successful and turn around in two years. patience."
"Bankrupt Brad,.01,Barry at the shrinks today upping their Meds, cant understand why their so Broke!!"
"Strong Buy. Groupon will stay in shopping. Mark this post! All retail stores are closing JCP, Macys etc... Groupon knows how to make money on line. They can take advantage turn this around and make it over $20 stock. Hell Groupon has a lot more value then ETSY that went over $ 50 recently. They just need to release the news that due to the Corona Virus and other Economic conditions Groupon will keep the shopping in North America maybe Europe. The only reason Groupon has not gottent up like ETSY is becuase they have to do a better PR. Release news weekly about the company. Stay engaged.And then all you guys can RUN TO THE BANK!"
I think the IBM lawsuit is why the buyout hasn’t been announced yet. It went to the jury yesterday so as soon as there is a verdict and a judgement amount then the sale can proceed. It’s about 5% of GRPNs market cap so that is fairly substantial.
Wants to sell itself?Maybe nobody wants it

"As a stock trader for 31 years I know one thing: NEVER sell for a loss in a ""panic"". Never. It is better to take 1 or 2 25-40% LOSING plays per year and never panic sell, then it is to panic sell and take 20 or 30 or 40 losing plays of 5-10%, when many of those turn around and become WINNING plays if you just hold the shares for 24 hours or so. Percentage-wise, you lose a LOT more by panic selling for smaller losses, than you do by holding your position and taking a much smaller number of BIGGER losses. Reject my free advice if you want, but it has proven true for me. :-)"
"Finally a weak day to open new positions. Guillermo just did that. You gotta do that every day this happens. It won't happen very often. We are still talking of :1) a less than $1.50 pre-split price.2) a $2B revenues company with a market cap of $800M (undervalued by at least 50%, AT LEAST; a fair value should be AT LEAST $1.5B so a price $50-$60.3) a company hit hard by covid. With covid fading, this will grow like in 2009, which is 20-30% a quarter or doubling every year. 4) a LEAN restructured company with shrinking expense That is again Guillermo maintains its $100 12-month target and $180 24-month-target.Disclosure: we are LONG, very LONG on this equity, LOL."
"I am a consumer and small stockholder—love groupon and use it regularly. I think there might have been a problem with the quality of the products they were selling. For instance, earrings bought were not as represented—a lot smaller than appeared in photos. This stopped me from trusting the product choice. Maybe upping their game with better and tested products made in the USA by artisans—just an idea."
"Anybody checked OSTK? GRPN can do the same. And even better. We do have the right CEO and the right team now....congrats to all longs, Guillermo promises fun times ahead."
Sell today.. you will be happy tomorrow
Miles you new? You sound scared. This stock has more cash then enterprise value. This is an easy long buy.
I sure hope that management doesn't screw us over as they have too many times in the past. Hard to be hopeful when there are no positive announcements and no apparent investor interest in the stock. Dead stock at the moment.
Buy in the morning and sell late day!..Just dont tell brad he refuses to stop Puffing!!
What's going on??
Shorting a stock under $5 is weeeeeee taw dud! Ya didn't know?
"On 11/6 the evening before GRPN reported earnings it closed at 3.26. On that same day the SPX closed at 2755. You do the math. #keepbashing. Its an option with no expiry, and 2.8bln in revenues. Last day for tax selling."

"Groupon will be fine, business going in right direction!!"
Next short interest report will be released early next week. I am curious to see how earnings and the recent pullback have impacted the numbers. I officially do not own any GRPN as of yesterday but will continue to follow. Best wishes to all who are invested.
When this gets back to ipo levels we'll all celebrate.
with small business looking to bring back customers. GRPN will be crucial in the mix.
Groupon just had a reverse split and everyone thinks this is so good. It’s not u will see maybe it will go up but this thing is not going to work

In the last 4 quarters GRPN earnings have exceeded analyst expectations by $.09 combined. If they can continue with results like that the stock will easily exceed $6-7 by December.

"Groupon Bests Q3 Street Estimates4:07 PM ET, 10/26/2016 - MT Newswires04:07 PM EDT, 10/26/2016 (MT Newswires) -- Groupon (GRPN) reported Q3 revenue of $720.5 million, better than the analyst consensus of $710.5 million on Capital IQ. Non-GAAP loss was $0.01 per share, narrower than expectations of a loss of $0.02 per share. For the full year, the company said it raised its revenue guidance to a range of $3.075 to $3.150 billion, vs. the Street view of $3.102 billion."
Fer where are you??
Breaking down again. Don't try to catch a falling knife.
Why is the stock going down further????
"Is Groupon trading? 3 cent range...No money here for longs, shorts or Market Makers...Oh more insiders selling to institutions...Not what you see during a buyout...this is more of a washout."
The volume has been tremendous recently. It seems like someone is accumulating. Maybe a buyout coming?
5m close will see red
why can't this company make $
"Most of the expectations the CEO and CFO are mentioning on the call have little or no foundation. The CEO has done a total 180. If anyone has listened to past calls Williams would constantly tout how GRPN is executing on its strategy and success is imminent. The results in Q4 are the facts. There is no way he can predict how the local market will perform. Amazon, Living Social and Google all saw this strategy as unsustainable/ unprofitable. I encourage anyone that owns shares to SELL.Full disclosure...I am a former shareholder that exited my position in late 2018. I follow all of my former holdings to assess my strategy on buying/selling and the timing of those trades."

bigger issue now is who's buying and why?for a bad day on the D0W this retreat is fairly orderly if not minor
if this stock goes back up to 3 bucks my .10 cent calls are going to be worth at last .30 cents maybe even more.
"$36 for this stock , will blow past it. it should pop up to $40 on Friday. . Since they are having the best black Friday sale."
The joke that is Pooop on. Zacks just did an analysis of Poooop on and gives zero reason to own this dog.
J you really love this stock don't you

J bought 10k at 3.15
Groupon on Wednesday laid off 130 customer-service representatives as the company reassesses its customer service unit.Where you Poop-on??? What a scam this company is. More layoffs to follow by 4th Quarter.
Waiting for Chairman of Board (who as CEO was pretty useless) to sell another five million shares. Using this POS as his personal banking account.
"Model is shaping up. Don't lose faith, it is looking much better. The business has a real chance for success. Go GRPN!"
Anyone think this IBM suit could be what was holding up an outright purchase?
The macroeconomic and geopolitical environments are as fragile as they have been for quite some time now. Be cautious and weary as there could some very turbulent times ahead.
A great time to get in!
Stop reading charts they don't work on the upside or downside.
Great stock to short right now.
"Ever heard of blue chip stamps, anyone ?"
Looks like another leg lower is coming..
"I mean sure buy the dip, but don't try to catch a falling knife."
This is the NEW GROUPON not the old one.
why it is gaining
"local is not going far,,, they need DASH or AirBB to buy them,, I do not want to be on the wrong side of this... closed my $37 short...."
This is a bit much for just a revenue miss on their weakest quarter. Picked some more up at 3.32. Shorts will start to cover and bring the price back up a bit. Will hold till next quarter I guess. I personally think they will get bought out eventually.
Another loss. I have to stay away from stocks under $5.....Lesson learned.
Initiated position again at 1.80
Groupon should sell tickets on their platform
"Over the past week or so I have received promotions from FedEx, Sprint, AMZN and GOOG offering discounts at Six Flags, Marriott Resorts, Darden Restaurants and Macy's. To me it looks like the cross promotion business could severely affect GRPN's overall value. I wouldn't be surprised if this stock is capped. However considering the aggressive nature going on in M & A there is always a chance multiple parties would want this company. I wouldn't bank on it though."
Card link offers - Visa partnershipRemember my post from earlier this week.If we get some news on new partnership with other credit card company besides Visa or some growth with Visa I think we can go 30-50% overnight. Groupon membership could increase dramatically due new members from credit card deals (who doesn't use one)...it can be huge.
How many of you waiting for that 6.9B takeover price?? It will happen soon!! Right ?
"There is a support level right at $24.00 that we need to break through, and if we do, I think this could go to -$23.75 very quickly. :-)"
.01 gain after hours...... This is going to be huge tomorrow

$GRPN This is a great company. Lots of cash and solid deep bench of people with experience. $ETSY is at $50 and is not even close to Groupon valuation. Online Shopping will be huge. Strong BUY!

5.1M shares traded hands today slightly above 50% of the past 90 days run rate. I like the price action...the volume is a bit concerning.
TU= ST AND TS- ARE THEY ALL THE SAME ? Anyway for the real stock holders here - what happened with any of the class action suits = did the carpetbagging lawyers lose steam?
"One thing to consider about GRPN....Rich Williams has assembled a solid a highly respectable leadership team. Randolfi - CFO, Krenzer - COO, Bodell - CTO, Sullivan - CPO and Carr-Smith as SVP GM North America. These folks have impressive backgrounds and match up with many high profile front offices. A good reason to invest IMO."
What did I tell you all - now they will get de-listed ...about time this has been a dog with fleas for a LOOONG time....
Unbelievable. It feels like this stock hasn’t been green in a month.
Shorts just covered that trade is now over. Own it or sell it but don't really on the shorts!

"Anyone who has been waiting to sell, will on this pop, plus the remainder of options players that are positioned around the quarterly results are exiting the trade.

"Buy, by, bye...GRPN will be at $18 in February 2027.Shorts are wrong. Mr. Market is mistaken. Pure manipulation. Management has this sinking ship under control and turning it around.See you bagholders at the bottom..."
George meet John you two will get on great 
"Groupon, Inc should buy out TSLL for delivery."
Do not get why this sold off with the upgrade!
The new plan is not a slam dunk in any way. FCF fell by 40% in Q4 YTY. They are now transitioning not only out of goods but also away from heavily discounted experiences -- which is why many users use GRPN. This is a Hail Mary pass by a team that has failed. GLTA.
"Is anyone seeing Groupon plus marketing anywhere? They should really be targeting the dating sites like plenty of fish, that you can use your credit card and your date will never know you are using a Groupon."
"Market is capitulating based on the trade situation, privacy matters and fed uncertainty. Until the dust settles, the road will be choppy."

"Groupon EPS beats by $0.28, beats on revenueBy: Jignesh Mehta, SA News Editor Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN): Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of -$1.63 [beats by $0.28]GAAP EPS of -$7.53 [misses by $4.11]Revenue of $374.15M (-35.3% Y/Y) [beats by $22.45M]"
"Can anyone tell me why GRPN sits at 4.69 ? Oh I can, the 50 day moving averga is 4.67. How odd......people tradind a sub 5 dollar stock on technicals that is break even with a pile of cash and possibly being taking over going into a weekend. Makes perfect sense to me."
"MorningStar : 4-Stars, Fair value $4.6Recent Analysts since 11/8 : 2 hold , 1 sell, 1 buy ... Average price $4. (lowest 2.9, highest 5.6)Can't really go that bad from here. This company is making money. Someone will want this. They can make the money back in 5 years in a buyout."
"There's Groupon fatigue among vendors who's deal in this money grabbing thing is pretty meager when it's all said and done.Restaurateurs are growing cold on it as the Groupon user is usually the cheapest of customers, little or no up sale over the Groupon value, bad on tips, it is just awful, and restaurant serving staff absolutely dislike these cheapskates."
Gropeon closed near lows. Bad candlestick but summer markets.
..closed positive on over 40million shares..good luck.....
This stock for now for buy to cover.It is good for short sell and buy to recover... just for now!
"wait where's everyone shorting this? WHERE IS EVERYONE?Hello, anyone here? Oh busy covering their positions. Looking at a chart this is just the beginning. I said to buy CALL OPTIONS at $25, I say buy them today buy them at $40 and keep buying them till $50 because they will ALL BE in the money very soon."
"Anyone think GRPN can reconsider, and take Google up on that $10/share offer that Andrew Mason declined about 4 years ago?"
PROFIT TAKING TIME!!!
The last time GRPN closed near this level was back on July 6th. What will be the catalyst to reverse course?

"I don’t usually pay attention to what Cramer says; however, I do agree with a statement he made yesterday. He said that GRPN had “hockey stick” potential. I do think this is possible if GRPN can show not only that it can be profitable (as it already is) but that it can both be profitable and be able to grow revenue. If GRPN does this, we could indeed see a sudden, significant, positive reaction by the market."
"This online-based coupon service has seen a falling topline for the past 12 consecutive quarters on a year-over-year basis. This is an enormous red flag for a business that isn’t able to turn a reliable profit. The online coupon space has been saturating quickly, and this has been significantly impacting Groupon’s ability to grow.The company’s goods selling business had been a drag on the firm’s financials, and the company dumped this segment following earnings to focus on local experiences. Groupon has been desperately pivoting strategies ineffectively, displaying poor management capability, which we saw with the goods business.Groupon has illustrated an inability to retain users with the number of active users dropping every quarter for the past 7 consecutive quarters. This is a dying business, and you can see this when going on the app. I live in Chicago and had once been an avid Groupon user, but frankly, the quality of deals the platform offers has gone downhill over the last two years.Some may wonder how much further this stock can fall, considering it lost 95% of its value since its IPO in 2011. This company has proven its inability to compete in this saturated space, and management’s attempts to revive Groupon’s top has only caused more damage for the company. I think this stock is on its way to bankruptcy unless a buyout saves shareholders. Management doesn’t appear to have the proficiency to turn this dying business around."
"Suit is old news, the damages IBM is seeking is the headline. I believe this event is already baked into the stock. The movement will come once a decision is rendered."

I just bought groupons better use them quick
Shorts pushing price down in pre market so they can cover huge amounts of shares at the open. If you think about it they can push the price down 5-6% with only a couple hundred thousand shares then they can cover millions of shares at that lower price.

Word from management: we're not dead yet.
Short interest decreased ever so slightly during the most recent reporting period. This is 3 consecutive updates where short interest has remained at or below annual lows. Total short interest is just over 36M shares which is still high considering the float. The trend is positive.
At this price....I think this company is a good buyout candidate ....Apple would benefit if they bought them
One 60k sell made GRPN drop 2 cents.Very low volume trading and very tight price range. I really feel strong about our upside and earnings call.
Buy on the dips.Simple process that smart winners always use. Losers stay losers by selling on the dips.Are you a winner or a loser?
good chance for 5.20 today imho.
I believe these are insiders buying now that the trading window is open for them. This is an extremely bullish sign.
J would still be in love with this stock if it dropped to 5 cents Kinda weird 
See ya!! I’m done with this worthless stock!

Good comedy...been screaming about this fake company for years. They sell coupons and rip off most businesses.
Over 5 over 7 over 8 over 9...All of us would love to go over 6 and never look back!
I am seeing very healthy consolidation for GRPN stock over the past 10 days. I believe that Groupon stock can easily reach $38 during Thanksgiving holiday.
"Piper Jaffray refuted the claims. The trading is a bit alarming considering the overall market has been positive. Management needs to have something positive to say other than a meaningless market survey. My concern is today’s action was eerily similar to the start of a daily downtrend, a few cents per day, that came on the heels of a run upLet’s hope Williams and team have something positive to say very soon!Watch for further insider activity."
Huge footsteps are will be coming.....
Buyout price $10 a share? Maybe 5.5-6 billion market cap?
Looks like short term support at 5.27......Just used a Groupon discount for the first time- went well.

Groupon offers so many great things! Having deals with local vendors is a big plus. Just need the lawsuit to be handled correctly. I can see this company being a big boost to the economy!
"With 42m share short (12% of float), any good news could send this stock back above 5."
Poor J and JOHN thought the gains would hold
so is it true about the buy out?
"If you haven't done you need to email investor relationship at groupon.com IR @ groupon . com.Ask for the CEO immediate resignation. If we get Lewoski right away, this thing will jump back above $2.Williams had every opportunity and failed miserably. There might be some criminal actions but that's a different story. We need a new CEO now."
thinking -18% fall
I feel like Groupon is about to make a move upward risk/reward seems good here maybe they sell or merge but something has to be on the horizon been very quiet for to long now...
the run up is over.. time to short again..
I'm out of my short position initiated at $28Thanks for playing! :)

Wow...another explosion of volume at the close. A 763K trade right at the bell. Something is up!
Buy now or bail now?
I read the report. I didn't see the statement about dividends. Anyone know what the dividend payout will be?
I wonder if the company is buying any shares on as part of their $300M buyback program. They're probably waiting for a better entry point. The chose not to buy shares last quarter at similar prices.
The stalker is back
another effort by GRPN.. go long !!

Load up the truck....over reaction!!!!
Glad to see others that share my opinion.. CEO must go or get a big investor in!!

I assume going up in the ranking is good, in general, however, I don’t know whether anything significant can be concluded from this move. The"
Doesn't look like investors believe Groupon is worth more than $5 in a takeover.
Will go up today by closing
Baba did not buy grpn.. sell this pos and move to a stock that moves..
can anyone plz provide updates from the call?
Here comes the infamous GRPN post earnings drip downward. No I am not short for those who refuse to ignore the historical performance of this stock.
Why the dip today?
Maybe we just needed a shake-out yesterday with some stops triggered - who knows where we are headed but I think this may be the start to the accumulation phase (i.e. upward we go).
I doubt that there will be a buyer. Definitely nothing happening here today!
Groupon should do great in a recession. Typical advertising requires paying upfront. Lord knows how much money I've waisted on phone book and HomeAdviser type advertising with almost no payback. Thankfully the economy is good enough I no longer need to advertise. GRPN is better as there is no upfront payment. The profit is just shared. Plus during a recession consumers are looking for deals more then ever.

Oh JOHN that post was absolutely hilarious 
"Groupon is not a bad company for Customers. I see a lots of new businesses showing up in Groupon. Its a good advertising..You dont ever lose the Groupon ( what you paid ). I had bought a Defensive Driving Groupon more than a year ago and was still able to apply the code to get my cost reduced by what I paid so technically I did not lose any $ even though the Groupon was valid only for 120 days. The problem lies with the top management - BOD and CEO( he looks lazy ) and their boated staff. Its a no brainer that if a new company acquires Groupon , they can make a hell lot more profit by just terminating 1/3 of the staff . I am a millennial and attend a lot of parties and events and at least someone or the other comments about how they checked out a restaurant using G+ or attended a gig thru Groupon . Whats not to like about Groupon ??"
"Brad muted as well. Why wasting time with background noise. Guillermo is here to make money, lots of money. And the new Groupon is the answer. Buy call options."
Dan you should take your comedy act on the road you would do great
All the Puffers are back today!!
Just got a nice tip from (http://www.stocktip.xyz)
In at $5.50. Will it ever get back to that ?Thoughts please
This was a kitchen sink quarter. Focusing on experiences is the right move and where trends are shifting. When looking for discounts on experiences this is where people go to.
Looks like John is going to be puffing the 1’s
@ the end the shareholders will need to take a vote for a decision … in the meantime just watch the volatility that takes place this week while we wait. HOLD!
"Chicken Little....""the sky is falling and Groupon is going to bankrupt "".FAKE NEWS"

This is the type of movement you get when funds can't show they own a position at month or qtr end.
"Sell, sell, cell"
Mad money says its a reopening stock. not many like it..
"The business plan and platform for GRPN makes sense. As a customer, I look through the coupons and offers and buy these deals and then redeem them at the retail or service businesses. With each deal, GRPN makes money. This is a game changer compared to traditional advertising where the business has to come up with money for advertising and there is no guarantee that it will work. It just need a management team that is creative and outside the box thinker to succeed in a recession environment that is here now! God Bless and stay well."
$GRPN could squeeze next week
when there is blood on the street... just got into a smallish position. I mean the market cap is now half of grpns revenue. So not a lot of downside and plenty of upside. and then there is the everlasting possibility of a takeover
volume dried up
just SHORTED at $25.11
Pray for J. His losses are steep
Convergence... The stock's 50-day moving average of $4.62 is below its 200-day moving average of $4.67. Now what chart readers?
This is nuts. Earnings down and stock goes up. How you guys sold out.
J is John
"If you google Zacks and Groupon rating, it looks like Zacks upgraded GRPN yesterday from a sell to a buy. Then today downgraded it from a buy to a sell. Lol"
"Thoughts on this movement? Reality finally coming into valuation? Or, just FER finally selling, and the stock going up to hurt his feelings?"
GRPN reached a new 52 Week Low at 3.80
Would there be a chance that they would halt the trading that day at 9 .30 am then announce something great on 10.00 am.
"You people are like a herd..Do you know how much cost cutting will be involved getting out of goods..No more inventory to carry, no more employees to manage that inventory..No more wharehouses to rent to store that inventory. probably a good 2000 less employees. It took 40 percent expense to manage a 20 percent return on goods. Experiences are where the profit is for this company. Did you think they were gonna compete with Amazon and Ebay for goods?? Mig capital, blackrock and other big investment firms increased their position last 2 months..they wanted this plan!!"
Should be down over 50% - longs are lucky.
We will see $1.xx before end of AH
"Not one post on this board has any value or relevance. The stock broke the 200 day moving average and all the chart readers are puking, the same people who bought 5.80 on the way up. Charts don't make money just headlines. Good luck. Stock trades at 1x sales how cheap should it get. No one wants to buy things that go down only up charts."
Oh no approaching a moving avg. Now what ? 4.60. FER 2.89 is when 2025?
Grpn now on its way to the 1's. J not worried one bit 
Large buy 240k shares on the bid 2.92..
Groupon had surprised investors too many times before negatively. This will not be an exception. Watch!!
"Normally a 38% jump is grand but when it only takes the price just past the post split figure, well....sounds like a daytraders dream."
"ok longs, time to squeeze these shorts, check ur inbox for the plan"
this is bullish price action now with a days volume in 1.5 hrs on absolutely no news
Beautiful work by shorts
"It looks like they lowered earnings estimates 90 days ago from .04 to .00 they have made a profit in each of the last 4 quarters, so I don’t see why they can’t beat this number. As long as their revenue is good and then they guide higher due to the Amex and Universal announcements we should be going higher tomorrow."
It's a gift at 2.60 or below grab with two hand now..
This stock should be at 2 bucks plus look at htz a bk company is trading better than groupon at 3.50
"Bobble head Brad pumps his head up and down, 1.17s comments now only worth .17!!"
13F's continue to come in. The most notable transaction during last quarter is Sumitomo Mitsui closing out their entire position in GRPN. They sold over 7.6M shares.
"Just taking a quick breather. $3.68 by the end of week, I expect momentum to continue into ER. Also, if we are lucky maybe a buyout rumor will come out way. Traditional retailers would love to have this user base."
My friends brother works at a trading desk in New York and his information is right most of the time. He said buy a lot of Groupon .... I company is talkiing with them about something similar to what overstock is working on. Something to do with block chains and bitcoin. Have any of you heard anything about this.
"reading the tea leaves on this, when up on a completely down day.....this usually means that there is a substantial news announcement coming up that some people already know about, maybe ""another partnership""?"
"FER congratulations, thanks to your last posts you earned to be IGNORED. You are like a broken record. Bye bye."
GRPN is up 5.02% to 4.81
"Lots of selling to start the day...profit taking, short interest, rotational adjustments, tax selling, insider activity etc. I'll let you decide on the reasons for the 3% drop."
"Short interest in GRPN increased slightly by 700K shares to 36.2M, approximately 7% of the float. Not a notable change by any stretch. The total number of shares short remains high. The bad news is there are a number of investors that think the stock price is over valued. The good news is the totals haven't varied much over the past 6 reporting periods.One final thought...any positive news could send this stock propelling especially when you consider the amount of shorted shares that would start to cover their hedge."
"Poor Broke Brad, only stalks the board, cant afford not 1 share!!"
GRPN is up 5.61% to $3.01
"undervalued stock, needs a big pop before it drops..."
yahoo board is not like reddit.. probabbly many groupons will be purchased once this is on reddit.. shorts will continue to short.. redditiers will be buying the stock and groupons. Float on this stock is nothing... great combo!!
Mobile shopping is the future. Great long term stock
BABA owns 162+ million shares. They know what their doing. I'm in both now. Patience.
This looks like the end for groupon.
"Why isn’t Groupon going back to selling, prepared food, cleaning supplies etc,This is the time to restructuring investors confidence,"
Timber....after the close.
"Want to try something completely different? Goopon is 2012.MJ, a growing etf will make you money by diversifying across cash crop stocks. Single stock risk is just that..."
"Sell stops were tripped, coming back now!"
Probably worth buying after market opens
"Thank you for 10K more at 3:15, $GRPN. Company already has a buyer....easy money"
"Brad, the closet long "
This will collapse before market close from profit taking and short orders. After the earnings report prove bad fundamentals HFTs will gap the stock down to hell.
"disappointing is all I can say.. was hoping (and actually got) a good bounce, went past 5.4.. only to drop back and now hanging just above 5, which again looks will break.. will hold on more and hope for another day !! good luck longs.. Go GRPN go.. we are with you..!!"
4$ soon. It buy and buy
They kept yearly guidance the same so they must expect next 3 qtrs to do very well
AR please stop talking
Yolo loses again
I am not sure if adding board members and permanent CFO will help..was expecting better news... if not Make sure to set multiple stop loss guys!! you never know what Institutional Investors do!
This could be in an uptrend for years! Looks like they have fixed the business model.
"For this company, buying a $5MM add on TV is either confidence or desparation. Possible takeover target. I'm favoring confidence by 60% right now. Haddish's story is honest and compelling."
Positive sign.Even if the directors pay themselves with stock is because they believe in the value of the company. Know if they want to sell why not. You work hard you deserve it. Groupon by far is so undervalued and what a good play to have in your portfolio. Look at $AMZN Jeff Bezos before and after. Look at Amazon stock today. Lets Make Groupon The Next Amazon! BUY BUY BUY
@brad is going broke by shorting GRPN. Lol
John you loaded you’re truck with dead shares
You couldn't sell this company now if you wanted to. No one would approve it. Buyer would offer no more $3 a share....everyone loses. The company soon will be worth nothing. Seen this many times.
market cap of 2.37b is too cheap
"So...they made a ton of money, raised their guidance and showed a positive outlook...and they're down big AH? Cool."
"I no longer own GRPN but I still keep track of it. I cannot believe GRPN announced the reverse split on the same day as the earnings. Without the reverse split announcement, as bad as earnings were, I doubt PPS would have fallen below $2. With the reverse split announcement, I think there’s a chance the selloff will continue to $1, which is the number that came to the mind of many investors when they saw the reverse split announcement."

"Impressive price action, technicals and volume. Has turned in the a shorts hornet nest.Shorts look like this."
"Blue Horseshoe loves GRPN, keep eyes on the SC13 filings."
Keep buying and stop selling. Make some profits.Use Groupon and go get a massage and a carwash.

Buying some Groupon Christmas gifts today and just signed up for all Groupon plus restaurants near me (they need to advertise that a lot more people don’t know about it
Strong Buy https://www.cweb.com/why-is-groupon-stock-a-buy/
Buyout coming!!! They said that 4 years ago. No one wants this DOG. Easier to replicate - but just a bad business model....spen a lot of money to make no money
GRPN reached an all time low at 1.10
"If it drops below support in the mid-$20 area, the teens are imminent. I wasn't going to be very surprised if it went up today due to the enormous drop yesterday, so that speaks volumes regarding how upside interest there is right now. Their ER numbers were astonishingly awful and with no positive guidance to turn it around, anyone expecting it to go up was delusionalWhat happened to all of the pumpers like Guillermo and Bellamaxi that were so wrong?"
a bounce is coming! ! load up tomorrow! !!
Piper Jaffray just gave GRPN a 6.25 price.Buyers should take advantage of the drop.
John and EdA match made in heaven
"60+ close. Shorts, don’t let it get out of hand. It moves fast. The longer you hold, the more you’ll lose. Guaranteed!"
Only reason I'm going in Groupon this holiday season is because I've been using the hell out it personally. I think it will do well next ER.
they put commercials on during the super bowl. they have some growth money to play with
Happy New Year to all GRPN LONGS who want to break 6.I hope the selling has stopped and the smart buying opportunities have gained momentum.
"Short interest decreased slightly to 39M shares from 42M in the prior reporting period. A relatively minor drop considering the news the company was interested in putting itself for sale. The good news is for longs is if there is any kind of actual news, rumor or announcement there are lots of shares that will need to cover. Conversely, it appears the market was unfazed by the article from Recode. GLTA!"
"this is the $5 year. GRPN has flushed all the weak hands, new HIGH LEVEL CEO, and we are back to $5 after 5 years. Easy peasy."
"Listen, I covered my short at lows. If the trend really has changed or if someone could show me fundamental improvements, I'd buy this stock, it's dirt cheap here...No compelling news, convincingly good posts or insights - yet...Frontier now on platform? are you kidding me?!Prayers, hope and guessing ain't a trading strategy. Digital coupons are so 2012...show me the money today."
Jack how am I doing now?
"Just Released:Groupon Inc. (GRPN) traded on unusually high volume on Jan. 19, as the stock gained 9% to close at $5.57. On the day, Groupon Inc. saw 18.84 million shares trade hands on 51,687 trades. Considering that the stock averages only a daily volume of 7.73 million shares a day over the last month, this represents a pretty significant bump in volume over the norm.Generally speaking, when a stock experiences a sudden spike in trading volume, it may be seen as a bullish signal for investors. An increase in volume means more market awareness for the company, potentially setting up a more meaningful move in stock price. The added volume also provides a level of support and stability for price advances.GROUPON IS THE NEW DARLING OF WALL STREET."

"I perused the recently released form 14A proxy statement and I am stunned to see the COO - Steve Krenzer has 0 shares as of 4-20. How invested is he in the success of GRPN? His base salary is $625K...you would think he might want to buy a token amount of stock on the open market. On another note, did you know all the execs at GRPN received 10"

"What a great start to the day! Guess the Looney Lefts government shutdown, doesn't matter!!!!"
J. JOHN needs you right now
"Does anyone else 'read through' the last Motley Fool & Markit IHS press release articles. I Do. It's as if they want to paint a negative current image - while painting a potentially positive longer term image - at the same time. ((It's Like: Well boys & girls our 20 year school has to test the fire alarm system. We have not had a fire alarm drill in a long time (3 years), we are out of practice, we are out of compliance, we aren't even sure if all the bells even ring 100%...... But hey, we are testing tomorrow afternoon, so get ready. If all goes well, then YAY we get State Accreditation.)) maybe that wasn't a good example. But they write these articles with a true negative slant (and leave room enough for the fact that the company may be actually doing some good things as well)."
https://bovnews.com/2020/03/31/why-we-consider-groupon-inc-grpn-and-equity-residential-eqr/
"there is value in Groupon. Once it's market cap is down to $500M someone will either buy it or take it private. Unfortunately, it means a pps of 0.85."
"John, what's the excuse now? Market up almost 400 points, GRPN up .01 with volume well below the average. How's the advertising and marketing paying off? At this rate the DJIA will need to climb to 50K for GRPN to reach $5 per share."
"okay... I am completely taking a guess on this so please all you haters and trolls keep it to yourself. between today and the end of the week this stock will drop. I think in the 3.30-3.35 range. starting Monday the 13th we will see it turn back up to the 3.50-3.60 range and by the 14th 3.60-3.80. on the 15th, leading up to the call there will be yet another dip but not too bad.Now depending on the results the sky is the limit...I am saying there will be an announcement of a buyout, but who knows.for sure we will be in the $4 range by the end of Feb unless their results are devastating."
"On its way to the 1's,JOHN could not be happpier and prouder"
"The Reverse split needs shareholder approval ... everyone and their brother , sister , cousins need to vote against such a stupid news .. everyone needs to call and email the board and other management and tell them not to do a R/S .. they will see that just making that announcement s going to pound the stock price . There is no need to even think about an R/S until they get a non compliance letter from Nasdaq ... this new CFO I don’t believe even knows what an R/S s .. going to do one to raise the stock price .. really ! That’s the stupidest reason I’ve seen or heard ever .. check out :FTR XSPA ( previously naked VRINGO THEN FORM HOLDINGS ) they have their 4th R/S preapproved already . Check out what happened when dowdupont did their spin offs and included a R/S on DD .. at least ctva has done ok ,,, Dow has a decent dividend but down on stock price ... but DD worthless down big ..Anyone have a good story about a R/S ... feel free to comment ..."
watch the stock fall $3.80 support
Very disappointed of the price movement. Will hold until next earnings
Remember that I bet we would hit 5 before 2.99?Just saying!
just keep selling
Why is the earnings forecast down but stock price is up?
Can’t/ won’t predict tomorrow’s open. Too many moving parts. More importantly is how the stock performs and the volume!
Why the volume today?
pricing like a lottery ticket..
zack rank 2. doesnt care but this should be easily go to 2.75 by jan 10th
what a joke.... only up 5 bucks.. it should be up like 300%.. was suppose to lose $240M..
John/Hari. Thought 3 would hold LO!!!!!
"this pos will go nowhere but up from here, see you in August and watch out by next Feb. next stop $4 just bought I at 3.41"
volume is so huge.. will surpass yesterday's at this rate..!!
It's kind of hard to sell whne you layoff your sales force. That was brilliant!!!! What a company!!! But people want groupons.
John has posted over and over about the truck load of shares he owns.......and now.....LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
yawning
Earnings will not be good.. 30 % revenue drop
Sorry to all the haters of this stock but long term this should be a great value as either higher pps or buyout but it WILL be one or the other...
Groupon got alots of Cash
FYI....Rich Williams will be joining Jim Cramer tonight on Mad Money 6PM EDT.
yay god giving me a chance to load up more
That massage I just bought is gonna be nice after that ER beat!!!
I will be upset if we do not beat 604mil in Rev
TMON's 10K was recently published....looks like the asset is declining.
J thinks it's holding up
This is a recession stock.. not one for a bull market.. was huge when economy was down. Potential of this stock is 8x current price in the coming years.. we will see Dow 20000. That’s a given. Look at the charts and that is what the fed has told us.. going back to normal. That means only traders profit.. not index funds.. buy grpn on any pullback.
"I could obviously be wrong, but GRPN has no catalysts for the stock to move forward. There is no reason to believe their earnings will exceed expectations. Nothing has really changed, besides GRPN+. I don't see any other catalysts. The website is stale."
JOHN and J trying to get you to buy
Hey Brad did the tree fall on you because yesterday you called for timber today...
Didn’t know about Groupon + until the call just signed up now get 30% off local restaurants I eat at all the time directly on my card.. earnings call good for something!
It's all a set up for the buy out!!!
Miss the comedy of John
Can you imagine what happens here when the stimulus package is finalized in about a week?
So glad I listened to FER and not keep trying to catch a falling knife. RIP GROUPON.
Whats the chances of an Amazon buyout ?
Big spike of confidence....BEAT!
"OK, shorts .... how much cash on hand will they have at end of Q1 ?Put me down for 685 million........ what is your guess ?"
Alibaba just bought out the remaining shares of Ele.me that it didn't already own. How awesome would it be if Groupon was next?!
"up by 8% with heavy volume on no news. Looks like a bull trap, followed by heavy dump. Going to get out now, good luck"
Discounts for college students! This thing is going to jump to 10!
Look at that volume !
https://www.foxnews.com/health/groupons-medical-services-what-to-know
Way over-valued stock.
They only missed the estimate by 1937.5 percent. A loss of $1.63 per share instead of .08
Down 3 percent. Is it time to buy??
"Rich Williams please resign, the news of your departure will do more for the share price than anything you have done for the past 3 yrs"
"Before everyone freaks out by reading garbage from 2.88. At least process real data. The institution filings should be hitting soon. That will tell the story to Sept 30 and prior. Groupons top 3 institutions are Baba, blackRock and Vanguard. Vanguard and Blackrock have not got toasted on a symbol in decades. They select good companies and ride out market dips mostly. Baba? I have no idea if they would sell their stake. I doubt it. Fidelity has been winding down (exiting) their 90 mil stake for over a year. They had ano"
I am out I do not like yelp
Groupon will be over $6 before Thanksgiving. Mark this post.
@GRPN Strong price action. Holding strong
I am still so angry about that middle of the night 1 for 20 reverse. Really what a shaft. Any news on the so many ambulance chasers with their lawsuits?? Any of them seriously working/ so aug 3rd we will see something in the ER
"Hold it, let the shorts trade with each other until all the short sellers are gone ."
New CEO coming..
Please need a help can I keep the share or sell ??? Looks like it’s just going down
SEE? in this market environment stocks can go lower and lower and lowerUNTIL a bottom is reachedWith the market above 23k there could be a decline below .50
"Yes, it will re test $4.81 in April easily and this time we are heading to $6 for sure while all the shorts have to cover and new longs join us for a big ride. Google will have to think twice to pick up Groupon at $12 again. Long term Groupon is an easy $27 dollar stock."
Poor John’s average was around five
More upgrades are coming soon
We may get a chance to buy real cheap if market goes down tomorrow
I think overstock or some brick n mortar (Walmart) should buy them down here..
we close tomorrow at 1.90 watch and learn easy

"this is good a short at this point, short with confident."
Will eBay buy grpn?
GRPN is up 13.11% to 0.70
Looking to enter if it falls below $4.35. This should have a 30% upside if the market keeps running.
"Looking at Level Two, looks like we'll either close up, down, or flat today."
Down 27% in one day........HAHAHHAHA
This thing will close below 20 watch.
This phoenix of mine is going to rise up from the ashes and will be $2 by next month.
Thinking of shorting it at 22 ? Or should i wait ?
Wait till those #s come. They haven't sold anyhting. 2nd Quarter will be Horrific. No waits till the end of June.
"So confuse with Groupon. Red after red, but I just keep buying."
GRPN is up 5.42% to 4.86
Wait till it gets near the 4.30s and buy
"He guys I am back after 6 years with thisGroupon; I heard some of my friends talking about it and They using it as market plat form ; then I decided to open it and to check in it for the near future , let me see if I can get it again after all this vacation ; good luck for every body !"
Made up yesterday’s losses. Nice work
"Crazy day....I will make one prediction, volume will surpass that of the recent daily averages. So greater than 8.2M."
I see the markets up and Groupon is down what else is new
"CNBCs Najarian sees $4 call activities and rates $grpn a speculative buy. New highs ahead? Was oversold, now overbought. Earnings will tell the tale..."
breakout @ 5.55 and will hitting 6 soon. go Goupon!
Congrats to all longs! Good thing to come
Same as always. Big tic up then slam down
@brad how do you feel today? Lol
"Grubhub hit 52 week hit earlier this month, $149. How's that GropeOn thing working out??"
Why are people selling knowing 4th qtr always groupons best??

"Excellent interview. Muckerman: They're doing well. I think this is a better deal for Groupon, because it's actually a compelling offer. It's a gift that keeps on giving, a Costco membership."
I went short at 1.50. The chart doesn't lie
Guys let's not focus on individuals but rather talk about GRPN stock..
Not much notice given for top management change...
"Time to rally up and close the $5.00-$5.30 gap, Earnings should be great in Q4.I just hope management understands that if they don't finally have a positive net income quarter and forecast that they're finished!"
"Q3 was good only for certain reasons. 1- It was summer time, covid knowledge was on high. Cases were going down due to heat. People were ready to go out with family safely. Not any more in winter.2- Hospitals were barely full. Not any more, fear and knowledge of virus is still same, but fear of not getting hospital is rising. This is even worse. Even after 9 months down the line with so many therapies and medicines death is more than 2K+ daily and its going up every single day. Hospitals and Staff is on breaking point, already broken in many states. Administrations will be left with no choice other than putting harsh restriction in place to cut the spread before Christmas else its going to be even worse. We all know vaccine is here, but reality is it will take months till it reach everyone. We still need to survive these months. If we let cases grow the way its growing it will be devastating."
It broke the plane …. going higher from here.
J praying to get his money back. Doubt it 
Why it has continuously drop for days?
grub is up huge and they get those customers from grpn
Mark you happy about loading up at way higher price than now??

Oh Brad!!!!!!
Whats going on here? Will there be any move to north today? Ot to south??? :-(
Brad is at the shrinks today..Poor Puffer..
I see $6 or $10 
Why is company still around?
wow hats off for Groupon
"To the Gimps, Brad, Barry, and .01:Jesus told me to buy at 2.35, stock now at 2.48 and going higher!!Thank you Jesus!!"
There business model is actually not bad..Margins are not good and need to improve..but entering higher margin areas and exiting lower margin areas is a step forward.. They have some decent agreements in place .. It has millions of users.. Very smart people can take this foundation and mold it into something much bigger.. Not many out there who could do it...but it is possible..There is also a lack of excitement on the street...more likely to get bought after they demonstrate a profitable biz going forward
they need to get the Xander CEO that left AT&T.
buckle up guys.. could run towards the IPO price!!
anyone see hope for this company?
"Get in and the game. Nice stock under $10, hard to find in this mess of stocks. I've been in and waiting for this over a year."
"Poor Broke Brad, his crystal ball still says bankruptcy, maybe he should sue!!"
This dog needs life-support
John have a wheelchair crash??
What a deal... cheap price..
"look at the inside buying, the boss and office workers.all the funds bought in june 2016 they know there something coming.grpn was up a ways for many months 0of and on."
This is acting incredibly well... Could potentially go much higher... Big quarter for Williams... if they can demonstrate more profitability and revenue growth many will look to enter...
"just like last year,, they had nothing good to buy for black friday sales... more headcount will be lost... they need to strike a deal with starbucks again.. or wholefoods, that is when they had revenue coming in... but they... short more today, will make more money going down next week.."
Anyone recommend shorting this?
up 3% and crossing 5 after a long long time.. go GRPN!!
That was an easy short
This is the saddest message board format ever and yahoo should go back to the old format. Loosing a lot of people and conversation boards are running dry without any new content.
GRPN is up 5.13% to 4.41
"Grpn. Should be Buying back a large number of shares at this price--- crazy if they don't .. no faith within the company? company's don't stay this low for this long, unless they are looking for $18B buyout .. :-). CEO needs to go to the public market and buy shares.. say something??"
"Groupons New Pay Policy for Deals Starting August 2019. Groupon will pay ONLY on Voucher USED , NOT Bought. So Groupon will sell your discounted deal for you and for a FEE as well, but unused vouchers remain their money, even though the client sold them and they are actually the clients property/products; How will this go over to the consumer - So far NOT well."

Nice CTO hire.....GO GRPN!
Groupon will go back to shopping. Wait until they make it official. This will skyrocket!!!!. $3-$5 even more
GRPN it Ali Ali Baba baby 
Groupon management needs to appoint a new IR person who listens to our recommendations and give us a 2 way street of communication. Some of us may have some great ideas and we work for only one goal...to make profits.

If SHORTIES...get ready to squeeze like lemon!!

hold on to your seat belts!!woo!!
looks like $6 today
John/Ji really starting to lose it now
I do not use Groupon. Seems like a dead idea.
"Downtrending into resistance. To get to $2.89999 you got to get through $4 first. I'd expect a bounce near lows. $4.11 with old 52 wl low...Still short this one. Remember Amazon paid 200mill for a daily deal subsidiary a couple of years ago, and then basically gave it away. Razor thin margins and a fickle customer. Good luck, speculators!"
What happen? It’s going down.
"The logic is if the shorts don't all cover today, this stock is going to be the successful story like Best Buy when it was attacked by the shorts down to $28 and then reversed to go higher to be $100."
2.88. FER was right about GRPN.
Everyone should buy grpn... right here..
"Timber!!!!!! Adios. Bye, bye!"
FER...I like the new name $1.17
This is a surprise today. Any word?
Take cover!
"Is it possible to close up for the day, or will it tank the last 30 minutes?"
company trying to buyback 83M shares.

Sitting with 1.28 average... Will sell tomorrow morning's high!
Maybe 2.50 this week ?
Everyone don't worry. Runner tells you 8.26 November 1 and 8.55 November 5It's all good
Company -%
ready?
"I hate to say it but i think this is going to the mid to high 3’s. A buyout is still possible but becoming less likely each day. This used to be my biggest holding and now I have 0 shares. I wish everyone luck though. I will buy back in at 3.50-3.70 level though. It’s not a bad company, they just aren’t executing like they should."
It’s Groupon deal
Holy #$%$! $5. Maybe I won't die alone in a gutter. please keep going
$5.84 seems to be the key resistance here. If it can break through it easily passes $5.99
Anyone know the tec stock symbol that’s going to be like amazon they say ??
10 years and only has made new lows.. dont see the trend changing... stock should not be bought. . Sell short...
"Insiders (including one of the founder) have bought millions of shares about a month ago. You have to wonder why. And yes, please keep shorting."
" SO ITS $2.85 now ?! According to our GRPN split history records, Groupon has had 1 split. Groupon (GRPN) has 1 split in our GRPN split history database. The split for GRPN took place on June 11, 2020. This was a 1 for 20 reverse split, meaning for each 20 shares of GRPN owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 1 share."
"I don't own any Groupon Stock and after my recent business transaction with them, wouldn't buy any Groupon stock. I purchased a product from them on their site--an anti-virus program. After I bought it, I got a confirmation that it was coming from China and would be in within 10 days. It didn't arrive. After trying to get in touch with the Chinese Merchant through a link on Groupon's order site, they tell me it'll arrive by June 5th. Still no product so I try to get in touch with Groupon itself since THEY are who I purchased the product from. Low and behold, Groupon's Customer service is a chat line with India. All she kept typing was you have to gin touch with the Chinese Vendor. So here it is June 14th and I still do not have my anti-virus program and Groupon is uncontactable. i told her I wanted to cancel the order since it's two weeks late and she said ""she couldn't do that"". In their fine print, Groupon claims that once you receive this order physically, it non returnable. Is THIS the type of company you want to invest your money in? I play the market too, but invest only in companies that have REAL customer service lines and are reputable. Maybe, just MAYBE, one of the Groupon execs sees this and a light bulb gets turned on. I am now contacting my credit card company to dispute the Groupon charge. Oh yeah, I'm cancelling my Groupon Account since I have found how they ""really do business""...... Like I said before, is this the type of company you want to invest in???? There's many others that are more worthy imo... Bill D."
A close in the green is a strong sign in overall weak market. Ill take a stance with the bulls today. 1000 shares at .90. Lets ride
"""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."" -WB."
Going red again J proud as can be
This can't even go up $.50's .. buy amazon.. make out big.. that is what the CEO of Groupon holds!!
"This is not a run up into earnings, it was over sold. Your are sitting in the middle of the Bollinger band. It's gone nowhere in a month."
"Question is how effective are those multiple lawsuits, will they all sum up to one big class action suit,What and who is liable to those serious charges, and who is entitled to monetary compensation,There is a lot of uncertainty and management is acting as hiding thieves,I believe that rich Williams and his team are all going to be fired for being dishonest with shareholders,"
"I want to thank D. L. on this board for his wisdom, generosity and input for GRPN. His knowledge has helped me to make a big difference of my GRPN investment. Thank you!"
There we go!
The brand name itself only may worth the current value. They may want to strengthen the e-commerce area.

did the spike fizzle?!
while you might be looking to buy or bought this stock was considered SELL by most analysts to a 12 mo target of $4
good they needed new CEO...long over due
"Let me repeat, SINCE 7/9 when news hit of GRPN shopping itself trading over 60 million shares the stock is down a GRAND TOTAL OF 4 cents. So let's stop all the nonsense. It's dead money until further notice. PERIOD"
just bought 30k shares
"Groupon is basically a newspaper classified ad section (remember those newspaper inserts of coupons?). There is a market For this business, but certainly not worth billions of dollars."
"If anything you might have to HOLD until 4Q imoSells go up to holidays, $5 Feb 2019 GL"
good ol fashion tuggle war here at 3.70s range
Finally someone is listening. I posted here several months ago how I thought IAC should buy GRPN. And recently how I think this company has been doing badly despite good market confidence. I also remember shooting down few confused souls who like blaming everything on shorting... clearly I welcome the news that grpn is now willing to be bought. It indicates very poor management and strategy all along. From 16billion dollars on IPO now value at 2billion I wonder what the going out price really is....
"Yesterday they couldn’t sell fast enough and today 50,000 share asks are being eaten up in seconds. I guess this upgrade got some mutual fund buyers attention. The shorts are persistent though and they probably have a ton of 5.00 put options that expire Friday that they need to sell so we shall see who wins the battle."
"Without manipulation, GRPN stock price should be over $30/share today."
GRPN reached a 52 Week low at 2.29
"There are some articles appearing about how they treat their merchants and salespeople. It has been noted that they have alot of cash on their balance sheet, but its not all theirs and there is alot of claims on that cash. They also took a $200 million draw on their revolving line of credit this last quarter. Why?, if so much cash. Something is just not right here and with alot more, and better, competition I think they are doomed."
GRPN need to maximize shareholder value and the only way is to sell the company to a bigger parent. The main hurdle is the founder
"Why did I cover at $23.00?? The lower it goes the greater the RISK of a reversal, with bargain hunters coming in. Percentage-wise, this is a BIG move, especially for one day. Does it still look good to the downside?? Yes. BUT, the risk/reward ratio has shifted, as I judge it. I am always trying to weigh and judge this risk/reward ratio, in deciding what to do, which play to get into, which play to close out of, and WHEN."
Oh Hari??
"FER, resistance is broken and now becomes support. What are your thoughts for next week?"
J put the vodka bottle down and get some sleep
Two buck chuck soon.
will go above $4
"hello my fellow short, keep shorting grpn then you might lose everything"
"Bought 1600 more today, it will rise over 5 at the close. Fb and twitter earnings were a Big miss. Next week you will See the winner, with or without buyout. 7 is possible next week."
"who loading up big block just now,"
And I feelLike I've been here beforeFeelLike I've been here beforeAnd you know it makes me wonder...Buy on the way down sell the pops
wow what a great buying opportunity....load up the truck!!
Would be great if GRPN would accept bitcoin for transactions. SQ (square) did and their stock skyrocketed!!
"GRPN stock price always reacted opposed to the previous ER if you check the last 6-8 ERs. Since this it slipped to nearly one year low and last time it popped up to ER, how many of you think this time it will dump down if it follows up-down-up-down traditions?or this time it will jump up again like last time?"
groupon is the titanic
"Huge volume just after the close, settling trades at the $5.14 closing price. Over 1M shares traded."
"Volume slowed to a multi-month low. Looks like fund managers may have completed their Q4 balancing. 6 more trading days remain in 2017. Let's see how GRPN will fare. It would be nice if Williams and team could provide shareholders with a nice surprise! FWIW, Cramer continues to opine positively on GRPN. He mentioned the stock during one of his call in segments last evening.Happy Thursday to all!"

Like to hear some thoughts if super bowl ad will have much effect ThnksTom
If it holds up today we should show some support and buy dinner with a Groupon. GO GROUPON!
This company needs to make some type of announcement
Anyone can tell who bought them out?
buy buy buy!
"Stock going to tank due to sales going to go down severely, since everyone doing online shopping, groupon barely getting any bandwidth as people spending their entire time on other big retailers. Think about it.Another strong covid wave is here. Next 2-3 cold months going to limit personal interaction, bars closing, restrictions going to come, its unavoidable to save lives. This only means local sales also going to go down in coming months and recovery is going to be much delayed than anticipated. Market cannot ignore this fact. Currently groupon has climbed 60% in last one month. There is easily scope of 25%-30% correction before it can go back up again to level of $29. Try to stay away from this and invest in better and stable stocks for near term or you will get trapped in short sellers hands."
tomorrow 6 or 7
"Can't delay the bad news forever...Come on, confession time is overdue! :-)"
I believe in this stock derbysoft and once the yelp deal happens we are golden 15$ a shares easy .

JOHN counting his losses
Grpn is a gift at this price if you want to make money from stock buy buy buy grpn and hold it for a week.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/groupon-inc-stock-still-far-190137106.htmlWho is this guy Josh Enomoto from InvestorPlace to rain on the parade of Groupon and has no stake in the stock. How much was he paid for that story .... plus Barry cheering him on. L.O.L
John got an argument with the cashier at the 99 cents store today. Complaining that the no brand spaghetti sauce had expired
BABA paying 7.50 a piece .. mark my word.
How are these earnings good? Were expectations so low that we are really sending up a company that lost 25% of their sales from a year ago AND lost .93 cents a share? Check your strategies people. This isn't good news
JOHN you all excited about 3.09?? 
Too funny....people are actually long in a company with endless lawsuits......no sales force......no viable business model....they're not selling anything right now. Good comedy.
"Bad earnings = green, good earnings = big blood bath"
How high will this go in the short term? Predictions? I've been holding for about 6 months.
I will buy again at around 2.10
"DisgrUnless GRPN doesn't come out with some good news soon, the stock will hit a new 52 week low. This stock is a disgrace."
Nice selling this morning. I love it. Thanks for the cheap stock.
Brads on way to the dispensary
"IF GRPN can have a quarter like SNAP then all longs will be smiling come next Wednesday evening. Top line revenue growth, at least .07 a share in earning along with a solid outlook for FY 2018. This will be the trifecta. Then if you add 5% user growth, higher revenue per user, higher frequency of return buyers then GPN shareholders will have much to celebrate. Until then we can all live vicariously through SNAP!!!!!!"
rinse and repeat. i should of sold yesterday
"The are Scr3wing small business out of their market with their new ""Payment Terms"" they are now only paying on Voucher USED NOT BOUGHT ... GL EVERYONE with this new model - they will be de-listed in less than a year as thier sales continue to slump into nothingness..."
Will be up 8 to 10 percent this week......GO GRPN!
Told you guys two months ago about GRPN incorporating blockchain in their business model. They take Bitcoin and other crypto currencies for payment for big-ticket vacations etcThis stock will be trading at 10 bucks by the summer.
J thank goodness you have me to talk to ey Doesn’t seem like there’s anyone else giving you some love 
Very likely that this week will be good .
Why isn't there more shareholder pressure for management to merge the compny?
"Groupon still needs help. Earnings forecast, let's see what they do."
Google sees that great potential of Groupon that they wanted to buy at $30 dollars right after the IPO. They knew.
buy buy all you can
Cautiously optimistic today. Though I’ve added just for the outside chance of a beat on the deplorable estimates....roll the dice.

"This was supposed to be their ""bad"" quarter they had a pretty good quarter and now Q4 is coming which is always by far their best quarter. I'm not sure what the shorts are expecting to happen next. At some point they are going to realize that this is no longer a good short candidate. I'm just hoping they cover in the open market and not on some huge after the close institutional trade that doesn't move the stock at all."
After reverse split GRPN Stock is loosing it's value. The existing Directors looking again how to squeeze the money from public
"Groupon should be honored that made it in the ""STRONG SELL"" list....frankly they should be happy that's as low as it goes and they're not on the the ""STRONG STRONG STRONG SELL"" list.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-sell-stocks-june-18th-130701299.html"

GRPN reached a new 52 Week Low at 3.85
"Brad and .007 have a shrinks appt at noon, what will they say when they get back...Bankruptcy??"
New investors just can't comprehend an earnings report.
Which way are we heading!! The crystal ball says up!!
Bad #s at the close...guaranteed!!! Leaked. Enjoy!!
Wow wow 32 million share already trade what’s going on

Imagine having a life as pitifully bad as Barry’s to come to a yahoo finance stock that he ‘has no interest in’ and repeat the same booooring rubbish over and over again. What a life. 2 guesses - Either ex Groupon employee who got the sackOrOrdered himself a new handbag that never arrived.
Sec investigation coming followed by lawsuit.
"Weak spending for restaurants and bars... this will be down more, if they do not get better customers"
Be advised this will be red by the end of the day you're been warned
BABA released their 13F and they continue to own over 33M shares of GRPN as of 12-31-17.
Stock looks to have some legs during this choppy period. Volume is a bit light so we will see how the rest of the day plays out. Usually the buying and selling accelerates as it heads into the midafternoon timeframe.
"Why are all the insiders dumping shares? Five SEC Forms 4 filed in just the last month. In my experience, insiders don't dump shares if they think the future prospects are good, especially if the share price is WAY down...If it's up, taking some money off the table seems reasonable. When it's down, it suggests they anticipate the share price to drop further."
Groupon will probably test the $1.50 mark before slowly creeping up to the $2 range. Perhaps Alibaba takes them over for $3-4 share seeing that shareholders will most likely agree at this point.
Brad you said this was going down $5 today????? Lollll
"Talked to a friend, buy on the street is GRPN,,,,,"

looks like everyone is scared to buy.. shares look cheap. time to make a big position. this is just like oil in 2016 besides no debt. time to load up.
"THIS IS WHAT THEY NEED TO ADVERTISE...Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is the most popular daily deals website across America and worldwide. Offering amazing deals on everything from dining out, to consumer goods and travel deals. They have a loyal customer base of 32.7M in 2017 which grew by 200,000. The adjusted EBITDA for Q4’17 attained $105.3M vs $80.2M Y/Y, a new record for the company."
it will be below $23 tomorrow.
On the sidelines looking to come back in... I think it can fall to $10. Ppl.. due to reclosure and market fears. Thoughts anyone
I wonder how much Groupon CEO makes....
It’s up to 30
the company robs you..... no customer support.... no wonder it's a 2 dollar stock
picked up shares 3.50 will buy more 3.33
this stock will never see 3 or 2 again
this is expansion phase.. then profit taking it will be a short squeeze.. when it is near end of trading i cover me put..
"Just think....we haven't even hit the beginning of the week share price. The past two days, it ran up in expectation of some sort of earnings surprise...When the numbers fully got digested and were revealed to be pretty brutal, the stock tanked today (in spite all the long incessantly pumping it last night). How low it goes it is anyone's guess as we are just now approaching where it was to start the week, before the horrendous state of the company had been revealed. It seems to reason that with this new information in hand, it should settle back down below where it started the week."
"35k shares pre market wow huge volume, must be really bad news. I'm 4.60 as I keep adding on weakness. GLTA"
Gonna go down tomorrow! Don't panic and sell. Keep it and you'll see that it'll go down
Interesting price response to the news. My guess - a lot of people wanted to get out in the 5-6 dollar range. I am not going to buy at this time - my guess is it will have to re-test back into the 4.60 area????
how does this company stay in business they charge to much to merchants just like the credit card companies
JOHN and J not pumping much now ey?
Are people that worried about the lawsuit?
$5 today!
Losing all faith in GRPN.....just hope I can get even on this one.
"Mr Brad and .01, why are you guys cheering for drops in price? thats counter intuitive if you have groupon stocks."
As per my post 2 days ago and the stock traded to 4.49 this am. Let me reiterate. Based on last print GRPN is down 2 cents from the July 9th closing price of 4.83 after the rumor of a deal was announced. Nothing to see here just a deep value stock for patient investors.
"Just imagine if the overall market were tanking how ugly this would be....COVID-19 is surging in numerous, and will be MUCH worse the first and second and week of July due to the protests, so expect the overall market sentiment to shift very negative as reality sets in."
santa rally
These guys are not going to make the numbers in the coming months.
The CEO is doing a great job in leading the turn around for GRPN. GRPN is focusing on improving offerings and sale items. The profits will come in time! #CEO #Aaron Cooper

As usual a strong start. Let’s see if it sputters as the day goes on.
Looks like a few investors are throwing in the towel - maybe a sign of bottoming or did news leak....unlikely since volume is low.

why are there 100 articles on case action and 0 articles on earnings report? lol
"If every holders buy 10 items from groupon every week, their next ER will look much better. Otherwise we may never see this stock go back 6"
"Next support is 4.30, then 3.96. Could be more pain ahead based on the money flow and overall market sentiment."

Piper Jaffray Cos. Upgrades Groupon (GRPN) Neutral -> Overweight
lol its green today. in your face shorts
Someone just dumped 500k shares in what appeared to be a market order. SP dropped .15 cents in less than 1 minute. Why would someone do that? You can easily sell 50K shares every 5 minutes and get a higher share price. It’s obviously someone who is short and/ or owns PUT options.
SHORTS. Time to get out!
bought another 30k at 4.6
JOHN and J refuse to leave the sinking ship 
Today's action is a great indication of how the earnings call will reward longs for holding.
According to the 10Q filing the company has purchased a grand total of 0 shares on the most recent stock repurchase program. Even the company thinks the stock is over valued.
Well not what I expected...... All-in-all not a bad report but in this market? My take - Revs were much higher (very good) but missed by a penny (assuming .09 was the est). The key is what will be said for future earnings in the 10am call. If they upgrade guidance then I am here to stay for awhile.
"Ridiculous sell off, I'm buying morewe gaped down and will cover that gap soon. Just like we covered the up gap. Its all just technical trading no fundamentals to back this kind of foolish selling. Long and going longer!!!!!!!!! This would be a great time for BABA, AMZN , Comcast to buy a great brand and turnaround on the dirt cheap."
Short the hell out of it. Make money. Easy.
"The other day Guillermo found an article on GRPN cashflow. Based on the cashflow Groupon is producing and the estimates for the next quarters GRPN is worth about $80 a share or about $4 a share. Absolutely. We have a lean company in a growth environment: Guillermo believes it is worth every penny of that cashflow, that is $80 a share.Only issue Guillermo sees: attract investors. And I am sure the board is working on that. Once investors realize that it is 40-50% discounted, the price will adjust VERY quickly.Stay greedy with your shares!"
It would be interesting to see if Groupon goods is doing any magic that is helping them to stay in business!
Volume dried up
"I think you are missing the value proposition to a potential buyer, with over 40 million active daily users of Groupon, customer and seller information has value if the acquirer can leverage the data effectively, that is the business model that Amazon, Facebook and Google currently use, data mining companies that cant wait to sell your history! Also, do not overlook the new method that Groupon is using to simplify the use of a voucher to support local business, sing up with your credit card and access the discounts ""WITHOUT"" a traditional paper voucher. They need capital to make the business grow the right way, this will end well for the acquirer at 4 to 6 billion."
"I hope the online ad campaign bears fruit, cause I get blasted with them on youtube."
"Here's some wisdom and guidance for you all from a new yorker, former wall street retiree : When grpn dropped to .50 and $1 in May, were you tempted to buy? Do you think the big players on wall street would have bought at that level? No!! Why? Its no secret that grpn is out of cash, have no strategic business model for survival, fired its last ceo very recently. Its looking for a golden parachute to get a bailout or its going to crash hard. The reverse split was a sign and a very strong message about its short term future. It is signaling that this star has lost all of its fuel and is about to die soon. A reverse split is what struggling companies often do as a last ditch effort to stay afloat before it collapses within itself. Its a legal tatic for the insiders to sell off secretly by using money from new investors or the ones that still hold on to their positions, before the company eventually goes into bankruptcy. All the while the pumpers will fill this board with false messages of hope and false pipe dreams on how this stock will rocket one day, they get paid to this dirty work to prevent existing investors from selling their positions and lure unsuspecting new buyers. Ofcourse the unknowing investors will fail to see these warning signs due to tremendous confusion driven by the pumpers on this board. There will be lot of attacks and downticks on this type of message also. Bottom line is this company has no liquidity, no plan for its future, its a sinking ship that is going to crash down to bankruptcy levels soon. Sell it while you still can at a small loss rather than risking it all by holding onto it. GL."
GRPN is down 5.80% to $3.57
"Josh, doesn't it concern you that GRPN is literally giving away the farm? How do you suspect these types of promos will affect their bottom line. Sure engagement numbers my go up but the margin and profits are severely eroded. Something is wrong at GRPN and it will come out soon enough."
"OMG its down 10 cents now what ? Probably going out of business, oh wait no buyers. Going to 3 dollars sell it quick"
Does anyone here think that GRPN is a buyout candidate? I buy more stuff on Groupon than amazon because they have better deals. I think this company in the right hands could be amazing. They just need more marketing.
"Looking forward to the Superbowl commercial, guess first time in 7 years...."
"Come on GRPN, break through your LOD here and keep collapsing!"
no buyers have showed up.... only sellers..
Brad and .01 in love with Groupon!!
This stock is heading to the 1's. The bag pipes are warming up. Huge downgrade by GS today. I hope those who continue to own shares sell before this security gets pink sheeted.
JOHN and J got a double suite in Vegas. Hitting the penny slots hard. Downing the watered down comped drinks
So one analyst at Goldman causes a 5% drop? GS is probably buying with both fists on this obviously orchestrated hit piece.
Groupon today is the new Groupon.

"wrote 6 tradings ago i was shorting, did so at 5.53, covered today, 4500 shares. Will have a relief rally and am shorting again. Sell on strength, glta"
"Let’s go Groupon,.plz short it back to $15 for me to buy it at cheaper price"
Short interest.is at a multi-year low. Just over 24M shares are short as reported on the 3/11 dissemination date.
Upgrades coming this week!
The MAIN reason Groupon is FAILING is the SALES - they IGNORE small business. There algorithm is written in such a way that it benifits deals that are doing well as opposed to the OTHER way around. You also have a HEAD of SALES who tells his customers that your sales will never be the same as before. WHAT head of sales of a public company would actually tell that to a customer - and they continue down the road to being de-listed
The word on the street is that Groupon had a horrible Christmas season.
Moving on up to the next shelf... 6's here we come and a positive earnings call next week!
Who has a good theory or point based on data as to why grpn rose on a day like today ................. AMC News??? ?????
"short it to 3 , can’t wait to buy more cheap shares"
It’s a dead tech company seriously who still uses groupon nowadays
This company has very bad fundamentals.
I guess we will have to wait for the upgrades. 13 analysts have it at hold or Underperform. Even the ones who have it as a buy will likely raise their price targets for the stock.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://dailystox.xyz). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Look at ZNGA YELP P APRN JUST TO NAME A FEW
Groupon is up 11.24% to 54.44

Poor Puffers Brad and .01 at the Shrinks today

"Someone bought 800k shares at the end of the day. For those that cant count that $1,888,000 @ 2.36"

"So buyout offers come tomorrow?? Ugh. Sorry for the sarcasm. I just want to make money. Call me crazy. Just investing in a company with no debt, tons of cash in the bank and a product that does have traction. You might hate it, but hundreds of millions love it. I don’t know."
Exciting times for Groupon. I can't believe so many still on the sidelines. Throw out all of the #$%$ about why they can't succeed and look at the improvements and vision of a company here to stay. GO GRPN!
buy buy buy
The last 3 days GRPN is down 5.21% and the Nasdaq is only down .87% things will even out eventually. I imagine the shorts thought GRPN was going to miss earnings and/ or revenue (or why would they be short?) The analysts all though they would break even. The bulls thought they would make .01-.03 cents so they pretty much beat everyone’s expectations and raised guidance. I’m not sure what else they need to do for the stock to go up. Hopefully more upgrades in the way.
High volume (~5 million shares) the last 10-15 minutes of trading and ~2 million after hours. Any news?
"Learn how to read charts. Click on a 6mo or 1 year chart. Program trading, algos, HFTs sell into new lows. Look for a bounce at 50% retracement. My cover..."
When will we see $4?????
"GRPN has executed well on profitability. However, for the stock to take off, it needs a way to generate sone excitement. Groupon+ may ultimately do the job, but I was thinking more that the company should work to develop some original content, both on the Goods and Local sides. Netflix would not be where it was if it had not started to develop its own shows. It’s been Netflix’s originals what has generated excitement for them. If Groupon could develop products exclusive to them, the impact might be substantial."
slow and steady
Groupon has no consideration towards their investors ... turning down a 6 billion dollar offer and basically watching this company dwindle to less than half the value is a disgrace. What effort are they actually putting in to build this back up to where it should be ?
