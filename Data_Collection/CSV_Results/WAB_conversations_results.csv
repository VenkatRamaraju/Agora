What’s the deal with the sell off today??
WAB is up 5.21% to 57.60
What are the reasons for this stock down $3.3 or 4.47% today while DJI is up 372 points or 1.49%? Do they try to scare the weak hands so they can buy it cheap before the new company emerges?
upside tomorrow. buy buy
Anybody know the cost basis that is recorded on the shares I received in the spinoff?
I had a whopping 4 shares from the GE sale to WAB. I bought 96 shares in the dip in April. I sold a covered call this month for an $85 strike price. I'll let it go if the call is in the money.
"Oh, forgot to mention, I got 2 shares of WAB, but lost $312.50 yesterday on GE."
"Wabtec is a key player and leader in the rail industry worldwide. I understand the GE integration has created major challenges, but I also believe the GE products give Wabtec more competitive advantages than they had prior to the merger. Still researching the company, but I like the idea of buying industry leaders when they're dealing with short term challenges. That's where I see Wabtec today. Not buying yet, but definitely under consideration in the low $60's. Once the GE integration is wrapped, wouldn't mind seeing WAB bring GBX into the fold as well. There isn't any replacement for rail, so the long term looks great in my opinion."
Westinghouse Air Brake is down 4.95% to 62.37
What happened!?!
"$60 waiting to buy, but not today. may be next week"

Is there any cash in lieu of fractional shares paid?
Great earnings report. Good to see $76 per share. It will go higher.
"Okay, I'm pretty dumb here. Negative news on GE this morning drops GE stock price 13%. So why is WAB down? What is the present day correlation between GE's woes and WAB? I thought that GE had already sold off the WAB stock they received. Is there a connection between the two companies beyond that?"
248 shares of WAB showed up in my account...what are these for?
"Wabtec(WAB) was excited to announce this that it had completed its merger with GE Transportation, immediately following GE Transportation’s spinoff from GE(GE). GE shareholders will see small amounts of Wabtec in their portfolios. The final ratio is a bit lower than what had been estimated. For each share of GE stock owned, shareholders received 0.005371 shares of Wabtec stock, approximately one share of Wabtec stock for every 186 shares of GE stock. Many small shareholders will receive cash in lieu of shares. Shareholders should be aware that this spinoff is taxable. People should ask their tax advisor what this means, but our understanding is that the full amount of the distribution is taxable, but it also reduces the basis on their GE shares by the value received. As mentioned previously, Wabtec has joined the S&P 500."
"Must have been GE selling about 3 million shares of WAB. Started at $77 this morning, ended at $71."
Welcome to the TOXIC GE family.
Good addition for BHI
WAB is down 5.13% to $75.13
"WABTEC is shuttering the wholly owned subsidiary - Motive Power - stating they are moving the operation to Pennsylvania. With low costs of engine refurbishing that was provided in Boise Idaho (in comparison to the GE operation in Pennsylvania) - this is a questionable move at best. This company is scrambling after the GE merger (transportation component) and utilizing cannibalization techniques (first indication of trouble) in order to ""keep up appearances"" to investors. ""Danger Will Robinson""..."

WAB is up 7.26% to 47.26
Rafael Santana served as president and CEO of GE Transportation and is now president and CEO of Wabtec’s Freight segment. Is there a connection with GE's horrible numbers and this guy. Im starting to think so especially with what you have pointed out @Gator.
Westinghouse Air Brake is up 8.79% to 56.96
"One other thing regarding union leaders. They do not want lower paying jobs for former employees and new employees due to the lower income from these employees to the unions pockets. Stay on strike they may say, but in the long run it's union dues.As I said earlier, the job loses at the container company, Ford plant and the local GE plant never recovered and many hundreds of jobs were gone forever. No one saw the trees beyond the forest and these employees lost much, much more in the long term."

I'm trying to help a few family members--How can I determine the cost basis of the spin-off non-covered $WAB shares my relatives received from GE on February 25th? How do they find the share price of WAB when they took possession?

"Am just reading about WABTEC, learning about the GE TRANS sale/merger? I have been offered to sell my less than 100 shares for a $7/share processing fee! Sounds a bit much to me. Also doesn’t sound beneficial to any stockholders with under 100 shares. Can anyone enlighten me to why the company is doing this?"
OK Ok So what is the problem with this company? Am I missing something from the past? I only got into this from the Ge spin off and decided to watch and see what it does after. Future looks great for increased revenue so what is the problem?Bad taste from the past or management?
Westinghouse Air Brake reached a 52 Week low at 56.90

Strong growth ahead that can streamline operations. Smaller company can execute much faster with cheap GE subsidiary purchase

Wonder if Wab has looked into relationship with CalAmp (camp) and their strengths in the transportation field hmm?

"We are reaching a 3 year low for WAB with a top range of 113 and nominal price from the high 70’s to low 80’s. This is prior to the GE acquisition. Pressure on the stock is due to a second round of negotiations with the union and some risk as GE may need proceeds from WAB stock to continue operations. On 6/3 a strike may occur if agreements with the Union are not made. The drop in stock price reflects this event and once the trade deal is set I would expect a 2-3% rise in share price. WAB last quarter was strong, but its too early to tell how long it will take WAB to gain efficiencies of the combined companies. GE transportation was a customer of WAB and there are saving to be expected and redundancies to shave cost. Long term and at these levels WAB is a good buy. Technology in Rail have lagged other areas of transportation such as autonomy but eventually this will have to change and WAB is the leader in train control with products like PTC."

"Shutdown the ECN, it’s unfair"
So does anyone know why this stock is acting like a dog?
Looks like WAB is somehow still linked w GE formally or informally AND GE will continue to sell WAB stock as needed to raise cash and avoid Bankruptcy. The GE insurance arm is a 10 yr black hole that simply can’t be fixed. I fell into that trap when I sold GE and bought WAB
is this worth keeping ?

OUCH! Has this merger overweighted this company. Looks like it's taking on water and sinking fast. We're going to need some life rafts and boats soon. We're hearing a lot of negative feedback concerning the GE spinoff. How much will this new firm impact earnings? We can't find any good answers.
"come on, you GE bagholders keep selling your bits and pieces. GE will have to sell their chunk. Get this stock price lower."

Large insider purchase yesterday 05/13/20. Someone has confidence in their company.
wabtec just gave us our xmas bonuses and I kidd you not it was umbrellas. Not just any umbrella but a top of line Chinese import.
So there is a great effort to keep this share price down for some reason.

"BS... This decline is controlled by the more than 90% holdings by WAB itself. They're going after the small investors that paid into the stock. It's so obviously unnatural price movement, I'm surprised we don't start an SEC investigation... As soon as they get more control of the stock by killing the small investors, then the price will spike as usual... Sounds fraudulent to make it go to record lows..."

"I agree 100% regarding top management's pay being very high. I only hope it's tied to performance. If it is then I'm fine with that.I do have a concern regarding strikes. When I left the service and had no job my brother talked me into his job with a roofing company. It was a union shop, paying dues.I never had to work getting dirty but I did. A job is a job while living with my spouse's parents. I had a union card for roofing and sheet metal. In my town the Ford plant, a container plant and GE was on strike. As i went to work daily the workers would be getting warm next to a 55 gallon container keeping warm for over 16 months without pay.The container company closed, then the Ford plant next and finally the GE plant. All due to workers demanding a pay raise during a recession. It was bad timing on their part. Then came our company demanding higher hourly wages. I was happy just to have a damn job to pay my bills. No, I decided along with my brother, to continue working during our strike. I don't regret for a minute crossing lines to keep the company, with it's obligations to complete projects, on time. My dad was a loyal union electrical member all his life. He could work side jobs due to his expertise while on strike.My bottom line is, you have to choose what is right for your families well being. You can stand with your signs and burn wood when it's cold in that 55 gallon metal container. But in the end the company closes shop or moves to another location.The roofing company I worked for, after 75 years of business, folded. End of story"
"Just check my account, I have exactly 1 share of WAB! YEEEE....HAAA!!"

Too much upside. From here pe. Dividends and growth
"the stock is the best buy on the board, after the GE deal a double or more"
"FROM ORIGINAL AGREEMENTUnder the agreement, which has been approved by the Boards of Directors of Wabtec and GE, GE will receive $2.9 billion in cash at closing and GE and its shareholders will receive a 50.1% ownership interest in the combined company, with Wabtec shareholders retaining 49.9% of the combined company. The transaction is expected to be tax free to the companies' respective shareholders."
Major foreign earnings. Have to think strength of the dollar wil have some negative on reported numbers.
I swear it's almost impossible to get new info on anything I own. Nobody is even talking on here. Would be nice to know how things are going.
WAB is down 5.09% to 56.92
drop to $60? that's the bottom
"Earnings a couple weeks back took WAB to the high-$70's. GE then announced they were selling their shares for $72.50. The stock now trades at $67 or a 14-15% decline. Nothing has changed for WAB since earnings except this GE stock sale. Doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's the market sometimes. Just have to decide if this is the new reality or is this in fact an opportunity."
"this is already in the sauce, this analyst is a moron firstly but a charlatan. buy at 66.40"
Looks like a short squeeze this morning! Ouch.
"$35 an hour is $70,000 a year, plus benefits, plus overtime results in real cost of over $120,000 per labor employee. That's way too high for a factory worker. $22 an hour is in line with the rest of the world. The union is way out of line on this one and their workforce is going to find itself out of work. I dont blame management for standing firm on this one. Another golden goose killed by unions."
What’s going on pre market? 4% down.

This is the ONLY company I can find that's working on a battery powered locomotives (if anyone knows of others let me know)..... The time has come to merge the most efficient form of ground transportation on earth with most efficient form of energy on earth!! I've seen that many North American railways (I own shares in 2 of them) are promoting their goals in reduction of Co2!!!! There isn't a better or more visible way to do this than adding a few electrified/hybrid consists into their operations!!!
Is it down because the new locomotive factory they just bought went on strike Tuesday?
