Recent headlines and conversations for TGT
Well I’m glad i covered my short early this morning for minimal profit. Bears that are stuck in here are in trouble by the looks of the chart
"Target has a rolling pattern. After 7% fall from its peak, it rises 20%"
"Oh, by the way: every single Democratic Representative in the US House of Representatives just voted to make it MANDATORY that public schools allow any boy or man who claims to ""feel like a woman today"" be given free access to the ladies locker rooms, showers, and bathrooms in the PUBLIC SCHOOLS that your daughters are FORCED, BY LAW, to attend. Is this what you voted for?"
"Doctor, in your medical opinion - are you more of a weasel and less of a human? I mean medically speaking.. what's going on here?"
And look at it now. Terrible buy from me.
"For shorts only....Today is the perfect storm if you act immediately after the open and before Powell's speech a half hour after the market opens. short tgt, hd and low all of which have increased considerably over what is reasonable. close out the shorts 15 minutes after he starts is speech as he will do some backpedaling after starting out as a hawk."
74.00 closing bell Friday imo. let's see if I'm right
a close above 77 and change brings in the charts guys. 80 80 80 short term
"""the company’s revenue grew just marginally and its earnings declined 6% y-o-y in the period. Factors such as higher employee wages, free delivery, and promotional activity continue to be a drag on Target’s bottom line. In addition, the retailer also expects to see continued pressure on its EBIT due to ongoing investments in both digital and physical stores going forward. In fact, the company has provided a disappointing outlook for the holiday season for the same reason. Our estimates for the company’s valuation assume a slight decline in Target’s revenue per square feet and gross profit margin levels going forward."" (Forbes)Gee is this bad news? ""Decline"" anyone else see dat dar word? $59.00 valuation stated by analyst, was he incorrect or misinformed? LOLBut hey, keep up the loyalty! Amazon buying this dump? Don't count on it! Amazon already has a grocer, don't need two."
Congratulations to long term TGT investors!!!
"Wow, huge day and no one talking about it (except for spammers throwing c r@p on the board and they get muted)"
Heading to 100. Quick 10 percent gain.
Haven't read anything about the Bathroom policy this morning....LOL
"In other news today, the FBI scandal is blowing up. Turns out that Obama's FBI not only did not prosecute a high crime, they actually participated in covering it up and immunizing the criminals from prosecution. Comey, McCabe, Mueller, Lynch, Clinton, the DOJ, God knows who else is involved. Jail time coming for these people if there is any justice left in America."
Another 52 week low for Target today. Let the deathwatch for Brian Cornell and his merry band of social justice warriors begin.
"Note to myself: RegressiveLiarPantShyter (not name calling) no longer believes that there is an ""active boycott"" in Target. He has finally given up on AFA,"
"If TGT is so proud of its policy of letting men into ladies' rooms, why don't they inform their customers of this policy using store signage? TGT is lying to its customers every day."
"Gonna be a rough day. Nothing to do with the business structure, but everything to do with global uncertainty. Hopefully this blows over... but if futures stay down for a while, it may be a good time to add!"
"Dozens of sex offenders, permitted in Target ladies' rooms by Target corporate policy, have been arrested in the last two years, when Target's dangerous bathroom policy were put into effect. Very few at other stores. The evidence is clear: Target's policies have led to an sharp increase in sexual assaults in their stores. Thus, the store chain is subject to a 1.5 million strong boycott of former customers, including myself and my family. Target's stock continues to languish since then as well, despite a record bull market. Save your money, folks, until TGT management is fired and replaced by people who respect womens' rights."
I buy almost everything on Amazon these days. I can shop there wiyhout worrying about my childrens safety. Plus its better for the environment.
"oops forgot the link, hee heeFederal Communications Commission repeals net neutrality ruleshttps://www.yahoo.com/newsroom/vibes/technology/federal-communications-commission-set-reverse-596z0zx"
"No, Sarah, index funds don't deliver anywhere near 17% CAGR for 10 years in a row."
"lol this stock played me today, hard, real hard."
Wow so you're up a whole quarter. Congratulations!
"The focus on trans-gender bathrooms, promoting other holidays while marginalizing Christmas and Easter in their stores and any other anti-American cause they can cling to has cost Target over $16,000,000,000. Yes, 16 billions dollars. The value of the company is now down 40% from it's recent highs. Pathetic when companies like Target, Starbucks and Nordstrom focus on some ridiculous, leftist, political cause and alienate a majority of their customers (most of which are now gone forever) instead of focusing on the company and shareholder value. Nice job guys."
Huge options movement seeing Target above 75 / 77 by March. Strong BUY!
"Sarah's still talking about the so-called ""boycott"". Sad."
https://www.businessinsider.com/target-workers-say-backrooms-are-unsafe-because-of-shift-cuts-2019-9
"In my opinion, this is a great time to start a position, or add to an existing position."
C'mon Target... Let's have a  Claus rally 2019!
Could we see $90 tomorrow? I think we could. Things are looking pretty good after hours.
"time and price doesn't equate gain/loss, dumdum. Just answer the question. Links not required.So what you're saying is that you sold tgt already and no longer hold it? or you never bought it, right Ferengi Tranny Quarky?"
"Thank God I sold my 100,000 shares at yesterday's high and then when short at the same time!"
thx for the discount everyone
Target is due for a major correction soon. I see it at $115. within days. To much hype and seriously overbought.
20 targets looted tonight. Time to get out of this stock!
"Isn't it ""interesting"" that people who have spent at least three years on this board promoting the views of a designated hate group also think that they hold moral high-ground on ""the rights of women""."
I wish this stock would drop faster. Those who are enabling sexual exploitation of children should face some consequences.
Double top!!No follow through!!Take profit!!Thank me later!!
"Regressive, you won."
Well I see our friends at Yahoo! are busy censoring politically incorrect opinions again. Typical liberal behavior.

Peace out shorties! =)
Where are all the losers yapping about bathrooms and Amazon now? TGT for the win!
Would an Amazon purchase of Target make sense ?
it will be above 100 hundred by the end of today! congrats everyone 
"Like I said I would, I started replacing my shares in tgt. Bought small amount at $172 and change. Just very unusually high volatility since the earnings. Back on the long side riding some free shares off the profits. Best of luck to all. Personally based on current market, think wmt and tgt both a little oversold."
"""splc is much more widely respected organization....."" says the deluded Farty...LOL.https://reason.com/2018/06/18/southern-poverty-law-center-nawaz"
"I know that if I was a woman and I found footage of myself undressing in a Target ladies' room posted on a porn website, I would find myself a good lawyer and sue the pants off Target for their dangerous policies."
DA WINNER
it takes a few days to weed out all the profit takers. next stop $90
"Oh yes, Anon - my other account. In Dr PantCrapper's medical opinion, it is very unusual to not be a bigot. So there can't be more than one non-bigot in this message board. Surely not. Dr PantCrapper, what do you suggest I do so as to become a board certified bigot like you?"
Amazon interested in buying target is that right?
Monstrous gap to close if ER misses.
"It's almost like the pv55y grabber is _trying_ to torpedo the whole economy just so that the wheels will be set in motion for him to be fired from this job that he hates so much after November. TGT is still holding up pretty well, though!"
I feel that it may settle a bit more before going up to $90+ in the next few weeks. Target is priced much better than Walmart. Retail is a very challenging group. I’m straddling on the options and also a truckload of the stock

"DOWNNNNNNNNNN WE GOOO SEE YOU AT $145 before close ,,told you so its a MEGA PROMOTED FRAUD"
"Tough enough to be in retail, but when you're in retail and you play very hot emotional politics with your majority base, you commit suicide. Predict this stock is going to drop way more than it does today, way more. If you own this now ""pig"" you will probably be doing good if you get out in the $50s, IHO."
"RegressiveLiar 20 weeks ago: ""See you all in the $40's next week :-)"" https://i.imgur.com/izUZf77.pngTGT was nowhere near ""40's"" 20 weeks ago.RegressiveLiar today: ""At least my predictions are accurate."" Yeah, sounds about right."
"TGT is rocking today!!! UP, UP, AND AWAY!!!"
TGT will print $135 tomorrow at 7:30 amI am all in .Did you see Walmart?
"Yep, the stock market keeps soaring, thanks to the tax bill and improved consumer confidence under President Donald Trump, who is making America great again, and dragging the liberals kicking and screaming every inch of the way!"
Target won’t get hurt the American consumer will who will be paying higher prices. Target will just pass thru the rise in cost to consumers. This is how it works. Company is great not their fault
"Excellent move by Target, getting a lucrative spot near a large university campus. A way to capture lots of young future professionals who are building brand loyalty. https://www.jconline.com/story/opinion/columnists/dave-bangert/2018/07/24/bangert-farewell-wls-plywood-city-target-near-purdue-up-next/828915002/"
boycott gender deficient target.... until they fix it.
"Another nail in the retail grocery concept coming. As if endangering your customers with insane violations of privacy isn't enough, now companies like Target are going to have to deal with Muslim terrorists poisoning food in supermarkets. http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-09-05/isis-urges-supporters-poison-food-us-grocery-stores"
Looking tired. Market heading up but TGT flat today.
"Folks the stock market could easily do a 4k retrace without compromising the bull market pattern. Trump's election is hugely bullish for America and American business, just as Chairman Obozo's election signaled 8 years of stagnation. Learn the megatrends and you won't go wrong. Wait til the blood is running in the streets, then start buying."
"Uhm Ivanka’s fashion “line” like most of Agent Orange’s businesses went bankrupt. The one and only thing DT has ANY expertise in - bankruptcy, in all things!"
tgt = welcome to my watch list...clipped a 5% gain on dltr on mirror post earnings drop...thoughts? #blackfriday
Today's philosophical question: can a boycott of Target be dead if it never really existed in the first place?
"Longs...let the TGT market maker pump this up letting it run then take profits at $110+ levels. People will not buy anymore at these levels until a pull back or correction occurs (plus no incentive now since dividend already paid and earnings over), but take advantage of the Technicals (bullish uptrend)."
Any chance of a split this year?
Target says the outage wont effect earnings. First comes profit taking next comes panic selling. Down market already let's see if we hold at 86 give hope for them 90 calls. I'm looking at 85 today and sit on my puts
"At least books will never be banned from being sold at Target, since those are in no danger of being stolen by the “usual suspects”."
Where are all the little AMZN fanboys now? TGT>Amazon. I told you TGT had staying power.
"Some investors will be holding the bag pretty soon from TGT ,While the big boys will be dancing the BBBBOOOOYYYYAAAA, head up boy 's , boogee man always around to empty your pocket"
"seriously, that they brought online sales back to 28% maybe the price could double or at least go back to the previous highdouble makes sense if they do it again and again, I mean 25% or so online growththey just need new color for their store, or hand out tinted glasses at the door"
Target should hire Bruce Jenner as their spoke person and bring out a Tran- Gen line of clothing
"As a man, I tried to use the dressing rooms in the men's department at my local Target and found them to be closed. A sign directed me to those in the Ladies' Department.Whoever runs this company is sick and perverted."
LOs boycott is making me rich. Keep up the good work sahra
Target is primarily a low margin grocery store with 60 percent of all revenues from food. They earn pennies per dollar sold. Consistent sales but little to no growth boring and way overpriced
Ez buy order congrats to all that have fuel to burn.
Sorry fellow longs. I had to sell that gamble I took yesterday. This just WILL NOT HOLD. PROFIT TAKING will hammer this. I got my $100.95 and shorted it. I'll cover at $90 and see what we have then
"I switched from TGT puts to calls right at the close Friday. First of all, TGT held up rather well in the selloff happening in the market, secondly,. S&P has bounced off this level twice so far this month, and I think there’s a better than 50/50 chance it will again, if only for some bargain hunting Monday. Then again, it could go even lower, So I only put 1/3 of my cash from the puts into the calls and rest in cash. I continue to maintain a few chosen Puts that should go down regardless of what trump says to hedge the volatility."
Its not just TGT. They been hitting WMT also. No reports of any BIG stores getting hit. BIG beat earning by 200% on friday. Short TGT and long BIG seems like a nice monthly play
"Why would ANYONE invest in Wal-mart, Amazon, Tesla or worse FB instead of TGT? This will blow them all away over the next year."
"Hi New to this but living fFort Myers, Fl. The store that I frequent they can’t get out of their own way. Sale pricing is sometimes a problem signage is wrong. Also they put coolers and grills on sale in the fall. I guess all knowledge and instructions come from the north which btw I am originally from. Yes, I come from a retail background."
"might load calls on this, target should beat earnings"
Trending negative. Watch for $68.23. Stay clear of this stock. For those who shorted after transgender controversy congrats. Stock is down from $84.14. Female shoppers staying away. School return sale items are disappointing. Food sales are dismal. Analyst suggestion: SELL
"Just wanted to reiterate that this ""discussion"" board continues to be a real hoot! ;)"
Everyone headed to Target to pile up on resources. Panic is good for target who has only US stores....non in China....BUYING TRUCK LOADS
In today for my first 100 share buy at $89.42. Great things ahead. GLTA :)
Target won’t last once amazon realizes they need more brick and mortar to survive.
"With a PE of 17+, this stock is relatively dirt cheap compared to its peers. WMT has a PE of 25+."
Be sure you are Boycotting Amazon for the health of American retail. We need stores to survive and we need those jobs.

Looks like 45 is giving everyone a pvssygrab for Xmas. That’ll teach y’all to start saying “Merry Christmas” again!
"hey bulls, why you letting me down on this? lol. we will be fine."
Does a 5% drop in margin mean that it is almost negative now? I don’t get it.
"Sarah: You actually ""call 'transgenders' more prone to child molesting than anyone else"" every single day. You also refer to them as ""mentally ill"" multiple times each day."
"As the month of October rolls on, some consider it a pretty scary time - especially at Target, where a frightening restroom and fitting room policy continues to put women and children at risk.Since the spring, AFA has been encouraging shoppers to #BoycottTarget after the retailer publicized its dangerous and controversial restroom and fitting room policy - one that alienated families, along with more than 1.4 million shoppers who have signed the pledge. And since the boycott began, the news has not been good for Target, especially after the corporation announced dismal second-quarter earnings. Likewise, Target stock has dropped to 68.41, a decrease of more than 18 percent since April 19, when the stock closed at 83.98.While the American Family Association and our values are in line with celebrating harvest-style festivals rather than Halloween, we realize that many American shoppers will be spending a great deal of money this month on decorating, party and treat items.The one-million mark for the #BoycottTarget signatures was significant, and Target took note but did nothing to protect women and girls in their restrooms and fitting rooms. Now, AFA is encouraging those who haven't yet signed the pledge so we can reach 1.5 million - and perhaps Target will finally respond to these growing numbers since their revenues and foot traffic have declined nationwide.As we have stated many times, our worries do not stem from fear of the transgender community, but rather, from both the real and potential threat that predators and voyeurs, or anyone with evil intentions, would take advantage of the Target bathroom policy to harm women and children - and we have plenty of incidents to show that they have.In a recent Action Alert to its more than one million friends and supporters, AFA outlined just 10 examples that show why Target should immediately rescind its dangerous policy and keep men out of women's bathrooms and dressing rooms.As frightening incidents at Target stores continue, AFA is asking shoppers to take action in several ways this month: Sign the #BoycottTarget pledge. Encourage family and friends to sign the pledge, too, as boycott numbers climb to 1.5 million. Voice your concerns on Target's Facebook page. Call Target to politely let its executives know you’ve signed the #BoycottTarget pledge - Guest Relations, (800) 440-0680, option 1, then 1 again. Share the boycott information on social media and be sure to use #BoycottTarget. Visit afa.net/target for more tools and information on the #BoycottTarget initiative."

"I guess there's a buyout rumor, Amazon may use their pocket change to buy out Target just to get rid of them."
target had positive earnings due to the 600.00 stimulus last 4 months. let's see how they do without it. that 600.00 stimulus accounted for 25 billion in consumer spending weekly.
"Sarha/Sean/Local Perv is going to have a rough day. Time to grab the popcorn, sit back and watch the insane rantings of the bigot who doesn't know he's lost. Don't worry, sarha/Sean/Local Perv, once your dementia kicks fully in (any day now), you can imagine it's the 1950s all over again, when your kind was a majority."
Kudos to Target for getting past the issues of a few years back. I used to spend a ton there and have not shopped there in probably 4 years now. They obviously do not need my money shopping there.
"I ""dig"" in your comments to screenshot the things you have said here, what you say somewhere else is not my concern. To be honest, your Target bathroom or anti-gay commentary doesn't interest me anymore. I shorted SNAP from 11.97 to 11.59.. obviously I shorted too late and covered too soon. As for your question, given my understanding of SNAP, I wouldn't recommend buying it as a long term investment but it should see a short term pop soon. The reason I covered at 11.59 is because I thought SNAP would see that pop now.. but it never happened."
Target back to the 50's soon. I'll bet Brian Cornell wishes he had those millions of boycotting shoppers back. Maybe Amazon will buy Target and convert their stores into FBA warehouses. That makes more sense than letting men into ladies' rooms I think.
"If there was any doubt, there should be no more. The boycott is alive and well"
Target reached an all time high at 133.25
"too many people dead in this covid 19 disaster,and too many women quit have baby, I think American don't have enough people to support retail sales growth,so TGT and WMT will crash,because they sell regular things,"
What good are analysts if they can’t get close the numbers?
How is that policy of inviting men into ladies' rooms working out for ya Target?
Note: Targets two day shipping is when they ship not when you place the order. it may take them 2-3 days to get the it ready to ship then 2 days to get.

"Hey ped0ph1le, how am I doing on this trade from today? Calculate and get back to me -- https://i.imgur.com/3jeXrpE.png"
"If anyone doubts the fact that the de facto policy at Target is to allow any and all men into their ladies rooms, no questions asked, there are plenty of videos documenting this on youtube. Just ask, and I'll show give you plenty of links to them. Yes, I know that the Nut Job will claim these are all categorically faked, but that's what schizophrenics do -- deny plain reality in favor of some fantasy world."
WMT is fairly valued at a pe of almost 27 that's why you saw the pop after earnings to an irrationally exuberant $124 range and now back under $120. Costco as well probably the top retail dog out there but is priced to perfection at a pe of 36. TGT is a bargain at less than a 19 pe. TGT is also executing as well as WMT or better. TGT is growing it's year over #'s and is a pleasure to shop at without that warehouse feel. So projecting an eps of $7 and a very conservative pe of 20 takes us to $140 so a lot of stock appreciation to look forward to.
"Great job trump , economy is doing so well"
"Quotable quotes from Dr PantCrapper:- When TGT was at ~54, ""See you all in the $40's next week :-)"" -- Never happened. When TGT was at ~60, ""This stock will plummet back to the low $50's"" -- Also never happened. When TGT was $70.xx, ""TGT is in the 60's"" -- Lol, nope. RegressiveLiar today, ""At least my predictions are accurate."" LMAO, SOUNDS GOOD!"
"Congrats everyone! Made money going up, now it's time to make it going down. Be smart and play both sides. This is such a great play!"
Well.... shorting TGT is a strategy that has worked.... IF you shorted because of the transgender bathroom policy you made some good money...Thats just the FACTS....Continuing to be short TGT appears to remain a good strategy.... whether you do it because of the bathrooms or other reasons....However its foolish for TGT to have offended so many to placate such a small special interest group such as transgendered
WARNING  CITI Analyst is a Criminal. Check out his pumping history on PCG - PUMPED A $33Target. It crashed and now he says $4With a strong Sell. They just shorted it when it couldn't get past $24 resistance. Check it out but don't fall for this $130 target.
The handle on this cup-n-handle chart pattern is in tact to keep climbing higher. Plus the TGT market maker will achieve capitulation from the shorts causing the stock to rise further from another short squeeze. This week should be all up. May see a small pullback next week for a buying opportunity.
Keep up the good work. We will win
"Hey any of you perverts care if it was YOUR wife or daughter or sister who was filmed by that pervert ""transgender woman"" in Idaho? According to the police, he had been filming women for quite some time in Target dressing rooms. Not that he was fooling anyone in the dress and wig he wore. But does it ever occur to you that the films he took of women undressing were most likely downloaded to his computer, from whence they quite llikely were distributed across the internet? This is hardly the first time a pervert has been caught in a ""unisex"" restroom (or shower) filming girls. But you don't really care about that, now do you? Because your ideology is most important to you - not the privacy rights, or safety, of women and children in public spaces.And now we have the CEO of a major company, Target, inviting these perverts in to dressing rooms and rest rooms with women of all ages.You people are sick."
"379,000 jobs created , wow, and some want to drive stocks down"
"Interesting fact: AFA boycotted Disney for 9 years, from 1996 to 2005. Then they just gave up and called off the boycott. No one gave them an inch and no one cared."
I don't know why anyone is worried about Target. Target will be the best retail to be in the next five years at least. Wal-mart is a hunk of junk and Amazon will lose market share. Target is a winner.
Looks like there will be a Short Squeeze today from new $5B Stock Buy Back News! Stock is on its way to a $120 target by EOY and then $130 in 2020.
"sell TGTTarget: 'Easier Said Than Done'To fend off Amazon.com Inc. (AMZNAMZNAmazon.com Inc1,570.28-0.15% ), Target has acquired same-day delivery service Shipt for $550 million. Reeves warns, ""Same-day shipping is much easier said than done, particularly when you've atomized your inventory across stores instead of a centralized fulfillment center."" Meanwhile, he says that the consensus among analysts is for sales to be flat in 2018, and maybe increase by a mere 2% in 2019.The stock reached its 52-week high on Jan. 22, based on a report of strong holiday sales to close out 2017. Then it went down in the correction, and essentially has gone sideways since.

"Interesting... we could see Target hitting $130 after Xmas, like at the end of December if not sooner. Very a exciting and breathtaking experience!"
"""Wal-Mart earnings beat expectations, sales climb, guidance raised, shares jump""! - Hmmm this doesn't fit with the pack of excuses TGT has been dishing out."
I agree Artie with you on this one Artie. I wonder why that is?
Shoulda shown respect for theur customers
buy buy buy....nice price...
"After the SEC put Target on notice that they will not be accepting any more fudged earnings reports, management had to do something big in order to excuse the yuuuuge drop in earnings they must report next time. I'll say one thing for Cornell and Co, they sure know how to cover their butts."
"Like I said, I'd rather have my daughter walk in a TGT restroom than walk across a Walmart parking lot. Walmart is chock full of drug addled, scroungy, purple haired nosering tatooed freaks, obese waddling missing teeth single moms, chromosome deficient derilict children, 3rd world stowaways, and all type of societal effluent. That's just the lot- the store is worse. You can pick up a disease just shopping at WMT, and the low IQ clientele is contagious.Thank God for TGT, makes shopping enjoyable."
i am not surprised cuz i made 500$ from tgt in the last year and a half

"up almost 5% after hours. Looking good so far. We should reach 90 if not today, this week."
Nice gain here but can it hold - will sell my calls as soon as market opens and will switch to puts $FDX - no sign of 2T to 3T stimulus free money to keep ordering $AMZN $WMT $TGT $KR parcels using $FDX $UPS anymore.. average people will drag their s to dollar generals and aldis for 2 year or so - GLTA

"Notice how BigK keeps repeating the same lies and evasions and illogical stances - ""all stores have the same policy at Target"" (lie) or ""people will get assaulted by perverts whether we make it easier for them or not, so let's make it easier for political reasons"" (non-sequitur) or ""anyone who doesn't think men should be let into ladies rooms is a bigot"" (ad hominem).Always the same lies, disguising a contempt for the rights of others and a stunning hypocrisy. LIberals are immoral, filthy people."
Nice same store sales growth and 30% growth in online sales are good signs
"More of the same, all this bathroom talk. 90% of the people walking down the street or going to Target have no clue what you are even talking about. Just go ask any housewife that shops at TGT about that bathroom stuff, they will look at you dumbfounded. Get over it already."
When giants like $INTC goes down they go down and will take time to bounce.. let it go for now - few downgrades will bring to 40s low may be and then ride back if positive forecasts available.. save money live better $WMT $COST $TGT may go up with inflation- GLTA

"There's no way I'm stopping at a Mad Max landscape looking Walmart parking lot and sifting through the minefield of scroungy miscreants and mess to the hinterland of the store to save 10 cents on a gallon of milk. It's actually cheaper at Target using my 5% discount Red Card, but of course credit is something most Walmart wastrels will never know. Thank God for Target, they make shopping a pleasant experience."

"Boycott continues to destroy Target. Congratulations to all who participated! Womens' rights matter! People with pen1ses are not women, no matter what the insane LGBT community says."
"Funny how the majority of Christians had the ""Put Christ Back In Christmas"" campaigns during the 80's and 90's. seems the majority of retailers no longer put ""x"" in Christmas or Christians anymore."
"Hey Nut Job, I need a little amusement, so let's see how you answer this question. If Target's de facto policy is not to let any and all men into their ladies' rooms, can you tell me what their screening process is to keep out child molestors, perverts, and voyeurs? This should be good."

Just another day for the escaped Jim Jones cult member known as the NUT JOB."
Just wondering...how many of you Robinhooders used your student loan money to buy this $75 stock for $165?
nice beat! but withdrawin guidance might hurt the stock
"If 62 support breaks, then 59, then 51 (I might buy some at 51)"
"Another day, and Target is still allowing any man who demands it, including sex offenders, into ladies' rooms with their female customers and their daughters. Target does NOT warn its customers about their policy using store signage. Target shows stunning contempt for the privacy rights, beliefs, and safety of their female customers, and there is an active boycott by millions of former customers at a time when Amazon is swallowing up the entire retail space. TGT has nowhere to go but down."
"Funny how Sarah looks 10x as hard for stories about pervs in the Target restrooms and then finds that it ""doesn't happen nearly as much at Wal*Mart"". Sarah needs to learn a little bit about ""confirmation bias"". Then s/he'll probably start seeing it EVERYWHERE! ;)"
incredible bearish market right now. whiffs of 2007/2008
tgt has 2 big gaps -- could we see a retracement to about $115 to $119 --buffet said al companies fill there gap up or down---tgt up 91% look for a retracement
"It just....keeps....happening...at....Target....maybe you shouldn't be letting men into ladies rooms, Mr. Cornell?Dover Man’s Arrest for Sex Act in Fitting Room Leads to Drug Charges 1-25-2019Posted on January 25, 2019 by Dover Police DepartmentIncident/Complaint#: 50-19-2366Date/Time: January 19th, 2019 and January 24th, 2019 Location: Target, 148 John Hunn Brown Rd/Unit Block of Stevenson Drive, Dover, DEOfficer Releasing Information: M/Cpl. Mark Hoffman, Public Information OfficerNarrative: The Dover Police Department responded to Target on Thursday, January 24th at approximately 9:15AM for a report of a man mastbating in a fitting room with the door open. The department had also responded to the same location on Saturday, January 19th, when the male suspect had committed the same act in a fitting room with the door open and fled in a gold Jaguar after leaving the store. Based on surveillance footage from Saturday’s incident, officers believed the suspect to be Lewis Foreman (23). Foreman once again fled the store in a gold Jaguar prior to police arrival. Believing Foreman was the suspect, officers checked the area of the Manchester Square neighborhood, where it was believed Foreman was staying in the Unit Block of Stevenson Drive."
"Hmm...TGT down over 4 percent, WMT down 2. I wonder which is the stronger stock. Maybe Ark can tell me. Hey Ark, which stock is stronger, TGT or WMT?"
Why is Target in a free fall? I think chart is broken headed to $50's
Jan $72 Calls anyone? - If this is due to all retail getting hammered .. should pop back in a few days ...
"TGT just announced a $5 billion dollar buyback, Do people realize this is almost 10% of their $55 billion dollar market cap. Of course it will go higher, TGT mgmt. has confidence in themselves."
RWNJs are easily coerced into traps.
"Very nice report today from Target and pop is well deserved. Suspecting a lot of people are shorting it now, so if your long, I would hold and not sell until $107-$110 range since the TGT market maker will be intentionally pushing stock price up higher now to capitulate the shorts before a downturn."
"Looking forward to next earnings report and their forward guidance. My Target is almost always crowded and the store is very clean. Knowledgeable and helpful staff, great deals throughout the store. Christmas season numbers were great so I’m optimistic the quarterly numbers will be as well. Dividend ex date is coming up so a nice little rally up to that would be nice too."
"To you bubblers: no bubble...fundamentals....the pandemic,while unfortunate in nature,has created the Amazon effect to places like Target, and others, and the FedEx and UPS and postal groups...and on and on....this is going to keep going...up up and away! GLTA"
"Ark, in answer to your question, as I have written many times, Target Corporation has many good things going for it. The merchandise is good, the stores are clean, etc. But Target Corp is going to have a tough time competing with Amazon and Walmart. And crucially, Target Corporation management appears to be fundamentally broken, since they have forgotten the fundamental rule of retail: respect your customers. It's hard to think of a more fundamental display of contempt for the rights, beliefs, and safety of your female customers than to force them to share ladies' rooms with sex offenders, perverts, voyeurs, and mentally ill men, all to appease a politically powerful homosexual and pervert lobby. So Target is a bad investment."
normally this would be a good buying opportunity but with all the geopolitical uncertainties going on and a good chance we retest the Dec. lows I think it's best to hold off.
"By the way, when one worships the state rather than God, it never ends well, not for individuals, and not for any society."
"Sadly, Target Corp shareholders will suffer since its management has decided to put homosexual zealotry ahead of business considerations, not to mention the privacy concerns of its customers and their children. I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10 foot pole until the gay activists running the company are fired."
"""My wife and daughter got to watch... jerking off in the ladies' room next to them, while filming them on his phone. Pretty memorable experience!"" This is how sarha/Sean/Local Perv thinks about his own family, while calling others ""sick"" and ""mentally ill"". I don't even have to mention that women's rooms have stalls so you can't see anyone ""next to you"". That would disturb his fantasy about his own underage (?) daughter. However, it is never surprising to find that bigots are very deranged people. I bet the local police have him on a watch list. I sure hope so for the safety of everyone around him."
"""looks like we are down today due to Trump's inflationary policies""What a bizarre claim. What about Trump's policies are ""inflationary"", in contrast to, say, Obama's policies? Certainly unconstrained government spending and money printing are inflationary, but as far as I can tell, Trump at least acknowledges that these are not desirable policies, whereas Democrats are in a completely delusional bizarro world ala Paul Krugman that the more we borrow and spend, the richer we are."
Up past $70 again. $80 by Christmas for the win..
"How can we save Target? Perhaps Target could ""identify"" as a company NOT run by left wing nut jobs?"
TGT reached a new 52 Week High at 72.81
"When the big boys control 86% of the stock ,it is impossible for an option trader to make any money"
"I just heard that Cristopher Wray might be part of the Democrat-led ""deep state"" conspiracy, since his story conflicts with that of the pv55y grabber.I thought I'd ask Sarah about this, since s/he seems to be the resident expert on said conspiracy theory! ;)"
"Once this stock breaks 80, it's look out below."
Why have we stopped getting boycott updates?!!!!
"If you sell, I will buy for this deep valued stock. I love TGT buying aggressively its stock back. A predictable business that Zack indicates is valued and growth stock pick. The exceptional consistent high return on equity proves a great management of using equity. With 100 dollar invested, return over $20 dollars a year, pay back 4.5% or 4.5 dollars dividend, still have 15.5 dollars left in retained earning to buy back lots of shares. . That is after reinvesting the capital as capital expenditure. Amazingly cheap stock to buy at P/E 13 while Costco trade over 21. 100% growth of Internet digit sales in three years will continue to lift off with delivery faster than Amazon. Loyal customer base that cannot stand the cheap stuff in Walmart. ."
Projection for tomorrow?

I was shopping at Target yesterday and noticed they were selling groceries as well! Wow more profits! $150 easy by Christmas! I don’t get it why people would short this good company!???!
I was hoping for this to start a position!
Notice that the pv55y grabber hasn't been gloating about the stock market for the past 6 months (although many of his illiterate disciples still curiously do). I wonder why that is? ;)
Nice to be able to root tgt long again. Having very nice day !
How are those trany bathrooms working out you morons?are the obama(nations) still shopping there?you know the trumps arent?got ceo?
Target ramping up cleaning.. why?? Shoppers are cleaning the shelves out then staff restock with new clean inventory... smh just a headline for attention and PR showing their social responsibility. GENIUS !!
"Sub-human Timmy wants me to understand how Target's bathroom policy factors into the stock price. If the policy dissuades sub-humans like Timmy from shopping at Target, then it effectively encourages humans to shop at Target. That could very well be why their same store traffic is up. Thank you for staying out of Target Timmy."
"If Target goes lower, buy more. Hold Target for the next decade. It’s a blockbuster blue-chip innovative retailer. Target stores are clean and fresh and full of bright colorful products. The rest-rooms at Target are sparkling clean and have a nice scent. The porcelain bowls in the rest-rooms are polished brilliant white."
If it goes to $65. I am buying
"So it's a ""red herring"" to ask you to prove your claim that Target is more dangerous than other stores? Isn't that the entire reason you post the same thing here over and over? And you can't even prove it. What a waste of a human being."
wmt massively overvalued. TGT still gets no love
seen this game before --get out
"I see Artie want's to split hairs on irrelevant subjects rather than confront the abject failure of Target management and it's contemptuous policies towards womens' rights. I don't blame you, Artie. if you can't win the argument, changing the subject might work with some people."
"Target should buy Kroger (KR), and dominate the grocery market!"
Oversold--took the opportunity to get back in this one for low 54s yesterday.
"Amazon could have bought out Target at $75 a share two years ago, now TGT is eating their lunch."
"Well I was right, but a day late. Still, wmt continues to lose more % wise than tgt, which makes no sense. See this adjusting further down tomorrow."
"told you guys wait 3 days to short, if you shorted above 100 relax it will recede I would short more here to average up. this will come down, shorts are panicking and covering."
Amazon may be interested in buying Target. Converting their stores into warehouses might make economic sense.
Some Target stores are starting to look like Walmart now with the grocery section.
"UP, UP, AND AWAY!!! Here comes $ 170.00!!! GO TGT GO!!!"
Sarha feel sorry for you please stop embarrassing yourself. whatever are you going to said or post we’re ready know you has been saying the same thing all week

"Ha, Target is recovering from it's loss nicely. Go TGT."
"TGT at $100 would still have a pe of less than 18. This compares to Cost 33 pe, Wmt. 35 pe, If you notice per centage-wise, TGT is climbing faster on a daily basis than the 2 companies I mentioned. $90 is around the corner than a slow climb to $100 by earnings, just my opinion."
"Yep, here's another one: October 24, 2017. This just keeps on happening. Target attracts predators like flies now that they know men are allowed in ladies' rooms.http://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/appleton-man-accused-of-secretly-filming-women-in-target-dressing-room"
Thumbs up if you think TGT beats the .91 tomorrow. Down if you think they miss.

I used to love Target. We averaged spending over $5000 per year but after the transgender garbage happened I had not gone back. I went in last week and actually spent $22. I almost walked out because there were about 15 customers in line and only 2 cashiers going. It felt like I was in K Mart.
Big buy here
hi
TGT broke 77 support and 70 support. Next support is 62. Let's hope that holds.
this is what you write
Boycott is really hurting tgt. Look at the price drop.
"I'd try to explain to Sarah what ""compounded annual growth rate"" mean and why no index fund is ever going to average that over 10 years, but s/he believes all that crazy stuff that the p0rn$tarfvck3r says, so I don't think it would be a prudent use of time to try to explain anything logical to him/er."
Pre-market is an overreaction. We are still a profitable company!
sold at 100.50 ...2000 shares ....
Short will pound this today!
I thinkwere seeing seller taking tax loss on TGT and well see 5hem buy back in at the beginning of the year pre earnings report
Target reached an all time high at 157.69

I am new here but not new to forums... truly irritated by all the noise from people posting non relevant political BS ! Your cluttering the forum! There are plenty of Political forums out there this is not the place for it.
thoughts on earnings this week? last couple days have not been great. anyone see upside coming?
I bet State Street is really happy with all this. They have a 9% position.
Volume picking up. Pullback to below 100 before the holiday season starts would be nice.
"They had major issues with stores being closed throughout the night. I would suspect if eCommerce side stays stable, and discounts are competitive as they were for black Friday this stock will rebound. This stock has been always very manipulative, when it rains it pours."
Do y’all think it’s going to hit 180$ by November 27?
Retail sales for November to be reported Friday morning may move TGT big up or down. The trend is down.
"I have posted twice the New York Timex article about a ""transgender woman"" (that's ""sexually confused man in a woman's clothes"" for those of you who still have a functional brain) was arrested for filming a teen girl changing into a bathing suit in a Target dressing room in Idaho. Yes, the people who run Yahoo! are censoring real news posted on this site. Isn't that special?"
Let's see 80
Target investors have underestimated the negative impacts of the boycott. I know it hurts. Learn your lesson and seek forgiveness. Salvation lies within.
"At Target, the value never ends!http://wtkr.com/2017/07/19/man-remains-held-in-jail-accused-of-taking-video-of-teen-in-target-dressing-room/"
stop loss level is 124.75
$WMT and $TGT are closing the gap with $AMZN$AMZN should drop below $1000... way over valued $AMZN
"Prince Pv55y Grabber is trying to tweet up some more anti-Muslim discontent this morning. Since the country is full of crazy conspiracy theorists like Sarah, who believed his previous deplorable lies about “thousands of Muslims celebrating on the streets of New Jersey on 9/11”, they’ll certainly buy into the faux outrage this time too."
Hey Sears make room for TGT on the doormat. LOL the idiots still don't recognize how much the bathroom boycott is hurting them.
"Did the quarterly report say anything about expected effect of 2019 tariffs? I know Target gets a lot of product from China, what do they plan to do?"
"More of the liberals noxious, fascistic policies will be the death of traditional brick and mortar retail. Hardest hit first will be companies like Target that advertise that they pursue policies that are dangerous to the physical and emotional well-being of their customers."
"This will go green (initially) then go red due to profit taking. 1. The momentum (revenue and earnings) are simply not there.2. No stimulus package passed, no expected driver for growth (for now).3. Have you looked at their stores lately? Not much traffic compared to WMT yet WMT with better numbers, far more efficient fulfillment, strong on-line presence - still dropped after earnings.Good Luck!"
plan to short more next week if TGT gaps up or opens flat.
Goldman's bullish on this...I think we break AT high before pullback into earnings
Good to see Target still is doing a good job. I thought the share repurchases would have had a better cost average basis last quarter. Think they were sleeping at the wheel when the market sold off in December. But hopefully they bought aggressively to start this new quarter
Nice rebound today. Back to 190s we go :)
"Regressive, post an anonymous email address and I will send you a $10 gift card to the store of your choice, as a token of appreciation. No joke, serious offer. I have no idea at all how you have managed to time your SQ comments so perfectly for so many months. I am already up $2/share on today's trade."
lots of upside.. look for a surprise in earnings manana.. $64 coming real soon
Buy or Hold or Sell? Is holding up pretty well considered 500 points DOW DROP! Any suggestions??
Shorting right here.
"Dubbed the ""MM3"" (Mass Market 3) TGT WMT COST #Winning in 2020 or the perfect storm, stock piling, hoarding, binge shopping, online retail, home delivery, mom and pop shot and fear make these the best holdings for the 'RESET""!"
Yes Target is spending billions buying its own stock. They've been doing it since the stock was in the 70's. Very dangerous.
"The fascist sexually deviant cult that wants to FORCE women and young girls to share ladies rooms with random men, including perverts and sex offenders. This would include Ark, Nuttymess, nutjob, Dave, Doug, etc.They are militant, they are dogmatic, they are intolerant, and they are vicious.Like jihadis, or any other suicide cultist, they have convinced themselves that their Pleasurable Cruelty to people is justified because they act to vindicate the Righteousness of Strange Gods."
"TGT look's like the next target the 1 % is eyeing to push to $130.00 plus and than run away with $30 million /$40 million,than leave the bag for the average investor"
going to 55
Looks like oversold now
"Geez, by the time normal trading hours open, this will have gone up by well over 60% this year. That is a beast."
RealityIt's all about guidance going forward.
"If anyone had any doubts as to whether maggots are here just for maggotry, please read maggot's comments below. It's true that ALL maggots are merely sub-human maggot garbage who enjoy daily insults."
Holly #$%$ Target is steam rolling over every conventional investing wisdom and leaving investors cheering for joy! ?
Congrats to those who owned calls.
yes drop please I want to buy lower your overpriced
Congrats to any TGT longs. I looked at them in Jan. Didn’t buy. Shame on me!
I'll tell you why customers are leaving Target--long lines and 6 empty registers in the stores.70 Billion in sales and they can't hire 2 more cashiers!!
"congrats Tgt longs. I sold at this level last year, and think it can go higher, wish it would go back down to $100 so I could get back it, but doesn't look that way."
"nice bathroom, LOL. I will never shop there again. My wife and I would spend around 2k a year there until they decided to get political. Now, lets say 2million others will not shop there ever again........ adds up. Idiots execs just dont get it and should be fired immediately"
TGT oversold! It’s a 130 stock yet taken down by CV fears but earnings beat will propel it back to $125-135
"Until TGT gets to $120, shorting it will be suicidal. The euphoria about web/online sales is on right now. Profit from it until $120/$125. That's a one week projection."
Why is this down?
JCPenny is sure to rise ALOT MORE THAN Target can now folksTake a small position and GET PAID
This stock will be around $200 before next result atleast the 30%. EPS has more than doubled. and it pays 2% dividend. you will not find the any other growth stock this cheap. hold on to your shares short squeeze is on the charts
"By the way, Brian Cornell was on tv last week expressing great confidence in the company's direction as the stock price, store traffic, sales, and profits all collapse. Way to go, Brian! Don't let reality deter you from catching all those unicorns you're chasing!"
My Target is doing good. Macy's needs some Love too. Own both.
Target reached an all time high at 169.10
its nearly 14 percent higher... once it reaches 15 percent u can sell bcoz last time also it was dropped after 15 percent
TGT is up 4.95% to 108.10
Might test high 60s again after Powell opens his mouth

High Five Sarha! clap http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/06/Colbert-High-Five.gif
"Target could be a little bit of a dangerous short because Cornell could be fired any day now, and the new CEO could ""re-clarify"" their bathroom policy to something sane. The best time to short was BEFORE TGT admitted how badly the boycott was hurting them. In order to do that, one would have to be able to see through fake news, and I doubt if most people are capable."
"Gee, if Target gains another 20 percent, it will be back to where it was before they made it a deliberate corporate policy to expose women and children to perverts, sex offenders, and voyeurs in their ladies' rooms. Great job, Target management!"
P.S. I told you to sell
Sold. How long till TGT stops depending on price cuts! http://alph.st/b81882e5
"Tgt is still undervalued. It's pe has moved up recently from the 18 to 20 range. Cost pe is 35, priced to perfection that's why you it can't get above $300. Wmt is also priced to perfection at 24 and having trouble exceeding the $120 mark. I would argue that Tgt deserves a pe of 25 to be valued fairly because it is growing it's sales faster than Wmt and does not really compare to a bulk item store like Cost. I believe it will grow into a 25 pe by next year. I also believe Tgt will increase it's earnings to $7 per share. So taking 25 x $7 = $175. I believe it will get there by next Xmas so a lot of growth ahead in the new year. jmho"
"Yes, I believe everything I read in the media, particulary CNN and ""Market Realist""."
But but but the boycott. Guess the resident clowns finally moved on. Our deceptive posters know who they are!!!!
"Yeah, I care Ferengi Tranny Quarky. I care so much my life revolves around your every word. So just answer my legit investment question. Less hyperbole, thanks Tranny Ferengi Quarky. ;)"
keep our mentally ill president out of Target bathrooms.
"If they can do 3.31 a qtr going forward, say that is around $13 per annum, this is about a PE of 12. Very cheap should trade a lot higher!"
Can someone explain to me why Target at $122 is a better stock to buy than Kroger (KR) at $32.45 when Kroger does the same thing and more? Financial for Kroger are great. Seems to me upside potential is much greater for Kroger.
"Omg, 3x as many people at tgt today as wal-mart, why did I not buy this stock. Its killing it. Why would anyone ever step foot in WMT again?..."
"Responding to the fact that you post every hour doesn't mean responding *to* your post It was a genuine comment, not an insult. I am not sure what you're trying to achieve. Back in the day, there was an active back and forth but with TGT stock stable, I don't think anyone cares at all. Please keep posting."
"Holiday Shopping at $TGT you will, says Baby Yoda. Target will be one of the few places you can get him. "
Damn beat that price down so I can buy this money wagon
It'll rebound back tomorrow and next week once all the emotion gives way
doesn't any of tgt's senior mgmt have the decency to resign?
"My store is a Super Target,runs like a top just got the wrong people running things (teamleader,ETLS,director)."
"Summer is almost here, will Tar-jey hit $eight-tey this year?"
Wasn't planning to invest but will now based on all these crazy hater posts - transgenders deserve same respect as you and I.
"Don’t touch this for few days, look at Walmart. Speaking from experience unfortunately"
"true story:went to my local tgt for a recon of the crowd. the parking lot was packed. once in the door, i had to pee. went to the very clean men's room. no perverts anywhere. life has gone on."
"I love Target. Wonderful shopping experience. The quality is excellent and prices are so cheap. Bright, clean stores, easy to navigate. You get everything you could need. The online Target store is great too. E-commerce on Target is as good as anywhere. This blue chip retailer will be just fine."
"All I can tell is that now I have to start posting old links again because I am running out of things to say. I hold TGT shorts and that's not going well. I hold WMT long position and that has tanked bigly. To make the situation horrible, I have recently come to realize that my bestie is a gay man and right wing nut job friends say that that's a sin.

"Dr PantCrapper, let me share an actual regret I have from my years of investing ..so you have better (and real) material to go after me. The whole $43 SQ is getting old.. whether you like it or not, SQ has been very profitable. You can call it luck. In early 2000s, as a noob investor, I traded and sold AMZN for $21. For several years, I watched from the sidelines as AMZN kept going up. Finally I bought it for $490-500 in summer of 2015 as a long term investment. It wasn't easy buying a stock for ~500 after selling it for ~20. Selling AMZN in early 2000s was a real error and you should remind me frequently how I messed up there. Thanks in advance."

A person with a god complex may refuse to admit the possibility of their error or failure, even in the face of irrefutable evidence, intractable problems or difficult or impossible tasks. The person is also highly dogmatic in their views, meaning the person speaks of their personal opinions as though they were unquestionably correct.[1] Someone with a god complex may exhibit no regard for the conventions and demands of society, and may request special consideration or privileges.[1]"
"And it’ll go lower, it’s not that earnings were bad, they were good, but all these big companies are just overvalued, there’s still more of a pullback gonna happen over the next month. Look at what happened after good earnings to so many companies like QCOM, VRTX, many others... They dropped right after and then have trickled lower for a few weeks. I expect the same here. The market is simply overvalued and needs a pullback..."
Congrats to all the shareholders on a great day!
I stormed Target yesterday when they opened at 5pm on thanksgiving. I punched and clawed everyone. Wound up knocking over several people and nabbed the Black Friday specials. It was a thrill.

Looks like TGT is going to roll over big time today. I just have that feeling.
this isn't a political board by posting politics you are abusing my rights
I expected TGT would be up today based on multiple reports citing strong black Friday sales
Shorts are panicking with TGT up premarket after a huge day yesterday. Shorts came in late yesterday expecting profit taking today. Dangerous game options are (Yoda voice)!
"I don't hate Walmart but look at the WMT stock.. without my having to cherry-pick any data, you can tell that there's a serious/ long term problem there. On the other hand, TGT is fairly stable with plenty to look forward to. I know there are folks who will cherry pick data to ""win"" this argument and they can have their win but deep down these folks actually agree with me."
"I love TGT, both as an investment and as a retail operation. During the last Great Recession (2007 into early 2009), TGT not only maintained their dividend but raised their dividend. That was amazing performance."
this will either fill the gap in the 90's or pop 4 bucks tomorrow

Bought TGT at 69.90.
why is tgt down today? any thoughts?

TGT is in oversold territory according to the Relative Strength Index. Should see some green days soon.
This will drop hard. Selling my profits today.

There is only one way to solve the problems with Target management and their bigotry towards womens' rights to safety and privacy.
"My price Target for TGT in a year $200, this retail store has figured out online and in store."
I enjoy seeing the traffic at my local target. The staff there are impressive. Never seen such constant inventory mgmt. they restock rapidly!
"lordy, I'm in up 14% in 3 weeks heaven. Did I mention I have the divy locked down too? Nice being up 5 years worth of 10yr. T's in 3 wks. Not to mention a div 2x the T rate."

"Target's policy of systematically violating the privacy rights of their female customers and their children is now a matter of public record, and they are standing by it. The only thing to do now is hit them where it hurts, in the pocketbook. Target has lost millions of customers and will continue to bleed out for years. Of course the CEO doesn't care, he's already go his $18 million regardless of how the stock does. My advice to any stockholders is to bail out now, because after Q3 earnings, their will be a bloodbath in TGT stock."
"Wow, its still going and going and going. These people don't take no break. lol"
"What’s the rule... don’t buy into a 52 week high, wait for a pull back. With today’s huge jump, took my chances on Oct $105 puts for $6. Should see a nice pullback in a day or two. Then go long!"
"LOL, yup, still overvalued at the 170s, wait for the market correction you will be able to buy this stock at $100 lvl where it should be"
"Hey S G, looks like another great day to buy Target! Down another 1 percent! It's on sale! Back up the truck! LOLZ"
Can anyone tell me why Target is skyrocketing? This shouldn't be happening while the boycott is in effect. The boycotters are formidable foes who know their business. They know how to put a drag on a stock.
Is it possible that Brian Cornell is actually a secret agent for Walmart? Isn't he the guy behind letting perverts into ladies' rooms?
"This week could possibly be the inflection point to which $TGT makes a strong comeback; additionally, Target may shoot right into north of $120/share and above by Friday. Cheers to all Target investors!"
"200 average is $80..... why anyone would sell, the qtr will be great"
This is starting to look like when amazon announced 1 day prime shipping and target dropped from ~82 to ~77 instantly. It slowly trickled down to the low 70s before crushing earnings and roaring back up to 89 over the next several weeks. I wonder if this will be another good buying opportunity or if these tariffs will really put the squeeze on target
Wow this board is screwed in the head.No wonder this thing is 85% Institutional.
Time to buy on Monday isn’t it?
And with a P/E at 13. Glad I hung on.
"No Thanks, we are boycotting big businesses who are political. Only buy from local businesses now!"
Flipped to a short on tgt today. Sold my shares at 187.50 and went short at 187.61 just think short term it is overpriced. Plan to cover next time it dips below 178.
got in yesterday. was sure would beat er. 100 by friday i would say
The Target I went to yesterday was busy and had full aisles emptied out from purchases. hopefully they can continue this strength into next year.
Incredible strength here following that massive post-ER surge! I'll be loading up o in-the-money Calls once this drops back to $140-$145 in the next 1-2 weeks to fill the gap and consolidate a bit before it resumes it run up over $200. GLTA!

How is the Boycott going? Any update?

"since when is this a venting politics, name calling board? times may be tough, but how about some some real opinions, info on this stock."
Looks like TGT will be range bound in $104 range until the next big market move occurs (could be flat for next couple months).
Great shorting opportunity for Target!
"A once great company gone down the path of Liberal irrelevance. Per CNBC yesterday: ""That CEO (Cornell) has No Credibility)"" Swapped into HD 6 months ago. Not Soon Enough but never Too Late."
"Wow, if Target goes up another $4, it'll be back where it was 3 years ago, when it decided that mentally ill men should be given free run of ther ladies' rooms, whether their female customers liked it or not. This during the greatest bull run in the stock market in history. Good job, progressives - you managed to destroy another company."
Will reach 80 by EOD
I know of entire Churches in my area that have not shopped at Target since the boycott began and continue to do so. How long will the CEO and board of directors continue to allow the stockholders and the employees to suffer. Is it not their job to protect the shareholder?
Selloff just getting started sell now buyback at $100 if you really love TGT. Way over bought here. 30% gains in 2 days come on man

Target rocks this week! Here's to a great earning report next week Targeteers ! Have an awesome and safe weekend everyone.
slot machine time!
Sales UP 1.4% despite the nut jobs boycott. Stock up 1.75% today. These are facts. GOD LOVES TGT!!!!
incorrectly reported on the local morning news that target made more in 2020 that the last 11 years combined LOL
Boycotting Amazon yet?

I covered my short position at a loss (80 cents/share).. but I'm even more thankful to Regressive and ObviousPedophile for persuading me to go long on TGT right away. I don't think I'm kidding even..
who wants to call the price at 2:30pm ET (3:30pm CT)?????longs and shorts
This stock is a tank
I have 3000 shares that I'm still holding. PE is still reasonably low and investors are running out of places to put cash
"HOME, LOWE and TGT showing people are coming back to brick and mortar stores as online shopping is slowly losing it's charm."
Target management and its supporters have put reality on mute.
Target may be in the running to buy Rite Aid and it's PBM.....Amazon probably will acquire Rite Aid.
"FYI- The upcoming TGT dividend will be the 206th consecutive dividend paid since October 1967 when the company became publicly held. TGT has INCREASED the yearly dividend for 47 straight years! Now that is among a rare breed, a true dividend titan.."
"I was loughing out when some one was said this morning , that Target's stock will be crushed to 115 on Monday because of the rioters burnt one of the store in minisota. dude target has almost 2000 stores across the USA, so how you suppose you want to drop this stock to 10% down because of this one store. smfdh."

Anti science Artie hasn’t posted in awhile. He’s probably scouting out target bathrooms like Ronald.
The boycott continues to bring targets to its knees. Could management be in the restrooms?
"Not a single socialist Democrat will sign the tax bill that is expected to boost the stock market, the economy, and the fortunes of taxpayers. Thus it is demonstrable that Democrats are the enemies of this country, if you hadn't learned that already."
Target and the media can't acknowledge the boycott as the reason because that will embolden the effort and take away their self-perceived power.
"I am genuinely happy to serve some purpose for you, Regressive. I sometimes feel indebted to you because of the total dollar amount of SQ trades, so if I am serving some kind of a purpose for you.. that's good to know. All I know is that the purpose you have served for me is extraordinary and tangible. I mean.. look at SQ right now compared to your where it was when you last SQueaked. How is that you know when to alert me to short SQ? Statistically speaking, it's pretty weird I'd say."
Thanks to WMT. People still need retails.
To Target President. Take down the “ Masks required “ sign on your stores NOW: because CDC says: “we are back to normal “

"I rarely read anything that these nut jobs post. The fact that they are silent or simply lie when I ask them why women should be forced to share ladies' rooms with mentally ill men shows me that they have little to say, and that they are devoid of respect for others and their rights. I try not to make judgements about others, if they are gay or like to dress as women that is their business so long as they don't try to infringe on my rights or the rights of others."

I hope your losses weren't that bad (not really, I'm actually LMFAO)."
I don't own this stock but am thinking about adding to my portfolio now that price has come down. Is there someone on this board that owns this stock that can give me their opinion as to the growth of the company without talking about the boycott. Thank you very much.
Tough year for Target bagholders. Gonna get tougher until they fire management and hire people who respect womens' rights and safety.
Target is a marvelous retailer and an excellent investment for dividend and value oriented investors. The Target shopping experience is probably the best in the country.

Be careful about that Businessinsider website. The link I posted from April is totally factual but let me show you an example from this website regarding fake news:http://www.businessinsider.com/target-stock-price-amazon-competition-2017-8
"Congrats guys!In at $123 Out at $196Made a nice $3,997and some divy.Was a nice ride, gonna walk with my cash, best of lock, TGT is great."
"If you buy any new items on Ebay, before you make the bid, ask the question, ""Is the item coming from an Amazon warehouse or involved with Amazon in any way"". And don't order if they say it is sourced from Amazon or warehoused there. I recently ordered an Oriole feedert That was new and it came in amazon packaging. I complained to Ebay and the seller. Ebay said they could not do anything about where things were shipped from and the seller said he had things warehoused in amazon and shipped from there. I gave him a poor rating, and from now on, I will ask. I will have NONE of Amazons garbage in my house. It is a predatory pricer that is like a spreading cancer. Boycott Amazon"
"Isn't it funny how the NUT JOB considers anonymous, unsourced, spurious accusations against Roy Moore (and presumably any other Republican) to be gospel truth? More evidence of schizophrenia, if any was needed. Sad. And vicious."
Serious question. At what level would it take to get you to buy TGT?
TJX hitting all time high today. And WMT had good report as well. How can TGT not have a good ER?
I suspect a strong beat and up strong in premarket. Cornell seems to confident these days for a miss on numbers.
"Any woman who supports Target's policy of letting any man who demands it, including sex offenders, into ladies' rooms has no one to blame but herself if she or one of her children gets victimized. I guess for some, that's what it will take to make them understand how dangerous this policy is."
"Republican candidate points out the idiocy of letting men into ladies' rooms. Note that the insane politics of the Democratic Party has mandated that all of the politicians be psychotic, by calling men ""women"":“We need to stop those crazy … people in power,” Saavedra says to the camera as the person leaves the Denny’s. “We cannot allow those things. We need to respect the family. We need to respect women and men, separate. We cannot put them together in the same restroom.”Saavedra claimed she was prepared to defend herself had the altercation turned violent.“I was with my pepper spray ready and I called the manager so he helped me,” she says. “How can I be with a man inside of the ladies’ room just because he thinks he’s a lady? This is unbelievable. Only in California this happens.” Saavedra’s opponent, Democrat incumbent Nanette Barragán, condemned the video.“I was appalled by the treatment that this woman received for simply trying to use the restroom. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and the right not to be discriminated against for who they are,” Barragán said.When Target announced that it would welcome transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity two years ago, shopper traffic declined for the first time in years. As a result, the company installed more single-occupancy bathrooms in all its stores to give critics of the policy more privacy costing the retail giant Target $20 million to install."
"Remember how you declared one day when SQ went up big.. ""loving the SQ price action"" (something like that). That's how it all started. I have really enjoyed shorting SQ and rubbing it all over face. I enjoyed it so much that I posted my YTD gains a couple times... something I don't like to disclose usually. if you ask me, I will post again lol. After the recent 20+% drop.. one digit has been added to that YTD total (yeah I know you looked at the last one LOL)"
so 125 is good price to sell ..but it can rise 5 more percent
COB and CEO should beseparate. How can they policethe robbery of cash by a obviously delusional stuffedshirt? Drunk on a 180 day onehit wonder performance.After being the dog of DJI foryears.
"I wonder how many billions of shareholder equity was flushed down the transgender toilet when this company decided to let men into the ladies rooms with their female customers and their children. Incredibly stupid unforced error, at a time when retail stocks are under enormous pressure from online, why would you destroy the one advantage you have over online sales? Shows that this company has major management problems."
Having fun with your boycott LO? It's a good way to spend your golden years. I'm just getting rich and enjoying my youth.
Target is a $100 Stock.
"Target, Walmart and Costco are disrupting Amazon’s core business. They are beating Amazon at its own game."
Target is up 4.92% to 189.24
The chart looks like there is support around $73 so no need to panic.
"$80 will be nigh, before summer's goodbye."
My conscience cannot bear setting foot in a TGT store. Been avoiding them for quite a while.
Other retailers going bankrupt. Target benefits.
"Let this be a lesson: It was after Boehning, a member of the North Dakota House of Representatives, voted against gay rights that he was outed on Grindr with explicit photos and messages.

"Call Target Corporation Customer Relations and ask them for how long they intend to continue endangering and having contempt for womens and girls rights to privacy, safety, and security in Target stores.1 (800) 440-0680"
This man would be welcome in any Target ladies' room by Target management.http://wnep.com/2018/01/15/man-accused-of-peeping-on-women-in-dressing-room/
"I don't mind admitting that I was wrong in shorting TGT. Initial target was to short it through to mid 40s, then I started trading and it worked out but now I have covered my last trade which ended up being a loss. I continue to remain of the opinion that gain in stock price is going to be limited."
Looks like Macys kind of hosed us this morning.
I am long but this stock sucks harder every day. I thought they were leaner and finding ways to compete especially online. Not seeing the results. Am I missing something?
"I knew Sarah's rant-reply (or series-of, as the case may be) would be a real hoot!FYI, there are at least two WFM stores within 5 miles of me that have ""multiple use"" restrooms with stalls. I'm sure that most of the flyover-land WFM stores are so small that they only have single-use ones (and I'm not even going to go into the fact that Target also offers ""single-use"" restrooms as an options for fearful people like Sarah... we've covered that ad-nauseum, but Sarah refuses to acknowledge)."
"Too much hype, Q1 Comparison is very easy beat. Because last year Q1 we all thought Covid would kill most of us. I wait to see Q3 and Q4 E.Rep. before making any judgement."
Thought I'd check in on the bathroom boycott. How's that working out?
"Take the bet, Ronald. Prove the cleanliness of the bathrooms."
Note to the Libs.... its good business practice to keep your political beliefs close to your chest....And stupid to alienate close to 50% of your potential customers....Even if just 25% of the 50% boycott ou you're eFFed.....If another 25% of the 50% spend 50% less.... you're TOASTTGT has burned themselves..... thats why they are referred to as TOASTIm wondering how many Hollywood elites started to shop at TGT because of their progressive policies.... thats right none.... TGT needs the middle class.... and more of the middle class leans conservative than it leans liberal....
"I should add that Target actually is pretty much giving their stuff away on the liquidation market, which is flooded with Target merchandise. If that is any indication, their sales reports should be considered highly suspect and I would predict a huge drop in the future for Target stock. Should never have let mentally ill men into the ladies' rooms. What were they thinking?"
When did Target start having the grocery store business?
"The odds of having a bad experience in a Target rest-room is less than 1 in 10,000,000."
time to take profit
nice!
Will target continue to evolve and expand more with online sales in the upcoming years?
"Gee, ""Real Investors"" know why WMT's stock is down. In alternate reality psychotic schizophrenic world of ""facts"", ""its down because of market forces."" Says fake psychotic so called ""Real Investors"".We ""Real Investors"" living in reality know WMT stock price is down for the ACQUISITION of FlipKart.

$17 BILLION DEBT / Book Value laughable $22 per share = DELISTING & CHAPTER 11 on the way
Sure hope u didnt buy the topIn these $wmt and $tgt $aapl $shop- black friday a total bust this year
"TGT is on it's way to chapter 11... The CEO resigning is the only thing that help this debt burden co with falling SSS. WMT has posted record ecommerce sales (which is the fastest growing sector in retail) SSS are also up. Another thing bringing down TGT is the poor quality of food and the fact it expires on the shelves. They don't need an ex Kroger employee, they need a food distribution company that has centrally located warehouses to the TGT stores. The new Kroger guy can't help with that. Not to mention...TGT has LOST it's customers. Once they are gone you can kiss them goodbye forever (unless the CEO quits and they completely change their philosophy.)BK is on the way...too much debt to service with falling revenue."
Consider the fact that Walmart has a PE multiple twice that of Target and a far lower dividend yield.
"The republican party has been hijacked by nut jobs like sarha who think killing Americans is just another day on the job. He even threatened to run me over. Let me tell you if Tim ever got toe to toe with me he would ^%*& his pants. My nick name in high school was H3 (H cubed) for Hard Hitting Honkie. This ""man"" would be on his knees doing whatever I told him if he ever saw me."
"Hope all that were talking smack yesterday were able to dump this stock before it ""fell below 50""."
Should have been working on your sales strategy instead social bathroom issues.
"As others have pointed out, TGT is in a very good place right now. If it drops after earnings, I will gladly buy. Regressive is upset that he was has helped me short SQ and it turned out to be a major profit for me. Funny thing is that he will keep helping me, he doesn't really want to but he just can't help it."
KeyBanc raised price target $110.
"Of course, the guy was not caught so we can't rule out that it was Ark taking advantage of Target's ""inclusive"" policy."
"I remember not too long ago when this company was ""doomed"". Analysts and ""experts"" are a joke."
Trained monkey is showing how well trained he is today.
Isn't it amazing how Target fans always buy at the lows and sell at the highs? Boy that's some genius trading!
"Victim of Target's transgender policy relates emotional fallout from her abuse at the hands of a ""transgender woman"" in a Target dressing room. Then she relates how she has always been a liberal, but never realized what that actually means until she was victimized herself, i.e., until she met actual reality.Target announced in April its policy to allow transgenders to use the bathrooms and changing rooms that correspond with their gender identity.The victim begged District Judge Joel Tingey to impose the maximum sentence at Smith’s hearing. She maintained she still suffers from long-term “emotional mutilation” and has had to undergo counseling after the incident.“It’s kind of a far-fetched cliché,” the victim said. “I never thought this would happen. I always supported the transgender community, but I felt a little betrayed.”Target announced in April its policy to allow transgenders to use the bathrooms and changing rooms that correspond with their gender identity.The victim begged District Judge Joel Tingey to impose the maximum sentence at Smith’s hearing.

"TGT is a winner and will continue to go up., In the retail space, I like GameStop the strong growth and dividend paying selling xbox, iphone and collectiables with great monopoly. Gaming is becoming the biggest industry than Sports internationally."
Traffic UP 1.4% at stores open at least 1 year. Maybe fat old Timmy needs to double his posts because his boycott is not working. Sales UP. 9% also. More people spending more money. I thought boycotts were supposed to lower sales? What happened limp d!)< timmy?
"Sarah's posting news reports about ""changing rooms"" to try to support his/er issue with ""bathrooms"" and also using stories about pedophilia to incite fear about the LGBT community. People who are reasonably intelligent will notice that the premise has nothing to do with the conclusion. Lots of people are below ""reasonably intelligent"", though. Sarah learned his/er diversion tactics from the pvssygrabber well."
"*ALERT*From all the rosy headlines you would not know that Target LOWERED GUIDANCE but they did so that is why they pumped it and sold it to naive retailers all day In 2nd qtr 2017, Target expects low single digit decline in comp sales, continuing operations Adjsted EPS of $0.95 to $1.15.For full-yr 2017, Target continues to expect a low single digit decline in comp sales."
"Target's performance over the past 18 months would have to lead one to wonder if there's an active ""boycott"" of the AFA! ;)"
Frankly this is kind of amazing that TGT is down just 2% when Dow is down 1500 points.

Looks like Shorts are back in. Checked with my broker and there is no stock available to borrow. Next couple days will be critical to see if today’s lows can hold.
"""Target's boycott has succeeded because""Yes I know it has succeeded just like Hallmark's and Disney's and.."
up 4% anyone want to talk about that?
Moved healthcare to Target today.......Goldman upgrade plus the brand equity and most other places closed down this will have an impact
My dog's niece could run the company better than this hack of a CEO. Sad!
It takes a special kind of stupid to pander to a tiny slice of the market while angering the vast majority. But Dayton Hudson is populated by mindless SJWs who don't seem to care. Shorting TGT would be the smart play

There is a reason why TGT has a PE ratio of 10. It's called bad prospects and bad management.
"Incredible manipulation here. Entire market is already down on significant job loss. SPY is down 2 dollars before open, and entire retail sector is red. But here’s TGT still going green. Hold on to you seats folks, cuz it’s gonna be a steep fall"
by friday it will be 73 and 80 by christmas
Alrighty how low we going today papa needs more money sub 80 really start taking in the profit from targets problems
I heard they are going to announce a ban of Sean in the ladies bathrooms today.
"I was recently in Target and they had two ""family bathrooms"" that were unisex with one toilet in each of them and a lock. There is no possible way a man can come into those bathrooms and peep on anyone. This bathroom stuff is hysteria pure and simple. I bought this stock around $58 thinking I hit it at bottom. Unfortunately it is still going down but I believe it will turn around soon. If I had more money, I'd be buying even more now."
Wow! Year to date TGT is 4% ahead of Walmart. Who's boycotting Walmart? I thought the 10 people in the TGT chatroom that are the TGT boycott were only bringing TGT to it's knees.......loltoo funny
THIS IS PENYSTOC EVERYDAY.
TGTneeds to work on their grocery area. Groceries keep people coming into the store and they are likely to buy something else.
years behind
WMT is up 1% TGT is down 2% joke of the day
I told you... you are late. Greed kills the bank account. Wait for a pullback to 94-96 range if you want to go long then you should be fine
"Got another example yesterday of corruption in our government, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, Hillary lies to the FBI on her servers, she deletes 33,000 emails after she receives a subpoena, a State department senior offical tries to bribe the FBI to declassify some of Hillary's emails, her IT staff takes the 5th amendment rather than tesitfy to Congress on erasing the servers, the pay for play Clinton Foundation, the rigged Deomcratic primaries, it just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens. Why hasn't the Press called this out?FYI, the reason Hillary wants open borders is that aliens typically vote Democratic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PK-SK0h9o"

"News that TGT is testing ""flow center"" to improve backroom efficiency is good to hear, although I am surprised this wasn't done years ago. Large backrooms are at thing of the past in retail and I expect TGT to roll this out chain wide fairly rapidly once they've worked all the kinks out. This will result in additional distribution centers around the country, but will be well worth the investment. Good to see TGT being smart. Full disclosure... Long term investor with no plans to sell my TGT shares. I personally feel there's a good chance AMZN will make a play to acquire TGT at some point as well, but not the reason I'm holding. I'm a long term holder of AMZN shares as well."
"Get on the rocket, NOW"
"Like I said before. TGT's most recent performance was 100% an aberration. They are just one of several businesses that stayed open or had e-commerce infrastructure allowing them to take advantage of the effects of the Marxist shutdown. Once the media-driven ""pandemic"" is behind us and things get back to normal, the numbers will come crashing back to earth and so will the stock price. If you think this performance is the start of a trend in business, you are going to get a rude awakening."
There's nobody except shorts who are down on their TGT investment at this moment... I don't think the new shorts understand what that does to sentiment. This is very similar to Disney after it passed $120 for the first time... It was a ride straight to the $140's. Target will be making a quick ride to $120 in my opinion. Shorts are going to get terribly burned unless the broad market takes spill. Enjoy!
"Somebody will end up holding the bag as usual , going to short April $130.00 wish me luck :)"

"Um, no, our ideals are based on Enlightenment, which is when western civilization escaped from the xtian ""ideals"" of subjugation, intolerance and oligarchy."
Just went to walmart and took a huge dump in the ladies room. Its crazy there was no security guard to stop me even though I have not had the operation yet and still got my man parts. Anyway why are all WMT shoppers so huge? It was like a honey boo boo family reunion in there. After dropping the deuce I got out of there as quick as I could. What a disgusting place to shop.
"Evidently Nut Job thinks that because public retail stores are open to dangerous predators, mostly men, then that means we should invite them all into ladies' fitting and bathrooms, no questions asked, because after all, we can't ""check their genitals"". Never could understand the logical processes of an ideologue, I doubt that logic has any part of what goes on in their heads."
Cramer just nailed it. Said target had great comps and a wonderful quarter and is stomping the competition but the CEO didn’t know how to deliver the news
Established a long position this morning. Very happy with a cost basis of $67.16 in a very well run company with a nice dividend. Hope to reap nice profits along with the other long position holders here.
"Just read the news on our BILLION dollar plan! I trust Cornell & I think he is going to make a SPLASH with this! At first, i was skeptical, but it actually makes sense to go this route! BOOM!"
I guess saying TGT's numbers are not as bad as expected is a good thing. It beat expectations and still only finished the day up $.51 but is still down about $2.70 for the week. The costumers that feel alienated still are not coming back.
"Reading these comments make me feel ill to actually see how many ignorant people are out there and they all have an uneducated opinion about everything. I work at Target and trust me the least of the bathroom problems is a dude walking into the lady's room. Unless someone tries to get into the same stall with me, we're good. I can also promise you that Target will be more than busy come the holiday season, they are so much more superior to WalMart in regards to customer service and the overall experience. #ignorantpeople"

"My local Super Target today was more crowded than I've seen anytime in November or December.. maybe ever. Going just by that fact, it seems like I made a mistake by selling my shares. TGT to 100 in 2018??"

"Here is what I am thinking, Wmt is coming out with earnings 8/15. Now if Wmt reports great earnings that will bode well for Tgt. Also, Tgt ex div. date is 8/20, earnings date 8/21. $87 area seems to be the floor for Tgt right now. So the plan would be to accumulate shares of Tgt. between now and 8/15. If Wmt. does well that means retail spending is still robust and don't forget back to school sales. I am thinking Tgt around $90 before earnings plus the $.66 div. ex date 8/20. We could then see a pop to $99 after earnings with a great Tgt earnings report"

if down tomorrow going to buy
TGT will rally past $200 then announce a split in the near future. Hang on folks
"For Nut Job, a sexual assault by a man in a Target ladies' room is an ""anecdote"", not really something to be concerned about. Also, remember if he can find one story where a woman says it's okay to let men into ladies' rooms, in his world that constitutes a vast majority of women, and any woman or girl who complains is a ""bigot"". Nice, eh? This is what the militant homosexual lobby has become, along with the Democratic Party that supports it."
Target remains 275 on this.
"Can someone (hopefully, from the company) inform me how many more TRANSVESTITES have been gained ascustomers from the TRANSVESTITE friendly Target? Rumors are that there have been fantastic gains in thiscustomer category. And can someone inform me how many more great paying heterosexual customershave been lost? And how does all this relate to the bottom line? Thank you...."
"As Target continues to succeed (especially with younger people), does anyone want to take bets on how long it is before DD and Sarah declare that all millennials are going to hell?"
Looks like today is the day we hit $50... lol
"Target's de facto policy, as we all know (though some choose to lie about it) is that any man is permitted into any ladies' room at any time. That is simply a fact, though occasionally for some reason som of the libt4rd perverts choose to lie about it. Allowing men dressed as women into ladies' rooms, is a whole other issue, some have been getting away with it for years and still are, and that can be a problem but it's not as much of a problem as the de facto policy. And no, Target is lying about its policy by not explicitly admitting to it publicly, so we all know that they are essentially lying to the public as well."
Here is a picture of LocalOwner from this weekend posting at his computer. https://goo.gl/images/SmQUWkHe reminds me of the gay kid in high school who constantly puts down gay people so people won't suspect he's gay.
Never would have imagined Walmart would trade lower than $TGT until 2 weeks ago. Hahaha... Target is killing Walmart's thunder! I love this stock!
"Totally unexpected. What is wrong with you people? Stop complaining right now and get back in those stores. I saw every excuse in the book in the management comments for lower sales, except the boycott. I guess the boycott is not having any effect. Well, at least we tried. I guess Cornell is too smart for the rest of us."

"I asked a Target manager if he was selling his shares..... He responded, “Yeah, I sold half because I never saw it this high working here for over 20 years!” He said he would hold the remaining half and would cash out in retirement."
Stock is totally on a collapse mode.
Yup going to at least 115
"Why is Walmart doing well, and Target is not? Well, Walmart doesn't have a boycott by millions of former customers, for one thing."
Will close Greeen

Hopefully a fresh 52 week high tomorrow.
$130.00 Wednesday. Great Holiday numbers and Friday traffic numbers will be huge.
The market will continue to bleed up until after earnings season. Wait for pull back (likely in September) and buy at $100.
I own about 75 shares. It is a tiny part of my IRA. Should I consider buying AAPL if I sell TGT? AAPL is being forced down by the hedge funds. But it is only temporary situation. AAPL will have blow out numbers.
"the cherry on top of the ice cream, don't we have a dividend coming our way also"
"This stock HAS to fill gap so if they are all that, they will get the gap up filled and proceed forward"

"Wow,what is going on here."
"77 is one support - if that breaks, then 70 looks like the next support. TGT buyers tomorrow won't be buying when they lose the dividend (ex-dividend), so buying will depend solely on earnings and forecast."
"I work at a TGT and I'm bullish on the stock long term, but this year's BF traffic was way down. Not sure if the new BF hrs for this year had anything to do with it. Hoping for high ecom sales."

target also raised guidance also. run shorty run
What time is the ER?
"I done reading the panic media, hit Target, Walmart, Sprouts and Trader Joes, Target and Walmart were literally SOLD OUT of many things, sales will be huge for the quarter."
This is trading like an overvalued tech stock. Opened up 120.44 spiked up to 121.33 and now struggling to maintain 118. What’s with that? Shorts?
"They may not have their strategy figured out, but at least they have a progressive, liberally-approved bathroom policy. That's obviously working."

"UNDER $148 BEFORE Close ,,,MEGA BUBBLE here"
if the Black Friday crowds don't turn out in past numbers then tgt will be dropping quick. There is not mot much upside here now but plenty of downside.
TGT up 10.36% today! Where is everybody?
Still too expensive.Will decline going into tomorrow.
"this stock is as bipolar as Kellyanne Conway. sell at 77, buy at 74, repeat repeat . when will it reach its potential at 90?"

I wonder how many of the LWNJ on here bought the fake news of the teenagers wearing the MAGA hats? Little kevin bought it for sure. Nut job still believes it. Ronald doesn’t care. He’s in a Target bathroom stall having lunch.
"""US Supreme Court says it will not hear appeal from Pennsylvania students who claimed a high school's transgender policy violated their privacy.""You _might_ be a RWNJ if you think that the 2019 Supreme Court is ""too liberal"". ;)"

"But, but, but, the boycott! Hahahaha Yahoo Finance has learned that Target (TGT) and TJ Maxx (TJX) are tied as consumers’ favorite value retailer.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-retailers-tied-americas-favorite-value-184157338.html"
Anyone notice how its always warmer in target than in walmart? Now if they can just get rid of that popcorn/toilet smell when you walk in that would be great.
Drops under $100 on Monday.
"went shopping for a 6 qt. instapot on line. tgt price was 79.95. rather than fool with ordering, i just went to local tgt store. price at store was 99.95. I asked what happened to 79.95 price? checkout lady said in-store prices are always higher. went to wmt site. price was 79.95. went to local wmt superstore. price was 79.95--same as on-line price. guess where I purchased."
"Boys, Girls, Men, and Women all should have no problem in the Target restrooms. Everything is clean and fresh and Target customers are friendly and respectful. Everybody can take comfort breaks while shopping in Target. Take 45 minutes in the restroom, if that's what U need."
Congrats to all the longs that held strong. What a great result. Great CEO and a great future. Well done.
"@nabeel, what time frame do you use SMA for sell signal?"
Once in while you do get the opportunity to pick up solid company stocks on sale and this is it. Buy TGT now and you will not regret. CEO didn't know how to emphasize on the good news but most of you people are smart enough to understand the opportunity when you see one. Good luck.
DANGER..........RSI 83OVERBOUGHT
The amount of market share we steal & who we steal it from is actually unbelievable!
Market Pantry thin wheat snack crackers at Target are delicious. Another successful Target trip.
Let's short this POS down to ZERO !!
"Not my job to ""show up"" here and especially not since I am waiting to see if TGT will drop enough to give me a chance to invest again. HOWEVER - Regressive, thank you for motivating me to short SQ yet again last week. I did post a thank you note for you and offered to post my infamous ""doctored"" PNG images but you were nowhere to be found."
Target is up 4.91% to 216.56
"To add to the insanity, TGT is actually spending $5 billion to buy back it's own stock. How's that going to work when interest rates tick up a few more points and the cash squeeze starts due to declining sales?TGT - the next K-Mart?"
"Congrats , that is how earnings results should look like , not like Walmart lol went up only $2"
Yeah 89 not selling
that 219.82 print minutes before the close is classic---
Will share price surpassed Walmart's? I'm crossing my fingers.
Ugh. I'm glad I got out yesterday at 66.50. Today is going to be a mess.
TGT has performed remarkably well during this volatility. I was surprised today that there was not much reaction in the TGT price given the generally bad retail news.
"So sarha/Sean/Local Perv, now that Amazon has taken over Whole Foods, you should contact them to see what their bathroom policy is. I expect you will start a petition to boycott Amazon right after that. If you don't, you are nothing but the murderous lying hypocritical bigot you have already shown yourself to be."
Good day for TGT stock. Bad day for RWNJs. tsk tsk..
"Lol yes Doc - I was certainly wrong about $43 but jury is still out on $40. Regardless, your paper trade has worked out great in my real life. How does that make you feel? Feel free to ask for ""doctored PNG images""."
Target Corporation stock headed back to the 40's. Even a roaring stock market can't keep this p.o.s. up. Shouldn't have invited men into ladies' rooms!
What time market close today ?
Timber!!!!!!!!!!!
"Target CEO needs to go..From his transgender program which drove AWAY families, to his insistent drum banging when wal-mart and Amazon are Kicking Target in the groin. Not good looks for 2018. Go into a target store...only 6 checkout lanes open out of 15 and some were only 2-3 people waiting... Will target be the next GE, another domino falling, in the dividend cuts happening to others. A race to the bottom"
"Uhhh hey naysayers,,,,,HaHa"
This is what happens when you cross our Dear Leader.
"So, let me get this straight. Certain people on here are always saying the only reason Target stock is going up is because of company buy backs, and saying that is a terrible way to run a business and only benefits the executive team's bonus structure. Yet when Wal-Mart stock soars because of the exact same thing, they point to how much more successful Wal-Mart stock is than TGT? That doesn't sound very fair and balanced."
More stuff that never happens.http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/07/11/sheldon-fulbeck-revere-target-fitting-room-bail-revoked/
"That's what they get for letting perverts in the ladies room. Wish it would drop another 20 points, maybe they will get the message."
"Sarah hates anyone who isn't a devoted pv55ygrabberist, who doesn't think that white Christians are superior to other people, and who thinks that government is useful sometimes.In other words, Sarah is an extremist who hates the majority of regular Americans."
Now that tgt has gone up 20 percent we should expect the bankers and bears sterns cramer to upgrade and beg us to buy TGT.
at 103 this is the greatest short gift in the market. I am short 4000.
"Ark, Dave, Anon .... I'm still here and holding Target. Still shopping there and waiting for $80! Enjoying the shopping and dividend in the meantime"
Target is up 4.91% to 171.05
MEGA PONZI SCHEME FRAUD HERE ...Criminal banksters stealing YOUR money while you get this astronomical overpriced scam
"Good luck to regular TGT investors here. I'll be watching it closely, If there's an overreaction like there was after Q3, I'll be here to take advantage of that. If TGT goes up tomorrow big, well.. then I'd have missed the boat."
Now is time to buy. Just think if you bought AAPL or Walmart on every dip in the past 10 years.
with the next stimulus plan on the horizon you don't think $TGT guidance will be bad. of course not. this will break 52 week high and run!
"Every day we get another big name liberal Democrat exposed as a predator. Russell Simmons, Bill Clinton (old news), Matt Lauer, John Conyers, Harvey Weinstein, Russell Simmons, the list goes on and on. If you stop to consider that this is the same party seeking to force women and young girls to accept men into locker rooms, bathrooms, showers, fitting rooms, etc then you will probably start to catch on."
Targoat
Over 79% of the stock is held by institutional investors.That is a huge percentage by any measure.
Lowes sales are up...Dollar Tree..up...Best Buy ...(ex. Samsung)....up...but Target down...wonder why?could it be the millions of customers.. alienated by the CEO...politics
"This board continues to be a hoot! Does anyone else get a chuckle over the fact that we're hearing all of this anti-Trans fire-and-brimstone statements come from a GUY who uses a variant of ""Sarah"" for his name?!"
"Why anybody would sell Target today, the ex-dividend date, and not get the dividend payment, is not financially savvy. Traditionally, you see may see a share price decline the day after the ex-dividend date. However, in this case, the ex date is also the earnings release date."
"Who are winners if TGT is a loser? WMT obviously a winner. Costs are up? So what, margins should be way up."
"Just some fun facts as we wait for the 60s that are coming. TGT buys back and retires approximately 145,000 shares every day the market is open. TGT has about 550 million shares outstanding while WMT has over 3 billion. My local target has a brand new Starbucks in it. My local WMT has the cash me outside girl in it. My local TGT does not sell NASCAR t shirts. My local WMT has about 18 women I mistake"
Buy on the over-reaction. It will come back to yesterdays price within a week.
It beat expectations
When I shop at TGT more than 90% of stuff came from China. I ain't paying extra 25% sales tax. I will shop everything at thrift shop.
Why isn't Target providing kittly litter boxes for its transpecies customers? Is it because of.....BIGOTRY???????https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3419631/Woman-says-s-CAT-trapped-human-body.html
I am surprised TGT didn't drop more after Kroger news. I sold at 9:30 sharp but tbh it's doing a lot better than I thought it would.
If market goes red... this will be down 2 points or more
I support funding for scientific and medical research into the causes and treatment for bathroom panic. Damn!

"I don't see any news driving TGT up today, but it is nice."
Shouldn't Target be in the 60s by now? I think so. I'm optimistic longs might see $70s before the year us up.
way overbought. heading to 90 eventually tho
Wanna make a bet LO? I say this stock hits 60 before it hits 50. Its only 3.63 at the time Im typing this away from you winning. Let me do the math real quick. Im 6.37 away from winning so the odds are in your favor. How about the loser admits they were wrong and then never posts on this site again? Are your big repub balls big 'nuff?
I expect to buy close to $800 worth of goods from Target tomorrow using my 20% off. And I am not even a stockholder. Margins are going to be thin but I expect their Q4 sales to be higher than expected.
"buy TGT now, because everything of retailers have been bottomed out, Amazon effort has been end, because Amazon profit too bad, Amazon don't have enough money to play retailers again."
"People forget that this market was up because of stimulus money. If government will not give more free money, and inflation remains high then all retail stores will loose value. Good luck investors."
retail earnings have all come in great so far. I expect the same here Wednesday
"why some investors still buy and holding this stock after it's earnings warning, most of companies will down 40 percent after it's earnings warning if it doesn't have real good news, l don't think tgt have real good news in future, because Amazon too strong and continue strong,"
"Zacks Ranks Target a ""strong sell""."
isn't share price supposed to go down and readjust itself after dividend is payed out?
has Sen FranKenboobhandler come back to Minnesota to face his family? let's see now 7 women got freaked out by Frankenpervert US senator... don't think they like short Curly scarry kisser want a be politician.
Astonishing run and strength here...the future is bright and Target definitely hit a bulls eye! Don't sweat the inevitable short-term 5-10% drop...that will be the time to average down or load up more! This is going over $200 by the end of the year!
"The longer Target keeps the bathroom policy, the more days like today will happen. Completely boycott related."
Dr PantCrapper - I'd worry less about what Anon said and more about your paper investments. I just saying. Ask me to elaborate with soul crushing imgurs of my open trade.. if what I'm saying is not clear to you.

"The pv55y grabber's misdeeds are being exposed, and TGT continues to go up!Tough days to be an RWNJ."
"Unfortunately, Trump's revival of the American economy has a downside, and that means some undeserving companies like Target will benefit. Target's bigoted, dangerous policy of allowing all men, including sex offenders, voyeurs, and potential rapists into their ladies' rooms, without warning to their female customers, continues to put women and girls at risk. As evidenced, of course, by the dozens of arrests in Target ladies' rooms, so willing covered up by a compliant media complicit with the Democratic Party agenda."
"Listen all Target Shareholders. I am not one, though one of my sons was store manager in Asheville, NC some years ago and left due to how corporate ""does business""... But I write as a US small business owner and contracting firm owner in Hickory, NC metro area regarding Target (and several other major retailers) who all are/have been contracting with a Ferrandino & Sons, Inc firm for all their in-store maintenance and repairs and renovation work- and Ferrandino is NOT any sort of true Contracting firm. They are a scam outfit unethically profitting hugely, and there is going to be a major upheaval coming from Thousands of US licensed contracting type businesses against them and those whom the true contractor are/have performed various work for which these major retailers are/have been benefitting from- YET these contractors are not/have not been paid long after Ferrandino receives up to 700% markup payments from Target corp and others! And the process has been benefitting top executives at these retailers ! Any retailer who is profitting from work others performed in their stores, yet have not paid the actual contractor who performed said work, is criminal ! THESE retailers wouldn't let anyone walk out of their stores without paying. Why are these retailers NOT paying contracting firms who performed work for the benefit of their store operations? Talk about next credit bubble, recession, etc coming... There are Thousands of US small businesses and families and employees now being affected because Target and other retailers corps are screwing them over for $Millions in work orders at these retail stores or more in unpaid work at these stores... and this Ferrandino outfit is raking in $Millions from these retailers and not paying the party to whom the work was done for said retailers. Why do these retailers and others use 3rd party scam outfits which are causing said retailers to lose $Tens of Millions annually, and simply should work directly to local licensed contracting firms for needed repair work and not use a middle man. Without going into details further, in our businesses' case, the NC Dept. of Revenue is already investigating this Ferrandino & Sons out of New York, regarding work business practices done at the Valley Hills Mall Target in Hickory, NC... And to Cramer's points and others, if anyone was upset seeing what the ""Amazon Effect"" has been to US retailers, this matter when hitting the national news airwaves will completely destroy what's left in most US retailers and prove how corrupt corporate greed has gotten today everywhere... Already many people have been forced into bankruptcy due to this situation, businesses forced to close down, all because these major retailers have NOT paid the contractors through their 3rd party facilitator they all contract with (Ferrandino). Partial list of known retailers who use this Ferrandino & Sons, Inc out of New York are: Target Corp. AMC Theaters Walgreens CVS Home Depot Lowes JC Penneys US Banks Others..."
Cash balance dropped dramatically.
"This is a Real American Success Story! We can buy Chinese goods and sell (retail service) them at a perfect profit margin for massive profits that are only minimally impacted by Trade Tariff Trumpster and his Ultra-Contained Dumpster Fire...and it's More Revenue Brand New Pair of Shoes kind of future expectations with zero lamentations...2020 is already written and the tape is Red, because the arrow pierced and the body is bled..."

Slow correction here will be both good for the longs and shorts. I suggest take your profits here and and pick it back up at $98. Happy hunting!
The Target Boycott has failed. Boycott organizers go home.
Tax cuts help the economy because tax payers spend money much more productively than the government does.
Not hard to see why this stock will continue to rise just by regularly visiting Target. $200+ here we comes.
"Imagine waking up everyday and posting negative comments about bathrooms in a retail store. Imagine having written 4000 comments in 9 months telling everyone that Target is a horrible store with a massive ""active boycott"". Ok.. now imagine doing all of that but denying ever having betted against TGT. That's Mr. LyingRegressivePantCrapper. All of that talk for 9 months meant nothing at all. ""FOLKS, I just want you to know that all that bathroom talk meant nothing, I never had the balls to short TGT."""
"For reasons I won’t get into (use your imagination) my daughter has had a problem using public facilities since she was 14. She was 16 before she would use a public restroom. To this day she wears her swimsuit to the pool, removes her street clothes, swims then showers in her swimsuit, dries of and then puts here street clothes back on over her swimsuit. I will not take her anywhere she has to suffer the trauma of finding a man in the bathroom or locker room. More than 20% of girls 18 have suffered the same trauma as my daughter, many suffer from PTSD. What about them? Where is the compassion for them? What about their rights to feel safe?"
"LOL. I have not seen such manipulation in a while. The S&P just took a dollar drop in 5 min, and TGT is still just bumbling along sideways. Yeah, ok, hahah. Buy your puts now while they're cheap. I sold my calls this morning. Play both sides, friends."

"Good news! The mayor of Oakland, California says she's willing to be arrested in order to protect from deportation the illegal aliens that the Democratic Party depends on to stay in power! Let's grant her wish, President Trump!"
Seems like analysts are raising po targets but still recommending hold in case consumer confidence changes??
"This stock always seems to spike up on earnings and all kinds of pumping articles then ends the day red.,,"
I own Cost stock but TGT seems way undervalued. Now that they posted an earnings beat and are executing online sales increases it seems to this should be valued like other competitors. No wonder the upgrade to $100 and it would still be under a pe of 20.

I see all Trumpanzees are obsessed with bathroom issues and policies. They want transgenders to use the bathrooms that are NOT practical for their changed anatomy so that these religious perverts can sexually abuse them the way their leader Trump the sexual predator used to attack the women.
"Stopped by Target today, saved $0.53 on a small bottle of A-1 Steak Sauce, My wife and daughter got a free exposure to a sex offender invited into the ladies' rooms by Target management. Very exciting!"
"Hey, I know how Target can recover! Why don't they institute a policy that is bound to alienate half its customers and drive them away! Permanently! That should help!Oh wait, they already did that! Never mind!"

About 20 containers in parking lot in front of store trying to get ahead of tariffs.
"""9"" and still COUNTING! LOL."
everyone telling great stories about TGT but the price keeps moving lower. what's going on here?
When does the CEO firing get announced?
Hopefully tgt will run up to earnings. Wmt reports on the 15th. I think we run up to $88 prior to the Aug. 21st earnings report and don't forget the divvy the 20th ex date. jmho
"It is important to remember that Marshalls, Ross, and TJMaxx all allow men, including quite possibly registered sex offenders, into bathrooms and dressing rooms where women and young girls undress and use the bathroom. All of these stores have had men arrested for peeping and recording women and young girls in various stages of undress. Any woman who would bring themselves or their young daughters into such places should be aware that their right to privacy does not exist, and they are placing themselves and their children at needless risk.Kohls has a policy against men in ladies bathrooms and dressing rooms. If you must shop in person, I suggest you shop there."
"While you're enjoying your Delusions, I'll wait."
"FINALLY got paid off for my short stance on tgt. I covered at $175.01 and hit some insane puts that just skyrocketed. I'm out for now, this volatility is just insane this could go below 170 or back to 180s."
they keep trying to push this stock higher
you ever shop in target? ever buy anything online from target? you know how long their system takes to update that you ordered something?
just a few more days and you can see the what happened to the stock comments coming out in force-- we don't understand why it is falling so fast -- stop listening to CNBC brokers fund managers and certified financial planners learn how things really work and start making money
$TGT is meeting the target on every quarters from now on.
CHOO CHOOO!!!!!
Best time to short at open! Profit takers will giveback soon enough. Last chance to short in 100s
"Was I the first person here to say ""NAMBLA""? Do I say ""NAMBLA"" several times a day? That is ONLY because I am a proud member. LOL ;)"
There are lots of stores that have changing rooms and bathrooms that are for both sexes. They make them very private so no one feels uncomfortable. You people need to get a life and a grip.
"Of course, one thing we know about Artie and the NUT JOB: none of the women whose victimization was eased by Target's dangerous policies will get the slightest bit of sympathy from them, because politics is far more important to Artie and the NUT JOB (and Ronald) than anyone's individual rights."
"Gee, what could go wrong here? Liberal transgender insanity get institutionalized.http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/02/transgender-oregon-prisoner-transferred-womens-facility/"
"So sad how ""Low"" the stock is on Target! I hope the Company ""Fix""s the ""Problem""! It a nice place to shop and where u use there card u get a nice ""Little"" Discount! I notice Middle or High Class People shop at TargetWork Hard Target You Can Build Up your Company. Atmosphere in Target is so much ""Better""!"
"This stock will continue up from here. Strong support around 115-116. Did not even test 113 again with good amount of long term call flow. Still profitable company, and affirmed guidance. This stock will rebound by next earnings. If you want you can buy in now and sell before."
.......... tgt has 3 big gaps below ---all companies fill there gaps ---tom today is a good day to take some profits ---good luck
A really bad move by TGT on raising wages.Driving their costs right on up
"tgt looks tail down, do not tailgate,"
"Target has quality merchandise, a great selection and lots of color....Stores are super busy and noticeably not over stocked. I have bought several things there that I would normally bought at Costco. One other kinda crazy thing that happened with one of my wife's clients....She asked me If I saw the one piece jumper outfit the girl was wearing?(very nice). She said she bought it a Target. These girls are not Target clothing shoppers. They shop Nordstrom's, Macy's, Forever 21 and so on...She then said I am shopping at the wrong stores!"
"""Repurchases of 5.6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $52.45, for a total investment of $296 million.""WOW that would bring shares outstanding to around 545M and a repurchase of over 1% for the qtr!!!! Only the idiot sarah would think thats a bad thing bwahahahahaha ahahahahah"
I wonder why TGT went bankrupt in Canada. Makes nonsense when u see these numbers
"until, and if, the market gets a strong sentiment back, it will be hard for TGT to go anywhere"
"I understand why people were buying last two days. But who was selling? Obviously, shorts that had to cover. But I think it is mostly those looking to buy back on the pull back. You know, sell into strength, buy into weakness. Maybe today, or sometime next week."
"Obviously Target is doing great. These stores are all over the USA, and they're wonderful. People love shopping there. Also the dividend is bountiful. Ignore the angry people on this Board who have some typen of bizarre anti-Target agenda. We are investors first and foremost."
"Lol, they say the stock is down because the company announced that they will spend $4 b..."
"How about something more recent, under current age of consent laws, such as this fine baptist xtian manhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore"
PE of 10 and 4% dividend yield. Thanks Amazon! WAY OVERSOLD!
"Sales tax law has been approved by the courts, online must have a presents in the state or pay the sales tax. Now is the time for Amazon to buy TGT."
"Sarah's out of his/er gourd again with crazy conspiracy theories about ""illegals voting"". Too much bourbon in the eggnog, I guess? ;)"
"libt4rd Ark, obviously there is a major problem with TGT since it is down almost 20 percent at a time when the market overall has soared over 20 percent, and it's major competitors are up 30 percent. That's the definition of a problem."
"28% online YoY is very goodthink if they pulled that off for 10 years, plus they have the store for returns and so people can see the product1.28** 10 years = 11.8So their online sales alone could be up by a factor of 11.8I think it might be around 12% now (anyone?)12 x 11.8 = 144 about 1.4444% more revenue overall in 10 years but same the in store revenues are up as wellthat they came back to the 28% YoY online sales is a big deallook at AMZN's PE"
go target popping off due to that good quarter! congrats!
The Boycott is officially over.

Sold shares at 154. Earnings not sustainable through 3q
and guys on CNBC said sell target don't listen to them
"TGT is going down sadly, Shipping has utterly failed and amazon is now giving 1 day free delivery for prime."
Target is going to be able to scale the heck out of “All in motion”... Im excited to see what they do as activewear is about 20% of their business. The clothes look acceptably fashionable as well! I think we take all market share from under armour in the next 2 years. Nike will be a bigger challenge but i still think Nike is coming to Target.... wierd that “all in motion” wont consist of shoes. Leaves to me believe a deal is still to be signed!
uptrend
"Marketwatch posts story where Target is having trouble with selling groceries, yeah, I bet they are. The boycott and the #FlushTarget movement ARE DOING DAMAGE. Yeah I see Target has recovered half of their losses but I won't be shopping there for as long as that left-wing lunatic CEO is running the place."
"I think WMT will beat earnings, and both WMT and TGT will pull back at the open on Thursday."
"For those who missed it:Sarah confessed yesterday that s/he thinks that Americans who don't think that the Pv55y Grabber is a ""hero"" (i.e. the majority of Americans) are not ""real Americans"".If you were looking for an indicator of how much contempt these RWNJs have for the majority of Americans who don't agree with their cult, you couldn't do much better than this!"
Down another percentage point in after hours. The boycott is making its presence known. Continue friends. Boycott Target!
$140+ by September.
"Target was in the $70s when they started making statements about bathroom issues. Since then they have failed to exit the $50s. Part of this is trying to catch up to AMZN and WMT, and part is apparently due to unwise stances on political issues, which is no place for publically owned business. The CEOs do not have a right to put the stock holders and employees at risk for their personal political views. The company is NOT theirs to make a political statement it belongs to the shareholders and the employees. Just a question, how much of TGT's drop in stock price would you attribute to their foolish stances on bathroom issues? Certainly there are millions that have not set foot in Target since. Would you say 50% of the drop? 80% of the drop? What do you think?"
Overbought big time...don’t be left holding the bag
"Target is heading to the right direction by opening more stores in the cities and college towns. People in the cities or near college towns most of the time buys thing from the shelves. Instead of getting packages shipped and gets stolen, people in the city actually would like to go to the store and buy the stuff right off the shelves. Brick and mortar stores won't be gone, if they are, Target can literally make each of their stores as a distribution center and can make delivery even much quicker than amazon."
"Bought 1,225 shares @ $116.60 LOL lets see if we can day trade this for a profit lol"
Target diving down to the 60's again. Looks like truth is winning!
Missed the earnings.Let’s ride down.
GS just initiated a conviction BUY rating on TGT with a 102 price target. Congratulations longs!
What an insane statement by Trump. Gotta love it when you have puts and the guy causes a major sell off
OMG thank you LocalOwner/sarha for the link again to a crime committed in a Walmart bathroom. WALMART Hahahaha. Busy Sunday? Sarha and his disciple are taking turns posting and thumbing each other. Such love!
tgt is all about online ...offline ....always tgt stores r fully packed ...
"To all you losers Target haters, look at the price, its only going to continue to climb. You guys have to grow up. Nobody is raping anyone in the bathroom."
JP Morgan Upgrade and 100 PT
Won't Target be cleaning up with the mad panic at grocery stores for basic supplies? expect a blow-out quarter.
It's just a matter of time till one of these sweet children are
"Added 700 shares on this dip. Overreaction to target business plan that’s proven to be successful. Stupid market. This is going higher, much higher!! I have no issue waiting for 2-3yrs to see it at $300 easy"
"So endangering women in ladies' rooms is now called ""progress""? Over two dozen men arrested in Target ladies' rooms in the last year. How many at Walmart? 1? Traffic up at Walmart, down at Target. Walmart setting new highs daily, Target off 30 percent in one year and still going down. You have got to be psychotically delusional to believe in this stock or the tranny dogma."
back to $100 end of this month
"Does anyone see a New Years sell-off coming? Or has it already occurred? Looking to get in on $TGT, just not sure if now is a good time or not."
"Sarah is really doubling down on the ""deep state"" conspiracy theories lately.Maybe it's because it's become so abundantly clear that the ""boycott"" was a ""nothing burger"". Maybe it's because ""the memo"" turned out to be a ""nothing burger"". Maybe it's just that time of the month. ;)"
Selloff will continue into tomorrow.
Wow. Sarah is really being defiant about refusing to admit that Kim really grabbed the Pornstarfvçker by the pv55y!
One thing you'll notice about Artie if you hang out here long enough is that he always sells the highs and buys the lows. At least that's what he always says.
Sold out my 2000 shares at $102.25. Bought it a few weeks back at $85.
"Target has a good long term plan. Will come out with a dozen new exclusive brands. Probably good for long term investors. Good digital plan and will fare well in the e-commerce sector. Probably better to oust CEO and back track on transgender controversy. Bring back the customers - liberal and conservative, democrat, republican, independent, communist , everybody. Al Sharpton and David Duke. Everybody welcome to shop."
Will this hit 20%?
"Sell, Sell, Sell FDX ...ASAP"
So is this going down today to come back up at some point today or who thinks is going to start trend back to 95
"With March almost over TGT is completing solar installation at 3 of their stores in just my home state of CO. What awesome things are they doing in your state? More stores are getting them here in CO later this year also. Aurora South, at 15700 East Briarwood Circle, expected completion in March.Arapahoe, at 6767 South Clinton St. in Englewood, expected completion in March.Arvada, at 7899 Wadsworth Blvd., expected completion in March."
Stay away from this stock. The TGT market maker intentionally will prop up price to get new investor money and will then push price down sharply for Capitulation.

This is a great long term hold.

"My understanding is that a lot of the mentally ill RWNJs who support the pv55y grabber also believe in this crazy theory about a ""rapture"". Part of the reason that they support the pv55y grabber's efforts to start religious wars in the middle east is because they believe that will accelerated the ""rapture"".I grew up going to church in a conservative small town in flyover land, and though there's always been some amount of nut jobbery like this, I'm astounded that 30 years later it's become commonplace enough that these nut jobs have actually managed to influence US foreign policy based on such nut job ideas."
"PINS heading to $50 in a couple q , hot buyouts target too $WMT $TGT $AMZN $FB better now"
"I believe TGT will go higher although not in a straight line.. I am sure there will be hurdles. When TGT drops, bathroom maggots are going to crawl out of their holes and say something about bathrooms, boycott, ""little girls"", Trump, Obama, Hillary and they will say demeaning things about gays and trans people. They are most certainly going to remind you that saying those words doesn't make them bigots. If you are new to this board, don't be surprised by any of it because this is just how it goes here."
Gosh dang it... investors need to calm down from this doomed & gloomed market selloff just because the Coronavirus lands in the US now! The CDC has reported the flu virus killed 20k people alone in 2019... and the market did spectacular last year.
Recent share decline seems overly pessimistic for such a blue chip retailer - I just bought my first block at under $114!
The effects of the Target boycott continue to be seen and it will continue until Target changes it policy and CEO. I look for Target stock to drop back to the low $60.
"Did anyone see the headlines? TGT is opening their own food line, talk about future guidance, this puppy is going to pop big time Wed. morning."
"I support the protestors. But dear lord why could they not loot the Walmart instead. My precious stock! Thank god for stop-losses set at 90 day orders. Sorry fellow bagholders but 200 stores closed down and Targets losing inventory everywhere, stores being destroyed, and the continued unrest of unemployed and angry Americans. On top of that, the delay of inventory deliveries. Target will have a bad month start of the new quarter. What do you think will happen 2nd quarter? This stock will go down to $80."
I expect 88 by Wednesday morning
"I believe Target and Walmart has seen peak numbers last year. and trendy retailers such as Kohl's will see big rebounds this year for the back to work, traveling, and going out wardrobes"
Trumpanzee America is like a Christian version of Pakistan.
Great move for TGT. Been in this name decades! Will take a few bucks off table today. It is OK to take profits occasionally.

Good morning everyone!
"How about target, endorsing the biggest enemy of the traditional family. This group they endorsed hates calling people mother and father, they hate religion, and they teach our children to be promiscusous, and want all of us to be like them. Consider investing and shopping elsewhere."
Too much risk to hold Target TGT at this price level.
"Deceptive, my brother! Great to see you’re still posting here and voicing your opinion on the boycott!"
Is Target still allowing men to use the women's changing rooms and bathrooms?
Almost bought this when it was 133. Glad I did not.
"The ""bathroom Betty"" says that other people are posting too much ""irrelevant drivel"".You can't make this kind of stuff up. This board is a real hoot again lately!"
1.82 vs 1.62 expected
This stock jumped 20 percent... you really didn’t expect a 3-5 percent pullback?
did anyone hear or read that Target made more in 2020 than the last 11 years combined?
Great strategic acquisition today by Target to increase their efficiencies in online and home delivery. This should help strengthen their future position.
"Kevin, don’t fall for the human caused climate change BS. That’s just globalists attempts to take away our freedoms, allegedly, for the greater good. A scam. Humans can’t control the ever changing climate. It’s just a way to get your money."

I have called off the Boycott - so it's time for everybody to go back to Target to shop, have coffee and cake in the Target Cafe, and Yes - by all means - go to the bathroom and take care of personal business. You'll be in 7th Heaven as the bathrooms are the cleanest in the country - next to McDonald's (in my humble opinion.)"

Target to close many stores after the holiday season. The reason you ask? The boycott. Billions of lost revenue. Shareholders should be furious.
Guys I work there and can tell you as soon as pandemic is over the retail same store sales will fall back down to a more normal level fair value for my company is 125$
"I have to say some of the gestures of American corporations are really impressing me. I know its business and its about profit and capitalism, but Im genuinely impressed by the humanity of many decisions being made by corporate boards across America. Its obvious some of these top tier executives love their business, but love their people , workers and customers as much. They genuinely value them and enjoy providing a service in both good times and bad times. They can worry about the balance sheet outcome after, but for now some are just acting for the benefit of society right now. Bless them , their families and all . GLTA"
I see Yahoo is back to censoring posts again....

LOL. You, however, can't even swing a LWNJ PSHPT tgt chatterboard. BUWAHAHAHAAAA HAAAAAA HAAAAAAA."
they this will be a 10 dollar swing. I think it will go up 10 not down. corona is baked in and people are buying at target and Costco for supplies. it was 118 b4 the scare shud go rite back up there.
Reports great news and down premarket. I just bought some.
"I'm honestly convinced that the Dow could drop back to $10k and p.g.-lovers like Sarah would still be pontificating about how great ""their 401k"" is doing. They'd also continue to claim that the corresponding drop in TGT share price was due to a so-called ""boycott"". ;)"
target will keep making money as people move outdoors and purchase everything that accompanies such a move....food wine clothing outdoor entertainment equipment electronics....
"It takes a special kind of stüpid to think that the so-called ""boycott"" is having an effect on Target (whose revenue is actually still rising), but fail to recognize that the entire market (and eventually main street economy) is being wrecked by the pvssygrabber's reckless economic policies."
what an incredible reversal of fortunes. I was up almost 70 percent in this thing and most has come back
"Solidly run company. Survived the pandemic and transition to online/curbside. Once everyone ready to go out again, the stores will be flooded due to the good in-store experience. Price should continue trajectory in coming year(s)."

Sell !!! The New China tariffs will send this back down
"It happens every time the Democrats take the House and appoint the Crypt Keeper as House Speaker. Investors see 2 years of grid lock and partisan squabbling, best case scenario, and sell everything."
More transgender bathrooms and fitting rooms are certainly the way to increase sales! Let's double down on stupid! Just more of corporate America allowing a political activist to pose as a CEO and run another company into the ground.
"Okay, I'm interested in dropping a few grand on this stock. I'm not asking for predictions, but based on a few minutes reviewing the chart, this stock looks a little cyclical, usually bottoming out around end of Jan-Feb... I know they are greatly benefitting from COVID right now, but with being up nearly 50% in the last year, do we think this is currently a good buy price, or should I wait until Jan-Feb for a dip? Do we think this will react like what's happening with tech stocks... where after an amazing quarter there is still a sell-off? Any longterm TGT investors have any insight?"
"sarha and Deceptive - you guys remind of this 75 year old guy in DC who has been protesting for last 20 years. Everyday he takes a bus from his house in Baltimore and goes to DC to protest. Just him, no one else. It's a sad story - he was abused as a teen by a catholic priest so actually I get why he is hurting and he chooses to protest outside the Vatican Embassy in DC every single day. You two fools on the other hand are total nutcases."
A few 5% down days and this will start to look interesting.
"My stops pulled me out of TGT last week after being up almost 13%. Looking at their peers, everybody had lagging holiday sales, because there were six fewer days to shop and not ""must have"" toy during Christmas. Where it counts they indicated that they're winning online sales, where we want them to compete vs AMZN. I'm entering a new long position at $116 as the stock is on sale big time today. You can still make money on TGT stock it rises, don't forget to put your stops in."
What is with the abnormally slow volume over the last few days?
The left boycotts and turns products in to best sellers. We kill stores....
This stock will hit $60 by end of Sept.
Wow. All time all time high ever.
Good opportunity to get it at lower price. Will recover most of the losses by end of day
"This stock is in trouble. If WMT and HD can’t go up in good earnings, imagine TGT."
"If you like America, boycott Amazon. It is a cancer that is eating its way through America. It will destroy jobs and stores."
WALMART GOT SMOKED WITH GOOD EARNINGS ALSO.
"70 was support ... that was broken. 70 is now resistance, and 62 next support."
MAY START A POSITION BUT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE 94 AREA.
TGT has delivered the wrong item for my daughters bathroom 2 times.... and both times they say just keep the items deliveredToday they delivered the item in question via FedEx next day service..... cost of other items and 3 deliveries far more than the cost.... let alone profit on the original item....Sounds like old school business.... take a loss on every item.... but make it up on volume
Up this much in pre market is insane. Good luck buying it here.
mm's walked that down pretty fast ...
TGT will head towards the same trajectory as WMT as of now. Red all day.
I like Donald Trump and I like Target as a solid blue chip dividend paying investment. Great retailer! I don't blend politics with investing.
THANK YOU FOR THE DIP IN TARGET....I ONLY BUY WHEN EVERY ONE ELSE HAS FEAR. THANKS FOR THE ENTRY POINT AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY IN AT LOWER LEVELS. YES I AM ANGRY CRAZY THIS MRONING.
"Terrible day on wall street and TGT is barely down. Does this mean that the so-called ""boycott"" is falling apart?"

heading into best quarters yet....back to school and then holidays....only upside from here!
I saw Lindsey Buckingham at a Target once. Worth at least 2 bucks in TGT cred
"It was just bad PR on the Mgmt's part to even get involved in the whole bathroom issue. They clearly took sides, that was unfortunate. They are now paying with their revenue. My guess, the CEO who made that call will be gone in the next few QTRS, if the stock continues to slide."
"Problem for target is the eventuality that they are a French company and they import Chinese goodsto the U.S. Soon, the middle class Walmart will have rising priced goods and lower profits. Target rents most of their stores, while Walmart owns theirs, a big advantage. No time in history has any retailer who rented almost all of their space ever survived. It's just a matter of time."
This message board is sad. The bots and strong political stuff is childish and just silly. Yahoo fix your service!
Well sell off into the close
"Target is the best blue chip retailer in the country! Back up the truck, Boys! Also - cleanest rest-rooms in the country! The porcelain bowls are polished white! The porcelain bowls in the Target rest-rooms are clean enough to eat off of. I'm willing to do that to demonstrate to the country just how good the Target rest-rooms are. Also nicest people you'll ever see are in Target, and naturally some of those people use the rest-rooms."
I see Yahoo! is censoring posts that criticize Target's pro-pervert policy. Two loser pro-pervert companies helping each other out. How's that working out for ya?
what do you guys think when will it go back to $57 at least?
"Stock performance since April 2016, when Target announced that women in their stores no longer had rights to privacy and safety in the ladies rooms:- TGT -1 %- WMT +60 %Any questions?"
Stop waiting on BABYF bc that train is starting to leave the station. Choo choo. No thumbs down or negative comments until you at least go look at it! If you don’t find it compelling after that then fire away with negative comments.
"Lol BigQ, ""judging""!?!?!? That is the first lie an offended Atheist Socialist LWNJ throws at someone hoping they'd stumble and fall. LOL.Reading is fundamental and comprehension is very important. These two things you lack. Statements of ""TRUTH"", tell the facts of reality. Maybe you and your clan of Homosexual Transgender Pedophile Atheist Socialist NAMBLA member Sickos should research Bible verses on ""Truth"". Then you will find:1. Men CANNOT BECOME WOMEN.2. WOMEN CANNOT BECOME MEN.3. Homosexuality is an ABOMINATION in the eyes of God.4. DNA is proven scientific fact that shows there IS NO GAY GENE.5. TGT's Bathroom Policy allows any man to enter a woman's Bathroom or Changing no questions asked.6. God wants to save all, however, if you do not believe in Him, you and your buddies here deny Him, mock Him, and curse Him and His people here, you obviously don't want to be saved."
"Even given the large gap up, TGT still tracking well well below the QQQ on the year. Yikes."
Feel the burn shorties. Told ya so.
goin' down faster than Monica Lewinsky.
this might drop below $100 later today.wouldn't be surprised to see $95 this afternoon or tomorrow.
Anyone understand what the drop today is all about?
So the Target grocery manager has been let go due to bad sales. This is equivalent to replacing the dishwasher because the air conditioner is broken. Target Board- WAKE UP and fire Cornell!
Wow impressive. Congrats to longs!
Everything is made in China. Over done on short covering mid 90’s this week. Flash crash could also happen at anytime

As soon as Powell speaks markets go south Know fact every time
"If you want to know the performance of retail stock, simply visit their stores and observe. Traffic, customer enthusiasm and checkout lines will tell you everything, and if you have visited Target stores, you will know that they are always filled up with people, no matter the time or day of the week. Enthusiasm is great, mood is positive and cashiers are always busy. That translates into lot of sales. Thats just offline sales. Now combine that with online sales. You go to other stores like Macy, Kohl's etc,,,,ehhhh not so much.Expect another blowout quarter!"

Tgt is down while the DOW is up. Get out now before the pullback Down. I warned you yesterday.
"As predicted, the boycott remains Target’s biggest problem. Millions of people are no longer shopping at Target. The stock will continue to sink, day after day."
"Some of the things said here are pretty embarrassing but nothing tops a troll claiming to have ""a medical career"". Dr. PantCrappingRegressive, I have no problem with your religion but your numerous posts have persuaded me to shop at Target way more often than I used to. Not a loyal TGT investor but Costco misses my business. Must be my low IQ and Schizophrenia, right doc?"
"Greetings DD, sarha, you think and the other fighters of truth and justice! I've been enjoying myself with family and friends this week. I see the trannies continue to avoid truthful dialogue about target's insane bathroom policy, which sends out a loud invitation to mentally ill men to come to target to prey upon women and children to satisfy their desire for deviancy. Tranny Jimbo and tranny nutjob would put their daughters in a dangerous situation of following trannies into a bathroom. These are disgusting pukes. I pray they never procreate. Keep mentally ill men out of the little girls room and to he77 with target!"
Please move all social comments to an appropriate message board. Thank you.
"If anyone wants to see just how bad TDS (Trump Delusional Syndrome) has become in the RWNJ community, take a gander at Sarah's most recent comment. S/he states that s/he believes that the decline in TGT share price was due to the so-called ""boycott"". This means that s/he ""thinks"" that it's purely coincidence that the ~$4 drop occurred at exactly the same minute that the p\/55ygrabb'r Tweeted about tariffs and that it's a complete coincidence that other retailers saw similar drops at the same time. Nutty."
"Over 5,000 contracts of the January 72 calls were traded in TGT, and I am adding shares because I see this activity as institutional buying."
bought some pre market hopeful close to bottom
What Is The Retained Earnings Formula?https://www.thestockdork.com/retained-earnings-formula/
Stock up to $117/share now before close with buyers coming in. The downturn today is just a blip in the overall story.
"ok people here is another opportunity, rost buy sub 111, earnings tomorrow amc expecting $115 or better jmho"
Bought TGT back today. Sold WMT
"Any parent who would bring young children into a Target store bathroom or dressing room is knowingly exposing them to any random man, including sex offenders, who claims to ""feel like a woman today"". Such parents should be interviewed by Child Protective Services and possibly arrested."
I wouldn't be so worried about Target if they hadn't decided to invite mentally ill men into the ladies rooms . What were they thinking? Millions of people boycotting must really be hurting sales.
"Jobs keep growing, The consumer is completely fine, & Targets holiday numbers are set to come out soon. Things are going to more than okay here."
*Target walks in room
"Sold my Target shares and bought some Walmart and Apple shares this morning. Walmart has way more potential than Target, and Apple well what can I say, it’s going to skyrocket once again"
"Hey shep, the best way you could combat Amazon would be to tell retail stores like Target to stop making their stores dangerous to the public. Bezo is laughing all the way to the bank when Target decides that the rights of women and girls to their privacy doesn't matter because of the LGBTQXYZLMNOP agenda."
Man amazon has lots of transexual stuff on their site. Even have free ebooks about it if you have amazon prime. Lets start the boycott today RWNJs.
"'Terrified' at TargetOn October 16, a mother and her children went to a Target in Woburn, Massachusetts, to do some shopping. While inside the store, the mother's 10-year-old daughter entered the women's restroom where a man later offered her candy, commented on her clothing, and reportedly tried to get into the stall that the little girl was using.https://www.onenewsnow.com/culture/2018/11/01/terrified-at-target"
"If it crosses over and holds 117.20 at close, price will accelerate next few days. (Well, except Fridays which seem beyond Hope)"
"Yeah, Ferengi Tranny Quarky, my SQ investments are really suffering. So much so that they are still in the green. The highest investment or cost basis is still up over 25%. Gee, I wish I was as smart as you about investing, Ferengi Tranny Quarky.I shouldn't have bought three lots of SQ while it rose up from $11.75. I should have sold the first lot at $12.94 for a $1.19 profit like you did with your two day ownership of TGT, right oh wise and astute Ferengi Tranny Quarky aka ""Stock Market Slayer""."
So obvious. Someone is pressing down the SP to collect because they know the earnings are good.
"Maybe not a good comparison, but Macy used to be more promising at its hay time."
"Sarah is so ate-up that s/he actually believes that if you don't believe in Breitbart/Alex Jones style conspiracy theories, then you're not a real American. S/he is full of hatred and contempt for most of the ideals that Americans have held for centuries and that most real Americans still hold."
Would love to see this finish above 107 today then up tomorrow
"So, in order to show that boycotts work, Regressive brought up Chic-fil-A and how their sales increased 12% after boycott by a different group. That's an argument in FAVOR of what regular investors have been telling you trolls for months/years."
Here comes $50.00........Again...it will see $50 before $60!
"Of course, a few months ago, I realized that I can exploit your need to win.. to my advantage. I mean, if you are going to be here everyday.. almost every waking minute, then you might as well serve me. SQ is not a bad company at all and I wouldn't have shorted it if not for your regular persistence. And you keep doing. You are literally never going to stop. Some trades have been very profitable, while some others result in a minor profit. I'll take it. I'll take your criticism, I am not complaining at all."
people will buy what they want...they have many vendor choices....many choose target...the dog with the red patch is not the reason...are they buying doge because of the dog?
"There are many people who want that market go down cuz they miss their train so the only way is with the old,fake news so they can buy low and sell high guys target is gonna go up "
Boycott still going strong. Really starting to bite now. I'll be Target management wishes it had those millions of boycotting shoppers back.
"How is it that the people who think there are 57 genders, and that a man can be born with the metaphysical certitude that he's really a girl, and yet maintain that there is no difference between men and women?"

I don’t see talk about bathrooms.
Losing fast
"Uh oh, TGT is going down again. My advice to TGT shareholders is to drink heavily."
I've been wanting to buy Target all year but the debt level has stopped me. Would appreciate any serious comments on that.
"Let's be honest here. Most liberals live in a bubble of indoctrination. They beiieve whatever they are told, unquestionably, by the liberal hive mind in the media, in academia, and in other places. It is very much a cult, with very little room for independent or critical thinking. If you had told people like Ark or Dave several years ago that the cult would demand that men be allowed into ladies rooms or that two men should be ""married"", they would have called you a conservative crack pot. But one day they woke up and that's what the cult leaders were telling them, so all of the sudden that's what they believed. The question is, what will the cult leaders think of next? There are two main theories of Trump’s support. One is that a large minority of Americans — 40 percent, give or take — are racist idiots. This theory is at least tacitly endorsed by the Democratic Party and the mainstream liberal media. The other is that a large majority of this large minority are good citizens with intelligible and legitimate opinions, who so resent being regarded as racist idiots that they’ll back Trump almost regardless. They may not admire the man, but he’s on their side, he vents their frustration, he afflicts the people who think so little of them — and that’s good enough. It’s disappointing that Charlottesville hasn’t changed their minds — but then it hasn’t changed my mind either. I still think the first theory is absurd and the second theory basically correct. . . . This sense that democratic politics is futile if not downright dangerous now infuses the worldview of the country’s cultural and intellectual establishment. Trump is routinely accused of being authoritarian and anti-democratic, despite the fact that he won the election and, so far, has been checked at every point and has achieved almost nothing in policy terms. (He might wish he were an authoritarian, but he sure hasn’t been allowed to function as one.) Many of his critics, on the other hand, are anti-democratic in a deeper sense: They appear to believe that a little less than half the country doesn’t deserve the vote. The second theory — the correct theory — is a terrible indictment of the Democratic Party and much of the media. Why aren’t the intelligible and legitimate opinions of that large minority given a hearing? Why must their views be bundled reflexively into packages labelled “bigotry” and “stupidity”? Why can’t this large minority of the American people be accorded something other than pity or scorn?"

"Sarah's out of his/er gourd again today. Not surprising, since TGT's holding steady (and has even been in positive territory for quite a bit of the day), while the stock market that the pv55y grabber goosed with promises of deregulation and tax cuts (which he disingenuously referred to as tax ""reform"") is crumbling. On top of that, ""the memo"" turned out to be a ""nothing burger""/""joke"", while the ""boycott"" has failed completely.Tough times to be among the minority contingent of RWNJs in this country."
It would be sweet if target started to offer discounted delivery for disney subscribers like amazon prime. Maybe target can actually be a competitor with amazon in the long run.

In other words, you buy the brick and mortar store almost free with a proven brand and national coverage. Dirt cheap, I love it. Sell more, I will buy more."

"I am an ex-NASA engineer who worked last on the COBE mission:If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"

"On October 16, a mother and her children went to a Target in Woburn, Massachusetts, to do some shopping.

Has anyone heard from this guy who was very happy that TGT is in 50's? https://i.imgur.com/Tlm9gWF.pngI hope he's doing ok. I wonder if he thinks that TGT stock is in 60's right now. I have heard that some people believe that TGT is presently in 60's.

"One thing seems clear. Target does not intend to do a thing to win back the millions of customers they have alienated. It's great that now, after almost a year of lying to the public and their shareholders about it, they are admitting the boycott has hurt them badly, but since they can't or won't do anything effective about it, their stock will continue to crash. Liberalism is a kind of brain rot that is very hard to reverse."

"Higher dividend won't make the bathroom policy uproar go away. Anecdotal evidence from shoppers and vendors around the country indicates that TGT store traffic is still down significantly since April 28. Target has not addressed the concerns of its women shoppers re its new bathroom policy. Until they do, this stock will be under downward pressure."
"It's pretty simple: You said 4 days after your WMT recommendation.. 'wow I did great' - and then we had that back and forth.

I wasn't even planning on giving you a hard time over this anyway.. but then you complained that TGT didn't go up much in the last couple of months."

"From what I learned over the years, stocks tend to perform the opposite of what you’d think they should. When everyone thinks it should go down since it’s too high, it will go up, and vice-versa. TGT is fitting this mold with everyone trying to short it, so expect it to continue to go up."
Wow pretty insane to see Target up 15% at this stage without an acquisition in either direction.
Buy buy buy
"Target still down 2 percent since they announced in April 2016 that their female customers no longer had the right to privacy or safety in Target bathrooms and fitting rooms. This at a time where their chief competitors, Walmart and Amazon, soared. Looks like social justice in action to me."

Man I just had to run out and I came back to another 30 cents on top of the buck before I left. THIS STOCK IS ON FIRE!
Every time TGT gets above 80 something knocks it down. I was hoping this time it would be different. Love Target but not making much profit at this rate.
15% pullback already from the peak. Remember my post a couple of weeks ago. I told you all to cash out at 198 because this cannot just continue.

Reaction from market not great with good news. Kohls losing and bringing TGT with it..
"Now they are giving employees a pay raise. When they should be giving employees better training. Employees at Target are not attentive. I was at the electronic section, but there was no clerk to answer questions or assist shoppers. And everything was locked up so i had to wait for store assistance. I waited for 10 minutes as Target employees walk by but did not offer any assistance. Needless to say i shop at Best Buy for electronics. Sam Walmart used to walk the stores disguised as a customer. That is how you gain first hand knowledge of what needs fixing."
"Another day begins, and Target Corporation still is endangering its female customers and showing contempt for their rights, beliefs, and safety by allowing men into Target ladies rooms. When will the insanity end? Call Target Customer Relations at 1 (800) 440-0680 and ask them."
"Sarah and Texas are really out of their gourds today, somehow trying to conflate a random incident in a Target dressing room with the bathroom policy. I guess they couldn't find any more bathroom anecdotes, so they have to resort to this."
Target is the new Kmart... just a matter of time
"--next support is 62. --If 62 support breaks, then 59 is stronger support."
"Up more than $3!? What happened? Did a bunch of people recant their so-called ""pledge"" on the AFA website or something? ;)"
"Gee, now why is it undervalued in a 6000+ point up market?Where is the new 52 WEEK HIGH? If Target is doing so well, and a retailer like Walmart, how come Walmart, Macy's, and JWN performing better than Target?"
This message board continues to be a real hoot!
gonna sell off be carefull
"4 companies will survive when this is over. Walmart,target,Costco,Amazon. Everyone is GONE"
"Target still letting voyeurs, sex offenders, and any other random man into ladies' rooms. I wonder why Target doesn't warn its female customers about their policy? It's almost as if they're hiding something."
"Raise your hand if you bought this stock just because of the bathrooms? Haha, I'm starting to think so given the comments on here, wow."

"Hey sahra/Sean/Local Perv, how is your protest against Amazon going? Did you cancel your Prime membership yet, and tell them why? What was their response? Just as a reminder, here is an excerpt from their website and you can scroll down to see their support for trans people:https://www.amazon.com/b?node=10080092011#building-community Oh man, that has just got to burn you so bad coming from the company you ""love"", so much more drastic than what Target did. Let us know how many signatures the petition to boycott them gets!"
"It shouldn't be a surprise that someone who's RWNJ enough to believe that ""there were thousands moozlums celebrating on the streets of NJ after 9/11"" also believes that the LGBT movement has a hidden agenda to normalize pedophilia. It's frightening that people who can't make any distinction between relations involving consenting adults and pedophilia are allowed anywhere near children."
Should be 200 by now...way undervalued!!!
So a bit ago I told you guys about a bottle of A1 on sale at Safeway for 4.99 and at TGT for 3.19. Not fake news but real prices. Anyway my brand new 2017 GMC truck needs an oil change. It takes DEXOS 5-30 and the Pennzoil Platinum costs $9.99/q at Orileys auto parts. I just paid 6.49 a quart at TGT. They dont sell the filters at my local TGT so you might have to make 2 stops but at those savings its worth it. Any DIY guys/girls who do their own oil changes dont get ripped off at your local auto part stores.
So are the same store sales increase one-off or not??
"@sarha show any verifiable evidence that there has been a statistical increase in sexual assaults in Targets since the policy was publicized. You make the claim, the burden is on you to provide the evidence to support it. You know you can't so you will just ignore this and call me a bunch of names. Answer why Texas was unable to pass the law if it is such a mainstream belief."
"Whatever. Retail sales reporting for US is not looking good. Shorted at 77.20 this morning. Given the weakness of other retailers today, ETF selling pushes this down. LONG TERM, I love TGT. Trading wise, not so much. good luck y'all"

"Sarah, it's _the people_ who are going to ""pull the plug"". They're realizing that he doesn't have their backs. It took the rubes in flyover land a little while to figure it out, but they have to be coming to the conclusion that they've really just been grabb'd by the p\/55y."
Live from target stores everywhere:
Volume is relatively light. Selling ahead of Walmart earnings? Although Walmart isn’t down that much
Meanwhile at Wal Mart... I drive right by the Target at which I used to shop to go to Wal Mart. Middle of the day & not a parking spot to be found. The lack of customer traffic isn't due to retail sales...
"all retail up.. Shorts are forced to cover. Selling is off... From now on,, everyone is buying"
Can’t believe I missed $tgt and $low 15 points wow that would of been a great morning y’all lucky
keep falling you dog!
Glad to see Target finally get some respect. Their PE ratio is still lower than any other stock I own. The stock price should be much higher still.
"Damn, my stops triggered today and made a good profit (12.7%) but I'm concerned TGT will drop down below the $120 support line. If it hits it, I'll buy back because the they will crush earnings. Good luck to all the longs"
"C'mon, hold the line today Target - at/or greater than $125!"
"PSHPT tgt trying to PLACATE Christians by carryimg Chip and Joanna product line.""Those Christians mean business, did you see our stock plummet from its $82.96 price on April 4, 2016.

Starbucks, Macy's, and Nordstrom - you are next."
Stock is slipping again. Maybe they should have Chip and Joanna remodel their stores.Yeah ship lap will get the stock to rebound.
I'll always be a loyal Target customer buy not a loyal Target investor. I might think about it when they come back from the recession
$100 base has formed. the choice is yours. Buy or Regret.

"Target has a tough fight on its hands with Amazon. After all, it's much more efficient and environmentally friendly to buy what you want on Amazon, and that is reflected in the reduced price you will find there. There is simply no way in hell that Target can compete with Amazon on price. Then you have to consider the environmental benefits of buying online versus buying from a brick and mortar store. Factor in the issue of safety to your loved ones, which is put in peril by stores like Target inviting perverts into ladies' rooms with your children and yourself, it's a no-brainer. Of course there are lots of no-brainer individuals in America today, but not enough to keep Target afloat."
I like the way this held up today given market. Abandoned my put position for a small loss and switched to Calls.
"Struggling to make up for deep losses, Target has demonstrated just how desperate things are becoming for the company that lets men use the women's restrooms and dressing rooms.For the first time in its history, Target offered a 10% discount on every product in its stores and online this past Sunday. To take advantage of Target's sale, shoppers had to cut out a coupon from Sunday's weekly and take it to Target's stores. Online orders automatically applied the discount.The unusual sale tactic came one week after Target reported a massive 7.2% drop in sales in the second quarter, following the launch of the AFA #BoycottTarget campaign.Target CEO Brian Cornell admitted in a conference call with media that traffic is way down and that sales are hurting. ""In the second quarter, our No. 1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories,"" he said.Although he did not mention the AFA boycott by name, 1.4 million people have pledged to Mr. Cornell that they will not shop at Target.TAKE ACTIONIf you haven't already, sign the pledge to boycott Target now! Target should not allow men to enter the women's restrooms and dressing rooms.Call Target and let them know you've signed the Pledge. Call Target Guest Relations at 1-800-440-0680, option 1, then 1 again.Share your concerns on their Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/target. When sharing this on social media use #BoycottTarget."
"local do you know what ""blowout"" means when referring to earnings? as in blowout 3rd qtr?tell us the story about the zealot boycott bringin TGT to it's knees again, that was a beauty....Really too funny"
"Kevin, I did visit a Target and had an overall good experience. As soon as Target refines their bathroom policy to not make non transgendered’s use the single bathrooms to feel safe, I’m a customer. Until then, I’ll have to deal with the nastiness of Walmart."
"Well see the newbies/daytraders are here for the earnings play. I've been in TGT for awhile, although made a temporary play short a few weeks ago. I've been saying for awhile that we have had a fantastic run the past 6 months and have outpaced WMT usually high. Also said based on this, a great quarter is already priced in, and any poor guidance could effect the stock price. I'm even at moment, but did very well since I bought TGT back in the $90s. It's been a mixed trade emotionally, I do want back in just the investor side of me can't buy back shares at $186 when WMT is trading at $131. Wish everyone the best with their trades."
I might go long on this dividend aristocrat
Target and Walmart doing really well for my portfolio!! Good luck longs!!
"""So just answer my legit investment question"". His ""legit"" question is .. what is the cost basis and quantity of TGT shares that I am holding. Doc, you already know the cost basis of the shares I HAD this morning. Quantity is not something I usually reveal. Just because I showed my SQ trade to you with quantity doesn't mean I'll do that everytime. In fact, I rarely do that. So much for ""not caring"" lol."

Why the rocketship higher? Stimulus checks?
Nearly every day it hits a new 52 week low! Deserving SO!
"In business schools, Target will be a cautionary tale for years to come. 1. Never mix politics with business.2. Respect your customers. Don't show that you have contempt for their beliefs, privacy rights, or personal safety. 3. Never believe your own propaganda. The problem never was transgender rights, if it was then Target could simply have built private bathrooms for the sexually confused."
will delay in tax refunds have any effect or unforeseen influence on next quarters revenue?
"I never shop at Target, because I care about my wife and daughter and their safety."
downward channel doesn't look like its gunna stop anytime soon
This thing is going back to $110 pre November earnings. then its safe to buy again i think.
Target is teaming up with Chip and Joanna Gaines from HGTV's Fixer Upper for a new line. This will be VERY popular and should draw a lot of traffic. Great way for Target to keep their brands and styles above the competition.
"The hottest gals in the country are Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and Lindsay Lohan. These are the 3 Vixens. They are the best our great nation has to offer. Boy I would like to meet them in a Target rest-room, if it was legal and cool with Target regulations. That would be a thrilling experience."
target earning before the bell or after the bell?
"Why don't you post something regarding TGT. Reports, earnings or some news, I'm tired of seeing continuous comments regarding the ladies rooms. Why don't you do something about it and stop posting daily about it. We're all aware of your beliefs but I'd rather here you actually did something as apposed to complaining."
"Target down again today. Up only 15 percent in 30 years. What a waste of capital. Now they're letting men into their ladies' rooms. Brick and mortar is dying, if not dead already."
I love that this stock hasn't become a popular day trader stock yet

thanks for the gift of cheaper shares dmwts lol
"Buy up thru $110. Sell anything above $110. But you never know, the market always surprises since there’s no easy money. Market Could always take it to $120-$130 levels too before any big sell off happens. Uptrend Momentum should continue thru the month."
my family stopped shopping there last summer. We spent about $200 per month on food and other stuff. We stopped because of their LIBERAL STUPID POLICIES. SEE YEA
"why is this not going down more? at any time, their store can be shutdown; revenue is down, the horizon is darker rather than brighter."
"Are storefronts necessary? Sure, some are. In cases where they aren't, AMZN has already taken over. Now they're going after cases where they ARE necessary. Bad news for niche players like Target."
$TGT - COST up 10% +28 intraday on stockpiling food and supplies. Group of Seven and Central Bankers hopes to take action in the morning.

"If it breaks long term support at 55, look out below."
sarha - you know I give you credit for not going into hiding. Question - Do you think I will ever get a chance to buy TGT back for less after selling it today? Can you have AFA hire like 3 more shytposters?
tgt is king ....selling its own brands ..online ....offline ....apparels ....furniture...clothes anything u need
"Bullish on Target, when i saw these stores packed back in 2017 in knew they were on to something... holding my contract option calls for next weeks holiday numbers!"
So the boycott is over?
"Doc, I'm so humbled to be casually chatting with an expert such as yourself - who by the way has also expressed wanting to have sex with me on multiple occasions. Doc, is it common in your ""medical career"" to express such desires?"
"Number of stores is also irrelevant. How many stores does Costco have .. compared to say JCPenney? I don't know.. Google it, it's probably about the same but if JCPenney has more stores, is it a better stock? I too can troll and call names and maybe I will feel like I accomplished something but again this is not how people successfully invest. Both TGT and WMT are decent stocks.. personally I think TGT has more potential, someone else may say - ""no, WMT has more potential"". I disagree but that's possible."
"Statements from Quark are like used toilet paper, one wipe....toss in the toilet....and forgotten with a simple flush. :-)"
well here we go again
"Good question. This is suppose to be a stock board, not a political/bashing board. Now, does anyone have a good idea why TGT is up $3 today?"
Up $5.70 on a down market can't wait to hear what the market is tomorrow.........
WMT 12 month trailing PE is 24 vs TGT only 19.
If the stock drops another .60 or so it will hit a 5 year low.
Another tough day to be an RWNJ.
"TGT is better rated than Amazon and Costco and WMT. This company has a brighter future than their competitors. They opened 30 new stores in 2020 and 30 or 40 by end of 2021. With 1900 stores currently, TGT has a lot of potential to deliver where the rest do not. Better managed and run than the rest. Visit their stores and see for yourself. They are reliable and their stores are always clean and well organized. It is overwhelming like others and the prices are much better than anywhere else, cheaper than Amazon for certain items. Investing $4 billions is a good idea. Their dividend will only increase and they are continue to grow by expanding into new geographical areas as well as taking customers away from other competitors. I am one of their customers that never been in a Target before till recently."
All other retail stocks: green.Target: red.Ugh
Bear flag in 5 minutes chart . Lot of selling pressures. Red day tomorrow
"That's been addressed more times than you can count, Obvious Local Perv. You have presented no evidence that there have been more incidents at Target since the policy was publicized. Anecdotes do not show any evidence of a trend. And you have nothing but disrespect for women based on the way you speak about your own family members."
Sadly it looks like TGT won't be in the 50's by next week. Oh well. It's just a matter of time.

"you had only two places to shop, AMZN or WMT. I dont like WMT at all, so had no choice but to shop at amzn. Now tgt has 1 day shipping, things will start changing quickly. The price are good. wmt mkt cap 350B amzn 870B, Tgt 54B. so your looking at atleast double mkt cap when TGT is on par or atleast close, with the other two in revenue in the near future. This thing will rocket."

Sold out today and bought PG. Not comfortable with discount stores in my holdings. Bought TGT in protest against bigotry and felt well rewarded today. May be back if the bigots rear their head again.
BOYCOTT TARGET
"Look at WMT this morning. It's at 81.50 pre-market. No it doesn't make me happy and no I wasn't shorting WMT... but let this be a lesson to the TGT trolls (who love their WMT stock and some random cherry-picked comparison timeline). Investing is a humbling experience -- something you'd know if you were a real investor. As soon as you consider yourself to be the master of the universe, the market will usually teach you something new."
"The sad fact is that a bathroom maggot just said that he isn't shorting Target because he doesn't want to ""own a junk stock"". OMG LOL"
I bought TGT at 165 and since then is only going down. Is it worth it to hold the stock or better take the loss and move on? Thanks!

I really don't care if Target does well or not.

As for me and my household and Church...we will shop elsewhere....

"Any stock that is not soaring in this inflationary environment is a dog. TGT is one such dog. It has not appreciated in 12 years. WMT has gone up 100 percent in 12 years. TGT has serious management problems, made worse by politically motivated policies which show contempt for the rights, beliefs, and safety of their female customers. Other problems are the lack of a serious third party marketplace, which is needed to compete with AMZN and WMT . It's a laggard, and will stay that way."

"For those that asked, IN MY OPINION, this is a stock your going to want to hold for at least a year. Not only for tax reasons but because Target is still growing into a retail leader & has a lot more market share to grab. There are many reasons to own this stock. The ceo, margins, growth, private brands, mergers & partnerships, balance sheet, etc. ...Do your own DD (due diligence) & always know what you own but with products like “All in motion” coming out (one example), i would stick around for a while."

"Hey c, are you confident it will hold above 50? The bet could soon be over."
"Target -Please WAKE UP and get your in store pickup corrected-I got an e-mail that yesterday was my last day to pick up in store-but never got a notice saying it had arrived in store-This on an item that is in high demand in stores that you are apparently unable to keep in stockI was considering buying this stock ,but this indicates multiple management problems to me."
just drop dividend and go full on growth please
Trump just saved the shorts.
This isn't the right time to invest in anything really. Sold TGT before Fed and don't think I'll be buying it again for a while. But yeah.. one can pretty much pick any stock and short. Must be the bathroom everywhere.
Class action just around the corner. Get rid of Cornell
"Headed out for a nice lunch and shopping with my family. One place we will not be visiting is target. I will not allow my wife and daughter to be preyed upon by the sexual deviants that are attracted to this liberal company. It won't belong until the assaults are a daily occurrence. If you love your wife and children, stay away from target."
Hope Artie doesn't have flashbacks from TGT's 2017 SP fall into the $50's. :-(
Can anyone see a scenario where Amazon comes out and buys TGT? If they are willing to buy WholeFoods couldn't they just swallow up TGT like it was nothing also....
Not impressed by WMT earnings.
"Wow what a stock. It's not only a place to shop,it will cure cancer and eliminate the national debt too! $500 price target lol"

Target to $500!!
Target when I went to place a pick up order that I have used before my check out said there was a 50 Cent charge for 10 Bags. I went to your chat line and they told me oh they will refund your 50 Cents for 10 bags if you tell the clerk you do not want a bag when you pick it up. I told them I was not going to jump through hoops to get my Money back and I did not need a bag for a package of Four Coin Batteries for $11.99. I canceled my order and placed it at Walmart delivered to me Home for $9.52 for 25 Batteries. Do not need 25 but family and friends can probably use some. Why would anyone shop or own Target Stock. I own 1100 Shares of Kroger and will buy more!
"I was told last week by a liberal that I need to give unions credit for not having to work weekends, because they demanded it from employers. So last night I told my wife I was hungry for dinner, and when she gave it to me, I told her she should thank me for providing it. Don't do that."
"Target is one of those safe investments that's going to be just fine in the long run. I had a long term position here at 71. Stock went all the way to 90 but unfortunately I did not sell.. finally I sold it at 77 before earnings. Now I'm back in as a long.. with my last and final order at ~67.50. If I didn't sell at 77, I wouldn't be terribly disappointed. I've absolutely zero worries here. If this ""MAGA"" economy goes into recession, 50's is entirely possible. I'll consider adding at that point."
"If you see a beautiful woman go in to the Target rest-room, follow her in. Target management says it's okay. If anyone complains, call them a bigot. Be a gentleman, hold your cell phone over the divider, and take a picture. Maybe you can get her phone # after she exits the John."

it's never different -- moves like this are irrational day events with zero follow thru and lots of pain to follow- longs will say it was perfectly rational based earnings --well got a little reality check for you-- you can find mega rallies on awful earnings good earning flat earnings-- earnings are the excuse the trading desks use to pump or dump what they don't want on their books-- the brain washed masses have been programed by brokers the financial news and funds to distract you from reality -- learn the game or get out before they take you out

"I really like Target as a store but I did acquire a short position in the closing minutes. How I see it is that Target isn't adapting well to the challenge from Costco, Walmart and now Amazon. Target.com also kind of sucks. Let's see what happens I guess."

"44000 square feet for men dressed as women to run around and terrify women and children. How disturbing to most, but not to Brian Cornell. He invites these mentally ill freaks to come to target. My advice is to stay away."
"Shhh...don't tell anyone that the real reason Target same store sales - and stock price - are in the toilet is because of a multi-million former customer boycott. So much so that Target is having to slash prices to get people back in the stores. But fake news media, like all left wing institutions, thinks that ignoring the boycott means it doesnt exist. --------------The most important metric for any retail store is same-store sales and, in the case of Target, that metric is awful. The last fiscal quarter of TGT earnings delivered comparable store traffic increases of 1.4% and comp sales increases of 0.9%. That’s not good news. It says that TGT is making minuscule inroads with consumers. Third-quarter net income also fell a whopping 21%, to $480 million.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-target-corporation-stock-lower-164606374.html"

Target rest-rooms are ultra-safe and wholesome facilities in which to conduct ur personal business while shopping."
"Gee I wonder what happened to Mark, S G, yahoo reader, toofunny - all the transgender bathroom shills and sicko internet trolls. I do not think they are having fun playing their games anymore, pushing perversion.!!!I really, really hope these people owned lots of Target stock. I hope they still own lots and lots of it."
"Just like Hillary misjudged the American people so Target misjudged the morals of America. You offend us. I won't bring my wife or daughter there, we go somewhere else. You could give away the stock but until they recognize that gender is not dynamic, you use the bathroom of your real, actual, born-as gender then people will stay away.I'm not shopping at a store run by very stupid people."
What a great week for Target. I’ll be stopping by my local store after work for some essentials and of course a victory lap in the restroom.

"Target bathroom policy: Another innocent child victimhttp://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/04/01/police-man-exposes-child-chicago-target-store-womens-bathroom/Tuesday, April 3, 2018Target bathroom policy: Another innocent child victimWhile Target remains steadfast in allowing men to enter women's dressing and restrooms, the number of child victims of sexual crimes occurring in its stores continues to rise.Last week, in a Chicago area Target store, a man forced himself into a bathroom stall being occupied by a young child and sexually exposed his private parts to her. The man ran away before police could arrive.According to news reports, the incident happened in the middle of the afternoon on Sunday, March 25.No Target employee questioned the man or attempted to stop him from entering the women's restroom because Target’s official policy allows men free and unrestricted access. This policy has resulted in over a dozen crimes being committed by sexual predators taking advantage of it.""It's very sad. Children are innocent,"" Stanley Hughley, a shopper at the Target store, said. ""However old the pedophile was, it's wrong. It’s pure evil no matter how you look at it.""As we have stated many times, our worries stem from both the real and potential threat that predators and voyeurs, or anyone with evil intentions, would take advantage of the Target bathroom policy to harm women and children - and we have plenty of incidents to show that they have.AFA has outlined just 10 examples that show why Target should immediately rescind its dangerous policy and keep men out of women's bathrooms and dressing rooms. As long as Target continues to allow men free and unrestricted access into women's dressing rooms and restrooms, these sexual violations against women and little girls will continue to occur.TAKE ACTIONThere are still people you know who are unfamiliar with Target's dangerous policy. Will you help spread the warning and let your family and friends know about the Target boycott? Forward this information to friends and family. Invite them to sign the boycott pledge at www.afa.net/target. Call Target headquarters at 612-304-6073 and personally let them know you are boycotting their stores. Voice your concerns on Target's Facebook page. Support our ongoing efforts to promote the Target boycott. Make your tax-deductible donation today!"
"I'm pretty sure that ""R"" is a new alias for Sarah. Sorry, Sarah, shifting the so-called ""boycott"" to a different target on the rwnj agenda (i.e. people in MN having the ""audacity"" to elect a Muslim) isn't going to work either."
"In a democracy, everyone, no matter how nonconformist or eccentric, should be free from harassment and abuse. But at the same time, no one deserves special rights, protections, or privileges on the basis of their eccentricity. The categories ‘trans-man’ and ‘trans-woman’ are highly accurate and deserving of respect. But like Germaine Greer and Sheila Jeffreys, I reject state-sponsored coercion to call someone a ’woman’ or a ‘man’ simply on the basis of his or her subjective feeling about it. We may well take the path of good will and defer to courtesy on such occasions, but it is our choice alone.Camille Paglia"
"Sarah thinks that appealing to peoples' irrational fears and emotions to advance pvssygrabberist objectives is the ""right"" thing to do."
"Target is trading as though it is a junk stock. Maybe it is. Fire current management. They instituted an absurd if not dangerous bathroom policy. They collect year end bonus. They renovated stores that did not need renovation. They had one of the largest ever security breaches that left passwords and customer info exposed. If it goes above 60 again, i will sell so fast your head will spin."
Congrats Long $TGT holders. My only regret was that I didn’t buy more last week!!!!

With Wmt up after earnings I would expect Tgt to report even better numbers tomorrow morning. I see the stock price going up to $220 or better tomorrow when their earnings are reported bmo.

"Grounds for shareholder lawsuit? Materially denying the effects of the boycott on sales for 11 months should be a violation of SEC rules and good faith disclosure rules under SEC regulations, I would think."
"Sarah has now latched on to the ""stock market is volatile/falling because Democrats won the house"". This ignores two pretty obvious truths: - The market didn't tank right after the election. If this were really the reason for the drop, one would have expected those two events to be correlated in time. - The market has made some pretty obvious swings based on the pvssygrabber's proclamations of trade war resolution and factual reports that indicate otherwise. It seems pretty obvious that this is the real cause.I'm not surprised that Sarah has bought into this nonsense, though: RWNJ media has been instructing it's followers to push this line, and Sarah is awfully obedient in that regard."

"Has RETAIL BOTTOMED OUT? No. ....they have one more quarter of earnings which will be reported in August that will be very ugly. This is even worse for Target, because it was I believe in August of last year when they decided to do things very radical. This next earnings from Target will be extremely bad, but their forward estimates should improve with their August earnings report."
well come to december sell of

"I visited a Target today for the first time in a couple of years. My first stop was to the men’s room. While it was cleaner and didn’t have the stench of urine like Walmart, it was not like Ark or whoever it was who said you could eat off the porcelain. Trust me, you can’t. The good news is I didn’t see any confused alphabet people. I actually did some shopping. The shopping carts are awesome. No bad wheels, very smooth. Prices were not bad for the items I bought. One of the item’s didn’t register on the scanner and the attendant asked me how much it was. I didn’t remember the exact price but had a ballpark number in my head. The attendant asked me if a certain price was okay and it was below the actual price, as I remembered it. I said fine. My experience at Target was positive based on products, price and service. If they would just change the bathroom policy they would get more of my business. All they have to do is ask the confused alphabet people to use the single or family bathrooms. I’m not sure if other protesters would agree with me, but that’s what I need to hear and I’m a regular customer. Everything in this post is 100% true. Go ahead and attack me"

"Because of substantial same store sales increase, I'm somewhat confident that Target's downside is limited. If they met profit estimate but missed SS sales, I wouldn't have bought TGT today."
"TGT going thru a melt up and may continue to do so. Since there recent announcement of hiring 130k workers, paying twice the minimum wage and deep loyalty discounts, this is great for the employees and customers but not so much for the stock since it will erode their Margins. I still like the stock long term but waiting for a significant pull back for adding long positions since the risk-reward isn’t worth it now at these levels. However, if the stock continues to melt up on its momentum without any correction like what Ulta did, then I would avoid the stock overall once it peaks since the exceeding up move will likely make for a big correction that may not recover to new highs afterwards."
"By mid 2019, more major stores will explicitly announce similar bathroom policy. Expect stores like Walmart -- who currently already allow trans folks to use the bathroom that they identify with --... expect these stores to announce in clear words that they have this policy. @ObviousPedophile - go ahead and screenshot this post and feel free to ridicule me if this doesn't happen. I already know one major store that will announce this policy in 2018. Feel free to alert AFA. You're welcome."

Heard on CNBC some saying if you buy online it’s really between Walmart and Amazon. Don’t know about everyone else but I have as many Target boxes on my porch as anything else. I don’t think their digital sales were a one-hit wonder. I expect any day Target to announce their strong digital sales continued through June and stock pops 5-7% on the news.Would love to hear others opinions. I see $130 ish range after earnings and $150+ by year-end.
Glad I bought more $TGT shares at the big drop on Tuesday. Now up $5 with optimism around WMT's earnings beat. Let's hope TGT crushes it. Hard to see otherwise. They're a better version of Walmart all around.
"I wonder if Dave, nut job, Ark, PDX, etc are all sex offenders who enjoy peeping on women in Target ladies' rooms. It would explain a lot!"
"Target is too greedy in pricing. Long target so went shopping in a target store before Christmas. To my surprise everything is more than I could get from other places I shop, costoc, Walmart and Amazon. I ended up didn’t buy from target this year. No wonder it’s not that good. However I feel costoc should be ok for holidays sales if it’s not great!"
"We're all about ""classy"" here on the Yahoo Finance TGT board! ;)"
Very strong selling. This will go into Monday for sure.
Div checks in the mail enjoy everyone. The Div increase should be announced by Tuesday. Anyone want to guess how much it will go up? My gut was saying it will go to .64 but with that HUGE earnings beat it might go to .65. Take a guess.

It bottomed at 110. Going only up. Long term.
"The only way Target survives is to give up on hoping that women will come to their stores, just to be molested by whatever sex offender decides to ""feel like a woman today"". So, sending their products to peoples' homes might make sense. Oh wait...doesn't Amazon already do that?"
Does AFA have their so called boycott on Walgreens too? AFA shoppers will run out of places to shop eventually
Target has many great down days ahead of it. Hoping for 20's by summer.
"Compete? Brian Cornell, thinking of competing? Lol. Don't think Cornell has that in mind.He and his progressive board don't have competing in mind. Their primary concern is allowing pervs to slip into women's bathrooms with that stupid bathroom policy.Ignoring the boycott, ignoring the earnings dropping over the past year, ignoring the empty parking lots, and ignoring the majority of their former customer concerns about the stupid bathroom policy. These actions show little concern for competing.Deficit spending is a dem/progressive specialty. The board allowed this stupidity and fell for Cornell's UTOPIA bathroom dreams.Mico stores, renovations, Jeff from Kroger, and fake media hype about how well TGT is doing, is nothing more than them trying to customers over the brow to accept their bilge/drivel of a stupid policy. :-("
Some of you people are really ignorant. a transgender person is not a pedophile.
"It's a TGT board related question.. right? As someone who is generally bullish on TGT but not invested at the moment - should I buy TGT at 71.56? ""Plain and simple"" yes/no would be great from our board certified doctor here."

Wait.....A LWNJ CEO and Board institutes a BIGOTED (against women and young girls) BATHROOM POLICY which causes a substantial REDUCTION in customer foot traffic and a 45% reduction in the companies STOCK PRICE isn't STOCK TALK!?!?!?

"Question: if you purchased TGT at $77, how many years of aristocratic dividends will it take for you to achieve a 4.5 percent return on your investment?"
"The great thing about Target @ $217.xx? Thinking long term, TGT is still a good value. Good luck TGT longs! It's my longest held stock, since 1998, with no plans to sell. Hope to own for the next 20+ years in fact."
bought 500 tgt share at 55 bucks a few years ago but sold majority of them around at 80 to 100. Yup kinda feeling dumb but glad I still have 80 shares. glta!
A forward div yield of >3.65% would be sweeeet.
STARBUCKS admits there mistakeAt least Starbucks admitted their mistake . To late for TGT to admit theirs. TGT better conserve their cash instead of remodeling stores that no one is going in. Why spend yourself into bankruptcy. Better to save for when it really gets bad.
Target's CEO is trying to top Ron Johnson as the worst retail store CEO ever! These liberals never learn. It's time to fire top management before things get much worse.

Please help us reach 1.6 million supporters!The Target boycott, launched in April 2016, is causing a significant drop in foot traffic to the store. Effects of the boycott are clear in Target’s financial report released February 28. The report indicated a dramatic drop in Target’s sales and earningsduring October, November, and December. This bad news for Target resulted in the company’s stock value dropping 13 percenton the day of the report.Target, however, remains willfully blind to the link between the boycott and financial loss, but this blindness should not persist. Investors will hardly allow a politically correct bathroom policy based on a minority opinion to sink Target’s profits further. Target investors must be aware that a strong majority of Americans believe the use of restrooms and dressing rooms should be linked to a person's biological sex We must keep the pressure on Target.Somebody needs to tell this to Snopes.com, the fact-checking site so many people depend on for honesty. The site's appraisal of the Target boycott is well off the mark. Snopes.com is simply repeating Target's false claims that the boycott is having no effect on the company.The Snopes.com story includes a quote from Target's public relations manager Erika Winkels saying the boycott has had no effect on them: ""We have made it clear over time that we've seen no material impact to the business based on the bathroom policy. We don't have anything new or different to share.""FACT: Despite Target's denial, the boycott is dealing a crippling financial blow to the company. Since it was launched in April 2016, Target has seen a significant drop in foot traffic to their stores. Effects of the boycott are also clear in Target's financial report released February 28. The report reflected a dramatic drop in Target's sales and earnings during October, November, and December."
Does Target sell Tofutti products?
"I work at Super target in Phoenix,just completed a on line capacity of three times the original,watch out Amazon "

"Kevin sounds angry because he’s losing money, even though he was warned many times about the boycott. Bloody Thursday coming for Target tomorrow. Investors like Kevin is why I make a fortune."
Chart looks parabolic. Great company but selling Oct $200/$210 call spreads for $6.60
"Without getting in to politics, should we be bailing out of Target? Shouldn't Target be concerned with buying the best merchandise and being as profitable as possible? What will spending 2 billion on black businesses do for we shareholders?"
"What the expletive is going on today? Target missed its holiday sales forecast, not a missed or bad quarterly earning report. Get a grip people!"
Boycotting Amazon yet? or still complaining about the bathroom policy?
BUWAHAHAHAAAA HAAAAAA HAAAAAAA. Thanks FTP QUARKY!
"Just like the other article you posted, AnonIsAnIlliterateTranny, this dude was a BLATANT Homosexual Pedophile.""In the course of their investigation, Nashville police detectives identified multiple victims, mostly boys, who were allegedly molested by Patterson between the years 1998 to 2017.""""Three days later, church members came to Nashville police to report that children were saying he had them engage in strange activities with him, including sitting on his face and stomach, sometimes in their underwear. Later in the month, he moved to the Pittsburgh area.""Looks like Gay Gestapo Homosexual acts against boys to me, no AnonIsAnIlliterateTranny?"
"TGT in the green, AMZN Red, Good!"
"U can't boycott corporations. They're too powerful. U need the corporation's products too badly. Even the great Al Sharpton is a peon compared to a mighty corporation like Pepsi, for example."
"One thing that will cushion some of the decline in sales and profit next year will be a return of capital to shareholders, through buybacks or dividend increases. Costco declared a special one time $10 dividend. Target will buy back overpriced stock, and raise their dividend. It would be smartest to pay a special dividend like Costco."
"Target stock continues to be a really bad investment. It was $84 share when Target management announced its bigoted, inexplicable decision to endanger its female customers by letting men in ladies rooms, That was 2-1/2 years ago. Look at it now. Down 20 percent since then. Sad that management decided to put politics over the well being of their customers."
"shorting this if it hits 126$ again, it always pulls back. quick short not long."
I love it when Target stock goes down. It feels like social justice.
Oversold. There is no good reason for it to be sold off this much for days!!!!!
"Here is a good one, we got TGT that most of their shoppers are average people and some middle income that shops there , TGT are trading at 21 X future earning, and than we got JWN that most of their shoppers are people from wall street and middle income, JWN trades less than 12 X future does not make any sense ,boys of wall street should wake up and smell the coffee :)"
going to be 85 after eartnings
No matter earnings good or not this share price will react like all other retail if you want to better yourself sell now to reposition after the raid.
"If you really think about it *rationally*, $TGT at 54 and even at 57 is a buy. Perhaps not a 'screaming buy' but definitely a buy. The risk is fairly low and yet somehow the sentiment brought it down 10% on earnings that were above expectations and guidance that was close to neutral. If you want to short retail, why not short $FL? It is amazing that $FL is up some 25% yet guidance is down. They see Q4 EPS down 15-25% y/y implying $1.03-1.16 vs $1.18 consensus."
why is this falling??
Perverts in ladies rooms with women in young girls. It seemed like such a good idea at the time.
Green on a blood-red day? I like it!
"Target is lost. The problem they have is Amazon. Walmart is another problem. And to make matters worse Target has contempt for the families that were loyal shoppers by instituting a bathroom policy that caters to perverts. So what do they do to fix the problem? Well, management ignores the problem as though it will just go away. Now they spend billions renovating stores. But the stores are already cleaner and nicer than walmart. People obviously shop at walmart because they want the lowest price over the nicer looking stores."
56.60 by turkey day. threw and read bones twice to confirm.

Bathroom troll is hiding right now. He'll come out when TGT drops and sing his bathroom song.
"Great Beat. More consumers are shopping at discount stores.. target, Walmart, dollar stores etc are the beneficiaries."
"I have been watching the TGT stock tank and was looking for an entry point because of all the blood on the street. My wife - like many moms in our neighborhood - spent a ton of money every month at the local Target on food, clothes, toys, personal care, prescriptions(now CVS). Once they announced the bathroom policy, her and her circle of friends stopped shopping. Shredded the credit cards too. ""Everything is going to zero"" she said. We even know Target employees that stopped shopping or quit the company. Anyway...fast forward...i told her last night I might buy some TGT stock because of how bad it has tanked. She looked at me - hands on hips - and said something else will go to ZERO if I bought any stock."
So Im having BBQ tomorrow and one of my guests likes A1 steak sauce. So I can go to safeway down the street and spend $4.99 for a 10oz bottle or 3.99 if I have their club card(real prices look them up or go check yourself). Or I can walk down to TGT and pay 3.19 with no card for the same 10oz bottle (once again real prices). Option 3 is to drive to WMT park half a county away because of all those mobile homes/RVs parked in the lot (do they charge them rent?) and spend 2.99. What should I do?
America is speaking out against perversion with their wallets. Disney is going to have an openly gay character in beauty and the beast so watch that crumble. It is nice to see that there are still moral people in this land of confused degenerates.
The boycott will take a bite out of target today. Stay strong brothers.

AMZN buying target today
The target guy in charge of competing with amazon was just hired by amazon........hahaha.....now that's funny....
what will you guys think it will go up to today
"Can you imagine how low TGT would be if management wasn't using company money to prop up their own stock price? $5 billion authorized just this year, in a $30 billion cap company! Amazing they can get away with this. I'm sure this is just a coincidence that it boosts management compensation at the expense of long term growth.I wonder how much stock TGT bought in the 80's, 70's, and 60s. That would be interesting to know."
"I don’t understand why companies are refusing guidance. What’s the real difference between taking a hit now or revising lower and taking a hit later? Besides, who can really give honest guidance anyways with looming threats of higher corporate taxes and minimum wage hikes in the midst of an historic pandemic?"
"""Blame it on the rain....that keeps on fallin."" This particular retailer has social justice issues. They are fighting for all the wrong reasons. They prefer FAKE WOMEN rights to supplant REAL WOMEN RIGHTS in their bathrooms and changing rooms. Screw real women and young girls safety and security from pervs with mobile camera devices.In this sorry storyline, the BOARD and CEO are responsible for this company's decline. :-(I doubt Brian will be able to turn this sinking ship around. Besides, how do you turn a sinking ship around? It's sinking isn't it?Brian has already​ gotten a 1/3 pay cut last quarter. He, sadly, still hasn't learned that REAL WOMEN need to be protected from PERVS!!!"
Read zacks opinion on TGT released this morning. Sounds pretty optimistic. It is on the yahoo board under the target quotes.
Ain’t no stopping TGT now. Productive Millennials love the store! It’s well managed well stocked with safe sustainable products and very well priced! Online business is icing on the cake! Bye bye amazon
"The so-called ""boycott"". LOL!"
"TGT is involved in manipulating customers data sharing and receiving and new privacy act is causing many retailers to adhere to rule, any small data breach event can cause company to go south and bankrupt!!"
"I don’t even own any Walmart but i cannot believe @obvious Russian bot has 6,000 posts on a single stock thread LMAOOOOOOOOO"
"""lifesitenews"", LOL! The RW nut jobbery just never stops, does it? ;)"
Target should by Rite Aid...I own both stocks and see a win win!
You mean taxes will be cut? How can the taxpayers afford not to pay more in taxes? Isn't that what the Democrats are asking? LOL
Is it just me or have our 2 notorious posters got more and more looney? Didn't think it was possible but they have!!!! Go Target 2018!!!

"Now U Tell Me Target rest-rooms are nothing special! I just ate my lunch on the porcelain bowl in one of their rest-rooms! I wish you had reported the mediocrity of the Target rest-room BEFORE I tried this stunt. To be perfectly honest, my lunch tasted a bit funky. Why don't you Boys just take your meals in the traditional fashion and never mind about Targets porcelain bowls being clean enough to eat off of. That was a bit of hyperbole and should not be taken literally."
"Target is way too low. All a bunch of overstated worries and maybes. All the while, the stores are Fresh & New and packed with shoppers! I think their earnings are gonna knock it out of the park! GLTAL"
tgt underperforming
This CEO hasn't a clue and will take TGT the road of Montgomery Ward. Sad
"If the Robot gave up on the Boycott, Target will soar to 250. The Robot was the only thing holding Target back all these years."
Can always tell when there is a full moon; sarha/Sean/Local Perv gets even more crazy.
Ideas that Target is considering:- NAMBLA recruiting booths- lingerie for 8 year old Muslim girl brides- Hiring Bill Clinton to run the intern program- Hiring Harvey Weinstein to be in charge of corporate recruiting- Hiring Al Franken to run a photography studio - Putting pedophiles in charge of fitting room securityDid I miss anything?

Can you say bull run about to happen glad I added to my position last Friday. Anyone who does not see this being a great investment is missing out. They get to stay open through all this and they sell more than just food. Great online ordering increases. Not to mention when I hear about where people are shopping I hear oh I love target pick up and go and there online services have been great to deal with. These are from plenty of different mothers I have been talking to. TGT loves moms 1 stop shop to put the cherry on top Weather is getting nice we are opening America again... A. People got fat and need new clothes B. Women always need new clothes and now you have taken that from them they are waiting like bulls to rush these stores. I honestly want anyone who thinks that this isn’t all true to argue that.
"So now the pv55y grabber's son Butthead has decided that the vast majority of Americans (including a majority of Republicans) who want to have net neutrality just don't understand what they're talking about.Man, these RWNJs have a lot of contempt for the majority of ordinary Americans!"

I'm sure Target isn't doing that great. they are having issues and at a high point just start with profit taking into panic sell just saying I picked up some puts to sell on Thursday. GL to the longs
They are doing the right thing. Supporting their employees during this hard times. Not like other companies that do nothing. To me this is much more valuable than sales. They are a good company and they will be back up after this.
feeling bored ..no better stock for er ....iam watching tgt to touch below 120 so that i can buy
I think traders will buy up on Monday because Tuesday is the ex-date for the divvy and hold until Wed. when earnings is reported.
"Hey Dave, I've grabbed a few #$%$ in my time too, but no one has ever complained to the police, any more than they have for President Trump. But I guess in your world it's a crime to be a normal man. How sad for you!"
short
Dayyuuum this girl has some nice legs today.
So who at Target thought it's a good idea to alienate half their customer base to appease 2% of the country that thinks a man should be able to use a woman's restroom? I know many people who will not shop at Target going forward for that sole reason. Whoever it was should be fired immediately!!! Lose 1/3 of your companies value for your shareholders to be politically correct??????
target stock upgrades. I posted on another site. http://stocktwits.com/HulkBanner/message/184525037

Target gets momentum from the sector like WMT will start moving NOW...
"I bought Target in the summer of 2017 when their stock was beat down due to the ""bathroom controversy"" and its related boycott. I paid an average of 50.50. I sold it all yesterday for 154.35."
"Walmart has over 4,000 stores, not including Sam's clubs. Target has 1,800 stores. There have been dozens of incidents in the last year where men who were allowed into Target ladies' rooms were arrested for sex crimes. How many have there been at Walmart? One or two that I know of. There's your statistical evidence right there."
"As I said before the Stock Analyst are like a mob. Jumping on board a way too optimistic view of Target and Walmart telling the public to buy when we should be selling to take advantage of the way too overbought condition of these boring, low margin deep discount retailers which derive 60% of all revenue from groceries.For every dollar of sales they make a couple of pennies profit.Target is the loser in the deep discount retail business. As everyone knows they compete viciously with Walmart head to head as well as against Costco, Sams Club, Albertsons, Krogers etc.. and everyone knows that Targets prices are higher than Walmart so they often lose business to Walmart and their competitors like Costco.Target is a Sell at these prices. When Target falls back to a more reasonable PE, PS, Book Value, ROE and ROA and ROIC it might merit a Buy rating maybe when Target drops to about $58/share it may be a buy then.Remember, this is a deep discount retailer with very low profit margins. They have a boring mostly grocery business that is consistent but boring and way over priced as of today."
this stock always shoots up at the open and never closes near the high
"I bought a lot at $125-127... I shocked how quick its going down, is it better sell now before it gets worse???"
"I personally believe when this stock hit $150, majority of them {investor} want to cash out, because they need to pay mortgage, bills and save it for a long rainy day until Congress get the act together to fight Covid19. Right now, be careful what you wish for. The question is when we get our jobs back? Congress will never bring your jobs back until we get the vaccine."
"And if it's other peoples' eggs that get broken, what do I care?"
Back to the 50's! Woohoooooooooo!!!!
"And let's not even get into the absolute contempt for womens' privacy, safety, and beliefs that comprise a policy of letting men into ladies' rooms, as at Target. The only defense the gay cult has to this outrage is the lie that other stores allow it too, which we all know is an outright lie."
i see $116 this week
3% div!
About to set yet another 52 week low.
"Short sold the stock for the first time in life.... Going from $60 to $108 (9/12/2019) which is 80% increase in a year for general retail company is something I don't think can be sustained. I am pretty sure that it will pull back to 90 or even 80 before it goes back up. I am not a usual short seller as this is my first time, but you really have to think for your money. After 80% increase in a year, will it go up? or down?"

Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on TGT? Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from https://newstockalerts.blogspot.com/ which are working out pretty well.
Wow! The Dow's up over 300! What's Target doing??....Oh...Never mind.
it's overvalued and going below 60
so frustrating that it can't break and hold 78.30
How about they install a roll down door that covers the entrance and use it when they close the store?
"Target is Minnesotas largest employer. Minnesota could use jobs. Good paying jobs. Like pipeline jobs from Enbridges replacement of Line 3. They want to realign it. Bury part of it. Make it bigger, and safer. Minnesota is playing games. Maybe the President can put approve the pipe permits and put people to work in Minnesota. Maybe Canada can tell Minnesota if they don't approve the pipeline, they can pay for any leaks in the old one. I'd like to see a law that says, if any government interferes with an energy project, then when the day comes that we have rationing, due to these harmful restrictions, then the communities and States that kept the project from being built, will receive fewer rationing allowances. Since they helped create the shortage. Fair and simple."
Puts puts puts...
30% drop in less than twelve months. WOW. Target needs to do something or they will be the next Sears.
Target has prevailed. The boycott failed. The bathroom controversy has petered out. Certainly Target is one of the premiere retailers in America. It's dividend treats it's shareholders like royalty.
"It's past time to pull the plug on this ""anti-establishment"" ""President"" experiment (it was always a bad idea, it's just become even more obvious lately)."
TRANSGENDERS not buying stock today. Must be busy either with CORNELL or women's dressing rooms.

"WMT is attempting to build the 3rd party marketplace that is AMZN's secret weapon in world domination. It's kind of weird how long it is taking such a huge corporation as WMT to build that marketplace, but the fact they are doing it at all shows that someone in the company has vision. TGT, in contrast, has abandoned that project. Bad move. Very bad. Then they go and offend and endanger millions of customers to boot, which is the most fundamental error in retail. Doesn't look good for TGT if they continue on their current path."
"There are a lot of hater here against $TGT. Majority of people will ignore those people. $TGT is clean, well stocked, and has friendly people, great customer service, same day pick up, curbside pick up, and now same day delivery. This is the only safe place for the clickers to do some exercise and actually have some human interactions."

Analysts' forecast for the quarter is $0.89. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $1.29. This is a very low bar for Target and if they miss this low estimate it will be a race to the bottom.
“A previous boycott against Target's bathroom policy led to declines in shopper traffic”. So the author is acknowledging the effective boycott. Thanks for posting Kevin!

long money chasing anything positive-- move means nothing -- once the overall market comes back they will drop this like a hot potato - concentrated funds in a few stocks -- this will come back to earth in a hard crash
Obama was the best President in Iranian history.
"when you wake up tommorow to buy this stock at the dip, you will finding out the price is goes to 135 instead."
"Technicals/Chart is impressive. Agree with the Analysts, stock has much room to continue its run up, especially since ALL key resistance levels were broken thru. At this point, no end to uptrend in sight until a new pattern forms, so continue buy and hold until chart indicates otherwise."
The boycott is still negatively impacting target.
1) I like Trump; 2) The Trans-sexual bathroom controversy has long since passed over; 3) Target is a great blue chip retailer. Great for investors and shoppers both.
Why you so quite Timmy? How is that boycott working out for you anyway?
The below gif is Ronald conducting his daily inspection of the ladies room at target.
You mean Target is a store? I thought it was a political action committee! (PAC)

"Let’s see…Liberals boycott Chick-fil-A and there are lines of people around the block waiting to eat there and their business goes through the roof. Liberals boycott Hobby Lobby and business increases. Liberals boycott Ivanka Trump perfume and it becomes the number one seller on Amazon. Conservatives boycott Target and the stock tanks. Conservatives boycott Macy’s and stock drops from $72 to $32 over two years. When it comes to boycotts, liberals talk a good game. I think my new investment strategy will be to find out what liberals are going to boycott next and then load up on the stock."

"tax cut is positive for retailers, TGT no reason down, because TGT is tax cut big winner, it's store in best place, TGT still have high profit margin, low p/e and high dividend."
"tgt open too many stores, it will close too many, it's sales at least 50percent will replace by on line, so tgt is very risk stock, it's reasonable price is $24 per share, p/e =4, because it's sales will continue decline long-term, tgt things are old fashioned things, that's too old, see delivery trucks 65percent boxes was AMZN, plus reason: why people like shopping online????because carrying things too tired, waste energy and waste time, buy things on line save energy and save time, my friend working restaurant,he told me, the restaurant only him buy things in stores, all others buy things on line."

"Few companies can nail things like customer experience and brand equity the way Target does. Whatever household item you need, just pick it up around the corner. You don't have join a club and buy a crate of it. You can hold the item in the store instead of waiting for a drone to drop it on your steps. And you don't feel like you had to walk through the town cesspool for that 39 cent rollback. Just shop at Target like a normal person. Simple."
Got to agree with you Joe. I feel safe at Target. You don't see people walking around barefoot in their PJ's in Target. The store is clean and the employee's are as well. Help is always available. Bathrooms are a non issue to me.

"Target sales have been going down for 3 straight quarters. Some say the boycott is fully in effect. Maybe. Guess we'll know when 1Q17 numbers come out. I think the numbers continue to be horrible, because Cornell is now seeking to throw blame around for the boycott. Obviously he would not do that if he felt that shoppers were accepting his dangerous and contemptuous policies. This company's share values are very seriously at risk in the next few weeks and going forward, so long as this management is in place."
"And if Target, or any other corporation, doesn't think that women have rights to safety and privacy, we have a right not to patronize that store. Myself and millions of others will never, ever patronize Target, or any other facility that shows contempt for womens' rights. Thus, the millions of boycotting shoppers, and Target's floundering fortunes."

I'll buy an infinite number of Target shares at $0.
Funny how the stock was almost $200 and press releases all over. Now stock down and not a peep from press lmaooo
Down a buck today. Here's hoping for $40's soon for this ethically and morally challenged company.
Target is the perfect example of what's required of traditional B&M stores to stay relevant. And holy cow did they ever step up and deliver. Bravo.
market needs to retest its lows. patience folks! anything below a $100 is a steal. theirs a 30 % upside.
Everyone enjoying the pv55y grabber's bubble market today?
this store caters to a higher class of people verses walmart. people with spendable income.
Would $70 be a good entry point for me to get in?
I bought more at the close.
Are the sales numbers numbers coming out before market open or after market close?

"Tar-je, baby.. up 10% from my latest buy, with still a rock solid 4+% dividend. At 9% short, a squeeze is coming, after maybe a last drop to shake out the weaklings. I've been making bucks since buying after the data breach, holding core shares for income."
"Meanwhile, in the real world, TGT stock is almost 73. I said 2 weeks ago that I'm waiting for a chance to invest and forget. TGT was close to ~70 then. Still waiting."
Good start to the morning. Lets see if we can get back to close in the 190s today :)

"I was wondering about that, too, Kevin. I didn’t even chime in."
Well so much for the boycott. LOL
 congrats to people who held this stock over night... IMO

Anyone who would knowingly allow their young female children to use a restroom or dressing room at Target should be arrested for child abuse.
This was supposed to be the stock of the year!
I have been searching for a site that will send me extra income producing stock tips and I think ive finally found it. If you are like me and in need of stock tips that produce good monthly income then you need to go to (http://Multistockalerts.com) now!
Walmart said sales will slowdown going forward. Retailers like Target are going to be lapping results from this time last year in March and April when panic buying was going on and shelves were striped bare. It's going to be hard for retailers to post positive comp comparisons with last year.
"Bought a few $190 yolo calls. I know this big dog is shorted very heavily, based on put/call ratio for March 5 no reason to think any differently.. but the estimates are strong and they typically meet or beat. Maybe they let this run wild.."
so stable stock of 2019 tgt ...see from jan 2019 ..even lot of china trades news brought lot of stock soo much down ..but tgt stood firmly
"Gee, that was a good entry point for WMT. GO WMT."
"I drove by my Wal-mart today and went to TGT to shop, even though it was a bit further."
I wonder why any stock is down at any point when compared to the broader market? Look at my comment below and I have listed all of the possible reasons.
"Here's my ""reasoning"" for you pedophile - I went long on TGT and have gained close to 40% since last June. I'm going to spare you the embarrassment by not slapping an imgur with a dollar amount on your face. What do you have to show for your ""reasoning""?"
"Not for free, no. Free service is what you do for me. I returned favor by giving you my honest opinion about SNAP. But SQ.. I'll rather rub it in. You never fail to do your job, and thank you."
SO....Amazon will deliver in 2 hours fresh food. Aims to beat Wallmart....TGT not even.......lost in dust this holiday
Can T acquire HMNY to better display the home entertainment section?
"Overvalued, sell and get back in this fall"
"I'm not talking about the last 5 minutes, Artie, I'm talking about the last 3 years. That's when TGT has gotten clobbered. A boycott by 1.5 million people shows up over time. Anecdotally, I can tell you that I was once a loyal Target shopper, as was my family, and we won't be back, not until Cornell and their ""woke"" crew are fired and respect for customers' rights is restored."
pv55y-grabberism is a social disease.
"Time for the Boycotters to call of their Dogs. U've punished us enough. We've learned our lesson. We will behave in the Rest-rooms. We promise - no peeking at people. Please call off ur Dogs and let this stock soar to the stars, and sky-rocket out of the stratosphere! U Boycotters hold the key to our collective shareholder Wealth, and we beg U to release Target to the free market."
Down again because of the boycott. Investors must really be wishing target would change its bathroom policy.
Time too short and have some patience - shorted 1500 at $106.20 We'll see - needs to fill the gapGLTA
"Buy, Hold and forget about it. Place GTC sell order at $130. Any weakness, pullbacks or dips should be bought for adding to position."
"TWTR down 5%.. I wonder -- ""Is Twitter letting men into the ladies room?"" That's gotta be it. I'd also like to say... oof!"
Sitting at 12x earnings. Sweet.
Just wow!!
One word: Amazon
"In Maryland, my home state, they figured out a way to tax you more when it rains. LOL"
Wow nice time to take some profits and lower risk.
"Think Target is worth a lot because of it's ""valuable"" retail space, even though the business model itself is a train wreck? Think again!The Death Of Retail Real Estate Continues: 77MM Sq.Ft Of Shopping Space Closed In 2018 Alreadyhttps://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-04-17/death-retail-real-estate-continues-77mm-sqft-shopping-space-closed-2018-already"
Looking forward to a nice 4% gain tomorrow
"Amazon whole food sales down 1% , just beginning, so tgt have long way to fall, brick mortar have no hope."
Can it already trumpeters! Just like Starbucks your little Target boycott is a bust. I don't see any going out of business signs yet.
"As long as Target sells great products at good prices, it doesn't really matter what goes on in the rest- rooms."
Target earnings per share way better than Amazon.
going to buy some March 2019 100 calls
"Ark, you’re probably right on the price. I was looking at a chart and I probably got it wrong. Anyway, I noticed you’re still getting all these thumbs down. I promise I have nothing to do with it but it is just a little funny. Join the boycott, we want you on our side."
As soon as the Fed stops showering money I will pull out (so to speak)
"More non-sensical neologisms from Liar Dave this week. Now he's stringing together ""Christian Pakistan"" as if that makes any sense at all. Of course we all know that neologisms are a symptom of schizophrenia, which explains a lot about Liar Dave's mentality."
Will this double by dec 2021? Or did I miss the boat already?
"While it occurred to me that TGT might have a reasonable upside combined with a limited downside -- the dividend, I hardly expected so much so soon."
"Know what you own! Stay confident! Cornell’s book will write a brilliant story & we are only in the beginning. Target is proving to be & WILL BE a LEADER in retail, online & in-store!"
Blue Chip retailer. I always loved this store. Now our ship is coming in.
"Well, it's too bad that Obama's correction is impacting Trump's stock market."
"Oooh...If Walmart does terrific, it goes down.If target does good, it goes up.Makes absolutely no sense "
"TGT got the grow engine cranking. It is just the beginning. TGT will be the leader in the oimni-channel discounted store that are stealing customers from JC penny, Sears, Macy's and alike. My top picks include the Ross store, CVS, TGT and PVH in the sector that will have many years to grow. All the numbers point to a secular healthy growth of eco. The yield curve is steepening, companies profits are rising, lowest unemployment number, favorable business friendly policy. I bet on top stocks in retail along with the finacial sector. Buy on the dip for the multi-years bull run. If the tax cut materialize, wow, TGT will rocket faster while you collecting juicy dividend. Price inflation is a great driver for TGT and happy with the CEO direction and execution."
"I wonder if people who voted for the p g have any idea how much harm they've inflicted upon themselves, or if they're so buys hating ""liberals"" that they haven't even noticed?"
"WOW...15 dollar one day move is huge. Be cautious. 20 times earnings is historically rich. The entire market is priced at 18 times 2020 earnings. Could go higher, but pricing says expect the best future outcomes."
Target starts selling directly on Instagram. Will Walmart and Kohl's follow?https://closeoutexplosion.com/products/target-gets-hip-on-instagram
TGT closing price on 04/02/2008 = 52.83; TGT closing price on 04/02/2018 = 68.98; Dividend paid over last 10 years = 15.36; Net gain in last 10 years = (68.98-52.83) + 15.36 = 31.51; Percentage gain in last 10 years = 48.68%Freaking hilarious math!
"Dozens of predators arrested in Target since management decided to let men into ladies' rooms. Almost none at Walmart during the same period, because Walmart arrests men who even attempt to enter ladies' rooms. Nobody in Target management, or those supporting them, seems to care. Why is that?"
Yahoo censoring posts again. They can't have a post that goes against their liberal values of child abuse.
"I predicted $110 this month, $120 by earnings sticking to that plus $125 after earnings Nov. 20 plus the divvy as a bonus. I don't buy and hold make my $ dollar by dollar upward rise daily."
Market going to take this to $110 based on Technical chart before any significant pull back happens.
Been a lot of STORMY days for our 2 notorious posters!
Buy in the 70's and take profits in the 80's. Just like last time!
KSS news is going to hurt TGT today!
Hey guys where is SARHA. Can you tell her/he we need some old NEWS ABOUT TARGET

$TGT down 2% today. This is a gift for us longs. Buy up!

This is not the best stock to the New Year! Coming TGT. Get back to $129
I went to targay the other day to shame parents who allow their kids to enter the demonic store. It worked. Some of them left. Run TARGAY out of town!!!
Here's my 2 day trade. $190 tgt puts $4.20 expire Friday and $131 wmt calls at $2.80 expire Friday. Makes no sense this weeks move wmt down much bigger than tgt. Fact tgt is up is surprising.
"TGT's P/E is 11, WMT's P/E is 53I am not a big fan of P/E as an indicator of where the stock is headed but still this difference is just amazing. Btw I can understand the reason for a big difference between TGT's P/E and AMZN's P/E.."
US Mexico Canada trade deal announcement today and TGT is down??
Remaining shorts are having their nuts squeezed like a Christmas toy soldiers' jaws. Up scope...
If everything is so rosy. All time buybacks. Yet not one stuffed shirtInsider buy @ market. What's wrongwith this picture?
Here is how it will go :TGT beats downward-revised earnings...Management talks about the struggle.Extra costs associated with Covid safety.Management pulls future guidance.Stock initially pops green...then turns red late morning.
"As Target Stock continues to ""Meander and Flounder"" in the $50's, while WMT keeps producing 52 week highs, does anyone want to take bets on how long it is before Liar Schizo dave and Liar Bigot BigQ declare that all millennials aren't brainwashed by the Gay Gestapo to think a SODOMITE DEVIANT LIFESTYLE is acceptable and not utterly DISGUSTING?"
"Target has lots more problems going on nobody knows publicly- unless you are a licensed contractor that has done much work at their stores. They are, or have been, involved in a fraud on many small US contractor businesses for repairs and renovation work throughout their stores. They have a 3rd party Facilitator who acts like a General Contractor out of New York, yet is not- Just a glorified call center called Ferrandino & Sons, Inc. Research them, and see, how MANY contractors around the USA (small business operations) are being hurt badly by them and not being paid at all- Yet Target sends funds to this Ferrandino & Son, and they are paying them like 700% markup on the actual contractors' Invoices who did work at the Target stores! This is outrageous and lawsuits will happen, as target is profiting off of repairs/renovations done to their stores, yet these VERY contractors who did the work are not being paid !!! Besides lawsuit and bad press, this will end up with Federal Trade Commission and others..."
"Pete Najarian was on CNBC this morning and was asked to pick 3 stocks for 2020. $TGT Target was one of them & he too argued that Target deserves a higher multiple than Walmart. He also believes Target will achieve that multiple. He is also a big believer in Cornell, especially what he has built with Target Online. Take it for whats its worth to you. This is not what i base my investment decisions off of, but opinions like this are always appreciated on my end."
"The only thing holding this up is Target's stock buyback program, keeping Cornell and the board rich, while screwing the stockholders."
"Put 50% of my daughters college fund in this in 2018 at $67. No debt, plus a good start on grad school. Thank you Target."
"TGT is sky-rocketing out of the stratosphere. Great retailer and wonderful blue-chip, dividend paying stock."
"I bought Target betting on the big increase of app downloads, online presence and ""Chip and Joanna"". My wife and daughter love Target. I figured I can recoup the money they spend after Target announced a good earnings report tomorrow. Am I nuts? Lol"
"Funny, Amazon's bathrooms look an awful lot like my own."
my apologies Texas
Very good result and 24% jump in online sales
The put options are far out numbering the call options. I don't see how this can get traction for a big move up
"Target stock is going down, down, down. They forgot the first rule of retail: respect your customers. Sad! Another victim of left wing identity politics. NFL is next."
"Should be back to $190 and over $200 soon , . Best retail store with all kinds of stuff going on . What's not to like . Levis, Ulta ,cvs r/x good stuff . This is a bargain will never be this low . I wish I could of added but tapped out ."
I am gonna let you try your best to salvage this situation. Just never claimed to have passed the bar.
"Sad thing is, I could fix Target in a couple weeks, but the fact that the Brian has not been shown the door already shows they plan to ride this company into oblivion."
"Regressive, refer to Chapter 13, titled ""Leading From Behind"" in ""The Art Of The Deal"". There is a detailed description of how to negotiate a deal by showing your weak hand. It's beautiful. Also, I appreciate a post dedicated just to saying ""bye"" to me."
"At about 5:15 p.m. Tuesday, October 16, a 10-year-old girl went into the women’s bathroom at the Target in Woburn. An adult biological male who identifies as a woman went into the bathroom afterward.According to Andrew Beckwith, president of the Massachusetts Family Institute, who says he has spoken with the girl’s father, the transgender adult banged on the door of the stall the girl was in.The adult commented on the girl’s T-shirt and offered her candy. The adult also changed clothes in the bathroom. The girl and the adult were the only ones in the bathroom at the time.The girl left the bathroom and later that evening told her parents what happened. Her parents contacted police, who met with the girl and her parents at the Target that night and identified the adult using surveillance video provided by the store. https://newbostonpost.com/2018/10/30/what-happened-at-woburn-target-murky-bathroom-encounter-roils-question-3-campaign/"
$130 by end of week.
This is such a great short at the moment! Buying puts and selling calls if we open above $106 tomorrow
"I think the reversal starts now, headed back to $125!!"
Let's hope the end of this selloff is in sight soon or someone please lend me $100 M to go shopping for discounted tech stocks!
I agree with you Ark. great time to have cash
The boycott continues to pull target down. Victory friends. Keep up the good work.
"Stopped by Target today, with the wife and daughter. Saved $0.37 on a large bottle of A-1 Steak Sauce, plus an additional $0.18 using my Red Card. My wife and daughter got to watch NUT JOB jerking off in the ladies' room next to them, while filming them on his phone. Target manager lectured them on their bigotry when they complained, said he ""identified as a woman"" that day, and told them not to come back until they were ""woke"". Pretty memorable experience! Thanks Target management! Thanks Brian Cornhole!"
"Target had an outstanding first quarter,"
target can't be stopped shorts can only hope to contain it. I see a run up to $120
Target price upgrades will be coming in over next few days
"Target Corporation is up 3 percent in 12 years! This is called BAD MANAGEMENT, folks. The bad stock performance is only one symptom of the rot that permeates upper management in this company, the other is the WORLD FAMOUS BIGOTRY OF WOMENS' RIGHTS exhibited by a corporation that lets ANY AND ALL MEN INTO ITS LADIES ROOMS, NO QUESTIONS ASKED, as part of its SHEEPLIKE DEVOTION TO MENTAL ILLNESS o the LGBTQXYZ lobby."
"TGT up 44% from a year ago. DOESN'T ANYONE KNOW ABOUT THE ""boycott""? ;)"
"All fear isn't irrational. Amazon is known to be an industry game changer. B&M retail hasn't had anything radical happen to it in years. We have self-checkouts that we didn't have 15 years ago... that's about it. Amazon's store in Seattle has literally no lines and no checkout and I expect Whole Foods will have no lines, no checkout option within a year or so."
"Show me a clean bath-room, and I'll show U a good franchise."
Retest of $61 coming. Get ready to add more.
"When TGT was trading at $60, some people were more interested in denying fellow Americans access to the bathroom. And they come here to complain about it. I wonder what they are talking about now. Sad."
Man I needed this one after HD missed
"WMT New high and New high, TGT sure be follow WMT to new high in this year, because TGT things cheaper than same retailers and on line store, but it's profit margin higher than same retailers and on line store."
TGT going down to 115 this week
What do you do when nobody you know including your own family will talk to you? You post everyday nonstop on a yahoo forum trying to get someone anyone to listen to you. Thats why pathetic timmy can post here all weekend and even holidays. Literally everyone he has met IRL avoids him. Keep up the good fight tim its better to have to here ranting than out in public.
"Why aren't ""Texas"" and Sarah here telling us about the million strong ""boycott"" that is going to crush Target? LOL!"
"disappointing, but not all bad. Sales still grew YOY and we had 6 less days brown Thanksgiving and Christmas compared to last year. Cornell is maintaining earnings guidance."
I shop at target occasionally but Im not a regular. I sold my stock in the 70's right after the transgender social experiment that backfired in Targets face. Was considering buying it again at 55 but the stores I visited are almost empty. Only 4 check lanes out of 12 were open. Wal-Mart and Amazon are eating target alive and it will soon be a retail zombie unless the current CEO and his troop of dancing imbeciles on the inner circle are gone. Until then I cant buy as I dont buy dogs waiting to be euthanized.
"4200+ comments, 10 months of bathroom trolling but ""hey guys just so you know I never explicitly said that I shorted TGT"" -- signed, yours truly, a board certified weasel."
. BUBBLE WARNING Mark this post. This is the Mark HainesLike post from 2008 when he said we've reached the bottom yet this is The YOU HIT THE TOP
Question: How many perverts have to be arrested in Target stores before Target stops letting men into ladies' rooms? How many assaults will it take?
"$89.10. That was the s.p. of WMT when that comment was made (Thursday, 3/1/2018). Now it's 87.53. It's really not a big deal that WMT has dropped a couple of bucks since your ""good entry point"" comment. I am bringing it up as a response to your obsession with TGT. As for how you repeatedly bring up Creighton from CHK board, sounds to me like you are in love. Would you like me to introduce you to him? Just ask."
Target is benefiting from people stock piling due to CV! February sales up BIG!
Expecting eps in line with high end of guidance and almost certainly a Div increase coming in May
Looks like yahoo is censoring posts again
I bought 1000 at $55 for my wife's account about 2 weeks ago for the dividend. Sold today because TGT went up more than the annual dividend. She is very happy about that.
128 next two weeks
"Target still rated a strong buy, many retailers down today including Costco, Home Depot, Ulta. Retail sales numbers out on Friday were down significantly to consensus, just selling off a little today with the holiday yesterday. When the $1.9 trillion gets approved and stimulus goes out, batten down the hatches, this will hit $225 in no time."
"Higher income and sophistication go to Target, mainly women."
This will crash down. Way overpriced
Was on my to Costco on Saturday to buy some outdoor chairs and stopped by Target to pick up an inexpensive long lounge chair for my wife to lay out on...I wound up buying all the outdoor stuff at Target(Great selection and lots of color!) and other stuff I wanted too. While walking back to the van I looked back at the store and parking lot and thought I have to check the stock price because this place is going to sell a lot of stuff! And that was before I saw the upgrade by Barlays. This is what Costco looked like right before it went from 204...straight up!
it's amazing the lack of respect this stock gets compared to Wal Mart. unreal
Cornell alternates qtr performance. Investors know this. With consumer behaviour returning to normal and the exodus to suburbs and rural areas TGT urban stores have less traffic and ecomm. Look at the weekly consecutive performance. July and august are bad
"Support at $110, it is not time buy buy TGT. wait for big move down."
"Peaked, still over bought. GOP buyers will not spend there!!"
no one wants to sell tgt stock now
If M and JWN came come big just imagine what TGT will do after earnings are released. $80+
Is the boycott over? Do we love Target?
Why up??? You sell the news!
Look Sarha Anon aka AnonIsANutJob got a new account lol!

"$TSLA puts out a new semi truck product, $CMI and others are worried now as they have entered their markets. $WMT preorders trucks to test, would $TGT $BBY and maybe even $AMZN doing the same?"
"it reached 52wk high, by friday of not week it will drop. it has to. every stock drops from 52wk high. this will too. not a bad thing it just happens."
*NEWS FLASH* TGT stock STILL IN THE $50's!!!
Target was Targeted by the shorts today!!! Imma go talk to my REDDIT buddies. Fn bs what happened here today!!!
Deceptive and sahra lost the boycott
Charts appear to show that TGT has topped and should drop a little more before running up again... but then look at today - market is down and TGT is defying the downtrend. I see the second bathroom guy is back with a new account. Good for you buddy! I say.. guys go ahead and bring this stock down if you. I'd like to buy it back in the 60s. Thanks in advance.
"Why Target is a Good store. The Target my wife and I shop at is a newer store. it is clean, the staff is helpful, the merchandise is well displayed, there is plenty of parking, prices are competitive and the store just looks nice. Down the road is walmart. The store is old, the people who work there are poor and not helpful and the crowd they attract are really a bunch of depressed, low socioeconomic types. Because of the way target looks, they get a much higher on the socioeconomic scale type of person and is just a better shopping experience. It might take time, but Target will make a comeback."
Does anyone actually believe that the Target CEO Brian Cornell has done right by his employees and stockholders?
Maggot still can't answer a direct honest question - how is it that the maggot is purportedly preaching women's safety but still supporting Daddy T's pardon of the guy who put a webcam in women's bathrooms? All he does is bring up his criminal fantasies indirectly. I guess that's what maggots do.
"Wow, the entire market has dropped the most ever in December since... the Great Depression.Wow. I wonder why. Wow. Wow. I wonder what's going on with the bathrooms in wall street."
Lows of the day. Say hello to the 80's soon
Why is WalMart and Amazon hitting all time highs and Target is 25% off it's high? seems like an opportunity
"Until Cornell is fired, this stock will continue to decline. I advise any shareholders to get out at least until then."
Seems Brian hiring Jeff Burt from Krogers to turn around their groceries didn't pan out. :-(
"Target starting new shipping distribution in Phoenix,taking UPS OUT OF THE LOOP,"
"I wish Dr PantCrapper knew of the mistakes I have made where I have actually lost money. His SQ paper trade has been nothing but a money tree. As of today (after I covered my last short trade this morning), 1 extra digit has been added to the YTD gains. I am sure you remember the last number."
"If you’re smart, buy stocks that have been negatively impacted from this standoff."
Hopefully close at $110 today
2 days RED in a row. ....can we have a trifecta. hahaha
"I guess it's not ""obvious"" to some people how they share many views with the Austin Bomber. Just a coincidence, I am sure."
A lot of Muscle behind Target
if this is a beat why am I taking a loss makes zero sense
"If you see a beautiful woman at Target, follow her into the ladies' room. Nobody will ask you what you're doing, Target management will be perfectly cool with it. Try to strike up a conversation, maybe take out your phone and snap a few pictures."
"TGT still barely down. I guess the ""boycott"" must really be waning!"
really was a hater on target since 90. today signed up for target online they have changed my mind and surprised how well they are doing this year
"I'm sure Target's small stores will do well in urban centers, with $15 minimum wage, sky high taxes and expenses, shoplifting, and sky high real estate taxes. They'll do great."
Now maybe you can teach me something? Will the 6200 calls limit the upside to the common until they expire?
"I used to work at target a few years ago. What most people don’t see is the brand loyalty. People LOVE going to target. My wife and her boyfriend probably go here every weekend. Combine that customer loyalty with a well run business and you have a home run people. Buy, buy, buy."
TGT easily going back to mid $90's You've seen the highest. Puts & short here $105.37 for a quicky (under 1 month) 10% gainer
Broke neck. Breakout. 10 points.
"Not buying TGT here is a mistake ,just see what WALMART did .This two companies have now an outstanding on line sales profile and the stores never closed due to corona ....$135 tomorrow"
"Are U selling Covered Calls or Puts? No one really knows what exactly the price will be, but I guess U are asking someone to give an educated guess."
manipulation at its finest ..
Amazing how the stock is falling this morning. The focus seems to be on looking back to the lower holiday sales rather then looking at whats happening today. It's like someone trying to drive a car by looking through the rearview mirror to see the road ahead! Everything I see in the discussion indicates that Target is off to a great year. Flush the fools and onward to $80.00 stock price!
10 REAL people with superpowers caught on tape. You know what this means? Sell TGT stock asaphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnGz2ouJm7w

"I’m getting in during this fire sale. My perspective is that you want to hold growth companies in the retail sector. They will have ups and downs, but they’re top line growth annually is what matters as they continue to grab market share. Consider that TGT digital sales rose 19%. That’s a growth story compared to other retailers who have posted no growth this season. Net TGT’s become a victim of their own success. Remember, CEO is holding the earnings guidance steady for the year. What he’s doing is setting expectations low so they can beat it come March."
It is time to buy to prepare for big ER on 11/20
"Target's bathrooms are sparkling clean. The porcelain bowls in the lavatory stalls are polished and gleaming. The bowls are clean enough to eat off of. Next to McDonald's, Target bathrooms are the cleanest in the country. The odds of running in to a member of the 3rd sex in a Target rest-room are miniscule. I would not worry. I am officially ending the Target boycott, and calling on everyone to shop at Target once again. I am also inviting investors to buy Target stock. Target is one of the great American retailers and I am encouraging everyone to jump on board in some shape form or fashion. Even if it's just having a Starbuck's coffee in the Target Café and using the rest-room to take care of personal business. Any patronage is appreciated. Thank You and Good Blessings All."
TGT in big Technical breakout. Look for ongoing upside. Any pullback should be considered a buying opportunity for adding to your long position. Stall out likely to occur at ~$120-$130 range before any big reversal or correction occurs (may take months or into next year).
This is not a value/divi stock at these levels and under these market conditions. After 8/23 options get wiped this is going to $95-98 on Monday...
Great end of day sell off! :-)

"I used to really like shopping at Target, but when they decided to put political ideology over the views, rights, and safety of women and young girls, I turned against them. I'm happy to see their stock collapse if that's what it takes to teach these liberal fascists to stay out of our private lives."
"This company was literally born again and could have a run for the ages. Their combination of brick and mortar could be second to none and will thrive in a prolonged recession. Profit margins may take a bit of a hit, but taking care of employees all while seeing an increase in sales will pay massive dividends in the future. Just my opinion here."

I don't think TGT Target fully realizes the debt of the consumer and it is a fine line that can turn against TGT.
Upgrades coming. $135 + imminent.
The boycott continues to eat away at Target. Just think of the billions in lost revenue.
"At last report, Target is still inviting any creep, including sex offenders, voyeurs, and child molesters into Target ladies rooms with their female customers. Please call Target Corporate in Minnesota and ask them how long they intend to put women at risk."

It hopes to make up in volume what it loses in revenue.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-target-corporation-stock-lower-164606374.htmlHere’s what I like about Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT): Its stores have most of the everyday stuff I need, there’s a store down the street and prices are very reasonable — even downright cheap. Regrettably, that does not mean TGT stock is a good investment. The most important metric for any retail store is same-store sales and, in the case of Target, that metric is awful."

"For those thinking of closing out long positions due to sluggishness in the rise of stock price (such as myself), IMO, Hold em...Since reported earnings (03/05), TGT has consistently set higher lows every single day and as of today, a 13-week HI @78.01 & After-Mkt. Close @78.00. ADX on a steady rise right around 46.35, DI(+) @32.47, and DI(-) @8.43. This may be the week we finally see that breakout that we expected the week of earnings."

"It boggles my mind that those against Target due to their interpretation of the bathroom policy continue to post here with the belief they are influencing people to not shop at Target. Hate to break it to you, but the only people who check out this board typically already have a vested interest in TGT stock. Those people are not going to not shop at Target. And posting anti-Target only makes those vested in Target put more energy into seeing Target do well. Do they really think the average shopper is on an investment message board trying to decide if they want to shop at Target? What is their goal in all of this. Also, posting stories of incidents in a changing room area does not prove your point. Dressing rooms at Target, and pretty much every store in this country, are for men and women. Also notice how in every article posted, Target has contacted the authorities and worked with law enforcement to catch those responsible. So, those stories never prove your point.Every post by Sarah and DD and other anti-Target posters only make those actually reading this message board that have invested in Target that much more loyal to the brand. Because of those posters, I make a point to talk up Target to friends and family way more than any other company I have stock in. So, thanks for making me a more loyal Target shopper and stock holder.Oh, and glad to see Target stock up again today!"

"The last time the Target stock price was at 54.12 was over 5 years ago. In contrast, Walmart, which DID NOT advertise that they are allowing men to share ladies' rooms with their female customers, is flying high. Either Target is tanking because the consumer boycott, or they have the most incompetent managers on the planet. Or both. And what is this great idea for a high volume discount chain, with thin profit margins, to open SMALL, HIGH COST URBAN OPERATIONS AS A BUSINESS STRATEGY? Utterly moronic. No wonder this thing is dying."

"So, Kevin finds a story about a man assaulting a young girl in a Walmart bathroom, and thinks that this somehow proves that Target's policy of letting any and all men into their ladies' rooms, no questions asked, is sensible. Actually Kevin, if you look at the relevant preponderance of these stories, you will find that many, many more if these types of incidents have occurred in Target stores, even though Walmart has many more stores. And that's before we address the absurd logic of your beliefs, i.e., that since predators can attack anyone at any time anyway, we might as well just give them carte blanche in ladies' rooms. But I know you social justice warriors aren't really rational in any case, so whatever."
Does local owner still post here non stop? If he does I just want to say keep boycotting!!! Not having people like him in TGT stores has been great for foot traffic. bwahahahahaha hahahahahaha thanks for making me richer chump.

"Many more people now going to alternative stores like WMT vs. the TRANSGENDER/TARGET stores.I don't know about you but I believe TRANSGENDERS don't want heterosexuals to patronize stores with them.So, I am going to concede these PATHETIC TRANSGENDER/TARGET stores to them.

"Has anyone tried the Target brand wine yet? It's supposed to not be on sale until Sunday, but the store here already had it last weekend. The Pinot Grigio is awfully good for a $5 bottle."
I still find it hard to believe that Target’s management and more shockingly the so called stock experts still are not willing to admit that the transgender bathroom policy and subsequent boycott are a major factor in the stock’s decline. Nearly one and a half million people signed up for the boycott of Target. That is just the people who signed it. This doesn’t include the people who just quietly walked away from Target. Target stock was on an upward trend until 19 July 2016. On that day the stock closed at 83.98 and Target announced its new transgender friendly bathroom policy. In the wake of the announcement a conservative group announced a boycott of Target and the stock started to drop. The CEO did not care and made excuses for the drop like Daffy Duck on the bridge of the Titanic claiming that the water in the boat was from a flooded toilet. The liberals attacked Chic Fil A because of statements made by the owner about his view of marriage. Chic Fil A sees a huge increase in sales. Hobby Lobby was attacked by the left for objecting to providing abortives and contraceptives in its health care plan. They to saw a huge outpouring of support and increased sales. Target decides to side with a very small minority of the population at the expense of the safety and comfort of the rest of the population and sees its sales and stock drop. But because it’s not politically correct to admit its policy had any affect they stick their head in the sand and try to fix the leaking toilet ignoring the hole caused by the iceberg.
THE BOYCOTT OF TARGET IS WORKING. WE WILL PUT TARGET OUT OF BUSINESS.
I stopped shopping there 2 years ago. Their merchandise and their bathroom policies are not to my liking. So I am exercising free will. I go to Amazon.com I don't have to look at politically correct ads from Target and I don't care where Amazon employees do #1 or #2
"Just to correct Sarah's ""alternative facts"": The market is up 37% (not 50%) since the p.g. won the electoral vote in November 2016. It's up .03% since January 1, 2018 (17 months ago, right after the p.g. passed his corporate tax-cuts... decievingly referred to by the p.g. as ""tax reform""). It rose 138% during Obama's term."
"Target has launched their Target Restock service in Minnesota today to Red Card holders. Similar to Amazon's Pantry service, but delivers in 1 day vs Amazon's average 4 days and is $1 cheaper for the delivery. Target ships all items in one box vs several boxes, and ships from local stores. This is likely to be a big money saver for Target."
TGT moving up. Up on December 24 when the market tanked. Up on December 26 despite overall market weakness. Going back to $67 this week? Likely.
Kids wanted some oj when we were just out a second ago. Only near a safeway so I had to buy 2 no pulp 12oz for 1.99 each. Just a 1.49 are your local tgt for the exact same brand and size. Real prices no fake news. How can people afford to shop anywhere but tgt?

"Buyer beware! I asked my son to buy a Target gift card. He bought an American Express gift card which had a 40% surcharge on it. I asked him to return the card and the Target customer service people here in Katy, TX just laughed and said there are not gift card returns. Target and American Express both have ethics issues and socially prey upon consumers."
"At this rate, Target will be in the 50's by March 31, just like I predicted."
"Why can't we be smart like Walmart? Walmart refused to comment on any bathroom policy. Why do we have to have a political activist CEO? Can we fire Brian Cornell? Maybe we should all contact investor relations and tell them to fire Brian Cornell. How stupid can he be, by getting Targtet involved in a political controversy? We are shareholders, not constitutents for any political cause. We all should call for his ouster by contacting investor relations and other methods."
"This Indiana State Representative disliked gay rights so much that he backed a constitutional amendment to define marriage as between a man and a woman in a bid to block same-sex marriage ever happening.He then allegedly tried to pay an 18-year-old boy he met on Craigslist to have sexual relations with him, according to emails reported in the Indy Star. Hinkle subsequently is reported as trying to buy the boy’s silence with an iPad, a BlackBerry, and $100 cash."

"Of course the fake news media doesn't mention the boycott when it comes to Target. Most of them produce nothing but garbage propaganda controlled by liberals and the Democratic Party.

Regardless if you are a liberal or conservative... why the hell would you take political stances as a company?? This alienates 50% of your consumers. Just ask the morons on Targets executive team how that worked for them. Targets lost 15% of its stock value in 52 weeks. This resulted in a 3 billion dollar market cap loss. Add that with a struggling retail environment and things are not looking good for Target. I hope the board of directors come in and clean house.
Predicting a fall coming up in the next week. probably back down to 70s
Imagine being the CEO of target and siding with the people who destroyed your target...
"The volume profile today suggests that TGT is getting bought. Moves up with higher volume, price sags as volume sags. This is bullish. If the market goes up next week, so will TGT."
"I think it's interesting and not just a little bit funny, that Brian Cornell, in response to declining traffic, sales, and profits at of Target's traditional big stores (primarily due to a boycott by millions of customers in red states), has decided that he's simply going to build more stores in blue states.So, let's see here. Target is a discount retailer. It's business model consists of buying mass produced cheap merchandise from China, with a little value added by a good design team, marked up but sold cheap in huge stores located in low-cost areas. But now, because he has driven away his core demographic, he's going to change the whole operation to a new business model: smaller stores in urban areas.But the problem here is that urban stores are very expensive to run. How can you sell stuff cheaply when you just increased your operating costs substantially? You can't.This is just pure ideologically drive insanity."
WOW...in July 2015 Target stock hit $85.....what could have happened ?
"Another day, and Sarah is still refusing to acknowledge that the ""boycott"" turned out to be a ""nothing burger"". Sad."
Very similar trend as last post earnings. I fell victim to trying to short banking on a pull back and it just refused to go red. Target should be at least at the same multiple if not more than Walmart. Planning on buying some calls for next week either this afternoon or tomorrow near close. This should touch $130 by eoy

Looks like there’s a lot of fun nutjobs on this board. I just bought TGT for the first time at 71 yesterday in AH and added some more today. Just looking for retail exposure for this consumer spending binge we’re all expecting.
Best stock to own. Very low P/E compared to Amazon and Wal-Mart.

Stop limit sell: market price is $125. I set stop limit price of $124.95. And limit price of $130. When price fluctuates to $124.95 or lower then I get the limit price set to $130? It hit my stop limit price but didn’t triggered at all in RH.

why its not giving up when market going red
Poison or sweet to bite? Thinking...

"Earnings are always a gamble but my educated guess based on results from M and WMT is that TGT had a good quarter. Looking ahead, it's becoming more and more clear that JCP will eventually disappear - maybe 1 more year? TGT should benefit some from that (but so will M, KSS, etc).. I just get the feeling that even if TGT drops in the short term because of average earnings.. in the long term - by December 2019 - this is a $100 stock."
Go to the Target bathrooms. They're beautiful. Spend a lot of time in there and be comfortable. Then spend a lot of money in the Target store $$$. They have everything U need. Then hang out in the Target Cafe and drink delicious coffee and eat coffee cake. Life is beautiful and U can be happy at Target.
I was at a mall yesterday that has a Target. The store was maybe half full. The rest of the mall was packed. The boycott is alive and well.

"Regressive, my friend, it's all about the bottom line. Yes I will buy TGT again.. don't know about 69.90 though. Those who are invested right now are necessarily making a bad call by staying long. If I make $100 by trading TGT, I pay $35 in taxes.If I make $100 by staying long on TGT for at least 1 year (which many here seem to be doing), I'd pay $15 in taxes and my dividend will also get taxed at 15% - so it all depends."
Bought some shares under 68.50. What a bargain.as we get into the holiday shopping this stock will only go up. TGT always tanks after earnings and always recovers within a few weeks to a month. I feel confident I can sell my shares way above $72 before New Years.
"Bought at $123.58 this morning. Long term holder with all my investments. So far, so good!"
"It's worth not blocking Sarah just so that you can learn new words like ""retardification"". ;)"

"TGT is high temp due to holidays season and other retail competitions winding the businesses - should focus more on offering vs discounts for long run so its all illusive numbers, they carry pretty common and limited consumer products compare to what's available in the market so competition and no specialized attractions so it would be hard to sustain in long run with giving so many discounts and drawings very thin profit."

"Target had a good earnings report, but that does not change the FACT that a lot of people are avoiding Target because of their bathroom policy and that Target is allying with the PREVERTS over the regular person.!!! I do go there occasionally, to use the bathroom to #$%$ on Target for free. Women do not bother to follow the men into the rest room. Then I leave without buying anything. Because their stores all usually empty and you can park close and get in and out quickly"

90 this week. Easy.
"This is what I was fully expecting when I purchased at $51 this summer. High dividend with the probability of rebounding back to its original value + more. I really like the strategy of small acquisitions and focusing on investing in your company. Look what happened to GE when they just try to acquire talent and good businesses and not build It themselves. The CEO catches a lot of heat, but I like what he’s been doing the past 7-8 months. They saw a problem in their strategy and revised, then invested in it. The + more I see in this stock is the user interface (online and app), obviously the App is amazing and the best in retail. The other big plus that I am counting a big return on is using their stores, not just as physical stores, but dubbing them as distribution centers. The big amazon takeover talk is only because amazon would buy target and do this to their stores. Target would have a major win and send the stock to over $100 if they can successfully use their super targets and large footprint stores as stores and distribution centers to allow for same day - 1 day deliveries in the future. This would attract a lot more online orders and be a stronger efficient use of their space. A lot of work still to be made on that front, but they need to beat amazon to that punch while they can. Target has the upper hand on this front, they have the brick and mortar but amazon does not. Amazon is having to pay a lot more for warehouse space now since the prices are rising in urban areas."
You know what I’m going to sell all my shares cuz you said so about target  since you started posting the market goes up so keep posting maybe I can get more few thousand dollars  
Making your stand against Christian values is never wise for a company or anyone for that matter. It amounts to declaring war on God.
"Sarah: Why would any of us even waste any time commenting on the ""boycott"" when it's so clearly turned out to be a ""nothing burger""? ;)"
"@RegressiveLiarTakingACrap (not name calling), why do you misquote people? TGT ""is"" not back into the 60's. That could happen next week but that's not the case at the moment. You have said the following about TGT's price - all within the last one week - and with no timeline: (1) ""50's"", (2) ""low 50's"", (3) ""high 50's"", (4) ""60's"". Without timeline, these predictions are not meaningful."
TGT announced very profitable smaller store format reinforced that fact the strategy of providing convenience to customers is working in a buzzing city like New York. It appears short squeeze is happening and squeezing hard. Still needs 7 days to cover.
I bet TGT will end the day green

Also bought some DASH, I'm confident that long term these plays will pay off."

Went through a Target store recently looking for a few items and found it difficult to avoid items made in China. Trying to do our part to help the trade imbalance with China and Mexico but it is not easy. Iff we all look for items from the US or other fairer trading partners it would make a big difference. We control the consumer spending dollar and have the power to effect change directly and quickly here. Let’s act instead of talk the issue to death put the China product back on the self and spend our money more wisely. Make it happen today and everyday forward until the issue is solved. Take action you have the controls on this one.

Good luck TGT longs!"

The rest will come from loans (debt) or future earnings which are declining!!! I guess that means no new stores, no expansion, no upgrades to existing stores. Kinda reminds me of K-Mart."

This CEO refuses to listen to customers. Its all about their bathroom transgender policy. I stopped shopping at Target a year ago and I used to prefer them over Walmart. Many families we know also stopped shopping there. Target needs a new CEO who will get off the political platform. One who will listen to his customers and focus on running the business

I have found that even the most terrible decisions typically have some kind of reasoning behind them. I still can't for the life of me begin to understand this decision, given that Target, as a public company, exists to serve profit-minded shareholders.Here are a few predictions. This earnings call will be a complete disaster, followed by more of the same in upcoming quarters. Next year the board gets replaced and Cornell gets fired. I may never understand their reasoning, but the future results of this decision are so clear to me."
"Four days ago sarha/Sean/Local Perv - ""Amazon is great, I don't see it as a problem at all. What's more, with Amazon I don't have to worry about perverted bigots like Dave forcing their insanity on my wife and daughters.""Today - finds out Amazon provided money toward a political cause that effectively applied Target's policy to an entire state.sarha/Sean/Local Perv today - *Crickets*"
"Wow, A new 52 week H...... Doh! Still meandering in the $50's."
"Just my personal experience, the stay at home moms I know who used to shop there with their children don't like the bathroom law and haven't shopped their since."
"Also, Target must be cutting massive staff because I saw a huge number of self-checkout lanes. Is this a change that Cornell is instituting as ""store renovation""? Cutting staff through automation? Now it all makes sense. He's trying to cut expenses by reducing staff! Not by increasing sales, mind you, which is what a healthy retailer would do. It also explains the sorry state of the store merchandise. Things not looking good at Target, not at all."
Nearly impossible to guess the bottom on TGT. Bad past report and this tariff issue but clearly future promise with improving stores and potential to be bought by AMZN.
we should touch all-time high this week
"Knowing that the ""boycott"" turned out to be a ""nothing burger"" makes Sarah out of his/er gourd with RWNJ!"
I applaud Target for raising their minimum wage until reach $15 per hour by 2020. Target knows it will affect their profits but at the end of day will be positive PR with increased traffic in store and online.
"TGT will survive this. Every Target I go in is looking quite healthy. They make changes where other stores hang out in the past. Also, there are a lot of people that aren't even aware of the bathroom stuff, lol."
"Ignored by the fake news media, of course, are those women who are victimized by the idea that any man who claims to ""feel like a woman today"" should be able to compete against women in womens' sports, thus depriving actual women of opportunities that rightfully belong to them.

Sales continue to decline. Just wait till holiday season. Bye bye

Numbers are not bad. This should recover today or close little down.
I am so happy I did not buy TGT last month.
In our community our police keep an online crime map updated. Target has nothing showing despite their super duper dangerous bathroom policy however Walmart has multiple offenses.. dozens on a monthly basis and some of them are assaults and vandalism. It's not all shop lifting! It would seem to me that Walmart has a boycott worthy policy of not keeping the shopping area safe for its guests. what a burden they place on our police department.

"I've double-insured as many of my positions as I could today. I bought PUTs on everything, just in case Trump and Kim (and Trump's boss, Putin) end the world tomorrow. I'm buying the priciest insurance, near or at-the-money PUTs expiring this Friday. Buying PUTs on $FB, $AAPL, $ADBE, $NVDA, $BOOM, $IBKR, $MU, $GOOS, $NTNX, $AAOI, $TGTMost likely, Putin will not expose his puppet tomorrow. Why do that, when he can be used to sow so much more discord in the Western World, while Putin strengthens Russia and its allies' positions? But blowing the Manchurian candidate's cover tomorrow would be like dropping a nuke on Democracy and would throw everything into disarray, because he would expose not only Trump but hundreds of our politicians as traitors. It could take years or decades to recover, if we ever do. This is much worse than Watergate.Anyway, I think that ""nothing"" will happen tomorrow. Trump will probably achieve ""success"" at the summit, which will help get more Republicans into office in a few months, giving him yet more power to destroy the institutions of Western Democracy. Putin and maybe China too are probably encouraging Kim and Trump (their puppets).So, all these PUTs will probably expire worthless. But I see tomorrow as a day of great danger for a black swan event, and so I think it's worth it just this once."

"Guys, remember now, it is a retailer, not a high flying technology stock that may revolutionize how business is done or even life. It has a P/E over 18, that is above the market average of 16 and that is factoring a ridiculously highly valued tech sector, stocks with triple digit P/Es, not even a tech stock deserves that. Is this really undervalued? And don't compare it to the likes of Wal-mart, Five Below, TJ Maxx, Ross, Children's Place or Ulta, they are grossly over valued as well. Again, all they do is buy stuff from a manufacturer and sell it to a consumer, not rocket science. I give them credit though for their development of an omni-channel sales mechanism, that will be crucial going forward and they indeed are well positioned, but again, buy low and sell high, that doesn't deserve a P/E over 18."
Target beat the er why is premarket down can someone explain?
"TGT Chart is fulfilling its cup-n-Handle pattern (very bullish) with uptrend still intact on right side handle. The algorithms are programmed to trade this and will likely continue to push it higher, likely to $120 based on Technicals before the downside part of Handle occurs back to low $90 or $100 range. Expect a ongoing slow grind higher with periodic small dips that recover to grind higher making new highs. I would not expect the gap (low $90) to be filled until next year sometime."

Liars. All. Of. Them.Target cuts outlook as sales declineBy Lisa BeilfussPublished: Aug 17, 2016 7:17 a.m. ET Target Corp. said sales at existing stores fell for the first time in more than two years and warned of further weakness, a sign that Chief Executive Brian Cornell's turnaround push has stalled.The retailer cut its view for the full year, now forecasting $4.80 to $5.20 in adjusted earnings per share, after saying in May that its original target of $5.20 to $5.40 was still achievable despite weakness in the first half. For the year, Target expects same-store sales to be flat to down 2%.For the current quarter ending in September, Target expects to earn an adjusted 75 cents to 95 cents a share, compared with the 95 cents analysts have expected.Shares of the company fell 4.5% to $72.05 in premarket trading.""Based on the current retail environment, the company believes it is prudent to lower its expectations for comparable sales in the second half of the year,"" Target said Wednesday. ""Although we are planning for a challenging environment in the back half of the year, we believe we have the right strategy to restore traffic and sales growth over time,"" said Chief Executive Brian Cornell."

Looks like TGT will correct soon after all which will be healthy for the stock and provide a very good setup for significant upside afterwards for later half of year (30% with $130 target). Checked my Broker and Shares can’t be borrowed anymore to Short the stock (this indicator informs Wall Street preparing to make money on some short term downside before swinging back to another long position for making money on the upside). Longs should be fine if planning to hold thru EOY if price hits $130.

TGT is overdue for a breakout. Tomorrow's earnings report should send it soaring.
"Analysts did not quite know how to value TGT so it traded in the middle of what dept, stores traded at and cos. like Wmt and Cost. Now TGT has proven that it is an Amazon survivor and deserves a pe the likes of the 2 cos. I mentioned. Wmt trades at a pe of 25, Cost 34. So to be conservative lets value TGT at a pe of 20 although I don't see why it would not be valued same as Wmt. Earnings are $6 so x 20 = $120, 25 pe= $150. In most cases a stock that has risen this fast would be considered a short opportunity. I don't think it applies this time rather the stock is catching up to it's fair market value so I see the upward march to $120, jmho"

Pretty sad that TGT stock is higher than WMT. Congrats to both on killing! We all can eat.
"As I've said all along AFA is not doing their boycott for bathroom safety, they are only masking it that way as they are upset that Target accepts the LGBTQ community.

For the past two years, Target stores have entire sections dedicated to products normalizing homosexuality. In many instances, profits from the sale of the products are donated to gay advocacy groups for the promotion of the lifestyle to children in public schools.""https://www.afa.net/activism/action-alerts/2017/05/the-news-for-target-is-getting-worse-and-worse/Get over it AFA, Target is just trying to make everyone feel welcome. Go ahead and double boycott them if you want. LOL"
"TGT is back, this shows the bathroom issue is only manufactured by intollerant and ignorant people"
any bathroom bashers left on here? lot of money made. I'm convinced it was big money scaring people out of their shares by acting like children
"I have a feeling Target will really get hammered when they release Q3 results. Stock in the 40's quite possible. Back to school sales are precisely in the wheelhouse for negative impacts from their insane ""every man who says so is a woman"" policy impacting the prvacy rights and personal security of women and children in their stores. And no amount of censoring by Yahoo moderators will change the fact that this policy has and will continue to result in crimes being committed."
"I believe TGT will hit $130. But find the stock in a precarious situation. Since it’s 30% increase after earnings and fulfilling its cup-n-Handle uptrend pattern, it looks like it may be at a turning point soon. It’s either going to do a 10% correction (that would be healthy for the stock and bring in new longer term buyers and sustainment for even higher stock prices), or if it breaks to a new high soon instead ($111) the stock will get to $130 much faster making 50% rise since earnings (this scenario concerns me the most for Longs since it will likely cause the stock to crash for a much deeper correction and longer recovery). So I’m rooting for the first for the benefit of Shareholders but time will tell."
"Recent declines in stock price is due to lower revenues and earnings, period. This was the result of online players like Amazon taking market share from target. Bathroom policy, politics, etc. is basically just noise and has very little impact on target's financial results."
Message to the Target Board: Its the transgender bathroom policy. That's the issue with your decline in sale! Get a new CEO! Find a CEO who will reach out to the millions of lost customers and focus on running the business and your business will pick right back up.
"I remember a few years ago when Abercrombie and Fitch decided that they were bigger than their market. They decided to post huge posters of near gay porn in front of and inside of all their stores. Many malls would not permit these posters, and A&F put up huge black shutters on their stores rather than take them down. A&F is dead, finito. This is what happens when a company becomes too involved in politics."
I did not predict this 6 days ago. Target offers same day delivery now.
How do you possibly buy at these levels? If you have even the most basic knowledge of technical investing this is flashing an 87 RSI. Wait until low 140's before you start a position.
Time for Target to carry Ivanka high fashion line  MAGA 
"Pretty quiet over here today, everyone from AFA must be over at the United Airlines message board.United Airlines, now that's a company who's policies inflict harm against its customers and the CEO doesn't deny it."
"Downside accelerating! This is sooooooo exciting! Get ready Bunny, soon TGT will be even MORE of a huge deal!"
"Cornells private label brands are marketed to perfection. Nobody is even aware that these brands are Target brands. Household essentials especially. Therefore people cannot judge, although that is not even necessary being that Target branded merch is really good quality. “All in motion” will not be marketed as Target’s brand. It will be marketed as “The Hot New Thing” that is sold at Target & people are going to buy, buy, buy it up! Our prices are better, our sales will be better, & our margins are better. Shorts are doomed."
Buying huge here....will take a high quality dividend of 3.3% anyday!!
"""Cornell's future with Target may be riding on the outcome of his turnaround strategy. With less than three years at the helm, the board is likely willing to give him some more time to return the company to growth, but if cutting prices and sprucing up stores fails to bring customers in the door, it could be time for the board to show him the door as well."" The Motley Fool.I see that door halfway open. Putting lipstick on a PIG isn't going to change foot traffic when adoption of a BIGOTED policy against women and young girls safety is still promoted."

wheres Buffalo Bill today aka Sarha? Do they sell nooses at TGT?
Easy money call options for July @ 67.50 :)
are retail sales a forward or lagging indicator?
"Lots of foolishness in many of the negative comments this morning. Stock prices, over time, are driven by EPS. We also know that a stock like TGT that doubles in a year will see a a jump in profit taking on anything other than stellar news. They didn’t sell as many four hundred dollar TVs at no margin pricing. Those big dollar items skew sales results disproportionately, but contribute little margin. Earnings story remains intact. The new year will bring increased earnings somewhere near $7 EPS, at about 20 PE. $135 to $140 per share. For every seller who will pay taxes on their recent gain, there’s a buyer that will make money on the 2020 gain, plus a very nice dividend."
Beautiful earnings
"I say ""Jump!"", Sarah asks ""How high?"""
Nothing more than overly emotional people and a great opportunity to add to the position.
Their Black Friday deals look great! Already got a shopping list

Short this pig until she bleeds.
"TGT doing well. Added some T, BUD, and WMT during the last few weeks. Also grabbed a 187.50 call yesterday since I did really well last week with a small call play. Stock has been running well since the earnings sell-off, lets hope this momentum continues "
Target's going to knock the cover off the ball next week. The new Disney additions should help going forward now that Disney+ has launched.
love u tgt more than my gf 
Anyone shorting this?
"All TGT stores being burnt down, no revenue."
"China trade issues may soon be over. When that happens, stocks that aren’t being boycotted will take off. Sorry immoral target investors, you lose"
"While I am not invested in TGT at the moment, imo - Walmart's weakness translates to Target's strengths. Target is doing what Walmart isn't doing so much - innovation. I have seen a number of changes in Target app in the last few months example 1. you can scan an item using your app and it shows the price, or 2. you can search for an item and app tells if it is in stock and the aisle where it is stocked, 3. App now features ""wallet"" so you all you need is your phone to shop at Target, etc."
"Large Consumer cyclical + largest US import companies had great quarters.$WMT$TGT$HD$LOW$DG$DLTR (don't like Dollar Tree Fundamentals, two of the above companies have beat earnings.)These big Five retailers have little ""middle man"" expenses + anticipation of tariffs results in increased Import Volume at cheaper costs."

"Hey sarha/Sean/Local Perv, have you ordered from Target online yet? You said that was fine for Amazon which has the same ""bathroom policy"" as Target. Lots of great deals and quality merchandise are waiting for you."
"Breaking news: It is still Target corporate policy to allow any and all men, including sex offenders, voyeurs, and transvestites into every Target ladies room, a policy which has led to hundreds of womens' rights being violated and dozens of arrests in Target stores in the last year. Target management and their supporters still believe that no woman has a right to privacy or safety in their stores. Any responsible parent will keep their children out of Target stores, and all women should be on notice that they are not safe in a Target store."
"I wonder if Target will announce they are going to have a tough quarter from trolls posting insanity on the Yahoo message board. seriously, what do all these alt-right homophobes think they are accomplishing by throwing shade on this board?"

"Zacks analysisTarget Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 24% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market"
I expect to go to 158 and drop
Buying opportunity. TGT is not WMT. Just getting dragged down here. WMT is a maskless mess and people are going elsewhere. TGT stores packed daily.
AFA of course did take their agenda out on Walgreens too. As with Target the boycott has had minimal to no impact on the company
hold onto some of shares don't sell all pre market. I believe we hit 125 today during regular market hours today
Don't understand why this stock hasn't rallied on the news about Sears. Any thoughts?
Fathers can now join their young daughters in the bathrooms to protect them from whatever may be there that endangers women. If you search violence at any large retail chain you find results. WalMart has much more of it than Target. Being Open 24 hours attractive to people who live out of their cars because they are wanted in 6 states across America. I also see people begging for money and food at WalMart at a much higher rate.. not that they scare me .. it's just a sad situation that Walmart attracts...

"I know that my family will spend $18,000 less this year at Target. We shop at Kroger and Costco now. This is the only boycott I have every really and truly participated in. This one I am sticking to. Who in the hell ever goes to Target to but an I phone? Don't you buy these from the Apple store? I know I always have. Now multiply $18,000 times 1.3 million. This is how much their sales will be down. Also if they have raised their prices to make up the difference hell just go to Kroger they are less cheaper anyway!"

"OK, now that the regular trading day is over, here's what I expect tomorrow morning: - First of all, I expect that results will be fairly good. They'll probably beat the ""official"" expectations and previous guidance. - I expect that the PPS during the pre-market will fluctuate between ""up"" and ""down"" - I expect some volatility during the regular trading, but I think it will generally be down (possibly quite a bit at some points during the day). I also expect it to end down a few dollars/share. - After tomorrow, I expect rationality to return and the PPS to be above where it is now within a few weeks.None of this has anything to do with bathrooms, ""the boycott"", ""the memo"", or any of that nonsense. It will mostly be because the PPS has increased so much during the past 6 months, and the general market is already making people jittery because it rose too much and too fast (mostly due to irrational exuberance on the part of pv55ygrabberists)."

Cameras were hidden throughout the house—in the bathrooms, bedrooms and “indoor recreational areas”—and recorded between 100 and 500 sexual encounters with other men."
almost back to 3 months low
classic double bottom formed in july. it's all north from here.
I'm selling. They have failed to fulfill three rather basic orders over the past month.
SECURE THE LOOT!
Only 36% of eps is going to pay the dividend. 4 billion/year for the next 4 years to improve business. I am buying the dips for passive retirement income off the dividend. This is a solid company and should be in everyone’s portfolio long term. I would love to see the dividend raised but I do like their business plan. GLTA longs!!
"As someone who shorts all kinds of stocks, I see very few reasons to short TGT. How much is the downside to nationwide retailer who saw same store sales grow 4% in January? Do you expect to cover at $68-69? Sure that's possible but you are going to need help from the market... which begs the question - if you think market is going to drop big, there are better ways out there to short the market."
I am just noticing that Target and walmart are almost the same stock price. anyone do a comparison of this?
Target won! The Boycott is dead!
That buying opportunity was from late day margin selling.

"Trip to Target yesterday. It was more crowded than I've seen it in a good while, as I've noticed other times I passed. Registers had lines, I went to self-serve but there were a few waiting. So I went back to a register, waited behind someone for ~2 minutes... and a girl came and opened the register in front! Smiling, upbeat, and she even apologized for my wait- 2 minutes! Compare that to Walmart..not even in the same universe as that mangled mess."
Will be 73 by end of week
nice jump AH
I’ll buy some shares at $55
All TGT holders should build a small shrine to Jeff Bezos in their homes and worship there daily. Bezos is an awesome dude. He has built a trillion dollar company and brought TGT and WMT back from the dead and he doesn't even work for those companies. He should be given a multi million dollar bonus by both companies.
More fake numbers to pump up this circus called the stock market
TGT: clear to sail target 72.60 and 76.50
Why on earth the estimate is 1.61? I feel since Walmart beat earnings they inflated target expected eps. What do you guys think ?

"The kind of liberal insanity typified by Target's bathroom policy is a danger to everyone in this country. Kids getting raped by illegal aliens in public schools in ""sancturary cities"" are also a problem. These liberals need to be slapped down hard."
"Reviewed TGT's earnings and while they missed on the bottom line, I was actually pretty thrilled overall. Traffic in stores was up quite nicely, most in a decade. Spending on remodels and e-commerce crimped margins, impacting bottom line, but will drive sales and profits longer term which is what I care about. Grocery improvements in remodeled stores is substantial. Not surprised with the 6% drop, but my thesis stays the same and I plan to hold for many years to come. Good luck TGT longs..."
Did you realize that 10% haircut from target and 10% uptrend in Walmart were triggered by Wall Street alone? We are just small potatoes that won’t have any influence outside of this board.
Think this will go up once earnings are released?

Do I have Schizophrenia? Why not. Regardless of what is going on with me - you two have accomplished nothing."

Could it be that consumers are simply front-loading (i.e. doomsday buyers) like businesses did before the first round of tariffs? The upside was primarily driving by apparel and essentials. Something doesn't seem right.
TGT missed earnings...maybe the analysis shot too high in their miss-guided predictions
Sarah's really out of her gourd again today.S/he continues to profess great love for Amazon despite the fact that they have exactly the same bathroom policy as Target. S/he also continues to refuse to acknowledge that inconvenient fact.

I have 3 friends that also have an interest in individual stocks. We 'try' to get together a couple times a month. Last got together on March 5th. Told them I opened a position in target in my HSA & IRA on March 2nd & added more on the 4th. None of them were impressed. I'm up 16.00% :)

In what way is this competition?"

Congratulations to everyone holding TGT through earnings!
This CEO is probably one of the biggest liars in corporate America. A repeated pattern of telling Wall St. that everything is great when it isn't. Repeated. But we have no SEC. No dog in this fight but it is still disturbing.
The boycott is really taking a toll on this company. I'll bet Brian Cornell wishes he had those millions of boycotting shoppers back.
"Don't forget the Target ""anything goes"" bathroom policy... it is coming back to haunt them."
"Note that this news story was scrubbed from Boston 25 news site after it was determined that the man who attempted to assault a 10 year old girl in a Target ladies' room ""identified as a woman"".Young girl says man tried to get into her bathroom stall at Woburn TargetWOBURN, Mass. - A ten-year-old girl said she was going the bathroom at the Target in Woburn when a man tried to get into her stall Tuesday evening. The man never gained entry and the girl was not hurt. She told her mother what happened and her mother filed a police report. Woburn Police would only tell Boston 25 News they’re actively investigating."
Target continues to plunge. The boycott continues to take its toll.

So love this stock is stuck where it was half a decade ago. Just awesome Karma Target!
"I am not sure I would be pumping how good Target is when, No one at the company could think out of the box and make sales just because the internet went down. Tells you they may have educated people , but for sure no one with any common sense. That is the major problem with the new generation. They have not learned to think out of the box , They are the really first generation that have not really developed their brains and are more like robots. Why because they are the first generation"

Mueller's fake investigation/witch hunt is the last gasp of the people who can't stand that Donald Trump was elected President and will do any damage to the country they have to in order to try and overturn the results of a democratic election.And Mueller's fake investigation is falling apart as we speak. Delicious.
Looks like this is going to bounce back up today!!! No reason for it to be taken down at all!! Could see 190+ in the next few weeks!!
"mmmm. . baffling report. Good third quarter (understatement) but giving lower guidance for fourth quarter. Local Target is doing well so perhaps they are planning mega price reductions or being deliberately cautious or both. Addition of the new ""Magnolia"" section won't hurt either."
"No faith. Right now it's ""show me the money"" for traders and short sellers. There will be massive short covering when sales numbers come out in about six weeks. Patience will be rewarded."
Looks like the boycott is really starting to bite. I'd sell this stock ASAP.
Did sarha go to prison after running over those people? Good thing another of the RWNJ hate group is behind bars. What a gross gross cult they have.
"So, when does TGT reverse the bathroom policy that drove away so many customers? I'm not picking sides on a social issue, but from a pure business standpoint, it was suicide. There just aren't enough non-Amazon transgender, gender-confused TGT supporters to ever make up the lost business. I'm really glad I sold at $78."
incredible the forward PE is 16.3. should rise with time.
"Gee, no WHINING from FTP QUARKY about losses from SQ. Funny how IT only whines when the price goes down. Gee, looks like SNAP is getting near that ""good low price"" lol. :-)"
"Prince Pv55y Grabber continues to go off on his ""theory"" that President Obama is actually a Muslim who faked his birth certificate. Sarah has admitted that s/he's a complete RWNJ who believes that this is possible.Deplorable."
market correction. this will go down almost everyday till market stops bleeding
funny.. tgt vs amzn.. David / Goliath... dave is getting crushed this time around...
"Buy the rumor, sell the news. Buying opportunity right here"
Kohl's and Home Depot not looking good. But Target is no Kohl's. Our Kohls is nearly always empty in contrast Target is almost always packed.
"Target is an awesome blue-chip retailer. The real estate holdings alone, will boggle the mind and make an investor go ""goo-goo, ga-ga."" Let's continue to invest in Target Corporation and grow old, fat, happy. and wealthy collecting robust dividends. Yes - Target is indeed the All-American retailer. Good Blessings All."
Consumer debt will eventually put a big burden on TGT future numbers. If Target thinks the consumer can contiue to spend as forcast they will be saddly disappointed as will share holders. This is a pretty good time to take profits although no stock analyst will tell you this now.
Full blown trade war coming -- get ready for recession.Shorting TGT here.
Longs should not feel bad about a pull back. A 5% pullback from a 52 week high is both good and healthy. Gets new longs to jump in with more confidence then having to pay full price. Sets the stock up to make new highs.
"Nut job, your kind amaze me. Did you notice the article said “Although more research is needed”? This means we need more money to give you the result you want. The article says GD affects 1% of the population. I say it’s no where near 1%. Even if we go with the 1%, that is not normal. Stop trying to normalize this fetish. The next fad liberals will throw out is pedophilia is normal. Will you support that BS too? It’s coming."
"YAAAAAA!!!! ""c"" can't post here anymore!!!!!"
"Local Owner has no life, outside of TGT. So sad, what a pathetic loser."
great earnings
this stock is like Home Depot in 2012 after Nardrlli destroyed it and sound management took over. I sold stock in HD and regret it. hold on to your TGT shares
LO has not posted in 4 days and Im worried. Im going to say he is either dead or in jail. If anyone has a way to get in touch with him please do. Its not the same around here without him posting the same 3 articles everyday.
"""hard right""?I never said that y'all get ""hard"" when thinking about the pv55y grabber (although I suspect that many of you do... thanks for confirming, Sarah)! You definitely _do_ worship the pv55y grabber, though. We've all seen that _many_ times over the past year."
"Barron's has an article about COST, that it should be every investor shopping cart. The PE is 31 vs TGT 19, TGT is growing faster than COST, and their online sales are growing much faster as well. Costco has 785 stores vs about 1900 for TGT. TGT has a lot more potential than Costco because of the location and the expansion they can do."
Target is hitting its all time high today. What's next in store for this retailer after earning report comes out?
I wait and wait.. and he finally comes back with something about SQ. Without fail. Just incredible.
"Market setting new highs, WMT soaring, Target is sinking. I guess demonstrating contempt for the rights, beliefs and privacy of millions of women and girls wasn't such a great idea after all, eh fascist pervert cult members?"
stock should trade mid 80s
"This Sean guy is hilarious. Doesn't have any TGT stock, but spends his entire day on this forum spewing his misinformation. Hey Sean, can you please tell me how Target's policies hurt women and children? Your non stop claims cannot be backed up with a single ounce of truth. Who are these mentally ill men you speak of?"
long n strong st $62
"This is insane, my trust on markets is fading away after see such a dumb selloff .... K I see spending but isn't that suppose to be a good thing for business, what part people aren't understanding if this is legit profit taking"
Any reason what so ever i should not dump this turd now and get my money into facebook.. This is a POS at this point.. amazon will crush them.
"If they over-turn the election and give it to Donald, they better board up the Target stores - and protect our profits."
"We as a family have decided to send a message to the Minnesota Voters that what their House Rep is spending the hate for the Jewish people and that Nancy and the DEM party has not done anything about it that we need to try and send a message to the Minnesota voters that we do not think what is happing is right and it's in their hands to do something about it. We have been long term supporters of Minnesota based Companies like Target and GIS. We have purchased products for my whole lifetime from GIS and been shareholders for ever. GIS was a key holding and we have now sold every share we have, We have also stopped buying GIS products. My Family has worked at Target and purchased from Target over Walmart , but from now until something is done about OMAR and her hate for the Jewish people we will not be buying anything from Target.It is totally up to you and what you think, but we felt that we needed to try and do something and let Minnesota Voters that it is not right to spread the hate for the Jewish people that Omar is spreading."
"tgt is a great company. everytime i go there its busy, friendly atmosphere, shopping carts that arent defective , my fellow americans we are going into the holidays NOW is the time to own tgt. consider this entry point a gift. I can see 90-95 by new years. side note- little over 3% dividend is rock solid"
"Target Corp continues to be an underpermormer. At a time when the market has soared over 30 percent due to the advent of a President who is not, unlike his predecessor, an America-hating socialist, Target Corp has floundered with a 15 percent loss. Of course, showing contempt for the rights, beliefs, and safety of their customers has not helped, with a multi-million former customer boycott still in effect, sales and profits continue to languish. Stay away from TGT until the management team is fired and the board reshuffled."
"Am I the only one who's simultaneously disturbed and amused by the fact that Sarah hides his/er RWNJ fear-mongering behind a veil of ""concern for women's rights"", but at the same time vehemently defends a ""President"" who was caught on tape bragging about sexually assaulting women?"
"I will NOT shop Target until...1) They publicly state they made a mistake 2) CEO apologizes for offending our daughters and resigns 3) Restore the Bathroom Policy where men go to the men's room and women go to the women's room. None of this...""I think I am a woman..."" kind of stuff. I haven't shopped Target in 15 months."
"Wow, this thing is down to where it was six or seven years ago. Case and point of why a ceo is stupid beyond belief to play politics with the holdings, in this case Target stores, of the shareholders and employees. Target CEO should be fired immediately without prejudice and stripped of all compensation. Target CEO should be forced to make restitution to all shareholders and affected employees until all his ill gotten wealth is depleted. Never, never, never make politics with something that is NOT YOURS! Say what you want to say, but be sure it is about you and not about the company you work for."

"Backed up the truck yesterday and loaded the bed with more TGT shares. Lack of guidance was the only reason the stock sold off. EBIT came in better than expected, comps were better than expected, 118 percent digital sales growth, same day sales up 212 percent. Lack of guidance has been the reason so many good quarters have been punished over COVID and it is a no brainer to buy the dip. TGT, WMT, and COST are not traditional department stores. They will continue to do well despite e commerce. I am bullish on all three and have bought the quarterly dips. Right now all three companies are at bargain prices. Buy here and you'll thank me later."
"I personally have not shopped at Target since last April. Why would I shop at a store that demonstrates contempt for common sense, the views of half its customers, and the privacy rights and personal safety of women and young girls?There are plenty of alternatives to Target. I forgot them like a bad girlfriend."
TARGET gets CLOBBERED pre-market. Evangelicals like me are AVOIDING this BOGUS company and our strength is creating huge vacuum for this BOGUS company. Sorry for the workers. Probably best to look for another retail job. Shareholders to experience a lot more PAIN....

Besides, any man who claims to be a woman actually is one, and should immediately be granted access to any and all ladies rooms.""I know, I threw in a little begging-the-question there, but NUT JOB always does too."
"""Depends"" is right and I agree. I can knock down just about any stock and feel like I won a debate here but that has nothing to do with real life investments. W is up 40% in last one week, AMZN has remained flat during this time. Is W a better investment then? Both W and AMZN are up about 150% in last 2 years so I can put my money in either W or AMZN and it makes no difference? That's not how it works."

sell right into it
The boycott has failed. Target sales are booming. I am now calling for the boycotters to gather up their belongings and go home. My suggestion to everyone is to get on board this Gravy Train!
how much more will this drop guys? i want to buy more.
Keep buying the peak! Sellers love you!
"Target is a morbund company in a dying sector. Inviting perverts into its ladies' rooms is just a symptom of a sick, politically motivated management making poor decisions. Another symptom is a floundering stock price, being left in the dust by its two main competitors, Walmart and Amazon."

"A clean rest-room is a sign of a healthy company. Target has the 2nd cleanest rest-rooms in the country next to McDonald's. The best way to invest is to go to the bathroom many times at a place.

Ghani jumping ship to join the competition. The bathroom nightmare continues. The only thing target will listen to is loss of revenue and talent. They have both.

"Interesting how Target doesn't inform its customers by signage that its policy is to let men who ""identify as women"" into the bathrooms and ladies fitting rooms with their young girls. Why do you think Target refuses to do this? One thing I agree with deceptive on is that leftism is the father of all lies, in this case, a lie of omission."

"Over two dozen sex offenders, all men, arrested at Target stores in the last year, since Target inexplicably announced that men would henceforth be allowed into all Target ladies bathrooms and fitting rooms, no questions asked. Many of these men had been getting away with filming for months, with several having uploaded these videos to porn sites. None have been caught in Walmart bathrooms, except in California, where by some inexplicable state law Walmart is forced to allow men into ladies rooms as well. How long will this continue? With liberal Democrats being exposed every day for their crimes against women, how long will this abusive, bigoted pattern towards womens' rights continue?"

Have you ever noticed how liberals only seem to worry about the size of the deficit when someone like Trump starts talking about cutting taxes? It's almost as if this supposed concern about the national debt is all just another liberal lie! Do these people ever stop lying? Experience says no.
"The price has flattened out so you can stop flipping out. “Target said Wednesday that, despite its toy sales remaining about flat, it still grew market share in toys during the 2019.” Also, electronics were down because they wanted to maintain profit margin.

The calls also shot up dramatically. The Najarian brothers called it last Friday. Advice. Never buy it on the day that the Najarian Brothers call it. Wait one or two days for a slight drop. Last Friday the July 19th $90 closed at $1.23 , its right now around $0.80, the low for today was $0.74. So it is worth it to be a bit patience. Learned my lesson from his calls earlier this year.I usually wait a day or two to buy both the stock and options. I think the stock may settle at $86 before the push to $90 in the next few weeks."

The trouble with that is, the rents will be sky high and how is a discount retailer going to make it in those spaces with high overhead? His strategy seems to be a showroom type experience for walk-in customers combined with making these stores shipping centers for the online business. It might work but TGT will be competing even more head to head with Amazon, and that ain't gonna work. TGT is dead man walking."
"Amazon, Walmart, Costco: GreenTarget: RedWhat the F?"
Weird drop today. Only negative news I can find is no progress on trade war. Is this the shakeout before + ER to get rid of weak hands?
"The CEO should write a book and call it "" How to destroy a good company in one short year""."
"Everyone should view this that explains the market meltup from about two weeks ago. I tried posting the link to make it easier but yahoo removed the post. It’s a great listen and educational piece that Wall street doesn’t want the retail investor to know about. Do a google search on “the countdown to recession has begun, but one strategist says markets will rally first” and listen to it. You’ll need to be cautious (Longs should take advantage of the market meltup but be prepared to exit once the violent downturn begins)."
"I've got to admit, I was never a big Trump fan. In fact after he gained the nomination I swore that I would never vote for him. But what choice did I have? The alternative was a flat out criminal! But he has surprised me, totally. I think he may accomplish more than Reagan, at least economically. No one can beat winning the cold war."
DOWN TGT WILL BLOW
"cheap, too much inventory, a bit low dividend"
"TGT beats top and bottom, CEO very optimistic going forward and the stock is down 10% a real joke"
I think it's time for shareholders to demand Cornell to step down.How can one man's refusal to do what's best for the investors go on?It's time for Target to reverse their bathroom policy.
"How many doctors in this day and age can say that they provide plain and simple diagnosis in an internet message board for no cosr? I don't know about you guys but I sure feel very fortunate to have Dr R L PantCrapper available 24/7 right here. Board certified. I know that because ""DSM-5"". Only a board certified doc knows DSM-5."
"Obviously Target has no need for those millions of customers who are boycotting, huh?"
"The pvssygrabber kicks the can down the road for 90 days and the crowd goes wild. Good job, Sarah!"
The boycott is affecting Target in after market. The bleeding continues.
"Oh, and Dave, not only are you a liar and a dangerous fanatic, you are also a coward. You refuse to admit that the beliefs of others mean nothing to you and that you would force women and girls to share ladies' rooms with any man who demands it. That's why you don't answer, you are a gutless coward, and like a cowards, a bully as well."
good luck longs!
"Cheap wine, contempt for customers' rights, radical gay agenda - Target's got it all!"
"It takes years to bleed out a good company, and no stock goes straight up or straight down. Target's trend is clear though, and after a number of terrible sales quarters this year they should be in the 30's by the end of the summer."
"Went into a Target today. Long story! Suffice it to say I wouldn't have gone without a good reason. Boy, the place was a mess! And not very crowded, either! Plenty of parking spaces at what one would think would be a very busy time of year. If you're holding this stock hoping for good holiday numbers, based on what I saw you are in big trouble."
Target is King. It's Top Dog in Retail. Burger King is King in the restaurant sector.
"better lock in those gains, forward guidance is not very rosy without additional stimulus before holiday season"
TGT stock is down about 25 percent in a week. Walmart down less than 10 percent. Guess the boycott is working.
for all the people pushing TGT as a 'buying opportunity' ---BANK OF AMERICA: The 'big low' in stocks is still several months away
Someone unloaded 430k shares @ 6:30 unfortunately I cannot upload my screenshot
Didn't target already say the holiday season was the best in years for them?
"tgt and wmt earnings have peaked,it's p/e too high,plus Amazon too strong,so they will down at least 30%this year,"
WOW..Shorts are completely crushed!
"The final call on CNBC a couple of days ago had 4 of the 5 people give a thumbs down on target. The 1 guy that gave a buy signal said ""just because"". Reasons to not watch CNBC"
the drop below $50 comes Wednesday! They politically destroyed themselves upsetting 50% of the American people.
I can’t believe these big investors of tgt. Tgt gained over 17% during November and December but greedy top investors wanted 20%! Any great gain is a plus but to ask for even more is just plain greedy. So stock goes down. When do these investors become satisfied?
when I go to target. all the workers are nice and friendly to help you that is A+.
"Regressive, regarding citation, you can google the quote I provided in a previous comment. I'm sure you'll find several news articles and even the video of Trump saying those words."
"Hey Maria, how bout them cowboys? Why did you leave Walmart?"
subtract out the dividend (nice one)72.4 or so73.5 is supportthey took it up for the dividend and got itnow will they sell it off?or wait until after earningsmaybe they don't like the risk?
"I went out on a limb and said $120 $125 earnings, see my previous post. Congrats to all the longs, I listened to my own advice and went all in and all in on margin, laughing all the way to the bank"
Told all of you that retail went dead after Christmas. As I went by my local Target this afternoon. Employee vehicles out numbered the customers 3 to 1.
Gonna be a good week!

"Look like Target is doing well. They have been wise to lie to their customers about their policy of letting men into their ladies rooms. Ignorance benefits Target, as it does most left wing movements."
I think we can all agree that Target is a terrific company.
"Gap to fill back to $206, I’ll wait"
"Still no answer to the question of why women and young girls should be forced to share ladies rooms with any random man who demands it. The silence of the ""transgender rights"" nuts speaks volumes to their contemptuous, hateful bigotry towards the rights of others. Lots of ranting and raving from the transgender cult, lots of fake arguments, lots of lies, lots of rhetorical fallacies, but no actual honest answer to the question. This is the result of poor education that fails to imbue critical thinking skills."
Brian Cornell is the worst CEO in America. What is the board thinking? Get rid of him now
"TGT stock is now green for the day. Thanks to ""Obvious""/""sarha""/""sean""/""LocalDumDum"". I am not invested in TGT right now but it is really fun to watch how these trolls try their best to hurt TGT but end up helping it instead. GOOD JOB!"
Too badGoing the way of sears
I Love America. I Love Trump. I Love Target Corp. I hate the anti-American Soccer Gal. Call me Crazy.

Go Target go. I got a lot of great deals there over Memorial Day weekend. :)
that bathroom really did a number 2 here maybe number 3...
How can Target's stock not be at $300+? Everyone I know spends most of their paychecks there?
Our little boycott of all Minnesota based companies seams to be getting some traction. Just look at Kellogg's earnings WOW looks like a lot of us that are now boycotting GIS are buying Kellogg products as the replacement. It will take longer to show how the boycott is effecting Target and Best Buy because you do not buy things from them every month like you do GIS . but WOW did it show in Kellogg's earnings and fast.
SHORTSALE THIS TO THE BOTTOM.
Ok we made good $ today. The common underlying theme here is dept stores are losing $ and the discount retailers are raking it in. So we have Rost coming up tomorrow and Burl on the 26th. Dec 5 DG and Cost Dec. 12 Cost. Good luck to all the longs.

Going to be a little tough to run a corporate headquarters in a city without a police force. SJW's and militant leftists roaming the streets trying to keep the peace. Black Panthers in charge of maintaining order. Of course TGT supports that viewpoint so they'll get what they're asking for.Good luck with that.

YTD: Dow up 24 % WMT up 14.4 % TGT down 18.9 %%How's that bathroom policy working out for ya?
"This is down for no reason. I already told you, go ask people on the street about the bathrooms. They will look at you crazy, they don't even know about it. You are obsessing over something that makes no difference."
I'm in Target - not for the money - although there is plenty. I'm a fan of Blue Chip Retail and also I respect that Target has the 2nd cleanest rest-rooms in the country - 2nd only to McDonald's.
"Sarah really seems to be having a jelly meltdown today. Despite his/er claim, I do not _always_ claim to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. With TGT and KSS over the past 18 months I've bought _close_ to the bottom and sold _close_ to the top. I hope to do the same with WBA over the next 6-12 months (I usually try to hold at least a year so that I'm taxed at the long-term-gain rate). Have I had some spectacular losses? Sure. On paper, right now, I'm down about $13k on SWKS. I also seem to have missed the mark on JBLU. I continue to hold these companies because I believe they're undervalued and their business model will eventually result in better than average gains. All-in-all, I have a CAGR of about 17% since 2007, which may not be ""alpha"", but it's pretty good. Part of the reason that I do better than average is because I don't get distracted by non-stories like the so-called ""boycott""."
Who goes to KSS when there is TGT!!!!
"Meanwhile, Ark is going to report me to the FBI for expressing concern for the safety, privacy, and beliefs of millions of women and girls in Target ladies' rooms, after literally hundreds have been assaulted, and dozens of perverts like Ark have been arrested in target stores! Good luck with that one Skippy! LOL"
Great buy. This will be back to $75 by this time next week.
"Overreaction but shorts see this as an opportunity to do what they do best...short the stock. They will have to cover at some point. For those who shorted at $125, congratulations. Now cover and take your profit. Sales did not decline over 7% and neither will profits."

"Target boycott by 1.5 million former customers still going strong. Donald Trump still winning, liberals still losing. Target still down about 15 percent from its high of two years ago, while the overall market is up over 33 percent. Hope you TGT longs like losing money, you've had plenty of it and you will get more of it."
There is no news as to why this stock is down so much. I believe the big boys are keeping the price low to get stock from the weak hands. Don't sell at these bargain basement prices.
Looks like the boycott continues to drag Target’s sales down. $62 is next level of support. Sell now or lose more money. We never thought the boycott would be this effective.

"Still no expressed concern from Target Corporation regarding the dozens of predators that have been arrested in their stores since corporate policy was to welcome men into their ladies' rooms. I guess ideology and politics matters more to them than womens' rights to safety, privacy, and to their own views. Target management doesn't even seem to care about a multi-million person boycott, and a stock that is languishing, down 25 percent this year, while its competitors hit new highs daily. I guess this is what insanity looks like when it takes over the management of a formerly good company."

"Yay Walmart is going up today!!! Glad I sold my Target shares and bought Apple and Walmart, more growth potential!"
TGT is down -4.92% to 71.44
"This shows you how dumb this market is. Does anybody think Amazon getting it to me in one day as opposed two is going to make me not go to Target. The people that weren't going to go to Target because of Amazon were already accounted for. Seems like a good day for somebody to buy. Besides, have you ever seen an Amazon restroom? That's what I thought :)"
Slow day for Local Loser...only one stupid post...
Target got themselves involved in pushing a political ideology/philosophy that progressive liberals push as some kind of moral high ground. Generally speaking people dont want the places they shop telling them how they should define truth and reality. The American Academy of Pediatrics sums it up nicely in their journal article.... https://www.acpeds.org/the-college-speaks/position-statements/gender-ideology-harms-children
I’m a big believer in TGT management. This is most definitely a make or break quarter though. If they top earnings this could go up to $130. If they miss it could drop to $104. Be prudent and put your stops in accordingly.
"Read my previous posts, I said close to $100, just sold all my position over $100 pre-market and to Trey who said my prediction was utterly ridiculous, whose the man now?"

TGT reached a new 52 Week High at 82.77

The whole market is in a slump due to global uncertainties. We just gotta ride out this small wave. Target is perfectly fine & will release holiday numbers very soon! Im not worried at all for i believe those numbers are going to SMASH WS EXPECTATIONS!
Price down today on ridiculously low volume. Short sellers doing their nefarious work to make money from covid19 panic at the expense of good companies and real investors. There is some talk now about banning short selling during this period of stress in our financial system. Yes!
I'm surprised that TGT still show a nice gain YTD. Maybe I misjudged TGT.
Breakout
WMT to $100 now pre-market . Is TGT next to tech those levels?
Today's drop is not all Macy's related. It is a sign of really bad news coming for earnings. This is what happens when you alienate so many customers because you want to make mentally ill men feel normal by allowing them in to the little girls room. Disgusting management team.

"And I almost forgot.

"From earnings this morning, the future looks good. The holiday guidance has caused a sell off, which will likely come back up a bit by the end of the day. The future of this brand is still very positive. The house brands they are launching have been successful, and will continue to grow. Closing a few larger stores that are less profitable and opening many many more small format stores which are more profitable is a positive for this company. Great buying opportunity this morning."

I'd love to have a civil debate with someone who's shorting TGT. You don't have to disclose your cost basis but you have to admit that you're currently holding a short position. Your gain/loss is not my concern.. just that you're shorting TGT as of today with 70.50 closing price. Anyone?
There goes your 4% dividend in ONE day
If I were Target I would spend the buyback money trying to win back the +1Million customers it disenfranchised. Otherwise they will own an increasing share of a decreasing asset. In an increasingly competitive big box retail environment they cannot afford to lose this many customers. I suspect the share buy back is meant to cover up the losses.
"It's just like watching a car accident in slow motion! Meanwhile I continue my Sunday morning ritual. Open the front door and grab the Sunday paper, then find the Target flyer and throw it in the trash. It's a great way to start the day!"

I wonder how many women and girls have to be assaulted in Target ladies' rooms before Target management and its supporters admit that letting men into ladies' rooms is a bad idea.
"Wow, Target just keeps plunging. Down 10.3 percent now. Kohls is down about 8 percent. Both of them have a hard race to run against Amazon, but unlike Target, Kohl's didn't shoot itself in the foot first by mixing politics with its business. I think there's a lesson there somewhere."

"look only Walmart and target are going to be the only places to shop after this.. get ready to drink your coffee at Starbucks, eat at olive garden and shop at a big box store... capitalism is in full swing."
Boycott Amazon
The boycott is working! Anybody that thinks a man should be able to use a woman's public bathroom is a sicko. Keep it up folks! Sooner or later top management will get fired.
Gotta put target in my watchlist.
WARNING Brutal stock promotion ongoing to attract NEW BAGHOLDERS so the criminal Financial mafia and management can unload their brutally overpriced trash to them ....
how LOW can it GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
"Target looks like it is headed back to the 50's. I love social justice, don't you? Don't spend that dividend all in one place."
"TGT broke light support at 68, next support is 62.If 62 support breaks, then 59 is stronger support."
"In the last year, there have been literally dozens of arrests of men in Target ladies' rooms, men invited into those rooms by Target management. Almost none in Walmarts during the same period, one of which was in California, where state law requires the same policy. Literally hundreds of women violated during that period, and no one in or out of Target cares about the rights, beliefs, or safety of the women in these stores, many of whom are unaware of the open ladies room policy because Target refuses to post their policy publicly. This is called bigotry folks. And the stock price is plunging - deservedly so."
LOL no that's not the entire comment and I'm surprised you haven't found a real investment loss in my comment history. Am I really that good that this is all you have? Maybe I am
Looks like this stock is a dead money investment and not going anywhere until after earnings...will either pop or drop! Likely rangebound between $80-$89 until earnings release.
Managed to get $2.10 a share today.
Down again today on low volume. This is obviously a stock traders and short-sellers love to manipulate. Earnings in three weeks should give it another leg up. But in the meantime we have to live with these gyrations.
"Wow... looks like gonna be big up day in the market. Even M is up, lol.TGT, seems to be suffering from LWNJ-itus."
"Up big for no reason, will be lobster red."
"Does AMAZON make its $80 offer for TGT over the weekend? ... They saved a few BILLION by waiting for its earnings to come out, but can't wait too long as sales are rising at TGT FASTER than expected."
going to be 75 by next week
"I’m buying here at $117.75. Of course it could go lower still, but upside potential at this level far exceeds downside risk."
Brutal
"target hopes my children will shop there, hahaha, my daughter with 2 kids only ever asks me for Walmart gift cards.....its real simple, Walmart has lower prices on the same stuff.... Its spending Billions on remodeling going to help TGT compete on price?"
"I think the biggest problem TGT faces as a corporation is employee efficiency. Same goes for WMT. That's one reason why COST is the leader. Target needs fewer checkouts, more automation and less turnover among employees. Hopefully some of these changes will happen in the near future. The advantage TGT has over WMT and COST is that Target stores are much pleasant.. especially the remodeled ones. That's why I see TGT's SS sales increasing over time."

"And the ""experts"" said WMT was over valued!!! TGT is waaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy over valued, more so than WMT"
tgt pe is still very low ....wait for indicators to give u signal to sell ..... like sma macd rsi pmc
They really need to report holiday sales numbers which are going to be awesome. A maintain on guidance or raise would be icing on the cake
"At this rate, Target's dividend will soon be 8%. Lots of more pain coming."
I'm a buyer at $40
"Walmart already had a high capacity infrastructure and streamlined e-commerce and delivery system. TGT is building, configuring and experiencing costly hiccups with their ecomm. TGT also went on a hiring spree and wage raise last qtr and they operate in more expensive high pop locations. These locations are seeing an exodus to suburbs where Walmart rule."
"Why Liar Bigot Dave, Bigot Kevin, and Special Libt4rd Agent Ark are all bigots: because they have utterly no regard for the rights and safety of children such as these:“I have shared my personal experience of having taken my elementary school age daughters into a women’s restroom when shortly after three transgender young adults, over six feet [tall] with deep voices, entered,” she wrote.“My children were visibly frightened, concerned about their safety and left asking lots of questions for which I, like many parents, was ill-prepared to answer,” she continued.In a statement, she said that the ACLU has become “a special interest organization that promotes not all, but certain progressive rights.”"

Time to buy some more Target. Shares are way oversold... like the rest of the market is
Why are you all so obsessed about schmale's and trangenders? Can we get back to business already? People do not give a @#$ that shop there.
Target is headed to a $200 Billion market cap. With massive grocery expansion. Wait till their prime competitor service hits with unmatched curbside pickup. It will be 1/8 the size of AMAZON then but will have a share price of about $430

@Steven... Congratulations on picking winners this year! Yahoo Finance Company of the Decade - Disney and Yahoo Finance Company of the Year - Target!
"Sarah, I don't get brainwashed easily like you do. I have a mind of my own and don't vote just because someone has R of D next to their name. That is the definition of a sheep. I like to think for myself and come to my own conclusion on who I would vote for. I would never vote for Hillary, but she would have made a better president than Trump. That I am certain of. I actually followed the stories of the alleged looting and stealing and lying. And if a dozen investigations lead by GOP committees cant prove her of wrong doing, I am not going to. Instead, i looked at actual policy and decided she wasn't for me.By the way, do you still think Obama is a muslim and was born in Kenya? Im sure you are convinced that is true."
I believe will still going up to$200
"I started reading and posting comments here in June - right as I went short on TGT. However, bathroom trolling by sarha (previously ""Sean""), Deceptive Democrats, little 'm'. etc ... really made me wonder if I was being a total nutcase by shorting TGT. A few days later I closed my short position and went long after waiting for a dip (TGT was close to $50 back then). True story."
"So, according to NUT JOB, bringing young girls into the mens rooms at Target (and presumably, showers and locker rooms since we all know NUT JOB is in favor of open door policies there, as well) is okey dokey because after all, only perverts look at other peoples genitalia. More evidence of the kookery and mental illness that is NUT JOB."
Closing 200 stores. The stock will pop 20% minimum.
"You usually see prices creep up before a good Q report. But, even if retail or TGT has a bad Q, the shares could drop 10% and still be above my last buy points(avg.$67.50). Plus I caught the div and they increased it. It's called buy low, reap the dividends folks. Very simple, no tea leaf reading needed. Read and heed, and thank me later...."
CNBC bump.
They better stay out of the athletic wear space. They do fine partnering with clothing brands like they did with vineyard vines.
Maybe Target can get a NEW 52 WEEK HIGH TODAY?
"Target continues to be plagued by poor sales numbers, a massive consumer boycott, and an outmoded business model. I plan to shop at Target again during the bankruptcy sale, but certainly not before."
Coming into the 5th wave tomorrow. YUGE day.
"TGT needs to take a page out of Kroger's play book and label new reduced prices where applicable. Just be what you are, instead of spending a lot of money re-inventing yourself. Are WMT stores fancy and squeaky clean? NOT! But they consistently win on price point. TGT's mgmt. seems to feel the need to blast off into something new, instead of fine-tuning what they really are."

"TGT up at the Open, Shorts get ready to post more endless ""DRIVEL"". That means you Demented Idiot."
"Is it just me, or is the intensity of Sarah's rants on a given day directly proportional to the increase in TGT's share price?"
This stock has taken a solid beating.
"Doomed. Never shorted a stock before, but if ever there was a ""sure thing"" (but of course there never is) this has got to be it. TGT was headed downhill and out of business when they became political. CEO should be fired immediately with zero package. But now that WMT and AMZN have their eyes on taking all the business away from the company... it's over IMHO. TGT may get bought out, but I would suspect it will be in the teens when that occurs. Big mistake going political, bigger than WMT and/or AMZN going after them. Big Mistake."

Let’s hope to finish at 108$ need some positive news fro media or big companies beating earnings and get this market bullish again
People who are still talking about the bathroom policy should really need to move on. Do you go to Target to shop or go to the bathroom?
"With the stock being up pretty good the last few days, bound for a small pull back today. I am guessing the AFA nutjobs will be out in full force. They only seem to come out when there is a hint of red."
I haven't entered a Target store (one is just a mile from me) because of the PC stances. I patronize retailers that don't insult me.
That premarket is just as red as the REDcard. :-)

Hopefully TGT will be in the 40's by Christmas!
Barky Obozo paid $150 billion to Iran to get 3 hostages back. Trump got 3 back from the socialist dictator for nothing. Trump will grind the socialist dictator to bits using hard nosed sanctions. Liberals will cry more.
I made a purchase this morning of half the shares I want.
tgt will reach around 106 ....19th dividend will b paid out ..so it will drop 0.61 usd after dividend ....and next day earnings ..so 106 price is a good deal to enter

Strap in ladies and gentlemen! Get ready for steady ride north of $170/share on earning report day!!!
and why exactly is wmt is up??? Target is the go to place. Better stores better services and they care about their employees and environment much more than wmt ever does. Target will be a better investment than wmt for sure.

"Best short I've had in a while. Thanks, everybody.See you again if it bounces and if some more chumps get sucked into this thing and we'll do it again."
this thing is hanging up on thin air-- the plunge will be spectacular
"Keith, the drop was due to Amazon reporting that they are coming out with another grocery chain that will not emulate Whole Foods, so more than likely considered direct competition for Wal-mart and Target Food centers. Of course it is merely another attempt of Amazon doubling down on a category that they will fail in miserably."
"Like TGT for the growth, also DG who I believe will be a true wealth builder — selling for a multiple <19 is a steal"

"Well im down a Bmw or Porsche after one day, so much for a merry Christmas. Hope this recovers some before the new year."
NEW LOWS for the TRANSGENDER stock!
TGT stock is now controlled by the wall street mafia. they will rake all the profit from option writing before this can move up. I like it when robinhood mob takes over wall street even with the weirdest of valuation.
"I think that RWNJ ""news"" report about the market volatility being due to ""overseas issues"" was right. Maybe the pvssygrabber should just stay ""overseas"" and keep his mouth shut. Things seem to go better that way."

If it hits 124 again it’s gona start to run
Way OVERSOLD....buying on this dip. TGT will be at $95 by Christmas:)
"Stopped in today at Target! Saved $0.87 on a small bottle of A-1 steak sauce. My 12 year old daughter got to watch a 45 year old ""transgender woman"" masturbate in front of her in the ""ladies' room"". When she complained, she was called a bigot and was lectured on ""inclusivity"" by Target staff. Great experience!"
Can anyone explain why Target's beta is relatively high compared to competitors? Is this because of its recent expansion/remodeling/innovation project?
"Why does the fascist pervert cult running Target and on this board want to force women and young girls to share ladies' rooms with men, including sex offenders? Do they hate womens' rights that much?"
stock will be in the 30's by may.
People just forget 1 thing: all that was fueled by that extra $600 a week but now..
Target is my favorite store

"A lot of BDS (""boycott"" derangement syndrome) making the rounds here lately!"
"Increasingly, many companies like Target are falling into the political realm. Most are supporting the Progressives who are bent on installing Socialism/Communism. Not only that, they are helping to marginalize anyone who disagrees. We have seen throughout history that Socialism bankrupts the Middle Class and eliminates great companies like Target. For our CEO to participate in helping these things to occur, it doesn't say much for the safety of our investment in this company. Questions: Who is going to purchase from Target when once the predicted economic depression gets here? We saw the shutting down of commerce and middle class jobs during covid and based on history, Socialist are about control and never the economy. If you believe the Covid caused the disappearance of the Flu, you need to keep your investment with Target. If you know the numbers were skewed and hyped by Socialist leaning officials, you need to prepare to lose your investment. Look at Venezuela to learn what happens to businesses."
"I dont get it. Revenue is increasing, isnt that a great sign for a retailer in the age of Amazon? IMO many retailers mostly WMT and TGT are upping their game considerably against Amzn in multiple respects and things may not be rosy for Amzn in near future. Actually Amzn should crash after this earnings report from TGT!!"
Guys i hear Target make the high bid offer JCPNQ
open@141
I'll bet Goldman set this up.And you know it too.
Looks like the pv55ygrabber-trade is showing itself to be the irrational bubble that we always kind-of knew that it was. Hope that continues until November.
"I am still sticking to my prediction last month of TGT to $120 by earnings. This is a buying opportunity sub 110. Once WMT reports earnings on Thursday, you will have to pay a lot more for a share of TGT"
"Actually there are 1.5 million people who have signed the boycott petition, and that represents far more people, since young children do not boycott, only parents. I estimate that's about 6 million former customers for Target who will not be back, and those figures actually are reflected in the weak sales figures that have driven Target stock lower. There would be far more people boycottign if Target wasn't lying about their policies, as well. You would know that if you werent' so brainwashed into letting your beliefs guide your reason, instead of the other way around. but that's what cults are for, I guess."

"Looking good early pre market, for what that's worth. Let's hope for a green close."
"Nice it's going Green , can't believe anyone who doesn't like Traget, we enjoying shopping there every time with my family."
"I have heard all kinds of reasons for the drop in Target stock and its loss of foot traffic. The ones that come to mind are global warming, the failure of its grocery sector, a slump in Apple sales, competition from Amazon, the sale of its pharmacy sector and so on. But the one thing that happened almost to the day the stock price slide started was the call for a boycott over the bathroom policy."
"Entered into Bearish Trend officially today, look for more downtrend, Institutional selling it... it will come back but organically not rapidly as it did in last two quarters."
As a shareholder and shopper in TGT I would like to see the company use the advanced smart security devices from a company called Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions (AiTX) deployed in it’s stores. Improved security and convenience for both customers and employees as well as cost savings further company.
Nice movement to end the week

Same store sales are going up this qtr!!!
guess a lot of bashers where wrong
When can we expect a pullback or profit taking so I can jump in..?
Consolidation happening between $104.75-$105.25. A very good sign for the Bulls in preparation for its next leg higher!
"Buckingham research: ""We are taking a much more conservative view on future results and now believe it’s reasonable to start with the assumption that TGT may never generate a positive annual comp again, or at least not before the e-commerce channel matures."
"I wonder if Sarah is getting ""excited"" about all of that phallic shaped military equipment that the pv55y grabber wants to parade down the street? At least it might take his/er mind off of the bathroom for a little while!"
"TGT- we all saw what happened to Walmart, stimulus money is not coming in big to pump any more consumers to spend. Jobs are not good"
Alot of my friends who shop Target won't even think about visiting Walmart.
wooow 126 .........
Buying opportunity. Won’t be in the 170s for more than a day
Dr PantCrapper! You know I will be happy to share my last SQ trade with you. Wait right here doc.

"If you read a lot of news about Target in the mainstream news media, you will notice that although a few mention Target's declining sales, none of them ever talk about the boycott that is largely responsible for that decline. Plus, many stories today about Target's renovation projects, but none about the stock plunge. The news media is in full cahoots with the radical left agenda being pushed by the transgender activists, providing fake news left and right."
"TGT- already peaked, millions will never get their jobs back"
How it fooled me yesterday falling under $88 with 5 minutes left. Of course rebounded 2 minutes later after I sold 2/3 of my holdings. Which was the right move - to sell or to keep I'll see shortly. Either way made money and hedged my bet.
"GOOD DEAL OR NOT, 373 GRAMS CUBAN LINK NECKLACE 14K FOR $19,000."
"You know I don't think a multi million person boycott of Target could ever affect its stock price. Those millions of signatures? All fake. Just like those videos on youtube showing that Target lets men into their ladies rooms, no quesitons asked. All fake, every single one. Why? Because I say so, that's why. And nothing exists in this world unless I w ant to believe it."
"LULU reported good numbers today & upped their forecast. Might have something to do with the stock being a little stale today. Know what you own, LULU wont be the only company upping guidance! Me personally, I am very confident in Cornell!"
"they missed estimated eps due to investments in supply chain, so the market punished them by dropping 10%. that's stupid."
"Wow, Target is SOARING!!!!! Up almost 30 cents! The sky's the limit!"
Happy to see this turn bullish.
"Hey Maria, how is that WMT stock coming along?I'm loving TWTR now."
"to quote Ric Flair ""you don't bet against a winner"""
SIMPLE REASON WHY TGT WILL BE 150 post earnings: the App Store has 2 Million ratings for the Target app. Not downloads. Ratings! As in someone invested at least a couple seconds to rate it. WMT has 799K. Expect BLOWOUT numbers
I guess target has hit a resistance point and decided to drop on this lovely bull day. Still have good expectation going forward

Stopped by Target today. Saved $0.14 on a large bottle of A-1 steak sauce. My wife and daughter got a free sexual assault from one of the sex offenders invited into Target ladies' rooms by Target management. Really memorable shopping trip!

We were long time shareholder of GIS stock and loved the company and used GIS products my whole life GIS was a key holding. , We feel so strongly that something needs to be done about OMAR and no one was doing anything . We just felt sitting and doing nothing was no longer an option . So about a month ago we sold all are GIS stock and started boycotting all GIS products. We also started boycotting all Minnesota based companies like Target and Best Buy . Today we got the news that we are now not the only family that believe so strongly and the boycott is catching on . All you have to do is look at GIS stock today and you can see the power of how you spend you money can make great changes. Target we will see if the boycott is working very soon on you. Up to the voters in Minnesota to do something with OMAR but the boycotts will not stop until something is done"

Why bring it up Atheist, in a stock blog above all things?You must believe in my God, since you keep bringing up the subject. Just like when the Rich man died and Lazarus died. The rich man went to hell, Lazarus went to Abraham's bosom. The rich man said it was hot in hell and asked Lazarus to dip his finger in water and touch his tongue to COOL it.c when that time comes, I won't be able to do that for you....no one can cross that divide. :-(Since you know so much about my God, you know that I can't bet.

"Here's your weekly arrest report at Target. Funny how this doesn't happen nearly as much at Walmart, which has nearly 3 times as many stores as Target.

Hmmm...https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-hillsborough/tampa-man-accused-of-secretly-recording-woman-changing-clothes-in-target-dressing-room"
CEO focused too much on the margins and should have focused more on the comparable stores number. Buy the dip. I feel like this ceo is a greenhorn
Why doesn't Target management warn its female customers that any and all men are allowed into their ladies rooms?
"Where do we go from here? TGT reported very good earnings and gave good forward guidance. All earnings metrics appeared good save margins. It seems appropriate that margin erosion would happen with the increase in digital sales. Competing with AMZ is a battle. It seems that TGT has figured out how. With 17 holds on the stock, there's certainly room for some analyst upgrades. Typically, upgrades beget more buying. A couple of charting sites give good reports on TGT:https://stockcharts.com/h-sc/ui https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/TGThttps://www.americanbulls.com/SignalPage.aspx?lang=en&Ticker=TGTAs we wait, TGT's 3.52% dividend coupled with a low 10 year, gives us all a cushion. Obviously, anything can and will happen in the investing world. I'm comfortable being long TGT going forward...Jeff"

it's going up for a good reason will continue to go up also.

I'm another testament to the damage Brian Cornell has done to target. Never shopped at Wal Mart because Target was a significantly better shopping environment and experience. Cornell's critical failure in judgment last year resulted in my consumer dollars moving 100% from Target's cash registers to Wal Mart's cash registers. It's not shopper's behaviors changing to online shopping....it about refusing to be force fed social policy!

"I get so sick of everyone thinking this has to be an AMZN, TGT or WMT world... There's plenty of room for all 3 to thrive over the long term. While TGT and WMT are lagging AMZN online, they are obviously thrashing AMZN with physical purchases. AMZN wants in on the brick & mortar business, just like TGT and WMT are keen to join the online game. I've held shares in both AMZN and TGT for many years and have no plans to sell either. They'll both be winners long term. My prediction is AMZN will acquire TGT at some point, but that's not why I'm invested in either or both. I simply feel both have terrific management and will be premiere retailers for the foreseeable future."
"No, Sarah, it isn't ""irrational to think that men would assault women"".It _is_ irrational to think that transgender people would be more likely to assault anyone, just as it's irrational to think that immigrants would be more likely to commit violent crimes and use that as a justification to prevent immigrants and refugees from coming into our country. You're using exactly the same kind of appeal to people's irrational fears and emotions that the pvssygrabber uses to rile up peoples' worst prejudices."

Gandy Blvd.The woman told police that while she was changing she turned towards the door mirror and saw a black cell phone with a clear case pointing right at her from the bottom opening of the changing room door.She screamed and the phone was pulled away.Surveillance video from the store and information from store employees allowed Tampa Police to identify Schenck as a possible suspect.The next day he admitted he was in the store and used his phone to record the woman undressing."

Anyway, I got a first hand look at what the ""store renovations"" are: replacing cashiers with automated checkouts. The store looks exactly the same, and is mostly empty of shoppers. Wide, empty, gleaming aisles. Massive amounts of Target merchandise is flooding the liquidation markets. But they're replacing workers with machines. Makes sense. If your sales are way down, you need to cut costs. Not looking good for Target. Can't say I'm sorry to see that."

"PE of 10.5 and Yield of 4.75%! What am I missing here? This looks like an extreme value stock. They seem to be making the same moves as WMT with closing non-producing stores and moving more online. TGT seem much closer to a WMT than a Sears/KMart that I wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole. Everyone is so in love with AMZN with its PE of 185. WMT has a PE of 17 and a Yield of 2.75%. A 17 PE would put TGT at $82. A more conservative 15 PE would put TGT at $73 but that is a trailing PE. A forward PE of 15 would be $63.60, which is probably a good valuation for TGT. $50 is a forward PE of 11.8. TGT looks way oversold."

Facts are facts. Fact is 60 percent of all annual revenue at Target is from groceries. Groceries is an extremely low margin business but consistent revenue source. Target only makes about 3 pennies of profit per dollar of sales.Target is a boring low margin essentially no growth grocery business.Target fair price is $58/share. Target is a sell at over $100

This article on the Target website covers the 3rd quarter earnings, but if you scroll about halfway down you will see their plans to release holiday numbers on 1-15-20https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2019/11/target-reports-third-quarter-2019-earnings"
"Target Stores R ""Spy Stores"" ... ""Trap Stores"" ... See & Read ""Consumer Affairs"" report ... https://www.consumeraffairs.com/credit_cards/target-credit-card.html?#sort=helpful&filter=none"
"It's very unfortunate when someone thinks that the best way to describe themselves is ""A Regressive Liar who serves the society by doing a Demo of how to take a Cr4p."" I really feel bad for this person. Imagine all the horrible things the society must have said to this person for him to have such low self esteem."
Happy New Year Target stock team. Looking forward to new highs in 2020!
I’ve been saying it all week an uptick is coming we have to see it tomorrow hopefully big bounce back in market tomorrow can propel this to 124
"Gee, earnings haven't been reported yet for this LWNJ  snowflake run company. Hey, I wonder if they would consider changing dat dar BIGOTED bathroom policy that's against women and young girls. If they did, maybe their profits might go back up next quarter.? Naaaa ......LOL"
The stock has been following the same trend ever since Target's announcement to let men into the women’s restrooms. The announcement was made the stock dropped like a rock and slowly recovered some of its loss. Then a disappointing earning report is made public and the stock drops to a new low. Over the next few months the stock makes another partial recovery until there is another disappointing earnings report. Again the stock drop farther than before. Wash and repeat. What we are seeing now is the cycle of partial recovery until the next earnings report.
Before bell earnings???
"thanks to Target's ""inclusive"" ladies' rooms policies, this man is WELCOME into their ladies rooms! This is what the Democratic Party and the LGBTQ123XQZ lobby calls ""social progress""! Yay for social progress!https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/women-catch-man-snapping-pictures-of-them-in-changing-room-at-target-in-sterling-heights-police-say"
"You gotta love the stock market. By every other measure, the state of the economy is quite bad. Mortgage delinquencies are high, unemployment still high, possible undoing of corporate tax cuts (now that the Senate + VP are in the hands of Dems), COVID completely out of control, infections and deaths increasing at an alarming rate, yet markets are roaring and there is no end in sight as to how much more they'll keep going. But I guess government is there to print money. Hey everyone, the moment you get your 2k check, please go to target and buy more stuff. Again, you gotta love the market. I do feel bad for the less fortunate, but am enjoying my stock gains."
How many shares did they buybackover $125 to prop it up.Especially after rebooting Toys r Usfrom the trash heap. Also why no insider buying either?

i think we see a low between 121 to 123
Target is a Target  for Amazon buyout!
CNBC giddy indicator off the charts for target -- they are all singing praises -- sure sign it's over
"So, I was in a Target a few months ago (long story), and naturally I went to the mens' department (they still have one for some reason, although I think that may be bigotry and sexism) and ALL OF THE MENS DRESSING ROOMS WERE CLOSED. Meaning, of course, that if you were a man (i.e., person with a pen1s) you HAD TO USE THE LADIES' DRESSING ROOMS. Now obviously it's impossible to conclude anything other than that Target is doubling down on stupid by forcing ALL MEN, even those with common sense, to use the ladies' rooms. These people really aren't going to stop with their insanity and progressive bigotry, obviously."
"""The fact is, TGT stock, profits, sales, and traffic are all down about 15 percent""That's a lie"
"horrible earnings report......ly was $1.28 vs. Ty $1,21 eps ....yes did they beat the liberal analysis estimate. ...yes. But it's what you do against last year. FAILING COMPANY.....stock will be down to $50 in 2 weeks."
anyone else getting nervous owning at these levels? if the earnings disappoint this could get whacked. owned since the mid 50s
"TGT is not BBY or WMT. Not even close at this present moment. It's getting into overvalued territory. I don't usually short stocks, but at 65 it would be tempting. I don't think it will get there, but would be a very safe evaluation to start a short position. Reminder this stock is 85%+ institutional. They will take profits at an instant, and everyone in at the top will get burned. Take your profits before they take theirs."
"Hey Artie, it's funny how Trump's tariffs only seem to hurt Target, and not its main competitors, Walmart and Amazon, don't you think? One of us is delusional for sure, and not only because he thinks men can magically become women just by wishing it."
"I've made Target the go to store for groceries three times in Sept. The Knollwood store in Hopkins,MN has kept its shelves stocked much better! New lower prices are great! Lots of shoppers!"
"I have seen 2 stocks closed yesterday like FCEL closed today. around 1M-1.5M buying in last 2 minutes. today one opened at 100%($ARAV), $tgt opened at 25%. No expectations on news from fcel tomorrow, but possible something next week. - just saying.."
This thing is going up like a tech stock LOL !

"Sure Artie, tell me this happens at Walmart. I have posted dozens of stories written about Target arrests, there are very few that happen in Walmart, even if you look. As if that matters, because everyone knows that Target's policies are dangerous and contemptuous of womens rights to safety and privacy, you just don't care, because you're a brainwashed bigoted cult member of the Holy Church of Liberal Insanity. Right Artie? OF course, Artie"
74 wow
"Looks like Target's decision to de-emphasize flyover-land big-box stores and open small-format stores in urban centers is paying off in spades! ...and all of this is working even with the _enormous_ headwind of the so-called ""boycott""!"
"I find it amusing that longs think the boycott has had no effect on sales/revenue. The only real question is how much effect has it had. Was the boycott the sole reason for the plunge in price? Maybe, maybe not. But there is no question the lower traffic is, in part, due to the boycott. If you're still denying it, you're a fool. Men don't belong in the little girls room. Get that through your thick skulls."
"Insider bought lots of shares, This tell me TGT is on the right track and growing omni channel distribution with increased online sales as Walmart. Both have scale, size and strategic location that Amazon does not have."
Happy Transitioning! ;)
"You know, I'm really looking forward to watching Target crash and burn. This will serve as an object lesson to the brainwashed cult of sick individuals who want to cram their perverted agenda down the throats of the general public. Most of America has enough common sense to know that any company that shows contempt for the privacy rights and beliefs of their female customers, as well as their safety, should go out of business, and the sooner the better!"
Target = Trash
I myself bought some puts today on the fence with target love the stock still holding some from March dip just thinking market had a good few days a lot of retail already priced in if they don’t have spectacular earnings it’ll just be an ehhh... don’t think we’ll see 130 in May.....
TGT smashed revenues and earnings in the 1st Quarter!!! GO TGT GO!!!
can we talk about how target has been on an absolute tear lately ?
White House chaos
"Look at the volume and you will know that this is institutional buying happening right now. Walls are being broken as we speak. I'd love for someone to explain the 10% drop. If all you have is boycott and bathroom, it's probably better to be quiet."
Can’t compete with Walmart
CRASH BELOW $50 is TOMORROW. .....WOW DO THEY DESERVE THIS
"Chewy – HEEL!Chewy, Inc. ($CHWY/NYSE) is a recent IPO that has all the makings of a train wreck for minority shareholders.The Company raised several hundred million dollars in its initial public offering of 46,500,000 @ $22/share; however, the bulk of proceeds were taken by Chewy’s owner Petsmart and sponsors. Petsmart maintains majority economic and voting control through super-voting shares and will be free to sell more of its 273,500,000 shares on December 15, 2019 when its lock-up agreement expires.The stock is buoyed by an overheated market and incomplete and misunderstood information, including inflated e-tailer comparable valuations such as ETSY ($ETSY/12x sales) and Amazon ($AMZN/50x EPS), a minimal beat to the guidance given in the Company’s SEC filings (reported as a miss by news services), a belief that auto-reload revenues (67% of sales) are sustainable into perpetuity (in fact cancelable at any time), views that repeat customers will continue to increase spend (the law of large numbers catching up now), and an overall avoidance (or ignorance) of the significant competitive threats around including WalMart’s ($WMT) launch into the pet care space with thousands of in-store vet clinics with PetIQ (VetIQ of $PETQ).Repeat business and rising average spend per customer has been a substantial driver of growth, but we believe this trend by existing customers is now peaking and the law of large numbers will decelerate top line growth. Note that management’s first post-IPO guidance calls for low single-digit % top line growth in the next three months from the most recent report.The Company is free cash flow negative and has little leverage in its operating model especially in a commodity pet food/products world demanding next day shipping from the likes of $AMZN, $WMT and $TGT. The market is characterized by substantial price competition which shows no sign of abating. Despite the fallacy f the argument, pet owners’ loyalty to their animals does not translate to loyalty to $CHWY products and services or its brand. With less than $150MM in cash and burning funds for the foreseeable future, we believe there is little room for error for this online kibbler as it navigates its way to the world of the “big dogs.”There is no fundamental basis for an online pet food company to trade at $13BN valuation or 3x sales while burning cash. We recommend investors SELL $CHWY based on an IPO that has essentially taken a bankrupt company public while allowing its control shareholder to unload hundreds of millions of dollars of paper in an unprecedented sign that the overall market is in a “second dot.com bubble”. Our price target is $11, which represents 1x annual revenues of $4.4BN based on roughly 400MM shares outstanding. That said, current Internet multiples are inflated, and in a normalized environment, we estimate CHWY shares are more fairly valued at 2x gross profit or 0.5x-0.6x sales, which represents an EV of $2.2BN-$2.5 or $5-$6 per share."
"I just looked and this was up 7, what the heck"
Analyst models need to be totally reworked $10 forward earnings at minimum 25 PE. Do the math
"This only lowers Amazon’s margins when people buy single items. In fact, they consistently eat losses now on such events, making one day shipping even more of a loser in these cases."
Any thoughts on where this stock is headed? The CEO just sold a lot of shares so not sure how to read this.
the last time the registers all shut down was on June 15th 2014. the total time closed was four hours and had no negative impact on the shares the next day. needless to say investors should be wondering what is wrong with Targets system.
"Wow, look at that ""Pvssygrabber Market"" go.It's almost like the rise after he was elected had nothing to do with anything other than the one-time gimmick of ""tax cuts"" (but I know that's crazy talk and I shouldn't even think these things)! ;)"
"Sarah evidently can't figure out that the market has been flat since January of 2018. The reason for this is because the run-up during the p.g.'s first year in office had nothing to do with anything other than the promise of corporate tax-cuts. After that, the p.g.'s ""bag of tricks"" was empty, and the market reflected this inescapable fact."
"""Dave"" is an interesting case of the kind of brainwashing that the liberal political cult imposes on its victims. He knows full well that according to current Target policy, any man (or man weirdly claiming to be a woman), including sex offenders, can use the ladies' room of their choice. Not only is ""Dave"" aware of this policy, he fully supports it. And not just in Target either. Dave supports it everywhere: in public schools, locker rooms, showers, you name it. But then he says we're ""lying"" when we point out that basically this policy is an open invitation to sex offenders. This kind of cognitive dissonance can only be found in thoroughly indoctrinated cult members. Or people who know better, but are just lying. This liberal political cult is really realy weird, and defnitely a threat to society."
"Bigots lose again. Thank you Target, Amazon and other businesses who stand up against this bigotry!http://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lgbt-idUSKCN1AW038"
Gary Cohn's resignation is causing the market to crash in after hours.
Goldman upgrades Target after earnings and places TGT on their conviction list! Target is seeing great growth in their e sales and should be on everyone’s buy list as full year guidance maintained. No effects of COVID!
"Just sold my WMT and bought TGT with the proceeds. TGT has more room to run, a much better dividend, and a three times lower P/E. Earnings next week will be the determiner of the brilliance or idiocy of my trade."
I never thought the boycott would be this effective. Congratulations to the millions who have joined us.
"Yes, Sarah, ""conservative socialist"". The pvssygrabber doesn't believe in free markets. He believes in manipulating markets (but in a deplorable way).It's true that the Market rose 25% since the pvssygrabber was elected, but the market rose about 20% during Obama's first 2 years, and then it _kept rising_ for most of the remaining 6. If you look at the whole chart since 2008, the pvssygrabber's first year looks more like a continuation of the Obama market/economy with a bit of an amplification because of the 1-time trick of promising tax cuts. Notice that once the tax cuts happened, it's been all stagnation and volatility since."
"Similar happened to Hasbro a few years ago. After it broke all technical barriers after earnings when it was around $80, its handle went to $115 before a downward reversal began. The charts look similar and the cup and handle patterns are performing the same."
"Congratulations to the people of Australia for defeating the RWNJs within!(I know this doesn't have anything to do with TGT, but I figured it would annoy Sarah). ;)"
"I see Target stock is tanking again. Must be another steller sales report, right Special Libt4rd Ark? Isn't that what always happens with good sales reports with TGT?"
all the gains from the last quarter great quarter are now gone. this stock is a joke
So much ignore use needed for this board.
"the trouble with a huge stock move based on a fair beat is that it is essentially a ponzi scheme where there is a coordinated effort among a few along with the unwitting but unitiated traders that pick periods to drive prices up and then let fall before repeating the effort again and again. the last one today started at 3:46 and drove the stock from 102 to 103+. sadly, there are many of you who will suffer from the baked in serious drop the next couple of days. there will be some attempts by these crooks to repeat this effort tomorrow but it will not be as dramatic and may fail. take your profits and let the dust settle."
"Stopped by Target today. Save $0.18 on a small bottle of A-1 steak sauce. My wife and daughter got a totally free sexual assault from one of the sex offenders Target management invited into ladies' rooms. Very memorable experience, but think I'll shop Amazon next time!"
this will be in the $30's in a month. WATCH
"Curious why TJX has a much larger multiple vs TGT and has a larger market cap, even though TGT has a large digital presence and runs an essential business and TJX does not"
Upgrades are rolling in!
Another day another win
"Very nice day for TGT. Not getting greedy sold my 187.50 call I bought early in week for a very nice profit. Holding my shares, those r long term."
"Another entry into the annals of liberal cluelessness:""The Associated Press reports that the Seattle region had the third-highest number of homeless people in the U.S., despite the city spending $68 million on combating homelessness last year."""
The worst thing about Target's famous bathroom decision was the plunge in the quality of posters on this board.
the low amount of trading premarket trading g is getting some traders excited and some are throwing more money at this ponzi scheme. please don't be fooled. this will crash in the next couple of days.
It surprises me that a news release like this would come out two months before earnings release. Sales are unprecedented and yes there are shortages and inventory concerns and challenges on how to keep up. So why not a news release about everything the company is doing to rise up to the challenge? Not the type of news needed at this time because it just undermines faith in the company. Duh. Your shareholders deserve more.
"sarha=LocalOwner, and in real life he is Tim Wildmon, the president of AFA. Same language used by Wildmon in various videos and quotes available online."
Walmart reports tomorrow morning and target the day after!! Gonna be blowout for both!!!
Amazon would be blocked from buying Target. BABA has a better chance to be honest. And even that is slim.
"TGT crushed it by every measure, firing on all cylinders, good for them, especially after all those stores where looted. I mean protested..."
"If you are a parent with young female children, don't go anywhere near a Target. The current policy at Target is to let any and all men into ladies' bathrooms and fitting rooms, no questions asked, all at the command of the LGBTXYZLMNOP lobby, for who other peoples' rights, beliefs, and privacy are utterly unimportant."
"This is increase ; come on management, call out the shorts"
"Hah 'Deceptive Democrats' .. learn to man up from sarha and quit hiding behind troll IDs. Quit pretending that you muted me or Anon. Learn to admit your mistakes like a man. You were wrong about the Target stock.. that's a plain and simple fact. If you behaved like a grown up, you'd see that my taunts (like the one yesterday when I found that you have been hiding for FIVE days) won't get under your skin. Whatever you may think of me, of Target as a store, of the gay community, of Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.... one thing is clear - you were dead wrong about the Target stock."
I m raising target to 250.
"How times have changed!I nibbled on TGT in my IRA & HSA when it was down big on earnings day.I'm up about 4.00% on both. 20 years ago, I would've yawned & said I still have to account for commissions, & can get 6.00% a year in my fidelity money market.Now I'm elated with 4.00% because it's 400 times more than the money would earn in the 0.01% money market."
I personally know of several hundred that once shopped at Target but have not since their decision to allow men in the womans restroom or dressing rooms. Given this very tough retail environment this will spell disaster for Target.
"So, TGT is up a little today, although it's bleeding off. Still down 10 percent since they announced perverts were welcome to invade their customers' privacy in ladies' rooms. Even evil gets a win occasionally, but good usually wins in the end. Bad news for Target management and the perverted bigots who support it."
"field report from target. I stopped at target and bought a few things. The store was not very busy, but it was not empty. three lanes open with a queue depth of about 4 or 5 customers in each active checkout lane. I used the bathroom without incident. I do carry a concealed weapon, and i do have some martial arts training, so I felt reasonably safe using the Target bathroom. I was not harassed by any tranny nor did i even see a tranny. It seems Sarha's concern about the dangers of Target bathrooms is unwarranted."

"$92.50 better hold, or this is going back to $80...and the 50 day is getting ready to cross below the 200 day (DEATH CROSS)."
"Not much to say about Target stock, other than that it is languishing. Anybody who bought this stock as an investment, rather than Amazon or some other company based on a new business model built on disruptive tech, doesn't know much about economics or stocks. TGT is dead man walking, maybe not dead yet but it's just waiting for Amazon to come along and deliver a knockout punch. What more is there to say, really? And like a lot of decaying old companies, Target is only shooting itself in the foot by showing contempt for half its customers."
"Time to pull the plug on the pv55y grabber experiment in November.

Was literally 79 about 6 months ago and double that it seems today. Whomever invested then....CONGRATS
Still not a single person here shorting TGT... even at 55+? How about a sub-human libertarian? The fact that no one in this board is shorting TGT says everything that needs to be said.
"ok if TGT didnt get business during the holidays it went to walmart, amazon or best buy."

"Without any underlying bad news or unusual trade volumes, dips are buying opportunities IMO. Stores are packed, stimulus, employee retention, omnichannel humming along and great management. Unless I hear otherwise I’m buying the dips like I did again yesterday. Good luck to all."
"People, this is what you get for buying into a stock market bubble, a huge reversal on great earnings. This should tell you this bubble is popping, just like the first pops in a pot of popcorn. The market just changed to a sell the rip, not buy the dip."
TARGET IS A JOKE. THE BOYCOTT CONTINUES. YOU PUSH YOUR POLITICAL AGENDA ON PEOPLE AND THEY WALK SOMEWHERE ELSE WITH THEIR MONEY!
Great buying opportunity! LOL
Raised guidance in just the past month. Good sign.
"Your wife and ""little girl"" is safer in a TGT bathroom than in a church or any room where local perv is. NASTY KID TOUCHING CULT"
"Target is doing something rather interesting. Here in Miami they are testing 2 smaller stores, one of which is a former Office Depot location. I was there yesterday. I think TGT wants to position CVS-size stores (slightly bigger) every half-mile or so. Presence. Presence. Presence."
"When I’ve had a bad day I need to remember to head to the yahoo message boards, where people provide sound technical investing advice by analyzing bathrooms. Seriously I’m laughing so hard right now, are you real humans or investors or are we being punked by kids on these message boards?"
I think it will bounce back to 60+ very easily
"Another day ends and still nothing from sahra about the Trumpzi and his brownshirts forbidding a government agency from using terms such as ""science-based"". A real example of government fascism that s/he conveniently ignores. Keep showing everyone your deep hypocrisy."
"Oh wait, it gets better. Target says that any man who thinks he's a woman is invited into ladies' rooms. But if he doesn't think he's a woman and goes in anyway, then that's illegal anyway so it's not really an invitation to him. The fact that there is no way to tell the difference between the two is completely irrelevant to the NUT JOB. This is what schizophrenia does to people like the NUT JOB, and why semantics are so important to the left. If they can control the vocabulary, they can make you believe almost anything. George Orwell wrote whole books on the subject."
Good time to average down. Target pays a dividend of $2.64 per share and that helps offset the lower price share. I did that with another holding that fell even further after I bought it but after 4 months I am ahead and expect much more. Buffet is right. Buy good companies that pay dividends and if you are long you will be fine.
Target your prices are way to high and service is poor! Why would you invest with Target. Sure not for Dividend when you can get a good Dividend (PAA example)

Man the parking lot was full yesterday...
"Owned TGT since under $100 a share. Bullish on WMT, COST, and AMZN as well and own all 4. I believe these 4 can all compete without cutting each other's throats. These retailers will all do well long term along with the discount retailers. Can't say the same for traditional retailers though. Ultimately I think TGT even at these levels has a lot more room to run."
We do have a earnings report next week and there is a giant chart gap that needs to be filled.
This is setting up to be a huge 10:30 upturn. Don't worry about the open. TGT will start it's climb around 10:30.
Your thoughts on Amazon buying Target? JC Penney ex CEO thinks it's possible....
"LMAO. Dr PantCrapper, M.D. comes out of his hiding to bring up SQ. I somehow knew this was going to happen. Doc - please don't stop here. ASK ME ABOUT SNAP. I am going to wait for your question before I share that screenshot."
numbers were good except for electronics. That tells me Best Buy is selling a bunch of stuff. Long BBY
Guys watch out next week this will be 75 at least
"I will unquestioniingly believe what any random academic says, so long as I want to."
"So, libt4rd Ark says everything is just hunky dory with TGT sales. I guess that's what you say when the stock takes a dump: ""Everything is fine! don't worry!"" LOL"
Less than two weeks away... Will Target beat or meet the concensus eps when it's time to report their quarterly earning report?  Or is it going to be like Walmart?
I could be wrong but it looks like TGT is trading at or near a five year low.
"I saw Ric Flair at a Target in South Carolina this weekend. I asked him if he owned stock in TGT and he said ""WOOOOO, you don't sell a winner woo woooooo"""
"You guys do realize the numbers they reported today are 100% an aberration and there is ZERO chance they can sustain this kind of performance? They did what a lot of retailers did who stayed open during the bogus shutdown. They GOUGED customers. When other businesses bowed to the marxist agenda, TGT stayed open and ran no sales. Everything regular price. They scrued their customers and THAT is the only reason they put up these numbers. Once competition normalizes, back down it will come. This is true for a lot of companies. If you think this is some kind of trend, you are delusional."
"Impress me Quarky, give me a screenshot shot of how many shares of BRK.A. You got that at 1.xx too, right Quarky?"
Just a quick poll on end of year target 65/75/80 ??? What do you guys think how much it will be by Jan 1st 2019
Target reached an all time high at 136.47
"Hey Quarky, looks like SQ closed at $53.35. Far from your prediction of $43 or ~$40 eventually, no?"
Buy at 140. Needs a big haircut for me to buy in. 20% drop coming....
"On second thoughts, this deserves a separate thread. Deceptive, why do you call everyone a ""schizo""? Kind of like an overweight person at a beach calling others fat. (In my defense, I didn't start baiting you until you presented yourself, yet again, as a willing bait)"
Can we stop talking about the “boycott”? Its impact was small to start with and whatever momentum it might have once had is obviously gone by now.
Perhaps transgender will keep target in business. My wife and most of her friends will never shop there. CEO better pray that the transgender will keep target afloat. Keep dreaming
When was the last time market analysis got it right 
Looking at the chart I am surprised this didn't fall more.....
Overreaction.

"Three posts in a row, and I am the one that is ""triggered""? Ok monkey, rrrrriiiiiight. Meanwhile, please point out how my previous comment is grammatically incorrect. This should be good. C'mon monkey, dance for me!"
"Target will continue to bleed out gradually. Even bad management takes time to kill a good company. Look how long it is taking for Sears to die. I have utterly no respect for the so-called ""urban"" stores. The future is online, and if you're not in that game, you are either dead or you are going to become a niche player. That's Target's future."
started investing in target and walmart as seeing huge upward trend
Someone should clue the 1953ists into the fact that tariffs and protectionism are more of an 1850s kind of thing.
"TGT will beat, get in now"
"Seriously, none of you pervert fanatics have ever answered the simple question of why the sexually confused can't simply use the private bathrooms that are in nearly every Target store. Why do milliions of women and girls have to have their privacy, beliefs, and safety compromised to satisfy the demands of a tiny, sexually confused minority? Do you not have any respect at all for other peoples' rights? What is wrong with you, exactly?"
"Up on a down day, good sign."
Gonna be ugly..
"Hey, Sarah, does todays news have something to do with the so-called ""boycott""?"
"Admit it, Sarah: You shared ""Army of Jesus"" memes on Facebook, didn't you? ;)"
This will close around 52-53 in my opinion. This AMZN purchase is a lotta hype...
Buying right here.
Target Deal day to copy amazon prime day. behind the ball.. let's see what this news brings
"losing $5 per share per week, TGT has till October before its a dollar stock"
Target should embrace its Tranny policy and make commercials showing men in drag happily shopping at Target and using the women's dressing rooms and bathrooms. Sure to double sales overnight.
short target lol 2000 bottle of water lol why don't u doomsdayers just buy target and relax
"Man, these RWNJs sure do ""explode"" when exposed to reality!"
Where will TGT go tomorrow? Up or Down?
"Full disclosure... I hold a fairly decent sized position in TGT, which was one of my first investments back in 2000. I've held all since and added to the position for the first time in years when it dipped to the mid-$50's last year. While I didn't hit the yearly low, I'm still happy with my timing. I expected earnings were going to be impacted due to higher spending, and quite honestly I'd have been disappointed if they weren't. TGT should be spending heavily right now. They need to do what's necessary to compete with AMZN and WMT for the long term. I think they're making wise decisions. I have no plans to add shares at current levels, but if it somehow dropped below $60 again, I'd happily add to my position, continue to reinvest my shares and feel comfortable for the long term. If you don't hold shares, sub-$70 is a good spot to start averaging in, in my opinion.BTW... I still believe there's a real chance AMZN will acquire TGT at some point. This would essentially complete AMZN's brick and mortar footprint and give them the flexibility to do just about what ever they want to do in U.S. retail. While I'm a happy TGT shareholder, I'd also be thrilled if AMZN acquired TGT with a decent premium priced in. Good luck folks..."
"So here's a funny:Sarah has publicly stated that s/he plans to short the stock now. I don't actually believe for a second that even Sarah is stupid enough to short a stock of a profitable company that's growing, has a P/E of 11, a price of only about twice its book value, has a dividend payout of 4.4% when it's trading near its 52-week low, but...Whether it's true or not, the point is that s/he claims to be doing so. I suggest that we harass him/er about this at every possible chance. When you do, I'd suggest always referencing the so-called ""boycott"" (and don't forget to include the words ""so-called"" and or put the word ""boycott"" in quotes as a subtle diminutive)!"
"Too much credit for AMZN as the problem for Bricks and Clicks Retailers like Target. There was a time when the company focused on the customer and what they really wanted and they delivered against that vision. Target had a pedigree and genesis that was far different from any other mass merchant or discounter due to the parent which was Dayton Hudson one of the best regional department stores of the era; Many Key executives came from there and later many key executives would returm to Dayton to move them along as well. The products were far better than Walmart, Kmart,Zayre et al. Strong pricing and exciting promotion. Walmart evolved and improved and challenged Target through pricing ( every day low ) and rn a more cluttered, low cost structure as Target always could be relied on to delivery a clean, well light store with clean polished floors and excellent value both in staple and promotional emphasis that was a leadership position in the entire retail industry. Buyers and marketers were challenged to delivery high taste product lines in home and fashion. Outstanding seasonal merchandising with a tuned assortment and introduced always with impeccable timing. Pricing on all key items was ensured to be equal to or lower than any retailer in the market place. And the customer responded awarding them strong comp sales growth and new store prototypes to maintain a role of leadership in the industry. What happened ? As the company prospered under many CEO transitions as there was a Targay way of producing an entire package that was pleasing to the consumer trade while engineering a good return on investment. The company was feeling the pressure on gross margin rate and decided to expand the snack food area and use it as a promotional vehicle to draw traffic. Not a bad strategy and it worked for a while very nicely. Then the company over time decided to increase margins in departments and categories where they had developed distinctive competitive edges. Later fresh food was added to further drive traffic. It worked for some period of time but the pricing and reliance of trend and seasonal merchandising eroded slowly over this time line while others who were followers continued to improve . The once sharp edge began to be dull. Not bad but no real leadership. Quality and value in apparel began to spin down with reliance on some B level Brands and designers entered the mix. Margins continued to erode while the once successful strategy of convenience,basic, power and seasonal became obscure as a new generation of strategic marketing and merchandise management moved into higher positions. Still a nice clean store with some nice products not so well defined in terms of a merchant ego of this is what we believe . It is missing and sales are spiraling down as Walmart and now Amazon have picked them off on pricing. The SKU arithmetic has made it very hard to find any really power assortments and now adjacencies look like they are an experiment to see how confusing they can make the store to shop. I am s former Target Executive and I loved the company but I see the thinking along marketing and merchandising so eroded that it is not hard to understand why Canada failed. There is an umbrella that still exists here under the powerful brand image that has been established over the years. The mechanics were never established in Canada so there was no hard earned brand casting marketing sunshine over the Bullseye .I went today and spent 3 hours in my local Target. I b ought only $32 worth of merchandise but mostly non competitive priced and a package of pork. The Home and seasonal areas were in a word uninspiring. House wares was very good in content and adjacency. Fashion adjacencies were excellent. Better than the product in my opinion.Pricing was pretty much way over the market even in food. Store was not very busy when considering that Sunday has a new flyer out. The cashier was very nice and really the only employee I had any interaction with and that is neither good or bad but just a fact.There was a stocker in grocery who really had no interest in engagement. Big problems ahead as well as in their wake. The strategy that demands price as the primary driver is in trouble but then if you choose to ignore price as a driver altogether , service,convenience, assortments, trend must make up for the highly visible price driver and I witnessed nothing that was a big enough differentiator to provide adequate off set. I can tell you with great certainty that the new everyday low price strategy did not work when Target implemented in Atlanta in the early 1980 era and has less of an opportunity to succeed today as the plant , product and people can not deliver against this format well enough. The customers want to be excited about what is new and on trend and how Target will once again deliver against that. Not enough theater and too much vanilla along with a grocery mix that can not achieve enough traffic for the rest of the store to thrive. If you wnt to sell apparel then make it stand on its' own. Done. I am sorry for the length of this but retail is my life and it hurts to see this once great enterprise rush to the middle."

"I do really see why you are attracted to Creighton. Makes perfect sense. Next time you mention him, I will imgur your Creighton comments in the CHK board, so he can get to know you.. I have a feeling that this love will be mutual."
"I live 3 miles from a Target and I used to go there 3-4 times a week until the CEO took his offensive stand against common sense and good morals. It has been extremely inconvenient 9 or 10 times (particularly around Christmas) to make the 7-8 mile drive to other stores but I have not made even one purchase at Target since that happened and I will not until the the CEO is fired. For you investors who are concerned about your online sales taking from your brick and mortar stores or Amazon stealing sales, you are missing the forest for all trees. Your CEO's staggeringly foolish decision has destroyed your business and your new 52 week low will likely be your new 52 week high, at least for the next 12 months."
First day in TGT and this feed.. I can tell theres a lots of trolls in here. Cheers to the longs 
Thumbs Up (for up) or down today? My Jan 25 calls are taking a poll.
Looks like a retest of the lows coming over the next few months.
TGT upgraded to a BUY and OUTPERFORM with $130 target price!
"Last I heard, Ark was in a treatment facility for evaluation. He lost his retirement in the Target meltdown last year. The boycott got him. Don’t let it get you too."
"So let me get this straight, if I buy TGT now without knowing a bottom price, will those doubling dividends (paid every three months) cover my daily losses in stock price?I'm not getting the reason behind this dividend push or reason to buy TGT for a dividend. Don't dividends get cut when earnings drop? Haven't earnings been dropping for almost a year?"
"Inflation is out of control. They can lie all they like and pretend it isn't, but we can see with our own eyes."
Something needs to be done with those Program traders. They are the only ones making money. Freaking TGT opens up 20 points and then drops 30 points in 15 minutes. Freaking BS
"No price appreciation in Target for 12 years. There's a good reason for that, it's called ""bad management"", a symptom of which is a corporate culture which has no respect for the privacy rights, beliefs, and public safety of its female customers, who do not want to be unnecessarily exposed to predators in Target ladies' rooms. TGT is dead man walking, the next Sears or K Mart."
"Just trying to get you to address your lies with actual verifiable information. Yet, somehow, you never seem to be able to do that. So, did you lie about Target being down in the time frame you specified, or not?"

COSTCO EARNINGS....If Costco earnings are great TGT and WMT will move up as well. $$$$$$. $155.00 at market close today.
Nice to see that no one's worried about my TGT investment today.

"They are still playing games. The new private bathrooms are not for the ""gender challenged"" people. They still get to pick whichever restroom they want! It's for regular people who don't want to share the ladies room with Ralph in his new mini-skirt. Why not make the new private bathrooms the ""gender challenged"" bathroom? Between this and their no guns policy including for people who have a legal license to carry one, my wife and I are still never entering one of these stores again. I'm not going in any store where the only people who will be armed are criminals who laugh at their idiotic rules and in fact will be attracted to the place because they know no one else will be armed. They will soon go the way of K-mart and Sears... a slow death spiral. If you want to be in the retail business, then sell stuff and get out of the social engineering business."
"I actually think that if not for posts by ""Deceptive Democrats"" (now known as Regressive Liar) and ""sarha/Sean"" (now known as Obvious dumdum), I would have waited to cover my TGT short position back in June. I probably would have seen a $2.50-$3/share loss as opposed to $0.80/share loss."
Is going up today ? If so how high ? Exact numbers please...
"sarha, your buddy says WMT is getting beat up. Your thoughts? Maybe a cherry-picked statistic on how one should have bought Walmart? You can also use this opportunity to talk about your pedophile fantasies."

"Love tgt. If you think about it almost half of walmart is grocery items translating to very thin margins (profits). However, targer only has a small section for food. They have a big selection of toys which have great margins, and if you look at some of the toys they are also made exclusively for target (even greater profits). Target has loyalty and there is a sense of comfort when shopling at a target. The shopping carts roll smoother, the staff is more polite and seem happier and the shopping bags dont rip like target. We invest in target because we SEE THE DIFFERENCE. Great run company"
above 15 percent post er is a good number to sell ......if u want to make a short

"Naturally the fake news media, being run primarily by liberals, refuses to report on the explosion of arrests at Target stores. Fake news is only one aspect of the fake liberal world.

"The stream of fake news continues.

This country has gone half ret4rded I think, rotting from the head down."
"I saw this article where Dave explains why he likes to use the ladies' room at Target because he identifies as a 6 year old girl.

"TGT as one of the main ""recipients"" of the future stimulus will undoubtedly skyrocket.

What just happended? Went down like 5.5% and recovering
"Oh good, the DNC convention is over for the night, futures going back up."
Shareholders would have seen a positive day in stock performance if NOT for the inane TRANSGENDER policy. People like me are NO LONGER SHOPPING AT TARGET STORES.

I sold. Company is in great shape but I will buy back after the next market downturn whoever that is. Cost structure will be higher than anticipated and Target just extended their hazard pay.

Pending this I will do my best to spread the word on the internet, and in private conversations with friends and family."

I believe TGT is under accumulation as a value stock. A great dividend and a great earnings report and a super low pe means this will shoot up to 90 quickly. It should now trade at a pe of 20 and still be lower than other retailers hence the $100 price target.

"Want to know something target is excelling at that no other retail is even close to catching them at? The app. Go to the Apple App Store and download the app and check it out yourself. For long term growth, Target has to attract millennials. As a millennial, I love the app. You can have every coupon saved in your card, and have them scanned as well as your red card scanned at checkout. A simple and easy: 5% discount, coupon scan, and payment. Positive for both the consumer and the company. Cartwheel deals are easy to access as well. 423,000 ratings on the App Store with a 4.8 star rating. This shows the advantage on hand that target has. Check Walmart, Costco, and Kroger’s apps in the App Store. Say goodbye to paper shopping lists when you can have it in your app on the phone. This will lead to a higher rate in purchases and I am so glad I started a Target position over the summer. Sit back and enjoy the ride. With the continued process of: enhancing the supply chain, increasing the store experience, and dubbing the retail stores as distribution centers; target has a bright future ahead for shareholders and consumers!"

price is stabilizing. I expect will be up this week or this month as official sales numbers come out
"it has nothing to do about the boycott, it's all about the rise in interest rates which negatively impact the stock market"

This is an idiotic selloff. Bought a bunch this morning under $50. Amazon is NOT going to be the ONLY company people buy food and clothes from. Absurd...............
"Schools reopening , stimulus checks , refunds , economy opening , earnings beat, buybacks , interest rates kept at zero .... SP still stuck at $179"
"Wife & I stopped shopping there as well. We have 2 kids and used to shop there, it is about 3 miles from our house. Walmart is about 5 miles, I feel comfortable letting my 12 year old daughter go to the bathroom there."
99 bucks is a buy. With good earnings it will should bounce back to 115-120 range.
I know my target will beat earnings... I don’t know if that matters these days
Not sure why ANYBODY would sell this stock going into the Holiday season. They killed earnings and gave good guidance. Hope this is just short term profit taking because it makes no sense in a green market.

"Hey santani - Bill Gates doesn't even have an undergraduate degree. How successful do you think he would be if he had finished school? LOL That's a rhetorical question. Also, you ask""precisely which of them do you claim superiority when compared to us educated folk?"" I think you should put ""educated"" in quotes since so much of what you claim to have learned is suspect. Most highly successful entrepreneurs do not have advanced degrees, they hire people like you to fill out the ranks of drones in large corporations."
Dead cat bounce
Will Target hit 84 by end of year?

"Gee, I wonder why Target's sales have plunged. Most people who visit Target stores notice a distinct lack of foot traffic, and this is borne out in the numbers reported today. Couldn't have anything to do with a demented, dangerous ladies' room policy and a resulting boycott by millions of former customers, could it?"
"The stock market continues to set new highs daily, whereas those who have chosen to invest in the perverted Target stores continue to lose money. Sounds like social justice to me."

TGT: to the moon. This time is different.
"All this posting about nothing serves longs immensely - I do not kid. No coherent discussion about TGT's actual challenges is possible. I went to Walmart today after a while and I noticed some differences and thought.. ""that's interesting"" but obviously this is not the place for a reasonable discussion."
"Looks like Retail Investors are no longer Buying TGT and it’s trading up based on Technicals. If it doesn’t correct soon and goes to $115-$120 then strongly suggest Shorting the stock, but if it corrects soon (~10%) then suggest Buying. I still like like TGT long term but the risk-reward at these levels aren’t worth the investment until it corrects (much better stocks to invest in that can reap 50% returns, not like TGT at only about 10-15% more upside at these current high levels)."
been a little hard on the good folks over on the WMT board but they seem a nice enough lot -- you guys I don't know
"Target is going to feel like Nordstrom to those who have filed for unemployment. They have clothes, food, beauty, cleaning supplies, toys, games, electronics, home decor items, and much more. It is a one-stop shop for essentials and non-essentials alike that feels like a luxury outing without astronomical pricing. It did just fine through COVID-19 and will thrive after the fact as well."
knock knock opportunity
"Chic is what you make it. If you use social media and have a few teen idols wear your brandat some award show or media event you can make anything the ""hot new thing"". Better yettag a young new designer to roll out a line and sell it on line in limited quantities. Say yourwebsite crashed because of the great demand and watch Ebay as people try to outbid eachother at twice the original price. Smart TV ads with the right people and an affordable pricecan go a long way"
Lol..how us that bathroom policy working out
TGT needs a new CEO ASAP !!!
"I'm sure when Comey, Strock, Page, McCabe, and other corrupt FBI officials are brought up on charges (rather than just being fired) all the delusional left will call it just one big conspiracy theory, even after jail sentences are handed out. It's very difficult to de-program people from a cult, especially the liberal cult."
looking strong. should get through 114 resistance this week.
Another one. Current Target policy is that this man is welcome in the ladies' rooms in all their stores. Isn't that nice?https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Arrest-for-Photographing-Women-Wearing-Skirts-Target-489831341.html
Officially hit the 50 dma. I’ll wait a bit to see if it drifts down a bit more to accumulate more ahead of earnings
"The pg's reckless and ill-conceived ""deals"" continue to be a drag on the market. Unfortunately for TGT, this means the the share price may ""only"" rise 6 or 7% today."

"Yes, Sarah, to answer your question, I _am_ a free marketeer. I just happen to not believe that it's appropriate to take a pure ""free market"" approach to essential social services like education and health care.One of many strange things about you pv55ygrabberists is that in your own oversimplified world, anyone who is not also a pv55ygrabberist must be a ""liberal"" or a ""socialist"". There are only two kinds of people. Sounds sort of like the stuff my daughter used to tell me when she was 3."
Any reason as to why TGT is down today when general market is up ???

"Excellent job reminding ""Folks"" what happens when one shorts TGT. Thank you PantCrappingRegressiveLiar. This is the reason why PantCrapper kept posting comments everyday ""back to 40's"" but never had the balls to short TGT. Or so he claims."
Given WMT's quarter I'm not at all surprised by TGT. Own both of these. AMZN may put a lot of retailers out of business but WMT and TGT have major staying power.
Target in Minnesota got looted hard by the rioting people. Saw a video with one guy moving 3 smart TVs while everyone is running out with hands full... all we need is Dems and media to keep enabling this poor societal behaviour and the USA will be destroyed in a year

"A blowout report and this surges to $100. This still trades as if Amazon will decimate Target’s business. It hasn’t, nor will it. It’s forced Target to improve while Amazon’s platform has become inundated with fakes, junk, ghost storefronts, the proverbial garbage heap. Two day shipping no longer moving the needle? That’s a testament to Target and Walmart, not Amazon."

Hi Artie!
"Good update, why down?"
I have owned TGT for nearly 40 years and was so happy when their top management quit talking about bathrooms and started doing a great job leading and managing.
"Paging fuel. Help us root this stock higher! Crazy to think I am the pumper here, but it is what it is! Go TGT!"
"Wow, nice sell-off at dat dar end of the trading day and week. LOL."
They are going to be able to cut a lot of costs in the new store format by combining the mens and women's changing/rest rooms.
Shorts' pain is the best kind of music.
"I love these talking heads on CNBC that are almost always momentum junkies....I sold because it was up over 100%.....Most I think just like to have an new idea every day as CNBC is an advertisement for the industry. More activity more revenue. They never have on people that just sit on their investments. It is a new idea, new stock every day.....and most of the time, positive on things when the market is UP and more negative on things when prices are DOWN.There are few to really listen to.....Aswath Damodaran (NYU Professor, Gold Standard on Valuation). Valuation is what matters in the long run, otherwise you are just gambling on guessing others actions. Follow the numbers every quarter....they tell you if the company should be worth more or less."
"Great earnings, but not worth 17% gain. Sold. Good luck longs"
Nice gains...institutions will take them premarket Monday
"The Target CEO has $hit the bed and poisoned this stock for years. Many people will never go back to Target even if the CEO is fired, which looks like it will happen eventually as word of mouth gets around and sales drop even further than they have.Letting men into bathrooms with women and children is simply a violation of privacy, in addition to needlessly exposing innocent people to all kinds of risks. It's simply idiotic."
"Analyst Actions: Nomura Lifts Target's Price Target to $135 From $121 on 'Unique' Positioning, Keeps Buy RatingBY MT Newswires— 9:20 AM ET 05/21/202009:20 AM EDT, 05/21/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Target ( TGT) has an average buy rating among analysts, with an average price target of $127."
This pullback is healthy. A nice buying opportunity for those who keep cash for these times. Please don’t confuse the pullback with Target’s performance. Target’s woes are directly related to the ongoing boycott
"Texas, the guy who likes to express every single thought in a separate post, are you an investor here -- either as a long or as a short? If not, do you intend to be an investor here? Please do not reply to this post. I insist that you create a separate post to reply. How about 3 separate posts? lol"
"This Nike talk could be a real catalyst to drive traffic in store and on line if it’s actually playing out. The recent new associations with Disney (although small) ToysRUs fulfillment and Levi’s (now includes dept store Levi 501 assortment) tell a story. Top operator Nike might be reading the tea leaves and decide it’s business would benefit mightily by being a participant in TGT’s highly curated, no junk allowed third party website program. Additionally the decline of mall based FootLocker stores and others, the shrinking and consolidated sporting goods big box locations and rapidly weakening dept store traffic (Macy, Kohl, JCP etc) makes TGT is a pretty desirable partner for Nike’s lifestyle footwear and apparel. The demographic for Nike is spot on with the Target guest. Will be fascinating to watch this possibility play out as a genuine win-win."
"I don't think this message board does anything to the s.p. but thanks to the bathroom troll, it's never really possible to have a meaningful discussion on the actual challenges Target is facing as a retailer."
"TGT spent $1.2B on shares, at an average price of ~ $191 / share. Uh - the historical high for the stock is in the $80s.. BAD USE OF CAPITAL!!"
"Dozens more of these stories to post. But Target management and their supporters don't care, and don't want you to know."
To $80 today i hope lets go
"TGT is the next K-mart. Great long term short, just like Tesla. Only a matter of time for this retail dinosaur."
"Look for $105 close today. If it holds, bullish trend is still intact"
"TARGET'S possible new strategy: Will copy Walmart's strategy for home delivery but with this caveat: Targetwill make use of their most 'friendly' customers, the TRANSVESTITES. The TRANSVESTITE will pick up packages boughtby heterosexuals for home delivery. The TRANSVESTITES will deliver these packages to private homes FREE. The caveat:The TRANSVESTITES will have exposure to the bathrooms and dressing rooms of the heterosexual customers. This EXCITING feature will give more 'opportunity' to 'express' themselves with children and others in their private rooms.TARGET has not commented on this new possible strategy that was leaked by a TARGET transvestite."
ObviousPedophile - have you noticed how you no longer pretend to say anything about the Target stock anymore? Today is the last trading day of March. Should I remind you of your prediction?
"Today was a gift unlike we have seen in awhile. This sector CRASHED for no good reason. This is a tough , small margin biz. Amazon was already in it. The big players like TGT will bounce right back, and may even become acquisition targets ( KR, SVU, SFM). This is a steal...."
The boycotters of Target because of the bathroom situation have long since gone home.
Happy days are here again...da d da da da...
"Lol, TGT makes more in a quarter than nflx makes all year, yet the mkt keeps bidding nflx up and doesn't want to own a solid long term company like TGT. Price is what you pay value is what you get, most people don't understand that distinction."
"Didn't hold TGT because I really thought that the riots, criminal mischief and looting to stores, plus temporary store closures were going to taint and tank an otherwise good earnings beat."
There is strong support at $97
"Hey Artie, I hate to break this to you but Donald Trump has no control over what the Fed does, and in fact he has been railing at the Fed for raising rates. Of course, the Fed kept rates historically low throughout Barky's reign of error and towering national debt increases, and only decided to start raising them now that Donald Trump is President. Cynics might say that the Fed is doing this only in order to diminish Trump's chances in 2020. But you'd have to be crazy to believe such a conspiracy, just like you'd have to be crazy the Collusion Delusion was based on a pack of fabricated evidence by Crooked Hillary, or that Flynn was investigated by corrupt, Trump hating FBI agents like Peter Strzok, or that Crooked Hillary was cleared by Andrew McCabe, who was paid $600k by Crooked Hillary. All just wild and crazy conspiracy theories, I tell ya."
"Someone really wants this to be $70, must have sold calls hahaha"
"One thing I can't figure out. If Target is so proud of its policy, which in principle allows any man who ""feels like a woman today"" to use the ladies rooms in Target (and in practice, allows any man at all into them, no questions asked), why don't they inform their customers of it? I'm guessing the reason is, simply, that leftists lie about EVERY THING."

That's what leadership is by the way. LOL.""Restrictions on guest-worker visas, which began during President Barack Obama’s second term as immigration became a hot issue for conservatives, have gotten worse under Trump."""
"Hoping for a big drop this week as Target announces devastatingly bad earnings numbers. I sure am glad I'm not a bag holder in this stock. What was management thinking when they decided to let men into ladies' rooms? Target is a cautionary tale, don't let your insane politics get in the way of sound business practices. Sad!"
"Smaller stores, well-curated house brand products, and a bit of hip. Is that a plausible future for retail? I see Target and Trader Joe's as kind of alike."
"Did you guys/dames/pre-ops/undecideds LGBYQWERTY and that creeper obsessed with little girls hear that? That was the sound of around 750,000 shares bought back and retired by TGT just this week."
"Don't worry ladies', Target dressing rooms are perfectly safe.http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2017/06/16/man-arrested-for-filming-shoppers-in-riverside-target/"
Added more today. This has to be one of the best long term buys in the market. The dividend will pay dividends too.
My family hasen't entered a Target store for months. Obviously many other people feel the same concerning their bathroom policy. Make them pay for the CEOs stupid policy.Hopefully he will be fired soon. I feel sorry for the innocent employees who will be let go because of the weak sales.
best buy blew their earings out. SO WILL TARGET next week
Did anyone see Mad Money last night Cramer show some good charts on Target and other
"Just left the store. Plenty of shoppers - very few check out staff. Lines to the back of the store. Many people walked in, turned around and walked out."
"Delete that comment, I got it copied, ready to paste dumdum, LOL."
Looks like a bit of an overreaction to me: Picked up some shares this AM. This'll be back in the high-70s or low- 80s in a month or two ... at least barring some general economic collapse.
"It's right up there with ""I have not been wrong about my TGT predictions."" Dude, it's ok to admit that you've been wrong especially when you have been very very wrong."
Going to average down and hold long.I always shop at Target and always buy more than I planned. Go for milk and come back with 20 things.
I saw a caravan parked at Target the other day.
Dollar weakness is going to kill the major retailers that get most of their inventory out of country.
"""Gee, if only tgt stock had as much growth as SQ."" This is what PSHPT LWNJs keep saying to themselves QUARTER after QUARTER of FAILURE. Poor SNOWLAKES. That purchase price of $69.90 2 months ago seems to be working out good for the SNOWFLAKE farm. LOL."
Added 123.75!
Took a ~35 cent loss this morning.. I am probably down a little over a buck/share despite trading. One one hand I want to buy now.. the pattern I have followed a few times recently.

"Today’s Stock sell off is classic manipulation by TGT market maker intentionally done for capitulation of week hands before taking next leg higher.

The problem with this plan is that TGT may not see a big drop anytime soon. They are doing too many right things as a business. 'Retail is failing' is not a theory that applies to TGT."

TGT down 9 percent in one day. I'll bet Target wishes it had those millions of boycotting shoppers back.

"So, Maria, a long time employee of Walmart, says that if a woman complains about a man in a Walmart restroom, the police are called. Whereas in Target, men are let into ladies' rooms, no questions asked. But of course our resident schizophrenics will say that these are exactly the same policies, or Maria is fake - just like all those fake signatures, the fake boycott, the fake videos all over youtube, the fake hundreds of millions that Hillary was bribed with, the fake rapes of Bill Clinton...ALL FAKE! This is what schizophrenia looks like folks!"
"When you're faced with a huge, massively effective boycott of millions of former customers due to your own bigoted, politically motivated policies, the only way you can make up for the lost foot traffic is to cut prices.

Check out this libt4rd saying that the bigger the debt the better. Kroogman is also famous for saying the same thing. Of course that was before Trump was elected! Now it's totally different!http://theweek.com/articles/618419/why-americas-gigantic-national-debt-good-thing
March 2019 call looking good 
"Per AFA's recommendation, I have been boycotting Hallmark Cards since 2008. I hear that company is out of business.. at that's the case in my version of reality."
I tried to warn you
"Gee c, Bashing CHRISTIANS calling them ""child touchers"", But your Atheist Homosexual Transgender sicko store chain calls upon Two CHRISTIANS Chip and Joanna Gaines to sell their products in its DYING store chain. Why is that Atheist Homosexual Pedophille Mentally Ill c?"
"It may be a good time to stop for a second to discuss the ""5 stages of grief"". My guess is that Sarah will be stuck between ""denial"" and ""anger"" for a long time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kübler-Ross_model"
"Target has a low P/E, high earnings per share, robust dividend. Target is the best retailer in the country, and is a fine investment for a conservative dividend portfolio. A wonderful place to shop - where you get everything you need at cheap prices. Hungry from shopping? Have cake and coffee at the Target Cafe. Need to tinkle? Visit Targets wonderful clean and bright rest-rooms."
"The only people that would complain are those that don't own the stock. A company buying back it's own stock typically means the company has a positive cash flow, and feels the stock price is undervalued. Both great things for actual stock owners. And yes, the repurchase of stock does boost the stock price, another positive for stock owners. If you think it is for the wrong reasons, sell your stock now and take the gain! I personally am already up 7% on this stock, not counting the dividend, and believe the stock is undervalued. So I am holding my position. My personal opinion is the price will continue up into the 60's with more upgrades in the coming months."
"I can see why Walmart ""Remained Silent"" on the bathroom policy. Now they have former Target customers."
"Hey!! SARHAHAHAHA. How google doing, keep searching  you’re doing good jos."
"Boy, Target sure is tanking again. What to stop the slide? They've already let men into the ladies rooms. At my local Target, they've even closed the mens' dressing rooms for some unaccountable reason, presumably to ""encourage"" men to share the ladies' dressing rooms. What else could Brian try? Open NAMBLA recruiting offices near the returns counter? Lingerie for 9 year old girl brides in the Muslim community? There's so many things a ""progressive"" company could do."
on line sales slowed dramatically -- from 141 to 50 -- how important is that--NOT AT ALL-- WHY-- because if you are hooked on watching sales earnings PE ratios you are playing the game exactly how Goldman and friends want you to play it--it's all nonsense -- the new game is take it to sub 200 level in the next few weeks-- you think it can't happen--that's because you are playing the game exactly how the traders want you to ---crash a stock right after good earnings is the oldest game in town-- freeze you in place while they position themselves for the drop they will engineer - when they want to pull the rug out from under you no amount of earnings will stop the drop
The silence on this board is deafening.......... and too funny
"Stay with TGT (Buy or Hold) until the market indicates otherwise. Most make big mistake by thinking price is too high since it ran up so fast, so they sell too early or Short. Just like any stock, it will eventually come down but may need to wait days, months and sometimes years! The market is rewarding TGT now and will not allow a reversal until proven otherwise. All Technical indicators and charts are Bullish. Never bet against momentum."
these loser spammers job must be essential
No sellers. Greed ends badly. Way overbought. The upgrade price was 103.
Walmart $wmt losing to $tgt and $amzn and malls $mac i guarantee it. Tp sales down haha
funny how Russian bot not posting anymore if he believed in his posts so much u think he would still be posting
Hundreds of women violated in Target ladies' rooms in the last year. Neither Target management nor its supporters appear to care.
"Hey, who was that numbskull who kept saying what a bargain TGT was when it hit 63, and how he was going to load the boat and back up the truck at that price? Funny, I haven't seen him post for awhile. I wonder why."
"Target will really feel the pain during the holidays. While other big box retailers will have stores full of shoppers, target will have men dressed as women with an open invitation to the women's restrooms and changing rooms. Keep your children out of target."
"put a short trade on at 126.50, did not think it would hit but guess what I am now short tgt..... I'm fine with that up 100% in a year, this with the market will pull back. shorted last earnings at 106.50 and was fine, but did not hold it. good luck people, who buys after a 15% up day, fomo at its finest."
$TGT back up to $120 by Tuesday.
"WMT is down 1%, S&P is down over 1%, TGT is up 1%. Maybe America is boycotting WMT and S&P today?"
going up now. Strong Buy
The very effective boycott is taking another bite out of Target’s stock today. Billions of revenue lost. That must really rub investors the wrong way.
"Interesting how Target's fortunes continue to rise and share price continues to appreciate faster than average in spite of the ""boycott"". It's almost like the ""boycott"" isn't even real."
I am shorts at $102.52...Wish me luck tomorrow.
"I ordered something from Target.com using their new 2-day delivery option (mainly to test it out). Order was placed on Friday at 11 am local time. The system said that the item will be delivered by Tuesday but it was in my mailbox on Saturday. Interestingly, it was shipped from my local Target store using regular USPS mail (cheapest shipping option). Looks like Target is able to compete with Amazon Prime without charging an yearly fee because they are using their stores, rather than distribution centers, to fill orders... probably not all orders, but most orders."
JP Morgan just raised TGT price target to $129
As I posted 2 weeks ago - this isn't fixable. Target doesn't sell anything that consumers can't buy somewhere else and the brick and mortar customers are shopping somewhere else. What's going to bring them back? Nothing. The stock will only rebound if management can prove they can increase sales. The +4% dividend can't offset the 40% slide in the price. If I held this I'd sell it.
Ridiculous strength today!
Ex-dividend date = 2/20/2018; Cash 0.62 Record date = 2/21/2018 Pay date = 3/10/2018
"A big let down coming, just like every other earnings period."
TGT has earnings and ex div both on the 20th. should prove to be an interesting day.
"The ""rule of law"" may have its origins in the ideals of tolerant Christians, but modern day Bible Belt Christians want to subvert the rule of law in favor of tyrannical authoritarianism. They've enlisted RWNJ agents like the pv55y grabber to help them in this endeavor.It will ultimately fail."
"Target or Amazon to buy RAD ""Rite Aid ""?"
"TGT is a great investment for Income. I plan on adding more in the near future. But this message board is terrible. We need to focus on investing and not pushing political agendas. I am a married heterosexual male that shops at Target. As a consumer, they are meeting all my needs. When they no longer meet my needs or have a place in my portfolio, then I will make a change. That the grown up way! So please take all this other nonsense off the board. Under the ""..."", there is an option to delete. Please do it. Thanks"
Why won’t you just go up!
Some dumdum guy here was arguing with me 6-7 months ago about how SNAP is a good investment. I told him that he should sell SNAP because they are letting men into the ladies room and there is a nationwide boycott of SNAP. Well I was right. SNAP is down to $5 (which is incidentally the price target I set for SNAP back then).. and it's all because of bathrooms and boycott.
TGT opened up less than a year ago and just sent my old local supermarket out of business and then raised prices on select items instantly! This is in a very densely populated part of my city. They aren’t ready for the traffic they are abt to clock!!
As I said before I dumped tgt when they came out with the bathroom deal and AFTER I called Corp ha in Brooklyn park they just flicked it off so I flicked off 2400 shares and bought MNTR WoW incredible decision. Now I'm sitting great. Oh I dumped jcp and general millls too they all dumped their business plan to appease 1.6% of the gl in your face community
bought last earnings when it dipped 5%. glad i stayed
"buy high dividend and low p/e stock (TGT , Macy's ), you won't make MISTAKES,, because economic continue growth sure be bring more business for them, low p/e and high dividend stock have lot of space to growth,"
"TGT will be acquired by Amazon, just a matter of time."
"52 WEEK HIGH today, or did I miss something?"
"The boycott has burned out. No one cares. Target is too great a retailer. It is a dividend aristocrat. I am a conservative, but I can't let the ill advised bathroom policy stand between me and a good investment."
Is it good to hold or sell?
Who says TGT isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? Not sure how awesomeSTO-CKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
"I hope all you freaks , perverts and weidos are buying this stock. Cause a lot o people have had it with Targets sickos policies. Anti family sicko's shop target."
"...and despite the AFA ""boycott"", which decimated Hallmark, American Greeting Cards decided to follow their lead a few years later. Absolute insanity! ;)https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/16/target-gay-marriage-greeting-cards-sale_n_1676356.html"
when this crashes back down to earth not a word will be mentioned about me--that's fine I can move on to the next easy money trade without competition
I’m bored let’s create a problem.
"Of course. Latest Muslim terrorist was imported by Obama in 2011, no vetting. The only people who hate America more than terrorists are liberals. Sure explains why they're such good buddies."
Target has shot up. Happy days are here. The boycotters have graciously conceded and are going home. Finally Target shareholders and boycotters can shake hands and break bread together. Let's all (boycotters + Target shareholders) sit down and have a meal together.
"Also Regressive - WMT = 85.30On 3/1/2018, you said ""a good entry point"". WMT has dropped almost $4 since then. What were you saying about TGT though?"
"Regressive read this and has gone into hiding. Preparing to figure out how to respond to this situation. Regressive, I am really shocked by this development."
"Hmmmmm, Target lowers guidance consistently all year. Then announces it beats its LOWERED GUIDANCE. LOL. Geez, Anyone notice Target's profits are off almost $.30 than the same time period from last year? LOL Or that store traffic is ""Soft"" and projected to get even ""softer"" next year, according to Brian Cornell?New investors will be just as DISAPPOINTED as those that sold out of Target all year, hence the stock is still in the $50's LOL."
Way to go target now competing with the big boy delivering
$117 will soon be a norm
Profit takers late this afternoon I assume
Post thanksgiving 20% off coupon was a big hit so I am not surprised by the profit miss. Same store sales is up big. 3.6% for the quarter and 4% for January.. and there were no major storewide discounts in January. I will buy TGT again .. timing depends on the market.
I'm in.

Why do Target shoppers leave their carts in the lot?
Target grocery prices are overpriced. They need to get rid of their shoes and clothing department as they are over priced. Complete overhaul needed to avoid sinking further but may be too late.
I bought 87.5 call yesterday .Thank you Target
Time to short
Good news for TGT! Citi downgraded.
Not looking ideal for short term bulls

"I see ""Ronald"" is back to lying again about Target's policies, implying that only ""trangenders"" will use Target ladies rooms. Ronald knows, of course, that Target's current policy is to let ANY MAN straight into Target ladies' rooms, no questions asked. Why does Ronald lie, and why do people like him lie? Because they have to. Ladies, you are warned: Target is a dangerous place to bring yourself and your children, dozens of perverts have already been arrested for filming women and girls in Target ladies' rooms, and literally thousands of women have been victimized."

TGT is a steal at this price.
Retail way overpriced. Upcoming quarter will be dreadful as credit will dry up and consumers have to pay back the money they borrowed.
Brian Cornell should be leaving soon.
time to sell its hit its peak
"Sarah says that s/he is ""not in a cult"", but then posts links to ""the gateway pundit"". LOL!"
I own Target and Walmart!! Both blowout earnings and they should be up $10-15 each!!
I’m making a fortune in TGT today!!!
Everybody coffee is on me today.
"Also I have nothing to prove to you. You lie about everything, why should I feel the need to prove anything to you?"
Analysts reporting they see TGT stock rising another 20%. Any pull backs should be considered a Buying opportunity!
"People will always shop at Target because they have great affordable products, same pricing as Walmart but with better quality."
JeffW. NEVER EVER regret taking profits. You were smart You should Short this now and make another 5% easy. It's gone way to high too fast and has a gap to fill now. A HUGE GAP. at that
so its proved wmt n tgt are retail monsters ..... and thats y analyst love tgt more than wmt
What were the numbers?
"Target Corporation (TGT), Executive Officer, McNamara Michael Edward, Filled Form 4, on 04/13/2021, Disposed 31,423 shares, at Price $204.32 worth $6,420,475 Follow On Instagram, https://www.instagram.com/money_insider_stocknews/Facebook, https://www.facebook.com/Earnegy/For Stocks Inside News and Details."
Once we get the dreaded unemployment claims out of the way we’ll get a better scope on TGT price action. Mixed bag call imo.
Came back from Target. Didn’t buy any food. Shelves are empty. Trucks are unloading.

Congrats to all. Im always the late one so nothing for me.
"If you have access to level 2 data, then that's all you need to see tat this is just a pump for the execs to stuff their pockets. Massive buy walls coming and going, pushing the price up slowly. With the S&P's insignificant gain today, and the massive volume that target has today, there is no way this price is sustainable. When these guys have finished selling off their shares, this thing is gonna slam. Beware. I already got my puts in; get em while they cost nothing."
LOW has great e/r but UP a little...and it 's so weird for TGT to be UP so much today...Sell before too late tomorrow morning...

"Is everyone here Short? This board is filled with Target bashers. I'm assuming so since there would be no other reason to spew such negativity on a stocks community board unless you were short and trying to influence it to go lower. If this is NOT the case, why are you wasting the calories bashing Target?"
That can happened any where not only target that’s my point and posting news that not even close what happened on target some of them you’re right but 90% you’re not?
Would AMZN consider buying Target? Target is less than 7% AMZN market cap and has over 1800 stores
"Gee, Quarky said SQ was supposed to be at $40 or below at this time. SQ has more strength than TGT. Back to $50 soon LOL."
"Local, your letting it get too you. Just play the stock the way you think it will go. You won't change TGT, CEO or BOD. Society thinks ""Right is wrong and wrong is right"". The boycott may work but only in making profits miss at next quarter report (aug.17). TGT only reflects the moral decline in America. You will always find someone that wants to argue. Just short and make some money. Have a good day and profitable trading. I covered after the last drop and have re-shorted recently. Let's see what happens on the 17th.

"Have had to go to my local Target 3 times already this week. I will say, I have been surprised how busy the store is each time. I get there before the 5pm rush, and the parking lot is mostly full. In the store, it is busy, but lines move nice and fast since they have about 10 self check out lanes. It seems to be busier now than last spring. Traffic appears to be up. One thing that keeps bringing us back for groceries is their much wider selection of organic products than our local HyVee. Also got a couple gift cards back when buying bulk items like paper towels and TP. Good to see this store so busy again!"

Okay by now it is obvious Tgt is one of the best value-wise retail stocks out there. With a pe of 20 and a potential $7 annual earnings mark means we have upside when Tgt reports the next quarterly report including the Xmas season. While that is a long ways off I believe there is time to accumulate the stock. I would wait for a pullback below $120 to start picking up shares.
"My wife visited our local Target today. She hasn't been there in over a year. She said she had to get something on short notice and would never go there for any other reason, and probably wouldn't go there again for a long time. She said the store was absolutely dead. Store traffic is still way down at Target. I wouldn't want to be holding this stock right now."
"No, FTP QUARKY, I don't ""get the picture"". I'm not a PSHPT like you and you PSHPT community members here. LOL"
"If U are traveling cross-country on the inter-state highway system, perhaps on a family vacation, consider this. If U need a bathroom break, U can exit the highway and stop at a Target store. They are all over America. Target employees are nice and will welcome U in - and assist U to the bathroom. Perhaps also stop by the Target Cafe for some snacks & Coffee. Best Holiday Blessings All."
pick up more at the bottom today. wish i could do that with every stock
With the in store sales tanking and the stock price doing the same it will not be long before the dividends start to do the same. Even if Target fired the entire board it won’t help. The brand name is tainted. Customers who quit shopping at Target will not come back even if they revers the policy. They have changed their shopping habits. Target will have to do two things. First make people feel that their wives and children are safe in a Target store. Second they will have to give customers a reason to come back. If an climate where stores are fighting to get every customer they can Target was having problems. The Transgender policy and the way it was implemented and announced only made a weak store chain weaker.
you had the pop that the big money unloaded and went short right into-- now you get the relentless grind lower - sub 200 very soon-- it is magnetized to that level-- you can;t stop it but you can make money off it
Could we see 60's today? This is so exciting!
I think the Target bathroom controversy is much ado about nothing. Target has beautiful clean safe rest-rooms and Target is a wonderful retailer. The Boycott is a failure. Those who say Target rest-rooms are un-safe are peddling baloney. Best X-mas Blessings All.
"TGT is breaking out, momentum looks strong. ."
"TGT has had 4 - 2 for 1 Stock Splits - WMT has had 11 - 2 for 1 stock splits - eliminate 7 of the WMT stock splits and the shares would be selling today for over $9,000.00 per share - compared to $220.70 for TGT.."

"I think it's quite evident that ""c"" and the rest of the fascist pervert cult are barking mad."
"I was in a local Target (the one I used to shop at) a few months ago and out of curiosity I checked the fitting rooms to see if management had posted any warning signs telling their customers that these fitting rooms are now open to anyone of either biological sex who decides to wander in. Turns out that the Men's fitting rooms were actually closed! Thus, any and all men who wished to try something on had to use the ladies' rooms. The owners of this store are hopelessly deranged."
I’m a buyer again at 80.
"On what planet does ""equality"" demand that 4-year old girls share Target ladies' rooms with sex offenders and that everyone who has concerns about it is a ""bigot""?"
strong buy q 4 should be good
Back to where the stock was a decade ago. Freaking hilarious karma!
Most days I don't think about my TGT shares. I fly all over the country for business and I've been to maybe 20-25 different Target stores in the last 12 months. I think they are doing just fine.
Brian Cornell sort of indicated that they may have a deal with Nike. That would be fantastic for the company. Think how much traffic that would drive into the stores. TGT is just starting a long run up.
"Looks like the boycott is starting to take hold. There's really no bottom to this stock price now that customers are leaving Target in droves. And who can blame them? I sure wouldn't bring my family to a store where management has invited trannies, voyeurs, sex offenders, and mentally ill men into ladies' rooms."
"Shorts are blatantly obvious on this board...If they signed boycott, then why aren't they done with this company?...posting non-stop nonsense when the stock down, and then disappear when the stock is up. Blatant Shorts are not boycotting anything."

"LOL, TGT's mystery decline today revealed. :-)""ower sales will hurt marginsTarget (TGT) is expected to disappoint on profitability in fiscal 2017. The decline in sales, higher fulfillment costs related to a rise in e-commerce sales, and increased investments in price will all affect its profitability. During the last reported quarter, its gross margin contracted about 40 basis points, reflecting its investment in prices that support everyday low prices and a rise in digital fulfillment charges.""No mystery actually. It's been, whatchamacallit, ""NO FOOT TRAFFIC"". LOL :-)"

"Target is the next K-mart. I see liquidation truckloads of Target merchandise flooding the market every day. This store chain is suffering. It's no coincidence that its stock price has dropped 37 percent since the boycott was initiated. And their strategy going forward, as illustrated by Bloomberg below, is nothing short of idiotic. Selling discount merchandise in pricy venues like Herald Square? That's your strategy? Does Cornell even know what Target's business model is? LOL"

The pv55y grabber isn't that smart nor is he that successful.He's essentially made average returns on a large amount of money that he inherited from his daddy. I've made much better returns on my investments over the past 20 years in terms of CAGR (though I'll admit that my average investment hasn't produced as good of returns as my investments in TGT and KSS have over the past year). The biggest difference between the pv55y grabber and me is that my initial investment money came from money I had to earn by working. I don't have a rich daddy.
TGT is a bargain at these levels.....with a 2.3% dividend and a PE of 18. I own COST as well and its PE is at 36 with 1% divided

I used to be indifferent to or supportive of the gay/lesbian culture. But now they have shown that tolerance of them has simply led to danger to others. They demand to put millions of women and young girls at risk in order to cater to the mental illness and confusion of a tiny minority of sexually confused people. Time to stop tolerating the LGBT fascists.

Never understand why folks shop at Target horrible service and prices are high. Kroger and Walmart much better. Tried Target pick up this morning and drove up to pick up sign called store and asked for order. Was promptly told I had to go inside for pick up orders ordered on line. I told them I am 81 Years old and handicapped and had used the service before. They brought the order out. Store is close but my last choice for ordering anything!
"So you are going ""on the record"" saying that in the 2+ years since Target's policy was mentioned in a social media post, there have only been ""one or two"" incidents at other stores? Is that really what you are committing to, Obvious Local Perv?"

this stock like myself has an inferior complex. can't win the big game.
"I pounced on target the day AMZN announced WFM takeover. I have never been more pleased nor confident with a stock purchase. TGT did have a rough patch, but that's all it was a bump in the road. small boycott will not hurt them in the long run as they continue to make the right choices"
Does anyone know earnings release date?
"only 1.5% of shoppers signed up for boycott. He pointed out that nearly 80 million people shop at Target's stores every month, so ""at worst, we are talking about a group of 1.2 million shoppers — or 1.5% of Target's customers — who are disenfranchised."""
"Is Target still inviting all men, including sex offenders, into their ladies' rooms?Of course nut job says this has never happened, and dismisses all video documentation of it as ""fake"". Not that he's against it, by the way. He says it doesn't happen but he's still in favor of it, and that's why he supports Target, because it doesn't happen, except we all know that it does. Don't ask for rationality from these folks...simply not there."
Target has s-xy ladies shopping in the Stores. This is good. Great stock and great corporation. Also all the power in the world to Donald Trump.

I predict $130 Wednesday and $140 at earnings early March."
Good earnings report!!
I am a Conservative. I own Target for the dividends. I shop at Target because the rest-rooms are clean. Any questions?
App is not the only area though. Target's prices are better without discounting too much via cartwheel. I really should go long on TGT and stay long but my general worry about the market overall gets the best of me and I end up trading.

"Back to talking about the actual stock. It looks like TGT has hit a new higher low and bounced back nicely. By looking at the charts, I personally believe this will hit between $65-67 before another 3-4% pull back. Each time this stock has a pullback, it seems to pop right back up and double in gains what it lost in the pullback."
How many times have we seen this stock climb three or four dollars or even more only to dive to a new low? On the day of the transgender friendly announcement it was at about $84 after that it dropped to around $67 in June. It climbed back to about $78 in August followed by a drop to $66 in November. It had another jump to $78 in late November followed by a drop to $63 by early February and slow climb back to $66 by the end of February. By the end of March the stock plunged $53. By Early June the stock crept back to $57ish and then fell to $50 by late June. The cycle has been almost predictable. Slow steady gains to a point not quite as high as it was and then a drop to a new low followed by more of the same. I see nothing to indicate this will change.
There's that projection that Local Perv/Bot is known for. Hasn't yet addressed the statements of one of his own RWNJ bigot groups either.

Target has done fabulous job. The stores are cleaner and the online app is super easy to use. They really did a good job attracting customer. 
$112 Price Target by Credit Suisse. Expect the stock to at least hit this before any pull back occurs. The stock is 100% trading from Technicals and may easily reach $115-$120 before it corrects back to $100. The stock is a Day Trader’s dream that’s very predictable to buy and sell throughout the day making easy $ thousands daily.

How can anyone support a store that backs this kind of hideous policy?This is why myriad individuals will NO longer patronize this company! It's DISGUSTING and CORNELL, thedespicable CEO, should be FIRED and this policy dismantled. Meanwhile, look for this deplorable chainto continue losing customers and the stock to descend further.

Most things can be bought online, now that we have the technology to make it possible. Brick and mortar is no longer needed nearly as much as it was, and now that the social justice warriors are making public spaces unsafe for women and children, as they are in Target, we need brick and mortar less than ever. If you worry about Amazon, you should tell stores like Target to stop making their stores unsafe."

Each family that flees TGT, takes with them nearly $800 a month following the breadcrumbs WMT is dropping leading back to their stores. Next quarter profit reports are shortly coming out. As the market is selling off anticipating whatever bilge comes out of the Fed, TGT shareholders are selling as well in preparation for the BAD NEWS inevitably coming out.Looking for a bottom? Welp, as long as that Brian Cornell continues riding that wagon with WMT chasing behind it hoping for gangrene to set in, a bottom can't be predicted.I would suggest “moving along folks nothing to see here”. Just wait until December to see if Cornell opted to hop off the wagon and seek medical attention or just let gangrene set in and consume the rest of the chain."

heed my advice sell now and buy back when gap at 106 and 107 is filled.i made 150 percent in 2.5 years in this stock and it's overbought.
TGT price per share was at $60 in January. It has jumped to $124 today ELEVEN MONTHS LATER! How can that not raise suspensions in every investor??Has TGT seriously justified DOUBLING its value in the last 11 months?Makes me think of a bottle rocket on the 4th of July --- waiting for the POP before it comes crashing back to earth!
Didn't get much sympathy from WMT. WMT was down only 1.3%.

"Liar Schizo Dave and the Nut Job are excellent learning tools if you are interested in all the various rhetorical and logical fallacies that the left uses. All though both of them are fairly well versed in the use of faulty logic and other fallacies, Liar Dave's specialty is simple lying and denial of reality and the use of neologisms, which is why we call him ""Liar Schizo Dave"". The Nut Job's specialty is circular logic, although he is also well versed in Strawmen, non-sequiturs, and ad hominem. Dave has cooled it lately with the neologisms since we showed the psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia with neologisms as a symptom. So he's not necessarily stupid, just a little deranged and out of touch with reality."

"As with schizo liar Dave, every day BigK's posts demonstrate a lack of critical thinking skills, which makes clear that you are poorly educated. Schizo liar Dave says that muslim governments condoning throwing gays off rooftops is the moral equivalent of christians preaching that homosexuality is sin. Despite blatant criminality of Hillary and Bill Clinton, all Liar Dave can bring himself to say about them is that he's ""not a big fan, but they're much better than Donald Trump"". The problem with you people is you have very poor critical thinking skills. Maybe one day you will get them, but it's not promising. Until then, you'll be like most of the other sheep, believing what you're told to believe."

The troll patrol on this board have weak and empty lives. I am bearish on their mental faculties. Guess what? No one is forcing you to do business with Target. Are you really so arrogant and dumb that you believe your 1 post out only 2900 is going to tank the company? People are aware of the news. How about letting people vote with their feet and wallets?

"Target share price stagnant for 12 years. No third party marketplace, so WMT and AMZN will fight it out for dominance while TGT goes the way of Sears. Also, looks like publicly inviting all men, including perverts, voyeurs, and sex offenders into Target ladies' rooms with their female customers has to be ranked as one of the greatest management blunders of all time."
"""8"" LOL!"
$WMT stock lower than $TGT something like that
"This not just about the perverts. The policy was instituted because Target’s leadership wanted to make transgendered people feel safe and comfortable. Transgender people claim they should be able to use the restroom that corresponds to their gender identity to be comfortable. So in order to make a incredibly small percentage of the population comfortable Target decided to let the transgender crowd use the bathroom and changing room of their choice. The only problem is that if a woman is uncomfortable with a dude in the restroom with her Target doesn’t care about her. Remember Target is letting a biological man use the women’s room to make him/her/whatever comfortable. Target doesn’t care about the comfort of any woman except the transgender ones. Target doesn’t care about the comfort of teens unless they are transgendered. The only people Target cares about the comfort of is the transcended ones. If you are what was considered normal until a few years ago you are the problem and need help. I for one am not comfortable with my daughter being in a restroom, fitting room or open bay shower with a biological man. Target has made it clear they are not interested in my comfort and I will not patronize Target. The transgender crowd can go to Target and I will go elsewhere."

"Target is missing the mark in many ways. They are trying to do what JC Penny did when sales went sluggish, which is absolutely the wrong thing to do.

They need new insight, their tried and true model doesn't work anymore."

"The last 2 trading day this stock is up about $5. This stock is still a bargain folks when compared to other retailers. It is a nice place to park your money plus a nice divvy on top. At this rate, I would not be surprised if $90 rolls around by Friday, under heavy accumulation."
I remember 10yrs ago when this thing was selling in the low 70s... I had bought a ton of it in the 90s as they were expanding new stores. It went up like crazy in the 90s. But by 2007 as they matured and had almost no New store growth I thought it was pretty clear it was no longer a good long term investment and I sold off everything. 2300 shares (it split a lot in the 90s). I got between 65 and 69 a share. Obviously a good move as 10yrs later they’re at the same price. There are just so many better retailers that still have loads of new store growth ahead of themselves. Why would anyone buy this thing when they could do so much better?
"Who is the nimrod on CNBC with the pony tail that follows other options traders and says stupid stuff like ""giddy-up""? Well this genius spent all day trying to convince himself that the Target quarter was good even though they missed same store sales. He kept screaming but they were strong to the point that another nimrod (Scott W.) even got sick of it and turned to him and said ""they MISSED same store sales forecasts!"". So the liar CEO (consumer is best I've ever seen it) says that traffic was UP but they missed same store sales. Only way that can happen is if average ticket was DOWN (a bad thing) or he is including new stores as part of the traffic count while they are ignored in SSS which is totally disingenuous. He set himself up for this last quarter with that bs Cramer like comment. And you can tell Cramer knows he lied to everyone on his show because Cramer was doing everything he could to distance himself from TGT today. $55.00 stock by middle of next year. Maybe sooner."

""The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current year earnings has been revised 24.4% downward over the last 30 days.""Wait..... hasn't earnings for TGT been going down for almost a year? Where are all the other banks ""downgrades""? Zacks didn't wanna recognize the real reason behind TGT's earnings drop.Cornell still doesn't want to recognize the real reason why earnings dropped. Cornell says ""It's the groceries, I tell ya!!! I'm gonna hire Jeff Burt from Kroger to turn this sinking ship around!!!""How do you turn a sinking ship around? It's sinking isn't it?"
Target was full of families filling their carts at Eden Prairie Mall today!!!! Go Target
TGT stock is doing exactly what it did before. The stock drops after a dismal earnings report and then creeps back up until the next dismal earnings report. The upward creep accelerates the closer to the report you get. Then it drops like a rock. I'll wait to see what the next earnings report has to say.

Very sad Amazon pulled out of Long Island City. Perhaps Target should build and open a new Super-store there.
"@sarha/Sean/Local Perv Youtube videos are not evidence. Do you think they would hold up in a court of law? Is all of your belief system based on Youtube videos?

Was hoping I didn't overpay at 118 in May but didn't want TGT to get away from me. Was hoping to add more on weakness but never got it. High quality problem.

"Hello fellow TGT stock holders. New to this stock, having bought in at the end of December. Can’t say I’m pleased that I’m at a loss so early in the game but I have faith that this will turn around. Question - when is it anticipated that the holiday numbers will come out ? I am hoping that is the pop we need. Many thanks and good luck !!!"
"As long as Target sells great products at good prices, it doesn't really matter to me how many women and girls get assaulted in their ladies' rooms."
they ran all the stops today cleaned them all out nothing left to support the stock except a few retail stragglers -- you will soon see what happens when the trading desks finish their stop hunting operations- go aggressively short and front run the selling -- longs will hold on for a few more days playing right into their operation -- won't be fun for you
for those who don't know tgt usually goes up in a down market

can we hit 65 by next friday?? I think we can
"As a father of 5 children, my wife and I used to shop @ Target all the time. It was clean with reasonable prices. However, since the obnoxious transgender bathroom policy, and its antifamily positions that it vehemently promotes at every opportunity (have you seen their web page?), we are avoiding Target like it's the PLAGUE. Millions of Christians do not need to be insulted by this store's policy. Your business is business and customer service, not social reeducation and religious chastisement. For us, the damage is done. Pride and arrogance go before the Fall. Goodbye Target, Hello Walmart!"
It's looking good today ladies & gentlemen!
"So, how is the Boycott going? Anyone hear anything?"
"Yes, Sarah, it _is_ important to understand that slavery was a shameful episode in our country’s history.

"I meant to say , don’t let go of this opportunity to buy below $135"
"Target's acquisition of shipt was a brilliant move. Same day delivery and price matching Amazon should close the gap quickly. Their smaller urban stores are also another forward thinking move. This Company is not standing still. They are trying to bring the ""Tarjaay"" cache back to Target. Smart moves, smart leadership. Yes, market is volatile, but the stock is oversold at this point."
spammers galore! wow.
Anyone catch the call? Did they say something that wasn’t in the earnings release?
"I passed by Target today on my way to buying clothes at Kohls on labor day weekend. I haven't been in Target since I cut up my card and sent it to Brian Cornhole's secretary.Every store in town was packed. Target parking lot was curiously empty.

Buh bye Target. You and your perverted politics won't be missed."
"The immoral target investors are about to feel the pain of the boycott. You think last week was bad, this next week will open your eyes to the real problem—the successful boycott."
"John F Kennedy, a democrat, knew high taxes strangles the Economy, Businesses, and individual household income. What happened to the democraps, #$%$, and Regressives of today? Why do they IGNORE HISTORY?""In 1962, speaking at the Economic Club of New York, Kennedy said he was committed to ""an across-the-board, top-to-bottom cut in personal and corporate income taxes."" The tax system, mostly designed during World War II, ""exerts too heavy a drag on growth in peace time; that it siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing power; that it reduces the financial incentives for personal effort, investment, and risk-taking,"" he said.Many lawmakers worried that reducing taxes without cutting spending would create unacceptable budget deficits. But Kennedy, who famously noted that ""a rising tide lifts all boats,"" insisted tax cuts would generate broad-based growth.Congress finally approved the tax cuts in early 1964, three months after Kennedy's assassination. The following fiscal year, the federal budget deficit did indeed shrink. Stock investors loved it. Between 1962 and 1966, the Dow Jones industrial average nearly doubled.""https://www.npr.org/2013/11/12/244772593/jfks-lasting-economic-legacy-lower-tax-rates"

"When target turned it's back on it's loyal customer base, I like so many others stopped spending our money there. What I hear on this board is ""until they change there policies I won't go there"". So ....if they do change there policy and get rid of the CEO, are you really going back!.....really? I will not"
arrogant mgmt. has ruined this company.
"with Sears, jcp and others in the mass middle mkt hone, tgt is the best game in town."
The boycott is really hammering Target today. Congratulations to all who continue to shop elsewhere.
"Sarah: Look at the 5 day charts for TGT, KSS, BBY, and even... AMZN. The first 3 show a sharp and large decline at right around 1:15 on Thursday. AMZN is ab it more gradual, but the decline is still there. You actually believe that this is all a result of the so-called ""boycott"" against Target, and that it's just a completely coincidence that this happened at the same time as ""President"" p\/55ygrbbr's ill advised Tweet!?TDS for sure."
"Has anyone noticed the “gay pride” promotion at childrens section at Target? Creepy. After unisex bathrooms that made perverts happy, Target is now promoting homosexuality for our children? That crosses the line. Not that will no longer shop there, I will short the stock."
"Great speech by the President last night. The sour, dour, aging, petulant, angry Democrats just sat on their withered hands and stared with their pinched faces. It'll be great when all these aging socialists die off and make way for a renewed American spirit rededicated to the idea that government is their to serve the people, not the other way around."
"Ive shopped at Target 5 times a week for the last 3 years, living a 1/4 mile away with 4 Target stores in my 10 mile radius... All i can say is this place is top notch & Cornell really knows what he is doing. Its a bull & the consumer is becoming addicted to the Target experience... Walmart is tough, but I think Target is really going to be a thorn in its side & possibly could over-run Walmart. At the 20x multiple there is plenty more room to run & i think it goes to 135 as it chases Walmarts 25x multiple as it respectively deserves -MyOpinion"

"You all crack me up. Say all you want about the price movement but go into a Target and see what’s going on. Ask your friends and family what they think of Target. People love this store. It’s a mom’s happy place. Kids and teens love their clothes and the shopping experience is second to none. They have sat for years priced at a discount to their peers so their time is now. I’ve been buying this stock for two years by what I physically see and hear. When the trend changes, I’ll reconsider but for now, I think this price move is well justified. Long and strong."
When you see stocks like Wmt and Cost appreciate that makes Tgt's value even a better deal at slightly over a pe of 15. Although Tgt's stock price appreciation has slowed down I still believe we head up to $100 by earnings and don't forget the superior dividend.
Apple & Target partnership!!
I am new to stock game. I was just at target and they said they’re down globally and can’t do transactions. Does that mean that their stock will come down Monday and would this be a good time to buy if it does go down in a day or 2?
I told U Boys. This stock is a blockbuster. It's gargantuan. Target stores are great.
When will we hit $65? End of August? Back to school shopping boost am I right?
Up about 2% on the week. All other retail stocks got slammed this afternoon as well. Now we will see if the lower prices drive more traffic and actually increase sales.
"Hey Ark, I couldn't care less about the trades you wish to share with everyone.

Target this weekend. Packed.
about to fill the earnings gap
Buying $182.5 calls.
Don’t expect any big numbers. Amazon and Walmart got a little fatter slice this quarter. Rioting closures and damages will reduce rev and increase costs. Also the increased wages and headcount and hazard bonus. Might get back to 90’s

"Since the shorts/haters like to point out when the market is up and Target is down, would just like to point out Target is up .5% Wednesday and 1.39% today and the Dow was (.5%) Wed and up .85% today. Yeah I know they are meaningless stats, just like how meaningless the comments are when the shorts post them the other way or throw out the ""this things going to be $35 by next week...""Anyway, looks like we are in limbo up or down until Q1 earnings."
M is cheaper
I wonder if Target medical plans pay for sexual change surgery. Could save the military a bunch of money when the changers go to work there instead of enlisting.

Went to my local Target today and the reality is that this virus is creating a Christmas like shopping season that has to translate to stellar numbers for Target next quarter.
I was once a Target customer. The company has a history of supporting liberal causes. I just shrugged it off but their bathroom policy was the final straw. My family has decided to join the boycott. Target has lost their way and thought their progressive policies would have no consequences. They were wrong .
Anyone added additional shares of $TGT at its lowest price during the selloff craziness last week?

"Hey Artie, tell me again how great Target's business model is. Here's my take on the nails in Target's coffin:- no third party marketplace (unlike Walmart and Amazon)- mixing politics with business, showing contempt for its customers- deciding to make urban stores their new focus, driving up brick and mortar costs at a time when those costs are killing all Amazon competitorsThere is NOTHING that I can't buy at Target for less money somewhere else, more easily and cheaply. I have utterly no reason to go to Target, and now myself and millions of other former customers now have a reason NOT to. Will Target collapse soon? No. It takes years to destroy a good company. Ask the dummies who ran Sears into the ground. But Target is well on the way."

"TGT up more than AMZN at the moment, yay. TGT has staying power."
"Good thing for TGT shareholders that Target pays dividends, otherwise you'd be losing 2 percent per year since 2007 because of inflation, inasmuch as share value is unchanged in 12 years."
"btw TGT was upgraded today, it was on my Fidelity news feed. Not that it was a surprise. As far as stock investments go, this is pretty safe."
Target is King. Burger King is King. McDonald's is King. 3 great Corporations. 2 American and 1 Canadian. Any questions?
AMZN beat easily on earnings but revenues was pretty much as projected. WMT & TGT's merchandise is not expensive like the high end department stores. The spread isn't worth it. The deep discounters are safe and the fear unwarranted imo.
"Earnings blowout coming! Living in Minneapolis, I go to Target for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it is always crowded! :) It is literally people's source of entertainment day to day...no joke"
146$ by June my opinion
my job is done here.
WOW. MY LOCAL TARGET IS BUYING. JCP STOCK I TOLD YOU ALL TO BUY JCPWEEKS AGO - ALMOST DOUBLE NOW
"~111, not 100. After taxes. All credit to you Regressive -- what you did just now is what I need you to keep doing and what you'll keep doing pretty much forever it seems. Thank you, we will connect about SQ next week and yes you can ask for unredacted screenshots."
"Brick, NJSep 2016http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/09/12/nj-target-dressing-room-photos-women/"
Dow is up 150+ points and this is still red
why is tgt so volatile the last few days?
"Look at WMT.. many new shareholders are in red. If I didn't sell WMT after Q1 earnings, I'd be in red too... but even then I wouldn't worry as long as I don't need the money for a few years - same goes for TGT shareholders. Actually TGT's earnings were significantly better imo."
Target is up BIG today. It was also up BIG time yesterday. Not bad. Not bad at all. Can i get an amen.
"TGT is behaving the way AMZN did for the three months prior to their earnings call. Traders and short sellers kept selling into strength. There was no faith. Then when the earnings report came out, the stock surged 7%. Can you say ""short squeeze?"" I can sense the same scenario happening here."
"Sarah: If Franklin Graham were to tell you to ""boycott"" Amazon (since they have the same bathroom policy as Target), would you ""obey"" like a good loyal psf-ist? Just wondering."
TGT lines last night was a record at my store
"Actually WMT stock is not a bad investment at 82 but I want to talk about the companies I have taken down with my boycotts. In 2012, I started boycotting Google because of their Legalise Love campaign. Look at where they are now. Bankrupt. Social justice."

"Great earnings and it drops because they needed to spend some money. Profit margins have been great, online sales grew 116%. Buy this dip!!"
Cup handle breakout coming soon and earnings after at end of month wow poised for big gains here!!!!
Why the drop??
Love how stock got upgraded last week with price target of $260!!!!
I think Toys R Us Bankruptcy was the best thing happened to Target.
"Remember me boys telling everyone that this market is all fake, big boys will be having their usual steak and wine for lunch all on us"
Stealth dumping continues.Will Target buy back sharesat your local store merchandise returncounter?
Texas Toast ... is the Catholic school surprised that something like this could happen? Whenever you protest there are usually counter protesters or other groups trying to push their agenda as well. The fact is Trump is the most divisive President I have ever witnessed and perhaps Obama wasn’t too far behind in his agenda. Regardless if you wear a Make America Great Again hat you are basically part of the divisive rhetoric whether you like it or not. Both men stood their ground ... at least nobody got hurt
Tmr is holiday sales
Target reached an all time high at 195.82
Target is finally adopting Apple Pay!
"""of course Trump is a billionaire"" - who needs a payment plan to pay $130k to his attorney? LOL"
"""who's a good baphomet, yous a good baphomet.."" LOLOLOLIt's probably not even that funny to others.. but I don't know why it's so funny to me."
"I'm happy for all the ""loyal target"" customers. Reaping the benefits of the ACTIVE BOYCOTT which forces BIGOTED BATHROOM POLICY AGAINST WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS Target to reduce it's margins and always have sales events after sales events LOL. Has anyone actually read any of the articles conveniently provided by Yahoo? Notice they all have ""thin margins"" mentioned for Target? I guess we'll find out shortly what the results will be for the 4th Quarter LOL."
"Last week I had the pleasure of visiting one of Trump's properties, a high end country club. Let me tell you, that place was impressive. It is probably the nicest country club I have ever been to, and I have seen some of the best. Incredibly well designed, simple yet elegant, perfect architecture, perfect design, everything. It's not hard to understand how this man became a billionaire."
"Dooo yer smell dat dar smoke? It's dem dar shorts gettin burned on SQ! Like, Quarky, who said SQ would fall to ""~40"" this week. He used dat dar Ferengi ray gun to shoot SQ stock price, but it ricor-sheyed and got Quarky in his keister! LOL."
"I don't answer questions that aren't real. Someone who's closely following my comments in other boards should know what I have said here multiple times. If I was holding, I'd be up 10% (annualized return) - so you don't really have a point buddy."
"I bought @ $108 originally, it looked like a good opportunity today to buy more @ $127.49 so I added some more. Looking forward to more growth in the new year."
How about some real Walmart bathroom updates? This woman was DEAD in Walmart in June 2017. She was dead for 3 days in a bathroom while customers shopped. For 3 DAYS.

TOLD YOU SO: JCP hit $1.00 And I gave it to you at $0.51 However. target is going to have some stiff competition when JCPENNY works on a solid turnaround.
"Amazon vehicles more than ups+fdx now,"
Expect TGT to roar back with any weakness. The market maker will not allow the Shorts to win so easily. They will achieve capitulation from the shorts!
I think they are going for an award in most new 52 week lows....
TGT to open store in Disney World with. Disney open store fronts it 40 Target stores. Good day Monday.
once the ETF retail indexes implode this will sink like a rock just like everything else in there -- the love affair with retail will turn once they rediscover the tech stocks-- getting excited about any stock that is in a hot index is a fools errand -- hot money moves like waves--retail always thinks it is different this time or they found the holy grail -- the learning expense here will be costly if you hang on but it can be used as a trading school lesson --how will listen is an IQ test

I made a bey with LO and he died shortly after. Made a bet with DD and it looks like he is gone also. Anyone wanna bet if TGT hits 50 before 60?
Target is so undervalued!! Just bought 1 million more shares in margin!!
"I spent $1500 on amazon today. 2 years ago, target would have been my preferred retailer. The boycott lives"
Some internet certified doctor explaining to me of all people - what retainer fees paid to an attorney covers... now that's really funny. I'm going to just leave it at that.
"It's been an interesting day so far, DD, exploring the incredible delusions of people like Liar Schizo Dave and BigotK. Both of them continue to completely ignore the fact that Target has been a magnet for predators and dozens have been arrested in the last year. So, continued bigotry and contempt for others, nothing new. But today, Liar Schizo Dave reached a new schizophrenia high stating that it was ""completely nutty"" to think that the Clintons have been running an influence peddling scheme! Seriously, you can't buy this kind of entertainment. Scientology has nothing on this cult of tools."
"Dear Target Board of Directors, if you hired me as CEO I could collapse your stock price just as well as Brian Cornell, and for a lot less than the $12 million he earned in the last couple of years. I'd do it for $1 million, even. Thanks for your consideration! Local Owner"
so glad I bought calls yesterday. TGT baby!
analysts expect a decline in earnings for TGT and they expect JCPenny to beat earnings ??? Maybe JP Morgan is hoping to bump TGT up and then sell before earnings. Guess I will just watch this one. A clothing store is going to beat a dept. store including major food. Hmm
100m loss of product just in chicago area
"$80 before Christmas? Vote here..I say yes.One thing's certain, they'll be giving me another Christmas bonus of $.60 per share Dec. 10!"
"Sarah thinks that Target needs to start doing ""peen checks"" for everyone who enters the women's room. I guess s/he thinks that would make everyone more comfortable. ...or maybe s/he wants to get a job doing the checks! ;)"
no Craig it can go up and it WILL genius lol
sarha if your god was real he would hate you. You are truly a disgusting human. That is why you can troll here 7 days a week because even your family dont want to talk to you. They would much rather have you trolling on the computer than actually having to talk to you. I feel sorry for you kids Tim.

Like Ronald Reagan was, after his first term.""I guess I'm not the only person for whom s/he says ""How high?"" when ordered to ""Jump"". ;)""You live in a leftst bubble cult, Artie. You are the one who believes, because you are so told, that men can become women provided the correct verbal incantations and spells are invoked, much like any other pagan. You also believe, without even expressing it I can cofidently predict, that people can make $15 an hour if only similar incantations are invoked, or that health care for everyone and any other good can be confidently assumed to magically appear, market forces be damned, provided that the correct political spells are cast. Amirite?"

He was once one of America’s most charismatic and powerful evangelical leaders, with an audience of more than 30 million people. He even began counseling foreign dignitaries and consulting on a weekly basis with President George W. Bush. Things got rockier when a male sex worker told everyone the pastor had been a regular of his for three years"
Too much support. This is the bottom.
My 100.30 pre market order got filled.. hopefully this is for good $ - good luck and load guys if you want quick $.
Congrats longs. Especially 100 call owners for Friday incredible 6000% gains. I see 4% short interest last reported which is fairly higher than I'd guess. Is this gonna get squeezed more or are they flushed out?
Market euphoria has taken over. Many stocks moving 10% in a week that were written off just months ago. Little fear of loss and only thoughts of missing the gains.
selling at these levels is like selling Amazon at $400 in 2014. don't throw away your money.
"The only thing holding TGT up is Trump's amazing stock market, which is up nearly 40 percent since he took office."
Just loaded up at $174.75! Thanks sellers!
The remodel of my local TGT is almost done and man is it looking good in there. The new Starbucks was finally open and had a line 4 deep at 4:15PM. I dont drink coffee but people are addicted to it like LO is to talking about little girls(shudders). These awesome new remodels and Starbucks combos are going to be a huge hit.
"TGT down 29 percent since December. Congratulations to all those who are participating in the boycott of a company which shows contempt for the rights, beliefs, and safety of its female customers."

PE Ratio of 10 and a 4% dividend coming out of a great holiday season? I will be parking a few thousand shares in Target.
Is anyone else surprised that TGT is at $191 with a relative strength index of 55? Is TGT headed to a quarter grander?

Online sales are very very strong
TGT break it's low for the last year. Haven't been to a Target in months and will continue the boycott. Cornell is a terrible CEO. TGT is currently remodeling the store near me. Cornell is spending millions to remodel a store where the foot traffic is decreasing.
"Stock market up 112 points, Target down 1 buck. Now that's the market action I like.I see that Target is looking to downsize it's stores. I'm all for that - so long as the ultimate goal is to make them and the perverts who run them disappear entirely."
I went to target and That place is humming. You can buy food and everything else. They are getting customers that typically don't shop at target and I think a lot of them will be back. The electricronics section was busy because all the malls are closed.
"Apparently AFA is o.k. if their families get beaten... here is the response I got when asked if they had the boycott ready to sign for United. They just proved to me they are only after Target because they are against gay people.Hello Ryan:Thank you for contacting us. This is really out of the scope of what AFA does. There will be a lawsuit against United Airlines and they will be taken care of through a lawsuit or multiple lawsuits.Thanks,EttaAFA Staff"

"So I see that sarha/Sean/Local Perv is bringing out the capslock to demand that everyone live under the rules s/he wants. I guess those links showing that s/he is a true bigot, against the wishes of the majority of real Americans, against women, and against law enforcement all of whom say that ""bathroom bills"" are useless and discriminatory. Meanwhile, he is also ignoring the fascism from the Trumpzi who wants to ""ban"" the use of certain terms by the CDC. Once again, his/her true colors show through."

Also you know very well that I have been invested in TGT off and on since $50.41 and I have profited more with trades (all live calls, and many with screenshots) than I would have if I kept it from 50.41 to 72.29."

Why is TGT getting whipped today? I can't find any specific news....
Anyone know what time on wed. TGT will announce holiday financials? Bit nervous have about 100 iron condors from 120 to 130 wondering if I can exit my position Tuesday evening or Wed morning I think this will drive TGT to 130+ easy. What y’all think?
Anybody know why the big drop in the last week? Even when the Dow was up TGT still went down.
"I'm worried that Target Corporation hasn't done enough to show contempt for its customers. True, it has decided, without warning, to let any man, sex offender, tranny, or whatever into ladies' rooms, and that's a great start! But the stock is only down 30 percent since that decision, and there's so very far to go until it reaches zero! What else could they do to show their customers that they have no respect for them? How about operating an internship program for pedophiles? NAMBLA recruiting booths? Anybody else have any ideas?"
"Sean, You Think, and Demented Ding Bat are all the same person. Sad looser."

"Third quarter earnings estimates, by yahoo finance, way to high. Turned a deaf ear to the boycott."
The huge drop can be traced back to the very effective boycott. I told you this was going to happen. Long live the boycott
