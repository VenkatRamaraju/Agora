Y'all better cover, because I don't see anywhere else where I get over 7% for a year then 3.5% and 71% of new shares in one of the best streaming companies next year!! Boom keep it coming, I will buy this all day long at these prices!!"

Why are we up today any news?
The stock markets are overpriced and the economy is a disappointment at some point it will catch up and the markets will go down. I am bullish but have real concerns about the economy
"12:32 pm ET May 18, 2021 (Dow Jones).....Should the post-spinoff equity trade for the same annual dividend yield as Verizon Communications' (VZ) current 4.3% -- given a similar leverage and business profile -- it would be worth $186 billion, or about $25.88 per share.....At a Disney-like multiple of 17 times 2023 Ebitda, WarnerMedia/Discovery would have an enterprise value of $221 billion and its equity would be worth $156 billion after subtracting net debt. AT&T shareholders' 71% stake would be worth $110.8 billion, or about $15.40 per current AT&T share ..."
My Analysts and Management team think this deal is very beneficial to Shareholders...Very beneficial
This is a cluster-duck. The two CEO's couldn't even tell us what this merger will be. No wonder the stock has tanked more than 10% and is still dropping. Horrible.
"Down another 5% after hours. Expect another 5% drop in the morning. In other words, we will see 28 tomorrow. God help us."

Inflation coming big time to the USA
"DISCA still has to vote on this, and if they don't approve then we are right back to the DIVY not being cut and will jump back above $32. This will take a year and you peeps freaked out. Wrote and bought back calls. Thanks for the free money."
"Operation Twist -- save cash flow for growth...Moses, 2021"
Don't worry - this will crawl back to $30.50 - just in time for the next ex-div to knock it down to $29.
"Disappointed with T's management through the years. Only manage to get profit by selling covered calls and sell puts to acquire shares back to maintain the total share count. Have sold all the positions that were acquired below the today's price about $29.65 and stop dividend reinvestment. Will exist the positions gradually and rotate to SCHD and other high dividend stocks that have yield above 3%. As for the eventual Time Warner and Discovery shares distribution, only want to own the number one and two in the space with decent multiple, currently only own DIS for longs, NFLX for swing trades only due to high multiple. So will sell the spin off shares and T at the right price. In other words will unwind the whole positions."
"Media assets are the most overvalued of all assets. Every three years, billions in ""value"" are arbitrarily assigned to these ""assets"" when their owners swap them around like now. And yet no one would mention how much they overpaid three years ago."
"T will just pick up more, and more momentum. They will become bigger, and more powerful."
Paid $85 billion. Sold for $45 billion. Cut the dividend.Share holders deserve a public CEO hara kiri.
"they spent $175 billion for these assets and then three years later, they are unwinding those positions for what is kind of in theory, i guess, about $80 billion or so. So they destroyed a ton of value. They do not mention why they did it. Now they dump it after the election while dissing the best president 24/7. They #$%$ all over investors now playing the Humble card. It?s was all about CONTROL"
I’m always searching for something good to say here. Here it is. Buying T now is probably 100 times better than buying an annuity. Especially for your heirs.
"All the negative hype about old CEOs, bad deals and waisted money are so three years ago... Can we just move forward , consolidating was the next logical step regardless of the past mistakes... maybe owning a media company was the path to keeping wireless customers and just, maybe consolidation was the faster path to insure that T kept wireless customers ... I have no idea what the logical thinking has been for the past many years, because the past sure make you think long and hard about the leadership...... However The dividend cut is not a good reason to sell , especially when you’ll be getting .71 shares of the new entity for every T share you own ... Because of the spin off The new entity and T will be able to grow in value because the new entity will be in the top 3 or maybe worse case # 4 streaming companies that people will pay for every money....... Disney, Netflix, Paramount+ and HBO max will lead the way..... be sure of that, And you can expect more consolidation of the streamers... be sure of that too..... When you see a yahoo message board fill up with negative krap the way T board did today, you should be very worried.. The streaming space is too crowded and we need more consolidation IMHO..."

AT&T now is a growth stock... Nice..
Not a good deal for shareholders IMHO43 billion valuation? How much did the last deal cost shareholders?We have massive debt from the last deal.Unless someone can convince me otherwise I will vote no
When T merged with Warner Media they got the assets and did not increase the dividend. So why would they cut the dividend if those same assets are going away again? It’s a move designed to screw the shareholders. The new WM/Discovery will likely not have a dividend.
Well there is one piece of good news this week. I'm going golfing tomorrow and Thursday.
"The spinoff of Warner may result in more long term value to existing ATT shareholders, but I do not think I want to hold on to the resulting new ATT shares. The new ATT will be a pure telco play and VZ may be the better stock if you want to own a telco stock for the dividend. ATT’s fiber to the home network lags behind Verizon’s as a result of decisions made years ago. To save capital and extend the life of their copper network, ATT went with an interim “active” fiber design which utilized more of their imbedded copper network. That design resulted in a lot of electronics in the field requiring power and battery backup. You probably have seen their “graveyards” of large cabinets near many subdivisions. Unfortunately, the capital investment they initially saved utilizing their existing copper for the “last mile” was ultimately squandered on bad acquisitions that lost money (Direct TV and Warner). That interim fiber solution has past it’s useful life and ATT is playing catch up deploying that last mile of fiber. There are still many areas where ATT fiber internet is not available. Verizion went with a “passive” fiber solution from the start, using passive splitters to bring fiber to the home. The initial cost was more than the ATT solution, but they are now in a better position to provide the higher data speeds demanded today. ATT will lag behind on quality internet service until they deploy more fiber in their network."
Down goes Frazier...
Shareholders want Stankey out now. We want a better deal. The whole board slate must go too. REVOLUTION NOW!
Sell this turkey and avoid a dividend cut and big write down of time warner assets in 4 q.
"Yes I would really like the dividend to remain where it is, everyone does. Even if it drops 30 percent, it will still have a higher yield than over 99% of all dividend paying stocks. I hope the price firms up when this is digested by the ""analysts""."
Old T = New T + New CompanyWhy wouldn't the share price of a company drop when it spins off part of its business? What many here seem to ignore is that T shareholders will get shares of the new company.
So the positive spin on all of this is that for every share you get .71 shares of a new streaming entity who is NOT run by the complete knuckleheads who are currently in charge of AT&T. I trust that the new merged company will be managed better and will be successful.
Market started treating T as growth stock.. Not a pure alue/investment . Huge potential for 5G growth. 5G is essential for solid internet connection for devices connected through Internet of Things (IOT)
Not too bad for 7% dividend stock
"The T media spinoff will bring in cash which will lower T debt which is a positive, the new spinoff company is expected to bring in $52 billion annual revenue. Those are positives but how will T continue the $2.08 dividend? Will T stockholders receive a dividend from T 's 71% ownership of the spun off company? If not, will the dividend be cut? Nothing has been said yet."
God why didn’t I sell this morning
Volume is subsiding and should be back to normal early next week now that most yield seeking sellers have left the stock
T is on target to kill nflx and vz. Gonna become a monopoly again soon
"Looks like the DEMS want to tax the Ponzi Scheme stock market, they helped create. The Tax man comes calling for the Capital gains profits."
"So T shareholders will own 100% stake in the new lean and mean A T & T which will focus on 5G, cell phones, internet service and pay a dividend and T shareholders will also receive shares of a new media company with Discovery channels, TNT, HBO, Max, CNN, HGTV, etc. which is supposed to generate $52 billion in revenue and be a third streaming mega company behind Disney and Netflix."
"Ed HammondSun, May 16, 2021, 7:06 AM""(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. is in talks to combine content assets with Discovery Inc. in a deal that could create a entertainment giant to better compete with Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co., people with knowledge of the matter said.""If that deal does go through it could be a pretty big boosts for T. OTOH, it might turn out to be a costly error. Time will tell and the price will be crucial"
Discovery now in the red.
"10,000 dollars in post 84 shares now worth 58,000, however, if you had done a drip your current value would be over 300,000. To the 20 and 30 yr folks out there. Let that be a guide to the value of a good dividend and dividend reinvestment. Makes for a restful nights sleep."
"Dragons coming in 2022! Discovery shareholder are about make out like BANDITS! Dragons, DC superheroes, Harry Potter, HBO Max! Going to be trillion dollar streaming giant, going to get 300 billion out of that Trillion!, total steal!"
Only a 7.5% drop from day’s high with 4X volume.  (144 M shares) “What’s up Doc?” - Warner Bros biggest $ maker Bugs!
Volume has been so low because shares have changed hands in the last year at a price that is worth holding forever. Institutions that want to get a piece will now have to pay up huge to accumulate. This is what happens when you artificially keep a share price low for too long. Never should have let it drop below $40 (5% yield). The games to control price now are a waste of time. The stock will not stop climbing until it hits 4% yield close to $50
"AT&T Inc. is in talks to combine content assets with Discovery Inc., people with knowledge of the matter said."
"Nothing but financial engineering - T effectively pushes its debt load to Newco, passing the ""Highest Debtload Nonbank Company"" crown to Newco, which will inherit $43B of debt right off the bat, in addition to Discovery's debts..."
At this rate of decline the dividend will still be 7% even if the cut the amount in half because the stock price will be $15.
Jim muted!
"READ AND UNDERSTAND !!!!!""AT&T also signaled it will cut its dividend to reflect its smaller size once the media business is carved out into a separate company. ""The dividend cut is not happening until the middle of next year. (4 more quarters of 52 cents per share)"

"Actually, the dividend will not be cut in half. With the stock price collapsing by a large fraction the dividend may actually end up as the same.7% @ 25 equals 5% @ 33.Perspective....."
"as I predicted, nice breakout on heavy volume. Clear path to $40 in the next few weeks/months. No brainer purchase - capital gains + huge dividend."
Pre +1$ pre-market. Hmmmmmm let’s hope it’s all good!!
"Simple math: The difference between what ATT paid for these assets and what they are unwinding them for now is significant and in the wrong direction. All articles are saying quite significant. That difference has got to be made up in the value (i.e. stock price). That is what all this is about - absorbing that loss. The ATT stock price will not quit going down until that loss is fully absorbed. That's how I see it. So far from 33 to 28 X 1.7 billion shares = appx. $8.5 billion of that loss absorbed. We still have a ways to go. I'm of the opinion that our CEO and board could have absorbed these losses slowly and in small amounts over time, but they decided to make the shareholders eat the loss over a very short period of time. Anyway, like it or not, here comes the bitter almond juice - open up."

"TRILLION shares waiting to sell at any rise now, those who bought from close to 34 and down. The weight of these shares wanting out will be hell for T's stock price to push up through."
When the actual dividend cut gets announced and let's say they drop it to 20 cents a share this stock will plummet in a day to the teens and probably hang on at 12 or 13 for a while. I don't see good things ahead.
Holding above 30 so that's something. Divvy solid no chance of a cut right?
"Horrible job numbers...we only missed by 3/4 of a million. Yet, Joe says we're going in the right direction. Spoken like a true socialist.

"For those talking about T’s great future after closing, as a pure telecomm company I don’t see any reason to be happy as long as the same management, John Stankey, keeps running the company. Less than a month ago he misled investors saying that the dividend was safe and he has been behind all major recent failed transactions that have resulted in $billions losses in shareholders value. As Warren Buffet says - “Strong leadership is one of the top 3 things to look for when making an investment decision- an honest and able management to run well the business”. He has failed on both and should be out of T immediately so that credibility can be restored."

"In my opinion, I think the overall company will be worth 60 billion. The issue is turners assets. I think investors will value it at a 12-15 pe because a majority of Warner medias revenue comes from cable services tied to turner cable. They should have bundled turner cable to direct tv. beats me"
Any think with each div. until deal closes there will be a mark to mkt for each div at higher rate in T stock price
12 bucks higher from here and stock price will be where it was 5 years ago.
"As I understand it, the dividend will not be cut. After the spinoff, T will be a smaller company, with obviously a smaller dividend. But shareholders will also get a stake in the new company, that hopefully will grow nicely."
Long term investors areDUMPING.
"RSI = 50.20 - I believe there is a lot of room for this to be called ""oversold"". I would wait until RSI = 30 or below. This means the SP can go down to 25-26 range."

Nice snap back today but I am still not comfortable with this market.There was definitely over a week of Distribution going on before the fall and one positive day does not make a trend
"The strategic partnership between T and newco will remain helping to keep T's churn rates. Discovery looks like a great partner to speed up international roll out with their current distribution connections. Looking forward to the new shares in newco. If executed as planned, it should easily pay off much better than pre spin off. Also appreciate the ability to do as I wish with the two separate businesses as a shareholder."
Can we hold above $32 tomorrow?Low volume today and weakness at today’s close
Hey Stanky! When is your President going to announce the next dividend cut? Seven flipping percent! Nice business plan.
Disney doesn't pay a dividend. Netflix doesn't pay a dividend. At Least with ATT you're still going to get a good 3.58% dividend plus 71% of the new company.
I believe one reason why dropping so much is many didn't know the level of debt this company carries.
Just wait until all these short sellers have to start covering this dividend till the merger takes place. Hopefully we will get further clarity as to what the dividend will actually be and if the new company is paying a dividend and what are both companies growth prospects. Right now the weak hands are falling prey to misinformation.
"This is very bad. As soon as I heard they were going to mess with the Div, See You later. Look at this thing just drop. 24 Years, all that Time and Work to get to benefit from the dividend. What a Sin. Had a bad feeling, out at 33.50."
Easy way to refinance lots of high interest debt with very low interest. Maybe last chance before interest rates start going up! Dividend in T will be adjusted to reflect the new price but won't be reduced. Price might fall a little until people realize what is happening or until T clarifies how this will all happen...
VZ looks a lot better today.
Tlc teality shows + hbo max . Best streaming assets. Best management.
Dividend should be around $1.00 per year from $2.08 today. Also expect T price to go down since some of its current value will be allocated to the spun off business at closing. In theory at closing the value of both businesses should be equal to the value of T the day before the transaction closes.
"This is just gravy for me, I was expecting a fairly good report however it was somewhat better than I expected I'm happy just to collect the dividend with a maintaining the price per share but this was pretty pretty good news. thank God John Stankey has the right people in place and I hope they continue to pay down debt , as they increase their subscriptions and earnings going forward ."
Thanks to whoever sold me 30 more shares at $31.0574... I'll put them to good use.
"""Anonymous"" keeps saying that the information in the 8K is for the new company. No it's not ! It's for the ""new"" AT&T. Here's the 8k. Broadband, 5g.....that's AT&T, not Discoverwhatever !After close and on a pro-forma basis, AT&T expects its remaining assets to produce the following financial trajectory from 2022 to 2024:• Annual revenue growth: low single digits CAGR2• Annual adjusted EBITDA3 and adjusted EPS4 growth: mid-single digits CAGR• Significantly increased financial flexibility to drive returns to shareholders, including:• Expected increased capital investment for incremental investments in 5G and fiber broadband. The company expects annual capital expenditures of around $24 billion once the transaction closes. AT&T expects its 5G C-band network will cover 200 million people in the U.S. by year-end 2023. And the company plans to expand its fiber footprint to cover 30 million customer locations by year-end 2025.• Significant debt reduction: Expect Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA5 in the 2.6x range after transaction closes and less than 2.5x by year end 2023.• Attractive dividend – resized to account for the distribution of WarnerMedia to AT&T shareholders. After close and subject to AT&T Board approval, AT&T expects an annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 43% on anticipated free cash flow1 of $20 billion plus.• The optionality to repurchase shares once Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is less than 2.5x."

Let's see what happens to T's dividend. That is the only reason I owned T to begin with. If the dividend is cut then I might bail.
Ever wish you could be in on the most anticipated streaming IPO ? Then hold your shares
Tanking after hrs
"why nearly 4pc red in AH?If Stankey thought he's creating stockholder value, then he clearly doesn't get it.All we need now is a rev split."
The whole situation is unfortunate. You never cut the dividend unless your back is up against the wall. Everybody is trying to make assumptions what the value of the two entities will be post split up and how to assign a stock price to T now. Bottomline it's under 29 and we have to wait to see where the carnage ends.
This is playing out like GE. History repeats itself. My analysts say 13 pps is probably a buy but recommend going to cash with exception of ExxonMobil.
Did Mr Stankey have anything to say about Cable News Network?

The drop to 29 was pure panic selling dropping 15 percent off it's premarket highs yesterday. A great value for new shareholders buying in. The media made a big deal about the dividend cut and lot of mom and pop investors probably panic sold on the news. No you aren't losing your dividend it will just be lowered to 3.5 percent from 7 percent. In exchange you get issued shares of a new merger company with Discovery and still get to keep your T shares. The combined value of both companies stocks will be more than that 3.5 percent dividend cut. People selling because of the dividend cut are fools. The shares of the new company will have more growth potential in the future and won't have to worry about the dividend preventing them from investing in new IP content for movies and streaming. T investors will still get a stable dividend and a healthier company moving forward to expand their 5G services. The deal is a win win long term as both companies will be able to better expand their own offerings.

"After the deal is completed, I'll keep the DISCA shares and dump the T shares."
Better to roll up the land lines and sell copper.
T could be at $40 by the end of the year. Thats because its now also a growth stock (DISCA).
Congrats longs. Good quarter.
"44 million subs now, surely digging in to Netflix' base."
bulls make money. bears make money. AT&T shareholders get slaughtered is SO TRUE
Reducing my position on T. Absolutely corrupt and inept management... losing more than 80B for recent acquisitions and they are still running the business.
This was a sweet short term deal with long term losses.
"Is there any reason to believe that the current dividend will be reduced until the new company comes into being in mid 2022? I would think it would remain the same until then.I have been trying to figure out how many shares in the new Co. per T share a T shareholder will receive. It depends of course on the capital structure of the new company, namely how many outstanding shares. Currently, DISCA has 500M shares. Assuming that the new Co. retains this capitalization, then T's shareholders will get about 350 M shares (70%) which would be divided among T's 7B shares (0.05 shares). Thus, If I am correct, then each T shareholder would get 1 share of the new Co. for each 20 T shares and current DISCA shareholders would get something like a 1 for 3 reverse split. All this assumes the new Co. keeps its current 500M share count. If the new Co. raises the number of shares to a higher level as is perhaps the most probable thing, then the math would change.Has anyone seen anything on the anticipated share count?"
I see some comments… people are going to realize this is a great deal. The market is saying otherwise. Another 4.25 % down after hours!
See Discovery's CEO will have a compensation tht could be worth $500 million over several years running the combined entities. Doesn't look like anyone thinks about returning value to shareholders. This whole thing smells Stankey.
Will whomever sold me shares in afterhours yesterday at $30.09 please take my trade again? It's not filling today for some reason.
T going back to $40 +

"Read something today in one of the articles, ""HBO Max won't turn a profit until 2025."" It claimed Stankey said that. Don't know if it's true or not."
"Good move but literally everyone in T was in it for the D. 50% cut? Of course we're all gunna bail (as I did, 15% up, I'm v happy). Will we buy back in? Yep. After the dust settles; I'm hoping for $28 or lower. Then I'll gobble it up again. No div change = this puppy would have 'soared' (for T a 5% gain is massive) and stayed up. Not with the div news; no chance it won't continue down for a bit. Anyway, glta..."
The institutions who’ve been playing this buy/write and covered call strat forever will have to surrender now and the stock will be given air to go higher.
When T beat's earnings and pops higher all the dividend option traders are going to be chasing to get back in
"Wouldn’t surprise me to see T trade in a 28.50 to 29.50 range for awhile as dividend-only investors leave and growth/dividend investors buy.In the meantime, we get a nice dividend."
I must say I’m not complaining but I’m somewhat underwhelmed by the price action today.
"T always goes up after earnings. Expectations are low, plus now T has gotten rid of DTV from the books, which will make the financials look a lot better. Should see $32-$33 by early next week."
The BP Apr 30 $24.50 Puts which I sold on Apr 22 for .65 are going to expire tomorrow but I'll probably buy them out tomorrow for .01 in case something weird happens before the end of the day. After that I'll be reselling the $24.50's again but this time the May 28's which were selling for .61 a few minutes ago. My numbers are verifiable on any options screen.
"Just a thought, to make simple let’s say u own 10 shares, n divy cut is even 50% . At split u u lost 10.40 a year in divies but pick up 71% of new company. Unknown how many shares that will be and at what price it would be at. Wouldnt see too far fetched value wb more than $10.40 which is a full year of lost divies"
I haven't heard any solid news regarding a cut in the dividend or sustaining it. Anyone?
Gorgeous short here. Looking for $22
Buying 10000 share lots every time we dip below $31. Hope our Calcs are correct but if not our consolation prize is 6.7% yield.

Most T shareholders are in this stock for the dividend. If the yield drops to 3.7% as indicated by filing estimates of 20Bil cash flow at 40-43% payout. Most will sell to get a higher yield IMO.
the ceo of course he can think it.s ok to lower the dividend he.s a multi millionaire he doesn't have to worry about living.

All this financial wizardary will happen next year. We first have to get through the Indian variant of Covid.
"They're cutting the dividend, which is the only reason to hold the stock. I'm out."
"I do think that fear has taken over and it is not really justified. Yes, the dividend will be cut by about 45%. Shareholders, however, will get 71% of a new media company without charge. So, let's assume you have 10000 shares. Instead of $700 a year in dividends, you may get $350. But, you get shares in the new company. Let's say those shares open on the exchange for $5 per share. You may own 1000 shares of the new company? That's a $5,000 dividend. Of course, this is all speculation and broad assumptions. But, it demonstrates that the dividend goes down but the value is there for shareholders. IF it unlocks value for shareholders, it is a great deal. What have I missed?"
"Two top AT&T executives recently bought shares of the communications giant on the open market. One of the executives CEO John Stankey paid $1 million on May 19 for 34,614 AT&T shares, an average per-share price of $28.81. He made the purchases through a family trust, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. His trust now owns 321,867 AT&T shares....Good to hear a couple top T executives purchasing shares on the open market. Clearly a vote of confidence on the future of the company going forward!!"
"I want to make sure I understand this ""merger"". T ends up with less debt and 71% ownership of ""NewCo"" as it has been dubbed on this board, right? So if NewCo does well, T does well by way of its ownership? When will there be a decision on what T shareholders might receive in the form of NewCo stock?"
"After the CNBC interview with Stankey and Zaslav, companies that bought in this morning have second thoughts and are dumping shares. I was happy with T for less than an hour."
I can't wait to vote against the entire BOD next time I get a chance. Very Stankey indeed!
Do T shareholders get separate shares in the new company?
I sold wll mine after holding for far too long...i have no interest in the “new Netflix”...i’d rather buy Netflix
"Debt will be gone , and $T will be cash cow"
My firm though recommended Selling immediately though..We are not going through GE situation again !!!! We bailed.
"Bottom line, this is a great deal for all the shareholders. I feel bad for the retired people that they have scared into selling their shares cheap. Heck the new stock will be a great dividend payment. Hold your shares people, don't sell them this cheap, you will definitely regret it next year."
SO...AT&T can destroy millions of shareholders value but you cant say FIRE Stankey!!! on Yahoo without your reaction being deleted!!!! Whats wrong with this picture??
AT&T owns a company that lies 24/7 to it's own shareholders.. Fire extinguisher?
I’m out. This is looking very bad. Good luck to all those staying long. Was in at $29 and not giving it all back. Goldman has a $26 target.
"Ok, ready to see $30’s again lol"
Will we gain any shares with the new deal? if so if you own 100 shares how many will you receive.
Just pick up share of T on the dips and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 or any higher price you want for them and sit back and collect the dividends
When shareholders learn the dividend is cut in half this will be in the teens
"Who's been more right about T? I closed out of my position when the stock was $30.93 on 4/7, the day before the ex date, posted here several times that T would likely continue to drop after the ex date, opened a new position yesterday when the stock hit $29.60 and yesterday said we'd probably have a Green day today? My last comment is that the stock usually closes lower 7 days after the ex date than it did on the ex date which would be Monday April 19 in this case. Will it do it again this time, who knows, but I'd be looking for it to close below $30 (closing price on the ex date) at least until April 20."
Bikerguy is right firer the CEO! Can all you guys that think this is a great deal please start buying at the open? So I can sell you my shares!
Longs YOU GET NO SHARES IN NEWCO only T gets the shares so it’s the same as now only you get only half the dividend and management gets a full bonus for 3 years because earnings are adjusted for y tc he spin off
Don't know what T's going to do tomorrow but right now it's Red again after hours.
For the first time in years I am back to NOT hating this company since they are unloading cnn. Will be buying soon
Warners movie trailer for Space Jam featuring Lebron James trending #1 on youtube with Disneys Black Widow behind in 2nd place.
The Knee-jerk reaction is related to the approximately 50% dividend cut. What is left out is that T shareholders will get shares of Discovery which you can hold as a Growth Stock or sell to offset the dividend cut. Discovery is positioned now as a powerhouse with this merger. AT&T is now a pure 5G play and Discovery is now competitive with Netflex & Disney.The selling is somewhat overdone.
Sellers lmao don’t get you’re financial Information on these message boards Long and strong here for 25 years and making 
Finally after five years of ownership breakeven on the stock. Too bad I sold it last year and moved on I replaced it with Nucor. Glad it finally moved up for all you long haulers. I couldn't take the debt anymore
I believe Stankey's days as CEO are numbered.
"Analyst Comments Today: Yahoo FinanceWhy AT&T's stock is getting smashed after mega media deal with DiscoveryBrian SozziBrian Sozzi·Anchor, Editor-at-LargeTue, May 18, 2021, 1:15 PMCMCSA-0.26%T-5.95%T-PA-0.21%T-PC-0.28%+6Wall Street is slicing and dicing the investment thesis on AT&T following its blockbuster sale of WarnerMedia to Discovery on Monday, and is coming to the conclusion there is really no reason to be optimistic on the stock in the medium-term. Shares of the soon-to-be telco plunged as much as 7% in Tuesday trading as investors questioned the long-term outlook for the company. ""For AT&T investors, while we view this transaction, and the February announcement that it would sell DirecTV, as positives, we think it will take time for AT&T to recover. AT&T has lost significant ground in both wireless and fiber broadband as it spent time and money building HBO Max,"" Spartan Capital head of equity research Barry Sine said in a note to clients. Sine also voiced concern about AT&T's governance in light of the WarnerMedia flop.""We note that eight of the 13 board members who went along with both acquisitions are still comfortably ensconced on AT&T’s board. Change apparently came from new CEO John Stankey who evidently tired of trying to defend and manage the telecom/media conglomerate he inherited,"" Sine said.AT&T surprised Wall Street Monday by saying it will spin off its media division WarnerMedia — which is bought for $85 billion just three years ago — and merge it with Discovery. The move joins household name media brands such as WarnerMedia's HBO and CNN with Discovery's HGTV, Animal Planet, Food Network, and TLC under one house."
"FWIW, Argus analyst has a new report out with a buy rating on T and a price target in the $30s. Seems very positive about the reconfiguration of the company.A dividend cut by T would be more palatable if it at least matched VZ's 4.5%."
"The former President tried so hard to save shareholders from this fate by opposing the AT&T/Time Warner merger. Now, the shareholders suffer yet another senseless and merciless BEATING at the hands of this BOD. And....INEXPLICABLY...they continue to vote this same BOD back in. Oh the humanity!!!!"
AT&T investors should track both AT&T and Discovery because they will own 71% of Discovery (Newco). Everyone wins!
I think that T could top $33 this week. Its on an upswing.
CNN BREAKING NEWS: 10 out of 10 AT&T haters are wrong about everything. Turns out lies and spin don't TRUmp facts and truths.
Let’s hope the deal spins off the two to a new company entirely. T shareholder will keep their communication shares and get new shares in the new media giant. That would be AWESOME
"But, but, you all said that T was a safe haven and their dividend was secure. And all you longs all but guaranteed that this would last forever. Remember when you said you'd be passing these shares on to your heirs and that they'd never have to worry about T being a sound or stable investment? Remember when I said, nothing is for sure in the market to which you laughed at me and gave me hundreds of thumbs down for even suggesting such an awful thing? Remember when you said you were proud to be a T shareholder and that the 7% return would last forever? Changed your mind yet???"
"I bought at this level a few months back and sold it at 32.22. I'd love to see this pattern repeat itself. Selling pressure is backing off. Looks like a temper tantrum over the dividend cut and refusing to look at the very positive developments this plan offers, from reducing costs overall by not funding the media assets, to moving forward with the 5G rollout as a smaller, pure communications company. There is so much pessimism now. That's OK. This is when you make the most money."
Over reaction to the dividend cutDISCA will trade at a higher p/eT should trade at VZ p/eDISCA will have growthThis is a good deal for T shareholders

@$25 by next week and final target is $17. Unfortunately a 50% cut in dividend means a 50% cut in price to maintain same %.
should be at new highs here period. Great dividend while you wait.
I don’t know about you guys but my charts show no upward resistance until $38. I see this as a $60 catch up trade by year end.

Craig Moffet is waiting for the perfect time to Twist ATT's Quarterly report as negative and knock the stock back to 30. You can bet on it. The guy makes a living off of trashing T.
Yep - earnings gains half gone in just a couple of days. The other half will be gone by Friday. Then back to $28.50. What a stock indeed!

I do think Stankey will deliver a higher share price ...dividend is super sustainable if share price keeps going up. Let’s get it to 33-35 range
AT&T CEO John Stankey Bought $1 Million of T Shares !YAHOO NEWSGO ................T !
"The CEO of AT&T assured stockholders and the world to rest assured their dividend was extremely safe ,think of the millions of shares bought by institutions and dividend seekers since those fraudulent statements.Buyers since that statement have lost 4 to 5.50$ per share they should find good counsel and sue. As stockholders we should vote out in shame the 8 board of directors who voted to buy Direct and Time Warner .There horrible leadership has cost us shareholders a dividend stock and over 60 billion of capital roughly 30$ per share"
"In exchange for a div cut, you get to own Discovery/CNN shares LOL..."
"Glad I got into T Oct 28, 2020 at the $26 range after the 5 month beat down. No looking back from here. Great performance in 6 months so far!"
"I sold last week at 1250 shares @ $32.08.Bought [I know #$%$..CCL 1560 shares].on a positive note or two.net gain of $4000.And then and then bought 1550 shares of T for 29.15 this morning,$1100 gain so far.I really don't know why,just a hunch.Don't like gambling but there it is.I like ATT but sometimes PFFT"
"My average cost is $36.99, if T ever gets there, I'm out."
two things you can count on-1)slimey CEOs lying about a dividend 2)T falling further tomorrow.

"The dividend reduction announcement was a very “clear negative,” for the stock Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan IV wrote in a Monday afternoon note to clients. The company’s target implies a roughly 45% reduction in AT&T’s dividend relative to current levels, by his math.“This deviates from previous commentary in which we viewed management as the ‘gold standard’ in maintaining the dividend as a sacrosanct tenet of its value proposition to shareholders,” Louthan wrote. “This sudden reversal and about-face from their previous strategy, which was to maintain or grow the dividend at all costs, this betrayal in the eyes of the longtime dividend holders from their previous strategy will likely linger in investors’ minds for many years.”"
"Nice job by Stanky on CNBC. He handled all the questions well, even when they tried to put a negative spin on things. He also would not bite when they tried to introduce politics into the discussion. Well done."

"T is doing good.Wow, the oils are getting hammered and FANG with them. I've got $7.40 in premiums so my cost basis is $72.60 with 10 days to expiration of the Puts. If it keeps dropping I might consider holding the stock and selling covered calls even though I'd rather sell Puts. I do like the oils for the next year ir so. We'll see what happens."

AT&T is doing great. It's a Buying Opportunity for  sure. Great investment with a good Dividend.
To all that have short this for years. Happy new year 
"Some analyst said the Direct TV, Time Warner and now the Discovery deals were all Stanky's idea. Nice to have that much brain power running your company!."
U stock holders will hurt along with the US. Price to pay owning socialist company stock.
"ATT has to cut the total dividend payout for the resulting new ATT. To not do so would be fiscally irresponsible. After spinning off the assets associated with Warner, the new ATT will be substantially smaller with less income. And even though they will be shedding debt, since they are also shedding assets the resulting debt ratio will still be high. But even though the total dividend payout for the new ATT will be less, estimated to be around $8b vs the current $15b, the dividend rate on the new ATT shares may still be high. Unless the new Warner/Discovery pays a dividend, which is unlikely, the total dividend dollars you receive will be less. But you always have to option to sell those Warner/Discovery shares and buy more new ATT shares. So it may be possible to keep your dividend payout and rate near the same. The end result will depend on the valuations the market places on each new share and what the new ATT ultimately decides to pay out."

Looks like maybe 3 or 4 more dividends. Hope it’s 4
"Been long on T. Plus 10k shares. Will watch and see. Cut in the dividend to balance with a stake in the new company. There's spin all around. Holding for at least another 6 months. For dividend players, a dividend index fund may be the safest play but there's still higher reward potential with this deal."
Phuckjng creamer is a day trader! He shorts and talks
"when I sold all my shares this morning for $33.70 per share, was based on 1. over rallied. 2. suspected a dividend cut. 3. Discovery shareholders get to vote on the merger, but not T shareholders. what does that tell you."
"“AT&T has stated that it will change its payout policy to suit the new media industry’s structure. From more than $20 billion in forecasted free cash flow, the corporation estimates a 40 percent to 43 percent annual dividend payout ratio.Last year, the Dallas corporation invested around $15 billion on shareholder payouts, which have long been regarded as a reliable source of income for many small investors.”This seems to indicate to me about a 45% dividend cut. From $15 billion to about $8 billion.Am I missing something or reading this wrong?"
Tax the rich 43% what a pay back idea as most of the super rich support the one party dictatorship now in power.
Why do you guys care about intraday movement so much? This is a fantastic retirement stock that'll make you rich if you hold it for years but who cares if it ends this week at $31 or $32.... No ones gonna sell anytime soon I hope the whole point is to be long on this stock.
We are on fire earnings beat woo! Let’s go AT&T !! 
I like T and I like the Discovery. So I'm holding on and hoping what I might lose in dividend I'll make up in extra shares of the new Discovery.
"What’s with all the crying? T stock has more of a reason to go up with the debt being chopped down - plus we get shares in the new media company being formed, making it the second largest in world behind Disney. Owning this stock will finally pay off other than the div "
"if this breaks 30.1 tomorrow, oh boy. :o"
"To me right now the deal is not clear yet. Lets see if the share holder got hurt, or maybe not. Too many people having different views on what will happen. I'm going to take a wait and see stance."
T’s premarket price is collapsing. T will see red today. Market sees this as a big win fir Disca shareholders and big loss for T shareholders. It is telling that T is not giving assurances to T shareholders about the dividend.
so basically T owns 71% just like in the DirectTV T just collects the checks and others do the work
"Sorry guys but if you’re truly bullish, you’re rooting for this to crash much more. I bought a small position today but the last thing I want is for it to do well ..."
MAYBE T WILL WIN A EMMY!! JUST LIKE THE GOV OF NEW YORK!!
"Street caught off guard by this report, big-time. Suppose we'll see a steady march higher from here. Buy."
The new media company will be sold as soon as it hits the market. APPL or AMZN will be looking to pick up before it sky rockets and they end up paying even more. Watch and learn. This was good deal for shareholders. Not to mention the T 5G and the T cyber security suite that the government will fully support.
T seems like a safe buy now. Who knows but I’m in. Good luck.
"T is going through a large conversion. It has so much going for itself. It is the largest telecom Company in the world with 163 billon in annual sales. It has it's tentacle in so many directions. It pays a great dividends, it's stable. What is not to like?"
Grab 500 shares. This is going to be a great leading player in 5G development in the US

"Obviously the overall market brought T down today, more then the seller’s .. but those who overreacted and sold are going to feel the same way as the people who overreacted sold when Pfizer decided to merge their consumers product with GSK consumer market... Together making the #2 largest OTC consumer company in the world... ￼ yes the T dividend will get cut, just like they are going to do in the Pfizer/GSK merger/spin off.. ...... However within 4-5 years the ATT divi will be back up IMHO..... And the value of the spinoff will also pay a dividend plus you’ll get stock in new entity￼..... AT&T will be in better shape because of this move... so for those of you who overreacted and sold your shares because you disagree with the choice.... good for you and that’s your right...... For those of you who were just short term holders And made some money off today news, good for you too.... but the bottom line is this...the 7% T dividend is intact for at least the next few quarter.... And beside that , if ATT was your only big dividend play in your portfolio, the you weren’t trying very hard... just saying... MPLs and a few ETF are putting ATT dividend to shame when it comes to income and gaining in value compared to T"

Huge sell with the div. cut.
"AT&T is essentially going to offload $43B of debt onto this NewCo (merger of Warner Media and Discovery). Current T shareholders will own 71% of the NewCo and current DISCA shareholders will own 29%. So as shareholders, we now will have the choice whether to own both a telecom and a pure play media company, or both.This move should unlock shareholder value because the NewCo will be valued as a pure play media/streaming giant and should see multiples similar to Netflix. Meanwhile, T (telecom and internet company) will be focus on their legacy business and have more room on the balance sheet (after shedding $43B in debt) to invest in more 5G and Fiber.In my view, the NewCo is going to skyrocket once the market starts valuing it like a growing media/tech company. With the international launch of HBO Max into 39 countries next month and into Europe later this year, I think the bulls will start flooding into T in anticipation of the spinoff so they get their piece of the new company. In 5 years, this new streaming platform could be bigger than Netflix (with much better margins and higher ARPU)."
Sell this quickly...dividend cut coming.
Merger is the best way forward. 2 independent vertically focused companies.I like it is just the shorts and short hedge funds are making a noise.Gl!
This is going to fly higher on Monday and on....

How many people are leaving ATT? How many people are staying in the for long haul?
"Does AT&T issue new shares or not. Reason I ask is, if they don't then the price of shares in circulation will keep going up. Is that true?"
"T is a great company, to invest in at this time. It's business of communication and Media will shine going forward. When you look at the valuations of other companies, T is still a total bargain. I look at the market everyday and see the same stocks being pushed higher and higher, while ignoring the potential gains to be had going forward from companies like T.

VZ has gone up after it ditched aol/yahoo. It's estimated amzn is worth 3x if it was broken up. This new media entity will get a PE close to Netflix and Disney. Second, the new media entity is free to cut deals with other players, while still having preferential ties to T. This is HUGE with digital media. Think of the licensing and ad revenue."

However, it said to not buy T but, rather, wait until the price goes higher and the chart looks even better. WHAT? ARE YOU JOKING? Articles such as this have been saying this since T was in the 26s in November. I am in and holding. Good luck to us."

"Morgan Stanley. “You can call it a cut, or you can call it a re-sizing of the business,” John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, told DealBook. “It’s still a very, very generous dividend.” AT&T’s shares closed down 2.7 percent yesterday, and they’re further in the red in premarket trading today"
Tanking
America Why wasn't one question from the floor asked during the virtual annual meeting about the future of CNN?Were the analysts screened beforehand? Just who has the authority of controlling the news? Why is ATT a partner in this cabal?
why is this falling? to me it sounds like AT&T is now moving forward to the right direction!!!

"T has a good chance for a gamma rally over the next few years. So may stock holders sell covered calls that any rise to $35 and above will trap them. At that point they pray for the stock to drop so they can buy the calls back. But that day doesn't come because nobody is selling the stock. Most have sold covered calls and cant and the new comers are priced at $30 and above and see no need to sell. This is what happened to just about every tech stock last yea\r. I have a friend who bought Zoom at $80 and sold a call for $10 that is now ~$200. She is +34K on the stock, but -33.5K on the calls. She is trapped. And #$%$ at her financial adviser who recommended selling the calls for an extra 8% gain.. I told her not too because stocks with possible catalysts are not good Call candidates. HBOmax is a possible catalyst that could make you regret selling the covered calls. I used to sell them for T, but stopped last year to wait and see how this shakes out. I dont want to see the stock at $45 and yet my calls capped my gain at $32. Selling calls has been a winning strategy for years, but there is a catalyst that could change the game and so I am changing my game as well."

First big dividend cut in how many years again? at least 25 right?
"They don't want to be another World Company under Bernard Ebbers ..MCI WorldCom fiasco. The CEO said we won't go under...We can't! Cancel the Dividend and and Sell everything we can to stay afloat or AT&T will go down like WorldCom, let's be a GE.....They survived!"
Howdy T ! TGIF. Dish is receiving new money in its stock and it’s going much higher things are connecting in its business of 5G and cellular services . Big plates of shrimp  scampi for afternoon and good possibility of scotch
Barclays raises T pt from $31 to $34; Raymond James raises pt from $32 to $33; maintains “outperform” rating. Nice. GLTA longs in this stock/ stay safe.
I for one wish goodbye to Covid however Covid hasn’t said it’s goodbye. Science says it’s coming back with vengeance that’s why it’s all about the vaccine. CDC gambling that lifted mask mandate will encourage more to vaccinate and that’s a bet that will be a costly loss . India & Asia are getting clobbered and were next
"I'm no analyst but the drift I'm sensing from from the bulk of the comments is bad deal for long term share holders who value the present dividend. Without the strong prospect of significant growth and a reduced dividend, what's the point of holding T ?"
Kong still doing good at the box office
"Cramer is not my problem. He lost all credibility, however, when he misrepresented the deal by omitting the fact that T shareholders would get 79% of the new company. If he were a corporate fiduciary, he would be sued. Losing credibility in his job, however, is the equivalent of losing a lawsuit."
"$35 price target, $1.56 in dividends minimum and a golden ticket in newco at end of the rainbow. That’s potentially a 20% return in a year. I am a holder and will be a buyer. Almost forgot - the debt whiners go away."
I noticed funds are buying Discovery but not buying T
"Here's one thing that's unclear to me. Part of the story says this will combine AT&T's ""media assets"" with Discovery's to produce a strong competitor to netflix and disney. But is HBOMAX part of it or not? HBOMAX is sure part of warner's ""media assets"", and without hbomax as part of the deal it would be hard to envision the merged company as a real competitor to netflix and disney. Yet references are only made to cnn, turner, etc., not hbomax. Anyone have additional insight?"
Old good 29 is back :D

"I used to listen to Cramer, but when he proved many times he was wrong in forecasting for the long term, I decided to go it alone and I've been very pleased with my own results."
"I am betting that the NewCo will be a publicly traded company (Time Warner Discovery). T shareholders will get 0.7 shares of Newco for every T share they own.If NewCo has a successfull IPO, they can easily trade at $20. Arbitrageurs like the deal and will take T stock down, so they can harvest more gains next year."
"But isn’t T late to the 5G business already.l? And is anyone with 5G impressed with its performance over 4G? I mean really? If anyone buys that, I’ve got some ocean front property from Arizona and you can see the sea. No dividend. Lots of fish in the pond. Going to swap it out of my portfolio for a new pair of underwear."
If this is such a good deal for shareholders why is the stock tanking ? Milone outsmarted Eliot.
JUST LOOK AT HOW CNN REPORTS THE NEWS!! ENOUGH SAID!!
Elliot now ooen to further spin-off of CNN which would be very positive . I like the idea that John Malone is involved here. The guy is a genius in this area. Sell off overdone.
Sell this $;&&&; urgently….set an alarm at 4am place your sell order and sleep peacefully.
"I sold 1/4 of my position. I have a feeling that they will reduce the dividend prior to the split which could cause an additional negative reaction. They have already taken the hit by basically saying they give up on the Aristrocat status of the shares. My next question is who continues to build, promote and massage HBO MAX subscribers and TW assets in general to the public? Is T funding the entire management and expense? Or is it becoming a Joint Venture until the split?"
33’next Friday
Nice reports can we get a point out of this today?
"Unfortunately current T management has been selling dreams costing billions$ in shareholders’ value decline. For example the TMo merger costing $4 billions in breakage fees, plus billions more in spectrum and free roaming to TMo on T’s network raising a dead company as a formidable competitor in the market. Then the dreams on the DTV acquisition, do you remember when they were saying it was cheaper to provide video thru satellite than thru broadband, another $40 billions lost in shareholder value. Then the TW acquisition, do you remember when they were saying that with that purchase they were going to change the advertising business to targeted advertising so that customer only see advertising relevant to their needs. They even bought another company for billions, created Xandar and did nothing. Have you read the Elliot Management letter on all these management major mistakes. Now we are losing tens of billions billions again and you want us to believe on the dreams of this new company that is going to save us all. It is very simple, there is no credibility on T’s management (i.e., John Stankey) since he was behind all these wrong decisions with Randall and many more outlined in Elliot Management letter who also wanted him out of the Company. He was saved by Covid but he should be out immediately to restore trust and credibility on this company. Or do we want him to retire with millions in stock and pension like Randall for destroying shareholders’ value."
Mark my words...AT&T will own this very platform one day.
"The management team should have waited to announce this merger agreement when they had the new merged company name finalized and the stock ticker symbol it would be trading under, along with the split date of when it would happen. A large part of all this selling pressure is confusion over when all this is going to happen. So with not much else to focus on the media zeroed in on the dividend cut as the biggest news of the merger. Just bad communication from AT&T management. They need to hurry up on the details and release them so they can start pumping the new company. Otherwise the market will keep selling. Market hates uncertainty."
Tha airplane  is ready to take off
"Does this sound like it does not include HBO and Warner? The idea is to combine Discovery’s reality-TV empire with AT&T’s vast media holdings, building a business that would be a formidable competitor to Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co. Any deal would mark a major shift in AT&T’s strategy after years of working to assemble telecommunications and media assets under one roof. AT&T gained some of the biggest brands in entertainment through its acquisition of Time Warner Inc., which was completed in 2018."
Don't get married to a stock. I think you could buy it back around 16 a share but it could go lower. Anyways we feel as long as it doesn't become another WorldCom it may stay at $13 pps
"This is only the beginning, T is about to become a Rocketship! Nobody has realized HBO Max has Amazing content built for worldwide domination! Netflix is kind of like the Lifetime channel these day and has nothing to watch on their platform. Bet on Disney and HBO Max!"
opex Friday close below 32 kills off most of the options! MM's at it gain.
"TMUS debt level is higher than sales with PE of 50...So separate AT&T into two, you will not complain the ""huge"" debt."
Will be red end of day
"Unlikely the new DISCA will pay a divi. NFLX doesn't, neither does FUBO. This is a fight for new content and subscribers. T is loading the new company with debt. Leaves nothing for a dividend. This is starting to dawn on the slower T holders. That is why the premarket is fading."
With Disney subscription down and Netflix subscriptions down that should bode well for T
So many dumpkofs here think they are going to end up with shares in the new company. They are not. The new company shares will go 100% to T and Discovery in the agreed proportions. The new company shares will obviously not be publicly traded.
"I've put in a buy order at 29. Good price to get a year of 6% dividend, then shares of DISCA + T"
"effectively cutting the amount it pays in half, according to Morgan Stanley. “You can call it a cut, or you can call it a re-sizing of the business,” John Stankey, AT&T’s chief executive, told DealBook"
"Think about it millions of people watch Cramer and maybe 25% listen to him and these long time holders of att that’s still holding and he pulls this every chance he gets, who is really hurting att shareholders think about it."
Might need to evaluate execs and board performance and claw back some compensation. Losing billions is never good. A good house cleaning might be in order.
Weak non risk taking investors really show their weakness on days like this. Little divvy cut?? Bailllll. Buy time soon. First time I’ve said that about T in a while.
"Remember NewCo would be a growth company and will not pay dividends. It needs that cash to reduce its $60 billion debt after paying $43 billions to T for WM assets and to produce its own content which is not cheap.Again, when is T’s BOD bringing in a new CEO. They have the fiduciary duty to ensure T is managed by skilled leaders that can execute and increase shareholders value. John Stankey has been responsible for billions in shareholders value losses since he has been at the center of all T major M&A disasters in the last decade (the failed TMo merger, the DTV acquisition and the TW acquisition he recognized this week was a huge mistake with this transaction). To run a pure telecomm business from now on the Board does not need John anymore. There are hundreds of more qualified executives to run T starting tomorrow that can deliver better execution and therefore better stock performance than him. Investors also need someone they can trust, not someone that states that dividends are safe at current levels and in just around 3 weeks turns around and cuts the dividends by 50%. Employees also needs someone who care for their livelihood and that is not John. In a recent article on the meeting John had with WM employees this Tuesday, he was defensive and as an employee noted, there was a failure on his part to appreciate the concerns of employees worried about their livelihoods. It is time for a change in T leadership."
"Stankey literally playing with people's livelihoods & retirement money by cutting the dividend, and people are still confused about how much less their dividend checks will be. Just a HORRIBLE way to socialize the proposed merger/spinoff."
"The value of the stock is not $40 since you need to reduce from T current value the TW assets given away in the spin off. The combined market value of the stocks after a spin off are equal to the market value of the company doing the spin off the day before. Actually based on historical data there are more failures than successes in spin off transactions. At least, we need to be cautious based on the track record of T failed M&A activities during the last decade. In all of them John Stankey was involved in one form or another."
going 25.00
This is the most exciting thing that has happened to ATT.
The most important thing is Zaslav gets control of the board.
I honestly don't understand how anyone can feel comfortable owning T after this latest development.
"NOW THE DIVIDEND WILL NO LONGER HOLD THE PRICE UP ,,, SO NEVER CHASE DIVIDEND STOCKS REMEMBER GE AND JEFFERY IMMELT ..."
Can't Sleep =Tony Orlando and Dawn crank it up ha:)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT5ms2Nvpco
"I set a 31.83 limit buy order for today, guess that’s not going to happen…"
Just a few weeks ago they called us Divy chaseers.
"Look at WFC after its cut.... stock has doubled.. everyone wants cheap shares of the spinoff... THese guys need to talk about what TW is, its not chump change, #1 brand.. which will grow in value and give a solid dividend again... Lets thank T for letting it go on its own...."
Assuming a new dividend of approximately $1.38 I think $25 is about right. T is an old company and there is an expectation of a certain div return.I have been long T since the mid 1980s but I think Im moving on and wish all here the best.
high today was 33.88. wish had sold the news and dumped there.
"In fact, we may hit 45 faster than I expect.."
T up 3.82% What is happening?
Many shorts here lol
Federal Reserve positive statement on share buy backs in the market helps boost the Dow on Friday. T getting lots of positive news.I’m feeling good about T
"Good analysis on the current value of T shares from Barron's. Estimating the value of a slimmed down T, plus the value of shares of newco, It suggests it's the current value of T should be anywhere between $30.37 and $41.28, and therefore, the selling is overdone. Here's more:At a Disney-like multiple of 17 times 2023 Ebitda, WarnerMedia/Discovery would have an enterprise value of $221 billion and its equity would be worth $156 billion after subtracting net debt. AT&T shareholders’ 71% stake would be worth $110.8 billion, or about $15.40 per current AT&T share, if the stock gets the same credit from the market as Disney’s. At an 8.5 times EV/2023 Ebitda ratio in line with ViacomCBS’ and Discovery’s today, the same math yields a value of about $4.49 per share.Add the $25.88 value of AT&T’s telecom businesses, and AT&T stock today could be worth between $30.37 and $41.28—depending on whether investors believe WarnerMedia/Discovery will look more like ViacomCBS or Disney in the future. The reality is likely to be somewhere in between. But after a nearly 10% selloff in the past two days, AT&T stock is trading below both of those values."
I think it’s a good sign the stock held so steady today after the initial sell-off. Nobody want to sit on the sideline when the spin-off comes
2. Sell strategy. Sell T. Put proceeds into VZ. Get 4.33% divvy in a pure play 5g company with a strong balance sheet. T will end up paying a 3% or lower div.
"After months and months of Stankey hyping HBO max, he rids himself of investing in it because he’s cash strapped. Another con man."
You should watch the interview with stankey and zaslav on Bloomberg... Before you panic sell. Just my opinion.
"It's pretty much accepted that T will be valued at $21 a share (after the spin...next year, not now), and $10 will come to shareholders in New company value (again, next year). Simple math says anyone selling for less than $31 is just giving money away. Discovery is going to increase in value, pulling T higher with it. And there's still the dividend. Just can't see T going any lower."
"Pure manipulation, plain-and-simple. Funds aren't set-up yet to allow T to run. T should be trading much closer to $40 than to $30. C'mon Stankey - buy back all the stock you can at these levels!"
Hey Randall.... I hear the Titanic was for sale when the water reached the 2nd funnel. You missed out on that one.
"they cut ur dividends, drove share price to the ground, and ultimately we all know this new project via merger will fail just like they did with WB lol.. get out while u can this going back to $20 due to their dividend cut."
It shows how worthless these media assets are. T can't wait to get out only after three years of bleeding.
"Mr. Market is starting to figure it out. T is undoing past mistakes, namely DirecTV and Warner, covering losses on the former with added value on the latter. Roughly 40% dividend cut is offset by 71% equity in NewCo, with growth potential as cable/satellite TV continues to bleed share to a la carte streaming services. T continues as a cash flow cow, secured by essential 5G and internet services. Sell off is way overdone."
"Wow, down another .40 after hours and still dropping. A lot of people who were at work today don't even know what happened and they won't be getting home from work for another two hours or so. Based on that alone, I would say we should expect more selling tomorrow. We'll see."
Was worried 33 would not hold. Now worried it will close red.
"For those of you who are critical of those who held T for its dividend, instead of its growth, it is worth less today than it was 5 years ago. Shrewd value investing on your part."
this isn't until 2022..LMAO
"T is going to do exactly what Shell did. Announce a cut, run off retirees, bring in a whole new class of investors at a much lower price and then grind up. Not worth it for me."
"such a weird stock. Likes being undervalued, earnings usually disappoint, but spring is adding season so we'll see where she goes"
I rode the Elliot run to the top and sold a few years back. I feel a similar run is coming here. I will not sell for anything less than $39. Long 10k shares.
mark this post. I have been watching t for 20 years. It will end the day at $30. And it will only get worse as the bear market take hold. A retest of $25 is possible.
ATT historically trails VZ by $10. This means ATT is currently undervalued by $16. Only way to go is up for ATT.
I like the deal. Emotional market played Monday morning quarterback and focused on previous bad deals. Watch T bounce back.
"Had T for years, its more of a place to store money until you find a real stock.pays a great div, more than any bank interest."
"For those curious about Cramer's adminant criticism of T after the deal was announced, it can be explained: Cramer is biased, didn't refute the benefits of the deal when posed to him or that it actually makes the most sense for the companies, he just kept deflecting by chirping of the dividend. He never liked this stock and refused to recommend it, until the last earnings when he finally caved in specifically stating the dividend now looked safe..then a few weeks later it gets cut, making him look like a fool. He felt embarrassed, so lashed out like he often does when proven wrong or criticized. He is also invested in and works for their competitor, Comcast, who is hurt a lot by the merger...really limits their ability to compete with...Peacock. Another example...he recently has been on a vendetta against wall st bets for personally attacking him on social media, so every opportunity he gets (even goes out of his way) he will bash on their favorite investments like gamestop, ark investments, crytpo, nft, etc. i like cramer, i don't care for wall st bets, but it is clear he is not always objective."
For those who sold due to dividend cut ... what dividend stock did you get?
"As soon and T make an official announcement of dividend CUT, be ready for another reduction in share price of 26%!!! Ouch"
"Newco trying to borrow $43B to pay T. Basically nothing is accomplished from this deal. Just shuffling debt and TV channels around, and a 50% div cut."
"Hey guys, dividend is safe. Why is it hard to understand that dividend is a combination of cash and newco shares? You still get T dividend cash and a one time newco shares. T dividend is a percentage of FCF both before and after the merger. It is easy to understand, isn't it?"
"people panic a lot, and when they sell it gives the new traders the opportunity, then later on they will be paying high for it from those traders that took the opportunity years ago"
"Hey Jim Cramer, AT&T is taking shares from NFLX... NFLS should be traded at PE of 10"
"The deal has been negatively interpreted due to the initial cost of Time Warner and the dividend cut, but if you take a moment to understand the benefit to the AT&T stockholder and not listen to a really bad MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK like CRAMER, you will realize you will be a winner. Secondly, the investor that doesnt like the dividence cut still has a long way to go and still earn 7% dividend in the meantime. It is a no BRAINER. Wake up and dont listen to the fakes telling you to sell. Thats how they make money. You sell and the shorts are sleeping easy. Wake up!"
FUN FACT: 90% of T shareholders we surveyed will not sell their shares whether the stock goes to $25 or $50. Most state the reason is that they now have yield of 6+%. Market makers are moving the same shares back and forth with no new inventory. Our target is now $60 year end based on lack of available shares.
No one left to sell...going up up up.
"Only reason I invested in this garbage was because of the dividend, completely liquidated my position, goodbye shitstock."
"So Argus, UBS and Barron’s seem to agree there is upside in the two S&P 500 companies currently listed as T. Nice job scaring retail out at a potential bottom Cramer/CNBC. Done with that channel."
"THE TRANSACTION WAS MORE THAN OK, JUST WAIT AND SEE THE $$$ ROLLING IN, AND YOU WILL BE A BELIEVER=THE STOCK MARKET IS IN GENERAL VERY UNDER VALUED."
Maybe we’ll get our dividend increase after all.
"I was tempted to unload my shares which I have been buying over the last 11 years, then I decided not to make any quick decision. Being a grasshopper in the past has cost me a lot of money."
"4pm today, If You want to get in on the May, 3 Div payout, Unless You have Extended Hour Trading Ability, then I believe its 8pm."
They bought discovery for 45 billion discovery makes a profit of 1 billion. This is great for HBO Max but this is costing a lot. If we know about T is there not good at buying company’s . I own shares of this and I can see it at 35 dollars but is this buy good or bad.
T showing the power of multiple revenue streams that T mobile and Verizon don’t have. Look for a huge catch up on the stock price.
What is the best play for us as shareholders? Keep our shares? Sell?
Wells Fargo and Goldman rate T a sell with a $25 and $27 target. This is going to get nasty. Glad to be watching from the sidelines.
Verizon is offering a year free of Discovery + as an incentive. LMAO
What a beautiful stock
Their back !!!!They want your shares for cheap money so they can make huge money over the next seven months
"Dear MSB...... The deal is expected to close in mid-2022..... so why not enjoy the Dividend until then...... However if you sold your shares today, because you believe the dividend is and now cut right now as of the release of the news.... .... sorry... but... wow... if you believe that......... The market is so high right now... And it just boggles the mind to think we’re to put the money that you now have in cash from the sale of ur T shares... .. Holding tight for a few months would have been the right choice .. because maybe you could have sold at $36.00. Instead your money will be making no money in a cash account, until you find a suitable replacement for T...... if your lucky.... even if the ATT dividend was paying 4% today,, that would still be far better then any cash account ..... Anyway board, I hope you did not leave too much money’s on the table, today.... . Good luck message board..."
Sold it all today
I got burned badly by BP & now T CEOs. Its been a rough several months. Bp cuts the dividend by 50% and using the cash to payroll no-ROI green projects. T makes 2 huge media mistakes & again the shareholders are paying for it by a slashed 50% dividend. I should just put it all in FANGS & buy the dips. A lot less stressful.
Going to 13 pps
AT&T $32+ tomorrow
"The board of this company is so incompetent, it’s always looking to acquire assets in order to grow, rather than growing organically. I first thought it was a Stephenson problem ( T-Mobile breakup fee, Direct T V and Time Warner). But now Stankey is getting in on the act too. The problem is that they are buying mules and trying to make them into race horses."
"Look for Stankey and BOD to 'go ahead' now with annual DIV increase, to $2.12, so he can save the 'Dividend Aristocrat' status before the year is over. Some buy backs may be in order also. So glad they dumped Randal the cheer leader."
26+ - 27 is likely where the value is.It might go below due to high volume institutional selling. Retail sales follow later.
Love this deal and price point.
Another T board member is coming up on CNBC. This is absurd that CNBC is giving them so much time.
"The one thing I haven't heard anyone talk about over here yet is ""Reverse Morris Trust"" or ""Anti-Reverse Morris Trust."" I think the company feels like if they don't do something now, TAX implications are going to hurt really bad. So before ""Joe's Dog just Bit me Again"" takes that away from corporate tax liability w the IRS they prob figure now's the better time if any to sell the other company and reward Shareholders by law... Frontier comm did the same thing when they bought assets... FYI"
Nice article in Barron's:TELECOMBARRON'S STOCK PICKReadAT&T’s Next ActThe telecom spent billions on acquisitions while increasing its dividend. Something had to give. The company has a new plan that just might work.
Will they maintain the $.52 dividend in July or will they cut it?
"John Stankey in Barrons interview quotes, ""In terms of how it’s worked out, the enterprise value [of the Time Warner acquisition] in 2018 was about $100 billion. Now there’s $43 billion of cash coming back to AT&T, and the WarnerMedia equity value at the time that we announced the transaction was in the $58 billion range. Plus, we took probably $16 billion of cash out of the media business in the past three years and sold about $5 billion of assets. So, that’s well over the roughly $100 billion that we paid.""For all those criticizing how poor the TW acquisition was, process the numbers before you let your emotions take over your math."
"Now that is what you call unlocking value , The stock drops from $34 to $29.50 that's adding some great value. LOL,LOL,LOL"
"For every $1.00 I have in T, my cost is $.20, after reinvesting dividends and having my DTV stock bought by T. This stock will be like a mini roller coaster, up and down a bit, but gaining in the long end. With the dividend, which will decrease for new buyers as the stock rises, it's best to put it away and forget about it. Pull it out in 5/10/15 years and you'll be pleased. Lots of stocks to play with, but hold onto T."
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS SO WHAT WILL BE THE DVD PER SHARE FOR T SO WE MIGHT GET DISCOVERY STOCK THAT DOES NOT PAY DVDS???????????????/
"Hilarious of this keeps going up, ill sell my T shares and buy more Discovery shares, I do like doubling my money in 1 year :D"
"When is deadline for divy raise so they don’t lose status? I’m thinking they do a small raise to keep it, traditionally they did 1 cent"
Not everyone needs 5G. T should focus on subscribers & let Verizon & T-Mobile fight for 5G customers.
Buying opportunity. If it weren't ex div and if I didn't have too may shares already I'd for sure grab 1-2000 shares.
Lol looking like it might regain losses from yesterday. Quite amazing tbh. People dumping discovery stocks and picking up T or something. Personally I think are overreacting - the spin-off is like a year in the future. A freaking lot can happen to the share price between now and then
I assume we will each receive shares of the new company. Anyone have an idea of what that looks like?
Sue Previous CEO and current CEO for bankrupting this once a great company. Now the dividend is GONE along with Share price never recovered . This share price is same as 20 years ago!!!
"I'm a long-time T investor approaching my mid 70's, IMO things are changing quickly (not for the better), our government is spending money it doesn't have and borrowing money to cover its out-of-control spending practices, proposing to tax the 'people' an exorbitant amount to try and cover its inadequacies and reckless policies.On the other hand, most Americans have become complacent, expecting more, wanting more and not being satisfied with having what they need. The American way is now geared toward 'getting what we want, when we want it', we over-buy, over-indulge, over-spend, and over-extend ourselves, purchasing pretentious $98,000 cars, etc. on credit without blinking an eye or thinking twice. The middle class is fading FAST, the spread between the haves and have nots is rapidly widening, and the homeless population is exploding out of control.We simply can't sustain this Roman Empire mentality much longer, there's some major cracks in the very core of our foundation and inevitably it's going to break, most likely sooner than later, and when it does, it's not going to be pretty. When you have a minute, look up the years leading up to 1929 (the roaring 20's). we're pretty much there again, right now... I'm just an old guy, just sayin'."
"price holding, looks like growth investors are beginning to replace income investors"
You guys are welcome... My 30 share purchase single-handedly prevented a much worse outcome today... https://prnt.sc/12bo00o
On the way to giving back every bit of the earnings pop. This is absolutely absurd! When will ATT ever hold a gain?
"Take your profits or cut your losses while you can. If you’re looking for dividends, get in to PSEC, OXSQ, SLVO. But stay away from this stock with its horrendous management team."
Keep buying this deep guy buy more invest more
which one should i own? at&t or discover for more benefits..thanks advise please.
Great hideout in an overvalued market that should head lower.
Great Divi..its a HOLD for long term income.
Today's action puts selling the May 28 T $32 strike Puts in play. You can sell the May 28 $32's for .55 each and if the stock closes above $32 on May 28 you'll walk away free and clear with the .55 premium. The only caveat is that you'll have to have enough cash in your account to buy the shares if T closes below $32 on May 28.
What happened to the huge sell-off and T going to 15$ LOL
"Stanky grooming the slopes for the downhill race to the bottom, with duct cut."
T now in recovery following oversell from DISCA merger. Buy!
this will be a powerhouse with tons of cash. t shareholders will own 70 percent. the new company will be an attractive target for another company to buy
"I got a question....I have 400 shares of T...Can somebody tell me how much of the new company I am getting? I cant find that number or calculation anywhere...trying to decide if I should stay or sell, so much reading to do.Thanks in advance"
"paid less, investing in growth.. Make sense."
"If you sold earlier, you can add it back slowly if you are concerned."
"I think well see the stock market at 5000 by the end of the year, and T at $30 paying a 7% divvy."
New yield is 4.6% based on today's $30/share. Assuming $1.05 dividend on $22.50 stock price. You have to take $7.50 off the top when the spin-off occurs. The new price for T would be $22.50. People are basing the revised dividend on the full $30 a share which is inaccurate and putting it in the 3's. Amazing how many people don't understand how this works.
target price $22
First STRONG BUY upgrade. Here we go!
I sold all my shares bought apple  I am sure will double in couple a years att will still be at 30 a share in a couple years.
After seeing what these monkeys have done with this company I think it’s time to sell. Highest it will be today is from market open. I’m selling and buying in when it’s lower!
Randall Stephens and John Stankey are will be featured in future Business school classes on how not to run a company. They will be featured in books that teach you how to get a big salary/stock options/pension while doing what ever you want to ruin a company.
Its a stanky face deal for ATT shareholders.
look at that volume. someone is selling hard and others are buying hard too.
how many shares in descovery do t shareholders get say if you own 1000 t shares
"Someone please help set this straight for me. The deal with Discovery is for $43b and for Discovery to assume some debt. Yet I heard some analyst (I believe it was on CNBC, can't recall) that the deal was actually good for AT&T and was really worth closer to $100b with $50b+ in debt savings. So more in line with what AT&T originally paid for TW 3 years ago. I cannot find any article that mentions that. Can someone point me to where it corroborates that?"
"""Quit saying dividend reset"" should read DIVIDEND CUT."
Roll up the land lines and sell copper.
unlock the value.. You got T and a separate media company that could be worth 150B by itself.
John Stankey likes to sandbag expectations. I like that.
I believe it is good news in the long run
sub 28.5 tomorrow premarket. ps markets will be red tomorrow!
"I'm trying to figure out if I am missing something, because as it has been reported so far it seems pretty clear that T shareholders will receive appropriately proportioned amounts of shares representing 71% of the total ownership, so if Netflix is valued at virtually equal to T now, $216 billion with T at $222, so your telling me that we get almost a 71% equivalent % of ownership in shares as I do with T, and newco is gonna be the baddest, most powerful force in media, all the best channels that youtube TV, Comcast, Dish or anyone else relies on, add in HBO Max and WB studios and we've got a one of its kind pure play streaming/content creators out there, they're gonna be easily valued as much as NFLX in no time, newco is clearly way more valuable than NFLX, so we get T shares plus shares that'll probably be worth almost what this T shares are for us now"
I've seen T did this many times. I decided to sell it as soon as it drop below 32. my lose this time is relative small. I will scope a little when it drop under 29 and gradually add more when going down . T will never die - no worry.
"Judging by the reaction this deal got from Cramer I think long term this is a good deal, and will reward the shareholders who are not just here for the dividends. Not worth looking at past mistakes by management, instead look at the potential growth of the spin-off and the core business of T."
the board should be fired
Scandal Randall really did a number on this poor company LoL
"I just turned on CNBC in time to hear that Craig Moffett had downgraded Vz today. Cramer's sidekick, Stephanie link was on the show and said that she had sold VZ and bought T.Maybe Cramer will change his tune."
Value Line said sell T as Amazon looks to buy MGM. Further muddling the Streaming landscape.
"Some debt will be transferred, and we will get shares as far as I understand this:https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/732717/000119312521162721/d176202d8k.htm"
Been a T shareholder for 45 years. Gave my kids a block of T to kickstart them with investing. Sold all T I owned today. A visceral fk #$%$ BoD and CEO.
I?m so glad I sold half my T position which I?ve had for 5 years and bought the so called #$%$ AMC which I am up 100% in 2 months. I wish I sold T at the open today. What a sht show.
"For perspective, the most recent all-time high for AT&T-> stock closing price was 59.19 on July 16, 1999; 22 years ago."
Dividend cut NG!!
How much was stephenson”s severance package? Maybe he could pay back some of the 70 billion dollars of shareholder money he burned up.
Their new ceo has no idea what he is doing. Get him out. Will close at 27 or below.....was 34.88 yesterday. What MISMANAGEMENT
"You better keep buying more , before it too late ya , 170Millon share trade and the market cap is 7.1 billion so 90% of the share hold still holding what are you guys afraid of , better buy more before you regret it , but contracts"
this board is loaded of fortune telling or bashers but I will keep my 50000 shares and enjoy the dividend
GOT prequel started filming!!!!! This will drive subs next year along with a list of other premium series
Cramer is saying the dividend is being cut on CNBC.
Any predictions for tomorrows T opening? Will the news make the stock go up or drop?
"I cut the cord, cut the cable, don't watch sports or CNN. ..... TEN YEARS AGO. ATT management is slow on the uptake."
Short interest...you bet...you lost. See you at $40.
The only question you should ever ask about T is have they made changes to make it an even better in the future than it was and if the answer is yes you buy even more on the dips. All the rest on this board is just noise from people that have no idea what they are doing .
"CNN is the best rated World wide news network and its profitable, unlike Fox News. Besides everyone on TV lies. CNBC has been duping the public about how the stock market is related to the economy for years."
I blame this on Humpty Dumpty Brian stelter
Those buying today will be the first in line to sell tomorrow:-O
What was management trying to do with the acquisition? That concerns me. It sure as hel wasn’t to make money.
Thank you Randy Steven and John Stinky for debt and zero dividend!!!!
ok guys. explain this to me like i am 10 years old. am i going to get shares in this spin off company or what?
"Does golden cross mean anything if you are only looking at a 1-yr chart? or, does it only mean anything if it is a 2 or 5 year chart?"
Colleagues: Is T a good dividend stock? Safe? Good future? Will T benefit from the coming 5G era? I am a retiree living primarily off dividend income. I recently added more T to my portfolio. Any commentary appreciated.
Cheetah using his typea1929 alias to congratulate himself when he actually got called away this morning on the bounce. What a dead. beat.
"I give thanks to the God's of Wall-Street, T closed over 30."
There could be some negative however with the Discovery shares it will be off set. 71% of the new company we own.Gl!
"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., May 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Elliott Investment Management L.P. today released the following statement on behalf of Managing Partner Jesse Cohn and Portfolio Manager Marc Steinberg regarding AT&T’s (NYSE: T) plan to merge media assets with Discovery:“It has been a transformational year at AT&T year since John Stankey took over as CEO, and today’s announcement represents another impressive step in the Company’s recent evolution. AT&T has now executed on its promise to streamline operations and re-focus on its core businesses, all while improving operational execution, enhancing its financial position and advancing its corporate governance. As investors, Elliott supports AT&T in its efforts to best position the company for future success.”"
"How can anyone read this in a regulatory filing and call it a dividend cut. It is amazing. ""an annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 43% on anticipated free cash flow of over $20 billion."" In 2020, AT&T paid out 55% of free cash flow to shareholders as dividends."
"Here go again on Cramer of CNBC ( owns by Comcast). Cramer is employed by CNBC and also owns a smallResearch Investment business. Competitive of AT & T. (T) owns Warner Media, HBO as Comcast owns CNBC, NBC Universal, Film Entertainment.....CRAMER said he would not own AT&T stock this morning....of course....I never trust this CRAMER GUY... and he entertains and advises viewers of CNBC about what stock to buy while he's selling....Do not listen to this guy... He is there for himself, not for investors... Watch out this CRAMER GUY..."
Does anyone know how we get 71% of the new media thing?
"pe of 13, $40"
here we go.. 30 closing.
"I hope that law suits will be filed ,that is why Iam not selling for loss, let the lawyers file class action lawsuit, will not be hard to win, the CEO said Div. will not be effected and few days later said a 50 percent cut in Divendend , that is enough for a law suit right there they flat out lied !"
$29.99 close today? Very likely for $30 options expiration.
Towards $25
So divvy is less than VZ... valuation should be higher than PE of 13..Let us go.
"The key to this deal is AT&T never really kept its promise to reduce debt,so with this deal it can spin alot of it off to the new company. Weather you own the hole pie or 70% of it the debt is not going anywhere your just spreading it around."
With the market and stocks at all time highs there is a lot of comfort in almost 7% forever. Don’t really care what target some random analyst who has an agenda gives it. It’s in my 401k for another 20 years.
"I'm not sure I'm happy about the merger, or know all its implications, but I would have bought T with a 3% div, dunno why people rushing to sell."
streaming business 100B. the rest of business 300B.
"Sell in May and go away (next year), meanwhile, keep the dividend coming."
"How much will you get? it would depend on the value they would place on the new company divided by the number of shares they would create for the new company. Say it ended up 25 bucks per share. Then they would multiply that by the square root of pi, subtract legal fees, and if there's any left, divide that unequally among the T shareholders that are still alive after all the wreck tal damage already inflicted and infected."
Brought to you by the same company that owns CNN. They are Amoral. They do not care about anyone but themselves.
"CNBC projects T's dividend will be reduced to under 5%, similar to VZ. That will kill the stock price even more. I plan on bailing."
"Like I said 6 months ago, Watch the documentary on GE. The same course was followed. Hmmm."
At this rate we will have the first billion of the seven billion outstanding shares sold by early next week
"Seems like shareholders are just frustrated and exhausted with this stock. And understandably so. However, that means it's probably time to buy and Not sell. Fwiw"
Upwards revenue revisions coming... Be nice if they got .84 due to Godzilla and I wonder what they sold chilevison for?
8 AT&T current members of the board of directors voted to buy Direct and Time Warner they have cost the stockholders at least 63 billion $ that’s at least 9$ per share they should be voted off the board
AT&T strategy. Hold. When the deal closes sell the shares you aquire of the new Time Warner company. Put the proceeds into the now pure play T. You will now have more shares of T that pay a lower dividend. But with the added shares you will get similar dividend income. This is golden.
"To all who are upset about the dividend cut, you can thank joe for raising the Corp tax rate and forcing T hand"
"with the dividend cut, in order to have an equivalent yield, price per share needs to go down to 15.43. It's still not a growth company as a stand alone telecom."
"John Stankey bought 1 million dollars of T on the open market. CFO bought 600,000 thousand dollars worth of T"
The future dividend payout for T is disclosed in the 8k they filed today. It is only 40 to 43% of the expected free cash flow of around $20 billion. A simple computation shows it can be $8.6 billion annually or around 50% less than the $16.7 billion dividends paid in 2020. So expect a dividend cut of 50% to around 25 to 26 cents per quarter. It is a shame that in the last earning call couple of weeks ago John Stankey indicated the dividend was secured at current 52 cents per quarter levels and that the issue with the high yield could be solved by simply increasing the stock price. It seems there may be room for legal action for misleading investors on dividend security while at the same time working on a significant dividend reduction.
"It's over Johnny , it's over Johnny ... come back when it's $24 on Friday !"
"KEY POINTSBillionaire John Malone agreed to relinquish his Discovery voting shares to merge the company with WarnerMedia.Malone’s decision is a sign the company is already thinking about future flexibility to sell -- either to another media company or a technology giant.Apple, Amazon and Disney could emerge as future buyers assuming WarnerMedia-Discovery gets regulatory approval."
"Stankey & his management team need to be run off, no excuse for their negligent handling of the business of this company, to the point it's almost criminal."
"When the. Sock reaches 15.00 dollars,and it will I’ll start to nibble again. These managers have whipped out a generation of good will"
"AT&T has higher growth rate on Video streaming than NFLX....Wowser.. Jim Cramer, take that.."
The big winner is Randall and his pension
The combined media company is actually worth a lot if it stands alone..
"CNBC stock manipulator Cramer has been pumping No-Dividend-T-Mobile for awhile; it seems that his ""charitable"" trust owns it and he consistently only talks his book. CNBC should change the name of Squawk on the street to ""Jim Cramer talks his book"". And the evening show to ""Mad Cramer talks his book Again""."
"Not saying I will do this, but one could simply sell shares of the NewCo and buy back T with the proceeds at a much lower price if it keeps sinking. I bet at the end of the day you end up with almost the same quarterly dividend and own a company with lower debt."
$25 seems like a good number
"Keep buying , because if you sell somebody will be playing smart and buying what you are selling"
"Unfortunately ATT has all ""old"" people in Managment, and the ceo has 30 years in the company, so it's going to very difficult to believe that ""revolutionary ideas"" that renovate the company and change the downward trend, will change. The only fresh blood they had is Jason Kilar, and now ATT prefer to put in another lifelong exetuve in charge of the new company. (no bad idea about old people, but they are not as dynamic as younger ones, and ATT need a complete rethinking. Previously it was a ""dividend"" company, now, it won't even be that since they are cutting the dividend in half. Look at T-Mobile's managment and drive as a comparison. They are 1000 times more dynamic than ATT, who is a sitting duck."
Well it was nice while it lasted.
What is CNN lying about today
1. now t can concentrate on growing phone business. 2. now we get new stock in a growing streaming business run by a man who knows his stuff. all in all the future is brighter than it was.
"The deal will provide AT&T with $43 billion in cash and other assets to pay down debt. AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the combined WarnerMedia/Discovery, with Discovery shareholders owning the rest. Discovery CEO David Zaslav will lead the company, and the merger is expected to close in the middle of 2022.AT&T said it would “reset” its dividend as part of the transaction, to a payout ratio of about 40% of free cash flow, which management estimates at least $20 billion in 2023. That means roughly $8 billion in annual payout, or some $1.11 per share (AT&T has about 7.19 billion shares outstanding, per its latest filing). Should the post-spinoff equity trade for the same annual dividend yield as Verizon Communications ’ (VZ) current 4.3%—given a similar leverage and business profile—it would be worth $186 billion, or about $25.88 per share.Several Wall Street analysts did a version of that math this week, and came up with similar values for AT&T’s telecom businesses after spinning off WarnerMedia. Valuing the newly created media company is a tougher task, and depends on investors’ views of its future streaming prowess.Management said Monday that they expect WarnerMedia/Discovery to generate about $13 billion in adjusted Ebitda—short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization—in 2023, and to be levered at 5 times net debt to adjusted Ebitda at closing. That implies about $65 billion of net debt on the new entity.The market ascribes vastly different multiples to streaming winners and legacy media players. Walt Disney (DIS), which has a runaway streaming success in Disney+, trades for 17.3 times its enterprise value to 2023 Ebitda estimate, while streaming pure-play Netflix (NFLX) goes for 22.3 times. Relatively subscale media companies ViacomCBS (VIAC) and premerger Discovery each trade for about 8.5 times their 2023 EV/Ebitda ratio.WarnerMedia/Discovery will bring HBO Max and Discovery+ under one roof, plus a deep library of content from their multiple brands and a combined annual production budget of about $20 billion, per management. But the business today is more of a collection of cable networks and a Hollywood movie studio, with the streaming services not expected to turn a profit for several years.At a Disney-like multiple of 17 times 2023 Ebitda, WarnerMedia/Discovery would have an enterprise value of $221 billion and its equity would be worth $156 billion after subtracting net debt. AT&T shareholders’ 71% stake would be worth $110.8 billion, or about $15.40 per current AT&T share, if the stock gets the same credit from the market as Disney’s. At an 8.5 times EV/2023 Ebitda ratio in line with ViacomCBS’ and Discovery’s today, the same math yields a value of about $4.49 per share.Add the $25.88 value of AT&T’s telecom businesses, and AT&T stock today could be worth between $30.37 and $41.28—depending on whether investors believe WarnerMedia/Discovery will look more like ViacomCBS or Disney in the future. The reality is likely to be somewhere in between. But after a nearly 10% selloff in the past two days, AT&T stock is trading below both of those values."
Check out all the spammers in blue URLs....lol.
Does ex-dividend date mean you get the dividend if you sell tomorrow or today. Does the settle date affect that so selling yesterday meant you were still the holder of record today. I cant figure that settle part out.
"Thanks a lot, Randy, for setting up AT&T to fail investors, employees and customers. Randall's pension is $250K a month. It should be the other way around - He should be paying the Company $250K a month for his brilliant leadership."
Don't Fight the FED. When do the people on CNBC figure that out. FED says Inflation is transitory and it will be so.
"Today may be a good day to write 33 calls, thoughts?"
T stock is 50% under value.. TMUS is 150% over value... what is the average PE of Jim Cramer's stocks...40?
Buy buy buy... All this stuff will happen next year. Long time to go before then. Stock will rise before spinoff.
Cramer is attacking T big time and it is dropping after hours
Giddy up!
Does anyone know what number of shares we will receive in Discovery company when the split occurs ?Do we still keep the same number of T shares that we currently have for the new T company ?
Look at what amazon is paying for stale media assets. T deal in these interest rates is great and will protect you against inflation.
"If I own 1000 shares of T, how many shares of the new company would be distributed to me using today's market prices? Thanks for your help."
Mortal Kombat opens tomorrow and available on HBO Max? Bring it on Netflix.
"T is my biggest safe stock that I use like cash and it won't hurt to the kicker of a 25-75% gain over the next few years. With a 7% dividend you don't have much risk even at $35-$40. After 5 years, the dividends are $12.50, so you have a lot of downside protection even if things go real bad with the economy. I'm very averse to risk given I'm close to retirement and bonds are almost worthless with no inflation protection like a asset rich stock."
Wowser! 29 million shares traded in first half hour.
Bought additional shares early this morning when price dropped over $.20. Stock recovered nicely and extra dividends for me.
"Dividend interest in AT&T is a bond mentality with little thought of the company, but, rather, in squeezing as many dollars into the investors hands. The new deal is good for AT&T. Finally, a growth company in the 21st century ""cloud"" of 5G. T finally........finally.....got it right."
It's 1997 again. Dividend gain only. Zero Cap gain in 24 years. Treat as a zero growth Bond and you will do fine.Growth look at the miners at this juncture.
I have been correcting people saying that T shareholders won’t get any of the New Company stock. It appears I was dead wrong.
Target now $22
"Holy mackerel, the market really hates this deal!"
What gives here?The market sees T as getting the short end of the stick in the deal?
"Super quarter, new subs, tons of max subs. Leaving Verizon in the dust!!"
"Cramer hinted that T could claw back some of Randall Stevenson’s pension If so, please do itHe was the worst ceo in T’s history"
"However, they can be cyclical, and those dividends may be here one day, gone the next. The seven dividend stocks to avoid in your retirement portfolio are unreliable stocks right now, so keep them out of your long-term plans.Boston Properties (NYSE:BXP)PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL)Energy Transfer LP (NYSE:ET)AT&T (NYSE:T)VF Corp (NYSE:VFC)Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR)Lamar Advertising"
"Wow, look at the volume! Over 71 million, average daily volume is 41 million."
Im 68 ...any predictions on when the first div cut will be ?? ..thanks !!
"Now we know why T couldn't get out of it's own way with a near 7% yield. Stankey just through their investor base under the bus with huge dividend cut and now you also own a 3rd rate streaming play. At ATT one lousy management after another. While the market has soared over the last year plus, T can't get out of it's own way and now will trade down. Time for T holders to face reality and move on. T is not a good investment. AS another poster pointed out their acquisitions have been a disaster and have cost shareholder many BILLIONS!"
Whew good thing don't need to worry about any gains from T for taxes... :)
ATT trades at the bequest of opex on Fridays. So will it be 32.50 or 32 today?
"Guys its good to buy AT&T, but buying Discovery will double your money... 29% of 100+b$ is double that of Discovery's current market cap lol"
T ~ mentioned many times T is just not on track anymore not say this GE but certainly it could
This merger will give T more foreign currency exposure which will protect you from the dollar
Typical playbook beat down and then once they believe it is beaten into the ground they will throw in a casual downgrade by one of their friends to further beat it. Then once it is a beaten down horse they jump in like vultures and buy buy buy. It's an easy read now a days.
"I don't really think the debt was an issue. But perception was bad, put into two companies, people wont complain..Look at TMUS, debt is more than sales..."
if you look at the balance sheet of ATT right before the 2017 TW deal it was almost a mirror image of the assets and liabilities(and thus owners equity) after the new deal except for one thing: dilution. ATT carried 6.135 billion shares on the books and will carry about 7.14 billion after the spin off. so is it reasonable to assume that ATT should sell for about 6.135/7.14 X the pre TW merger price + the value of the shares spun off? ATT was selling for about 37 bucks a share (between 35-43) pre 2017 merger so 37x .86= 31.82 plus or minus adjustments for respective market conditions of 2017 and 2021 and then add back the value of the discovery shares gained in the spin off. i do not think people will get as much on the discovery shares as they think from what i have been reading. but i have held on two different spinoffs (pfizer and another one) and came out ahead both times. my feeling is you will do ok with this one if you find a good entry point but be prepared for some dumping by the disappointed dividend crowd.
"Even after the dividend cut, the dividend is still very high compare to other companies. I would hold on to this"
"The USB upgrade has some of the best analysis I have seen. They know what they are talking about. If they upgrade to $35 target, I'd listen to them than Cramer the Clown."
"T shareholders will get 71% of the media merger co. If you are in T for the dividend, you'll be able to sell your stock in the media merge co and use the $ to buy more T, which will still be paying a very nice dividend %."
Wouldn't surprise me to see T in the low 20's by the end of the week.
"Lunch crowd is back, what will they do? Buy or sell?"
"Is the CEO, and BOD taking a 50% pay cut also????"
Cramer should be ashamed of himself. He scared a lot of seniors into panic selling .
"I guess ... Buy Verizon like Garcie and my other buddy did ""bill mddb."" wow"
T to cut dividend 20%
"No hope for a bounce, forget a recovery. Holders got reamed. I am afraid to sell now. God didn't help me."
I heard there will be a dividend cut if a stock holder but did not say how much.
It's in the works that if you are a person of color you will be reimbursed for any losses incurred by owning this stock. It's part of the new social equity plan under the new administration.
"Your management is responsible for the upcoming corporate income tax hike, and the loss of an ADDITIONAL 1/3 of your dividend."
"Concerning executive compensation. This is an article concerning Disney in 2018. Shareholders for Disney also voted down the executive compensation package, much the same as we did for T. The BOD said they would take it under advisement. Makes one wonder WHY we bother to vote at all.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-disney-agm/disney-shareholders-vote-against-ceo-igers-pay-package-idUSKCN1GK2MG"
So... Why did we all Buy Verizon? I just knew something was Brewing1) bc my other Buddies Knew2) My three other Buddies Knew3) Oops a Daisy buy Verizon!?!
"AT&T needs new management. The existing management ran the company in the ground crippling the shareholders. If the current management doesn't change the current stock price may continue to drop until the dividend is 7% again. Elliot Management wanted them all removed, that did not happen and here we are.....Once a dividend aristocrat that shareholders could count on and now a 50% cut. Honestly the existing Executives should just admit they destroyed the company and step down. It's embarrasing, especially when Verizon is in much better shape and T-Mobile is just blown the doors off. They are all in the same business, but AT&T lost its way due to incoherent management. The only news that could help the company at this point would be the announcement of a new outside CEO who could come in and clean house."
We did it. T longs beat off the shorts. Strong divy always wins!
"To those who have all these complicated trade strategies for ATT..... I bought..... a lot..... and held. I just collected over $600 in a dividend and despite selling off after the dividend, it’s now at a 52 week high. I’ll just stay the course....."
The only thing Stankey has done is make AT&T popular on Yahoo's conversation board. In the past AT&T had little to no reactions....now AT&T is lit up with reactions!!!!!
Some kind of Wall Street Voodoo going on for sure: $29.59 for the entire day. Share trading hands between institutions no doubt...
Just wait till Cramer starts bashing this stock right?
T CEO at the White House on Monday to talk w/Biden. T ridiculously cheap on any metric. $40 fair value - with a guaranteed 7% annual yield. No-brainer to pick up more here. We're just starting to open up w/vaccinations skyrocketing.
2 SIMPLE WORDS.......BAGHOLDERAND:
Lol as someone who use to work for the company for 5 years not a surprise it’s terribly managed. I use to show other employees how to move there 401k outta t stock into like LGCAP indexes Garbo company
"Such an easy buy AT&T today. You get great dividend waiting for events (spin-off) to play out. If it goes back down, you just buy some more to average down your price. So little downside."
"I don't care what Cap'n Cramerica says or his fearmongering. He has NEVER liked AT&T since maybe the GHWB admin. Nothing has changed for me. I've been saying that I've been buying under $29. That's still what I'm doing. No matter what Cap'n Cramerica says: at $29 ""A(naco)TT, I buy""."
Homegamers........Tomorrow When This Trades OVER $29.50.....I'm Going To Be Back Saying.......
Going to open $31 tomo big news tomo
"It was embarrassing this week to watch James Cramer become so emotional over AT&T's dividend. I would never hire an investment advisor who used his emotions to buy and sell equities. Cramer took off his cape and showed he's just another talk show host.....an emotional screaming voice show, with adolescent sound effects."
"Karen Finerman of CNBC's FAST MONEY recommended T as her Final Trade today, after they covered T's earnings report during the show. I like her and the others on FAST MONEY more than Cramer. I expect T to be up again tomorrow."
"@researcher. not sure. Need to see the variabilities among the group, then decide which point estimates to select as upper & lower limits. Do you do research ? If so, what field? Statistician ?"
"Analysts hated T before this ER and practically drooled over Verizon & Netflix.Verizon & Netflix disappointed this quarter and T's ER confirmed that their losses were AT&T's gain.I think the sentiment will start to change after today, albeit slowly. If T can continue to execute in the follow on quarters, we likely will get back to $40 by first quarter next year. The fact that the dividend payout is obviously much safer after today will embolden accumulation into retirement accounts and income funds."
"I’m going to start swing trading T soonFirst, I need to see the stock quit making lows for two consecutive days and then I’ll analyze the channel and pick my entry and exit points"
Look at the T well done long T stock
Maybe AT&T (T) trading around 40$ per share the day before EX spin off date.
Buy puts. I bet they are expensive.
NOOOO Should have loaded up on shares! 
"You bid it up 1.70 in the premarket, took it down 2.60 from the high in regular hours and then another 1.34 after hours without any new news from the time of the announcement premarket. I would say that there is not a company issue but rather a fickle, inexperience trader group. The divvy cut will not even occur until the new company starts up next year. no one knows what added value you will get from the new company shares and if they will also have a divvy. Most of you posters sound lime chicken little."
Is CNN's Don Lemon shaking in his loafers?
How much are they cutting the dividend by? Did they say?
today dividend pay day. nice
"I bought more this moring at this price - I like the new Warners/Discovery company, and T owners get 71%. T makes money and even a 4% dividend puts them on par with VZ. So no problems for me."
Get out now by any means!
"To figure out the special dividend per share in dollars use the formula: T stock price * .252. That is what you get per T share in NewCo stock (in dollars, not share count). It's not exact, but pretty close because Warner is 25.2% of T equity and when you calculate everything, the other numbers just drop out of the final answer. Barring anything weird, that formula will work. So $4K worth of T stock will get you about $1K in the stock of the NewCo. It's basically a 1:4 ratio."
Time for yall att dividend investor sell
"I'm bullish. From what I understand is reduction in dividend is a percentage of cash flow, but the deal is meant to increase cash flow, so I don't think the reduction will be as bad as clowns like Cramer, who works for Comcast, are saying. I'm guessing a couple quarters it will be down and then come back as cash flow increases.In the merger Att still owns 71% and I think the content will be better than Disney and Netflix. Disney will put out a 6 episode marvel series and then that's it, it's useless til the next one comes out. Netflix content is just getting redundant. Anything good most likely will be put out through Disney, Universal or Warner. The only thing Warner or Discovery is lacking, is Sports but I think everything else they are as good or better."
"As bad a name as T has, nobody will be rushing in to buy an indebted Telecom with a $ 1 dividend. lol. Nobody with any common sense, that is."
Unloaded 60% at COB yesterday. Rest still in green zone. Will wait patiently till it hits Red zone and buy with both hands**and unload 80% before next ex Div
GE all over again!!!
CNBC just said the dividend will be cut... Any idea's on how much?
"Verizon hiring 1000 in these United States 75 Ohio 75 Mich. Most retail start young wear your ""tie"" == Great company now is the time Verizon c)m to apply also looking for Enterprise engineers. Move up great corp!"
"Losing Kilar is bigger than any dividend cut, imo. Geez - I assumed he would lead this new spinoff company. Now, he's unhappy & wants out?? I have no clue what is going on. This was one of the most poorly communicated proposed deals I can remember. The analyst on PowerLunch, who is in favor, had a hard time explaining it."
Folks all of this is happening in 2022 (next year). Can we get thru the Indian variant of Covid first.
Will probably open at $25 in the morning. Most big pension & mutual funds were caught absolutely flat-footed today. They will all have sell orders in the pre-market. It will be a bloodbath.
So this deal comes with a $1.90 dividend cut? Pretty high
"Hey, AT&T, if you wanted to cut the dividend, you could have just done it. You didn't have to do all of this extra stuff just to try to conceal it."
"Just sit back and relax while collecting an almost 7 percent dividend. 5g rolllout, paying down debt, and Game of Thrones prequel next year puts this stock in the low 40s."
Why would the divi be cut if T owns 71% of DISCA. My guess is this deal is just to paper over the financials and shuffle stuff from one book to another.
"A good 'dip' buy. Sadly, my county taxes are due 6/1 or I'd drop a bundle at low/mid 31 dollar range. And no, no margin buying."
We're heading to $40 folks. HBOMax & 5G revenue will pick up with the re-opening.
Classic OPTION pinning!
TD Ameritrade slacking again as usual... Give me my dividend already...
"Yup, and this Cramer clown will be on tomorrow morning pre-market on CNBC & they'll talk about T for another 30 minutes. He's trying to ""protect"" the T dividend owner & yet all he's doing is piling on."
Still feeling bullish on this stock. It is a very safe investment.
Cramer is a shill bashing T for wanting more growth after being 30-35 for 25 years . The hell with Cramer who by the way is employed by competitor Comcast
T still a great company screw the doubters watch as they regain market share had since 28 and dividend will decrease as share price goes up watch as it climbs so many bears from China trying to hurt America
“Deal expected to close by mid 2022”. LoL
"the div is not being cut this year? no spinoff this year? time to start buying... will be up big once they figure out major players are buying in for growth and not just a dividend... keeping buying for the next year.. As this went down when they bought TW, shouldn't it go up if they are getting rid of it?"
China Joe is doing just what his masters in China told him to do
I'm buying tomorrow! Everything Cramer says do the opposite.
"With the acquisition in the past, debt being paid off, and he dividend safe, it's time to start the march back to $40/share."
rebalance will be happening in my portfolio.
Seems like dividend plays slowly becoming more fashionable. Wonder if it is for downside protection in the high flyers or just Ts potential future with 5G. The big dividend Reits are also up last few days...like NLY. So that may be the answer. Nice to get 7%.
I have thoroughly examined this deal and here is the bottom line; You are getting a slightly lowered dividend Blue Chip ICON and a high potential GROWTH STOCK. Dont look a gift horse in the mouth.T is positioned for high potential with 5G. With the new spin of Discovery is going to be worth significantly more value. The stock was $75 a few months ago. Now with the TWarner its going to be 35% or more in value immediately. This is a very good deal for stock holders. Open up your eyes and stop listening too #$%$ media. Just own it.
"Cheetah My $32 strike calls expire 5/28I got $.62/contract What would you do today, if anyt?"
Sell the news until there's no gains to sell. LMAO.
"So I guess you don’t want to hold shares of both AT&T and Warner+Discovery in the future, where the value of the separatecompanies should be significantly higher than the current value of T. You prefer to have the dividend and a falling stock price?"
"Pretty big issue with my HBO Max. When I stop playing a show, I can’t get to the main screen, and I have to restart the app to to stop casting. Please test your app."
Sold out my position and won't consider buying again until yield is 5% i.e. $22/sh
And also every other stocks cut their dividend in this time. At last you will buy back T (in a higher price)
"was jeff immelt involved in this deal,...................looks like one of his!"
So T drops when they buy a company as well as when they sell the company!!!!!
"Those who complained about lack of price appreciation are now complaining about a potential loss of divided $.Can’t have both, sorry."
HAVE TO KEEP BUYING THESE DIPS for STRONG FUTURE GAINS....AT&T.... and AABB Crypto stock still GREEN.
So what are we going to do about the CNN problem?
Does HBO Max give you all the movies on both HBO & Skinemax....I mean Cinemax.
RIP DIVIDEND. RIP TICKER SYMBOL: T Investors Crying and Selling over Dividend losses
Slow burn that will get an occasional bump from people thinking they are buying in low. 25/share coming.
You know the DirecTV deal won't even close for another 4-5 months.
AT&T always buys high and sells low. It did it with NCR.
"I am NOT normally a day-trader; buy-and-hold has been my mantra for decades. Couldn't resist selling a portion of my T yesterday, when it was inexplicably way up on the news that was really a wash. Then bought back in when it was (again, inexplicably, in my opinion,) down 5% today. Bought 675 shares today with the proceeds from selling 600 shares yesterday. Happy to hold at least until this deal goes through, or doesn't. Can't beat 75 free shares!"
"The way I figure it is if you own 1000 of T now and you get 710 of new company this means a loss of 290 of original bought T. If not , I do not see how T can out and out give 710 shares to T now shareholders when deal is done. That's a lotof money. Can someone clarify this."
Mark my words…. The share price will be back in the 33$ region by next week. I’ve been here for 10 years
This thing is like the titanic now. Dividend cut and still 150 billion in debt after spectrum buy. I am out
"This is Sell and anyone holding will lose..Wordcom ,GE, Enron, Cmgi, Sears,"
"I knew Cramer would do some T-bashing today. He wants to drive the price down, because he loves the widows and orphans so much. Now they can buy more. He really has a bee in his bald bonnet. Maybe the phone company once overcharged him on a bill. While I don't think Stankey and Co. did a very good job announcing this deal, there actually are merits to it. But, yes, Randall Stephenson got paid way too much. Claw it back! Then get back to work. When inflation kicks in, that generous old T dividend won't look as good as shares in Discovery-Warner."
"Guys, there seem to be a number of new names here spreading falsehoods, misinformation and irrational conjecture. Let it be known that what T is doing is to reward shareholders for the lack of credit the media business was getting in the p/e multiple. What they're doing will boost the share price - by how much, we can't tell and will only have to wait for market reaction. But it will go higher and this other nonsense people are posting is being done to mislead. They will push some debt to the new company, how much we don't know yet. T takes no cash out of its coffers. T shareholders get new shares. How much of newco T shareholders will own is tbd. Pls don't be misled."
"Randy got $64 million + retirement package. There is AT&T problem, rewarding failures."
Glad I’m done with this. Going to end RED today. Get out while you can. I’ll go back in if they cancel the deal and support a good divy.
Complete betrayal of the long term investor that just had three years worth of gains wiped clean.
Content is King...T has a GOLD Mine of CONTENT
Coco is going cookout over another dividend #$%$
I'm holding and buying with dividends. AT&T has made a much better deal so why would I sell now. I'll also get shares of Discovery too. Not selling.
"Two days ago commented that I would add to my holdings to capture the current dividend yield through at least end of year. After I came to my senses sold 80% at 31.32 as I realized the dividend could be reduced (or redefined) at any time. You buy shares in a company for a reason. Growth prospects, undervalued price. My reason for owning T as I assume most shareholders have is the dividend. When that reason is pulled out from under you adjustments must be made. Why hang on to 20%? Let’s see where this new vision leads with Discovery. Plenty of other high yield companies to replace my current income.Good luck with your investments, think long term."
Cramer absolutely bashes T management tonight. Not good. Will someone call him out for once??
"ppl selling because they say T is giving up on their component of growth potential are clueless. if you sell your shares, you are the one giving up on the growth potential not just of the Warner media component (if you keep your shares you will still own that growth component), but the telecom/wireless as well, which finally can grow now instead of seeing a stagnant stock price for years on end."
"Say what you want about Cramer, but yesterday 2 board members of ATT sounded like Germans at the Nuremberg trials and Jim almost threw up.."
if interest rates go up the share price will drop
"Nice day for T longs. I had a great day too. Sold a bunch of BP April 30 $24.50 Puts for .65 each and a bigger bunch of FANG (Diamondback Energy) May 21 $75 Puts for 5.00 each. Quite a haul!!Anyway, back to the main issue. Congrats to the T longs."

The spinoff refocuses AT&T on its core U.S.wireless business and on the next-generation wireless services that may be enabled by its5G network. The Discovery deal is a bitter pill for AT&T to swallow after it paid up forthe Time Warner assets; however, it is also probably the right decision as AT&T did nothave the financial firepower to compete in direct-to-consumer video streaming with thelikes of Netflix and Disney, rapidly invest tens of billions into its new 5G network, andprotect the dividend. That said, we still expect a dividend cut at AT&T after thecompletion of the deal (if not before), though management promises the yield will remainhigh. AT&T trades at a modest forward valuation premium to peers."
$50 by end of the week. $100 be year-end. Mark it.
will the 8/3/21 div be for the full 52 cents ? ...thanks !
"On CNBC's Fast Money, Tim Seymour chose T as his ""final trade"" today. Two weeks ago, Karen Finerman then chose T as her final trade on the show. They know something we know. Hint, hint."
Thanks for the cheap shares this week. 
T is having a great day today. $40 by June?
Hope my Pfizer dividend is safe.
Looking like a nice bounce off the 50d MA. Should be just fine running into earnings. Shame they can't do a spinoff of CNN... or sell it to VIAC or Cramer's employer.
They took a huge hit on Warner.
"This is going to be a great deal for the stockholders. Yes the dividend will be cut, but you're going to get a 71% stake in the new company."
Be happy Zaslav is in the mix!Stankey will be gone in 2 years.He's just another relic of the past.
Hey at least mgmt made money. LOTS of money.
"According to Jim Cramer, div cut is coming"
ALERT: soon to declare BANKruptcy!!!!
look who woke up
Stankey lied
"I don't understand this sell off at all. Because of the dividend cut? You can't be serous. A simple breakdown of this deal could be looked at as follows: Discovery is going all in, their stock can be used as a benchmark. T is spinning off and will get 71% (after this I'm using round numbers). T gets $48 bil off their books (this in itself should spike T higher) and gets rid of yet another headache. Now the shares. For simplicity sake, let's break it all up by 5'ths. Discovery is all in, $22 bil (in deal for 1/5), T gets $48 bil in debt off their books for exchange of Warner (2/5). T stockholders get free stock in this new company (now it comes to valuations), call it $120 bil MC (I've heard highs of $150 to lows of $100 bil, this is in the middle) of whats left, call it $50 bil (2/5). With 7 bil shares outstanding in T, that works out to around $8-10 a share. Of course there will be other considerations, so let's call it, conservatively, $5 a share...of free money. Using Discovery common as a benchmark ($30), each share is worth 1/6 of the new company. Or 600 shares of T brings you 100 (free) shares of the new company (that has the potential to be a powerhouse), plus your original T shares (stronger with less debt, a stronger more focused company ready for the 5 G rollout), plus a what, 3-4% dividend in the meantime ...and T is selling off???"
They are working hard at keeping the share price low as they fill some large buy orders but as you can see shareholders are not giving up their shares easily so the price is still going up.
How Stanly had a job and Stephenson had a pension is freaking beyond me! When is the shareholders meeting!? The board should also lose some members!
Very confident in My/Our AT&T Investment....I feel good and so do my Analysts. Let's ride the same wave.
"is it true if you take the number of t shares you own and divide by 6 , that will be roughly the number of shares of new discovery company you will get if you choose to ?"
If Cramer said sell it is time to buy.
.86 cent's... Houston. you are clear for take off....

"Did it just close at high of the day, at 32.42? This is good, right? Hint, hint."
Went golfing today. You guys are doing better. Let's see how long it lasts.
"So more stock dilution for T means more dividend to pay. Stankey is going to cut it and tell you you have more shares in a new venture ""so pipe down, little shareholder."" Bank it."
"This is not what AT&T expected to happen. It will be interesting to see what happens. After lawsuits and this merger not finalizing until next year, there is ZERO reason to buy this right now."
"Just because you wear a suit does not mean you are smart (Former CEO). You NEVER..NEVER take revenues over Debt! NEVER. Hopefully, this new guy knows this and leads T to the promise land. I can tell you this....If I was leading this company it will be over $100 dollars a share right now. T now can pick up where it left off in 2016 at $43 bucks a share..."
"hey cheetah, as long as you torture the board by posting every one of your boring trades, how about you post the principle associated w/ each of your trades. for example, if you're selling covered calls, you can't be naked, so how many shares you hold and how many calls you selling? one for one i presume? same w/ puts. if you're selling, how many? how much cash you reserving to sell those puts?? this is why you're viewed as a deceitful piker. you're either chasing nickels or not conveying how much it actually costs to effectuate your trades. the latter enables people to say ""what is my actual return v. principle and do i really wanna put that much money aside to generate that return?"" absent that, you distort things. i gotta get a life though. i actually spend time writing this to a piker like you. i suppose i do it for people who might want to trade options and who are misled by you."
take the pebble from my hand grasshoppa.....be patient
TProblem here for those of us that want to buy some long term shares is that it's a total Wildcard now. Could bottom near here and head north or could painfully and slowly slide under 20. It's just not investable at this point in the proceedings.
"Looks like ATT made a respectable deal. If they paid $108b (including debt) for Warner Media and gave up a 29% stake for $43b, it looks like the got their investment back plus a 71% stake in Discovery. By cutting the dividend we are sure to see the share price decline as dividend aristocrat funds sell off ATT and retirees dump the stock. But the company may be better off than before and eventually we should see some price recovery. And if the new Warner Media is successful- who know what that will bring. Wish I had sold early today but will probably hang on if it opens below 30."
I sold half at COB to collect some profits. Still in green by a bit on the others. Hoping the market takes it down enough and I will double or triple up again.
Cramer is telling people to SELL and tomorrow it opens below 30 for sure. Sell in the 20s? I guess so. Thanks Cramer.
Payout ratio in high 50s
Weak hands just about shaken out. Just think about everything that could happen between now and June or July of next year. T has 4 quarters of earnings before then. The company is basically unchanged for the next year. The DirecTV deal isn't even closed yet. Gotta keep your cool in this game. In any game really.
T moving like a tech stock! That's right...it is one! Get out of the way...$40 coming through!
Current dividend 7.2% . Enjoy it for the next year................
AT&T has more video streaming user growth than NFLX this year and and next year...This stock is too cheap.
What’s the cents per share for the dividend?
Dividend - Is it Qualified or Ordinary Income?Just received first divy this year so I haven't been through tax season. Can someone tell me how this divy is reported? thx
Up or Down tomorrow? Thumbs up for up and Thumbs down for down.
Never listen to Cramer! He bashed SQ for 2 years after it IPO’d. I made over $350k in 3 years off that gem. Now he praises it...
Volume still running hot but buys coming in higher.
"200,000,000+ shares traded w/ 90 minutes to go. A lot of action!"
LOL I meant to buy $200 worth of TMUS as fractional shares and accidentally bought 200 shares for $25K not realizing till last evening and the fact it was earning after hours. Whup$$
"Coming back, closes at 31"
Never selling. In @$29. A lot of room before I get nervous. Divy will save us.
"I'm not kidding, I prayed. And look."
Down another 1.36 after hours after checking my level 2 screen I found very few buyers and a lot of sellers.The ten thousand share lot I saw suggests fund exiting
Nice Capitulation. Ready for the new hands to stabilize this thing.
"After T crashes, the dividend will be 7% again. Growth investors will buy T hand and foot. So much for value investing."
"TIt's too late. T-Mobile is out of the barn and VZ has sprinted out in front of T. Thanks for the memories, T. Made over 500K in dividends over the years from you and got out juts above breakeven share price."
Shorts seem to have their way with T. Any ideas why?
PT upgraded: * AT&T Inc : Cowen and Company raises target price to $34 from $33 * AT&T Inc : JP Morgan raises price target to $34 from $32 * AT&T Inc : Raymond James raises target price to $33 from $32 * AT&T Inc : UBS raises target price to $32 from $30
Gets down to 15 a share I will jump back in !
Hey guys you will all be the proud owners of DISCA shares in 2022 if all goes well.
Any pop in the share price at the open should be an opportunity to sell. With the dividend cut and big loss in revenue from this deal the stock price will decrease during the day and should end the day deep in the red.
There is a strong chance that AT&T might get the Apple treatment of setting the bar too low and then blowing past the expectations for a steady rise.
"With everything else priced so high, I just don't see how the tide doesn't take this to a 35 range even if temporarily .I would really like to overload on the dips and then cash 80% out near an ex div peak but really hard to time this slow mover."
"T will be flat, if lucky, to down over the next year...until this NEW T is figured out. I hate this stock now."
"All the hate on t for the falling share price over a divy cut for half a company being split, yet verzion falling just as hard with no news"
Homegamers....I Plunked Down $821K Earlier Today ON T !VERY OVERSOLD... 7.25% Divvy For The Next Year ! PLUS......Stock Appreciation !I SAY :
I read that the new company may be worth 152 billion and that AT&T shareholders will get a 71% stake in the new company. AT&T has 1.74 billion shares so is it correct to say that is a $15+ value in the new company per share of AT&T stock held when this closes? I think even with the reduced div this is a good deal for all parties involved.
AT&T surprised to the upside?I must be dreaming.This NEVER happens!
"I'm surprised an analysis hasn't been put forth where it breaks down the business into wireless and communications, media and separate from media, the max product. Give a fair multiple to each of those and see what you get. It's totally fair to do that and I guarantee the multiple would be higher than today. They're getting no credit for max and not enough for warner media."
I voted against this board before this happened yesterday. How dare them take bonuses for themselves. All they do is make poor decisions. We need to get more institutions to fire this board. They need to get successful people on the board.
"This is Elliot Management at its finest. They, and other analysts, having been pounding the table to spin off Time Warner for years. These spinoffs nearly ALWAYS positive for the shareholders. $T will reduce their debt and create a powerhouse streaming service in the process. The timing is perfect as they're coming off an excellent quarter and have their blockbuster movies set to debut this fall (that were pushed back during the pandemic). They also have some of THE best TV series ever and are in talks to develop a Harry Potter series. The new shares could easily triple for $T shareholders."
"k all the speculation about this merger requiring a dividend cut is premature. First off we don't know the price. Next we don't know if there will be a spinoff. Third management surely knows that one of AT&T's greatest assets is its status a s a ""dividend aristocrat"" and endangering that will cause a huge selloff. OTOH a dividend cut is always a possibility and of course there was no annual dividend increase this year for the first time in a very long time."
I bought that dip
"Census by Mark, everyone agrees: Cramer=CON MAN!"
T will be a $40 + dollar stock. The usual suspects want you to sell. The shorts are starting their disinformation campaign.
The stock went down today because the arbitrageurs know a good deal and want to take down the price so they can buy in at a lower price and make 30-40% in the next year.
Buying at $18 so the yield will be comparable
"Cramer is such a corporate b!$-&h. This ATT/Discovery merger is bad for Comcast so he's been #$%$ on it all morning. You can practically hear the producers in his ear telling him what to say (""more!, more!, more, dividend!...dividend, bad!, bad!""). Its so obvious and corrupt. CNBC is essentially PR for hedges and its parent company. They're reducing the debt and ATT shareholders get 71% ownership! The growth of both companies is gonna outstanding!"
AT&T is up 4.92% to 31.59
Decision time. Hold as a growth stock or sell due to reduced dividend. Hmmm..
75 cents more and we have a new 52 week high.
Stankey doing a great job
"My 14 year old stated, and I quote “ if Panera would go public I would buy it faster than Nancy Pelosi bought $rblx, she is rotten to the core along with the others who bought during the pandemic for gains.” He is wise beyond his years and I’ve taught him well."
great dividend I buy some more.
"Unbelievable, we will found ourselves at 25$...."
The street likes it!
Is their secondary coming out at $25?
Watching rush hour on HBO
For those dumping because of dividend. What stocks are you buying to replace T? 3.5 percent is better than most stocks already. I'm genuinely curious.
"The company just can't ever get it right. They're a phone company, should have stuck to that business. Cutting the dividend was the stupidest decision they could ever have made. ATT sole existance as a viable business and investment revolved around its dividend, which up until yesterday was seen as nearly as reliable as a T-bill. Watch T plumment now, it's all downhill from here. Tragic."
"No reason to be precipitous. Until the merger is effected in 2022 or the first half of 2023, T will still be paying the dividend and who knows what might transpire in the interim; e.g., the deal still has to pass muster with the antitrust div. of the Justice Dept and the FTC (it's a horizontal merger unlike T's purchase of Warner, which was a vertical combination) or a white knight might come along and make a play for Discovery. The old saw: It ain't over till it's over."
Grandpa. it is time to hand AT&T over to new generation!
"Well, all of that promise of good things to come sure fizzled out pretty quickly."
"Cheetah, need your advice, if u can make money on AT&T without a lot of risk, I want to talk with u. I have a lot of cash just sitting in bank but with obama2.0, I do not know what to do with the money. I think things will get bad."
"Announced a cut in Dividend , dropping like a rock, this is a div. stock not a growth stock, do you think that is the problem ?"
29 end of week. it always follows this pattern.
John Stankey: Are you taking a pay cut amid your restructuring? Are you applying a 10-25 percent officer/director and senior staff pay cut to adjust your bottom line along with your dividend cut? I am sure your board of directors are not along with you. I am 100% confident you will not ever see this message but you are greed monger along with your staff. Very happy to say that I am a Verizon subscriber and share holder.
"When they all merge, What will the new company be called?"
"Remember, the more the stock falls the greater the dividend percent based on $1.11 a share."
"It would be helpful to get a general idea what owning a share of T today will translate into when the deal closes. All the talk is about the divy cut, what about the new values."
The new company expects to have more than $20 billion in free cash flow to spend on content (and dividends).
"As FAT CAT said, MORE Channels does not matter......it has 100s of channels but too many commercials.usually for a cable, it takes 5 hours to watch movie like harry potter with all the commercial in between and how many times can you watch Harry Potter???"
"It’s always fun to guess what will happen. My first thought is a spin off would be the best for current shareholders. I’m assuming that T media assets are worth a lot more than Discovery. I wouldn’t mind owning part of a new “media powerhouse”. Often when a spin off like this occurs, the debt is also moved to the new company. The dividend would be safe. Given that Discovery shareholders would benefit, this has the potential to be a brilliant move."
TMUS debt to sales ratio is over 1.4. PE is 50..T should be $60
Barron's just came out with an analysis which values AT&T stock between $30.37 and $41.28—depending on whether investors believe WarnerMedia/Discovery will look more like ViacomCBS or Disney in the future. This doesn't include the dividends you'll receive prior to closing.
"This will pay off in the end. I'm willing to endure the pain for the prize, a world class Netflix competitor."
T investors are asking how many shares would they receive from the spin off transaction. Well that depends to some extend on how many shares are issued by NewCo. What we know is that T shareholders will receive 71% interest in NewCo and Disca shareholder shareholders 29%. But keep in mind that there are significantly less Disca shares o/s than T shares. Disca o/s are around 489M compared to the 7B+ o/s shares in T. So because of that and the interest already allocated in NewCo (29% for Disca and 71% for T shareholders) there is more value per Disca share in NewCo than per T share. Simple math shows that based on these facts each Disca shareholder should receive around 6 shares in NewCo for every share 1 share receive by each T shareholder. Not bad for Disca shareholders so not sure if all their recent Class Action Suits on this transaction have any merit. Disca shareholders appear to be in a great position with higher interest per share in NewCo world class assets than T shareholders that will lost around 50% of their dividend plus a decline in T stock price equivalent to the spun off assets receive when the transaction close.
I think this is a plan to drive out T shareholders. A lot of investors bought T when it was $28 and below. Many locked in 7.5%+ divy. In the eyes of the super wealthy that is too much.
Some guy posted this morning that T has a lot of goodwill and now Cheetah is acting like he’s bringing the news to the board.
I guess you shouldn’t tell the market how much money you threw away
Every Fund is trying to get out but slowly getting out... it's heading to 13..Maybe lower
ya every analysis said buy T if your looking for dividend. just proves how much they know.
"If T came out and said they’re undoing this deal, the stock would still go down. If apple announced it was buying Warner for 100 bill in cash, it would go down. it’s cursed."
Honeydicked point blank period. Management announced the deal and slides in a “oh yeah the dividend probably will be cut” im out for now until they say more about the dividend
I see 12-15 on this.
"No one can destroy share holder value like T management, No one!"
"I am sure that if T begins to do well the new medium price will be in the $45.00 area, and the dividend will slowly come back. For now I will hold, and keep my eyes open."
"""AT&T also signaled it will cut its dividend to reflect its smaller size once the media business is carved out into a separate company. The Dallas company said it expects an annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 43% from more than $20 billion of expected free cash flow, implying a total payout of between $8 billion and $8.6 billion. That payment to shareholders would amount to a little over half what investors have collected from the media and telecom conglomerate in past years.""------- Wall Street Journal"
i am looking at buying more shares of Pfizer with T sale. over the years Pfizer has treated me well and now the div are a little better than T
"Regardless if you think this deal has merit or not, Stankey deserves an 'F' on how this deal was communicated. People & analysts today still dont know whats going on. They're selling because of the uncertainty & everyone else is selling."
"A share holder of T since the Bell South Merger, I have seen bad merger after bad merger, and I have no doubt this is another one,,,,"
I enjoy reading the guess's on their intent. But facts are most people owned T for the dividend. Period. And they have not addressed any dividend with the new company X. However any simple DD clearly shows DISCA has never paid one single penny in dividends.
"T is worthless company it has done nothing for 20 plus years but a div & nowcut the div ""told cut in div is very good"" 7% is better than 4%"
T is the king of bad decisions one after another.
T mobile. PE 59X next year. AT&T 10X next year. AT&T to $150. I’ll settle for a target of $75
a major transfer of ownership. 206000000 shares so far today?
this stock not only has no growth it has negative growth from piling on debt then divesting their acquisitions at a lower price than they paid
Should be interesting to see what happens with this:AT&T shareholders vote against approving executive compensationBY Reuters— 10:55 AM ET 04/30/2021
Kevin O'Leary (Mr. Wonderful) would take AT&T out behind the barn.
"for all of you who have not idea what this deal really is and how it adds value, welcome to the club.We just had a lesson as to how Wall Street deal makers create value for shareholders."
"continuing to maintain a very, very hearty and healthy dividend"
CRAMER WILL SAY IMHO DON'T BUY AND MOST INVESTORS WERE ONLY IN IT FOR THE DIVIDEND INCOME!!
Ramers article was a nice hit job on T! I’ll ignore it.
"I estimate the dividend will be 0.28 to 0.35 to start..But T with the ball and chain gone with grow fast and furious...should be in the upper $40's fairly quick...and they should grow the dividend too. Just be glad the former ""suit"" is gone."
Next month HBO MAX is having an ad supported subscription. Should see a bump in the stock by then.
I’m not going to lie to you I am probably going to be adding more the next couple of days great opportunity divided should have been. Cut years ago
"Some us remember the whole Blockbuster drama... Remember back in the day, when Blockbuster was the largest video rental empire in the USA... And some how the leadership made one dumb decision after another and started dragging Blockbuster into a big hole... And no one running Blockbuster was even willing to admit any mistakes... Ironically Dish TV purchase Blockbuster for pennies on the dollar and became the last of the dummies to own Blockbuster.. short of it, was, DishTV, had no success bringing Blockbuster back to life.. Thus giving way to Netflix video rental to become the video rental champion of the USA....then off the back of that.... Netflix became the streaming Giant that it is today... So T has made errors and one can only hope that this consolidation is the key... The streaming space is only big enough for maybe five or even 4 major player.... after that , anything bigger then 5 streamers is too much capacity for a house hold budget.... And the rest will be low level players or forced out, unless they become consolidation, by the major players... And this is very likely .... so you may not like the T deal not but it’s the best route to keep Time Warner in the Top 5 streaming companies.... So as a passive investor I believe, we will see the benefits from this spin off... because T is willing to do something now instead of later, thus avoiding the same fate the befelt poor dead Blockbuster..."
The volume is clear. No sellers. And why would you sell. No where else to put money and get 6+% taxed as a dividend. Don’t see much of a decision until we hit $50
T is GOING BACK TO ITS ROOTS...the 20s.
"Since yesterday’s high was the 52 week high, unless you got in at the top, most of the folks should not be sold at a loss. I got Instagram 28.85, earned three dividends, and sold all at 31.88 yesterday. Wish I saw the dividend cut news earlier."
"If you buy shares today you'll still get the 6% divy until the deal closes. Once the deal closes you'll get a 4% divy & shares of the combined company. Buying ""T"" at these prices looks like a good play.I think you're seeing some arbitrage playing out where hedges went long T & short DISCA."
TSo discovery is now is somehow a great acqusition for T after it collapses due to poor earnings? BrillianT. smh
OMG. 50% dividend #$%$ Are you kidding me. This has to be a joke. Nobody will hold this stock for 3%. Insanity. I?m out!!!!
Any way you look at this......... it is good for ATT. Lower debt & 71% of a new company that should have a higher valuation than now. Dividend should be maintained one way of the other. New management is doing great things to ATT healthy again.
What would the price be of a comparable streaming stock we be getting with the trade
Stock price down 10% since announced deal and cutting dividend. Great job…
The market is in a distribution phase with most stocks being moved up only to be sold the next day moving them back down.This is not the case with T our Fund friends are back again accumulating when they finally fill all of their big orders they will let it run up to $40 again
This is unreal. The dividend cut will push this down for several days while the income investors exit. Stinky said the divvy was safe. When leadership lies it’s time to get out
Did somebody change their opinion on telephone sure trades that way if anyone knows please post either way it makes longs happy￼￼
"Think of T with less debt (stock price will likely go up + the dividend is more secure). Then T shareholders will get shares in the new company. In the end T shareholders make money. Given that John Malone is involved with this, I would think this is a done deal."
"Well, I know where my tax loss will come from to offset Joe's capital gains tax hike!"
All the bashers i am going to buy at $ 20 not me buying at $18 well your not buying lol
Do i as a shareholder of T get any shares of the new company?
"Either Yahoo or Cramer is flat out misrepresenting the facts of this deal:“ AT&T shareholders depend on that dividend for income, and are among the most loyal shareholders you'll find. But after buying Time Warner for $85 billion, Stankey and Stephenson have no accountability for jettisoning Warner for a paltry $43 billion just three years later.”Paltry $43 billion is a lie. That is the debt relief to T. Shareholders get specific n off to them WarnerDiscovery which Stankey says is worth $58 billion. Whatever the value is must be added to the $43 billion as the total return.This deal is too simple for such an outrageous misrepresentation.I wonder what the legal ramifications are if they don’t correct it. Just wondering…."
Just on CNBC...Craig Moffitt....Divy cut destroyed the value play...Sell rating and $24 price target
"Without Direct tv drag, HBO max liftoff, and 5G the next level of resistance is $39. Should close the pocket quickly as institutional investors scramble to add shares."
Hollywood insiders are rumoring Comcast NBCUNIVERSAL could in the future buy the new company
"You know, I thought long and hard about it. Maybe I will stick around to see the mess."
"Some buying. Looks like panic emotional selling is over. Will probably still have some selling pressure as dividend investors sell and growth investors buy.The resulting deal will be a value/growth combo that pure dividend investors may not like. Frankly, a 3.5 to 4.5 dividend is fine with me if coupled with a “free” growth play."
Do T shareholders get shares of the new entity?
Not being neg (or positive at this point) but believe we will see a good sized drop in near term w divy cut as many income folks flee and this develops into a more of a growth vs income play. Need to find some time to crunch some numbers before I decide next steps
I would read on this board about investors of a certain age thinking this was the place to have your money to collect the nice dividend. Now thanks to the reckless management many of those people have lost $$$ but also seen their dividend cut. It’s sad to think while those people suffer management will walk out of this without any hurt. Shameful.
Bye-bye dividend they just announced they’re cutting their dividend.
"I generally don't adhere to anything Cramer puts out, but this caught my eye.https://realmoney.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer--15657251?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO"

"My biggest mistake ever, not selling this morning. My second ever might come tomorrow."
At least if they cut the dividend this garbage company can finally start paying down its debts. Although they will probably use the extra money for bonuses to the ceo like they did when the old ceo left after ruining the company.
"I’m still very confused about this deal. Does AT&T still own the likes of HBO, CNN, TNT, etc. or not?"
"NFLX market cap higher than T with less than 10% of the revenue and real value. HAHAHA!T is a bargain! Hey NFLX investors, come park your money here!!!"
Debt is not in issue in the future. Divvy is not too high to be concerned. This should push the stock valuation...
"Inflation is Transitory. I wouldn't worry about it. After a couple of months, people will start talking DEFLATION again."
"IMO: Not a great move for $T as the majority of their investors are here for the dividend and/or HBO Max narrative. Now that the former is threatened and the latter is being divested into a new company, why would these investors want to own $T proper? Canadian telecoms, like Telus, are much more attractive than their US counterparts. Full disclosure: Exited my position as soon as I read the news (for an easy 18% since last November) for Telus and will likely look to re-enter a swing trading position during fallout once a dividend reduction/cut is announced."
This is the last we'll hear from Stankey in weeks at least. Has the communication skills and personality of a rock.
Terrible news for divy retirees. Retirees don't want to sell down the new entity to stay solvent.
"as soon as next week, CEO will announce that they will cut dividend by 1/2 starting next Q and the NEWS will sink another 26% of T. Just sell and go buy $tsla and invest in the future. And also put some in $pltr for gigantic growth!!!"
Management has totally botched the announcement of this deal. There are more positives than negatives here but the stock is selling off because of the confusion as to the details.
Its a wash. Cramer.
Yeah why do they do this... Jason was Killing it. OFFLINE I talked to @MAN about DC comics I am hard to understand about this Stankey.
"There is only one problem... by the time the new business gets profitable, interest rates will be up to 7%."
"Guys look at the numbers. At&t´s FCF will be reduced with ~6b a year, after Warner Brother etc are spun off to create the new company. They said the new company would be doing ~8.5b a year in FCF. You as a T shareholder are owning 71% of that FCF. That is ~6b a year in FCF. So you are losing 6b FCF with At&t, but the new company will produce 6b FCF for you as well. So you aren´t losing any FCF! Ofcourse you will be taking on some debt that DISCA brings, but I think it is worth it. And the new company is unlikely to be valued, with a EPS number as low as T is. That alone will create a lot of value. If you believe VZ is currently fairly valued, then you should be loving T at current levels. After the deal, At&t will have almost the same FCF per year as VZ and actually a lower net debt. They are currently trading with a market cap close to each other. Again, if you believe VZ is fairly valued, then you are basically getting the shares of the new company for free, buying at current levels."
I own Discovery shares and hope we can be family!!!
TWhere's MB? He trashed AT&T the last time he sold it and said Macy's was the stock to but. OUCH
"TMobile's own streaming service (TVision) goes bust after 5 months and they go up $3.50? LOL What sense does that make? Yea, they latched on with Google and YouTube but is YouTube TV really going to compete with Netflix and HBO Max? Doubt it. And what are the financial terms of that deal? Probably not that great for TMobile."
Lots of income invested bailed last few days don’t expect large rush again for a while. Will have to see details of deal to determine next move but still get divy as is for about a year
"The key to success is being able to adjust, EPD, ENB, PBA a month ,WPC, NNN, UHT, VZ, O a month. have more."
Didn't close in the red. That's encouraging.
Not selling a single share. Collecting my $0.52 divy while I wait till the companies work hard to spin off the growth assets packaged nicely for me as a gift.
"A shareholder friendly, shareholder focused deal.......finally!!!"
"Hold cash, President Carter gave us 17% CD when he was in office."
"Some of the calls Cramer makes are really bad, just weeks back he was telling everybody to sell Walgreens because the technicals are bad, the next few days the stock went much higher! I have faith that T is about ready to leap higher upon earnings and made a first time investment in the stock the other day!"
Over the past 5 years $T has dropped 4% INCLUDING dividends. The S&P has doubled. So that is all you need to know. Management is committed to shareholder value DESTRUCTION.
The dividend 6.5% dividend stays steady until 2022. Then shareholders get two stock that will be worth $45+with a dividend of 4%.
"I don’t understand why DISCA keeps falling. This is a good deal for them, too, in my opinion."
Jason Kilar is presenting today at noon add a virtual conference. Let’s see if his presentation provides some good information to push the stock price up of AT&T￼￼
"I still don’t know how people can’t see a fall off coming in the market. Do people think stocks can keep climbing and never fall? Prices of products are climbing, people’s extra money that’s been used to artificially inflate the market will be ending. There will be a transition period for people going back to work, payroll getting set up, delayed paychecks hitting back accounts depending how off often the company you work for but the bills won’t stop coming. New investors are gonna see the market falling and they are gonna sell off and their their money. It won’t be like 2008 market but definitely will be a decent drop while the market rebalances. But hey what do I know? I’m just some random person on the internet"
Inflation fears being generated by the Wall St elite. Its all fake. They want to keep that perception to reduce the froth in the markets. Inflation is transitory. A couple of months of inflation talk and it will subside.
"If it goes down after a major beat like this, then you know the game plan already for the next couple of years.Buy low close to ex div and then dump before ex div. and expect it to tank at ER right after. Rinse and Repeat. They are going to keep flogging the debt monkey until it is under the ground."
You people have been arguing that T is not an investment but VZ is.. Because it pays less divvy is more sustandable..There you have it...
"Verizon exploring sale of Yahoo and AOL for 4-5 billion. Good, maybe the new owner will bring the comments back."
When they cut the dividend this dog is going to $23; and it's coming. 
Has anyone explained how much spinoff stock T holders will get? If you hold 100 shares of T how many shares of spinoff will you get?
Shorts better cover this is locked in close to 30 and will get pushed up as they do cover
"T is just now ramping HBO max, and already they are spinning it off. This is some stock lol."
"Great buying opportunity might be coming. I’ll build in my small position when the time is right. Dividend cut is so-so, but really is best for the future"
"Don’t like that Stankey won’t admit he/management made huge mistakes.Quit saying dividend reset,,,Tell it like it is...By any measure they have performed poorly."
"Verizon put a hurt on ATT, but T-Mobile is going to put them out of business."
"The $32 strike call volume looks like it has dropped from 50,000+ contracts to 26,000. Not sure what to make of that, except that it lessens the chance that big money work to pin it under $32 for the close tomorrow."
It is an absolute shame the way T CEO lied to the shareholders by saying on news reports the dividends as extremely safe think of the countless millions of shares bought by institutions and dividend seekers in the last 22 open stock market days who have lost 4 to 5.50 dollars per share . I would treat his name like a sex offender and not say it but those shareholders shoul sue him for hyping the stock
Looks like the dividend temper tantrum is over.
Can't believe this is going to finish red. What a stock indeed.
selling AOL and YAHOO didn't help VZ so I wonder why this spin off will help T ?
What is the price per share in the new media company.. it should be about 20/30 per share right???
"Thankfully I sold out yesterday. The only reason a lot of people hold T is for the dividend and income. Also a lot of ""Dividend Aristocrat"" ETFs will soon have to sell it further putting downward pressure on the share price. For T management not to know this is a bit out of touch."
"When the going gets tough, Chia Pet deletes his recent messages and runs away.Tooo funny. "
Not good he should be fired
Cheers T longers.
The newco is projecting revenue of -$52B.
"nflx has done some great things but i always wondered why they were viewed as having a moat. a great big head start? yes. a moat? no. there was a stat at one time that said something like 70% of the hrs watched on nflx were made up of Friends, The Office and one other, i forget (big bang theory maybe?). It's not shocking to me that their numbers are slowing and hbomax is going to be a serious competitor. now all we need is the multiple to reflect that!"
Does AT&T still own hbo max after this? That’s where the real growth is
AT&T run by Demopukes.........they're doomed
Dividend cut in half
"Well, this is one day I don't have to cringe looking at T's stock price action. Beat on wireless subscriber and HBO Max additions. That takes a feather out of the caps of VZ and NFLX. Should be a good day. At the very least, I should be seeing less of NFLX and more of T in the headlines."
"I like T. The communications part is a money machine. Lots of cash flow. I like warnerMedia.... great studios and content. I bought T for the dividend for retirement. However I sold all my shares yesterday when I learned the new dividend would be $1-1.20 after the spin off. However I do think the planned separation of T & Warner is a good plan. I like Discovery Channel and think adding Warner will create a dynamic media company. Currently T is at $30 , ( 2.60 lower than where I sold it.) Buying back in will give me my 7% dividends for the 4 quarters plus a cheaper entry price that offsets 5 more quarters of missed dividends. After the separation in 2022 I cannot see T or ""NewDiscovery"" trading less than $20 each. That would amount to at least a 25% gain on my T stock. The future T dividend would be around 4.5% and I would decide later on if I should switch over to another dividend stock or stay the course with T."
All Major holders of Discovery like this merger and they know better than the shorts.As for as standalone entity T we need to watch how that is going to unfold.Gl!
Congrats to everyone who bought the dip. We will go over $30 again soon.
Anybody have any idea when the proposed effective date on this deal is and more importantly what the effective date of stock ownership is to allow you to participate. The only thing I can see is mid 2022. If that's the date will the dividend remain essentially the same till then or are they proposing adjusting it prior to the spin off?
Don’t let these people bait you to sell. You only lose when you sell. They have made to many moves in the right direction the past 1-2 years to give up on them now. I STRONGLY believe in their (now cheaper) streaming service and their expansion past phone/internet service. They are setting up to a MASSIVE Company in 10-20 years imo. Good luck with markets today
"short this trash to 25. dividend cut, mounds of debt why would I own this dog"
Its time to call Saul !
"Lastly, Verizon generates stronger revenue and earnings growth than AT&T if we exclude AT&T's inorganic gains from DirecTV and Time Warner. Analysts expect Verizon's revenue and adjusted earnings to both increase about 4% this year. But they expect AT&T's revenue to rise just 1% and for its adjusted earnings to stay flat."
Double upgrades this morning! w/$35 PT’s. Like I said before. Cramer is against T only because he owns the competition...
"Both AT&T and Discovery CEOs were on CNBC. They really haven't worked out the details yet, they don't have a clue how this is going to work. We will probably get shares in a new 3rd company. Looks like an excuse for AT&T to finally cut the dividend."
"It all comes down to the dividend. If they assure shareholders, then it’s a good deal and stock rises. If they don’t, watch out below!"
"I am not a financial person.... If AT&T could pay out around $2 / share before acquiring time warner without its cash flow, why can it continue after? Isn't it kind of unwinding the Warner deal? Or did they issue shares then (to TW holders) so now more shares remain since they are not removing ATT shares, just giving out Discovery shares to ATT holders ?While I imagine the combined value of ATT/Disc should not change, wouldn't ATT stock price drop (not just the dividend) on the spinoff, since it it a smaller company with same shares? Given that, would the new dividend % drop not be as bad, since stock is lower too?Example: today, $30 share, $2 div (roughly). After spinoff, say $20/share, $1 div + some shares in new Discovery so no net loss in value to shareholders . So the div will drop for current shareholders but if you buy in after, it might be closer to current percentage yield? If you hold from before, your yield drops but you now own some Discovery shares...Also I get how Discovery could compete better with an expanded catalog, but what about the remaining ATT? It will be smaller but how will this help it compete? By moving debt to Discovery aren't they just shuffling it and hurting discovery by ladening it with debt?Trying to understand the value proposition here. Debt is debt and can be transferred but not erased (until paid down), so not quite seeing how post-split company will function. Advice (polite) and comments welcome."
"I found a link to a PDF that was written by lawyers from a major NYC law firm (Skadden Arps). I posted the link on an earlier post but Yahoo deleted the post. Basically, to the shareholder, the Reverse Morris Trust is a tax free transaction. The assets of TW are spun off to a company 'Spinco' that then turns them over to the buying company (Discovery). T shareholders are 71% owners of the merged companies (TW and Discovery). As I understand it, shareholders retain ownership of all their T shares. As an example, if your number of shares in the merged companies totals 1,000 and the share price is $35, you have received, tax free, $35,000 worth of shares. If you sell the shares for a $2 profit, only the $2,000 is taxable. In other words, it is like a complex and complicated tax free distribution.If any one can add clarity to this explanation, please feel free."
Seeking Alpha sees combined value at $35.80 per share
I just got paid. Thank you T!!!
Dang! And my coal stock is up 7%. Go figure.
"SIX TIMES the average trading value today! Not enough lifeboats on THIS Titanic, either. Nearer, the bottom, to thee!"
Next everyone cancels HBO Max.
Kind of excited to watch the NBA Playoffs Play-In games tonight on TNT. (Owned by AT&T) Interesting structure if you haven't looked at it.7th and 8th best records play each other. And 9th and 10th best records play each other. 7-8 winner is the 7th seed. 7-8 loser has to play 9-10 winner for the 8th seed. 9-10 loser is out. The Lakers are actually in this thing.
Looks like going under 30 again what a disaster announcement 
#$%$ CEOs should give back all their millions that were involved with Time Warner purchase. Not earned or deserved.
T was punished for TimeWaner and DTV acquisitions and dropped from $40. Now we see what happens.
What John should have done is cut the dividend to 0 pay down debt with the $28 billion of free cash flow. And next year buy discovery for $20 billion. They would have been able to do it with just free cash flow and still paid down debt by around 30 billion
Strong Buy initiated by William and Stephen just now to Clients.
demorat MUTED!!!
"There is something missing here. The pie of earnings is still there (and you can argue is higher given synergies). It's just going to be in diff places. But to us, the shareholders, we still ""own"" those earnings streams. So while I could understand T's div going down slightly post-merger due to a fcf shift as a result of the twx earnings going to newco, it's not clear why then those shares couldn't earn a dividend too. It's one of a few things, but in no case, has the co been honest about it NOR HAS IT BEEN CONVEYED BEFORE:1) lots of investment needed ahead for 5g buildout 2) T put some new debt on newco so as to get the $45 bill to pay down debt. The new debt servicing requirements precluded a div payment on newco shares.3) They just want more wiggle room. Plain and simple.But remember, there have been LOTS of commentary from the company, via presentations, interviews etc., where, as they defended the safety of the div, they noted none of the above was true. So were they simply lying??"
it started going down sooo I put a limit order at $29.30 for 400 shares just playing and it went through lol so excited.
"If the dividend is cut 40%, then stock will drop 40%. T was is and will always be an income stock"
$34... come to papa..
"The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be- T is going to the moon "
Who got the better deal ? DISCOVERY or ATT.? More importantly which company should I invest in ?
24 years and I have never seen anything like this.
"Will probably close red. Dropping like a rock. Only T can announce a merger/spinoff - which almost always is received positively especially for an underperforming asset, but cut the dividend by nearly 50% & close red."
Barron's magazine cover story today is about building an income stream for retirement with 10 dividend-paying stocks.Is T on the list?
Sticking with T but the CEO just said the divi was safe then cuts it. Not cool.
The good thing for AT&T stock is that the big guy owes AT&T for helping to get him in office.
"I understand John Stankey has applied for his new job: As a fill-in for New York City's Naked Cowboy, Robert John Burck. This is only until he sets up on his own street corner in Beverly Hill, Ca. Good luck Johnny, hope you can at least play an instrument given the failure you were at growing the business, building out the new 5G network, and treating your employees with respect..."
"In light of the T news, which still to me is unclear, fettuccine with shrimp  and cherry tomatoes  on the afternoon menu"
$30 at AMC to see Godzilla vs Kong. HBO? Do the math.
T will level off in the low 29’s. When the actual amount of the dividend cut is announced there will be another drop. At $26 a share (not $33) they will claim they only dropped the dividend a point.
So why exactly will happen next year after the merger? Will the new company’s stock automatically appear in whatever platform we are using?
"Only thing that saves us T shareholders is if the tender to buy all our shares at Friday’s closing price, because it will never get up there again in our lifetime."
$33 this week. Big reversal into high-yield value stocks.
I think the saying is “don’t step over a dollar to pick up a dime”. Referring to the people who sold.
"price target 60... Don't pay divvy, pay capital appreciation.. Let us do it."
You deserve what you are getting for investing in a company that owns a company that spews propaganda almost 24/7 and then claims otherwise.. AT&T to 20$..
"Correct me here, but the dividend remains in place until the deal closes. That's estimated at 1-year from now. So,- Continued dividend remains the same for one year.- A close of the deal a special dividend payment will be paid.- $T shareholders receive equity in the spinoff.How the market receives the spinoff and AT&T after that point is anyone's guess, but execution will be critical. But for now things remain the same."
This is a slap in the face to all of us dividend investors that have held this stock for years. I was lucky to get out breaking even cost wise but how about all those retired people that hold this for income that paid $40.
36 million dumped in first hourWhere will the bottom be?
T is range bound. No sense in buying until it moves significantly lower. Buy low sell high.
I said it before. The div needed to be cut years ago. They are the most indebted non bank company. They have no business paying div.
AT&T is STILL a bargain under $40.
You complain that some CEO get a lot of stock options because of the deal.Do you complain that SoftBank CEO got 60 billions of bailout on Sprint while TMUS priced with PE of 50?LMAO.
"Why is it that ATT can never handle the venture it buys into? Remember attbi and the incompetent way it handled the email addresses? Of course DirecTV--another stellar acquisition! LOL. What's next, acquiring another ISP, or maybe Dish Network this time? Gateway computers? Dial-up modems?"
InvestorPlace article slamming T is wrong and obviously biased. T is going much higher.
Congrats to those who sold on news...those who didn’t should have took my advice
T has become one of my favorite cash holdings vehicle while market valuations scream higher. Love the dividends!
T bod & c suite f’d up!They’ll never admit it but they’re so out of touch with shareholders.After today they’ll go into hiding!
~$1.25 divy for the future + 71% of shares in NEWCORP? Looks like a win to me. Bought more during the temper tantrum. This is now a growth company with over a 4% divy. I can live on that.
Lots of Bag Holders created today.
"$T keep buying this stock, dont u know u get 2 different companies/stocks for the price of 1 right now?! 2 for 1 DEAL. Get it while it's FRESH. When merger happens u will keep ALL ur $T stocks and also get 70% of the NEW stock/ticker as well! :D"
"I'm not speculating, we believe AT&T is trading severely undervalued. Price target $48.00 per our Analysts."
closing in a 20% crash in 2 days - another ceo another direction for the company this is all about eliminating the dividend!

"cheetah- Nerve exposure is your own worst enemy as you're always playing defense, always trying to substantiate and explain your exaggerated claims, your fantasy Puts, your every move, all day, every day, each with the same result and embarrassing gesture of pathetically patting yourself on the back. To the point, your inadequacies and insecurities are obvious and immense. I'm guessing you're a young straggler that's been cuddled and overshadowed with a hovering helicopter upbringing, being watched and questioned on your every move, why you chose that move and how you're going to fix the catastrophic ones, with strict deadlines to report back on who, what, why, where and when.There's no correct answers here son, it's not about being right or trying to desperately convince people how big your nugget of fools gold is, it's more about integrity, sincerity and substance. (kind of like what I've written here, lol) Simple words from John Lennon: 'There's nothing you can do that can't be done' (unless you chose to repeatedly lie about 'doing what you never did')Let that marinate for a bit before flying off the handle and spewing more of your exaggerated claims, inaccuracies and falsehoods.Cheers!"
The type of investor wanting to invest in AT&T has turned over. For every seller there was a buyer. This is a good deal for patient investors and those not so dependent on their dividend income.
ATT's new directive to small fry investors !
Morning T ~ Cvs is almost 90 ! Loving it . Probably scotch time for T fans
"Sorry Panic Sellers, but the -14,5% drop is a welcomed gift for the smart money. Gonna see 31$ today."
great
"I predict within the next 12 months Buffett’s team will buy some T. Look to his coming, at first light in the year 2022. At Dawn look to the East."
"What this is, is just one final whopping dividend payout (feast) and then a cut (famine). A long one at that."
"We're all about to re-experience the high-inflation, low-growth Jimmy Carter years for the same reasons: weak and incompetent leadership. Maybe we won't have hundreds of American hostages in Iran this time...."
"Its great to see the bounce right now.. but who knows what will happen, Does anyone know when the dividend will be cut ?"
"This is all part of the ""Great Reset"", resetting everyone's income."
Might be going up Faster now than a rabid cheetah chasing a CNN Reporter
CRAMER IS SCREAMING SELL !Jim Cramer told AT&T Inc (NYSE: T) investors who want income to sell the stock Monday via Twitter.I don't think that people realize that ATT is going to have at least a 50% dividend cut which is why if you want income it should be SOLD !
"AT&T (T) will go ex-dividend tomorrow April 8, record date: April 9 = .52 cents. Great company, good cash flow and great dividend for any investors who look for great dividend income."
"Until this deal closes in mid 2022, will T maintain the $.52 dividend?"
"Assuming the deal goes through; debt goes from about 180 billion to $140 billion; can the 71% of retained ownership be monetized for about $120 billion so that AT&T gets out only with minor bruising ?Assuming the new MEDIA ownership goes in and fixes CNN ratings; this could quickly turn into increased advertising dollars........while getting out was good, I still believe this will be a very painful event for shareholders due to overpaying on the purchase."
I bought 2300 shares.
The $43B debt reduction is the most important part of this deal.Dividend cut is bad but if you buy today T shares will give youmore gain than the dividend loss. Legacy shareholders may have to wait longer to get even.
"Wall Street cuts and runs on uncertainty. With the dividend up in the air, this will be pumped up and then the rug will be pulled out."
One more mistake by the board of directors. Why focus on outside assets? When are they going to focus on making their existing assets work?
"Cmon folks - down to $27, I’ll take the $2.04 in divvy and new co. People stuck on yield here and not going their math."
"Holy mackerel, the Oils are busting out (as I thought they would). I sold FANG (Diamondback Energy) $75 Puts on the 22nd when the stock was $73 something and it's over $83 today. Same with BP. Sold the $24.50 Puts on the same day when the stock was below $24.50 and it's $25.50. If you're looking for growth, buy the beaten up Oils. There should be some major upside as the country opens up again."
"Dragons are coming! HBO Max, 2022! Dragons are worth a Trillion dollars! T to 5X in 2022!"
"HOMEGAMERS ! I Bought 28,600 Shares Wednesday @ 28,72..I POSTED....SEE YA @ 29.50 Tomorrow (Thursday) and......$30 By FRIDAY ! SKEE DADDY !"
Dividend should have been Cut 2020 when most companies cut because of Covid-19...If done better off today because of
Will T ever grow or stay in this 28-30 dollar range for eternity? Although I bought much higher I have held for the income. Now what?
Maybe when it hits the mid 20’s I can average down from 37 from a few years ago. It was for income. What’s it for now? Cut income. No growth!
I think this is options selling more than anything. Friday's max pain is $29 so the options guys were looking for a reason to kill all those in the money calls. I don't know why anyone would sell T now knowing they will get shares in a new company that is bigger than Disney for a 30% discount to DIS. This is like getting shares in a IPO the day before it starts trading on the open market.
"Cheetah I’m betting T will close <$30 today and I sold covered calls ; so, I put money on the lineAny view?"
"Three years from now, when T is < $20, they are gonna say,Ooops! We did it again! We made a terrible mistake."
I am a small time investor. A little over 1K shares. I put about $400 a month in and of course reinvest the dividend. I personally wouldn’t mind the stock staying in the high 20’s. More stock for the money which means more dividend to reinvest. Also I expect the company to taut the dividend by $.01 for November payout do the can keep the dividend aristocratic rating.
Dividend reduction of 40%? Concentrate on higher growth?Comments around the dividend after the spin off of 20 billion in Free Cash Flow and 45% payout ratio. T currently pays $2.08 per 7.13 billion shares. Roughly $15 billion. Looks like they expect new dividend payout to be closer to 9 billion?
"I think this is quite an over reaction...It is not like the company is in trouble. Yes, dividend will be cut, but you will get shares in the new Warner media company."
Are we going to get shares in the spinoff company like we did when pfizer spin off its vtrs
DISC noes not pay a dividend. What's going to happen to the nice dividend that T holders enjoy now?
"Morningstar values T@$36 as a fair value estimate. Combining WarnerMedia with Discovery should enhance the value of the new firm, though not to an extent that we expect will have a huge impact on AT&T's worth overall. The transaction does highlight the value of WarnerMedia, which we suspect would be trading well in excess of the roughly $100 billion AT&T paid for it, net of divestitures, if it were a stand-alone firm today. We also wouldn't rule out the possibility that another firm makes a play for WarnerMedia--we still believe it would pair well with Comcast's NBC Universal--but we wouldn’t count on it, either. We view AT&T shares as fairly valued."
Overall market decline isn't helping T today.
"Wonderful earnings in all directions ! Warner 2.7mil new subs compared to 1.4-1.8 as expected , adding in wireless too! Good job T!"
S&P Revises AT&T Outlook to Stable From Negative on Proposed Merger of Warner Media With Discovery; Ratings Affirmed
"To all those who thought Stankey was a Stinker. Stankey proves once again the creativity of enacting the metaphor, thinking outside the box. Whatever you think of Stankey, he is breaking new ground to pull T out of the garbage heap of businesses Stephenson threw money at hoping somehow they could be managed all under one roof."
"love the spikes, icing on the cake to the beautiful dividend."
"Amazing! If you read comments below, armageddon is coming for T!!but is it really like that? Look up on traded volumes yesterday... All sold shares are picked up while share priced went down 6% only not 20% or 30%. I am sure that there are commentators just waiting to buy!! Yes, company WILL slash dividend but in the same time compensate with new co shares that don't have upper limit in time... It is a question of time when we will see reversal in share price as all shares bought yesterday dont look to go out and earn few cents on share.."
Held since 2015. Sold today. Overall made out well due to dividend payments. There is no future for T. On schedule to be the next GE. Horrible managment.
"TNot even an hour after he three a fit and said he was done posting here, Spartan55 couldn't control himself and posts again. He has no self-control."
Cheetah with the current price movement are you now seeing a trend for this to close above 32 Friday?
William MUTED!
"LONGS PANICKING? YOU SHOULD BE!!! Sell your T fast and cheap and get short. Analysts say T is worth less than $18 per share after the dividend cut. T losing market share in all is business lines, OMG OMG OMG ..... SELL SELL SELL!!!!"
Fuel on the East coast is running out quickly due to the cyber attack. The herd is hoarding it up. Just like bathroom tissue and paper towels. Price will skyrocket for a few weeks due to this. Same things happen when a storm is coming. Just another day in the world we have created for ourselves. Thank you to all the media. Long AT&T
Zaslav and Stankey speaking on CNBC and driving price down. They are not compelling.
I hope they ripped Randall Stephenson pictures down from the corporate offices.
When the Reddit traders can get ahold of the newco shares you will be so sorry you sold.
"I thought selling all my T shares this morning @ $33.70 was risky if it kept going up but now with T in the red, happy I did. Thought about buying my shares back at lower price but with T in the red and dividend cut likely, think I will wait to see if T drops lower."
This company is pure pain. Price hasn’t moved for the last 15 years.
Yesterday sell off around 250 mln sharesLet us see whether we see the same numbers. I think shorts will capitulate since this is not as bad being perceived
The Market is not looking good for Wednesday.
It’s a done deal!
$$$.....2 MON GAINERS...AT& T UP 2 % Early ...and AABB GOLD-backed Ethereum Crypto STOCK UP 5% to 16%
You might ask why I only bought half of T back.. well. The other half has to go to high yield mutual fund..It is a discipline...
Best time to buy right now!! Easy profits smooth sailing to 30!! 31 by eow
With all the negative press will there be a batch of downgrades coming?
"If ATT cuts their dividend, its likely the new Warner-Discovery entity will begin paying a dividend also. ATT will be a pure play like Verizon and Warner will also be a pure play allowing for a better valuation or even a sale of the company."
"The pandemic saved ATT millions in finance charges. What with the credit downgrade last year and the extension of contract negotiations, last year was a dire situation. So, you have to ask, what lessons were learned? When the company was given a gift horse in the name of Donald Trump, the opportunity to monetize the cash value of CNN was stubbornly disregarded. So now we have nothing from nothing!"
Don’t lose this opportunity to buy T. Next around 40-45. Trust me
Cramer is all fact AT&T is terrible
"On the surface, this seems like a compelling move if they can bolster HBO streaming content, unlock the value in the media businesses, and spin off debt. I see no reason the dividend would be affected."
"Think this through, folks. The details are NOT as bad as they first look."
Fettuccine was and will be outstanding. Like to hear your comments about today as I am confused  on exactly what the transaction means
Absolute mess this company is one after another.
sell T and buy $tsla.Tsla is on bargain basement price for now but it will not last long...buy buy buy!!!!!!!!
Faber just confirmed that the deal won't close for over a year.
"AT&T is NOT selling Warner for $43B after paying $85B for it. They're selling less than 29% of Warner for $43B. They're retaining 71% in ""Spinco"" which will add Discovery. Sure the dividend is cut on T, but substiantially more secure. Sell call options on ""Spinco"" to generate the extra income. if you or your advisor doesn't know how, then time to find yourself an advisor or hire a new one."
"Run Forest, Run!"
just keep creeping upwards 0.60 at a time until you hit $40
I just put in a good 'til cancelled buy at $24.
Mr Stanky
"This week AT&T ended the strategy of being a bond and inaugurated the strategy of being a 21st century, 5G technology company. Welcome back to the fight, AT&T......this time I think our side is going to win."
The entire reason people held T was for the dividend and relatively flat price action... LOOOOL may as well kiss this company goodbye the next Gamestop
The only reason to own AT&T was the dividend!
There goes 33 down the drain. Can it stay green?
"Actually, I wish no will I’ll to T as they funded my retirement for years. Goodbye, old boy."
Do you know what really gets me about this merger and the timing of it...The first we heard about this deal was last weekend and than we hear the deal was inked on Monday.Of course the board of directors meeting was held April 30...If we were told in late March or early April this is what they were considering doing we would have voted Stankey and his board out...If you think about it he knows it..Especially if he would have announced the Dividend was cut in half. .With a company the size of T when do you find out about a merger the day before its signed? the man is a cretin..
"analysts are estimated the new company to have a value of $148 billion, thus say Discovery shares are undervalued based on their 29% ownership of this newco. So T shares with there 71% ownership of a company valued at almost what T is now are not undervalued as well?"
"Alert! HBO Max about to start MINTING MONEY! SUBS WILL 10X over next 24 months! The Content they will release over next 24 months combined with the frictionless proliferation of streaming apps is going to BLOW MINDS! Just caught the first Episode of The Nevers, going to be a HUGE INTERNATIONAL HIT! It is just the beginning, HBO Max content is going to be EPIC!"
buy the dips
anyone know the last day to get in on T to get shares on the new company?
Tonight Cramer Sez..... I TOLD YOU This AM....Stock Should NOT Have Been UP......The ONLY REASON For 40 Years To own This Is The DIVIDEND.......With Dividend Gone/CUT.....This Goes QUICKLY To the Mid 20's !
Thanks Stankey & Kilar...imo T is on the right road for Stock Appreciation
"T shares are worth $20, but along with DISCA shares which are worth $33, The total worth is $50 at least."
"Looks like war in middle east is starting. Mexico immigration crisis is getting worse....Yup, good old Joe is being run over by international threats since they know there is no consequences & accountability. Obama's ""red line"" part 2."
5 years of dividends gone in 2 days.
Reality finally sinking in for T shareholders. A deal every three years at a 50% loss doesn't make a winning stock.
Really poor public relations job today. Or else T management is under fire
Trend is up guys for a while barring The Depression. Not adding personally. Just Hold and DRIP for now on the decent accumulation I have. I planned to double it pre ER and then lock in half profits but really no way to tell how that ER dice was gonna roll. Good for now. Cash waiting for the hot growth stocks once they come back to earth.
The sad truth is...all these CEO's are sheet...they walk away with million...for what......jack sheet
You people act like Cramer is your biggest problem. He's not. You're biggest problem is sitting behind the biggest desk at T.
The whole bullish thesis was on HBO/Werner Media and now thats gone im not so sure if you want to own it at this valuation compared to Tmobile or Verizon???
$32 yippy caye mf
Closing Green and 30 (or more) today would make me feel warm and fuzzy !!
"Everybody's attacking Stankey, he's just trying to clean up the mess that Stephenson created. Stankey is doing okay, but they do need to clean up the board, they never should have let these deals go through."
John Malone deal by the looks they keep saying. ? is he a paid consultant ? if not by the price action could he be at crossed purposes ? is he a director for T?
People are dumping shares after att announced Div. cut !!!!!
ATT'S BUSINESS PLAN OVER 20 YEARS
"For those emphasizing that T investors will receive shares on the new company, keep in mind that this new company will be heavily indebted at closing, after paying T for WM assets. It would have a debt load of $60 billions with ebitda of only $12b, or 5x. So don’t expect the value of the stock to be received to be significant and remember it is going to be a one time transaction. Meanwhile you will be losing your current dividends stream forever and what is really the worst part, you will continue stuck with the same management that brought you here, John Stankey."
From reading this message board investors don't understand the deal. They have to cut the dividend since the media assets will transfer to a new company. AT&T will no longer own those assets. You will be given shares in the new company.
"Looks like we will take a 45% ish haircut on divy w deal, but gain 71% shares of new company (no divy there n won’t be for a while if ever). Basically takes us from an income play to growth play (2x if u keep ur new shares) w some income (lower T divy). Need to run numbers (or have someone smarter than which doesn’t take much do it). If new combined shares growth outweighs lost divy it’s a great deal of course, if not will miss the large qtrly check I was getting..."
I want in on the AT&T lawsuit as soon as it happens for cutting its dividend for their benefit
t
AT&T over $32 by end of week
Well at least the divvy yield will soon be back to 6 percent+!
"Earnings out prior to market opening tomorrow I believe. I'm holding my breath because it could cause a big move up or down depending, obviously, on the results."
$25 soon
"I sold last week at 32.55 and moved to oil and airlines. I also closed my short puts this morning on the spike (lucky.) I am guessing that $T will drift to 25ish, NewCo when issued will be priced too high and drift lower after the spike at issuance. I've just seen this scenario toooo many times in my 40 years of investing."
Bad deal for T... Good deal for T shareholders. I'll still accumulate.
DOWN $4 From Pre Market !Probably Down Another$4 TOMORROW !
Dump CNN.....
What are you guys buying now for dividend income?
"https://youtu.be/9Y90WnsfKR4Thank you, Cramer. He’s willing to speak up for investors."
If your salary was cut in half would you stay with the company?T was an income stock period. Red flags were there now they are true.
Has everyone gotten their covid-19 scamdemic shots yet. Obvious Fraud. If this virus is as wide spread as they say it is. then why has no lab anywhere been able to isolate and share Covid 19 sampels with the rest of the scientific community?
"newco is going public with $130B market cap.. watch it run up to $200B... only then will these guys say what a good deal for T.. I have always said T can only afford $1 a share div... best thing they did..... but should of just been done and not the spin off..... but it will all work out in the end.... when you buy the best house on the block, you always get your money at the end... End of day, you might have two dividend streams.. dont you think T will propose that? Disney cut there dividend and look at them.. T had no choice but to drop TW,,,, grandma loves that dividend and now she gets to keep it..... next look for a VZ merger with T to make that old MaBell reality... again they will have no choice,,,, be happy, you will get that 52 cents in august and november and part of 2022... stocks about to rally big time after this market down draft is done.... 500M shares given to new holders,,, some of them very big..."
The worst part of the interim is the current uncertainty of what's ahead for WarnerMedia. Wall Street abhors a vacuum.
Large chunk of dividend spun off like polar ice in the Arctic.Climate change at T...
"For better or worse, T will become more of a pure play telecom dependent on growth in 5G. Debt reduction is good, dividend cut is not. T's valuation has to come down further to reflect this (a bit closer to Verizon's multiple and it will take time to establish a new, lower baseline)."
"Trading 30.05 pre mkt, fire the ceo"
"Deal not expected to close until mid-2022. Relax and continue collecting the dividend and don’t panic here, Plenty of time to sell later if you so choose."
1 million shares trading per 1 minute...as we come to a close. incredible.
"CAN YOU SAY, BREAKOUT!"
Bottomed out for the day?
$22 back in?
Feel sorry for the ppl who sold after last ex-div day—- honestly T was bound to eventually break out
T will trade above 32 today. There I said it.
"At $31.5 the yield is 6.6%. I think the share price is topped out. There is still just enough risk in owning T that folks need at least 6.6-7% yield to buy more shares. I don't see any significant big sell off either. And of course for those of us who paid quite a bit less than 31.5 the yield is even higher, although Kramer ( for what his opinion is worth) disagrees with that way of looking at things. Of course he is a very active trader and his viewer lean toward the active trading mode. T is a great buy and hold long term, collect dividends, stock."
Adding more as it goes lower. great divi.
"Looking over the financials the scary thing about T is it has a current ratio less than 1.0What is even scarier is most of the total assets of T is merely an accounting phantom factor that in reality could be worth NOTHING - Goodwill and Intangibles is a staggering $300 billion of the total $525 billion stated assets!!In reality therefore, if take Goodwill and Intangibles out of the assets of T you come up with the liabilities of T far exceeding its assets which means it NEGATIVE BOOK value!!Goodwill and Intangibles of $300 billion are merely accounting numbers which could be worth NOTHING!T is in much worse financial condition than most realize!"
I am literally excited at the prospect that Verizon will dispose of their media unit. It is a poor reflection on the parent company when free thought and speech is suppressed. No one dare write facts and truths about easily verifiable evidence. Sad for VZ shareholders.
wow cutting Dividends... bye bye T!
HBO MAX IS THE KEY TO T'S BIG FUTURE.
"anybody else been thinking this, that the Discovery shares are a better investment, for sure if anyone is looking to get into the newco for the best price, I can't see T shares going anywhere but back to $30 after initial post merger drop, while we only get while we get, even though 71%, but with 7billion shares to their 20% split between 700million shares, we end up with the equivalent of 1 share of newco for every 4 shares Discovery shareholders get, sure we keep T, but I like the extra 3 shares of newco over keeping the T share"
time to unload on #$%$ always been a dividend stock.... the price never actually goes up... it pays dividends and splits over time..... now it time to unload
"I pick on T a lot, but I will say T>>DIS, that is for sure. HBO Max is Netflix's toughest competitor, lots of good movies."
"Just saw this - PRESS DIGEST-Financial Times - BY Reuters— 9:22 PM ET 05/16/2021AT&T is nearing a deal to combine its content unit WarnerMedia with rival Discovery to create a media giant with an enterprise value of $150 billion, just a few years after acquiring the owner of CNN, HBO and Warner Bros, said people briefed about the matter. (Compiled by Bengaluru newsroom)"
"You don't know how many outstanding shares the new company will have. You may only get 10 shares of the new company for ever 100 shares of T that you own. Based on how Stankey operates, I expect it to be a laughable amount of new shares that you'll get,."
Even if it trips my stop loss @$30 I still make $$$$$$$’s. Have a good $2 buffer.
"I bought more shares yesterday, looking for a good day today....."
"Maybe mid-thirties by year end, but I don't see the 40's this year unless we see a huge reduction in debt and a resumption of dividend increases. People need proof that this is really a turnaround. Long term holder still in the red."
"+4.96% For T this is not Moon, it’s Mars."
Stankey lied on the div a few weeks ago he said they way the div yield goes down is to get the stock price up and now they cut the div. Typical they don't care of the shareholders and the rich get richer!
This is a Gordon Gecko type deal. I like it.
this will gap down below 29 overnight/tomorrow premarket lol
AT&T shareholders vote against approving executive compensation. Obviously the democrats weren't counting the vote.
From the discovery MB - it looks like based on the merged entity enterprise value will be 35% more than their current class c shares.T needs to move up too since we own 71%Gl!
Jason Kilar one year & 2 weeks on the job... Wow. Jason Kilar latest news over on Variety. I thought he was doing really well. Does this mean I won't get to see Gandofini's Godfather Part two? == I'm Upset
Today's drop puzzles me. The drop from near $31 to $30 was understandable due to the dividend and some momentum followers. Today's drop just seems unwarranted.
Wow. Look at this drop. Red today.
after-hours T about as relevant as pre-opening trades today....when T shares were bid up LOL
T future.
"From nearly 34 to now 30 in after-hours trading. Horrifying. Tomorrow we will see 29. No doubt about that. Pray we hold 28. Oh, and dividend will be cut. Let us pray it is not cut completely. So much for T being a dividend aristocrat."
As soon as Bidens MASSIVE tax hikes go in. All stocks will go down
"Again, can't seem to hold the big gain. Do not know why."
"So, T shores up the balance sheet so they can fund more expansion and the reaction is negative? Way too much focus on dividend cut."
"I added to both T and VZ last month, and yet I'm still smiling about both, and my blood pressure is under control:-)))) with no chest pain ........ today.... yet."
T shareholders have been thrown under the bus. I am afraid it will open at $25 tomorrow. Hope I am wrong.
Down another year's divy in PM already.
"T now range bound 27-29.5, until the spinoff."
Do you realize how tough it will be to get back to 32 or 33? Hundreds of millions of shares are waiting to be sold in the low 30s. 170 million shares traded yesterday alone. It would be years before the stock price recovers. Years!
"""Knock, knock."" ""Who's there?"" ""32"" ""32 who?"" ""32 going to 42."""
Dividend yield can stay at 7% with more drop LOL
Lots of shorts caught
"Blah, blah, blah...The only thing that counts is the stock tanked, is tanking."
The merger is ways off and too many unknowns. Just have to chill and wait for details.
"“Influential proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is recommending stockholders vote against AT&T’s executive compensation plan at its April 20 annual meeting after the company granted WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar a stock award valued at $48 million.Kilar’s base salary, at $2.5 million, was above that of current and former AT&T CEOs John Stankey and Randall Stephenson and the median of entertainment chief executives, which tend to be a highly compensated group, ISS said.”"
"That is my thesis,, and I am stick to it."
Solid deal. T reaps billions and still owns 70% of the new company? Boom!
"In T, we trust !!"
Spe...spe... spectacular special dividend..burn the shorts and gift the long term share holders in tax sheltered dividend...
I have MUTED everyone named Phil. 
"Think EBay spin off of PayPal. HBO Max value does not seem to be reflected in ATT share price. As a separate entity majority owned by ATT shareholders we will still control WB and Discovery. Only change will be the “free”,shares we are granted as T shareholders and the combined companies will be a streaming/media giant. eBay gave one share of PayPal to each shareholder when they spun it off. Look at PayPal now! This is good for everyone holding ATT and Discovery shares."
"To all u who care what Cramer has to say, he was kicked out of GS abs as of the year 2000 or so was doing an AM radio show with Larry Kudlow"
BOOM
Unfortunately there is no bottom on this -- i sold mine- i think just going by dividend ratio - this will go down to 20ish.... :(
Barry Diller said there couldn't be a better guy than David Zaslav to run Discovery & new company. He said essentially that AT&T stockholders purchased Time Warner & Discovery.
heavy selling in AHs. Just broke $31.
Buy American First .why buy a bond that pays 3% when T pays 7%
"There's a certain author at Barron's, whose name I won't mention because I fear my post could then be censured, but he keeps churning out stories on behalf of AT&T, or maybe, its big shareholders, who hope to exit with the highest price possible and thus need the price propped up whilst this happens. So this Barron's stooge has cranked out an article today about how it's merely disappointing for AT&T to be cutting its dividend but rest assured, they are executing a ""strategy"" to focus on 5G and broadband. There is zero mention of the incredible destruction of AT&T value here, with this mess of a Warner Media foray. The article today also points out how AT&T, in line with what analysts were pushin, executed its sale of a share of DIrecTV as part of its ongoing ""strategy"". No mention of the destruction of wealth by the DirecTV deal.Let's be clear here. AT&T is a mess. An absolute mess. Who knows what the stock price would be if competent, caring management were in charge the last 20 years. AT&T hasn't executed a strategy of note in two decades, or maybe ever. DirecTV was a mind boggling destruction of wealth. The Warner Media foray was a horrific destruction of shareholder assets. There is no strtegy here. Just reaction, just fumbling around to keep their head above water.Ironically this Warner Media deal is happeing with John Malone at Discovery. He must be chuckling. Way back when, 20-25 years ago, Malone sold AT&T his cable company, TCI, which admittedly had core cable assets that were definitely worth something, but theses asets were in decrepit shape and required massive investments. Malone sold TCI to AT&T back then for $50 billion. And afetr AT&T fumbled around and invested billions more in it to upgrade those cable assets, they wound up selling them to Comcast. For nothing close to what they put into it. Comcast walked away with some solid cable infrastructure. AT&T has never done anything right for two decades. So I don't know what the motivation is behind the onslaught of articles from Barron's that ignore the tremendous destruction of wealth at AT&T and talk instead about ""stratgegic shifts in focus"", but it's financial propaganda at its best, IMO. This author managed to point out how AT&T is worth between 30 and 40 when you consider the AT&T core business plsu Warner Media. As in, AT WORST, it's worth $30. I don't beleive it for a second. I don't think AT&T is going under, but I think the company is a wreck and there's a reason it's stock price hasn't moved in 20 years. LIke I said, that 30-40 ""fair"" share price mention is suspicious. Buyer beware."
"RICH BUT MISERABLE?Charles de Vaulx, a renowned value investor and co-founder of International Value Advisors, died suddenly Monday afternoon, leaving the asset management industry in shock. It was an apparent suicide, according to the New York Police Department.De Vaulx entered his Midtown Manhattan office Monday afternoon and jumped from the 10th floor, according to the New York Police Department.The news came six weeks after IVA announced it was closing down, and a week after it liquidated its two U.S. mutual funds, a move that had surprised the industry because the firm still had more than $2 billion in assets, and value was beginning to see a resurgence."
All the crazies will disappear until the market dips again. Muting can really clean up the message board experience.
CNN also going after the best Gov in America Ron Desantis. Why because he is a good role model on how to run a state and Cuomo gets a pass. How many more women have to come forward!! and the nursing home cover up! why is this guy still in office?
Some management teams have the talent of snatching defeat out of the jaws of victory. I sold most of my position yesterday when I deciphered the dividend cut What reason is there to own this stock? It's not a growth stock and it's not a dividend stock.
T is facing cash flow pressure for future spending so they need Dividend cut and selling assets and they are doing boths.
Good old Joe. Lifting sanction on Iran. He's putting us back in the position of 40 years ago that will cause nothing but cyclical violence and fear of global war. Same thing with border crisis. Reversing everything that was working for the last 4 years...
"Institutional ownership is Huge! They will ensure the price don’t fall and in fact they will stabilize. JPM, GS, MS, BOFA, Citi all has huge interest and position with T. There is a huge value and most of them expecting a value betw $30+ to $41 +I’ll place it around $32/33Gl!"
"Everyone’s freaking out and blaming the CEO and the Board of Directors. 1. This deal doesn’t close till mid 2022 2. We get 71% of the new company 3. In turn, the T Dividend is cut a little until revenue streams are flowing. 4. We will get 5e div send back up to 6-7% in due time. 5. Relax and stop slaying the leadership of the Company. They made this deal to look after us, their investors. It’s going to be a good deal for everyone. Good luck to everyone. If you don’t like what’s going on, sell your shares and move on."
ie...at&t shareholders
let the reactions pass and assess the situation afterwards in a business like manner
Stanky maybe u aren't the man. Maybe your tenure is short hopefully somewhere in this company somewhere somebody is talented to run the show profitably
mm's working overtime to keep this below 32 for weekly opex.
don't know what to do. should i wait to sell or just get out now. I bought this for the dividend 5 years ago and it's done nothing but go down. So today is the day i say screw it - i'm out. I'll have a nice tax loss to use for years. I HATE this company.
"Randy ? At the time Stephenson announced his departure, it was acknowledged that the acquisitions of DirectTV and Time Warner had by this point resulted in a massive debt burden of $200 billion for the company."
"Nice day for T.Shot a 91. Not the best but happy with the score anyway. Ouch, FANG got kicked hard today (closed at $76.20, down $3.28 for the day). If it hangs around here I'll have to buy it at $80 next Friday when the Puts I sold expire. I wouldn't mind that. The June 18 $80 Covered Calls are currently selling for $4.40 each which would be a 5.5% gain in a month. On the other hand, if I do end up with the shares and the stock moves higher, the $4.40 Call premium will also move higher with the stock. Let's see what happens."
The date of the Warner Media divestiture is ?
"Alright! Hit my limit buy order! Sorry to take advantage of people panic selling their retirement accounts, but think this is a nice buy here."
If a potential investor in T wants to know where its stock price could be in 5 years; just take a look at the last 5 years to give you some idea of how the company has been managed and will continue to be managed in the future. Even though the past is no indication of the future; you can get some idea. The stock price will likely remain flat; but the dividend may still make T an investible asset. Food for thought; that's all.
"Not sure why people are freaking out about the dividend.... If you lose half the dividend, that's a dollar per year per share. But, if the stock can now rise that dollar or more because the numbers, cash flow, balance sheet, look better, you're getting it back, plus, the spinoff.Be patient."
Verizon's dalliance with Yahoo is now over.So when will ATT'S love affair with CNN have its' falling out?
"Thank goodness, that was a costly and huge reach by AT&T. I am very happy to put that episode to bed, we need to concentrate on the balance sheet, cost cutting, build out the 5G network, and boost free cash flow."
"Happy days are here again, the sky above is clear again......"
"Almost 10% stock drop in T. Once again, management enriches themselves while fisting shareholders.They should call it what it is, the 1% Merger."
Only reason it hasn't tanked more is the institutional orders stuck for COB sales
They pulled the rug from under us just when we started feeling good about T
What it all means? The FOX ate Randall's lunch.
A lot of people reacted too quickly on this. Even someone on FAST MONEY bought on the news and regrets it. Already down 10% from $33 a share. And going lower. Live and learn on the market.
Is this too high to buy right now? Few bigger dips before big gains though 2021?
Retirees dream stock.....good luck....
"Wow, I just took a look at DISH, the stock Phil keeps touting. It's got a lot of high marks and it really does look good. The stock is $44.80 right now, up $3.21 for the day. What I like about it is the premium for the Puts are big. The May 28 $41's are selling for $1.08 right now. What I don't like about it is that it's already up 42% for the year having started the year at $31.52 but it's worth keeping an eye on. If it drops back from here, which it probably will,, with those high premiums, I may sell some Puts on this one. Anyway, I need to do a lot more research before making a decision but for now, it's on my radar screen."
"We have officially turned into Europe. Sickening to listen to that ""speech"" tonight. What happened to Capitalism that Washington, Jefferson & Hamilton died for??"
Cramer is an air head. T is putting it together for the long term. price goes down divy up. lol
How many of these scam sites are Yahoo going to allow???
CUOMO GETS 5.1 MILLLION IN A BOOK DEAL AND IS ONE OF THE WORSE GOVERNORS IN AMERICA!! FAKE NEWS STATIONS LOVE HIM RIGHT?
"Seems like T with HBO max for $9.99 and all it's other moves is headed in the right direction. Unlike our liberal government who is trying to lead us in the wrong direction, by increasing our taxes, and allowing illegals to live here, putting more of a burden on the tax payer."
The chairman of T should be sued for lieing to shareholders about the dividend on Squawk Box 3 weeks ago.
"Does anyone have a ""guess"" about how much the dividend will be cut?"
between time warner and directtv the current management team managed to nuke 100B in valuethe current CEO was heavily involved in both deals.I dont want to invest along side that team.dumped all my T
Word on the street is Stankey is dropping the dividend so he’s forced into witness protection where they can change his last name to something less humiliating.
The grind up with Biden tax plan on this will be spectacular..42 by end of year. Better to be in dividend then in capital gains with upcoming hammer.
Yikes. There go all the gains. I was kicking myself the other day for not holding this. But now it’s back to what I sold it for. Think it goes lower? Seems like a lot of unknowns with the div cut and structure of this discovery deal.
Don’t lesson to Jim Cramer. T has a great future. Trust me.
"Just sold my position in T - as a T consumer (soon to be former) I found customer service to be terrible. If they treat all the customers they way I was treated, it doesn't bode well for growth. Good luck to all!"
"Thanks for this @sydI don't understand this sell off at all. Because of the dividend cut? You can't be serous. A simple breakdown of this deal could be looked at as follows: Discovery is going all in, their stock can be used as a benchmark. T is spinning off and will get 71% (after this I'm using round numbers). T gets $48 bil off their books (this in itself should spike T higher) and gets rid of yet another headache. Now the shares. For simplicity sake, let's break it all up by 5'ths. Discovery is all in, $22 bil (in deal for 1/5), T gets $48 bil in debt off their books for exchange of Warner (2/5). T stockholders get free stock in this new company (now it comes to valuations), call it $120 bil MC (I've heard highs of $150 to lows of $100 bil, this is in the middle) of whats left, call it $50 bil (2/5). With 7 bil shares outstanding in T, that works out to around $8-10 a share. Of course there will be other considerations, so let's call it, conservatively, $5 a share...of free money. Using Discovery common as a benchmark ($30), each share is worth 1/6 of the new company. Or 600 shares of T brings you 100 (free) shares of the new company (that has the potential to be a powerhouse), plus your original T shares (stronger with less debt, a stronger more focused company ready for the 5 G rollout), plus a what, 3-4% dividend in the meantime ...and T is selling off???"
"It feels like T is bouncing from one strategy to another not knowing what they really want to do. They just bought (and overpaid) the Warner assets a few months ago and now they want to spin them off? Do they want to go into media or don't they, and f they do, like they thought they did two years ago, why are they know thinking of spinning it off? Does this sound like a management team that has a vision for the future?Feels like they're vacillating back and forth, trying to decide what direction they want to go. It only costed them $85 billion for the last new strategy, how much is this one going to cost. And this is the type of management you want to tie your wagon too? Remember, the guys at the top have nothing to lose by playing these games. They're already millionaires so they can walk away and still live great lives if the whole thing falls apart. I might still sell Puts here because it's a money maker but I wouldn't touch T stock with a ten foot pole."
"For those who holds AT&T just for the dividends, this seems like very bad news. ATT say the expect to pay 8 BUSD in dividends, which is half of what they pay today (per year). they will reduce debt by 43 BUSD, but of the total or more than 160 BUSD they have in debt, this will only reduce it by aprox 25 %. The interest they pay today, is 8 BUSD/year, so simplifying, it will go down to 6 BUSD, i.e. reducing interest paid by 2 BUSD. In short, dividends will be cut in half, by 8BUSD, and only reduce debt interest payments by 2 BUSD. In short, from a dividend point of view, this does not look good at all. It may be however, that the operations, and business part of the deal, is better, since ATT can concentrate in the carrier business, and the Warner media can focus on their business. Let's hope so."
T is going to 50 plus
Almost back to 30. Somebody wants to own it !!!
Go T
"Your management is responsible for supporting movements that will destroy your investment, the value of your dollars, and your freedoms."
Solid performance and an even better two quarters to come.
Hopefully it closes above $31.
"Love all the financial experts here on Yahoo MB , bunch of Been in T for over 25 years with the DRIP, like getting a HUGE quarterly allowance "
Stanley on CNBC RIGHT NOW.
per cnbc interview this morning looks like overall divi won't be maintained
359 million worldwide box office for Godzilla vs Kong. Probably a billion dollar movie during normal times. That's not even mentioning how many people the movie lured to sign up for HBO Max. You see what Time Warner can do for this company? I sure do.
OH NO !Did You JUST SEE THEDIVIDEND ANNOUNCEMENT !I Didn't Either.....But I MADE YA LOOK !
"Is T heading for a close below $31? There are now 10,189 open $31 calls, 13,068 open $31.50's and 29,994 open $32's that will all expire worthless today if the stock closes below $31."
Senior management need to go!Not a clue!In a very short period they have decimated shareholder value.
Cramer THE SHILL is working hard for his employer Comcast bashing the AT&T deal.He’s just jealous
"Most of companies cutting dividends were forced when operating conditions getting worse or economy forcing companies to do so. T found that it is of investors best interest to focus on growth that demands for capital spending. Cutting divvies is a plus (since that is the ""bearish"" argument against AT&T).Resetting divvies cycle is certainly making AT&T great again.. With that, AT&T can appreciate with PE like CMCSA, (or even DIS pe of 40) or even TMUS with pe of 50..Make sense to me."
Pat: Did you sell your entire postion in T?
Barons says two different numbers$17.11 and $25.00Both of these possible scenarios are pretty far from where we are today.
Expect earnings beat. Don’t believe the hype. Stimulus money will boost sales. There will be strong growth next earnings. Manipulation of stock price. Big dogs loading up!
What a stock lol.
"43% marginal tax on capital gains?!? Geez, say goodbye to innovation & risk-taking. Markets will crash if this actually gets bullied through like so many Dems. proposals."
"For every seller, there is a buyer. Remember that."
"Please drop a lot so I can buy more at a discount, or please don’t drop so my current position can stay green lol. Don’t know what I prefer"
T mgmnt is not giving enough info for me to make a decision. Am I missing something?
Bought the low today...
"I have been reading coversations for 3 days now, and I have concluded no one knows nothing, just guessing !"
"T is a great stock, and is on it's way to better things."
Superior deal for T. Compete with Netflix and Disney now!
"29.99, As Yogi Berra would say, Déjà Vu all over again."
"Seriously though, how will this work? If you have 10,000 shares of T, how many shares will you get of the new company? May be worth a  in a poke under 30/share."
How will the Discovery news affect the SP on Mon?
Warren Buffet just said he thinks this is a Great deal for Shareholders..
I feel like a passenger on the Titanic
Great Company once Spin out happens in 2022 shares should be 20$ before I step in and scoop some . Remember they still indirectly own DIRECT TV AND NEW CO IT BECOMES AND WARNER NEW CO THEY OWN SO IF THESE COMPANYS FLOURISH ATT WILL BENIFIT STILL ALSO IF NEW CO DOES AQUISTIONS IT WONT BE HEAVILY LOOKED AT OR DENIED LONG T . THE BIG PICTURE IS ATT IS ALSO SPINNING OUT DEBT AND GOING BACK TO ROOTS WHILE STILL OWNING GOOD ASSETS
"Morningstar still finds T 'Attractive':AT&T Continues to Post Solid Customer Growth During Q1;Shares AttractiveAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 22 Apr 2021""AT&T’s push to add customers showed during the first quarter, with solid wireless, broadband, and HBOMax gains. The firm also increased network investment plans for the year, though it did so in a way(using vendor financing) that will cause reported capital spending to decline somewhat, allowingmanagement to maintain its $26 billion free cash flow target. AT&T stressed that it is trying to avoidoveremphasizing financial metrics to instead make prudent long-term investments. The increasedspending appears to be going into the wireless network to ensure that the firm takes full advantage ofthe C-band spectrum deployment, doing other work at the same time. Our fair value estimate remains$36, and we believe the stock is attractive. AT&T pulled in 2.1 million gross postpaid wireless phone customers during the quarter, up about 15%from a year ago and topping Verizon, likely for the first time in a decade. Customer defections alsodeclined sharply. As a result, AT&T added 595,000 net postpaid phone customers, also its best start to ayear in a decade. However, revenue per customer continues to decline amid aggressive promotionalefforts, down 2.8% year over year, which will likely prove the worst of the three major U.S. carriers.Total wireless service revenue increased 0.6% year over year, the best result since the start of thepandemic, and management still expects growth will accelerate through the year, implying stablepricing from here. In addition, wireless segment EBITDA increased slightly versus a year ago, despiteheavy customer additions and phone upgrades""."
"HBO max needs a back button in the app when you are trying to cast it from your phone. I click cast, and I'm forced to either cast or leave the app and restart it. If there was a back button after you click the cast button, I wouldn't have to restart the app when I accidentally click it."
"Looks like they took business away from Netflix it’s a shame they didn’t announce that they were going to dispose of Cnn, At any rate it appears that it’s now a peace of mind a purchase on any dip as I expect their revenue growth which was only expected to be at 1% and they turned in 2.7 to continue to accelerate throughout this year I think it’ll gradually see Wall Street warm up to the value that the company represents relative to the broader market and hopefully within the next 12 to 18 months will see mid 40’s"
If you bot ATT at $30 in 1997 and went into a coma and woke 24 years later you collected a ton of dividends but zero cap gain. Great stock if you live to 150.
I’m out. Goodbye
6.8 million shares on uptick at close. Nice!
It's amazing....The Leader in all communications and the powerhouse of streaming and huge cash flow and it refuses to go up. My opinion is fire the entire Board of Directors and get this gem moving Up!!!!!!
Clue: All the talking heads talking about AT&T merger with Discovery has a smile and a gleam in their eyes.
One of my buddies at a major fund says that we can really open at $24 tomorrow. Why won’t they call off this nonsense?
"If there was ever a company that cries for new leadership, it's T. Hard to believe this recent faux pas. Clearly a consortium of high reputation diplomas holders who no idea how to run a company. Most important mantra for executives: ""Create and maintain shareholder value!"". The suits at T must have cut that class."
"I'm confused - after the deal is done, who owns the shares for 71% going to T, the company AT&T or AT&T shareholders"
Can she breakout over $32.00 holdel?
I was just in this for the dividend. was content with the stock price going nowhere. Maybe now I'm out...
"Let's see, I can leave my money in the bank and get ,005% interest or invest it in T and get over 6%. Seems like a no brainer to me. Nice pullback today to pick some up..Good luck to all..."
"Funds are buying againWhy would anyone sell their shares to them when things are looking so good,"
10 million offered at 32...a wall
There she blows
Is the selling finally over or will more selling take place now that it's over $30 in the premarket?
Listening to Comcast owned CNBC trashing the T deal is hilarious .I hope you all are understand who your watching now .They all do what they are told ! All of them .
"Exciting company to own in my opinion. Can't wait to find out how many shares of the new streaming company I am going to own. BTW, there is rumors that Viacom / CBS is now in play and this guy in charge of Discovery, Zaslav, has had his eyes on that company for a long time. Also, remember that dividend yield depends on the price you bought the stock at. Some of you who bought AT&T below $30 are still going to get close to a 4% yield after the merger. Also do some research on a guy named John C Malone. He is the largest shareholder in Discovery and a billionaire mogul in the media business. He obviously had to sign off on this."
is there a date when we would get shares of the new company
T will be at $32 by the end of this month. Guaranteed.
"NFLX numbers are saying HBO MAX is taking customers from NFLX Just like I said to was. The T monster is now growing . VZ numbers are going to says T is taking customers from VZ Yhis T monster is now growing LOL,LOL,LOL"
Hopefully a majority of the Income investors sold in last three days into a declining market none the less. Reason starting to take place. Although I'll miss my healthy quarterly dividend all that matters is my portfolio account balance. I like T now more a week ago. Let's see what the future holds! Holding steady!!
"To Gov Kate Brown: I haven’t, and won’t be, getting the jab. And thank you for holding hostage restaurants and businesses until everyone plays your game, even though you’ve already cancelled future hallmark parade events in Portland (not that you could pay ME to spend money in downtown Tentland anymore). I’m young, I’m healthy, I worked this whole time without taking your free money handouts, and no one I know EVER got this sickness. Keep your hands off my pocketbook and your nose out of my health records."
What did I said yesterday on this post. Sell before you get hurt!Mr. Stanky cut dividend in half and bankrupted all the true believers in the company.also Mr. Stanky lied on CNBC month ago when he said the Dividend is SAFE...lied!!!!!
How can a telecom TMUS traded with PE of 50. (with debt over sales)? is it growing super fast?I don't care what you people are crazy.. But that is just my opinion.
"If T doesn't go thru with the deal, there is a 1.8B fee. Haven't we been here before? Just throw it on the pile of debt."
This stock better stay green all day or I’m calling the cops
Buying as much as I can premarket. Dividend will never be cut. Will NEVER sell my shares. Don’t let them scare you out.
What does this mean for shareholders and our dividend?
No faith in Stinky! Did a lousy job giving shareholders much needed info. Example- if i own 100 shares of t how many shares of the newco will i get? Might not be such an exodus if he laid it out for us!
"Jim Cramer, if you want to bash ATT just on debt issue, you should look at what TMUS debt to sale ratio. it is over 120% of sales."
"Was 39 less than two yrs ago. I’d say it’s better positioned now, so....."
Over 10% T stock price decline since last Friday at market closing. Ouch....
I sold yesterday! 
"With interest rates at historic lows, if you don't have debt, you're doing it wrong. Ex: spy up over 18% in last year. HELOC rates are under 4%. That's 14% on the spread."
Finally some good news!
So we will get new shares in the new company. T+newco=what???. Any ideas?
You can't fight facts.ATT has found a way to convert gold into lead.
Safe dividend? Now you know why stocks message boards are cesspools.
I love this stock.
Never see the $29's again that's for sure. What a stock lol.
Mention often markets are overpriced. Perhaps I am wrong but do believe inflation & Covid are real concerns. Read an article that some work from home employees have zero interest in returning to the office and that’s a morale issue companies need to address
"Based on the comments here and the reversal of the stock price, people are beginning to understand that judging the value of the Discovery deal based solely on what's going to happen with the dividend is a lopsided analysis. Sellers are completely missing their potential gain from owning a portion of the media company. Level heads usually make better decisions."
T shareholders get 71 % of the new company on top of T shares with a lower div. correct?
If the market collapses unfortunately I feel T will follow it way down. Be careful.
The purchase of Warner didn’t add one penny to the dividend. Now the spin-off merger will cut it by at least half according to the math . What a crock!
T threw old investors under the bus.
"This feels like the type of thing that could've just been done cleaner. There seem to be very few that even understand how to value the deal, because they don't have all the details and the deal is complex. They could've just sold off the Turner pieces w/ cnn, tbs, sports, etc.....and kept hbomax and its warner library. That would've cleaned up the balance sheet and shrunk the company in an effort to better focus it. Or maybe just have sold all of warner media, rather than merge. Just seems like there could have been a better deal to be had. I understand stankey felt he wasn't getting the credit for the media portion of the co., but the solution seems to have been poorly structured. Everything is always so dang complicated. Took 2 yrs to get time warner done, and even then they weren't ready to release hbomax when the deal was cleared. The whole xandr thing being absent from strategy and earnings when it was touted as a benefit to the twx deal. Ok, I'm just spewing now.....I'm really mad."
"Stankey must GO. Where was the DO NOTHING, BOD to put a STOP to all this mess before it came to this. This management team at ATT can now add LIAR to their resume, respect to the dividend. Stankey hurt a LOT of good retired people who relied on the T dividend. Stankey MUST be held ACCOUNTABLE !!!!"
Has anyone heard from the SEC since their 2007 mistake? Do they even exist anymore?
Every fund is dumping since dividend is Cut in half
Going to be interesting to see how Institutions and MFs and Hedge Funds deal with it. It was all a POWER PLAY TO CONTROL THE MEDIA DURING TRUMPS PRESIDENT TO HELP DEFEAT THE BEST PRESIDENT IN OUR LIFETIME.
"Should have sold earlier. Dividend cut, I am out. It is never good when company cuts the div. Putting my money elsewhere."
#$%$ stock
I know of no situation where a spinoff has been advantageous. If anybody knows of any please post. https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanboyar/2020/01/17/spinoffs-have-dramatically-under-performed-how-to-profit-from-them/?sh=11e1fdac7d0f
"I have been saying for many months that Warner/DIRECTV should go to reduce debt; it looks like AT&T may have found a way out by making it a separate public company that they can divest over time through share sales. This APPEARS to be a long way around to debt reduction but it should get there. One question remains, can they get at least $85 billion over a reasonable period of time? I know some people on this board have reacted very negatively to my suggestions, especially around CNN's poor viewership which equals lost advertising dollars; but are they in the business of creating shareholder value or what.I am sure I will get pinged again, but I still believe this a good move; long term."
anyone done the math on how many shares you would receive?.. with a valuation and % each company owns someone should have figured a ballpark in shares received
".. what did i tell you..?well, the deal is next year, so still get 7% for at least 4 quarters for today price.. good deal here now."

"If you love the dividend so much, then know that the YIELD of T will not likely be cut in half. Yes, total dividend distributions will fall, but T stock price will also fall. And the lost value will be made up by the new Warner stock. So what you do is you sell your new Warner shares and put that back into the cheaper T stock. Yield should still be 5% plus and you should have more $ invested, because the value of the separate companies should be higher than the current combined entity."
"Can anyone tell me, if I own 1000 share of T, how many shares of the new company will I get? Thanks"
"This is the worst run company in the whole world. First the TMobile screwup, then the DirecTV screwup, and now this? It's like the CEO and board care about nothing but how much money they can set on fire while still keeping their jobs for some inexplicable reason."

"Funny story, my new Edward Jones fin lady was trying to get me to buy back AT&T stock just 2 weeks ago. Think it is about time to make a change."

"Will the Longs on AT&T get new shares of Discovery from spin off? Is this information out there yet? Thanks, in advance."
warner media is an albatrosshaven’t we seen this ‘movie’ before
"Surprised no one mentioned that the Friends Reunion is finally set for release. It's 5/27. I love that because we'll have a potential catalyst for another quarter.....king kong and WW1984 before it. Friends could give our q2 subscriber growth a nice bump. I'm telling you, I watched a very short teaser on youtube for the show, and people are absolutely CRAZY when it comes to Friends. People talking about shedding a tear just for the teaser. For any Friends fan who doesn't have hbomax, this will for sure be a must for them."
People hold this because of the divvy. Its not in any major growth sectors anymore. Why own when you can get a better divvy rate elsewhere?
Sold at $30.95 before x div.Just bought back at $29.94.Turned 52 cents into a buck : )
So what did Jason Kilar do to tick off his one source of Income. I thought he was on the right track w CGI Kong and Justice League were major hits. Dam what are these guys thinking. Unless it's the 5G auction and TMOB is eating somebody's lunch.. Wow just wow I never bought in yet. You better not mess up my Verizon... I'll come down there in Alamo city TX
I'm troubled over this latest AT&T venture. A cut in dividends? For those of us who have hung in investing in T watching the stock become stagnant & at times at a downturn over bad investment choices with DirecTV etc... now it seems we're at a crossroad. The only thing that kept me around hoping for a better future was the dividend.
2 upgrades today per Barrons
"AT&T is now a Trillion dollar stock, you just don't realize it yet. The power of Amazing content in a frictionless streaming world is about to send T to the Moon!"
"Classic case of ""cobbler stick to thy last"". Instead of losing billions on DerelictTV they could have invested in AAPL stock. Oh well, time to play 5G catch up before TMUS eats their lunch on that too."
"So about 400 million shares traded over the past two days out of 7.2 Billion. Retail owns half the float. Down another 5% today. Smooth landing here is unlikely. Expect T to over correct as Mom and Pop throw in the towel over the next few days. Value is not compelling, Discovery is trading poorly, T management is poor and VASTLY overpaid particularly in light of the dismal deal history and now that the strategy is a low growth wireless company. I will only look if it gets to low $20's."
Dividend will be CUT in HALF!!!!!!!
What happens to the dividend until this deal closes?My guess is that it will stay at $1.02 / qtr.
Disappointing job numbers this morning should have Negative affect on the market which means even more people looking for a solid Company that pays out good dividends
I Keep Adding <3 Have fun bea
Cramer changing his tune on T
"Saw my dividend payment yesterday. It feels like paycheck time. Chiching!. I call this stock old reliable, and a good one to have in my portfolio."
"Yesterday I commented that I saw no reason the dividend needed to be cut. That comment did not age well. Just over a month ago, management indicated the dividend was safe."
Decided to hold here. Like the prospects of a somewhat delivered T and owning a newco that momentum investors may run way up.
"Am i reading this correctly they lost 80 billion in shareholder value with DTV and TWX, and how many of that BOD is still working ? Should some be held accountable for this fiasco,,, And now the dividend gets cut,"
Retirees sell NOW
AMC is up over 30% today because of Kilar's statements that WarnerMedia will be having theater releases for decades to come. T should be up 20% today on Kilar's talk.
Up on a down day! Plus it's Friday.
10 pinnochios for randal stevenson fortner CEO and the current CEO who lied to shareholders about the growth potential of the media assets just 3 weeks ago. LIARS
I’m glad I sold 2/3 of my AT&T position last year and bought ABBV.￼ I wish I sold 100 percent.
"For what it’s worth, Stephanie Link on CNBC just recommended T n recently bought it. Hyped the div. n recent appearance of Mr. Stankey last week, along with recent increase in membership.?Can’t hurt, I don’t think."
ATT CEO couldn't lead a pack of girl scouts to an ice cream parlor.
"Dont feel as bad today, everything is takeing a beation today !"
T is a buy and hold stock. it moves up and down but the dividends keep on coming. good luck to all.
Yahoo business had mentioned about the divy getting cut? Any knowledge on this?
I am not clear on this deal/ Will we shareholders get spin off stock in the new company or will we merely own it as that equity is absorbed into ATT? Thanks I prefer the SIPO but GE did a deal and shareholders purported benefit was ownership of GE which now owned the part of the new company.
Market starting to stall. T continues to disappoint. An eight grader would have managed T better than their last couple of CEO’ssold out yesterday
"Amazing, finally got a deal that moved this dead stock and shareholder don’t like it. They’d rather stay in a value trap for life cashing a dividend of 6% while the market goes up 10-15% each year."
"I am not sure what is going on, but the price keeps going down."
T will benefit from the Infrastructure plan. This company is so undervalued now....
"Stankey was on CNBC on earnings day. I bought more after he answered this question. The question was, ""how can you maintain a 6+% dividend""? His answer ""we will increase the stock price which will bring it in line""...laughing while he said that. That was one stankey comment to make when he knew darn well his dividend investors were a few weeks away from getting hurt."
I said yesterday I cannot believe there won’t be a lawsuit by investors when the dust settles on this one
"All the people that want a divy are dumping and as soon as they get done, then this goes right back up to $33-$35. It is worth at least that for the breakup."
"It's going to be interesting to see where T closes this Friday. There are 52,800 open $32 Calls that will either expire worthless (if T closes at $32 or lower) or will be exercised (if it closes above $32)."
Going to $37
Looks like the divy is protecting the $32 level. Should be great support! Buying more!!!!!
Why so much hate its a good deal. People with experience will run the combined venture much better
Still getting paid 6.6% until the company is divided.
Retest of lows coming soon
"It is sheer lunacy that opex today can move this down toward the 32 strike. Options should be illegal, this was on a roll and would have continued if not for the options! Rant over!"
Morning Homegamers !Looking A Little GREEN PRE MARKET !You Know What They Say !
"ok, now i'm really lost. thought i had this nailed. a spinoff is a transaction that moves assets of one company into another, newly formed company. the stockholders of the company doing the spinoff are granted shares in that company, and the ""old"" company ceases to consolidate it on their books or run it. This was easily understood in the disca deal. So why did Stankey say this:He also argued that AT&T was not getting out of the entertainment business entirely, noting that it still would control a 71% stake in the new, as yet unnamed entity."
It’s official by closing over $31.89 we are now in the twilight zone buy buy buy. The stock goes higher on the charts￼
Is it really happening? An uptrend?
T stock prices (not counting dividend) have been in decline since 2000 (21 years). That may say something about the appeal of T despite the management blunders. No real upside or catalysts that I can see. I sold my shares today after going long for 10 years. I actually thought 5G was going to save this company. Sigh.
What the frig. This was pushing $34 this morning. I give up
"Interesting to watch this. There are still about 25,000 open $32 strike open Calls set to expire today. The Market Maker would like to see a close below $32 to have those open Calls expire worthless. Is the closing price horse race on again and will the stock continue to drop during the day ever closer to that magic $32 number? I don't know but it sure is interesting to watch this unfold."
Load up this will make you rich! Buy the drip at the open! This is going up big time!
Until yesterday T had global growth (with HBO Max) and a secure dividend.Now T has no growth and has cut it's dividend in half.The new HBO/Discovery won't pay a dividend and will be loaded up with debt.Is this about right?
Down -15% WOW !
CNN viewership down 50 percent since election. Factual and funny.
ATT should say they’ve added a million billion new customers
You who are old enough to remember... PANIC never pays off!
"Strong Sell initiated by Kaufman,Stephens,and Davis"
Dividend cut coming when this deal is consummated.
"This deal was a good deal for T shareholders. They lose half the dividend yield, but in exchange they get to keep the T stock and get shares in the new company. The new company will be able to expand the media side of the company better on their own than a combined entity. The ceo thinks that new media company will be able to command a higher share multiple than exists currently in T stock. It's a good deal but presented poorly."
Should have put some of that cash in TWTR for a nice flip like I said. Quick trades is the name of the game in the market for now.
Great Deal! Loving it! Tired of stagnant share price in the 30’s for decades.New Time ! GROWTH!!!
Sold my position and redistributed b/w AB & TWO.
"This stock was at $27, 3 months ago when supposedly the yield was to be maintained. All telecoms in Europe are trading at extremely low multiples. Not sure why highly indebted T was trading at $33."
Seen wall st tricks over and over ..They just pulled it on T...They want your shares..so they pump negative news..etc to get you to sell and then WHAM..it goes up!!! ...I EVEN DOUBT T WILL EVEN CUT THE DIVIDEND BY 50%...I DOUBT IT..watch and see!
"when will the dividend cut take place ; now, or after the merger in mid 22?"
"Hubertus ; Why Would You Sell Your , AT&T , Share's Knowing , That AT&T Stock Price Is Going To Be At $36.00 To $38.00 , In Just 1 To 2 Week's , And $40.00 Maybe A Week Or Two After ; And A Great Safe , 6.5% Dividend's ;"
That excitement was short lived 
"What did I say, Cramer, HAHAHA. He loaded up after bashing company. Now he's a firm believer and thinks its the best of the top 3 dogs due to its content. Lets see some new all time highs on the SP as we collect our 7%. Best wishes!!!"
"Well, I bought T at $29 last December and have earned the dividends twice. I figure I'll just stay in, watch and maybe buy more in the dip, and then watch it go back up. No big deal here. In the meantime, I'll be given shares of another company that I believe will do great things."
t is selling off like we lost all of time warner. dont we get 71 percent of the new company ???????????????/ looks like a win to me
Cramer works for T's competitor. Cramer's continuous bashing of T's management is borderline unethical. Period.
who watches cable??I stream all my TV and movies and use Youtube for contents
Vagapuke in the waiting room....
Keep buying guys
"Most posters here were so excited about HBO Max and it's potential. Kind of strange that you're not similarly excited about owning 71% of a combined HBO Max and Discovery. Plus your AT&T shares. You make no sense. Your divvy is not getting cut for a year until you have a chance to find out what those shares you are getting are going to be worth. Other than the stock dropping in price at the moment (PANIC), I see no reason to sell."
Will T holders get stock of the new company?
Not 1 but 2 companies....enough said.
"This morning, we saw greed (price skyrocketed) and then fear (selloff). Once the dust settles, real investors will review what this really means for shareholders."
Shooting to a well deserved destination $$ 35.0
T going to 26.. look at the charts I’m so glad I sold at 33.
"If the dividend is cut by 3%, we are talking about a loss to shareholders of close to 7 billion dollars not including the decline of the stock. Will the new company make up for this dividend loss plus the loss of value of T alone?"
"too bad little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff doesn't own any ATT common stock......and BRAGGING about $28.50 put options is all he can do......but the little CREEP said trading options are ""RISK-FREE"""
CEO J Stinky has done nothing to deserve a CEO role both he and Stevenson should be tarred and feathered
166 million shares dumped today and it is only down a couple of bucks?I think your Market Makers are swallowing up shares to maintain price stability.You know what that means ? Well all the inventory they take on will need to be cleared before the share can head back up.Tomorrow will be interesting to say the least.
"i’m 17 and bought my first shares of T a couple weeks ago, hoping to build my dividend snowball. i’m excited for the future of this company!"
I'm out with a gain....This has to be the worst upper management in any stock in the whole dang stock market! I mean these guys are the worst managers ever!
"Crazy that I'm getting to compound the daylights out fo AT&T. Should have about 80K shares by the time I'm 70, even if the stock averages around $ 35 for the next 20 years."
"Straight from the AT&T website:Transaction HighlightsThe combination will be executed through a Reverse Morris Trust, under which WarnerMedia will be spun or split off to AT&T’s shareholders via dividend or through an exchange offer or a combination of both and simultaneously combined with Discovery. The transaction is expected to be tax-free to AT&T and AT&T’s shareholders.In connection with the spin-off or split-off of WarnerMedia, AT&T will receive $43 billion (subject to adjustment) in a combination of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. The new company expects to maintain investment grade rating and utilize the significant cash flow of the combined company to rapidly de-lever to approximately 3.0x within 24 months, and to target a new, longer term gross leverage target of 2.5x-3.0x. WarnerMedia has secured fully committed financing from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and affiliates of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC for the purposes of funding the distribution.The transaction is anticipated to close in mid-2022, subject to approval by Discovery shareholders and customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. No vote is required by AT&T shareholders. Agreements are in place with Dr. John Malone and Advance to vote in favor of the transaction.ht from AT&T Investor website:"
Will it test $13 a share or go lower like GE? I don't know
"The Phase 1 of COVID 1.0 is now going to be replaced with the Phase 1 of COVID 2.0Prepare accordingly for news cycles to slowly drift into the ""world is not gonna open for a while"" as the mutants ravage India and then its neighbors and make their way to the shores of a vaccine happy USA.Its a slow process like the last one. But it is in play right now."
"It's almost 40 years ,1982, when Judge Greene approved the breakup of ATT and this company hasn't once made a successful business decision. Most holders weren't even around then. This former Western Electric employee used his IRA plan to buy ATT stock. However with the disposal of Western Electric, this employee's holdings were converted into Lucent stock which no longer exists. Now all that ATT does is continue building a temple in Dallas to honor its failures."
"I have read that AT&T will be reducing the dividend in half, that may not be all bad if the combined merger with the 71% stake in Discovery makes up for the loss of the dividend. For us seniors who rely on the dividend this will be an adjustment, but the long term increase in the combined companies stock prices may make up for the loss of half of our dividend. This will be a long range bet but streaming is here to stay and personally I see higher stock prices for both and we the long holders will benifit greatly!"
"I wonder if we all will receive a share from the new company even those that the stock through a broker, so the shareholders will own 71% of the company but not AT&T itself will own those 71%"
Going higher! Lots of great news today! Future looking bright. I feel it will hit at least high 33's soon.
"I am so sorry for all of you who sold , I have 300 contracts that it will get to 32 in 120 days awww how tasty"
"Discover? who the heck pays to watch discover content. AT&T management seems to be eternally out of touch , as well as the assets they acquire. Who can forget the brilliant acquisition of AOL by Time Warner just when broadband was coming on. Now they are spinning off HBO MAX and the Warner content collection , just when these assets are poised to be worth a fortune and combining it with .... Discover????? Seems to me GOT, Harry Potter and Batman alone would catch a 50x multiple these days - (ie NFLX is higher and worth 200+B). I guess we can credit management for at least admitting they are too incompetent to realize the full value. I hope this Discover guy knows what he is doing."
"The real story, as it SHOULD be told:1) Prior AT&T management was incompetent. Made bad decisions. Weakened the company2) They still got paid big bucks for their incompetence3) Current management admits it was a major screw up4) Loyal shareholders will get screwed as a result, with a huge dividend cutWall Street fat cats are doing very well, thank you very much."
Buy one AT&T and get one NFLX for free...

The consensus price target for T is $29.97 (Yahoo). Are the analysts wrong or is T going to $40 as many on this board have predicted?
Here come the spammers --- again.
Inflation comes and goes but CNBC keeps lying to the public.
I guess T is winning the steaming wars. HBO Max No 1 in March. Who knew ?
Wondering if my April 16 $31 covered calls will get assigned today...5 weeks ago I would have said I hope so...
"New here, is Cheetah a useful tool or just a tool?"
This is a no brained I like collecting my dividends
"No patent protection for Pfizer? Next, the commies will convert AT&T into their own Pravda. T shareholders made this happen."
The price reversal and plunge tells it all.
"The dividend reduction, and New T valuation should take place at the actual time of Warner spin off. The efficient way to get in is through T prior to the spin off. Because you will be owning both asset."
I thought that when they bought dish then time Warner that 5g would be company strength. Still hopeful but tough competition out there 
"Looking to scoop some at the open if it breaches $29, for a dead cat bounce"
"The transaction being discussed would use a tax-efficient structure and involve spinning WarnerMedia out of AT&T (T) and combining it with Discovery, the people said. AT&T (T) shareholders would own a significant stake in the combined company, they said."
"Listen to the Yahoo interview of Richard Gelfond, today....he is CEO of IMAX.... “very positive” about the merger and its potential....this is a win-win for all....don’t focus on a dividend cut, focus on T shareholders getting equity in 2 companies that will both pay decent dividends....you all need to calm down and see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow!!!!"
VIAC has the best value and growth potential of all streaming stocks. It is my single largest holding. I been holding T ever since they announced the move to hbo max. I think people will keep cord cutting and prefer streaming live tv and on demand content and content owners stand to benefit the most in this future environment of cord cutting. The combined media assets of this new merger company if they transition to live TV with their service will be a major deal. That's the potential here. Viacom combined with all their assets has the same potential but is even cheaper with less debt. If people are really fed up with T they should buy viac instead.
Didn’t expect so much downward pressure. Core business is strong
"I'd rather just have the phone and internet side of the company and good riddance to the media/entertainment stuff. For there are so many commercials, I think that the ""pay to be tortured with commercials"" media business will eventually die off or wither away--unless they pull a rabbit out of a hat. So, I'll undoubtedly sell my ""torture with commercials"" shares when the spinoff comes."
Jason Kilar was initially lambasted for his pandemic strategy. Now he's being hailed. Stankey appears to be a vast improvement at CEO. 5G will be a game changer. Fiber rollouts continue. Value stocks with hefty (and tax friendlier) dividends gaining steam. T is looking very good indeed.
T is now trying to model itself after Verizon and probably lower its dividend % to match. I hope it’s share price can match VZ as well. VZ and T IMO are now just 5g playsGood luck to all!
looks like it can't close beyond $33!!
People saying better to buy LUMN than T???
Within 2 weeks this will be over $35 from earnings date every stock goes up close to earnings strong buy and hold
Joe says free college.
final push to 30...
Working hard trying to hold$30. If it breaks $30 next stop is $26
This management team ran CNN into the ground!
Poor Cramer having to explain about Netflix and now today he'll need to explain why he was wrong about selling T. See moffat got a sad story in as well.
"Shame on AT&T: mislead investors by saying the dividend was a priory at current levels just very recently. I was a proud investor since 1976, no more."
Ohhhh yeaaaaaaa!!! You knew it was time to buy when every dumb retail investor was bearish earlier this week. Congrats longs. We got a nice income play. And this won’t own CNN anymore so a double bonus.

"As the Japanese used to say in the Original It's ""Go Zeer Ra!!"" Box officeMonday AM: Godzilla vs. Kong had a better than expected Sunday of $3.8M, off 38% from Saturday which puts the Legendary title’s second weekend at $13.88M, -56% for a running total of $70M. It’s conceivable that the monster fourthquel gets past $90M, and $100M wouldn’t be shocking"
"I find it funny...or perhaps perplexing...that so many of those who thought AT&T was wrong for not following Elliott Management's plans back in 2019, are now driving the stock down...all for pretty much following those very same plans! Tells you something about 'em - doesn't it? And if you're here strictly for the dividends, I understand your trepidation. But maybe there's something positive to be found in having a decent paying stock...more than you'd get at any bank...along with one that should supply strong growth. I sincerely hope everything works out for both you & Discovery shareholders. BTW - I've got a feeling this combo will come to fruition quite a bit sooner than expected."
"Well, well, well...the historically-very-accurate, US census #s had 154m voting in 2020, yet 158m votes were recorded. A difference of 4m votes. No fraud? Yeah, right!"
"Since the AT&T/TimeWarner merger, the ""marriage"" hasn't done much, if anything, to improve AT&T's stock price. So separating WarnerMedia from AT&T shouldn't be anything to worry about. However, the ""amicable divorce"" will free up AT&T to pursue its 5G telecom future while WarnerMedia gets a new start. Meanwhile, current AT&T shareholders will own BOTH."
We know the divvy will be reduced. We don’t know what the share price will be of the merged companies upon completion of the deal
Imagine selling the stock because of a half cut dividend that will pay for still for more than a year by ignoring the fact you will receive .71x NewCo shares per share after the deal is done in mid 2022.
TStill can't believe this happened so fast. HBO MAX and TWX GONE.......after spending months and months touting them. What a mess.
"Analyst's NotesAnalysis by Joseph #$%$ CFA, May 18, 2021ARGUS RATING: BUY? Reaffirming BUY and $38 target? AT&T is unwinding its WarnerMedia acquisition through a tax-free spinoff to shareholders and mergerwith Discovery.? The spinoff refocuses AT&T on its core U.S. wireless business and on the next-generation wirelessservices that may be enabled by its 5G network.? The Discovery deal is the second unwinding of a large AT&T merger in just a few months, as thecompany agreed to sell its DirecTV cable/satellite television distribution business in February.? We are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate of $3.19 and our 2022 forecast of $3.25.INVESTMENT THESIS We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $38.AT&T is unwinding its WarnerMedia acquisition through a tax-free spinoff toshareholders and a merger with Discovery. The spinoff refocuses AT&T on its core U.S.wireless business and on the next-generation wireless services that may be enabled by its5G network. The Discovery deal is a bitter pill for AT&T to swallow after it paid up forthe Time Warner assets; however, it is also probably the right decision as AT&T did nothave the financial firepower to compete in direct-to-consumer video streaming with thelikes of Netflix and Disney, rapidly invest tens of billions into its new 5G network, andprotect the dividend. That said, we still expect a dividend cut at AT&T after thecompletion of the deal (if not before), though management promises the yield will remainhigh. AT&T trades at a modest forward valuation premium to peers.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT&T made another about-face on May 17, agreeing to spin off WarnerMedia toshareholders in a tax-free deal and combine it with Discovery."
"It looks like the grown ups are back. The market completely misunderstood the Warner spin off deal. T shareholders still have a stake in Warner and will continue to have a stake in Warner. When the deal is complete, T shareholders will still own Warner, coupled with Discovery. The fools are out."
AT&T lied to Shareholders....It's exactly what occurred but they didn't want to end up like WorldCom. The auditors told the BOD you will go bankrupt so they for survival completely hurt the Shareholders and took a deal. They are in survival mode much like GE.
"Ceo coming on cnbc again, and for my next trick tell us how you bought dodge coin at .70 cents for shareholders"

GE all over again.
DIDVIDEND CUT or EliminationMeans SOON......$27 !
"What a bunch of idiots.. Not only does AT&T STILL own the Time Warner content, it actually owns even MORE content with Discovery (71% stake). ATT will still sell The Content carrot and get sticky customers for its cash cow services of mobile, phone, internet etc.Now it is about the only stock that will offer a steady, decent dividend AND have potential for exponential growth with the streamer multiple without the dividend ball and chains. Can't wait to get some cheap panic shares with the SAME dividend for 4 quarters AND get shares for the new MAJOR streamer company"
"Apparently t wants to be a growth company instead of a dividend king, I have two words for them, ha ha."
I thought VZ and T should swap their media assets to solve their problems. T takes yahoo and VZ buys CNN LOL...
T will likely have a good earnings and great hbo max subscribers growth! next week is earnings! lets go! lets break $30 and then $31 before earnings
This deal is great for T shareholders...... but if you are in T only for the dividends you are disappointed of course.
"Posted this 2 months ago, since then T's PPS has gained 4.7%... Yes, this sleeping giant is responsive, alive and well with much-improved vital signs rolling into earnings (and beyond)....""AT&T’s multi-billion $ Base Network/Infrastructure upgrades are complete, Content, IT Services, Entertainment, Cellular/5G build-out, Redundant Nationwide Fiber Loops, continued Asset Sales with Accelerated Debt-Reduction, First Net Build-Out, Rural Fixed Wireless deployment, HBO Max, AT&T TV and Hi-Cap 5G delivery just now heating-up. AT&T is quietly sitting at a $28.80 PPS, 15.4 P/E and 7.2% dividend, IMO this sleeping giant is due to awake very soon with a long-overdue vengeance"""
"Some people stayed on the deck of the Titanic until it was too late. I was smiling this morning and then dumped my 3,000 shares as the T ship starting listing. I don't often get it right that quickly. Looks like T will have a lot of retail shareholders caught unaware by this deal and the complete reversal of sentiment on the prospects for shareholders."
"I TOLD YOU !OK.....I Said.....WHEN T..... Went UP NICELY TODAY....I'd Be Back to SAY.......LONG 28,600 @ 28.72"
Best hour of news on television.
"According to a analyst report I read each T shareholder will get 15.40 for each share of T you own payable upon approval of the merger with Discovery stock. The new Discovery will be valued at $180B at the time of the distribution. The analyst put a enterprise value of $220B after the merger based on the average forward P/E of other media companies which is a 25% premium to what the T holders will get. CNBC reported yesterday that John Malone was a majority shareholder in Discovery and he converted all his B shares to A shares to show he was supporting the merger and won't block a future sale of Discovery which means the new company is already planning on selling itself after the merger. They said the companies being looked at as potential buyers are Apple, Amazon, and Google. Why sell T now because you will still get the $2 divy until the merger is approved and then you get a $15.40 divy per share next year and another nice profit when they sell to Bezos. I'm going to be adding more shares of T if it continues to drop but I think the last 3 days has been all options related and when they're done the institutional buyers will come in.."
Hard to get out now. Put a sell in at a limit price equal to the current bid and the bid immediately drops.
We need clarification from T if the 2.08 dividend will be maintained. I thought I read somewhere that it would be.
AT&T is going higher. My Analysts at dinner last night were very supportive of Doubling down on T for the long haul and the Dividend.....I sold some TSLA and listening...I AM LISTENING!!!!!!
"All the hate on a company that’s been around since 1882, sale, hold only time will tell, but I tell you this the company has been threw it all and still it stands"
"Without rehashing the mistakes made to get us to where we are, I suspect T will find support after the dividend cut at a price of about 26 which will be about a 4% dividend. I sold out at 32 and have been buying in the 28.5 range. That plus the stock in the new company seem to make this reasonable. I bought T for the dividend like most others but this path seems like getting most of the dividend back (considering that I now have more shares due to selling higher, buying lower) Also can roll the dice on the shares in the new company"
"The news is out. The dividend will be cut. We were hung out to dry, lied to, taken advantage of. Stankey is a dirt bag. He doesn't care because he makes tens of millions every year, not including the millions in stock options he gets."
This is what happens when you buy a stock not on performance or financials but PURELY for the dividend. Sometimes you get burned.
Keep buying load your truck
Yahoo has decided to control free speech.
"Looks like the table is now set for the Joe Biden correction for all the DEM witted things he has done and selling should start next week and be ugly because all the AI computers are running the same programs again. We will see how good they have fixed it for a flash crash, May 2010 flash crash was not caused by some kid in his basement it was caused by all the AI trading computers running the same programs , We are now at the stage again as the AI computers learn and adjust their programs more and more are now running the same programs. How you have some CASH to buy the gift that Wall Street is about to give you. No better time to have a Flash CRASH than when everyone thinks every thing is great and the economy is exploding"
There is not enough information to determine how many shares of the new company each T shareholder will get. T shareholders will own 71% of the new company is all that was communicated. Could be 71% of a $100B company issuing 200M shares or 71% of a $1 company issuing 100 shares.
T is holding up fairly well considering the rest of the market is down over well 1%.
Buy the stock now cause the airplane is ready to take off better take advantage of it
T basically changed completely in just 1 day as a company.
Is there any possibility or raising the dividend when reporting earnings in 2 weeks
"I remember the words when I was thinking of dumping T: “Give John Stankey time and he’ll turn the company around.” It was a retired Fortune 500 CEO talking. I decided to see if he was right. So far, so good."
I have netflix and haven't watch anything in months!!! #$%$ content.....while Disney is just for kids!!! Expect new stream to compete very well against these offerings!!! BUY T

Dividend aristocrat my bass.
Thank God not $29.99. I am touching myself tonight for sure.
News doesn't detail what the share ratio will be in the merger. It appears Discovery will be the one exchanging cash and debt not T.
Yesterday it was a great deal. Today it's a big mistake. Can't win with T
You'll see a big bounce at open and slowly retrace some as investors react to immediate news and then sit back with profit taking as long termers adopt a wait-and-see what the details and the end result of this merger. My immediate impression is this is great for T shareholders. But the devil is in the details. The entire purpose of the merger is to make AT&T/Discovery competitive with Netflix & Disney in the streaming environment. .
2 years of divy. poof. gone. 3 years of divy gone if u factor in divy cut. what a great mgmt team.
$20 stock with dividend cut. I got out of ATT as soon as there was wind about Time-Warner deal. ATT is a boring company that collects monthly fees on services that stay constant. What were they thinking in tackling a dynamic media industry? ATT does not have the DNA to compete in a dynamic world.
It looks like AT&T IS NEVER A BUY according to analyst. Fortunately I hardly ever listen to analyst.
From an income investor's standpoint;I'd just as soon not watch how this plays out. Lots of good CEF's out there that pay a good dividend. Telecom companies have to keep reinvesting billions just to keep up with rapidly changing technology. 6G will cost another 50B in a few years. TMUS doesn't pay a dividend and they are way out in front of the others.
I'm glad I got out as soon as I heard the dividend cut. It defeats the whole purpose of buying it in the first place
Over 31 in pre market! GL
"Lube up guys. Look at revenue projections for 2022-2024. ->The new company (which has yet to be officially named) will become the third-largest media company behind Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). It will focus on content, not transmission or+ technology. It will have media brands like CNN, HBO Max, March Madness, TLC, HGTV, Animal Planet, TNT and many others.The combined company projects it will produce ~$52 billion in revenue and ~$14 billion in adjusted Ebitda in 2023. It also expects $15+ billion of DTC (streaming) revenues in 2023 and cost savings of $3 billion. The combined company intends to use free cash flow to reduce leverage from five times at the closing of the deal to three times within 24 months.AT&T will use the money obtained from the transaction to deleverage immediately and then focus on 5G wireless and optical fibre roll-out, coming full circle and becoming a pure telecom again."
"Wow, FANG is over $87 today. It was $73 and change a week ago on April 22 when I sold Puts. The oils, one of the most beaten down segments during the pandemic, are on the move and there's plenty of upside left!"
"T, the new commodity company. Dial tone and internet. What else?"
I guess I'm the only one who voted against the entire BOD.
"The $67 billion acquisition of DirectTV. In 2015, AT&T bet on cable TV as a way to amass customers whom it could eventually convert to streaming. But DirectTV bled subscribers as customers cut the cord, and AT&T unloaded a stake in the company last year to TPG that valued DirectTV at about a third of its acquisition price. The deal also cost AT&T about $50 million in advisory fees, according to Refinitiv.The $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. In 2018, Stephenson called the deal a “perfect match,” but the combined group struggled to invest in its telecom business while also spending enough to compete with the entertainment specialists at Netflix and Disney. Three years later, AT&T is now spinning off the company so it can (re)focus on its quest for 5G market share. AT&T paid $94 million in advisory fees to put the two companies together and an estimated $61 million to split them apart."
"As one of those retirees, the dividend is the main reason for owning the stock. As those in retirement know, income production is important. ATT has made so many costly errors in the past few years. You can't blame anyone who has been around for a while for being skeptical about this one."
T is starting to look like AOL did before the shiot hit the fan.
"Don't sell people. If you own 100 shares of T, by next year you will still own 100 shares of T, plus 71 shares of Warner Discovery Media. Both will be poised for growth. The dividend reduction will not be forever, just until T recover and become stronger."
Stankey is the best!!!
"There are 14,881 of Apr 30 $31.50 Calls set to expire tomorrow so the likelihood of T closing below $31.50 tomorrow is high. This is an observation and not a prediction."
"ALL You'll Shortly See Is EVERY Lawyer In Town.....Lawsuits Galore.....ALL The 'NEWS' You Will Start To See When You Hit Your 'NEWS' Brokerage Button On TWill Be LAWSUIT, LAWSUIT LAWSUIT.. Management REPEATEDLY SAID..DIVIDEND IS SAFE........The Liability Here SEEMS HUGE !"
This whole deal is to paper over the financials. Nothing changes but shuffling stuff on the balance sheet. T will still own 71% of DISCA.
Doing all the right things
Notice Cramer didn’t say it was a bad deal they made he just is using the elderly as pawns to knock T
"I bought back half of AT&T, not much for divy but for valuation."
I'm not selling AT&T no matter what...However you break down the assets of the company should have a $400B capitalization...I realize the dividend will be cut regardless of if both companies have dividends...But the company is just to darn valuable and Stanky had to do it because MR Market is just so confused about this stock it would have never been fairly valued...Stock is a $45/per share stock and all the bears did this.
T broke above 1995 stock highs. Congratulations. 25 years.
What if the new company is worth $20#$%$ inception and T trades at $20 with $1.25 divvy. You would have made mondo money when the spin off happens in a year.Just sell your shares and buy some other company with a 7% divvy after the spin off. You'll come out ahead.
I see continued downward pressure on T's stock price until the complete separation of media to discovery WHY:Dividend oriented ETF's which have held T for the dividend will continue to dump the stock for the foreseeable future. WAIT
"GETTING close to a buy.TRADE VOLUMNE going down which is good.IT might test $28.78 again.KEEPING MY POWDER DRY,BUT GETTING CLOSE.I will have to hold for 3 months.DIVIDEND cut not exciting."
"Been a T investor since i was 21 years old. Now i'm 30 and yes it's been steady dividends however with limited growth, an inept CEO, dividend now cut in half, time to sell. Verizon is calling my name."
The market does not seem to like the deal. T approaching $30.
Good afternoon T ~ chicken wings on the charcoal now with lots of hummus and veggies on the side . Markets in a weird place right now and Covid is still a real concern
"Just released - Netflix had it's worst quarter for sign-ups. It seems HBOmax, Paramount, etc..... are gaining customers. If T drops because of that bad news, I'm loading up. Any bad Netflix news means someone else is gaining bigtime market share. I think HBOmax had a great quarter and with Dune and Matrix 4 coming later, I think the next 6 months will be positive for news flow."
My firm bought AT&T at 26.94 pps so yes we sold immediately but Clients and Friends We were on top of this nightmare today and you will not be another GE Shareholder. We have liquidated Assets in in AT&T and we were shocked they cut the Dividend and we our safe.
do you think the new company will pay a dividend looks like it will have good cash flow
"Strong sell initiated by Larry, Moe and Curly ..."
"I'm clearly out of sync with the market's expectations of T.The quarter exceeded my expectations by A LOT and I thought we would push into the Mid 30s with that kind of news. I was not expecting $40 or anything crazy, but EPS beat by 10%, Rev. beat, HBO Max subscriptions beat by a good bit and Mobile Post Paid additions was meaningfully above expectations. Customer churn was low. I think they beat every analyst expectation on every metrics.You can never classify them as ""Guaranteed"" customers going forward, but they all signed up for monthly Mobile or HBO Max contracts. Money flowing in to T month after month going forward with all those additions.I thought we'd get a multi day 5-10% push higher then consolidate around $35 ish.......The Dividend is awesome, but wow this stock is hard to hold at times. Even when the news is GOOD....Grrrrr"
Att in talks with discovery networks to combine assets
"AT&T Is Cutting Its Dividend, what boneheads, incompetent management, time to dump my T-shares.The dividend is the only reason I kept AT&T. Time to move on to other dividend stocks like Verizon and others."
..good bye AT&T..and ty for the last 5 years..
If I buy shares today will I get shares from the spin off?
Man there are some Debbie downers on this board... Unbelievable.
"The dividend will apparently be cut, but not for at least another year when the deal is actually approved. And dividends are zero sum anyway. You get paid a .50 cent dividend but the stock price is reduced by .50 cent the next morning anyway. So it's zero sum. Brokerages charge no fees to buy/sell anymore. So if you need ""income"" you can sell a couple shares every quarter. It is seriously no different than receiving a dividend. The only difference is the illusion the dividend provides. Which is the idea that you still own the same number of shares you always did. And well yes, technically you do but the value is much less after the dividends are cut from the stock price. So it's really a wash."
Now the question is.......when will this hit a 'fresh' 52 week LOW?
Expect a 7% drop in share price with the loss of the dividend. If not more.
"Holding all my shares for at least a year. We'll get the full dividend this year and with the new company shares added as part of the deal, that will probably equal the ""usual"" dividend in 2022. My issue is if it drops to -26, do I add more?"
this company has 150 billion dollar in debt. it is almost equal to its 80% market value right now.. the only thing that sustain this company is that it is making a net income that could sustain the dividend to the share holders. in my opinion the value of att should go down to 20$ dollar per share. sorry to say that.
"I probably shouldn't say this however maybe ""nice Phil"" is right == what a CC: over on DiSH. Some things that made me understand... TMOB is trying hard to get rid of CDMA == which most cell phone work on today == Verizon is saying no not yet == also the fact they have unlimited bandwidth to go partner w AWS Amazon. Wow great call kinda funny it'sover on DiSH board which is COMPETISH! if anyone cares. ta ta."
What amazes me is that management loses $80B in 3 years via bad acquisitions and they still have their jobs.
Think I bought too early. If the new T is valued exactly like VZ now w same dividend yield the share price would be mid-25s. Obviously more complicated than that but I am not expecting appreciation here.
"Out at 33.50, starting to get get back in, 1K shares at 29.37, will dollar cost this thing and see where it goes down the road. Stankey on CNBC a month ago, Lied, said the Div. was safe. All the selling is the Long Term Holders Like Me, 24 Years of work and then blindsided. They should be put in jail for what they did. Do You Know how many retirees this move has effected, Karma not Cramer will take care of them. And please stop with this Idiot Cramer Guy, Cramer had nothing to do with all the long time holders who started investing in this company many many years ago. We did it because of the dividend, to have that money for when we retired. They really got us."
CORRECTION WAY OVERDONE=BOUGHT LOTS OF T=EXPECT SIGNIFICANT GAIN ON TUES. 5-17-21
Here in OH we knew exactly what to do. ha. gov is right. Where is Cheetah my gosh? lol
UBS upgraded T to a buy rating today with a $35 price target. Let's go T!
"I'm tired of hearing people complaining about the dividend cut. Wake up, the day they cut the dividend is the day you get 71% of the new company. A company that will have better management and an opportunity for huge growth."
5G growth and video streaming growth... too cheap...
New 52 week high to come in May. Onward and upward!
Unemployment numbers were way off and inflation is real . Markets are overpriced except dish :) happy Friday T . Happy Mother’s Day weekend
I had to reboot my pc this morning. I couldn't believe T was up 1 and 1/4 in premarket
I hate to see yahoo analysis pick up intentionally vulgar headlines. what AT&T did is the right move that will guide the biz to the right direction!! No doubt!!
T will maintain its 7% divvy. Only the stock will be valued at $20 + DISCA HIGH Growth shares.
"ppl hear div cut and freak out, then note the stock doesn't grow...which do you want? but really...do the math...you're getting 5yrs of current dividend yield up front while reducing debt and improving flexibility and growth for both segments, wireless and streaming. your dividend cut won't actually be effectively cut for 5years, and by then both segments should have grown more than they would have otherwise, further offsetting any cuts to the dividend. stop focusing on what is lost, and see what is gained."
"Reading the comments, and we don't have any details, everyone is worrying about debt and seeing T get out of the entertainment business. My only concern is the stock price and the dividend. I don't care what T sells, I just want to see my investment grow. I bought T-Mobile in the 60's 2 years ago and it's now $141 (no dividend but who cares). There is no reason why T cannot grow to those numbers if everything falls into place."
so whats their total DEBT now??? 1 billion???
"Not a phone company anymore, just a failing media mess."
"If i have 1717 shares of T,how many shares of spin off will I get."
"Watching the rotation out of crashing cryptos and bubble tech into ""safe"" havens such as low p/e stocks and the miners. Anyone else seeing this?"
"Depending on what T's price is, but right now one more dividend and I should finally break even."
"The problem the DEM wits have created already for the markets . Is it will not matter now what the final plan is whether to tax gains as income or tax the gains before you have sold . there is now no reason to buy and hold any stock if the gains are going to be taxed as income rates . It will now change how people will invest starting on Monday and you will need to sell before all the rich people do. So Monday I will be changing the way I invest. FACT is the DEM wits have cost more money than you know and it won't happen this time . I will be a flipper like they want and have incented to be , watch the selling begin next week"
The CNN ratings crash of 55% doesn't help
BREAKING NEWS !AT&T Raised to Buy From Neutral by New Street Research !BOO YA !
"Depending on ratio, they expect share worth after the merger to equal between 30.37 at low valuations to $41 at high. So middle ground would be $35~. That is analysts predictions. At some point we will see a recovery then is my guess."
It's time to go to cash
s this stock a good one to buy for safety and the dividend? Thanks.
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/larry-hogan-gop-turning-circular-firing-squad-over-trump-loyalty-n1266777
looks like you Monday posters hoping to pick up T at 18-22 will have to wait LMAO
Pretty constant accumulation going on here.My shares are for sale at $100.
"Whatever happened to Inflation that was so rampant yesterday. LOL. CNBC pull the wool over the public's eyes again, by linking the stock market with the economy."
"Wow, don’t know what else to say"
Sold Out Completely of $T made 0.44% profit + divs
2 bucks away from the last 52 week high.
Call it a win if it stays above $31.
"I estimate each share of AT&T will get a dividend worth $7 or $8 when the final numbers are finalized. Just hold your shares, collect your 6.6% divy for the next year, and then collect your stock combination dividend."
"HBO MAX also seems to cut off in the middle of movies enough to notice. It was worse when Wonder Woman came out, and it's definitely improved, but server stability is needed. I get that it's hard to keep up with millions of new subscribers, but this server capacity is needed for the likely boom in new subscribers."
Just enough to force those $30 calls :)
less debt less income from Warner and direct TV. more focus on telecom. focus on 5g. more potential profit. don't worry about dividends cuts. difference will be paid from discovery. 35 end of week.
AT&T to take off. Only problem is 2 of the 3 engine's is laying on the ground.
Anybody claiming AT&T retains any ownership of the TW media assets is wrong or lying.
Cramer wrote yesterday that the deal will cut the dividend by 50% since the company statement suggests that it will cut the payout ratio significantly in order to reduce debt. Is he reading that correctly?
"This company is starting to remind me of GE, look what happened to them, they bought everything in sight then had to spin most all of it off as the stock tanked to a 30 year low but the big shots still got rich."
Godzilla and Tom and Jerry!!!!
"check out $SHIP that has the potential to soar x2 the current price, dont miss out the discounted pick."
Already down 1 year of the old dividend...2 years of the new dividend. Ouch.
if you did deals like that in your home you would be in a box.
Breaking News: ATT rally falters again. Investors wonder when a rally will really stick.
This thing is going to the moon!!!
Target Price raised to $44 pps...Way to go AT&T!
T time!
"""Under the terms, AT&T would receive $43 billion in a combination of cash, debt securities, and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. AT&T's shareholders would receive stock representing 71% of the new company, while Discovery shareholders would own 29% of the new company..."""
"Anybody wonder if there is some details here we might be missing. Find it hard to believe T gives away the entire revenue stream. Will they retain some movie rights, part ownership of the catalog or receive a discount for their consumers ? Find it hard to believe they let it all go and yet get board seats of new co."
What is the value of Time Warner at T books. There will come a large write down in connection with the spin off.
If this scam virus was created in a lab as a weapon as some think. Don't you think that many more would have died by now? Millions die every year around the world from virus complications every year. The information is there for everyone to look up.
"We need more of this Stock Holder rebellion of excessive pay for top executives. No one is worth this much money to a company. Totally crazy and stupid, especially for Randall Stephens, after all the bad moves and decisions. We need 'Disruption' of this condition in America!!!""AT&T ( T ) doled out large compensation packages to several leaders in 2020. Chief Executive John Stankey and WarnerMedia division chief Jason Kilar collected compensation valued at $21 million and $52.2 million, respectively, during their first year on the job. Randall Stephenson, who served as chief executive until Mr. Stankey took over in June and was replaced as chairman this past January, had compensation valued at $29.2 million."""
"Moving day, moving out in droves. Surprised it didn't go lower."
I am trying to understand this. So the new media company is in a sense buying Warner for $43 billion and stock? They give the AT&T shareholders .71 shares for each AT&T share? Essentially I read this puts the value of Warner at 90 billion even though AT&T paid $110 billion. Stephenson will probably go down as one of the worst CEO dealmakers ever. Bought Direct TV for $48 billion and is sold for $15 billion. Bought Warner for $110 billion and sells for $90 billion. Tried to buy T-Mobile and had to pay a $4 billion in a failed buyout clause. Stephenson cost AT&T and his shareholders $57 billion and yet he was paid millions. Lets start a petition to reduce his pension buy the percent of the losses.
"it is funny how people are speculating on stock price would effect. while people are panicking, more hedge funds bought this"
Shorts splurged too many shares.The WS big boyz are not going to pass this opportunity. They will ensure shorts pay a huge price!Gl!
You got to love T. Nice to see the gains but love to see my dividends more.
"On the negative side: Why would anyone trust T management to reward shareholders in any way. While the Dow rose 37% in two years, T dropped 10%. While the Dow rose 81% in five years, T dropped 33%. For G's sake."
"The deal probably makes sense, but, man, those guys are all horrible at PR."
Semms that the price is yoyoing today my guess is on profit takers and day traders! T is a hold and only ging to continue to go up with TW and HBOMAX.
Why is DISCA up 12% and T only 3% on the merger news?
Well I'll be. All this just to continue raising their dividend and keep their status as a dividend aristocrat. T IS shareholder friendly.
"Who cares what Cramer says. Buy or hold AT&T as a long term play. It's been with me and my family for many decades (up/downs but like gold, never sold any of it), and it's going to stay that way until if and whenever they decide to reduce the dividend. Hopefully, never!"
Holy Batcave....I smell a dividend slashing later this summer. I always told you Vagibagholders No dividend is safe. With a debt load this size.....
Buy Time Warner for 85 billions sell it for 42 billion and than slash dividends 50%
"As a novice trader I'm with all the frenzy about a dividend cut that will not take place in about a year , if then."
"I get how crushing the dividend cut is going to be. I certainly think Management has done an awful job. With that said though, I actually think this gives the stock somewhere to go long term if you consider the new company may get a higher valuation on those particular assets then they are right now under the AT&T Umbrella. I personally think we have seen the worst of the panic selling. At least I hope. I don't think we will see 27. I think we have a fair shot to end the week right around $30. Will it be a dead cat bounce leading to more losses? Perhaps, but People are slowly digesting the deal, and quite frankly the sell off while painful has not been as dramatic as it could have been. I certainly cant imagine selling right now into this weakness. I think these comments saying it will go under 25 or worse are quite full of unnecessary drama. Now let me rip on the management and CEO again. I am baffled how bad the company has done on this roll out. What bad PR. So you come out, announce a deal in a unclear manner, the market quickly rejects to it, and the company goes silent instead of getting out there to explain why it could be good! Horrible management, horrible public relations. It seems they have no interest in getting out there and saying why this is a good move. They need to be selling the future of the new company thats where alot of growth could be hiding. To me it may be a good mix, you get the stable 5G telecom play and we get a second stock that could have some growth and a higher valuation in the streaming category."
Todays merger and divi cut is a major punch to the gut of T stock. This very well may be the end of this stock as the final catalyst to send it in a downward spiral forever with no sign of recovery... i bet discovery is happy though take all the money and cut the dividend and screw T shareholders over
"Been telling you guys this is a $60+ stock all day. Now that Cramer is behind it you guys agree lol. Either way, load up before the level up bc these days of $30 are going to be behind us real fast"
Perfect example of why you buy a dividend stock and hold it until you wear diapers again.
Mortal Kombat appears to be another hit for Warner Bros. Go T!
AT&T shareholders own 71% of the new company.
As a long time holder of T I can holdout for the shares of the new company which should more than make up for the panic selling at the present time. Long term shares of T will increase along with the shares of the new company. The reduction of the dividend can be made up by the increased values of both companies. I believe we are seeing panic in the selling by those who can't see the forest through the trees!
Cramer at it again....
"I was at an AT&T shareholders meeting about thirty years ago. The room was full with disgruntled investors. One person was recognized to ask a question and he said, ""Do you know the best way to accumulate one million dollars of AT&T stock? Start with two million dollars of AT&T stock."" The more things change, the more they stay the same. It was true then, and it is true now. Good luck to all."
I’m thinking of investing in Bell Atlantic or MCI Anyone got a problem with that !
"John math does not make any sense. T paid $110 billions for TW including debt, plus invested billions in TW content during the last three years, plus paid billions in interest on the debt incurred to finance the transaction, plus incurred billions in the purchase of a company to launch targeted advertising with TW assets did nothing and simply scrapped Xandar some months ago and recognizing the mistake had no option to spin off these assets to be able to repay the debt load that left T without required financial flexibility to compete effectively. In Network 101 you learn that spectrum is a limited resource so you need financial flexibility to participate in these spectrum auctions. They simply missed they will need cash to fund these recurring spectrum purchases. So they were forced for this spin off to pay down debt and not only that but also cut the dividend in half. John fingerprint is in all these major failed acquisitions including TW costing T $billions. John should resign as CEO immediately so that credibility and trust on T can be restored. Less than a month ago he was saying that the dividends were secured at current levels and that the high dividend yield issue would be solved by increasing the stock price. A new CEO is needed to restore investors confidence."
If the stockprice keeps falling we'll be back at a 6% dividend in no time.
"Was just looking at the responses to my post yest re how hbomax announcing the friends reunion release date could really help w/ sub growth. I got 16 thumbs down and only 8 up. I don't get it. In 2018, nflx non-originals accounted for 70+% of their viewing. And you know what show was #2? Friends! It has a HUGE following. Why does it not make sense that the reunion special could be a nice catalyst for sub growth? It's just math."
Stop saying this is a good thing. My account shows otherwise. By tomorrow I will have shown a spread of 20% from todays high and tomorrows low. I hope it is only 20% and that T doesn't drop below 28 or 27. Though 28 is looking to be taken out in the morning.
"If spun off with the debt, expect some nice dividend increases to follow for years to come."
it's being said the $20b free cash flow is too high so expect an even lower dividend. under $1?
U share holder's had it comming. AT&T management is as trustworthy as CNN. 2 funny.
This would be a once in a lifetime buy and hold at 25.
"The deal would provide $43 billion to AT&T, and would leave AT&T shareholders holding 71% of the new company."
"The new name for the CEO is Spankey based on the shareholder responses to the deal. AT&T reducing the dividend sounds like Jeff Bezos coming out and saying Amazon is going to cut back on home delivery. It is what they are known for. The message is basically ""we don't know how to manage these assets we bet your stock on so we are going to make a deal with someone we think can. Oh, and that dividend might need to be a lot lower. Thanks for being a good shareholder but we decided based on the nifty way we are structuring the deal you don't have any say."""
Keep buying it
At this point if you haven’t sold your shares it’s best bet is to hold and wait to receive the shares in the Newly formed CO. Value has been erased from this sell of and the subsequent spinof value is not adequately reflected in T shares price ATM. Just my 2 cents bought another 30 shares today at 29.14
Hope you sold at the open!
Feel sorry for everyone who listened to Nelson Capital and sold their shares. What a mistake this stock will continue to go UP every day until $49
"Wonder if Cramer had some inside news on Bitcoin, to pay off his mortgage before the ball drop and smashed bitcoin this weekend"
I really wish they would buyback shares... it would make the dividend more sustainable going forward (of course also increase share price etc)
T is doing it again. Merging to gain cash flow to service the debt and massive dividend. They have mastered the art of kicking the can down the road.
THIS STOCK WILL CLOSE RED TODAY!!
it will be bigger than Netflix from a revenue projection...
ATT has new leadership and things are looking pretty good. Not knowing where Sloppy Joe & his masters will take the country or the market........I feel good getting my 7% dividend.
"So T divvy will be 3% is less than VZ, sustainable, PE should be 13... so upside still 30% for now..Once we got separate stock, that is just gravy."
"Finally. Absolutely ridiculous that this company is being treated like a doormat for the past several years. Any reasonable valuation in today's market is $40+. Long way to go still. Its a leader in 5G, streaming top content, etc. & a cash machine. People need to wake up!"
"More then 25 years AT&T had good dividend, until now""Good Job!"""
"Up 21.5% in the last 6 months including dividend disbursement. This surge reminds me of the good 'ol days of Pac Bell/AT&T, now it's simply icing on the cake. Old guy, been long since 1981 W/dividend reinvestment, slow and steady, didn't get wealthy overnight but grateful and blessed for how well it turned out for my wife and I to enjoy the retirement phase of our life."
"T will sit at $30 for 6 months because $30 - $7.5 in a special stock dividend is equal to a $22.50 post merger T stock price and a 5% dividend. I own a lot of T and I will be happy to get my current 7% dividend and then get my NewCo shares next June. The division will be 1:4 per share and the big players already know this and that is why T is sitting at $30. Since DISC stock is at $30 and has limited upside as well for awhile, you can play the NewCo anyway you like and you have time. But it will be interesting to see what kind of premium both stocks get as the merger date draws nigh. This is like an IPO of a very hot company, so a premium might be had. If you wait for day#1 and try to buy in the morning, you may pay a big premium if the interest is strong enough. That is why I will wait in my T stock for the spin off. But until then, I'm off to the Viacom board. There is real action in the Viacom pits. (I'm not selling either, but I think it's stable until next Jan)"
Stanky is on CNBC at 8 AM this morning we will learn more how much debt was retired what does the outlook look for the dividend projections for the year let’s hope he’s not too conservative still looks like a good day either way Long time overdue for good news￼
33+ next week
The scary part many investors bought in the $39 range been waiting and waiting now the horror story comes not knowing if we ever get back to $39. All this so T management could control the attack on the best president USA ever had. Now these executives dump it on investors
Glad I got in at 26s...and held...when many such as Cramer and Motly Fool warned to sell. Now they are all for T.
This is a great buying opportunity under $30
Mr. Market exposed. He must make as much hay now before the tunami......of buying and covering
"Bloomberg: ""The transaction values the combined entity at about US$130 billion including debt, based on WarnerMedia’s estimated enterprise value of more than US$90 billion.""T paid 85B. Now 90B, that's +5B punters. Cramer hit the machine gun button for ya'll...T shrhldrs get 79% of new co. plus div of still 4% post any cut.Ya'll sell LMAO"
"Lilly to VZ: Can we talk, I have an attractive resumes..."
"My projection is that one year after separation, you got one AT&T stock traded at 33 and another stock traded at 150B..."
"This news should have raised the share price by 3 or 4 dollars a share- remember, we look FWD! As a result I am selling this issue as it only went up 33 pennies. Good luck to those that remain..."
Dividend is still good for a year. Why are people freaking out ? LoL
NOW everyone is hating on T??This is finally the time to buy IMO. Will be focusing on core areas of expertise while getting rid of commie news net. And yield will be around 5 percent. Folks waiting for $25 or some other target may of course be right. But they are weak humans and weaker investors who will never buy at any price.
DIVIDEND IS TOAST!! This is not good !
29.59. Speaks for itself.
will the share price of T be reflected by the success/failure of the new spinoff company?
"There’s no guarantee that you’ll get .71 shares of the spin-off for every share of T. Depending on the shares issued, you could only get .21 or whatever number. Total disgrace for Stankey to leave so many long term holders hanging, wondering."
Sit back collect 7% the rest of the year and then rewarded in mid 2022 with .71 shares of Discovery. Seems like a win win to me....
"When the dividend is actually announced by T, the stock price will drop another 15%. What a blood bath."
Hey if this deal happens to fall through are we back to our regularly scheduled program?? Is now as opportunity to pick up shares buying into the dip? These are questions I keep asking myself because I know to be cynical of anything they actually show us whether it's the news or its the annual report. I own about 150 shares so of course I'm bullish long term... but I'm just curious what the plan is if their plan to cut the dividend falls through because this deal falls through.
"...cutting the dividend...? Then, I probably won't want to own it in the future..."
Well people haven't stopped using cellphones so I guess the subscribers went to T or T-Mobile. Could be a fun day tomorrow for the longs.
This is the definition of a stock for non risk takers. This is sometimes what happens. You get lulled to sleep thinking 31-33 w a steady divvy is guaranteed. This will be a decent buy for income when this settled in 25/26 range.
Did you guys know when Bell Atlantic went searching for the name Verizon it came up in an Elevator meeting in New York. They spent $1M dollars making absolutely sure no one else was copyrighted on the name. How do I know? b/c people told me. ha. looooooool.
Stanky lives up to his name!
I thought the sky was falling?
"Let's take a poll. Will T close Green or Red today? Thumbs UP for Green, Thumbs DOWN for Red."
"Dragons are coming, 2022!"
"CEO should have said they were going to accept doge coin as part of the transaction,that would have been icing on the cake"
Price probably drops back to $26 base. Worst case. Holding and adding under $30.
Shareholders don't get to vote on this deal. The only way to vote 'no' is to sell.
good time to buy at current market price.
what will be the percentage of dividend on ATT guys???? if they lower the dividend rate?????????if that is the case ATT will go down to 20 dollar for me to get in again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"""Hey Mikey. He Likes it."""
I misquoted - it is a great deal for AT & T holders. Google AT&T is cutting its dividend. Read the Barron’s article.It says AT & T’s shareholders 71 % stake is worth 110.8 bln $ or about $15.40 per current AT & T share.Total value for AT&T is 25.88 + 15.40 = $41.28Just read the analysis.Shorts are creating a havoc here I guess.
Randall Stephenson should be in jail and have his pension cancelled.
HBO Max now added 67 Million Subs in 1 year. In 2021 it will launch in 60 other nations. Show me 1 streaming service with this growth and this growth potential.
It is actually sort of amazing that over the past 5 years T is down 5% INCLUDING the dividend and the S&P has doubled. That is all you need to know.
"WOW CRAMMER WRONG AGAIN JUST THIS WEEK HE SAID SELL,SELL,SELL WRONG"
"Bought some Calls in the low 29s this morning. Spinoffs are almost always a good deal. Way over-reaction - people selling because the ""herd"" is. Easy money. For those complaining about dividend cut, just sell your ""free"" shares of the spinoff & that will more than make up for the 40% dividend cut. Think of it as a ""special"" dividend."
"one of the cnbc Halftime traders had a great take on the T/Disca deal. She saw it as a total game changer if they stream live tv, ala Hulu. It would make their product far diff than nflx and far bigger than hulu and far bigger and diff from dis (dis only has espn). So I guess the div lovers are still vomiting but maybe it will get understood a little better and some will buy it for the newco piece.....remember, if you buy the stock at any point before close of the deal, you get both."
Could get ugly today . Inflation I think is even worse than being reported
DirecTV was a disaster. Paid 180 billion and will get only 80 billion for it. Who in their right mind would trust that ATT mgmt is doing the right thing by purchasing Discovery Channel?
$31 open tomo
T behaving just the way I wanted during a tech pull back. All while enjoying these massive dividend checks hitting the bank every quarter.
"At the request of many many AT&T bears, such as JimCramer and all that, we do exactly what you wanted.."
CNN slanders AT&T shareholders..
"Here's some perspective: 11/11/2019 shares traded at $39.50. That's a mere 18 months ago. If things go well ( a big IF) we could be at that level 18 months from now plus $3/share dividends. Hang on and hang in, fellow investors, there is some nice money to be made if only Washington DC doesn't screw it up too much ( and I am talking both sides of the aisle)."
"I am a relative new investor to T....appears to me that despite the numerous past missteps that T remains a big money printer carrying all that debt and still has tremendous cashflows...now existing T holders will get a pure-stream that rivals Disney and Netflix plus hold on to T wireless and hardline biz, a decision that even though took several iterations is finally here....I am going long T shares with some T long duration Calls and under-hedged with some short term PUTS on Discovery shares....BUT T and its CALLS"
Stilling getting paid almost 6% while waiting to get two stocks... not bad.
they always find a way to mess up a good thing. stock on a breakout? lets announce a deal and cut the dividend!
"What would happen to SP if we hit 200,000,000 million HBO MAX subs?"
once again opex Friday and the mm's are hard at work!!
"Didn't catch all the details but apparently viac, via its pluto tv ad-supported, free model did exceedingly well. Also, they plan to launch an ad-supported paramount tv product as well. Point is, ad-supported is evidently a product that's well received by the public. Isn't another big streaming product, starts w/ an H i think....isn't that one producing an ad-supported model to compliment its pay model?? That sounds like a great move to me."
try getting a 4 percent rate in your bank! it's a keeper look out netflex!
. The market isn't buying the deal folks. Sorry.
Sounds now like a “win-win” for T shareholders....as long as they hold and don’t let panic set in.... hold on and there is a “pot of gold” there waiting with this new merger.... but again gang don’t panic! and hang in there....2 companies now for the price of one with MUCHO $$$$$$ potential!!!!!
"To all share holders of AT&T, we all make mistakes. Some my mistakes includes Obama motors, Lucent technology, Kmart, ensco plc, and it hurt."
$31 tomorrow!!
Why not wait until below 25? You get more shares for less. Don’t be quick to catch a falling knife
Long time AT&T shareholder here. Management has been an unmitigated disaster. Only attraction was the dividend. What great deal has AT&T done? AOL/Time Warner? Nope. DirecTV? Nope. Discovery Merger? Nope. I sold half my shares yesterday and will see about the remaining but I’m not inclined to hold LT because this is a Minimal Growth story IMO. This Discovery merger is going to take a Long Time.
Is there a chance the deal doesn’t go through?
"Just read a article on Mkt. watch, ATT made a profit of 30 Bil. for the Yr. and sold for 48 Bil. this just dont make sense to throw away a 30 Bil. a yr. Warner Media. Would some one explain to me why ATT. would do this ?"
They picked up 4 million shares for cheap money in the first 30 minutes
yay T! I'm going to buy more soon.
"Hopefully, the selling pressure eased. It's now the time to load up on this undervalued asset."
This is some stock right here lol.
"PBA, 0.17 a share a month, in a Div. If You have some cash and looking for a Div. Or, O, 0.23 a month in Div. Bought back some T today, and Bought some PBA, Need a Div. in my portfolio."
Cheetah - should I sell Calls here? What's the right play?
"Well you all got your wish, T is dumping CNN. LOL. Happy now. Maybe you'll go to the DISCA board and start your blithcing about CNN there."
"Loss of the dividend is not good for shareholders. While stockholders will gain ownership in Discovery that new media company will have huge problems in meeting the level of competition. They are dwarfed by Netflix, Amazon and Disney and are not likely to be able to succeed. Bad deal all around."
If Jake and CNN continue on their present path most senior management and the BOD will be held accountable for every word they utter. Get rid of the Lemon Queen and Sister Trapper before its too late.
"I'd get back in and ride this horse if it broke under 30, lol."
Bitcoin getting crushed tonight. Money flowing out of the Bitcoin bubble will flow into value like T.
"No profit, no taxes . AT&T wins?"
Ive been showing my 14 year old how to invest. It’s fun way to spend time with him and to teach him how to put his money to work. He asked me last week to put into T for him. I asked why? He said HBO Max is better than Netflix and he thought people would buy new phones with the stimulus check. Looks like he nailed it.
"Once the share price drops significantly more, the dividend will be back at 7%. Lol."
"If John Stankey, John Legere and Mike Sievert were in a room together, who would be told to leave?"
what you guys think is a good entry buy point by today's date.....
Back to 25
"So, T has traded 10,000,000 shares in the pre-market, down 5.7%. Looks like T management made yet another mistake?"
"After the news fully disseminates overnight, it will be almost impossible to place a sell order tomorrow..."
T needs to keep its political mouth shut. Political talk does not make money.
"$27's is up coming ........... unfortunately. Everyone's dumping, and in my opinion, rightfully so!"
Don't be a day trader in this stock. Institutions are buying this up like crazy on the dip. Hold your shares.
This is some stock...lol
T to raise their dividend? Risk losing a 23 year streak if they don't
"It always amazes me how T and VZ are valued so low. Yet, imagine if tomorrow T and VZ Shut down. All business would stop, people would scramble to the internet to connect, and it would overload and then oh, T and VZ internet would be gone."
HBO Max is the new Netflix
"Dividend cut ,sold it at 33.75.I will buy again at 31.good luck everyone"
"Finally, $T is up on more than 2.5x avg volume. This might be the start of climbing back up to $40 again."
"Since Stanky Stankster came to AT&T with the Time Warner merger, I think his days as CEO of AT&T are probably numbered."
"T is doing good.I guess Starship Coyote can't read. I said I was playing golf tomorrow and Thursday, I didn't say today. And by the way, I DID warn you about this company. T DOES NOT have a good management team and until it gets one, it isn't going anywhere. You can't shift debt and move a few assets around and expect to unlock some hidden value. A company is worth it's salt or it isn't and with this management team, T isn't cutting it."
 looks like grandpas just waking up to the news. T divy will be cut. Big time!!
"I think the dividend will remain at $.52 till the deal closes. T cannot from a legal and moral point of view, cut the dividend and cash the proceeds into its coffers and spend the money on 5G, or whatever. That extra money, from a cut, would be like stealing the furniture in WarnerMedia offices and moving to T offices. With > 7 billion shares outstanding, cutting dividend to .3 will net T > $2 Billion a quarter, thus changing the premise on which the deal was made."
BOTH SEEING GREEN Early Monday...AT& T Up 2 %.... and AABB Gold-backed Crypto...Stock UP 8% to 16%.
"Compelling conversation today about buying T-Mobile, they are leading the way in 5G more so then T and VZ and picking up there churn in big numbers. However my gut tells me it’s a very expensive stock and plenty of money to be made elsewhere"
So dividend will be 43% of 20+billion in free cash flow. with 7.14 billion shares outstanding that sounds like the Dividend will be cut from $2.08 to $1.20. Anyone read this differently?
"My thoughts. This is the slow capitulation march down to a much lower level. People will scream about the dividend for the next year and the value of the stock from the new entity, blah, blah, blah. Obvious now the dividend is not guaranteed and who knows what the new Discovery run entity will achieve for success. This is as much about psychology as finance. People with investing discipline have already bailed. That is why they use stop loss limits or other methods to limit their losses. Based on where the price goes they will reassess. Others are still holding thinking this has to bounce back because a week ago everything looked great. As it goes slowly down it will have some up days but the trend will be decline. Contributing to that will be the next wave of hangers on who finally realize they cannot afford to lose any more. I speak from experience because I have watched a few of my holdings drop and then drive 30-50% lower. On the way down traders play with the price to give some sparks that look like a rally is starting. Then they trade out and drive it down more as unsophisticated investors buy more shares to ""average down"".Not an outlook I like but I think it is real."
"T is projected to earn about $3.14 this year and $3.18 next year. When they can show some growth in earnings and sales and get 2022 eps projections moving higher, the price will break out of its current range bound channel but not before. I believe that people will go back to seeing movies and Covid fears will diminish in a few months. I also believe that HBO Max will be sold in Europe and South America which will help growth but these things take time"
"Heading towards a new 52 week high above $33. Holding 10K shares to give as a gift to my daughter when she turns 18. She is only 10 now.God willing I shall Live and be in Health and enjoy watching the slow and steady up and down, gap open gap closed, climb of T not only towards a new 52 week high, but a new 5 year high, for I believe that the next 8 years are going to be the best years fot T, breakout years, while we get paid.Blessings"
"I think there will be more to come. e.g., if this isn;' the best offer to TW assets, other offers will come in and have to be presented to the Board, and eventually the best deal voted on by shareholders"
Too many retired folks holding this for its dividend and they will be reallocating some place else for some time to come. Expect selling pressure for a long while. What a blind side
"178,000 border jumpers in April and that's only the ones they caught. (And then released into the country). Any one of them could be a terrorist. This President hasn't completely forgotten about 9/11."
Average volume 42 millionYesterday’s volume 164 millionWhat will it be today?
Should open over $31
Does anyone have an idea what debt T will be left with when the deal is done?
Mergers and Acquisitions are basically to shore up the financials and for that the Investment banks get a huge fee. Nothing really changes.
"this is a scam, vote no to the merger!"
"Folks, they are not CUTTING the dividend, they are “RESIZING” it. Stinkey said so."
"Selling a bit overdone on T in my opinion. Dividend was raised not too long ago and doubt it will be cut. Dividend cutting occurs only as a last resort. Perhaps some jumped as they had short term capital gains after being in T when it fell last year and now are worried over uncertainty. Personally, I think their 5 G buildout and restructuring here is a good move, but many times shareholders hate undertainty."
"Don't feel bad T'rs, T is due for a green day. Probably tomorrow."
Becareful..these buys are in and out. Watch Yahoo video this morning on it.
So John’s finically strategy is to buy high and sell low?
slow and steady wins the race!!
I cant afford to pay the bills & feed the kids now because of this dividend cut. Not sure what to do now....
"AndyI own T but I try to make money with options or by trading the common stock regardless of the direction of the price This morning, I sold $30 strike calls, betting that the closing price would be <$30I felt that was a smart moveYou may disagree which is your right I plan on keeping T but will look for opportunities to make money by hedging Good luck"
Just like I said in an earlier post this is AT&T's modus operandi. Goes up a couple bucks into the dividend or after a good earnings report and runs right back where it started.
"Stankey on CNBC tomorrow morning. T should be trading $33+ after earnings after beating the numbers, including taking subs from VZ."
"A breath of fresh air?Discovery CEO David Zazlav on Monday committed to the future of CNN once his company completes a merger with AT&T’s WarnerMedia.“Not only are we going to keep it,” Zaslav said in a Monday press conference with AT&T CEO John Stankey, but the new company will “lean into news.” He noted that his company already has a substantial news presence in Europe, which will be combined with CNN to create “a world leader in news.”Earlier in the call, CNN’s chief media correspondent Brian Stelter asked about the fate of his employer, too, and was told by Zaslav — who will helm the new operation once the merger is completed in mid-2022 — that CNN’s independence will be honored and the brand will be given “the greatest editorial integrity.”When can only hope!"
So CNN and The Bushwhackers are going to overtake Disney and Netflix. Funny.
"On the way to a negative close. That tells you everything you need to know about what shareholders think of this horrendous management. The Board is asleep at the wheel or worse, complacent. Either way, until every single board member and the entire C-suite is replaced this is a dying company. Let's hope somebody is willing to buy it when it drops in the teens."
"If mgmt can promise to make NO DEALS for the next 10 years, perhaps that will put the floor under the stock."
"I guess Elliott miscalculated too. T has done everything they wanted. A couple yrs ago, they said stock could be $65 in five yrs.....so about 3 yrs from now. Something like that. Well, Stankey followed their recommendations. Not only has it not worked, the market has flat out rejected it."
"Oh my. Sgt. Slaughter got giddy. I’m retired, six figure dividend, no debt and a 7 figure paid off house. I traded T for MO in February and he says I “know nothing”. Who’s your daddy, son?"
Please stay up here until 8am. Never get this lucky in any stock. Have a lot of shares. Just want $33.
TStankey had the backbone yet to talk directly to the loyal shareholders about their dividend? I didn't think so.
"All telecom companies including T, VZ, NFLX and CMCSA are taking a hit again today. This is troubling."
"Class Action Lawsuit. Similar to some of the Toyota class action law suits, Investors successfully sued TM if the inevestors lost money by buying stock while the company knowingly hid safety data. When the investors sold the stock at a loss they got compensated. I think a similar thing is going to happen with ATT. They advertised maintaining the dividend. Investors bought the stock, now the stock has dropped due to this business decision, and the dividend seems likely to NOT be maintained."
KISS THAT BIG DIVIDEND GOODBYE IMO FOREVER!!
A 5% dividend rate per Stankey implies the stub T will be worth $24. The question now is what will the partial share of DISCA spun to T holders gonna be worth.
"I understand that the divy cut is tough to stomach. For me as well. But are they going to cut part of T’s divy and not pay one in new company? Or are they? Also, if the spinoff is a growth company, that should bring in just as many investors as T will lose because of divy cut, right?"
I think this is Jason Kilar's idea to merge. lol
"By the time this deal closes, those media ""assets"" would be worth 50% less..."
"so, all ppl selling because of the div cut...where are you putting that money instead?"
I'm adding to my position. AT&T has a great Dividend and undervalued. Warren Buffet said it's a great place park your money and reccomended.
Cramer is bashing his parent company's competition. He's influential because people choose to not to look at his obvious conflicts.
Come on At&t you worth it... in this overvalued market it's your time to shine!!!
IMO: T > NFLX long term.
If I have 2000 T shares how many shares new co will I receive? Thanks
"I am retired and have both IBM and T stocks to generate some income. Today, T did very well. All my stocks in various accounts are all down except T. So glad that I added more T last July."
pay attention folks T just lost its dividend aristocrat status. how many companies are still around 10 years after losing it? 0 thats right 0 companies in history writing is on the wall. dont let your money go in the coffin.
"Remember, these CEOs did this to make themselves even richer. They will accrue millions of stock options at depressed prices over the next few years. Then they will sell them for hundreds of millions when the options are vested. They didn't want to get shares issued to them at high prices."
"If a stock like T is primarily purchased for its dividend and the dividend is cut by 50%, does the stock then go down 50% to bring the dividend back in line with the stock price? If so, T has a long road down. I for one will not be sticking around to find out. Call me a seller!"
Congratulations to all the faithful AT&T shareholders! I am so glad AT&T proved Jim Cramer wrong on his sell recommendation!
"You have until earnings to get into T. So you can buy before the ex dividend on April 8 and lock in the dividend to get paid on May 3 or you can wait and buy on April 8 and up until earnings for the pop higher that is coming from T taking away customers from both VZ and T mobile with T's monster new unlimited cell plans with free HBO Max. All up to you what you want to do , but for sure you will want to sell out of VZ before earnings show how bad VZ is now losing customer. Get some T why you still can"
T the new GE.
Do you guys think it’s to early to buy. I am very heavy into to T would like to add a few hundred shares?
Double volume in the first 3 1/2 hours and most of the gains have vanished.Does anyone else see the writing on the wall here. We should be holding gains not losing them.They should not have announced this deal with out releasing all the facts
"A well deserved beating today and I predict more to come tomorrow. What is unclear is if current T shareholders recieve shares of the newco and how many. Still, 2 loser companies joining forces does not make an instant winner. Time will tell I guess. In the mean time..trade on."
"WOW, I am so impressed with the many who stated they have dividend income of 10s of thousands off T stock! I guess I am just a small fry."
TStankey just did what BvB at Shell did - he told income investors that were fat and happy to find a new gig and he slashed the dividend and ushered in a new era of shareholders. It's over if you are in it for the income. No reason to fight it.
"I must of hurt someone's feelings. If u hold a socialists company's stock, u have a responsibility for what company does and the consequences."
"WHEN T cuts its divvy is a significant consideration for me. If it waits until the spinoff, great. If it’s soon, I’ll be forced to re-evaluate."
"So T is no longer a divvy stock. so are TMUS, CMCSA, NFLX...let us see what will happen."
"T setting itself up to get bought out. This is wild. Once they bought Bellsouth, now they are way behind in the 5g game and need a lifeline. Empire-builder Randall Stephenson ran this into a muddy ditch."
"WarnerMedia is an entertainment company, and should be managed by an entertainment management team - not a telecommunications management team. This deal will bring a successful future for both WarnerMedia and AT&T."
WOW !T May NEVER Again Reach The Pre Market Price OfEARLIER TODAY !
But will the new media company achieve scale to compete with nflx and dis?
T is doing good.Good morning T'rs. Going golfing today. Amazing how fast things can change in the market huh? LOL
Biggest value shredding machine ever seen on Wall St.
Over $200 BILLION in DEBT. What happened to Ma Bell ?!
"Homegamers !My 28,600 Share Buy @ 28.72 Is StillLOOKING GOOD ! 7.25% Dividend For The Next YEAR !What's In YOUR WALLET !@"
LOL Yep 30.99The NEW and IMPROVED 29.99
"The dividend cut is 50%. To around $1 from $2.08 today. Simple math. Read the 8-K, future dividends up to 43% from T’s expected future cash flow of $20 billions after transaction closes. That is not the worse part, forget about all the dreams they keep selling us today, the same way they have done in the past with no execution and failure on their part. The worst part is that the same executive, John Stankey, that was at the center of all these failed transactions (the failed merger with T-Mo and billions $ and spectrum lost, the overpaid purchase of DTV and the recently admitted terrible mistake purchase of TW) as chief strategist officer and COO is still around. The only reason Elliot Management decided not to push him out of T, was due to the pandemic since as they said, “it would had been too complex to bring someone new in during those difficult times.” Well, the pandemic is almost over and I think it is time to take him out of the Company if T wants to restore some credibility on their C suite. There has been no execution from this executive team for years. I wish the Chairman would come out and say, “the future of John Stankey in the Company is to be determined”...the exact same comment John made on an excellent executive from TW when he announced this spin off transaction."
It would be kinda creepy to close at $ 31.99.
Dividend Cut of 60%Why is this not surprise? Wasn’t the reason the baggies hold this for the dividend?
"The more people learned about the consequences of the deal, the less they wanted to own T. I think the reduction of the dividend is driving many to sell. T hasn't been a growth stock for years, and certainly not a value stock. I bought it for the income, holding at a small gain, will probably sell and look at it again after things settle down. Don't expect the spinoff to pay a dividend, competitors in that sector pay little or none. I don't hold anything that pays less than a 2.5% yield. Been doing it this way for 60 years, happy with my results."
"I don't expect AT&T (T) to grow very fast in the short time, BUT, if it's a great dividend stock with almost 7 % return per year. It's also a stable stock so if stock market goes down, T will probably stay more or less the same. Next dividen date is this Friday (April 9, 2021) i.e. this is the date one has to registered as owner of T shares to participate. Actual payment is a little later."
Open at $29 tomorrow with no bottom in sight. This is brutal!
"comcast is providing all server( Cable, Universal Studio, phone, Internet). They are managing all but AT&T can't. Management should be laid off. AT&T laid off their employee who make peanuts. C suite make millions and they kept them."
"I just looked at the chart on Yahoo. On March 1 T was 28.09. This looks more like there is some large buyers coming in, not like a x dividend rally. T has been undervalued for to long. Go T!!!"
T has been FLAT for last 10 years...I sold mine at $38 about two years ago NOV of 2019 before the crash.
Great business plan AT&T has. Spend billions on things that don't work and then sell/ spin it off for millions less than what you paid for it.
"Added a couple hundred shares today.,"
Short sellers are really out in force trying to get you to sell your shares. ￼
yeah idk about this merge. if dividend is getting cut. i'm out
"Never buy a stock for its yield. If you bought this stock yesterday, your yield for the entire year has been wiped out."
Nice Job T
If you're looking for dividends with large payouts consider REIT's like NLY they pay a 9% yield since 1996. The stock is 9.30 with a PE of 2.0
"This is beginning of the end for one-trick pony Netflix. Very soon, the T approach - superior content that can be delivered on any device & bundled with audio/video thru 1 service - is the right approach. Disney cant do that. Netflix cant do that. Comcast cant do that. T will be at $40+ very shortly."
"Homegamers......Collect your 7PCT Plus Dividend For The Next Year....Then, Collect....An INCREASED Stock Price !Super Opportunity...Take ADVANTAGE UNDER $29....."
we will keep the dividend ......................................................... how many hours ago was that./ no credibility
total disagree .. probably i will sell my shares of this ever happen .. I bought it only because HBO was unique ...
Masters of poor aquisitions at their finest. I am out from 31.8. Maybe back at 27.
"Everybody's trying to put a number on the new stock that would be formed, and how much it would be worth to AT&T shareholders. Consensus seems to be somewhere between 5 & 8 dollars per share of AT&T stock you own. I'm okay with that."
"“AT&T revealed Tuesday afternoon that they will replace their iconic globe with a rainbow colored flag with an  attached, to prove they are woke”."
Grandma’s out. Going long !
"I'm investing because I like HBO MAX better than NETFLIX. I can watch movie theatre movies at home. Netflix has an overabundance of low-quality film (high quality too). HBO MAX appears more focused on high quality content, and for me it feels more fitting."
"Prince Jared Kushner, may be turning to stock market,as noted by Matthew Lohr. Jared not much for sports,buying American or hunting; needs the action of business.Matthew Lohr, my source is trying to interview Jared."
Some questions. How soon will T cut the dividend? Will they wait until the merger is approved or cut it sooner?. Will the Feds approve the merger? Not a guarentee. What happens if not approved? Would T reinstate/maintain the current $2.08 dividend or cut it anyway (probably).
Back under $30 is a lock
"T couldn't sustain its share price as a dividend company, when it was the top dividend aristocrat. Now I'm supposed to buy into it being a growth stock? Nope, I'll be back at 18$ a share."
"Melinda, call me. I can comfort you in your time of need."
Funds are buying again Bad time to be short AT&T
"AT&T now has even more incentive to increase HBO and wireless subscribers. Overtime, T will begin to reflect the post-merger value. Hedge funds have already modeled this and have a good idea of when to start buying."
Monday at 2pm.....T will participate in a UBS conference.
"My entire board is red. No, no, not T. T is GREEN! If T stays green today, watch for more upside soon."
About the only way the Old Guard shares would get shaken out is the scare tactics by Cramer for his hedge fund buddies
I'm seeing an article on Seeking alpha calculating a dividend of cut of almost 45%; from .52 to .29/share!
We have to stick together and hold all our shares so that we don’t sell off with the big market fall that is coming. Stay strong. Go T!!!
"Ad revenue is the key that's why they don't get rid of it... Reporting stinks""Kagan’s forecast, which was first reported by Variety, predicts that Fox News Channel will make $1.32 billion in advertising this year, while CNN will make $773.1 million and MSNBC $723.1 million. Each amount represents an increase from the previous year: up 7.9 percent for Fox, 11.7 percent for CNN and o.8 percent for MSNBC"""
I thought getting rid of CNN was supposed to be good. lol
"TMUS had a nice report, but one day investors, money mgrs and analysts will wake up and say ""wait, we're putting an x multiple on this? it's a communications company......now AT&T, they have a streaming product, so part of their valuation should get a streamer's multiple!"""
"Right after he said the dividend was safe, smh. Can't count the number of times these CEO's have done this, tell people the dividend is safe and then get out the sickle...."
INTERNATIONAL GROWTH!!! Discovery and TIME WARNER. It is a major development for stockholders. Forget the little 7% dividend. So it goes down to 4.3% and you get a growth stock for free. Wake up and go to a therapist if this doesn't make sense to you. If it doesnt you should not be in the market. You need to be in a mental institution.
"Think about it, there spinning off the Directv and Warner segments of the business, that’s revenue not coming in directly to att. Att will be solely a wireless 5G play with half a company why would anyone think they should still pay a full .52 cent a share dividend, are people really that crazy. Your getting shares in the spin-off company which could have a huge growth potential, which in turn will lower att core stock price, you can easily sale the shares in the spin off and but back att if you want the dividend that bad. I’m holding long and a divy cut is small potatoes in the big picture of things. We talking a year out, nothing is even set in stone yet and people panic over a few cents a share which the company doesn’t have to pay out anyway. Keep listening to these nbc jokers and sell and people like me will pick up your cheap shares, for every seller there’s a buyer"
I don't know why shareholder are panicking about the dividend being cut. 7 percent to 3.5 percent is still a higher dividend than most stocks.
"T shaking of income investors, to be replaced by growth investors :DI am not selling, in fact I am probably going to buy more (over time)And people are reacting like the dividend is going to zero, which it is not, will be cut by -40-50%, and it will become way more sustainable. Will be a leaner and meaner AT&T in the future (hopefully even allowing share buy backs)"
does anyone know what the dividend will be after the spinoff?
Strong Buy recommendation
HBO Max driving some enthusiasm among T investors. Great momentum likely to build going forward.
Now we know why Warren Buffet invested in Verizon instead of ATT
"It is kind of funny. I had a lot of May 21, $32 dollar covered calls I did not want to get exercised and T was heading well above that before this Merge deal came out. Well, now those shares of mine will stay mine. I sold covered calls twice already this year on 4,000 shares and made some nice premiums. I am holding a total of 8,141 shares between my Traditional IRA and my Regular Brokerage account. For simplicity, I was not planning on selling any of my various holdings in my brokerage account this year. Just makes for a simpler Schedule D. So I plan to sit tight on m Brokerage T shares, and see what happens."
"T to spin-off and merge Warner with Discovery (DISCA) next yearfor those who can't sift through the details and do the math (including all the media ppl):-DISCA pays 43bil cash to T, net impact of debt exposure to T shareholders across both companies is 11bil reduction-T gains 71% stake in new company valued at 59bil-T current dividend maintained at 2.08, next year T dividend estimated to be 1.12-next year each T share receives 5.78 value of new company stock based on current valuations-synergy from merger estimated to improve streaming margins by 3bil-establishes Warner/DISC as top 3 streaming content provider, and most diverse catalog-provides global presence for further streaming growth of Warner media-dividend reduction will fund increase in capex to promote growth in wireless business-provides greater growth for both segments: streaming and wirelessin summary:-about 5yrs of dividend cut will be offset by upfront dividend of stake in new company-growth prospects for both segments vastly improved which should offset dividend cut further and allow for potential dividend growth-the deal provides path to growth of 40% for T shareholderscons: eventual reduced dividendpros: everything else"
"Plus 4 pennies on a big market day, short the average volume...something is very wrong.We'll find out on next week."
The market likes the deal. That’s not a surprise!
Own T. Wondering if in this deal shareholders will get shares in the two merged companies?
"The Mare of Easttown is the best show on TV. Wow, what an episode last night. Kate winslett has wrapped up the Emmy."
Analysts 12 mo. price target for T range from 16.00 to 36.00. Tells you all you need to know about analysts.
that merger will be key to level the game plan with Disney and Netflix...very nice potential market cap for AT&T almost 2 folds...Stock will rise
This is how T always does it. .40 cent drop here....28 cent drop there....15 cent drop next day....nobody pays much mind...then 1 day you turn around and it is back around $28 - $29. Runs back up to $30 - $31 for ex-div....and starts the drop to $28 - $29 again. Like clockwork.
"Another unmitigated shareholder value destruction from the management that brought you the failed TMobile merger, the DirecTV blunder and overpaid Time Warner. The Board and EVERY single C-suite executive HAS to go. Now."
"AT&T1. Debt Bad.2. Free Cash Flow (FCF) Good3. Dividend Good (will see 1 cent raise by year end)4. Last Quarter: Good5. Prior 8 quarters: Bad6. Depreciating (businesses) assets: BadConclusion?Mildly risky, excellent dividend paying stock with long term restrained growth. The meter has a slight tick in the positive side of the scale."
"Barrons compared the post spin-off assets with current valuations of comparable companies like NFLX, DIS, VZ and came up with $30-$41 value of current T shares with T worth $25 and new-company worth $5-$15. Of course, this value was always there, but the share price never reflected it. I will stay with T until the deal gets closer. If it trades any lower, I will hang on, if it trades to $33+, I'll unload it once I get to long term gain status."
Don't believe Stankey again: the new T will drop the dividend all together. There will be no dividend.
Dividend Cut...T goes to $25!!
next year's T dividend estimated at 1.12/share based on 40% of 20bil 2022 estimated cash flow.special dividend of 70% stake in new company estimated at 5.78 per T share based on 59bil valuation from DISCA marketcap (16bil) and Warner acquisition (43bil)--reportedly merger is being valued at 130bil.current year T dividend still at 2.08/share. 2021 yield estimate for T at $30 share price is 26.2%
"T's stock price hasnt moved in 25 years, Fire every single executive in this company and start over. Absolute trash of a Stock AND you boomers are losing your precious dividend. so whats the point of holding T now?"
What was the Times Warner value in T books.
Not sure why DISCA is down while T is up. The deal is a win/win for both in my view.
The last CEO Randy made terrible mistakes. Buying Warner media was the biggest one. Glad I sold 80% of AT&T between 35-38.
"Volume 164,783,826 Avg. Volume 42,856,406BYE BYE!!!!"
"Thumbs up if you're planning on holding $T upon the release of ER?Tends to disappoint.Buy it back cheaper on the other side of ER.Given the results of the auction and the official increase in leverage, its almost a given this will tank."

I just added 500 shares @ $32.18. 0.0646% yield.Nice
"What do you think, is the dividend cut coming immediately or not until announced transaction is concluded in mid 2022?"
"NEWS Wire This AM (Positive) !AT&T (T) is a veteran in the subscription business. From telephones to television, AT&T has been a dominant force in this world for ages. And thanks to its noteworthy acquisitions of Time Warner, HBO and Turner Broadcasting, AT&T has one of the biggest footprints in the streaming industry...with the potential to grow even larger.With its almost incomparable array of assets, AT&T's streaming services stand to draw a lot of interest. And while it does not approach the industry in the same way that Disney or Netflix has, the telecom giant is still likely to emerge as a winner. HBO alone already has over 44 million U.S. subscribers, and that number is expected to skyrocket in the years to come.CEO John Starkey noted in a press release, ""Our number one priority in 2021 is growing our customer relationships. It's about more than just adding to our customer base. It's about expanding the growth opportunity in our three market focus areas and also increasing our share within each market."""
Let’s hope for a BLOCKBUSTER OPEN. T shareholders will get 70% of the new company according to what I read.
They did a terrible mistake and soon dividend cut comes next
I think this is just a temporary bounce and T is headed to under $25. Just look at how Archegos impacted stocks dropped and then kept dribbling lower and lower. And in that case it was not even a problem with the businesses.
"The deal will give shareholders value, especially if NewCo will rise. I don’t sell. I will grab the last dividends until 2022. Good bye panic sellers."
"I Personally Want To Thank the ATT Management For This Deal......Instead of $33, I'm In @ 28.72 !THANKS AGAIN !"
"Upon Discover-y, we find that they’ll cut the dividend by 50%."
I'm bailing. There's no way T can compete with T-mobile and Verizon.
AT&T Is in Talks to Combine Content Assets With Discovery - Bloomberg
When was the last time that you saw AT&T has the biggest percent gainer of all s&p500 companies? It is right now!
To all the bearish move on we don’t need ur opinion
"People are talking inflation when its deflation that they should be worried about. Once the stimulus checks are spent, it will be deflation time."
Gonna be on a call with Stankey tomorrow about the merger. Anything you all want me to ask him...
Owning T is like undergoing an Autopsy ....while still alive

I have held t for 10 years and use all there services .I hope all you stock holders use them too. internet cell TV and buy there in store products. GO T.
"Could this be the double for the end of the year? FANG stalling, dividend stocks favoured, streaming and 5G play. Hold on to your hats!"
50% Dividend cut Lol all the longs always talking about Divided being safe
"If T management give us Stock shares for the NEW companies, isn't that like Dividend compensation for the dividend cuts? If the new free stock given the shares holders goes up, wouldn't that be better than one year of dividends? I guess it really depend on how they will issue the new company free shares to the investors of T, I know it won't be one for one, but even half a stock every full stock of T, that would be great news to the investor and depending how the new stock price in, it might be better than being paid dividends, it would be consider a stock split in my book, just getting new stock in the new company for free."
Warren Buffet said Sunday he likes AT&T....And Cramer too likes it
WSJ's Heard on the Street column is positive on AT&T's exiting media
T market cap is 220b and Discovery market cap is 16b; they are creating a new company with a market cap of 130b out of a thin air. Something got to give.
The truth for this stock lies somewhere between cheetah and the $60 PTs on this board. Obviously $60 is not a realistic PT EOY but $38 range is. I’m here with my $29 average and have no plans to sell EVER. We locked in our 7% dividends and therefore instructional level returns if you can go LONG
The real question is why TMUS and VZ are down. They should have risen on this news.
"So instead of .52 a share dividend, what will the dividend be?"
This is a very good deal for shareholders. The sum of the new Warner company plus the ATT business is worth more than $32! The Media empire was never given the proper value.
"Hope it goes really really low, so I can buy more at a yield close to the current yield - after the dividend is reduced. I am thinking 15-20$ range and I’ll spend all my cash lol"
"Why do people own a large percentage of the the 7 billion T shares? For the dividend. Now management tell them that the dividend will but cut and they will get shares in speculative company whose value remains to be determined. The majority of people don't hold T because of its speculative potential; they hold it for its dividend and plodding growth. Now they have no idea what the spinoff will be worth or what dividend T can realistically pay. Considering management makes more money in one year than the average American can save in a lifetime of work, they apparently had little incentive to clearly and passionately to explain to shareholders how this deal will dramatically benefit them in the large term. An average student taking a PR 101 course could do a better job."
"I bought ""T"" because of the tech's/chart...,but the news is getting better and better. 59 calls bought this morning. GLTA"
"I read something about T issuing a special dividend when the deal closes next year. Is this true and does anyone have any insights on this? By the way, I am hanging onto my shares to see how this all shakes out."
Check this post tomorrow. Big gap up in a.m. Moves higher through the day. Big week and more. Watch and learn.
"Check my posts on this. Dividend was too high, with no corresponding future revenue increases to justify. Dividend cut means much lower sp. Their dividend policy was unsustainable, especially compared to VZ."
The key to RECAF is Brent crude over 65 a barrel. My neighbor bought in @ 50 cents and closed yesterday at 8.26 feels it’s going to 30 . Take a moment to look T fans . Prime Rib and my famous potato’s on the grill . My dog bought diamonds for my bride for Mother’s Day . Enjoy your day

Well we just had a lesson as to how Wall Street deal makers create value for shareholders.
"still very cheap at these prices. saw your big buyers come in. their debt is still concerning but the company makes enough money to slowly pay it down. one more great quarter and then stock will fly. of course, prob nothing crazy but $38 would be great!"
Where's cheetah? The stellar AT&T earnings release must have gummed up his digestive system.
"The T option premiums are very weak right now. The 5/28 $31 Puts are currently selling for .24. Even the Calls are weak. The 5/28 $32's are only selling for .33. I'm sticking with the Oils for now. The Put premiums for both BP and FANG are both a lot higher than T. Not much interest in T options right now, either Puts OR Calls."
Nice rally on 47+ million shares. Congrats to us longs!
They say 43 billion in cash!!! where is this cash coming from? are they shifting debt from AT&T to the newco and call it cash? in any case 71% of newco belongs to same owners so it looks they take money from one of their pockets to another. I guess that happens when you buy a company full of water...
$29.13!!!!!!!!!$33.71 24 hours ago.
"Get in now, 30 is still cheap"
AT&T cutting its dividend LOL
"$33.71 @ 9:45 AM yesterday. Now, 23 hours later trading @29.39.Incredible."
Might be going up Faster now than a Vagicell trying to find his Tmobile Battery!!!
Thumbs-UP if you believe T will surprise and break-out after earnings release this morning
"Listen to the experts and they will make you poor.Examples: Macy's traded between 6 and 7 a year ago and the experts said it will go bankruptbecause of Amazon. Today it's above 20!DowDupont split itself in 2 (DD and Corteva) again negative reaction, DD went as low as 27 Corteva to low 20's. Today DD is 85 and Corteva 47."
"It takes money to make money. Or as a poem I like says: You get more with money / Than with milk and honey.T will be huge in a few years. HBO MAX will rival Netflix, which is a 200 billion plus dollar company alone. T's debt is just part of business and means to making T great again, one of the biggest and most important companies in the U.S. Who knows, it might get put back into the DOW 30. But until then, I love the dollars T is making me. I love, love, love it."
Stankey must go. For violating fiduciary responsibility to shareholders.
Buy more buy more
32$ then straight line to 40 wit volume
"Justified divvy cut... the only way without looking totally weAK to take down the divvy payout, is to spinoff a company that does not pay a divvy.. old tw paid one.... not this new one... either we are at 40 or 20... 30 is not an option.."
Shall we say $32.30+ close today? Why not.
This is a $40+++++ stock.
Disney streaming is for little children and to me worthless. Netflix I canceled and after watching HBO MAX I found the best streaming service. HBO Max is better than any other streaming service.
T broke support so by end of the week it has to fall below $23 as next support level is $22
This is quite the stock right here lol.
"Stankey doesn't speak for me. He is not doing what is in the best interest of shareholders. We want our dividend retained. As such, Stankey must be FIRED. WE HAVE NO CONFIDENCE IN HIM."
What happened to the uptick earlier in day. This stock should be up at least two dollars and now it is down. So why is it down. Not good if dividend is cut no matter what the deal. In long run it will hurt sales of stock.
The deal regresses T back to a phone company/ISP. No competitive differentiators. No innovative products or services. Just a commodity. Sad.
Best buy signal....when Cramer says sell.....
"Keep buying this stock will be taken to another level ah very high quality level , I am so sorry for those who sold today"
A positive game-changing corporate announcement would light a nice fire under this sleeping giants back-side.
"I am unlearned on most of this, but I have an idea. If some light doesn't squeak through this tunnel soon, vote out all of T management."
I see AT&T taking another 10% haircut. Patience
"I have a simple model with regard to the TW deal.At the time of the deal, T was at $35 a share.It is now at $29 a share.In exchange of the transfer of TW assets to Discovery, T get 71% of Discovery.Discovery's market cap is 16.83 B and that represents 29% of the future company. The 71% that T gets is worth 41.2 B or $6 per share. The 43 B that T gets in a combination of cash, debt securities and WM retention of debts represents $6 per share of benefits to T. The total benefits to T is 84 B or $12 per share..T spent 120 B to buy TW. This included the debt that T incurred at the time. Now T gets 84B back. The loss is 36B or $5 a share.Recall T was at $35 a share at the time of purchasing TW and the net effect of the loss (of this TW to WM to Discovery ) is $5. The share price of T should be $30, if all else is equal.Final conclusion: Additional sell off is not warranted as far as the value for T is concern.The dividend is a different matter. Even here, at the time that T bought TW, the dividend rate was 2/35 or 5.7%. In the future the dividend is probably around $1.1 per share. After subtracting the $6 per share, the benefit of the Discovery/Warner Media stock from the present value of $30, the future equivalent of the T is 24. The dividend rate is 4.6% which is still lower than the 5.7% then but not too bad.Please let me know of any significant errors.If all this seems reasonable, then I think I will stay put and ride this out."
"Unless T buys a mining company that mines metals, I'm not optimistic."
"T shedding Warner, VZ shedding Yahoo/ aol. Both are dumping the content/ media assets. Looks like they want to focus on delivering the stuff to the masses similar to ‘midstream’ pipelines for oil/ gas. Comcast being the third pipeline for media delivery.Folks, it’s all about delivering commercials to the hypnotized minions."
SELL FOR $31 NOW........Or$25 In A FEW DAYS !Look AT AFTER HOURS !
AT&T might have one of the worst board of directors out of any company.
"I Agree , David , Like The Idea Of Having 2 Dividend's , And Most Debt Paid Off , And That New Stock Will Make Huge Profit's , GLTA ,"
Buy the panic dip while it lasts.
Warner Bro. has a bunch of movies in the pipeline. Steaming is here to stay. Theaters will need to down size and change the experience all together. Should make for more profits not less. Cinemas are the middleman to profits!
Cramer in bed with Comcast...they are getting left in the dust.
"Thanks, my paper-handed friends."
did someone say.....shareholder approval?.....why yes ....they they did
"New company will have significant scale and investment resources with projected 2023 Revenue of approximately $52 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $14 billion, and an industry leading Free Cash Flow conversion rate of approximately 60%."
"Bargain price, back to $33 today. Buy, buy,buy."
So I'm confused. Will current ATT shareholders actually get Discovery stock?
Morning T ~ inflation. All about inflation today . It’s a real concern
"AT&TOnly time I've ever liked something Cramer said. On his show, he spoke of how they didn't even speak of the coming 50% dividend cut and said it was ""disgraceful."""
"If T can keep its costs down with the crazy inflation that is due to come and raise prices at the same time, they’ll make out fine by paying the debt with a less valuable dollar. But if they can’t and add revenues drop, watch out! Ratings dropping for CNN are not going to make keeping that revenue stream from becoming a trickle extremely difficult."
I can’t believe I’m saying this but I am now Long T. Seems to me now it’s a relatively safe place to park cash. Going to take advantage of this near term uncertainty.

I take less dividend if the stock is going over 40 anyday.
"The general electric mess started with a 50% divi cut as well. It's ok though, the executives still got their raises."
"This is from a Jason Kilar memo to staff. It really makes me wonder what could've been. I was starting to feel the momo. .....we’re going to drop the Friends Reunion next Thursday, the ensuing week brings the launch of an ad supported HBO Max, In The Heights premieres the following week, and at the end of June HBO Max will be going live in 39 additional countries. That is a pretty good six-week stretch and there is so much more to come on the heels of it (21 additional launches across Europe, DC FanDome, our strongest stretch of motion picture releases since the pandemic started, vital work over at CNN, and much more). This is a defining moment for us. And I recognize that it will take all we’ve got to keep collective focus on the mission. We can do it :-)"
Bottom line with me is that over the years the various pompous CEO's and Board of Directors have screwed up enough. The have lost HUGE value over the years and now they hose the dividend...I'm out...done with these #$%$
"i sold my Puts today at open for 250% gain. Right now $T is oversold with extremely low RSI. Likely a relief dead cat bounce tomorrow esp. with oversold market today (likely a sympathy bounce tomorrow in markets). Bought small amount of weekly close at close today. If $T hits above 29 tomorrow I will make another 300% gain lol. I ride this up and down. If $T is red again and I'm wrong, I'm okay as I made so much money off $T this isnt even 10% of my profits that I'm risking going into tomorrow."
"T the almost 7% CD. good for the dividend but not much else. But,, at that rate, don't worry too much."
Didn’t have to mute any of the Phil’s. It appears that they are self muted.
"If Warner Media assets are so lovely, why get rid of them so quickly? For years, yahoo kept alibaba because it is valuable even though it wasn't fitting strategically."
COB price is irrelevant for this type of stock. Trend is up is that matters. Way up. You will be lucky with only a semi great close to add more.
Volume/ share price says the big boys are dumping
People hear dividend cut and yah can’t blame them for getting spooked. The price better run up
"""My effort is to make sure we are generating sufficient cash to ensure that we're able to sustain our dividend, pay down debt and also operate our businesses in a very efficient way,"" Desroches said today.Dividend is still a priority."
It’s on sale. Mark it!
Omg T is staying green...keep adding
Not ready to believe the selling is over.I think the market Makers are doing their jobs trying to slow the fall.Time will tell
"T is having a great day. It's also interesting to see what's happening to the open interest at the May 7 $32 strike. The open interest for the Calls at that strike have dropped from 53,000 yesterday to 26,000 today meaning that a combination of short sellers (covered calls) and long buyers have closed out there $32 strike positions today. For the short sellers it means that they're anticipating a close above $32 tomorrow and they want to protect their shares from being called out. For the long buyers, it means that they'd rather take the premium gain right now on the calls they bought earlier than pay $32 for the stock after tomorrow's close. Sounds complicated but it's not really. It's all the psychology of the market. Looks like the pendulum is now swinging in the direction of a close above $32 tomorrow."
LOOK IF THE MARKET THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS GOODNEWS FOR T THE STOCK WOULD HAVE BEEN UP TODAY NOT DOWN!!! AND MORE SO AFTER HOURS WISEN UP SHEEP!! MY HUMBLE OPINION ONLY. WAS THIS STOCK ALSO 31 10YRS AGO?
Been wanting to get out of T for awhile. Have held it for a number of years to get the dividend. Just wasn’t getting a good feel for the stock. High debt etc. I found my time to sell early this am. I’d be kicking myself if I didn’t sell and then watch it drop so much. I’ll be watching and may re-enter after the dust settles.
Benjo MUTED!
So let me get this straight from a shareholder's perspective. Essentially giving up 29% (since shareholder retain 71% of the new company) of HBO Max to Disc for over $40B for T to pay down debt. Sounds like a good deal to me. It can't be that simple. Am I wrong in my math in combing the two companies?
"I'm guessing we end above $32. The $32 and $32.50 calls are about even, but there are three times more $32 puts than $32.50 puts."
Will it stop at $25. I’m not sure. Maybe $20.
Morning T ~ dead cat bounce . The economy is still a mess and inflation is real . I am bull and love making money but feel the markets are overpriced except dish and CVS :)
$25 - i Was long this morning got out; Unfortunately i think the dividend cut is a killer.
I just bought 100 shares of T and 200 shares of $pltr.
The reason why the disappointing jobs report is because nobody wants to go to work anymore when they get free money and can relax watching HBO Max at home eating Bon Bonsall on the couch. Very lazy generation
"Premarket moves down this much are just hunting for stop losses, and unfortunately many of you are giving them away. I'm sure this finishes the day above $31."
Great Dividend
"IQST making moves as they may be acquiring 10% of Millicom the owner of the Latin Giant Tigo. Tigo is the major disruptor for telecom in Latin America, currently working on a 5G upgrade. IQST may fit that bill as negotiations are underway. IQST currently sits at .50 a share, but not for long."
I raise target from 32 to 38 for now.
"I think that if this merger goes through, and I think it will. That this was a part of the plan that T has had in mind for a while. After it is complete T will rise past all previous levels, and holders of T will probably have the newly formed company shares to be determined on amount of T shares held at the time. So I will hold, wait, and see what happens. Good luck to all T stock holders."
"AT&T Stock Just Got Two Upgrades--AT&T (T) stock fell hard after the wireless communications giant said it was getting rid of its media assets and cutting its dividend. Now, Wall Street sees an opportunity.The stock rose on Thursday and was moving higher again early Friday. Sentiment on Wall Street appears to be shifting: Two analysts upgraded the stock.New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin upgraded AT&T (T) to Buy from Hold with a six month ""tactical"" price target of $35. Coming into Friday his old target price was $29 a share. He says the dividend cut and higher capital spending should create value for the company in the long run.UBS analyst John Hodulik also upgraded AT&T (T) to Buy from Hold, raising his price target to $35 a share from $32. He likes the new focus on the wireless business and says the balance of risks and potential rewards looks more positive following the recent declines."
Does anyone not expect the rest of today's unimpressive gains to fritter away as well after a few days? See you around $29.50 next week.
"T investors not only getting a dividend cut, but losing an entire years worth today alone. This is horrible, what a wretched company T is."
"I was amused by the CEO saying those looking for income can take their investments elsewhere. He left out that after the trashing of billions of company assets the last few years by this executive team, perhaps everyone should take their investments elsewhere. I certainly have no confidence in the leadership at AT&T. At this time they are looking around and thinking they should be more focused....like T-Mobile. The difference of course is that the folks at T-Mobile actually know what they are doing."
"If you haven't figured out that the Bai Dung admin is deliberately flying the dollar into the side of a mountain, then you need to call mommy, ask her to fix you some warm milk and cookies and stay in the basement. You are not equipped to witness whats coming in the near future."

I just watched our CEO on CNBC for An extensive interview. It was incredibly impressive and informative. I feel very good that Mr Starkey is running this ship. What a breath of fresh air he is. Go AT&T!
"Question: I have about 10,000 shares of T, can anybody estimate about how many shares of the newco I will get, when & how much will that stock be worth? Trying to figure if I lost or gained on this merger."
Cramer should not be aloud to voice his opinion on CNBC!! He owns Comcast.
Come back when it’s 28
"The volume is insane. Market is holding up T relatively well, considering the volume of selling."
Aint nothing happening till June 2022.
"Morning shares where up 4% and now this ship tanks. 7% dividend was high risk, but they got Dragons for support. Now they sold all dragons and cut the dividend. My rat can swim fast to pirate islands. Maybe buy some shares of tobacco."
BARRON'S estimates new divi will be $1.11 a share or about 3.7% based on current share price. Nice cut for the CRAMER followers. Cramer recently said BUY BUY BUY on this stock based on over 6% yield. CRAMER!
Long term holders have been collecting dividend and diversifying over the past 10 to 20+ years ago. Some of them are holding lost of ATT shares for free by now. This will be a chance to bring more money into ATT again. Don't underestimate long term holders. They will eat your lunch.
I'm curious then where the HQ of the new spin-off will be located.
"6% spread today, slready, from high to current low. Will 31 hold?"
"PLEASE go spam your non-related holdings elsewhere, Nora."
Nice paper gain for my 18k shares today.
Probably will eliminate divvy for rest of the year
Why is telecom one of the only down sectors today?
On another note: Don't listen to JIM CRAMER and the CNBC talking heads....Cramer knows NOTHING!!!

"And who's to say the dividend gets cut ? Yes, they might cut the dividend on the att side, the new stock might pay a dividend, so you're right back"
"Has the BOD announced if there is a multi-billion $$$ break-up fee to be paid by shareholders (ala T-Mobile) if this merciless beating of a ""deal"" does not go through? Tune in for the next exciting episode of ""As the Turd Swirls""."
"Isn't it possible that when all the div-focused owners have left the building, the opportunists will come in buying, saying ""well, I can get a share of T and a 4.5% yield, PLUS a share of this new company that is the second largest streaming player out there?!"" I get the ayer of the div-focused owners - i do feel they were lied to or misled at best, but looking ahead, I think investors may eventually see the prospects as a great risk/reward."
I knew to load up the truck the MINUTE that Cramer said sell.
It looks like the merger is not binging any value to AT&T. Just moving around assets.
"I had a candid meeting with my Analysts today regarding AT&T because I am not happy with the PPS....I reiterated I appreciate the Dividend but is it worth my time? Response was Unanimous ""Yes""."

"Here is the problem, if the new company will trade at 15 dollars a share on x date, att will drop by the same amount. Just like a dividend, stock pays and drops. So your all going to get a loss on your t stock, a capital loss when selling the shares as it will take years if ever for the new t to recover. Further more with a 40% div payout, why out it now? When it drops on x date the new dividend will represent a far higher payout on a lower t stock price..."
MANAGEMENT LIED ABOUT THE DIVIDEND BEING SAFE!!!! AND U WANT TO LINE THEIR POCKETS!!
"The hierarchy and relationship dynamics amongst the Board, Management and shareholders goes like this: The board is the advocate for shareholders. They ensure that the mgmnt of the company (personnel and otherwise) is best positioned to produce the maximum return for shareholders. They do that by hiring the ceo, effecting board-level policy and maintaining oversight in a number of areas. But sometimes, it just doesn't feel like this does it. Feels like mgmnt runs the co. and the board is a rubber stamp. How else is it possible that after all these years, with negative return, the board is advocating for the shareholder return. I mean, wouldn't they have gone nuclear by now???? These returns affirm they've done their job on behalf of shareholders?!? It's a simple concept, but it rarely gets questioned, absent a shareholder activist."
Looking at the chart of T for the last 5 years. Stock price has gone nowhere but down. What are these guys doing at the top !? Entire corporate board should be fired and replaced with new and fresh people.
Seriously! We take our beloved and priceless WB and HBO max that are finally showing momentum and combine with a company whose claim to fame is 90 day fiancé. Are you kidding me!

WHEN I AM ON THE TREADMILL WATCHING TV MY HEART RATE IS IN THE 130'S IF FLIP BY ACCIDENT TO CNN MY PULSE SHOOTS UP IN THE 180'S. FAIR WARNING.
I don’t own a lot of T....just a little over 1000 shares for the dividend. Been reading the headlines but not the fine print. Love to see an attempt to reduce LT Debt. Direct TV dying...Content not a great fit.Are any shares in the new venture being issued to T shareholders or is this basically a write down?
"I guess the normal scenario now is; lawsuits, then Moody's credit downgrades, then more lawsuits."
I bought my daughter a year of HBO Max and new AT&T Cell phone for mothers day. I'm doing my part.
Seems to me T had pretty much the same dividend before the Warner purchase. The T dividend comes 99% from the ATT communications part of the company. I think the Spinoff might not effiect the dividend...... unless the new Discovery/Warner company pays a dividend.... then the T dividend would decline and be made up by the additional dividend from the new company.

"HOMEGAMERS! I Posted Yesterday......SEE YA @ 29.50 Today, $30 SOON!Once Again Guys ?"
"I'm in a very good spot holding half MO from 44 and half T from 30. If T goes under 30, I load it 100%. If MO goes down substatinall and T goes sideways, I go 100% MO.Then again, I can stay half and half, collect almost 85K dividends per year and yawn."
The new media company created by combining Warner media and discovery will be extremely profitable and will be reflected in the stock of this new seeming company.
T is beginning to blow Verizon away. All the nonsense the naysayers (mostly Verizon munchers) were spewing has proven to just be trash talk. T is clearly winning and has the better plan. CONTENT IS KING. DISTRIBUTION IS QUEEN. Verizon is going to have sell some stuff and buy CBS/VIACOM/PARAMOUNT in order to surviveagainst the T train.
"I read an article on seeking alpha where it says that after the spin-off $T will be reduced by $7.50 (from Warner spinoff where you will receive 71%). So, based on today's price, $T will be about $22. Dividend will be reduced to 8B to 9B, so roughly $1.20/year. This means the new $T will pay roughly 5.5% of new share price. So, for people who doesn't want to own the new 71% of Warner+Discovery, they can sell now and wait until spin off to get back into T. I think this is a great value right now for those who want dividend and growth."
"Interesting: A reverse Morris trust (RMT) allows a company to spin-off and sell assets while avoiding taxes. ... After a reverse Morris trust is formed, stockholders of the original company own at least 50.1% of the stock by vote and value of the combined or merged firm."

"I sold my 5000 yesterday after owning T since 2016. Honestly it's a relief, I almost sold when they ended up spending another 23 billion on CBand. We'd just turned around and things seemed to be headed in the right direction. BUT unfortunately Stankey lied to our faces: ""Our deliberate capital allocation plan allowed us to invest and sustain our dividend at current levels, which we believe is attractive."" Knowing full well that the deal was in order by April 22nd. So he can't be trusted with my $150K. On to a CEO that has integrity. The chart has collapsed past the 50 and the 200. I don't really care if after a year there are new shares in a new company and unicorns and rainbows, it comes down to what you want to be invested in and it's not this turd with it's CNN and crooked C team. I didn't actually lose money here but I could have made much more in simply investing in SPY. Good luck you all."
I just manged to unload 6K shares at 31.20 in AH. I can easily see it dropping over the next few days to below 30 at which point I will consider getting back in. I still have another 2k shares in a different account but will hang on. This totally sucks as I was really counting on those dividends.
"RE BRAVEHEART mem--""HOLD"" Well we see what they did to the Braveheart at the end of the movie...carved him up...kinda like T. As for me I am glad I finally cut the cord and real glad I have been reducing over time the opportunity cost was no longer worth the dividend. And now the dividend is??? Nah too much drama on this cable for meI finally pulled the plug and cut the cable and the portfolio is up nicely"
"We have to see what comes of this, but I'm much more comfortable w/ Stankey at the helm than Randy. I think he understands shareholders have been waiting a long time. I don't think Randy knew that there actually were shareholders......Just pay packages and grandeur."
added another 1000 shares at $28.76.....now 105K.....current dividend plus new shares next year looks good
"you got paid less, so the divvy is sustainable.. and you got growth of 5G, and separate stocks..Nice."
"T is doing good.Boy, look at that FANG. I sold the May 21 $75 Puts on Apr 22 for $5.40 each and rolled them to the May 21 $80's on May 4 for another $2.00. The stock is now $79.23 so there's a chance I could get shares Put to me this Friday. If I do end up with the shares I'll sell the June 18 $80 Calls which are currently selling for $5.00. If I don't end up with shares and the Puts expire worthless this Friday, I'll sell the June 18 Puts which are currently selling for $5.65 each. Either way, that's another 6.2 - 7.0% gain in the next month."
Easy money - buying the stock and writing near term calls will fetch you debt amount of money on a weekly basis.I’ll write $30 calls every week and collect whatever I could.As long as you hold the shares you should be part of Discovery and collect the dividends.It is a great buy here at these beaten down prices.Discovery share is worth $10 minimum and T is worth $23/24 easy.Gl!

"T is the future, as the USA went from defined benefit (company retirement) to defined contribution (401k). The evaporation of decency is corporate USA dna, and eventually all companies will eliminate the divvy. Anticipate accordingly."
Until Cramer can tell me the value of the stock dividend shareholders will receive for each share they hold in AT&T then its ridiculous to make a sell recommendation.
Thank you to the end of panic selling. I almost sold. 10k strong @ 28.73
Any upgrades yet or are the analysts still picking the report apart trying to find any shred of something negative to jump on T and bring it back down?
All indicators are telling me buy buy buy.T is only one of three operators in the US that will rake money from Wireless and Broadband biz
I’ll take the stock appreciation (since $28) AND the 2.08 DIVIDEND. What’s not to like.

"All my T money will now go into VZ. Sorry, but today was the last straw. Worst leadership of any large company I can remember."
dividend getting cut by more than 50%. shareholders left holding bag.
The question is: will ownership in the newly-formed media company by T shareholders be worth more than the offset of the 50% lost in dividends and T's stock price decline (given that it will decline). Does anyone have insights on that dynamic?
Dividend Cut Imminent??

"funny we haven't heard from chiapet. those covered calls he claims to sell would for sure have to be in a loss position now. so he could a) sell them at a loss and be happy w/ the gain in the underlying stock, b) let his stock get called away at a lower-than-market price but keep the premium or c) hope that T takes a big turn down. In any case, he'll lie to the board, perhaps through multiple aliases, and say how he someone kept the stock, kept the premium and enjoyed the full appreciation of the stock. piker. like a teenager. should be on the reddit board except he's way too uncool."
Any upgrades so far? It should start to come any minute.
so what are we going to do about the CNN problem? nobody watches and it is synonymous with misinformation and propaganda. how is that a good business model?
For every share T you have your going to get .71 shares of the newly formed co. from the way I understand it. If that is the case I'm not moving.
I told you big divestiture of media assets coming.Did you listen....nooooooooo
Morning T ~ read some interesting posts regarding T-Mobile and ownership of T mobile. I do not own it just follow however they are real competition to T & Vz . Personally feel the stock is way overpriced
"So confused. Asked if he’d own T now, moffet said “nope, before I had 6.5% yield and a growth kicker from hbo. Now I have 4.5% yield and no growth kicker.” But he’s ignoring completely the idea that you’re also going to be handed x shares of spinco that has a value of x. Granted we don’t know the value but to ignore it seems erroneous."
no dividend???
"What's up with those constantly bashing a conservative investment? Yeah, we all know T isn't going to 40 anytime soon. However, it doesn't have to with its dividends."
So they are saying discovery stock could be worth 35 % more with this deal. As a att shareholder I will now own 71% of discovery. So why is this going down? Serious answers please

"I kind of feel sorry for poor old ANDY because he's kind of caught between a rock and a hard spot. Either he's lying about owning 103,000 T shares, which is probably the case, or he just got hit with a two day paper loss of $275,000 on those shares (OUCH, OUCH, OUCH)! Think I'll have a scotch on the rocks right now with a couple of nice big juicy strawberries. Yummy."
"Keep T, sell the new company after taking profits, then buy more T so that you don't lose on the dividend, if that is most important to you. For many people it makes sense."
I’m holding because we’re getting shares of the new company and if I’m correct will be getting around 15 dollars per AT&T share. But I really don’t understand the spin off. AT&T just had a great quarter and I was estimating free cash flow to hit 30 billion dollars this year. Hbo max was really taking off and the media business is recovering. We would have had enough cash flow to pay down debt and reinvest. Tbh I would have even preferred if they cut the dividend to 0 and reinvested it all
Before Warner media T was 39 and rising. So why can’t T be there after deal. We are a stronger communications company today. Less employees more customers less churn.
Rumors out there that Lily is disgusted.
"Here’s the question if you don’t like the fact that att is cutting the dividend NEXT YEAR, not now and spinning off segments of the company which if your a shareholder you will receive stake in as well, Why still post here stupid stuff I’m selling, I’m going to another stock blah blah blah, ok you sold bye move on right? That’s the thing people are followers, you sold cause of what someone else says, not once looking at the big picture, the deal isn’t no we’re done yet, and all I see and hear is they cut the dividend. Well it hasn’t happen yet and won’t for atleast a year, that’s 4 more payouts, Guess what you left money on the table didn’t you, I’ll take your cheap shares, I thank you for that"
"People all of a sudden behaving as if this company doesn’t have profits, dividends, assets or revenue..."
To the cnn haters....like if u have such visceral hatred for it then sell the stock on principle. If u don’t want to sell then why not just acknowledge T is keeping it bc they believe it suits their strategy. It’s weird to me all the railing about it. No one is forcing u to own the stock and I do hope u realize stankey isn’t reading the message boards.

"1:57 pm ET May 16, 2021 (Dow Jones) PrintBy Cara Lombardo, Dana Cimilluca and Drew FitzGerald AT&T Inc. is in talks to combine a big portfolio of media assets, including CNN, with Discovery Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would mark a major strategy shift for the telecom giant as the traditional TV business faces prolonged pressure.The talks, which cover CNN and other parts of AT&T's WarnerMedia division, including the TNT and TBS cable channels, are advanced, and an agreement could be reached by Monday, the people said. Should there be a deal, AT&T shareholders would own a big stake in the new entity, some of the people said. The people cautioned that a deal isn't done yet and the talks could still fall apart. Other details of the potential transaction couldn't be learned.HOLD YOUR POSITION T is going HIGHER!"

This MB is more active now than a cheetah trying to outrun a Peloton bike
This deal will NOT close for over a YearDividend cut will come at that time Real Question is - How will the Market - Price the SpinoffValue of Netflix or Viac?
Please read the 8k. It clearly states that expected future free cash flow from T will be around $20 billion annually and that out of that amount T will pay up 40 to 43% in dividends. That represents a 50% dividend cut from current levels. T paid almost $17 billion in dividends in 2020.
Cheetah How are you trading T right now?
T management Clueless. Years of totally disasterous acquisitions and now shareholders pay for it with a 50% cut in dividend and a stake in a third rate streaming play. T's WHOLE INVESTOR BASE IS INVESTED FOR ONE REASON.........THE DIVIDEND! Which is now cut in half. The Stock will be under pressure more months as income investors move on and finally lick their wounds. JUST ONE BAD MANAGEMENT after another at ATT. Stephenson SHOULD GIVE BACK EVERY PENNY HE WAS PAID BY ATT. WE should claw back every bonus and stock award.
"Normally, the panic selling takes about 3-4 days to dissipate I’m waiting to see where we bottom and will try to swing trade or use options to make a few bucks"

"AT&T said it will use the $43 billion proceeds from the tax-free spin-off of its media assets to pay down its more than $160 billion of debt.The telecoms giant also said it planned to cut its dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders in dividends, to the low 40% range, down from around 60% in the previous quarter. 60 to 40 is a 33.3% haircut. From $2.08 to $1.38."
What is the dividend now? What percent and what’s the dollar value?
Sounds like a huge law suit coming forth from shareholders?
Terrible corporate America leadership. A month ago after a good earnings shareholders were told the dividend was safe etc. Fortunately I bought this last year when it had a big dip and I was in the green with a few payouts on top of that. Don’t kid yourself this is a terribly run company. They unloaded two of their assets at a MASSIVE and I mean MASSIVE loss. They will lose their aristocrat statues whatever who cares. Now since it’s broken they don’t have to worry about cutting again and breaking the streak. Buyer beware.
Now you don't talk so laud; now you don't feel so proud!Down 10% from morning high!
I wish the best if luck to you all but im finally out of this position

"I like the deal and see at as a win/win for T and Discovery shareholders. The immediate selling is out of fear/emotion stoked by some analysts. Other analysts are quietly saying what I just did. The 6%-7% dividend was nice, but the stock had no growth. For those who want income, maybe they should consider a REIT. T is not a REIT. I'll take a 3.5%-4.5% dividend accompanied by stock in two companies with high growth potential. Just my opinion-- no emotional response. I'd sell if I didn't like the deal."
"Hey Cramer - how about the Wall Street bankers that advised and financed the deal. And what about your “homework” mantra ? Kind of glad this company has direction now. What was the alternative...slide into oblivion as your friends at Moffett Faber we’re warning? Markets drive change, sometimes for the better. Not all of us time crypto like you, we just don’t have the connections."
T just borrowed $ for some nonsense auction at record valuation
"The NEWCO will make you rich, just wait and see. You will still get the same dividend until the spinoff is complete."
I see this as a win. Look at the share price of Verizon and T Mobile and Netflix and Disney. Plus still a dividend with T and possibly the new company. Would welcome any input.
"Would be funny if it ended up green. This deal really changes very little for T shareholders. Should get back to 31, as it was 2 days ago"

Big boyz are shaking the tree. It will close higher from here.Gl!
Are they going to cut the dividend? I’m not sure but I thought I heard this on CNBC.
Little did I know when I bought puts at 31.5 earlier today to cover my long position that the selling would get out of hand in afterhours. Unfortunately the shareholders are paying the tab for a deal that cost way to much and have to wait until 2022 to get their share in the new company.
"I could buy 40,000 shares of T at 30/ share. So I’d get 28,400 shares of the new company on top of that????"
"Most of the T BOD were involved in the disaster buying of media which now has been or being unloaded at a $90 billion loss. Current CEO also involved. Yet all are still part of T Mgt. Ex CEO was also part of problem but left after a nice severance. Sorry, but all playing the investors as suckers to hold the emptying bag of value and dividend cut. What will be left of T will be a highly indebted mess with a lower dividend. Maybe, ok probably, Discovery Mgt will do a much better job of managing media content. For these reasons I dumped all my T and wish glta."

never does it NOT disappoint........ thats ok............. in it for the long long run
"For those not understanding or casting doubt b/c they're short....or whatever. This is what's happening:Another common reason for spinoffs is when a large company with many separate divisions has a stock price that management feels understates the value of those divisions put together. By spinning off one or more of those divisions, management hopes the combined stock value eventually surpasses what it was as one consolidated unit."
"A recent Barron's article estimates how to value T going into the merger. The remaining T (telecom business) will probably be worth ~$25 per share based on the ~$8B annual dividend if it trades at a similar dividend yield to Verizon. The Warner/Discovery spinoff should be worth anywhere from $5 to $11 right now if it were priced at Netflix/Disney multiples. Therefore, T's pre-merger share price should be in the range of $30-$41. I think the midpoint is a safe estimate at $35.50 with potential for more upside if HBO Max has solid momentum with the international launch next month. I am long AT&T and feel like this is a great price to buy. I'm hoping for $35 by year-end."
"Jason Kilar is leaving, just reported. He was a true star. AT&T is officially just a cell phone outfit."
Things that stand out...1) Just late last week it was announced HBO Max was being expanded into 39 addional countries by end of month and 21 in Europe before end of year. No word then on what was to be announced Monday. 2) Kiler was not in the loop on yesterday’s announcement. 3) He received a 52M hiring package in 2020 4) He already has contacted lawyers.
Yes T goes up into x-div and then sells off some afterwards. However the recent earnings were excellent and T has received many upgrades. I don't think the normal after x-div selloff will be quite the same % as usual. JMO.
no boarder problems no gas problems no free money problems and things are good as gold at t!! if cnn says it must be true!
"Can you imagine the class action lawsuits to follow, the mismangement and lose of Div. and lose of share price, yrs. of lawsuits to follow on this mess !"
You know the shorts are getting worried when you start seeing fear mongering articles coming out lol
"If you look at the next five years, this new media company will be merged with another media company to take on Netflix. That company will have the back catalog of nostalgia TV viewing and modern stuff. Only room for 2-3 streaming services and this new company will be one of them. You really have to take the long view on this deal."
Are the big boys moving in on the shares all you Cramer listeners Sold?
"Let's cut to the chase,,,,,How many shares of the new company will I be awarded as an owner of 2,000 AT&T shares?"
Thanks to the management for destroying shareholder value.
"After a sharp sell off on heavy volume, you'd think we could get back to at least $30 but the sellers are still there on every uptick, dumping shares. I bought back my $32 strike covered calls and sold $30 strike expiring tomorrowI'm still waiting to see where this bottoms out and volume returns to normalUnlike many, I like this deal if Zaslav can performgood luck"
"Add more share tomorrow if you want to make money , this will be a take off"
The chart on T shows screaming sign for a rally on this stock.
Repeat 3 Times. T will never see $29.99 again !
"So no one seems to even mention the ownership in the spin off. Yes, your dividend is going to get cut, but you're going to own the majority of the streamer spinoff, which should trade at a high multiple like other streamers."
"Good morning how is our #$%$ today? Down again, lol what did I expect."
"If you didn’t sell the news this morning, you would regret it..just saying"
Kramer tonight will be talking about dividend paying stocks and their benefit with higher taxes￼. I guess the stock should go up today if he talks about telephone he will have to do an about face
"Neutral to positive on this move. The share price has dropped because the dividend-focused holders are not happy. But for those interested purely in the value of the enterprise, decoupling the telecom from the media business makes sense, as it allows the media to be valued separately, and higher. And NewCo will have Discovery management.It also looks as thought they're spinning off #$%$ cost rather than at a loss. So value isn't being destroyed.For those who are focused on dividend payments, they can always sell their NewCo shares and buy more T to increase their dividend payout."
Hurry up if you have not added back yet.
2 bucks down from its high today.
Jesus
45% dividend cut??!!?? How can that be? T has always promised to preserve the dividend.
"T is doing good.Man that Diamond Energy (FANG) is a goldmine. I sold the May 21 $75 Puts on 4/22 for $5.40 each and rolled them to the May 21 $80's on May 4 for another $2.00. The stock closed at $75.28 on April 22 when I sold the Puts and closed at $84.21 yesterday. If it closes about $75 on May 21 I'll walk away with a 9.8% gain in 1 month. Now that's some return! Same thing is happening with BP, another oil company, but not to the same extent as FANG. This is like legalized stealing."
"MO, 2nd best performing stock of ALL time just sitting there for the taking."
Short it
Don’t you think a stock paying close to 7% dividend is unrealistic? Two answers...one they shouldn’t be and are going broke paying it...or two it’s really undervalued and should be at $60 per share and that puts the dividend in the 3.35% range. It was heading towards that range before the pandemic. Most everything has come back or more. And the pandemic really shouldn’t have hurt this company. Very interesting stock for sure.
"with same PE as VZ, you are looking at 36.. here we go.."
Afternoon T ~ saw this inflation picking up in March and now it’s here. Over done ? Some inflation is good but my fear the economy is still broken due to Covid and inflation can further damage
nice little pre mark BS pump yesterday. I was going to bail on the open but i was on vacation and was too busy to notice the time.
Spin off is great in the short term for T shareholders as we cash in on the new company collect 2 dollars per share while we wait and AT&T will cut debt and be able to invest more in 5G. The only negative I see is that in the long term AT&T would have gradually cut its debt organically and been a media/telecom with a huge moat
"Just think, a whole dividend lost today. Closed 47 cents down plus down 3 cents AH as I write this."
Beat top and bottom line.
About to play a movie on HBO max
"HBO MAX, with its 9.99 ad-supported version, will steal even more customers from Netflix and Disney. T's stock price is, no doubt, going higher."
"i have 500 shares of AT&T for many years, ill stick around for awhile just to see how things will work after the spin off, if nothing good happens then im out, i got AT&T at a good price many years ago so they already paid me so much dividend over the years, so if i decided to leave im not losing anything, i'll move it to my COCA COLA holdings"
DO NOT PAY OVER $27
"I see a lot of clueless posts about how many shares of the new co T shareholder will get. Assuming discovery shareholders get 1share, T will get .173 of the new co. What T and the new co. Will trade for is up to the market. Analysts think T will trade for around 25 and the .173 of the new co. Will trade between 5 and 15, which means they have no idea about the value of the new co. If you look at the 5 day chart of T and overlay DISCA, the are big buyers of T who then short .173 shares of Disca. They only do it when they can lock in a price of the new T below 25."
Can anyone tell me when will the div be cut in half??
Until the value of the new shares is determined everyone is just guessing. Interesting that all comments about this business model have been positive. Discussion should move in this direction and stock will rise IMO.
Most of the market seems to be a falling knife right now. Except T which means somebody has turned on the Flee to safe harbor sign again
"Yahoo FinanceAT&T admits it made a terrible mistake getting into media business with Discovery deal: analystBrian SozziBrian Sozzi·Anchor, Editor-at-LargeMon, May 17, 2021, 12:55 PM"
I can see by the recent stock price of $32 that the news by AT&T and Discovery went over good. LOL
Volume 37 million shares in less then 30 minutes
Think of all the people around the world who can stream CNN now. DISCA will be a hyper growth company.
@Jay That was point I was making
This is unbelievable they did this!!! It's good for the employees but kills the Shareholders
Let the fireworks begin..stock price appreciation AND 7% dividend. Go “T”!!!
"HBOMAX outperforms Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ becoming number #1 rising 64% in downloads over the weekend."
Keep buying my people buy abs buy
"I don't care what others said, but all my portfolio was going down except T when I got it at 26, those dividends kept my portfolio in the positive in and now it up big time. Don't put down those old legacy stocks people, I know all of you want to hit the next Amazon or Apple, me I like my old dividend paying stocks companies!!!"
"AT&T paid less now, but it is worth more.. Make sense, we do as you AT&T bears argue many many time.."
"It sounds like a spinoff. The real question is relative valuation of the two media entities going into the WB + DISC entity. DISC has a forward P/E of 12.6. What valuation will the WB earnings / assets get? NFLX is 48. VIAC is 10. And then how much debt does AT&T shed and have the new media entity pick up? Until all of that is understood, it seems pretty hard to know whether the deal is ""good"" for T shareholders. At first glance, the idea of separating a telecom company and media company seems like a good idea. I don't think there are many genuine synergies between the two. I've seen that argued by multiple analysts."
"Discovery CEO Zaslav's New Contract Could Bring Him More Than $430 Million -- Market TalkBY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 6:06 PM ET 05/20/2021Yahoo blocked the full story."
AT&Ts sp rise is coming.. I’m long and T plays a nice role in my retirement. I’ve owned this laggard for well over a decade and I simply feel a change in the air. When Wall St let’s it go be on board or lose a nice chunk of change. Imho .
Last night on fast money ￼Carter the technician on CNBC says that AT&T is turning bullish and should have more upside.￼￼
Can not see myself investing in a company that just gave assurances the dividend was sacred.Can not see myself investing in anything run by Joh Stankey who pushed and architected all the deals that were done which are now being undone at the shareholders expense.The dividend managed to get raised every year when Randall was on a buying binge based on Stanky’s recommendations. Now he wants to unwind his mistakes at the shareholders expense.The companies I invest in have a CEO that I can trust. John Stankey lost all credibility after cutting the dividend which he promised was not going to be reduced.This will be the second coming of GE. What a disaster in the making.
"6 days before you bashed AT&T again, you said you endorsed AT&T for the first time in decades...Should you be on Hall of Shame as a stock market commentator/entertainer?Is this a joke?"
Sold yesterday afternoon....good luck longs....but my investment thesis was high dividend and a high growth streaming service hidden inside we upside....both now gone. Time to move on...I doubled down on Pfizer and FDX which I believe are both well undervalued.
can you say the 28's
AT&TOh boy. And we haven't even seen the sellers that will selling tomorrow after they watch Cramer and others tonight.
He said he isn't cutting the dividend. He said they'll resize the dividend.
"To give T your money serves only to gas up Stanky’s Gulfstream so he can travel & tout the Discovery merger. Anything left over will buy more executive mansions and planes, leaving the investor Simps with devalued stocks."
"Volume 4 x average, a $2.00 intraday loss, & with under 10 minutes remaining, very close to session lows.Yup, that's a bullish signal if I ever saw one.....lol"
Longtime holder of T dating back to late 1990s. Paid around $25 per share. When you add dividends of over $32 per share paid since then plus Comcast spinout and Comcast dividends since then (another $32 per share including dividends) you get $64. Add in $30 per share today and at $94 for total returns. Like owning a non-dividend paying stock you paid $25 for now worth $94. Not too bad overall (minus taxes paid on dividends). Not too thrilled with dividend cut but willing to see what happens going forward
Don’t sell. Remember the dividend is the most important thing. Holding my shares forever!
CEO should be sodomized for what he did to dividend and the share price
"9,99$! Wow! WarnerMedia has some really aggressive business plans."
The companies have officially announced the deal Monday morning
They are cutting dividend. Are they planning to pay more later? Or is this now a growth company?
"We're getting AT&T TV ads saying AT&T micro-fiber internet is 20X faster than cable internet.AT&T U-Verse is gone.AT&T TV is here.If all this is true,Won't AT&T end up #1 in the near term future?"
This deal may be good for ATT for a future capital gain........ but not so good if you are desiring steady income from a dividend.
"How about valuations? T EBITDA $49B, F P/E 10. TMUS EBITDA 23B F P/E 39. So if TMUS doubles the EBITDA their P/E would still be ""about"" 2 times higher than T. Go figure, what company is a better buy today."
So I sell the new shares I don’t want and buy more ATT at the lower dividend to try to get my income back? What BS is this?
Management screws Long term investors again !they will NOT be returning .
Spectacular day today
On 7/1/2000 GE traded for $55.59 a share with a healthy dividend. Then the stock began to fall. $22.00 two years later. I remember conversations like this on messsge boards then about GE and their cutting the dividend.T seems to be following a similar path.
"LOW VOLUME: The ""big buyers"" were waiting for T holders to panic, take profits, or overthink their decisions to hold, and thus sell. But there were fewer sellers. Holders know T is worth a lot more and going higher. Buyers will have to pay up for shares...drive the price higher. DON'T SELL! Not yet, anyway."
Thoughts on the 32 call for tomorrow?
"I believe that T is on it's way to $40, and higher. Just a matter of time, and increased profits."
Dividend of new company hopefully $1.00...TELL US STANKEY
"hopefully, They issue shares to T share holders.. (treat it as one time divvy pay..)This will definitely unlock the AT&T value...TMUS is traded with PE of 50?"
Why are they cutting the dividend by 50%. They now have less debt. Nobody will stay in this stock for 3%.
Without div T stock is pure junk buried under debt.
Wide reports coming in verified of AT&T shutdowns with it network and media
Cramer is mad because he didn't receive insider information before the announcement.
Buying opportunity.
34 to 31s in a day. Thanks Stankey.
"Don't sell NOW, based on something that will not occur until 2022 (including the presumed future AT&T dividend cut). We still have the full dividend until then. And even then, we won't be losing our AT&T ownership - we'll be gaining the Discovery/WarnerMedia company besides our AT&T."
Amazing how so many people have no self-esteem. CEO shows that he couldn't care less about you and you still hang in there. I guess it's like a battered wife that gets conditioned to it and can't leave.
video streaming gaining momentum... 5G growth..ATT should be $60
"Cramer is trying to beat a dead horse, since he and his hedgies are trying to short T.....but that is now over Cramer...T will rise ...new stream will compete well against noflix and chid station Disney...."
"And let's not forget the $6,000,000,000.00 loss on the T-Mobile debacle. Where is the accountability?? Has anyone resigned? No Has anyone been fired? No Business as usual. The good old boys!!"
This is unacceptable!! I'm calling AT&T tomorrow and demanding to speak with the manager!!!
Be careful guys. This could adjust down to a 6% yield based on a projected 50% dividend cut and reprice under 20. That’s what She’ll stock did. It’s recovered some.
"OK I’ve seen enough. This thing is going to $40 (at long last). Finally a genuinely positive report, the first time in many years."
So they announced a big dividend cut. 8 billion less.
"HBO MAX had the best chance it will EVER have to take flight during a pandemic with everyone at home, starving for entertainment. It didn’t. It won’t. All those subscriber numbers were people getting HBO MAX free with their plan. They know that and the sold TWX. T has a better chance to grow than HBO Max does and that’s not a good thing."
Lol cut ..Nope to the contrary a special dividend 10% plus on the cards per rumour mill. ...omg  can someone watch Cramer's window and good measure nets around hedge fund shorts.
T is showing the power of having Warner Bros to create content. It’s a money machine for creating content that Netflix doesn’t have. Disney + and HBO max will dominate. AT&T to $60. HBO max and 5G without Direct TV to hold them back. This is going to be quite a run. Hold on!
"If you own 1000 shares, you get over $2000 in dividends by 2022. Simple maths. Not that any of you own 1000 shares anyways."
AT&T is one of the best investments now and We feel incredibly undervalued stock It's Dividend is Strong and it's Management too now. It's a great opportunity to park some money.
We get to listen 1 year of continuous T bashing by Cramer every day on CNBC...Horrible job by T leadership today trying to socialize the deal.
Under the category of “people are never happy”. A month and a half ago we were saying that they wish T would just go up a little. Now with it up 10% from there we are saying that we hope it goes down ex-divy so we can get more shares since we don’t have enough! I want more!!!!!!
T is a stock that trades in narrow bands. So all I do is buy near the low of the band sell near the high of the band all the while collecting the dividend and juicing the income by selling covered calls.I recently sold on earnings day and pocketed the gains and now T is in it's normal fade pattern. I will get back in when the fade stalls and ride the next wave up.Rinse and Repeat over and over.
Two analysts upgrades on T this morning: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/att-discovery-analysts-upgrade-jim-cramer-052121
Don’t see it ever going back to the $29’s. Don’t even see it getting to $30. Everyone knows the dividend is never going to be cut and that will support the shares. I’m sure we stay above $31.
Business schools should use AT&T as a textbook example of how NOT to run a company.
Outrageous. Just called company and they would not give me any information on how many shares of new company will we get for each share of ATT and would not comment on dividend reduction of old stock. It was up after announcement and now down close to a dollar. We are going to lose our #$%$ on this new venture. Management does not give a #$%$ about shareholders. Only for the millions that top level management is going to take home with inflated income packages. As a retiree I am going to lose income. This company is due to decline over next few year as a an income stock. At my age that is a disaster. Examine your portfolio and look for better dividend income that is secure. Management just gave you a good colonoscopy.
"A little more clarity is what's needed. How many shares of new company will existing T shareholders get. What will new market cap, debt & dividend of T be after the split, etc. I think a leaner T concentrating on 5G and customer service with still a respectable dividend is good news long term and the new spinoff should offer growth. I guess we will find out. Good luck everybody."
"Looks like the Cramer effect is in full swing lol, the guy's a douche can't believe ppl still listen to him before doing proper DD"
Looks like we are on our way back to $47. Cleaned up a lot. Last pandemic stock that will regain its highs. Wish I had more money to get more.
For all the wrong reasons.John Stankey and Randall Stephenson - products of the BELL aristocracyDavid Zaslov - actually succeeded in the competitive world.Who is best to make all this work?
"Cramer said to sell so it must be time to buy. Back up over 7% dividend. Earnings release is April 22nd and earnings will be ok, slightly below a year ago but better than last quarter."
"All the bashers are forgetting how much the ""newco"" could be worth. It will be a high multiple stock as will the new ATT. We could all get rich(ER) here."
"Finally, traders getting their heads wrapped around this deal.... took them long enough"
You'd think the deal was closing tomorrow. Long ways off. In the meantime millions of people will continue using their smartphones and watching movies and reality shows.
"There's no real analyst opinions about the 71% stock T holder will be getting with this deal, hey the new stock may surprise you, it's worth taking a shot."
upgrades are a trick orchestrated by high value investors to get stock price up for a quick s sale. sell the pop.
"T made terrible acquisitions under Stevenson. His pension should be clawed back.I own T shares and really don’t know if the Discovery move will work out .In the meantime, I’m going to try to swing trade T at least once in June and if T declares a $.52 dividend in July, I’ll sell it right before the ex-dividend date and buy it back the subsequent week My current cost basis is $29.85 and I’d like to get it down to $29Good luck"
Wish they would have given more information so stockholders could figure if they're new ownership in the media company will more than offset they're lost in dividends and T share price decline.
BOO YA SKEE DADDY !Thanks to the Cramer Publicity (Any News Is GOOD News)T UP Nicely Pre Mkt !
To the moon!!!
added 2.7m video users out of existing 44m users.. That is huge growth..nFLX only 4m out of 200M...
where does it say shareholders will be issued shares in the new company? all I've read is that shareholders will own 72% of the new company. this seems like att will own 71 % and it's shareholders indirectly.
and I just save myself 10% because of this drop... for this half investment.. LMAO.
"Good News: Dividend cut will end up sustaining the yield %. Bad news: Share Price dropped like a rock, value destroyed!"
"Pat: what did you do with the proceeds from your sale of T. Have you put it to work? Did you buy dividend paying stocks with high yields? If so, what did you buy?"
Bought T for HBO Max asset. Always thought HBO can be a much bigger player. Seems T didn’t want to spend for new HBO content & was limiting growth potential.... I will convert to the new company stock 100% ...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SejazQoCWPA
"After all the dividend players bailing out, a close above $30 would be very bullish."
They are going to have to do a lot of explaining tonight and tomorrow as to what the shareholders are getting other than a lower dividend.
Sold. Will buy back in when it drops a bit due to confusion/uncertainty in the minds of investors
"Never thought I'd hear myself say it, but T is the one bright spot in my IRA today."
Incredible earnings report. Particularly the latest HBO MAX numbers in comparison with the latest Netflix numbers. Cheap stock!
the business is not good and dividends cut.. why didn't this stock drop more? what is good entry point?
T is doing a great job at gaining customers. And verizon is suffering the consequences.
Finally
"AT&TCramer called the deal ""a non-transformational clownshow"". lol"
Great opportunity to buy coming soon...
"Everyone knows the dividend is going to be cut. The price is naturally going to go down. I’m not short, but I won’t be buying until it drops significantly. Waiting for a better opportunity."
"Red again after hours, apparently it hasn't bottomed out yet short term. I'm glad I don't own any of this dog, I wouldn't buy T if they paid me to do it. I haven't seen a riskier investment in years. Where is it going to go if they cut the dividend again before the deal is finalized and where is the entertainment company going to go if they can't compete with Netflix and Disney? Both are very possible IMO."
I have looked at tons of articles. Can anyone explain how many shares of Newco we get for every share of T? Lack of clarity is frustrating
NFLX is down about 9% if ATT's results are good maybe some of that money will be invested in ATT.
"Inexcusable if they cut the dividend. 99% of T shareholders own the stock because of the dividend & that's it. If we have to rely on the stock moving up in this market, forget it. I'm out."
I wish this stock would MOVE up or down. Even a huge sell off day would make me happy so I could buy more.
What’s the bottom?
"All one needs to do to understand what this 'new deal' means for shareholders, is click summary above & look at the one day chart."
The DEM wits just gave you the reason you no longer need to hold stocks and everyone can now become day traders and flippers of stocks nothing will be a buy and hold any more just take every gain .
So how was that ride down? Hmmm. Now all of a sudden the bottom hit on Wednesday and now a wild ride up to $35. All the upgrades after they intentionally drove it down. Got to love the bandits on Wall St. Hopefully you bought in and continue as it rides to $35.
Only 91 million shares dumped today I think the market makers are getting close to the top of their support level.
ATNT to the moon…don’t hurt me pls I’m just excited for T on its way to hit 40
"Remember STANKEY IS A NEW CEO! He gets stock options. He wants to accumulate them over the next 5 years a low prices, thus wants T to go lower or stay low. He will be able to cash those options out in 5 to 7 years at a higher price, and make hundreds of millions. So again, I say, he gets well over 25 million a year and options, so he is fine with T plunge, is actually incentivized by the drop, which is his getting stock options at lower prices. We are screwed, will have to wait three years for T to find its own again. Dang it."
You are looking at at a full year till this happens. I'll continue to collect my dividends and collect my new shares when it happens. Then I'll decide what to do. No need to panic. Hopefully we will own two of the top companies when it's done.
"The ""new"" Discovery will be worth 33% worth more after the merger - according to real analysts. T shareholders own 70% of this new spinoff. And, the shareholders are worried about a 30-40% trim to the dividend rate??Stop the crying & do the math! T shareholders will win after the spinoff. Dont listen to all the short-sellers. They are literally stealing your shares. Smart investors are buying here in the 29's."
"The initial pre-market action saw this as win-win; AT&T and Discovery were both up big. After both sold off today, both are a buy. Discovery got valuable media assets at a discount and the combined company should do very well. AT&T share in the win by getting 71% of the combined company, including 71% of Discovery (plus $43B cash)."
"According to some Wall Street Analysis based off similar situations T true value even with new Dividends is between 30.5 and 40, so panic for nothing?"
More heavy selling today. The selling climax will take a couple of more days and then let's see where this settles out
I am now long bc T is getting rid of commie news network. This is purely an income play for me. Company still will have solid dividend and can focus on what it should always have been focused on. I’m sorry to all who bought in thirties. But that divvy was never sustainable. And you knew it in your heart.
Fla. becomes latest state to enact restrictive voting law as DeSantis signs bill on Fox News
When will the div be cut? I assume there are things that need to be worked out before they do this? Trying to time my way out.
This stock is painful.
The T board member is explaining this as a bailout of T’s debt service. Stock is now trading st 29.58.
"Math just doesn't lay down. How can a company spin off 20+% of its business that has not contributed 20+% to the bottom line cause a dividend and earnings cut so drastically. There is a lot of smoke and mirrors going on here. Plus they retain 70+% of the spinoff and if and when it starts to do some serious contributions, They reap the benefits."
"The question is only one. Should we hold or sell. What is long run for stock. One year, five year, ten year? I have no answer do you?"
"Ok, woke up to this and I am reading and reading....Funny enough, I had increased by position in T by 30% last week. Sheer luck....I see that T is now a total return horse, instead of a dividend dog. Half of the div, will be replaced with growth that ATT has not seen in years and years. If this followed the model of Netflix, then you have yourself a well run managed company with solid growth ahead for years and years, with a solid (not rich) dividend. In time, the ""yield on principle investment"" should grow for old share holders, as the dividend is increased over time based on higher revenues and cash flow."
if it's such a good deal. Why did it drop from 34 down to 29. ??
With The Intentional Pump News of Jobless Claims *coughs* T is looking good got support lines on 29.29 and 29.25
"As much as I would like to pimp up HBO Max, I personally don’t see it as a daily driver go to for entertainment Most items there are old movie collection or niche items If it wasn’t for the monthly blockbuster there is no reason to get it.I hold Disney + even lower in this regards Netflix is suited for mindless and new items Ironically I have been going to my prime Video collection of late for a large number of off the wall and non mainstream movies HBO Max will have to keep the blockbuster carrot until the next GOT comes by in my opinion"
"""It is rare that you see a management team and a board actually acknowledge so clearly that they made a terrible mistake and that they're willing to undo it. So I actually give them some credit for it. Now it's not to say it doesn't leave behind a tremendous amount of wreckage, right? I mean they spent $175 billion for these assets and then three years later, they are unwinding those positions for what is kind of in theory, i guess, about $80 billion or so. So they destroyed a ton of value, but not many companies are willing to admit they made a mistake right away,"" Moffett said."
"Holy moly! AT&T Inc. is in talks to spin off its media business and merge it with Discovery Inc. in a blockbuster entertainment deal, according to people with knowledge of the matter, a surprising move for a company that spent $85 billion to acquire the assets less than three years ago.They're actually using the words spin off now! Wow, this is huge! Unless I'm missing something, T is basically abandoning its media aspirations. I think ultimately they might've succeeded but the street will love this! I think Stankey understood that he needed to maximize shareholder value, like it actually matters. Randy never understood that."
"Guys, Is best time to buy; in couple months will be 45-55."
This toxic company is headed to bankruptcy and multiple lawsuits.
Is at and t going to buy Bitcoin like Elon
Cramer is right. AT&T is a disaster.
"So this is how it all ends. After expensive forays into Satellite TV and Content Creation, ATT goes back to being a wireless company with half the dividend. And Stankey still talks about how the deal is good for investors. If it’s so good , then why doesn’t he allow a vote on it? I guess the rejection of Executive Compensation by the shareholders must have shaken their confidence in pushing things down their shareholders throats."
Buy buy buy! This is going to pop. t has finally done the right actions for higher share value.
Just great. Dividend gets a huge cut but the corporate salaries continue to get a huge increase. Nothing ever changes. The T shareholder gets screwed.
what will the new company be valued at? market cap and share price?
20 million shares traded in 8 minutes. Nuts...but I like it...th price going higher. Good fortune to us holders.
"ATT has too many people on payroll. Compare it to VZ, TMUS, LUMN ,, as a ratio to Revenue ...Too much bureaucracy, they need to move from Command & Control to process oriented management & leadership. Too many 'salaried' people waiting for exit packages, protected like tenure. Their problem has been execution for a long time. The good news is this is all 'management' in nature, I will hold at 7.5% dividend and wait for them to get their SHxT together. They have lots of assets, and will improve as the future of communications evolves. I think SUN MICROSYSTEMS years ago said it best, 'The network is the computer' ..."
Funny no one seems to be noticing that they was not a decline after this quarters dividend payout.This stock has been due for a trend reversal for quite some time now.
Lots of over reaction going on. Your getting 2 companies for the price of one. To much focus on the dividend cut that’s a year out. If spin-off is anything in the ballpark of Netflix you’ll wish you never sold.
"I am new to investing but base on what I have seen so far, T will still be $30 stock in the next 10 years. The only difference is that long term holders will have T and a chunk of the new company. Not bad."
People need to relax. This will all pan out and shareholders WILL prosper. Geesh. AT&T will always be a solid company. It’s now on sale. Thank you!
Time to oust the T Board and Management team.
"So, with the $32.16 close, here's what's going to happen to those 25,000 open Calls. For anyone in that group who sold $32 covered calls, they're going to get their shares called out. But that's not so bad because they made a nice premium by selling the calls in the first place and for anyone who wanted to keep their shares, they'll still be able to buy them back for only .15 or .16 cents more than they sold them for. Overall, I'd say the covered call sellers ended up with a winning deal."
T decided that picking up Discovery was a bright idea right after Discovery collapsed on bad earnings. You can't make this stuff up.
Stankey had no choice.Labor contracts still haven't been renewed.Has everyone forgotten they were extended?Has everyone forgotten the biggest refinancing ever?Has everyone ever run a business?Stankey was left with a mess that he helped to create.Replace him with a John Legere.TMobile's CEO has a high school education.
T is the gift that keeps on giving
"Sold at 33.50, should be happy, then why do I feel sick to my stomach. 24 years, time and work, cut Div. in half. Was taking the cash now and not reinvesting the Div. anymore, Got 2 cash payments this year and now this happens. If I let anyone down, I apologize. I hope I will be back, not if they cut the dividend in half. Look at this thing Drop. What a Sin."
"One last thought from my post in the top reaction thread chain..... ... if you want yield, like the Yahoo article suggest. The you must Buy QYLD for a much better yield and much better tax advantage, then T dividend .... However don’t take my word as a newly retiree￼ and also a holder of QYLD ... Diversification is key and being invested in T was for diversity, not particular the dividend , and now its looking like a T investment will be for growth diversity and still a fairly decent dividend after the merger in 2022... Anyway.... never have all your eggs in one basket... is that the saying? good luck to all."
Wait till AT&T starts to initiate buybacks early next year. You can say goodbye to these fabulous yields for decades.
"They get rid of worthless assets, but it is offset by a div cut. That's why the stock is stuck."
Let's stop dwelling on the mistakes of the past and focus on if this is a worthwhile investment moving forward. Clearly this is not the income generator going forward that it was in the past and the share price will take a considerable hit in the for those depending on the income stream now selling. If you're holding you better have the stamina to withstand the volatility. I have to believe that current management feels this is the best move now to build long term share value. I don't know how all the numbers are going to play out but whatever it's worth I'm holding and buying more T when I sell my NewCo shrs next year. Hopefully I'll be close to my current value of my T position now. If I got out at $34 yesterday I'd be happy but I'm not selling now at these prices.
Not a dividend cut guys... the remaining dividend for the remaining of T business after the merger. People are confused... it like you have a land growing fruit then you sold part of the land to your neighbor ... do you still have the same crop from your land NOW!...the merger is a trade off ... Unlocking the true value of T
"They structured the spinoff to make it easy to sell. The endgame is that it will probably be sold to one of the behemoths like amazon, apple, Google or tesla, for 100s of billion 5 years from now. again, good for T shareholders."
"Waiting to double my position when it drops to my price target. Never selling, dividend forever. You don’t lose till you sell and if you’re selling T then you bought the wrong stock or you over payed and are panicking. Good luck today everyone."
"I have been warning for YEARS not to trust AT&T management, that they are a bunch of arrogant pricks who think they know it all but incapable of managing a hot dog stand. They only got rid of Stephenson but, believe me I know, Stankey was the architect behind the miserable failed mergers with DTV and TW. Stankey has destroyed well over $70B in value and the Board does nothing.He and his cronies ought to be in jail for fraud. I hope they do and take Stephenson with them. Oh and by the way, claw back ALL their bonuses and stock/options of the last 10 years."
"Can't wait to start buying on the big dip, collect a higher % and then get the gravy of NEWCO shares on top IF it even goes through. So much time left for the wailing and gnashing. Hope the boomers exit enmasse to give everyone a nice purchase point."
"Cramer and Comcast are trying to hit AT&T so hard and why? Does Comcast want to buy your shares on the cheap? This is a great deal and Comcast is jealous. Don't sell your shares to Cramer and Comcast, we all know they're sleeping together!!!"
"bought @28 for the divi, i know i have a profit, i don't know if i will have a the same divi, i know when income stocks cut divi, the price will go along for the ride. Conclusion: sell, which I did. Other opportunities abound, don't need a divi cut hanging over a large position."
It will be hard to resist selling my July calls today and taking profits but I still think it has more room to run.
Lol. Deal won’t close for 18 months. Many will use this bounce to get out for good.
"Is Fauci running this company?30 days ago the dividend is in stone,now the dividend is vaporbucks."
"You can see there are a lot of shorts still hoping for a massive drop but if T runs green tomorrow, how many get scared and start to cover?"
BCE is Canada's ATT. Now it is the better place to be!
"BOLD PREDICTION: After NFLX falls from grace, VZ and TMUS will end up in a bidding war over the ashes of a fallen Phoenix. Plan your trades accordingly. You're welcome."
This is AT&T time to shine! 100% up side! And look at that Beautiful dividend! I bet the Analysts￼￼ come out of the woodwork’s with upgrades! ￼
"I am dumping my stake. I hold AT&T for streaming and dividends and they will get rid of both things that I liked about this company. AT&T will cut dividends by 50% and the new company will probably depend on free cash flow CNN, TLC, CN, etc... because they will need cash for new content, what a joke"
"Not only John Stankey lied to shareholders on the safety of their dividends few weeks ago, but he also lied to his own executives, Jason Kilar for example. Although Jason is the CEO of WM he was left completely in the dark with respect to this spin off and merger transaction. Can you really trust a boss that does that to you? Then John does a desperate town hall meeting this same week to placate WM employees concern about losing their jobs as result of future merger with Dis since John has been announcing $3billions in synergies (i.e., layoffs). John simply asked WM staffers to stay the course until the deal closes because he was going to advocate on their behalf. Really???? He had the opportunity to do so by requesting that Jason and other WM executives were left in key positions in the new company, but he did nothing. Instead, he is just telling them that he would be deeply involved in the process so that WM would be fairly represented. Raise your hand if you believe John or if you think that promise would accomplish anything. Sorry but I do not see many raised hands. It seems John Stankey is not trusted by shareholders after everything he has done to destroy shareholders value and stock price will continue sliding until he is removed from office."
Hey so i own 90 shares at 30.15 i bought early april is anyone able to tell me how ik if i recieved a dividend
Have you bought some cheap shares yet?
I would say buy at 20 ish and than hold
Netflix is worth $200B so Time Warner Discovery should be worth the same.
"End of day volume tells the tale.Very very large trades done today.Earlier the volume was being recorded as low,nearly half of normal volume at mid day and over normal volume at end of day.I wonder which Funds are betting heavily on T"
"My Outlook refuses to connect with ATT/Yahoo email. Support asks for my email addy to send help. HEY GENIUSES, MY EMAIL DOESN'T WORK! But I can BUY support. WTH?"
lucky we had a good earnings report. no real benefit to holders from the good report.
"If you don't know by now, let me tell you. The stock market is a roll of the dice. Manipulated in so many ways. There is no safe stock forever. T is held by a bunch of folks depending on the dividends to pay their retirement living expenses. Many of the same folks held GE and countless other stocks, that where thought safe. I held T for 10+ years for the same reason. Making money as a individual investor, has now become a hourly practice. Just look at the beating the nasdaq, big winners took lately, square paypal, I have many down 50%. I will say this, there valuation are based on zero profit and many are worth tens of billions. At least T has earnings. This board is a perfect example of Manipulated. Shorts want you to sell and force the price down and longs just want ""steady as she goes"". No such thing in modern times."
"The companies have yet to file formal registration statements detailing the transaction. But available details show the degree to which insiders are poised to benefit from a deal that shook the media and telecommunications landscapes on Monday, when AT&T said it would spin off HBO, CNN and the rest of its WarnerMedia division and combine it with Discovery. I’m only 3 months into trading, once I started with https://stockhaul.today/vrau3a and actually listening to the regulars on here , my performance almost doubled! It also lets you search to find unique stocks with relative strength outperforming the markets."
taxable event or no?
So as T Longs we should be happy if discovery rises now?
TBest article I've seen yet today was on S. Alpha and the guy said that T share price would be reduced by about $ 7.50 at the time the deal closes to account for the spinoff.
"So T will spin off 50% of its debt, shareholders keep their dividend of 2.08 and also get new shares in new media giant? My bet is that’s the plan and that would be AWESOME"
"Sold at 31 and change, they can go to hell. I have seen high dividend company cut dividend and and half the price. BP anyone."
Barron's Cover Story this weekend says BUY
"Once thing for sure is that T valuation is too cheap, even without divvy. (you know when compared to TMUS, or DIS) Perhaps, T should cut whole divvy so that stock have have PE of 20.."
"This is Incredible news for T owners , expect a gap up at the open tomorrow!"
"You get the dividend for the remaining of T business post the merger. The detail of merger is yet to come , whether shareholders will get a dividend form the formed company or reinvest in the new merged company. TBD.... Buying the dip"
I am not even a holder of AT&T but I will buy a share just to oust the CEO. This man is by far the epitome of incompetent managers. Does he forget it is people’s money and life savings he is throwing around?
lets go T
Almost 100 million shares dumped by 10:15 amTell me again how this is a great deal.Institutional investors are obviously dumping their positions
Why does ATT use CNN to undermine democracy?It certainly undermines our stock value.
HBO Max launches internationally in 39 countries next month. And launches in Europe this fall. I predict $35+ by year-end.
"Is Cramer's monkey brain pumping the NewCo yet? He said to sell yesterday, so today it will be a buy."
"Flying to 43 !! Yes, that's true."
"I'd love to see some of y'alls guesses about how low T will go over the next few days. If it got back down to 27 or 28 I might jump back in. There is just too much uncertainty at this point regarding dividend, value of the ""new co."" etc. for me to risk it. I bailed with my recently acquired 6K shares that I paid an average of about 28.5 for and sold them for 31.2. What the heck I can afford to sit on the cash for a few weeks or even months and wait until the details are clearer."
"Strong Buy recommendation by Kaufman, Davis, and Ginseng reiterated to private Clients. Cramer even said Buy Buy Buy AT&T..First time Cramer Strongly recommended AT&T in 16 years. Let's get AT&T above 40 where it belongs."
T is doing good.I rolled the BP Apr 30 $24.50 Puts that I previously sold on Apr 22 for .65 each out to May 28 yesterday for another .63 per share. I'd like to sell some May 28 T Puts but there's very little interest in May 28 T options of any kind right now so I'll wait. The T premiums are too low right now to do any trading in T. Very little interest in T right now.
This company thinks CNN is doing a great job losing money! Dumpster fire!
hope this doesn't fall below $29 and finishes strong around $30
"So, what will the new company distribution ratio be?Pure speculation, of course.Probably something like 1/25? GLTA "
"HBO Max eating Netflix lunch, time for some upgrades."
STOP SELLING!!! We need it to stay above $32 support. Do not want it to do a retest. Put your shares for sale @$50 so that shorts can’t use them.
“I’m not a trader. Just looking at the long term interests of investors. The reason-sizing of the dividend makes a lot of sense.”T board member on CNBC right now.
Mostly under the disguise ling term holders.Overall this split is great for shareholders.2 vertically focused entities.Gl!
"Sold my position today before it turned red and shorted the stock on top of it because well…they deserve it. Over the last two months we have seen them admit they have failed leadership and all of them are still running the company. They spun off their first bad investment with direct tv and now spinning off WM. They didn’t even get half of their money back on both investments combined. If your looking for a company with good leadership such as Apple, this isn’t it. What a disappointment."
Eventually people will come back to this once the drop is over. Old people are slowly hearing the news and dumping this for other income stocks. The young guys know the spin off is a positive for T. It’s all about 5g now and if they don’t focus back on their core business they risk losing the 5g race to Verizon and T-Mobile.
"Wouldn't have made more sense to perhaps have the details of the transaction BEFORE announcing it? Minor things, for instance, such as the NAME of the company they are creating... what the T investor is getting out the complete reorganization of T... what the dividend will be afterwards? Little details. Absolutely the WORST telegraphed announcement in history. And what happens if the announcement does come and it sucks for shareholders? Another ten percent haircut?"
"Inequality is fixed by going to school, and getting an education, and learning a trade, working, becoming civilized not by hand outs."
"I get it, the dividend investors are not happy. I plan on hanging in there, I want 71% of that new company. I think it's going to be a winner in the long run. It's going to take about a year for this transaction to happen, meanwhile AT&T is still going to be paying me 7%."
"When the markets are rotating out of growth and into value, due to Inflation concerns. You spin off a growth stock, and decrease your value stocks dividend. perfect timing."
"LOL how else could they get you to sell T before the next . 52 cent dividend LOL,LOL Scary you right out for something that will happen a year from now LOL,LOL and something you get a piece of the action as a shareholder in T. CON man Cramer LOL,LOL, LOL Wall Streets manipulator ."
I'm not a technician but T made a higher low and closed green on solid volume when the S&P 500 was red for the day. Maybe all the sellers are gone and we won't see sub $29 again
"I bought thhis stock for the dividend not for the growth it does not have and never will, so long att sold my shares."
"I am very happy to see green today, especially after the last few days."
better stocks out there
"What some thoughtful analysts are saying:""The dividend announcement was a “clear negative,” Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan IV wrote in a Monday afternoon note to clients. The company’s target implies a roughly 45% reduction in AT&T’s dividend relative to current levels, by his math.“This deviates from previous commentary in which we viewed management as the ‘gold standard’ in maintaining the dividend as a sacrosanct tenet of its value proposition to shareholders,” Louthan wrote. “This about-face from the strategy, which was to maintain or grow the dividend at all costs, will likely linger in investors’ minds for many years.”Louthan, who is bullish on AT&T’s stock with an outperform rating, noted that shareholders would at least be likely to see four more dividend payments at current levels since AT&T doesn’t expect the WarnerMedia deal to close until mid-2022.At current prices, AT&T’s stock has the highest dividend yield among components of the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.85% at 7.04%.AT&T shareholders will also get a stake in the combined company formed by WarnerMedia and Discovery DISCA, -1.60%, “so at least there is some compensation for the cut and the spinoff sets up the new company for a better long-term growth profile,” he wrote.Truist Securities analyst Greg Miller referred to the dividend “reset” as “clearly a negative event” but one that he deemed “likely necessary to avoid far worse conditions at a later date.”“Although the company reiterated the fact that it would be in the 95th percentile of all dividend payers with a ~4% yield (~7% prior to announced cut), when pairing this reduction with the anticipated tax rate hikes and increasing capital expenditures, we believe the payout ratio could be increasingly pressured after already dropping from our estimate of ~63% in 2022,” Miller continued in a Monday note to clients.He has a hold rating and $30 price target on AT&T’s shares.William Blair analyst Jim Breen called the dividend cut “somewhat surprising given the income focus of some shareholders.”“However, we note, post-close, AT&T’s dividend yield will be in line with Verizon VZ, -1.31% …at around 4.5%, which makes sense given the companies will now look similar from a business perspective,” he wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. “We believe AT&T became too broad in focus over the last few years, which restricted its ability to run efficiently.”In Breen’s view, the deal will put AT&T on healthier financial footing, giving the company more flexibility to invest in its 5G buildout. He has a market perform rating on the shares."
Dividend reinvestment day tomorrow!!! 6.9% on the new shares if we open 52 cents or more lower.
"T mgmt has forgotten that virtually all shareholders own T for the dividends. By ignoring the dividends in this deal and refusing to assure shareholders, they are forcing down the share price. Unless mgmt reassures shareholders the the dividend will remain intact, T’s share price will crash."
Sounds like a class action to me
"I always think , maybe I should sell and take profits, every time T rises above my cost ... And then I think... Hmmm.... tempted!!..... However T has Been down below my cost so many times in the last 10 years and also way above my cost as well... But do I even bother thinking of selling.... NO...... So may panic sellers, come and go every year .. And so many new buyers thinking that T is going to make them rich in a New York minute, they too will also come and go ever year.... If I do the math I’m making money, after I pay the taxes, of course, as ordinary income.. Not capitalized gains as the dreamers will do if T goes to $36-40.00 before a years time.... So if they do sell at $36.00 before the year of maturity,￼ they’ll pay 50% CGT when they sell ...... Or the panic sellers will buy back thinking they should of stayed put and will get unrealized wash sales capital gains tax of 50% for not waiting 30 days after the buy T again, and the. T will fall under the wash sale rule...... So admire US longs for making the dividend if you want too.... But understand this for sure, staying invested in T is the very hardest part..... Good luck longs!"
"BOUGHT LOTS OF ATT AT A PRESENTLY DISCOUNTEDPRICE=COULD DOUBLER IN A YEAR, ALONG WITH INFLATION=ATT = INFLATION PROOF.."
I've had a couple different stock spin offs in last few years and in the end I was way ahead. Hopefully this will too.
"Once the Warner-- Discovery is removed from T itself, how will the value of T stock be determined? will it go down by the value of the Discovery loss? ........Meanwhile, the value of Discovery, already under competition from other streaming companies will certainly intensify over the next year as they merge and begin to look for ways to compete against the WarnerDiscovery company......With the loss of half the T dividend and certainly almost no dividend from Discovery, any so called up lifting statements from Stankey should be considered mindless.....T spent over 100 billion to buy out Direct and then Time Warner, only to discover as others in the past have done that synergies never develop the way the big shots say they would....Many people still believe that todays' T is the same old AT&T of their parents generation but of course, if they looked at its history they would discover how one of the baby bells created after the feds blasted out T itself, re invented itself as AT&T again......Still millions of smaller investors,not the bigshots , have invested in T simply to get a strong, as they were told, almost solid dividend, simply because todays banks offer nothing to the middle class.....the poor can't afford stock and the upper 1 % who control over 70% of all wealth in this country, could care less about the dividend T offered for security......i think T has made a big mistake personally, whether or not i needed this dividend, simply because it had become the security blanket for the vast american middle class, aging of course, but anxious to have some real security......They have lost this security and its a psychological blow for this vast middle class.....Stankey and buddies have no idea of what being middle class means today......In the end, T will be worth less, will offer a lower dividend and may even suffer more competition from other telecom services as well as losing the larger battle of streaming television.....The reason Direct TV failed as has other streaming companies outside of netflix is COST.....The lower half of this country cannot afford the costs of TV, internet and phone....they all live on credit card debt........doesn't anyone at the top of T truly understand the immense safety net T provided, whether real or not, even when the analysts kept saying T had massive debt and couldn't maintain their dividend.......Its a sad commentary because there are other companies offering decent dividends and which have made their dividends look good for the middle class soon to leave T......Don't believe all the so called great financial gains being released in the various financial journals.....they all have personal gains in making T and its evolution seem to good to be true....IT MAY TURN OUT TO BE but the middle class loss of psychological security is something T just never understood.....It never should have left the telecom world to enter a world it obviously had no idea of how to run......the same leaders are now backtracking and trying to convince everyone how good things can become.......its sad when you think of the immense missteps T has taken......My own 7000 personal shares are a drop in the bucket but i liked the feeling that it was a safe income to be added to my other stock dividends.....i allow one third of my investments to be in companies which have a chance to move up but two thirds are in fixed higher dividend stocks.....My sons all have other ideas of investing but we still believe in a strong middle class security that T provided....its now gone and most likely, others feel like us and will decide when to unload their stock......i certainly am not surprised but after having the HEAD OF THE COMPANY ONLY ONE MONTH AGO LIE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS THAT THE DIVIDEND WAS SAFE, KNOWING ALL ALONG THAT ALL THESE BACK DEALS ARE TAKING PLACE, should remind everyone that T is most likely in a frantic state, looking to find a way out of their total mess.....i even told my niece to put some of her IRA cash into T.....My mistake !"
well for all the education/experience/ deal making ability that comes with size etc.. I lost money to day in what is my largest holding. That is serious to me.
Is T now a deferred annuity?
Stephenson & Stanky = Stink and Stank!
"So T sh will get 71% of the new company, how will that occur? T decrease its share value and transfer it to new company and then T shareholder gets shares of new company?"
Short interest has got to moving toward eventual short squeeze levels. Remember GameStop?
A lot can happen between now and merger for T to be able to unlock shareholder value
If you are long no worries. T will be better long.
"People seem to believe that instant alchemy happens with a spinoff and with a dividend cut. Cash flows do not change when these things happen. The cashflows will be split into two separate streams but will be the same at that point in time.The changes are what will happen AFTER the spinoff:Warner/Discovery can leverage its global footprint (T would have had to build out its own footprint, but Discovery already has it), taking the content global much faster.W/D can be valued as a growing media business.W/D gets bigger with the addition of Discovery and becomes a better player in a narrowing oligopoly with Netflix Disney Amazon.T can focus on 5G buildout.Another difference thereafter is the plan to keep more cash in the business (probably all for W/D - i.e., no dividend - and a reduced dividend for T as they buildout 5G) rather than pay it out as dividends. For investors focused on the dividend cashflow, they may want out. Or they can sell their W/D and buy more T to increase their dividends.Keep in mind that the business will likely continue to improve over the next year, with momentum in the telecom business, an expanding HBO Max, and growing profits. None of this has to do with the spinoff. Also, until the spinoff happens, there's still the $0.52/quarter dividend."
"Desperate shorts coming out of the woodwork? Investors Place comes out this weekend ""AT and T is ailing and investors should unload T stock"". Wow, a good reason not to sell T and load up on more shares before we hit 40 and above. IMHO T is now firing on all cylinders."
"This is a gong show, get out. There's no money left here. Netflix has content problems, and they all will. It's a race to the bottom."
"Tvalue Line rates T a sell as Amazon is gonna buy MGM, further making the streaming wars a brutal battle field. They also cited the 50 % dividend butchering."
"big shares are traded today and it does not look promising for the sustainable dividend, look for a cut of .20 a share reduction"
"I’m not seeing where they say spin-off, articles I see say merger"
that pop didn't last long
Cr%ppy management makes promises :) Would we lie?
Wonder if it will lose another dividend today? Look at that beautiful shareholder value.
"T way to big to fail. institutions park tens of billions in T for a good reason. They know their money is very safe and the 7% return is a great consistent return. Anyone notice T never fell below $26 even in the worst of the pandemic when other companies were down 60-80% just keep collecting my cash every 3 months and laugh all the way to the bank. Would buy another 30,000 shares if T visits $27 again"
Bought in for first time. It looks like a year of good dividends ending with a well planned future as a pure play.
"As I predicted correctly, blowout quarter with more to come. Criminally undervalued by funds manipulating the stock price. Stock should be trading at $40 today based on any metric."
Jim Cramer was epic today for exposing these two CEOs of AT&T. He was right all the way and I agree with his assessment. They deserve to be on wall of shame of Jim Cramer because of their actions and what they had done. Bravo  Jim Cramer for exposing these two CEOs.
The only positive to this deal is IF Discovery can run the new company better than ATT. Al the rest is just financial juggling. No one is “ paying” for anything. The debt will remain as is.
UPGRADES….TWO….TARGET PRICE $35.00. UBS & NEWSTREET
"Buying another 75 shares to add to what we have, not sure where it's going but I think back up some from where it's at now."
It was hard for me to do the math on the new dividend. I have it cut more than half. What did everyone else compute?
The details of exactly how this deal will work have still not been finalized. Lot of ignorant comments and rampant speculation being posted today.
Up yours Craig Moffet!
CNBC Had The CEO on A Month Ago ASSURING ALL THEDIVIDEND WAS SAFE ! They Re Played The TAPE TODAY !THOUSANDS Of LAWSUITS COMING OVER THIS !
"If this pans out well for T, and investors, the net income increase will help make up for the payout ratio decrease."
"Come on, T, time to play catch up."
Way oversold on technical basis. Near 15% selloff from Monday highs. Expect a big bounce soon.
What is T-PC
T is going to the moon
"Let?s be honest now. I do t care what the price of T is anymore. When max and disc combine, hedges will #$%$ up shares quick. If the split is $5, it will be $20 in a week. I?d say it is worth at least $50 because these are 2 services with great potential. So ya, I will keep buying a few shares here and there at this level because I know I?m really buying for the streaming service."
I see various commenters on other sites that plan on getting .71 shares of the new company for every share of T that they own. I think this is wrong and they will be greatly disappointed.
Where is ANDY and his 100k shares? Bah!
Any one who buys Stanky’s take on CNN is living in a dense fog. Emmys these days are doled out by like minded people who live in compete contradiction of logic. The belief that there’s no such thing as a absolute true!
I haven’t seen a move in the stock price of this since the of summer 69
this stock drops down fast but takes years to recover
"In T, we trust !!!"
President Biden just praised AT&T for keeping America at the forefront...I have it on my phone. That's appreciated for us Shareholders.
Imagine how many shares are being held by retirees who will now be selling. Between now and the actual spinoff T will hit $20.0 .
AT&T will ll most likely increase the Dividend to maintain their Aristocrat status......Morris and Associates declared to Clients.
Discovery Inc has the largest unscripted contents among all media services.
"I think the idea of owning 71% of the new mega media company which is supposed to have aninitial market value of about a $145 billion is starting to sound pretty good. T shareholders get to keep 100% of the 5G, cell phone, internet, wifi business and shares of this new media giant too."
"69,000 open $32 strike Calls are going to be executed today if the stock closes above $32 which it looks like it's going to do. That's 6.9 million shares that are going to change hands at $32 after the close today."
"VZ PE of 13.. which is not that expensive.But T is cheaper, much cheaper."
Should see $33+ this week. pandemic basically over - great news for time warner content & new 5G phone upgrades.
Wake up sleepy Joe
SEE YOU AT $60. Best stock ever! Paid to wait for it to go to $60!
The dividend was a farce anyways because the stock would just go down. So who cares about the dividend cut. Att needs to focus on 5g.
I don't understand the negativity at all.
"I was trying to add more shares on a dip, but it is not dipping..."
"Just when things appear a little bit better for T recently, then it happens.I had made enough errors when I made hasty decisions. This time, I would like to know more about the transaction before I made a decision.On the surface, it is probably not that bad. But I may have to sell still. I need to look for another good dividend stock. I do not want partnership stocks because I do not want to deal with K1 forms. Any good recommendations.Thanks"
"ATT seemed to have accepted the election results today. So, let's go back to $40+. ATT lags VZ by $10 until 4 years ago."
They cut the dividend.
Last months chart is very good :-)
"I'm crossing my fingers T gets added to the Animo Portfolio. Seems to have a way of finding undervalued stocks.I bought some OMI, because the last pick went up 30% in the last 4 weeks.https://youtu.be/5UgYe5BDbV4"
T shareholders will own 79% of discovery also
On my radar now! wait for the dust to settle after div. cut then it's profit city?! IMO they really need to beef up customer service in the phone sector IF that's all that is left with this company.
More divestitures and payoff debt as promised. Warner media cashflow will change significantly this year and Kong/Godzilla is the beginning of that.
Watched the interview yesterday and thought the Discovery CEO did a poor job of communicating. Meanwhile Faber was determined to ask all questions in a way that spun the deal as negative.
i do not understand peoples obsession with dividends. if you want cash flow off of a stock you can make far more money writing options than you can off of the dividend.
Hey shareholders..do you still like the randal stephenson media VISION?
"Between T and VZ shuffling the cards, we now understand the Massive investment 5g will take."
"The more negative the posts, the better for those who realize that this deal will reward long-term holders. They will collect 6.4% the next year in dividends and 4.3% the year after (increasing yearly) and shares in an amazing media company news media company with a grand future.The combined value will be more than $40 and the potential to rise to $60 within 3 years. Yep, panicking is definitely in order. Do I hear $24."
Thank god they sold just before it started to run back up.This shows what a great decision that was.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-nelson-capital-sold-t-172207215.html
Is this move from DRIP purchases?
"Impossible to invest in right now. Could be worth 59, could be worth 12. I like MO."
"Good bet down at these prices. for those who need to park some money for 7% ... I think they will raise dividend before year is out, so as to not lose Aristocrat Payer.. sp ... ATT s problem for a long time has been its management, and now the most recent groomed lifetime accountant cheer leader turned CEO Randall Stephenson is gone (with millions$$). John Stankey is taking over, hopefully he will learn from massive acquisition mistakes Randall the account made. ATT's problem is mis-management of resources, so it can turn things around, they are in a good space, with all that is happening (5G, IoT, AI, self employment, working from home). The massive debt can be managed, money is cheap, ....T is paying me $1000 month ... I will hold it for now ... counting on John the Giant to be smarter that Randall."
"""How do you like those apples?"" Anyone who sold T was unfortunately prey to the Wall St giants. They played you like a fiddle. The first opportunity to bash and manipulate your mind that you needed to sell or you were going to lose big bucks. Well now that they are satisfied it was down as much as they could push it, they then began to buy back. Nice day today and it will keep going now. You will see much more positive and optimistic adds on Yahoo and the likes. Drive it down, then buy and post positive adds. The got in cheap."
"It's a good thing! No, it's a bad thing! A good thing! A bad thing! Good! Bad! Good! Bad! Sounds like the stock market to me."
Wow 150 people viewing this board right now!?! Stanks worse than not a cnbc interview
What is T down a little bit today?A little profit taking?
Ain’t selling now with that aftermarket price. It’s my biggest holding. Hope spin-off is successful alone with T then I will have 2 companies. Gonna ride it out.
Looks like some brokerage houses are warming up to T stock. Getting some better responses.
"I think the overall takeaway for many people on today’s news about T is an unappealing negative. After spending great sums to chase and buy these assets only to now turn around and get rid of them - and, hopefully, the large debt that came with them - is behavior that makes many investors doubtful of the stability of this company. I believe T was removed from the DOW a couple years back and it now appear for good reason."
as of what date must you be a shareholder to receive shares from the spin-off?
Not happy about us breaking below 32.This market sell off started our climb and now it is bringing us back down.The last time I looked Gold was even down.A step to the side might be required after watching once again the late afternoon dumping in other securities
"""....AT&T is spinning off its media assets, the structure of the deal with Discovery allows current T shareholders the potential to profit from the growth of streaming media and content in general.Under terms of the deal, AT&T shareholders will hold a 71% stake in the combined media company, in the form of new shares. Discovery shareholders will own the remaining 29% stake. In return, AT&T will receive $43 billion of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt. The new media company will carry about $55 billion in debt.Whether the new media company pays dividends remains to be seen, but it certainly will have higher growth prospects than AT&T. But the eventual spinoff and new shares will force current holders of both T and DISCA to re-evaluate their holdings.Bank of America Global Securities analysts, who rate T at Buy, are optimistic about what this deal could mean for shareholders.""Given a choice between acquiring new media assets and spinning out a pure play, we believe shareholders are benefited by the latter,"" writes BofA analyst David Barden in a note to clients. ""A combined entity would have an enhanced ability to offer the widest variety of content to attract the largest possible subscriber base on a global basis."""
"The entire suite of T executives have made more money in five years than most Americans will make intwo lifetimes and while the Dow rose 81% in five years, T dropped 33%. Why do so many people make so much money for destroying value or screwing up the country for millions?"
HBO MAX is easily worth $80 dollars a share (conservatively) by itsef. T is a winner. The market still doesn'tunderstand the Company.
"ATT's volume was low this week. The May 21 calls for 32, 32.50, and 33 have open interest about 124000 let see if large buyers buy those calls and the stock closes over 33 next Friday."
Did you listen to my dividend cut prediction...NOW yes wait for about 5 years to recover your capital.Watch the grass grow.Hey does anyone want to discard Randall Stevenson's portrait from the Board room.
Yes Sir Cramer of all people said He really likes AT&T ..Buy Buy Buy!!!! But of course AT&T is cutting edge now and definitely doing great things. Absolutely AT&T is on fire!
"Well, today was a pretty lousy performance."
Hitting 32 today boys?
I sold and took a BEATING!!
I am in the core network business. No one cares. It’s BAU I am hoping for major pullbacks to re start accumulating and
CEO Really.REAMMMMMMMMMMEDThe Bagholders !
Woohoo! T finally dumping CNN etc. Oh No! T dumping CNN etc on us shareholders!And cut the Divvy in half!I wonder why its going down?
"This will be an amazing buy at some price, but none of us know what that will be. I'm thinking 26's. I don't know."
Maybe in the 50s or 60s distributing most of the cash a company makes was the way of doing business. Not much competition back then. Nowadays is an eat or be eaten world. If you can’t grow your business you won’t be able to compete. But how can you grow if you have to distibute all the cash you make? How do you think T-Mobile overtook AT&T? T-Mobile reinvests all the cash it makes to grow its business. They don’t pay a dividend!
"T was at 29.60 on April 13, one month ago. Only 4 weeks back. When all this selling is over, when the anger dissipates, Mr. Market will push this back up to low 30s."
"Per Jason Kilar 12:35pm EDT paraphrased = Turner Networks are here to stay. A new Theatrical presentation of the Turner Network they are working on now. ""We are happy with CNN."" In other words he's saying ""CNN is here to stay, all the haters can do now is Pray."" ha. haaaaaaaaa"
The price of the stock will continue sinking until Stankey is out. Zero trust on him.
How much is the Dividend cut?
The AP article says the deal is expected to close by middle of next year. Is that really correct? Will take at least one year to close this? Seems excessive.
"In the fight between dividend vs new stock, I am thinking as follows. Buy/Hold T stock. When the new stock is issued(hopefully at a good price), at that time T will take beating. - At that time, you can sell the new media stock and add more on to T position- Prepare in Advance, Sell T right after new stock is issued and buy more at lower priceIf it starts going lower now itself, add more stock so you can get more media stock. I am thinking media stock will be compared with NFLX, DIS. All scenarios suggest bullishness for T."
747 shares sold at $31.65 profit is profit  also to have all nearly all eggs in one busket was not safe now i invest in pie witch got T in it for long term . 
I am out of T. Dividend cut is being hidden and when mom and pop figure it out. The share price is toast. DISCA is trading at a pretty high PE in a very competitive market. You can have mine.
"I don't really care about T but I do feel bad for the long time holders who bought T for the dividend and are either retired or close to retirement. This is what happens, IMO, when you have a bad management team that doesn't care about the shareholders."
The time to sell is when Creamer jumps up and down and says to buy because combined company is worth $200 billion or $33/sh.
CEO is doing a great job with ATT. Finally we are seeing some progress. Keep up the good work!
The market sees no dividend coming from the spinoff stock so the dividend cut is a big negative for those holding the stock for its previous big dividend.
"Very poorly prepared announcement for such a big deal, folks don’t even know what if any shares their going to get from the new company, as think I understand it T shareholders will be getting new shares of the new company but at what ratio. I own 14000 share but have no idea what I am going to get out of this except for loosing 14,000$ today on their blockbuster Announcement….Real amateur presentation!!!"
I suggest everyone go to Wikipedia and look at the history of AT&T. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26TIt has been a rolling disaster since the 1990s. Too man bad deals and missed opportunities to compile here. It is not hard to believe the current deal is just another bump in the road for this storied company.
Shareholders will receive 7.56$ per share of NewCo. The stock will go to 23.81$ that would give a dividend of 4.86%.
33 next week
"Just an FYI - forget the fancy equations and other items. John Stankey states that Warner is 25.2% of the equity of T. That is the market cap contribution from T. That also sets the number of shares a T holder gets from the deal at around 1:4 because Discovery has market cap of 34% of Warner. Amazing how these numbers are so perfect because .71 of 34% is 24.1%. So it appears to be close to 1:4 no matter how you slice it. I'm sure the market caps will vary a little as the merger gets closer, but it would take a huge run-up in T stock to materially alter that 1:4 ratio."
"This Friday AT & T should close above 29.00 USD and far below 30.00 USD according to the option chain.Looking forward into the future, 18 JUNE 2021 suggest that AT&T will trade ABOVE 30.00 USD.FOR SWING TRADERS - A BUY."
"PS Telephone’s prior full, but now partial ownership of the Commie/Socialist CNN propaganda machine connecting to the Dubious Dummycrats will not save their widows and orphans nor shareholders this time around! Stick a fork in them as their unfunded pension liabilities and “union” employee base continues to be the albatross driving them deeper into the abyss!"
Verizon or AT&T? Which is a better stock to own?
"If the new company is likely to be valued at $50B with debt, then there will be a write down of $30B since Stephenson paid $80B for Time Warner? I feel like these CEO's just love to do M&A and Spinoffs to make themselves look important and M&A bankers rich."

"Att has already sold More than 3-5 billion worth of Warner’s assets. Warner has brought in around 7 billion in profit since 2017, plus Hbo has helped Ts wireless churn to record levels. Getting 43 billion now plus 71% of this new company. Att bought Warner for around 110 billion including debt. In my opinion it looks like T is breaking even on this. This is not the catastrophe that Direct Tv was."
"My guess is the new Company wouldn't be profitable for a looong time, and that's the bottom line. Do y'all agree?"
Our Discovery share will have a Value of $10The rest of T is only $19Gl!
"So I did a google search on Cramer's coverage of AT&T. October 22, 2020 he said buy AT&T. Jan 4, 2021 he said AT&T has too much risk and sell it. April 27, 2021 he said with inflation concerns you should buy dividend stocks like AT&T which posted its first great quarter.I guess you can decide but its typical Jim Cramer. He watches what is happening in the market and then goes on his show and touts it as how he has always been on which ever side the current stock is moving. He tends to build his own reality."
Stank butchered the dividend by 50% without having the backbone to address it.

"I guarantee there will be class action lawsuits similar to a small one against Toyota, not the big one. The small suit simply addressed shareholders that bought the stock during the time TM knew about the defects, but then later sold the shares at a loss. I was part of that and got a decent amount back. This will be the same thing. T clearly stated it was maintaining the dividend, yet now, it is clearly announcing it will cut the dividend. Any T share holders that bought and then sold at a loss during this time will have the same type of case as the smaller Toyota Class Action shareholder loss suit"
remember that T was combination of almost 400B market companies...
"Jim Cramer, Just bashing AT&T does not cause us to buy your DIS, TMUS, or whatever stocks you want to pump.Sure. DTV was not quite a success. Not every acquisition will turn into to a success for any company.However, HBO was quite a success. If not for AT&T changing it to a streaming format, it would have been even worse during this locked down period. The main reason for separating it was You Jim Cramer and bashers talking about to much debt.Consolidation of Media business with Discovery actually create more contents and cost saving.Whatever you want to twist is ok..You should be on Hall of Shame for Bear Stern incident. We all still remember.Your bias and pumping frothy stocks or your own favorite stocks should also be on Hall of Shame again..Moses, 2021."
Bet more than a few at CNN are worried lol.
"even with div cut sometime in 2022 yield will still be ~4%, better then the big banks. put that in your Twitter pipe and smoke it"

this is frustrating imagine if you own a lot of shares in ATT and the board of directors are getting paid more than 3 to 9 million dollars per year. this is absolutely BS. this ATT must go down to 20 dollar per share
As Discovery stock valuation? It was growing and suddenly stops and that is why stock drops so much..A stock Pe can be 12 or 30.. Funny.. I am not sure TMUS' with PE of 50?
"Even with the dividend cut, the yield is now about the same as VZ's, and T now has a potential for growth with the new streaming company. Dunno about you guys, but I prefer HBOmax over Disney+ and Netflix and I have all 3 services. Disney don't have much adult contents and Netflix is now full of foreign low budget shows. I'm increasing my stake by 33% as T drift lower."

Doing opposite of what Cramer suggests has been profitable almost all of the time.They will turn positive on T once they have all the cheap shares they want.Just wait and see how the crooked machine operates

They should have just purchased Nokia instead.
"Forget about the 50% dividend cut. That is not the main issue at this point. The main issue is that T does not has any credibility as long as John Stankey is still around. Who is going to trust this transaction is beneficial for investors if this is the same executive that support and promoted all prior failed transactions. When there is no trust in the management and Board of a company sound investors simply walk away, and that is what is happening now."

"T earns about $3 per share. Currently, ALL the earnings get that multiple, whether they come from hbo, warner, wireless or broadband. Net, net, it's all getting 10x. Now, for a minute let's forget Disca just for illustrative purposes. Let's say T spins off Warner and that company gets 20x earnings for its shares....not at all unreasonable. And let's say $1 out of the $3 total earnings come from Warner. Now, T holders are getting $20 for a Warner share ($1 x 20 multiple) and $20 for a T share ($2 x 10 multiple). Together, that's $40. They hoped investors would do that ""rerating"" on their own and give credit for Warner as T tried to build it out....but seemingly, it wasn't going to happen. So instead, T mgmnt elected to do this spinoff, which in their mind, would cause the share price to react the way I just illustrated. They figured the lower dividend would be more than offset by effectively a $40 share price (just using 40 in my example). Evidently, it was just a miscalculation.....for now. I don't think they were being evil, or really dumb. I just think they felt obligated to do something for shareholders and it backfired. I'm mad too. It's possible they underestimated the importance of the div amongst this current shareholder base. And the delivery and messaging around the deal didn't help. They did leave everyone puzzled as to WHY the div needed to be cut so much. It's the same pie of earnings that exist postmerger and not explaining why 60'ish% of those earnings couldn't continued to be paid out as a div was a mistep. Just trying to give some perspective."

"Stankey is playing the Pontius Pilate routine. He's saying, look, you don't like Warner Media as part of the T organization, then, we'll split it off and you decide whether you want to own it or not. We wash our hands of the whole thing. As part of the process, though, we're going to reduce the dividend by half (this is the cute part because it gives T a method for saving much needed cash for future operations. And, let's be honest, T bungled The Time Warner purchase right from the get-go). As an investor, I shouldn't be preoccupied with the sins of the past, but whether T has come up with a plan to make investors whole again. I've given up 50% of my dividend. Will owning a media company make up for the difference? A year will be a very long time to think about this."

You poor bag holders...be sure and send Cramer a Christmas card
My math says each share of T will represent .23 share of DISCA worth about $8 So Stub T worth about $24 with a 5% dividend yield. Expect T to be bought and DISCA to be shorted as we get closer to a deal date if a spin of the T DISCA shares is confirmed.

Well back to $32 we go
After the dividend cut T's dividend will still be nice and high as the stock price will be considerably lower I fear. I'm tired of all their excuses for poor stock performance so I sold it all yesterday. They keep talking about creating long term shareholder value...I haven't seen any the whole time I owned T in the last 15 years! Might buy some back in the $22-$24 range. Good luck all!
I am down to 392 shares of T . I will keep them but glad that’s all I have left . Not buying VZ or T anymore is a blessing. T-Mobile & Dish are serious threats to telecom. Extremely happy with picking up CVS in March @ 68 trading at 88 and change today
"Looks like I made the right decision with sticking with T, wanting to bail a few tsms in the last 4 yrs."
They are going to cut the dividend. At last!
And you thought T would hold at $31 range or even go up to $32-$35. lol lol lol Maybe it will hold at $30 range ? I sold 40% of myT recently at $31.52. Waiting to buy back at lower prices and pocket the profit.
T needs to buy back its shares. Need a catalyst to move the stock.
"I love today's action! My $12K in 2020 dividends have been sitting in cash as I usually use it to buy other stocks, but now I'm going to use it to buy more T at this discount! I love it when news scares away gamblers and gives us investors opportunities to buy at a discount!!"

The Turner stuff, yes. Movies, series, etc., no. I still hope that's what they do....spin the Turner stuff off and keep hbo."
I bailed before losing on this investment. Thought I had a long term winner with the high dividend yield but it looks like the strategy is changing from what I thought I heard on the earnings call.
Musk or Cook would never let Cramer say & do what he did today without responding quickly to defend the share price. Stankey is both gutless & tone deaf.
"New T with reduced (but safer) dividend in the $1.25 range should trade with a lower yield than before and give you $20-25/share. Add the 70% of the media asset -- $50B in revenue and $14 of EBITDA -- growing faster than the mature wireless business should get another $10 per current T star and potentially more. Current sum-of-the-parts should be minimally $30-35 and maybe as high as $45. The stock, however, will have to endure a *(%!-ton of turnover as many of the the Cramer-acolyte types see ANY dividend cut as a reason to move money elsewhere."

"I don't understand this: AT&T would receive $43 billion in cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt under the all- stock deal, the companies said Monday. AT&T shareholders would get stock representing 71% of the new entity, while Discovery shareholders would own the rest, the companies added.In a spinoff, the parent doesn't generally receive cash.....it's just newly created stock that is given to T shareholders. If anything, the parent provides working capital for the co that's being spun off (and it can put some debt on it too). Am I just misreading this?? Do they mean newco receives cash of xxxx??"

"John Malone supports the deal:John Malone said: “After over 30 years of being involved in developing Discovery as a global information and entertainment company, the opportunity to combine with WarnerMedia to create the ultimate consumer offering in its space is compelling. The industrial logic of this investment grade, synergistic combination, under the leadership of David Zaslav, is appealing. I am delighted to fully support this transaction, without asking for or receiving a premium for my high vote shares. I believe we are creating real value for shareholders and a legacy investment for my grandkids.”"

"Homegamers.....Great 7% Plus Divvy For the Next Year.....Most Likely Good Stock Appreciation, As Well.... T is ON SALE....BUY IT HERE !I'm In With A Fairly Big Position. Long 28,600 Shares @ 28.72.THRILLED To Get Back Into T At These Levels......."
Bill Mahr got covid after being vaccinated. What good are the vaccinations anyway. The Decrease in death rate and infections could be because its nearing summer.
T is struggling to find a way to compete. Not sure this deal will do it but probably better than nothing. Holding my long positions in T but will wait to see what happens. The dividend is the only reason I am holding T. They are not really a good wireless company and HBO Max is also not so great. Not enough content and too high a price.
"Ummmm , you are getting 71% of the new company not just ""losing dividends"""
29% of The new company Discovery is around 17-18 bln $71 % is 44 bln $ which is around 6$ k mln minimum.They think discovery is under valued by 30% so there is a huge upside potential here.Rest of AT & T is valued @25+ $So in all you have $31 stock with vertically focused companiesGl!
I said to buy bear sterns.....2 weeks before collapse... famous Cramer quote 2008 before it went to zero..........Afterwards he said that his channel was for fun and entertainment and not to buy or sell based on his program
"It’s a shame stock trades well all day and always gives back most of it at the end of the day one day at waltz but who knows how long we have to wait for that , but I will collect my dividends￼"
What do I get out of this as a T share holder?
"To all the shorts, hahahahaha"
"OK, T will maintain its 7% divvy only the stock price (after the spinoff of DISCA) will go down to $20.T = T (Stodgy high divvy) + DISCA (high growth, high P/E)"
AT&T and discovery in talks to combine media assets. Sources would not be disclosed as this is not for public information. I have owned AT&T and discovery forever
"Wow, T knocked it out of the park on earnings..."
We've seen these scare tactics/shakedowns before over the past few weeks. People dumping Pfizer and other drug stocks on news of potential patent waivers. Shareholders (scare holders) selling their tobacco stocks on rumour of menthol taxes. Within a few days the same stocks come back and people ended up selling their investments when they should have held. I wonder if the media will play this theme again helping the shorts who eventually want your shares. That's seems to be the way it was in the above two instances.
"What Cramer says isn’t important.The only thing that matters is the guidance given in the upcoming conference call. If T can provide guidance for higher sales and eat, the stock will go up"
Looking like DISCA got the goldmine and T got the shaft. big dividend cut.
The 8 k is talking about the new company with a dividend payment of 40 to 43 % of 20 billion of cash flow
What a wonderful world it would be
I am looking for T to have pretty good earnings with their new Monster unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX. T has been taking customer away from both VZ and T Mobile and it should show up in the numbers this Q. So get your shares if you want before the ex dividend or after all up to you. T will be going higher and higher
"it has gap of 30 dollars, hopefully that fill next week or so.. and hope it holds, then we can go up.. stop looking back."
Keep buying more
"This Discovery news caught me way off guard. I'm not sure what to make of it just yet. I suppose, like someone on here said, depends on the terms of the deal. I guess the good news is DISCA's market cap is only $16 bill, so even if T bought the entire thing for cash at a 33% markup, that's only about $21 bill. I doubt that's what they'll do, but not awful. A stock deal would be much better. Of course it would be dilutive but it wouldn't harm the balance sheet and it sure sounds like a winner of a combination. Other good news is that it should light a fire under my VIAC calls!"
Tens of millions of shares bought near $34 this morning. This will be going nowhere but straight down for quite a while. Yikes.
T trying to merge it's way out of the mess Randall left behind. What a circus.
Off a dollar from its high today. Just great. Pfft.
"With two presses of the button, you could sell T and buy MO and keep the dividend train rolling. MO has raised for more than 50 years in a row, making it a KING, one level higher than an Aristocrat."
I told you not to sell. Don’t listen to short sellers on this board.￼
"Fingers crossed, rally into the close!"
"Nice breakout on heavy volume. T deserves a ""content premium"". Shoulkd test $32-$33 very soon."
What does T have to thwart telco bypass by Starlink?
We need more paid pumpers here otherwise they won’t be able to dump their shares in the coming days.Watch the volume folks it always tells the tale
AT&T pulling dividens
Any news about a dividend cut or just normal nay sayer chatter?
We are now free from financial obligation to pay huge divvy. It is nice.
"wow Cramer...why doesn't he apologize to all the grandmothers he sent off to buy XL, GOEV, PLUG, TPGY, etc. on the way up or to catch a falling knife before they dropped up to 80%...then once they were stuck holding the bags he smears them on the way down."
Added 25% more shares today.
Just sold all my T shares.
"I used this sell off to buy back all my covered calls. If the price recovers back to $30-31 area, I am looking to sell premium again and shorten the time period to just a month or so at a time. I agree with Cheetah's prior comments, this spin-off and dividend reduction will eliminate the boring but comforting price stability. I expect larger price swings and an upward bias in the price, at least after the deal. The big wild card is inflation, IMHO. The large debt in both companies in a rising interest rate environment could be a big problem. So those comparing GE with T might be onto something. I still think T has a good revenue stream in their cellular business and does not have the credit market exposure like GE and GM and some others did in the 2008 financial collapse."
Worst stock I’ve ever bought. I’ve had it for 4 years and it’s done nothing but go down. I’ve collected the dividends and thank goodness I didn’t reinvest them. I will sell soon but not today. People are panicking cause they are cutting the dividend whic is the only reason most people bought this horrible stock.
Malone made Stankey an offer he couldn’t refuse. If Stankey hadn’t taken the offer he wouldn’t have been doing his fiduciary responsibility.
I'm no basher. But I had to sell T for the moment. I'm going long on AMC in hopes of THE SQUEEZE. See ya'll soon. GO T.
3% divvies for the new company still not too shabby. Just saying.
So one article stated 20% cut? Did I read that correcrly? All pretty presumptuous at this point I suppose.New dividend possible of $1.55 to $1.65 from $2.08?
Dividend cut news I've been waiting for. I sold last year waiting for it. I'll rebuy when the correction takes place.
"Good news for Warner Bros.Warner Bros. and Legendary’s “Godzilla vs. Kong” tallied a pandemic-best opening over the weekend, securing $32.2 million over Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The film, which was released domestically on Wednesday, has how garnered $48.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.Internationally, “Godzilla vs. Kong” added an additional $71.6 million to its box office haul. Since opening last week in foreign markets, the film has tallied $285.4 million."
just took off ..
"Why is their long term debt increasing every qtr, its now sitting at 161b from 147b from a year ago.Honestly you would have thought by now they would be pushing to get that debt down but nope its just adding up..."
Fancy way to admit that the Time Warner acquisition was another disaster.
Wow pre market is ugly. Even with all the Market Markers absorbing millions of shares this is still sinking.Does anyone have an idea what our new share valuation is probably going to end up being?
Might be going down faster now than a one legged Cheetah trying to jump a border wall.
"People scream about long term hold, ""don't be a short."" In the end of the day, shorts do not end up like this. Meanwhile, the CEO said ""We need to get the stock price up, so we don't have to pay a 6% dividend"" on Squawk Box. Notice he did this after we voted to approve executive compensation?"
T loses 22b in market cap in two sessions! Good job BODs!That’s their way of creating shareholder value.They s/b voted out!
"I seems a lot of folks are not thinking this through, but are ""emotional selling""."
Good old 32!
Cramer said David Zaslav got huge stock options the day before the deal with Discovery was announced. Just another case of a wealthy CEO taking care of another wealthy CEO at the expense of the stockholders.
"71% in new company so you get 71 shares for each 100 shares, plus you keep your T shares and divy will be around 4 to 5% after merger."
Cramer is a complete manipulator for personal gain. Once again the media is destroying the country.
AT&T has caved into WOKiSM and the CANCEL CULTURE.
By the reaction of the stock it seems most people wanted the stock for the dividends. ￼￼
190 billion debt don't get all crazy on the price increase.
"Yes, the dividend matters to those who were counting on it to continue to fund the cost of living. That mostly includes retirees. I understand the deal and I think they will benefit in long term but they have been touting the safety of the dividend for quite a while. I am sure insiders got out before the announcement. I think they should roll back the dividend cut and just take a little longer to deleverage rather than hurt long time loyal customers and investors."
Bought more T today.
if I had a thousand shares of AT&t what would I expect as far as new shares how many?
"Cramer endorses T! Oh dear, now Stankey will cancel the dividend for sure. ;)"
"I was in denial for a while, but every big move this company makes is a massive failure. I won't be fooled again."
"Cheetah I am going to mute you today because you're a spammer who throws shade on the stock while writing puts to generate income for yourself. Your whole thesis revolves around you wanting to feel good about selling puts, without the actual owners of the company enjoying a positive mark to market. You're the worst kind of participant - just a synthetic derivative. It would be one thing if you were writing the puts to achieve a disciplined entry point. But you have no desire to own the company and no real stake in anything. You feel good by making others feel less than. We all get paid too though. We receive dividends and our ownership is intact. Anyway, if that weren't bad enough, you're also present with a political agenda which also comes across as inauthentic. And you smear the news media, specifically CNN. It's 2021. Don't you think the world knows that news media is biased and targeted? News is entertainment and editorial. It's a sad state, but, as Leonard Cohen says, Everybody Knows. Anyway, today is the day when I push a button and you disappear. For all those reasons above. By the time to clock strikes midnight, you become a pumpkin, pumpkin. Now go get your shine box."
I see some green pre market
"Well, today I'm glad I own some T. Hope this is a new trend."
"Now, Kilar wants to leave?? he is the 1 true media superstar T had. WTH is going on? It feels like Stankey didnt even get buy in from his leadership team & is ramming it down our throats."
small recovery but headed right back down looking like 28.5 today!another GD #$%$ by management!THIS COMPANY IS BLESSED WITH ENDLESS MORONS
ATT nearing 1997 stock highs.
Who wants to own CNN?
the panic selling is over. time to relax. sell some puts.
"AT&T ($T) and Discovery expect the merger to create a global leader in streaming services while simultaneously cutting costs and increasing revenue. They estimate an annual cost savings of $3 billion. Additionally, the combined media company is projected to generate $52 billion in revenue in 2023 and deliver $14 billion in adjusted EBITDA. I am so glad i found trade-ideas. Helps traders find the best setups in the market right now"
Are these analysts serious! Price target $24 and $25. Even I don’t believe there is another 20% downside.
looking like T is going to be the steamroller for all of the competition. I am very happy with my investment 
"at the rate this market is going, people will buy T, so they can get over a 6% dividend and be ""lost at sea"".....in other words, people will be forced here, lol."
"From Barron's: , and the ""conglomerate discount"" on AT&T's stock should disappear.So.....looks like the conglomerate discount has been grown even bigger! Even when the conglomerate is a conglomerate no more! Amazing stuff, really."
If T were to pay a dividend of $1.20 at the current stock price the yield would be approximately 4%. VZ pays 4.5%. T’s price doesn’t seem to reflect the $150B business of which the T shareholders will own 71%. The hedge funds thank you.
Don't panic..
I knew we should have bought ExxonMobil but instead invested too much in AT&T which was a disaster by my analysts!
I like this more than I did a week ago. Adding.
"Monday will be very interesting with joining Discovery ,shares could raise big time, T doing things right, still like to see them get rid of CNN !"
Happy to make money on the dead cat bounce on both T and disca today. Luck was with me!
Dividend seekers sell fast and get out of T. Cramer says dividend cut in half!!!
How long should it take for my dividends to show up in my account?
T is no longer a $30 stock.Going golfing today. Good luck!
Why did it spike initially?
HBO / max and there a 5G play. Dividend won’t be affected. Got in at around 26. 
ANDY and Vagican curled up in the fetal position.
"Pre-market green. Realization that the deal is good. T will still be a high dividend play and WarnerDiscovery a high growth play. And, until that happens T remains solid dividend.The sell off was emotional."
finally showing some life
"What people don’t know Cramer smart, he gets people to panic sell and I guarantee this guy is loading up on att just like I am"
"Hope T by some miracle is up premarket tomorrow so I can dump all my shares. Att finds another charity case. Discovery will pop tomorrow, but T will test $26 again. Why do they keep doing this!"
I guess we got the stick and the big boys at T got the carrot I was just considering investing in the big T but at 27 is a good buy but at current rate is meh just sell thank the Lord I bounced
"I am waiting for Creamer to jump up and down and say that TWD (Time Warner Discovery) should be worth $200 billion. With 6 billion shares outstanding, that would be worth at least $30#$%$ IPO.Of course the FED will dump money and support the market for this valuation."
"Honest to God, the world's worst management team. Mistake after mistake after mistake.....and they all still get their massive pensions or salaries.....while the retirees of the world - counting on the T dividend to survive, get the shaft."
"I see $40 by end of year or sooner. If market breaks down, the smart money will be hiding in T"
So nice to see that T is over $31+ today (4.23.2021)
What terrible decision by leadership! A cut in dividend will plunge this stock to below 20 bucks
"DJIA EPS ttm have stagnated at roughly $160 since 2014, but the index has gone up 130%. The Fed is working its inflation magic as you cannot get any kind of return in a CD, savings account, or bond. While I think DJIA stocks are quality ones, the P/E multiples even on these blue chips are getting a bit overdone. Even with GS and JPM and UNH reporting HUGE numbers, I think this corrects...soon. Prior recessions have been telegraphed by IBM reporting poor results for a quarter or two...IBM reports April 19."
"Listening to Cramer and other TV ""stock ""gurus"" for investment decisions, is like listening to CNN for ""genuine news"". Good luck - you'll need it."
After hours will be dropping much more after retirees awaken from their afternoon nap and others digest all of this. What amount for departure packages might we be seeing for those who don’t end up with a position after being around for only a year or two ..or less?
"The restructuring at T is waking a sleeping giant. The culmination of Strong wireless, 5g, digital entertainment and streaming Gives T an unique advantage."
lets Go T
"T typically goes lower when the market goes higher, so there's that to worry about as well. lolMarket getting crushed today is actually a good thing for T share price."
$T Upgrades UBS Buy USD 32 » USD 35 Upgrades New Street Research Buy USD 35
Analysts by Barron’s calculated the value of T post divestiture to be around $25. And the value of Ts share in the new company anywhere between $5 and $15 depending upon whether the market gives it a enterprise value in line with Disney or Viacom.
Management should have indicated why this is a great deal for shareholders. Instead they seem to put in the context of a defeat of their former strategy. Then they indicate a 50% dividend cut. Are they short the stock? Imagine if they would have talked about the incredible potential value of the streaming company and told shareholders that the value of the new shares should be a boon to investors. Instead management created a climate of magical uncertainty that investors hate and that shorts can take advantage of.
"The company will pay the dividend until the deal closes, right?"
Two of my favorite stocks green today T and BA.
Looks like div reinvestment today moving stock up today.
T getting pumped right now on CNBC. Just starting to break out.
"$32, do I hear $32??"
"T's decade-long+ stagnant trend looks to be winding down, mark Friday's PPS close at $30.04, with earnings call scheduled on Thursday April 22nd to begin the upward trend towards $34. IMO."
Any guess out there about when we will see the dead cat bounce for T? And how high it will go?
"Discovery stock negative and they're the one being acquired!!...Gee, so much for buying low & selling high. Another overpay by T."
"They're pumping The stock price down! Look the dividend isn't getting cut until the spinoff of the new company is completed, so next year we get a dividend of 3.5% or so at this price and we get shares in a great new streaming company that's definitely worth a decent price. These whales know it's a great deal. This is why they are pumping The stock down, so they can buy it cheap and make even more money. AT&T isn't the #$%$ here, They are creating Value for shareholders and these people are trying to steal that value! Don't believe these #$%$'s!!!"
"Hi Everyone,I have about 8000 shares of T. Let’s say the merger goes through. ‘S div. goes down to say $1.04 yearly. How many shares of the new company should I expect to get? Even a range.Thanks, Roger K."
"Why is T is the most indebted nonbank company? Only three years in, T does a U-turn. Maybe they should go into the restaurant business, then a joint venture with a gold company and build a river on Mars. T has no direction, no strategy, no vision.."
"Why is everyone panicking about att? Sounds like people bought in too high. This a very long term hold. DRIP the dividend and buy on dips. Don’t look at it for 30 years. If you’re looking to get rich quick. This stock isn’t for you. It’s a old money stock and the cash flow is MASSIVE. We fine, stop worrying about the price and enjoy your retirement. Good luck today everyone."
It’s probably best to hold this. The arbitrageurs will take this from here and they are smarter than anyone on this board. You can’t trade this. Either sell it and forget about it or hold it.
If you want fairly safe yield buy XOM almost 6%.
"Four years ago, T was over $42."
"I added a few more shares before the ER came out. I'm glad I did. The way I see it, T is headed higher and the dividend is solid, what's not to like."
So AT&T now can have market cap appreciation instead of divvy payout..Isn't what T bears are talking about?f
Get paid while waiting for transformation..Granted that I reduce half of the investment.. (which may be doubled.)
Why do we need so many Board of Directors? Also what administrative staff was cut by the TW merger?
thanks Joe
Mr. Market is up to his usual tricks. Yes Mr. Market it will fail. No one will sell to you. We will buy!Your short is an epic FAIL!
"If T’s ER was this good a year ago Share price would be 39$, so why is it different now?"
Dividend paid at normal rate until deal closes????
Someone posted this morning saying that there would be a run up today followed by a constant sell off and decline in share price.They were spot on !Now we have to watch for the end of the Funds exiting and a true bottom.
T could end up in the RED today. What a stock lol.
Real question is what the market will value NewCo on after it starts trading.....any thoughts there?
T is the new Buffett type of investment of the future.
T and VZ both up today in a trashing of the NASDAQ.
I think by lowering the dividend T value goes up.
"So they couldn't make money with a streaming business during the pandemic. The solution, spin it off and cut the dividend in half. Nice."
Warren Buffett lost like 50 billion when he panicked and sold all his airline stocks during the pandemic last year. They have all recovered. There's a lesson there for you and airline stocks were much more risky at the time than AT&T is right now. One of the greatest investors of all time panicked. He admits he made a mistake.
"As Spartan suggested, the reuters article does definitively say that it's the entire warner portfolio, including hbo/hbomax. This is a big, big, big deal. Everyone is talking about how stankey was wrong and has no choice, etc etc., but I have a diff view. I really think that it's simply about valuation and the obligation to maximize shareholder value. Randy didn't care. But the bottom line is even if he thought the strategy would work, the market just wasn't giving T a market multiple that reflected a large player in streaming and content under its tent. And at some point, you just have to say, ok, fine."
The Board has made many blunders and should be held accountable. Yet shareholders continue to vote them back into the boardroom. IMO
I sold. I will keep an eye on it. If it drops to $18-$20 I might buy it back.
"This is overdone. Yes, divy cut, but you get 71% of newcorp. So take it down, but will get 4 more divy's before it is reduced to ~$1.12 which will give you a price around $28 so this is done too soon too fast. I am a buyer here."
Disney missed subscriber growth.... could be T is taken away new subscribers for HBO plus
"Seven Billion shares outstanding so the sell off might go on for a while,The P R machine should be revving up about now to attempt to cancel out all of the negative articles being written about this deal."
"What's next: AOL-CNN-Time-Warner? LOL, who here remembers that gem of a merger?"
Worst Management And Board A Company Could Have!
They called me a divy chaser. Who's smiling now !
Sell the news...told you so this morning if you listened
"I see this stock falling to about $15 to $20 per share. Here's the reason:T offers an attractive dividend but poor growth prospects, So Here is the logic:Current stock price is $30 with a $2.08 per share dividend....a 7.0 percent yieldNew Dividend/Yield$1.04/.07=$14.85 per sahre.Assuming a $5 benefit to shareholders who own Discovery gets me to $20.I see a 50% downside risk. The dividend will be cut in half to $1.04 or thereabouts."
"With a tax-free spin-off stock dividend of $9, a $2 dividend in the next 12 months and a stock that will be fairly valued at $22, I'm buying. At $22, ATT will be better than Verizon in dividend, debt, revenue, and profit. My guess is the details will start to trickle out over the next few weeks. I think the stock is stable here. But if it drops, I'm buying more because after the spin-off, I think T will rise back to $28 within 12 months. So I will have received the NewCo shares for almost nothing."
Just invest 50k let’s see this going to the moon
"If you want a telecom stock paying out close to what T does (or did), buy VOD. Nearly six percent on a major pullback last week. And no, it doesn't have any aspirations of going Hollywood and streaming services. Safe play at 18."
AT&T just got recommended long-term buy on final trades CNBC
"Some things I'm considering: (1) should I sell all or some of T stock and get back in at a later time when the price has gone down enough? (2) If the stock goes down far enough, do I buy additional shares at a lower price and make up some of the dividend lost at a higher yield? (3) How well positioned is the new media company? Is this going to be another bust? That streaming media business is very crowded and competition is fierce. (4) How good is this guy who's going to be running the new company? Will he run it into the ground? Is he capable of delivering growth that shareholders expect? (5) What other ""tricks"" does T have up it's sleeve to make this one big fiasco - more than it's already been? This thing hasn't been just a ""mistake"". It's been a very, very expensive mistake."
Should have some analyst upgrades on the horizon
"""Those who stay will be champions."" Bo Schembechler."
"Only $1.11 per Share Divi left and no growth, really ?Interesting again earliest at 20 USD, and even then there are better Stocks out there like XOM with nearly 6% Divi."
"It took the news from TMUS for reality to dampen the hysteria. ATT again has to respond to the facts by meeting the competition with incentives. Imagine if the virus didn't strike in 2020 and the borrowing rates didn't drop, the dividend most likely would have been cut. Stankey could have handed CNN off and used the billions from the sale to buy spectrum instead of the massive offering it went through?Does anyone remember when ATT was the telephone company? Is anyone that old? ."
I stand with Israel.
You all wanted T to get rid of CNN. Well they are now. Happy?
If my quarter end theory about the price drop yesterday was correct we should go up .20-.40 today. Time will tell.
"Buy it at $85B, sell it for $43B, for a loss of 50% in value in three short years..."
I’d like to buy AT&T at $18 a share
As soon as I got my HBO Max account I canceled Netflix ASAP. I'm sure many thousands of others did the same! Bottom line? Short Netflix and go long T!
28 or less after the grannies watch Cramer tonight.
This will be worth buying at around $18
ATT lost approximately 80 billion on Direct TV and Time Warner. Well done.
"I can humbly repost AT&T is probably the stupidest company everybody has heard of in America. It is incredible how poor their decision making and vision has been and I think remains to this day. How can a company with the amount of analysts they have on the payroll possibly think buying Direct TV was a good idea in 2015. The writing was already on the wall for even the novice investor. Then having no idea how to make money in the Media business they leverage themselves to the hilt and buy Warner Media for 85 Billion Dollars. Are you kidding ? How much money do they possibly have that they can just throw away. Now because they have no idea how to run a business they decide to waive the white flag and tell a mid market player to run their operations. They have forfeited to many billions to count. Because they are so stupid, actually giving the reigns to Discovery might be the right thing to do but it has cost them so much money it is crazy. 90% of the Companies in America would already be out of business if they made decisions like these bloated clowns. Actually I knew they were dead in the water the day they announced they were throwing in the towel on HBO Boxing. Who in their right mind who give up this franchise when you are trying to build for the future. Lastly, I use to work for AT&T which is another reason why I know they are so clueless. And no I was not let go, I am not disgruntled, I do not own their stock, I am just amazed. They have not earned the Brand they were given back in the 80's. Horrible job."
AT&T's dividends contributes nicely to my quarterly vacations.
"So, whats the negative news now possibly left to stop this from getting a major volume boost?"
AT&T CEO John Stankey Bought $1 Million of Shares in an open market purchase.Putting his money where his mouth is.
Here come the online spammers telling us what we already know before they spew their spam.
"BARRON'S guesstimates the share price going forward will be, at the least, $30 a share. If this holds true you can get a whopping 44c share appreciation (if you're lucky) for the foreseeable future...."
It was a good dividend stock until it wasn't.
Does Zaslav have to keep Cuomo on CNN until next year?What a waste of our money!
"will the div stay at 52 C for aug and nov this yr?? ...thanks to the ""Board "" !!!"
Jason Kilar could be the CEO of the new company. lol.
"Bernstein analyst Peter Supino estimates that in a sale CNN would be valued at $5.6 billion or more, which, combined with the $15 billion the company is seeking for DirecTV, could have a meaningful impact on its debt load. Hal Vogel, CEO of Vogel Capital Management, believes that “CNN has always been considered as a possible sale candidate, with or without Zucker.” And he, like some others, argues that potential new debt pressures could lead the company to a decision. “The motive for AT&T is always to reduce debt and preserve the dividend,” Vogel adds."
"sold my shares this morning @ $33.70 share. price has dropped so may consider buying back at much lower price and pocket the profit. would like to know the status of T dividend. will the spun off company pay a dividend to combine with T's dividend . if not, T might have to reduce their dividend but not clear yet. T has not said anything about it."
Bullish on the HBO Max narrative. Expansion to rest of world this summer with ad-supported subscription options will be excellent.
TBH this is a very good hedge in this volatile market
"Everywhere I look I see AT&T 5G adsIf next earnings are what I’m expecting, we will easily see pre pandemic $40’sRevenue growth is what the company has been positioning itself for. Big ships take time to turn. I think it’s almost there!"
There's no money in FAKE NEWS.
"Text from SEC filing MAY 17, 2021 - ATT""Attractive dividend – resized to account for the distribution of WarnerMedia to AT&T shareholders. After close and subject to AT&T Board approval, AT&T expects an annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 43% on anticipated free cash flow1 of $20 billion plus.""Deal must be voted on by Discovery shareholders..... but not ATT."
Can't You SeeTHOUSANDS OF BagholdersOn The PHONE ?
Well... better long term decision. This is the right path to go forward for T. This should be more focused on Telecommunication and broadband biz to stay ahead of TMUS
Moodys will determine it is a positive and in a few months Cramer will say Buy.
35 on T should be easy then we will see it try and breakthrough the 35 line or stall till it can breakthrough 35. Going up either way just a matter of time
Whats really sad...is al the retired folks that just want some income. Now they are buried alive in T....never to see 40.00 again
"T is spinning off media! What? All this support and growth and pumping of HBO MAX and movies, and now T is spinning it off. The stock will tank. You got to be kidding me. This is a nightmare."
This morning's rise is likely due to the NHL deal and T just due for a green day after so many red days lately. NOT CRAMER!
DISCA is under valued by 20%T will move up based on its 71% stakeGl!
T day is Monday! I might buy a boat. Why￼ the hell not? This is the dividend that keeps giving.
looks like good entry point for folks wanting a strong dividend.
"I wish i had not sold all AT&T stock at first of the year. I should have hung on to one share, then I could have been part of all the lawsuits comming AT&T way."
When will a press release be issued for the next dividend?
Just when you think t will break out the leadership plunges it back down again!
This is a great deal for T shareholders. These media assets will be way better managed now. T itself will concentrate on becoming a phone monopoly again. Great deal but will take time to work out.
"As someone that has a 25-35year time horizon in my account holding T, Ill be slowly buying shares below 30$ for some time. Dividend payout ratio is still 40% of free cash flow as opposed to 60% which is where it was in the previous few years. But over 40B$ reduction in debt for T with this Discovery deal, more free cash flow to reinvest into 5G/fiber and other core parts of the business, and potentially buy back shares at a discounted price if the stock keeps falling. If you are someone that is heavily invested in T with a very long time horizon before needing to use the cash invested in this, I am curious as to why are you selling?"
"Im long this dog, will add at low 20"
XOM and T have been by far the worst performers in my portfolio over the past decade. I’m losing faith.
Investors finally seeing the truth and not buying into these media assets swaps every three years...
Chin chin!!!!
"I had been very critical of T in the lack of info on Xandr and the implication that it was failing. BUT, I was wrong!! I'm thrilled to read this. I still wish they'd publicize it more but at least am glad to see the outstanding progress in a quantifiable way! Also, for those always complaining about strategy and overspending, etc, THIS is what they get out of the leverage of the TWX deal. Xandr Platform Spend Soars 75% in Digital Video and 235% in CTV for Q1 2021 NEW YORK --(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Xandr , AT&T’s data-enabled technology platform at the intersection of digital and TV, today shared results of premium video and connected TV (CTV) spend on its platform for Q1 2021, which saw significant increases. Product advancements across video and CTV buying and selling spurred the significant growth, as well as tools and partnerships in support of the bespoke needs of marketers across verticals like pharma and CPG.With analysts predicting digital video and CTV spend to grow 14.8%1 and 34.8%2 in 2021 respectively, Q1 spend on Xandr’s platform in these areas was impressive. Total digital video spend on Xandr’s platform – globally, across Xandr Invest’s DSP and Xandr Monetize’s SSP and ad server – grew 75% YoY in Q1 2021. The primary driver of this video spend growth across the platform is CTV, with total global platform spend up 235% YoY. Video now represents 35% of overall spend on Xandr’s platform.Growth in international platform spend is contributing significantly to Xandr’s overall global platform growth. Total platform spend in Xandr’s markets outside of the United States grew 30% YoY, with video spend up 55% YoY and CTV spend up 211% YoY.In a world where advertising must prove its worth, marketers are increasingly relying on Xandr Invest to demonstrate outcomes and validate return on ad spend. Global spend on Xandr Invest grew 35% YoY, with spend specifically on CTV jumping 205% YoY, as Xandr scales strategic relationships through the demand chain, from agencies and holding companies to brands and direct marketers.Due to growing direct integrations with premium video publishers, CTV inventory is increasingly available and monetized through Xandr . Global seller revenues on CTV inventory, through spend on Xandr Monetize, grew 391% YoY.A unified model for a converged futureAnother highlight of Q1 2021 was the completed launch of Crown Media Family Networks on Xandr's linear optimization platform and integration with Xandr's marketplace. Crown Media Family Networks’ premium inventory is now available for automated audience-based buying through Xandr's Invest TV platform. In Q2 2021, Xandr will be focused on a unified inventory model for converged yield across digital, linear and addressable TV.Important advances to CTV buyers’ visibility and confidenceTo increase advertisers’ understanding of the growing opportunity of premium video, Xandr released its global guide, CTV: Advertising’s Creative Canvas, in January 2021 , featuring global thought leadership from product experts at EBX, Finecast, Nine, 10 ViacomCBS, LiTV, GroupM, Xaxis, Jellyfish, France Télévisions Publicité, Matterkind, ShowHeroes, Omnicom Media Group , Peach, Vitor Media, DIRECTV GO, Hearts & Science, MiQ and Philo.

Does anyone know what new shares of media company will trade at and how much each share of AT&T will get of the new company ?
And look at that Cramer jumps on the band wagon
"After looking over this mb and reading a few writings, it looks like everyone is trying to get everyone to sell. That means we should be buying. Right?"
"It's time to sell AT&TIn short, investors should expect the ""new"" AT&T's growth to remain anemic, its debt levels to remain high, and its dividend payments to be lower. Moreover, there's no guarantee that WarnerMedia and Discovery will fare much better in the streaming race as a stand-alone company.AT&T's low valuation might set a floor under the stock, but investors should sell it and consider buying better dividend stocks with comparable yields for now."
"those who bought today will know the meaning of ""dont catch a fallibg knife"" after this week "
Cramer is a showman thats all he is
"Can T close above $30?If so, that’s pretty bullish"
As for as Discovery shares they are undervalued by about 20% now. Clearly the Market cap around 20 bln $T shareholders get around $70 bln in value. It is around $10 value per shareGl!
Oh for the days to be stuck at 29.99
Remember when they wanted to control the cable t.v. market.
Only a select few insiders know the real plan for T in the future.The secret: They plan to bring back the telegraph side of the business as a new technology for communication. Businesses are lining up to use the technology.Bone up on your Morse code!
"This looks similar to what I saw when Dominion cut their dividend. A large initial drop mainly from retirees and other income investors getting out. Although unlike Dominion, at least T shareholders will own additional shares of the new company when it is finalized."
General Electric????
"Monday, May 17, 2021 9:45 AM $33.71Tuesday, May 18, 2021 4:00 PM$29.55Negative 12.34%Yup, Wall Street sure seems to love this move :)"
"The board needs to go after Randall Stevenson's golden parachute, and call back that retirement. He set AT&T adrift in a sea of debt, and then took the only lifeboat."
Enthusiasm was replaced with reality when everyone started to analyze details.
It could have been worse We discussed It's not going to be WorldCom. It's going to survive like GE but will trade around 13
I Just LOVE T ! I Do Feel Sorry For theBags That Bought In The Low 30's.....HOWEVER.....Be Patient ! Collect The HUGE DIVVY For Another Year !
First everyone is negative on the deal & then you'll start seeing everyone turn positive. Just relax.
It is called divvy for stock swap operation twist.
Buy buy buy
alot can change before this closing mid 22.and dividends good till then.
Just on CNBC Fast Money Karen Finerman said she did not like deal and said is staying away. I am almost certain she recommended T at during the final trades at lunchtime show!
Does anyone know what the dividend will be?
This is a great deal
You will get one AT&T traded at about 33 range and a separate stocks that make up the capitcal gain.Happy investing..
"Congratulation to all those who believed in this company. There is a ton of money going your way because while people were fearful, you got greedy."
Thanks for the pump on Mad Money yesterday Jimmy Chill 
Think of it this way. T will be giving you your dividends in advance when the merger goes through via shares in Discovery
"This stuff just not getting enough attention. Why should someone get to parade around as an ""expert"" and even has his own show that pushes that idea. We don't have to hate on him personally, but it's just not right that he goes unchecked. So here's just one example:Around the time the merger between T and TWX was announced:“I want the deal to go through because I think the combined companies would be terrific, but I’m not against it, particularly for income,” Cramer said.......and just the other day:""this is the final act in one of the dumbest mergers in history.""Come on, this just ain't right."
"DO NOT SELL!! Increase your position at the price target comfortable for YOU. If you’re a dividend investor, times like these is when you buy buy buy. The younger you are, the more shares you should buy in my opinion. You have less risk since you have longer till retirement. The MOST important thing to remember is......DRIP DRIP DRIP!!!"
Good numbers..congrats long
"CNBC’s parent company is in direct competition with AT&T. Anyone with half a brain knows Mad Money and Fast Money are going to badmouth this move. In 6 months, when AT&T is up to $40, you won’t hear a peep out of Cramers mouth about the company"
Open under 30.
"People keep posting that the dividend is ""safe"" because you can sell off your DISCA shares to make up for the cut. Isn't the value of the DISCA shares offset by a reduction in the share price of T when the deal settles? If so, it's equivalent to selling off your T shares to ""maintain the dividend"". Keep doing that and let me know where you end up."
With HBO Max and 5G this you would think would be $65 a share! It's a going to get there one day.
"Dow Jones NewswiresMay 17, 2021 10:14 AM ETAT&T also signaled it will cut its dividend to reflect its smaller size once the media business is carved out into a separate company. The Dallas company said it expects an annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 43% from more than $20 billion of expected free cash flow, implying a total payout of between $8 billion and $8.6 billion. That payment to shareholders would amount to a little over half what investors have collected from the media and telecom conglomerate in past years."
Classic mistake. ATT solves product and technical problems with business solutions. Always a recipe for long term disaster. They endlessly carve up pennies rather than build products. Will sell at 30 and go back to MO and PM.
"Is there something options-special about $29.50-ish?As a longterm (infinite term) investor I have no clue about options nor have any ongoing interest in them enuf to try to learn about them, but don't mind asking those who DO know options that lead-in question!"
AT&T Is in Talks to Combine Content Assets With Discovery Hope the market likes this
Sold at 31.62 Buy back at 22? 1.14 dividend/22 = 5.18% Not bad
"Complete nightmare!! I'm sorry to the Shareholders. It's GE all over again but they made it clear their Debt was out of control and were not able, capable to run the business so goodbye Dividend."
"little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff sez ""no interest in T right now""......since he owns ZERO ATT common stock and as the share price rises and he received ZERO dividend distribution......DUH!.....mebbee his options gambling will make up the difference......NOT"
We did it !!!!
Can this ever see $40 in June??/
T will no longer be on the Dvidend Aristocrats list.
Thou shalt not cut the dividend. Enjoy your free fall. I’m out.
"WELL Homegamers.......For Better Or Worse......I'M IN AGAIN !Just Bought 28,600 Shares @ 28.72. I Think It's OVERSOLD !"
"TLet me guess. Cheetah is lying about being busy playing golf again now. He does that whenever he strikes out, which is early and often."
So the CEO admitted that their entry into media was a big mistake. Let the lawsuits begin. Lawyers everywhere will jump on this.
DC Investments has a P/T of 22 per share
"I just cancelled my stop loss order after a second thought. It is obvious a mistake that AT&T got into media and now it is trying to ratify it. This spinning off the media unit and let another media company to run it seems to be a good idea. AT&T receives 43 billion and retains 71% of the new company. If 43 billion is 29%, then the whole Warner Media is worth 148.28 billion. This sure beat selling the media part off at a lost. I bought AT&T mainly for its dividend and some potential growth. If AT&T cuts the dividend half, it is still not bad. So, I lost some dividend but gain more potential on growth. AT&T still retains the profitable communication unit and instead of paying some experts a lot of money to run its media operation, it pulls in another company with experience and stake to run it. This new deal does not look bad at all. I am holding on for the time being."
tomorrow under 30 I will buy more .maybe 29. LONG term it will be a good deal .
"Didn't hold near 34, nor 33, and now 32 in line to fall. As I said at 2 in the morning: nightmare."
"The market is long overdue for a correction. T is the safest place to ride out the storm. Assertions about inflation are way overblown. Inflation is a byproduct of a healthy economy. Some more than usual as the economy recovers from the DJT pandemic mess. But long, long, long away before treasurey, bond, or CD rates make AT&T anything less than a highly desirable income oriented stock."
"Honestly, I was holding on to hope for T. But, I gave up this week. Moved money to MO and DIV. Can breathe again."
Never see 29 again.
"$32.25 close. Like nice round numbers, not the .99 stuff."
"Okay, okay, I am calmer now. T is up about 2% just minutes into pre-market trading. I get nervous when I am caught off guard with my big investments. Maybe this spin off is a good thing, will increase the price of T shares, which is all I care about. Show me the money Discovery."
The Dems are paying UBI for kids. $300/mo/kid. Why should the women work anyways. Full Employment numbers to be reached soon and the workforce participation rate to be at all time lows.
Bad Buy.........
"If the capital gains tax is raised from 20% to 39% it will benefit the big dividend payers. I think that rotation will be enough to rally T until it's paying a 5% dividend. At $42, the dividend is ~5%. That is a 34% gain from here and you still received the dividend as it climbed over the next 6 months to get there. Total return would be 40% for a very low-risk stock. That's a rally because of tax law changes. If HBO does well then there could easily be more gains and the best part will be all the analyst upgrades at $50 or $60. That will be the sell signal. Lol."
Craig Moffett is going to be on Fox Business in a few minutes. I'm sure he won't explain his $24 target on this stock.
"Friends of mine and some on this board scoffed at me for buying T when it was last in the 26s at the end of Oct. and early Nov. I am now up about 27% when one include the two dividends ($1.04) received since then. Now people are scoffing again at those holding or buying T. I will write another post like this when T is up another $7, when it is $39...and when I will be up 54% on my T money...that which I put into T because I knew the money was safe, that T was heading higher. In other words, I slept just fine knowing my money was in T. I could have put the money into other companies I research and follow, but I would not have slept as soundly as I have putting the money in one of them. I am still sleeping soundly, confident T is going to make me more money. Thank you longs. And good luck to us."
with talk of div. cut I put a stop on buying anymore until things get inked and signed just hold what I have
T is going to $40 by September 30th. 2021.
"Long time investor, first time posting here. I have a very big bet on the “T” to make a substantial move this year. HBO MAX is the future of streaming. Go “T”!!!.."
"Stankey should be fired after company splits. In fact, all the clueless buffoons that went along with Stephenson and Stankey to acquire Directv and Warner should be fired. Any halfwit would be able to tell you that no one watches cable tv anymore. Problem is that these 2 rich old white guys sitting in the c-suite drinking their single malts watching sports on cable tv, telling each other how great it would be to by Directv. When half the people already cancelled their cable and subscribed to Netflix. So, after dumb and dumber realized that, they went after Warner without thinking that they are not in the entertainment business. If I had a say, I'd have fired Stephenson the second he mentioned he wanted to buy Directv.All that being said, consolidating Warner with Discovery sounds good to me. And I am quite hopeful owning the newly created media giant."
"How many shares of T you'll get.New company will have 5 billion shares at a $130 billion valuation = $26 a share.$130 billion valuation less $43 billion to AT&T = $87 billion$87 billion X .71 = $61.77 to AT&T shareholders$61.77 / 7.14 billion O/S shares = $8.65$8.65 value of each AT&T share / $26 share price = .33269Each share of AT&T will receive .33269 shares in the new companyThis is all I guess until the final valuation of the new company is calculated, # of shares the new company determined, & adjustments are made."
After the spin off ATT will be a normal telephone company
Warren Buffet and Bill Gates told Private Investors that only 3 stocks are worth buying and Dividends..1 AT&T 2. ExxonMobil 3. Atria .....That's the Conference to Investors and they stressed Dividend stocks.
A great deal unless u need income. New company could be like netflix.
Cheetah sold his T at the bottom.HAHahAHAH/ahaaahhhhaaaa
Everybody on the border trustees of AT&T should be fired immediately for their affiliation with CNN and cutting of the dividend
"Good luck, longs. I think T will have good earnings."
Any idea if T has to pay if the merger does not go through? Last breakup of the T-Mobile purchase cost $3 billion in cash plus about a billion in spectrum.
This stock ATT should have ROARED higher by 3 or 4 points and closed at the high! Just goes to show you the Wall St. Casino!
IM IN 2K SINCE LAST YEAR MARCH. MY BEST INVESTMENT!
Does anyone know a good lawyer? T will be sued to the high heavens with the deal they just did? I can remember when they bought National Cash Register? What were they thinking?
"With significant damage done thus far, and the fact that everyone knows T will cut the dividend, the smart thing for T to do is cut the dividend now and save a huge chunk of money. If they do that, significantly more downside to come."
"Having been a Manager """"Senior "" for AT&T and UPS which quite...I chose AT&T. Very good Management company and they expect positive results. I made Gold Club..it's a good Company and very disciplined. But it rewards you."
"Debt is too much, 209 B. How r they going to pay off debt."
AT&T ￼ dividend
Holding my shares forever regardless of whether the stock is $20 or $40. Bottom lines is the divy payments are forever!
Analyst on BNN talking up AT& . Says now that they have their ship in order he sees a steady march back to all time highs and beyond. Fingers crossed!!!!
Simple! T come out and say dividend will be held as is until merger and at that point we will trade out part of your dividend for x number of shares in discovery. What do you think would happen to the share price if this was said?
"TSo let me get this straight. Stankey spends MONTHS hyping HBO MAX and paying down debt and then OOPPS, debt goes up as they have to spend billions on Spectrum and then he spins HBO MAX off. The guy is making it up as he goes. Nothing has changed at T. But what's scary is that Stankey has made it clear that the dividend is not ""sacred"" to him."
"By the way, why does anyone pay attention to Cramer. I suspect because he's loud, not because he's right."
when will ATT cut dividend? next quarter or when the spin off is completed in 2022?
"So you're going to hold this for 18 months until the deal goes through and wonder about the dividend all that time?And you're not going to sell and move into MO who pays 7% and is about to raise the dividend from $ 3.44 to anywhere from $ 3.58 to $ 3.66 ? A dividend KING, having raised their dividend every year for over 50 years? smhsmh"
T did good today. I see that Vagipuss waited until T moved up again to buy. Good strategy Vagi. Buy high and hold. LOL
"May 21, 2021 ...AT&T's Next Act -- Barron's : AT&T's close of $30 on Friday, that leaves $24 in per share value being assigned to the telecom business. If it pays $8 billion worth of annual dividends -- a sum that AT&T has indirectly forecast -- the post-spin AT&T would have a yield of 4.6%. That is still a generous payout, and one that exceeds the 4.4% paid by rival Verizon Communications (VZ). On that basis, buying AT&T today looks like a sound investment.And it could prove to be a bargain, if the new media company gets anywhere close to AT&T's earnings projections. Management has forecast that Discovery/WarnerMedia could generate $14 billion in adjusted Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization -- in 2023. Streaming leader Walt Disney (DIS) trades at 17 times 2023 Ebitda, while the less streaming-forward ViacomCBS (VIAC) fetches nine times.If Discovery/WarnerMedia winds up in the middle, its stock would be worth $12.54 per AT&T share today.Adding that to the $24 value of the telecom business would put AT&T at about $36 a share -- more than 20% above Friday's close."
Low volume accumulation phase for the next leg up. Gives everyone time to buy shares without chasing. Good luck to all!
is dividends stay the same with the sale? I only buy this stock for dividends.
So can someone tell me if the regular shareholders of T will get shares of the new company after this deal is done or how does that all work out? I have read that T shareholders will have 71% ownership of the new entity but I have no idea of what that looks like?
This board could get its wish. CNN to be sold off to Discovery lol.
"If you dont buy now you will regret it. Especially if you are a long. It is discounted thanks to Cramer, who is probably buying and other short investors who posted and paid for negative adds. Its all a game and dont be played. Buy NOW!!"
Let’s go 33 on Monday !
I should have buy more at 28. Now owned 500 shares
"Long time holders, I have a question...how does T hold up to inflation? We have not had inflation in the USA since I was a lot younger and barely invested in the market. The late 1970's-early 1980's period pre-dates the modern T data and the baby bell breakups. Thanks in advance. FWIW, my guess is CPI-U chain will print 266 tomorrow, a 3.7% increase YoY...if so, I expect the dollar to tank and gold will take off. Stocks, who knows, but industries without pricing power are going to get hammered. Restaurants and other discretionary down big. Industrial commodities like copper, aluminum, and steel stocks may reverse course too."
It’s good Warner Media will be in the hands of folks who can handle explosive international growth. And looks like T expanding into government cyber security. Play to your strengths
is dividend cut in this deal
"mc1550 you can sell but iam in for the long haul, making money now after 4 yrs."
Lots of conjecture here both favorable and unfavorable. And some are even trying to predict the bottom by using charts. I don't need a chart to tell me to stay away until it stops dropping!! LOL Such lunacy!!!
$48 October !

What is funny is was a 13 stock but the Dividend made it a Hold I recommend Selling period
AT&T has a total asset value of 551 billion. They must be planning on doing something with all that. What I don't know.
WHAT WILL BE THE DVD FOR T NEXT QUARTER????/
"The new AT&T will be a weaker Verizon. If I wanted Verizon, I would have bought Verizon. I didn't want Verizon. I wanted AT&T's dividend. We got screwwed. Most people will sell T now. We will see 26 very soon. T no longer fits my investment thesis. I should have sold. The new T has no advantage over Verizon. I wouldn't buy either one. Don't fall in love with a stock is the thing to take away from this treachery. How many times did Stankey and others say the dividend was safe. I heard him in the last quarterly report. He lied. This deal was in the works then, has been works. Liar. Criminal. Remember, he wants the price to drop so he can pick up cheap stock options over the next few years and then cash them in for a bigger price 5 to 7 years from now."
"After spin off of DISCA, T will be FINISHED as a stock. No avenues for growth left. T will become like Sprint."
"Att trades for way lower than Verizon and TMobile as a stock price to sales. That being said, it has a lot of room to climb just as a PURE 5g play, and you get to bank the spinoff. I say buy or hold"
"IQST in possible negotiations with TIGO to bring 5G to Latin America. TIGO currently rising at $45 a share. IQST currently at $0.50 a share. The IQST price point makes no sense, since the project could bring close to 1 billion in revenue."
Lagged markets yesterday. Lagging again today. Poor showing. Pfft.
John Malone is really sharp and knows what he is doing! Congratulations to T shareholders because you own 71% of the new company.
"I think AT&T is a long term buy, despite the div. decrease. More focus for long term growth prospects (ie. their 5G rollout, and will increase their competitiveness in the streaming networks. https://youtu.be/TKevSGG4xcA"
"WSJ : The new business, which isn’t yet named, will be led by current Discovery Chief David Zaslav. The companies said AT&T’s Jason Kilar will retain his title as WarnerMedia CEO. AT&T shareholders will hold a 71% stake in the new entity, while Discovery shareholders own a 29% stake.In exchange, AT&T said it would receive $43 billion of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia’s retention of certain debt.AT&T also said it would adjust its dividend policy to reflect the structure of the new media business. The company said it expects an annual dividend payout ratio of 40% to 43% from more than $20 billion of expected free cash flow.The Dallas company spent about $15 billion last year on the shareholder payouts, which many individual investors have long valued as a stable source of income."
So they're cutting the dividend by getting rid of loss making divisions. So where did the dividend come from?Makes no sense.
Cram it Cramer.
"Some on this board trying to confuse T long term shareholders and that the dividend will be cut as a result for this merger with discovery. The true objective of this merger is to bring value to current T assets as separate entities combined with Discovery. Instead of current dividend, T shareholders will own part of the new formed company and will continue to be paid a modified dividend based on T remaining business %40-%45 of generated cash value. It is a trade off... The shorts that are trying save their short position trying to confuse the situation. Details of this merger still to be shared. I am holding and buying more if it dips down."
"This was the most loved stock of few generations with dependable income especially for retirees. Just about a month ago, CEO confirmed the dividend will remain untouched! He lost his credibility, and AT & T's image is tarnished. I do not know whether they will ever recover!"
You have to be a long term holder. Have to expect that with a deal of this magnitude the price may drop 10-20% but it will eventually recover and you get a dividend while you wait.
At&t shareholder trust in management is about zero.
What will be the price of the new stock and will it go up in value
"Operation Twist --- divvy for stock swapMoses, 2021"
Big money flowing into T today. Should see $33 to $35 post Q1 earnings.

"100+ million shares traded today. 2X+ the average. Institutions getting back in at a d=good price point. Expect ""T"" to rise prior to dividend payment and pull back slightly. When the dust settles, ""T"" will begin paying down debt. A 10-15% rise in stock price is reasonable by August 1st."
"With covid going nowhere with all these variants, T seems to have a good model going forward with same day streaming and box office."
??? so is this a dead cat bounce. ATT is losing ~40% of it profit creation capability with the spinoff.... shouldn't the stock drop by 40% and get down to $20 - $25??? I'm just looking to buy more. The lower price gives me a higher dividend. Which is needed since this stock threads water.
What will be the value of Time Warner in the combined company. How much will ATT have to write down in order to make the spin off. This will show the enormous error they made in buying Time Warner. By the way I am not short T
Why didn’t the government go to a cyber security company. AT&T doesn’t make sense
Cut dividend?
Resistance is tight right now around this but if we break the 30 mark we could see an upward trend! Let’s get it men!
ALL LONG TIME DIVIDEND HOLDERSWILL GET OUT...NO REASON TO HOLD T ANYMORE.......GET OUT NOW !
ATT hiring Jason Kilar the streaming expert from Hulu & Amazon to be the CEO of Warner Media was a great move. He is expensive .....but will get outstanding results for stockholders.
"Can anyone explain to me how many shares of new company I will get for every share of T? Very poor announcement in my opinion, no clarity"
This transaction is just AT&T flushing another bad acquisition and hoping shareholder's don't remember they just bought this asset and spent a ton of time and focus on this vs. making the communications business more competitive. When you read articles about how most mergers and acquisitions fail AT&T will be the leader in how to screw up an acquisition and gut your existing company. Sad
Would like to see AT&T trading back in the $65 price per share range. We feel AT&T is a Strong Buy. On our Buy recommendation list.
In the background but soon to be up front will be Tesla's WiFi business. It is global and it will be everywhere shortly. Watch out cable companies and and dish players.
netflix about to get their share eaten away. absolutely nothing proprietary ab that business and all ab content these days - smart of at&t to bundle it with services
"Cramer recommended T today on Mad Money, said he has changed his mind for the many reasons he mentioned, which pertained to T's great quarterly earnings. Finally, he sees the light. ""You have my blessings to buy it, first time is 16 years,"" he said."
Discovery is getting killed. Down over 18% since Monday. It's the Craig Moffett effect. He said Discovery got the best side of this deal. LOL
$43 October
I was looking for this supprise!
"look at the after hours activity on the SPY, DIA, and the QQQ. They’re ALL down. And they will be down tomorrow. AT&T is not this novel stock that will break the trend of the market. AT&T will drop lower tomorrow. And plus, financial advisors who haven’t informed their clients of the dividend cut will be calling their clients tomorrow and or clients who are just finding out tonight will be calling them. More selling because of the dividend tomorrow."
"All that talk of ""best 5G"" of ""best Network"" that are unmeasurable for the guy on the street are not going to matter. It is the additional carrots of movies/content/live TV etc with your internet, phone, cell service etc that makes for sticky customers. ATT is the only one that can do that. And with their hands in the Ad revenue cookie jar, they can play with the price point to their hearts content and recoup it elsewhere."
"The market is up about 9.5% YTD. Any inflation will disappear when the supply chains catch up and re-establish (it’s not a bad problem to have because it indicates healthy demand), interest rates are staying low. The market including T is fine."
"Based on 71% of the new entity, T shareholders should receive somewhere between $5 to $15 of Discovery stock. So @ $29 a share, the T stock price after divesture is being valued at somewhere between $14 and $24 per share. When the dividend gets cut to $1.11 or so, that implies a dividend yield of between 4.6% and 7.9% at those share prices.On average, that's not quite as high as the yield has been in the past, but is still pretty significant.The total valuation of the post-divesture T at those prices is somewhere between $100 to $170 Billion.Now post-divesture T will have about 80% of the revenue, and 70% of the operating income of pre-divesture T, so I figure it should have about 70 to 80% of the Market Cap - Note this excludes any benefits T gets from the debt draw down and renewed focus on Communications, but also excludes any market cap hit based on loss of respect for management. The market cap before the announcement was somewhere around $230 Billion. 70-80% of that indicates a post-divesture market cap of between $160 to $185 Billion.So... I figure what's really happening is rotation out of the stock by income investors, and not quite so much interest by media investors yet as they try to figure out what the new Discovery is worth. Seems like more upside than downside at these levels, and that you'll get paid to wait. Might not be a screaming deal, but worth a few nibbles. Also seems a bit better value than VZ now..."
What a beautiful stock!
"honestly this wont find any support until 27 ish, and even that may not hold if market is red rest of this week"
"I see Green all the way.1/ finally a company (AT&T) realising quickly that the acquisition of WM does not work as planned and deciding to focus on their core business.2/ Getting $45B for letting WM go being able to immediately offload 1/3 of their debt and invest more money on their core business.3/ Existing shareholders will receive in stock 71% of the new company4/ Existing shareholders will still get approximately 55% of existing dividend, around 3.5% on current price which can go higher if the stock moves to low/mid 20's as predicted.Overall I see this as an opportunity, esp after a few days when it lands on a support zone and stabilises"
If the new media company has a market cap of $100B and ATT has a market cap of $200B would that not about 40% higher than the current market cap of ATT? $100B is conservative if you look at Netflix market cap.
"There are a lot of long term investors who held T for their dividend. Its just a fact so when that yield goes down they will look elsewhere.Add the fact that Stanke was just on Mad Money in the past month and said that that yield would get reduced through stock appreciation and not a cut. Now it's being ""reassessed"" not even a month later so what are Longs supposed to believe? It's a terrible look so of course there will be selling."
Three more days AT&T will pay there div. Looks great. Big pay day for stock holders.
UBS upgrades T to Buy after Warner/ Discovery deal.
Do I understand that after the merger/spin off if you have 100 shares of T you'll be getting 71 shares of the newly formed company?
"BTW, where is ELIOT Management with their ultimatum???"
I want David Zaslav on ATT'S board.It's like somebody opened the windows and let fresh air in.1
The “no news is good news” approach by VZ will soon be a “no news is a good noose” for them once the pandemic is over and the sub leeching games between VZ and TMUS is the only game they have....
"After merger, there will be two stocks. One for AT&T orignial and one for media growth..One divvy and one growth.. That is my guess."
"Haven’t comprehended all the details but from what I understand when the deal closes mid-2022 the cash flow from T to fund the dividend will be in the 40% range as opposed to 55% that supported the 2020 payout. They justify this decline will be offset by the appreciation of the new company that the shareholders will receive. Added more today under 32 to lock in an annualized 6.5% yield on these shares through year end and then evaluate. As the largest position in my dividend portfolio I was looking forward to a dozen years of over eight percent compounded from my cost basis. But life changes, and you have to as well."
"How many articles on the latest AT&T fiasco with Warner Media (making the DirecTV fiasco look like child's play) remind readers that about 20 years ago, AT&T did EXACTLY the same thing. They bought a bunch of cable companies for exorbitant prices, got themselves saddled with a debt load that was massive ($55 billion back then), and then had to sell what they had bought when they recognized the debt load was too much to handle? And ironically, John Malone was involved in that fiasco also (only Malone always comes out on top when dealing with AT&T), as he sold TCI to AT&T back then for a whopping $50 billion. In the end, Comcast wound up with the cable assets and went on to become the dominant cable and internet provider today, with a stock price increasing accordingly, while AT&T stumbled around, waiting for more opportunities to blow shareholder money. Those opportunities presented themselves later in the form of DirecTV and Warner Media.You can't make this up."
I am a shareholder of T. I have read much about what is going on and Everyone has a different opinion of what is going to happen. I called my Broker @ Raymond James -Even he is not completly aware of what is going to happen. T Management has not fully told share holders and the Media what is going to happen. My opinion they dont really know.Only thing I do know is T owes 169 Billion $$$$ and that is NOT GOOD
""""" AT&T, long known for a hefty dividend, said it plans to “reset” the dividend after the deal goes through. It will lower the dividend payout ratio, which is the percent of net income paid to shareholders in dividends, from about 60% to around 40%.""""""So long sweet yield. Now what will the share price(s) do with these two ?"
Buy now. Guaranteed near 7% yield plus capital gains to $40 - we're looking at 40% gains when the merger happens in 2022. Easy money.
Nice to wake up to a 5200 dividend!
T will still pay a 7% dividend @ $25.00 a share. That’s literally equal to 5% @ $33.00 a share.They’ll insist they didn’t cut the dividend after all.
"I’m down about a 100k with close to 20,000 shares I’m going to ride it out only 5 pts from breaking even."
The fact that this was a $30 a month ago shows is amazing
Stanky buys telegraph equipment to sat up new communication infrastructure. Belies it’s the new push button phone!
Inflation death spiral has begun. Could last years. Seek safety and solace in T's 6.5% divy.
This is all to easyIt will be great if you can toast some shorts but in the coming weeks I think you are going to see another sell off as new valuations are realized.Any way you say it the fact is we just lost 45 billion dollars a short time after losing billions on direct tv
Nice drop. I'll be rebuying around $15
"Stephanie Link just said AT&T is a Buy, live on CNBC."
Sam you don’t have to buy that package!!
Panic sold your shares? Obviously we are finding a bottom here. Safe to get back in.
"For all of you who are banking on a greater valued investment with the two companies rather than one, let me remind you that this is still the T management and that investors were also excited when they bought Direct TV and Warner. So how ell have they managed both businesses and how well have each done. The truth is that you have no idea (nor does anyone else) how the separate businesses will be valued after the deal is done but we do know that the market doesn't think much of T's ability to pull this off as witnessed by today's price. Take the blinders off and proceed at your own peril."

T slow growth going nowhere..now let's watch grass grow. Buy discovery...sell t
T has been trading in a $30-$40 range for more than a decade.It's just a glorified CD.
We should test 40 soon. This new leadership team is not fooling around.
"Let me put HBO MAX into perspective. $15 a month time 12 is $180. Multiply this $180 by the 2.7 million added subscribers to get 486 million. Now if we multiply that by 4 quarters, we get almost 2 billion additional dollars of revenue. This is just the start. When HBO MAX is released to the 61 countries....Well, T will add tens of billions to revenue EVERY YEAR. T could become a monster. $40 is peanuts. $60 is not enough. Look at Netflix. Get the picture?"
"It is not divvy stock, it is 5G play and Video streaming growth company now."
long time investors are only in for the dividend. big sell off when the dividend is reduced.
T will end up in the green today. Guaranteed.
Just asking who could vote these people in? a fair question. During the height of a very deadly virus covid we have now OPEN BOARDERS! and cnn and msnbc turns a deaf ear. Kids are staying in hotels on our tab.
Plus nine cents is better than minus nine cents. Look at it that way. 18 cents difference. LOL
T is cheaper than VZ and higher divvy. what not to like...
This is next GE in making.
AT&T next resistance level: $26.50.
"After 5 years including dividends 400 shares I am down $2,6000. How is that a great investment?"
Nice breakout on heavy volume - new $32 to $35 range established.
"So Moffett says ""Discovery got the better end of this deal."" That's great Craig because we (AT&T) own 71% of Discovery."
AT&T share holder will get 70% of the combined company.. and AT&T reduces significant debt..it is excellent...
Massive sell block at $29. If we break that we could go back to $29.20’s today
Green first time in 4 yrs.
ATT= IS DOING MORE THAN OK=THE $$$ IS COMING IN=MUCH FASTER THAN GOING OUT=DIVIDENDS/EARNINGS
Will the big players hold the price below $30 at market close?
Market meltdown and T is holding up just fine.
"As for the asset buyer Discovery, Wall Street is offering mostly praise to management and hope for the stock price. Closely followed Wells Fargo media analyst Steve Cahall said in a research note that Discovery is really worth $46 to $47 a share in light of the transaction and subsequent assets the company is gobbling up. Those who are selling here didn’t do proper DD or simply Shorts trying to create a panicAfter the spin off both will be more focused in their respective businesses.Gl!"
"Dividend cut reality setting in. Still time to sell and switch to MO, a dividend KING (50+ years of dividend INCREASES)."
The nice thing is that too much debt is no longer an issue for AT&T
Cramer should apologize to all the people who bought high and sold low.
Let’s see: $28B haircut but we’re doing a good job! Wholesale change and start over
Homegamers.......Selling Is About Over......The Gramps and Grannies That Own This Won't Even NoticeThe Dividend Cut !
"I keep saying, T is a $30 stock and you have to have some kind of trading strategy to make money with T but nobody wants to listen. As the great Yogi Berra once said, You've got to be very careful if you don't know where you're going, because you might not get there.In the meantime, those May 21 $75 FANG Puts I sold on the 22nd for $5.40 each as well as the Apr 30 $24.50 BP Puts that I sold on the same day for .65 each are both doing great."
"I see no way this occurs without T either taking on more debt or diluting shareholders.Wow, they really are fighting for their life."
Everybody watch Cramer to get people to sell Bitcoin so he can buy low and sell again on the bounce .This guy is a joker
Sold 3500 shares of T yesterday and glad I did.
Acquisition of Time Warner did not change the dividend. Spinning it off should have very little to no effect on the dividend.
"Too bad that the ceo didn't have a name for the new company that he could have announced on CNBC this morning. He was really not very well prepared for the interview. A name would have given the new company some validity and possibly have stirred up some interest.""Shareholders of T will be receiving shares of 'xyz' company when the merger occurs."" The interview was a disappointment, imo."
"Hey sell ""T"" and go with Cramer recommendation who has not beat the S&P gains based on a 5 year or 10 year time frame. This is a financial decision made by John T. Stankey and the BOD's to stick with the core business (Many utility companies diversified and realized to get back to the core business) and reap the rewards of the new company in the long term. This market is so short term based and this is a long term play. Good luck to all."
Big pay day!
Keep grinding up and paying the divy
"Before this stupid spinoff news, i mentioned how the Friends reunion special might be an nice, additional catalyst for hbomax. My post didn't get a lot of support and someone even dogged me over it. haha. But seriously, this thing is EVERYWHERE. You see the cast of ""Friends fans"" joining?? Bieber, Lady Gaga, even Malala. So say what you want, but I bet this thing provides a real nice boost for hbomax subs....though such a result would be a little muted given the news (and yes, yes, i do know that we still benefit from warner success given we'll own W-D shares)."
"What happens to put and call options opened prior to the deal transaction but, with expiration post deal transaction?For T the company jettisoned a large piece of the company dropping the post, for DISCA the company no longer exist?"
Wait till CNN starts streaming on HBO Max. It will take off like a rocket.
"This has a smell of GE. Too much debt, pursues crummy business our of their comfort zone, dumping business, cutting divy, ...... Couple years down to teens."
"NICE TRADE GOING !Bought 28,600 @ 28.72..It's ON SALE ! BUY BUY BUY"
T stock owners must equate the spinoff shares of new company with divy cut and T price drop.
spin off news....spartan in a sniviling spiral....so loooong.....
"Attn. Mark ,what do you do about CNN ,dont watch and change channels !"
"Morningstar's take: (Maintains $36 fair value)AT&T Unwinds Its Media Strategy; Discovery Deal HighlightsMedia ValueAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 17 May 2021""CEO John Stankey has wasted no time putting his mark on AT&T and we like the direction he’s headed.AT&T announced plans to spin off WarnerMedia and immediately merge the firm with Discovery tocreate a new media company. AT&T shareholders will own 71% of the new entity, which will assume$43 billion of AT&T’s debt load. The deal essentially completes the unwinding of former CEO RandallStephenson’s strategic vision, which we’ve long considered ill-conceived, as reflected in our Poorcapital allocation rating.While we like this move, we don’t expect to change our $36 fair value estimate. CombiningWarnerMedia with Discovery should enhance the value of the new firm, though not to an extent thatwe expect will have a huge impact on AT&T's worth overall. The transaction does highlight the value ofWarnerMedia, which we suspect would be trading well in excess of the roughly $100 billion AT&T paidfor it, net of divestitures, if it were a stand-alone firm today. We also wouldn't rule out the possibilitythat another firm makes a play for WarnerMedia--we still believe it would pair well with Comcast's NBCUniversal--but we wouldn’t count on it, either. We view AT&T shares as fairly valued.AT&T used this announcement as cover to cut its dividend substantially. The firm will target a payout ofaround $8 billion-$9 billion annually, down from nearly $15 billion in 2020. While this shift will likelydisappoint shareholders, we think it makes sense, especially considering the market hasn’t given thefirm much credit for the payout, holding the stock’s yield around 7% in recent years. The firm will set thedividend at around 40% of free cash flow, down from more than 60% in 2020, leaving substantial excesscash to reduce leverage or take advantage of opportunities, including share repurchases. That free cashflow figure also contemplates a sizable increase in network investment, notably in fiber infrastructure,which we believe is important to AT&T’s long-term health.Business Strategy & Outlook Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 8 Apr 2021AT&T has been in investors’ penalty box for some time, and rightly so in our view. The firm made a stringof ill-advised capital allocation decisions, culminating with the 2018 purchase of Time Warner, that haveleft it open to justified criticism. However, we believe management is now putting the firm on the rightpath.The wireless business is AT&T’s most important, accounting for about 40% of revenue (more than halfafter partially divesting the television business to TPG). AT&T is now the third-largest player in the U.S.,but we believe it has adequate scale relative to Verizon and T-Mobile to generate solid profitability. AT&T also benefits from its ownership of deep network infrastructure across much of the U.S. and its abilityto provide a range of telecom services, particularly among enterprise customers. Also, we believe the TMobile merger greatly improved the industry’s structure, leaving three players with little incentive toprice irrationally in search of short-term market share gains. We don’t believe Dish Network presents acredible threat to the traditional wireless business.WarnerMedia, AT&T’s second largest segment, remains a media powerhouse with a deep contentlibrary and the ability to reach audiences across a wide variety of platforms. The firm’s direct-toconsumer plans around HBO Max are gaining momentum, which should nicely augment and eventuallysupplant traditional distribution mechanisms. This position should enable its studios and networks toremain a destination of choice for the best content creators well into the future.AT&T’s remaining businesses should contribute with reasonable consistency as well. The enterpriseservices business provides solid margins and should pair well with wireless services as 5G gainsmomentum. The consumer fixed-line business remains disadvantaged, but we like the firm’s renewedplan to invest in fiber to both stabilize this business and support the wireless network. The traditionaltelevision business (DirecTV) is also in a challenging position, but we believe the deal with TPG providesan incentive to quickly find strategic alternatives for the assets""."
"The comments on the board are very interesting. It is nice to read different opinions. I will remain very skeptical about the management integrity and future growth. However, I plan to stick with AT&T until they definitely cut the dividend. I bought it only for dividend even thought the company had high debt."
"During the good old day's of President Carter, we had banks offering 15+%cd's, run away inflation, long leisure days waiting to try to get gas, getting to sit at home because of massive layoffs. Good days comming again thanks to AT&T."
CNN ruined AT&T ....
CNN profits off of slandering people..
Cramer = #$%$
4.7% close
It might hit 52 week high and low in two days!BOD doesn’t have a clue!
Tomorrow watch the institutional investors who lent the shares buying back vigorously. This is going to be easy money when those who shorted the begin to cover.The valuation after the merger is btw $32 - $41Minimum it will move back to $31/32 since Discovery management is focused and better at execution.Gl!
"Well, this is not quite the DirecTV/Time Warner / CCN divestiture but it does raise about $5 billion which can go towards reducing debt/ assisting with the 5G buildout. I still believe DIRECTV/TW/CNN can bring in a substantial amount for debt reduction."
"8 or 9 dividends surrendered since Monday’s high yet some still saying “big deal, I get 4 over the next year.You can’t make this stuff up."
how many shares of discovery do we get ???????????????
"T is for ""toast."""
I wonder how the stock would do if the dividend were cut to zero. I better ask Biden. He’s a genius.
Vincent MUTED!!!
"Moffett says ""Discovery got the better of this deal."" That means they didn't."
So many sad bears today
"Enjoy your weekend and relax. T slowly but surely will get around $40 by ex spin off date. Once the spin off takes place, T price will trade at discount of 25% at $30... Build up your position now, and sell low risk covered call, while collecting your dividends. Now don't sell after the spin off because dividend reduction, just hold and watch T get leaner and stronger."
"T shareholders get a div cut, in exchange for Discovery/Warner Media shares, a company that will be heavily indebted right off the bat, owing T $43B in addition to existing Discovery debts..."
"If you sell now,you want get any shares of new company right,just heard that on news this morning,anybody hear that?"
"Sell and take your loss. I've been invested in other companies that had ""debt issues"" and let me tell you, the market has no mercy for when companies are paying down debt instead of growth/acquisitions. The share price stays flat or slowly declines and the company announces nothing other than about how they paid down 1-2% of the outstanding debt per quarter. Without anything to get investors excited, the stock price stays stagnant for years! T used to have the nice div but now that is gutted. Time to move on."
"Wait, is 31.99 the new 29.99 now lol"
lots of boomers/reitrees who requested to their financial advisors/brokers to sell their $T yesterday after catching up to the dividend cut news snd scam merger. Those selling orders taking effect today once market opens.
Well Cramer has after some years renewed his WALL of SHAME and his 2 new inductees John Stanley and Randall Stephenson for gross mishandling of the Company formerly know as AT&T as they have ruined it
"The reason they HAVE to cut the dividend is simply that can’t afford it,IF I owned this stock I wouldn’t run to the door fast enough,stinky stankey simply is in desperation mode,look out below,this thing will be gobbled up by the shorts tomorrow,see ya"
"WHEN Long Suffering Shareholders RealizeNO MORE DIVIDEND.......Massive, Just MASSIVE.....SELLING !"
"a year ago i sold all T, and the price was the exactly same as today. so i could have 7% margin if i did not sell T, that is not bad. but if they decrease dividend, who would invest T ?"
"the ceo knew he couldnt juggle media and the communication business, he had to have someone takeover that knows what theyre doing with time warner"
How does Buffet feel about choosing VZ over T now? :P
CNN is just socialist propaganda. It's AT&T's best foot forward.
finally T is coming alive
Apollo close to buying Vz's media assets including Yahoo.
The only saving grace would be if the new AT&T had less shares to pay out and the dividend didn't have to be cut because less shares were being paid out. But I've seen nothing to suggest this.
Who is paying the $43B to T? The newco that isn't even born yet...
"Bash all you want, drive the price down as much as you can. All I see is upside potential for the patient. I will be adding shares as the panic selling goes on, if you sat around waiting for a dividend why can’t you sit around and wait for growth?"
Told you guys about T for the past week or so but I kept getting down voted. I told you guys to stop buying and hold for the dip.
Why aren't people and major investment companies from all over the world buying tons of shares of ATT stock now if this is such a great move for Att? It's still down from Monday's announcement.
GE and now AT&T. Two disasters over the years thanks to disastrous management. A lot of their C-Level execs should be dangling from trees.
T employees move your 401k T fund now. You get market price at close not the after hours price that will be down big.
This is some stock lol
When there is blood in the street. Start buying!!!When the birds are chirping spring has sprung!!!
I like how they said they were resizing the dividend. Why not be honest and say they were cutting the dividend. Why not be honest say they screwed up bigtime buying those media companies and they want to get them off the books and concentrate on their core business. A little honesty goes a long way in building creditability.
130 million shares dumped today. I bet Elliot Management dumped its T shares...again.
"Lets see 7.1 billion shares Institutions hold only 52% and only 117 million shares are short. Lots of Moms and Pops have yet to find out. Let the knife hit the floor and bounce before even thinking about picking it up. T still has too much debt and a lot of 5g investment to make. When John Legere referred to dumb and dumber, I'm thinking T was dumber."
"I only am here for the good dividends, so today's earnings comes as a nice surprise. Good to own shares of a company with good products."
AT&T's motto: How do you make a small fortune in the Stock Market? Answer: Start with a big one
"The close on volume with rising price, right above 30 ... says everything. The deluge is over."
Is the merger good or bad for shareholders?
Is T buying Discovery or Discovery buying Warnermedia or part of it
"T, Discovery, Disney and Comcast is down. What."
"Look at those beautiful upgrades for T stock. I told y'all Cramer is sleeping with Comcast and trying to pump the stock down. No fear and no panic, this is a great spinoff/merger T is positioning it's shareholders to make some serious money. You should never listen to Cramer/ CNBC they always have their own motives...."
So far it sounds like giving your competition billions of dollars and saying make good decisions for me
OPENBetween $27 and $28.......SEE YOU THERE !
"Besides T, I also own shares in VIV (Telefonica Brazil). VIV's debt to cash is very small, although their 9% div probably needs a cut, their books are quite healthy. Just a heads up for those running from T and looking for passive income on a stable (Brazilian, U.S. traded) blue chip. They pay divs semi-annually and sometimes a surprise div/payment. Brazil telecom is also a growth market. E.g. Canada pension fund invests in Brazilian fibre. Just a suggestion if you're looking for divs with solid books and growth. Of course, as always, please do your own DD. Glta. --> https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-pension-fund-cdpq-invest-220810943.html"
T ~ I didn’t buy Sprint @ 7 bucks a share thought that was high now T-Mobile & Sprint @ 130 ? No thank you
T CEO has to come out and explain how good the deal is.
DIVIDEND......... so based on a 20Bil cash flow for T ( less Warner media ) and 40-43% dividend projection it seems that the dividend would be about 8.4Bil divided by 7Bil shares . So maybe a $1.20 Div per share. At the current share price that results in a 3.7% return. So only looking at T.......... after the media shares are separated what will the share price be? Will it drop down to $18-20 to give a shareholder a 5-6% yield?3.7% is a difference from 6-7%. Of course you will be getting shares of the new Media giant ( 71% ) maybe with no dividend. The total value of your T shares + new Warner\Discovery shares may increase in value ..... but not exciting if you are in T for the dividend.
Very undervalued. However it is a great opportunity to pick up some shares.
ATT to the pink sheets.
"Moffett said, ""Discovery got the best end of this deal."" Yea, Craig, that's why the stock has dropped $6 bucks the last 3 days. What ever he says, shareholders do the opposite. LOL"
There are so many great stocks i don’t see why anybody would own T
T could still tank today.
Only about 14 months until we see how this all shakes out. LOL 4 more dividends of 52 cents. Panic is always a bad decision in my humble opinion.
"As a long-term (25-year) investor in AT&T, frankly I applaud this decision. Five years ago I made the suggestion that AT&T suspend its dividend for 3 years, directing the savings (at the time around $36 billion) to debt. I was pilloried for making such a ""foolish"" recommendation (turns out, not so foolish after all). And like many posters herein, I was not in favor of the TimeWarner deal at all. Yes, the payout will likely be cut in half. But in the long term, this will be a positive for investors."
"While I remain a bit skeptical about this deal, the more I read the better I like it. Thus I bought back at $30 the 6000 shares I had sold at $31.20 so I'm back where I was but with an extra $7200 cash. Part of my decision is the anticipation of the current dividend being paid our unchanged for at leas 2 more quarters and possibly more. I like the idea that one of the poster floated that one could merely sell all the shares of Discovery after the merger and use them to buy shares of the by then much lower priced and lower dividend paying T and end up with pretty close to the same dollar amount of dividend, albeit a lower yield."
Recall how much HBO was in the 90s: 35 to 50 bucks was it? HBO MAX should be at least 29.99 a month. At least!
Anybody that didn't bail the minute Stankey froze the dividend and move into something like MO is a true novice.
"VZ: But, But....we gotz the bestest network...see results of meaningless Ookla survey right ther....... hey where are you all goingCustomer: Them got the Max for free, bro..."
"The forecast today is for RAIN.Money is raining down from Money Heaven -- where evaporated dollars of T value have been hiding. Please, let it rain..."
Sold all. Bot for hi dividend. They don't care about shareholders.
is the DIV the whole story? really?
"Investment idea 101: Sell T, buy Dogecoin. Be happy."
"T. It is already too late. The streaming business is a total mess. What is the consumer going to end up with. It is going to require the average consumer sign up for 4, 5, or even 6 streaming services to get what they formerly got from their cable operator. All the streaming group is doing is remixing the same content to improve their own cash flow... to hell with the consumer."
Truly remarkable how the big telecoms with supposedly the best and the brightest management are so terrible at M&A.
CNBC just said the dividend will be cut.I’m out
One issue I have not seen a lot of commentary on. Could the deal be torpedoed by the FTC or Justice simply by demanding too much in divestitures or give-a-ways of assorted services. We saw what happened the last time around with Telephone and the Feds. Took years. Why should it be different this time? Is it really a given this can get done in one year?
A lot of the selling is because HBOMax was going to make T a streaming giant. Just wait till dividend really is cut and watch the mass exit. You all assume this is dividend selling. You forget how many people played into max being the next Netflix
"T=GE? Kinda looks like it. Incompetence abounds. However, you can be sure the execs will get their bonuses."
"A CNN contributor (Adeel Raja) tweeted out ""the world today needs a new Hitler"" to take out Israel. Yeah, a great network...NOT!"
I love how the stock starts moving a bit and then the negative articles start popping up . Glad I increased my position at 29
The board and all top management should be fired for this either this is a bad deal or buying time warner was.
"Just last week, Holly Frontier HFC suspended their distribution for a year in order to acquire Shell's Puget Sound refinery assets. HFC stock fell dramatically on news of the div cut, but rebounded within days after investors did the math and realized it was an excellent purchase strategy."
It is a great deal. Read the Barron’s article.The Telecom and Fiber optics business alone worth $25.88 based on similar PE like VZIs the rest of the merged entity is only worth $4? They say ‘Analysts’ don’t have a clue how to value? Based on the current Discovery valuation $17 bln for 29% the T portion is around $60 bln With 7 bln stock o/s it is valued @8.5 per share.Adding together you 25.88+ 8.50 = 34.38 per share Even if you knock off 10% it shouldn’t be lower than $31 per shareGl!
"Excerpt from news release-“AT&T's shareholders would receive stock representing 71% of the new company, while Discovery shareholders would own 29% of the new company”."
"Man, would it feel good to see this thing go past $32."
"David , Look's Like , $33.00 To $34.00 , GLTA ,"
"Make yourself CLEAR ""T"" stop messing with other people's money!"
"CRAMER says dividend will be ""RESIZED""....and rips this deal as HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!"
"Well Homegamers.....I'm Going To Sit Back For The Next Year and Collect $60,000 IN Divvys.....Think I'll Get Some Stock Appreciation,. As Well......T Is Also A GREAT Defensive Play If Market Sells OFF !"
I guess we are now entering a correction path not only for T but the entire market
Where is that A—hole CNBC Cramer now?He probably knew they were going to beat estimates and wanted to load up on shares so he bashed the stock on his show and loaded the boat.Thats the problem with these guys no accountability for the lies they spew to the public while they profit.Wall Street thievery as usual
All you dividend chases you've lost how many points since yesterday from 33 down to 29 four points that's a lot of points to lose
When the dollar is worthless oil will be priceless.
Keep in mind. The same leaders run CNN. Look at what they did the this network. They do not care about shareholder.
Just what exactly does CNN add to ATT'S bottom line?
Do the CEOs or AT&T and GE hangout together? Is their a club where Large cap CEOs hangout to make &$76tty decisions together?
Stanky....got 100 million......unreal
AT&T is up 4.92% to 33.83
"So, what is Stankey succession plan now?"
Those of you intent on focusing only on the dividend should consider my second favorite dividend stock - BCE (Bell Canada). I've been in it since November. Currently at $49.22 with a Merrill target of $54 - yielding 5.9%. Next ex-divy is June 14th. Consider also that Canada may prove less volatile than its southern neighbor due to no proposed tax changes or inflation concerns related to the stimulus funny money printing press.
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the statement by Stankey today to employees about still controlling 71% of the new company was in reference to Att having control of the board of this new company. If shareholders are actually getting shares in a new company, then T won’t be in the content business at all. Yeah they will be able to make good side deals with the new company, but revenue from this new company will not be going to Ts coffers for its telecom business. It’s not possible if shareholders get new shares in a new entity."
"OK. That sums about my personal opinion of this change. Remember, that the value of this company has not changed since the news. It just reduce the divvies. so... you make your own judgement."
TSpartan is like Boomhauer. You can't understand anything he's saying.
Will we close at $32 today. Maybe.
who bought this at above 33 today. just wondering what your reasoning was is all
Spartan55 The picture is now becoming clear That VZ is now losing customers because their earning report has said just like I told you it would . I also told you NFLX was losing customers and their earning report told you . The only thing left is to see just how many from VZ's loss and NFLX loss show as new T customers like I told you was happening. Wall Street hates T and that's ok because the smartest people in the room have built a real monster that no one company can compete with in the future.
For the first time in a year the stock is about to experience the Golden Cross.
"Selling my entire T stake tomorrow. This company without its dividend is worthless. T is going to have to do more than use the dividend cut to pay down their debt. Anyone who thinks this will turn into a growth story is delusional. Substituting Prudential as my T replacement. Good luck to those willing to ride this sinking ship, but I’m out."
T is getting strong
AT&T ($T) to merge Discovery ($DISCA) with WarnerMedia for $43 Billionhttps://woodlandreport.com/2021/05/att-to-merge-discovery-and-warnermedia-for-43-billion/
"T's management has the reverse Midas touch. They somehow manage to destroy a ""widows and orphans"" boring stock with a good dividend into a failing stock with a mediocre dividend. And they'll probably all get big bonuses an golden parachutes."
"T is trading above 52-wk high of 33.24. Yes it is pre-market, but shares are still trading at 52-wk highs."
"Way too many variables and tremendous uncertainty to know whether or not selling is overdone. It's history is any guide, most of the time the selling continues during the following days, why T is gonna be the exception. Sell this dog and buy it back bellow 25 if you haven't found by then a better place to put your money."
Is it me or does T suddenly feel like they might know what they’re doing?
"Run Forrest, run."
"Correction when this, STOCK. God help the retirees who depended on the dividend. This development most surely shorten their lives."
"""UBS analyst John Hodulik and New Street Research analyst Jonathan Chaplin agree: AT&T shares are now worth owning following a reset of priorities and a selloff after the WarnerMedia deal announcement."" And we know that these guys are really smart and their advice is good, because they are touting the value of ATT. Just like we know that anybody who doesn't agree with that is dumb and to be ignored."
Back to 40 in 2021.
When do the shareholder lawsuits start?
"Going down faster than Camel Harris...oops, that’s not politically correct, is it? (But it is factually correct)."
Well at least it looks like the bleeding stopped up 62 cents for the day
We STILL get the 7% dividend until the deal completes in another year and THEN we get free shares of the 3rd largest streaming platform behind Netflix and Disney. Not bad company to be among!So we will then have in our portfolios the 2nd largest telecom and the 3rd largest streaming service.Sign me up for this!!
All the Board members and Executive Management making the rounds on television trying to convince everyone this is a great deal. If its such a great deal let's see some massive insider buying. Let's see them put their money where their mouth is.
"If T shares go below 30 I still will not buy, no one knows what they are doing whelling and dealing !"
Nice day today. T probably moved up because of the upgrade.
NHL is coming to HBO Max per Variety.
"Smoke and mirrors, nothing happened today just a shift of debt."

"So glad I didn't listen to that fool Cramer, always do your own due diligence instead of listening to some TV shill"
"This morning I switched by cell service from AT&T to T-Mobile! Stankey and Stephenson repeatedly claimed that there was customer loyalty and little issues with switches! Given the fact that Stankey does not have shareholder loyalty, I made the switch! I encourage everyone to switch when possible. My iPhones were unlocked when purchased so that there no problems or delays were encountered."
"You guys do realize they wanted my a in New York and I told them no. Oh yes. Crossed off the List. Oh well. Boss told me later, remember that New York thing? Yes. Everyone from GTE was either fired or mis placed. Oh my, really. Yes really. Just a little funny there. Always use the excuse ""My mom is ILL"" then they feel sorry for you. OHIO Baba!! I'm going to win that Million $'s DeWine GOV is posting. Then you guys and gals can go straight to hell... ha. haaaaaa."
Did he say he made a mistake.. Stankey
Rumors say the new company to be valued at about $150B including debt. This could potentially go down as one of the best moves T has made in decades.
Have to see if this merger will be approved ?
You know you are adding value when both the buyer and seller are down! So much for $3Billion in synergy. LOL
Sold all. No div - no deal.
I'll buy a lot of shares at $18-20.
Typical Cramer NOW her likes T after CEO interview on CNBC!!
So....... The best thing that ever happened to A&T now it's another mess!?!
"Considering selling out of my FB position and buying this dip for the growth potential of the new company, with the added bonus of adding to my T position. Thoughts?"
"In the long run (3+ years) this merger will be a positive for ATT stock. Shorter term, it casts a cloud of uncertainty over the shares and the market hates uncertainty..."
I response to “ who cares what I do “ fully retired at 43 and richer at 52 now . I care what I do and give every day to someone in need
My firm bought this around 26And obviously locked in profits. This is going down maybe like GE or WorldCom
Help. Will someone please share a compelling business model of what innovative solutions and competitive differentiators T will offer?
$60 price target is cheap.
"Finally, buyers are beginning to see the wisdom of this deal. Cramer has no credibility in my view. He just ignores that T shareholders will get 71% of the new company."
"Unclear... I have a few questions. 1) When is the dividend cut??? now or many quarters from now? 2) What day will be used for AT&T to look at your share count to figure out how many shares you should get of the new company? 3) Is this automatic for people who have shares in Fidelity, TDameritrade, or ETRADE???"
Open interest for the $30 strike call expiring today is 64.6m contracts. I fear the big boys will hold to <$30 at the closing but we'll see. It should be interesting if enough buyers come in this afternoon to push it above $30 at the close
Sold all my shares was in it for the steady dividend will be looking for a new aristocrat !
"T will go down to 25, then back to 35 with a new class of investors......but you'll get half the dividend. doh! Smart money already exited on the bounce."
Morgan Stanley thinks the yield goes to 3.5%
What's the big deal? $29.60 - right around the price it always settles down at - for years now. Closed at $29.89 on April 20th - less than 1 month ago. Yes a big div cut but shares of the new company offset that.
Maybe CNN will become a real news channel again.
"Elliot Management's statement on the AT&T $T and Discovery $DISCA news from today""today's announcement represents another impressive step in the Company's recent evolution. AT&T has now executed on its promise to streamline operations and re-focus on its core businesses"""
"US News, Jeff Reeves, Thursday, April, 15, 2021, at 1:26pm. 7 Dividend Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever. # 1 AT&T, Lets face it AT&T is the Top wireless provider in the US with more than 40% market share of wireless Subscriptions and its not going anywhere, Go read the Article."
I'll be looking to repurchase some shares below $25.
"Without warner media, AT&T is just another wireless company....T-mobile & Verizon are the leaders there."
"Verizon stock has been going up since they decided to sell Yahoo & AOL. Having the right content matters. HBO Max blows away the competition, yet all the analysts talk about is Netflix & Disney+. C'mon Stankey - keep pushing HBO Max."
You will get a stock with valuation similar to NFLX (222B) if not higher.. In addition to your AT&T stock.
"Have to keep reminding myself, bond proxy not growth stock."
"TSee my comment below and then my reply to the comment showing the math. Whatever the new entity is priced at when the deal closes, T will be reduced by that amount. $ 7.50 is what the bean counters are thinking, so that's a huge decrease. There's not a single reason to to cut and run right now. I've never shorted a stock in my life and wanted to buy back in, but am holding off for now because this Spinoff stuff is not my thing and I can't invest money when I'm not clear on the details."
"This is a dividend player. Just collect. Eventually, we will get some appreciation. T is better than bonds."
AT&T with the highest growth of new subscribers!  BOOM!
"I like to these message boards very much and have been long AT&T for quite a number of years. Every time, .....every time most of you say the same thing... 95 percent of the time it’s better to do the opposite.￼"
"So that sales growth compared to the original business, looking nice..and its a 5G play also..."
Anyone know what the share conversion will be ?
You guys just don't get. You make more money if you don't hold for the dividend. You got 52 cents. But you could have sold yesterday and bought it back today and gotten over 90 cents back.
"While it looks bad now, fear not, brave shareholders! This transaction splits the value part of the company (the dividend part, in this case the wireless operations) away from the growth part of the company (the capital gains part, in this case, the media operations). Each shareholder can decide what is better. If you want the dividends, when you get issued stock in the spinoff, sell it, and buy more T. Your dividend will probably look fairly similar (not in percent, but in dollars). If you want the growth, sell the T and buy the spinoff. The original strategy of holding value and growth in the same company was a flawed strategy. Value and growth in the same company is typically undervalued by the market because the company lacks a clear focus. This transaction corrects the error. Onward and upward!"
How much will Stankey earn this year alone? 27 million?
GE
Amazon is pursuing MGM. Thde battle for content continues.
bought 1000 more common shares at $28.98 that's now 104K......where's little tiny cheeto puff?.....spartan 00....patty?......check back with me in september
If someone said you can buy AT&T stock today for $16 or $17 a share and still get a 7.5% dividend would you buy the stock? That is what I see because the potential value of the new spinoff stock is about $15 a share.
Why would the stock go down today. The deal will be consummated in one year. In the meantime T is still continuing its .52 a share. Those who own the shares will automatically get shares in the new company. IMO everything should stay the same till the day before the deal goes into effect next year. Then a T drop is justified.
Under $29 Tuesday morning?
Anyone know what date will they decide the number of ATT shares you hold to give you shares in the new DISC+ATT company? I want to buy some T to get shares in the new venture that's why I'd like to know the cut off date.
"This company is dead. I had it for a long time, got out late last year and never again. Anyone that has CNN as a news channel needs to be sold of and/or burned. Today I went and transferred my last cell line from AT&T to T-Mobil."
"What's John Legere doing?? T would pop two bucks just on the announcement if they replaced Stankey w/ him. ps. many may not know, he worked at T yrs ago."
"Att was always considered a dividend aristocrat for decades. Obviously ""absurd"" failed history."
Now the trip back to $28 to reinvest my dividend payment......
"Does everyone understand that you will receive a special dividend in the form of the new company shares. I think it will be $10/share. That is 5 years of dividends. After the special dividend, T stock will drop by the same amount (maybe to $20), but you own 2 stocks worth $30. You didn't lose anything. One has a dividend of 5% (T will have a dividend of 5% at $20) and the other is a streaming stock with a current PE of 10. I like the idea of HBO away from T with a multiple of 10. Most would buy that stock."
"The 8K says they will pay out about 40-44% of 20B in cash flow. Guys, that means a cut of around half. It's right there in the 8k and Stankey didn't have the guts to address it."
"T is ridiculously undervalued. The shorts & bears like Cramer causing real investors to sell their shares by causing fear & confusion. Read any good, detailed analysis of the deal - this is good for T shareholders!"
"Well today and latter half of yesterday was good.Back to the merger..Discovery, really Discovery channel's CEO will take over post merger? Some 2 bit basic channel outlier is equivalent to HBO or CNN?!What original content does Discovery have? I just remember Discovery for the ""nasty jobs"" series.If I was the CEO of either HBO or CNN, I would be ticked off. Doubt ATT asked for their opinion before the deal was struck...probably made in a bathroom stall over toilet tissue at some public golf course between the two ceo's."
"""This transaction creates a powerhouse media company offering investors pure play exposure to best-in-class content assets,"" said Bank of America media analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich. ""We estimate the new Discovery/WarnerMedia entity to be worth approximately $148 billion enterprise value. This attributes a 13.5x multiple to 2030E direct-to-consumer operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) discounted back and a 7.0x multiple on CY22E legacy OIBDA. When applying Discovery's 29% stake, this equates to an implied Discovery share price range of $39-42/share.""Hmm... if this is a good deal for Discovery shareholders at 29% interest, it would seem T shareholders would benefit, too. Or, do all T shareholders just think about the dividend and not share value? Maybe shareholders should buy a REIT or bond. I like the deal for both Discovery and T shareholders. It makes sense."
Lololol where are those weak humans waiting for $25 and $20?!
"Cramer,Read this and explains why you are not misleading people:“John Stankey in Barrons interview quotes, ""In terms of how it’s worked out, the enterprise value [of the Time Warner acquisition] in 2018 was about $100 billion. Now there’s $43 billion of cash coming back to AT&T, and the WarnerMedia equity value at the time that we announced the transaction was in the $58 billion range. Plus, we took probably $16 billion of cash out of the media business in the past three years and sold about $5 billion of assets. So, that’s well over the roughly $100 billion that we paid.”"
I remember the AT&T CEO on CNBC couple of weeks ago claiming how secure the dividend was. Now this. I can't trust AT&T anymore hence I'm out of here. Very cunning leadership. Many growth stocks that I can invest my $. Will not sit around hoping and praying for AT&T to turn into a growth stock.
Cramers full of if causing sell after hours because he says T will have to cut dividend by 50%
FCF will increase and %payout will increase. If that fails and dividend is cut by 50%. If share price drops to $15. You simply double down and get the same amount of dividend until share price increases and dividend rises again. Have seen that and done that. Win Win.
Think how many bought close to 34 and now are under 33. Ouch. Some won big. Some lost big.
Guess Cramer was wrong
The chart on CNBC looks like a cliff in the Grand Canyon.
"I personally don't watch TV. I only care about internet, and communicatton. Getting rid of Warner is big move for me, hopefully from now on T will focus and invest in communication development and innovation. My personal Price target for T is $40."
"Looks like Q1 will beat the numbers because.Shares of AT&T Inc. gained 0.2% in premarket trading Friday, after the media and telecommunications company disclosed that it will record a $2.8 billion pension-related gain in the first quarter.(basically number shuffling but will add to EPS)"
"AT&T shareholders get $43B cash, give up 29% of warner media, and get 71% of Discovery. Seems like a good trade. What would be better is if AT&T board promised never to do another acquisition."
"AT&T will receive $43 billion (subject to adjustment) in a combination of cash, debt securities and WarnerMedia's retention of certain debt. So it is not all cash upfront folks. It will be all kinds of funny money and debt securities... Warner Media will be saddled with AT&T's debt in the end."
All we can hope for is a huge market up day tomorrow and some fake spin on how good this is so we can sell premarket. Fingers crossed.
"those who overreacted and sold are going to feel the same way as the people who overreacted sold when Pfizer decided to merge their consumers product with GSK consumer market... Together making the #2 largest OTC consumer company in the world... yes the T dividend will get cut, just like they are going to do in the Pfizer/GSK merger/spin off.. ...... However within 4-5 years the ATT divi will be back up IMHO..... And the value of the spinoff will also likely pay a dividend from the stock you receive in the new media entity..... AT&T will be in better shape because of this move... so for those of you who overreacted and sold your shares because you disagree with the choice.... good for you and that’s your right...... For those of you who were just short term holders And/or profit takers, And made some money off today news, good for you too.... but the bottom line is this...the 7% T dividend is intact for at least the next few quarter.... And beside that , if ATT was your only big dividend play in your portfolio, the you weren’t trying very hard... just saying... MLPs and a few ETF are putting ATT dividend to shame when it comes to income and gaining in value compared to T"
"Today people SOLD their T shares. The volume is 5times the normal daily volume...wow.Some many.....some many just sold off ........T's future dividend will be cut in half meansI am mover over to Verizon with better dividend and more growth potential...or TMobile for pure growth!Foe now, even Enron is a BETTER play."
What am I missing here. I thought the SEC said no more RMD Reverse Morris Trust tax mergers after the Fiasco w Frontier Comm. == Something just doesn't sound right here @AT&T. SEC should Investigate...
Morning T ~ healthy pullback on tap today . Inflation is a real problem
"Hey bears, my calls went 50% today"
I can understand doing everything possible to put the company in it's bet possible position for the future but knowingly misleading the investors by recently saying it's a priory of maintaining the dividend at current levels was unforgivable.MO has a larger dividend and a 50 year track record of paying it. My AT&T days are over!!!!!
"The transaction would seem to be the result of an analysis of future cash flows. They must have become insufficient to warrant continued ownership. While they will transfer some of the debt, much of the acquisition debt will remain with T and need to be serviced from telecom cash flows versus media assets. That means less cash for T shareholders all else being equal."
"Cheetah,Where do you see the trading channel following yesterday's announcement?I'm waiting for the selling to stop in a couple of days and then will start swing trading aggressively"
Total disaster.
"DRAGONS are coming! HBO Max, 2022! Production has started"
"I've been a long time holder of T, over 33 years. What they did cutting the dividend was the last straw for me. I sold all yesterday. They stick it to shareholders, the loyal ones who have stuck it through mistake after mistake. Every proxy vote, I go against the board recommendations. why? because while they burn their shareholders, the board never takes a pay cut. They never give up a dime. We are not all in this together, they make the profit off shareholders backs. Too many shares, too much debt. Too many stupid decisions. Invest in a company that can show a profit and increase share price."
You buy one and then get one powerful media company (70%) free..
WOW ! Almost A $4 HAIRCUT FROMPre Market ToAFTER Hours !
"It may be a good buy at near 10 but now its a good bye. Customer service is bad. Debt is supper high no future. I will wait till they pay down the debt, Maybe they could sell off D TV . To political. Companies that focus on politics instead of there business are getting trashed. 158 Billion in debt not to mention the other liabilities."
Possible new 52 week high? Congratulations
Green 2 days in a row.Amazing and pretty nice.GLTA 
HAPPY DAY!
"people are going to start to realize pretty soon that T shares are the way to get in early and cheap on the IPO of a first of its kind, the most powerful force in media and best of all being a pure play on content with delivery, this newco is gonna be worth more than T is now, NFLX is valued the same as T, so just think about that and what NFLX has going for it and offers compared to newco!T shares are a steal, this deal benefits the shareholders more than anyone, reduces T's debt as well as become focused and get valued like Verizon or better, Verizon dividend is like 4%, then we get almost like a double through this deal"
"Been in T since 1981, adding shares + dividend reinvesting over the last 38 years. My wife and I are now comfortably retired, receiving a $28,750 quarterly dividend with a nice legacy in place for our children. Slow and steady was the recipe. Blessed and thankful."
"The price dropped yesterday after investors realized that the dividend is going to be cut almost in half. Many shareholders hold the company for the dividend. Hopefully, when the deal gets done (2022) the new enntity to be spun off will produce growth and capital gains for the shareholders."
TOLD YA. T would close in the green.
"I know we've already beaten cramer up pretty good. But check out the following comments on the heels of T's announced decision to try to acquire TWX in 2017: (note that 1&2 are within mos of each other, and then note the last one in light of his present day ""this was the dumbest transaciton ever)AT&T would likely be “a pitiful, helpless giant” without its $85 billion merger with Time Warner, CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Thursday.“But [in] either case, AT&T represents a bedrock institution that has a lot of cash flow. I’ve been recommending it. It’s got a 5 percent yield. I think it can go higher.”“I want the deal to go through because I think the combined companies would be terrific, but I’m not against it, particularly for income,” Cramer said.I guess this guy doesn't do anything criminal, but he certainly is unethical, leading investors down one path one day, then reversing course immediately after. It's like a full time job tracking his hypocrisy and contradictions."
"Forget Cramer. He doesn't like T because he invests in Verizon. As long as the dividend remains, it's a winner."
unfortunately the air waves are now owned by the advertisers which about 4 or 5 owners. That is the one big main reason you don't always hear the truth on the news.
It will retest lows of $26.5. not sure if the support will hold. Otherwise it will sink to low 20s. Too many bagholders were left with a stock that will pay 3%/year and has a big pile of debt and super awful deals in the past
Afternoon T ~ haven’t dabbled in cryptocurrency just not my style . Markets are overpriced and will continue to be volatile. CVS is going higher and of course dish . Hot salmon salad and homage tapioca pudding. Hope all is well in this craze environment
Isn't T heavily shorted? I guess no luck for a short squeeze in T but overall hanging in there today.
only took trumptards 5 yrs to figure out they have been conned.#stayinschool
HBO max is expanding to South America and Europe in the second half of the year apparently. This seems like a huge deal with massive upside. Is this priced and factored in? Seems like a lot of potential in this part of the company alone? Great library and content and will apparently fund local/country specific content too. Is the debt the main thing holding the price down?
Averaging down to below $30 to 29.xx I know it will get up to that at least one day. Then I’m ok to sit on it for however long it takes collect div and sell covered calls in perpetuity. Make 10% per annum is ok with me even if my principle is locked up in bag holder ville
Let's see..another day...markets up - check. T-Mobile up -check. VZ up - check. T - down - check.
I will buy back at $28 or lower
So who is short this stock?
"Time to look for yield. The average diversified bond portfolio will yield 1.3% per year over the next 4 years. If AT&T’s payout is safe, the stock is going to $46. :-)"
"Smart money are beginning to take profits from banks incrementally, following banks and oil in recovery telecoms are one of the next in line :) I’ll be looking forward to next week to see if we start to break out of the range. Happy hunger games"
After the spin off T will be a lean mean awesomeness providing machine?
is the interest rates going up???
Max at 57 million and climbing keep climbing... this is eventual 5G revenue are growth engine. We will have roughly 14B new debt for spectrum which sucks but needed. Hopi g the reach a deal to sell satellite division (yes huge loss but that is a sunk cost).
Going long...
Time to rotate into the value stocks...all of them..not just T....
"Dark Winter coming for T=Trash, Decade Old Crash, Mountain of Debts, Old School you name it. Will be lucky to close above $20 by end of 2021."
Announcing the sale of Direct TV would push this stock 5 points immediately.The current ratio is now .80 which means the dividend rate is now tenuous.Telephone is extending labor contracts now hoping things will change in the meantime.Telephone's dividend is not a given anymore.
March 19th will be the most watched trial since OJ Simpson...AT&T should have the law on its side.
How dare these state governors keep these business closed or limited in numbers. They love the power and should be recalled / voted out ASAP.
"All the shorts and T haters are the same thing and boy they have been trying and crying today to get T lower and it just will not go LOL,LOL,LOL"
Don't worry once the next earnings report comes out it will show T has been taking customers away from VZ and T mobile and T will rocket higher as both TMUS and VZ have massive drops
"wonder how far down we will be after today,yea big red"
FED printing press will go into overdrive once the S&P hits 10%. Bond yields rising will be cut short by the FED buying up excess bonds (yield curve control in latin).
"T is a real Value Stock, losing 29% of its value in 5 years...., so after dividend it is approximately 1% annual gain. Even T-bills do better, with lower risk."

"Dividend growth investors were just told by Sankey that they dividend won't be grown any further until 2025 at the earliest.Put your money in MO. They are going from $ 3.44 to around $ 3.66 in July, all on PROFITS."
"T stock is in a long term downward move.Will bottom hopefully Late March.Target price for T stock is $17/share.Suffering from fierce competition, heavy debt and declining fundamentals that are apt to become worse in 2021."
"in 1914, ATT was a $121 stock, with an 8% div yield"
"The other day, when I first started to post on this board, it was difficult to find any worthwhile information as the board was filled with political nonsense. But thanks to the efforts of our real investors on this board, people who more concerned with making money then bashing others or spreading loony conspiracy theories, the political #$%$ has been reduced allowing pertinent information a little easier to find. Many thanks to those with the courage to do the right thing by deleting the hate filled post. And of course thanks to all the others who have taken the time to share their knowledge about T which adds value to this board. I don?t have all the answers and I don?t know all there is to know about T. That is why I am here. To learn from you and to contribute if I can. I see this board as our office. It?s the place where we do business. That?s why it?s important that we keep this site professional and save personal and political comments for another location. Our goal should be to help each other to make money or, at the very least, avoid losing money. Otherwise, why are we here?"
It is probably just about that time when the shorts start posting questions about the dividend being safe or not.Every quarter same thing over and over again
hyperinflation! now what!!silver and gold hedge? long oil?
Show your dividend gains people. Let’s see some examples
T at decades low and the CEO says nothing...
Sold premarket! Nice gain people. Wait for it to drop back to $28’s to buy again. Rinse and repeat.
"AT&T preferred shares an option? Pays nearly 5%. If they cut the common share dividend, the preferreds would be safe. Seems like the way to play T if you are in it for income."
What would T stock price be worth if they break up the Company into a telecom and an entertainment Company? How much value would be potentially realized from the spin off idea? Thanks
"Bunny Ears and Blu Rays are the wave of the future with streaming services price hikes. Look 3, 10, 15 increases will send customers clipping the cords and moving back to home grown Blu Ray collections and free over the air wave tv."
Nice stock right here lol.
long term the business looks good to me. Buying a little more as I am a small fish but refuse to gamble on #$%$ like btc or gms.
Good luck trying to steal customers from all the other cell carriers after you choose to take sides today. I will not give any of comcast any business ever again
Making money with T...preferred. lol
I think we'll close above $28.50 but below $29 today. Most of the Calls that expire today are the $29's and higher.
"T is trading smack in the middle of its 52 week range. It pays a great dividend and will see price growth as it broadens its revenue stream out of its 5G investments. When this monster starts to run, there will not be enough negative comments on these message boards to hold it back. At that moment, you will say, I let another great one get away. This is great opportunity to get paid great returns while positioning your investment in an under valuated stock with great ROI and price appreciation potential. There are sooo many horrible investments out there that I would never buy. This is not one of them! If it runs to 50 that is over 70%. Also, I'm bullish on energy."

T probably made the best of the situation with DTV. It is a tough decision. We will now see how it does in the next ER.
Nice breakout on heavy volume. Clear path to 32. Safe haven in this tech wreck.
"Friday, everyone was panicking about bond yields. The FED stepped in today and everyone is happy again. The FED runs the whole PONZI show. Inflation will be Fixed LOW and bond yields will be kept LOW. This will remain true for the forseeable future."
"Are you kidding me?? T beats on all metrics. HBO Max has close to 50M subs - thats there 2025 target! And, the stock gets sold off. We need more Bull-side analysts speak up, and leadership to have the courage to talk up the share price. Enough is enough."
"message board poster ""cheetah"" ""cheetah 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"" are all fraudsreport abuse and check off ""does not belong here""keep this kind of trash off the ATT message board same as the GE message board did to ""cheetah"""
"Washington, D.C. attorney general sues AT&T, alleging overchargesGee! And ATT so much wanted Democratic control of everything?Be careful what you wish for ATT."
This is pure manipulation apparently surrounding the 29 put/call.
ATT will go bankrupt soon. Future is $TMUS
Nice Jump.
Long term holders are not worried one bit of either decision.
"LOL,LOLSpartan55 and all the T haters get to SAY OH NO up T goes as T is now higher than it was last Friday LOL,LOL,LOL"
https://nypost.com/2018/12/06/justice-department-not-happy-after-att-time-warner-hearing/This article details why the doj appeal of at&t tw merger is not likely to be overturned...this should give investors confidence...

So all the T haters get ready to SAY OH NO up T goes , LOL,LOL just wait when the next earning report comes out . T is now Taking customers away from T Mobile just not as fast as VZ is now driving away LOL,LOL,LOL"
Management just will not allow SP to move higher.They have sandbagged the great Q4 results with low forward guidance.And they will get a bonus for that!
What are TSHAREHOLDERS ?BAGGIES !
YOU SEE T IS going down. profit taking is showing signs of weakness. fair value for T is 25 dollar per shareT is overpriced!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I read all the post and see 1 thing, that we are all in different boats, young investors looking for value, wrong stock for that, and long term like myself, over 23 years, around 21K shares, long time now paying off. I don't care if T stay's at 30 Bucks forever, that means it pays the Div. and Recoups it every quarter, 11K cash a Quarter, 44K a year, CASH, Roth IRA, Tax Free. Key, keep the Div. and Recouping It. Easy for Me to say, start now and Reap the benefits later, Its up to You, Plenty of other stocks for value, This is all about the dividend."
I bought 1000 at 28.11 and every quarter since then I have collected 7.4%. Sorry if I can't feel bad about that.
time to buy before it goes back to $38.
Drumpfs legal challenges.
"of the 4 major telecoms VZ, TMUS, and sprint can be considered as more purebred telecoms. by that i mean their source of income is derived primarily from the telecommunications industry. with the closing of the merger ATT is morphing into more of an ""internet of things"" company. 30% of its revenue and earnings now derive from the merged partner time warner and that % should increase even further as ATT competes in the ad space market with facebook and google. ad space on the internet and premium content both have far better growth prospects than the traditional telecom industry whose growth is pretty much limited to the population growth rate the result will be a stock that is 70% cash cow and 30% growth stock.....perhaps moving to a 60/40 ratio eventually. i think the reason some big investors want to get out of ATT is because it is now a one of a kind stock and not a pure representative of the telecom industry. it just doesnt fit into their spreadsheet even though they did the right thing with the merger. if you have money you have to spend it....put it to work. if ATT can draw down debt, realize synergies and expand access into its new high profit margin markets its a 50 dollar stock. easy."
The market rally’s to all time highs and poor old T can’t even get a bid. Terrible waste of investment opportunity
good buy for someone looking for retirement income
T is like the guy that's permanently benched and never gets to play...because he dropped the ball too many times.
"As Lt Bill Kilgore said: "" I love the smell of SHORTS burning in the morning""!"
"I see ANDY deleted his post talking about BP again, probably didn't like my response. But guess what. I copied it so here it is again. LOL LOL@ANDY Hey, thanks for warning me about the dividend last August. I took another look right after you said that and decided to sell. Took a nice $20,400 profit from that one and sold it exactly at the right time. Oh glory days. The only thing I should have done was to buy it back when it dropped down to $15 again. If I'd have done that, I would have banked another 40% profit by now! Appreciate the help ANDY, now go crawl back under your rock again! LOL LOL"
Also note last time T crawled near 40 Cramer didn’t call it a buy until ~ 38
"Buying , Buying , Buying keep them doggies buying , Better look if you sold calls against your shares , because we will be taking shares before the dividend more and more everyday. Look out on Monday there will be a flood of new money into T"

Dividend to ZERO = stock to 50+ in 5 years. Only people who wont be around in 5 years would rather have 10 bucks in divy instead of 25+ in share price.

"1700 more shares at 29.72, what the heck."
"“AT&T is far better off with higher leverage and more spectrum than the reverse. It would have been a colossal mistake to underspend in this auction. None of the carriers can do without 3 GHz spectrum.”Recon Analytics principal Roger Entner said that if AT&T needed to incur more debt, “now is the time to go into debt, especially for spectrum they really need and with interest rates so ridiculously low.”Entner said that based on disclosures in its most recent earnings call, AT&T’s entire debt portfolio is currently subject to interest of around 4%, after the company refinanced a lot of its debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates. He also thinks AT&T might turn its Bank of America loan into a bond sometime during 2021. “This is like a bridge loan,” said Enter. “I wouldn’t be surprised if AT&T turned this $14.7 billion loan into a 30-year note.”""https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-secures-14-7b-loan-probably-for-c-band"""

The wife wanted to rent wonder women here in Canada they wanted to charge $30 fin dollars can you honestly believe that .Also should I not get a discount for being a long term T bag holder
I’m new to T. Can someone tell me when they pay dividends?
"Crossing my fingers here but T seems to be highly controlled by it's options. Think, as in the past, it will close @ 29 making the 29 option expire worthless. What do you think?"
Closed .14 off day's high. Not bad considering.
THE ATT DISHWASHER REPORT...IT WAS MY GREAT PLEASURE DOWN ARROWING MANY OF YOU. BEWARE YOU MAY BE NEXT. 10 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER. T IS DOOMED LEFTIES. THANK YOU.

All these RINOs in the GOP will be looking for jobs at CNN. None of them are going to get re-elected. Will never forget
LUMN was up 25% today. I could not find any news to justify the move. I know this is a different forum but I wonder if anyone has any info.
Finally got out of T at the high of the day. Now to find a stock to reinvest this cash in. Maybe a cruise company. They will have nice upside once the travelers hit the high seas.But the T is History. RUFF RUFF!
"For Anonymous's benefit I'm going to try copying and pasting information from the conference. Let's hope they don't delete my post. NO GROWTH in 2021! Here it is:2021 guidance unchanged. AT&T’s 2021 financial guidance, announced in January 2021, is unchanged on a comparative basis. For the full year, the company continues to expect: Consolidated revenue growth in the 1% range Adjusted EPS to be stable with 2020 Gross capital investment in the $21 billion range, with capital expenditures in the $18 billion range 2021 free cash flow in the $26 billion range, with a full-year total dividend payout ratio in the high 50’s% range."

Definitely looks like $25 or below is coming next.
"G was Zappoed by my friend Chettah, I like Zappo better then Mute."
Fun fact: You can make quite good returns on T by buying below 29$ and before Ex Div Date and selling above 29$ and collecting Div. Because this thing is not going anywhere above 30$ soon with that debt. Just sayin'.
"Hanging in with what I have, and collecting the dividend. Maintain a little patience."

"AT&T is not for trading.. please, if you have to manage trading AT&T because of divvy date. You should not even considering the stock...I think long term wise, T stock will go up.."
I’m glad to see AT&T is back to normal trading at a loss every day again.
Red in a sea of green. nflx up huge
T announced a delay of their Hogwarts Legacy video game until 2022. Any comments? Does that mean anything to anyone? Does anyone care?
Wow! Almost 41m shares traded. Wow!
Some stock we have here lol.
HBO Max ad during NFC championship game looked good. If I didn’t have Max already I’d be signing up.
Gotta short Quantum!! look at the value with a 4 yr wait for a battery??
Whats the difference between $30 Trillion and $40 Trillion debt. I don't think it matters at this point. May as well increase the debt by $10 Trillion and make everyone happy.

@VZ I think I officially drove your guy @R crazy... oh well we'll see your call on Friday then Mar 12. Questions I would ask 1. Who pulled the trigger on Tom&Jerry Jason Killar? 2. Plan for 5G Spectrum since you got the Brunt. 3. What about share buybacks 4. Layed off 1000 workers from WarnerMedia are they coming back? 5. What about pepe' le pew that's been since 1945. 6. Who's pinning the stock @ 29
"If you are long T just make sure you place long term sell orders for all your shares a good place to start is over $60 but any higher price you want for your shares if ok , What it does is send a message to Wall Street they are not going to get any shares cheap and the more long term sell orders there are the higher T will go , Why because sooner or later you find people that have had their shares lent out to be shorted and their broker either has to find shares for them or recall the shares that have been shorted So place them long term sell orders and sit back collect the dividend and watch T go higher and higher . Have to wait a year to get long term capital gains away ."
"Hope you guys bought the dip. I know I did. Closing in on 1,500 shares :)"
Some stock we have right here lol.
"Direct TV is awesome! I don't understand why anyone would put it down. It's way better than cable and now We have HBO Max which is significantly better in my opinion than Netflix or Disney. Direct TV rocks it and HBO Max is by far the best. AT&T phone service wireless is very good too, in fact, why do my friends with T-mobile get no signal with T-mobile and have to borrow my AT&T phone to make a call or data on our camping road trips...Facts."
By the end of the year the market will be down at least 30 percent from here
"Never seen a more Hopeless stock than T, Even GE goes up quite alot recently. T just straight down south without any struggles."
Remember T will be fine and you don't want to sell for a year for capital gains anyway They may sell the news on T because of the massive write off T is going to have to take again . Just make sure you have some cash to get more always plan ahead
"Indeed T is the worst dog out of big caps with enormous amount of debts, not to mention it's getting too old in the teeth."
Where are the Activists? Why arent the Activists calling for replacing Board members? This stock should be selling at $40 based on any metric. Criminally undervalued. C'mon now!
why is this dropping on a 500 point up day
"To all the T haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL Why because T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades"
This is like revenge of darth ...becz it stayed less then 30 for so long ..lot of folks shorted 30. This move is non trivial..35 here it comes in a flash.
"Finally, AT&T stock itself trades at a low PE ratio. Also, due to expectations surrounding the stock, the company will likely increase the dividend soon despite its generous yield. In short, a perfect storm is forming with T stock, and it appears positioned to rain growth and dividends on new investors."
how is c n n reporting on the cuomo disaster? do they even mention it?
New DirectTV entity should get DISH valuation.
What is he talking about? Hey man.
Only T could close @ $ 29.99.
If you have not gotten your shares just make sure you pick some up on ny pull backs and lock them up with long term sell orders over $60 to start. T goes ex dividend the week of April 5-9 2021 and you want to lock in the dividend before the ex dividend date
"We learned 3 major things over the last 10 days , Is the power grid can not take any more electric cars at all we still have 13 states without power from a little storm that could not charge them at all , Just think if all the police , fire were all electric how screw up the DEM wits plan would be. We also learned how to kill off DEM wits just turn the power off and they will kill themselves and the 3rd is what a very big mistake Joe did by stopping all drilling and cancelling the pipeline. Because in the future you still need oil , The best plan is to plant trillions of new trees to replace the one that where cut down and causing the climate change and to fix the power grid so it can handle more electric cars , But also make sure we still have oil in our future because it will always be needed"

Why is Moscow Mitch holding up $2000 checks anyone know? Its not like he is worried about the deficit or anything. Its just MEAN.
"T is in the hands of arbitrage investors and short sellers. Will calm down in a week or two and will move up. T will grow into a very attractive growth plus income stock, IMHO."
Getting worried about this stock. Not moving when market is recovered. Street not confident with dividend?
"LOL,LOL,LOL All the T haters get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
Blowout employment number means US economy is strong and will keep humming in 2019. This means T will easily make the $ needed to pay debt and dividend and that we will likely see another increase in the dividend for 2020.

Why do people listen to Powell to worry less about Inflation. Inflation is FIXED. It will stay fixed regardless of the prices of things.
Why Bitcoin will keep going up. They don't make many more Bitcoin. Simple Supply/Demand rules.
I don't own at&t but have been looking for yield but not sure if the dividend is safe and the chart is not looking good
Powell will say Inflation is under control. Doesn't matter that prices are up everywhere and will continue to go up. Inflation as measured by the PCE deflator is controlled.
Exactly like I said rallies in the morning especially short the stock and they bring it right back down to cover every single day and it closes in the red at a loss
"Back in the $28s.This is a real plot twist, didn’t see this coming,"
I bought 1000 shares this morning @ 31.87.6.3% yield. Nice.
Why the move today? do you think some firm will come out with a good report? or maybe they purchased some good airways for 5G.
Mike muted!
Only up because of defense against market drop.
AT&TTotally exposed now that Ex-Dividend day has come and gone. 27-29.50 for the next 3 months.
"The telecommunications giant landed on Wall Street’s “Naughty List” in 2015 after its $49.5 billion acquisition of struggling satellite TV provider DirecTV.Three years later, AT&T added CNN parent Time Warner for $85.4 billion along with the famed Warner Bros. film and TV studio and cable networks such as HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT. CEO Randall Stephenson made big promises after both deals that failed to come true. As a result of the transactions, AT&T amassed $152.9 billion in debt, the most of any company in the world, which continues to weigh down the company’s stock price."
"not much interest in this stock, 0% after hours"
"Here it is, all laid out for you: Why AT&T is a $60 stock and how it will get there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE-JLzOyV9o"
Emphasis by Kilar about ad supported HBO Max is a good catalyst. Lowered price for the masses to dramatically increase base and subbing the revenue with ads unlike the cheap sludge by Disney.Good Move.
What’s T’s latest bid in the auction?
got another 100 in AH. Thanks for the cheap shares.
Imagine missing the biggest bull market in history stuck in T for the Div while its share price does nothing for a decade LOL. Its like waiting behind the old folks at 7-11 trying to pick the right scratch ticket when you just want to get your drink and go. Do old people hate money?
What about them being in trouble with the SEC? Anyone concerned on Monday?
"what is the purpose in telling strangers how many shares you have or how many thousands your dividends are , i only talk to my wife about it on rare occasions"

"although I keep T for the dividends, I am still happen to see a green day."
BULLISH ! ! The hbo originals line up for this summer and fall is gonna drive subscriptions. Taking profits from other trades and putting into this blessing. Divy over the next 2 qtrs pays for my patience! BULLISH
"The 5G auction has surpassed 80 billion $ and , in my opinion, way over priced. T-Mobile, VZ, T, and others, will go further in debt just to acquire more 5G, mostly mid band. Not sure is worth it although every competitor lusts for more 5G. Forget about low band 5G, not much faster than 4G. May this this is why T did not increase the dividend in Jan 2021....need cash for the auction. Will consumers pay much higher prices to get 5G service ? Not sure. Regardless, winner in all this are the Feds selling the 5G airwaves at auction."
T 50 day moving avg is about 32.12 and the 200 day is about 34.60. Now as time goes on here the 50 day may climb above 200. This is the beloved golden cross where big volume will come in to the upside. All procrastinations will then be put aside.

"If you are not buying T here, hand-over-fist, you really do not understand how to invest. You buy a BlueChip like T with incredible/systematic and subscription businesses and market opportunities like crazy. You don't whine and complain or complain about a low stock price. Many people who are negative on T shouldnot even be investing in the market. One can easily discern that they are not qualified to be investing."
"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. is making good on its promise to tackle its $171 billion debt load.The telecom carrier is refinancing outstanding debt by selling senior unsecured bonds in as many as two parts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the offering, a 20-year security, may yield around 2.375 percentage points above Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private."

"Market has been good of late, however T has not been participating. I guess until some really good news is released, that's gonna be our fate for the time being. One thing that assuredly should give the pps a boost is announcing the sale of Direct TV. It's a loser; ain't ever gonna be a winner and has been a drag on earnings ever since the ill-conceived move to buy it. JMHO, but T should take whatever it can get for Direct TV and just move on. Still hoping movie and TV production can get back to normal, and soon. Unlike Direct TV, slowdowns in both of these areas is solely due to COVID-19 safety concerns which will eventually be gone. Keep the faith. Ain't gonna be kissing $40 any time soon, but a 10%-15% rise to $30+ should be doable. GLTA."
Market will be up Monday. No way they dont sign an agreement. Plus great dividend and growth now with hbo
"I give up, why."
T had to write down DTV value ahead of a sale. Thing is when the deal is finally done there will most likely be another mark-to-market loss. They knew a long ago they were carrying trash on the books at an inflated price. They also know Warner Media isn’t worth its current book value. An honest mark-to-market reckoning would likely reduce T’s book value to the point that rating agencies would downgrade this load to JUNK.
What would be neat is if the Govt forgave all credit card debt. Its about $1 Trillion much less than Student loan debt.
You think T management would at least try to make CNN profitable. Nope! Same management same horrible results.
"Churchill looks like they might be teaching a deal on directv according to speaking alpha , yes the purchase by t has been a disaster but going forward we need to get something from it. I am more concerned w sky high spectrum action now eat to be at 70B ... still believe in T and long but ouch"

Hard to ignore this div rate.
glad i covered my short position last week.
Rodgers is a choker like John Ellway and Peyton Manning.
I am slowly exiting my position. Left organization with a lying media
"Two questions, one based on the other:1. I always thought that beta is a measurement of price volatility, and if the beta is below 1 that means the price moves below the market...yes/no? 2. If a person is looking to short a stock, wouldn’t they be looking for a higher beta stock than T?I’m a long term investor and I reinvest my dividends so I don’t mind a lower pps. I don’t have a pressing need for the money I have in T. I guess what I’m saying is I don’t understand a lot of the chatter here about pps. Not criticizing anyone, just wondering. Thanks"
"AT&TLOL, so many wanted out over 30/share. See ya in the high 20's next earnings."
Still early- but my outlook:5G + PPV (pay-per-view)=$$$ -and a solid growth path!
Everything across the board is currently down from yesterday. Ships wise and fall with the tide. Look at this as a gift.
Slim window to get a good deal. I just bought 6000 at $29.65. They should announce the dividend by the end of the month and I wouldn't be surprised to see it raised a penny or two thus sending shares up above $30.
If you have not put a sell limit order on T @ $100+ you deserve to have a hedge fund short your stock with YOUR MONEY. Protect your investment against the brokerages and short sellers. Have a great day and protect your LONG position against the shenanigans!
HBO Max with Ads coming in June. Will be less priced than Premium. These targeted Ads will make T mondo cash. This is just the start. Once T integrates its Cell phone's with targeted Ads watchout.
"AT&TLet me tell you about a real lowlife named Cheetah, who used to post as Cheetah3 until I mentioned that he was using the name of a Strip Bar in Atlanta. He then changed it. He also swore up and down that he owned T stock, but it's clear now that he was lying through his teeth. He's admitted he's 80ish years old and he is everything you would not want your son to ever be."
"Stop complaining. If you don't like T, move on."
Getting close to closing above $30. 2 mins more.
Where is the volume? 21M shares not going to get it done
When is T going to declare their dividend?
Somebody wanted in badly in the am. Accumulate
Forgive $10K of Credit card debt. That will help a few people.
"who got the better deal ?Warren Buffett during 2008 crisis, when Goldman Sachs was struggling, paid 5b$ and got 5b$ preferential stock at 10% coupon And about 3-5b$ ( or zero, if the the stock had stayed under 115$ ) worth of common stock .TPG is paying 1.8b$ for 1.8b$ pref stock at 10%coupon, 2 seats on the board of 5, and 30% of common stock in new DTV valued at 16b enterprise value ( which is low anyway you cut it when you compare to Dish )"
"LOL,LOL,LOL look at all the T haters that have egg on their face LOL They are all saying OH NO look at T going higher and higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Once every 60 days, it is green, lol."
why i oughta....
Besides the results of the 5G auction is there anything else coming up that can move the share price?
"Elliott Management initiates stake in AT&T, raises Dell and exits eBay"
"TStankey just told you plainly that growth won't occur until AT LEAST 2025. I don't see them paying out 15B per year in dividends over that period of time, which would be 75 Billion in Dividends over that time."
"Good bye AT&T TV Now. T has given up on it.Was another T media that did not work very well. Add in DTV, and T has not made media work well for them. Let’s hope HBO Max plays out well. Should know more about subscriber growth at Jan 27th earnings release. Meanwhile, T plods along. But hey, we still have the dividend. Please T, don’t screw that up."
T is the place to be atm with upcoming slowing growth in the economy
Robert MUTED!
Can someone please advise date of next dividend payment?
Been buying T since 2015 its my only losing position with 33.17 average.I get disappointed alot but then I think that this is a insurance play in my portfolio I have no doubt in my head that some day it will hit 40 may 5 10 15 year.And I also have no doubt in my heat that for the next 10 years it will be paying me a good dividend.Just letting it Drip and waiting for it to go up when I might need it more!
Is the congress kangaroo court still in session today? MORONS
The only reason Kudlow went to Fox is because CNBC said NO THANKS.
"It's a $55, possibly higher. It's a very good Dividend and Growing 5G and the Leadership Team of Streaming. I personally enjoy all of it. MY opinion Pers"
T will begin to move up towards ex-dividend date
Another unit sold. More money to pay down debt. Good moves but anyone’s guess on price they got for it
Why oh why does T never hold a good gain.T is such a disappointment and their management is forever silent. I really hope Elliott Management is back!!Go Elliott!
"People just can't get past the debt this company has even though the weighted avg rate on the debt is like 4% and most of it matures way off into the future. We're talking when most of us will be dead, 2050 and years like that. LOL"
"Peter, Not all of their debt is in bonds. A good portion of their debt is in bank loans which can be restructured, and most recently were resulting in longer tenors and lower interest rates.￼"
"Finally, Main St gets a bailout -- President Joe Biden signed a COVID-19 relief package worth nearly $1.9 trillion into law on Thursday. The legislation includes $1,400 direct payments, a $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit until September, additional money for parents, funding for a national vaccination program, and billions of dollars for state and local governments and reopening schools."
we have all lost money with ATT. dividends increased by percentage. but the dividend is not enough to payback loss of principle.
Just bought more with the divvy. Easy money.
"XOP, OIH, and XLE were this weeks top performers all > 10% . “Dirty” energy for the WIN ! "
strong sell
"they say buy on the dips, but with T every single business day it is a dip."
T is going to be up 3% afterhours and more tomorrow. Better buy now at historic prices.
One year ago it was 39.06
Nice stock right here lol
"The big dividend, everyone hates it stock buy over the past two weeks was XOM, not T.That's not to say T won't have it's day with a big analyst upgrade like XOM had. But I don't see that happening until at least after the auction."
To think this stock was more in April 2020. T is a goner. Looks dreadful.
"LOL all the T HATERS are going to start crying when T goes higher and not lower . LOL,LOL You just can not make this stuff up . LOL,LOL So get ready to say OH NO up T goes"
Wonder when they announce the 5G auction results.....I would guess some time this week.
T is looking old and getting dumped everyday for years. I'd get out and get into something with real growth instead of declining every year only find its Debt is the only thing going up.
BP is getting WHACKED today. One of Cheetah's recommendations.
"Remember I have been doing this for decades and the hardest thing to learn is patients grasshopper and Wall Street are sheep that only follow the herd to the Slaughter. For sure if you are late in the herd you are the one to be lead to the slaughter. How did that work out for the sheep to follow the GME herd LOL,LOL Slaughtered."
come on Robinhood T needs your help. most hated stock in the s&p could turn into the most loved with your help
There will be a nice trade tomorrow by buying at the low here today. Always a nice rebound the next day after a panic sell like today.
You just KNEW the JO's would push below 29
OH MY !SELL In EARLY Pre MKTPRIOR To EARNINGS !
"Warner assets being underestimated, HBO Max is the Cadillac of streaming while Turner Sports/Bleacher Report are the only content players other than ESPN in the most explosive new industry of legalized sports betting"
"Judas and the Black Messiah...A grand slam for HBO Max! A tad bit hard to follow, but the best premiere so far this year."
Leftard Phil is happy his T investments is up by another penny. Keep pumping it Phil.
Agree with Bob - 50 % of the people on the other side
"I told you bottom 28.40 , I’ve profited mega today. Keep holding while T outperforms the whole market"
"Look on the bright side, still up 27 cents from yesterday. (Looking at you Red Equal aka Debbie Downer)"
We were green pre-market for awhile...now red.
On a positive note: your portfolio cannot only have winners. You need a laggard like T too to be grateful to your winners even more.
"I did bet on Brady but I would have like to have seen what the game would have looked like with a healthy Mahomes and at least a 2nd or 3rd string offensive line after losing all their starters. As it was, the Chiefs were playing with an offensive line comprised of 2 undrafted free agents, 2 7th round picks, a guy picked up on waivers after no one else wanted him and a guy who signed at midseason after he was released by the Steelers. With a line like that, Mahomes had no choice but to run like heck all day on his injured turf to try to avoid getting killed on almost every play. It wasn't exactly an even playing field but that's life in the NFL."
let's see all the negative news. Price Target $34. over 7% dividend. HBO Max launched at all platform. Selling Dish. paying down debt. Still Cash Cow. T stock look like a winner to me
T gives me a nice 0.52 dividend then proceeds to drop by an additional 0.75. Remind me why I bought this.
"Now it seems that Democrats are trying to strong-arm ATT into dropping news channels they disagree with. In a letter to Stankey, they insisted ATT drop Fox News, OAN and NewsMax. I'm sure the Biden/Harris apologists here will scream in support. What 1st Amendment?"
check out the 3 month T chart. note the number of times bounced off 28.50. another retest coming?
"Verizon should tank far more than T today with a massive 44B increase in debt, but it's only down a percent. All these numbers are worthless and the only thing that matters is trust in management. T has none."
"I had to laugh at the post that said AT&T makes a profit of 40B a year. They are currently 190B in debt and want to borrow another 14B to buy Spectrum 5G. If you read the forward PE of T, it is around 9. I don't believe it. This stock is in a downward spiral."
T. The stanky ho of stocks
Only thing up in my portfolio right now.
We're on a winning streak let's keep it going. Cause T investors are winners !!!!!
"$T bag holders anonymous meeting in session. I’ll go first...My name is Kevin and today I’m thankful for the rest of my portfolio and how it carries my $55,000 AT&T bag. It all started very simply, just a guy looking for “high dividends”. A Motley fool article here, marketwatch article there, and before you know know it I’m $10,000 into $T at $35 (1%) of my powder. Woah! Fat dividends feel good coursing in my veins. I hardly cared that the share price was eroding, it was slow and this was a “blue chip”. It will get better. Before you know it I’m averaged down to $30 and in for $55,000 less than a year later. (Man sob crying in hands) Ok all jokes aside I’m not selling just gonna collect and wait. If you’re stuck any position $T seems to be an ok prison"
Get ready for a probable 'Beat' on Wednesday- consensus: .73 - 'whisper': .75. It was already mentioned that 'wireless was very strong' -as well as 'free cash flow' target!
VZ is raging in after hours trading
One year downtrend still intact. 20 year downtrend still intact. Elliott counter trend rally is all gone. He bailed after getting an inside sniff.
People completely lost confidence in this trash after over a decade of continuous Decline and Free Fall. T-Trash is on its way below $20.
"I don't get Tesla. I mean, they make a car. Okay, a different type of car, but basically a vehicle that takes you from one place to another. Nothing new to see there. Dunno about the rest of you, but having to wait an hour to re-charge vs. maybe five or so minutes to fill up at a gas pump is a big turn off for me. Plus, what's the range on Tesla cars, about 250-275 miles. I can drive over 400 miles on a tank of gas."
Imagine Direct TV linking up with Elon Musks satellite company for urban internet access
XOM Morgan Stanley Raises Target Price To $71 From $60
"Stephenson just plainly told you that there will be no revenue growth until at least 2025 and IF everything goes right, HBO Max will break even then.I sold at 30.57. Did you?"
at&terrible how are they still at 20 dollars this is a 8.00 stock at top You Go Puts people
I just cancelled my Netflix since it is more expensive and has worst shows than HBO. I don't see where you can find this much yield and future long term growth in HBO. T is an absolutely great long investment.
Low volume across the board today. Everyone must be watching the super boring inauguration. What I don't understand is why they have to show it on every doggone channel. I can't even watch the real Wonder Woman with Linda Carter today.
"anyone have idea is management does implement stock buyback as they are indicating will do to stock price, big bump or not much?"
T has been very good for shareholders of other specifically the target companies like Direct TV and Time Warner. About time it took care of its own shareholders.
"34,000 shares traded in about 1 minute or so in pre market"
C'mon Joe. Let's have the $12k stmulus. And the reparations. And free health care. And what about my UBI?
They could make gold from lead and it would still drop!
"big news from unnamed sources within trump's doj says that the sprint, tmobile merger will go through because america needs 5g competition. this has a lot to do with trump's personal biases and very little to do with the law once again."
Why did Elliot Mgmt. purchase T stock? Their investment this time is much smaller than before.
$T is a #$%$ up After other #$%$ up Friday being sued by the SEC today their most anticipated movie got leaked and switched instead of playing Tom&Jerry Zack Snyder Justice League played there instead i mean can't $T hire competent people?
Buying Opportunity!!
T stock going up soon. Biden say he going to give all illegals a cell phone.. this is sort of like Obama's phone. Your taxes will go up to pay for illegals: cell phones; health care; food; rent; schooling. People buying stock have a lot of money. They can afford to pay more in taxes.
"There would be many benefits to an NBCUniversal-Warner Media tie-up. For instance, A merged studio of NBCUniversal’s Universal Pictures UVV and WarnerMedia’s Warner Bros. would control 30 percent of the worldwide box office. It would also have tentpole franchises including DC Comics, Harry Potter, Fast and Furious, and Jurassic Park.The companies also would be a force in the TV business."
"What are dividend investors doing here? They shouldn't care about price swings, they should only check every 3 months to see if the money arrived."
I love it when the market is way up and T is down
Wow this company sux 
"So many salty shorts on this board, same people who have 100% of their portfolio in companies without a P/E ratio. I’d like to see a group phot of these shorts, must be a sorry looking group of people."
Target is $29. Not buying plenty of winners to chose from
Wowzers......two inside days in a row down volume pretty low..selling exhausted?
How often does the T dividend pay out? Thank you.
I thought the Government Solutions Unit was a good thing for T to have with all the money our Government puts into security. Hope they got big bucks for it.
Love the Bonuses for employees!
"The money I pulled out of T went up 4% today, may not hold. And I no longer support communist national network (CNN)."
Some stock right here lol.
Could end today at $29. Fingers crossed.
"Apparently, lawmakers are seeking information from telecoms about broadband availability to the underserved. Lawmakers might be considering an aid package to make available broadband to low-income communities. Which could also mean T might get reimbursed for delinquent payments. Just my take on this."
Lot's of sellers lined up in the low 30's.
T is going down. a lot of people are leaving direct tv and att cellpne and one of them is us . T MUST go down to 25 dollar that is the right price for T. it owes billions of dollars in banks..
Bought more on Friday for under $28. The stay at home work should benefit T. Have signed T fiber 500 Mbps rate and works well. Will accumulate slowly 300 shares at a time. Good luck longs.
"Hack dividend investors bought this and missed out on the huge gains, smh."
"Goodbye $30 my old friend. The way people were talking I thought we’d never lose you again. Lol joking, I loaded puts at 30.35 and am smiling."
Is today the day we finally hold a gain?
Sell the propaganda machine CNN to Bezo for $20B and the stock price will jump to 20%.
ATNT is very steady even when market goes down ATNT goes up it’s nuts
"The total cost per share of all my shares over the years is now 34.08. But I've received 18 divdend payments, so my cost per share is now just about $ 25.Dividends are powerful over time."
a trial or a video editing circus?? USA! we can do better! Dont let china pull ahead!
"I just paid .17 each to buy back the Feb 26 $29 Puts I previously sold for .97 each. .80 per share clear profit since Feb 2. I'll resell the Puts again, maybe a little further out, when the stock drops back again."
AT&T Declares Quarterly Dividendhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/30/business-wire-att-declares-quarterly-dividend.html
"Yes you can sell today and get the dividend , But for sure you will miss earnings and the pop higher."
yea thanks for the big push above 30
AT&T should change company name to “Under 30 for life”
"way to go T i knew you wouldnt let the green meenies get you lol. down again,whats that 9 or 10 days in a row ,i lost count"
"Buy 4000 share today price low 28.40, good buy T price after div. 28.41-.52=27.89"
"Is the market up?If NO, AT&T stock is down.If YES, AT&T stock is down."
Signaling a two year dividend freeze at the current $2.08 is not playing out well.
Todays after hours makes little sense BOB IGER ANNOUNCEd retirement dis will fall without his management skills
"Remember ""Sharpie Gate""?"
"7+% way too good to last, these shares will get back to mid 30's following earnings, bringing div back around 6%"
"WOW locked in a 7.3% dividend payer today , MAN and the FED is going to be lower for a lot longer , MAN can't beat that for good income Plus watch the Gains I get over the next 2 years LOL,LOL,LOL"
"The company reported a net loss attributable of $13.88 billion, or $1.95 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31."
"I held this turkey too long and recently closed my position. AT&T should be a winner, but unfortunately, in my opinion, is not. All it takes it to watch CNN (owned by AT&T) to see it plainly. Under AT&T ownership, CNN has degenerated from being a respected news reporting organization to its current state as a left-wing servant of the Democratic party. If AT&T management cannot insist on integrity in news reporting, I doubt it will succeed with other enterprises. Consider General Electric under Immelt."
Cramer panned T on the Lightning Round tonite.He said that there is no peace-of-mind for T shareholders.
I would like to buy some att stock because of the 7% dividend. I'll wait until cnn fires Don Lemon.
"One thing @R did get right, when he speaks of T-Monster it's more like T-Debt. Add 170 Bln to another 20 Bln for the C-band auction. This is money they don't have!?! Who's going to pay all this off. It's from your dividend increase, son... Read 'CNN Disinformation's' Post from earlier post. It took about 35 minutes of reading but you'll learn a lot. Whoever put that together was very accurate... They wanted to re-name HBO to MAX and do away w HBO, but that fell on def ears..."
What do you think is the best stock moves you can make for the next 10 years? For Me I picked up some shares of T under $31.50 today 7/19/2018 with dividend reinvestment and some GIS yesterday 7/18/2018 at $43.05 with dividend reinvestment. Let me know what stock moves you would make.
I’ll never understand why so many people come to this page to talk about how they would never buy this stock. Why are you here then? T is a good dividend stock that you can play options on at certain levels to make quick money.
Jen Psaki wears the same clothes every day. Shewww wee.
HBO Max subs should skyrocket in Q4. Commercials everywhere. Very aggressive w/content. Need to sell DTV to Dish & this stock will be at $40 before you know it.
"I remember Stephenson, after buying DirecTV, saying that 1.8X is the debt ratio AT&T needed to feel comfortable......they are now targeting 3.0X for this year as Stankey just said. That is not good, based on their very own definition."
"AT&T Is killing there stock and company. Thats how I feel. Stock is only good if you picked it up at $27 to $28 and with the great dividend. It like waiting for your spouse to change and they never do, same repetive bad behavior."
VZ you have until the next earning report before you get slaughtered better learn to sell any moves higher in VZ why you still can As VZ and the yahoo NATZI's now run off customers and mostly shareholders
Open at $24 tomorrow ...Good luck longs
"Phil I can’t see you, but I just wanted too remind you that your crystal ball  is still broken "
absolutely NO WAY HBO gets 150M subscribers...EVER
"A lot of people have been holding AT&T stock for decades; for many the foundation of their retirement. If this describes you, then by all means hold. T's dividends will pay better than any bond you might buy. For everyone else, AT&T is a classic value trap that should be avoided. I'm not going into details, but AT&T's fundamentals are quite worrisome, with the stock price slowly sinking for the last decade; I doubt this will change."
Well Homegamers.......Will Tomorrow BeTIMMMMMBER Day ?
This will be at $50 within 30 days you will see 5G is going to be huge for them
"Abolish food insecurity. Give everyone foodstamps. Instead of subsidizing farmers for not producing food, give the subsidies to the people to consume food."
i am bullish on $T but they need new management in the Warnermedia their movie studios is completely falling apart they have a good brand that can compete against $Dis/Marvel but they are running into the ground if they want money they shouldn't be buying a war with the fans I'm sorry but I am starting to see a lot of red flags on Warnermedia
"Is our CEO a mute? Does he ever communicate about the stock price & shareholder value? Just a plain embarrassment, period!"
"If someone had over 6,000 shares at an average of $29.94, and bought for the dividend...should they consider selling?"
Praise the lord above $30
"I don't think I have ever seen a blue chip company like this, whose stock is so unbelievably weak. It is like some fund out there has about a billion shares they want to sell, and it is going to take forever to do it. It has been nothing but sideways and down for a year. Will sentiment ever change for this thing,? Worst performing stock I own bar none. I know, 7% yield, got it."
"Best, thing that ever happened to, T, was movie theaters shutting down, allowed AT&T to shift to streaming their most valuable content"
Is the price going up to capture the up coming divi?
Everything flows downhill.
Sold T 7 days ago. Bought TSLA and sold this morning. Pickup T at $28.60. Got more shares and made more money. I think earnings are going to be great this quarter along with good news about selling DTV.
Buy the dip!
"TBy the way, Cheetah used to post as Cheetah3........Cheetah3 is a Strip Bar in downtown Atlanta. He's a great human being.......80ish year old man using a strip bar for a screen name. That's the quality you get here on Yayhoo."
Looking like T is going in right direction! Let’s hope HBO max will give them Good numbers! Go longs !
noticing T bulls not posting much TODAY out partying the victory of a. person unfit for office
Lots of muting today! It's a wonderful world!
Sadder. Stock price is now about 3 dollars less than it was 3 months ago. :(((
The poor saps that bought this last week will regret it this week.
"Will this stock ever get any traction, day after day underperforming the market. Pure torture"
"Remember you need DEM wits without a brain or you will never get stocks on sale and OH Boy do we have one special DEM wit without a brain in the White House now LOL,LOL,LOL"
"This board is hilarious! T is not a trading stock. You buy, hold and collect divs. It doesn’t matter if the stock trades at 20 or 40. T holders only care about how many shares we own, not the stock price. Traders and shorts will never get it. They’ll sit in front of a computer all day stressing over loosing or making a profit everyday. Longs relax, add shares and enjoy the yield."
@R Now you have Paramount+ debut on March 9 to clean your clocks bye bye R
"I switched from my expiring AT&T 300 Mbps fiber Internet to 1 GIG yesterday. My old promo rate was $50 per month. My new promo rate is $60. Since I just started my final month at the old rate, I should be billed a ""make-up"" $10 on my next bill (2 months at $60, paid as $50 and $70). Instead, my new summary of charges shows that next month will be $90 and then $60 moving forward. I called AT&T, but I couldn't convince the person in Mumbai that $90 is incorrect. Why are Americans are losing STEM jobs to H-1B visa holders???"
DEMS win the market goes up. Thats because Dems are good for the stock market. The FED will print MORE.
"I’m 15 years from retirement and have never had any bonds in my retirement account. Bought yesterday at 30.17. This is more than double the ten year bond rate. Even if it goes to 29 in the short term, I feel very comfortable in collecting my 6,7 % yield and then eve naturally selling at about 40. I also predict that this will be at 37 by year end. Recognize this stock for what it is."
Good night all. Let's see what happens tomorrow.
Is there a law that prevents T from staying above $30?
"I know how to bring this company up to $!00 per share in a snap. I sell all my ATT shares, then I use all the money to buy VZ shares. Within minutes of doing so, VZ will drop to $10/ share and ATT will zoom up 50 to 60 bucks per share!!"
Share price getting pummeled in pre market. Guess it was all about 2021 guidance of rev up 1% vs expected up 1.5%.
All bad news and no good news priced in. A purchase below $30 is a good buy any way you look at it. Will be trading at 35 to 40 in 2021.
TMobile just took a $1.60 dive in the last hour.
"The one thing you learn when you have been investing for many years is to look for companies that make changes to make the company a better company in the future . It is never about the past and always about the future and the changes the company is making to make it a better company in the future . Most have blinders on and can only see the past not the changes that are being made for the future until the stock is already up 50% and some YAHOO like Cramer is telling you to buy or sell after it's already moved 50% LOL,LOL,LOL you just can't make this stuff up . LOL,LOL, LOL"
So if I understand this since AT&T is in the wireless data business and subject to net neutrality laws they are at a disadvantage to competition like Netflix and Disney plus ? You can stream Netflix and not have it counted against data ... correct? Thanks in advance for any input
T…Any one have noticed their landline phone bill increases nearly 19+% this month? Probably management using the extra profit to partially fund the cost of 5G bidding war.
"Big movement made last week. Great volume, and new blood buying up shares of T.The rockets are lit, and the countdown has started. This baby is heading to the moon. Get on board before you miss it, and it will be your loss."
28.50 USD is ok to buy - personally I hope it can go down to 26.50 USD again (strong buy at that level)Likely lower end of the spectrum : [28.30 USD] - anything below [27.00 USD] BUYNo advice - just my opinion
So excited for more Nuclear power plants ! Clean energy for all ! What could go wrong? 
"The highly anticipated pre exdividend run up has fizzled out.As usual, T can't hold any gains.Not surprising but very disappointing."
Thinking of selling all my shares!
"If you could figure this stock out, You must be related to Houdini."
"Total Return is something T investors must have never heard of, smh."
I just have to keep posting this because I think T is one of the best investments for the next decade. Share price is near a 20 year low and this company absolutely prints money. 7.5% divy with 50% SP upside? yes please
"The sun came up this morning, that's how I knew T would be in the red again...."
What is the word? Why is this share price so low?
Anonymous became the new John Granville The world will not end Will put him to rest now he could change his name to Mr. gloom and doom of 2021 Mark my words fortunately I am bullish on telephone Love the dividend always did and I am stone DEAf to all those who have been predicting a cut.￼￼￼￼￼￼
"Biden will be raising taxes near you. Get ready, regardless of what you make, you will be paying the tax."
"Lots of people talking about hbomax numbers and what the co will or won't say about them. But I think the point that gets missed is that hbo numbers are greatly nuanced. There are millions of subs out there who watch hbo via cable. Of those, some have activated what is a ""free"" hbomax sub....free meaning no addl cost to them and no addl revenue to T. Then there are truly new signups paying full boat. And then I believe there are subs who had hbogo and were given ""free""' hbomax. Just saying that how all this stuff gets counted and conveyed to the analyst/investor community is important. Said in a misleading or unclear way, it could be harmful. Properly conveyed in an understandable fashion and with positive trend data and the stock should get a really nice boost. As always, jmo."
sweeeeeeeet 1st dividend and 3 more to come. love it
please stay in the 30's by COB next Friday
"VZ the worst of breed and is now a company without a future. LOLOL,LOL,LOL Why because VZ can not compete in the new 5G world they now face. plus VZ is an EU run company CENSORING Americans left and right now , Real Americans are now dumping VZ like a hot potato"

The next ex-divvy day in coming up in April. Take your positions.
I love how this supposedly 'safe' stock is by far the worst loss in my entire portfolio.
With the way rates have dipped the last year this 7% yield is currently 14x the one year cd right now. This is the biggest no brainer stock I’ve ever seen
Me thinks that today is the day. We close above $30.
"OK the panic knee jerk reaction selling is over. T is not necessarily a huge buy low and try to sell high type of investment. The company is solvent. It pays a wonderful dividend. It is part of my core portfolio as I coast into semi retirement. Getting about 15,000 a year in dividends and am very content with that. All you nit bashers and wannabee day traders that think you are making money fiddling and jumping in and out with a few hundred shares are nits"
"If you bought T 1 yr ago, you are down over 24% = $8.85 loss add the divy and u lost $6.77 = 18%. If instead u bought SPY, you'd be up 18% excluding the 2% SPY divy. Hmmm. loss of 18% or up 18%. Which do you prefer? 36% difference between the two."
"Stock ran up last couple of days because someone is expecting to hear good news on analyst and investors day Friday, March 12 all aboard we are going higher￼"
"It's time! It's time for the highest rated and most watched news program in America...The Rachel Maddow Show. The show for intellectuals with understanding beyond bumper stickers and headlines. Doctor Maddow will enlighten your senses and bring breath and depth to your understanding of current events, under currents, and motives of the players making news. I only wish AT&T owned MSNBC too! Enjoy!!!"
don't buy high in March.
Reasons to own AT&T:1) Price is a spring board right now. After appeal is rejected lookout for $402) Div yield high and safe. Can wait for price action while getting paid to do it.3) Growth prospects: 5G will add many millions of new wireless devices.4) Growth prospects: Netflix competitor platform launching next year.5) Growth prospects: AT&T is increasing international presence. 6) Inflation hedge: AT&T has very high pricing power (as all wireless carriers do). They can increase prices easily to match or exceed inflation. Higher inflation as we are witnessing is great timing for the debt side of the balance sheet.
"Most hated large cap on wall st. Stodgy management has not learned how to market the company. Conference call was a boor fest., Down almost every day. It looks so bad I am almost tempted to add to my position. It seems when I get this discouraged it usually signals we are somewhere near a bottom."
"Appears there are 2 R's on this board, LOL,LOL,LOL you demwits!"
"So many broken charts. Time for reset. Stay nimble watch for new trends too emerge. Gl everyone, I still see upside in CL "
anyone know how many shares Elliot bought this time ?
"Analysts don't like this stock. Not sure why. Company keeps making money, raises dividends, buys more companies to make even more money. But the analysts keep telling everyone reasons why it won't work etc. and the company keeps proving them wrong. But all that negative talk does convince people to sell. But if you like a safe company with a nice dividend you should thank the analysts for letting you get it at bargain process."
just remember that 9 days ago 130 million shares of this stock sold between 33.78 and 34.24. nine days before that 49 million shares went between 32.84 and 33.42. volume is starting to pick up from august but notice that high volume days trade on the uptick. it looks like some entity or entities with a lot of bucks are buying in heavy but they are buying smart. after the price gets to a certain point they back off for about 10 days and wait to see how far it goes back down. intelligent accumulation. someone with a lot of money is buying. im thinking either vanguard fund or black rock.
I think this a great buy here. added a bunch
We need an Activist to step up. This relative underperformance is borderline criminal.
"Sold shares back when cnn was running hit pieces, most trusted name in news my ..."
On Thursday Moody’s credit service said that the sale of the 30% of DIRECTV is credit positive. They gave no indication that the dividend is in jeopardy. In my opinion the stock is a buy and we will see a rebound in price this week￼￼￼￼
"I got in at $41.69 because I liked the dividend. I am a firm believer that T will come back, and in the meantime I will collect the dividends. If I can scrape together a few thousand dollars soon, I will pickup a few more shares. Good luck to all."
How much did the Direct TV fiasco cost us ?
Actually surprised how well it is holding up. Could have been much worse
As usual buy 28 range stand pat over 29
Wow.... T is negative the day before you need to hold for the divi. Just think when the dividate is here. It's going to really fall.
#$%$ Good news and couldn?t hold a decent gain.?

Although it sounds pathetic I just received around 100 dollar in dividends from AT&T and I am going to reinvest the dividend and purchase 4 shares of it tonight
"Be glade you are a T shareholder as we make that run to over $65 , Just hope you are not a VZ or NFLX shareholder because they are both in trouble and have no clue they are yet"
"I'm Still Buying... Total of Just Over 40K Shares. Average Now @29.63. As long as this putters around $30 or Higher, I'm Happy.....Almost 7% Yield on a Tital that has INCREADSED Dividends 35 STRAIGHT Years.I'm ALL IN BABY ! Last Today @ 30.33."
AT&T via Warner has the number one movie at the box office. Meg came in with over double the weekend expectations. Three day global take was close to $140 million.

"Cohen comments: Warner Media spin-off???""Cowen suggests WarnerMedia/NBCU spin-off and merger in list of media/telecom surprisesJan. 04, 2021 5:49 PM ETComcast Corporation (CMCSA)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor32 CommentsA Cowen note looking to potential top 10 surprises in media and telecom has a suggestion for a truly newsmaking outcome: that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) spin off and consolidate their media arms, merging NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia into a single giant content-focused entity.That would leave parent companies that could shift their focus toward connectivity, the firm suggests.That's an outcome for which LightShed analyst Rich Greenfield has argued before, saying it's time the companies ""abandon the fool's gold of vertical integration of content and distribution.""As it stands, Cowen rates each of them Market Perform. It has a $34 price target for AT&T (15.5% upside implied).J.P. Morgan expects some improving wireless subscriber trends at AT&T alongside increased retention spending. But it's questioning the Street's expectations for EBITDA, and thinks C-band spending is a concern.Cowen has a $49 target for Comcast (3% downside).In another on its list, Cowen says Lumen Technologies (NYSE:LUMN) might revisit the sale of its consumer business. It's also Market Perform-rated on Lumen, with a $9 price target implying 7% downside.On Lumen, J.P.

Ex-divvy day and announcement coming soon. I can sniff it.
"crazy thought, please don't attack, right now there are really 3 players in mobile, if Dish gets in, there would now be 4, could then T and VZ merge?"
@R I have yet to mute you as I am somewhat amused by your incessant cheerleading. If the HBOMax numbers do not move the stock you are GONE.
What a extraordinary year for the markets. I hope everyone had a profitable year. Too those that didn’t you get a fresh start on Monday!
There's you sign.
"I'm glad I rolled the Feb 26 $28.50 Puts to the $29's yesterday for more premium. My overall premium by selling those Puts on Jan 29 and rolling them higher yesterday is now .96 per share. If the stock closes lower than $29 on Feb 26, I'll have the stock ""put to me"" and I'll have to pay $29 for the shares. If that happens, I'll immediately sell March 26 $29 Covered Calls which are currently selling for $72 each. As the price of the stock rises, the price of the Calls will rise with it and the Puts will drop lower. If the Puts drop low enough I will also have the choice to back them back a lot lower than I sold them for thereby closing out the trade with no more actions needed. I'd get to keep the net premiums at that point and I'd back back starting over selling Puts again."

"Based on the rise in futures and the positive data re WW84, T's pre-market share price appears to reflect a view that the overhang of an expensive auction is more influential on price than the other two.....at this point anyway. Would be nice if T makes a statement when the time is right re the auction that reassures investors on the balance sheet."
"Interesting results from my survey. Three times I asked for a Thumbs UP if you think T will continue to move up from here and Thumbs DOWN if you think it will start dropping back again.The first time I asked the question was yesterday when T was up .70. I got 15 Thumbs UP and 9 Thumbs DOWN. The second time was yesterday as the stock was dropping. I still got 18 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN. The third time was today as the stock was continuing to drop. I got 3 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN.It was obvious (at least to me) that T was only up yesterday in sympathy with VZ which was up strongly because Buffett had taken a big position in VZ. Yesterday I posted that if it wasn't for VZ, T would probably done nothing (as usual). But the ultra bullish longs here, who see every up move as a possible breakout to $40 no matter what the reason, thought otherwise and strongly voted that T would continue to move higher. Later as the stock was dropping, they continued to strongly vote that T would continue to move up. Today, after a very weak close yesterday and after a quick and fairly good sized drop this morning, they suddenly changed their mind and voted strongly for a reversal in thinking and a drop back in the stock to $29.To me, this shows the general mentality of this board. Way too optimistic at the slightest sign of a green day and a general confusion in thinking when T turns red again. I don't think many here have the capacity to understand how, why or what it takes to move a stock in either direction at any particular point in time. Further, most here are more inclined to form an opinion based on emotions alone rather than thinking through things and forming a more logical conclusion. But there's still hope. Take the time to learn what you're doing rather than just jumping to conclusions based on your ""feelings"" and you'll be a lot more successful. Just my opinion."

The C-band auction is already at $70 billion. It will restart in early January and maybe continue into February. No one saw it going this high. It’s a must for T’s 5G. Verizon and T-Mobile are in much better shape. They know AT&T must keep bidding. They gonna use the auction to inflict as much damage as possible. T’s been hoarding cash but this is way above and beyond what anyone saw coming. Let’s see where T’s long term debt ends up 2020. It’s going to be far higher than 2019 with still more to come after the auction.
OOPS couldn't hold $30. SAD.
"just read an article from a credible source evaluating T. Article indicated out of the telecom sector,T is rated last and was T a buy currently? No. Advice was wait until 2022 to buy T regardlessof the high dividend. Reasons; high debt, earnings declines, DTV issue., etc. Stock needs to stabilize"
"My girlfriend asked me if AT&T because she loves HBO Max could go to $100 plus a share. I honestly answered maybe $50 but We are this for the Dividend and Long Haul. Committed. She's younger than me, and wants it now ."
at $40 per share I would be satisfied with a %5 dividend yield....it's only a matter of time
"I'm an options trader. Haven't bought/sold equities for years now. I'm trying to help non-options traders by disavowing the ""risk free"" and other bogus claims of some on this board. So here's another one:When the price of a put/call has moved against them, they sometimes say, ""no matter, I'll just roll it forward"". But what does ""roll"" mean? I'll tell you. It means buy back your position at a loss and go sell another one. Again nothing wrong w/ doing that - it's just for some reason they never make it sound like what it is: closing out of a loss, and opening of another position."
It gets a upgrade but the price goes down it has to be the short sellers keeping the price down
"“Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan upgraded his rating on AT&T to a Buy from a Hold three weeks ago, setting his price target at $32. This implies upside potential of around 8% from current levels.Louthan points out the difficulty in finding large-cap value names and given that AT&T shares have been heavily shorted, Louthan believes that investors could benefit from a mean reversion in price.Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells. The average price target of $31 suggests upside potential of around 4% over the next 12 months.”"
try and figure this out......little tiny pee see schitzo freak cheeto puff is a short seller and an options trader who uses you shareholders with his BRAGGING self-centered fraud......do yourselves a big favor by deleting and muting him from this board......good luck with T

"Just think as Joe's inflation hits and no one will by the 10 year T bill , The best thing the country could bdo right now is sell 50 or 100 year bonds why it's cheap . Inflation is coming and the trigger has already been pulled by May we will have inflation that is becoming out of control"
Up a penny...Beats a poke in the eye
"It’s possible an odd result of moving DTV and those other operations into a separate company is that the free cash flow attributable to that operation is no longer as readily available to T even though they own 70% of the new entity. Therefore, I am now a little more worried about a dividend reduction."
Hey all you robinhooders all you stashers and all sniveling 20 something year olds. If you are here and I doubt that would be many if any. You are making a wise choice for your future. Let all your little winny babie friends go and buy 1 share of Tesla or baba or any other #$%$ they think is cool today. Buy yourself a future and get some of this or maybe go and buy 5 shares of BA and then a few KO. 30 years from now when you are 55 and sick to death of the everyday grind that is your life you will thank me. Just a small tidbit for you to consider. Buuuut you probably will not listen because your generation thinks they know more god.
"The question should be,What does ATT feel about its stockholders?"
5G bandwidths are just too expensive
"T’s not just leaking to analysts. Everything is leaking. It’s a sinking ship. Amazon Prime already has more content than HBO, plus all the other benefits. Doubtful if Amazon would think 3 seconds about spending $80+ billion cash and debt to buy yesteryears John Ford westerns. Hollywood’s day is done. Watch for more rating agencies to go negative watch on T debt."

WOW I just read the deal...Holy #$%$ I hope I misunderstood... So of the 7.8B in cash T is getting $5.8B is coming from debt the new entity is taking on....So T owns 70% of that 5.8B in debt..If this is true they gave the firm 30% to manage the company. Someone tell me I'm wrong..

As they came through the front doors SHE says WE DID IT and Ask for HUG. Who at CNN knew this because she was staged with him before the riots in the Capitol? The riots led to Big Tech removing Parler creating a firestorm of free speech backlash. Dropping the values of stocks by billions. The investor will come after CNN, Twitters users removed will come after CNN and if the FBI might come after CNN. Why does T own CNN. I am an investor and very concerned all the Riot anger now moved against CNN and T."

Let me ask again. Thumbs UP if you think T will continue moving up from here and thumbs DOWN if you think it will be dropping back again in the next day or two.The last time I asked was earlier today when T was up .70 for the day. There were 9 UP thumbs and 5 DOWN.
@fiscal...well answer the question then...
Not bad
QS UBER KO BB going to pop  making runs 
Yikes. C-band auction total just hit 66 Billion dollars. That is insane because the articles I read that are only two days old and had the total at 46 B. Another 20 B increase in just two days of bidding. Here is link with current total. This auction has too many bidders whose future depend on getting a lot of spectrum in this auction and it is pay up or be perceived as an also ran in 5G. Pre-auction the highest estimates I saw were 51 B. https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107
Why does Zacks keep posting negative comments about T? They keep posting their sell rating. I hope they meet or beat just to shut them up.
"T the 7% CD. Range bound $28-$29 but a 7% dividend. T mgt said 1% growth in 2021, so buy in $28 range, expect minimal growth, and collect your 7% dividend. Treat it as it is....a good paying cd. Trick is, buy low and keep until eventually goes to $31-$32 when dividend rate falls below 7% and sell. With the current T management, will never be a high flyer."
Big selloff in the markets today yet ATT is as stable as a mountain of granite.... (with a 7% dividend)....
"If T is dead, why did people buy 190 million shares of this stock today?"
"This could be the correction we were waiting for. 7%, maybe 10% max."
"AT&T dividend investors are officially in no man's land as the CEO flat said to not expect a dividend increase for the next 2 years, which will nullify Aristocrat status and force many institutions to liquidate (they may already be now)."
"Boy did that work out good! With 6 minutes left to closing, I bought back the Jan 29 $28.50 Puts that I previously sold for .55 each for .01 and sold the Feb 26 $28.50's for .71 each. Woo Woo Picked up .54 per share (net) in Jan. and another .71 in Feb. by selling Puts. So if the stock closes above $28.50 on Feb 26, the Puts will expire and I'll get to keep the .71 premiums free and clear. This is like legalized stealing!"

"Reading lots of commentary about much safer alternatives to make 7% + yield....my broker has been doing research on that same topic......and nobody has made any alternative suggestions yet. Don't buy T for growth.....forget that....buy it at $27 for income with almost 8% yield and take the divvy for the long run. Anything higher in the stock price is gravy. Who knows, HBO Max and 5G could even push it up to mid 30's in 6 months. Even if a correction happens buy more near the bottom with a higher yield."

"T is not the typical growth product company. They need to grow the number of products not just keeping the same number and raise prices every year. When are they going to have a WW type block buster hyped flick release each day of the year? Don’t hold your breath. They are too set in the seasonal release mindset and with the onset of streaming that dog is too old to chase game. Get out the wallet boys, it’s time to ramp up production #’s, not just prices. HBO max is a model change not a production increase. Just in case someone wants to bring that up."
Next week we will see 33+. Just have patience. I am long with 200 shares and a bunch of calls :-)
"AT&T’s board agrees with this wholeheartedly!! Not saying it’s bad. It’s not. Just not great for you. Enjoy your dividend.“It’s way past time to put the end to the era of shareholder capitalism.

They have a responsibility to their workers, their community, to their country.”—-Joe Biden"
VZ ip 4pc in pm. Buffet effect?
Dividend cut imminent. No money to buy 5G spectrums.

"BA a hated stock at 52 week highs, what does that tell you? It tells me if your sitting trading T you might want to rethink things........"
way way way undervalued.
This will be the stock people run too when they realize the ridiculous prices being paid for all the others
This is a Strong Buy!!! Enough said.
"One's view if T as a stock entirely depends on when and why you bought your shares. My current 2000 shares were all bought in the $29 range and barring marjoram change they will just sit in my Roth collecting dividends, tax free. It is certainly NOT a growth stock, at least not at this time. I feel badly for folks who bought at $35 or more. I did flip some shares once but sold in early 2018 at around $38.50 but can't remember what I paid but it was a bit less. So fo0r me T has been a steady earner and I anticipate that it will remain so for the long term."
I guess the extra debt with 5G spectrum purchase is very problematic. Dividend looks in serious trouble.

Must be too much static in the line of this stock...
Hello fellow bag holders. I am thinking to sell this stock. I cannot watch HBO or make a phone call and being reminded of the T stock price. Should i sell?
T does not like the 30's. Once it gets its foothold we will see a 10-15% increase.

Telephone getting rid of DIRECTV is the best thing that can happen true it’s only 30% but everyone knows they did it this way show dish can merge in the future buying back stock makes no sense true they save seven percent on the dividend paying down debt is the only way to go I owned 9000 shares I have a substantial loss but I’ve been collecting dividends for 2 1/2 years I will be adding two average down I believe the dividend is safe going forward forget about changing management you’re only creating chaos let the company go forward￼￼￼
"It's amazing to me how many posters have a dividend complex?Maintaining the dividend will never enhance the growth prospects for this stock.Why don't we ever get news from the LAB about communication breakthroughs?Scientists from MIPT, Moscow Pedagogical State University and the University of Manchester have created a highly sensitive terahertz detector based on the effect of quantum-mechanical tunneling in graphene. The sensitivity of the device is already superior to commercially available analogs based on semiconductors and superconductors, which opens up prospects for applications of the graphene detector in wireless communications, security systems, radio astronomy, and medical diagnostics. The research results are published in a high-rank journal Nature Communications."

"Before the pandemic John Stephens (former CFO for 40 years) was projecting 2022 eps of $4.20 (apprx). Now that more people are receiving Covid vaccinations, will T be able to start generating eps increases by 2023?"
"You know what helps a lot of people when they are constipated? Having a cup of T, because it almost always ***** the bed. Market up today! T not so much."
The DI+ crossed over the DI-. That's a positive indicator.
I wouldn't get too cocky in the markets. The out of control variants (especially the S African one) will be the next thing to keep over exuberance in check. Keep cash ready.
CNN most watched cable news network.
Live action Harry Potter series announced. My easy prediction is in time Disney + and HBO max will be top two streaming services on the market.
I sold 500 shares of VZ today and bought 1000 shares of T.
Reminder to the DEMS who are outraged at Capitol hill riots. IT IS NOT THIER BUILDING. It BELONGS to the PEOPLE. Thats what democracy is all about.
"Ya $1400 is B.S. We want $14,000. We can't eat cake every day!"
T will be a $100 soon 
Many will wonder about ATT spending Billions with IBM and Microsoft and that they are throwing away billions of dollars. Nothing could be further from the truth. This tech will drive company and employee productivity way beyond the cost of the outlays. This is big news.
Sorry guys. That's just how T rolls and you should know that by now.
"annnnd , wait for it, down again"
As COVID knocks out the 70+ year olds who own this stock for the Div help is on the way soon. A more agile ATT without a 15 billion a year debt to old people will emerge and T will finally be able to compete. Unless those alzheimer's patients sink ATT for good first. Fingers crossed covid saves ATT!!!!!
The more Wall Street bashes the more Wall Street wants your shares of T cheap. 5G is going to be one of the biggest growth drivers over the next 3 years. It's like unlocking the internet all over again. Huge growth and T has picked up some of the greatest assets to take advantage of it. You have to worry when Wall Street is pumping like they did on INTC they wanted out bad and it shows.
Vote DEM and get $2000 check in a month. Nice direct bribe. Usually bribes are handled with nuances (like tax cuts).
"Stakeholders.......employees who think showing up for work entitles them to input. Well do they understand that when the company purchases a 10 million dollar piece of equipment that the ""Stakeholders"" would have to contribute money? Oh they think that they just get to be there for the payouts not the payins? Difference is Investors pay into the company by buying a piece. Employees get paid and have no financial responsibility. Working there should not entitle anyone to more than their exchange of time worked for money."
How come T is not down today. Something is wrong with the markets for sure.
Awesome dividend while you wait for the stock to go up 50% or more over the next 2-3 years.
Market goes up T goes downMarket goes down T goes downThis is ridiculous the ceo needs to be fired NOW
"From Daily mail c0m: Updated 11:02 EST Jan 3, 2021 Anthony Warner I might have to agree, there may be Lizards out there that roam the AT&T board still thinking HBO to Max out-does Disney+ in subscriber base... All Lizard based...----""He further wrote about reptilians and lizard people that he believed control the earth and had tweaked human DNA.'They put a switch into the human brain so they could walk among us and appear human,' Warner wrote.Warner did write extensively about 'perception,' adding that 'Everything is an illusion' and 'there is no such thing as death.'""He did not mention AT&T, outside whose building he detonated his RV; nor did he give a motive."
It doesn’t make sense to invest in a stock with a 5-10% dividend that drops over 10% a year . It’s time for T to drop the dividend
"The SEC will settle with T for $10 million in fines, and that will be that. Both have very good lawyers and can drag this out for years."
Sell CNN to Bezo for $20B and payoff the Godzilla debt.
Sad. Stock price now is a dollar less than it was 2 weeks ago. :(
Watching Red Equal jumping back and forth from day to day is like watching Richard Simmons sweatin' to the oldies. LOL
"T of course is controlled by the Dividend funds and the Pension funds that require T in their portfolios to keep the cash coming every Q and maintain their dividend goals for the entire fund.If the Pension funds want T to go higher, it will go higher. If the Pension funds want T to go lower it will go lower. The markets are controlled by the FED. Individual Stocks and ETF's are controlled by the Pension Funds.Thats the entire story."

"I use T for selling covered calls, and I have been having good luck not getting assigned, so I love getting the dividends along the way. Any recommendations for other tickers you folks use for covered calls?"
"Any move lower now will only be a chance to buy more T, before earnings and the run higher off earnings"
Even GM has PE of 12.. I think AT&T goes back to $40 pretty soon
"AT&T has a lot of debt. (190 billion - 175 long term, 15 short term) but Verizon has 135 billion of debt (125 long term, 10 short term) and nobody ever mentions it. And all they own is AOL and Yahoo. AT&T could probably get at least 60 billion for Time Warner at the drop of a hat. Maybe another 10 billion for DirecTV. So who really has the worse debt situation?"
Doesnt anyone care that ELLIOTT bought stake in T?
Down is the future T stock move trend.Bottom around March
So you're going to sell T to buy Growth Stocks after a 10 year bull run in bull stocks? Good luck with that.
Is there a reasonable chance that Stankey will update (increase) 2021 projections for FCF and sales during the presentation today?
"Dead money, $25 or below within a quarter. Below $20 is the trend T=Trash is heading."

You better not say anything wrong over on this board unless you want to get Mutated like a Ninja Turtle. Vagicell & others will see to it!!!
Does T need to stoop to the level of allowing CNN to pay radical leftists to break into government buildings to get some titillating video and exclusive interviews.
Stanky hard at work perfecting his short game and sand wedge
"As usual on a market green day.....T my only loser in the red. getting to be a curse on my overall portfolio. OK, u say sell it. I guess I'm too stubborn. or maybe like the $700 plus dividend I received this morning. lol"
a little factoid.....did you know Joe Namath was the first white quarterback to win a super bowl (commonly referred to as super bowl III).....bart starr (a white guy quarterback) won both AFL-NFL championship games referred to as super bowls I and II....inquiring minds want to know
The stock market is the only place where people run away from the clearance section and buy the same product overpriced. #Loadup
I guess they didn't like my post calling out the NFL for going black on everything. White lives matter too and there are a lot of great white acts to hire for half time shows instead of the garbage that's been on lately for the last few Super Bowls. That Weeknd guy yesterday was flat out awful. If we're ever going to become a unified country we're going to have to start treating all ethnic groups the same but right now the NFL is pushing in a different direction.

T really has fear of heights. It likes to stay low.
It's refuelling now..watch it move past 31 today.
Good evening T ~ somethings going on with dish for the better . Earnings on Monday hopefully spectrum news and possible deal with Verizon. I am skeptical about what I have heard regarding VZ but possibly a relationship of sorts

AT&T partially dumping Direct TV is good. Maybe we’ll see a little gain.

Bezos quit AMZN to takeover T ?
"AT&TJust saw a commercial saying that in 2022, a new Game of Thrones series called ""House of the Dragon"" is coming.I'm buying as much T as I can get my hands on over the next year."
I would not be surprised if by Fall places like California are not paying over $5 a gallon for gas. Joe has done everything he can to screw the American people into paying way more in the future for oil and gas from the countries that hate America the most. FACT
"HBOMax set single day mobile download record. If this headline came out for Disney+ DIS would be up 10/share and we get .20, go figure!"
It appears that after hours trading has had quite a bit of profit taking. Expect to see the price tomorrow take off from the after hours pricing. Great quarter and projections for the first quarter are tremendous!
There is obviously a Whale with a massive position that wants out. T not gonna get out of this until he’s done selling.
"Yes G the DEM wit without a brain it looks like VZ is the next GE of Wall Street as VZ loses more and more customers to T's monster LOL,LOL,LOL"
selling at 30.30 buy back at 28.50 up too fast
Order in to reduce T position by 25%.......for starters.
Nice Tomorrow is 1st Dividend sweetest and 3 more to come this year Good Start
It wont bottom until 25
This stock is so stagnant and barely moves in either direction for last 9 month.
"T is a long-term hold. Great company, 5G, and an excellent, steady dividend.Why sell it?"
"what a day, what a day. T is green. Someone pinch me. Am I dreaming?"
Basically lost what it gained yesterday. No biggie. We keep motoring on. Next scheduled event: The results from the spectrum auction and the cost of it.
"COLLEGE GRADS LOVE GOOD DATA AND FACTS. THANKS, CNN."
"what's management's logic here? T is highly over leveraged. won't sell DirecTV, yet take on another $14B to get more 5G spectrum. No wonder this thing declines everyday"
"If you build it, they will come."
1.1 percent green ? Market is manipulated !
Politicians have No Business in the Markets.
"That control T any more now that T's 5G monster is taking customer away from VZ, T mobile and NFLX LOL,LOL Why because actions speak volumes"
WOW look at Wall Street dumping VZ today why because VZ has no future
I guess we are now seeing the China Joe effect. He wants to lock everything up. We will probably see at least 4 years of an up and down market until a lot of you people will wake up and vote a fair election.

"If you bought mid-day, you essentially lost half the dividend. Freaking hilarious."
looking for a 37.85 close or better today
I have growing conviction here that these assets are mispriced. Building toward mid 6 figure position.
Get it while ya still can under $32.! These deals come along once in a Lifetime!
I’m tempted daily on just sale and buy into something that moves.
"I view T as a a high yield ""junk bond"". Yes, there is some risk to your capital and no dividend is ever totally secure but T has not missed or decreased the dividend for something like 20 years. Buy, hold, take the divvies to the bank. Plus there is upside possibility in that shares at $29 today could be worth $35 at some point over the next 2-3 years."
T is the only one is green while others are tanking in red.
Again back into 28 range.
"Well... everyone telling to get rid of the stock because it will go done , good time to buy more ."
"Well Homegamers... Like I said....I SOLD MY 8,900 Shares Yesterday, Just Before The Close.I Said.....SELL BEFORE EARNINGS !"
HBO Max alone should have T at a $55 price currently. And many forget that AT&T is the leader in 5G. Also Direct TV is not a failure and I love  it.
anyone have any ideas on the pop? i checked a number of sources and don't see news. thx.
Hold the line granny and grandpas counting on you
"I just muted 9 people who post stupid things. It makes it better to read the site with people who post good, intelligent and useful information.

You just need to be Patient, and the Div. is not going Anywhere. No more Reinvesting the dividend, Just going to start taking the cash from now on. Show me the money Jerry. Thank You T."

*The McClennan has rolled over. Be careful today friends
Sometimes I wonder why we still hold ATT. Recently I looked at the Yahoo chart for ATT. It only goes back to about 3-1-84. Check it out! Price per share 3-1-84=4.77 7-1-99=57.13 12-16-20=30.50. As you can see T has gone up and down but overall it is up. We have had T stock for over 50 years and have reinvested the dividend. We have also sold shares to diversify. I have to say that over the years ATT has helped us to build a nice portfolio. I believe that ATT is at a low now and it is a strong buy!!!
"Bought 2000 shares in 2019 avg cost 31.12. Loss of $5185 based on stock price right now. Rec'd total of $3120 in divy. Right now I'm underwater by $2065. I need stock to get to $29.60 for breakeven. So, how is that 7% yield working out? Let's see, that's $62.5K invested for 2 years and it's producing a negative return. Makes me look stupid, eh?"
29.99 or $30 comeon.
Close the market T is trying to close Green ! 
"Love all the DEFUND the DEM wits , that all companies are now doing"
Cheetah is quiet today.NICE.
"The fact is T is now the Amazon of telecom . T can give things away free to gain customer and grow LOL,LOL,LOL. Easy give them HBO max free and get a new customer for $100-$200 a month no brainer and now need to wonder why VZ and T mobile are now losing customers at a record pace LOL,LOL,LOL"
"MOTLEY Fool Article Just Out......ATT.....Dirt Cheap Dividend Stock To BUY NOW !With interest rates near record lows, it can be tempting for investors to seek out dividend stocks with high yields. Unfortunately, elevated dividend yields often indicate trouble. Big dividend payments today mean nothing if the stock later crashes.While dividend stocks can be a minefield, there are a few good high-yield options unlikely to disappoint long-term investors. Both telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) and tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have been left behind by investors this year, pushing valuations down and dividend yields up. Both stocks now look like great dividend options."
One day in 20 and @R is right!
Godzilla vs. Kong on HBO Max.I somehow feel better being long T.
"Unlike all of last year, actual science-based decisions and federal-led efforts are being championed and will eventually result in a healthier Main Street environment. This will lead to the restoration of small business and jobs, and help the top and bottom line of AT&T and it's retail customers."
5 year chart looks good
What does it take for T to go up. seems like this management is just happy the way thing are and stock holders should be happy with dividend. I bought T at $29 in 2004 and its still at the same price.
"I also bought another 850 shares at $28,48 the other day. Better then putting your money in the bank. Better interest, and chance for growth."
AT&T should be over $40.00...Just unbelievable. Great earnings call.
30 with staying power this time.
AT&T at $31 makes it the buy of 2018. Buy today and make 40% within 6 months. Upper management forecasting accelerated profits beginning 1st Qtr. 2019. Warner Media continues pumping out hit movies and 5G coverage continues coverage in every state.
"This has to be the most hated stock in the market. I will collect my dividends until people start to love this company. I just hope I live long enough to see that day. The old saying is every dog has it's day, and I been waiting for years like most holders just to hear a BARK, and wait I will."
Good morning T ~ what a week I have had but all is good . Stocks I would buy now are expensive. Waiting for a pull back which I feel will happen
US producer prices soared 0.5%; consensus 0.4%. The index increased 2.8% y/y surpassing consensus of 2.6%. This represents the largest increase year-to-year since October 2018.10 year Tbill over 1.63%What’s happening????
The cloud hanging over ATT's head:CNN
T~ good afternoon ~ spectrum will be in the news next week . If dish has to give up its discount price in 2015 they stand to profit huge . Don’t think it’s merger news but a cash friendly partner will come to light
"This dog should not be up this week given how poorly it has been managed. Also, the dividend is not secure. What's up on T?"
Is anyone leaving the station today? LOL
T ? What exactly is your plan with direct tv ? You never really had a plan and never should have been allowed to buy in the first place

When the stocks down like this it's going to be a good thing because when everybody's dividends reinvest on Monday it'll go back up
Just added more. Will end above $30 today.
T down 3% in last 6 months.
There will be a sector rotation these weeks. Up to 31%.
This #$%$ - t - going south on direct tv news.
going up as VZ rallies thanx WB
Earnings will be down 90%. SELL
moves to $50
You can see how many people really do not understand how the dividend works...
break that $30 mark before ex-date !
I heard there's going to be a dividend cut in the future everybody run for the hills
so would we get shares of the new company?
"In regards too China stocks. For me they are trades, and Not investments. I will ride the trend and take tgts until I see a sell signal."

"T is starting to clean up it,s act now that randall stephenson has left i think we will start seeing a slow uptick in stock price"
"Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform Monday, saying “there is more that can go right during the next 12 months than can get worse for AT&T T . ” He had downgraded the stock earlier in the pandemic amid concerns about what the COVID-19 crisis could mean for the company’s WarnerMedia business, but now he’s more upbeat about the company’s prospects and strategy.“Throw in the fact that shares are heavily shorted, and we believe this is a recipe for upside,” Louthan wrote. “Large-cap value names are hard to come by, and we think investors who can wait a few months for a mean reversion while locking in a 7% yield should be rewarded for buying AT&T at current levels.”"
"at a 6% plus safe div, T is a buy all day long....I will be adding in a wee bit"
"and we all know that those HBO Max numbers are still super low, by the next quarterly report we'll see huge growth, and a steady stream of upward revisions as each phase goes into play"
"ive had my concerns over the years but hey... no fear and love the dividend rate. $34..... or 28, im in for the long haul using their DRIP program."
"AT&T’s multi-billion $ Network/Infrastructure upgrades are complete, Content, IT Services, Entertainment, cell/5G build-out, Redundant Nationwide Fiber loops, continued Asset Sales with accelerated debt reduction, First Net build, rural Fixed Wireless deployment, AT&T TV and Hi-Cap 5G delivery just now heating up. AT&T is quietly sitting at a $28.80 PPS, 15.4 P/E and 7.2% dividend, IMO this sleeping dog is due to awake with a long-overdue vengeance."
Negative market open today. Looks like back to $28’s for T today. More buying opportunity ?
OH NO!!! It looks like the final closing price of T was $29.99. That's even funnier than $30.00! LOL LOL
Value trap. They are still paying huge dividends instead of acquisition and innovation says the board have given up.
Good morning T ~ for me I am watching dish the next two weeks into earnings on the 17th or so . Real interested in what they say about progress into there network and spectrum. Stock is cheap but not buying more at this point
"Poor stock performance, but worth keeping some for good dividends. Much better than any bank or CD at least."
Looks like none of the GOP people on this board are complaining about the $1.9T spending package. I guess the $1400 bribe silenced the nay sayers.
"“AT&T says it will start deploying new 5G spectrum this year, raises HBO subscriber forecast”"
"AT&T has a high payout ratio, 289% (Using the annual income statement) it's an aristocrat stock but this ratio concerns me. Maybe the company would be in debt to pay dividends."
it is so obvious that $30 is a block wall we cant get past. geez
I guess the last post went through...
free cash more than double what they pay in the dividend...end of story.
This criticism of T stock price shows that people dont know how stocks work. If T did the same thing as JPM and give out 1% in div yield and the stock price goes up 5% youd all love it but since you get your 6% as a div you complain. If you dont want div and want to make money through growing pps go buy BRK.B. But eventually when you sell no matter how the 6% is broken down between pps appreciation or dividend it is all the same money in your povket.
"Keep an eye on the 10 yr, moving up fast. Food costs skyrocketing! lumber!#inflation"
Did I hear they are raising the dividend?
AT&TAaron Rodgers and Cheetah (Atlanta Genteleman's club) have a lot in common. Both are jack wahds.
"T cannot even unload Direct tv without a gigantic 28 billion dollar loss......Time Warner was another overpaid disaster.....so for the few pennies on a dividend which is now frozen for the next 2 years according to management, people are still buying T......it only pays for someone over 75 to consider buying this stock to help with their social security........why would any hedge fund consider buying into T with it's horrific record of overpaying and then undeveloping what they purchased......The bigshots of course make their millions but anyone considering purchasing T today would be foolish.....it just keeps slowly going down, frozen dividend or not.... Anyone under 75 reading this post should immediately look into any other stock, tech or genetic engineering especially.....in 5 years most of the good ones will have doubled and T will be around 24......."
May of had a dead cheetah bounce in the Nasdaq yesterday. Could see continuation of value stock buying. Nothing personal cheetah I do agree with you on somethings.

"Snagged 5,000sh/$28.66 in Friday’s last minute of trading. If it doesn’t move up, then I’ll dump it at $28.67 and move to VZ"
"Bought more shares. Looked today at how the disney PE took off once d+ got traction. It made an incredible move from 20 trailing pe to 60+ even as it's core business (theme parks) were totally shuttered for covid. Even if it doesn't happen overnight, HBO max WILL get on that trajectory. They have much better content than their peers and this 1 year marketing promotion (new releases on the platform) will expose people to the project and it will be sticky. International rollout this year. I could go on and on. Once wall street believes the story, PE will climb to 30 and beyond here. Bought in big today on top of my existing positions. VERY BULLISH GOOD TIMES AHEAD!"
Who was the nice lad who gave me 100 more shares at $28.80?
Looks like all the Swamp Creatures are slithering back into Washington DC
Watch the breadth tomorrow and the VIX T friends. Market is in a tricky spot. Some funds could blow up this week... there are sellers front running the margin call liquidation of longs. Imo if there are stocks you like wait for Market breadth and VIX to improve first.

"Good Riddance for some nice pocket change. The transaction valued Hulu at $15 billion. The company, which competes with Netflix Inc and Amazon.com’s Prime Video, has more than 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.""Disney last week forecast Hulu’s subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and become profitable in the United States by either 2023 or 2024"""
Added to my position today 486 share. At 29
DirecTV was a terrible acquisition. But it’s Latin America franchise was exceptional. Can they leverage that with the streaming assets ?
Evening T ~ markets have me confused. Manipulation? Maybe not but 27 years investing and made good money along the way something doesn’t seem right . Markets maybe good but economy is in bad shape
Time for ATT& T ti increase their dividend.
TMUS pain is T gain. Where is their div?
How's that short working out ?Looks like this was a well setup bear trap.Long overdue.
everybody heading to ATT for safety. equity is worth $40 a share.
KEEP DROPPING.....PLEASE.. Sorry everyone. I just want to buy more and lower my DCA..
World markets are up massively yesterday and today combined so I wonder if we end up green a penny or two?
This stock and company make me so sad. It reminds every day of missed returns compared to almost any other stock.
"yo, cheetah, did you see the article over at CNBC about the oil majors??interesting"
I sold 500 shares of VZ yesterday and added 950 shares of T using the proceeds from that sale.
"4000 crossing the border every day. That's 120,000 entering the country every month between here and Mexico. Are they at least giving them Covid tests? Maybe Phil knows."
"T is through the roof today, finally my -20% (minus) return is improving."
Interest rates increase is just a passing thing. The FED will be back in soon buying up bonds with its INFINITE CASH horde.

I had an important meeting tonight...I am reiterating $55.00 target and Strong Buy. HBO Max along with Business and Government are exceeding predictions.
"AT&T an ‘Extreme’ Bargain, May Rise 12%AT&T Inc. ( T) has continued its negative performance over the past couple of years, down 15% this year amid a broad underperformance in the telecom sector in general. Using a bit of reverse engineering Flannery found that AT&T is trading at “extreme valuation levels,” not only relative to its own historical value, but also to shares of competitor Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ), according to Barron’s.https://www.investopedia.com/news/att-extreme-bargain-may-rise-12/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoohttps://www.barrons.com/articles/at-ts-gotten-way-to-cheap-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-buy-1534171026"

Green on a red day. Very rare around here.
Kevin says no more bailout for the airlines. Let em file BK.
"People can make all the negative comments about “ T “ and the company’s dept that they want, but the way I see it is this company is like the largest financial institutions......To big to fail....can you imagine if T filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors and shut down its networks ? It would disrupt everything in our country and through out the world ! Verizon’s systems couldn’t handle the additional load. Hang on to your T stock. This company’s not going anywhere but up !"
"If Zacks says sell, then it is time to buy. Their articles are paid for by the highest bidder. Someone must want to buy cheap before earnings."
Turner Sports/Bleacher Report streaming service along with ESPN streaming will explode to the top of the streaming market

Here we go again. Another down day.Management change is needed badly.Sell CNN
I'm a shareholder and am unhappy with the stock's performance. I just signed up for the free 7 day HBO Max download through Youtube TV. I soon discovered not all of the movies are available for streaming and there is no search feature. I believe the same goes for Roku. Netflix is much easier to use and T needs to improve HBO Max features if they want to seriously compete with Netflix.
Annual meeting notice goes out next week.
Because of some of his recent snarky and cocky posts I am finally muting Cheetah. Good luck to you though Mr. Small Timer.
"Where are the ""$30 by Friday,"" and ""$40 next week""guys. I hope that they are all okay."
Anyone else here warming up too a long in some dirty energy?
Anybody who believes this soaring stock market is from real business growth is deluded. It's a BIG bubble.
This is one of the safest investments for 2021 period!
"The last time ATT was at least this high was Dec 11, 2020. Quite a move(for T) over the past week."
People are predicting a crash in the stock market. BALONEY... Maximum 10% correction before the FED steps in. Thats it. NO CRASH.And those predicting INFLATION are nuts. NO INFLATION whatever the prices are. Its been fixed that way.
After Netflix earnings I got a feeling this will take off today to the 30's!
Financial Manipulation is keeping T & VZ down...IMO in todays Market both should be approximately $95 Per Share
"For 2 days (in a row), T has closed over $30!!!!!! May good times be had by all!!"
"Wow, getting first COVID shot next Thursday and second one on March 11. I can't believe it. I didn't think we'd be getting any serum until maybe April."
Investor's that believe in fair reporting. At&t owns CNN. Vote with your money.
"AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner was the ""acquisition of the year"" and will have AT&T shares selling in the $50 range within a year. UBS got this one right as they usually do."
"Though its still a great time to add to a position. I really wanted to add more at a 31ish level. did not do it when I had the chance. My average is 32.92. Who knows what this stock will do between now and June 12th. If I have a chance to add at a 31 level again, I have 250 more shares set up to buy. Either way. you cant go wrong at these levels. Those that say T is the next GE, this is a totally different company, not even close."
"If you buy a Tesla today and pay 1 bitcoin for it, Elon will have to return $16K back. At 35K for a low-end Tesla and the price of bitcoin at $51K.Nice trade for a worthless bitcoin."

Back to 38 end of year or sooner.
"The Fact is the U.S. Government by their own actions in selecting T has said both VZ and T Mobile can not be trusted and more because they have been taken over by the EU's one world order. The US Government is telling All Americans to NEVER EVER do any business with either VZ or T Mobile , because they can NOT be Trusted to protect your data. U'S. Government has done that by giving the business to T is says T is safe and can be trusted"
ATT is a classless company.Which means it has no class.
Hopeless stock. All the pumpers in the world will not increase the price of this stock.
lol idk why but I'm happy were back in the 29 realm again.
The dollar is falling Very bad news for the US economy. Big inflation on the way. Gas prices going to double
Green by EOD. Undervalued and nothing but good news on earnings.
perhaps I didn't mention it correctly because I mean it's 120 to 125 million with the international subscribers so maybe reconsider the price of the service when launching because people here in Europe always go with the cheaper one or the most talked about
Never see the $ 20 's again !!
It looks like T will still own a 70% interest. Which means that they will have to include that proportion of the new company’s results in T’s reported results. T would have to get down to less than 50% to exclude the results.....I think.
Why is T falling?
"All AT&T CEO has to say is ""HBO max SUBSCRIPTION blah blah blah, and 5G and EV blah blah blah"" These two comments will bring this up at least 200%."
33 tomorrow’s close great numbers across the board
#$%$ why does this stock go to 30 and back down again. Are people shorting this stock every day
"Futures green, tomorrow UP UP UP. at&T makes a lot of money."
"I doubled my position in T yesterday, I believe below 30 is a buying opportunity. It's a good piece in a deiversified portfolio - no one should put all the eggs in one sector or just in growth stocks. Don't worry, I have those as well.T makes content and strong in 5G. Yes, they need deep pockets for the auction, but 5G brings huge opportunities for M2M IoT, this sector will have massive growth rate in the upcoming years, so I'm not worried, T will monetize it.What if they cut or suspend the dividend? I don't care, then the company will reduce the debt faster, and increase/restart the divident in a much stronger financial position. I can wait a few Qs or even years for that, stock price volatility doesn't matter. T is an ultra long term play for me, probably never to be sold, will be inherited by my children."
We’re goin higher.
How many of you bought more shares today and paid over $30.20 per share?
"Let's talk covered calls...If one were seeking to generate additional income from writing covered calls, what would be the best timing to sell those covered calls? Before you respond, this is purely a calendar based question, not a price/value or any other variable. Simply seeking a timing centered around perhaps dividend record or distribution or options expiration. I guess what I'm asking...Is there (generally speaking) a sweet spot (based on the calendar) to write covered calls? I have mostly relied on instinct, with a fair amount of success, but I'm looking to dummy it down to a calendar/timing thing."
TX - how is that deregulation of the utils working out? oops!
"T couldn’t be in a worse position to compete with its well funded streaming competition. T’s own prediction was that only 3 streamers would be left standing. As service providers become mere providers of ever cheaper data, T will probably end up having to unloading it’s Warner assets at fire sale prices to stay ahead of the debt freight train. Given enough time they might do it...but change is accelerating. Competitors that didn’t even exist when T began its battle to acquire Warner are already miles ahead."
"Between getting the Divi and selling high/buying low, I have increased my share total by 1099 in less than 9 months. Went from 1,700 to 2,799 :) Easy Peasy."
"I told you all a couple weeks ago, Draftkings, GM and AT&T. DKNG was around $48 now over $60, GM was $45 now $54 and both just getting started. T hasn't moved, but it's day is soon coming as anyone with a bit of sense can see from the recent earnings the direction we're seeing, HBO Max is gonna blow up over this quarter with major releases including Kong vs. Godzilla, especially now that you can actually get the service outside of just a phone app, lol"
T is down in pre mkt today. Bodes well. Not.
I can’t believe this. They are finally getting rid of at least a part of Direct TV and all the market does is shrug?
T will POP today based on JP Morgans upgrade to Overweight. The stars are aligned.
"From article this am-“Overall, AT&T has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $31.88 implies upside potential of 6.9% to current levels.”"

ATT stock was heading past 31 until the democratic house proposed legislation to undo the death of net neutrality at the federal level. now stock seems to have an artificial ceiling at 30. i believe it is worth a lot more. randall stevenson is well ahead of schedule in wiping out the debt which will only strengthen the balance sheet of the firm and thus the underlying value of the company. total debt has gone from $180 billion to $168 billion in 6 months. that is a 17% reduction in debt on an annual basis. at that rate the company could wipe out THE ENTIRE DEBT in 6 years if they went all out and not reduce CAPEX by a single penny.
T a real American company for Americans and will protect your data not sell it off or Collect your data for the EU one world order like both T Mobile and VZ is now doing. The Government had to give the first responders to T because they can be trusted to protect American people FACT
"T in one year -25% (yes minus) , dividend 7%. Who stole the rest of my money?"
It must be CNN's fault.
Still an opportunity to buy under 30 to get that compound effect WITH appreciation
joe sqint sese...i can ruin this country in 100 days....
Nothing but baloney on this board today. See you guys tomorrow.
I hope it goes down more so I can buy more shares. I love the stable dividend.
Evening T ~ VZ has been very quite in Covid era . Always said VZ premium customers are loyal you don’t know in Covid times
"T isnt going anywhere, nothing changed to business, whole marked tanked last week, + current dividend yield is amazing and will beat rising inflation."
"As usual, WS thinks that VZ will have a good earnings report, T not so good.That's my opinion based on today's action."

streets worried about 5g spectrum debt getting piled on
"What is it going to take to try to turn this stock back in a positive direction? Their fundamentals, and earnings are solid- their free cash flow is more than sufficient to pay their dividend, their debt is more than being paid down, and they have an emerging technology in 5G, that is going to change the way we all access our internet and wireless needs. With all of their recent acquisitions- that all have contributed to their earnings.....what else can they do to show the street? They have become more than just a phone service provider- like Verizon and T-mobile. It can't be the Time Warner lawsuit over- hanging their heads. How can a company trade at less than 10 times their annual earnings- and pays a 6+% dividend- not be bought at these levels....I just don't get it. So much for people flocking to safe, quality stocks."
"Last year I bought T for the dividend. Of course, the price went down on the X dividend date and kept on going down there after. Panic set in and I sold, loosing the dividend and some capital. A short time later T recovered past my buy in point and beyond. Lesson learned? Sometimes it pays to just relax, step back and wait. Not always, but sometimes."
"Still not too late to get in on GM which is ridiculously undervalued even after recent run up, everyone is just beginning to realize how much this company has going on. They've got it all, their own proprietary battery, the Ultium which is so innovative that Honda has worked out a deal with GM to utilize their battery. They own 70% of Cruise AV platform, the most advanced AV out there(some may argue Waymo) but they are the two clear leaders, GM owns 70% while partners Honda as well as major collaborator Microsoft also own stakes in what is currently valued at $30billion. GM has a propriety hydrogen fuel cell platform which has already inked major partnerships which truck fleet companies Navistar and newcomer Nikolia to provide these fuel cells for the production of zero emissions semi-trucks. GM fully owns subsidiary Brighdrop, an EV and logistics company providing EV delivery trucks built by GM, early customers include FedEx who has already placed a major order along with Merchants Fleet just placing an order for over 12,000 vans.Put it all together along with GM's production to distribution infrastructure along with some badass EV rolling out and GM is back on top!"
"As mentioned before, luckily ex div day is a wash for me since I will get mine at COB price of today. Lot easier to get rid of a chunk and buy back after standard ER collapse."

Finally muted John! LOL
I enjoy my dividend I get from AT&T but I’ve been re-investing that money in other stocks that are giving me growth such as Starbucks Boeing I didn’t want to have too much holdings in 1 stock! But I’m still long and strong on AT&T good luck to all !

"A lot of board chatter about lack of growth for T. Anyone harboring the notion that T is a growth stock is barking up the wrong telephone pole. T is a telcom stock like VZ and their discipline is dividends (value), not growth. If you want Growth buy something else. Telcoms, REITs, preferreds, CEFs, Utilities, etc are all INCOME stocks. They ain't gonna change because you wrote about your displeasure on a message board. So go away and do research and get a growth stock. You're sitting at the wrong table!"
I understand this is an income stock and all....but will we ever see a Green Day?
"No, don’t buy this for 7% dividend. No growth. Momentum strongly down. It’s a dead end. When it’s $23 dividend won’t help."
"Price, sooner or later, always returns to its 10-day moving average. Currently, the 10-day ma is $29.10.Either price will move up to the 10-day ma, or the 10-day ma will drop down to its price. T is also in a bearish descending triangle facing a potential 3–4-point drop. T needs a good ER or some good news to strengthen its position. Bears will push this down if it breaks support at $28.30."
People need to realize that stocks with high yielding dividends do not shoot up in price as a growth stock. People are buying and holding long term for retirement. Don't expect this stock to go up and stay up on every bit of good news like growth stocks do. This stock may not hit$40.00 for several years. But don't sell if you are in a good spot and good yield with this stock. It is recession proof.

Customers can easily telecommute, video-conference, upload and download photos and videos, and connect faster to the cloud. AT&T has millions of miles of fiber and this expansion furthers the Company's lead as the largest provider of fiber across the 21 states where it offers home internet service. The success of mobile 5G relies on a quality fiber connection to the wireless towers or small cells, which then translate the fiber connection into an ultra-fast wireless signal for customers.

"HBOMAX should help with earnings. However, a lot of people like myself have gotten it for free as part of their cable service. Well, I guess I'm paying for it and other channels because nothing is absolutely free. Will be interested to see exactly have many HBOMAX paid subscribers T added in q4 2020. If it's an impressive number, could see the pps top $30 and stay there. Right now, with so many HOLD ratings, not a lot of electricity being generated for T. Could see a .50 pop in the pps if they sell Direct TV, even if it's for a big loss."
5G is and will be dominated by AT&T don't fool yourselves.
not enough fear in the market. poor time to buy stocks.
"The FACT is T gets paid 7.5 billion and needs to take about a $32 billion dollar loss of which T took 15 billion for last Q so T will be force to now take what ever the remaining lose is this Q up to 17 billion No matter how you cut it that is bad. The only real question is what will have the biggest impact on T in the future. Taking the 7.5 billion and paying off debt.? or Taking the 7.5 billion and retiring shares for good. We know T pays over 7% on the dividend and I am sure T pay a lot less on the interest on the DEBT. The Question is What would have the biggest impact for T long term for the future. They will be savings either way , but what would help T long term the most?"
Look at the earnings graph from 2017-2020. If another year of down I think it’s time to exit  sadly I will sell my shares at a loss when it happens

Safe dividends with 7.22% yield. HBO Max offers future growth prospects. It's a bargain at this price.
T was in the Holiday spirt and wanted to finish green and above $30 thank your local leprechaun
Was reading an article by seeking alpha that by the first earnings quarter of 2018 AT&T is going to raise their dividend by .04 cents. I am assuming that that is if the TWX merger goes through.

"Something is brewing, is it T or tea?"
"Actually, the majority of their debt is in the form of notes and debentures. About 60% of AT&T’s total debt costs between 3% to 4.99%, as per their 2019 annual report, page 73.￼￼￼ I could not tell from the annual report whether they have the ability to early pre-pay any of this debt without penalty or premium cost"

What the heck happened here? T was up a $1.32 at one point.
"$T is mismanaged Company, relative to $TMUS. It has $172,000,000,000 Debt. Cost of Debt is Huge. Current ratio is below a $1 it is a read flag, Bankruptcy bound. At&T will need to cut it's 7.30% dividend, to start paying for its debt. $T needs to restructure itself, if it wants to survive.. They need to reinvent itself. Otherwise it will collapse."
heading to red. too much bad news. b of a analyst says t price driven by bad news.
"WOW, it was actually green for about 5 minutes!"
What news is making T go up 3%+ today?
It's our money damn it!News!The only news that comes out of the monthly board of directors meeting is no dividend increase but Stankey does have a million bucks to slide across the table to Randall!
"AT&T DRIP Investor since 1981, $92K per year is what div pays me now + SS + income properties... Livin' the dream, lovin' the life, counting the blessings."

Shame on T (and VZ) leadership for letting T-Mobile steal all the positive press on 5G. Just horrible communication & leadership for both companies. They let the narrative get away.
T is on the move should be a $60 stock by July
if nancy has very large hands ....
Debt is virtually FREE. Who doesn't like FREE money anyways.
"Where, oh where, does one go for GENUINE news that you can confidently trust as being the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth these days? All I can see is propaganda in some form or other."
"AT&T offloading DirecTV To Apollo eNow, sources are saying that the Apollo offer could be exactly the type of deal that AT&T will “have to do now” in order to offload DirecTV and a portion of the debt the company is carrying.He added that there was ""no discernible benefit from the two divisions being operated under the same corporate umbrella""Based in Michigan, Jackson National is valued between $6bn and $10bn and has four million customers in the US.It is expected that AT&T will be revealing the final plan on 11 July 2020 when it published its financial results for the year 2020. The Telecom conglomerate giant declined to comment on the potential stake sale or IPO."
never pay over $29 for T. too much debt. they made awful acquisitions.
"It’s shameful how AT&T destroyed the ones mighty DIRECTV. Prior to the merger, you could call DIRECTV on the phone and a US representative would answer on the second ring. Now, under AT&T’s stewardship when you call for service or support you end up talking to someone in the Philippines who knows nothing and barely speaks English. I’m ashamed to admit that I still own lot of AT&T stock."
"I use T for my phone. My work phone also T. Debt looks good, price looks good, earnings look good. I see major economic expansion into Mexico and South America in the coming years to combat the China threat. T will grow bigly. I bought some T on Friday."
"T, always the underperformed. Nothing but a portfolio drag to anyone that owns it."
told ya. 1.50% is coming soon. 10-Yr Bond1.372%
what a great stocl
Take it easy people. Whenever a company acquires another the acquiring company’s stock price goes down initially. It’s because they are taking on debt. Happens all the time.
"The bonuses are a drop in the bucket on what Tax Reform/Bill is going to do for T and its stockholders will see there stock OUTPERFORM its past. This stock is set up to reach high 50s by the end of 2018, all along the way grabbing 2$ in a dividend as well."
If you like slow cooking pick this stock.
"AT&T dividend yield should really be around 5-5.5%, especially as they are streamlining operations and HBO Max/Warner Media is getting going, shares should be between $37-41"

"Futures not looking good,could change overnight though. Maybe back to 28.80 area tomorrow. My trigger finger gets twitchy about there!"
T finally closed above 30? It’s a saint paddy’s day miracle!
how can one find out the level of $30 strike call options expiring today? is number more than usual?
If you're in this stock for immediate growth then you're delusional. There are 1000's of better growth stocks.The upside to owning this is:1. The dividend if you're already or near retirement2. New management's focus on reducing debt and growing 5G/HBO MaxFor 2 you could be looking at years for those gains to materialize. Right now this stock is best suited for 1.

Nhsore MUTED!
obviously a computer algorithms is controlling the price the last few days
Does anyone know how long it will take to recoup the $27 Billion that T invested in the C- band spectrum? VZ invested over $40B. I don't think they would make those large investments unless the profit potential is great. I have not read anything about profit forecasts.

"Morningstar maintains $36 Fair value: 'Still attractive'Verizon and AT&T Dominate the C-band Auction, Narrowingthe Spectrum Gap Versus T-MobileAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 25 Feb 2021""The suspense is finally over as the FCC released the winners of the C-Band spectrum auction. As areminder, we cut our fair value estimates on Verizon and AT&T on Dec. 23 as auction bidding reachednosebleed levels. Fortunately, activity cooled shortly thereafter. Actual results weren’t wildly differentthan our guesses, but carrier spending was higher than we’d hoped. Verizon spent $45.5 billion versusthe $37.5 billion we’d penciled in while AT&T shelled out $23.4 billion versus our $22.5 billion projectionwith the actual amounts likely to end up $4-8 billion higher after paying to relocate existing spectrumholders. We hadn’t expected T-Mobile to participate extensively, but it still ended up spending $9.3billion, more than double our estimate.However, the three carriers also ended up with more spectrum than we’d expected as Dish Networkwon virtually nothing and cable companies Comcast and Charter (bidding jointly) didn’t win anything.U.S. Cellular and private equity firm Grain Management each spent around $1 billion, but the big threestill ended up with more than 95% of the spectrum on offer. Holding more spectrum should reducecapital spending needs, all else equal, while keeping spectrum out of the hands of upstarts shouldcontribute to competitive rationality among the three firms. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T plan to holdanalyst meetings on successive days March 10-12. The firms will undoubtedly extol their network We don’t expect to materially change our fair value estimates or economic moat ratings as a result ofthe C-band auction. We currently view AT&T ($36 fair value estimate) as the most attractive of the threewireless carriers. We believe Verizon is roughly fairly valued ($57) and T-Mobile is modestly overvalued($108). We’re happy to see Dish ($35) exercise restraint given the network buildout ahead of it, but therange of potential outcomes around this effort is large""."
Bought back the MAR 26 $29 puts I previously sold for .16 each this morning. I'll resell them again when the stock drops back.
What year was ATT at $42?
"The #1 blunder for ATT was sacrificing Western Electric, aka Lucent, to service the mobility companies only to watch those companies eat its lunch. That was over 30 years ago! Charter {Spectrum) exists today because ATT's desk jockeys had no idea and still don't."
"All the T haters are learning to SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL, Why because T's future is so bright you have to wear shades and T is now the only Large Cell Phone company you can still TRUST to protect your data. VZ has proven they CAN NOT be TRUSTED by their own actions and T Mobile is a Foreign Company with an agenda to collect data for the EU one world order to be used against American"

has that #$%$ even said anything yet about the deaths related to the capitol seige? an officer took his own life and another who was being charged as part of the mob has also taken his own life. it's unspeakable what we're witnessing. for anyone who wants to chide me for posting about politics....too effin bad.
To think people bought this believing it was a safe bet. smh.
Morning T ~ many negative reports regarding dish and some are acceptable and some are overblown. Markets are overpriced and inflation is a problem
T knocked it out of the park folks. 78k shares in pre market do not get it.I will be adding @ 7am when TD allows pre market.Verizon owned Yahoo keeps trying to push Er down the news by putting the frivolous lawsuit above more current T news such as their earnings.Look at the numbers!Look at the growth of cellular and HBO max.Verizon has to be humiliated.T and the dividend is more than safe.Long all the way!
Creepy Joe is good for my oil stocks. Thank you at&t and cnn.
If we have 2 green days in a row T longs will witness a second coming of Jesus a
"Only Bag-hold T=Trash If you truly Hate $$, there is no way to tell the market will go up tomorrow, but T will surely continue to go downhill like the past decade with $200 billions of debts on its shoulder."
"2018 is in the books! Not a good year for us price wise. But, 2019 starts the streaming wars. The massive Warner and HBO catalogs are impressive. Game of Thrones, Big Bang Theory, Friends, and the list goes on and on and on. T actually has more streaming hours of super hero shows than everyone else combined. For those of us long, let's hope the government loses the suit and T brings all the pieces together for us. The dividend is nice, but that should be icing on our cake and not the cake itself. Happy new year to all!"
Great to see all the chat about 5G and streaming.
"AT&T T, purchased the DirecTV business for $49 billion in 2015. oops."
"Takes a lot to turn this ship , but for sure the T ship is turning and going to go HIGHER and HIGHER, LOL,LOL,LOL Hope you got some shares get ready to go higher and higher , because T's future is now so bright you are going to need to break out your shades"
was looking for a little more dip to buy i am a long
You all had your last chance 2 buy in the 20 tys
Mixed bag. In a nutshell: GOOD: Subscriber growth/phone sales through the roof. HBOMax up. BAD: Guidance lower than expected by considerable amount.This likely means the stock will trade flat to down for a bit.
"All that work today by the T haters and it's still green and going higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
Down on earnings beat. Tells all you need to know about investor sentiment and inevitable downward trend T faces for the foreseeable future! Dead money or worse!
Morning T ~ interesting times we live . Dish is up to something we shall see . T ~ I won’t sell even though I don’t own much but like you to become a better company. Prime rib sandwiches for breakfast and lunch . Peace everyone
There are 3 truths in the world:1). Death2). Taxes3). Buy T under $30
"Jan 27th will be a day for the history books. HBO Max numbers coming in strong, everyone is talking about it! Plus, auction is over, what is done is done......now AT&T recouping all money  from 5G services. Plus, who knows, AT&T is wise about DTV, we can hear taking on Roku and direct TV streaming and combo packages.....like Dis+ and Hulu......it's a great way to resolve this problem. $35 coming soon"
$50 here we come

Low of the day and dropping. Why can't we WIN?
"Phil is still spewing his hate and divisiveness. If everyone acts like that, we'll never get unified. Get over it Phil, the election is over."
"Phil say nice daily chart, positive signs. Phil please enlighten me on the buy signal your seeing!"
"ATT is 7x EBITDA. It has plenty of cash flow to pay the dividend and do all capex. If they decide to pay down debt and the EBITDA multiple stays constant, the siock has to rise or the EBITDA multiple must decline. Seems unlikely it will decline. They are also doing what any rational investor would do--thye are borrowing a lot of money at record low rates and investing it at a higher rate or return. Why would thye pay off 3-4% interest rate debt. No way. therefore they will pay the dividend."
"Don't worry about Verizon though, they're going to pay off that 169 billion debt with their Discovery Plus streaming service. LOL"
"AT&T has the Pebbles Beach PGA ads all over the place, nicely done"
"$20 or below is definitely coming for T, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
"Do your job CNN and cover the Cuomo cover-up. Just embarrassing, period, & show how biased they are."
Remember one thing from this impeachment trial...The jury was filled with co-conspirators.
"Would not be surprised to see this close at exactly 28.50. Yah know, screw the option holders on both sides of the bet and only Wall Street wins."
Any investor who does not have T in their portfolio is just not thinking straight. No stock is 100% safe and very few investments are. But this is probably the best deal you can find today.
buy back and retire shares
"Just became shareholder of T for the first time of my life. 29.2 Bucks/share. I expect good numbers about HBO Max and higher data traffic due to home offices and videcalls. I am European and EUR/USD is pretty good right now. Quite a defensive stock, but I think TSLA and other rockets will have fuel leakage quite soon. In case of crysis, fall will not hurt much with boring T."
I like collecting the fat dividend.
Morning T ~ cold  in Denver. Sold Disney late 2020 probably shouldn’t have but didn’t have a big stake anyway . Go dish
anybody else looking at Friday out of the money calls?
"do you see the market manipulation after hours. No one would be attempting to sell 10 and 20 thousand share blocks in after hours , when there are no people in the market to buy them. There are two ""partners in crime"" selling and buying the same shares back and forth to each other to give the impression of movement. They are short and were caught short with the late rally and are trying to scare others into selling shares to them. They will not be attempting to do this when regular trading begins tomorrow, because they would be creamed by the real money. You will see tomorrow. Btw what they are doing is illegal , but rarely enforced in this setting because the ""police"" have gone home for the day...….."
Wall Street is dumbing VZ and trying to get in T on the cheap before the HBO MAX numbers come out .
"When you plot 5 years chart for T vs VZ, they both move in the same direction in general, except in 2018, now they move to different direction, T is going down due to debt and from the Government , VZ is going up, the biggest gap for last 20 years, eventually T will close the gap."
I had all my retirement money in T because advisors told me it was a safe haven with good yields. Amazon just ripped all my grandkids' college educations in 1-day. I'm very sad.
"At the end of Q2 T was the most shorted stock by hedge funds. At the end of Q3 it was the third most shorted by hedge funds. T is so massive, that short equaled just 1.3% of float. Shorting T and going long TMUS was a great 2020 play but it won’t work in 2021. T spent more this month at the spectrum auction than planned but so did everyone else.If there’s a sell-off tomorrow because of news, it’s probably a buying opportunity that won’t happen again next year. I’ll be adding on any dip."
"A lot of people talk about having patience with AT&T, and they seem fine with the status quo. I think these are long-time holders, retired people, who bought AT&T thirty years ago for $15 a share. Then you have bag holders who bought AT&T for over $40 back in 2016. Very different situations. I bought AT&T a few years ago in the high thirties. Like many I bought it for the dividend. I see a company that is trying to maintain and gain share in two very competitive areas: Cell phones and streaming entertainment. In addition the company is carrying an enormous amount of debt from buying Warner Bros. With regard to Cell Phones, T-Mobile and Verizon are very strong competition. When it comes to streaming media, the competition is Netflix, Disney and many others. Warren Buffet talks about investing in companies that have a MOAT. Companies that do or own something that no one else has. Buffet would never buy AT&T. It is literally the opposite of what he looks for in a potential investment. In conclusion, I've a Sell order in for thirty dollars a share. I am more than ready to take my loss and move on."
Buy the dip why you still can. T will be going higher . So all the haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes
T is the perfect stock to counter balance your performing stocks
"How much did T spend on spectrum at the last auction? Another fiasco but alt least its a fiasco that is essential to their primary business. Sadly, I'm getting ready to pull the trigger and flee. FCF is falling into dangerous territory. The board has to be considering slashing the dividend. What do you think the stock would trade at with a dollar dividend? Not a pretty thought. There is a sound business thesis to cut the current shareholders adrift by slashing the dividend and spending some of the money buying back shares at 15 bucks to goose EPS. (and management's bonus)"
Today we are testing 31  Where are the guys who said 31.75 was solid support 
"QQQ will eat a bag of d Money that doesn’t buy back into tech will go late to the party banks and oil and smarter money will go to reits and telecoms as they’re in accumulation for the end of bank season. Maybe we break the range this week or not, keep accumulating and enjoy the ride coming soon"
SEC investigation on $T price movement... finished green on continuous uptrend intraday. Unusual activity detected
Jan 28th and 29th are layoff notification days at at&t...all they're saying is that the numbers will be significantl...probably 15% of the workforce. Jan 30th is the earnings announcement day...
Just keep adding to your position. It may not be this qtr but when managements able to show the cost saving from doing this restructuring then investors will be fighting for shares.
"As Expected T continues its way to below $20, Non-stop falling knife !"
Cue the West Wing theme music.
Stock up over 2.3% this morning on heavy volume. Looks like a close easily over $31-$32.
Owning AT&T sure is a humbling experience
T raised the numbers on HBO MAX now they hope to have 120 to 125 million subs on 2025 if they hope to accomplish then they need to reconsider the price of the service
Whoa! Gotta run to the eye doctor. Something is wrong with my eyes. I look at T and I see GREEN!
"These guys can't be wrong. Vanguard, Blackrock , State Street & Newport keep adding huge T shares. These 4 inst combined added over 200 million of T shares during the 4th quarter of 2018. This quarter maybe virtually the same."
We've got the beginnings of a mini Netflix at this point. We've seen how the market valued Netflix. Why isn't anyone noticing? I know T has made some horrible decisions in the past and they have definitely impacted the share price...but how do you screw up the best streaming content rollout? This is a slam dunk investment...I just don't get why this stock is not $40 already. Forget 5G...HBO Max is the reason you buy the stock and hold it long term. This is a growth stock over the next 2-3 years.
"Great news!....In a significant upward revision, AT&T said it now expects 120 million-150 million HBO Max and HBO subscribers by the end of 2025, up from the 75 million-90 million it previously projected in the fall of 2019. Roughly half of the 2025 subs are expected to be in non-U.S. markets, Kilar said.AT&T expects HBO’s revenue to more than double over the next five years. In 2020, HBO had $6.8 billion in operating revenue — and Kilar expects that to be around $15 billion by 2025."

We have lost $10 per stock over the course of a year for $2 in dividends . Longs are bad at matching including myself
VZ and T.
what did Josh Brown say about T???
"Getting DTV off their books while still benefiting significantly from the fact that they continue pay tv as is continues to exist will little change for decades, very little innovation, the best being Dish which I've liked for years, they are more innovative and cutting edge, which is why their shares hold up and they continue to increase profits, earnings per share just reported like $1.24 vs est of around $.74-76. Which their is no reason why DTV couldn't be equally effective at reducing cost and downsizing DTV iat the appropriate ratio to actually be increasing net profit significantly"

"All the work by the T haters and T just keep going higher and higher LOL,LOL T is now the only cell company you can still trust with your data , The fact is T mobile is a foreign company and VZ just proved they can not be trusted anymore as they are no censoring Americans and Censoring what Americans can see , read and post. VZ has proven they do not protect Americans First Amendment right, VZ breaks them so for sure VZ can not be trusted with your data to protect it, VZ proved they don't even protect your First Amendment right your data means nothing to them by their own actions"
Talk about a dead end investment.
"The key point is still about 34.40; this is the 200 day moving average. Now as the 50 day moving average crosses this it becomes the bullish golden cross. you can see this can't happen for a little while, but we are building up momentum. If the earnings are good when reported on Oct 24, then it will most likely occur. It is not unusual to see an 8 to 10 % rise above the 200 day moving average which would bring us above 37. This all is certainly within the realm of reason."

"The cost of the additional spectra and associated reallocation is spread over 3-4 years.That means that a lot of it can be covered from the portion of FCF left over after paying the dividend.So the assumption that the totality of the cost is being added to debt is simplistic short bait.So far all we know is that T has obtained a short term bridge loan of 15 billion to cover the initial requirements and are working on divestitures to generate cash.At worse, they will put debt repayment on hold for the next 3-4 years to pay for the spectra.Just keep your eyes on the FCF because lots of it covers for lots of errors."
Nice stock lol.
"with a 30 dollar strike price expiring by COB today and the price being where it is, the day will be a nail biter baby! T is awesome baby! Too much?"

next week ain't any better!! Pegged at $30again.
Show me a green Friday and who knows we might break the range soon
T stock now is a falling knife! Who wants to catch a falling knife early in its downward trjectory?
"Muting vs reporting. When you mute some on this board, that persons posts are no longer visible to you. They are however visible to everyone else. Reporting eliminates the offending post, and it notifies officials at yahoo of the contents of the post. Since muting someone has such a limited overall effect on the offender, I don’t recommend it because it’s comparable to witnessing a crime and responding by closing your eyes. Not very helpful. What I would recommend is to report the offender. Under the report abuse option, (the three dots to the right of you post), you have the option of being more specific with your objections. For example, you can choose to identify the offending post as an; Inappropriate post, Does not belong here post, Looks like spam post, Copyright violation post, or Something else. Under the “something else” heading, you get to put in your own words the nature of your complaint. If someone posts something truly offence, threatening or incendiary, then it’s best for everyone that you report the offending post and not just mute it. Lots of sick people out there. Best not to give them a voice on this forum. Report them and let the authorities do their job. That’s my take on the matter."
T is a defense stock. When tech selloff/market incertainity starts. T will be stable or even go up.
$T nears deal with TPG to sell large minority stake in Dirctv Uverse
"The most uncool and unprofitable blue chip security, right next to IBM"
You have to ask yourself why is T borrowing billions more dollars and going deeper in debt? A financially strong company does not need to borrow billions. Why didn't they raise the dividend even a penny like they did last December? The writing is on the wall!
What date was T handing out dividends?
AT&T to the moon soon........ hold to you dividend
No love for T.
I see no activists taking a recent position in ATT according to 13D filings.So what you see is what you get.
Does any body here realize that AT&T is getting involved with self driving cars.
it would be refreshing if Upper Management put a pause on their bonus until debt goes from $150ish billion to $125.
The moderators for this room are dangerous.
"Sell CNN and zoom, zoom, ZOOM!"
72 months divided by a interest rate will determine how long it will take for that interest rate to return all your investment just on the dividend. ---- 72 divided by a 7% yield = 10 years.
of course this #$%$ is down
Looks like T is now the only American company left to do business with. That is why the Government pick T for the first responders . VZ has been taken over at the top by the EU and T Mobile was founded by the EU
Great manipulation by Wall Street to pick up shares of T
"AT&T's CFO expects financial flexibility and debt reduction in 2021Jan. 06, 2021 10:52 AM ETAT&T Inc. (T)By: Niloofer Shaikh, SA News EditorJohn Stephens, CFO of AT&T (T +1.1%) says significant investment in network performance with attractive wireless device pricing for new and existing customers should continue to drive migrations to unlimited plans and momentum in the company's wireless business.The company expects to generate free cash flow of $26B in 2021 with a payout ratio of 50%, built upon management's guidance of at least $26B of free cash flow in 2020.The company has refinanced more than $60B of debt at historically low rates and reduced its amount of debt coming due through 2025 by about $30B.Q4 results will be out on Jan 27."
This stock worth at least 35 here period. With dividend well worth it.
"looking forward to next quarterly report, HBO Max is definitely taking off, this same day as theatre move was very smart, they've got this great lineup for 2021 which either goes to tradition theatrical window and losses money, brings in a few million, or get that plus millions of new subscribers"
Will this stock ever cross $30 again?
"I think more people would want to invest in this company if they weren't so overbearingly political. They own CNN and all these outlets which constantly spew garbage. If they would calm down and focus on operations and future growth.. then I would be more opt to invest. Companies like AT&T, APPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB etc are way too focused on political control. They all need to calm down"
"Bag-holders continue to self pro-claimed T will rock $40 one day in their dreams which in Reality this trash is more likely to drop below $20. It was $60 @ 2000, $40 @ pre 2008, Today $20s. You see the pattern ?"
I just bought back the BP March 26 $24 Puts that I sold for .88 each on 2/26. Bought them back for .41 each and then bought an equivalent number of actual shares for $25.75 each. Once I did that I immediately sold the March 26 $26 Covered Calls for .92 each. Woo Woo On the move making money. T is doing well today too.
Looks like T is on the move. Goin UP.To DA MOON baby!!!
#1Clean up your reputation!
"Long term, holding, and buying more when dividend comes in!"
HBO Max only has 17 Million subscribers. The rest is for HBO. Not impressive.
"So funny how nflx's debt, acq costs in excess of subs revenue, piles of ebit losses, etc. were all not just acceptable but embraced as they built the company. Does it feel that hbomax gets the same treatment in its assessment within the mothership of T?? I can answer that.....the answer is NOOOO. Why? Because Randall S. put an albatross around this stock's neck with his past performance. Now we live with it. Prob will continue to for a while. I might exit. No love from anyone on this thing."
I have now lost my entire 2021 dividend payout. What gives? Word on the street believed T had too much debt. T then spends $24 BILLION. T drops 6% in 3 days.Is this a sound business decision?
"We have been in a bull market since March, and that is why people have stopped liking T. Here's why you don't sell T though....the bull market eventually stops, and then you will wish you had an income stock like T.Who knows when this bull market will stop....maybe tomorrow, maybe another year. But, you always hold on to your income stocks. By all means, go ahead and invest, or day trade in something that you think can make you quick money, just don't sell your income stocks to chase after that, cause when the bull market becomes a bear market, you will regret it, because thats when income stocks start to rise, as people who ignored them or sold them in the bull market, now want them."
AT&T bought more 5G bandwidth that TMUS. Something good cooking?
Worst company on Earth literally with the Biggest Debt Mountain on the planet at $200 Billions while the Interest rates are skyrocketing. Interest Cost will eat Trashy T Alive !
The offer to purchase notes is good news. It means that cash is king and T has the ability to pick and choose what notes to retire. Seems like they are offering the market a deal to get out of the notes and reduce unfavorable terms. This is part of the plan.
"No one get manipulated, just market stumbled due to awaiting fed news , I don’t know if it will go up in next couple days after earnings (I can’t see future) but everything looks good and I assume we’ll get to 35-40 in next 3 month . Only thing that they have to get rid of Direct TV burden ."
Red on a big green day. Again.
any predictions what is the price support of T .i want T to go down more
The dirty little secret.Population control is coming.Politicians will never talk about it.The only thing to save capitalism will be selling gimmicks and staples.Where will ATT find new opportunities?Right now its not in any growth business.It's still lumbering along.It's business plan is not finite.Nothing to get excited about.
Somebody send Stankey and his team some AT&T T SHIRTS.

Everything is fine except for Direct TV. They wrote down it's value by 15.5 billion which created an earnings loss. ($1.95 per share) Gotta find some sort of solution for that part of the business.
AT&TLOL
management did mention the resumption of stock buy backs
"My apologies to Rudy for calling him out earlier.Looks like Rudy was correct when he said T had reduced the debt to $176.5 at the end of 2018. Check page 44 of the 8-K that was filed with the SEC on Jan 30. It appears that Stephenson is already on his way to his planned debt reduction to the $150's by the end of 2019. If they do generate the expected $26 billion of free cash flow this year and they are able to sell some assets as planned, they could do it! At a minimum, assuming the $26 billion of free cash flow works out as planned, with $14 billion going to dividends, they would be able to reduce the debt by $12 more down to $164 billion from the current $176.Sounds like Stephenson is already on his way to fulfilling his promise!"
the short seller are holding it down
guys do they still pay 7% dividends??
Many are predicting that HBO Max will have a tremendous year with an outstanding line up a programming.
"T is doing good. As long as it stays above $29 by March 26 so I don't have to buy any shares, I'll be happy. So ANDY claims he muted me huh? LOL We'll see. Let's see if the creep shows up when I respond to other people's posts."
Stephens made a solid presentation today
Anyone get their 29.50 covered calls called away?
Did they disclose the HBO Max subs?

T Mobile is not even an American company, TMUS was founded by the EU to collect data on the USA to farther the EU's one world order so for sure they can not be trusted to protect American's data ,"
Happy New Year T ~ still in twenties for the year :) lol dish going higher and tacos for snacks
ATT guidance for 2021 is what's holding down the price. Let's hope they were sandbagging and Warner/HBO outperforms greatly in the 2nd half. 1% growth was projected for 2021 and that's just a measly 1.7 Billion dollars more. Some companies would dream to earn just this increase as their total income for a year!
Call options are so cheap is there anything that can move this stock
"Don't you just love the big fat juicy dividend that T pays each quarter? Borrow a million dollars, put it on T, and the dividend covers the interest with plenty left over for you. It's a no brained. Live free of charge with no need to work or worry."
Anybody use T to park cash for the divvy until they see an opportunity to pounce on a growth stock or real estate deal?
If you bought T anytime in last 5 years you are still underwater!This sub is about to dive deep and run quite soon.
It's no wonder the stock of a company that owns CNN is constantly bleeding and becoming increasingly irrelevant. Selling this dumpster fire as soon as I get anywhere near even.
Possible income investors are bailing VZ and moving into T?
"Bought some @ $29.48 this Am. Divvy will be announced within days and once the ""weary"" see it's coming they will pile in and buy buy buy. Easily push the price back up to $33 in a matter of few days. That might not mean alot to an Appl/Msft investor but $3 swings up are great for current environment and where T is with debt payoff. This stock under -$30 is an absolute steal. When I was shorting T I loved the price $29.50 cause I'd buy and hold it for sometimes less then a week and make 1k flipping or more. I'm not a hedge fund just tryin to turn $1 outta you guessed it .15 cents. I got a long position now and not getting a board seat but I do well on shares accumulate and just let em sit. T long!"
The ARK gal is no fan of T. Why? She seems to question the div.
T is finally zooming and nothing but crickets on the board. Do I have to start talking politics again?!
RUT RO........After HoursTIMMMMMMMMBER !
"For a FACT , T is no VZ , because T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades , VZ has no future because more massive debt and no way to pay for it because VZ is losing customers to T's monster new Cell Plans with FREE HBO MAX , All of T's new customers will help pay for any debt T takes on for spectrum , VZ is losing customers and does not have that choise , Look for VZ to have to cut their dividend next year because Han's is driving VZ into the ground and running off customer and shareholders with his EU one world order Yahoo CENSORING NATZI's T will just take more and more customers from VZ"
seven days straight +. By the way when a stock gives a div that amount is subtracted from the price the next day. It is simply money the company used to have that now is in the hands of the stock owner. It is more noticeable in T because the div is so large. So if you own the stock you did not lose that money. It is already in your pocket. But stock is still way under valued. So if you missed the great discount don't hold back it is still a good buy. Not too many stocks that will give you 7% a year plus a very probable 15% in stock price if not more.
T has billions of dollar in debt. almoset 100 billion dollars in debt. this stock should be down. fair value should be 25 dollars [er share. this is way overvalued.
"All the T Haters worked so hard to get T lower and T just keep going HIGHER and HIGHER. Do you know why , because T's future is now so bight you have to wear shades , T is the only American Cell Phone company you can still TRUST to protect your data. T Mobile is a foreign Company setup by the EU to collect data on the USA and use it against them to farther the EU's one world order. VZ is a disaster they have proven VZ can not be trusted to even protect your First Amendment rights, even worse VZ has proven they will break your First Amendment rights , By their own actions of CENSORING Americans and CENSORING what you can see, read and post. For sure if you CAN NOT Trust VZ to protect your First Amendment rights you CAN NOT TRUST VZ to protect any of your data, VZ has proven they CAN NOT be TRUSTED by their own actions. FACTEven the Government knows and had to more the First Responders to T's network because T was the only Company that could be trusted to help protect the American people."

"Too bad that the broader market is down, AT&T could be up ""bigly""."
WOW! Are the Reddit players jumping on the T bandwagon?
"There is a real disconnect going on. Apple stock is priced at a PE of 23:1 and staying high, yet everyone is talking about no one paying their cell phone bill. Either some stocks are going to get hammered soon or the idea of an economic depression is overdone. I'm not saying T is in the best debt position at this point, but the dividend should be safe for 6 months unless this gets really bad in which case the Dow will be at 10,000 and portfolios will be crushed. There is no way Apple will sell even 300M Iphones if people aren't paying their cell phone bill. Yet I don't see that kind of reaction in those stocks. Most tech stocks, even consumer tech, is holding up better than the general market. But, people will be far more likely to pay a cell phone bill than to buy a new cell phone. So at this point, the sell-off in T is an over reaction in comparison to other stocks, but that doesn't guarantee anything. Maybe their sell-off is coming if the consumer suffers for longer than a few months. The question is more basic. Will governments continue down this path even in the face of massive unemployment? I thought the objective was curve flattening, not avoiding every case. So you would think in a few weeks that we would return to normal, whatever that normal is. At that point, it's on each person to decide their own risk tolerance. But I know Americans and we are risk-takers in general, so I doubt we suffer a depression and have bread lines. It will be more likely that anyone over 65 stays home and the rest of society carries on and some take more chances than others. So T will be fine and although a little bruised, will be paying the same dividend they always pay."

"Morningstar finds 'T' attractive:Analyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 27 Jan 2021""AT&T’s fourth-quarter financial results weren’t great, but the firm is making progress in several areas,notably postpaid wireless and HBO Max. As with Verizon yesterday, AT&T’s inability to discuss the Cband spectrum auction is frustrating. Management cryptically promised to provide revised debt leverage targets after the auction concludes. While we don’t harbor concerns about AT&T’s balance sheet at this point, this uncertainty is not welcome, given the attention investors have paid to the debt load. AT&T ended 2020 with about $10 billion in cash and also reportedly lined up more than $10 billion in available credit earlier this month. As of now, we are sticking with our estimate that AT&T will spend around $20 billion for additional spectrum. Our fair value estimate remains $36, and we believe the stock is attractive. Postpaid net phone customer additions at AT&T (800,000 versus 279,000 at Verizon and 824,000 at TMobile) were impressive for the second consecutive quarter, likely reflecting relatively aggressive phone promotions. Management again made the case for this activity, highlighting its desire to strengthen relationships with existing customers. The percentage of AT&T customers upgrading phones was the highest in three years, and we estimate the carrier has closed the gap with Verizon in terms of customers using newer devices. But this effort has come at a cost: Phone and commission expenses pulled wireless segment EBITDA down 6% year over year despite 0.5% services revenue growth. We expect AT&T will be able to dial back promotions as 2021 progresses, though it indicated it hopes to continue driving customer growth. At Warner, the firm ended 2020 with nearly 42 million U.S. HBO Max subscribers, up 3.5 million during the quarter. The premier of Wonder Woman 1984 clearly had the desired effect on customer interest.HBO and a strong ad market couldn’t offset weak studio results, however, with total WarnerMedia revenue down 10% year over year""."

BP on the move again. Up another .36 to $24 this morning. I don't know if I'm going to catch a break with this one. I'd like to see a big Red day in the Oils to boost those Put premiums so I can sell March 26 Puts. That's the goal. Let's see what happens.
I want to sell this. It DOES NOT MOVE. Basically a savings account with a good interest payment.

JPM raised TSLA price target to 105. HaHa.
The board of directors should fire Randall Stephenson. ATT paid $48.5 billion for direct tv. The stock price has not improved since this purchase. Now ATT buys HBO for $108.7 billion. I have no confidence that ATT will profit from either of these purchases. I would suggest that ATT spins off their mobile business. The fact of the matter is that ATT is a telecom services company NOT a content company.
i bought some earlier 5.7 percent dividend looks good to me
A little green is better than a little red.
"Make sure to buy T today to be qualified for the dividend. Guaranteed 7% yield, plus capital gains on stock to $40 most likely within a year. You can get rich safe & easy by just reinvesting your dividends into more T purchases. Or, you can lose all your wealth by investing in nonsense like Bitcoin and watch it crash eventually."
"Wells Fargo downgrade was based on total baloney, the entertainment Landscape can eventually help this company. Total speculation without warrant"
I have to thank ANDY for reminding me of BP. I hadn't thought of that one for awhile until he brought it up again. The oils are looking strong and they should have a good year with the pandemic slowing down. Selling those March 26 $22.50 Puts at .99 per share is looking like great trade.
"WOW it was another great day in T land as T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX took even more customers away from both VZ and T mobile yesterday .

"AT&T needs to raise its dividend to 23.5% , the price decline in the last year"
"I am what Happened I told you it was coming all you T haters LOL,LOL Why because T's future is so bright you are going to need shades LOL,LOL Hope you don't owe any VZ because VZ has no future and will be going from best of breed to out right disaster LOL,LOL,LOL"
"With all the big investing behind it, the 5g rally, the dividend, the paying back of debt and the low stock price equals a stock investors want to buy"
Amazon buys a $1B pillpack and market thinks it'll wipe out traditional retail. T buys a $85Billion TWX at discount and Netflix stock remains unchanged.The market logic is strong.
Where are all of the pumpers? The $40 by next week guys.
I love my CNN. CNN is the ministry of truth. The summer riots were a peaceful protest while the January 6 protest was the crime of the century. Thank you CNN for doing a wonderful investigative journalism. We need more honest news media like you.
"VZ has moved 21% in the past 30 daysT has moved 13% in this same 30 days Look for T to close this gap by years end. As long as VZ holds its position, you will see T make a run to 40."
"OMG BP is up .70 to $26.00 per share. It was just $15 a couple of months ago. The oils are on the move.In the meantime, the ""safe harbor"" T is dropping like a rock."
"Selling CNN would see ATT through this cash crunch. There is a cash crunch! Labor contracts are approaching extension dates.Maybe the 13 board of directors should forego their $140,000 salaries for a year,Problem is the latest analyst meeting shows the love affair this company has with CNN.There's very little left that ATT can monetize.More downgrades are going to come if Telephone can't get its house in order.The spectrum auction was a body blow."
"Stocks with new up cycles or up cycles starting and should have a very good year .T should pay you better than just about anywhere you can park your money and has upside in the stock as 5G is rolled out as they leverage HBO MAX to take business from it's competition as T's 5G monster grows.PFE you want to start buying the dips because a new long term up cycle is starting soon plus it pays over 4% just to own the stockVTRS can more than double this year and will start paying a dividend around 5-6% at the price the stock is trading at today , Insiders are buying and know it has big upside"
AT&T is now obligated for the legacy costs of not only ever phone company they acquired but legacy Time Warner and Legacy Direct TV employees. I know..not to worry...those retirement plan investments are soaring. No worries.
Maybe the meeting will greet us with 25 billion more debt on purchase of band sale??????
"the consensus seems to be Republicans will hold Senate, but I don't see the polling that reflects this in GA race?"
"Added more, buy under $29.... drip divy and just relax... 5g and entertainment group in long run will drive share price higher , yes there are high flyers out there, but as a part of your portfolio T can have a solid place"
end corp welfare!!
AT&T has a lot of debt that will take years to overcome. With that said the company is in a lot of great businesses and it's going to perform well over the next few years. They will pay down some very inexpensive debt and continue to turn out these dividends and at some point the price is going up. Maybe not 20% a year but at some point this is a $40 stock in the next 3 to 5 years my humble opinion.

"The sun came up again, so I knew T would be under performing the market..."
"AT&TElliott/Singer probably exited at 32.70, lol."
"I recently bought T and it is the single largest individual stock purchase I have ever made. I generally am well diversified with this one exception. Here is why: The P/E ratio is 6.7 with a forward P/E ratio of 9.24. As of 3/25/18, the average P/E ratio for the S&P was 23.6. This to me represents deep, deep value. Also, the payout ratio is only 41.39%. This indicates a sustainable dividend. The average dividend yield on the S&P 500 as of 3/25/18 was 1.99%. T at $32.00 is 6.25%. If T is down 10% in one year from now, which I think is highly unlikely, you will only lose 3.75% on your investment because of the dividend. However, there are many more reasons for it to go much, much higher from here. I am a 72 year old retired stockbroker and former member and broker/trader of the Chicago Board of Trade, The Chicago Mercantile Exchange & the CBOE. I consider this a good investment on a risk reward basis."

"I bought Disney at $78.00 and just held on. It doesn't pay a Dividend like AT&T and doesn't have HBO Max..But I held it anyways and still do. AT&T is superior in everyday. I would like to see more marketing from AT&T on the HBO Max side because as a person like you, it's #1 and Netflix or Disney can't compete with it. AT&T needs better marketing for HBO Max because it is fantastic  but until people know about it, it's a hidden gem."
I sold 30 put contracts at strike 28.
"When a stock (T) or the market is out of favor, good news is viewed as bad and bad news is viewed as terrible. Despite the earnings, holders of T should be thankful the stock did not tank. To get a multiple like other streaming services, T will have to spin off WarnerMedia."
Hello you old time longs can you have a word to your grandkids about putting T on the Reddit stock forum .Tell them the inheritance will be far greater
I seems that there are huge bids on 5G freqs and loans will grow. Maybe companies will need to release corporate bonds to cover the cost....

"No dividend cut - the dividend will be “sustained”. -“Financial Flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital allocation plan to: grow customer relationships across 5G wireless, fiber and HBO Max; sustain the dividend at current levels; reduce debt; and monetize non-core assets. Stephens expects that free cash flow after dividends, plus funds anticipated from the video transaction and other asset monetizations would give the company flexibility to reduce debt following the recent spectrum auction”"
"""Overall, the Street has a Hold consensus rating based on 6 Holds, 5 Buys, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $31.67 implies upside potential of about 9.5% to current levels.

"Figured out why everyone is so upset this morning. You probably watched ""The little things"" like I did too over the weekend. Blockbuster WB movie it isn't.

"All the T haters are starting to learn how to SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"I am a long time holder of T. I have to face facts staring me in the face that T is a dog. When T was denied TMUS and had to pay 6 billion, Stephenson should have been canned. Instead, he buys Direct TV that lost probably 45(?) billion. I fear HBO Max was late to the party in pandemic viewing/subscription. Now T has to overpay billions in 5G auction. Lots of wishful thinkers here, including me."

Why 1.9Trillion. Why not a nice round number like 2Trillion. These politicians think they are wallmart $9.99 so that people think its NOT $10.

If all the analysts predict a price of 37 (even those that find fault with T) so how is it not a buy. They are saying it is almost a sure bet of a 20% gain (including the div). My own guess is will hit 37 pretty quickly and in 12 months will be 43. And if there are any good surprises from the merger who knows where it will go.

"T-Mobile added another 1.7 million postpay subs in the quarter. 5.6 million new over the last year. T-Mobile’s good news over the last few years has consistently been followed by bad news from AT&T. I don’t see any way out of the downward spiral for AT&T. T-Mobile can always out compete T on price. Like VZ, TMUS can partner with great content providers without the risks inherent in owning. And then there is the undeniable liability that comes from owning CNN. Eventually T’s debt may be inflated away. For now it’s an anchor on a sinking ship."

Unfortunately, this transition will still just be a blip on the balance sheet."

too many years of bad T management and bad T CEO decisions - don't expect this stock to move up for a long time. just like PFE; keep collecting the divvy and come back in 5-7 years. it's gonna take that long for T to pay down enough debt for investors to move back into the stock with confidence. T-mobile kicked T's #$%$ and that's just the way it goes.

AT&TWow. CFO Stevens' statement sure makes it look like the dividend is frozen indefinitely.
Fun fact: Plot T vs SPY from Jan 2019 to present. What you'll see is T tracked SPY up until Mar 2020 crash. Then they diverged. SPY came roaring back and gained way over 50%. T went sideways. What happened to break that tracking? What did T do to get left behind? Who's got an answer?
"All the T haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL Why because T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades"
This is the ram up to earnings. Brace for rear entry.
How many customers fled in Q4? HBO gains do not make up for postpay subs fleeing. T-mobile gains are usually at the expense of another provider. Is not raising the dividend a sign of things to come.

"So, looking to Invest just for the dividend. Is this a good opportunity? seems like the price is low, may hold, div is increased basically every year. So, a good buy? let's start the conversation."
YEARS.........Lost Opportunity Money.......MARKET UP 400%........T Has LOST Value !
VZ gave itself a nice boost. But what people forget is that it is way up from a year ago so I am not sure how much of a higher price it can support. T on the other hand is so beaten down that there should be a lot more potential for the upside. It will depend on analysts to an extent. If they do the usual and say yes earning were great BUT maybe this will go bad etc. then it will take some real surprises to get this baby to continue up.
more pain in my chip stocks. ouch #AMD. should've bought safe ole T
About Capital Ratio- Anything with a ratio below 1 means obligations for the year ahead are dangerously suspect.Probably why Telephone begged to extend workers contracts.Don't let this company keep spinning yarns.
"The T share will not take off until they have new management. The previous CEO is now chairman, and the new CEO has many, many, many years in T so don't expect any renewal of the company. It has become an old dinasoar with good dividen. Nothing more. Also, the just got new financing, at a rate between 5 and 6 percent, and are happy about it. To me, that interest rate level, for a company as well know, etc, as T, seems very expensive. Don't expect much growth in share price. Just enjoy the dividends."
"Att is losing more and more subscribers year over year. October they announced they are basically abandoning their DSL customers which is the vast majority of their internet subscribers. Fiber optic line expansions are now being done incrementally as the original install was done on agreement with the government. They are facing much better competition and will continue to lose subscribers to the cable companies and in their rural markets possibly to Starlink. Their Direct TV acquisition was a terrible fiasco. To me the future is internet and if you surrender the internet, you surrender main avenues of growth and sustainment."
I think Buffett trimming on Apple and buying dividend stocks $VZ and $CVX might start a new rotation trend. Trim high-flying tech and move them to dividend stocks.
You missed a golden opportunity to sell $30 Covered Calls today for great premiums when the stock was $29.70 today. Do you realize you could have made more than the dividend in ONE day? AYE
I feel very positive about AT&T. 2 stocks I feel positive about are AT&T and ExxonMobil...I really feel good  these companies.
This is a $60 stock all day. Just keep buying until then
"Man ATT borrowing 14 more Billion, Dont know about T, beginning to scare me !"
T is a great buy ahead of earnings. HBO MAX is knocking it out of the park. You will be surprised. There main business (cellular) is going to beat too.
Have you seen the Barrons article that has an analyst rating TMUS as a buy and T as a sell. He talks about TMUS growth. I was wondering how long it will take TMUS to go from about 20B EBITDA to about 55B EBITDA like ATT. I can't understand T being a sell with their p/e and cash flow. Who pays these analyst?
"Thanks titus......but even Warren Buffett makes mistakes- and owns up to them....like his IBM bet, among others.If T was just a cell phone company, like TMUS- I'd be more concerned than I am in owning this right now- but I have to believe that their diversification into the media world- and in companies that are showing profits- will eventually prove profitable for us shareholders when we do sell our shares. But for now- many on here are happy to live off the attractive dividend it has been paying- which it does have earnings to do so, and can well afford to.I don't see any chance of a dividend cut- which keeps a floor under this......unless people give up their cell phones- and stop watching Direct TV and cable (HBO, CNN, etc.)None of us have crystal balls- and we do know that the big fund managers run the markets with their programmed trades and algorithms. All we can hope is that companies that are profitable- in markets where there is a need- are worthy of our invest-able dollars. Some posts on boards like this can scare the %&*# out of some people, when stocks are going south- myself included-but I find that in stepping back- letting the gamblers do their thing- and just remembering that I am in this for years- not days- and that the stock isn't going down due to the company losing money- or being in a declining industry- is often the best, and calming thing to do. I admit to watching this too closely- like many do.....because I do have probably too much of my future retirement dollars in it-but I like the direction they are going. Let's see if I can stop watching this so closely- I doubt I can....it's just human nature to be concerned about your money. And let's hope the merger announcement comes sooner than later. Here's to seeing Green numbers in the future!"
This is some stock lol.
High volume buying early. Too iffy on chasing or waiting a few days
"Come on guys. What happened to ""We're on our way to $34"" and ""The shorts are running scared""? Could we please get some consistency here? I'd like to know if I should, 1. Back up the truck, 2. Get on the train before it leaves the station, or 3. Stay home and watch T do what it always does.......Have a couple of decent days and then drop back again. This is T, the $28 - $32 stock, not some stock that's going to grow. Unless you decide to either sell Puts or Covered Calls to supplement the dividends, the best you can expect is your .51 per quarter dividends while hoping that the stock doesn't drop more."

"serious question: What is the structure of the debt?I mean, short-term loans or long-term?What is the interest rate? Fixed or variable?How will rising long-term rates (and short-term rates) effect T?I would like to jump into this stock but rising rates concern me because of the large debt."
How do you spell margin call? GME that’s how. Those holders are the definition of “diamond hands” btw check out the fundamentals on GME then count up the share price and stop when you get up to over 300
"Friday option, Now we can go higher next week , So all the T haters better to get ready to SAY OH NO up T goes . LOL,LOL"
Dont be fooled by green pre mkt. Remember Lucy and Charlie Brown.
T and LUMN are buys. VZ and TMUS are sells. Enjoy!
"You know one of the biggest differences between T and VZ. T has CNN and you just don't have to watch it you can change the channel , VZ and their Yahoo NATZI are censoring what you can see and read even their own shareholders and customers . Not just on VZ stock post but all the stocks . Big difference very big difference"
Sad day for USA . I really didn’t care either way on the election wanted to be fair as possible however. Stock markets are extremely overpriced which is good for my pocket but do think it’s overplayed and priced
I just don’t see T going above $30 this year unless Covid 19 is extinguished. If you want to invest in T then you need to develop a swing trade strategy utilizing both the common and options
"I made $100K+ last year selling T Puts. If the market manipulators want to keep a cheap T stock down, then I'm going to make money from it."
"We will see Mon. if T's recent moves were a flight to safety ahead of the G20. Meanwhile stock is soaring(for T), news articles are getting positive, and only .79 from a 52 wk high. Oh yeah a .51/share dividend getting locked in in about 10 days."
"T has many ways to lower it cost with all it's assets to drive customers to T . From Free HBO Max to drive cell phone sales to Free HBO Max and sell ads, T now has massive upside just takes time to build all the income streams and take all the customers from T mobile , VZ and NFLX As long as they get you to pay for something they can give away things to you. It's the Amazon model for telecom . Drive the rest into the ground by taking away their customer because they do not have the asset to compete"
"All the T haters better learn to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
AT&T is a very good long term investment.
When will T go woke and replace Lily with a person of color? State Farm did it with Jake.
"Close @ $29.00 today,imo. glta"
"someone asked me for proof when I said it will hit $30 before ex dividend. now if you can't read simple charts, company financials and fundamentals, you shouldn't be investing."
*AT&T IS SAID TO SEEK $14 BILLION LOAN FROM BANKS FOR SPECTRUM
"This market is still drumpf drunken grossly overpriced. This tech bubble will burst like all others. If you own one or more of the two dozen stocks that are insanely overpriced, you should seize this opportunity to raise cash, or park investments in value stocks like AT&T. AT&T has survived every bubble burst for the last 100 years."
nobody can predict the low but this point in the market could be a gift......gl
"Good ole' Jack Dorsey finally shaved off his Go tee and starts looking like a Respectable tech person instead of a vagr. Yeah since your stock lost $10 basically in 4 days and everyone is closing their accounts. What did you Expect was going to Happen, Jack?"
Scotch X T folks ~ lol . Hearing LAST chance to get T b4 30 . Funny . 29 and b~ low next week . Scallops 4 dinner
"THIS is why I cancelled DRIP. Take the cash, then re-invest after the fake run-up on Div Pay Day. Be patient...wait a week or so."
Not too late to pick up some preferred shares if you're interested. +/- 5%.
"Ya know, even if T reports in line numbers and its commentary is neutral, the stock should really move given this interest rate environment and the Fed comments today. All you have to do is take this to a 5.5% yield, and it gets the stock to 37. And as long as the market believes the div is completely safe and T will pay down debt diligently, there's no reason it shouldn't move the yield down (stock up)."
"Did anyone receive T dividend today? I have not received mine from TD. The payout day should be Feb 1, right?"
"My understanding that 10G, which is coming down the road, will be more secure!"
"Split leg golden Zebra pattern detected, possible upside +$6"
"Im fine with $T being a bank account for me. The free cash flow nearly doubles the amount of total dividends paid. Its safe.Based on its last 5 yr FCF, fair value with a 10 P/E is $32ish. I am happy buying in the mid/high 20's and trimming in the mid 30's.Rinse and repeat."
"Hype and hope keeps this thing afloat. Until there is real earnings growth three Q’s in a row, all we will see is a narrow trading range. The dividend is sucking equity out of the stock at this rate and stocks are not called equities for no reason."
Do people realize that $2000 payments is not something the Govt people pay out of their own pockets? Its the peoples money that the FED is printing.
Remember to place long term good to cancelled sell orders of $60 to start or any higher price you want for your shares
Already barely holding in green. The new T ads on tv with Lily hiding behind a desk are boring. Why even have her in an ad if going to hide that beauty. Also saw a T Mobile ad. Very impressive .
Why is ATT getting out of government contracting?Can't compete?
it's too bad cheetah doesn't get comp'd for every thumbs down he gets.
"Cheetah,I sold my shares on Jan 7 for $30. It went ex-dividend on the 8th and I bought my shares back for $28.90 and sold $30 strike calls expiring tomorrow. If it doesn't get called (doubtful), I'll sell cov. called expiring in late March. I want to be able to sell my shares the day before it goes ex-dividend next timeI plan on repeating the same trade again right before they go ex-dividend in early AprilGood luck I see things improving in the 4th quarter and I'll change my strategy depending on how the outlook for Covid-19 shapes up."
"Five members of the Texass ERCOT (energy) board resign in disgrace. All acknowledging the failures of the board to oversee, regulate, and prepare the power provider and infrastructure for redundancy and resilientcy. Catastrophic failures in the natural gas distribution infrastructure lead to widespread electrical outages that resulted in blackouts, brownouts, sanitation failures, fires, and deaths. None of the resigning members of ERCOT lived in the state. I'll say that again, none of the ERCOT board members that resigned lived in Texass."
if u buy today do u get dividend on Feb 1st?
"Don't whine about share price being too low. The dividend payout ratio is just over 50% so the dividend is secure, therefore just hope it goes down even further and load up."
Last chance <30
"Wow closed above 30, I’m definitely having a beer tonight."
CEO should leave now.
What a stock right here lol.
T is caught in the VZ updraft.
"Well, guess my 30 dollar covered call will expire worthless once again. Guess ill keep doing this until I lose my 3300 shares. Its been fun using that premium money to buy many shares of other stocks. Anyone else doing the same thing?"
"The oils are hot today. Wait until things really open up. Oil has been suppressed for so long it's like a loaded spring getting ready to unload. Back up the boat boys, the plane is about to leave the station."
If this stock were a horse it would be on it's way to the glue factory.
T will do well to hold $29.00 tomorrow. glta 
I have accidentally made Ts dividend with leftover AMC shares (50 x 2 accounts) overnight... lol
amazing how robust this market is given the situation at the Capitol. wow!
Fox News just called the election for Biden.
Does anybody think the merger will be approved?
My compliments to Yhoo for putting back up my post on the $15 and hour minimum wage. One small step forward for free speech.
"So I am admittedly not extremely well versed when it comes to investing, but I am and have been long in T for quite a while now. I will hang onto it for the dividends for years to come I believe. Could someone please explain to me why we want to see an increase in the stock price as long as the dividend is holding? I reinvest all of my dividends for now, so would it not be better for someone who is doing that to hope the price stays level or just slightly grows, so they can DRIP more shares at a higher dividend rate? Maybe I am missing something here. Thanks in advance."
Heard years ago Walmart was interested in DTV well before the T merger so wouldn’t be surprised
I look forward to the day T succeeds with all this new technology and I can tell Comcast to stick it.
Att could do all kinds of things to spike the stock price but I think they like low volatility. If they had an Elon musk the stock would be 10x higher in a year.
I try to help you guys out...MB 11 days ago$T conversationMARA is the next AMCYW
"15 states have removed the mask mandate, Texas is only the most recent one. 108 migrants have tested positive for COVID and they were put on buses heading to who knows where."
T stock is a dead stick...where are the company share buybacks to support shareholder value???
Am planning on buying 500 shares in the coming weeks
Bottom is in on t stop fighting it mms sheesh
T stock clearly is in a strong downward trend for the next few months at least.
Theree chinese TELCO companies are delisted from NYSE. You might experience some growth.
"Look at that dividend go, haha."
"Director buying, linkhttps://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/732717.htm"
I view T as a bond with a 5 year maturity. I did buy some more this week. Just a little 500 shares to round out my holdings to 4000. Now I am done with this.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. This thing will flop just like it always does.
"Read a whimsical article, today calling long holders chickens. Well ok ,so what cluck cluck. T, Dividend's quarterly thus far although reduced due to current world constraints. Refinanced debt at lower rates.The next major event for AT&T will be the results of the C-band spectrum auction. Weexpect the results to come in the next month or so, and this will likely impact the stock.We expect AT&T to spend ~$20bn, which will increase its leverage, but with only ~$4bnof short-term debt on the balance sheet as of 12/31, we believe the company has thefinancial capacity to de-lever relatively quickly. Major Analyst review."
Whata stock lol.
"a green ticker day. I cannot believe my eyes, miracles do exist."
"Let me guess, up pre market, down at close."
Tmobile Vz T 1 to many market share isnt infinite
"Wonder Woman 1984 up to $142.5 million box office receipts world wide. $107 million internationally. It cost $200 million. Only been out for a little less than 4 weeks. It's going to make a profit when you add in merch sales and DVD sales, HBO Max subscriptions and all that."
I thought stankey did a great job on CNBC interview. was well spoken and didn't dodge tough question about dividend. he has a clear plan is bullish about adding HBO max subscribers.
Just picked up 5000 shares of #$%$ heading up?
That was a straight line down today when the DOW is up 300
"I started my T buying at ~31.5 a little over 6 months ago. From selling high and buying low everyday, I finally got down my APPS into the $26 range. Next goal the $25 range."
"I have been watching AT&T for years. First time buyer today. They have great synergy and potential for upside is significant. HBO Max is great. Don't have to go to theaters, which has become more and more unpleasant."
VZ up 1.43% today now.
"T is a disgrace to retail investors for over a decade, Unless you simply hate $$. Don't bag-hold this Titanic !"
The auction for C band must end to stop this slide for T and VZ. It was supposed to end yesterday but apparently the FCC is trying to cripple the industry and has extended it indefinitely. They should look at what a similarly scorched option in Europe did to their communications. Once the companies were drained of funds by the auction they had precious little available left to fund the networks which still remain crippled today.I thought that Ajit Pay was a smart guy but I'm now having doubts on that assessment.Sucking ever last drop from the lifeblood of a very essential industry to give politicians more money to spend is not smart.
Tindad muted.
Question for the board. Does anyone know if a company can buy call options on their stock after they have announced a stock buyback?
see if it holds 27.50
Stock pays dividend Feb 1. That means stock must go up so reinvestment pays higher price￼ Happens all the time
32$ headed to 45$ then to 60$. You heard it here first.
T is a CD stock. Should be in everyones portfolio for stability. Not for trading.
Third party Investigation of att governance is becoming necessary. Almost criminal neglect of shareholder interests. Criminal incompetence is apparent. Instutional big shots out there turn the screws on att please
Downtrend still intact. Elliott bump long gone. Stankey pimple burst. HBO Max dud. WW84 flop. CNN still stewing sewage. The only thing going up is mismanagement and their compensation.
"nice to see T up. been a T stockholder for 8 years. T goes up and T goes down (where have I heard that before?) but the dividends keep on coming. to all on this chat room, I hope the best for you. keep a good thought, all."
huge insider buying at T
this company should be at this price 3 years ago ....
"I told you to learn to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
Big Tech is showing how much political power they have. They need to be curtailed and put on a leash. The DEMS will do it.
"Netflix ConcernsAs more and more media giants enter the space, the more content will be pulled from Netflix's thinning library. Netflix's savvy management has been hedging against this unfortunate development, spending billions on original content for almost a decade, but this may not be enough. Netflix knew they had to catch up to its impending competitors' deep content libraries, and they will continue to rely on original productions to maintain subscribers.The global pandemic was both a blessing and a curse for Netflix. The enterprise was forced to shut down all production in North America until it is deemed safe to launch again (very uncertain timeline). Netflix's pipeline of new content is drying up, and many subscribers have watched everything (worth watching) on the platform.Disney, NBCUniversal, and WarnerMedia have decades of original video content at their disposal and do not need to rely on new productions nearly as much as Netflix. These three media giants could sit on their enormous libraries for years and still keep viewers entertained. This is a concerning thought for someone holding NFLX at 70 times forward earnings.There has been an enormous amount of growth priced into NFLX, and I wouldn't be surprised if investors begin pulling profits off this COVID winner following its earnings tomorrow night, regardless of the results."
So many people bashing on yahoo finance. I like T and I have bought more ever trading day for some time. Dividend is nice and I grew up using AT&T.
After the next Dividend I am out.￼
Will go up into ex dividend date. Next year this will be a big winner
Short interest appears to have declined. Only 1% of float. used to be north of 2%72M share shorted
"So $20.78 in divy in last 10 years.....hmmmm, so price may have stayed the same but we are making money."
When are they going to start buying back shares to drive the price up?
With our without Time Warner T is worth $32+
Who said silver was a buy?
Why T is higher is T's future is now so bright you will need to wear shades as the 5G monster T has built feeds on the competition and GROWS
Looks like T wants to hit 30 very badly!
Today was only the beginning. Investors will look past the biased media/analysts and their hate for T and have to recognize how good HBO Max content really is. $40 soon.
"AT&THey Larry, bro, many institutions have to exit positions in non-Aristocrats. If they don't raise it by November, many will have to exit.Thanks ""bro""."

"You people should forget about the share buy backs,it wont help the price of the stock or eps. that much with all the shares the company has outstanding.T should pay down debt with any extra money they have.This is the only way you will see any capital gains in the stock of this company for the time being."
"As Inequality and homelessness increase in the U.S, there will be more riots. Eventually a civil war and Revolution.The more that the FED prints, the more inequality it drives. Nothing that the FED can do now."

That is about as un American as VZ can be .NO ONE in America should be doing any business with T Mobile because it's a Foreign company with a EU one world order Foreign agenda or the Communist Company that VZ has become ."
is the dividend at risk?
T is like investing in a bond with a little more upside
You know it will close sub $30...Has no legs
get used to T being a $28-29 stock with a 7% dividend. that's not so bad. maybe by late 2021-2022 will be a $30-32 stock.
"thumbs up if you plan to spend money at a gump resort in the next 12 monthsif so, how much (buying a MAGA hat doesn't count)"

"Having HBO on DTV and The mirror service of HBO MAX on Apple TV has never been better time in my 30 years of subscribing to a Time Warner services... I took all the money I saved on overprice Popcorn, treats and over price movies tickets.... and put those funds towards a 65” Sony Oled with premium Bose sound system.... I will never go to the Movie theater again... I made this decision way before Covid19.... Movie theater are not doomed... but let’s face the facts... even if HBO MAX stops playing new releases on the same day as movie theater.... I’ll still be able to watch movie’s in my home in less then 90 days... To bad Movie pass did not start up this year... That said.. Theater are going to offer a business model similar big Three streaming services ... They really have no choice... but what to do about overpriced popcorn??? Because Cord cutters will become big screen cutters, for sure... Then the RESULTS WILL be CapX spending will be budget down to nothing and theater will become broken down strip malls, and new structures are likely not going to be built for the masses .. Be sure watching at home or wherever on your phone, table and/or laptop is the future..."
I am crying deep inside.
T always fades in the afternoon
"Street has no faith in management. Huge salaries, extremely poor stock performance. CEO couldn't sell 10 dollar bills for 9 dollars, let alone sell a vision to wall st."
"But it pays that lovely dividend, hahaha."
"Just make sure you pick up your shares on any pull backs and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start or any higher price you want for them . T goes ex dividend the week of April 5-9 just make sure you have gotten your shares so you don't miss out on the dividend. Then sit back and collect the dividends at T just keeps going higher and higher over time . You have to hold one year to lock in capital gains ,"
Is this a good play long term for divedent stocks. Seems like dividends would buy me free stocks each year
"Calling on all mini-bus drivers. Get ready to back up the buses very soon. We are all predicting a great run coming w TV ad's, new max movies etc. This has been a friendly but quality service announcement from your friend in at&t hell, Spartacus."
"This rise has nothing to do with a surprise coming. The big boys are moving into dividend stocks today: even Pfizer was up 3% today for no reason, but for maybe its dividend."
"Stinkey did good today. Stock goes up to 30.86 after Stinkey spoke, and now it can't even hold 30!"
T is not a growth stock. Never has been. Never will be. It can’t. It is a union based company at the core. The CWA piranhas will not let them distribute profits towards SP and buy backs etc. They would impede layoffs and trimming of benefits. T needs to be bought 28-29 and then trimmed on artificial spikes to get some profits and then re load.T will never have a straight growth trajectory. Know that when you invest. It will simply try to find a higher range and will stay there for a bit before drifting down on news.The problem now is that there are SO MANY news blips that affect T from 5G capital cost to prima Donna Hollywood folks.
The Dividend Is Going To Be Sweet! Plus T Is Headed Up! Now That's The Cherry On Top;)
Look how sensitive T stock holders are to it dropping! Watch for the inevitable panic sell in T stock!
T is competing against FREE internet TV and Low cost streaming services like HULU for $2/month.Fierce competition indeed! This is why Direct TV lost millions of customers paying $200-300/month!!In response to lost customers ATT has raised prices on the few customers left!! That will only make the long term problem worse at Direct TV.
"Gonna settle lower over the coming weeks. Even more if the market corrects with the new administration. Wait for the big dip, buy bunch for dividend, and sell Covered Calls 60-90 days out for the premiums."
"Dish @ 33.67 . Mr . Moffett your price target of 15 isn’t happening Sir . Monday’s earnings, possibly a partner , spectrum news etc . Dish 40 ~ 45 next week . Have owned for 19 years and know when it’s hot"
Time is drawing near for T investors. That 3 day weekend was the longest they've went without losing more money for awhile.
Folks I struggle with paying 131 bucks a share for tmus just to expensive
Nice to see management finally found their voice. Amazing what a little positive press and commentary will do.Duh
"Big week next week, we get the Spectrum Auction results."
Cole James Bridges....SMH. The FBI and JAG have a lot of work ahead of them.
Can't push thru 30 strikes. Why?
At this rate you are losing due to annual inflation! Dividend isn't enough to keep up with inflation considering the annual drop in the price too.
"I could only squeeze out .50 per share this month by rolling my Feb 26 T strike 29's to the Mar 26 $29's but I did do better selling BP Puts. The nice drop in the price of BP for the last two days brought BP back into the picture and I was able to sell the Mar 26 $24 Puts for .87 each (equivalent of per share). So in spite of a stinky last market day for Feb expirations, we were able to make two silk purses out of two cow's ears."
Why is this FLAT when everything else recovered 100% 200%+? AT&T CEO come out say something related to HBO subscriptions and EV car + 5G.
"The Managment has to make a statement or they won't satisfy the crowd. They should focus on HBO Max, expand it and develop it better, so they can compete with Disney or Netflix."
Let’s just call this what it is. A dog. Ruff ruff
A NEW DAY...AND NEW WINNING
@R looks like someone figured out spending upwards of 230K a year for Airport CNN Network isn't such a great idea. Zucker became the short fall guy that had to announce another one of AT&T's plans.
T snaps $30’s. Bullish rotation towards low valuation and dividend stocks.
"Your Dividend check  will arrive. It's income and drives the economy. Relax, you will get your Dividend $..It's crucial to a Company behemoth like AT&T...Just remember, it's deposited and then released by your financial institution/brokerage account. Relax it's coming. AT&T has your back."
"There is the T you all know and love, lol. What a hack dividend stock."
"@TEX, you are the strategist!"
"You ask why is it going down? no revenue growth, plus a $15.5 billion charge for Directv"
"I keep reading comments on the hope that another $2,000 stimulus check is coming. Let me see, we are nearly 30 trillion in debt, over 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and running a 2 trillion dollar annual deficit.When is the treasury printing press going to run out of ink. This is worse than the guy who has 50 credit cards maxed out, and hopes to find more credit card applications so he can pay the minimum balance on everything. Better prepare yourselves for the inevitable."
T is for long on dividend and short on capital gains.
Is CNN still the Official race baiting network of the Democrat Party?
Quite the stock we have here folks lol
"Crazy collapse coming after today, typical pump then dump by big boys for manipulation, T is known for that."
QANON TAKES CENTER STAGE AT TRUMPS RALLY...WOW !
OMG.......I just reviewed the posts of Superstar Bill Dundee.........they bleed misogyny and racism.....and that's not fake news...those are the fax jax..........
"The fact is T is now the only American Cell company where your data is safe. Both TMUS and VZ are now run by the EU's one world order were they are collecting data to farther the EU's one world order agenda. Up to you if you want to support the EU and Germany taking over the world without firing a shot or not . All so true you do not have to make any thing up. Germany has taken over 28 countries without having to fire a shot and they are working hard on taking the USA over from within , Just like the fall of the Rome"
ruh roh! read what CNN ceo said about covid being great for ratings. boycott???
Come on $35
"Started in the market in 1984, 60 now, had many holdings in and out in 36 years, never looked at a site before, until the down time because of the Virus, what a mistake looking at this site, been with T for 23 years, over 20K shares, will be getting about 11K in a div, Feb 1 in a Roth IRA, all tax free, Some of You people need a lot of help. I can tell You, the Virus wont get Me but reading the Post of some of You people will make Me drink GAS."
"Not looking good, going to break below $25 over the next few weeks."
i know if i buy more T it will plummet
"T is a growth stock. Just need pre-covid economy back as it was. Sports, concerts, travel back to normal. Streaming movies & sports = $$$$!"
got debt? got unstable div?got USA debt? got 10 yr skyrocketing? $53 oil. (was $35)?wake up!! USA cant print forever.
How come the DC mayor has gone scott free. She's the one responsible for the DC police not doing their jobs.
This should be the last retest of $27 before we steadily move up. Happy to keep collecting the divy until then.
Options Expiration today. MM's holding it near 29.....Next week 30+
Morning T ~ Tmus earnings today is worth watching. Any spectrum news will pop dish shares much higher
"You have to remember when reading articles about AT&T via Yahoo!, that Yahoo! is a subsidiary of VERIZON - AT&T's competitor.So what do you expect."
zucker good riddance
Constant decrease in earnings for past few years.. if it carries on. AT&T is done and we can receive dividends with decrease in share price all the way until it goes zero.
"I wish the Reddit group would invest in T, and screw those funds playing with it."
"The prospect for T's growth lies in streaming/content. It made it's big play with the TWX acquisition. Their biggest innovation was HBO Max and WW84. A dud (as measured by stock price). Further, not enuf new content + 3 vak seens in the US + year long cabin fever + states relaxing restrictions + warm weather coming = big trouble for streaming companies."
T is a great retirement portfolio stock IMHO. I owned some A T and T stock from around 1969 to the mid 1980's. I dont recall the stock appreciating much higher in price but like clockwork I got my dividend monies every quarter. When the dust settled my 15 year investment was fruitful. At age 66 at this juncture I am just looking for basically a portfolio of high dividend paying stocks where management makes paying dividends a high priority. The banks currently are giving me almost zero incentive in keeping monies there. I cant retire comfortably on a 4/10ths of one per cent CD or money market fund. As far as the bashing of CNN; I would assume CNN produces a significant operating income for T; every time I put on CNN I see a commercial within minutes. I recall when BP had that terrible oil spill everyone cried they would never buy BP gasoline again. How long did that last. IMHO HBO MAX will be the key driver for 2021.
I like Jim Cramer overall think he does a good job . I don’t buy his recommendations but do feel he’s fair
"+0,9% kind of cute;36-37 price target to sell (currently just holding and seeing how market develops)if tech sells off to below fair value this one will be sold."
"How many new subscribers were added this weekend to quickly announce a 3rd installment and the theater numbers were horrible? Just think, they spent $200 million to make the movie. Did they recoup and then some? I bet at a minimum 14 million subs to cover $200 million production costs easy.......I am betting 40 million subscribers. This movie hit the mark on a global basis......14.99 for a family to watch together. Awesome concept"
What’s the meaning of insanity?Buy T stock and holding on as investment dwindles
I rolled my BP Mar 26 $27 Covered Calls out to APR 1 and picked up another .14 in Premium. I might also roll the T Mar 26 $29 Puts higher but not further out to bring in more Premium but in the case of T I'm going to wait until we get a lot closer to March 26 to see how it's moving. If it hangs around this price by then I could move them up to the Mar 26 $29.50's or the $30's to bring in more Premium. We'll see what happens from here.

Verizon - isn't controversialT Mobile - isn't controversialSpectrum - isn't controversialATT - are you kidding me?
I think that on Jan 27th AT&T will show excellent growth in HBO Max subscriber base and stock will have no choice but to finally start moving up to levels it deserves.
VZ on a tear today! The Buffett Effect. The story is told that JP Morgan once made a man rich merely by walking arm-in-arm with him across the Market floor. Brokers piled on the guy with special stock tips....

1000 shares x 2.08 = 2080 dollars in reinvestment income per year. Short T all you want. I'll keep buying and I'll keep reinvesting dividends and keep building my position. I'm LONG as long as the dividend stays strong.
183 BILLION in debt? You gotta be crazy to buy this. I lost my shirt following Buffett into low P/E high debt companies like KHC and AAL. I learned my lesson. At&T has one of the highest levels of debt I have seen. I don't care that they generate enough cash to cover the debt payments. This stock price won't move up for years.
"WHY BUY SENS NOW!From Healthcare providers who implant Dexcom, Abbott and Eversensedaily.""I have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump.Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works."

You only get chances like this every few years and it is one of the hardest things to do is step up and buy even when you know you should. Get your shares of T and you will be rewarded for years to come

Recent article out how Corporations should torpedo the Republican Party. A review of those GOP members backing the conspiracy theories of a stolen election are risking the destruction of democracy from the party that has backed the denial of science and killed millions around the globe by forcing pollution and climate change. After reviewing how many of the states where these GOP members are funded by T it seems critical we ask T to remove their money from at least the GOP members listed. T is the most overlapping sponsor of conspiracy pushers and I will begin to move my money and services from T should this not reverse and help others do the same. PLease contact AT&T and tell them they are funding the sabotage of democracy and our environment.
"What's happening to T? Somebody knows something.If someone could help me please. I can't back up my truck because I traded it for a train ticket and a pizza the other day after someone said the train is about to leave the station. Now I'm stuck with a useless train ticket. And then to make it worse, someone yesterday said the boat is about to leave. So now I'm thinking of selling my train ticket and buying a boat. I sure hope someone doesn't say the plane is about to leave the runway. It sure is confusing.I'd like to see T drop down to the low $29's. Above $29 on March 26 but down to the lower end. $29.01 would be perfect. I want those March 26 $29 Puts I sold to expire worthless."
"Where does Yahoo get the previous close of 29.39? I guess the subtract the dividend from the previous close, so any loss the following day is after deducting the dividend...in other words a REAL loss. I just took big hits with both VZ and T, holding for the divs. NEVER AGAIN."
I nibbled today and bought another 10K T shares. No place else can I get near 8% yield on my money in a near safe way. Wish me luck!
Everything else up today. T remains a garbage stock. Need new leadership.

"It amazes me that few recognize AT&T's advantage over other media content companies (that Netflix/etc. dont have): a business model which provides not only media content, but delivery infrastructure (wireline, 4G, and soon 5G) that no other carrier or streaming company has. I'll hold my shares for a spell (12 months...or another 10% decline...whichever comes first) and see how things are shaping up then."

I’m not sure why people don’t understand that these dividend stocks are DEAD MONEY. Look at the charts. People don’t understand that when a company is paying out a BIG DIVIDEND then not enough money is going into FUTURE GROWTH. That’s why the share price is ALWAYS stagnant or slowly dropping
T is at the daily low and falling!If it was cheap why is it dropping and analysts downgrading?
Anybody think dividend safe?
What a beautiful stock! This will be a winner in Q4...just bought my wife an IPhone 12 at AT&T store...what an event! Store was packed with lines almost 100 yards long !!!

If you hold this it will climb back into the mid 30s but it may very well take a long time and it’s keystone is att now buying anymore junk companies just buy down debt and maintain dividend. Just do that only and it will get back up. Stankey is the only one that can screw this up watch him buy AOL or merge with IBM or something

At this point T should consider selling Time Warner too NFLX? DVD’s in the mail....who knew? 
"Amazon and other online sellers have decimated some sectors of the retail industry in the past few years. For instance, employment at department stores has plunged by 250,000 (or 14%) since 2012. Employment at clothing and electronics stores is down sharply from the earlier peaks as more sales move online.“Consumers’ affinity for digital shopping felt like it hit a tipping point in Holiday 2014 and has rapidly accelerated this year,” Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, wrote in a research note in December. And when he says “digital shopping,” he really means Amazon, which has increased its share of online purchases from about 10% five years ago to nearly 40% in the 2016 holiday season."

"AT&T's debt reached a record high of $190B. Ever since, the company has paid back tens of billions of debt, but the current pandemic raises questions.

Buying Opportunity
Mr Stankey has said maintaining the dividend is a priority. How much would it cost the company to raise the annual payout by a penny to keep aristocrat status? His comments suggest there is ample room for investment and debt reduction.
Cost of content continues to increase - just look at Netflix trying to create their own content & how little profit they've achieved as a result. T absolutely stole the best media/content company available today & the best part is they dont have to spend years trying to create one from scratch.
"OPEX keeping this under $30. Week after week, month after month. Cash cow for the wall st banks and funds."
The real fact is T's has always had the smartest people in the room and has changed the company many times over the last 100 years. Not an easy task for a company the size of T and to keep paying the dividend that so many count on for income. The changes they have made will start to show this year and the stock will climb higher and higher as they leverage all of T's assets on the 5G monster they have built.
"Kelly Gilblom and Bailey LipschultzSun, December 27, 2020, 4:44 PM CST(Bloomberg) -- Wonder Woman and her golden lasso exceeded box office forecasts to bring in $16.7 million for North America’s top post-pandemic opening weekend for any feature film this year.“Wonder Woman 1984” took in an estimated $36.1 million globally from 42 markets in release this weekend, after opening to slow sales in international markets last weekend. Even so, with most U.S. theaters closed, the film generated a fraction of the $412.8 million in domestic ticket revenue that the first installment in the series brought in three years ago.That may not be so bad for AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., the studio behind the $200 million film. “Wonder Woman 1984” also debuted on HBO Max on Christmas Day, which helped to break usage records, according to the studio. Almost half of the platform’s retail subscribers watched the film on the day of its arrival and HBO Max saw total viewing hours on Friday more than triple in comparison to a typical day in the previous month."

It is my understanding that Starlink will be selling some kind of phone service.
Yahoo is killing Verizon. AT&T is the only investment grade stock in the market worth buying.

Poof! Just like that 1 years worth of dividends gone not to mention loss of principle
Nice close. Here come the upgrades. Enjoy.
Right now the futures are down a little. Does that mean that AT&T will go back down tomorrow?This is a very volatile market and that is very good for traders. My suggestion is to just hold onto the stock and collect the dividend. The price will take care of itself in the next 6 months.
IMHO the only way to trade this stock is to buy in the mid 28s and sell anywhere near 30 you can get. Has worked for a very long time.

"@R opined: If you are long T just make sure you place long term sell orders for all your shares a good place to start is over $60 but any higher price you want for your shares if ok , What it does is send a message to Wall Street they are not going to get any shares cheap and the more long term sell orders there are the higher T will go , Why because sooner or later you find people that have had their shares lent out to be shorted and their broker either has to find shares for them or recall the shares that have been shortedSo place them long term sell orders and sit back collect the dividend and watch T go higher and higher . Have to wait a year to get long term capital gains away ."
Hold out for lower price. We have until Jan 7 ex-date to buy and get the Feb 1st dividend payment.
closed at the high of the day...….ok
"I'm long T unfortunately. I sold March 19 $30 strike covered calls and recently bought them back. The next time we touch $29, I'm going to sell the 3/19 $30 strike again.

This has worked the last couple of dividend cyclegood luck"
Most of the open Calls are at $29.50 and above for next Friday.
A little value here and there and the Div. is not going anywhere soon.

"new news article questions whether or not T is really serious about selling Direct TV. T rejected $15 billion bid for 49% of DTV and is extending the auction to January. DTV has lost over 2 million subscribers in las three quarters alone. is T mgmt delusional thinking a declining DTV is worth more than what bidders are willing to pay? Isn't $15 billion for giving up only 49% ownership a fair price considering the bleeding of customers? T would still own 51%. meanwhile, T will fall behind in the 5g auctions because did not get the needed cash from selling DTV. I guess their is a reason analysts think T Mobile and VZ have better mgmt, because they do. While T declines in stock prices, the other two have gone up over time. Come on T mgmt, let's get it together and make better decisions or else VZ and T Mobile will leave you in the dust."
"I own the stock and I don't see it moving up a lot until you see growth in sales and cash flow. They need to put together 2-3 quarters in a row beating the consensus estimates and paying down the debt. If we get herd immunity and theaters open back up, there is a chance that T could have a good 2022. I see sideways movement and expect the stock to move up right before the ex-dividend date which is approximately April 9. Either you hold the stock waiting for things to hopefully improve next year or you trade to trade and/or use an options strategy to improve your return while you wait for things to improve.I do believe that in a couple of years, we will see the mid $30's againgood luck"

"You know what would be nice if the Government stopped the biggest data breach in history. By a Foreign company T mobile , T mobile was founded by the EU one world order to collect data. Why the government would let a Foreign Company have access to so much data about Americans , American companies and even Military data. The Government was worried about China servers and just let T Mobile have access to everything . Most because of the EU one world order. just amazing what a massive data breach and how a foreign country has so much access to the USA data"
They really need to cut the div down to .25 and pay down that debt to get this stock to move. Its the same price as 15 years ago. It would still be paying 3.5%. Sadly the old boomers that own it would soil their depends if they did the right thing.

When is the last time the earnings report didn't sink this stock? It can't get out of its' own way.
AT&T is 2nd most shorted just behind XOM. $3+ billion. There has been some massive short covering rallies over the last few weeks causing some huge hedge fund pain. Just saying.

AT&T Reportedly Aims to Raise $14 Billion to Buy 5G Spectrum
"Well lets see what other stocks you can buy with low forward PE's and going to pay you very well in dividend . T forward PE of 9 and pays you over 7%, PFE the DEM wits sold it down today because it's forward PE is 8.5% and it pays you over 4% I Purchased some today in the $36's You kn ow DEM wits were selling today because they are birth defect without a brain and need to be told what to do . LOL,LOL,LOL Here is one that has a forward PE of 4 and is going to start paying a dividend around 5-6% for what the stock is trading for today. Looks like some great upside for VTRS. , but you would have to have a brain to do what other don't want you to do . LOL,LOL,LOL and for sure not be a DEM wit"
Good savings account? Lol
they can't even let it alone AH!
TMUS forward PE is 40...T forward PE is 9...
"get the div, buy before the close today"
Nice! Got my dividend at 30.30 a share. Thanks Fidelity
I see people are dumping now that the divided has been paid. Waiting for a drop to $28 before I buy back in.
14 billion loan might be tamer than people thought for the must win spectrum?
Do Liberals see what J Bidet has done to their stocks since he stopped the pipeline and stopped deportations ? How much do their 401k's have to drop before they see it ? Are they stupid because of genetics or culture ? No father figure in the home ?
This is working out well. A close above $28.50 is looking good with only two hours left in the market. Selling February 26 Puts is up next after the January's expire worthless today.
"Message to ThomasL:Re: the jobs lost on the Keystone Pipeline, you were correct and I was wrong. I said 11 million and the actual number is 11 thousand. I misread the number when I looked it up. My fault, sorry!The other two numbers I posted were correct. 4 million expected job losses by raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and 15 - 16 million job losses if Biden and the Dems decide to ban fracking"
Deal is done. See press release
"Netflix shot the lights out!That should bode well for HBOmax, imo. glta"
"Nice to see AT&T up, But not holding my breath."
Do you feel that? I have a sense this may break 30 pretty soon. If market starts trending down look out above.
WTH is going on with DTV?? Get it off the books already. Sell if for pennies on the dollar if you have to. Just get rid of the albatross.
This is dead money
"T- posters, shut-up and take the dividend!"
Picked up 52 more shares of FREE T this week with 1 more trading day to go.
So how did Stanky do on the call
if they lower divi I'm outta here.i have 1200 shares
Well it was a good day today. Just looking for a close above $28.50 on Friday.
T will at some point integrate TW and when it does the stock will pop.. long T collecting dividend ....
Reuben says: there are reports that TPG is offering above $15billion probably $18 or $17billion for a minority stake on DTV. AT&T .... JUST SELL IT!
...and to dust it shall return
Down again? T stock will likely continue to sell off now that the dividend is out of the calculation seeing as it went exdividend a few days ago. Fact is you can wait and buy it a lot cheaper months from now and still get the dividend.

Now that's what a PRESIDENT looks like.
Looking to open $1 lower than yesterdays high. Many who bought there yesterday will be wanting to double down soon. Hope soon is today.
"I have held a strong position in AT&T for over a very long period. I am not concerned about it’s daily fluctuations. I am here and will remain because of it being a solid dividend investment. However, my view is that traders in Puts and Options control the perception of the market view of the stock. Fundamentals mean absolutely nothing to these traders. Keeping the stock at low margins manages their risks and increases their profits.Admittedly I am bullish on the stock. AT&T has made some strategic blunders financially.Going forward, the leadership team has my confidence, steering through 2020 against all odds, has increased my confidence in the long term outlook for increased shareholder value.We need a marketing approach that offset the naysayers, presenting with solid facts that give confidence in the long term growth and viability of the corporation.Another suggestion would be to reward shareholders with a special dividend for holding the stock for five years or more. Or giving them stock options at a discount. AssetsHBO, HBO Max, Directv, 5G network, FirstNet, Wireline and Wireless, Warner Media, etc,Are the basis for my holding the stock."
"T made a commitment to the dividend. THIS IS NOT DISNEY. Cell phone service and programming are solid covid resistant business. If people have trouble paying their phone bill for a little while, just think how bad the rest of the economy will be, T will be considered a safe spot. WE don't own theme parks ( closed) Movies that need theaters ( closed ) an overpriced ESPN with no sports , etc etc. T will pay the dividend like it has done for more than 35 years and in a zero rate environment the stock will trade up within 12 months to $36-38."
How Big is the Short position on AT&T. ?
"To each is own. Personally, when I travel to parts unknown, I like to have my GPS up and running or at least an old-fashioned map at arm’s length. Some people just like to wing it, fly by the set of their pants. And that’s fine, but I like to know where I’m going, how to get there and what are the hazards along the way. They might not be for everyone, but charts and fundamental analysis serve me just fine. Still hit occasional pothole, but no road traveled is totally risk free.S.L."
silver is real money. they need it for electronics. real things. not AMC or GME.
If T doesn’t break $32 today I’ll jump off my roof into the pool
No News is required for this monster to jump. This is just way undervalued.
People selling their winners today but T is not one of them
Why can’t the shorts get squeezed on this one like GameStop a quick run up to 300 would be tremendous
T just broke above 1996 level. Now I just have to live to 150.
Just bought 5000 shares at 29.07
OMG...was that green that flickered for T a moment ago. Could today break the red streak ?
"I hold this stock for the 7.5% return, I wouldn't sell if it went to $35, why should I care if it drops from $31 to 30? This stock does it's job, after a few dividend payments my actual cost basis on this investment got so low I have no risk of losing money overall. Stay salty bears."

Hopefully Stankey says something good about the HBO Max subscriber numbers on Friday. Stock might get a nice bump. Disney and Netflix always go up on better subscriber numbers.
Come on man. U will get your grass cut cheap again thanks to me.
How is Angry Woman Titus doing today ? 
This appears to be more than a simple correction or market fluctuation. Anyone with the ear to the ground hearing anything?

Another yearly dividend increase- like clockwork.......thank you T.

"Yawn, some things never change. Check out the 5-year chart."
T needs to sell CNN and add hbo max to the DTV monthly cost
All my stocks are in green today except T. Getting to be a bad daily trend. Appears large investors and some small ones are losing faith in T.
T stock will likely be in strong downward trend for at least 3 months and maybe much longer! No hurry to buy this stock for the dividend because it just went ex-dividend! Assuming the dividend isn't eliminated or #$%$ This year T board didn't raise the dividend even by a penny! Could not afford it!
In my opinion sooner or later T will purchase Nokia.
Salary is in .. another 20 shares for me today 
"HBO Max is getting the new Denzel movie The Little Things at the end of January, Cha Ching goes the new subscriptions"

"When we get into a recession the FED will have to go to 0% again and maybe negative. Your T stock will revert to the 5% mean at around 35. But for us buying in the dips it's a near 7% yield for many years to come. Buy and hold for the future, you have to appreciate a value opportunity when it presents itself."
"It is funny that there is a lot of complaining on this board. I get it, the stock price was way higher than it is now. But the ave daily volume is in the 30 million range. That means people are buying 30 million shares a day of this stock. Yes that also means people are selling 30 million shares...but my point is, is there is a lot of interest here."
The CC sounds perfect.
"So now the Minneapolis mayor is saying they need more police because of the spike in violent crimes. It's going to cost them millions to start hiring again after so many cops quite the force in disgust. Nice going mayor, you really screwed this one up!"
Cheap is a relative term. T is now $28 and some think that is cheap but how will you feel when T is selling for $17?
T stinks still down 11 1/2% over four years meanwhile VZ up 22% purchased the same day I Obviously made a mistake buying T
Hooray! The price right now is higher than it was one month ago!
Hmmmm...let's see...who should I mute today?

Jim MUTED! He posts too much political boloney on a message board reserved for T. 
Ben is right T just might not have any more to write off for direct TV because T may have depreciated Direct TV over last 6 years. and that is why the price and timing of the deal happened now. So look for T to go higher in the future because T's new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX are still taking customers away from both T Mobile and VZ in droves

"Argus maintains $48 target:"" We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $48. A lthough AT&T reported strong bottom-line results in 3Q18, it still missed consensus and, more importantly, reported postpaid subscriber losses that worried the market. While gains in prepaid were robust, management will need to convince investors that these 'lower-value' customers will be just as profitable. A T & T has been busy with strategic acquisitions, completing the Time Warner acquisition in June after a major deal with the First Responder Network last year and smaller deals like the pending AppNexus acquisition. These deals should help AT&T to maintain its industry position in terms of both spectrum and content as the U.S. wireless market transitions to 5G and converges with the fixed-broadband services offered by the cable companies. AT&T surprised investors by announcing that it would 'introduce' mobile 5G in the next few weeks. We did not think that handsets would be available for 5G before 2019. If AT&T can actually get a real jump on mobile 5G, this could become a competitive advantage""."

Mobile data is better than fixed data. T-Mobile is positioned to survive. AT&T has unique opportunities, (content and advertising). Hope that the board of directors who work for YOU figure it out and stop making DISASTROUS decisions."
I’m betting we’ll see a dividend increase of 7% to offset the upcoming increase in the corporate income tax rate.

You need to get your shares before Monday Jan 4 2021 and the flood of new money starts coming in looking for yield. You have Tax loss sell still taking place so it will let you pick up millions of shares without driving the price up to high.
"NFLX is worth more than T. HBOMax is not NFLX yet, but it is also a small part of T. I honesty thin that T should spin their Time Warner/HBO properties off into a new stock. Do that and sell off the direct TV properties and you could unlock tons of value. The Time Warner valuation would go to probably over 100M when it starts trading as a public company. And the value of T without HBO and Direct TV would still be like 150M. Doing this move would unlock at least 50M in market cap I think. Not sure they will do this, but thats the only way that they can get the kind of multiple for HBOMax that it should have."

"After a long voyage from England in 1640 to escape religious persecution my family made their home in Braintree MA. Our family tree has many familiar names to baby boomers who were taught American history, sadly the children of today have little knowledge of early America. Throughout the centuries they have fought & died in many wars, from the American Revolution to Vietnam to the lost causes of the Middle East. Suffice to say our family have given many lives under the flag of the United States. Today for the first time in my life I feel America slipping away. The Constitution & our way of life is under attack from the very politicians sworn to protect it.

""In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021, creating more than $1.6 billion in gross wages.""That’s close to what the State Department found in its 2014 report.In the report, the agency wrote that 10,400 estimated positions would be for seasonal construction work lasting four to eight-month periods. Since the State Department defines ""job"" as ""one position that is filled for 1 year,"" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period. In short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary.The State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline. Thirty-five of them would be permanent, while 15 would be temporary contractors."

Ridiculously undervalued. T is a cash machine that keeps growing.

"Playing now on HBO Max...CNN special report ""The Trump Insurrection"". MUST SEE!!!"
"If you only value AT&T telecom business on par with Verizon, and discounted all others business (media, streaming, etc) as worthless, then T should be trading around $32. If you value the other assets inline with Disney and Netflix, then T would be trading around $60."
"AT&T, is what it is, You just need to figure out what that is. Stop putting toothpicks under your Fingernails everyday, Get your Div. every quarter and hope it can go up in value. That's what it is."
Will ATT's CNN begin the discussion about the 25th amendment to bring ratings up again?
Please start building a base ABOVE 30. Got 10k shares that need to be sold around 40!
We'll call it a winning day if it stays above $30.
"All the T haters get ready to SAY OH NO up T goes , WOW when T reports earnings and shows just how many new customer they have from T Mobile and VZ , T will be going a lot higher. LOL,LOL,LOL"
"What is the probability of this going even lower tomorrow?I am thinking about selling my Vanguard fund (VTSAX) and buying T tomorrow. I could put my shares up for sale and buy 90% of what VTSAX is worth today or wait and use 100% of the VTSAX (490 shares at $66.16 today)sale tomorrow. VTSAX will undoubtedly go up after hours today with the market being up. The difference will be about around 80 cent uptick in VTSAX so I would have around 32,800 tomorrow. If I buy today I can only use 90%of the value of $32,400 or around $29,200. If T goes down again tomorrow, I make a great buying opportunity even better. If T goes up tomorrow I lose out. Could T actually test the lows of $32.55 again. The last time I was able to purchase my shares at $32.63 and that is a 6.13% dividend rate."
"""Wireless infrastructure CEO expects 5G capex deferment after huge C-band spend.""Google this. You can't link to it. It's a Q&A with a CEO of a company that builds cell towers. You might learn something about the importance of the CBand Auction and 5G and how long it's going to take. He expects very little spending on 5G buildout for the next two years by the Big Three."

"JP Morgan prefers T over VZ: (Maybe $35 year end )""JPMorgan upgrades AT&T to Overweight, adds to Analyst Focus List. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick upgraded AT&T (T) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $38. He also added the stock to his firm's U.S. Analyst Focus List as an Income idea. The analyst left recent management meetings and the company's analyst meeting with a better understanding of expectations around organic growth as well as how AT&T plans to de-lever the business using organic free cash flow and asset sales. Further, Cusick believes weakening video trends are now embedded in consensus expectations. At $31 per share, the stocks' risk/reward is ""skewed to the upside and AT&T investors are being paid to wait."" At these levels, Cusick prefers AT&T to Verizon Communications (VZ). The analyst downgraded the latter this morning to Neutral""."
"As a long term holder of 3800 shares, most which were purchased at a higher cost, am in because of the remarkable dividend, and at least for now it’s taxed at a long term lower rate. I want this company to succeed and prosper. The current yield presently over 7% is enough to make anyone happy and maybe just me — but I am willing to give up another or a couple of dividend increases to get rid of some more of the debt and to get the Company back in better financial shape as long as it goes toward the debt."
I bought some more T today. I even waited for the dip. Bought more at 30.12!
"Here are 2 fast movers if you want to take the risk LGVW should be taking ButterFly public soon like next week or the one after and VGAC is Branson's SPAC it got hammered on Friday so should jump back higher Branson is taking 23andME public , T has built a real monster that no one company can or will compete with T in the future as T leverages all it's assets to drive new customers and services. T is just now taking their first baby steps with the monster with T's new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX and man is it driving NEW customers to T . Both VZ and T mobile are now losing more and more customers to T everyday , Can't wait to see the results in this Q report. For a FACT if you own VZ you will need to be out of VZ stock before the next earnings report or you will get slaughtered . I don't even need to make up stuff when it's all so true."

HBO is great for T unfortunately we are being dragged down by the rest of the company

The last time ATT closed at 30 or above was Dec. 15. Long time coming!
"T's Redness can't be hidden, Free fall under $20 continues."
Stocks rocket higher! And ATT? Oh...
"T now in the red although market up almost 600 points. Let’s accept it, T is a $28-$29 stockand will be for sometime. The positives (see earnings report) are neutralized by management.During earnings call, the one question about DTV, and T mgt avoided the question. They also gave little confidence comment for 2021...1% growth. A dividend stock that will bounce around at a high 20’s range for a while. But hey, the 7% dividend is safe."
ThisShould be 40Min what r people thinkng?
"@Mygirlfriendishalfmyage fair warning by the end of the day I plan to hold more shares than you! Who was the legend with 35,000 shares? He deleted his post. That guy effs."
Payday tomorrow. Pop a cork!
Listen to @R - don’t sell your stocks cheap
AT&T has around 10 billion dollars in free cash flow after they’ve paid the dividend. This should be used to chop down the debt or buy back shares.
1800 shares averaged to $30.50 It’s better for this to go up slowly. It’s going up pretty fast all things considered. Will it find new support over $30 that is the next big step
"AT&T makes a deal to get over $15 billion and reduce dept. Stock goes up 0.1%Roku gets a deal to carry HBO, their stock goes up 15% adding 15 billion to market cap. Only on wall street can this happen!"
"Most of you keep struggling and complaining. I keep telling you how to make money but few of you listen. I even post my trades so you can easily check the prices and the times but few of you listen. If you want to keep struggling and complaining about T that's up to you. It's your choice. If you choose to go that way, stop complaining."
Was it ATT'S philosophy to mock the President of The United States?You bet it was.
"Buffets buy of VZ , dish earnings coming up , spectrum news . Dish is going to pop quickly"
"Look at that all the T Haters are crying this morning as T is Green and up LOL,LOL,LOL"
Dead Money definitely heading to $20 or lower in 2021.
"Sold t and bought Apple on Friday. Was a good move for now. Will be back in T soon, I do think hbo Max will be a big help eventually. But they really need to cut off loose ends with the extra unnecessary ventures."
Add the last divi to this price and T is over 30 again. Just saying...and hoping...for more T gains.
"This company has the WORST communications/PR group. The CEO may be mute, but at least try to manage the narrative. Thats what these groups are for!"
"825,000 shares traded AH and currently up a penny. so you can quiet down about the AH ""sell off "" that movement means nothing."
More debt means dividend less safe
Expect blowout MAX sub numbers but will remain range bound for at least another 2 quarters between 28 and 31. After that you can say bye bye to the 7% yield forever.
T please spin off Warner/HBO. What are you a phone company or a media company. The market is pricing you as a phone company. Use the spin off proceeds of $100B to pay down debt
Looks like Facebook has finally taken sides with the DEMS. So much for being Neutral.The U.S censorship system is getting close to Chinas.
"Jack and Mach2 responding to Superstar Bill Dundee's message below are typical of the thinking on this board. You shoot the messenger and ignore the message. Well here's exactly what T said during the recent investor conference:During 2024 AT&T expects to reach a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 or lower and to do it the company expects to us all cash flows after dividends to pay down the debt and will continue to look for opportunities to monetize non-strategic assets. The company also does not plan to repurchase shares during this period. 2021 guidance, announced in January 2021, remains unchanged. Revenue growth - 1% range. EPS to be stable with 2020. Capital Investment - $21B, FCF = $26B.So basically no growth in 2021! Also, seems to me that if the FCF is going to remain at $26B, with a $14 Dividend and with $21B committed to additional Capital Investments, the current Cash balance is going to start to suffer. $14B = $21B is $9B more than the $26B FCF. Where is the difference going to come from other than the current Cash balance. If Cash starts to get squeezed further, reducing the dividend could be next in sight. It's not my position that it will, but the numbers don't add up!"
"Just what can the United States make that can compete? Cell phones? They're all made on the other side of the planet. I remember when ATT ""was"" an American company. Today ATT makes nothing. Raise wages to 15 bucks? Stankey probably thinks that's going to solve our problems."
"The economic downturn that we are currently experiencing is making the last recession look like a Sunday picnic. Yes, 2008 and 2009 were bad, but they weren’t anything like this. Unprecedented intervention by the Federal Reserve has allowed the rich to get even richer during this crisis, but meanwhile millions upon millions of ordinary Americans are deeply suffering. Unfortunately, what we have gone through so far is just the beginning."
Last few days I am up a few percent on one portfolio just by holding T.The dollar strenght has increase the value of T.
"Just got back from the dentist, WOW! Anyone find any news for the move up?"
What happened? You don't get this kind of move without news behind it and some group has seen the news before us.
T has way to many assets that are mismanaged. They need to break this up to get the value out of it. CNN could have had a comeback if there was a real management team at T.
"Thought is was too good to be true. Hope for a late day push, really want to close above 29."
"T = 28.65-0.73 (-2.48%) 10 yr = 10-Yr Bond$1.5180It is headed to 2% real, real fast."
Lock in 7% the rest of your life
"Ok, tell me why I want to own T. Down today, down last 5 days, down last month, down last 6 months, down last year."
One heck of a stock!
"Later this year and next year, investors will fall into two categories...those who bought in at the 7% dividend level AND those bought at the 5-6% dividend level."
T or $VZ if I am opening a new position in one these?
"If you only invest in T, that is your problem. T + growth stocks = a good mix."
T would have to be a lot cheaper to make up for its problems and dog performance
"LOL,LOL,LOL T has built a monster and the world is just now learning how T's monster can leverage it's assets to drive sales , First baby step was T's new unlimited cell plans and they give you HBO MAX for FREE , LOOK out world T's shin new Monster is learning how to FEED on the competition as that monster is now taking customers away from both VZ and T mobile but the gravy is people can drop NFLX and save even more money because they don't need NFLX with HBO MAX , LOL,LOL,LOL T's MONSTER is ALIVE and NO one company by themselves has the assets to compete with the monster T has built, By the smartest people in the room"
"DISH owns sling, the fast growing TV streaming business that is grabbing the cord cutters leaving ATT and Comcast who charge double. I hear now DISH will team up with AMZN to launch a nationwide 5G cellular phone service to take on VZ and T. Exciting times!"
Maybe might be interested in T at a much lower price.
"Was looking to buy some of this ""secure"" high dividend payer, but no.Too many bad decisions, among them buying Direct TV (at any price) and charging $15 for HBO MAX. And then the quarterly earnings declines.I'll stick with MREITs for my divis and tech for cap gains.Maybe it's time for midstream energy companies too."
Almost Fell off my chair when I see it Up $.14 today.
HBO max that profitable?? Dividend going up
CNN brings in over a billion in profits.ATT has been politicized for years.How many customers have gone elsewhere just because of that.How many billions in profits has this cost shareholders?

Will be at 30 before close
"AT&T prison is so painful... I am stuck here forever, but it is at least better than cash and bonds."
"I see some comments on here that AT&T cant even go up when the market does. I have been researching and following T for the last two years, Based off chart trends and what you can even see, ATT does not follow the lines of the S&P, DOW, or NAS. The market can tank where T can see major increases. Sometimes it lines up, but those are random acts. More times than not, T does its own thing. Best stock to own for long term holders. Im not going to say best time to buy, but it is absolutely a great opportunity at these prices."
This is one hell of a stock!
"Any shareholder of T deserves a year's supply of melatonin.BIG write off of Time Warner coming, Does anyone want my Randal Stevens (Former CEO) autographed annual report?"

T is going to take out a 52 week low while the rest of the market is hitting 52 week highs. Omg.

Get ready for sell the news tomorrow.
The real fact about debt is every shareholder at VZ owes $208 of the debt and for T each shareholder only owes now $96 of debt. WOW if you are a VZ shareholder you are in trouble and have no clue you are . FACT
T's price will probably rise the closer we get to its earnings report.
Sure are the big gains and losses being speculated. Going to $100 and dropping to $10. WoW. You guys will make a fortune waiting for those to happen.
"They aren't committed to being a Dividend Aristocrat. That's why the stock is down. Below are Sankeys comments. There will be no more dividend raises anytime soon. He's slowly approaching a dividend cut, day by day. Once you lose Aristocrat status, it's easy to cut it. His comments below are for the next TWO years.... so aristocrat status is GONE.______Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We’re committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we’ll give top priority to debt reduction, at this time."
"funny fact: T-bills have higher total return than T, with lower risk."
The DEMS are giving children $250-$300/mo now and burdening them with HUGE debts when they grow up. The Millenials and Gen Z generation will have to pay for Pelosi's $1.9 Trillion debt bill.What a country. The Baby boomers have really messed things up.
WOW ! Dow Up 600........What Does T DO ? HOMEGAMERS......ALL Together Now

"This is how little investors are diggin' T these days......You can buy 28 strike calls for Friday for just .11 over intrinsic! In other words, you need just a ten cent move from here to start making money. As i've said before, this stock needs a sentiment boost. Maybe from a buffet or buffet-like person or from a secular story or from say, an hbo max subs story. i believe in the eventuality of things."
"Even the cruise lines which are making literally no money move higher than this, why?"
Wouldn't it be interesting if AT&T acquired AMC Theaters and added AT&T Stores to each of them after the pandemic? Theaters could essentially be converted to points of sale for AT&T services and WM entertainment.
the solution is simple. ATT need only announce they are exploring entering the EV and cloud security business.

Look at the article from smarter analyst today. David and will be sustained according to the article and Oppenheimer still has a by rating on AT&T.￼￼
Nice bounce off the lows.
Fundamentals don't mean much for this stock. Play the trading range and you'll be fine.
I know one thing T doesn't stand for......total return

Good price to average down and nice thing about dividend investing is we can wait for the price to go up with full confidence that the dividend is safe. T is solid
Cant find why its down PM
"It takes time and I am sorry for repeating myself, T is long long term hold, 23 years, 20,560 shares, Hoping they keep the dividend, And I am no longer reinvesting the dividend, I will receive around 11K in cash on Monday, Tax Free, Roth IRA, 44K a year, Tax Free, Tax Free, Tax Free. Sorry for repeating myself, But do some of you people get it. Because of reinvesting the dividend for 23 years my cost basis is below the value of the stock today. Thank you AT&T."

WHEN the merger was 1st announced - months ago - T rocketed to $40 and above - NOW - after a long protracted law suit - the merger can actually go thru - the stock falls $2.00 to close to $32.00.......WARNING to all who look at these posts....NO ONE - REPEAT - NO ONE....has a clue....
"LOL,LOL Spartan55 the problem you are going to have is I really believe in the Changes T has made and very sure that T is a much better company and it is going to be a real Monster in the future that NO one company has the asset to compete with T's monster they have built. The Fact that you and your buddies can move T up or down 25 cents does not matter to me because the old bid and ask use to be 50 cent spread . The FACT that should scare the hell out of you is T is learning to lever their assets to drive new customers to T. T's new unlimited cell plan with FREE HBO MAX is really killing it and taking customers from both T mobile and VZ . So once the next earnings reports come out VZ is going to get slaughtered and if that was not bad enough VZ with their YAHOO Censoring Natzi's are now running off both customers and shareholders in droves. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Faders got control of this stock.

"I am not recommending that ATT discontinue the dividend. So, if ATT used the $14+ billion that they pay in dividends to buy back shares, would that create more shareholder value than reinvesting the dividend? A 7%+ dividend will double your money in about 10 years.I believe an announcement of a buyback of that size would double the stock price in less than 10 years. They will probably do both. Food for thought!"

The stock has dropped almost a buck since Jan. 14. Is that saying anything about the ER next week?
"$1,400 stim check? Hey, at today's price that's 46 more shares! Yeah I know I'm suppose to buy a new TV."
"Message to ThomasL:Re: the jobs lost on the Keystone Pipeline, you were correct and I was wrong. I said 11 million and the actual number is 11 thousand. I misread the number when I looked it up. My fault, sorry!The other two numbers I posted were correct. 4 million expected job losses by raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and 15 - 16 million job losses if Biden and the Dems decide to ban fracking."
Dragged kicking and screaming to 2 cents green lol.
"Never a word from management to support the share price. The silence is deafening. No vision, no imagination, no ability to communicate. We are supposed to be satisfied with a dividend and be just fine with a market at all time highs and T trading at the same price it was 10 years ago. Beyond frustrating!"
"If anything they will not cut their div., but they will not increase it until they become more profitable, and the stock goes up into the 40's or 50's. Good luck, and happy NEW YEAR TO ALL."
Afternoon T ~ interested in this up coming week of trading. Earnings are coming and I am not convinced things are rosy
David muted!
Just remember if it wasn’t for covid T would be 45$ at least. So when theaters do open back up T will rise again.
Mr Alexander Graham Bell is ashamed what has become of his legacy.
Why are T shareholders anti-Main St? Who do you think subscribes to HBO?
This stock sure is a beauty lol.
"For the share price to go up, T needs sales and earnings growth. So the question is, once most Americans get vaccinated by June/July, will people go back to leading ""normal"" lives...go to restaurants, theaters, ball games, etc. If they do, I see a good chance that T will start seeing some growth. We have to wait and see."
Anybody here play any of the squeezes today? This Market is Bananas 
I AM THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ OF DISHWASHERS. BUT YOU CAN CALL ME BUDDY.
Decided not to travel staying home. Tacos with lots of meat cheese and tomatoes & onions. Go dish
Really nice up volume
Up T goes now that's some kind of stock and pays you over 7% just to own shares . WOW now that's some kind of powerful in a zero interest FED
Just like watchin' paint dry. Just wish it was drying at 28.73(breakeven) or higher.
"Ex-Dividend Date 4 Jan 08, 2021"
"Where's @R Loud mouth to share his ""Wisdom of Steel"" he's done it every twenty minutes last two days but it still went oops"
"Hope they put some go getters in the HBO Max department. What do these other guys do all day? There is no Roku Or Prime. I don't even see any promos or commericals for it. Man, just look at how well netflix is doing. That should motivate them to want to compete. And HBO has all the tools. They just need someone to take charge and run with it!"
Oh boy
NATHAN KILAR: go ahead and outright fire lil jeffie zucker...he is a liability...someone might trip over the lil sqirt...
why is T up?
Att please say you’re looking to enter the EV market and then say you’re working on a crypto currency... just start something anything and let’s get rich. Thank you
"For the vast majority, the theater experience is about the best way to experience many films. They pay a premium for that. The idea that they would be willing to pay virtually the same to stay at home for a nonlive premier is for the majority a waste of tight cash. It can always be seen days, weeks, months or years later at a fraction of the cost. Entertainment hoopla is greatly over rated. The greatest fans are those involved in it. Good fortune to T if T can pull off the HBO Max with its over rated schemes but I have my doubts in today’s environment. I’ll catch up with them on a cheaper streamer sometime tomorrow."
the vessel is starting to go forward
"Any news about the status of selling Direct TV?Last month, I had read that T was trying to sell it for $15B and the buyer would assume some debt. Subsequent to that, I haven't heard anything."
A Real.....SWAN Dive Those Last 10 MinsEH ?
"Pat.. how many shares of T are in your portfolio, how long have you held them, and what is the quarterly dividend payment that you receive? I'm curious to know. Tia glta "
Randall's pitiful management choices during his tenure at AT&T is a lesson (hopefully learned) that shareholders should be VERY careful whom they elect to the Board of Directors.
If it wasn't for the dividends I'd dump T. When is it ever going to pop? It has not moved a penny since the announcement of Warner pictures appearing on HBO Max. I'm thinking it will go up Temporarily for the Snyder Cut of Justice League then immediately go back down after everyone's seen it.
"I have a Buy order at $28.49 today, 5k shares. If it hits, then I can dump it at $28.59 for a quick $500. Not that I need it, though."
there goes little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff PRETENDING and IMPERSONATING to be a certified licensed CFP....buying BP at $31 and its now $21?......what school did you get your degree from?.....correspondence SCHOOL.....you're FIRED
"This is a gift from the market. T is a bargain under $30, and a safe harbor while the tech bubble unwinds."
Guys up a solid 5 cents today heck yeah baby
"The difference between the media plans of $T and $VZ can be looked simply as renting vs. owning. Verizon is leasing content from other owners and paying them large fees for bundling while avoiding the instant sticker stock of a large property purchase. ATT on the hand bought a very large, well maintained property that it not only uses for its own bundling but also rents it out and collects fees to pay down its very large mortgage. I am still betting on the latter strategy for the future. Just like housing and the fact you ""have to live somewhere"", the adage of ""you are always gonna be watching TV, sports and shows"" also applies."
Can you say 27.00 by summer div
This stock is headed to 10.00
What you will see as Wall Street drive T lower they are sucking up shares and T will end up higher . VZ you will see not recover the drop because VZ is now losing customers to T at a record pace . WOW this last weekend VZ lost more customers than ever before to T just check how many numbers had to be ported this last weekend WOW
"I thought that if I quit clicking on ""The Motley Fool"" articles that they might stop appearing on my yahoo finance news. Does anyone know how to stop getting their garbage? Maybe if enough people stop reading them Yahoo will stop posting them."
AT&T is a much better dividend stock than IBM. yet Jim Cramer is shiatty man.
T announced a delay of their Hogwarts Legacy video game until 2022.
"Have to post one more time. To prove my point, Yahoo took down my post criticizing Yahoo for their screening process. They are screening based on their own left bias."
"Over the past two years the company has spent nearly $8 billion buying back stock. Most, if not all of thosepurchases were at higher prices. The stock is down nearly 33% in one of the greatest bull markets in history.Our balance sheet is a ocean of debt and we are paying our top 4 executives well over $20 million a year excluding options. What a complete and utter cluster@#$% this company is."
"Don't criticize Dems push for a $15 an hour minimum wage, it will be removed by Dem screeners."
Even value investors gave up.
"If the economy is recovering and businesses are reopening and market is flying, why not this stock?"
Good day for T today. Looks like we're going to close of $29. Yo Dave2. Where do you think the price would go if they reestablished 100% of the dividend?
"told ya, 10 yr going past 1.5%"
Better get in! 45’in 2 weeks
I should have invested in a solid company like GameStop. I've done nothing but lose $ with T & VZ.
"Although I'm from Europe $T is being smart on launching first in Latin America, Latin America helped by 30% the growth of Disney+ so they will probably give a boost to HBO MAX"
ATT'S CNN participated in a plot for 4 years to bring a President down.No human being could withstand the daily attacks from this sleazy network's attacks.ATT is dirty money.
Could there be an upgrade next week as a result of today's cc?
let's wait until Friday when it's the investor day to critize when we have all the answers about their plans for the company
"According to my tea leaves, I see support for T around $28.40 and resistance around $30.70."
"Following the report, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan reiterated his buy rating with a $47 price target (59% upside potential).“AT&T has relative EBITDA stability and is focused on investing in growth areas” he explained. “Importantly, the dividend seems safe and debt reduction can continue with what we and the company estimate to be a 60% payout ratio.”The company will get more aggressive on expense reductions, he added."
"Moffett once said something like T was ""balancing on a knife's edge the ability to remain competitive and the need to keep the dividend at its current level"". I think Moffett should have a sitdown with the Barclay's analyst and so many others who say the div is safe, and in this recent upgrade, that the payout ratio is well within historical norms and concerns are overblown. It's this kind of thing that has me always doubting Moffett's cred."
William and Red Equal might be the same guy. Debbie Downers.
T is a solid investment. Most stocks are too high for me but T at 6% and no where to go but up. Long T !
"It has come to my attention that my enjoyment of gifs may not be shared by all. To be a team player, I have agreed to only include a gif on this board once every week. I want to fit in."
Then there is the loss of opportunity by keeping dead money in T.
Earnings info leak?
Went long at 34 nice divy but no growth
Grass grows faster in the winter time in North Dakota than T stock. At least grass does not grow back into the ground like t stock. Missed opportunities with capital and drop in price and dividend means you lose annually because of inflation. Overall you keep losing money annually! While in one day the appreciation of a healthy stock goes up more than years of holding t stock. SELL!
"AT&TSad to watch. Cheetah has been caught lying here a thousand times over the years, but he’s so old that he doesn’t remember it. What a terrible way to live out your later years. He’s posted here for years and never lost on a trade he says! Sad sad."
"AT&T can't even give Direct TV away. 50 Billion dollars down the toilet. Based on their acquisition history, I'm surprised AT&T didn't buy Blockbuster Video or Radio Shack."
"7% yield? Yes pls. I like how T took off when growth stocks collapsed yesterday......I believe in T’s cash generating potential (HBO, 5G) but also think it is a great natural hedge to the likely tech turbulence ahead (although I remain an $aapl and $qqq long......just part of a balanced diet and portfolio! I also like Michael Craft store as a short squeeze with 30% market cap short despite management reporting huge gains on top and bottom line....."
$34 by next Friday?
Real problems here when the stock cant even hold 30 for a single day
T will soon be treated like its texas brother XOM... $10 move coming hard and fast
is this company done. with all the bad moves they have made
T ~ my concern with this run up is it’s based on Covid ending immediately and things get back to normal. Thinking we’re entering a new normal. Visited downtown Denver Friday and it’s literally a ghost town . Buddy of mine in a high rise office building said building is empty might not come back
Resistance is at $30.09. Clear that and the next resistance is at $31.00. After that $32.00 and after that its old high of $39.70.
T is going deeper into debt! $14 billion deeper into debt just because of one loan! Trouble brewing for those who think their dividend is safe!
elliot Management takes big position
T has a face only a hack dividend investor would love.
Can we please stay in the 30’s?
Does anyone else have a good laugh anytime the stock goes above $30 knowing it is but a fleeting moment in time.
"If anyone is interested, the AT&T Preferred Shares (T-PA, T-PC) are at buy points."
"Soon everyone will know that T is and has been taking more and more customers from VZ and T mobile soon the damage to both VZ and T mobile will be so bad they can't hide it anymore in their earnings reports and the whole world is going to know that T is taking customers by the millions from both T mobile and VZ LOL,LOL,LOL"
I wonder if T is finally going to breakout of this pathetic trading range.
Everything depends on sub basically
"Happy dividend collector here. Nothing else worth mentioning with this stock, especially all the hot air left/right political circus junk that politicians and all cable news networks profit very well from taxpayers."
Undervalued but regardless AT&T is a Dividend investment for my Portfolio and it pays better than High Yield bonds...
T-Mobile is on it's way out.
Folks ~ I own T as well and certainly feel T has missed several opportunities to be part of the bull rally past several years and that’s to bad
"Is AT&T going to cancel FAKE news CNN, MSNBC, ABC,NBC, CBS. these networks spread to much false misinformation and lies."
"Buy now, get you first Div next month Ken."
"T seems steady, rising only 10% and moving in 10-20% range since March lows, not worried about a massive fall - will buy more for dividend"
"It seems that drop on earnings report - regardless of good or bad - seems to be the new normal in the market. I've been following many stocks closely and in the past year over 80% of them drop on earnings report, even if the report is stellar. So this is expected (and predicted if you follow my posts). However, the bottom of this dip - wherever it may be - is going to be wizard point to buy. Personally, I severe doubt if T will go below $30.50 before reaching a stable $33+ price. If next quarter is good, and appeal is rejected then - and only then - you will see T move slowly into the upper 30's."
You get HBO Max for free if you change your plan to the new unlimited data plan or you move your cell service to T new unlimited data plan . WOW VZ and T mobile are losing customers like crazy now all of them are going to T and dropping NFLX to save even more money. LOL you just can't make this stuff up
my commernt about insider buying by the board members was to imply their confidence in where the company value and stock price could be going....not to say their miniscule volume of shares will move the stock price..... .
"Ho Hum. Stock went Ex Dividend and price dropped in synch with dividend pay out. Now a day or so later and stock is back to where it was, dividend is locked up. Life is good with 6,479 shares, basically giving 12,958/year or over 1k/month"
"T is doing great but I hope it drops back closer to $29 again before March 26.If BP continues to rise, my next move will be to move my March 26 $27 covered calls out to the April 23 $28's and pick up another .11 in premium in the process. That's what happens when you trade options. You can always makes adjustments which you can't do when you own the actual shares. With shares, you either own them or you don't, no other choices. With options, you always have a lot of choices and you can always make adjustments as the stock price changes."
This will be the most over leveraged company in the world. Literally. Once it closes. Great yield and upside in time. Only trades at 10xPE but it’s a long term play. It’s one you guy. Reinvest divs in and forget about for 3 years
Beware February is going to go back to snow and freezing weather.
Did you forget about me? I just put in an order to buy more. At 30.05. Will I fill?
Up slightly on low volume again. Not a good sign for end f day.
T loves this trading range.
"Nice move today! Haven't been on here much as I have been watching my pipeline stocks soar. Long T, KMI, WMB, OKE."
32 tomorrow.
"Pat, you are creating yourself a very bullish message board by using the mute button."
Isn’t it fun watching the market rally while we sit here twiddling our thumbs.....
will come back big in the afternoon after the fed meeting
I see HBO Max as personally a convenience and it in my opinion surpasses Netflix and Disney. I have all of them but HBO Max is our go to. I'm thinking this is bigtime for AT&T. I am not just a Shareholder but also a Client.
"T has very low chance to be below $28, but very high percentage be up to $36 or higher in 12 months. With 6% dividend, it has very very low risk to buy at current price."
"AT&T Just raised there div. to 50 Cents a share, What a great investment, and company."
"If we are truly in a different era and stocks are more valuable than before, then T and other dividend stocks will soon see a bid. Or it's not different this time and the Nasdaq will collapse soon. I am leaning towards the former with the Fed printing trillions every year. If a 30 yr T bond delivers 6%, then the stock with inflation protection should be yielding 2% less than the bond. So T stock should be yielding 2% less than it's bonds, or basically yielding 4%. Unless you don't believe this time is different and the entire market is going collapse. Even then, all that fiat money will try and find some ""real"" yield because rich people still need to eat and pay those expensive houses payments."
"cmon get on the big red train, next stop 28 and then on to 27.50, but we get a divi LMAO"
Current ratio drops to .81!Lenders are going to make Telephone pay higher interest.
In Stankey's dreams AT&T is Dis+ ..... but in his nightmares AT&T is AT&T.
/BZ lots of room another 10 my best guess
The Discovery Channel is doing an excellent job of promoting their new streaming service. T should watch & learn from Discovery.
T is a perfect hedge against inflation and higher rates. $32-$34 within 2 weeks.
Where do I get free hbo?
I will be adding today. I'm about ready to retire and I am happy with a return closing in on 6 %. Already own 3000 shares at $35 so I will be averaging down.

"Goldman report on $T investor day: We maintain our Neutral rating on AT&T and our 12-month price target of $27 (-2% total return) following its analyst meeting on 3/13. We believe that AT&T outlined a compelling case for how its portfolio of mobility, broadband and streaming service have been (or should be) strengthened by its material investments in C-Band spectrum, fiber and HBO Max. As such, we have increased our long-term revenue forecasts. However, AT&T's $27bn investment in C-Band spectrum has once again relevered the company's balance sheet. Further, management's outlook for a doubling of HBO/HBO Max subs (to 120mn+) by 2025 is expected to yield EBITDA losses at HBO during this period, while investments in C-Band and fiber deployment will likely keep capex elevated."
Lol
Cramer tonight says T is too risky. Very bad news. The man is rarely wrong.
"IDK, but I think T will get some positive pin action when T mobile earnings comes out. Speaking of which, nice rebound from an unwarranted sell off yesterday."
Look at our little T bucket go!
"ers worked so hard today to get T down a whole 3 cents and yet After hours they are now losing even more money because T is now up by 8 cent LOL,LOL,LOL Get ready to say all you T haters OH no up T goes LOL,LOL"
whole system broke here. I see thousands of points sell off here. WE are at least 3000 points over priced here.
"Important number: $29.72. Why? Because at the $2.08 per share dividend, $29.72 is the cutoff to receive a 7% dividend. A big deal has been made about T and 7% so when the stock prices rises and the dividend rate drops (for new buyers), the beloved 7% rate will no longer be available and the talk about 7% will recede. Will 6% be the new standard for T?"
"Here we go again, getting pretty tired of down every day!"
How Randall Stephenson ever became CEO of ATT needs to be examined. Everything he did turned to dust -- everything!

"“Rating Action: Moody's affirms AT&T's ratings following $27 billion C-Band spectrum investment and sale of a 30% stake in DirecTV; outlook is stableGlobal Credit Research - 12 Mar 2021New York, March 12, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") affirmed AT&T Inc.'s (AT&T) Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, Prime-2 (P-2) short-term commercial paper rating, and Ba1 ratings on the company's preferred stock. The outlook is stable.The affirmation of AT&T's ratings reflects Moody's expectations that the company will be able to reduce its leverage (Moody's Adjusted Debt to EBITDA) on a post-pandemic basis to 3.5x or less within about two years following the company's debt-funded $27 billion C-Band spectrum investment (includes $4 billion of relocation costs) and sale of a 30% stake in DirecTV to TPG Capital (TPG). “"

"I have never seen such an attocious guidance for a company:-PlanManagement reiterated its guidance for 2020 and continues to expect adjusted earnings in the range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share on revenue growth of 1-2%. Free cash flow is expected to be stable at $28 billion with non-core asset monetization of $5-$10 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to remain steady compared with 2019 levels.For the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, AT&T continues to expect consolidated revenue growth of 1-2% per year. Adjusted earnings are expected to be significantly up to $4.50 to $4.80 per share by 2022 with adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%.While adjusted EBITDA is likely to grow in 2021 and 2022 driven by extensive companywide cost-reduction plan, WarnerMedia synergies, continued Mobility growth and AT&T Mexico EBITDA growth. Free Cash flow is anticipated to be within $30 billion to $32 billion in 2022..."
It's downhill
What about Parlor
Rough way to end the week. I hope March 12th will clear some things up and give positive direction. Maybe some upgrades!
Does AT&T still own the most reliable source in fake news?
"All you VZ shareholders better learn and quick to SAY OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL as VZ loses 1000's of customers daily now to T LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up . Look at all the phone numbers being ported to T LOL all new customers from VZ and T mobile"
"All the T haters get ready to say OH NO up T goes , Why because T's future is so bright you have to wear shades. LOL,LOL,LOL"
"great day for T, up 0.03%."
"T has to get rid of CNN....sell it, spin it off....it can’t be fixed"
Here we go I also hope it holds lets all give a push lol
Interesting T had trouble around 30.50......I’d like to see it smash threw it before I try a trade
Google and T rumor?
"If anybody is out there listening, a cash strapped ATT will throttle any chance of HBO returning to its former glory. A spinoff down the road would probably be more beneficial to stockholders. This merger destroyed the entertainment giant."
Daily press briefings. Wow! What a concept. The only reason not to hold a WH daily press briefing is if you are hiding something.
"The sale of DirectTV is long overdue, this stock can't move without the company dropping it's major anchor's which is the debt and DirectTV"
OK heres my take on next weeks trading. T will go to $30 by ex-divi day Jan 8th.
Facebook and Twitter need to have strong controls about what they can and can not do. Hope Congress and the Supreme Court do it.
30 is the line in the sand !
Easy come easy go.
"Why I bother to check this everyday is beyond me...my friends and I are at the age where our parents are dying..it's amazing how many are now T holders..via inheritance. BTW I'm not one, but the ones that inherited very well it seems the patriarch has held T in one form or the other for 50+ years. I looked at institutional holding and wondered why T is only 50% range. I know why, because most grandpas never sold a stock in his life..they only bought or reinvested. I asked a friend that just inherited a large amount if he was going to liquidate. He said it worked great for dad..nd if I sold anything he left me it would be like sacrilege. Definitely a different mindset from most hit and run investors. So that is why the 50% intitional investment. That is all there is for them to get. Why anyone would buy a 2.8% 10 yr and not T is beyond comprehension."
I’m content with price movement until auctions are over and we see how T sits. A quick sale would help a little for the process but looks like borrowing is still in the cards.
$T always provides a good red color contrast to the green stocks in the portfolio.
T breaking out on heavy volume. Buy all you can below $30. 7% guaranteed dividend + 33% capital gains (to $40) equals 40% gains in the short-term.
Fact: DTV right now today generates billions in free cash flow.

"US securities regulators have charged AT&T and three members of its investor relations team with selectively disclosing information to analysts covering the US telecoms company to avoid falling short of Wall Street’s forecasts. The three executives made private one-to-one calls to analysts at about 20 different research groups, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged on Friday, after discovering in March 2016 that falling smartphone sales would leave AT&T’s revenue more than $1bn short of consensus estimates for the quarter. AT&T’s chief financial officer instructed its investor relations department to “work the analysts who still have equipment revenue too high”, the SEC’s complaint alleges"
Premarket is up. What will T do?
Almost back up to where it was last week. Almost.
and the daily bleeding continues
Good time to sell CNN.
"LOL,LOL,LOL I told you T was going higher . Why because millions and millions need income and T's dividend will be over 1/2 of your return this year that you will get in the S&P 500 . Heck it was almost 1/2 of the return you would have gotten in the S&P last year"

"I'm seeing and hearing much effective self-promotion (advertising) from Disney/Hulu/Disney+, but precious little from AT&T/HBO (WarnerMedia). Also, what there is out there of AT&T choice promotions is too confusing (AT&T, AT&T NOW, AT&T Yesterday, AT&T Tomorrow, HBO, HBO MAX etc., etc.). Is there anyone in the Promotions Dept. who knows how to publicise the product?"
A dime a day keeps the dogs away.
"AT&T BOD could spin off HBO Max, which means Shareholders would benefit. However, I don't think that is going to occur personally. I would like to see HBO MAX just with AT&T. My opinion but of course. I'm more interested in 5G"

Just the truth I have no need to make stuff up when it's all so true. Do you think Corporation becoming RACIST and paying bonuses to discriminate against white are going to help or hurt race relation in the future . I have seen the future so I already know what happens , but do you really think?"
whats so hard T mgmnt? you used Cnn to install a corrupt regime of your choosing amd you still cant increase earnings? whatsamatter? not corrupt enough?
"The yahoos that surpress ideas and opinions are like Beetlejuice. If you say ""Thought Police"" three times, they suddenly show up. LMAO!"
Here we go $25 and Below continues.
AT&T Fiber broadband gives you speeds up to 1000 Mbps. If it was available in my area I would get it because Charter is charging me $75 a month for 200 Mbps. (without TV) I like their strategy of concentrating on Fiber and 5G and HBO Max.
The move to $60 has begun...
"Is the dividend safe or is the guy going to cut it? He at least sounded committed to paying no less than $ 2.08 going forward, but was he really?"
The #vz Investor's CC: starts in 30 min @ 6pm ET. Two days earlier than T enjoy if you have both stocks since T lines up for their copycat session frihttps://www.verizon.com/about/investors
"falls short on guidance, whatever, they beat expectations in some really significant ways, HBO Max in particular far exceeded estimates and that was with only getting on Roku and Fire TV in the last couple weeks of the quarter along with WW84 being the first of many major same day as theatre releases, that just got the process of getting the word out regarding an amazing offering, whatever about guidance, reality is HBO max is going to grow like crazy and eventually reality is going to hit and get us back to mid-upper 30's"
we will hit $30 today!
T is bound to leap downward someday soon.Just look how it trades.
"Funny fact: in the HBO documentary Warren Buffet admitted he shorted AT&T, around in minute 14 of that documentary."
John Stankey said at&t had a monstrous day today..Up .02 cents.
*AT&T IN EXCLUSIVE TALKS WITH TPG TO SELL STAKE IN DIRECTV: RTRS
Worse than dead money!
"dumped hbomax, dtv is next"
"T is ridiculously undervalued compared to T-mobile, VZ, Comcast, etc. T leadership has to get more vocal and tougher."
"Acquisition approved and the stock drops...acquisition appealed by the DOJ and the stock drops...yeah, the stock market is totally rational."
"All the laggards are rising - oil stocks have doubled, financials much higher, auto stocks higher, etc. Only Telecom & garbage T at decades low. Yet, leadership says nothing as they collect their 10's on $millions in salary. What happened to our Activist investors?!??"
lol look at the price. I totally predicted this!
"T is the exception to the rule, A rising tide lifts all boats."
New 52-week lows every day & the CEO says or does nothing to address it.
"Hated today, but will be loved tomorrow. That's how it goes. Accumulate."
I have no idea how much the the return on the money invested in the 5G auction will bring. Does anyone have an educated guess on how much a $10 billion investment at the action will return in one year?
"Sorry guys, no $29 today."
"Poor people are looking to make a quick buck. I understand, when I was young and poor that was my hope. If you own a hundred or 3 hundred shares, you want it to go up 10 or 15 points to sell and make a difference in your life. This isn't the stock to do that with. Anybody with any kind of real money would love to get 7%+ return on their investment. CDs, MM will get you 0.5-1.0% currently. AT&T is the type of company these folks want. Getting a nice dividend check every quarter to pay for your daily necessities is where these folks are at! So please stop complaining about the price unless you want to brag that you bought some more on a down day. If you don't understand income stream and why you want one, then please just start buying GameStop or aluminum or bitcoin or Berkshire Hathaway for that matter because it doesn't pay zip quarterly either."
The election was the time to sell CNN.The value of the division ballooned to between 15-20 billion.Not now.
Recovery trade in play... AT&T ready to go back to $40
"T proved one thing that really is the only thing that matters is T can leverage their assets and take customers away from VZ , T mobile and NFLX . As T's 5G monster grows it will take more and more customers away from it's competitors as T leverages all it's assets . That is a FACT and no one company has the assets to now compete with the 5G monster that T has now built. FACTIt's ALIVE so all the T haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
"amazing, isn't it, how heavy that little black dot on the graph gets, long about market close."
When will the C-Band auction results be released?
Saturday is the only day ticker T is not red
"Every stock at all-time highs except T - at decades low. Yet, leadership says and does nothing."
"T up almost 1%, I almost fainted"
"Hey, T is down only 8.39% since this time last year. add the divy, and you're only down 1.3%. Compare that to SPY index fund which is up 65% excluding the divy in the same time period. Hmmm. minus 1.3% vs up 66%."
Why do you investors stick with this company when you can buy into #VZ without constant drama?
One reason for the stock going down could be they are overbidding In workshirt and adding too much debt to the balance sheet just a thought￼￼
Not even half volume yet
With all this great news should pass $29.50 today
"Poor Hedge funds, have to sell their longs to make up for their short losses."
T should do a reverse stock split to make the stock price look reasonable.
Now sell CNN...

"When you adjust it for inflation, this company is worth half what it was in 1985. Must be nice being a T shareholder lol"
This thing is hideous.
What an ugly looking chart! If only this were being shorted by Citron!
"DIRECTV is Destroying AT&T, Road to below $20 Begins !"
"Hey, quite simply I am a shareholder in T, NFLX and others in different industries.I point out T and NFLX, as I am a customer also, along with Amazon Prime, and Hulu.From a customer standpoint, I believe HBO MAX is the superior of the 4, 5 if you add in YouTube which I also use (but only the free version) so not really a fair assessment.I signed up for HBO Max last month, and could not be happier. The odd part is, I am not a big tv/movie guy. I subscribed more for my spouse, but have watched it every night since signing up. Will any of this effect the SP of T?I haven’t a clue. But don’t knock HBO Max until you at least look into and read what if offers, or try a trial at least.Just wanted to post once from a customer’s perspective.GLA"
This stock is like a homing pigeon. Always seems to want to get back to $30...
Buffett takes huge position in VZ. T left out in the cold again.
OK all the bad news is now out(23B spectrum price). Let's move higher over the next few months!
"I really don't understand how some of you hate this stock so much and still hang on to it. You need to put on your big boy pants, Sell it, Take your gain's or losses, and put your money somewhere else, Why wake up every morning and be miserable, really not a good way to live with all the other stuff going on in the world. So sell, Take your money and put it in PayPal, You will be happy their, mark my words."
Thank u for some sub $28
30 it can't even hold 30.
What is surprising is why Gold is not at $5000 at least with all the money printing going on.
My faithful T shares should follow the market higher. Not a lot of craziness with this safe stock. I like it. Long and strong
Does anyone like the changes the new Pres has made so far? Do you think they're good or bad for the country? Do you think the impeachment is a waste of time and money?
March 19th. Sorry for your loss. :)
"So many people talking about the debt but forgetting about HBO yet, 5G will just be fueling HBO even more. Long term bullish on this stock."
This mega power will now have profits rolling in. Collect the div and reinvest
Did anyone else add? I did and am enjoying it immensely. Look at the report!
I am rubbing my eyes it is so green. What is happening? A short squeeze?
"The Time Warner acquisition slowly making more sense over time. HBO max will be another money maker to contribute to FCF for a very long time. Oh, HBO max subs take a hit because economy opens up? Oh, that’s right people are going to the movie theater instead so T still makes their money with box office revenue. Game of Thrones spin-off next year. Let’s just say it’s 75% of what GOT was and we’ll be talking about how it’s the only show people are talking about again."
I will go Long T when Price can get above 32 . Otherwise not interested. No need to be early for this guy!
Why do I get the feeling Randall Lynn Stephenson is still running this company?Why are we paying Stankey 22.5 million dollars a year?What has Stankey done? What is he doing?
"So I got this email from E*Trade saying that if I give them permission, they will lend my shares (I assume to people who are shorting the stock) and I can earn interest on the transactions and have full contol to sell my shares at any time. I have not yet given my permission. I am open to hearing the pros and cons of this arrangement. Serious answers only please. Happy Independence Day to all!"
"""find"" me some GA votes!"
I don't care about the stock price I like the dividend
"Bought 1000 shares of T, this morning.I also increased my position in GPK. near ATH!"
"The 7.50% dividends have held up no matter what. Something is coming and I don't think any good for us all. I'm sticking with ATT and the 7.50% they are a massive company all over the world. We are retired and can literally live off our dividends.Cross fingers, but things do not look too good for us all. 90 percent of the companies are in the red......"
HBO Max going to take this to the moon on January 27th 
"Where's Stanky, probably took the day off to sail his Yacht."
Even the MyPillow guy has been silenced!! What has happened to free speech in this country....
Morning T ~ been talking about inflation for weeks now . My normal purchase of 10 chicken thighs for 6 bucks @ Safeway were 12 bucks today ! Salmon normally 7 bucks a pound. Today 9.59 . Folks inflation is real
Markets hitting new high. 46 more action than talk.
"Signed up for AT&T TV w/ HBO MAX. So far, impressed."
Economy grows T is perfect. VZ is better in non growth economy.  USA GET mojo back T will flourish. Cheer for vaccine and strong  USA economy 2021! Happy New Year!
"T is doing great today.Looks like Vagipuss and his one man gang (ANDY) from Cheetah Slamma Jamma grade school are out in force today. Oh me, what to do. Should I run and hide or should I just ignore them. What do you think? LOL LOL LOL"
so much rides on increasing revenue someway yet mgmnt just. isnt proactive..maybe some1 @ cnn can advise?
"Do not be surprised if the Stimulus vote in the Senate Fails and the Market gets shredded . It's all past do any way. Just remember Long term capital gain and you don't want to sell T for over a year any way. Just collect the dividend and wait for the Capital gain . Have fun if your read for a great CRASH If not get ready. Always remember it's Wall Street game and you are only aloud to play , because it all Wall Streets rules you have none . LOL,LOL Yes all the rules are now one sided because the SEC has not done their job in decades FACT"
"I realized it was not AT&T, my provider on Cell phone service dropping calls when I was infuriated. It was their service provider. Anyways, I thought it was mine, but turned out they had other carriers that didn't cut the mustard. I have some cheap friends but they complain about their service but my AT&T is strong. In fact, I have to let them borrow my phone. This is for real. You pay for what you get."
"Right now, with T sitting at $29.18, selling March 26 $29.50 Covered Calls for .63 each is a better trade than selling the March 26 $29.00 Puts for .66 each. The market is going to change before this Friday's expiration so I'm going to wait until Friday to decide which way to go. If I had to choose right now, I'd buy shares, sell the March 26 $29.50 Covered Calls and hope to get my shares called away at $29.50 on March 26."
"One subtle thing that is likely happening is that on the next earnings call, the hbomax convo will detract from the dtv subs convo. Disney had to turn the discussion away from espn sub losses and they did. We will start to do the same."
"Click on profile under this stock. They have 235,000 employees. They will be forced to lay off while paying the top 5 executives millions each year. John Stankey makes 10.83 million, Randall Stephenson makes 8.64 million all the while they are running the company in the ground. They are rewarded for the huge debt they have been adding."
T is hard to hold.
anything about the Lord seems to be a mystery to you...
The Mouth of Milwaukee is MIA.
will it stay above $30. it never does.
"Dear fellow bagholders, you are not alone as shareholder. We are all together in this sinking boat."
45 Senators voted that impeachment of a private citizen is unconstitutional yesterday. That makes the impeachment dead upon arrival. Dems just wasting people's money like always.
"Well, the VZ update put a big damper on both VZ & T stocks...Not bullish for tomorrow. Too much investment for little to no returns. I cant believe T-Mobile is trading at such a high multiple. I would short it."
I believe we will see T close out the week strong!
I'm at 6000 shares and counting. Yet Another Value Blog had a nice piece this morning on the space and on $T. They make the point I made - it's trading too cheap as a Telco and as a media company. Warner assets worth at least $150Bn.
if only little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff 123456789 had any T shares......he is one sad old man that has to constantly BEG for attention on this message board 24/7......and he wonders why they kicked him off the GE message board
Every time this thing goes up it seems to be always some kind of bad news. I had this strange feeling something was off about the quick rise today in S/P... Oh well back to the 28s
Buy low into one of the most solid companies in the world. Collect the incredible dividend. This time next year I guarantee t will be about $42. Good things always come to those who are patient.
Good and steady move. North of 35 is coming.
YES!! We did it. Now if they just don't adjust it to $29.99. Isn't this stock great?What a stock lol.
all we need is an aggressive short squeeze....Just joking!
"On a serious note. I own 6,000 shares. Anyone on this board own more? I hope so. I don’t understand the hostility I’m getting."
let's shoot for a limit order on 1000 shares someplace here today......increase the dividend payment and lower the cost basis....I'm waiting
At&t $28.90? Or only going higher
"Everyone please stop obsessing over spectrum and bands. There is plenty to go around, and more to be auctioned off in the coming months and years. The average consumer has NO CLUE about spectrum and bands. They only care about value. ""What do I get for my money?"" If they perceive value, they use that service."

annnd down again whats that now8 of the last 10 tading days and one of the up days was a penny
Up 1 cent lol.
Investors are hiding in T stock...thus is up in a down market...the more the market is down the higher T stock trade...
"For you all complaining about T, look at Pfizer. Stuck in the mid-30's for 5 years."
I told ya old folks to sell T and buy Bitcoin. Its at 60K and going higher.
T needs an activist investor who gets rid of the current board. Underperforming to all peer companies.
The dividends from AT&T funds my vacation expense.
"Road to $25 next Stop, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
We should test 32-33 by end of the week. This is a perfect setup for T. Time warner business will have huge growth with the reopening.
When do they pay out dividends?
"Brace for rear entry. Heading into today, shares of the telecommunications company had lost 5.98% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.19% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.86% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from T as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 27, 2021. In that report, analysts expect T to post earnings of $0.73 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 17.98%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $44.54 billion, down 4.86% from the year-ago period."

Who put mars up there MUTED!
No increase until HBOmax comes in as a profit.  cut 1/4 dividend if so.
Stairway to h e L L.
It will be back in the 28s soon enough. Earnings weren’t that great and debt is still T’s noose.
ATT IS WAY OVERPRICED
Barrons cover story this week is about dividend paying stocks.
Just Bidem my time when the timing is right I will surprise you all w my 200 shares... No more like 5000 but who here is counting...
T~ 20 plus years of owning dish have learned that it’s a roller coaster. However something big is in play . My guess is it’s spectrum or a partner
Going down quicker now than Piars Morgan on a Sunday Britain show... YIKES!
Looks like this move in T will be extended $32-$33 leading up to earnings announcement. That level has been difficult to get through and is significant from a technical perspective. The company is clearly worth more than what the street is valuing it now and if the dividend yield is an indication compared to Verizon then any significant revenue/earnings announcement will light a fire and we could be at $37+ in a heartbeat……..
Could not have achieved a one party dictatorship without CNN. Stock is being noticed that's why going up.
If you had some with covid 19 and were in the hospital for a long time ask them if they saw Dustin and his Army of angels if so ask they is they were shown the future
Typical ex day behavior
"T has 230,000 employees, VZ has 132,000 employees, TMUS has 75,000 employees, LUMN has 39,000 employees ... ATT has TOO MANY PEOPLE .... sorry,.. management needs to get with it, they need to reduce staff by 10% in the next year!!! ...."
Couldn't close above 30 again.
This is a story only a hack dividend investor could love.
29.10 I'm out. Can't take T anymore. I'll move that $$$ into CCL
"steady 7% dividend is tough to beat long term. now then, if they would only reign in fake news CNN or dump it."
"Just think, if you bought a year ago, you're down 1.52. Add the divy, and your up 56 cents =1.7% for the year. Yawn."
was that hulked out file clerk mary beth MB bragging about a $400 profit in AMC stock?......now that is something to brag about......except she paid $36 for 1000 shares of SDOW and it's $12 now.....I don't get it
"Does CNN have a quota that to work CNN, u must be a sweet talking fruit."
Remember to Buy the Dips and lock the shares up with long term sell orders over $60 to start or any higher price you want for them. T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades.
"well everyone, was I not right? idk why you all got so excited a few days ago. This stock is so predictable. Short this till the bitter end"
What happened to $39
"And with the games with the gme amc and BB. Come on, that will be short lived. Ultimately, people will gravitate back to value, earnings and reality.Or true companies. Not burning low life short sellers cashing in on weak, or close to bankrupt companies.Buy $T Buy $NIO BUY $PHAnd consider $PYPL $BABAThere are gems out there. The phenomenon with attacking low life short sellers will not end well for both sides.Stay safe, financially and health wise.Cheers!"
AT&T CEO must step down
Bat Sandwich Muted!
"4th quarter earnings Wednesday morning. Get in before they report because this is going to pop at least 5%, maybe 6% on Wednesday. They're going to report a record breaking wireless revenue, as their trade-in offer on new phones for existing customers has been a huge success!! And HBO Max sign-ups is going to surprise to the upside with the Blockbuster Movie releases being planned for this year, far exceeding expectations. By Friday, I predict a 9% upside in the stock price. The only thing that may hold this back is if they also provide an update on the C-band auction results, which may scare off investors because of the increased debt load they'll be taking on (which they don't need right now)"
Dumping like there's no tomorrow! WHY!
11 days till earnings. Can’t wait for the stock to be traded over 30 permanently
Why is it dropping?
One step closer to $35. Good
I LOOKED AT THE EARNINGS REPORT AND IN MY EXPERT OPINION T WILL BE AT $32 IN ABOUT 20 YEARS
After the Pfizer and modern getting fast hearings the Joey f d. A has fallen asleep

"Telephone isn't able to raise the dividend this year so - We can only give Stephenson $1,000,000 this year to do nothing.It's like the Steinfeld show - about nothing!"
I see 33 soon
"+4,25% T, iam really bullish with T, but... wow!"
Remember all the baby bells came from the forced break up of Ma bell aka AT&T. Who do you think will have the best 5G.
Wow! Now T is down only 16% from where it was a year ago.
Fasten your seatbelt folks! pps $31 is on the horizon
"Time to say Hello to $25 and below. Non-stop Sinking Ship since Year 2000, Decade Old Falling Knife continues."
"Where's that ""R"" guy that told everyone he was smarter than them and that T was going to higher? He did it its 31, 30 and 29. I guess he's curled up somewhere right now."
The bulk of my retirement is in AT&T I’ve been disappointing the last year however I have taken my dividends and invested in some other companies I’ve done quite well so I really had to factor that in to my total profit of AT&T that’s why I stay with it For the long-haul stay long and strong
"AT&TCheetah angry that his ""R"" alias is getting exposed for trying to inflate (or bash) T's stock price depending on what options he holds. The guy is pure sleaze, 80ish years old by his own admission and uses the name of an Atlanta Gentlemans club as his alias. (A Gentlemans club that bought hard to be able to have 18 year old dancers as opposed to 21). He only took the ""3"" off of his name after I called attention to what it meant. He's most likely a predator or was when he could get it up. Avoid that monster."
"has we enter 2021 the wheels of hbo max launching in Europe have started rolling, hbo max just acquired a Spanish tv show and will co-produce the 2nd season hbo max launches in Europe and latin america in the 2nd half of 2021, by the end of 4th quarter they will have some generous subscribers if they screw their launch in Europe has they did in the US"

"Back down she Blows off steam again just like another daily event. I parked the mini bus back in the overhead stall for now... Far as aristocrat status someone brought up yesterday ,,, I looked it up and companies have to do consecutive 25 years of div increases. However what the article on MF said it also happened to companies like XOM. T can afford to go around 3 quarters of no div increase that's it. If they don't re-instate the increase they lose Aristrocrat... That's what it said look it up"
print money and give it away and gdp will rise - what a concept - they great give away is here - does anybody think we can afford it?
Nice
Backing up the truck at $30.80-31. It's approaching an ultimate support for the stock. Strong descending trend line from 6/16 which T has bounced off 11/16 and 11/17. Secondary support at that price from the distribution from the last 3-4 years. Potentially could bounce off to $37+
"Shorts sweating bullets right now. What’s January going to be like, fellas? Ready to cover??"
"everybody's underestimating the value those Warner assets hold, HBO max is major and just getting started, while Turner sports networks along with Bleacher Report have huge value and growth coming thanks to legalized online sports books"
"Tomorrow I'll be buying back the $28.50 Puts I sold for .55 each on Jan 8 for a penny (.01) each. I'll be selling Feb 26 Puts next but the question is, which strikes? The Feb 26 $29 strikes are selling for .61 each right now, the $29.50's for .84 each and the $30's for $1.04 each. I don't want to go too high because I might get stuck with the stock and I don't want to go too low or I could be leaving Premium on the table.I might wait for a few days before making a decision to let T shake itself out for awhile before trying to decide. We'll see what happens."
Don't post anything to jinx T's takeoff.
"With the new shares added after merger, what will the projected coverage of dividend be from the combined free cash flow?"
I have a line in the water at 29.85 but no fish biting.
"Wow, what happened? The stock was up.34 right before the open and now it's down .12. That was quick! I still think we'll be heading back to $29 again soon so let's see what happens from here."
I've held this stock for a long time. The company remind me of GE with it's CEO and Board of Director which lead GE down the wrong path while pocketing $$$ for themselves. I'm really hoping a great company with great leadership will come forward and take over AT&T.

"Look at T's payout ratio since 2011. They are doing a good job of bringing it down, and is currently at it's lowest in a decade after the TWX merger. 2011 = 78%2012 = 76%2013 = 72%2014 = 73%2015 = 69%2016 = 68%2017 = 64%Current = 58%"
Is there any dividend stock you guys would recommend?
"Given its friday, it'll be a miracle if it finishes green, sad"
5G & content streaming... better than TMUS
Bought all my shares between $27 and $29. Happy to collect the dividends for the next 10 years. No complaints here :)
Just need to add URD to their Stock Symbol
"Thanks to CaliFUrnia, AT&T can no longer offer Data Free streaming to its tiered customers that have their streaming service with their wireless.The ability to stream LIVE TV and HBO Max etc on ANY wireless plan was a HUGE differentiator that bypassed throttling etc issues even on unlimited plans of some carriers."
Hate to speak the truth about T which was the darlings of the 80s-90s. But T's best days are behind long ago and for the past decade or so it really just showing a continued Downtrend which does not look like changing anytime soon.
"I can think of two categories of companies who do share buybacks. The first is a company that cannot find a better use for the extra capital (Berkshire Hathaway). Second would be companies where the executives get paid based on the share price. I believe most companies that do buybacks fit in the second category. Erode the value of the company to increase executive salary and short term stock price. ***sarcasm*** That is a brilliant strategy!***sarcasm*** The executives can just go be an executive somewhere else, like Walmart."
bring on 27
scare those puts to close
I’m thinking of doing covered call on T but never done it before. I wouldn’t think it would be too smart to do it with earnings release coming up. Any advice from the experience call people.
att should be 100% phone service and not outsource to call centers in the Philippines
Very good last 2 minutes
Just picked me up a couple thousand shares at $28.05
"Have any of you whiners, who seem to be miserable owning T, considered selling T and buying something else?"
"Looks like T-Mobile/sprint merger will go thru. Great news for T & VZ!! It keeps a tech giant (like Amazon or Google) from the 5G service sector & price competition should loosen up. Also, it will take years to integrate a merger. T opens over $40!"
never thought id get a chance to lower my 27.99 / 7.5% div avg...thanks sellers !
"""Domestic box office plummets 80% in 2020""Here's one reason AT&T stock is having a hard time. You whiners can't forget we are in a pandemic that affects certain companies worse than others. T has held up pretty well though."
T needs HBO MAX subscribers to be up substantially for 4th Qtr 2020.
congrats to the longs....maybe the comeback starts.?
LTD on this thing is waaaayyyy out of control. I don't get the excitement.Someone please explain what I seem to be missing. I want to hear fundamentals not subscribers to HBOMax increased.
"Up 2%, short squeeze coming...lol"
OppenheimerSays ItBluntly
"another day at the exchange, a lot up, T is down."
Warner assets dramticaly appreciating in value thanks to legalization of online sports betting which is spreading rapidly state by state with full support of every major sports league as well as the sports networks which already see major increases in viewership and more importantly viewer engagement as they remain in front of that TV watching the game even through commercials when betting is involved
for alll you posters on here that are so negative on T stock. i recommend you sell what you own. and move on.

AT&T is a Very Undervalued Stock/Company and frankly We feel will go upwards of $60 pps.
Obviously the shorts and the call option grabbers hate it when I post backing up the mini-bus. Too funny I have time to sit and wait for 5G and the Expansion w Verizon and AT&T. One thing I don't get is how TMOB can say they are the best Network for 5G. In Southern Ohio some areas I couldn't even bars. T and VZ between the hills at least 2 bars and never a dropped call. You guys can keep your TMOB. I've tried most all of them. I have a tracfone on the vz network also and it works well...
"If the call goes okay, will be adding to my position. All of the gloom and doom predictions that have been going on all year, never seem to materialize. It all depends on the call now."

"Once again, I am reiterating my $55.00 target. My people have done  the homework. AT&T is a Strong Buy recommendation and I will put my reputation on the line. I am in with you and together and what the AT&T family is giving you and me. Price target $55.00"
There will no real growth until the split up the company....until then the management will continue to run this into the ground!
5g optimism and people taking the vaccine got investors excited to control people robotically
I'd be very happy if T could just maintain today's gain in tomorrow's trading session.
"It is off topic, but I have to hand it to the Robinhood traders. They have found a way around the inherent disadvantages of being a retail investor, and are now CRUSHING the Hedge Funds via short squeezes."

"Here's a real funny one from Phil. ""Mars is from another planet.""Funny huh? (haha). And Redvette loves this guy. Says Phil is one of the few on thisboard with a voice of reason. Now that's what I call REALLY funny. LOL LOL LOL"
"On the daily charts, money flow has been up ticking over the last 5 days. DI+ is above DI-. RSI is neutral. All of this could be viewed as positive and hopeful. Now it is up to T’s ER to confirm it."
ATT paid about 48.5b for Direct TV and 85.4B for Time Warner. That totals about 133.9B. It is debatable how much value these assets are worth but it is remarkable that T debt at the end of the last quarter was 185.12B. At the same time T is investing 10's of billions in 5G. I am betting that some time soon these investments will reflect a much higher stock price. I still would like T to sell non core assets and pay down debt and streamline the company. Longs will be rewarded. Hopefully soon!
"Anti - Main St.No Republican lawmakers backed the legislation, which will become law as much of the nation marks one year of lockdowns from the COVID-19 era."
Wall Street is looking for Guidance....That's it. We'll see. I am optimistic but let's wait for the conference call.
I starting to believe that the best way to make money in T is to trade the $28 to $30 swings and try to use calls on the sell side and puts on the buy side
"HBO vs Netflix subscription data is pretty interesting. If AT&T ramps up spending at HBO to match Netflix, which is can easily, does AT&T suddenly get the same PE ratio as Netflix? I think Netflix crosses 300 PE before AT&T crosses 10 PE."
"I think I'm finally down to having to only mute the Yahoo trolls daily. The duh trolls have already been long ago muted, but the paid Verizon employees are and will always remain a daily mute effort because they are big turds on the top of the pile that can unmute themselves.

"Another 'brick in the wall' - $1.1 B down- $179 B to go! :DALLAS, Jan. 1, 2019 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- ""AT&T Inc.* announced today that it has completed the sale of its data center colocation operations and assets to Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners (""Brookfield""). The company previously announced a strategic alliance with Brookfield that included the transfer of these operations and assets.Brookfield has established a wholly owned company, Evoque Data Center SolutionsTM (""Evoque""), to own and operate the assets. Customer contracts, employees supporting the colocation operations, fixed assets, leases and specified owned facilities have been transferred to Brookfield.Evoque joins AT&T's global colocation ecosystem program where AT&T will offer Evoque's colocation services to business customers. The ecosystem program offers business customers access to 350+ data centers around the world.Under the terms of the deal, AT&T has received $1.1 billion, which will support the company's goal of reducing its net-debt-to-EBITDA-ratio to the 2.5x range by the end of 2019""."
Getting near 7.5% yield. ooooh baby. I'm touching myself tonight.
Make sure you have place long term sell orders for all your shares over $60 or any higher price you want and sit back and collect your dividends as T goes higher and higher . T should go ex dividend the week of April 5-9 2021 now less than 30 days to ex dividend again . Alright.
buying in at 28

OK T will go back down tomorrow... I think.
"Results out, check news"
"Just declared quarterly dividend, $.50 / share"
Day after day after day
Anyone else take advantage of the sale today? Just what I was waiting for. Another 100 shares at $29.15. I’m happy with it. This is my saving account and it just got even better.
Would like to see this edge up to $34 before the June 12th news........hopefully a run back to $37 or higher afterwards. There shouldn't be anything holding it back after June 12th.
Is WSB betting for T?
"CNN reporting about all the south of boarder future citizens coming over in droves, not being tested for viruses and put on buses to visit you. I LIE, U WILL NOT SEE ON CNN. AT&T will pay along with the rest of nation."

Sold the Jan 29 $28.50 Puts this morning for .55 each. If the stock closes BELOW $28.50 on Jan 29 I get to keep the Premiums from the Puts I sold but I will have to buy the same number of shares as the Puts I sold for $28.50 each. If it closes ABOVE $28.50 nothing more will happen and I get to keep the Premiums from selling the Puts.
Sell the news
T back to the debt market. Who’s buying? Read were the big banks are managing the sale but that’s not the same as buying.
"Stankey sounds very Positive so Far. Giving great answers to that bum Faber. ( Fiber) Thank God that Idiot Cramer is off, He hates T."
They are making decisions without shareholders authorization.
You could draw a stock out of a hat and do better. T basically pays people a dividend to stay lost at sea.
Does AT&T actually know that no one believes a word that comes out of CNN
Craig Moffett is at this moment $10 off on his Verizon target ($66) and $6 off on his AT&T target ($24). Next time you see that guy quoted in an article you're reading just stop reading and move on to the next article. It's not worth reading. Or his partner Nathanson.
If the Dow Jones is supposed to go up 6% this year why wouldn’t you hold AT&T and collect 7%?
$32 closing?

"This statement was made by Biomedical scientist and founder of Fibrogen company few weeks ago. Biomedical scientist knows CGM technology better then anyone on these chat rooms.If you truly believe SENSEONIC is going to revolutionize CGM technology in a few years, then hold for long term. It is high risk, but very high reward stock. It could easily 30X from here, don’t pay attention to constant gyrations in the market. I always get inspiration from this Biomedical scientist who has been long term holder of Senseonic. If anyone would knows about CGM technology, it would be Biomedical scientist. He is also Founder and CEO or FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond.“"
Fly me too the Moon and do it very Soon!
My position in T FINALLY tuned positive with this morning’s move. Now wondering if I should unload some of the most expensive shares (as high as $36.85) for some TLH.

Has any trading day of the year 2020 happen with T +3% ? Strong outperformance of indices today !
why did this sell off from 30.87 down to 29.70
10 days to the announcement by the judge.
@R looks like you are right. Weak hands are pillaged by the strong especially near the end of the day.
With HBO MAX successT will have a good result!Load Up!!!!
"At close there were 23 call contracts in the money, there were 14,270 put contracts in the money. Puts were not being closed. Many will take the assignment if the option"
I have followed T since 2002. In the past 18 years it's been stuck in a $20-$30 range.(see max chart)When will it fly?
"So question is should I hold, sell or buy more. Inherited T last fall at 33.50. Sold early 2018 36.00. Bought again at 33.50 in the spring. 60+ yr and not great at stocks. Any thoughts?"
This thing should close around $30 today. Most probably slightly below $30.
TD Ameritrade finally posted T dividend to accounts at 11:28 am. At least two hours late by my standards!

a year ago little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff 123456789 advised this message board to buy BP at $31 with its $2.52 per share dividend......ok so after BRAGGING about it he was warned that he dividend was going to be slashed and BP is now $23 with a$1.26 dividend......plus over on the GE message board a few years ago little pee wee cheeto puff freak was BRAGGING 24/7 about shorting the stock and gambling with company put options.....shareholders complained and he was banned.....this is cheeto puff's world of a con artist......BEWARE
"The only thing that really matters is T has built a monster that is taking customers away for both T Mobile and VZ which is a great thing because both T Mobile and VZ CAN NOT be trusted with your data now. T is now the only American company the Government can trust to protect America's data . That is why the Government gave the first responders to T and T's network because they can trust T to protect the American people, and their data T Mobile was founded by the EU's one world order and can not be trusted to protect America or the American people because of their one world order agenda and VZ has turned the Company over to Han's from the EU and it looks like VZ have been invaded by the EU's one world order as VZ now Censors Americans and Censors what you can see and read. VZ is now showing they can not be trusted with your data or any of America's data. Pick what company you can trust because your data and your companies data could be the only thing that saves your job in the future of the EU's one world order agenda."

"Am I wrong, but this stock had 3 splits, 3 for 1 and 2, 2 for 1, and a div. which takes value off the stock, If T did not do these things the stock today would be worth Hundreds of Dollars in Value. I am long term, 23 years, I have made a lot of money from T. You need to be long long long term and be very Patient. Am I nuts because if I am, its because of looking at this site. I think I must Mute Myself, but some of You are very Funny."

"Dead Money. Very Bearish outlook going forward, should test $20 or below within 2 years."
Motley Fool is promoting T today. They say that the dividend is safe.
"T has some pretty big debt of ~170bil (but it’s equity ~160-170bil) Debt to equity ~1 (not perfect but can be worse ) VZ has some pretty big debt ~150bil (and pretty low equity of ~65bil) Debt to equity ~ 2.2 (pretty bad ) TMUS has pretty big debt of ~110bil (and about ~65bil in equity) Debt to equity ~ 1.9 (a lot rudder then T as well ) .So after checking those companies they all not perfect) . But difference is T is monster cash generator (3x times more then VZ , and x12 times more then TMUS ) and with mostly lower debt to equity they can pay it off quicker than any other competitors and for sure now it most stupid time to pay off debt because it’s pretty cheap (even trying to compare Netflix as a side competitor , it’s totally overvalued mess ) . What buying me other than those already enough to buy factors that T are really trying to improve its business with strong moves in different directions to attract costumers (yes Direct was mistake but you can grow the company without doing mistakes , and good part that T can afford it because again of good cash flow which will be only bigger ) . More then that they care about shareholders with really stable divs . I own 17200shares of T average of 27.32$ and pretty confident in my 8%/year (good enough already ) plus I can’t predict the market but I would say 50-60$ would be really fair price to T especially with those easy printed money in USA ."

I am (was) up 2.4% on my trimmed holdings as of yesterday. Lots of cash on sidelines. This puppy gets dragged down enough I will start the truck back up. T can be played just fine AS PART of a comprehensive investment plan if you were lucky enough to trim on artificial spikes and then cost average down sub 30. People rushing to buy shares at every dip may not be doing so well.

Can we close trading for the day right now while it’s up $.64 it’s biggest one day gain in recorded history because we all know what’s going to happen the traders come in short the hell out of it and it’s going to close down below 30.
"6.7% dividend that has been raised in lockstep since 1986 including during 2008/2009. + huge growth prospects with 5G (new mobile units coning online from Tesla vehicles and other and manufacturing robots, etc) + new streaming service to compete with Netflix launching in 2019 + increasing international expansion, all while the price is close to the cheapest its been historically = price is a buy. Whole business is looking to expand in the grand scheme and the divy is covered 2x by cash flow."
"March 19 $31 calls being a push up force. I have 16 covered calls out there I sold at .44. I do this a few times a year make an extra dividend payment or two out of it. I do that inside my IRA so no paperwork. Of the 7 times I have done this, only once was the call exercised. And that one time the stock did not go that much over the strike price and I simply bought back in shortly after that. Of course all the times I kept the premium."
This move today has everything to do with options expiring tomorrow. I'm sure the most money they could make at the expense of the little guy was to push towards 30.
T is red?Say it isn’t so!

"I sold the Feb 26 $28.50 Puts on Friday rather than waiting because I thought the big boys might just push the price towards $29 again after dropping it on Friday to let the $29, $29.50 and $30 Calls expire worthless. The higher the share price above $28.50, the lower the premium on the $28.50 Puts so it looks like I may have made the right decision to sell the Puts last week rather the waiting. If the stock continues to rise the premiums on the $28.50's will drop and the premiums on the $29's will rise. I'll be keeping an eye on this today and if the spread is high enough I might just buy back the $28.50's I sold for a lot less than I sold them for and then sell the $29's for more premium. That's called a Roll Up when you do that. And THAT Anonymous is how you take advantage of the market to maximize your gains. Right now I've already got .71 per share in the bag from selling the $28.50's on Friday, let's see what happens from here."

"There has never been a better time for T, or any company for that matter, to acquire debt. Because of the low interest rates, T was able to refinance its debt and lower cost by 30 billion dollars. That’s money that would have been used to pay wasteful interest payments but now can be used to buy spectrum. That’s a very beneficial trade off, interest payments for spectrum. S.L."
"AT&T Inc.AT&T (T) is America's largest telecommunications company by market cap, with only Verizon (VZ) representing a competitor of similar size.T's current corporate structure stems from an intricate array of mergers since the old Bell System's 1984, but today's version of AT&T has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years. Still, T's valuation has declined recently due to two factors.The first is rising U.S. interest rates. With a dividend yield above 6% and a very recession-resistant business model, income investors often use AT&T as a higher- yielding bond substitute. But as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed to around 3%, some investors have been selling AT&T stock in favor of lower-yielding (but safer) fixed-income instruments.Meanwhile, AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner faced a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit that T only recently won. However, the merger has now gone through, and we believe this should catalyze AT&T's share price to go higher in coming months.But for now, the stock remains relatively cheap. AT&T should deliver $3.45 of fiscal- 2018 earnings per share, which implies just a 9.4 price-to-earnings ratio. For context, AT&T's 10-year average P/E has been 13.4.So, valuation expansion going forward should be a meaningful contributor to this stock's future total returns."
"ATT/CNN ""We may think about selling it if its losing money!That's right wait until it has no market value, then we'll do something.CNN has been losing viewers since former President Trump left office at a record rate. The Atlanta-based cable news network dropped nearly half of its audience in key measurable stats since January following a brief post-Election Day spike, according to Nielsen Media Research.From Nov. 4 to Inauguration Day (Jan. 20), CNN averaged 2.5 million primetime viewers. But since President Biden took office, they've averaged only 1.6 million primetime viewers through March 15.CNN’s viewership during the 8-11 p.m. ET slot dropped 36% since Biden moved into the White House. Even more so, the viewership decline was even sharper among the key demographic of all adults aged 25-to-54, plummeting 47% during the same period."
Open your eyes Sleepy Joe.
I told you when it was down in pre market they slammed it. Now imagine what this will do the next day the market turns around.

"yeah, sure...$28.84"
I heard there is a consumer movement to Stop buying AT & T products or services and to sell T stock because T owns and enables CNN.
"Telecommunications giant AT&T rose 0.7 percent in the premarket Friday after an analyst at Raymond James upgraded the stock, noting it trades at a more attractive valuation than rival Verizon.Analyst Frank Louthan raised his rating on AT&T to outperform from market perform. He also issued a price target of $34 per share, which represents a 12.3 percent upside over the next 12 months.""The outlook for positive earnings growth combined with a strong de-levering story are likely to drive the shares to outperform,"" Louthan wrote in a note to clients. ""AT&T trades at a discount to Verizon of ~3.5x turns of EPS and FCF, with 250 bp higher dividend yield. We believe that the combination of positive earnings growth and delivering over the course of the year will being investors back to AT&T."""
"Might close the gap at 27.70, then hope for the best."
Stock goes higher over the next couple of weeks don’t forget reinvesting of dividends coming up soon
"T is the textbook definition of a falling knife, 2 decade ago was $60, A decade ago T was $40s, Today it's in $20s. It's not hard to predict we will see below $20 next soon."
"Not sure why Cramer keeps touting Verizon as a good dividend pick. I can currently get two shares of At&T for about the same price as one share of Verizon. That way I get almost twice as much dividend income, and At&T stock has much more growth potential than Verizon."
Comcast missed out on Fox. And Disney years before. Do they try to do something here?
We need a Short Squeeze! AT&T is completely undervalued with a Strong Dividend. We need to squeeze the Short Hedge Funds.....It's coming!!!
Another Motley Fool hit job article out on ATT today.
Concerning the next earning on 1/27: Assuming the communications business is as expected all eyes will be on the HBOMax numbers. A major increase in the numbers will be next catalyst for T moving higher. Am looking forward to this earnings report far more than the recent past.(with baited breath)
"Anywhere i look, i can see contradicting ex-dividend dates. Based on AT&T-s official site, it seems that actually it wasn't yesterday, but today instead.Confirmed record date is the 11th, by all means.https://investors.att.com/stock-information/historical-stock-information/historical-common-dividends/att-inc"
"the scary part is T sinks in the biggest bull market and Bitcoin is now 27,000 what is going on out here, this is insane"

"While the world was passing ATT by the last 10 years, the quarterly dividend went up 9 pennies.And! The stock price hasn't changed.That's not stability. That's dead."

"What a surprise. T getting crushed today, already near decades low. Meanwhile, VZ up. Just not acceptable. We need new leadership & a new Board."
Me just drive from Vinnings Ga to Glenridge Dr in Atlanta. Me want to find best path for people coming on H1B1 to drive to work at their new jobs at T. Maybe a lot of homes for sale from layed of Americans at T. Maybe they should be moving in there.
"LA movie theaters might be opening in a few days. By the end of the year, they are all going to be open folks. Thanks to our last president. Not the current one."
"T closing price on Friday was $32.68, why does it show the previous close was $32.18? Is that the 50 cents dividend?"
"I suppose one could build an argument that T has been building a base for over a year, and another argument that it is building a penant. What's the saying? The longer the base, the higher in space? At some point, it's gonna make a move. Which way? Place your bets."
This stock hasnt been the same since they halted their yearly dividend increases. Another clueless decision by management. The relative strength index on this stock is plain out embarrassing. Has Stankey been seen this yea?? - our gutless CEO is nowhere to be found as shareholder value crashes.
"Its this.Lily, the T ad gal, is looking a little tired, and her material is weird..laboriously pushing big 5G logo set pieces.

Maybe when tsla starts to tank.."
My Analysts have a $42 target pps ...I personally believe it's very undervalued and is going to $60...But I have only been in this game for most of all my life. Remember me when it hits $60

My thought would be @ 35. Next week.
Another day of boomers bleeding this company red with Divs. DIS within 30 cents of their all time high today after cutting their dividend to ZERO. T wont compete until covid takes out the last of them. Good riddance
T will be falling off a cliff like it always had been for more than a decade. Will be lucky to see $25 in a quarter.

"Enjoy the div and remember, this is a 40$ stock"
Today close $30.01. That would make me very happy.
any ideas on when t comes off the mat and catches up to the rest of the market?
"Interesting comment from a different forum:The investor meeting they all but came out and said that until 2025 (if things go very well for us) you can expect no revenue growth, no eps growth, no dividend growth, no buy backs, and debt will still be relatively high (2.5 debt to ebitda).They say HBO Max will not break even until 2025 and that is with 150 million subs... So, my question is what is going to happen to Turner (and DirecTV) over that time frame? What will happen to the movie business? Are they still going to be giving away free movies with HBO Max? I don't know about other people, but I have HBO Max. Which means I have no intention of paying for movie tickets when I can watch it at home for no extra cost.Then we have to look at the competition. Both TMUS and VZ have superior spectrum positions and may be able to sell fixed broadband internet nationally while AT&T will be restricted to a small footprint if they stick with fiber. Someone is going to be on the wrong side of that equation. Either VZ and TMUS are wrong or AT&T is wrong. Both VZ and TMUS are predicting growth to come from adding fixed wireless broadband. If it doesn't happen they will be in trouble (especially VZ)."
Who lit the fire? Unusually fast little jump up. Fairly meaningless in the grand scheme.
"The question you have to ask yourself is Has T done things to make T a much better company in the future.

So under priced here. It should be at its high here. Not near low. Pays great dividend. Very stable. Beats money market yield period. Whole system is broken here. Nasdaq is so over priced . Needs at least 30% sell off here. Its that over priced. Whole system is a joke with Democrats in control here. They dont do well when they are in control of government in office.

The FED controls interest rates. They have INFINITE CASH to buy up treasuries like they are buying now. $120 billion/mo.People don't understand what INFINITE CASH can do. SAD.
the second best thing is having ATT pay my dividend but best is when short sellers pay it for them
@ cheetah...thinking of getting out of ownership in T...just trade options for awhile...think you have best idea...if mkt plunges i believe T will do better than most l AM CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITIES ACROSS BOARD. thoughts/options
If the price creeps up slowly and I keep getting the dividend I'm happy. I didn't buy this stock to get rich quick.
Just added more to my position. Great dividend stock.
"T, the $28-$29 stock. T appears stuck in this range because T is known as a low growth stock with that juicy 7% dividend. If the stock goes up too much, the dividend rate would drop below 7% and investors only want T for a 7% plus dividend. Personally, I would accept 6% dividend if I knew I could capture some capital gains. But below 6%, would invest elsewhere."

"Elliott back on board, for better or worse"
"T has been trading within a band for the last 20 years or more with a high of around $42.00, a low of around $23.00 with a midpoint of $32. During that period, the vast majority of T’s highs and lows closed above $28.00. Essentially what this means is, as an investing strategy, if you buy T at or below $28.00, you have a good chance of preserving your capital while gaining the dividend. If that is your intention, then you should do well. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, but 20 years of data is not without meaning.S.L."
Looks like $30.02 close. Ex div tomorrow will open at 29.50.
Thought for sure there would be news this morning to explain yesterday's rise.

"Post resolution of the DOJ appeal will settle the stocks future, a positive outcome will push it to $40 minimum. Almost any outcome will be positive as the worst case would force them to sell some of the assets which will fortify their financials."
I have owned T for about 25 yrs. The reason I got into T was because my mother started with T when she was 16 years old. She worked her way up and retired in 1995. She is 95 today. She has not purchased any stock since 1995. I will say she gets a nice chunk of change every quarter. I have put a small amount in every month. I have it set up in a DRIP plan that I reinvest all dividends. I probably will never get to where she is at today. T has been nothing but a straight line for the last 25 yrs. but if you just forget about the stock it will be $ when I retire.
"AT&TTucker Carlson talking about Stankey right now. Stankey is very Liberal and Tucker just did a story on Bank of America going through its customers transactions after the Capital Riots and looking for extremists to report to the government. Tucker said he'd going to dig into what AT&T might be doing with all its data. Stankey said Jeff Zucker of CNN was doing a ""fabulous job"" last year......"
"The main advantages of the 5G are a greater speed in the transmissions, a lower latency and therefore greater capacity of remote execution, a greater number of connected devices and the possibility of implementing virtual networks (network slicing), providing more adjusted connectivity to concrete needs."

Sell CNN for $20B to Bezo and payoff that Godzilla debt.
"Accumulate here for great yield + upside, read JPM upgrade report, $38 next year, GL"
Free printed money hurts stocks like T.
Why would T go down tomorrow? At worse it should trade right here. Bad Market news is good for high dividend paying stock like T.
We all miss Obama and how he cut the deficit after we got out of the Bush Great Recession.
Now AT&T starts to trade normally. Easily to $35.
How come down 0.07 feels like it's up +1.00?
Just a coincidence that T jumped after Zucker announced he will be leaving at the end of 2021? Probably not. This will probably increase speculation that T will be looking to unload CNN in the near future. With this news that could very well happen sooner than later.
"**** HERE IS WHAT HBO MAX MEANS IN NUMBERS FROM ARTICLE*** HBOMAX could add an additional 50 mil global subscribers within three years, which would drive significant growth in T’s earnings stream. I estimate that 50 mil additional subscribers paying $14.99 per month would add $0.76 to T’s EPS, and 24% above FY20 consensus estimated EPS of $3.18. Additionally, I believe that T will enjoy significant margin expansion as they move their content to HBOM, because T will gain the economics of their network and cable distributors as they are disintermediated, which I have not factored into my numbers. The $0.76 in additional EPS could be worth $19+ per T share, assuming this EPS stream gets a 25x P/E multiple, which may be conservation given the growth profile. Furthermore, I think the 50 mil add estimate could be conservative based on all the recent positive developments at HBOM. As reference, the HBO platform currently has around 57 mil global subscribers, although HBOM has only launch in the US thus far. As comparison, Disney+ and Netflix have global subscriptions of 86.8 mil and 195 mil. On December 10th, Disney+ reported subscriber additions of 13.1 mil subs since October 3rd, and estimated they would be at 230-260 mil subscribers by 2024, both numbers were significantly above expectations. I think it is HBOM’s turn to show big numbers in the coming months. *consensus estimates from yahoo finance"
"In 5 years, T will reach $30. Thats for sure."
"Now hear this, Jasmine: Take your spamming elsewhere. We won't miss you either."

AT&T marketing for HBO Max is pathetic. I have had Netflix and my girlfriend Disney nonsense but HBO MAX is the King!!! It's the Top Dog of streaming but very little advertising. AT&T needs a new Marketing Director because it's easily #1 but not much marketing.
"OK --- AT&T bought Time Warner, thanks to a CEO that is no longer a CEO.The question now is: What is AT&T going to DO with WarnerMedia --- if AT&T doesn't MARKET and PROMOTE WarnerMedia as effectively as the competition markets and promotes itself???"

"BREAKING NEWS ! ATT MERGER WITH TIME WARNER.............HERE WE GO !AT&T Could Learn Tuesday Fate of Time Warner Deal - ReportAT&T Inc. could learn as soon as Tuesday whether it can finally move forward with its acquisition of Time Warner and put behind it the legal battle with the Justice Department over the $85 billion deal, Bloomberg reported.The telecommunications giant and the Justice Department are awaiting a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington about the government's effort to reverse a lower-court decision allowing the merger.Under an agreement with the Justice Department, AT&T promised to put Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting in a business unit separate from AT&T's DirecTV business. It also agreed to a firewall between the two. That agreement, which was intended to prevent a full integration of the companies if the government wins its appeal, expires Thursday, Bloomberg noted.Because the appeals court issues its opinions on Tuesday and Friday mornings, it would have to rule Tuesday on the Justice Department's appeal before AT&T can end the separation agreement and proceed with the integration, according to Bloomberg."

T has been a $30 stock for over 20 years so where do you expect it to go?? Don't say the news going to be different this time because there has been lots of news, both good and bad, in the last 20 years. And don't say the charts or the fundamentals are different this time because there have also been lots of charts and differing fundamentals over the last 20 years. T is what it is and it's a dividend stock and nothing more. People buy and hold for years and years without trading or selling and that keeps the price fairly steady...........no matter what. T is a $30 stock and if you're expecting either a lot higher or a lot lower, you're fooling yourself. Put those charts and books away, they don't work with T!!"

So the articles that I read always bring up that ATT paid $67B for Directv and may be selling it for $15B but I have not read any articles that said how much revenue Directv produced over the 6 years. I think Directv may have generated about $140B in revenue over the 6 years. I am thinking that they may sell a part of DTV and still get some of the revenue. Maybe a partnership that will include WB content. ATT may also be able to take a tax loss on the deal. Good things are happening.
"Very strong in pre market, up .45"
AT&T is up! But still grossly undervalued. Any purchase under $30 is a once in a generation buying opportunity.
"""Confident we're going to meet the 2.5x this year. We may meet it early. If we you do meet it early, we'll have a decisionto make. We'll have a decision to make, do we stay on the same torrid pace of debt paydown or do we start evaluating whether we commit some of it to other things like potentially stock buyback.""""So let me make sure I'm continuing to be clear and repetitive, and I apologize for that. But we expect to hit this year, and we may hit earlier this year, our 2.5, but we will hit that. We will see -- live up to the commitment, we're going to do the show-me on what we've said about that. So that's the first priority.But once you're there, then you have to go through the normal evaluation of cash cost of equity, cash cost of debt, what -- where is your stock price at, what's the value of it, where you think your value is, what's the best answer for your shareholders. And so we'll do that in normal course. We've done this before. We'll go through that same process. We will get down to the 2.5 range just like we told you. We're going to live up to that. But right now, there's a good opportunity for us to exceed that and even exceed that this year in the near term here. So we'll likely have to face this decision point."" ~ John Stephens, 5/14/2019https://investors.att.com/~/media/Files/A/ATT-IR/events-and-presentations/ATT%20John%20Stephens%20at%20MoffettNathanson%20%20May%2014%202019.pdf"

This is a great stock for people that want no risk and a 2% return.
57 cent gain from earlier this morning.
Love how people say down 25% in 2020. Only because it was up that much in 2019 but this is normal for T price range
"ALL the T haters Say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"I'm long T, T is moving in the right direction and will benefit big time from Time Warner and 5 G. The price of T is an absolute bargain in this market.

T won't drop much and will be sought after for 7+ dividend driving the price higher. Time will tell..."

I just placed an order to buy back the $28.50 Puts that I previously sold on Jan 8 for .55 per share for a penny (.01) each. They will expire worthless today if the stock closes above $28.50 however options can still be exercised up to 5:00 PM (5:30 PM for the Nazdaq) on expiration date. A penny per share is cheap insurance to make sure they don't get exercised in the event some dramatic news event were to happen after the close today.
My broker at Fidelity told me I had to keep the stock through pre-market today to keep the dividend.
It's December 28th and At&t still owns the most reliable name in fake news CNN..
Look at time Warner pe before merger and compare it with T pe. Eventually T will reach time Warner pe prior to merger. This will give you an idea how high T will eventually go. In other words T doubling in price is not unreasonable. T is a STRONG BUY at this cheap level.
I need T to close above $28.50 on Jan 29 for the Jan Puts I sold to expire. Then I can sell the Feb 26 $28.50's which are currently selling for .94 per share.
Being heavily into 5G makes this a good investment in my opinion.Add the 7% dividend to that and it's a keeper.
Good evening T ~ inflation has been on my mind and now it’s coming . Lamb chops and salad. Go dish
Can't post anything that disagrees with the left.
Still waiting for news from auction before I buy at this level. That sizable added debt with lower guidance could have major impact.
Best ready for 5G.I would choose TMUS over VZ anyday. Also a far better investment than T.Best spectrum means less overhead cost due to less cell tower. 5G is 15x more expensive to set up and VZ needs a lot more cell towers (possibly through lease and joint networks).Also TMUS isn't necessarily in needs for mid band whereas VZ must have this. VZ's network plan will be in mess if it goes to 6G and beyond.TMUS is a clear winner
Just added more shares to my position. Thank you all sellers.
pls print some more money - this market is getting boring - mean while the golf courses are packed - who wants to ever go back to work
"POOR suckers that way over paid for T Mobile are losing their dASS just wait when the next earnings report shows they are losing customers to T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX LOL,LOL,LOL"
i just want to know how much of debt they paid down
Guess we might be able to start thinking about $30 again.
"People this stock will go over $40 a share at some point of your life in the future whenever that may be until then just sit back relax and earn $2 a share per year in dividend and every time it gets close to 52 weeks low buy some more ,the only thing you'll be sorry about is why you didn't buy more,I promise and if you can't invest your money long term then you shouldn't be investing,this is AT&T they're not going anywhere they will be around long after your grand children."
"Your investment timeline outlook is a significant variable. Everyone's points on the next 2-3 ish years are valid. There are significant heads winds in the that short time frame (2-3 years), but as Buffett says, the best duration to hold a stock is forever.I admit, I am in at an average of ~$31.50 for 4,200 shares. However, considering I am 20 years away from retirement, the compounding benefit of the dividend along with the outlook that they will get the Balance Sheet tightened up, the outlook is favorable. Key is to not put all your eggs into one thing and diversify with the an outlook that allows you to not sweat the price movements or chase returns. This is just a portion of my portfolio, that yes, I wish it was doing better today, I am holding for the long term. Patience today breads success tomorrow."
"April 2019 golden cross,the move was 28 to 37 in 6 months.30% for 6 months exact same setup."
"Don't forget, T is defensive...."
I think we get back to $30 in the next two to three weeks. AT&T looks to be spending about 25bill on spectrum rights. Might seem like a lot of money but it’s going to be what keeps their money maker going. And expanding. I’m looking forward to the bid results
I think Vagi what's his name and ANDY are feeling a little jealous this morning. LOL
Will T cross $30 this week? Maybe.
Going over 30 and holding this week
Is this stock halted ?
"Talk about manipulation. On Squawk Box Joe Kernan reported the quarter with nothing but good news. Phone accounts up over 800,000 vs 400,000 forecast. HBOMax doubling now over 44 million, EPS up, and its was on the screen down 76 cent! T should be up a dollar in pre market based on the numbers."
"Upped my AT&T position by another 15%. AT&T 5G-E making headlines now. Sure, some say it is just rebadged 4G LTE, but bottom line is that it is in line with 5G standards, which by the way 5G is a TRANSITIONAL technology which builds off of existing 4G-LTE standards/spectrum/tower/network infrastructure!The 5G-E nay-sayers are having their fun, but the facts (which 5G institutional&power investors already are well aware of) specify that 4G infrastructure is a VERY IMPORTANT part of the transition to micro-cell 5G. The moment AT&T turned on 4G systems with 5G capabilities (double the speeds of legacy 4G/LTE) which use existiing 4G/LTE infrastructure of course they will call out the fact that initial 5G is rolling out (via product call 5G-E). Great marketing and spot-on from a standards support perspective.....that is why I added!"
"Market could go up 75% while T does nothing and T investors will say “at least I’m getting my 7% dividend.” You can’t make this stuff up, lol."

Im not spending a penny in Georgia ever. Not Pennsylvania either. No desire to visit Michigan or Minnesota. So remember when you cheat at voting Democrats then we wont spend money in your state.
"ATT is a BUY because it is at current levels where it does not belong. Basically, a once in a lifetime opportunity back up the truck or top off during this time with cheap shares. VZ on the other hand is a HOLD at best or a SELL at its levels. Basically gradual capital erosion with capital loss and an undefined future with only a make believe 5G product. No First Net, No license fees, no box office, no media bundle, no ad revenue. Just 5G.Coupled with the uncertain, bloated market, the choice to park your money is more clear than ever. Once T hits the high 30s is when the choice between the two blurs out and some capital preservation and diversification is warranted based on current circumstances at the time. But for now, it is ALL IN for T for the near long haul with minimal risk and a massive parachute."
This is a place for T investors. Take your politics somewhere else. Political post will be flagged.

Looks like Presidente Dufuss is going to get gasoline to $5 a gallon and probably double everyone's electric bill. But we can all afford it when we get one of those $15 an hour jobs installing Chinese solar panels.
Will T beat the consensus $.73 eps estimate when they report January 27?
it has been beaten so bad by the shorts
DEMS win T goes up. $40 by the end of 2021.
The direct tv spin-off just confirms wht we all knew. At least now AT&T got some cash to pay down debt and will continue to share in the dtv cash flow. Hopefully new management at dtv does well and AT&T in the future can sell out for more
Thanks Federal Reserve!

we shall see 30 soon!Go Tfor EV look into NGA too!
"Gotta watch how Disney does with their release of ""Mulan"" on streaming for 30 bucks a pop. If it's successful it would be big news for AT&T and HBO / Time Warner. Personally, I'm not paying 30 bucks to watch a movie in 5 of my lifetimes but hey I'm pretty frugal."
Will HBO add enough new subscribers to help T beat eps estimates when they report 1/27?

T is a value stock. Investors see doom and gloom but they are wrong. Look at the past 100+ years. Great time to buy especially for long term. Short term may be a little volatile. Long T.
"I've been with T for many many years. I've made money, how, by buying when its 27 and selling when it hits 31. Then it goes back down. Once upon a time it hit 41. Never again. Too much debt, too many shares. Dividend sounds great, but I've made more putting the money in other stocks. T is great when current admin goes nuts with tax raises, but invest the money in a company thats moving right now. Not every company is GME, but there is a lot of movement and profit right now. Just my 2 cents. This company always finds a way to go back to 26 or 27."
"Why the move in T higher last week easy, because Wall Street got the HBO Max numbers , Get ready for Take off because T is going a lot higher. Wall Street always gets the information before everyone else. FACT"
What will the TPG deal do to T's cashflow and earnings?
"“AT&T will webcast a presentation by John Stephens, AT&T Inc. senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, at the Citi Global TMT West Virtual Conference on January 5.

My Dividend is in my account!! Thanks AT&T...Guess who's buying a new ser of Golf Clubs  
Volume for the next hour will speak on how we finish up today
"The rhythm of T is to flounder aimlessly until it approaches its x-dividend date or some news event. T could see a rise prior to its ER date if expectations are positive. What I find encouraging is that T has used last year’s very low interest rate to refinance its debt saving approximately 30 billion over the next 5 years. (Correct me if that amount or time period is off). HBO Max is no Netflix, but if it makes T money, it is no Direct TV either. I honestly do not expect any surprises out of the next earnings report and fully expect T to continue its floundering for the foreseeable future unless market conditions greatly improve."
GME headed back to the land of wind and ghosts.
"Dividend or not, Stephenson has got to go."

Any tax savvy people about? I'm thinking about setting up Roth IRAs from me and my wife. Is each of our limits 6k if we are under 50 or is that the total limit? Can I transfer shares of T straight into the IRA or would I have to sell them first then but them in the IRA? I like the idea of being paid tax free dividends and that there is no age withdrawal requirement.

"I welcome $40 as some have suggested on this board. Unfortunately, there are always the inevitable pull backs and the technicals are looking like the short term trade has gotten a little beyond itself. Bottomline I'm much happier at $33.68 then recently when we were down around $31+. That matters when several thousand shares are on the line. So don't fault me if I bought some cheap PUT insurance because I really don't want to lose ground if any type of gravity were to set in."
"What good is a 6% yield if the price declines 10 per year. Switch to TMUS before it recovers 135+....sure...the big div is gone, but you get the 5G leader....growth is the way to play the sector. Always wise to choose the best in breed. The TMobile/Sprint combination is taking share...that's the only sign you need."

"So what do serious shareholders think about the ""Analyst and Investors day"" this Friday? Business strategy and Capital allocation will be discussed.

T is a thirty dollar stock so don't expect too much with your growth projections."
I think I might sell T and buy this back when I am 90 years old.

T's CFO needs to buy & put Bitcoins on its balance sheet. That may move the stock. T has to change its perception from doormat to innovator.
Shouldn’t T have a good chance to beat the quarterly estimates since HBO Max most likely has increased its subscribers?
19 jan = Netflix earnings. Important news for T.

T down .44 right now @ 3:05pm from yesterday so it's really UP .08 !!
"Massive correction on it's way all bought and paid for LOL,LOL,LOL by Wall Street"
I'm hoping T goes to $30 + soon so I can sell and say goodbye. The DTV partial sale won't even cover the newly incurred 5G auction debt. Poor mgt has buried T in debt and will take many years to get back to a reasonable debt level. Other ways to earn 7% dividend with less risk.
GO JOE GO!! SO FAR SO GREAT!!!

"Yes that is correct T mobile is not an American company it was founded by the EU and VZ has been taken over at the top by Han's from the EU all to create the EU one world order, T is the last American company that is why they were given the First responders so they could count on an American company. All the T haters are from the EU and their one world order trying to destroy T. or they are from countries that hate Americans . TMUS or T mobile was founded by the EU and their one world order FACT. You should only be doing business with the only American company we have left."

Great inflation hedge and equity bond. T and CVS are both undervalued and will outperform in 2021 I believe. (and this from someone who has been overweight tech for 10+ yrs!). Sadly believe that the big tech names will drift sideways from here until the business catches up with their valuations (or there is a reset).....

"Unless you plan to sell stop worrying about the share price. I look at T as high yield, safe bond. I am neutral on the price, no idea where it goes but feel the dividend is secure and that is allthat matters to me. Of course at 74 my views are different than some of you youngster looking to make fat cap gains. Good luck to us all."

A year ago AT&T put its share buy back plans on hold because of all the unknowns around the growing virus.The Market punished the company for making responsible choices which protected the shareholders dividend payouts.Now that it is known that the decision was sound will the market allow the stock price to return to the more reasonable levels for a well managed company with a 7% dividend?.

All in all- the company is diversifying, and are a leader in the 5G field- the this administration has held a high priority on rolling out. While seeing the stock's recent performance- and it is not what any of us would like for our portfolios- looking at where they should be long term- and comparing them to their competitors- I remain hopeful that this diversification will reward us all for our patience- while we collect our steady dividends.This is not GE- like some would wish for us to believe. ."

T is building a nice base to blast off. If they low balled there estimates shorts are going to get squeezed big time
"Yup, we're closed Monday which is Martin Luther Day. The next day closed will be February 15 for Washington's Birthday."
For the last 12 months we’re told this stock will plummet and the 7% dividend is unstable. The market has a sell off due to bond yield concerns and the stock rises. Lol. Seems like the divy is plenty safe for those seeking safety.
"Dear Anonymous S.L.: Mr Clean said T could reach $70 by Tuesday. Are you going to engage him/her and try to decipher what they may know that you could then apply to your investing strategy? After all, that's what this board is for, right? You said so."
Back to $29.00
"So, I've been reading lots of posts on Reddit and Stocktwits about Robinhood users about to buy $T stock using margin @ 5% interest to capitalize on the 6.7% yield $T offers. (So basically netting 1.7% interest on FREE money). I did my homework and honestly it seems like a solid plan with the $T dividend being safe, a product that works in any economy, paying off debt faster than anticipated (Thanks Fed... 0% interest) and the #$%$ CEO retiring at the end of June. There doesn't seem to be a lot of risk...all I can think of is NOT maxing out your margin limit in the rare event the market droosnso much that Robinhood exercises their right to sell your stocks to recoup their money (leaving you with a loss). Anyone else doing this? What's preventing everyone from doing it?"
"What in the world??!?! I mean, s&p is virtually flat, T is down almost 2%. Yield is up to 7.1%. So is this a reaction to int rates moving up? Because if it is, where was the upward movement in the stock when int rates plunged to zero over the last effin ten years. It's like there is an 800 lb. fatso sitting on this stock."
"This post is worth millions of dollars to this $T board if you believe me. If not that is ok . Read on. Institutions are gaming this stock. I encourage you to average down and buy more $T ... I have some very good information on why $T can not go below $25.83 for the near future. Buying will occur gradually and shoots this back up to over $30. if you notice on recent charts the bounces from this zone $26 . $T is forced to buy its own shares around this point as well as MM players. I discovered this analyzing a much bigger investors records (close family member), that got preferred shares at $25 with a 5% div. if the stock price settles under $25.83 with massive dividend well over 5% then there is a big problem for issuers of $T in the corporate debt market. Att won’t cut dividend or reduce credit worthiness. It’s better to buy up shares and for MM to manipulate upward pressure. At some point they will go in massively up to high 29.xx then all of a sudden it will explode over $32. This will most likely occur end of year into 2022.I had done some similar analysis on XOM and made mint. Don’t be afraid long term att isn’t going anywhere and just a few sparks and MM moves will make it pop... ofcourse after they get a bunch of cheap shares and make some option calls..."
AT&T announces multi-year alliance with IBM on CNBC minutes ago.
"I always liked T. I bought it again at 28+ prior to the Ex date.It's no Tesla but it's a return, etc.. You can actually buy and sell this once or twice a year and do ok. - Pete"
there ya go OPEX bringing PPS back down to $30 level. THe mm's/banks and funds aren't going to let this close much higher.
TMobile is down over $8.00 bucks. No idea what is going on with that stock. Might have something to do with AT&T winning the postpaid subscriber war.
"Gee, $29 even on options expiration. Pure stock manipulation."
Anyone not get the dividend yet? I have had my shares long before the x dividend date
This was at $39 bucks it will easily get there anytime on any positive news
"China is allowing WHO investigators a year later after scrubbing and cleaning up everything. Everyone has their stories fixed.Of course the virus did not emanate from the wu-han lab carrying out covid research next door, it came from a bat cave 1000's of miles away.NICE TALE."
"want to start picking up Silver or Gold on dips , Joe the DEM wit without a brain makes even Jimmy Carter look like a smart man. We are going to have massive inflation coming that the DEM wits can not control. With the DEBT as big as it is. Get ready for anything that you would drop on you foot and it hurts to go way up in price."
"CNN... why are you and CBS and other “news” outlets not reporting the fact that a Cuomo aide admitting they purposely hid nursing home death data in order to avoid a federal investigation??? You aren’t a news organization, you are a unscrupulous lying stooge of the Democratic Party withholding the truth from the US public..."
"If CNN goes, this is a $40.00 stock."
It's amazing how fast sellers turn into buyers.
"Other than the CEO, all 12 of the ""BORED"" members have no knowledge of the telecommunications business.Why was Randall given a blank check?"
"I'm sure the current T baggers know how to trade this stock, especially this time of year........buy today and reap a 2%+/- return in a week......it's a no-brainer......T pps has been in the $25-$45 range for the last 25 years........it has a great dividend........trade it!"
Omg why AT&T EPS is negative for 2020? 
"Whats funny about the Dems stimulus bill, is that they are reducing child poverty now and increasing the burden for children when they grow up. Millenials and Gen z will have to pay for this."
4% pop..
"Just bought 400 shares of T at 32.92. Plan to hold for 10 year minimum. True book value of this company is $47 a share, and one day, they will get back on a steady increase. These prices are a gift. Until then, great stock to reinvest dividends."
Headed back to the $40s near term. :-)
The smart move would be to take the 7.5 billion and buy shares of T because you would save over 7% on the dividend pay out. If you pay off debt it's at 1/2 the interest rate and the lower shares will pay you back with higher earnings that can be used to pay off debt. Catch 22
"Memo to ATT: You have shareholders here, not political activists.You have a thing called fiduciary duty and responsibility to make decisions to increase shareholder value.You are neglecting your role as managers and executives. Your political preferences have no place in a publicly held corporation."
One of the most stable stocks from last week.
HBO Max is #1Top Free Apps in Ranking
"more bad news for T: ""Disney’s global subscriber number stands at 87 million, while HBO Max — available only in the U.S. — has 12.6 million accounts activated, as per Bloomberg."""
"$T warner bros and HBO MAX are now extending their harry potter and game of thrones universe and rumored to be doing a TV show from the Godzilla world, hbo max is late but is now starting to show who rules the world"
Added 2k shares at the close.
"Lol Cramer just said no too T. Says too much risk, and we never reach just for yield. What a Clown "

Chris MUTED!Outrageous pumping.No credibility.
"If approved, what will the spin off of Direct TV plus other things, with TPG mean to us as stock holders.? Would we get any stock in the new company"
"David , Look's Like You Are Right Again , Look's Like Stimulus Check's Will Be Out Soon , And The Stock's That Will Be Bought Up Quickly Are , G E , FORD , And Game Stop , And AT&T , And AMC , Stock Market Will Move Up Very Quickly , For The Next Couple Month's , GLTA ,"
"Why the hate? There is an activist investor there now. Someone who knows how to capitalize on assets , which T has all over the place. Took on a little today, if it falls to 26 will add a little."
The DEMS are making it so its preferable to be POOR than middle class. Good going Nancy.

"T doesn't participate in a bull rally and during a bear market does worse, what a great investment."
"Everyday Strong Sell List, #1 T, #2 T, #3 T."
"Why T steady for years but AT&T cannot recover from COVID? Thought it had more media, entertainment covered aside from TV channels."
Closed at $32. and Dividend payment tomorrow! Life is good!
T is getting good volume. Finally should be going up soon.
"Need some suggestions on an investment that pays a dividend of 4% or more. I'm retired, 70 y.o. & already own several like t (largest holding), pfe, vz, vlo, xom, abbv, gild, gis, wmb, nee, stag, stor.. I'm well diversified, just need one more long term, relatively high return investment."
Wall Street is forward looking. The guidance was disappointing. Last quarter is ancient history. Looks like another long 3 months of little or no share price growth.
"I just changed my mobile service from Verizon to Spectrum. They both have unlimited talk and text but I was overpaying Verizon for Data storage that I did not need. I was paying Verizon $120 per month and I'll be paying $14 per month at Spectrum. It was my fault for overpaying Verizon because I didn't need all that capacity but I'm changing anyway because the lowest monthly fee at Verizon is $45 per Mo. and the lowest fee at Spectrum is $14. I'll be paying $14 per month for unlimited talk and text. You can receive, send or store all the Data you want for free with either service if you're using WIFI but you have to pay when you're not."
$31. Holds! That's a good sign!
"Yield curve inversion -- yada yada yada. Over-hyped issue, chill. This inversion started back in March, why all the attention now when the alleged recession doesn't occur for some 18 to 24 months after the event? Govt. stats say no inflation in sight as far as anyone can see, NEC director Larry Kudlow points this out in virtually every interview he's done over the past year. Experts like to quote the history of these inversions ""over the past 50 years"" and how they foreshadowed significant recessions. One problem: this only happened on just SIX occasions over the past 50 years -- ALL OF WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE 1989. To me, this raises about the statistical accuracy when all your data points are skewed towards one end of the chart.Why has this been happening since 1989, why not during the recessions of the 60's & 70's? I can answer that in two words: ALAN GREENSPAN. He chaired the Federal Reserve from 1987 through 2006. He was followed by Ben Bernanke 2006 - 20014 (Remember ""helicopter"" Ben?). Both were notorious for manipulating interest rates and so-called ""quantitative easy"" [i.e., throwing money at banks]. The primary culprit of these inversions has ALWAYS been the Federal Reserve.These inversions happen here in the U.S. largely because of the Fed's incessant need to tinker with interest rates."
"Just because I am doing well with the AT&T, Doesn't mean that I don't care about other people and their hard Earned Money that they invest in this company, I do agree that there is really something wrong with the people that are running this company that is for sure."
SEC fine would be $300Billon i think i heard somebody say ... that would basically Bankrupt $T
T is a utility says the stock price. Mgmt has yet to transform it.
Looking at making my first investment into T.
AT&T get rid of those executives and all the dead wood management layers. Some more vision and drop the boomers in your organisation. Then maybe this stock will give some decent return.
How many ATT shorts are TROLLing this board? Like for confirmation.
The times are changing years ago if Morgan Stanley recommended a stock it would be up points it seems somebody knew information was coming Friday somebody always knows when news is coming. This is great news for telephone holders there are sellers Who Rather invest in faster growing companies which is wonderful news because today’s buyers will be holders for a while and new institutional buyers will be holders for years to come putting less pressure on the stock in the future those who wait will be rewarded

"If Microsoft and Apple can trade in the trillion dollar market cap area, AT&T’s dividend yield can be 3% or lower ($75+ a share) and investors will still buy the stock for the yield."

Leftist Phil very busy pumping his money pit investment $T.
"For the last 20 years hopeful investors have been posting every reason in the world why T was going to move to $40 but it hasn't happened. T was a $30 twenty years ago and except for a few occasions like last year when the Elliot group bought a chunk of shares, T has been and still is a $30 stock. Why do you suppose that is? All the talk about if T had so and so's multiple or if T was Disney or Netflix, yada yada, T would be this or that, but it's NOT. T is T and the fact is that the market doesn't see T as a growth stock like it does the other companies on the list. T is a dividend stock and that's it. My guess is that it's going to be a $30 stock for as long as T stays in business. It may have a few gyrations here and there taking it up to the mid to high thirties but it will always come back down and settle around $30 because it's not a growth stock. Just my opinion."
It's got to be CNN weighing this down! Lol!
Ive never heard so many lies coming from ceo - wow where do they get these guys
Upgrade coming next week!
Sold my t options at a nice profit today at open switched it to pltr calls
"This board is hilarious. When T has a good day the cheerleaders pour out of the woodwork and we hear calls of $37, $39 and $49 again. But when T has a bad day, the weenies show up and start crying, $25, $20 and $15. It's so predictable and happens every time. The same thing happened the last 3 times T was at this price............on 2/17, 1/26 and 1/7. The only thing I haven't seen today (I probably missed it) is ""Somebody knows something"". LOL LOL I love this board!!"
7 shares got paid $3.12 not bad.
Dividend going to 10%
Price gapped down Thursday night with the market. Opened lower with little conviction in selling. Afternoon buying picked up and moved the price higher. Low volume during the morning hours with a cheaper price is a good sign. Potential catalysts for share appreciation coming our way!
Anyone concerned about its relationship with China?
"Zest vs Walmart google it and see all 9 counts stand firm including fraud charges Ex Walmart CEO did court deposition and admitted wrong doing, court subpoenaed his email and text messages regarding Zest dealings.

"@Spartan55 The change is taking place and you can see it in the stocks actions , VZ will be going lower and T will be going higher , The price action is telling you the switch is taking place T to the $50's and VZ to the $20's , Told you it was coming you can sell VZ once it's down 50% when Cramer tells you to. and buy T once it's up 50% when Cramer tells you to, because it's all up to you it's your hard earned money , But for sure Get ready to say OH NO up T goes and OH NO down VZ goes ."
"If HBO Max attracts new subscriptions in the 10s of millions, through their marketing strategy of direct to consumer movies for free, T can easily see its stock price rise. Look at the evaluation of all these streaming companies. Disney with 45 percent of their business making nothing is at all times highs just because of Disney + which isn't profitable. T is making money and pays a monster dividend that can with stand a global pandemic. The upside is the streaming business. Their content is excellent especially for Adults. Their library is extensive and it's a matter of marketing and time before this goes higher. In this market it's not far fetched this can't go much higher"
At what point do they let this run?
"Homegamers !The Land of $30 ! Love 'T'.Waiting To Feast On The Big X DIVVY Tomorrow.......Long 8,900 @28.78"

I added 500 shares today as I continue to build my position. I'm very confident that the dividend will be increased to $2.12 and will be declared in mid December.
"I find it interesting that so many reputable analysts got T wrong. The Wall St Journal put a price target of $33.62 in June of 2020 and The Bank of America also had a buy rating with a $36.00 price target Aug. of 2020. Two years earlier when Warren Buffett was touting T (one of his crony friends joined the board) he said the stock would go to 60. This whole stock market is a guessing game and no one really knows what the future holds. If Wed. has decent earnings or even meets the target instead of beating there is hope of an increase in PPS. If it misses, this will take years."
"09:42 AM EDT, 06/26/2019 (MT Newswires) -- AT&T (T) was maintained with a buy rating and $43 price target at Nomura/Instinet as the firm believes ""the FirstNet/5GE deployment is currently lifting net adds from the first responder community.""Additionally, Nomura writes that the ""worst has likely passed for entertainment EBITDA, and FCF/asset sales should improve leverage in 2019.""AT&T has an average analyst rating of buy and $36 price target.Price: 32.68, Change: +0.13, Percent Change: +0.41"

Guys the last 2 days have been great for us longs the stock has not dipped into the red

Next week T should go up to $30 for Divvy. Ex-div day Jan 8th.
"When was the last time we seen AT&T up $1.13 ? This is hard to believe, But hope for the best for the stock."
"Investors Business Daily did a hit job on T yesterday. Excerpt-“AT&T stock should not be bought right now based on its fundamentals and technical analysis. Investors want to prioritize stocks that have seen growth of at least 25% in earnings and sales in recent quarters. T stock currently falls far below that.Despite its nearly 7% dividend yield, AT&T stock has dropped well over 20% in 2020 as the company's increasing debt has deterred many investors. Shares have a long way to go before reaching the nearest buy point.”"
"People. ATT (and Verizon BTW) desperately need spectrum for the 5g rollout. T has the least flexibility of all bidders. Saddled with debt incurred in two disastrous acquisitions, it lacks the financial flexibility to compete at the auctions. but lack of spectrum is an existential threat to T. The prices for bandwidth in the current auction are already astronomical. Where can T get the money? They are already over leveraged and the media delivery/content assets they purchased are worth about 25 cents on the dollar. They are coming for your dividend. You heard it here first. Don't hate the messenger. My family and I have about 80k of T stock in our holdings. But you really have to ask yourself why would they pay 7% in a 2 percent world? No spectrum-no ATT. What will T trade at if the cut the dividend in half or worse yet suspend it? 15 bucks if they halve it. 10 if they suspend it."
i am 62 and t is my retirement lifeboat.
So the minor stake puts the value of DTV at $15b. The sale is not for $15b. I see many people not understanding this. It’s like shark tank. I offer 1.5b for 10% then the company is worth 15b according to my offer.
DIV EX date coming soon buy now to be sure
"if it doesnt go up dont worry we got a dividend. wth is wrong with T investors. The total return is negative, its not a bond, its a bum stock."
Pure 
the ONLY thing T is good for is the divvy....the ONLY THING
"lol, they waited 6 years for the lawsuit, and did it the night before an ER. The powers that be love to hold this stock down, because they want cheap shares.T as always is bullish in a neutral sense."
JUST CURIOUS. What price does everyone need to be in the green?
"Look at that all that work by the T haters today and they are losing money as T is up and green , LOL,LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up LOL,LOL,LOL"
Volumes are increasing.I'm looking to add if price is around 28.50; target selling price is 37.00 USD.If price goes below 27.00 somehow I'm adding a larger position.

We live in times where having 0 news about a stock (GME) is better than having good news about a stock (T).

63 more cents from now and T will be where it was last week. That's about 115% of qrtrly divy.

$T giveth and taketh away.......
How does someone like Randal Stephenson get to be CEO for so long? Here’s his track record after taking over in 2007. 1. Failed to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. Paid a break up penalty of $5 billion which revived the fortunes of T-Mobile and resulted in its taking over ATT in subscribers2. Bought Direct TV for $49 billion at a time in 2014 when the transition to OTT networks had just started and has been losing customers every quarter since then. 3. Bought Time Warner and has all of 25 million subscribers compared to Disney + of 100 million subscribers. Not in the same league as Netflix. 4. Sold Hulu to raise money I hope John Starkey is better.
"According to some on this board, T is a defensive stock. LMAO"

Anyone getting nervous out there? What will the market do if the Democrats win both seats? How about if the Republicans win both seats? What if the seats are split? All kinds of possibilities.
What should I do? I sold 1500 shares of T at 29.20 and put it in SPY @ 338. Should I take the gain (short term tax gain) and go back to T? I am worried about how low T might go should the market correct a couple thousand points.
So is T going to keep the aristocrat status?I think the dividend is the single most important factor in this stock.
Dive dive dive
"Stay nimble and open to new ideas folks. This is an amazing market, but dangnabit you gotta be fast "

"Att wants to keep customers in high prices plan????? Their Att now ak Directv now is going to rise prices another 10.00 this will drive a wedge between the customs and they will bail, I know I did. As far a high prices cell phone plans TMUS will scoop them up in no time. TMUS offers the best military and first responders discounts than all the carriers plus free Netflix and free stuff every week (no taxes they are included). As far as getting fiber internet good luck with that #$%$ a lot of folks are more interested in when Starlink will be come available this should create a lot of competition, I read some were that he is even looking at adding Sat phone to the Starlink network and take on the cell industries."

Afternoon T ~ dish is moving higher folks much higher
still waiting for Joe to talk about showerheads.
Direct TV is Randall Stephenson's responsibility.It's a ball and chain tied around every stockholder's neck.Why is he still around?
You hold T for dividend and will tolerate some degree of market loss. Can't beat a 7+% yield in today's environment.
I?ve learned a company?s with a history of vocal management in support of investors and price appreciation is just as valuable as its balance sheet. Markets are momentum and sentiment based. $t (lower case is intentional) doesn?t give a rats #$%$ about the stock price. I won?t ever make a blue chip a big position in my portfolio ever again If it?s board behaves anything like att and is generally viewed in pop culture as uncool or stagnant
"HBOMax not giving share price much of a bump since many of the subscribers are getting on for free. ATT using a page from Phillip Morris, get em hooked and they'll come back for life. Looking forward to the worldwide launch to see if that will get share price moving."
When does T usually raise dividend. I’m expecting another 1cent raise.
Question is how much the leak will cost them with the SEC now
"it has been all gloom and doom for a good reason and for a long time. Now they take the write-off, T has no place to go but UP.still a cash cow!"
"T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX are taking customers away from bot T Mobile and VZ in droves LOL,LOL T will be going a lot higher , Just pick up shares on the dips before the shorts can cover and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start I am sure we will have to raise the price at some point or any higher price you want for your shares. Then sit back and collect the dividends as T's stock goes higher and higher LOL,LOL Man T's future has not been this bright for decades. T's to the moon Alice"
Here we go again. Another down day for T.Management changes needed now.
HBOSomeone will come up with an idea for live streaming.It will be a home run with minimum expense.I remember when there was a show that just showed a family's activity live and was very popular for a while. Imagine nobody hasn't done it during this pandemic?Mark my words!
I understand why a stock goes down when that stock is ex-dividend. But why is a dividend so meaningful if the stock goes down that exact amount the same day? Maybe T would be trading at 200 if it did not have to pay a dividend for the past 10 years. Is there anyone who can explain this to me. Maybe it’s a tax thing? Thanks.
$26 and change after earnings.

Morning T ~ my bride & yours truly has the COVID. We’re just going to rest and relax. Hope all is good
I've been a long time T shareholder and accumulator who has never seen the level and frequency of guidance they've been offering since Elliot came into the picture.I have to feel that these guys are serious about getting the price up to $60/share.
Any idea what is driving this higher? Treasury yields? Glad I added more last week
Looking backward at these price swings it appears that there is some big accumulation going on.Everytime it starts to bounce off 30 they bring it back down so it can not break out and get away from them.Two months from now we will see who has been building these large positions
Was watching the NBA on TNT (owned by AT&T) last night and there were impressive ads on there (free to AT&T) for HBO Max. So much exciting content and films on the way. Made me glad to be a shareholder.
Another time Warner Debt laden acquisition.....Just because a CEO wears a suit does not mean he is smart. T management never learn that acquiring debt is NOT a good thing.
"All that work the T haters did today and now they are losing money after hours LOL,LOL,LOL You just can not make this stuff up LOL,LOL,LOL"

Cost $1.04 for .52 cent dividend every time - what a stock lol.

Funny how Netflix stock price is moving much higher after missing earnings by a wide margin.
bought more at 28.64 earlier and glad i did
Honestly I never would have dreamed this would be down in an up market with ex-div tomorrow. Especially the way it's been running the last few days. Maybe they will come to their senses later today.
Run T Run
Guys are acting like we didn’t know they would need to take more debt to get what they need.
30 tomorrow. 40 next week.
"If I told you in the future there will be billions of eyes all watching HBO MAX , I am sure the DEM wits without a brain would be laughing their dASSES off. DEM wits without a brain 1 do not know how to make money and 2 can't see the future until it hits them in the face. because they are always looking at the past. Watch and learn DEM wits without a Brain. T will be giving away an ad version of HBO MAX in the future and selling ads and makings trillions from around the world As they take eyeballs away from everyone LOL billions of eyeballs all watching HBO MAX for FREE and T making trillions on ads LOL,LOL,LOL Won't happen over night but boy it the future so bright for T's new monster you are going to need shades. Took the smartest people in the room to build a REAL MONSTER and keep paying the dividend shareholders depend on as they completely transform T into the MONSTER it can be. FACT"
"ok, come on now, there's news behind this. but what is it!??!"
Maybe granny was right when this hole tech bubbly burst I should own T and gold
"Do Dem wits realize that raising the min wage to $15, results in all wages up the pay scale being increased.If some guy is getting $15 for supervising a bunch of $9 an hour workers, is he going to continue accepting the same wage as his subordinates, or is he going to expect a $6 dollar an hour raise also.

"Spartan55 you just need to learn you are a DEM wit without a brain and about to lose all your money in VZ as VZ keeps going lower and lower Why ? easy VZ just keeps losing more and more customers to T everyday. VZ has no future and can not compete in the new 5G world they now face FACT LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
VZ not moving either. Just been a bad week for telecoms. Thought Netflix mentioning T and DIS as their main competition would have sent this higher today.
"If Stankey can find someone dumb enough to buy it....

HBO sub projections..If all goes well.... when the heck does that ever happen? For ATT?
AT&T will go NOWHERE now that Stankey flat said that there will be no Dividend growth. That's why most people hold T.
Does t own hbo. If so it's their most valuable asset by far
"If this is true, it's going to take a long long time, if ever, for HBO Max to move the needle in a meaningful way._____LightShed Partners did a study that 83% of streaming viewership is tied up in five services — Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Hulu and Disney Plus — and everybody else has to fight for the remainder."

"Nice article from Raymond James with a buy rating on T and a price target of 32. Same target as others but I have a friend who owns a well known drug stock that is down 20 bucks a share. She does not care because she gets $8.000 a year in dividends. She has owned it for years and it split once so she is still about even on her principal. No worries, this stock will eventually gain back some as well at T if they hold that dividend of 7%.. F crashed because they took the dividend away and most retired owners of the stock want some kind of income that is over 1%."
lets go to 30 today!
Look at that 5 year chart LOL Man this is the worse investment in a record bull market. Hopefully for the sake of the company they cut the div to nothing and get this garbage back on track. So sorry to all the longs who have missed out on the best market they will ever see :(

My now is the moment that T is gonna pas 30. I mean this YEAR HAHAHAHHA
Let's all post a political message and drive Vagipuss nuts. LOL LOLFunny why he never takes Phil to task. Phil posts more political messages than anyone else on this board.
"@TEX, @John. Brick, NJ, @R the trading at or near the end of the day is very interesting (options-wise). It seems to be repeatable  what do you guys think?"
"You whiners always complain about AT&T never going up, never growing. TMobile and Verizon are basically trading right around the same price they were at the end of July 2020. That's about 7 months. TMobile doesn't pay a dividend and Verizon's is less than AT&T by about 3%."

"Now that I think of it, CNN ""IS"" a reflection of management's culture. The rest of us have to live with it."

"After a stock goes X dividend, the price of the stock will decline by the amount of the dividend. That's almost a given. What happens after that is a reflection of market conditions at that time. In the case of T, price usually goes further down, to the $28 level or so, before leveling off. Eventually, it will make a run to about 30-dollar area again before retreating once more. T is considered dead money to many investors, but that’s because they don’t know how to trade the stock. If you are here to make a quick buck, then sticking around for the dividend was the wrong more. The right move would have been to buy into T several weeks before the X dividend date, take advantage of the ride up, and sold before that date. If you bought in for the dividend, then wait for the price to go back up to your entry point before selling. You might have to wait a bit and watch your investment decline to uncomfortable levels, but T’s price will eventually go back up as long as you got in under $30. Depending on market conditions, wait a week or two and you should be able to recover your investment along with the dividend. It’s not a guarantee, but so far it has worked for me. Also, T is in a long-term decline. Unless things turn around, try to get into T below $30 for the next dividend payment."
Is dividene $2 per share? That seems to high or is it $2 per quarter???? Pays four dividends?
Up by a penny.
"There is the T we all know and love, always red."
"If I am being honest, I must say, everyone saying they are adding a few thousand shares or currently hold 10 thousand shares or more is not impressing anyone. Maybe you are telling the truth. However, if you have that much money considering 1000 shares would cost $32,000 and taking into account that you would hopefully have other holdings, I seriously doubt people that can afford that would waste their time on a yahoo finance message board. I am young, and have everything I have saved up for the past 6 years invested in the market. AT&T is 31% of my portfolio at 465 shares. I make decent money and have bills like everyone else. It's funny to see people saying they are adding a few k shares here like its nothing. Maybe its not, 90% of people with that kind of money would not waste their time here. Those people know exactly what they are doing and don't need to brag or convince people on a message board to buy. Be real people. Some of you may be legit, but I'm calling the rest out. Besides people bragging about having a lot of money and buying a few k shares like its nothing, I do agree with their reason as to why. Their is a lot of upside here, not just in share price but dividend increase as well. T is a cash cow and they could clear and debt off their books within three years if they wanted too. I'm in It for the long hall."
At&t has a 25% lose in stock price and a 7 % div. That is Good? U smart people tell me what u think.

No one read WSJ? T sold Government solutions unit for an undisclosed price.
Looks like they almost doubled there HBO max subscriptions.
"Why did Warren Buffett invest in Verizon and not in AT&T?From a value point T provides much more value than VZ, e.g., Forward P/E is 8.68 vs. 10.69, Price/Sales is 1.17 vs. 1.79, Revenue is 171.76B vs. 128.29B, Free Cash Flow is 36.36B vs. 16.063B. Both of them have high debt, 182.98B vs. 151.24B. However, I believe T's debt is more manageable due to its higher FCF.The only reason I can find that Buffett still prefers VZ is he believes their management is superior to AT&T.You are welcome to share your thoughts."
"How are you at&t share holders liking higher gas prices. Higer taxs, power bill, food prices around the corner. 7 % div may keep off food stamps."
Anyone watch the series Titans on Max yet? Just finish. Not what I expected but turned out to be pretty good show.
"To Yhoo, if you are even remotely objective, you need to put back up my post on the $15 an hour minimum wage."
Why the T is so cheap? Because of the high debt level? Is dividend really more than 7%. That's really a good deal.
Just added to my position. Buying Opportunity!

"T's 5G monster is ALIVE and starting grow LOL,LOL,LOL Say up we go"
This stock hates $30 never seen such a resistance lol
Tranny Phil’s T investments.
AT&T is lagging because of the uncertainty surrounding additional debt needed to be taken on for 5G.Gonna be awhile before any meaningful valuation increase. Wait a bit for the pending sell-off as T announces the additional debt it is taking on. Buy more when the dust settles.
When T suspends the dividend and the boomers sell the millennials will buy the dip for the HBO hyper growth. Netflix is nothing more than a hosting company and the only real players with premium content are DIS and HBO. Thank you!!

I went to college and I went to law school. I'm not a financial advisor just a small investor etc..But why would financial experts buy Direct TV at such a high price ? Aren't they supposed to know all aspects/pitfalls ? Is it true they'll take a huge loss ?
"Remember to place long term sell orders for all your shares of T over $60 is a good place to start but any higher price you want will work , It sends a message to the short sellers they are not going to get your shares to cover with and if by chance any of your shares have been shorted you broker will need to find other or have them recalled . Just place them long term sell orders and set back and collect the dividend , The more shares that have long term sell orders the higher T will go"
you won't go wrong buy T at this price. buy today sell.in a week at 30.
"Good year ahead!!! Or ???The best risk adjusted trade IOM...if you are a dividend income investor and and an option trader is,...sell the Jan 2022 $28 put for $3. That equals a 10%+ yield, “IF” T stays above $28 Jan 2022. I know, if you don’t trade or trust opinion trading you won’t get it. Just buy the stock and BE HAPPY. It’s all good.I’ve Been doing this for 30 years  and I’m getting way more cautious now. This is a cautious conservative trade."
Can we just hold a stock right here so it closes at a higher the day because everybody knows what happens it opens up and runs up a quarter than it closes down a penny or two.
Do you think T will break 29$ again?
"@R’s strategy makes use of out-of-the money call options on a stock to force market makers (who make a market in that stock) to buy large amounts of to hedge their exposure. @R’s strategy just adds to the buying pressure. Now you have sell orders that can’t be used because the price is too high (unless the price happens to go that high ). On the other hand, if there are “weak hands” out there, that lessens the buying pressure - short term holders normally use sell stops to protect their small profits. Once a sell stop order is tripped, it turns into a market order and you know the rest - timber!!"
Tomorrow we go UP UP UP folks! Stay in T and hold your shares

Lou Dobbs fired from fox for not telling the truth isn’t that a surprise . You don’t like CNN but they are moneymaker for telephone and it’s at the light to hear the truth more heads will follow as we clean house and try to forget about the past. Telephone move up and then Motley fool came out with a lousy article about them how they will destroy shareholder value even with their high dividend I am hoping they are wrong.￼￼￼￼
Probably end up in the +40 cent range. Always takes a dive at the wire.
"Hello T investors, I can't help but be constantly amused by like dislike views of motley and Seeking alpha gurus.. The bottom line for me is I'll collect my 7+ dividend and sleep well at night. I do believe that current management will reduce debt and push 5g and the media portion of T, which will cause the stock price way above the nay sayer analyst predictions. What say you ?"

"Amen, Jeremy!"
I hate it when earnings are reported before the open. If VZ fell 3% on mediocre earnings I hate to see the possibility of T just meeting or lower revenue.

its undervalued
"Come on man. You will pay higher taxes, gas, electric bills, food bill but u will get your grass cut cheap, cheap, cheap. Thanks to me and CNN. If at&t can keep paying div with no profits, frogs can hop without bumping rear end."
T is a nice stock to remind you that non performing stocks exist. Rubbish management.

At least with AT&T you can be pretty certain each day will be a down one. Not much guessing here.

"The future of streaming is going to be free with ads and in-app purchasing of new content. AT&T would be smart to be the first to go that route. HBO subs numbers would instantly soar. Advertising revenue and purchases for viewing new content would surpass they’re already to high $15/mo. Also no cancellations of HBO. If it’s free it will always be on their device. Time to be an industry leader, ahead of trend, rather than behind. All other streamers would quickly scramble to match. It’s coming anyway. T does have unique opportunities no other data provider will have. ADVERTISING REVENUE."
"You people and analysts seem to forget why AT&T tried to diversify in the first place. The wireless market is saturated. Meaning there isn't any new customers it's just 3 companies competing to lure customers from each other. A zero sum game. That's when they bought DirecTV and TimeWarner. You want to go back to that? I don't. And you also seem to forget that we're in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. There is no telecom I would rather own than AT&T. And we're already seeing the affects of owning Time Warner with postpaid subscriber results that AT&T hasn't seen for decades. HBO Max is the bait. And take a guess where those subscriptions are coming from? That's right, VZ and TMobile."
Value stocks in play today.
Anyone have any info on the exclusive talks with TPG mentioned on January 24th? It’s been almost a month no word from either side.
Why do I feel T won’t hold above 30 by closing bell. It would be nice to stay in the thirty’s even the low thirty’s now.

"You that like to trade for pennies you just might want to learn a little about long term capital gains , does not matter if you trade in a 401k or IRA you pay no taxes until you take it out , but with the DEM wits going to raise taxes you are going to want to know all you can about long term capital gains. The difference can be paying no taxes on $80,000 or paying 37% or more on $80,000 , you will need to plan ahead to take advantage of long term capital gains or not all up to you . The major key is you must hold the stock for one year before the gain becomes long term capital gains ."

"Just a little comforting words- to all T ""investors""- not traders.....from a ""little known investor- Sir Warren Buffet"":""Instead of frequently checking a stock's price, you'd look to the earnings and dividends over the years as determining whether you made a good investment or not. And that's what people should do with stocks.""Probably some of the best advice out there. Their earnings and dividend increases have gone up consistently. As long as the company is sound, and making money, quarter over quarter- let the market do what it does- this should be back in the 40's after the DOJ goes down with a knockout- and T's aggressive acquisitions into expanding their business- and not sitting back- relying on phone service, like other carriers, should propel this much higher - while we collect a solid dividend that is 2X current treasury rates. I will admit- I watch the stock too closely- and it does drive me crazy when it is not participating in recent market runs- butI often have to remind myself that traders trade on any bit of news......and in this case- it's not because the company is losing money.....on the contrary. Brace for a rough open- let it wash out- and remember the company is doing just fine."
I have to ask?Just how many layers of management does this company actually have?And this a communication company?

As much as I love HBO MAX that can’t be the reason I hold this company. Way over leveraged & I’m expecting it to continue trading flat. Trimming my position to add NFLX. Never too late to buy an industry leader with a first mover advantage.

"“It's worth noting the spinoff will include the entirety of AT&T's U.S. pay-TV portfolio: DIRECTV, U-Verse, and AT&T TV.”The free cash flow generated by these entities I believe is significant and will now be captured within the new company formed to receive the “spinoff” of these businesses. Therefore the current dividend of T will be a much larger percentage of its remaining free cash flow.

Now instead any gain is easily sold without fear of any kind of potential stock buyback, or any significant buy interest due to that enormous debt hanging over our heads."
"Why can't the Reddit kids starting buying this stock? LOL Cmon, it's cheap kids, you can get a lot of shares."
0% interest rates forever. I am still waiting for negative rates on my mortgage.
No love for this stock... Dividend is secure yet here we languish below 30.
"Question for you all When the stimulus does not pass are you going to hold strong or are you all selling . The stimulus is not going to pass the first time around , Just the way it works or how soon do people forget"

Going to get a good earnings Report!
AT&T owns CNN. Foreigners own FOX. take ur pick.#USA!
"$25 or lower around Q1 earnings is confirmed, Very Bearish outlook ahead for T=Trash."
"Still time to get into MO. MUCH better stock than T.Dividend KING, 54 dividend raises in 51 years.They are tied down with constant CAP-ex.They are moving smoker, who want to, to heated tobacco that has up to 95% less carcinogens.They pay out 80% of earnings as dividends, intentionally, to keep lawyers away. They are predicting earnings of $ 4.67 this year which would mean a HUGE dividend increase in July.Just broke a 4 year downtrend in the stock price yet still Yields 6.8%.'T investors are crazy not to have already swapped out T for MO."
LeWoke James: I’m oppressed Also LeWoke James: I’m worth $1 billion.
"I feel nausea.The rest of the market is showing red (dark red) and T is green......This isn't right, is it?"
over 1pc lower in PM.Has T suspended stock buyback?
THIS IS A HYPEI DONT BELIEVE T THAT SUBSCRIBERS INCREASE. EVEN MYself cancelled my contract with ATT AND DIRECT TV LAST WEEK.
Where are the buyers of BustTv?
Surprised the stock didn't rise because when the merger went through the stock fell!
"As expected , zero coverage on serial killer Coumo’s crimes."
It will be refreshing not having 45 around. The fraud is gone and T can now prove itself.
All 5 G Companies Are Going To Be Hot Hot Hot This Year! Hold On Baby;)

"The true fact is you now get HBO MAX for FREE with your new unlimited cell plan from T and it is now gaining new customer in droves from VZ and T mobile , Why because you can save even more money by dropping NFLX , T now has the Amazon business model for Telecom T can give things away or discount item to customers to drive new customers to T, Watch what happens next ,as long as you have a Cell plan from T you will get HBO MAX for free and that is now happening today or HBO is free to you and they sell ads on it . Or you pick what you want for free with you cell plan or it's really heavy discounted so no one company in that business can compete with T. T now has massive upside as they are taking customer from VZ , T mobile and NFLX FACT it is now happening more and more everyday Why because customers can save money switching their cell plans to T , networks are just a Commodities business it's all about what else you can get for FREE or heavy discounted and T has the assets to leverage free and heavy discounted LOL,LOL you don't even need to make this stuff up because it is now already happening today as T takes more and more customers from T mobile and VZ both have a massive problem and it's T's new business model call the 5G monster T has built. Really has nothing to do with 5G other than 5G has unlocked the assets T had to leverage the new business model they have been building for years. Took the smartest people in the room to change T's total business model into an Amazon telecom business model , You could see it coming as they built the 5G monster why still paying the dividend WOW that took guts and brains to pull off such a massive change. T has built a business model that no one company can compete in the new 5 G world T has created. FACT"
The air continues to flutter out of the extremely lofty go-go tech stocks. That money is chasing value stocks. AT&T has to be at the top of list for many. IMHO.
No thought police today? Are they at lunch or get laid off?
"Stock ridiculously undervalued on any metric. Fair value today is $35-$40 based on any metric. $60 once the virus lockdown is over, 5G everywhere, etc"
Voted against every Director who voted for the DTV acquisition and compensation
This is quite the stock!
I don't own T because it's DEAD money. I owned a lot a year ago and let it be called away with $30 and $31 options. BAD STOCK IN A BULL MARKET. T will preform better as the market tops out. Dividend is safe as they know nearly every shareholder is in T for the dividend. The have detracted from a great business with terrible acquisitions . Can they unwind some of them and lower debt without too big a hit to equity? If so T is a good way to make 10% in 12 months.
"I've held T since 2002, bought for the div. and the price has been averaging around $25 all this time. Meanwhile Amazon and others has turned penny herders into millionaires whilst I'm sitting here waiting for my 52cents every 3 month. My question is; How could an entire board of directors consisting of other CEO from other companies not know that DTV was a bad expensive deal."
"No reason why Dish should be doing so much better than DTV, productive great profits that just blew past estimates, same businesses with different management is the difference. Great move by T, get DRT off the books, let someone run it effectively to maximize profits in which T will share, win win all the way around"
Tired of this stock being stuck in the mud. It's worth more. Frustrating.
VZ a real #$%$ company run by the EU one world order under HAN's and about to destroy VZ at all cost to the shareholders as the Yahoo Natzi CENSOR real Americans that will always be FREE . LOL you just can not make this stuff up . VZ going to $20's and T going to the $50's Why because T has a future and VZ does not . FACT
Just bought more!
I think it’s a good play to sell dtv. This gives them money and more time to spend on hbo max since that’s where they’ll get more money in the long run. They’ve made their money on dtv now it’s time for new things.
at the end of the day T move up 28.76 with heavy volume.
I am amazed this undervalued company is trading this low. Fair value is $41.00 and that's being conservative. Some Analysts believe it's going to $55.00...This is completely unbelievable and just amazing.
I have had T a long time looking for dip to buy more great dividends
ARK and BlackRock are looking at AT&T if they buy this will rocket
Next plunge we’re going underrrr!
"7.278 billion shares x $2.04 dividend divided by $26 billion free cash flow = 57% payout ratio. Investor presentation says “High 50s %” dividend payout, meaning no dividend cut, 51 cent dividend should be declared next month."
"What do the green numbers mean for the price of ATT? I haven't seen that color for awhile, it's normally red."
"Wow! I made $38 in 6months on a $ 5,000 investment. Must be CNN! Lol!"
"Next quarter they will raise HBO MAX protections again, from 150 to 190 million subscribers."
Close but no cigar.
Safe stock to invest in at least it doesn’t fly around park your money and sit back it can get to $34 plus on any positive news with 5 and 6G it’s been over that easily before
"I believe that John Stankey, will be on CNBC at 9:15 am EST. If anyone cares. I believe."
"AT&T is a great long investment for any portfolio keeping day trading away since the stock doesn't fluctuate much.something tells me that we are heading to a very large financial depression soon taking down huge profits,hope not but the writing is on the wall."
Huge T news. We'll be at $40 in the short-term.
"Added a 1000 shares at the close, couldn’t pass up the DIV, I think I did the right thing."
T's targeted ad business is a huge money maker. Should come into action later this year.
Is T ever going to hit and stay at 30? I should have put everything into XOM. Maybe this downturn is a message to the Libs?
"Not a good day for me in the markets. Hope you all did better than I. Did make some small change with my puts on Nio, but other than that, today was a bust."
Just sold all my shares in T. Ben a holder of this stock for for a while now and no longer trust any corporations that are owned by big financial institutions.
should we be concerned about the amount of people saying they will drop $T cell services and all of that and will spray the word because they restarted their contributions to the GOP
"All it takes id for T to have to warn earnings will be higher because of all the new customer gains everyday as the take them away from VZ, T mobile and NFLX LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Well, saying goodbye to part of yesterday’s gains. Just wasn’t meant to be...heading back to 28’s ?"
"Spartan55 what you should be asking yourself is how come VZ is down a bigger % than T day after day and that is because the connection between the 2 is now breaking because T is not just in the Commodities business like VZ now is , T has a future and VZ is now in get trouble"
"New to trading. How much dividends does this company pay, per share?"
Maybe T could get Jeff Bezos as CEO. That will shake things up.
"What's the story on HBOMAX live sports?Will it be on a new HBOMAX ""PLATINUM"" ?Will the present HBOMAX be called plain ""Vanilla""?"

"There's a right way and a wrong way.My understanding is Telephone is underestimating 72,223, 744 possible customers. Now, why is that?"
"Every 6 months, the Congress should give everyone $1400 stimulus checks to spend. Should cause the economy to boom."
We found out that T now has a very bright future and OH poor VZ does not
No buyer yet for CNN? No surprise. You need to do a lot more house keeping.
"New article criticizes T for not selling DTV and not taking the $15 billion offer. Article believes the longer T waits, the less they will get for the losing DTV. The $15 billion offer was for a 49% ownership, leaving T with a 51% majority ownership."
That runup sure didn't last long!
"Some people can't see a bargain when it's staring them straight in the face. $T is far from being a $GE. $T has over $25B in free cash flow, a shrinking debt and over $175B in shareholder equity paying a 7.5% div. If and when $T hits a P/B of 1.0, I'll be buying 1,000 shares. There is no way $T is going to give up their Dividend Aristocrat status - you can take that to the bank."
"Whelp, name your favorite squeeze play. Mine are RKT and FUBO. GME too nuts for me. Market appears to be rolling over btw. Check out the McClellan and the Cumulative advance decline line"

"What good is T? No total return, flops during market corrections. Don't seem like it does anything good."
Randall's epic blunder will haunt this stock for years.
$30 is that too much to ask?
looks like $T was a pioneer on deciding to put it's 2021 movie slate on hbo max and theaters has hollywood will have to delay more movies
People here commenting how Disney added 21 million and HBO MAX only added 4 million must think the US is the only country and seem to forget Disney is available worldwide and HBO MAX is only available in the US
"The day is not over until after hours trading is done LOL,LOL,LOL Get ready to say OH NO up T goes"
T ~ upgrades or down grades don’t really matter the stock is a mess . Tmus & dish are making progress . T ~ you have an identity crisis need to figure who you really are

Did Spartan55 reinvent himself as Gordon Geico?
Happy Friday T ~ buckle up dish fans earnings Monday & news of spectrum 40 next week . T ~ hang on to 28 - 29 for the long term :)
How many HBO MAX adds? That’s the big question? If substantial T starts to turn around.
What a person wants in your portfolio is a stock that has a safe dividend and steadily rises in price year after year. Not T stock!
"4mvp has just been muted, my apologies that I waited so long."
Thanks for the dividend
I complained one timepeople laughed at meI don't complain anymorelife is good
"From Nomura: The levers are in place for ""significant"" free cash flow growth at AT&T, Kvaal writes. However, he believes the company ""must perform against a skeptical Street to drive shares higher."" The analyst thinks Wireless is on track for sustained service revenue growth in 2019 and keeps a Buy rating on AT&T with a $43 price target"""
I’m a long term divy player so don’t jump down my throat when I say “I hope we stay above 30!at close because I’ve seen this movie before”.
I hope I'm wrong but the sale to comcast is the best deal att can make. if not 2026 bankruptcy
People seem excited. Let’s see if we hold over $30 first.
This is one of the best stick to buy and hold in this market climate!!
Got my dividend yesterday!
33$ by May 1st
"Look at all the T haters all crying as T goes higher and higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
Apparently everyone arrested in the capital insurrection have 2nd grade reading levels and think WWE wrestling is real
Quite the stock we have here folks lol.
"Looking back over T’s weekly chart, if you bought for the dividend, you would have to wait 1-6 weeks for price to return to you buy in point. For a trader, that is an eternity to tie up your money. For an investor, that is a walk in the park. No guarantee this trend will continue, but then again, when have we ever had guarantees? S.L."
"ARK investments says that streaming is replacing linear TV programming, so HBO Max should be beneficial. 50 and 200 day moving average are about to cross, which is extremely bullish."
May close negative on the day...
"It's amazing that despite comment after comment to the contrary, so many people still keep expecting T to behave like a go-go stock. You're in the wrong neighborhood."

Tranny Phil is ready to participate in the girls sports competition. Go get them buddy.
based on today's nytimes article I would not be surprised to see both democrats win in GA. some polling indicating strong early voting by dems.
$50 stock trading at $30.
ring the dinner bell: the TW deal won’t be stopped
Guess WS seems to like that T is allegedly on the cusp of selling a minority stake in DTV for a higher than 15 billion valuation.At least that's the rumor.
"Bingo, another 5 percent dividend check in the mail."
"Like T a lot add 3000 x29.5993, T is good company I think."
Der t Sanchez MUTED!
I agree ATT will go into streaming; this company is the most underrated company in the stock market; it trades with a PE less than 7.
Increasing your profits is that all you care about? destroying of our democracy does not bother you ?
33 coming??anyone think it can hit there in the next few weeks?
Blue horseshoe loves AT&T
"What sane and rational people call holding responsible parties accountable for their actions, conspiracy theorists call a ""cancel culture"". Pure insanity."
I just rolled my T MAR 26 $29 Puts to the APR 30 $29's for .72 each. That's .20 more than the dividend in one month.
"From that Raymond James analyst:“The investment firm is bullish on the Dallas company's next 12 months despite a large C-band bill.""We believe the situation improves for AT&T over the next 12 months, offering a solid total return story,"" Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan said. ""AT&T is expected to generate ""more than enough free cash flow to cover its upcoming C-Band commitments; 2) keep leverage in check; and 3) maintain the dividend at or above the current level."" C-Band is spectrum to be used for 5G applications.The firm also notes that balance sheet concerns are ""overblown"" since AT&T currently has ""~2.7x leverage, roughly a 1/2 turn above its historical average.""”"
Finally T removes the ball and chains. T has only one way forward. Up.
"Example of reinvested dividends. I put large sum of money into T about 3 Years ago. That money now nets me approximately $32,000/year in dividends. That money reinvested will give me more dividend money next year and so on. Eventually it will get to a point where an investor can retire and collect just the dividend checks without touching the stock shares. This may be on a larger scale than most but the same holds true for anyone who does the same. Compounding dividends is a very powerful way to get an edge in the market. Good luck to all!"
"Remember when Trump suggested ""injection"" of disinfectant to beat coronavirus and ""clean"" the lungs?"
"T up a nickel!Wow, watch the fade...Hate to be negative but this company just doesn’t have a clue.As other companies market caps explode this company just sits."
"It is fading, buying T before 1pm is a good way to lose a dividend in an afternoon, lol."
ByeDon! The world is now a better place. Toilet and showerhead exec orders changed it.
ATT'S CNN draws an effeminate audience.
"Down, down, down. Even for a dividend play the company still needs to do well to maintain a competitive edge. When will the dividend players say enough is enough? $25, $21, $14.95?"
A safe stock with a safer dividend than most. Hopefully they buy back some shares with that 7.8 bil. Market is acting crazy for a minute. I do i own a nice piece of T ITM options 9/2021. I feel safe with Mr T
"I think I have had enough of ""good"" news for a year. Elliott back in, selling DTV, purchasing new spectra.... Any more good news will drop T back into the 26s in two weeks."
no wonder this country is in such a mess. only need to read all the political posts.
Strong 5% move on dish today . My bet another 20 % next week good things in the works
"A matter of time before T cuts the dividend. For 2 reasons. 1. Reduce dividends to lower debt. 2. As the price goes lower, dividend rate goes up. At some point T Mgt will feel that the dividend rate is too high and by cutting it, reduces rate to 5% or so and saves money for T."
AT&T is 100x better than the 10 year T bills. Almighty stability with 7% yield. I renounce AT&T the king of the bonds.
"Just pick up shares of T on the dips and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start or any higher price you want for your shares . then just sit back and collect the dividends as T's new monster takes more and more customers from VZ, T Mobile and NFLX by this time next year T will be going higher and higher , It's a new world T has created that only T can play in because no one company has all the assets to compete in the new world T has created. . FACT"
"Non-Stop falling old school Dino going extinct Next. Year 2000 $60, Year 2008 $40, Year 2021 $20s. What's Next is Crystal Clear."
Not that I want it to happen but it's looking like Cheetah may be back owning T shares!
"Remember T is now the one Cell Company that you can Trust to protect your DATA, Both T Mobile and VZ can NOT be TRUSTED to protect your DATA , T Mobile is a Foreign company founded by the EU and VZ does not even protect your First Amendment rights and even breaks them VZ does not have the right to do that no matter what VZ thinks just like VZ can NOT put up a sign that says for WHITE ONLY NO BLACKS , The FACT is VZ is breaking the laws of the USA by CENSORING what you see, read or post."
How can companies pay 15 an hour when there are fewer jobs than ever. how can people afford a burger when they pay their workers 15 dollars an hour. you know how much they are going to charge for a burger. Make it at home it's much cheaper. We are going lose more jobs then ever. You voted in the wrong people.
"HBO Max, Peacock, Netflix, Prime, Disney, Youtube... Pretty soon people will spend $100 on these + internet.So much for cutting the chord."
"Raymond James put a $32.00 price target on T three days ago. That's not enough to make anyone buy. You can easily make 2 bucks a share trading bio stocks, banks, fuel cells, or solar in just one day. Sure they don't pay dividends but so far that has not paid off well if you owned T for one year. This is the day before ex div and this stock is stalled with some even selling to miss the next payout."
Breakout should be imminent
BOOM ! Hit 30
We are up a nickel in premarket. Will it hold??
"No one wants to touch this stock - CNN is toxic for more than half the country, AT&T is the ""uncool"" brand for any smartphones, HBO is a relic from the 70s. I'd fire the entire Marketing & Communications team, followed by the CEO & Board."
Got The Dividend Yesterday! And Get To Add Some Cheap Shares Today! Sweet;)
Boy look at that BP go. It was $15 3 1/2 months ago and now it's pushing $23. That's a real growth stock and it pays a 5 1/2% dividend besides.
A month ago I said T was a $28-$29 stock. Still is.
Big Baby has left the building. Not even man enough to stay for the Inauguration. Sad. Wimpy. Good riddance.
Green stands for cash. LOL Next week Wednesday we're going to be rolling in dough. I can feel it.
BIG MISSITOLD YA !
Well this has been undervalued very long. Even when numbers are good analysts come back with reasons why it will be bad next time . And the street listens regardless of how well it does. But sooner or later the numbers will be so out of line with the stock price it will make a move. I think we are there now but time will tell.
Yea $30.00 lol
"Gas up 25 cents overnight. Thanks, Joe!"
Talk about manipulation look at Gamestock the last 6 months and todays spike.
What a #$%$ company.
Told you
"Most stocks drop after they report earnings and it doesn't seem to matter whether they're good or bad. Don't be surprised if T does the same. I'm glad it's up because I just want it close close above $28.50 on Friday so even if it drops after the ER, the cushion might be enough to keep it above $28.50. I like where it's at right now!"
"I have gone over the latest report and read many articles of people that have done the same. Bottom line the dividend is rock solid, the wireless business is doing fine, even the wired business in not a total loss. Yes direct TV has issues and yes WB has issues due almost entirely to the shutdown. HBO Max is growing at a slower pace than some of us wanted but I believe by the next Quarter T will have a deal with Amazon and Ruku, or at least be on its way of having a deal. But anyone that says the dividend is in trouble they don't know what a balance sheet. They have zero clue. This week I will reinvest the dividend payment, at these prices is a slamdunk."
glad to see Rush is dead - there is a great equalizer and life is fair
"Road to below $25 Begins, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
Hoping price drops to $28.40
"When everyone said...sell, sell, sell. I bought, bought, bought! Because of this I make over $150 for every penny the stock rises. In other words, it's amazing what reinvesting dividends can do for you. Strong buy and hold long term!"
"OMG, this stock never goes up!"
"did i hear that right? amy klobachar taking credit for breaking up ATT which lead to the use of cell phones?trumpy may have told some whoppers but this is right up there with gore inventing the internet, obama saying your health insurance will go down, and obama bribing the iranians with 1.5 billion in CASH"

"This is from last month but I never saw it on any news feed til today... sorry if it's a re-post (not really)https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2018/09/27/nine-states-support-at-t-in-antitrust-battle.htmlLast year, 11 states joined the federal government’s lawsuit to block the $54 billion merger of Anthem and Cigna. Eight states supported DOJ’s challenge to the $37 billion merger of Aetna and Humana. And 16 states joined the Federal Trade Commission’s opposition to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar’s combination.The Justice Department’s antitrust case seeking to stop AT&T’s $109 billion acquisition of Time Warner, however, has garnered no support from any state attorneys general.In fact, nine state attorneys general – seven Republican and two Democratic – filed an unprecedented amicus brief late Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declaring their support for the AT&T merger and their opposition to the federal government’s arguments."

There will be more upgrades when the stock buyback program is officially announced! I wonder if some of the sellers like Elloitt are getting back in.
I said at 33 and I'll say again: Patience will pay for long term investors. It always has and it will continue to do so. Long T!!
Low volume let’s sellers push it down easier. Tomorrow should pick up to normal after “the talk”. We will see from there but today really isn’t a tell.
The trumptyrioters at the Capitol preferred T-Mobile phones bc T had no service!
It is obvious how the market feels about this stock. Reaching lower and lower as most stocks are at all time highs. Severe competition and heavy debt. Owner of Direct TV that is losing millions of customers continually! This stock needs to be a lot cheaper before I would consider it in my portfolio.
Just manipulation they want to buy cheap. The earnings are good. This stock is going to be over 40 next year. Very safe field for investors
Looks like we're finally breaking though $30! Go T! CNN most watched cable news network.
"Here comes the dividend reinvestment get ready to say OH NO up T goes as your broker rips you OFF LOL,LOL,LOL"
"T gets left out of almost all the conversations about online streaming companies. Media is very focused on Apple, which is a joke. T has the second largest catalog behind Disney. Netflix by comparison would need to spend decades creating content at their current pace to catch up to where T is today. I don't think people realize how massive this really is."
"So let me get this straight. Over the past year T has dropped from 38 to 28 a share, but the dividend makes this a good stock to hold?? I'm just trying to understand ones logic for continuing to hold this... Anyone care to explain?"
I’m sure yesterday’s surge was not an accident. Worst comes to worst we collect 7.2% forever.
"Wondering if just buying in after market and selling in pre market , almost daily, is the best way to trade T"
Should open $29+ today
T is fitting every house in Chicago land with fiber optic . will give another great option for high speed internet.I only had one good option for the last 30 year's.
"T's day is finally upon use. After obsurd DTV purchase and overpaying for Warner, we are nevertheless finally at a point where T is actually utilizing their Warner assets in a strategic way, yet these assets are being ignored at the moment, however by next earnings the success of HBO Max both as a service as well as it's role in post paid adds and low churn will be too obvious to ignore"
"I just resold for .24 each, the T Puts that I bought back this morning for .16 each. That's not a lot in actual money but it is a lot in percent per trade. A 50% gain in one day is a good trade no matter how much money is involved."

"TI guess someone reported my post? Yahoo deleted it. Be jealous if you want to, but I hold 57K shares of T at just under 30 and pan on compounding anything priced at $32/share or under.Call me."
Disney and HBO Max have all the content to dominate World Wide streaming by 2025!
Don't believe any article you read about the C Band Auction. None of them know anything. That info will not be disclosed until after the auction is over. It's all just speculation.
Health care was growing exponentially as people were living longer. Something had to be done about it or the world economy would collapse. Hence the Wu-Han virus.
"Had it with T, retired from there . Bellsouth was a great company. Sold almost all it,good dividend .Lousy mangement. will buy NO MORE...."
"If HBO ($T) ever decides to pull it together and pump out some Harry Potter TV series like Disney is doing with The Mandalorian (or all of Marvel), can you imagine the subscriber growth? They own the rights to produce any film adaptation of the #1 selling book series of all time. How hard can it be to get J.K. to sign off on this. Worth buying just on THAT. 7.5% is totally worth it for Robinhood users though, especially since they dropped their margin % to 2.5%. And yes, I get how margins work."
"Look's Like A Great Day For , AT&T , Stock , Great Safe Dividend's , At 7% , And Their Stock Price Is On It's Way To $34.00 , To $36.00 , And AT&T , Profit's Keep Growing , And I Will Be Adding More AT&T , Stock , Today , GLTA ,"

No you do not need to be retired to move your money to an IRA , you just can not be working for the Government and you can move your TSP to your own IRA that you are in control of . All you that left the Service and did not vote for Joe the DEM wit you need to move your TSP ASAP Good luck Joe will try and stop the massive amount of money leaving the TSP"
We shall see next week on 'Analyst Day'- if anything it is the 'high debt load' - which they already explained how they are handling and managing with over 90% of debt is 'fixed' at low rates and with well managed payment structure- and the 'DOJ /Dish conspiracy against them'.
"Yep, T folding like always."
People think investing in T is safe. Not if you consider the opportunities you are missing and what you get in return.
Well I thought they would take to stock up but the market was so bad and they did try but I have confidence the stock will open probably around 29 for the reinvestment (Drip) plan.￼￼
sooooooo much debt!! Stimulus forever??
"Randall L. Stephenson is probably in his last year or two as CEO. At some point an activist investor is going to step in. Funds own a lot of this and they can't keep taking huge haircuts year after year. As far was Wall Street is concerned, Verizon seems to do no wrong and AT&T can do nothing right."
"""It comes as no surprise that AT&T (NYSE: T) led the charge, losing 616,000 ""premium TV"" customers (mostly DirecTV subscribers). "" with these kind of q4 losses, T price has shown incredible resilience. perhaps most of the bad news is behind T."
"T) will begin trading ex-dividend on January 08, 2021. A cash dividend payment of $0.52 per share is scheduled to be paid on February 01, 2021."

Another auction coming in October. Sure hope T saves for this one because we don’t need anymore debt added
"T is only selling a 30% stake of DTV to TPG for 16billion. T will still control 70% of DTV. Good move. T is beginning to make the right moves, and will become more, and more profitable."
The talk about T offering a free HBO Max supported by ads as an additional option to the ad free current option at $14.99 month. Not sure if that would work and would those paying a monthly subscription cancel and convert to free ?
REAL WINNING !!!!!
"So 5G and T is a bad investment, but TSLA, RIDE, NKLA, is good. One makes real profits, the other is working on it. Every car company can make an electric vehicle. T revenue 172BTSLA revenue 24B"
Today it's January 9th and AT&T still owns the most reliable name in fake news CNN.
"so my very capable high performance I bought new and had windows 7, now needs windows 10 for some desirable things. All the major tax software, Turbo Tax, tax act, etc. require Windows 10 if not 8. One or two have an online thing that is somewhat version independent. Jesus. This forced upgrade is as bad as the cell phone smart phone manipulation that keeps requiring, 2g to 3g to 4 g to 5g, etc"
The geriatrics that are destroying T are the same that have destroyed the earth with their greed. Forever to be remembered as the worse generation and the sooner they are gone the better for everyone. These were the same olds mad at NFLers expressing their 1st amendment. See how quickly the NFL flipped on that one when we won!!!
"T bouncing around 1996 to 1998 levels. T not alone. Look at BMY, PFE, BAC, GE, etc.....Gen X Money managers busy chasing Bitcoin, Blockchain and Bubble tech is dilutive to the entire market."
"More than 1 million fiber adds for the year, 1.5 million post paid phone net adds for the year, 17.2 million hbo max subscribers. And net debt is down to $147 billion"
Time to offload the Constipated News Network. See the look on Fake Tappers face and the title makes sense.
It wouldn’t surprise me if T finishes in the red￼
XYZ MUTED! 
The company needs some growth. No real sales growth in 10 years.
ATT is cash-strapped.What's left to monetize?CNN?CNN?
"I keep seeing these effective T Mobile ads on tv. Where are T’s ? T Mobile is aggressive while T plods along. Even as a long time T investor, I admireT Mobile for what they have done."
In the meantime everyone is watching HBO Max and talking on their AT&T Cell ...And Direct TV is the best. It's Dividend is safe and sound. It's unbelievable AT&T is not at $60 pps. It's currently operating extremely fast and well. It's at the front of everything. Including owning Warner Bros Entertainment. This Company is rocking it.
"Does T close above $29.00 today. Thumbs up ""Yes""Thumbs down ""No"""
Analyst mentioned Comcast’s should spin off Peacock streaming service and merge or combine it with with ATT’s HBO max and start a new company. Would post the link but I don’t know how. Said otherwise they will never catch Netflix or Disney as content acquisition is to expensive.
"Wow, look at that BP go!! Woo Woo"
I just rolled my March 26 $26 BP covered calls up to the $27's for a cost of .58 each.
"Has lost over 20% in the last year, but hey, it has that great dividend, hahaha."
Green is good.
"Believe far more chance of 20% up than down especially if HBO surprises to upside which I think it will....that said, most likely scenario is flat stock price and continue to enjoy the 7% yield."
...and the big sell of starts. too much debt. no jobs. cant stimuli to infinity!
America’s flocking to movies and bars. (Yahoo news) Warner has about 17 releases this year.
Phil I hope you got the joke
CNN rating up.. AT&T is simple
Stock goes down dividends go up yes dividend is better for me I ain’t giving up my stake
Newbie to this stock. In with 3500@28.69 last week.Happy New Year 
Will it close at $29 or higher? Yes or No.
HBO 41 mill wow
I believe T is on the right track.
Tell the CNN news crew to just report the news. I'm not interested in their personal views.
"T The only American company left you can trust your data with up and green like it should be and the EU run companies VZ, TMUS down and red like they should be as they collect your data to farther the EU's one world order."
"The sum of all assets value exceed what T stock trades now , some think that T debt is too high but they neglect that money is cheap and T businesses are cash generator positive, shares at historically low price, with great dividends payout, T in the process of selling non core businesses and reduce debt in parts or whole. T will hold well in a down market. T is better than holding cash .....Cheers"
Nice stock we have right here lol.
25 DOLLAR IS FAIR PRICE FOR T
Any spike close to or over 30 is an unloading opportunity if you are overweight and cost average is green(ish)28 and below ... add crumbs to lower cost average Rinse and Repeat If market is due for a “major correction” why would T be immune to that pressure ?
Are we printing Homelessness again? GO BIG.
2021 should be a good year for T we should close above 30 Today .HBO-Max is great should help with $$$$$
So...is AT&T destined to stay flat forever??
This is T longs today no stoping us
"Joe and the DEM wits are now using your TSP money again as they steal from you. Just like Obama and Joe did, You can not stop it the only thing you can now do is move your TSP to your own IRA so you are in control of your own money , Joe hates the military that's why they are stealing your money . DEM with hate the military , Remember how bad it was under Obama , Clinton , It will be even worse under Briden and his left wing ding bats. You took an oath to protect America from the Left wing Ding bat DEM wits that want to destroy America. FACT."
Headed to $40. The T content engine hasn't even started yet. If you like Disney and Netflix. Give HBO just a fraction of those multiples and is off and running. The growth is about to be unlocked.
"Argus maintains $48 target:• Reaffirming BUY and $48 target• AT&T's lackluster 3Q19 results, reported on October 28, were overshadowed by the company'sannouncement of its new operating and capital allocation plan, and the introduction of the new HBOMax subscription video-on-demand service.• Management believes that subscriber losses from the Entertainment Group (DirecTV), have peaked.• We are lowering our 2019 EPS estimate to $3.57 from $3.59, but are raising our 2020 forecast to$3.65 from $3.63.• The interest from activist investor Elliott Management has driven T shares higher in 2019, though inour view they remain a bargain relative to some competitors."
A close over $30!!!!!Yahooooooooooo!!!!
you know i was thinkng of selling my shares of viacom and buying att for their dividend.But after what I just heard on Tucker Carlson I wouldn't buy Att if it was a dollar a share.Shame on Att for putting profits before America and shame on anyone who owns Att for putting profit before their country!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Latest from Morningstar: 'T wants customers' :""AT&T Wants Customers: Analyst Day Highlights Focus onStability; Shares AttractiveAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 12 Mar 2021AT&T wrapped up the U.S. wireless carrier proceedings, holding its analyst day following Verizon and TMobile earlier in the week. Unlike its peers, AT&T declined to provide concrete longer-term financialforecasts. The firm instead outlined its expectations in broad strokes, with one exception: debt leverage.AT&T put stability and growth at the center of its messaging to investors, emphasizing the investmentsit is making in 5G, fiber, and HBO Max as foundations for the business. We continue to like the movesnew CEO John Stankey has made thus far. We don’t plan to change our $36 fair value estimate, and webelieve the shares are attractive.Management expects to end the year with net debt at 3.0 times EBITDA, up from 2.7 at the end of 2020and with net leverage declining to 2.5 times EBITDA or lower in 2024. While AT&T does have a higherdividend payout ratio than Verizon or T-Mobile, all three firms now have similar leverage metrics and areat least hinting at large shareholder returns in the coming years. AT&T also has the most diversebusiness mix of the three. We continue to view AT&T’s balance sheet as a strategic limitation (it wouldbe nice to repurchase shares at the current dividend yield) but not a significant threat to its viability.Stankey took the opportunity to address differences between his approach and that of his predecessor.He directly conceded that AT&T has been underinvesting in important areas, including efforts to retainand attract wireless customers. Stankey views establishing and growing customer relationships as the top priority for 2021, which will require investment in networks and content along with additionalmarketing efforts. Both Verizon and T-Mobile used their analyst days to strongly hint that wirelesspricing won’t change much over the next couple of years. While we’re disappointed that the industryisn’t showing pricing power, we’re at least hopeful that AT&T’s drive for customer growth won’t ignite aprice war""."
"There are 123.91 M Shares Sold Short as (02/12/21). If you own T shares, don't let your broker make your shares available to shorts. To prevent that from happening an action you can do, is to place your T holding for sell for an inflated price, that way your broker can't make your shares available for shorts. Do it today !"
Big boys are gobbling up the stock now ——> their analysts will come out and upgrade it —-> big boys make a lot of dough $$$$
"My investment strategy is simple: Besides mutual and index funds (and a select few other individual stocks), buy, hold and never sell AT&T, Verizon and Apple. Hard to go wrong with these three in your back pocket, especially since everyone is 'cellphone addicted' now-a-days. Keep texting my friends lol"
Well there goes the Div
We learned today that the power grid can not support any electric cars even today or the future. LOL 13 states you can not charge any electric cars . What a waste of money is being wasted on electric cars that can not be charged today or even in the future. You will not get me to put one dime in electric cars because that future will not make it. DEM wit pipe dream.
Warner bros is the 2nd highest revenue movie producer ahead of Universal studios! Warner Bros movies are eating the competition alive this season. Reaching a billion worth of sales and eventually more!
"AT&T is making money with 'late payment fees' for the past months on bills that do not even arrive in time to be paid within five business days of the date due listed on the bill. That is highway robbery and fraudulent billing. They blame the USPS and put the burden on their customers to correct a problem of the companies making. Hopefully some NY or CA class action outfit will call them. Or consumer watchdogs will force them to at least mail out a postcard notifying customers, as they can do that for any marketing or promo but not for this as it is making them a ton of unwarranted cash. Late fees paid by customers who are not late at all. Bet other compaies are doing the same thing."
One of the best values out there. Market is just rewarding other metrics besides cash flows and user bases. If T was an IPO it would go up 500% in a day. Let’s get some god dam positive news going
100% right Pat.
Netflix showed good results. Difficult situation for T. I hope it will not be that bad. I will abadon this stock with just a small profit.
Red Equal has been placed in The MUTED Waiting Room.

CNN is now doing much better.. up AT&T we go.
"In the next episode of “Dividend Chasers,” watch another .5% disappear from T investors."
Did I just actually see a good ATT commercial?
The Lincoln Project versus CNN.It's hard to decide which one is worse?
T= Free cash flow $7.9 Billion up 78% Full year $22.4 Billion up 36%
At one time we would get a dividend increase in December.Anyone know why we have not received an increase ?
yikes. painful reversal in semis. im getting hurt. #AMD
"I've been a share holder for awhile now and today I have decided... At&t is a value trap. I haven't sold my shares yet, but I'm on the brink. I had hopes otherwise, but it seems every time we take a step forward we take another step back. It's like management has actively decided to be the worst or just next to it in every industry they get us in. I was hoping for an entire divesture of DTV, but we got a measly $7B back out of the $67B invested. Debt is crippling this company from growth and now we just went and took out even more debt to be in the 5G auction. VZ made double the investment in 5G that we just did so they will easily be the industry leader in 5G taking market share from At&t. I first looked at At&t's multiple streams of income as a way to be diversified. However they are arent a leader in any of the industries they are in. There is no focus. Slow to no growth Telecom, confusing/ chaotic media provider (HBO go, HBO Max, At&tNow, DirecTV, Uverse), content creator (don't even want to see how bad they mess up warnermedia) I'm sure any income they get from warner media will be squandered away to pay for past mistakes and playing catch up in 5G. I dont even trust the dividend is safe anymore. Rising interest rate are coming and that will be the end of it. I've just had enough. Hopefully my shares will go to somebody who can find the value in it that I can't."
"I heard Joe tell a reporter the other day that the reporter was a One Horse Pony. He said you are a real One Horse Pony. What is that. I have heard of a One Trick Pony, but never a One Horse Pony. Is that a monogamous pony or what. Gaffe number 462,149."

"I’m proud to be a Neanderthal, a deplorable, a former Texas resident, a current Florida resident, a free speech person, a lover of the Constitution, a Independent voter, and a proud AmericanGod bless America.."
Maybe old Warren Buffett made the wrong call by buying VZ and not T. We will see.
looks like little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff 123456789 woke up from his after lunch nap.....or his meds have worn out......he sure does spew out meaningless BEE ESS for someone who owns ZERO ATT shares
"omg, look at it fade. It is going to finish red again! T is hopeless."
"All the T HATERS get ready to say OH NO up T goes, Why because both VZ and TMAUS earnings report are Telling you T's new unlimited cell plan were you get HBO MAX for FREE is now taking customers away from both of them , Just wish T had started that sooner, but they are now taking more and more customers away from both VZ and TMUS everyday. T monster is ALIVE and now growing . LOL,LOL,LOL"
Mother Zucker should just leave now. Only.put out the statement trying to find a job.
T is sick.Thank you ANDY for bringing BP back to my attention. I had completely forgotten about it until you reminded me of it again. You can remind me of other great stocks anytime! Woo Woo
Gonna use my stock certificates to wipe stuff off the bottom of my shoe.

@VZ no anonymous @VZ they were told to protect the lines going in to the capitol building. I can bank money on that - + is is National Security Verizon has the lines. we don't want a repeat of Nashville @VZ.
Go bucks.. GO T..32 tomorrow.
"Down 30% in two years. That just about 5 years worth of dividend yield. Revenues have declined for the past two years. Maybe it's time to get someone new at the helm. Stephenson has been CEO for 11 years, and the only thing that continues to go up is his salary. The shareholders sure aren't seeing any benefit."
I need this to drop back to 29.90 new buy price i have missed the last months lows by pennies
Does it make sense to replace T with a better combination of Viacom CBS and Verizon?
DG MUTED!
TMany of those HBO subscribers are free and don't even know they have it. More smoke and mirrors from T. Short-lived pop and then back down to 29's. Show me don't tell me.
free money falling from the sky - who knew the covid party would be so great
Down she goes day after day So nice
CNN must be spun off. If you can't sell it just spin it off and let it sink. CNN is all about what is worst with this country. It has to go! It is an embarrassment to all shareholders.
wow if this ain't stability than I dunno what stability is
"I have a theory on the price action for T this past week. If you look at stocks that have even a remotely larger short interest, they have performed much better this past week - see SKT, IRM, KR and of course, GME. Could it be possible; even probable, that these hedge funds have been freaked by the whole GME phenomenon and are covering their shorts to keep from being ""hooded""? Where are they getting the $$ to cover their short positions? Selling from other long positions, if they have no money on the sidelines. And, if they have money on the sidelines, they are not putting new money to work in T at the moment. In a sense, we are being manipulated in that weak long positions are selling and there aren't as many buyers as there normally would be due to it being put to work elsewhere. Just my theory and I'm sticking to it. We will return to $35 or more in the coming month...just hang tight."
"Other than the dividend, AT&T is a dud. Unless you're one of those ""set it and forget"" types, then maybe you are happy with its lack of performance."
Bought some shares throughout the past two weeks and some more earlier today. In at an average of $29.00 . Will be adding to my position with my dividend payment.
Is there a need for 10G?Just trying to start the conversation.
I wonder how much are stock is going to go down today
ED pattern on the one day chart.
"Chill. It's just bad timing. The tide of the overall market is too negative for any individual company like T to overcome, even with a relative positive report. The price of T today is not about T, just a general reflection in sympathy with the market. If T was going to get hit, it was going to get HIT, period. A negative report today would have sent the stock MUCH farther downward! Again, today's action is not personal to T, just the market carrying T along. T's report today will truly be reflected when the market resumes, and apparently that ain't happening today. Yes. it can be frustrating, but don't be a sucker and sell today. I always thought it would be the next quarter before you get a true indicator of real sustainable positive movement in these times of a pandemic. Again, today is ALL about the MARKET, not T. Chill!"
"Raymond James upgrades ATT to outperform, target 32."

Just get your shares and lock them up long term with good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start which we will need to raise or any higher price you want for them . T's monster is alive and going to be taking millions and millions of customers from VZ, T Mobile and NFLX LOL,LOL you don't even need to make stuff up when it's all so true . Took the smartest people in the room to build a real monster that no company can compete with LOL,LOL,LOL"
Vagician muted! Low IQ
The DTV deal lands with a thud. Ex CEO Randy makes Immelt look like a genius. He is the one responsible for one idiotic decision after another. Gonna take a long time to clean up this mess. They ought to take Randy's one million dollar fee and give to some young up and comer who might have an idea how to properly market their assets. A very stodgy company that needs some outside help. IMO
Looks like a major flush tomorrow morning...Thanks Joe.
"Here's a legitimate question for this board. Whenever T drops, someone always says, ""I love when T drops because it gives me another chance to buy cheap shares."" So why do so many of you whine every time T has a Red day? Are you happy that you can ""load up"" on more ""cheap shares"" or are you frustrated that it dropped again? The other possibility is that you don't really know if you're happy or frustrated. So which is it??"
More people here are starting to see the value of selling Puts and Covered Calls to boost their returns and that makes me feel good. Just trying to help you all make more money here.
Gamer MUTED!
Just read cnn ratings down yeah 30 could still happen. In a parallel universe
No interest in the telecoms right now.
The weekends is only time T isnt dropping...
great volume and price action considering the market dropping like a rock
If they really want to juice HBO Max they should speed up the production of Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon! Currently the release date is sometime in 2022....
Wow cnbc trying to protect the little guy from trading no journalism
Wallstreet Bets please come to T and Squeeze the Shorts here
The dividend is not secure.AT&T's Capital Ratio is now .82VZ's Capital Ratio is 1.38
For sure now one thing is becoming really clear VZ did not change the company enough to compete in the new world they now face as they are now losing customers to both T's monster new cell plans and T mobile. The only asset VZ has is now running off it's customers and SHAREHOLDERs as they VZ one world oder yahoo NATZI censor both their customers and shareholders LOL You don't even need to try and make stuff up when it all so true. If you own any VZ shares you will need to be out of VZ stock before VZ next earnings report show all the customers losses that are now taking place. WOW is it bad now at VZ
"If millions switch from T because of CNN, T's dividend is not safe."
"Still no word on the DTV situation. Everything about this company takes forever. Took them forever to get the streaming service off the ground, so why should the DTV deal be any different."
"Hello folks fellow long $T here with 1800 shares. I want to direct attention to my successful high dividend and growth plays . MO is going to 50 at least and pays well, and ORCC is a hidden gem with at least 30-40% upside with massive dividend."
Sam MUTED!!!
This might be the only stock didn’t work this year.......
That lawsuit going to sit for years ain’t gonna change nothing it’s going past 31 regardless
Forward p/e of 10.....HBO Max will outperform Netflix in latest quarter for new subscriber growth (Netflix PE is >80) and company will also benefit from 5G super cycle. The only thing not to like is high debt....but given low interest rate can live with that. I bought $AAPL when PE was 12......for me this is similar value opp that we will look back and say...why didn’t I see how that stock was beaten down to a crazy point? Good luck all....do your own DD but I am long T and have conviction it will be a top performer in 2021.
welcome back to everyone looking for a safehaven rn
option expiry today
"AT&T's movies had 80% of the USA box office this past weekend. The latest being ""Tom and Jerry"". They are doing as well as they can with a little more than 50% of the theaters closed and the movies being available on HBO Max. By the end of this year, the theaters will probably be open again."
"This must be one of the most pointless stocks of the last year. Omg, what a disaster, goes nowhere."
LONG ON T
Shorts have the wrong stock in T--short something with no cash flows! Cash flow of T is super in this environment and dividend is solid.
AT&T is not undervalued. It's valued at whatever someone is willing to pay for it.
anyone else get the feeling this will close today right around 28.50 strike?
"any tech analysis fans out there, T hit the bottom of a 2,20dma Bollinger band today."
park your money here and collect 7 % .I done that 9 years ago .might sell in 10 more years.
"In the pre-market it appeared like T was in for a bad day. But so far it's turning out to be ok! For a moment there it went over $30.00. Something is up, besides T's price!"
First big day in awhile and people on here talking like it’s going to the moon again. This is an earnings bump. People chasing in hopes of a big beat. Any miss on eps or subs and we see $27 again fast. So let’s just hope for the best and stop the speculation.
"guess my 30 dollar call will expire worthless today. guess I'll write another one next week. Maybe I'm just meant to keep this stock. Meanwhile, blood pressure will continue to spike."
CNN is nonstop lies 24 hours a day. AT&T owns CNN.
"I have owned this stock a few times and have had AT &T at my business for over 40 years but had to finally let it go, i called 2 months ago as my statement went from 207 to 440 because my agreement lapsed, i called and agreed to sent up a new agreement was told the price will be the same as before for another year and they would credit one month over payment which they did, then on next months bill i was charged 440.00 again asking why they say we discontinued dsl service well being a little upset said i just agreed to 2 months ago to the same price and for a year. they basically told me things changed and my bill will be 270.00 a month instead of 207.00 because they discontinued dsl. well i changed to spectrum so my bill will be 0 from at&t. very disapointing"
"Reportedly (SA article) an industry expert has projected that HBOM has beaten all contenders in new subs for Q4 capturing just short of 20% of total while NFLX was distantly placed with a 7.2% capture.If those projections are anyway close to reality then there will be a lot of short crying on 1/27.Since NFLX just reported 8.5 million new subs in Q4 (up over 11% AH) HBOM would have added over 22 millions new subs in Q4.Even if projection is wildly off and HBOM capture is only 12% that would be over 14 millions new subs.Pollyannish, as it may sound, it is not implausible given the late Q4 deals with Amazon and Roku and the release of WW84 on Christmas. Also considering that Stephenson reported 4 million new subs as of late October/early November, and that was before both deals, neither the 14 nor the 22 millions are outlandish."
Netflix up 15% just today and we get a 7% annual dividend?

"Is this Stankey's first earnings report since he became ceo?If so, It's hard to imagine that it would be anything but okay or better. Or at least accompanied by some good news about the sale of DTVand/or respectable HBOmax sub numbers.Only my opinion. Glta."
"Hope you got some shares on sale this morning , Last chance because earnings are coming and the numbers from HBO MAX , Get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
AT&TSinger and Elliott are shameless. They made money on 90 percent of their stake from 2019 but lost money on the final 10% that they sold last year. 5 million shares. So now he buys 5 million shares again to try and get a bounce to dump those for a profit as well.
"Partnership with Nokia. Hilarious, Two peas in a pod, both bum stocks and companies."
They sell stake in DirecTV to pay for 5G bidding.
Jason Kilar tweeting about the 80s Lakers series Showtime. Could be epic.
"Looking forward this year, if DTV is sold, considerably less revenue. Much higher costs for HBO content as HBO makes up revenue lost due to theatre closures. $18+ billion spent but not completely paid for spectrum. It doesn’t look like an environment that allows for debt reduction. As other services providers partner with streamers. T, because of owning HBO, finds it’s at competitive odds with BOTH service providers AND streamers. Jury is out on owning Warner."
Roll Tide!
I don’t know why I feel this is going to pop to $50 bucks all other mobile companies are over $50 ATNT is super undervalued
Very strong day this early post dividend
The 30 day grace period for disclosure of positions is bumping up against the annual meeting. I'm thinking someone is playing his hand now because proxy time is around the corner.
"The C-Band auction should be AT&T last major investment. No others that I'm aware of anyway.. After that's all said and done, LTD will rise a bit near-term, but capital expenditures should remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future as HBO Max, 5G, and Fiber build outs more forward as planned. FCF will be sufficient to continue funding those build outs while servicing debt and paying dividends. Of course it will take years for a multinational conglomerate of this size to build shareholder value. In the meantime, collect cash and reinvest."
all this roaring action this week is a HUGE SIGN!14% unemployment is a reality.
"Federal Judge Rules That FTC Doesn't Have Strong Enough Evidence In Claims Against AT&T's DirecTV -- MarketWatch2:52 pm ET August 16, 2018 (MarketWatch)SharePrintA federal judge ruled on Thursday that the Federal Trade Commission doesn't have strong enough evidence to back its claim that AT&T Inc. (T) subsidiary DirecTV engaged in deceptive advertising of its satellite TV service, according to the Wall Street Journal. The FTC was seeking nearly $4 billion in restitution, alleging in 2015 that DirecTV had advertised a discounted 12-month pay-TV plan but didn't make it clear to consumers they were actually signing up for a two-year contract and that prices could increase. AT&T shares have fallen 15% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 6.3%"
"DOW 50K, T $32. Thats my prediction."
AT&T is not really controversial... Gene Inger simply says buy the dips 29-31 especially if we get another during re-allocation; and watch and see this stock not just maintain the dividend but move higher on a stronger PE multiple as a media stock within a year.
Stoked I bet on this company! Excited for the dividend payments.
"Wall Street is buying T but so sorry if you own VZ you are about to lose lots of money LOL,LOL,LOL"
I'm calling on AT&T to keep it's Aristocrat Dividend in tact. I would like to see a 1 penny added to the Dividend and continue it's Legacy. Thank You.
"The DOW is up only 0.38%. T is up over 2.60%. However, volume seems normal. Anything, anyone?"
As an employee I will get my div at COB of ex div date. Then I will shed 25-30% if it recovers some of the div amount.Been burnt with its downhill climb towards and post ER too many times. Maybe HBOMax will save the dayMaybe notWill buy back again if major dip or hold/DRIP the rest as needed.
Moscow Mitch is History. That Turtle needs to take his place in the back benches of the Senate and ride out his term.
6 percent dividend and PE less than for 7 is not bad
Laughable that CNN is just now putting some heat on Gov. Cuomo. Where was this before the elections?!? I thought so..No credibility as a news source.
$30 calls slipping away. Better hope tomorrow brings some good news
"Make 6% dividend,lose 20% per year"
Still at the same price where I bought it and keeps paying out dividends. Limited downside risk. Give it another year for capital appreciation and get paid to wait....
Ugly day in the market. But $T is outperforming the Dow and the other indices. Forming a nice strong base here. I will buy more tomorrow.
I suspect T will go down tomorrow to $29.62. Just a feeling.
"So far, drop today exceeds the dividend earned yesterday. Appears T back to range of $28-$29. Maybe change if good earnings report later this month and HBO Max subscribers increased to at least 20 million plus."
If you want to get the dividend in T you have to own the shares before Jan 8 2021 . why because T goes ex dividend on Jan 8 2021 Time to lock in that dividend before you miss out
It should be over $40.00 but I am here for the Dividend which is very generous.
"Ok ATT TV raised my streaming TV another $10 a Month and that is the straw that broke the Camel's Back I am moving on to another service. Started around $40 a Month now up over $80. Do not have ATT in my portfolio, so I couldn't care less what the stock price does. Bought Kroger before Warren Buffet great earnings and service. Good by Bandito!"
This stock closes green today.
Still believing and paying my bills on time.
"All the T haters better learn to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"T is my largest holding but I feel that it is a company that has lost it's way. Recently, I cancelled DTV and now I am switching to T Mobile because T has lousy customer service and has not bothered to update DTV since the pathetic purchase. I believe that the next earnings report will show continued baling not only on DTV but also on the mobile side. I actually hate this company but have not sold it due to the dividend."
Do you all know what one can do with INFINITE cash. Control the markets. If the FED wants the markets to go up it will go up. If the FED wants the markets to go down it will go down.Never go against the FED.
Say ANDY or Vagipuss. My computer isn't working too good today so could you please tell me how BP is doing today?
"T couldn't sell the crummy HBO Max on its own so now they just bundle it into the deal like those lousy cosmetics you get ""free with purchase"" just to move them out. LOL.LOL.LOL Another day...watching it swirl."
Cheetah is using all of his aliases today to make sure that his stooopid messages get plenty of thumbs-up ratings.
"Got my Div. today. FromAT&T, Very happy. Good Div."
"Tax loss selling season is over. Where will people park their money? Perhaps at a undervalued stock, trading near a 5+ year low, paying a 7.3% dividend?"
"Trimmed portfolios into cash hoarding for now.Making bank on SRMX, MARA and ADMP at the moment. Yes, its gambling but still funny how I am making back entire dividends with only a few hundred dollars in play. About the only thing to do now is find runners separate from the bloated broad market.Still have a decent chunk of T at just above cost average. Not losing sleep on it and have maximum DROP and contributions going to it while it churns"
Too bad they couldn't unload Direct TV. Huge mistake buying that.
NNDMDOES ANYBODY KNOW WHY ARK IS BUYING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SHARES EVERYDAY OF NNDMThanks in advance and thank me later DO YOUR RESEARCHNNDM is Almost top 5 in ARKQ they did their DD
The stock price is telling you what a success HBO Max and WW84 is.
"People are buying more shares, omg, talk about dense. Down over 20% in a year while everything else up huge, but it pays that dividend. smh..."
Looks like some profit taking after a couple good days. Some money is to be made if you are in the cycle and start chasing the stock share pricing. I have a couple of companies I hold with 3 and 4 dollar swings every week. I just can’t bring myself to chasing stocks. When this is over I hope our economy recovers in a timely manner. I am too old to have to live through a four year recession. Be safe. Be well.
If T is a defensive stock then why aren't more running into it for the dividend and overall fundamentals?
"Homegamers..... I Had 8,900 Shares.... Kept For The DIVVY..Sold 2 Day Ago Actually @29.67.....Found KMI, Also Paying A Great DIVVY Tomorrow.......Took My T Money........Bought KMI... You Might Say I SOLD T And......."
"The deal is closed, to be appealed it would have to be a issue of law"
"I dare anyone to read anything into this chart with the loan exception maybe that the price it's currently trading around seems like it has become support, excluding the wash-out in Dec, which took down the whole market. Even recent moves in golden cross and macd crossovers haven't meant @#$#. But that's all fine, because my belief all along has been the company simply needs to deliver some good fundamental news....be it earnings or key drivers. Any others on the board that consider themselves good chartists feel free to weigh in. I'm one that believes sometimes, not often but sometimes, a stock becomes totally detached from the technicals. That's where I think we are."
"Let's see what happens when 5G come's out, and all the potential that will come with it. T will be right in the forefront of it all with other big companies."
"AT&TOh my.. but what do you expect when the new CEO, when speaking of the dividend, says ""what do we get for it???"""
Does anyone know what Craig Moffet's thoughts are on this huge investor day for T?
"This is where we sit.CURRENT PRICE27.89, at support, 28.03 ± 0.364 type double, strength 10SUPPORT BELOW-1.7% at 27.41 ± 0.356 type single, strength 5-4.5% at 26.62 ± 0.346 type single, strength 5RESISTANCE ABOVE+4% at 29 ± 0.377 type triple+, strength 10+7% at 29.84 ± 0.388 type triple, strength 9+10.5% at 30.82 ± 0.401 type single, strength 8"
"27.00 - 27.50 would be a great range to add, a retest of 26.50 even better.There is not too much short interest. A target of 37.00 could be a level to exit the trade."
Verizon's new Tracfone Airtime plans lower than ever my only burner 15$ samsung smartphone 500 500 500 = minutes text data lowest ever
The DEMS will get T to $40 by the end of this year. Just watch.
T selling Direct TV--Good news or Bad?
Let's keep that selling price slightly above $29 by Feb 26 so the Feb 26 $29 Puts I sold expire worthless. I'm pulling for you T. A Slightly above $29 close on Feb 26 would be perfect!
I love my CNN. The #1 cable news network. I love my propaganda. CNN never lies as they’re the ministry of truth. I only trust CNN news. Fox news is for insurrectionist.
"Next movers for T share price include Kong vs Godzilla, normal runup to ex dividend day, and 2 wks later earnings report. If all go well we could be looking at 32-33 by end of April."
"Expect big move on Friday to $34 on Investor's Day. Most likely a Buyback announcement. No one is expecting much, which is why we'll get a big move. T is now getting tailwinds on so many fronts. It will not stay below $30 for very long."
Doubt T will go higher or lower. Its stuck in the mud spinning its wheels. As long as it pays 7% its a CD.
Cash hoard truck restarted...just warming up ...not backing up yet....
"Sorry folks, I think today is my fault. Every time I pickup more, the stock drops. I have been averaging down since 34 and figured 29.65 was a nice catch. I will let everyone know when I buy more next time so you can get out first."
I prefer the price holding right here. Many of us get tempted to sell if a stock goes up 10% and miss out on decades of dividend reinvestment. This tape makes me a forever holder.
"An honest question from a novice trader.I'm looking for an entry point on T, and I already have multiple scars from trying to catch falling knives so don't want to add to my collection.In the opinion of the board how will the possible decisions of the DOJ case affect the price?If they approve the deal will the price go up or down and conversely if they say no which way is the price likely to move?"
"My projection: in the next 3-6 months this stock will hit 39.00 USD.Which might not be as high as you want, but that's probably the max, and still offers a good upside.On the downside I see 26.50 USD. I took a position today, wasn't paying attention to this before."
"The FED will buy up at least 50% of the bonds before they are done. With all the money printing, Inflation will be 0.1%. Thats the Core PCE deflator."
"T Mobile @ $130 share vs T @ $28+ per share. Why is that, other than difference in management. I had sold 1/3 of my T when it recently reached $30 and change, and was ridiculed for it but looking back, was a good decision. Still have the remaining 2/3 shares (800) and just hoping for good er on Jan 27th, so T doesn’t drop more."
"Hiya HomeGamers !I LOVE MY 'T' ! Long About 8,900 @28.82 or so.Just Sold Some SLV. Have 178K Ready To ADD To My T Position...Come Back To $28.82....Ready to ADD More !"
"Just an Update nice Asia guy helped change my flat tire on the Mini Bus. I asked what kind of tire and all he said was ""it's BF goodright."" OK I feel so safely now that she's right here and ready."
"Broke &30, that means $29 is coming!!"
"Just be glad you don't own VZ or T Mobile because their stock are dropping and they are going to get SLAUGHTER as T stock Skyrockets LOL,LOL,LOL"
I'd like to see T move up to $29 again where my Puts are.
DEM wits are now using your TSP money again. You need to move it to your own IRA if you can before they won't let you
the bubble has popped... we all knew it was coming. BTC crashing
Red again?

There's that Buy on the rumor bump before ER news...
Red in a sea of green. Ground hog day. Again.
T is in no man’s land with the grey area surrounding future dividend increases. The cash flow is monstrous but knowing when to go Long for the long term is now a crapshoot.
No stock is safe guys. If your long term you shouldn’t care about day to day price fluctuations
"Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. is nearing a deal to sell a significant stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG, marking a long-sought exit from the struggles of managing a declining satellite TV business.A deal would value DirecTV at about $15 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That’s a fraction of the $48.5 billion AT&T agreed to pay for the business in 2014.If AT&T and TPG are able to reach a deal, an announcement could come as soon as this week or next, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.The talks could still fall apart and end without a deal, the people said."
"Wow, T is green, that's a first."
Teun MUTED!
What Does this mean to the current T shareholder? Will we get shares of the new company or is it publicly traded?
"$32 post earnings beat, hbo max numbers and content pipeline, 5G rollout, stable+ 2021 outlook. Implied div yield 6.5%. CNN is a drop in the ocean of AT&T, and still the best news station globally. Stop the whining :)"
WONDER W 2. WILL IT EVEN COME CLOSE TO BREAKING EVEN?
This breaks 30 on the 27th
ATT has awful (foreign) phone support. they lost my return phone and never sent me my $150 rewards card. snkakes
does the stock go down 2% on Friday because of ex dividend
CNN - dont fear the facts. Try to prove them wrong if they make you sad.#facts
This thing will not cross $30 today. I guarantee it.
"Because I’m a Direct TV customer and an AT&T customer, I believe I will get HBO Max at a discount every month......and maybe the first 3 months free. :-)"
"That sharp fall at end of day, preview of tomorrow’s opening, lol."
"YEP ! It Was T......Reason For The Nashville Incident !Investigators are reportedly examining whether a suicide bomber with a fear of 5G technology could be behind a Christmas morning explosion in Nashville’s historic downtown that injured three people.The blast, which caused extensive damage to dozens of buildings in Tennessee’s biggest city, took place outside a facility owned by the telecommunications company AT&T and knocked out or impaired mobile phone services in several other cities.Federal agents spent the weekend looking into a 63-year-old man who owned an RV motorhome similar to the one that detectives believe was turned into a mobile bomb and driven to the scene.Meanwhile, a Nashville television news channel reported that a person of interest, named as Anthony Warner from a south eastern suburb of the city, worked as an information technology consultant for a real estate company.Steve Fridrich, a realtor who contacted the FBI after hearing the man’s name on a news bulletin, told WSMV TV that federal agents had asked him if Warner had a paranoia about 5G technology.According to WSMV, sources close to the law enforcement investigation have said that among the various tips and lines of inquiry was one that suggested Warner bought into a conspiracy theory that 5G technology was being used to spy on Americans."
"@R going to be crying once he figures out T will probably takes another 15 bln$ charge for DirecTV and another 25 bln$ loan for 5G Spectrum. It'll hit the books in the first quarter with him paying for it, YOU son!"
Sure CEO realized the debt issue and will do everything he can to reduce. We don’t know things he doesn’t. Stock will rise every announcement of debt reduction!
Can’t wait for the next GoT
Anonymous MUTED!
"For those of you worried about T cutting dividends. Not going to happen. Read below:A classic Dividend AristocratAT&T is a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the S&P 500 that has hiked its dividend annually for over 25 years. AT&T (known as Southwestern Bell/SBC Corporation before 2005) raised its dividend annually for 33 straight years.AT&T expects its adjusted EPS to hit the ""upper end of the $3.50 range"" this year, which would represent at least 15% growth from the previous year. The company currently pays a $0.50 quarterly dividend, which equals $2.00 per share for the full year -- which should be easily covered by its earnings.AT&T noted that its free cash flow (FCF) rose 17% annually to $6.5 billion during the quarter, and it expects to finish the year with FCF ""at the high end of the $21 billion range."" That should give AT&T, which spent $12 billion on dividend payments in fiscal 2017, plenty of room to raise its dividend and pay off its long-term debt."
Man I love when this stock price goes down. I feel the NEED to buy more! My future self is so thankful when that dividend hits!
FED handout of $50 a month program for all low income Americans is huge this is many BILLIONS of free money to $T forever...
@cheetah is also using the call strategy
"T is down over 24% since this time last year. Factor in the divy, and it's only down over 17%."
It's like Tom Hanks when he finally got his raft past the big waves surrounding the island. LOL
"In this market stock increase because of momentum. Nothing else. Until T goes up, it won't go up. I don't really understand the thinking, but it's a fact and momentum wins. Market Caps and PE ratios are worthless. T needs to stop the dividend, pay the debt and then the stock will catch fire. As long as they have a dividend they have a metric in which they can't be judged. Tesla has no dividend or even yearly profits, so they can't be judged on anything but hype. That's the new market currency - Hype! T needs to start hyping their brand and get serious about it. Spin off HBO and it would be a $100B company on it's own within a few years. But under T it will have a value of ZERO forever because of T's debt."
Asked everyone many times to refrain from political posts and stick to the business at hand. This is our office. This is our place of business. This is where we gather to share info and expertise so we can make money. The political posts and personal attacks are a waste of everyone’s time. Jim and R reported for wasting my time and other who are here trying to make money.
"Suspicious run up. Caused by dummies buying today, thinking they'll get the dividend this afternoon at closing bell."
How could anyone look at the chart of T and think it is a good investment? This thing is a complete joke.
"Job recovery, 5G, video streaming...$60"
But I thought T was a value trap?
"At&T must borrow enormously to effectuate their 5G plan. They didn’t plan ahead? Typical AT&T, lost in the past, trying to drag itself forward."
"Received notice: Your Vote Counts!AT&T INC.2021 Annual MeetingVote by April 29, 202111:59 P.M. EST"
In for 800 shares with a 28.81 cost basis. Looking for $33 by end of 2021 for a 20%+ total return.
"People like Wonder Woman, but they wont sign-up for it, but the Matrix 4 is a different story. That's my date for whether I stay in this stock. If HBOmax can't sign up 30 Million more for that movie, then it's a dead service to T. If they can't make it work, T would be wise to sell it and return to being a cell company. Right now Apple would pay $150B for Time Warner/HBO. Think about T with $150B less debt and a 7% dividend. That would mean the stock at $50 or $60 easy. The job of management is to return value to shareholders in the long run (it's been 20 yrs since ATT was at $60) so if they can't get there by being a media company, then it behooves them to retrench and get there by being a cell company with low debt."
"Took what money I had left and sold att at a big loss 12 2020. Invested in jd and baba, making money again."
Pre market looks good. I am so excited about this stocks future.
Its good to be poor in America. Almost everything is free.
VZ TMUS T all down today. Sell off not T specific. Solid company long term. Bears love to show up on down days. smh
Here comes the run up just before the ex div date. It's like clockwork.
I see commercial ads and other promotions for Disney+ and Hulu pretty much everywhere.By the way...Question: Does HBO still exist??
I'll guarantee this stock won't go below $28 this week.
"This thing was $32.77 as recently as June 1, 2020. Stuck in neutral right now but T will rise again !!!!!"
"$T AT&T Price Target range $35 -$50, almost all stocks have climbed back to pre-pandemic level, ATT was at $38-$40 during last quarter 2019 and Jan2020. AT&T is expected to move uptrend by March 2021. Grow your position, it’s great discount price at this moment. Best dividend stock by the way."
"Blackrock needed away to get rid of all their way over priced stocks and what better way than to dump them into you TSP accounts LOL,LOL just just can not make this stuff up LOL,LOL,LOL"

"If you are willing to hold long term and if stankey doesn’t get us into another DTV debacle, then T will gradually pay down debt. That alone will make it go up over time. Att is not going out of business so why worry . Get your div average down, wait. Diversify into other sectors. That’s it. This is not for people who are tight on cash. It’s not a growth stock just income."

"My guess is 10-yr rates will be about 5% by end of 2022 - conservative estimate. There is a massive rebound occurring today in business activity, car traffic, air travel, etc. Just as there was a ""shock"" when literally the world shut-down a year ago, the opposite will happen. Then, throw in the ridiculous stimulus, easing monetary policy, etc. we are about to get an interest rate shock that will make the oil crisis of the 70s a blip. You can guess what this will do to stocks..."
one more question: who sold most of those $30 calls that expire today?
Earnings have been going down for the last 5 qtrs in a row and estimated earnings for this quarter make it down for 6 consecutive quarters. What does that tell you about the stock price?
"I want to believe in Big T, but the only way for me to figure this one is s to follow price."
"I am sure that everyone is speculating about the merger decision tomorrow? For me personally I started buying T 3 years ago before talks of a merger. I believed in AT&T then and I believen in them now. I reinvested all dividends since. My cost basis is $34.50....so I am down on share price but have 15,500 shares. So I guess what I'm saying is that if you truly believe in something solid like T, then you really should look at the big picture long term. It will only take a small rise in stock price for many investors to make thousands of dollars. Short term investors should really take a look at buying and holding in my opinion."
"Fox ""News"" ratings take a dive!"
"Hello divy chasers. Remember, Elliott went in there to try and right the ship. After spending some time there, they decided it's not fixable, and they bailed. Deaf, inept mgmt guilty of treason to their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders while stuffing their pockets. Meanwhile, index funds easily outperform by a ton. Last ATH was over 20 years ago and still on long term downtrend."
"I bout T a little over 6 months ago. I sell high, buy back low. I started at ~$31.50 APPS. Now I am at $27.06 and making bank off the divi. Increased my share total over 1k so far."
Usually takes a dive in the last hour. 15 minutes left
What will T stock look like next week ?
"If you sold call better start looking to see if you still have T shares LOL,LOL,LOL I will be taking all the shares before the dividend so I get the dividends LOL,LOL,LOL"

The rest of my portfolio will be for fun and life, but I don't think I will ever have to worry about food or taxes with my T Dividends every year."

Coumo covered up nursing homes deaths. Will CNN cover it and nail coumo on the cross?
selling hulu is a good thing. pay down debt and focus on Warner and HBO streaming

"My March $30 strike covered calls expire March 30. I doubt it will be called but if it is, they can have my shares. I expect the calls to expire worthless. The price of T common stock normally goes up right before the ex-dividend date around April 8. I plan on selling the shares when the dividend chasers push it up then and buy the shares back after the ex-dividend dategood luck"

At $30.50 I'll be 50K strong in T... Keep on rising!!!
"AT&T, my patience is running thin. Your balance sheet isn't anything to brag about despite an attractive dividend. HBO Max has too much competition and I am starting to think that a dividend cut is warranted. I will maintain my long position with hopes that the next few earnings reports show signs of life."
Excellent decision by AT&T given the low Interest Rates...Let's also realize they refinanced their debt at historically record lows. Very Bullish and see AT&T as a great Long-term Buy. I also believe HBO Max is an excellent asset and sets the bar!
This is over a $50 stock compare it with Verizon and TMobile this is a very strong company they should be $60 plus by now 5G will take them past $50 by April
T should spin off HBO. It has nothing to do with cell and their debt issues. It would be bigger if not just as big as nflx
Just added 500 shares @$29.25 glta 
Smart investors who had multiple gains last year will start to divert their money out of over-valued stocks (soon to be corrected) to a stable high dividend stock like T. T will have definitely a different stock chart behavior this year. (will reach $50 this year)
Hooray! Good chance I'll get called away on my 30 calls.
What a shame to be wasting a big up day like this. We need to make money on up days to cover losses on down days which will be coming.
I see it didn't take long for my covid infected migrant post to be removed
"Full Disclosure I/We own shares in AT&T. Our Analysts have a $42.00 price target Because of recent inquiries to firm we have a full disclosure available... We have a current target of $42.00 public records...Given the HBO Max and 5G, we will be able to give more information. On a Personal level  I enjoy being a part of the AT&T family as a Shareholder"
"ROFL! See told you, T always folds. After 1pm it will be even worse. So predictable."
AT&T the Leader in 5G and HBO Max is definitely going to propel AT&T higher.
1 month:T down .65%VZ down 4.92%TMobile down 9.10%
"Seriously, is there no better place to make money in this market other than T ? The dividend yield can get swallowed up in a days trading. As far as price appreciation is concerned, that’s not going to happen till the debt is repaid and there is some growth. Until then a 7.15% payout is all you can get."
"guys, don't bother me right now. watching The Investigation on hbomax and trying to contribute to growth in T's stock price."
CNN should blow more wind to keep Texas' windmills going again.
"Listen to them cry as T goes higher and higher LOL SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
I don't know why you're all so upset. T is doing just fine.
"AT&T was broken up by the government in 1984, Look it up if you don't believe."
7% yield baby
A dozen bobble heads.The bored of directors.
"Just saw the""little things"" on HBO Max last night. Good movie."
Inside day ? Gap fill? 
"Wow, what happened. It was way up before the market opened. Yikes! Sure glad I sold the Jan 29 $28.50 Puts rather than the $29's."
Dead money in VZ would actually buy more T . Today I discussed buying a sober living home . Long story but 3400 a month income is attractive
This stock continues to underperform. Time for the CEO to do something about the stock price.
"This is a BOOMER stock! Hey boomers! were in cannabis stocks like $TLRY, were in EVs like $CCIV and $NIO, were in OTCs like $LTNC, GET WITH THE PROGRAM YA OLD HAGS! ENJOY YOURE LITTLE DIVIDENDS! WERE GETTING RICH!!!!!!!"
T's 5G Monster is ALIVE and feeding
I see the rotation out of the high flyers. Investors with common sense are taking some profet and buying the laggards like T.....
"T is so underperformed. Hopefully, 2021 management will do better"
Give me $50 PPS AT&T...
"Argus maintains $38 target:Analyst's Notes""Analysis by Joseph #$%$ CFA, February 26, 2021ARGUS RATING: BUY? Reaffirming BUY and $38 target? AT&T has finally begun to divest DirecTV and other U.S. cable/satellite operations, which have been ameaningful and consistent drag on consolidated results.? While AT&T is paying a heavy price for its decision to enter the direct broadcast satellite business justas that business was declining, its deal with private equity firm TPG is one step toward improving itsfinancial profile.? AT&T will be able to retire some debt with the cash it will receive from the deal. We also expect apositive impact on margins and EBITDA growth, though there may be additional write-offs in the nearterm.? We are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate of $3.19 and our 2022 forecast of $3.25""."
T balance sheet is so lopsided with debt and goodwill this dog is going down.
First the NRA. Next the Trump Organization.
Don't you miss the $42 days?
"Shorting T to at least $25 is the way to go, AT&T downgraded at Oppenheimer after C-band auction results."
"All major indices turned Red, T's collapse will accelerate from here."
"DO YOU LIKE FREE MONEY? AT&T is the next Disney+.... by the end of the Summer, all new Theatrical Release Blockbusters will go through HBO MAX. Add onto that an amazing Dividend. ADD on to that Institutional INVESTORS interested in 5G like Warren Buffet in Verizon. $T is both a GROWTH & VALUE STOCK DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH"
is itvworth to even bother with this?? :/
"Dow down 1200 pts. in first wk. of Crooked joe on the job, wonder how far it will go down this wk. and thoughts !"
look at that pegged at $30!!
I still believe AT&T is a $60 stock and possibly higher than that. For now We have a great Safe Dividend. I do believe We will see $60... Now let me go to my drinking and I have a date night so I need to have a few beers and go to the pharmacy awaiting a refill on my Viagra. Date Night 
"I’m cracking, I’m cracking. But then again, I’m an old schooler!"
Apple revenues were down 4.5% and it’s up 7%. AT&T revenues were down 1.3% and it’s down 4%. Apple pays a dividend of 1.85% and AT&TPays a dividend of 6.65%.
"just touching a recent high. If we go above 32.39, you have to go back to Oct of last year to find these prices. Really feels like the narrative is changing from debt-laden co that is grasping at straws to stay competitive to modern media company that foresaw the changing landscape and is on the right path, debt reduction as a focus too."
Do you know what STLA is ? It is Stellantis. The NEW 4th car manufacturer on the planet and is about to start announcing good news. That’s where my money that I have in T is going today. I am done with this.
T wants to do something but appears to be low on energy. It needs a five-hour energy drink to get it through the day. At this pace so do I.S.L.
I think this stock is just waiting to crash down to $15-$17/share! It is just a matter of time and I am waiting to buy and capitalize on it!
Stock closed $28.80 let’s see how it closes today Monday on the opening drift purchases happen I wonder how high that will be what day is the best time to sell on the opening check it out￼￼￼

As long as the divi yield stays around 8% there's not much of a downside left.
"If you want in the 23 and me going public it's going to happen under VGAC and Wall Street SMACK the SPAC to shake out the weak hands today MAN the DEM wits are just giving away their shares , Wall Street scared the shares right out of them . LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Today Verizon has a market cap of 242b, T's cap is 218b...this is the biggest abstract as T has twice the assets of Verizon, 4x the amount of fiber in the ground, a satellite network and the largest media content library in the world.T will match Verizon in the 5G space at a minimum, they're fully invested to the future and the stock will shine in 2019 and then launch upward in 2020. Book it, bank on it...collect shares now while they're cheap...Asset value alone is huge and potentially a target by many..."
"T is up again, hmmm maybe the Godzilla vs King Kong movie reviews are coming in better than expected...lol"
"Hey guys, I’m new here. Merrill is showing $2.08 dividend. However, I read that T is giving $0.52 in dividends. What does that 2.08 mean on Merrill?"
AT&T is getting sued for 1.5 billion dollars. could not happen to a nice deserving company
This was at $45 before 5G was in picture this will be over $50 within 60 days
"Don’t worry, it will fade, it always does. Buying T before 1pm is a good way to lose half a dividend rofl"
Might be another tick coming in. Wait for it.
"Bullish on this stock for sure, the current valuation of AT&T given the assets owner by the firm is outrageously low. Given AT&T’s forward-looking strategy of diversifying into digital streaming through HBO. As the business grows and becomes a larger component of the firm’s revenues, we can expect a great valuation multiple on AT&T due to comparables like Netflix and Roku. Future outlook is strong."

"All of yesterdays gain gone. Sell the news just like I said. Earnings, Results etc.. are for the birds.. means nothing to the stock."

Must be T cheerleaders here. Been flat for years. Nothing going for this dog except dividend
"I sure hope T closes above $28.50 next Friday so I won't be forced to buy actual shares with the Puts I sold. I don't want to own this stock, I just want to sell monthly Puts. Right now the Feb 26 $28.50 Puts are selling for .69 each and the $29's for .92 each. That's by far the best way to make money with T."
Management needs to correct the perception problem T has. If you put the name Disney on this company the stock price would be double. Only management can change how the street views this company. It is time for the StankMeister to earn his pay and change T's image.
"T is turning into a platform company and away from a commoditized product company. This alone should double the ""PE"". Buying under $30 is a gift. $40+ in 2021."
This is real news the justice department is appealing but a judge has already approved the merger. I’m curious to find out the Basis

Well.....Timmmmmber Tuesday.......Woeful....Wednesday !
HBO Max is a gold mine
Incredible Buying Opportunity! Buy Buy Buy!!!!
The markets are at all time highs but where did T go? - down!! Earnings beat and it drops. What would happen if the market crashed 40 percent? Right! No doubt T would plunge to new 52 week lows!
"Dividend stocks are dead. Nobody wants a 2-3-5-7 % yield when growth stocks can make that in a day. T is a great company with good assets, but why pay a dividend when the balance sheet is disgusting? If the cut the dividend for a couple of years, pay down the debt and do buybacks, thanks to HBO and a clean balance sheet T could easily be a 350-400B company and THEN is when you pay a dividend. It's honestly pathetic how bad the dividend is hurting the company and limiting the potential of the company while seeing all the boomers in this chat room praise it. SAD!"

"Ex dividend is coming the week of April 5-9 2021 Get ready to say OH NO up T goes , Just place long term sell orders for all your shares for any higher price you want .

"Good game so far if you're a Tampa fan. I picked Tampa because I'll never bet against Brady again but I do believe the Chiefs will stage a comeback in the second half and the game will ultimately be decided by one or two make it or break it plays. If the Buc's defense can hold up against the Chiefs in the second half the Bucs will win, if they can't they'll lose. I'm just guessing, let's see if I'm right."
"P keeps moving higher I'll keep rolling the Covered Calls out further and to higher strikes to bring in more premium and to raise the strike price higher. You don't have to get your shares called if you don't want to. You can just keep rolling them further out and higher and bring in more money while you're doing it. And to answer another question that someone here is sure to ask. Yes, I will get the dividend for BP if I still own the stock on ex days even though I sold Covered Calls on the shares."
"If you can move your TSP to an IRA do it why you still can and before they change it so you can't .

Focas on Nokia. There is a good possibility ATT will purchase Nokia by this summer.
"if you think about it, an argument can be rationally made, that if the fears of corona virus becoming widespread in the U.S. were to materialize, that actually the services that T provides, where people can communicate /video conference/ text with each other, as well as entertain themselves , and use the internet for a variety of purposes without direct physical contact with other humans, such that T's business/ profits etc would increase , not decrease. then the stock moving down because of the fear of corona virus is not logical.I am not selling my shares, lol"
Does anyone see T as a recovery stock as we slowly come out of this pandemic?
Me thinks T will touch $30 again tomorrow... Will wait and see.
This stock is a CD. Why is anyone watching it everyday.
Touched $30 and couldn’t stand it. Back to $27-29.
I'm issuing a 60 target
Can't even get to 30 anymore before it is hammered lower. Even if HBOmax has a blowout quarter this stock is hated so much it won't make much difference. Hope I am wrong.
One step forward three steps back!
"Heres why the stock market won't go down more than 10%. The FED and its INFINITE cash will prop it up. In fact the FED right now is dumping billions into the markets by buying bonds. And if a crash happens the FED will buy Stocks directly like Japan. Ponzi Scheme on top of Ponzi Schemes. Thats what the U.S economy is all about.And the trick is to hide these ponzi schemes from everyday Joe Sixpack, which they are doing really well with rigged inflation reports and GDP reports and unemployment reports all designed to fool Joe Sixpack on the street.Thats what Harward and Ivy league schools are for, they teach you how to CON the little guy."
"cheetah, just simply say that in order to sell the puts you talked about that generated 7100 of profit for you that it required setting aside 280k in cash in your brokerage account. that's all. and then acknowledge that if the stock moves lower, you either have to close your short for potentially a loss, or that the stock could get put to you at a price higher than the market price i.e. another loss. i have no gripe w/ your strategy, it's just that you always only tell parts of the story. not cool."
We need an activist on Reddit to talk up T. T is being manipulated to stay low as it is heavily shorted.
"The good news, imo. They wrote down the carrying value of “video assets” by $15 billion. I don’t know what the carrying value of direct tv was but they paid $67 billion for it. So they evaluated the carrying value very recently and during supposed negotiations to sell all or part. THEREFORE, the current market value must be a LOT more than what is bandied around here. Does anybody agree, or are all here too stoopid to understand that."
I'm hope'n for a 'nice move' tomorrow!
Got the dip at $31.80
Spectrum results should be coming any day now. What if T came out on top?

T’s annual dividend is now 5.5 % or 270% higher than the 30 yr T-bond and 348% higher than the 10 yr T -bond (annual interest rate 2.06 and 1.58 respectively).
Even a day like this T can't move up only up .30 is a joke!

BRIEF-At&T Declares Quarterly Dividend On Common SharesBY Reuters— 2:58 PM ET 09/25/2020Sept 25 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T Loading... Loading... ):* AT&T DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON COMMON SHARES* SETS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.52PER SHARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:
"With recent announcements from Apple, and Disney, about streaming services to come online in the next year there is no chance T will lose the lawsuit."
Jobless claims nearly 1M. Time for the FED to print even more. YES!!Stock Market is UP UP AND AWAY.
"Short market day tomorrow. I think we close at 1:00 EST. Looking for a close above $28.50 for the Puts I sold to expire worthless. If it closes below $28.50 the stock will get ""put to me"" and I'll have to pay $28.50 for the shares. If that happens, I'll sell the shares on Monday, hopefully near, at or above $28.50.No problem if I have to take a few cents loss on the shares because I previously sold the Puts for .88 per share. I still want to be all Cash before the Jan 5 Georgia election in case the Democrats win and right now, with the Republican Senate turning down the $2000 Covid relief checks, they may just pyys enough Georgians off to screw up the election. If we end up with a Democratic President, House and Senate, I'll likely sit it out for awhile to see how things shake out but in my opinion, the market will drop big if the Dems win."
Will continue to add T every chance I get and hold 10 years min for the dividend alone!!!
"Revenue growth will come once people go to the movies again & there is a regular movie releases. Warner Brothers revenue declined 10% year-to-year due to loss of movie/ad revenue. Its simple math. Comps will be much easier going forward. In the meantime, HBO Max will appease investors. Very low-risk buy under $30."
Yay time for another fake Elliot bump to cash out at 34
"Hey AT&T fcvk bags.You have a couple of quarters left to make a dividend increase. No matter how small, you better keep that aristocrat status.You do not need another negative headline."
100 buck bet closes below 30...any takers?
Cheetah is a hedgie trash talking T for his own trading purposes spreading disinformation.
How is it that there is a chip shortage. Its not as if the car industry is booming because of covid. hmmm.... something is not right here.
The only people who should be holding T are retired or dividend investors. This stock will never budge from 25-35
"Look at the price movements T holders.Says all you need to know. More low, lows ahead!"
"Big advertising revenue for March Madness. TruTV, TBS, TNT all owned by AT&T. Games being shown on all those channels. That was completely missing last year."
"I'm going to cut my T position by 80%I feel that the stock will drop to around ~$27.80 before it reaches $30.00I might be right, I might be wrong but I don't like the fact that T are in $190B debt and continuing to take on more debt.Definetly a solid company but I'll buy back in I deem the price fair for me."
Could it be that word is finally leaking about HBO Max subscribers beating expectations by a good amount? Me thinks something's up...
Won’t be long before smaller companies like Zoom etc will pass T’s market cap and can leverage share price to possibly acquire T ...T’s management hasn’t a clue as other dynamic companies are passing them by.
Breakout for T is at $29.23. Resistance at $30.08.
I like $T. It’s not perfect. But I like it. Trading at a lower multiple than T Mobile and Verizon. Trading at a far lower multiple than all streamers. They have critical infrastructure impossible to replicate. They have a jewel in the media landscape. A bit of reversion to the mean and a bit of growth sends this on its way to 50.

"So Phil, is the attack on Cuomo still a political hit job? Hard to keep up w when to believe the woman. Oh, right when she accuses someone u don’t like."
"T-Mobile CEO all over CNBC and the talk shows, trashing T. Meanwhile, Stankey hides and does nothing to promote the company and stock.

"The U.S is a country with a younger population, now that covid has taken care of the 65+ old people. Don't want those people around being a burden to the health system."
T is under quiet accumulation. Short term target (1-2 months) - $36. Longer term target (by year-end) - $39.
"HBO MAX launching in all Latin America in June then launching in Portugal,Central Europe, Spain and the Nordics later this year can give a huge push to their subscribers"
"Here's what I don't get. I understand the concern about the size of the national debt but Congress spends so much money on things like museums and loans to other countries yet they can't spend another $1400 on every American who is suffering because the government won't let them get back to work. And at the same time every Congressman is still getting paid, living in their plush houses and not worrying about how they're going to buy food for their family next week. And now Cuomo and DeBlasio are bickering about who should get the virus shots which is delaying the distribution of the serum. Is it any wonder why people are so upset about things?"
"stock looking for four up days in a row,can it happen? problem is down day and selling comes in late everyday. I smell something cooking!"
Down premarket! Of course. Dead money!

"This is probably the last window to pick up T sub-$30. It's been trading at generational lows for a year. I feel fortunate to have picked up shares at $27 and $28.50 a few weeks back, and preferred T-PA last week."

"If Bitcoin could be $30,000 and its just air which pays nothing, then IMO T could be $50+ cause its something and pays 7%."
"i made a screenshot, T is green. Miracles do exist."
Don’t look now but there are real buyers in this market and they seem to be concentrating on telephone and rightfully so we can only expect good news if we have A good market we will be breaking 30 soon. And we could all say it’s about time￼￼￼
"FYI.........copy and paste this in your search engine...........AT&T: The Most Important Question, For Now"
"So many people here probably trading with like 500 dollars trying to move the needle on a massive company like at&t with their little yahoofinance comments. Institutional investors trading billions that make well thought out decisions, none of which include reading the yahoofinance comment section is what changes the price. Learn that."
28.50 is close to a floor....unless a major market sell off occurs

Business is down in Slovakia. Time to panic.
Looks like the DEMS are ahead in Georgia. They could win and $2000 will fall from the trees next month.
"I'm a shareholder but I've got to say AT&T has the worst customer service and Loyalty Department I've ever run into:Been a loyal customer as long as I can remember and I approached them in December for 10MBPS internet service from my existing 6mbps. I wanted to try streaming TV to save some money. They agreed to a loyal customer price of $40 for the first year after which it would raise to $60. Since then my bill has been $49 and I have contacted them monthly with out email written agreement. Today contacted again and was pushed up to a manager. Then to the loyalty department and was finally to they could give me the $40 monthly but would have to downgrade me to 6mbps. That was that. I know $9 isn't much but it is the fact that they told me what I would get for a set amount and didn't live up to it. I'm retired and live on fixed income so try to be a frugal as possible. I don't throw my money away. I also stand by my word. They don't. They don't have to. I did tell them I finally understand why the DOJ was pushing against the merger. They are not the old AT&T I once knew. I paid the $49 immediately but will be looking to find a new provider after my scheduled heart surgery (aortic valve replacement, aortic aneurysm repair and bypass)"

We always get hyped up over tiny gains that follow with big losses. I’m tired of it. Div doesn’t offset
"The big question for me is how safe is the dividend. I am a 7 year T long and obviously not happy about the price of the stock, but certainly happy about the DIV and thinking of adding more T now at these prices..."
"Cheetah, just looking at others in there space and their market caps compared to T’s over the past few years.The numbers don’t lie...They’re looking at T in the rear view waving see ya!"
We better do something right. Dividend is nice but I wonder what Musk is going to do with all those satellites  he’s putting up  into space. I think he will be coming after our type of business or at least competing with use. We will see.5 year's I say for the time period.GL
"Cramer just said buy Verizon and DIS.... AT&T is a ""bit dicey"" @9:38 EST"
"GG owns Berkshire. A shares. So I read. This is what the old man wrote this year:""Recently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based property, plant and equipment – the sort of assets that make up the “business infrastructure” of our country – with a GAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by any other U.S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these domestic “fixed assets” is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127 billion.""As Buffett said, that fact alone is not an investment triumph. But the replacement costs here are fairly high."
hopefully good news on earnings front. don't want to see a hit like VZ got today
"take advantage of the dips in T and make sure to pick up a few more shares the next great run higher has started it will be slow and take time but you will get paid very well to wait in dividends . That run to $65 is in play this time and the break out to all time highs , Why because T has made the changes to the company to make it a much better company in the future and the 5G monster T has built is going to grow again"

Another red day. Again.
"can you buy T today, get the dividend, and then sell (in a ROTH account?"
at&t must be the most shorted stock their is beats it goes down gets a upgrade it goes down.Can someone explain this to me?

Price appreciation awaits economic recovery which cannot happen until covid is shut down for good. 20%+ of population would get the vaccine for foolish reasons.Solution: Put the vaccine in their moonshine and they'll get immunity without knowing it!
"AT&T Inc. (T) stock fell 26% in 2020, closing the year within 22 cents of the last price traded in December 2018. Of course, the perennial laggard AT&T is a special case, saddled with years of debt accumulated by poorly executed purchases that include 2015's disastrous DirecTV acquisition. The company also overpaid for Time Warner in 2016, but that bet could eventually pay off, with the new HBOMax streaming service growing at a healthy pace."
Ah ha... Final closing price $29 just as I predicted.
Looks like we open above 30. Will it hold??
IF T could stay flat at 30 just not go under 30 don't believe anybody would really care if itgoes higher or not30+ safe dividend in this market? ok with me
Ronald MUTED!
"ATT'S reputation is tarnished.For a company to have played a part in the demise of a presidency, there are investors that don't want to invest in a company that has an alternate philosophy.I, for one, have a problem understanding just what this company is about?"
5 million shares in 10 minutes!
WOW that was good and it shows T now has a future as T's 5G Monster now grows WOW
only news is t spending multiple millions to build and upgrade network for wireless.... patience will reap huge upside

"Why is Roku stock so high? I don't know much about the stock I admit, but it seems overpriced considering how it only sells one type of product."
"I am investing on this beast, it’s a money machine , just needs to cuts cost and wow, a $500 dollar stock"
what makes little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff 123456789 is when T shares trade down.....he is an admitted SHORT and plays the options on margin with other shareholders shares....try and see who is the FRAUD
"Well, well, well. Red on a green day. Again. What a surprise."
Why the hell is Randall Stephenson still on the books? As a consultant no less?Another million down the toilet.
Didn’t hold 30 (off by 20 cents or so) but the swoon and “weak hands” have gone missing. The swoon turned into a divot
"HBOMAX Value has been doing well for months now. T did not, and has not participated."
this merger is putting t into the drivers seat. so many great things they can do and they dont need to depend on anyone else as they just got dealt a great hand that will win big time. all the other companies now got to figure out what they need to do to stay relevant.
"T is the best and most predictable stock to trade. In the first 27 trading this year, I have increased my share count by 159 free shares. These shares are only from selling T high and buying back in the same day at a lower price. Hence adding an ave 5.88 shares a day to my total. I have increased my yield from 7.67% to 8.26% already this year. Lowered my AVE PPS from $27.10 to $25.18."

AT&T stock price will be based on new wireless users and video streaming customer base increase.

I’m tied up tomorrow. Will check back in later in the week. I will be adding. Good luck to all longs.
AT&T would have hard time selling ice to someone in you know where.
One thing you can ALWAYS count on is T underperforming. Only a hack dividend investor would buy this.
If ATT cut the dividend to zero and used the $15Billion per year that they pay for dividends to buyback stock shareholder value would increase. Some of the people that hold the stock for dividends would sell but T could buy those shares. Other investors that want growth would buy T just like they buy TMUS with zero dividend. I can't help thinking that $15B per year could be the thing that is holding ATT back along with 7.1 billion outstanding shares. What would happen to TMUS if they declared a 7.3% dividend? Most of the thumbs down will come from short sellers because they do not like large buybacks.
It's a Dividend play. Buying Opportunity and very undervalued. Strong Buy with a $41.00 price target. We feel it's a good place to put your $ to work.
"Tesla goes up and down $1 every 3 seconds. When T does it, it feels like a miracle has just occurred."
I am listening to my analysts who feel it's going higher so that being said it's a Buy and Hold.
T stock is in a strong downward trend. Question is how low can low get? I figure the stock just went ex-dividend and due to historic trends should hit a bottom around late March excluding any of the numerous other factors that may come into play.
Say goodbye to 30 calls.
AT&T added 4M HBO streaming subs. Disney added 21M. Let that sink in. Why is Stankey still around?
Don't get too excited. This is not a huge catalyst for AT&T. They will remain a majority owner of DTV.
"T will go back up to $40 regardless of the Time Warner decision. If AT&T gets approval, it will be very exciting and hopes for great synergies and growth potential will be injected into the stock. If AT&T loses.......Then Stephenson will be fired or will resign, and hopes for fresh new leadership will be injected into the stock. This is a win-win situation. :-)"
"I am not looking for desired effects as morningstar would put it. We are looking for the ""Wow"" factor........T needs to do more marketing to attract more people to HBOMAX! They missed the ball on Wonderman, they should have more than tripled on such movie! They are doing the same exact mistake with the new Denzel Washington Movie! They need to advertise the new Games of Thrones show aggressively! They own an bunch of channels, it should cost much, I understand losing some advertising dollars will payoff GREAT DIVIDENDS to the Company longer term. Someone, Please speak to the board and Management of such mistakes. I also believe AT&T box, can kill Roku and replace DTV! This company has too much potential and great opportunities but they are scared to make moves! Look at DIS, they took very bold moves and were successful, I have no doubt this can be even a getter success, if they just simply execute more boldly and not worry. until management gets it act straight, just keep collecting dividends."
Wanna hear some great news? There is another round of 5G bandwidth auction coming. lol
This is the safest play out there when the market comes crashing down
Usually add under $29 but w spectrum auction and fact position has grown as % of portfolio has me hesitating
Boat anchor of a dividend dragging T down again. To bad the retirees wont let T compete as DIS and NFLX (neither pay a penny in divs) rockets to all time highs with tons of new content for streaming. They wont be around in 5-10 years so they got to bleed T dry while they can. Greedy old people. Good Riddance
I just rolled the Jan 29 Puts I previously sold on three other stocks I'm trading to the Feb 26's and picked up another bundle of cash. They all report earnings next week like T and I'd like to avoid that minefield. Unfortunately the Jan 29 T Puts that I sold aren't in position to do the same as of yet. Hopefully the spread will widen before the ER next Wednesday and I'll be able to roll them forward for another good profit. Keeping an eye on it but we'll see what happens.
"T will be Ok in 2021-2022 then Covid will be hold by vaccine & world will breath Now dividends + buy more on low price (P/B Ratio 1.1, good)I have 3227 stocks"
"Story about AT&T. Wife worked for SW Bell back in 1989 stock was $99. Company had given her 7 shares before she was laid off 2 years after starting. Merger of ""Baby Bells"" SW and AT&T stock split 2 for 1 now $45 then back up to $99. She remember 3 splits. Held those shares still today. Now she has 1000 shares and gets $2300 year dividends reinvested the dividends all these years into repurchase toward shares and has never touched any. I just bought 1000 more shares yesterday since it will start substituting our retirement starting next month..Even though splitting seems to be a thing of the past these days it was golden for her. Oh and she had 2 years of College paid for upon layoff..... went back to school got her degree and had a successful 30 year career as a programmer..True story.... moral is .... AT&T solid company."
Will today be the day we retake the 29 level?
Look at the hit the market is taking today!
This looks to be a good buy at $28.33 and a good sell at $28.83
Don’t sell hold it for a week will go over $33
"The talks about breaking up Ma bell were first presented to AT&T in 1982 by the government. There was only one phone co. before that, and they use to take care of all your phone needs. If your phone broke down they would replace it free of charge. You new people know nothing of how it was. Then the government got their hands in, and everything started to get screwed up."
"Despite the 15 billion write down, DirecTV still has 17.2 million customers and revenue of 7.2 billion for the quarter. (about 1/6th of AT&T's total revenue) Also when you write down an asset it improves the earnings in subsequent quarters because of less depreciation and amorization expense on that asset."
Is this the company that owns the most reliable name in fake news?
What a......lol
Worst Stock on Earth will continue to go downhill to below $20. Very Bearish outlook ahead.
"Back to $28 this bum goes, T is a disaster."
"Does ATT'S board, (13 members), hold virtual meetings?My guess is probably NOT!"
They’re un relentless racism alone is enough to sell this un American company.
"more T bad news:“ There are risks involved with investing in AT&T. The company has accumulated a ton of debt attempting to turn itself into an entertainment giant. That strategy hasn't exactly been a home run. AT&T had $153 billion of debt at the end of the third quarter, and it's been losing premium TV subscribers at an alarming pace. The company has been trying to sell DIRECTV, which it acquired in 2015 for $49 billion, but bids so far are reportedly around $15 billion.”"
"I just read a post from motley throwing in the towel on T.. I agree that while T is servicing the debt, it probably won't see any big moves up. However, I do think that present management is moving in the right direction.. So let see, I throw in the towel because T is not moving up fast enough, I lose the 7+ div and I need to find another investment to replace it with that hasn't already shot up so high it's ready to pop, not an easy thing to do at this time. I'm going to stay long with T ...."
Stock market will continue to grow as long as interest rates stay low.... Stocks will get slammed to the ground within one second after the interest rate is raised... Goldman Sachs will push the sell button and computerized trading will wipe out 10 years worth of gains... You won't have a chance to react..
Don’t sell your stock cheap! Thanks @R
another week of opex manipulation by wall st!!!
"the dividend will get cut. There are great dividend stocks out there, this isn't one of them."
T is a growth stock! Once USA economy recovers from Pandemic T in 30's all the time. Earnings January 26th should be interesting. Divided payment .52 February 1st! Long T!!!
Feels like I’m waiting for the end of day sell off. Hope we can close green.
you never lose value of spectrum when it is used for 5g..... this is a money maker deal... increased revenue!!! 26 billion in cashflow.... they can use dividend cash to pay or DTV sale and loses to offset the gains.. its all a tax game at this point...hoard the loses until taxes go up!! no brainer.... earnings will be up
Shorts Must Really Be Feeling a Squeeze For Them To Post All This Negative Post;) Happy I Loaded Up;)
"The FACT is T has built a Monster that is now taking customers from both T Mobile and VZ, plus VZ is even running off customers even faster with their EU one world order Yahoo censoring Natzi's The FACT is T is a totally new and different company that no one company can compete with. Both VZ and T Mobile are playing the spectrum game which is a Commodities business which is just going lower and lower in price , T is now leveraging it's assets to drive margins and that is a game that only T can play , The FACT is the Government let T build a monster that no one company can compete with in the new world they all face. LOL,LOL,LOL"
T is brilliant! CNN is positioned to become the main propaganda machine for the Harris administration! Think of the money!
"T is a sell,,,,within one year this company will take the largest write off in accounting history relating to Time Warner. Vertical integration never works ie trying to sell a product ie HBO through ATT's distribution system,-Lets face it a telephone executive as a ""creative"" entertainment manager HUH!Other industries where vertical integration HASN""T WORKED-Pharmaceutical Industry- production of generic drugs-Banking- mortgage banking and consumer finance-Salesforce- acquiring services peripheral to its central mission ""Slack""-General Electric- Financial services and oil drilling-Verizon-Yahoo-Goldman Sachs and ""marcus"" consumer finance division ,,,,the Marcus CEO just quit.Expect Time Warner to be spun out to shareholders in 2022.Good luck shareholders-"
"no way would i hold anything in this environment.no f'n way!not with all this debt!!cash out, go into ""dont lose"" mode"
AT&T's CNN should consult Project Veritas for lessons on how to become journalists.
"Own T don't trade it by more now on any DIPS. Have that dividend locked in as T goes higher and higher . Started buying IPOE which is taking SoFi public in April 2021, was almost $30 and now dropped to the point to start picking up shares and locking them up with long term sell orders over $100 to start. Massive upside in the future as it takes business from all the large Banks . The new world of Banking SoFi Number 8 on the list of major disrupters"
do i get dividend if i sell right now?

"Motley Comments:Management expects to exit 2020, a year hindered by the pandemic, producing $26 billion in free cash flow. Despite the 7.3% yield -- or $0.52 per share per quarter -- the free cash flow payout ratio is only 58%. Yellow flags are flying after the company didn't raise the dividend in the first quarter for the first time since 2003, but Stankey reiterated on the latest earnings call that there was plenty of cash for investments in capital and content, paying down debt, and maintaining the dividend. Increasing the payout isn't off the table either. As long as management raises the dividend by the fourth quarter the streak of consecutive yearly increases will grow to 37 years, maintaining its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. If management can stay on plan, the payout will likely rise and the stock is a buy at the current price."
"cheetah and others.....when you talk about your naked call and put selling, (i assume it's naked b/c you never talk about buying or shorting the stock to protect), why don't you talk about the margin requirements aka the buying power restrictions that result in your account. Another reason i presume you're naked is you don't talk about how your stock got called away or got put to you. So you're always right?? Lastly, if you are naked, you should talk about the likely very small positions you're taking since they're tying up so much buying power in your account. Because while I don't begrudge or judge anyone for making money w/ a certain strategy, I think you mislead non-practicioners of options trading."
Luckily I am at a level and cost average that I do not care for this to churn for a while as I DRIP to accumulate even more (to shed a chunk at a future spike)My free-ed up funds have allowed me to make instant bank on several other runners lately. I feel bad for the ones stuck with overweight shares and/or a high cost averageHope you guys get to a “inner peace” level soon so you can focus on growth options as well.
T will be going sky high soon. When all the lazy American workers are laid off from T mobility and good peoples are brought in on H1B1. This improve T bottom line greatly. Me be laughing so much about this.
Gone MUTED!
Value stocks in favor! Go T!
"Who was it who said he was thinking of selling his higher priced shares earlier and someone else said ""I wouldn't"" Maybe he should have huh? Or at last sold covered calls against those shares. To let thattype of situation pass without taking any advantage of it is almost a sin. I took advantage of the moment by buying the Puts I sold back cheap and I'm going to sell them again when the stock drops lower again."
Janet Yellen: Please pump some money into T; it needs it. I will be getting $3k of so-called Covid Relief that I really don't need.
"The last time T hit 30 was January 7th. If T breaks 30 next week, the big question is can T hold above thirty. There has been a rotation from the highly speculative stocks in tech, alt. energy, and biotech into ""old"" economy stocks with dividends. Let's see if this trend continues."
"I never liked T service, they have #$%$ cellphone plans and no FIOS plans or anything looking to the future. Directv is really dumb when fiber offers 1 Gbit service. We would still be using rotary phones if they had their way. They are not a monopoly anymore, they need to compete. The PUT/CALL ratio shows traders are not optimistic, the dividend protects the stock from moving very fast.Somebody tell me why this company should exist in 10 years."
We’re up a nickel in premarket. We’re on a roll.
"The price action of T is very curious. Talk about steady, not even slow and steady as that would require upward movement of some sort. In a time of heavy volatility this stock has traded in a .50 range since the start of the year for over the past 30 days. I guess this would be called building a base?"
I owned this stock for over 30 years and keep asking why.
I ever tell you all that I love making money off of T. I sold high and bought back in low this morning while picking up a few extra shares. On those shares I am currently up $.55 a share
This is a 40$ stock
Train has left the station. T will no longer test the low. Good news will begin with next quarter HBO Max subs and continue throughout the year. 2021 is year of T
"OFFICIAL ATT STATEMENT on Friday evening ...We’re putting the full-force of our disaster recovery efforts into responding to this morning’s explosion in Nashville, including bringing in regional resources and our National Disaster Recovery teams.Power is essential to restoring wireless and wireline communications and we are working with law enforcement to get access to our equipment and make needed repairs. Given the damage to our facility it will take time to restore service. We have already rerouted significant traffic from this facility and are bringing in other equipment, including numerous portable cell sites to the area.There are serious logistical challenges to working in a disaster area and we will make measurable progress in the hours and days ahead. We're grateful for the work of law enforcement as they investigate this event while enabling us to restore service for our customers.We'll continue to provide updates here as our recovery progresses."
Keep those dividends coming !
"Here is the math. EBITDA $65B less capex 21, less dividends $14 less income tax 5, less interest 8equals $17B of discretionary cash flow that will pay down debt and thus reduce interest. That gets you to $163B of debt at end of 2019 and a 2.5 EBITDA to Debt ratio. That will provide for dividend increases and stock buybacks. Stock is a solid buy."
"omg, it is fading. Will probably finish red yet again."
"William has been escorted to my MUTED Waiting Room. Eric, Spartan, and Cheetah are already there."
It would build confidence in the investors if the upper management started massive refi of it's 150 billion in debt. Better to do this now when the rates are low... and there are lenders that have liquidity to help.
Why would they release such awesome news when markets close at the end of the week should be going over $31 bucks tomo
T making a come back already?
go big red
Announcement says dividend is now .51 great news for us Longs !!!
Got in 800 shares 28.54 downside risk very minimal. Had to get in before ex dividend. Will hold this for a while.
"Big picture, is start selling and raise cash on all the stocks that don't pay a dividend to start. Raise the cash for the slaughter that is now coming"
Last time I bought in before earnings T was a surprise and went to $38. I got that vibe now and got a position.
CNN does it again.The Impeachment - Part 2Reminds me of a story that's over 2 thousands years old.Except this time the Temple has a dome on it.
Smart move on T getting out ahead with stopping donations to all parties who were trying to undermine our election process.When the Country stabilizes so will stock prices.Rule of Law is important
ATT has the worst customer service. Period. I will never EVER do business with them again.
Stock should be trading at $45 based on relative PE & cash flow metrics.
@phil the T chart looks strong like the liner in your maxi pads
I was losing hope in hbo but their upcoming lineup of original series is fire!! Subs will be rushing it like they rushing the ps5
ATT options are unusually active today.
The Last Fiscal Conservative MUTED!

way to go BIG RED another banner day lol
get rid of CNN!!!!
it's hard to focus on dull T news. my eyes keep drifting over to GME and AMC. now that's entertainment
Going to 27.5 with the market selloff. Will buy at that price. That’ll be the bottom in my opinion. Depends on how the markets perform (selloff or crash)
"People complain that there is not enough intelligent exchange of ideas on the board, but that is because the Yhoo screeners are not smart enough to separate fact from fiction, and end up removing completely legitimate posts."

29.50 is the next battle line to crush.
Nuts... Figures I buy at a peak ($29.29). Now I'm a bagholder on 30 of my 1031 shares.
This will break out back to $40 it’s a high $30s stock

This would be the third green day in a row. That's called a winning streak.
"Be greedy when others are fearful T is priced at same level as 10yrs ago.....great dividend with more upside than downside.....HBO subscriber growth, 5G super cycle and share buybacks are all likely catalysts.....but even if it stays flat the divi pays you to wait,,,,equity bond!"
"With Dividend, Daddy's Buying!!!!"
Can anyone remove this magic spell on T? What kind of magic could freezzze the share price at this level permanently..... The volatility is probably less than the 10 year T-bill.
"Next will be the upgrade to $34 then $36 and on up to $38 as the T 5G monster starts feeding on it competition and grows LOL,LOL,LOL SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
I likey! That Roth is going to be nice in 16 years...
"macd crossed the signal line on friday and went positive today. also, if it closes above 29.91 it will have broken above about a three mo trading range. i have been faked out by positive chart developments w/ T before, so by no means is this me suggesting these are screaming buy signals. but we are also leading into investor day. it could be setting up for a move, positively positioned and some of the reopening trends (movies) are helping. fingers crossed."
Verizon and ATT invested about $45B and $23B in auction. Has anyone read anything about what kind of return on investment this could produce? Is TMUS ahead of T and VZ in spectrum?
"All the T haters better learn to say OH NO up T goes , Why because T's 5G monster is ALIVE and feeding on the competition LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
Now is the time to buy..... anything but T.
"Just Wall Street ""Lunch Talk"" is AT&T going to $50 with HBO Max and 5G? Maybe $35 but let's keep in a trading range. Everyone on board say it with your beer mugs and wine glasses."
"There are likely two reasons for T to increase:- Yield 7+% (people are now looking at yield, since the move of the 10 year bonds)- Buffet bought into the competitor (to my opinion with worse chart structure and fundamentals)There was bad decision making of T in the past, and it could occure again in the future. But they have certain parts of the business growing that will catch more investors attention over time.That being said: 28.50 USD (good buy) - 27.50+ USD very nice buy - sub 27.00 USD great buy.Just my opinion. I hold shares of T in a portfolio I manage for my partner."
My Disney stock crushed it on earnings for their streaming. Weird thing is it sucks compared to HBO Max....The guidance will be interesting. Tick Tock .....Let's see.
When will it surpass $31.20? Anyone hazard a guess?
"T is not a growth stock, it's an income stock. You buy 100 shares and earn $200 in dividends annually. Full stop."
Has anyone ever seen a company with a dividend rate of return higher than its PE?
Congrats you guys threw away $30 Billion and expect the stock to move up because you acknowledge this publicly now ?
"CLNE~~partners with Chevron, BP, TOTAL. Contracts with New York MTA/Sanitation. FedX, UPS. Canada and USA."
WHOW! Ts on a ROLL!! !!
"They can spend all the money they want on 5g, won’t matter. T is like NOK, a has been. It’s a good stock, if you like losing money."
"Just be glad you don't own VZ because VZ is now losing customers to T by the 1000's everyday WOW VZ is now setting a new record daily of how many customers VZ can lose to T LOL,LOL,LOL Look at all the new T customers we got this weekend WOW"
Those who have held T.....sorry you missed the best bull market in a half a century...I guess you will catch the next bull market...any day now any day....
"I just resold the Feb 26 $29 Puts I bought back yesterday for .17 each but I decided to sell the March 5 $29's instead for a little more premium. Sold the March 5 $29's for .38 each. That's a quick $2100 bucks in ONE day. If the stock closes above $29 on March 5th those Puts will expire worthless and I'll start all over. I'll be selling the March 26 $29's next which are currently going for .70 each. If the pricing keeps dropping towards $29, the March 26 $29 strike premiums will increase in price. And that's how you do it!"
There will be a big push to unlock the stocks value within 6 months. Right now it's best to split out growth because of the crazy valuations vs dividend stocks. We even see the Euro stocks like Mercedes and VW considering ipo's for faster growing divisions. T will have no choice but to spin out HBO at some point as HBO is worth $0 as part of T and $100B on its own.
I'm not finding any news?? for the jump?
Dems will stimulus and spend to accelerate economy to sidetrack u from paying attn while they up your taxes.
Looking good here folks. Watching closely.  today might be the day
c n n finally talking about gov cuomo......he belongs in the chinese govt.....with the rest of the liars
"Wow, look at that BP go!! I'd expect some profit taking to hit the stock soon. This has been a straight up ride and nothing goes straight up forever."
Out of this and got GM.
So I guess these people who are selling and the analysts downgrading the stock wanted AT&T to fall behind in the 5G race? They are all idiots. AT&T HAD TO take away a good portion of that spectrum and they did just that.
Got that divy though.....better off in dirty energy me thinks  Little know fact - The main ingredient in Solar panels is lots and lots of COAL ! 
For that are long T just make sure you have place long term sell orders for all your shares at over $60 to start or any higher price you want for your shares. That way it sends a message to the shorts that they can not get your shares so cheap and if by chance your shares have been lent out and shorted your broker will either have to find shares for you or be forced to recall the shares

Looks like Direct TV sale is going nowhere.The hole is getting wider and deeper.
Thumbs Up if you think T is going to hit $32 before it drops under $30 again or Thumbs Down if you think it's going to drop under $30 again before it hits $32.
Early Christmas present for my son. 300 Shares of T.
 I was just told that AT&T will beat the dropping cable viewership numbers by going into streaming big time. For the first time in history AT&T will own the content and also own how the content will be distributed. DOUBLE WAMMIE!
MIKE MIKE MIKE get a grip.
Am happy with the numbers.
"ATT will be $28 per share 100 years from now... It's like a giant slop bucket for pigs in $10,000 suits..."
Universal Basic Income is a necessity now that the Dems are in charge. Its our money anyways not the Politicians.
Dividend is in jeopardy!
Who are these experts on this board berating people that are long on T? Ranting about how clueless we are for not investing in growth stocks. They don't understand that our portfolios and reasons are diverse. Most of us probably made money on the high fliers and want to put profits where we can generate dividends at a decent rate. T is a minor part of my portfolio and well worth the risk at the price point I was able to buy in at.
"""AT&T is expected to generate ""more than enough free cash flow to cover its upcoming C-Band commitments; 2) keep leverage in check; and 3) maintain the dividend at or above the current level."" C-Band is spectrum to be used for 5G applications."
E-MATRIX MUTED!
"NEVER EVER do any business with a company like AT&T that is willing to take away your right. AT&T has become a Communist company under Han's and his EU one world order CENSORING NATZI's that censor what you can see, read and post. That is about as un-American as it can get."
Boy if I was a shareholder right now I'd be selling March 26 $30 Covered Calls. They're currently selling for .68 each.
This is where you add to your position. Not a lot in case it keeps going down. But a little that way you don't feel as bad about the bags your holding at a higher price. If you don't buy on down days you will hold lots of bags. It hurts seeing money evaporate with the share price. It is a little comforting that the trade volume isn't much higher than usual.
$31 close mark my words
It's like buying T in 1997. Same stock price. Extremely stable Bond like stock.
"The dividend yield on this will be 8% before it is over, it's a train wreck."
"At 2pm, someone dumped over 1 million shares for some tax loss selling. That will end in a few days and the pressure will be off. This will be a nice stock to own for 2021"

"@R so @R went from being a ""Financial Genius"" to an ""Accountant"" then a ""CPA"" telling everyone in Government to sell their TPA shares. Then he comes out now blaming conservatism on Verizon. Now he says Verizon is a ran by a third world country. This guy should be avoided at all costs! His daily lies over on Verizon. Just b/c we have the best Network and his stock never goes ""UP UP UP"" like he says repeatedly throughout the day. His 2000 shares of ""Grandma's Trust Fund"" isn't getting him anywhere. Right, SON!?!"

"1600 shares purchased, first time buyer of T. The recent div increase, 3 upgrades in last 2 weeks (JP Morgan, Citigroup, Cowan) and good price point."
"Just how did things get so bad for T? It wasn't all that long ago that T and VZ were almost at the same price in the 40's. Since then, T has fallen down to sub 30 and VZ up up near 60. How does this even make sense? T has way more assets and things going on than VZ. The only conclusion I can come up with is that leadership matters, and the market has absolutely no faith whatsoever in the leadership of T. RANDALL MUST GO!"
I think that it is a matter of time for WBS to come visit since this is a legit hedging for the upcoming turbulent market. Have a strong support at 28 and a high dividend payout.
"The world is so convoluted by humans, I am surprised that we are still around and haven't destroyed ourselves completely."
"T earnings. 4th quarter results on Jan 27th. Expected EPS is $0.73. Prior quarters reported EPS were $0.76, $0.83, $0.84, $0.89. Has been a steady decline in EPS. Revenue also declining. This may explain why majority consensus ""hold"" rating for T and why in a trading range."
"Assuming T ~ dividends are safe but debt increases, spending, and let’s not forget COVID issues, argument over stock buy back could decrease"
Would have been nice to see that gap get filled. Maybe some income seeking funds buy some Monday. I truly feel for y’all on this one. It’s clear cheetah has the best strategy with this stock.

I Strongly oppose selling any part of Direct TV....HBO Max is great but I like and so do my family and friends Direct TV. It's better than streaming and and I do both. If I were on the BOD I would not sell a stake in Direct TV.....It's a valuable asset to AT&T. As a shareholder I have expressed this to Mr Stanley. I'm bullish on AT&T but don't think We should give up on Direct TV.
Half a divy lost today.
"So now the new Pres. is going to give Latin America $4 billion bucks to ""make life better there"" to discourage more migration across the border. What do you suppose are the chances that the $4 billion winds up in the hands of the drug cartels? Hmmmmm, wonder if our new Pres. thought of that."
Tax loss selling to offset gains while this is at lows makes perfect sense... then buy back the shares to regain profits net year...
Added at 28.95. Always down more than dividend. Like clockwork.
My apologies to the late Fred Gwynn for comparing him to John D student Kerry.
T is down 4.3% in the last 6 months. ROKU is up over 200% in the last 6 months. That illustrates opportunity cost.
"Listen to the longs whine! LOL Aren't some of you whiners the same guys who keep saying, ""I bought T for the dividend and I'm going to hold forever. I don't care what the price does"". So what are you people whining about? This is what the price does! LOL"
Voice is free.... Which part of free is confusing?
"assuming the Trump news regarding increasing of tariffs hits the markets hard tomorrow and causes a sell off in T shares, I am planning to look at buying T shares. First of all, T's businesses are shielded from the tariff wars, secondly its bondlike status will help it as yields drop in a flight to quality of the risk off type of market dynamic. Thirdly, I expect that this is just Trump's hard negotiating tactic and will ultimately give way to a deal being struck. If T sells off , it will likely be a good trading entry point. See, I can be selectively bullish on T...……."
Shall we say $29.96 close?
DOW is lower than the close on Dec 31. Not sure what the big fuss is all about with the back and forth nonsense of it shooting up vs T
"The only time T leaves $28/share is when it goes into the $27s,"
Can somebody tell me why AT&T is giving virtually free service to Illegal immigrants? That's unbelievable! And funnier is the homeless people actually just claim homeless for EBT and free stuff and living in Southern California driving Cadillac Escalades and have 5 vehicles and 8 kids fat. AT&T better wise up.
"Periodic Reminder...All things Motley Fool should be ignored. They create hate and fear articles to attract ""clicks"" for which they are paid. They are bloggers, not analysts."
and there he is posting his short interest strategy to one and all......it's purely little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff and his con-artist promotion way of trying to get you shareholders to sell so he can gamble with options when owning ZERO shares.....get it?
Lots of people throwing in the towel today. A complete loss of faith in management.
"T has everything going for it now. Loads of new subscribers on HBO Max and a steady income stream with it's phone infrastructure ""which is being upgraded to 5G as we speak"". This is a 31 dollar a share stock in a month, after the next wave of subscribers flood in! Time to load up."
"since my estate was settled late last year I am now the proud owner of 100,500 shares of ATT.....that's currently a value of $2,857,215.00 with $209,040.00 in yearly dividends....of course that's nothing compared to little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff.....even though he owns NO T shares he will be BRAGGING about how much money he makes off his put/call options any second just watch"

Can't pay the dividend without the 14 Billion its trying to borrow it isn't just about the 5 G spectrum folks get out while you can this debt bomb is going to 3-8 once the news of missed dividend gets out
I'm 6 cents away from being in the green on share price. I'm already in the green on profit though with dividend reinvestment.
Time to Back up the Truck Boys and Girls and get you 7% div while you still can.
T is great.
It must be CNN why this is doing so bad!
This is getting hard to watch. I think I will have to do something else today.
not an advice. AT&T price prediction March 21; $38 min. News talking about AT&T more to come. listen up a company who works for their best to increase their potential soon going to be paying us.
Ahhh the 30 minutes to close swoon. I may have to start capitalizing on this trend.
"Argus maintains a $38pt and expects a dividend increase later this year. Synopsis follows:ARGUS RATING: BUY• Reaffirming BUY and $38 target• As expected, the pandemic weighed heavily on AT&T's 4Q results, especially in the WarnerMedia andVideo divisions.• However, the core wireless services business continued to show resilience as work-at-homerestrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vital than ever.• The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in the wireless industry, thoughconsumers may still be reluctant to switch carriers due to the pandemic.• We are lowering our 2021 EPS estimate to $3.19 from $3.27 and setting a 2022 forecast of $3.25.INVESTMENT THESIS We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $38. The COVID-19 pandemic had multiple negative impacts on AT&T's business in 4Q20,especially on the WarnerMedia and Entertainment divisions. However, the core wirelessservices business continued to show resilience as the pandemic and follow-onwork-at-home restrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vitalthan ever. Based on management's comments, we expect AT&T to face continued revenue andprofit pressure from the pandemic in 2021. While these effects may tail off over time, thefuture is highly uncertain - as reflected in management's weak 2021 guidance. Still, AT&Tcan rely on its strong balance sheet and prudent management as strengths in the currentenvironment. The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in thewireless industry, and AT&T has offered an attractive promotion to boost iPhone 12upgrades. Nevertheless, consumers may be reluctant to switch carriers until the pandemicrecedes. AT&T trades at a modest forward valuation premium to peers and at the low end ofthe historical range."
I'm so looking forward to a fact-based science-centric administration.
It looks like T is going to hit its 52 weeks high soon with financial improvement and future improvement to 2025
"How much do they want to borrow? Seriously, they just said they were paying down debt."
$30 tomorrow.$40 next week.I wanted to be the first this week to say it.
All the worst-performing stocks up big except T. Oil stocks - huge runup. Financial stocks - huge runup. T cant even get to $30. Time for new leadership!
I guarantee that we would double in share price if they would announce that CNN was cancelled.
"talk about consistent yesterday market way up T down ,16 , today market down a few points,T down .16, note to self sell at opening tomorrow,worst stock there is"
"Well, how a good nights sleep changes things. Look at all that green. Maybe T stays over 29.00 after all."
25 years with Verizon and switched to att today. Better price by a little but it comes with hbo max. Had a trial period and can’t be without it with all the new releases coming out. I think this is gonna be the case going forward for many Verizon and other users. Probably why they beat expectations for this and it’s only gonna continue as content increases
"l have both HBO and Netflix and I oun 2500 shares of T and no shares in Netflix. I try to find something to watch on HBO , It for me is hard to do despite their bid inventory, so I go to Netflix and have no problem finding so many program's that are really good plus Netflix menu is much better to access. I am 79 yrs old and I have had both for the same amount of time one year..."
29 never againBwahaha!Toooo Funnny
"So much baggage. High debt, expensive spectrum bidding, money-losing direcTV biz, covid crippled WB production biz, high dividend, etc the list goes on and on and never gets crossed out..."
Who in their right mind is selling at these prices? Good God!
Watch what this stock does on Tues. near the close. That will tell you everything you need to know about the earnings report.
imagine if the market wasnt down 2%
"LOL,LOL All the T haters get ready to go higher and higher , Why because T's 5G monster is ALIVE and feeding on the competition LOL,LOL,LOL"
"When T reports on Jan 27, they will show a large increase in HBO Max subscribers which should be positive for the stock price"
If you have to borrow money to pay the dividend then that company is not going to be around much longer
HBO MAX and HBO GO Asia crashed several times today because of the Justice League movie $T gambling so far seems to be working for them
My guarantee stands. $29.99 YES!! I can now touch myself tonight and not break my promise.
There are diminishing dividend returns as the share values peters down .5% a day. I’m reading that T has entered a “oversold” condition. I sure in the hell hope so. An up day or two would be nice.
It would be a 'big plus' if we close above $33 again- a sign of 'things to come'!
T~ said many times T shouldn’t have been able to buy DTV . Could of simply had a bundled marketing program to lure DTV customers. Time Warner another gem . Wanted CNN
"CNN ""facts first""great!"
"Boy, you guys sure like to complain. The stock goes up and you complain that it's not enough. Now you're even complaining about the number of employees T has. What's next, how many sinks are in the wash rooms?"
Young and institutes investors are not into T which has no excitement around it. Faster we learn is good. AT&T's best asset HBO MAX is not able to create any buzz. It's done. Netflix is the king and will remain that way for years to come.
"All green today, except for Mr. T."
"Morningstar has a $36 price target and sees the shares as attractiveI tried to post a summary of their report but Yahoo deleted my postIf you have Schwab, you can see it there"
Established a relatively small position this morning. Picked up 400 shares at $28.19. Was torn about diving in as I like better balance sheets. In the end I decided on a smaller position. Just gotta love that dividend! I know a lot of you are underwater on this and wish you all the best on recouping your investment with nice profits in 2019. GLTA
Today my friends we are not bag holders
"I've been on this board for the past two years, and not once have I contributed anything useful."
Hope T closes at $29 today. Could happen.
Do you know that AT&T￼ has a History of paying a Dividend for 36 years!
Surprise! A dive at the bell. Again!
This is a classic buy and hold stock. Anyone complaining of short term losses should go day trade something elae.
Its starting to move. UP!!!
"Amazing folks think this is a high growth stock, it is a dividend stock. W 5g and HBO max being key drivers it will take some time to move needle. Drip (or if retired live off divy) and just relax"
Time to embrace low $20s. Outlook turning very Bearish.
30+ today?

"If you think T is bad, look at Pfizer.. came up with a vaccine for covid and its stuck in the mid-30's for many years now."
How are you feeling about the earnings report?
Donny please be our next ceo our then we can offload cnn for sure
"So long as the market manipulators keep playing games, AT&T should repurchase shares. It would actually save more money than paying for debt. Even if just 1B a quarter, just to retake ownership of the stock."
“Large minority” stake eh.... kinda like jumbo shrimp I guess
"John Stankey's 1st year as the CEO.I give him high marks for off loading most of Telephone's extra baggage and getting back to the essentials,But! The public perception of ATT needs polishing.He missed hitting a home run by not off loading CNN during 2020.Now, its worth billions less.I say sell it anyway."
"Wow, the whiners are out in force today. I don't understand why you just don't sell if you hate the stock that much."
"High Invest in wireless and fiber sector, debt decrease by not increasing dividend, HBO Max beat expectations even by not being released in Europe. Revenue decline but managment clearly in work of transforming the company. Everything is set for a decent long term."
"T ~ your revenues are worrisome, your debt is massive , spectrum will in the billions . Reasonable to assume an argument of dividends isn’t surprising"
"$40 by the end of the year, $50 by the end of next year, $60 by the end of 2020."
$30 today would be nice
Another star moving into alignment. Harry Potter on TV is being explored.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/harry-potter-live-action-tv-series-in-early-development-at-hbo-max-exclusive
DIS cut its div to ZERO and hits all new highs day after day. While geriatric controlled T will be mired in the mud because the old dont care about the future because they wont be a part of it. Sad its legal for these old people to rob this company blind b4 they die off. :(
Decent volume but seems like it should be 10m by now moving up like this. I’m prepared to drop back a lil so I sold a bit at 30.20. Be happy if it stays but buy more under $30 if it drops again
Did T sell DTV?I can't find any news to that effect.
S&P hitting 4K is judgement day. Crash 2.0
It doesn’t like $29.
Is there a changing of the guard in progress? VZ has always been the fair-haired boy and T the redheaded stepchild. Is that reversing?
"Morningstar says 'T' is on target:Analyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Analyst, 24 July 2019 ""We continue to believe AT&T is moving in the right direction. The firm delivered solid wireless results during the second quarter, while Game of Thrones provided a lift at WarnerMedia’s HBO unit, which has struggled to grow amid a carriage dispute with Dish Network. The troubled entertainment segment again outperformed our expectations, balancing pricing and expenses better than we thought possible, contributing to profit growth. Consolidated cash flow was also again strong, enabling another quarter of significant debt reduction. Management increased its 2019 free cash flow projection to $28 billion from $26 billion. This increase was based primarily on the sale of WarnerMedia receivables, rather than any major change in the business, which appears to reflect management’s desire to begin repurchasing shares as soon as possible. We agree that repurchases would add value for shareholders given the current stock price""."
"If T was smart they would spin off HBO. A stand alone HBO is worth $100B. And that's without Time Warner behind it. Just IPO the thing and allow it to prosper. At todays insane prices, it will skyrocket. The smart companies know their brand weaknesses and Mcdonalds shows the way. They IPO'ed Chipolte and held all the millions of shares as it skyrocketed once detached from the hated parent company. T has too many haters, but HBO is a well liked brand with a history of some of the best shows ever made by a non-broadcast network. They can keep the partnerships and free HBO for Cell subscribers and even better - pay a fee for them. T revenue doesn't go anywhere, but HBO revenue grows like crazy. So HBO stock hits the moon and T goes nowhere, but a T stockholder gets the 7% yield of the T stock and a new share of HBO that gives the growth. Too bad they probably can't see how great that would be."
Whole system is broken here. Its all day trading daily here period. Need massive thousands of points sell of in all markets in us period. Wall Street greed only here. This is what happens when a Democrat gets into office. They give away everything in the system period. Working people get nothing period. Democrats are known for this period. THis is why we crash by thousands. Need to raise taxes on corporations here and now. We need trillions that were given away by republicans period. They gave Wall Street massive cuts. We need massive taxes raised on Wall Street by trillions here period. Need to pay up to pay for everying not more massive debt by government period. We tax payers pay for it. Wall Street needs to pay here and now by trillions to make up for last 4 years of cuts/ or no new taxes.
"Dish has some real execution doubters but, if Dish can get some traction they could be the next T-mobile. The DOD actually seems interesting in a possible joint project there. Something AT&T would historically have done. If Dish can make their 2023 build-out comments, Dish’s nationwide open RAN network will become the lowest cost provider. The 5g golden rule: Text, talk & video...all just data. He who offers the lowest cost data wins. It’s a race to the bottom. AT&T’s only saving grace may be owning content (HBO) and advertising. I’m not sure that will offset subscriber losses."
Any buyers if this hits 14 ? I’ve been waiting a year and so far no luck .
I'm sorry for yelling at you but that dude said $40 for AT&T! I believe Goldman Sachs has some great people and I love you. Please answer the phone tonight.
I believe almost half of the voters in the presidential election have a pretty good idea why the Nashville bombing occurred. The answer will never be mentioned on CNN.
Looks like someone wants to make Bat Candy today for Options Expiry. Or a witch hunt whichever comes first...
Anyone has been watching Condor AT&T original series and streaming on their channel (Audience) much better than most Netflex movies. It comes on every Wednesday.
"My grand father said this is a nice boomer stock. Nothing booming so far, unless you mean this crater on the returns on T on my investment overview."

"Barring some big news it looks like we are going to have to get used to shares being range bound between 28-30 for quite a while. Fine by me, I'm not selling as long as the dividend isn't cut and it seems to be secure for now."
Cramer says ATT is to risky. Cramer recommends Tesla. What is more risky a telcom with strong cash flow and possible revenues from streaming PE around 20 or a car company that makes < 500k cars at a PE of around 1500. I hope Elon is able to create all the things he dreams of. They sound very cool but most of the ideas are still vaporware. At current prices which investment has more short term risk?
Another close above $30. Looks like I can have a little pork with my beans tonight
"All the T haters get to say today OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL Why because T is higher than it was last Friday LOL,LOL,LOL Yes T is going higher and all the T haters get to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"What alternate universe did I slip into, the only stock green in my portfolio is T!"
Morning T ~ dish is moving higher two 52 week high days .Telecom is getting interesting
28.30-28.50 or lower is great to add/start a position in my opinion;even a little above is ok. Don't chase too much.
"They should have called it Home Box Office instead of hbomax. The former conveys the idea of many many movies whereas hbomax sounds like a suped up, single channel (hbo). The reason I say that is that I think T is having a problem converting hbo customers who get it over cable to the streaming product. Those customers possibly don’t see they’re getting incremental value. Jmo"

LOL,LOL,LOL we are now having to pay double to fund the debt they just 4 months ago . WOW"

Everyone rushed in early on such a good report... now they will learn the hard way about how T handles decent news
Randall Stephenson is now a consultant and executive chairman?This is unbelievable!
Over half a million HBO max downloads over the Christmas weekend and stock is down. What?
28.73 is breakeven for me. Now in danger of losing principal. Although cap gain would be nice all I want from T is to stay at breakeven and rise in time enough to get back ex div drop each quarter. 7.24 yield is why I'm in T.
We will get dividend paid on 8/1 also. Cheers to T holders.
"Where's the head cheerleader, osulinn, who said $32 by today and $40 near term? I think he also said we're on our way to $60."
I’m in this for the yield. Fcf strong enough to alleviate debt concerns. HBO max should be a growth driver.
Will forever be allergic to $30!

"Under 29 and I’m loading the truck! The trading multiples will eventually change to reflect the growth of HBO Max. Check out how that service did with the release of Wonder Woman 1984 a few weekends ago! And there are many more hits to come..Otherwise, new CEO and management look to have their priorities straight, finally. I hope to get more clarity on the removal of non-core assets (Direct TV?) during their investor day at the end of the month and also an update on debt repayment and dividends."

"Right now, I evaluate T as a volatile bond fund. To get this kind of yield from bonds, I have to invest in emerging market government debt in countries like Ukraine or Romania. From that perspective, T offers the stability of a company that provides critical US infrastructure, streaming growth potential and a 100 year operating history. Given current market valuations and a distaste for value, T is an easy buy and hold here."
Futures are up.. T will be down 5c tomorrow. Good luck.
"up 1 cent, we're on our way, Not"
I just brought another 2000 shares. Cheers!

I've read many many articles where people have said HBO Max has better content than Netflix.

"As of Dec 28, Wonder Woman 1984 has earned $85 million world wide which included $16.7 million for it's theater debut in the US on Dec 27. The picture costed $200 million to make. The first Wonder Woman movie, released in June 2017, grossed $821 million world wide.I don't know about you but I don't think Wonder Woman 1984 is going to be the big money maker that many here think or says it is. Not saying that's good or bad, just saying that's how it seems to me."
Not enough shares traded for T to be buying back shares so might have been the shorts. Day traders taking profits off the highs of the day.
"annnnd down again,maybe we can get to 28 today, worst stock there is #$%$"
Hmmm!Kilar is talking WM and HBOMax tomorrow and T moving up ahead of it.Could there be a connection there?
owned t for 8 years 5 t shares collected alot of dividends solid stock. you won't lose money on T.
Load up at these prices while you can
"Name any part of AT&T’s business that is growing. Here’s a company that has more debt than any company on the planet and is unable to retain customers. Yeah I know it’s $15 buck HBO. 5G is T’s biggest nightmare not it’s salvation. Surplus spectrum will be sold to the likes of Amazon and Apple and Goggle. Prepare now for the coming data commodification. Everything T sells is data. Data will become cheap. No company, because of debt, is more at risk. You can thank the former CEO’s and board of directors. Add the liability of owning bias CNN which angers half of America (potential customers) you have maybe hedge funds best short idea. Oh wait it is."
This doesn't happen very often but T has regained the ex-div drop on the same day as the drop. 1 Year after merger completed this will be a $55 stock. Buy now for big capital gain and extremely generous dividend while you wait.
T will not drop any more until after the ex date

"Report out that the House will investigate whether Trump overstepped in the govt's actions vis a vis Time Warner and the Washington Post. I suppose this is the beginning of what we can expect over the next two years. As an investor, and as u.s. citizen, it made me ill to know how the DOJ was being used. It was very hard to find an academic, a regulator or other ""expert"" who supported the DOJ's initial suit and even fewer now with the appeal. I'm a republican and can be even handed in looking at things. But on this matter, it's terrifying to think how the government's power is being used."

Could it be possible T will close above the 5 day moving average 
We think ATT is one of the most safe stock around. Watch....you get at least 7 percent on your shares.. We have owned during the extreme down market that occurred. Do not bother looking at the share price. Treat this stock has you would a bank c/d (which now pays about 2%. ATT has been around from my Grandmother's day and I am in my senior years. Watch...slowly people will get wise and put there money there for 2-4 years. I am being sincere.... hard times seem to be coming...too much gov. money nowbeing allocated . My question is why would people go back to work when they can get more money than when working. Hold tight this does not look good for us.

"The hat trick of streaming HBOMax-Disney & Netflix can be all yours for under $50 bucks a month. And with TW cranking out movie premieres on HBOMax, most streaming junkies will want all 3. Each bring different content to the screen that we all want; covering all generations and bundled together it seems we have enough to indulge ourselves. Forgive me as I digress..Nothing gives me more satisfaction than streaming the fiction of White House Down with all the politicians paying the ultimate price for their incompetence and stupidly.As for predictions...I see HBOMax blowing away all estimates because of announcing the premiering of TW movies. It’s a bargain coupled with a holiday roll out, and the gifting HBOMax as WW made her debut streaming was a great marketing idea. Finally discounting right before earning I believe was to add as many new subscribers to add as much rosy scenario as T can about HBOMax to earning. GLTA"
"I switched from Comcast to AT&T yesterday, Jan 18 2019. My bill dropped from $ 130.75 to $73.00,, $57.75 monthly saving. Reception speed 30+ Mb/sec is all good to see anything streaming without buffering. Modem with phone hook up included. I am now posting on AT&T modem. Paperless billing."

"AT&T CEO Says No Need to Worry About Generous Dividend -- Market Talk10:56 am ET February 8, 2019 (Dow Jones) Print10:55 ET - AT&T shareholders needn't lose any sleep about a possible dividend cut despite its lofty 7% yield and the company's pledge to rapidly pare the $40B in debt it added when it bought Time Warner, CEO Randall Stephenson says. Speaking to CNBC, Stephenson reiterates AT&T should generate $26B in free cash flow this year, leaving $12B for debt reduction after the company shells out $14B in dividends. He says there's another $6B-$8B in the pipeline from asset sales. Add that to the $9B it repaid last year, and AT&T will have repaid 75% of the Time Warner debt by the end of 2019, Stephenson tells CNBC.

Well good news. If value is now up to 16.25 and they sold 30% means ~4.875b sale.
"Fox News correspondent Charlie Gasparino reported that the pending TMUS/S merger could provide stronger competition to fight Huawei. As I understand it, TMUS/S are service providers, whereas Huawei is a supplier of network infrastructure products. If so, how can TMUS/S compete against Huawei? It seems to me that the real competition for Huawei, as it regards US carriers, is between Huawei and Ericsson and Nokia. What have I missed?"
"What would it do to T stock price if they decided to stop the dividend and put the roughly $15 billion per year to pay down debt? Let's say they also use the majority of the $43 billion cash flow for the next 2 years to pay down debt. How would the stock price react to the debt being paid down by roughly $50 billion per year - $100 billion in 2 years? Add in a possible Direct TV sale and maybe you can pay off $120 billion in that time. It seems the main anchor is the debt for T stock, how much do they need to shed before the market values them higher? I know they need to show some revenue growth as well, and I'm confident that will come over the next few years."
I am personally upgrading T to a strong buy!

"That's right Mr. Market, I will not sell my shares to you for the next 10 years."
"Based on today’s drop for T, this stock is what it is, a dividend only play in the $28-$29 range unless 1. Good earnings report on Jan 27th 2. HBO MaX total subscriber count has increased to at least 20 million 3. T management is serious about selling DTV. Not increasing the dividend this year is also concerning some investors although 7% plus dividend is still an excellent return."
Will they pin T at 29 for today's options expiration?
if this deal falls thru and stock doesn't recover thru earnings or buyback. ....Stephenson has to go
The immediate reaction will likely be down because of the DEBT word. The outlook is what matters.

"Ex-dividend tomorrow. T is green and that's good. Yesterday VZ got about a $.75 pop going into its ex-divy dat today. I own both, a lot more VZ. Hopefully streaming and Time Warner E pay off. I have to say after the failed attempt to acquire TMUS with T losing a $4 bil escrow to TMUS and after the Directv fiasco, I am very glad the old CEO is history. He grabbed for the biggest deals he could do to buy cash flow, I hope he was right about Time -- at least in range."
T getting pumped on CNBC.
Should head to $32 by summer easy
T's growth will come when they start doing their targeted ads.
"For anyone frustrated with the price, T was $30 bucks 2 years ago, 10 years ago and 20 years ago so the current price shouldn't be much of a surprise. News or earnings don't seem to affect the price so you can probably expect a lot of the same for the forseeable future."

"Was stuck in the $28-$29 range and now progressed to the $29-$30 range. With the drop today, the yield went back over 7% so I bought some more shares. If T continues to add cell customers, HBO Max customers, and movie theaters start to increase capacity as the COVID virus decreases, I can see over $30 per share price even if dividend drops to 6% range."

Compare with T that went from 34.76 to 28.70 in that same 5 years, a drop of 6 bucks. Adding 5 years of $2.04 divy, ur up a tot of about 4 bucks. What would u rather have? A win of 4 bucks or a win of $111 not counting apple divy?"
would it been wise to buy T yesterday or today so you can get that 52 cents divident ? or am i wrong . any ideas please thank you

And that goes for so many other companies that have been beaten up mercilessly.

As of January 7, AT&T has a forward PE ratio of 8.64x for fiscal 2019, and its estimated PE ratio for fiscal 2020 is 8.49x. The forward PE ratios for Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint are 12.03x, 17.07x, and 113.24x, respectively, in fiscal 2019."
"This time, AT&T will go up to $60...I think we hit $32 on thursday."
"Gravity kicks in, and AT&T is one heavy stock...."
Cheetah I sold $30 strike calls expiring March 19 and got $.59I’m happy to have my shares called away at $30
This is a $40 dollar stock and it will get there anytime now
@TEX and his buddies have excellent strategies. Chime in with your strategies as well
"Meanwhile, my ZM ""Zoom"" shares up 70 points just today including after-hours....I am shocked T is so undervalued. SMH!!!"
"I own both... Cramer is Cramer .. always trying too hard to find us a bull market, right?.... hahaIn 2019 Cramer pumped T ever chance he got with his thing on how to read charts... in short ... The charts person he quoted said “T was a great buy because of the chart indicated a buy low senecio”... because timeline is hard to do when it comes to buy low sell high........ However it Never did do much.... I think it is was $37.00 or so during the episode....... and that was a buy point based off the historical charting of the lows...As for Verizon, it did start a down trend towards the end of 2020... So its very easy to call the ball on VZ going up...However Buying T under $30 is very smart and Cramer should be pumping it now... but Cramer will not pump T again until it’s above $35 or even above $37.00..... Cramer is very good at creating bag holders.... sometime he’s spot one.... HOWEVER, I never foolishly follow this guy... That said 9 out of 10 times, I owned his stock pick way before he pumped it up....So just do your own home work on this...... Find your own bull market....... Because either T and/or VZ can and should always be good paying dividends stocks for long term holders .......despite Cramer pumps and dumping opinions about either T or VZSomething to consider ...... 10k in a savings account will make you $0.17 per month .... The same 10K investment in T will make you around $30.00 a month.... Hmmmm...... that’s roughly 200 times as much before taxes.... no brainer ... right?"
Downward sloping trendline back to last june.It sits at 30.50 currently.Thats only 1% from here.If we break that we'll be on our way.
"Tell ya what, give me 30 bucks and I'll give you 53 cents every qrtr."
even the reddits wont buy this.......
Can ATT really justify investing in fiber?Look what happened to Frontier?
you won't lose money on this stock and the dividend is so sweet.
"It's going to the teens.30teen, 31teen, 33teen"
"ATT'S CREDIT RATING is now lower than its been in the last 20 years.Do the CNN handoff before financing costs become prohibitive.Warner will survive and prosper only with financial support,Not an accountant."
Below is what bots trade off.
"For all of you who keep saying T is getting dragged down by CNN, you're barking up a wrong tree if you think CNN is holding T back. Half the country loves CNN so how does that wash with your argument? Stop making excuses for T. T is being held down by T."
Whens the dividend announcement coming?
"Thank Heavens that Randy got the company on the inclusivity push except for the laid off techs and service reps, and worse and worse service metrics."
Cramer bashed T again! What wind sock  says > 7% yield is scary!
My feeling why T down fall recently was Time Warner shareholders taking their profit. I wanted to buy more if it hit 30 but already own a lot of T and VZ. I believe we have hit the low going forward.Good luck to long term holders.
"T only went down the last two days due to the fund managers had to sell T and buy TWX, now that has been completed they can buy T. Crammer talked down T earlier so he can buy some knowing he made the wrong bet."
Sad but its gonna tank again as people rotate back into growth. Helluva lot ofDeals out there
TMUS-VZ also tanking today.
Revenue per share has been flat since 2013. Profit/EPS has come from cutting capital spending ($4 per share to 2.80) and tax cuts (33% to 19%).
Anyone else notice Big T closed above the 200?
"There are some weird people on this board. If you bought T for anything but the dividend I don't know what to tell you. It is a sub $30 stock period the end, better than a savings account."
"Market participants comprise so many types. One type is the uneducated who keeps hammering away at how dumb mgmnt was in the past to do this deal or that. They harp on it over and over as if the stock will reflect the past stupidity, whereas the smart investor knows that the stock market is forward looking and all historical facts are already reflected in the stock. So for you that are in the former camp, have at it....keep repeating the number of billiions less DTV is valued at today vs when they bought it. Say the numbers atgain and again as if you're saying something new, or as if you're intellectual somehow because you actually know the numbers.. The rest of us will determine whether an infusion of cash from a DTV deal positions the company better or worse for the future and will buy/sell/hold based on that."
"Wow, look at all the cheerleaders pouring out of the woodwork. LOL LOL We're on our way to the moon folks! Before you get too excited let me remind you that T's trading range is $28 - $32 and also that we've been here three times before in the last three months and even higher in mid December.Now carry on, it's fun to watch the ants running around this ant farm like a bunch of loony birds."
if you're like me I'm wondering why little tiny pee wee schitzo freak dr fauci cheeto puff stopped BRAGGING about buying BP at $31 with a slashed dividend......and stopped lecturing T shareholders on this message board about shorting its stock and gambling your shares on his call/puts options.....not only does little tiny cheeto puff look like dr fauci he knows everything like the cdc dr too......maybe he;s just having another bad day
"The anti T media predicts the market will go back to theaters. But big theaters closed or at 50%!!! The streaming numbers are not in yet for Wonder Woman. The strategy for streaming hit movies is correct and T will prosper! They have the films that the markets want!!!! Ha! The second wave of covid is strong, good 4th quarter for T and better 1st quarter 2021. Why such anti-T anger?"
This sure is some stock lol
Afternoon T ~ it’s a real shame T isn’t in the position to buy back shares . The stock needs a catalyst to move higher and not being negative just don’t think the stock is moving much higher
if you paid $57 a while back are u still stoked on the 7% div in your ROth?ARCC pays 9%
"My father is a Pioneer, worked at Western Electric for 30 years, will not all 30 he worked at Baltimore works on Broening Hey in East Balto and was transferred after judge Green broke up the Bell System in the 1980's and moved to Merrimack Valley in New Hampshire to finish his caareer at Lucent. He has gotten that dividend every quarter to supplement his retirement. There are many many people who rely on that old faithful payout. Thank you T for taking care of our family over the years"
"Get ready to say OH NO up T goes as they take even more customers away from VZ today LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Cable TV is dead. T is positioned to take advantage of worldwide switch to streaming via ala cart purchases of HBO Max. They will most likely lose Direct TV customers or at the very least retain some them to HBO Max. 5G does not have the big growth potential as HBO Max/Time Warner movies. HBO Max is the only reason this stock will go higher. Subscribers will be the focus of investors for the next few quarters as the big streamers (Netflix, DIS, Youtube TV, ROKU, HULU, Apple TV, etc) have a huge final fight to the finish for market share. Should be fun to watch the reports each quarter if your long and they crush the subscriber numbers."
I warming up too T here.....will have an  on it tomorrow. It did generate a short term buy signal last week.....if price holds I may be a player. Boy would that be something if the momo crowd pushed Big liquid T up too 52 week highs
"Play this smart- buy the dips, sell the rallies."
Looks like another down day tomorrow for China Joe.
big biz loves cheap labor!! #farming
TX POWER FILING BK! WHAT? NO BAILOUT??
Never c 20 tys again!
Another wonderful red day.
More rumblings of new max subs beating by a lot. Steady accumulation. Wednesday should be exciting to say the least. I'm betting longs will finally have a good day and shorts should consider covering before earnings.
Grab it while you can..HINT..Weekly....I am telling you...MMs will try to hold it back but they will be washed away!!!!
"Yesterday's close approx $30. T pays Divy $0.52 and stock is down $1.07 to $28.94, this doesn't really seem like a good deal. T is down double the quarterly dividend. Thoughts??"
"Once the larger funds have run their scam on 'growth' stocks that make no money and sell-off, they will all return to ATT which is probably 30% undervalued at the moment. It is a funny world, debt and cash are cheap and yet investors are looking for ATT to pay down debt?"
"Att has profits!!! ALL it has to do is stop the dividend, and the debt repayment machine will start... Why people hype on the stock going up or down... Tell them to cut the divy, just like WFC did, if you do not want to see a down day..... and have all previous and current management buy the stock on the open market.... you will see 40 in two weeks then... no one is ready for that!!!"
Quite the stock we have right here lol.
"My, the bashers are out in force today!"
I can see why Warren Buffett bought TMobile instead of T or VZ. Apparently they have a big lead in 5G spectrum.
What is surprising is why isn't Gold at $5000 with all the money printing thats going on. Bitcoin will hit 50K soon on its way to 100k.
Happy NYE to the weakest dividend chasers and humans in the market.  
"I'm in. IF they cut the dividend, it would be to pay down debt and that would get investors excited. So whoever bailed would be backfilled by others. It could actually go higher immediately, but if not it would drop and then rise fairly quickly. So basically this is a safe buy at 30."

I would really like to add a few more shares to my holdings. Been waiting for a hard bottom to form. Do you think we have seen it? Thanks in advance .
Man I love this stock. Ignore the noise. ATT will be around for a LONG LONG time paying dividends the whole way.
Pre-market action is nice. Will see 33+ today. Time for WS to appreciate T!
Is anyone else worried about their ability to continue to make dividend payments. Just say that they added 0 earnings after preferred dividends and everything (0 addition to retained earnings). Now considering this they would only be able to continue paying dividends at the current level for 2.5 years. Considering they took a loss this year and net income has been decreasing for the past 4 years is this something anyone else is worried about since most people in T are in for the dividend. Thanks!
"VZ new game plan is to see how many customers they can lose to the GREAT and powerful T every weekend is now setting a new record of how many customers VZ can lose LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
TGIF T ~ VZ & T bidding big for spectrum and worried about TMUS growth is probably doesn’t sit well with big shots
I've read some concerning articles the past couple days about HBO Max. They are basically throwing everything into it. If it doesn't work out for the streaming part they will be forced to re-evaluate the whole Warner platform including Max. Everything else getting tabled until MAX has some more content. Plus didn't know this but WW84 is no longer on streaming in the U.S... Only thirty days at the same point at theater release then all new content gets the boot off the guide. Yep.
hbo max now #1 in app store hottest app this holiday weekend. Disney #6 the only other streaming service in the top 200. will wall street care come monday?
WHAT IS THE PRICE DO YOU NEED T TO GO UP TO TO BREAK EVEN?MINE IS 34.23
You thought the riots over the summer was bad...we havent seen anything yet.
This stock is full of suprises today!
Besides my cannabis play this has been the worst stock in my portfolio. I have watched it drop over the past 5 years from 40 to 28 because of income. How much lower can it go?
IF T IS SO RICH WHY DO THEY NEED TO GET A LOAN FOR $14 BILLION AND GO DEEPER IN DEBT?
I did manage to buy 500 at 28.62 adding to my current 3000 shares. We will see where this goes.I hate the stock market.
"$35 by Friday, pin this post. Thank me on Friday"
Will the short squeeze Run up AT&T stock like GMELot of shares short
Almost all selling this am.
Is there a law preventing this stock from closing over $30?BTW- The yield fluctuates with share price- dividend is fixed until and if T changes it.
When u start paying $4 per gal and power bill goes up 20% . CNN helped sleepy Joe get slip into white house.
"T Goes down everyday like it's a routine, Too Bearish for anyone to hold while everything including GE goes up a lot recently."
I added 500 shares today @$28.88. GLTA 
"Three facts:1) CNN is the highest rated and most watched news channel in the world. 2) The motive has NOT been established in the Nashville bombing. Any speculation is just that.3) HBO Max is here to stay and movie theaters are likely destined for the history books. Between the overpriced everything, shootings, bombings, and COVID-19, it's unlikely anyone will return."
As expected yesterday’s low is bear trap just to scare the small day traders. Institutional holding recently went up exceeding to 54% of the outstanding volume.
"Verizon would like to thank yo in part of @R's and @c's no contribution to the Superbowl. We had your backs though, buddies! HBOMax to the side and I am looking forward to more best movies from the producers!"

Just noticed over '6 million shares' in after hours- probably 'option expiration' related.
3 more cents from now and we'll be back to where we were a month ago.
Ex divvy day coming up in 3 weeks or so. Should crack $30 before ex divvy.

I missed the dip.. grrrrrrr
Is a correction in the whole market coming? Maybe holding some cash for awhile might be a good idea. It's all a craps shoot.
CFO basically said today no dividend increase for 2021. Very disappointing. Says the stock price not reflecting dividend value. Ya...who's fault is that!?! T leadership needs to be paying more attention to the stock price & not their salaries & bonuses.
"Good diversifying stock that returns 7% a year. Just a matter of time for a breakout. HBO Max is the real deal, and T will be rewarded for it."
"T For Trash, Non-Stop falling knife from $60 since early 2000 to $20s today, Continue to Bag-hold another decade, you deserve to join T for Teens= $10s Club next."

I am very surprised at how few investors are keeping up with what AT&T is doing in the area of Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to drive our economy in the future and AT&T has so many opportunities to grow the bottom line with their access and the Bell Labs.https://about.att.com/inside_connections_blog/future_of_ai
"Wow, this board went downhill fast. Yahoo censors where art thou?"
Loading up on T today. Dividend this week. Easy money. 7%. Booya a!
"So kinda mixed bag but overall good. Earning and revenue topped estimates, hbo max now 2 years AHEAD of schedule. Seems like sale of direct (well really partial sale) is going happen . I believe this is a positive (yes they made a terrible decision to buy it, like epically bad) since the thought process is what is best thing going forward. T was most active bidder in spectrum auction which short term is going to mean more debt (est 14 billion range) but long term good as this will help w 5G revenues. Guidance wasn’t as good as I hoped but overall not terrible. Still long T and believe nice stock for long term. D collect divy while u wait. This is not a high flyer like some clowns on here are bashing it for not being, it’s an income stock w potential for capitol appreciation esp when u control ur buy points. Good luck all"
OPEX keeping stock price pegged again and again etc
"CNN, the highest viewership on cable. Why would you want to sell a moneymaker like this? Now ad cost will skyrocket and become a cash cow for Warner Media. Things are looking up. If they did sell it though I can think of 1 billionaire that would gladly buy it."
Will it close above 30?
Guys this is a New Years miracle we are up more than 10 cents
LOL Forgot I still had 50 shares of AMC sitting in the portfolio... out with $800 profit. Hey Andy you still here? How about that AMC?
I/We believe AT&T is one of the Best Dividend plays with forward price appreciation in the Stock Market. Strong Buy.
"From webcast: ""We are having a STRONG 3rd Quarter"" - so expect good things on Oct 24th!"
This is a nice little run here. Hopefully we get 35 back soon and then onward to 36.
Remember when I said there is no other option but for VZ to come down and T to rise. The SP disparity was too great and with no reason to be as such. VZ had topped out for a while.No future proofing with media assets and only a money burn 5G to show for with apparently low ROI
Fear of earth rotational cessation if close above 29.00 ?
Typical T shareholders after receiving dividends
Does anyone know when the dividend announcement is going to be made
T ~ VZ big time premium customers are adapting to a new normal and with remote work etc VZ is in trouble. Wouldn’t short but won’t buy
Go T! CNN most watched cable news network.
Strange. ATT hasn't had any major institutional sell-offs that I can find in the SEC filings. I wonder why the price continues to scrape the undercarriage of respectability.
Dividend payment today? Must be in brokerage account after market closes today!
My guess is that T is going to continue to drift lower back to the $29 area again. How could you guys not see this coming today?
Hopefully the Netflix earnings will have a ripple effect on T but I doubt it.
doth my eyes deceive me?! are we actually going to close above 30?!?
Owning T stock is like being on a treadmill. Going nowhere fast.
"Looks like its $29 close today. Maybe next week it will go up to $29.15, but I doubt it. More likely 28.79 next week."
T being red is as sure as the sun coming up.
"Keep that in mind: T understands that the market is changing. They are adapting quite fast, the transformation takes times but it wont take long until good returns will come. T is currently the only telecommunications company that REDUCES its debt and still is able to invest highly in 5G/Fiber. Just look at T-Mobile and Verizon and their Debt-Outlook and Debt ratio. The Long-Term is just better for T.The biggest Asset T has is HBO Max (TimeWarner, but it comes down to its selling platform). This is the only streaming service that is able to really compete with Netflix. Just take Disney+ and HBO Max side by side. Disney+ is absolute trash and still the stock got rich because its a ""streaming"" service. So many people underestimate the burden of making a series of a large franchise. They are extremely expensive. The result is that Disney is barley able to bring out new content.Iam bullish on AT&T. It´s my largest position."
Somebody should go on Craig Moffet's Twitter account and ask him how that $66 price target for Verizon is looking. LOL (I don't have a Twitter account) Or the Moffett/Nathanson Twitter account.
"T, what are we going to do with you. Just incurred billions more in debt for 5G. No increase in dividend so far, top priorities per Mgt is 1. reduce debt. how ironic since they just incurred billions more in debt via 5G auction. 2. sell DTV although appears Stanky reluctant to let go of it. heck, why not wait another year when DTV will be worth even less.3. make HBO Max more successful. of the 17 million current subscribers, 75% of them get it free, so not a big income producer. T was\is successful in the tele business but got in over their heads by buying media which they were qualified to manage. verdict: T buried in debt and not proven yet that their media will be successful enough. a somewhat risky investment because of mediocre management. hold status."
"Seriously, how long will a 7% dividend last¿"
"T has a flood of new customers all from VZ's DUMD dASS HAN's and his Yahoo Natzi's running them off in droves as VZ now Censors what you can see read and post LOL,LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up . VZ FN themselves LOL,LOL,LOL Good Job Han's"

"I love how people get so scared when the market tanks. 2008 is a great example. If investors bought shares back then at discount prices, you would have a small fortune. Peaks and Valleys, someday you are on top of the mountain with a ton of shares."

"Race to the bottom: T-mobile prepay for single line is now as low as $15 unlimited talk text and 3g data. You can add 100g hotspot data for $50 per month. Can 100g data replace home internet? Yeah, maybe, depending on how much video you stream. AT&T has a prepay plan for $25 single line with 8g data. You must pay one year in advance ($300) to get that price. Analysts said having just 3 big providers would stabilize prices....Hasn’t happened."
"T, get a $.52 in dividends and lose up to $1 in stock price. How can a company who pays ex CEO who bought DTV , a $1 million in consulting fees after leaving T ? To me, weak mgt ."
the dividend of T can be considered as damages payment for the underperformance.
Bezos is not going to be the CEO of AT&T...He's just signed on to be a Consultant advisor for AT&Ts Warner Bros Media and HBO Max....Enough said.
[ 28.30 - 28.50 ] target range today
no money to be made on this stock
"What is wrong with this stock? Everything goes the way T wants with the merger, the law suit, the 5g roll outs, large capitalization etc. Surely things will slowly improve? How can a company with so many assets servicing a large public hunger fail?"
"Hope you did the smart thing and sold lots of stocks yesterday on the big up day to get ready for the CRASH that is now coming . LOL Inflation is here and only going to get worse watch for companies reporting input cost and margin squeeze as their stocks get slaughtered. LOL,LOL only the beginning look for stocks to go lower and lower for the decade just like the 1970's, Jimmy Carter all over again what a disaster that was,"
I am sure Melvin Capital regrets they didn't short T instead of GME.
"Hola ! The Como boy is going to court and impeached, probably around the time when T hits $35,"
Back below $30 next week ...
Verizon is up to 169 billion of debt according to multiple reports. But only AT&T has a debt problem. LOL
"once again, i've been with this stock many many years. 26 to 31, thats the range. Buy it for the dividends when stock market goes down due to tax increases. I unloaded all at 31. It will go back to 27, like it has for years. i plan on buying in june, when market realizes you cant print cash without tax hikes."
The dog had a good day
"All the T haters better learn long term to say OH NO up T goes, LOL,LOL T's new unlimited plans with Free HBO MAX is taking customers away from Both VZ and T mobile , Lets see if T mobile can hide how many customers they are losing to T or the earnings and customers losses are so big they just can't hide it LOL,LOL,LOL T's monster is now feeding on the competition LOL,LOL,LOL"
T nears deal to sell minority stake in Direct TV
T stock is not performing well ...... yet another dividend cashed in...
Make sure you get your shares of T on any pull backs before the ex dividend the week of April 5-9 2021 and before earnings shows how many customers T is now taking away from VZ and T Mobile Make sure you lock up all your shares with lock term sell orders over $60 or any higher price you want .
@apoplectic hun: the open interest is crazy! Wow!
AT&T is a pioneer company pays very good dividend; it's way oversold at this level especially considering other companies valuation.1T market-cap for AT&T by 2022 is the target.
do not worry my friends if it doesn't go up in price we will collect the dividend from the shorties very good CD be happy and be patient
Thumbs UP if you think T will keep moving higher from here and thumbs DOWN if you think it will start dropping again in the next day or two. Remember T is probably up in sympathy to VZ and if Buffett wouldn't have bought VZ today T would probably be doing what it usually does (which is not much).
"those are just noises to stir volatility so that someone can make money out of others wrong moves. Don't forget ATNT has been there all these years without the merger. even without this one, there will always be opportunity for another one. business still goes on. even if the merger approved, there will still be rumors like ATNT's financial status for the merger and so on."
"Worst stock ever not named Lehman, it's hard to find worse stock than T after Lehman in 2008 whereas even GE has been steadily going up. T is the Lehman of 2020s."
"Holy Cow! T one year ago 39.06. Now 29.23. A loss of 9.83. Add back 2.08 divy and you only lost 7.75 => 19.8% loss. When you go around saying nice 7% divy, you should be saying you lost nearly 20%. Worse yet, SPY was up over 14.5% in the same amount of time. You'd be up 14.5% instead of down 19.8%."
"Remember without DEM wits without a brain like all the T haters you would never get Great companies like T on sale, because T is now taking customers from VZ and T mobile with their new unlimited plans that you get HBO MAX for FREE, I would not be surprised that T would not have to warn that earnings are going to be better than they were thinking because they are now gaining so many new customers. LOL,LOL,LOL"

If you don't want the JAB... you should buy CSV... they run funeral homes and people that don't believe in vaccines are big customers
This is a joke... they are just not allowing for T to move any further on purpose... Even a great earnings report can't change this

Do You not think if that was true that they would do that. I guess I must be an Idiot. It must just be Me."
"Bonds today are a terrible investment. AT&T is a bond replacement with its 7% yield. Total return on an investment = Price Appreciation + Dividends. Historically, dividends represent 40%of total return. May be a little lower today because of influx of technology. But with price now at extreme low, price appreciation is a good bet to go with your 7% dividend."

Our brokerage has ATT rated A or a strong buy and there are several other strong buys. Why does the Motley Fool continue to bash ATT? When T rallies next year will they admit that they were wrong?
"LOL,LOL,LOL all the T haters worked all day trying to get T lower and T just would not go lower LOL,LOL ,LOL they only got 3 cents at the end of the day and T up after hours 4 cent They are still losing money on the short LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up LOL,LOL Good luck T haters get ready to say OH no up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
"I hope everyone realizes that there are hardly any independent news networks that aren't controlled by corporate entities and their philosophy..Bill O'Reilly, has to pick up the staff in never- never land? Really?"
"sold 1/3 of my T today. hesitant to do it, but tired of daily losses. kept 2/3 of shares just in case rebounds. if bad earnings report on Jan 27th, watch out. if good earnings, my 2/3 shares will help recover some losses. since I had bought all my shares in the 28's, doing OK plus earned the 1/8/21 dividend. hoping for the best for all of us."
March 12 is the investors day at AT&T. Should be an interesting day￼￼￼
Morning T ~ said this b4 tmus like it or not but they are becoming a huge player in telecom. The stock is extremely expensive and don’t own but I follow
"$T Not increasing their dividend might have been the best move they've done in a while. Let's be honest, 95% of us are here for the dividend with a hope that one day their share price increases. It's not what we wanted, but could be better long-term. $T not increasing their dividend might be their way to pay down some debt and look to focus on HBO MAX expansion, which will be their cash cow in the future. They're expanding HBO MAX to Latin America and upgrade their version in Europe to match that of the one in America. Once they drop DirecTV, better things are coming, hopefully."
"The way I heard it, the DOJ once again tried to show that it's in the best interests of T to withhold content e.g. Turner, for the purpose of inflicting longer term pain on the competition. T attorneys and expert witnesses testified that this has never been demonstrated to work. There was also a lot of discussion of the modeling that the DOJ relied on and how it was or was not flawed. It sounded to me like the DOJ tried to prove that notwithstanding the modeling, the merger could do harm to the consumer, and in my layman's opinion, the judges didn't buy it. I realize that ain't worth much, but figured I'd post it anyway. I mean, what else is there to do on a 600 point drop day."
MO. Higher dividend. Infinitely more pricing power.
"Wu Han has a coronavirus bat research lab. And everyone is telling us that the virus came from a bat cave 1000's of miles away from Wu han.CNN keeps repeating this, trying to make it true."
See the press release right on Yahoo.
"Apparently I am being banned from Yahoo, every benign post being removed."
Global warming headed for Colorado
T is going to go down in history as being the all time worse stock. Need to stop playing politics and think about valuation for the company besides pumping up dividends. Which is all it has going for it at this time!
I would like to see a $60 pps. Enough said.
"Looks like the only cell service that should be on any military base in the USA should only be T's cell service , If not the data is now going to the EU's one world order through T mobile or VZ controlled by Han's from the EU. Remember actions speak volumes as VZ and Han's EU run Yahoo NATZI censor Americans and even their own customers and shareholders. Very scary to have the EU with all the USA military data."
Shorts own and manipulate T. It is hard to understand why mgmt let’s it happen. Buy back your stock or delist it. Mgmt does not support shareholders.
"Another down day for AT&T, this is terrible. Management, across the board should be fired. They all must be taking payoffs from others."
"5G pretty soon to juice HBO; lower debt; new HBO advertisement subscription and with all the programs it will have, this stock is still pretty cheap. Highly bullish with this stock."
"Here is one for you if you want to make about 17% or about 12.5% on your money for the year VTRS should make about $4-$4.50 and start paying a dividend this year which should cause the stock to double , but if you don't want to buy VTRS for the growth and dividend , you can sell the Jan 21 2022 $17.50 strike puts and you get over $3 which is about 17% on your money or the $15 strike puts for about $1.90 should get you about 12.5 % on your money . Up to you what kind o#$%$ want to take a what kind of return you want. . T's option just don't have much money in them and they really never do."
"Target price: 36 USD - 37 USD in the next 3 months.Giving it maximal 6 months time to hit.Goodluck, stonks."
Value rotation will be obvious in retrospect!!! Just like tech and $qqq was obvious 5 yrs ago......
"Should the Direct TV handoff be worth 15 billion, I'd be highly surprised."
Just watched some highlights from CPAC. America is truly doomed if this is our future.They are all wanna-be stand up comics. No one wants to put in the hard work.
"VZ subscriber additions miss, might have gone to ATT. Will find out tomorrow. GLTA."
"Well it looks like in Pre. Mkt. we might make a penny or two, and not loose !"
Will this thing ever close above $30?
wow look at all of this crying. picked up enough shares so I can do another covered call. Going to wait and see if I can pull off another weekly 30 strike. Can't do that with you all crying. Your tears are making the price go down! Merica
T above 30. I repeat. T above 30
"7 Reasons AT&T is undervalued and poised to outperform... 1) T offers a high dividend yield backed by a growing stream of free cash flows.2) T is aggressively paying-down debt which decreases its risk profile every year.3) T has begun an aggressive share repurchase program which will take advantage of the low price to earnings multiple in the stock price.4) T expects adjusted EPS to hit $4.65 by 2022 at the midpoint.5) T expects to pay off 100% of the debt issued for the Time Warner acquisition and end with debt to EBITDA of 2.0 to 2.25 times by 2022.6) T expects $31 billion in free cash flow at the midpoint by 2022.7) T has guided to use between 50% and 70% of free cash flow after the dividend for retiring shares (over 3% annually) and expects to retire 70% of shares issued for the Time Warner acquisition by 2022 (about 750 million shares).Assuming T hits their target of $4.65 in 2022 EPS, shares appear too cheap. Even if assuming no multiple expansion, then they arrive at a share price of $49 in 2022, or approximately 15% total annual returns over the next three years. Assuming T sees multiple expansion to 12 times earnings, shares would trade at $56, or approximately 18% total annual returns.Source: Seeking Alpha"
"Looks like the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner is turning out to be the ""catch of the day"" and a future goldmine for AT&T revenue/profit growth. No doubt in my mind it will break the $40 barrier before the end of this year. With a 6% dividend bonus deals like this don't come along every day."
If deal doesn't happen T will sky rocket. If deal does happen T will climb slowly after market sees benefit.
it will be the largest media company with it's own content.
"If the market would value AT&T telecom assets the same as Verizon, and AT&T media business the same as DIS, and it's streaming business the same as Netflix, AT&T would have a trillion dollar market cap."
I posted a link to the accomplishments of the President of the United states and it gets blocked. Yhoo screening is off the charts corrupt.
"“We made a mistake in creating the void,” Cuomo said Monday, referring to a lack of public information that opened his policies up to questions. “We should have provided more information faster.”how to you get to murdering people in nursing homes. having the worst per capita death rate from covid. not using a huge hospital ship or javits center, continually lying and deceiving.......to creating a void? maybe steroid chris and c n n can help you out"
This should be up moredue to HBO Max to Roku Right?
"@g K: you said it! I gotta get more shares, too. Come on “weak hands” where are you?"
"Just at the door of 30; looking good, in fact, I’m thinking everything’s looking good today. GLTA involved/ stay safe."
Thank you BP for the big red days at the end of last week. Gave me a chance to sell the Mar 26 $24 Puts for .88 each. The T trade was good but the BP trade looks to be the big winner. I really like the oils here!
Biden is gonna print $2 Trillion covid stimulus.. Another 5 Trillion later to boost the economy.Where is all this money coming from? It grows on TREES. YES!!!
"Where does AT&T go from here?Did not slow down to even take a breathe at $37. Testing $37.50 again and with the tax proposal passing, I figure we will get another push tomorrow. This will make the manipulators very happy. The price will continue to go up throughout the year and should test new highs above $42 by mid 2018 after the tax cuts go into effect and we see in one quarter what it does to the bottom line. The second quarter that comes out in early August will solidify the results and we could be looking at not only a higher price but also a higher dividend.."
"The fact that the current liberal media squelches and censors any opposing comment in what used to be a wide open discussion forum, speaks volumes as to what the current liberal media is now about."
"Dividends will be cutting, HBO Max will flop, and T will go down the gutter. At least you guys have 5G (cancer causing technology) to fall back on! LOL!!!!!!!"
I think Forbes just said it's worth $50.00 and I guarantee it will will hit50...
Clearly GG is a paid Verizon/Yahoo employee troll. Deleted my post and unmuted himself.
"As mentioned this is a sector decline, not a T specific decline."
"T is going to do ok.Did you know that the Chicago Crime Commission said that there are 150,000 gang members in Chicago alone and that they outnumber the police there 10 to 1? Do you suppose the numbers could be similar in other large metropolitan cities? What's going to happen when the Dems start reopening the borders and defunding the police? Hmmmmm A few things to think about today."
The Feds announced they will pay $50 a month to all low income people to have internet service . This means every American qualifies for free internet service if they could not afford it already!!! This is huge!!!!
I have a few questions....They are simple questions. Why is Elon Musk investing heavily in ExxonMobil with his personal $ Why do that if you believe EV's are so great. Another is why is Disney Executives buying into AT&T? It's their personal $ but why are they doing this? Things that make you go hmmm.
HBO is closing in on its 50th anniversary next year. Seems like most everyone who wanted HBO pretty much had it.Amazon Prime...just a baby. Gotta admire their streaming model build. It looking like genius.
"Don't worry, this will drop like a concrete block from the 10th story soon. It always does."
Stop falling for analyst pumps its a debt ridden #$%$
It is very simple. AT&T owns CNN. Right there they lose 50% of their potential customer base. They need to stay OUT of politics. And stop gouging customers with mediocre service and poor equipment.
"T's 5G monster is ALIVE LOL,LOL,LOL"
Berkshire Hathaway takes stake in Verizon and Chevron. He likes both sectors he said. Should be a Catalyst for AT&T.
"yo, cheetah,question for youI have a bunch of ATT bought at different times at different pricesI think you use Ameritradeif you sell covered calls, do they give you a way to specify which lot of shares your covering the trade with?in other words, can you specify which shares would get called away?Fidelity doesn't appear to provide me a way to do thisI assume they would just use the FIFO ruleit makes a difference for tax planning"
Anyone get their dividend payment yet?
"Understanding T investors they are in for the dividend for income to live on.. Getting paid over 3 times the 10 year T bill is something most dream of.. T investors get it every 3 months. T investors look and wish T would fall because it lets them lower their cost. Most have more money to buy more shares on the drop. Why does the drop not bother them? Because most are never going to sell and only buy more. For sure there are not many investment that would be better that T if you never planned to sell and only buy more. FACT, Plus to top it off T has now built and new business that no one company can compete with in the future and the future for T has not been this bright sense the first phone was made. Get ready to break out you shades because T is going to shine."
CNN is the highest rated and most watched news channel in the world. Period.
There's the news everyone's been waiting for.
You can’t beat this stock. High yield and growth potential.
How can T not avoid a huge 4Q impairment charge on Direct TV. The auditors have to be all over this; the price T paid for Direct TV and carried on the books; vs. the low bid prices to take the asset debt off the books. Watch out!
"Upgraded by Tanisha, Jerome, and Tyrone"
"T's 5G monster is going to eat the competition why it's still ALIVE and moving WOW is T's 5G monster going to grow LOL,LOL,LOLLOL,LOL,LOL,LOL Going to rip parts off them one bite at a time . LOL,LOL,LOL Man is this going to be fun to watch T's 5G monster grow"
Was reading the conference call transcript and only saw 1 question about DTV. Stanky's answer was difficult to understand and very vague. I was wondering if anyone else heard or read the call and saw anything about DTV that would be useful to know.
Hanging on for dear life thanks to the ex div ramp up...then we all know the drill....
Oil will be at $60 any day now.
"Lohr Interests Inc.; managed by Matthew Lohr, adding 10,000 sharesof T, to their portfolio. I am buying 1000 shares of T also."
When is the Buy the rumor mini pre ER bump gonna kick in :)
Over $33 by end of this week would be nice
Should I hold ? This is by far my largest inve
We should easily break out of the $32 range to $34+ with any good news at all tomorrow on Analyst Day.
"Alright folks, first time poster on T board. I bought 100 shares in 2013 and 100 shares in 2015. After dividends I have 300 +/- shares. I'm up a whopping 28% since 2013. Can someone give me a compelling reason (especially with a dem in WH, which is typically anti-dividend) why I should hold onto this thing?"
"Cut my losses on at&t on 12-22-20 and put the 40k in jd stock which is a China communist country stock but at least they admit they want destroy the US , wish CNN and AT&T would admit it. But until that happens, I have made 15% in 2 months."
"Think about where this is going. Warner today announced an end of Pepé Le Pew because he inappropriately made advances by kissing the arm of cartoon women. This from the Warner that gave us Sex in the City, Hung, Rome, Boardwalk Empire, Got, R.I.P. Cathouse, Westwood, Game of Thrones and many, many more.Does Warner’s ouster of LE Pew suggest Warner is now finding religion. How can AT&T tolerate the hypocrisy. Is it even fixable. We’re living in different times where past deeds are exposed and there comes an accounting."
"Thank you, Rush. You rest in peace in heaven, away from the violent and criminal fascists here. You were a true hero, a true American, and true Americans loved you, and still do."
"Here is one for you , you want to make 17 % plus return on you money with low risk , Sell the Dec 17. 2021 put $17.50 strike on VTRS for around $3 . VTRS will be over $20 and paying a around a 5% dividend , Free money"
Another great buying opportunity!!!!
"U.S. SEC charges AT&T, executives with leaking information to analystslol"
"@R It's Elliot I tell you, it's Elliot. All these dark shares being traded back and forth. Who's going to pay all this Debt off? It isn't going to be Verizon. We already won the best frequencies for the auction. So who's going to pay all this debt off? It's gonna be YOU, SON!?!?!?!"
TMobile down over $6.00 right now. (4.50%)
"AT&T is an awesome steal, 7% div with some major catalysts that people have been ignoring that that will be driving up share price.GM is a similar opportunity, possibly even better, raking in serious profits, massively reducing costs while having in my opinion the industry's most advanced AV platform in Cruise which Microsoft eagerly joined forces with, gaining some ownership as well as forming a strategic alliance to use their expertise to facilitate the AV capabilities, possibly the most advanced EV battery, at least advanced enough that Honda reached out to GM to assist them in provided batteries and tech for the development of two new Honda EV automobiles. GM has a third subsidiary which it owns, that being BrightDrop which has developed and already has a massive contract in place with FedEx to provide them with EV delivery trucks, contracts in the works with others as well. Each of these subsidiaries if spun off, especially Cruise AV would be valued greatly than GM is now, Cruise is currently valued at $30billion based on the private market, 80% owned by GM with Microsoft and Honda also owning a share.Massive upside in both AT&T along with GM"
AT&TCheetah thinks its funny that I don't know much about Options. I think it's even funnier that I make a little over 118K per year in Dividend income and don't need to play around with options gambling.You'd give ANYTHING to make that kind of mailbox money. Have fun scrambling around with your little options tables. HAHAHA!
This stock is like a clock. LOL (sad really)
CNN is fake news by fake journalists. Project Veritas has real journalists and news.
Get rid of Fake News CNN and stock will recover.
"Which is more likely? $30 +, or $28-$29?"
"I think T is still being held down due to the merger - uncertainty with courts, dilution of stock, merger integration costs, debt, etc. Once there is more clarity, T should be trading back to its equilibrium before all this merger mess started which is around $40. There is no way VZ should be trading at such a premium over T. I dont know why T hasn't announced massive cost-cutting yet from the merger. Maybe its for ""political"" reasons as the ruling is held up in the courts. The market likes massive cost-cutting, which is a no-brainer for T."
As a T share holder what is in it from this spin off? I have a 1000 share of T
All this SEC stuff happened 10 years ago.
anybody else always have trouble logging into Ameritrade? can't trade because streaming quotes not available is the second problem if you do get in.
 T has Morning Wood
From seeking alpha...The company has the pieces in place to transform the business but seems too anchored to traditional ways of operating...Really? SAME DAY PREMIERS? This is traditional? HBO MAX is the Cadillac of streaming!
T is doing well. slowly growing which shows it isn't being pumped.

"If ATT was only run by someone that wasn't a BELL HEAD, just think how much we could have made?This company has been debt ridden, for the last 40 years!T Mobile is racing to clean up its balance sheet and has resources available to expand.Losing the government business proves it can't compete.It just keeps rolling the dice and betting on the come."

Rather disappointing swoon! What gives?!
"How could anyone look at the graph of T and think, ""hey, I think I'll buy that one."" Omg, what a disaster."
Impressively bad management!
Rise and Grind!
Go T!
Looks like T is building a new floor at $30.
Got more stock in the pre-mkt - now it’s time for - writing calls...
$1400 should make the robinhood/reddit traders happy. The Govt should give everyone $500/mo Food tax credit to account for the food price rises. That would be nice.
Per a 13f filing￼ why would Elliott management buy 5 million shares back of AT&T? Are they going to play￼ activist again with AT&T management?￼￼ maybe they know something we don’t!￼
"It's hard not to be under the water if you sat in T for long enough. Either just get out and call it a day or you will continue to face the same problem every now and then. It all started around Year 2000 was the starting of T's down fall. With 2 full decades of data of continuing decline, you can feel pretty confident to say that the Downtrend is intact and will more than likely to continue downward from here."
It doesn't matter how much the FED prints. T is stuck in the mud spinning its wheels.
Member MUTED!
Stock price tells you what mkt thinks of ER + cc.
"-5% for the year -22% for 5 years just facts never recovered from DTV screwup. IBD truth hurts. A $20 stock so many other better buys right now,"
"the real test for HBO MAX will start June when they go internacional if they are going with the strategy they have in the US they won't be successful not every market is the same, anxiously waiting it's launch here in Portugal (Europe)"
Haven't see a close over $30 in a while
"Pre market already in red and back to high $28’s. Should be interesting to see how today goes. Earnings and revenue down YOY, but some positives too. Growth in cell customers, HBO and HBO Max subscriber increases, dividend coverage in high 40’s % for 4th quarter and 55% for 2020, so dividend is s@fe."
Shorts covering buying stock take profit!! 
David....thanks for the daily lol........what is your game plan here?..........T has been in the $25-$45 range for the last 25 years.......do you really think anyone on this board is doing anything but lol at you.......it's time to focus your efforts somewhere else..........just some friendly advice........
Out at $30.30 back in at $29.77 happy enough
We are up a penny in post market. Going to try and make another run for 30 this week??
S ome thing else for anyone retiring soon you might be better off taking Social Security than living on you IRA and 401k money . Social Security you can not leave to your Family but you IRA and 401k money you can all up to you want what you want to do. Just some thing else to think about before you retire or you can just blow it all and have the DEM wits take care of you. Some have that plan already.
