Recent headlines and conversations for T
Isn't T heavily shorted? I guess no luck for a short squeeze in T but overall hanging in there today.
only took trumptards 5 yrs to figure out they have been conned.#stayinschool
HBO max is expanding to South America and Europe in the second half of the year apparently. This seems like a huge deal with massive upside. Is this priced and factored in? Seems like a lot of potential in this part of the company alone? Great library and content and will apparently fund local/country specific content too. Is the debt the main thing holding the price down?
Averaging down to below $30 to 29.xx I know it will get up to that at least one day. Then I’m ok to sit on it for however long it takes collect div and sell covered calls in perpetuity. Make 10% per annum is ok with me even if my principle is locked up in bag holder ville
Let's see..another day...markets up - check. T-Mobile up -check. VZ up - check. T - down - check.
I will buy back at $28 or lower
So who is short this stock?
"Time to look for yield. The average diversified bond portfolio will yield 1.3% per year over the next 4 years. If AT&T’s payout is safe, the stock is going to $46. :-)"
"Smart money are beginning to take profits from banks incrementally, following banks and oil in recovery telecoms are one of the next in line :) I’ll be looking forward to next week to see if we start to break out of the range. Happy hunger games"
After the spin off T will be a lean mean awesomeness providing machine?
is the interest rates going up???
Max at 57 million and climbing keep climbing... this is eventual 5G revenue are growth engine. We will have roughly 14B new debt for spectrum which sucks but needed. Hopi g the reach a deal to sell satellite division (yes huge loss but that is a sunk cost).
Going long...
Time to rotate into the value stocks...all of them..not just T....
"Dark Winter coming for T=Trash, Decade Old Crash, Mountain of Debts, Old School you name it. Will be lucky to close above $20 by end of 2021."
Announcing the sale of Direct TV would push this stock 5 points immediately.The current ratio is now .80 which means the dividend rate is now tenuous.Telephone is extending labor contracts now hoping things will change in the meantime.Telephone's dividend is not a given anymore.
March 19th will be the most watched trial since OJ Simpson...AT&T should have the law on its side.
How dare these state governors keep these business closed or limited in numbers. They love the power and should be recalled / voted out ASAP.
"All the shorts and T haters are the same thing and boy they have been trying and crying today to get T lower and it just will not go LOL,LOL,LOL"
Don't worry once the next earnings report comes out it will show T has been taking customers away from VZ and T mobile and T will rocket higher as both TMUS and VZ have massive drops
"wonder how far down we will be after today,yea big red"
FED printing press will go into overdrive once the S&P hits 10%. Bond yields rising will be cut short by the FED buying up excess bonds (yield curve control in latin).
"T is a real Value Stock, losing 29% of its value in 5 years...., so after dividend it is approximately 1% annual gain. Even T-bills do better, with lower risk."
"No one say a word about T being manipulated by Wall Street LOL,LOL man you just can not make this stuff up ."
"Dividend growth investors were just told by Sankey that they dividend won't be grown any further until 2025 at the earliest.Put your money in MO. They are going from $ 3.44 to around $ 3.66 in July, all on PROFITS."
"T stock is in a long term downward move.Will bottom hopefully Late March.Target price for T stock is $17/share.Suffering from fierce competition, heavy debt and declining fundamentals that are apt to become worse in 2021."
"in 1914, ATT was a $121 stock, with an 8% div yield"
"The other day, when I first started to post on this board, it was difficult to find any worthwhile information as the board was filled with political nonsense. But thanks to the efforts of our real investors on this board, people who more concerned with making money then bashing others or spreading loony conspiracy theories, the political #$%$ has been reduced allowing pertinent information a little easier to find. Many thanks to those with the courage to do the right thing by deleting the hate filled post. And of course thanks to all the others who have taken the time to share their knowledge about T which adds value to this board. I don?t have all the answers and I don?t know all there is to know about T. That is why I am here. To learn from you and to contribute if I can. I see this board as our office. It?s the place where we do business. That?s why it?s important that we keep this site professional and save personal and political comments for another location. Our goal should be to help each other to make money or, at the very least, avoid losing money. Otherwise, why are we here?"
It is probably just about that time when the shorts start posting questions about the dividend being safe or not.Every quarter same thing over and over again
hyperinflation! now what!!silver and gold hedge? long oil?
Show your dividend gains people. Let’s see some examples
T at decades low and the CEO says nothing...
Sold premarket! Nice gain people. Wait for it to drop back to $28’s to buy again. Rinse and repeat.
"AT&T preferred shares an option? Pays nearly 5%. If they cut the common share dividend, the preferreds would be safe. Seems like the way to play T if you are in it for income."
What would T stock price be worth if they break up the Company into a telecom and an entertainment Company? How much value would be potentially realized from the spin off idea? Thanks
"Bunny Ears and Blu Rays are the wave of the future with streaming services price hikes. Look 3, 10, 15 increases will send customers clipping the cords and moving back to home grown Blu Ray collections and free over the air wave tv."
Nice stock right here lol.
long term the business looks good to me. Buying a little more as I am a small fish but refuse to gamble on #$%$ like btc or gms.
Good luck trying to steal customers from all the other cell carriers after you choose to take sides today. I will not give any of comcast any business ever again
Making money with T...preferred. lol
I think we'll close above $28.50 but below $29 today. Most of the Calls that expire today are the $29's and higher.
"T is trading smack in the middle of its 52 week range. It pays a great dividend and will see price growth as it broadens its revenue stream out of its 5G investments. When this monster starts to run, there will not be enough negative comments on these message boards to hold it back. At that moment, you will say, I let another great one get away. This is great opportunity to get paid great returns while positioning your investment in an under valuated stock with great ROI and price appreciation potential. There are sooo many horrible investments out there that I would never buy. This is not one of them! If it runs to 50 that is over 70%. Also, I'm bullish on energy."
"@ Anthony, I post the close sometimes because Yahoo is 15 mins. behind the 4pm Close, don't be a wise guy."
The virus is mutating faster than vaccines. New California mutant more dangerous and more infectious. This is not over.

T needs to spin of Warner
T probably made the best of the situation with DTV. It is a tough decision. We will now see how it does in the next ER.
Nice breakout on heavy volume. Clear path to 32. Safe haven in this tech wreck.
"Friday, everyone was panicking about bond yields. The FED stepped in today and everyone is happy again. The FED runs the whole PONZI show. Inflation will be Fixed LOW and bond yields will be kept LOW. This will remain true for the forseeable future."
"Are you kidding me?? T beats on all metrics. HBO Max has close to 50M subs - thats there 2025 target! And, the stock gets sold off. We need more Bull-side analysts speak up, and leadership to have the courage to talk up the share price. Enough is enough."
"message board poster ""cheetah"" ""cheetah 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9"" are all fraudsreport abuse and check off ""does not belong here""keep this kind of trash off the ATT message board same as the GE message board did to ""cheetah"""
"Washington, D.C. attorney general sues AT&T, alleging overchargesGee! And ATT so much wanted Democratic control of everything?Be careful what you wish for ATT."
This is pure manipulation apparently surrounding the 29 put/call.
ATT will go bankrupt soon. Future is $TMUS
Nice Jump.
Long term holders are not worried one bit of either decision.
"LOL,LOLSpartan55 and all the T haters get to SAY OH NO up T goes as T is now higher than it was last Friday LOL,LOL,LOL"
https://nypost.com/2018/12/06/justice-department-not-happy-after-att-time-warner-hearing/This article details why the doj appeal of at&t tw merger is not likely to be overturned...this should give investors confidence...
"VZ is now running off customers and shareholders all going to be coming to T, T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX is picking them up in droves . So all the T haters get ready to SAY OH NO up T goes , LOL,LOL just wait when the next earning report comes out . T is now Taking customers away from T Mobile just not as fast as VZ is now driving away LOL,LOL,LOL"
Management just will not allow SP to move higher.They have sandbagged the great Q4 results with low forward guidance.And they will get a bonus for that!
What are TSHAREHOLDERS ?BAGGIES !
YOU SEE T IS going down. profit taking is showing signs of weakness. fair value for T is 25 dollar per shareT is overpriced!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I read all the post and see 1 thing, that we are all in different boats, young investors looking for value, wrong stock for that, and long term like myself, over 23 years, around 21K shares, long time now paying off. I don't care if T stay's at 30 Bucks forever, that means it pays the Div. and Recoups it every quarter, 11K cash a Quarter, 44K a year, CASH, Roth IRA, Tax Free. Key, keep the Div. and Recouping It. Easy for Me to say, start now and Reap the benefits later, Its up to You, Plenty of other stocks for value, This is all about the dividend."
I bought 1000 at 28.11 and every quarter since then I have collected 7.4%. Sorry if I can't feel bad about that.
time to buy before it goes back to $38.
Drumpfs legal challenges.
"of the 4 major telecoms VZ, TMUS, and sprint can be considered as more purebred telecoms. by that i mean their source of income is derived primarily from the telecommunications industry. with the closing of the merger ATT is morphing into more of an ""internet of things"" company. 30% of its revenue and earnings now derive from the merged partner time warner and that % should increase even further as ATT competes in the ad space market with facebook and google. ad space on the internet and premium content both have far better growth prospects than the traditional telecom industry whose growth is pretty much limited to the population growth rate the result will be a stock that is 70% cash cow and 30% growth stock.....perhaps moving to a 60/40 ratio eventually. i think the reason some big investors want to get out of ATT is because it is now a one of a kind stock and not a pure representative of the telecom industry. it just doesnt fit into their spreadsheet even though they did the right thing with the merger. if you have money you have to spend it....put it to work. if ATT can draw down debt, realize synergies and expand access into its new high profit margin markets its a 50 dollar stock. easy."
The market rally’s to all time highs and poor old T can’t even get a bid. Terrible waste of investment opportunity
good buy for someone looking for retirement income
T is like the guy that's permanently benched and never gets to play...because he dropped the ball too many times.
"As Lt Bill Kilgore said: "" I love the smell of SHORTS burning in the morning""!"
"I see ANDY deleted his post talking about BP again, probably didn't like my response. But guess what. I copied it so here it is again. LOL LOL@ANDY Hey, thanks for warning me about the dividend last August. I took another look right after you said that and decided to sell. Took a nice $20,400 profit from that one and sold it exactly at the right time. Oh glory days. The only thing I should have done was to buy it back when it dropped down to $15 again. If I'd have done that, I would have banked another 40% profit by now! Appreciate the help ANDY, now go crawl back under your rock again! LOL LOL"
Also note last time T crawled near 40 Cramer didn’t call it a buy until ~ 38
"Buying , Buying , Buying keep them doggies buying , Better look if you sold calls against your shares , because we will be taking shares before the dividend more and more everyday. Look out on Monday there will be a flood of new money into T"
Don't know whether it's the Zack's articles or the VZ news or something else but this is pure BUXXSHXT!
"the Apple event from last week has me Bullish on the AR sector, specifically two stocks that sell AR as a product, NEXCF and IPNFF, both are just beggining , AR will become mainstream, GLTA know what you own"
The CEO of AT&T calls for no growth in sales for 2021 T stuck in the 20s for years
Dividend to ZERO = stock to 50+ in 5 years. Only people who wont be around in 5 years would rather have 10 bucks in divy instead of 25+ in share price.
Seeking Alpha says T is winning the Streaming War
"1700 more shares at 29.72, what the heck."
"“AT&T is far better off with higher leverage and more spectrum than the reverse. It would have been a colossal mistake to underspend in this auction. None of the carriers can do without 3 GHz spectrum.”Recon Analytics principal Roger Entner said that if AT&T needed to incur more debt, “now is the time to go into debt, especially for spectrum they really need and with interest rates so ridiculously low.”Entner said that based on disclosures in its most recent earnings call, AT&T’s entire debt portfolio is currently subject to interest of around 4%, after the company refinanced a lot of its debt to take advantage of historically low interest rates. He also thinks AT&T might turn its Bank of America loan into a bond sometime during 2021. “This is like a bridge loan,” said Enter. “I wouldn’t be surprised if AT&T turned this $14.7 billion loan into a 30-year note.”""https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-secures-14-7b-loan-probably-for-c-band"""
"Thank god we got past 30,hope stays past that."
29.50 today? T usually closes at or near a strike price on Fridays.
I just put in a limit order for 500 shares @ $29.00.glta
"We need to move forward as a Great Country no matter what You Believe or what your Opinion is, who You voted for, who You like and dislike, You need to watch the first 45 minutes of Saving Pvt. Ryan, what those men went through, For our great country, A wise coach once told me, We looked out the windshield and not the rearview mirror."
Good day to bail out.
$30 today sweet
The wife wanted to rent wonder women here in Canada they wanted to charge $30 fin dollars can you honestly believe that .Also should I not get a discount for being a long term T bag holder
I’m new to T. Can someone tell me when they pay dividends?
"Crossing my fingers here but T seems to be highly controlled by it's options. Think, as in the past, it will close @ 29 making the 29 option expire worthless. What do you think?"
Closed .14 off day's high. Not bad considering.
THE ATT DISHWASHER REPORT...IT WAS MY GREAT PLEASURE DOWN ARROWING MANY OF YOU. BEWARE YOU MAY BE NEXT. 10 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER. T IS DOOMED LEFTIES. THANK YOU.
Will be 33 in days
"I told you months ago that XOM was the call and got laughed at. XOM was about 40 and T was about 30, LOL."
All these RINOs in the GOP will be looking for jobs at CNN. None of them are going to get re-elected. Will never forget
LUMN was up 25% today. I could not find any news to justify the move. I know this is a different forum but I wonder if anyone has any info.
Finally got out of T at the high of the day. Now to find a stock to reinvest this cash in. Maybe a cruise company. They will have nice upside once the travelers hit the high seas.But the T is History. RUFF RUFF!
"For Anonymous's benefit I'm going to try copying and pasting information from the conference. Let's hope they don't delete my post. NO GROWTH in 2021! Here it is:2021 guidance unchanged. AT&T’s 2021 financial guidance, announced in January 2021, is unchanged on a comparative basis. For the full year, the company continues to expect: Consolidated revenue growth in the 1% range Adjusted EPS to be stable with 2020 Gross capital investment in the $21 billion range, with capital expenditures in the $18 billion range 2021 free cash flow in the $26 billion range, with a full-year total dividend payout ratio in the high 50’s% range."
"I guess you guys' gals' didn't see my reply post to @James this morning when he said a bad word. I guess no one thinks everything they say doesn't have consequences. Everything is logged folks so if you get in trouble some day guess what happens. They have it all on tape. Now it becomes about you, son. It's the same thing w fb and twtr they have everything logged just for you. ha!"
"Mo pays 7% div, making money to support div and went up 8$ per share in month's. And does not support cnn."
Definitely looks like $25 or below is coming next.
"G was Zappoed by my friend Chettah, I like Zappo better then Mute."
Fun fact: You can make quite good returns on T by buying below 29$ and before Ex Div Date and selling above 29$ and collecting Div. Because this thing is not going anywhere above 30$ soon with that debt. Just sayin'.
"Hanging in with what I have, and collecting the dividend. Maintain a little patience."
"Ignore the noise. Look for performance numbers in key growth areas: Fiber, wireless, and HBO. Expect wall street to zero in on any negative item: lawsuit, debt, satellite. Use any weakness to add to your position."
"Fed govt. replacing their fleet of vehicles with Electric. Add to that the cost of a huge number of charging stations. All more spending of money we don't have. Another brilliant idea by slow Joe, kinda like Obama's cash for clunkers. Fiscal responsibility never even enters the small minds of these Dem wits."
"AT&T is not for trading.. please, if you have to manage trading AT&T because of divvy date. You should not even considering the stock...I think long term wise, T stock will go up.."
I’m glad to see AT&T is back to normal trading at a loss every day again.
Red in a sea of green. nflx up huge
T announced a delay of their Hogwarts Legacy video game until 2022. Any comments? Does that mean anything to anyone? Does anyone care?
Wow! Almost 41m shares traded. Wow!
Some stock we have here lol.
HBO Max ad during NFC championship game looked good. If I didn’t have Max already I’d be signing up.
Gotta short Quantum!! look at the value with a 4 yr wait for a battery??
Whats the difference between $30 Trillion and $40 Trillion debt. I don't think it matters at this point. May as well increase the debt by $10 Trillion and make everyone happy.
When does hbo max go global?
RACHEL FOX WILL BE WRONG ABOUT T.
"+21% since Dec 24, +1.61% payout tomorrow... Any non-expert predictions on what April 24th earnings release brings?"
@VZ I think I officially drove your guy @R crazy... oh well we'll see your call on Friday then Mar 12. Questions I would ask 1. Who pulled the trigger on Tom&Jerry Jason Killar? 2. Plan for 5G Spectrum since you got the Brunt. 3. What about share buybacks 4. Layed off 1000 workers from WarnerMedia are they coming back? 5. What about pepe' le pew that's been since 1945. 6. Who's pinning the stock @ 29
"If you are long T just make sure you place long term sell orders for all your shares a good place to start is over $60 but any higher price you want for your shares if ok , What it does is send a message to Wall Street they are not going to get any shares cheap and the more long term sell orders there are the higher T will go , Why because sooner or later you find people that have had their shares lent out to be shorted and their broker either has to find shares for them or recall the shares that have been shorted So place them long term sell orders and sit back collect the dividend and watch T go higher and higher . Have to wait a year to get long term capital gains away ."
"Hope you guys bought the dip. I know I did. Closing in on 1,500 shares :)"
Some stock we have right here lol.
"Direct TV is awesome! I don't understand why anyone would put it down. It's way better than cable and now We have HBO Max which is significantly better in my opinion than Netflix or Disney. Direct TV rocks it and HBO Max is by far the best. AT&T phone service wireless is very good too, in fact, why do my friends with T-mobile get no signal with T-mobile and have to borrow my AT&T phone to make a call or data on our camping road trips...Facts."
By the end of the year the market will be down at least 30 percent from here
"Never seen a more Hopeless stock than T, Even GE goes up quite alot recently. T just straight down south without any struggles."
Remember T will be fine and you don't want to sell for a year for capital gains anyway They may sell the news on T because of the massive write off T is going to have to take again . Just make sure you have some cash to get more always plan ahead
"Indeed T is the worst dog out of big caps with enormous amount of debts, not to mention it's getting too old in the teeth."
Where are the Activists? Why arent the Activists calling for replacing Board members? This stock should be selling at $40 based on any metric. Criminally undervalued. C'mon now!
why is this dropping on a 500 point up day
"To all the T haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL Why because T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades"
This is like revenge of darth ...becz it stayed less then 30 for so long ..lot of folks shorted 30. This move is non trivial..35 here it comes in a flash.
"Finally, AT&T stock itself trades at a low PE ratio. Also, due to expectations surrounding the stock, the company will likely increase the dividend soon despite its generous yield. In short, a perfect storm is forming with T stock, and it appears positioned to rain growth and dividends on new investors."
how is c n n reporting on the cuomo disaster? do they even mention it?
New DirectTV entity should get DISH valuation.
What is he talking about? Hey man.
Only T could close @ $ 29.99.
If you have not gotten your shares just make sure you pick some up on ny pull backs and lock them up with long term sell orders over $60 to start. T goes ex dividend the week of April 5-9 2021 and you want to lock in the dividend before the ex dividend date
"We learned 3 major things over the last 10 days , Is the power grid can not take any more electric cars at all we still have 13 states without power from a little storm that could not charge them at all , Just think if all the police , fire were all electric how screw up the DEM wits plan would be. We also learned how to kill off DEM wits just turn the power off and they will kill themselves and the 3rd is what a very big mistake Joe did by stopping all drilling and cancelling the pipeline. Because in the future you still need oil , The best plan is to plant trillions of new trees to replace the one that where cut down and causing the climate change and to fix the power grid so it can handle more electric cars , But also make sure we still have oil in our future because it will always be needed"
Under New Management
Why is Moscow Mitch holding up $2000 checks anyone know? Its not like he is worried about the deficit or anything. Its just MEAN.
"T is in the hands of arbitrage investors and short sellers. Will calm down in a week or two and will move up. T will grow into a very attractive growth plus income stock, IMHO."
Getting worried about this stock. Not moving when market is recovered. Street not confident with dividend?
"LOL,LOL,LOL All the T haters get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
Blowout employment number means US economy is strong and will keep humming in 2019. This means T will easily make the $ needed to pay debt and dividend and that we will likely see another increase in the dividend for 2020.
"Time to reboot the Harry Potter Movies! Forget 150 million, subs, HBO Max will be well over a Billion! T stock going over $150 by 2025!"
Only Sara at CNBC is worth watching. Her and her cute shinny nose.
"Down, down and more down in T stock near term future!!"
What happens if time warner is reversed on appeal?
I canceled my DIRECTV service today therefore the value of the deal is not $15 billion it’s going to fall apart it all hinged on the number of people that were subscribers and since I canceled it’s all collapsing in front of you.

Why do people listen to Powell to worry less about Inflation. Inflation is FIXED. It will stay fixed regardless of the prices of things.
Why Bitcoin will keep going up. They don't make many more Bitcoin. Simple Supply/Demand rules.
I don't own at&t but have been looking for yield but not sure if the dividend is safe and the chart is not looking good
Powell will say Inflation is under control. Doesn't matter that prices are up everywhere and will continue to go up. Inflation as measured by the PCE deflator is controlled.
Exactly like I said rallies in the morning especially short the stock and they bring it right back down to cover every single day and it closes in the red at a loss
"Back in the $28s.This is a real plot twist, didn’t see this coming,"
I bought 1000 shares this morning @ 31.87.6.3% yield. Nice.
Why the move today? do you think some firm will come out with a good report? or maybe they purchased some good airways for 5G.
Mike muted!
Only up because of defense against market drop.
AT&TTotally exposed now that Ex-Dividend day has come and gone. 27-29.50 for the next 3 months.
"The telecommunications giant landed on Wall Street’s “Naughty List” in 2015 after its $49.5 billion acquisition of struggling satellite TV provider DirecTV.Three years later, AT&T added CNN parent Time Warner for $85.4 billion along with the famed Warner Bros. film and TV studio and cable networks such as HBO, Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT. CEO Randall Stephenson made big promises after both deals that failed to come true. As a result of the transactions, AT&T amassed $152.9 billion in debt, the most of any company in the world, which continues to weigh down the company’s stock price."
"not much interest in this stock, 0% after hours"
"Here it is, all laid out for you: Why AT&T is a $60 stock and how it will get there. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE-JLzOyV9o"
Emphasis by Kilar about ad supported HBO Max is a good catalyst. Lowered price for the masses to dramatically increase base and subbing the revenue with ads unlike the cheap sludge by Disney.Good Move.
What’s T’s latest bid in the auction?
got another 100 in AH. Thanks for the cheap shares.
Imagine missing the biggest bull market in history stuck in T for the Div while its share price does nothing for a decade LOL. Its like waiting behind the old folks at 7-11 trying to pick the right scratch ticket when you just want to get your drink and go. Do old people hate money?
What about them being in trouble with the SEC? Anyone concerned on Monday?
"what is the purpose in telling strangers how many shares you have or how many thousands your dividends are , i only talk to my wife about it on rare occasions"
No follow-thru in aht.Not good.
"Strength- telephone  Weakness - DEBT  DTV  Opportunity - HBO MAX   Threat- Choe Briben’s Corporate tax hikes, dividend slash, complacent management."
"although I keep T for the dividends, I am still happen to see a green day."
BULLISH ! ! The hbo originals line up for this summer and fall is gonna drive subscriptions. Taking profits from other trades and putting into this blessing. Divy over the next 2 qtrs pays for my patience! BULLISH
"The 5G auction has surpassed 80 billion $ and , in my opinion, way over priced. T-Mobile, VZ, T, and others, will go further in debt just to acquire more 5G, mostly mid band. Not sure is worth it although every competitor lusts for more 5G. Forget about low band 5G, not much faster than 4G. May this this is why T did not increase the dividend in Jan 2021....need cash for the auction. Will consumers pay much higher prices to get 5G service ? Not sure. Regardless, winner in all this are the Feds selling the 5G airwaves at auction."
T 50 day moving avg is about 32.12 and the 200 day is about 34.60. Now as time goes on here the 50 day may climb above 200. This is the beloved golden cross where big volume will come in to the upside. All procrastinations will then be put aside.
"Signed up for HboMax on Roku... I can tell you from being a NF, Prime and Hulu subscriber too... HboMax is the cadillac of streaming!"
"""no-life"" Cheetah is on a roll today. He's averaging about one message every 5 minutes since this morning.Pitiful loser that he is."
"If you are not buying T here, hand-over-fist, you really do not understand how to invest. You buy a BlueChip like T with incredible/systematic and subscription businesses and market opportunities like crazy. You don't whine and complain or complain about a low stock price. Many people who are negative on T shouldnot even be investing in the market. One can easily discern that they are not qualified to be investing."
"(Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. is making good on its promise to tackle its $171 billion debt load.The telecom carrier is refinancing outstanding debt by selling senior unsecured bonds in as many as two parts, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The longest portion of the offering, a 20-year security, may yield around 2.375 percentage points above Treasuries, said the person, who asked not to be identified as the details are private."
Brutal....gald I did not do auto reinvest....bought today instead near it low

"Market has been good of late, however T has not been participating. I guess until some really good news is released, that's gonna be our fate for the time being. One thing that assuredly should give the pps a boost is announcing the sale of Direct TV. It's a loser; ain't ever gonna be a winner and has been a drag on earnings ever since the ill-conceived move to buy it. JMHO, but T should take whatever it can get for Direct TV and just move on. Still hoping movie and TV production can get back to normal, and soon. Unlike Direct TV, slowdowns in both of these areas is solely due to COVID-19 safety concerns which will eventually be gone. Keep the faith. Ain't gonna be kissing $40 any time soon, but a 10%-15% rise to $30+ should be doable. GLTA."
Market will be up Monday. No way they dont sign an agreement. Plus great dividend and growth now with hbo
"I give up, why."
T had to write down DTV value ahead of a sale. Thing is when the deal is finally done there will most likely be another mark-to-market loss. They knew a long ago they were carrying trash on the books at an inflated price. They also know Warner Media isn’t worth its current book value. An honest mark-to-market reckoning would likely reduce T’s book value to the point that rating agencies would downgrade this load to JUNK.
What would be neat is if the Govt forgave all credit card debt. Its about $1 Trillion much less than Student loan debt.
You think T management would at least try to make CNN profitable. Nope! Same management same horrible results.
"Churchill looks like they might be teaching a deal on directv according to speaking alpha , yes the purchase by t has been a disaster but going forward we need to get something from it. I am more concerned w sky high spectrum action now eat to be at 70B ... still believe in T and long but ouch"
Afternoon T ~ stock is dead money folks sad but true
"Jabberwonky, how much you down today bud? ROFL"
Hard to ignore this div rate.
glad i covered my short position last week.
Rodgers is a choker like John Ellway and Peyton Manning.
I am slowly exiting my position. Left organization with a lying media
"Two questions, one based on the other:1. I always thought that beta is a measurement of price volatility, and if the beta is below 1 that means the price moves below the market...yes/no? 2. If a person is looking to short a stock, wouldn’t they be looking for a higher beta stock than T?I’m a long term investor and I reinvest my dividends so I don’t mind a lower pps. I don’t have a pressing need for the money I have in T. I guess what I’m saying is I don’t understand a lot of the chatter here about pps. Not criticizing anyone, just wondering. Thanks"
"AT&TLOL, so many wanted out over 30/share. See ya in the high 20's next earnings."
Still early- but my outlook:5G + PPV (pay-per-view)=$$$ -and a solid growth path!
Everything across the board is currently down from yesterday. Ships wise and fall with the tide. Look at this as a gift.
Slim window to get a good deal. I just bought 6000 at $29.65. They should announce the dividend by the end of the month and I wouldn't be surprised to see it raised a penny or two thus sending shares up above $30.
If you have not put a sell limit order on T @ $100+ you deserve to have a hedge fund short your stock with YOUR MONEY. Protect your investment against the brokerages and short sellers. Have a great day and protect your LONG position against the shenanigans!
HBO Max with Ads coming in June. Will be less priced than Premium. These targeted Ads will make T mondo cash. This is just the start. Once T integrates its Cell phone's with targeted Ads watchout.
"AT&TLet me tell you about a real lowlife named Cheetah, who used to post as Cheetah3 until I mentioned that he was using the name of a Strip Bar in Atlanta. He then changed it. He also swore up and down that he owned T stock, but it's clear now that he was lying through his teeth. He's admitted he's 80ish years old and he is everything you would not want your son to ever be."
"Stop complaining. If you don't like T, move on."
Getting close to closing above $30. 2 mins more.
Where is the volume? 21M shares not going to get it done
When is T going to declare their dividend?
Somebody wanted in badly in the am. Accumulate
Forgive $10K of Credit card debt. That will help a few people.
"who got the better deal ?Warren Buffett during 2008 crisis, when Goldman Sachs was struggling, paid 5b$ and got 5b$ preferential stock at 10% coupon And about 3-5b$ ( or zero, if the the stock had stayed under 115$ ) worth of common stock .TPG is paying 1.8b$ for 1.8b$ pref stock at 10%coupon, 2 seats on the board of 5, and 30% of common stock in new DTV valued at 16b enterprise value ( which is low anyway you cut it when you compare to Dish )"
"LOL,LOL,LOL look at all the T haters that have egg on their face LOL They are all saying OH NO look at T going higher and higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Once every 60 days, it is green, lol."
why i oughta....
Besides the results of the 5G auction is there anything else coming up that can move the share price?
"Elliott Management initiates stake in AT&T, raises Dell and exits eBay"
"TStankey just told you plainly that growth won't occur until AT LEAST 2025. I don't see them paying out 15B per year in dividends over that period of time, which would be 75 Billion in Dividends over that time."
"Good bye AT&T TV Now. T has given up on it.Was another T media that did not work very well. Add in DTV, and T has not made media work well for them. Let’s hope HBO Max plays out well. Should know more about subscriber growth at Jan 27th earnings release. Meanwhile, T plods along. But hey, we still have the dividend. Please T, don’t screw that up."
T is the place to be atm with upcoming slowing growth in the economy
Robert MUTED!
Can someone please advise date of next dividend payment?
Been buying T since 2015 its my only losing position with 33.17 average.I get disappointed alot but then I think that this is a insurance play in my portfolio I have no doubt in my head that some day it will hit 40 may 5 10 15 year.And I also have no doubt in my heat that for the next 10 years it will be paying me a good dividend.Just letting it Drip and waiting for it to go up when I might need it more!
Is the congress kangaroo court still in session today? MORONS
The only reason Kudlow went to Fox is because CNBC said NO THANKS.
"It's a $55, possibly higher. It's a very good Dividend and Growing 5G and the Leadership Team of Streaming. I personally enjoy all of it. MY opinion Pers"
T will begin to move up towards ex-dividend date
Another unit sold. More money to pay down debt. Good moves but anyone’s guess on price they got for it
Why oh why does T never hold a good gain.T is such a disappointment and their management is forever silent. I really hope Elliott Management is back!!Go Elliott!
"People just can't get past the debt this company has even though the weighted avg rate on the debt is like 4% and most of it matures way off into the future. We're talking when most of us will be dead, 2050 and years like that. LOL"
"Peter, Not all of their debt is in bonds. A good portion of their debt is in bank loans which can be restructured, and most recently were resulting in longer tenors and lower interest rates.￼"
"Finally, Main St gets a bailout -- President Joe Biden signed a COVID-19 relief package worth nearly $1.9 trillion into law on Thursday. The legislation includes $1,400 direct payments, a $300 weekly federal unemployment benefit until September, additional money for parents, funding for a national vaccination program, and billions of dollars for state and local governments and reopening schools."
we have all lost money with ATT. dividends increased by percentage. but the dividend is not enough to payback loss of principle.
Just bought more with the divvy. Easy money.
"XOP, OIH, and XLE were this weeks top performers all > 10% . “Dirty” energy for the WIN ! "
strong sell
"they say buy on the dips, but with T every single business day it is a dip."
T is going to be up 3% afterhours and more tomorrow. Better buy now at historic prices.
One year ago it was 39.06
Nice stock right here lol
"The big dividend, everyone hates it stock buy over the past two weeks was XOM, not T.That's not to say T won't have it's day with a big analyst upgrade like XOM had. But I don't see that happening until at least after the auction."
To think this stock was more in April 2020. T is a goner. Looks dreadful.
"LOL all the T HATERS are going to start crying when T goes higher and not lower . LOL,LOL You just can not make this stuff up . LOL,LOL So get ready to say OH NO up T goes"
Wonder when they announce the 5G auction results.....I would guess some time this week.
T is looking old and getting dumped everyday for years. I'd get out and get into something with real growth instead of declining every year only find its Debt is the only thing going up.
BP is getting WHACKED today. One of Cheetah's recommendations.
"Remember I have been doing this for decades and the hardest thing to learn is patients grasshopper and Wall Street are sheep that only follow the herd to the Slaughter. For sure if you are late in the herd you are the one to be lead to the slaughter. How did that work out for the sheep to follow the GME herd LOL,LOL Slaughtered."
come on Robinhood T needs your help. most hated stock in the s&p could turn into the most loved with your help
There will be a nice trade tomorrow by buying at the low here today. Always a nice rebound the next day after a panic sell like today.
You just KNEW the JO's would push below 29
OH MY !SELL In EARLY Pre MKTPRIOR To EARNINGS !
"Warner assets being underestimated, HBO Max is the Cadillac of streaming while Turner Sports/Bleacher Report are the only content players other than ESPN in the most explosive new industry of legalized sports betting"
"Judas and the Black Messiah...A grand slam for HBO Max! A tad bit hard to follow, but the best premiere so far this year."
Leftard Phil is happy his T investments is up by another penny. Keep pumping it Phil.
Agree with Bob - 50 % of the people on the other side
"I told you bottom 28.40 , I’ve profited mega today. Keep holding while T outperforms the whole market"
"Look on the bright side, still up 27 cents from yesterday. (Looking at you Red Equal aka Debbie Downer)"
We were green pre-market for awhile...now red.
On a positive note: your portfolio cannot only have winners. You need a laggard like T too to be grateful to your winners even more.
"I did bet on Brady but I would have like to have seen what the game would have looked like with a healthy Mahomes and at least a 2nd or 3rd string offensive line after losing all their starters. As it was, the Chiefs were playing with an offensive line comprised of 2 undrafted free agents, 2 7th round picks, a guy picked up on waivers after no one else wanted him and a guy who signed at midseason after he was released by the Steelers. With a line like that, Mahomes had no choice but to run like heck all day on his injured turf to try to avoid getting killed on almost every play. It wasn't exactly an even playing field but that's life in the NFL."
let's see all the negative news. Price Target $34. over 7% dividend. HBO Max launched at all platform. Selling Dish. paying down debt. Still Cash Cow. T stock look like a winner to me
T gives me a nice 0.52 dividend then proceeds to drop by an additional 0.75. Remind me why I bought this.
"Now it seems that Democrats are trying to strong-arm ATT into dropping news channels they disagree with. In a letter to Stankey, they insisted ATT drop Fox News, OAN and NewsMax. I'm sure the Biden/Harris apologists here will scream in support. What 1st Amendment?"
check out the 3 month T chart. note the number of times bounced off 28.50. another retest coming?
"Verizon should tank far more than T today with a massive 44B increase in debt, but it's only down a percent. All these numbers are worthless and the only thing that matters is trust in management. T has none."
"I had to laugh at the post that said AT&T makes a profit of 40B a year. They are currently 190B in debt and want to borrow another 14B to buy Spectrum 5G. If you read the forward PE of T, it is around 9. I don't believe it. This stock is in a downward spiral."
T. The stanky ho of stocks
Only thing up in my portfolio right now.
We're on a winning streak let's keep it going. Cause T investors are winners !!!!!
"$T bag holders anonymous meeting in session. I’ll go first...My name is Kevin and today I’m thankful for the rest of my portfolio and how it carries my $55,000 AT&T bag. It all started very simply, just a guy looking for “high dividends”. A Motley fool article here, marketwatch article there, and before you know know it I’m $10,000 into $T at $35 (1%) of my powder. Woah! Fat dividends feel good coursing in my veins. I hardly cared that the share price was eroding, it was slow and this was a “blue chip”. It will get better. Before you know it I’m averaged down to $30 and in for $55,000 less than a year later. (Man sob crying in hands) Ok all jokes aside I’m not selling just gonna collect and wait. If you’re stuck any position $T seems to be an ok prison"
Get ready for a probable 'Beat' on Wednesday- consensus: .73 - 'whisper': .75. It was already mentioned that 'wireless was very strong' -as well as 'free cash flow' target!
VZ is raging in after hours trading
One year downtrend still intact. 20 year downtrend still intact. Elliott counter trend rally is all gone. He bailed after getting an inside sniff.
People completely lost confidence in this trash after over a decade of continuous Decline and Free Fall. T-Trash is on its way below $20.
"I don't get Tesla. I mean, they make a car. Okay, a different type of car, but basically a vehicle that takes you from one place to another. Nothing new to see there. Dunno about the rest of you, but having to wait an hour to re-charge vs. maybe five or so minutes to fill up at a gas pump is a big turn off for me. Plus, what's the range on Tesla cars, about 250-275 miles. I can drive over 400 miles on a tank of gas."
Imagine Direct TV linking up with Elon Musks satellite company for urban internet access
XOM Morgan Stanley Raises Target Price To $71 From $60
"Stephenson just plainly told you that there will be no revenue growth until at least 2025 and IF everything goes right, HBO Max will break even then.I sold at 30.57. Did you?"
at&terrible how are they still at 20 dollars this is a 8.00 stock at top You Go Puts people
I just cancelled my Netflix since it is more expensive and has worst shows than HBO. I don't see where you can find this much yield and future long term growth in HBO. T is an absolutely great long investment.
Low volume across the board today. Everyone must be watching the super boring inauguration. What I don't understand is why they have to show it on every doggone channel. I can't even watch the real Wonder Woman with Linda Carter today.
"anyone have idea is management does implement stock buyback as they are indicating will do to stock price, big bump or not much?"
T has been very good for shareholders of other specifically the target companies like Direct TV and Time Warner. About time it took care of its own shareholders.
"34,000 shares traded in about 1 minute or so in pre market"
C'mon Joe. Let's have the $12k stmulus. And the reparations. And free health care. And what about my UBI?

"big news from unnamed sources within trump's doj says that the sprint, tmobile merger will go through because america needs 5g competition. this has a lot to do with trump's personal biases and very little to do with the law once again."
Why did Elliot Mgmt. purchase T stock? Their investment this time is much smaller than before.
$T is a #$%$ up After other #$%$ up Friday being sued by the SEC today their most anticipated movie got leaked and switched instead of playing Tom&Jerry Zack Snyder Justice League played there instead i mean can't $T hire competent people?
Buying Opportunity!!
T stock going up soon. Biden say he going to give all illegals a cell phone.. this is sort of like Obama's phone. Your taxes will go up to pay for illegals: cell phones; health care; food; rent; schooling. People buying stock have a lot of money. They can afford to pay more in taxes.
"There would be many benefits to an NBCUniversal-Warner Media tie-up. For instance, A merged studio of NBCUniversal’s Universal Pictures UVV and WarnerMedia’s Warner Bros. would control 30 percent of the worldwide box office. It would also have tentpole franchises including DC Comics, Harry Potter, Fast and Furious, and Jurassic Park.The companies also would be a force in the TV business."
"What are dividend investors doing here? They shouldn't care about price swings, they should only check every 3 months to see if the money arrived."
I love it when the market is way up and T is down
Wow this company sux 
"So many salty shorts on this board, same people who have 100% of their portfolio in companies without a P/E ratio. I’d like to see a group phot of these shorts, must be a sorry looking group of people."
Target is $29. Not buying plenty of winners to chose from
Wowzers......two inside days in a row down volume pretty low..selling exhausted?
How often does the T dividend pay out? Thank you.
I thought the Government Solutions Unit was a good thing for T to have with all the money our Government puts into security. Hope they got big bucks for it.
Love the Bonuses for employees!
"The money I pulled out of T went up 4% today, may not hold. And I no longer support communist national network (CNN)."
Some stock right here lol.
Could end today at $29. Fingers crossed.
"Apparently, lawmakers are seeking information from telecoms about broadband availability to the underserved. Lawmakers might be considering an aid package to make available broadband to low-income communities. Which could also mean T might get reimbursed for delinquent payments. Just my take on this."
Lot's of sellers lined up in the low 30's.
T is going down. a lot of people are leaving direct tv and att cellpne and one of them is us . T MUST go down to 25 dollar that is the right price for T. it owes billions of dollars in banks..
Bought more on Friday for under $28. The stay at home work should benefit T. Have signed T fiber 500 Mbps rate and works well. Will accumulate slowly 300 shares at a time. Good luck longs.
"Hack dividend investors bought this and missed out on the huge gains, smh."
"Goodbye $30 my old friend. The way people were talking I thought we’d never lose you again. Lol joking, I loaded puts at 30.35 and am smiling."
Is today the day we finally hold a gain?
Sell the propaganda machine CNN to Bezo for $20B and the stock price will jump to 20%.
ATNT is very steady even when market goes down ATNT goes up it’s nuts
"The total cost per share of all my shares over the years is now 34.08. But I've received 18 divdend payments, so my cost per share is now just about $ 25.Dividends are powerful over time."

"Yes you can sell today and get the dividend , But for sure you will miss earnings and the pop higher."
yea thanks for the big push above 30
AT&T should change company name to “Under 30 for life”
"way to go T i knew you wouldnt let the green meenies get you lol. down again,whats that 9 or 10 days in a row ,i lost count"
This is some stock lol
"Buy 4000 share today price low 28.40, good buy T price after div. 28.41-.52=27.89"
"Is the market up?If NO, AT&T stock is down.If YES, AT&T stock is down."

"The company reported a net loss attributable of $13.88 billion, or $1.95 per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31."
"I held this turkey too long and recently closed my position. AT&T should be a winner, but unfortunately, in my opinion, is not. All it takes it to watch CNN (owned by AT&T) to see it plainly. Under AT&T ownership, CNN has degenerated from being a respected news reporting organization to its current state as a left-wing servant of the Democratic party. If AT&T management cannot insist on integrity in news reporting, I doubt it will succeed with other enterprises. Consider General Electric under Immelt."
Cramer panned T on the Lightning Round tonite.He said that there is no peace-of-mind for T shareholders.
I would like to buy some att stock because of the 7% dividend. I'll wait until cnn fires Don Lemon.
"One thing @R did get right, when he speaks of T-Monster it's more like T-Debt. Add 170 Bln to another 20 Bln for the C-band auction. This is money they don't have!?! Who's going to pay all this off. It's from your dividend increase, son... Read 'CNN Disinformation's' Post from earlier post. It took about 35 minutes of reading but you'll learn a lot. Whoever put that together was very accurate... They wanted to re-name HBO to MAX and do away w HBO, but that fell on def ears..."
What do you think is the best stock moves you can make for the next 10 years? For Me I picked up some shares of T under $31.50 today 7/19/2018 with dividend reinvestment and some GIS yesterday 7/18/2018 at $43.05 with dividend reinvestment. Let me know what stock moves you would make.
I’ll never understand why so many people come to this page to talk about how they would never buy this stock. Why are you here then? T is a good dividend stock that you can play options on at certain levels to make quick money.
Jen Psaki wears the same clothes every day. Shewww wee.
HBO Max subs should skyrocket in Q4. Commercials everywhere. Very aggressive w/content. Need to sell DTV to Dish & this stock will be at $40 before you know it.
"I remember Stephenson, after buying DirecTV, saying that 1.8X is the debt ratio AT&T needed to feel comfortable......they are now targeting 3.0X for this year as Stankey just said. That is not good, based on their very own definition."
"AT&T Is killing there stock and company. Thats how I feel. Stock is only good if you picked it up at $27 to $28 and with the great dividend. It like waiting for your spouse to change and they never do, same repetive bad behavior."
VZ you have until the next earning report before you get slaughtered better learn to sell any moves higher in VZ why you still can As VZ and the yahoo NATZI's now run off customers and mostly shareholders
Open at $24 tomorrow ...Good luck longs
"Phil I can’t see you, but I just wanted too remind you that your crystal ball  is still broken "
absolutely NO WAY HBO gets 150M subscribers...EVER
"A lot of people have been holding AT&T stock for decades; for many the foundation of their retirement. If this describes you, then by all means hold. T's dividends will pay better than any bond you might buy. For everyone else, AT&T is a classic value trap that should be avoided. I'm not going into details, but AT&T's fundamentals are quite worrisome, with the stock price slowly sinking for the last decade; I doubt this will change."

i am bullish on $T but they need new management in the Warnermedia their movie studios is completely falling apart they have a good brand that can compete against $Dis/Marvel but they are running into the ground if they want money they shouldn't be buying a war with the fans I'm sorry but I am starting to see a lot of red flags on Warnermedia

"I don't think I have ever seen a blue chip company like this, whose stock is so unbelievably weak. It is like some fund out there has about a billion shares they want to sell, and it is going to take forever to do it. It has been nothing but sideways and down for a year. Will sentiment ever change for this thing,? Worst performing stock I own bar none. I know, 7% yield, got it."
"Best, thing that ever happened to, T, was movie theaters shutting down, allowed AT&T to shift to streaming their most valuable content"
Is the price going up to capture the up coming divi?
Everything flows downhill.
Sold T 7 days ago. Bought TSLA and sold this morning. Pickup T at $28.60. Got more shares and made more money. I think earnings are going to be great this quarter along with good news about selling DTV.
Buy the dip!
"TBy the way, Cheetah used to post as Cheetah3........Cheetah3 is a Strip Bar in downtown Atlanta. He's a great human being.......80ish year old man using a strip bar for a screen name. That's the quality you get here on Yayhoo."
Looking like T is going in right direction! Let’s hope HBO max will give them Good numbers! Go longs !
noticing T bulls not posting much TODAY out partying the victory of a. person unfit for office
Lots of muting today! It's a wonderful world!
Sadder. Stock price is now about 3 dollars less than it was 3 months ago. :(((
The poor saps that bought this last week will regret it this week.
"Will this stock ever get any traction, day after day underperforming the market. Pure torture"
"Remember you need DEM wits without a brain or you will never get stocks on sale and OH Boy do we have one special DEM wit without a brain in the White House now LOL,LOL,LOL"
"This board is hilarious! T is not a trading stock. You buy, hold and collect divs. It doesn’t matter if the stock trades at 20 or 40. T holders only care about how many shares we own, not the stock price. Traders and shorts will never get it. They’ll sit in front of a computer all day stressing over loosing or making a profit everyday. Longs relax, add shares and enjoy the yield."
@R Now you have Paramount+ debut on March 9 to clean your clocks bye bye R
"I switched from my expiring AT&T 300 Mbps fiber Internet to 1 GIG yesterday. My old promo rate was $50 per month. My new promo rate is $60. Since I just started my final month at the old rate, I should be billed a ""make-up"" $10 on my next bill (2 months at $60, paid as $50 and $70). Instead, my new summary of charges shows that next month will be $90 and then $60 moving forward. I called AT&T, but I couldn't convince the person in Mumbai that $90 is incorrect. Why are Americans are losing STEM jobs to H-1B visa holders???"
DEMS win the market goes up. Thats because Dems are good for the stock market. The FED will print MORE.
"I’m 15 years from retirement and have never had any bonds in my retirement account. Bought yesterday at 30.17. This is more than double the ten year bond rate. Even if it goes to 29 in the short term, I feel very comfortable in collecting my 6,7 % yield and then eve naturally selling at about 40. I also predict that this will be at 37 by year end. Recognize this stock for what it is."
Good night all. Let's see what happens tomorrow.
Is there a law that prevents T from staying above $30?
"I know how to bring this company up to $!00 per share in a snap. I sell all my ATT shares, then I use all the money to buy VZ shares. Within minutes of doing so, VZ will drop to $10/ share and ATT will zoom up 50 to 60 bucks per share!!"
Share price getting pummeled in pre market. Guess it was all about 2021 guidance of rev up 1% vs expected up 1.5%.
All bad news and no good news priced in. A purchase below $30 is a good buy any way you look at it. Will be trading at 35 to 40 in 2021.
TMobile just took a $1.60 dive in the last hour.
"The one thing you learn when you have been investing for many years is to look for companies that make changes to make the company a better company in the future . It is never about the past and always about the future and the changes the company is making to make it a better company in the future . Most have blinders on and can only see the past not the changes that are being made for the future until the stock is already up 50% and some YAHOO like Cramer is telling you to buy or sell after it's already moved 50% LOL,LOL,LOL you just can't make this stuff up . LOL,LOL, LOL"
So if I understand this since AT&T is in the wireless data business and subject to net neutrality laws they are at a disadvantage to competition like Netflix and Disney plus ? You can stream Netflix and not have it counted against data ... correct? Thanks in advance for any input
T…Any one have noticed their landline phone bill increases nearly 19+% this month? Probably management using the extra profit to partially fund the cost of 5G bidding war.
"Big movement made last week. Great volume, and new blood buying up shares of T.The rockets are lit, and the countdown has started. This baby is heading to the moon. Get on board before you miss it, and it will be your loss."
28.50 USD is ok to buy - personally I hope it can go down to 26.50 USD again (strong buy at that level)Likely lower end of the spectrum : [28.30 USD] - anything below [27.00 USD] BUYNo advice - just my opinion
So excited for more Nuclear power plants ! Clean energy for all ! What could go wrong? 
"The highly anticipated pre exdividend run up has fizzled out.As usual, T can't hold any gains.Not surprising but very disappointing."
Thinking of selling all my shares!
"If you could figure this stock out, You must be related to Houdini."
"Total Return is something T investors must have never heard of, smh."
I just have to keep posting this because I think T is one of the best investments for the next decade. Share price is near a 20 year low and this company absolutely prints money. 7.5% divy with 50% SP upside? yes please
"The sun came up this morning, that's how I knew T would be in the red again...."
What is the word? Why is this share price so low?
Anonymous became the new John Granville The world will not end Will put him to rest now he could change his name to Mr. gloom and doom of 2021 Mark my words fortunately I am bullish on telephone Love the dividend always did and I am stone DEAf to all those who have been predicting a cut.￼￼￼￼￼￼

"Lots of people talking about hbomax numbers and what the co will or won't say about them. But I think the point that gets missed is that hbo numbers are greatly nuanced. There are millions of subs out there who watch hbo via cable. Of those, some have activated what is a ""free"" hbomax sub....free meaning no addl cost to them and no addl revenue to T. Then there are truly new signups paying full boat. And then I believe there are subs who had hbogo and were given ""free""' hbomax. Just saying that how all this stuff gets counted and conveyed to the analyst/investor community is important. Said in a misleading or unclear way, it could be harmful. Properly conveyed in an understandable fashion and with positive trend data and the stock should get a really nice boost. As always, jmo."
sweeeeeeeet 1st dividend and 3 more to come. love it
please stay in the 30's by COB next Friday

The next ex-divvy day in coming up in April. Take your positions.
I love how this supposedly 'safe' stock is by far the worst loss in my entire portfolio.
With the way rates have dipped the last year this 7% yield is currently 14x the one year cd right now. This is the biggest no brainer stock I’ve ever seen
Me thinks that today is the day. We close above $30.
"OK the panic knee jerk reaction selling is over. T is not necessarily a huge buy low and try to sell high type of investment. The company is solvent. It pays a wonderful dividend. It is part of my core portfolio as I coast into semi retirement. Getting about 15,000 a year in dividends and am very content with that. All you nit bashers and wannabee day traders that think you are making money fiddling and jumping in and out with a few hundred shares are nits"
"If you bought T 1 yr ago, you are down over 24% = $8.85 loss add the divy and u lost $6.77 = 18%. If instead u bought SPY, you'd be up 18% excluding the 2% SPY divy. Hmmm. loss of 18% or up 18%. Which do you prefer? 36% difference between the two."
"Stock ran up last couple of days because someone is expecting to hear good news on analyst and investors day Friday, March 12 all aboard we are going higher￼"
"It's time! It's time for the highest rated and most watched news program in America...The Rachel Maddow Show. The show for intellectuals with understanding beyond bumper stickers and headlines. Doctor Maddow will enlighten your senses and bring breath and depth to your understanding of current events, under currents, and motives of the players making news. I only wish AT&T owned MSNBC too! Enjoy!!!"
don't buy high in March.
Reasons to own AT&T:1) Price is a spring board right now. After appeal is rejected lookout for $402) Div yield high and safe. Can wait for price action while getting paid to do it.3) Growth prospects: 5G will add many millions of new wireless devices.4) Growth prospects: Netflix competitor platform launching next year.5) Growth prospects: AT&T is increasing international presence. 6) Inflation hedge: AT&T has very high pricing power (as all wireless carriers do). They can increase prices easily to match or exceed inflation. Higher inflation as we are witnessing is great timing for the debt side of the balance sheet.
"Most hated large cap on wall st. Stodgy management has not learned how to market the company. Conference call was a boor fest., Down almost every day. It looks so bad I am almost tempted to add to my position. It seems when I get this discouraged it usually signals we are somewhere near a bottom."
"Appears there are 2 R's on this board, LOL,LOL,LOL you demwits!"
"So many broken charts. Time for reset. Stay nimble watch for new trends too emerge. Gl everyone, I still see upside in CL "
anyone know how many shares Elliot bought this time ?
"Analysts don't like this stock. Not sure why. Company keeps making money, raises dividends, buys more companies to make even more money. But the analysts keep telling everyone reasons why it won't work etc. and the company keeps proving them wrong. But all that negative talk does convince people to sell. But if you like a safe company with a nice dividend you should thank the analysts for letting you get it at bargain process."
just remember that 9 days ago 130 million shares of this stock sold between 33.78 and 34.24. nine days before that 49 million shares went between 32.84 and 33.42. volume is starting to pick up from august but notice that high volume days trade on the uptick. it looks like some entity or entities with a lot of bucks are buying in heavy but they are buying smart. after the price gets to a certain point they back off for about 10 days and wait to see how far it goes back down. intelligent accumulation. someone with a lot of money is buying. im thinking either vanguard fund or black rock.
I think this a great buy here. added a bunch
We need an Activist to step up. This relative underperformance is borderline criminal.
"Sold shares back when cnn was running hit pieces, most trusted name in news my ..."
On Thursday Moody’s credit service said that the sale of the 30% of DIRECTV is credit positive. They gave no indication that the dividend is in jeopardy. In my opinion the stock is a buy and we will see a rebound in price this week￼￼￼￼
"I got in at $41.69 because I liked the dividend. I am a firm believer that T will come back, and in the meantime I will collect the dividends. If I can scrape together a few thousand dollars soon, I will pickup a few more shares. Good luck to all."
How much did the Direct TV fiasco cost us ?
Actually surprised how well it is holding up. Could have been much worse
As usual buy 28 range stand pat over 29
Wow.... T is negative the day before you need to hold for the divi. Just think when the dividate is here. It's going to really fall.
#$%$ Good news and couldn?t hold a decent gain.?

"Cohen comments: Warner Media spin-off???""Cowen suggests WarnerMedia/NBCU spin-off and merger in list of media/telecom surprisesJan. 04, 2021 5:49 PM ETComcast Corporation (CMCSA)By: Jason Aycock, SA News Editor32 CommentsA Cowen note looking to potential top 10 surprises in media and telecom has a suggestion for a truly newsmaking outcome: that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) spin off and consolidate their media arms, merging NBCUniversal and WarnerMedia into a single giant content-focused entity.That would leave parent companies that could shift their focus toward connectivity, the firm suggests.That's an outcome for which LightShed analyst Rich Greenfield has argued before, saying it's time the companies ""abandon the fool's gold of vertical integration of content and distribution.""As it stands, Cowen rates each of them Market Perform. It has a $34 price target for AT&T (15.5% upside implied).J.P. Morgan expects some improving wireless subscriber trends at AT&T alongside increased retention spending.

"I'm glad I rolled the Feb 26 $28.50 Puts to the $29's yesterday for more premium. My overall premium by selling those Puts on Jan 29 and rolling them higher yesterday is now .96 per share. If the stock closes lower than $29 on Feb 26, I'll have the stock ""put to me"" and I'll have to pay $29 for the shares. If that happens, I'll immediately sell March 26 $29 Covered Calls which are currently selling for $72 each. As the price of the stock rises, the price of the Calls will rise with it and the Puts will drop lower. If the Puts drop low enough I will also have the choice to back them back a lot lower than I sold them for thereby closing out the trade with no more actions needed. I'd get to keep the net premiums at that point and I'd back back starting over selling Puts again."

"Based on the rise in futures and the positive data re WW84, T's pre-market share price appears to reflect a view that the overhang of an expensive auction is more influential on price than the other two.....at this point anyway. Would be nice if T makes a statement when the time is right re the auction that reassures investors on the balance sheet."
"Interesting results from my survey. Three times I asked for a Thumbs UP if you think T will continue to move up from here and Thumbs DOWN if you think it will start dropping back again.The first time I asked the question was yesterday when T was up .70. I got 15 Thumbs UP and 9 Thumbs DOWN. The second time was yesterday as the stock was dropping. I still got 18 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN. The third time was today as the stock was continuing to drop. I got 3 Thumbs UP and 8 Thumbs DOWN.It was obvious (at least to me) that T was only up yesterday in sympathy with VZ which was up strongly because Buffett had taken a big position in VZ. Yesterday I posted that if it wasn't for VZ, T would probably done nothing (as usual). But the ultra bullish longs here, who see every up move as a possible breakout to $40 no matter what the reason, thought otherwise and strongly voted that T would continue to move higher. Later as the stock was dropping, they continued to strongly vote that T would continue to move up. Today, after a very weak close yesterday and after a quick and fairly good sized drop this morning, they suddenly changed their mind and voted strongly for a reversal in thinking and a drop back in the stock to $29.To me, this shows the general mentality of this board. Way too optimistic at the slightest sign of a green day and a general confusion in thinking when T turns red again. I don't think many here have the capacity to understand how, why or what it takes to move a stock in either direction at any particular point in time. Further, most here are more inclined to form an opinion based on emotions alone rather than thinking through things and forming a more logical conclusion. But there's still hope. Take the time to learn what you're doing rather than just jumping to conclusions based on your ""feelings"" and you'll be a lot more successful. Just my opinion."

The C-band auction is already at $70 billion. It will restart in early January and maybe continue into February. No one saw it going this high. It’s a must for T’s 5G. Verizon and T-Mobile are in much better shape. They know AT&T must keep bidding. They gonna use the auction to inflict as much damage as possible. T’s been hoarding cash but this is way above and beyond what anyone saw coming. Let’s see where T’s long term debt ends up 2020. It’s going to be far higher than 2019 with still more to come after the auction.
OOPS couldn't hold $30. SAD.
"just read an article from a credible source evaluating T. Article indicated out of the telecom sector,T is rated last and was T a buy currently? No. Advice was wait until 2022 to buy T regardlessof the high dividend. Reasons; high debt, earnings declines, DTV issue., etc. Stock needs to stabilize"
"My girlfriend asked me if AT&T because she loves HBO Max could go to $100 plus a share. I honestly answered maybe $50 but We are this for the Dividend and Long Haul. Committed. She's younger than me, and wants it now ."
at $40 per share I would be satisfied with a %5 dividend yield....it's only a matter of time
"I'm an options trader. Haven't bought/sold equities for years now. I'm trying to help non-options traders by disavowing the ""risk free"" and other bogus claims of some on this board. So here's another one:When the price of a put/call has moved against them, they sometimes say, ""no matter, I'll just roll it forward"". But what does ""roll"" mean? I'll tell you. It means buy back your position at a loss and go sell another one. Again nothing wrong w/ doing that - it's just for some reason they never make it sound like what it is: closing out of a loss, and opening of another position."
It gets a upgrade but the price goes down it has to be the short sellers keeping the price down
"“Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan upgraded his rating on AT&T to a Buy from a Hold three weeks ago, setting his price target at $32. This implies upside potential of around 8% from current levels.Louthan points out the difficulty in finding large-cap value names and given that AT&T shares have been heavily shorted, Louthan believes that investors could benefit from a mean reversion in price.Consensus among analysts is a Moderate Buy based on 6 Buys, 4 Holds and 2 Sells. The average price target of $31 suggests upside potential of around 4% over the next 12 months.”"
try and figure this out......little tiny pee see schitzo freak cheeto puff is a short seller and an options trader who uses you shareholders with his BRAGGING self-centered fraud......do yourselves a big favor by deleting and muting him from this board......good luck with T

Up a penny...Beats a poke in the eye
"It’s possible an odd result of moving DTV and those other operations into a separate company is that the free cash flow attributable to that operation is no longer as readily available to T even though they own 70% of the new entity. Therefore, I am now a little more worried about a dividend reduction."
Hey all you robinhooders all you stashers and all sniveling 20 something year olds. If you are here and I doubt that would be many if any. You are making a wise choice for your future.

Buy yourself a future and get some of this or maybe go and buy 5 shares of BA and then a few KO. 30 years from now when you are 55 and sick to death of the everyday grind that is your life you will thank me. Just a small tidbit for you to consider. Buuuut you probably will not listen because your generation thinks they know more god.
"The question should be,What does ATT feel about its stockholders?"

"T’s not just leaking to analysts. Everything is leaking. It’s a sinking ship. Amazon Prime already has more content than HBO, plus all the other benefits.

As they came through the front doors SHE says WE DID IT and Ask for HUG. Who at CNN knew this because she was staged with him before the riots in the Capitol? The riots led to Big Tech removing Parler creating a firestorm of free speech backlash. Dropping the values of stocks by billions. The investor will come after CNN, Twitters users removed will come after CNN and if the FBI might come after CNN. Why does T own CNN.

Let me ask again. Thumbs UP if you think T will continue moving up from here and thumbs DOWN if you think it will be dropping back again in the next day or two.The last time I asked was earlier today when T was up .70 for the day. There were 9 UP thumbs and 5 DOWN.
@fiscal...well answer the question then...
Not bad
QS UBER KO BB going to pop  making runs 
Yikes. C-band auction total just hit 66 Billion dollars. That is insane because the articles I read that are only two days old and had the total at 46 B. Another 20 B increase in just two days of bidding. Here is link with current total. This auction has too many bidders whose future depend on getting a lot of spectrum in this auction and it is pay up or be perceived as an also ran in 5G. Pre-auction the highest estimates I saw were 51 B. https://auctiondata.fcc.gov/public/projects/auction107
Why does Zacks keep posting negative comments about T? They keep posting their sell rating. I hope they meet or beat just to shut them up.
"T the 7% CD. Range bound $28-$29 but a 7% dividend. T mgt said 1% growth in 2021, so buy in $28 range, expect minimal growth, and collect your 7% dividend. Treat it as it is....a good paying cd. Trick is, buy low and keep until eventually goes to $31-$32 when dividend rate falls below 7% and sell. With the current T management, will never be a high flyer."
Big selloff in the markets today yet ATT is as stable as a mountain of granite.... (with a 7% dividend)....
"If T is dead, why did people buy 190 million shares of this stock today?"
"This could be the correction we were waiting for. 7%, maybe 10% max."

Woo Woo Picked up .54 per share (net) in Jan. and another .71 in Feb. by selling Puts. So if the stock closes above $28.50 on Feb 26, the Puts will expire and I'll get to keep the .71 premiums free and clear. This is like legalized stealing!"

"Reading lots of commentary about much safer alternatives to make 7% + yield....my broker has been doing research on that same topic......and nobody has made any alternative suggestions yet. Don't buy T for growth.....forget that....buy it at $27 for income with almost 8% yield and take the divvy for the long run. Anything higher in the stock price is gravy. Who knows, HBO Max and 5G could even push it up to mid 30's in 6 months. Even if a correction happens buy more near the bottom with a higher yield."

"T is not the typical growth product company. They need to grow the number of products not just keeping the same number and raise prices every year. When are they going to have a WW type block buster hyped flick release each day of the year? Don’t hold your breath. They are too set in the seasonal release mindset and with the onset of streaming that dog is too old to chase game. Get out the wallet boys, it’s time to ramp up production #’s, not just prices. HBO max is a model change not a production increase. Just in case someone wants to bring that up."
Next week we will see 33+. Just have patience. I am long with 200 shares and a bunch of calls :-)

"BA a hated stock at 52 week highs, what does that tell you? It tells me if your sitting trading T you might want to rethink things........"
way way way undervalued.
This will be the stock people run too when they realize the ridiculous prices being paid for all the others
This is a Strong Buy!!! Enough said.
"One's view if T as a stock entirely depends on when and why you bought your shares. My current 2000 shares were all bought in the $29 range and barring marjoram change they will just sit in my Roth collecting dividends, tax free. It is certainly NOT a growth stock, at least not at this time. I feel badly for folks who bought at $35 or more. I did flip some shares once but sold in early 2018 at around $38.50 but can't remember what I paid but it was a bit less. So fo0r me T has been a steady earner and I anticipate that it will remain so for the long term."
I guess the extra debt with 5G spectrum purchase is very problematic. Dividend looks in serious trouble.

"looks like Viacomcbs is coming for the kill although I don't seem as bigger player but they will land a hand to HBO MAX by taking its content from Netflix, Netflix internacionally where it's a major player will loose 50% of it's catalog so those 200 million will be dropping Viacomcbs is taking its content, Warnermedia is taking its content, HBO MAX internacionally with a great marketing team and campaign and a competitive price can go head to head with Disney+"
Must be too much static in the line of this stock...
Hello fellow bag holders. I am thinking to sell this stock. I cannot watch HBO or make a phone call and being reminded of the T stock price. Should i sell?
T does not like the 30's. Once it gets its foothold we will see a 10-15% increase.
Wait till HBO Max does the Game of Thrones Sequels.
"Disney, Netflix at all-time highs. Meanwhile, T stuck near decades low. Wake up management team & create some shareholder value...or GET OUT!!"
Telephone getting rid of DIRECTV is the best thing that can happen true it’s only 30% but everyone knows they did it this way show dish can merge in the future buying back stock makes no sense true they save seven percent on the dividend paying down debt is the only way to go I owned 9000 shares I have a substantial loss but I’ve been collecting dividends for 2 1/2 years I will be adding two average down I believe the dividend is safe going forward forget about changing management you’re only creating chaos let the company go forward￼￼￼
"It's amazing to me how many posters have a dividend complex?Maintaining the dividend will never enhance the growth prospects for this stock.Why don't we ever get news from the LAB about communication breakthroughs?Scientists from MIPT, Moscow Pedagogical State University and the University of Manchester have created a highly sensitive terahertz detector based on the effect of quantum-mechanical tunneling in graphene. The sensitivity of the device is already superior to commercially available analogs based on semiconductors and superconductors, which opens up prospects for applications of the graphene detector in wireless communications, security systems, radio astronomy, and medical diagnostics. The research results are published in a high-rank journal Nature Communications."

"Before the pandemic John Stephens (former CFO for 40 years) was projecting 2022 eps of $4.20 (apprx). Now that more people are receiving Covid vaccinations, will T be able to start generating eps increases by 2023?"
"You know what helps a lot of people when they are constipated? Having a cup of T, because it almost always ***** the bed. Market up today! T not so much."
The DI+ crossed over the DI-. That's a positive indicator.
I wouldn't get too cocky in the markets. The out of control variants (especially the S African one) will be the next thing to keep over exuberance in check. Keep cash ready.
CNN most watched cable news network.
Live action Harry Potter series announced. My easy prediction is in time Disney + and HBO max will be top two streaming services on the market.
I sold 500 shares of VZ today and bought 1000 shares of T.
Reminder to the DEMS who are outraged at Capitol hill riots. IT IS NOT THIER BUILDING. It BELONGS to the PEOPLE. Thats what democracy is all about.
"Ya $1400 is B.S. We want $14,000. We can't eat cake every day!"
T will be a $100 soon 
Many will wonder about ATT spending Billions with IBM and Microsoft and that they are throwing away billions of dollars. Nothing could be further from the truth. This tech will drive company and employee productivity way beyond the cost of the outlays. This is big news.
Sorry guys. That's just how T rolls and you should know that by now.
"annnnd , wait for it, down again"
As COVID knocks out the 70+ year olds who own this stock for the Div help is on the way soon. A more agile ATT without a 15 billion a year debt to old people will emerge and T will finally be able to compete. Unless those alzheimer's patients sink ATT for good first. Fingers crossed covid saves ATT!!!!!
The more Wall Street bashes the more Wall Street wants your shares of T cheap. 5G is going to be one of the biggest growth drivers over the next 3 years. It's like unlocking the internet all over again. Huge growth and T has picked up some of the greatest assets to take advantage of it. You have to worry when Wall Street is pumping like they did on INTC they wanted out bad and it shows.
Vote DEM and get $2000 check in a month. Nice direct bribe. Usually bribes are handled with nuances (like tax cuts).
"Stakeholders.......employees who think showing up for work entitles them to input. Well do they understand that when the company purchases a 10 million dollar piece of equipment that the ""Stakeholders"" would have to contribute money? Oh they think that they just get to be there for the payouts not the payins? Difference is Investors pay into the company by buying a piece. Employees get paid and have no financial responsibility. Working there should not entitle anyone to more than their exchange of time worked for money."
How come T is not down today. Something is wrong with the markets for sure.
Awesome dividend while you wait for the stock to go up 50% or more over the next 2-3 years.
Market goes up T goes downMarket goes down T goes downThis is ridiculous the ceo needs to be fired NOW
"From Daily mail c0m: Updated 11:02 EST Jan 3, 2021 Anthony Warner I might have to agree, there may be Lizards out there that roam the AT&T board still thinking HBO to Max out-does Disney+ in subscriber base... All Lizard based...----""He further wrote about reptilians and lizard people that he believed control the earth and had tweaked human DNA.'They put a switch into the human brain so they could walk among us and appear human,' Warner wrote.Warner did write extensively about 'perception,' adding that 'Everything is an illusion' and 'there is no such thing as death.'""He did not mention AT&T, outside whose building he detonated his RV; nor did he give a motive."
It doesn’t make sense to invest in a stock with a 5-10% dividend that drops over 10% a year . It’s time for T to drop the dividend
"The SEC will settle with T for $10 million in fines, and that will be that. Both have very good lawyers and can drag this out for years."
Sell CNN to Bezo for $20B and payoff the Godzilla debt.
Sad. Stock price now is a dollar less than it was 2 weeks ago. :(
Watching Red Equal jumping back and forth from day to day is like watching Richard Simmons sweatin' to the oldies. LOL
"T of course is controlled by the Dividend funds and the Pension funds that require T in their portfolios to keep the cash coming every Q and maintain their dividend goals for the entire fund.If the Pension funds want T to go higher, it will go higher. If the Pension funds want T to go lower it will go lower. The markets are controlled by the FED. Individual Stocks and ETF's are controlled by the Pension Funds.Thats the entire story."

"I use T for selling covered calls, and I have been having good luck not getting assigned, so I love getting the dividends along the way. Any recommendations for other tickers you folks use for covered calls?"
"Any move lower now will only be a chance to buy more T, before earnings and the run higher off earnings"
Even GM has PE of 12.. I think AT&T goes back to $40 pretty soon
"AT&T has a lot of debt. (190 billion - 175 long term, 15 short term) but Verizon has 135 billion of debt (125 long term, 10 short term) and nobody ever mentions it. And all they own is AOL and Yahoo. AT&T could probably get at least 60 billion for Time Warner at the drop of a hat. Maybe another 10 billion for DirecTV. So who really has the worse debt situation?"
Doesnt anyone care that ELLIOTT bought stake in T?
Down is the future T stock move trend.Bottom around March
So you're going to sell T to buy Growth Stocks after a 10 year bull run in bull stocks? Good luck with that.

You better not say anything wrong over on this board unless you want to get Mutated like a Ninja Turtle. Vagicell & others will see to it!!!
Does T need to stoop to the level of allowing CNN to pay radical leftists to break into government buildings to get some titillating video and exclusive interviews.
Stanky hard at work perfecting his short game and sand wedge
"As usual on a market green day.....T my only loser in the red. getting to be a curse on my overall portfolio. OK, u say sell it. I guess I'm too stubborn. or maybe like the $700 plus dividend I received this morning. lol"
a little factoid.....did you know Joe Namath was the first white quarterback to win a super bowl (commonly referred to as super bowl III).....bart starr (a white guy quarterback) won both AFL-NFL championship games referred to as super bowls I and II....inquiring minds want to know
The stock market is the only place where people run away from the clearance section and buy the same product overpriced. #Loadup
I guess they didn't like my post calling out the NFL for going black on everything. White lives matter too and there are a lot of great white acts to hire for half time shows instead of the garbage that's been on lately for the last few Super Bowls. That Weeknd guy yesterday was flat out awful. If we're ever going to become a unified country we're going to have to start treating all ethnic groups the same but right now the NFL is pushing in a different direction.

T really has fear of heights. It likes to stay low.
It's refuelling now..watch it move past 31 today.
Good evening T ~ somethings going on with dish for the better . Earnings on Monday hopefully spectrum news and possible deal with Verizon. I am skeptical about what I have heard regarding VZ but possibly a relationship of sorts

AT&T partially dumping Direct TV is good. Maybe we’ll see a little gain.

"AT&TJust saw a commercial saying that in 2022, a new Game of Thrones series called ""House of the Dragon"" is coming.I'm buying as much T as I can get my hands on over the next year."
I would not be surprised if by Fall places like California are not paying over $5 a gallon for gas. Joe has done everything he can to screw the American people into paying way more in the future for oil and gas from the countries that hate America the most. FACT
"HBOMax set single day mobile download record. If this headline came out for Disney+ DIS would be up 10/share and we get .20, go figure!"
It appears that after hours trading has had quite a bit of profit taking. Expect to see the price tomorrow take off from the after hours pricing. Great quarter and projections for the first quarter are tremendous!
There is obviously a Whale with a massive position that wants out. T not gonna get out of this until he’s done selling.
"Yes G the DEM wit without a brain it looks like VZ is the next GE of Wall Street as VZ loses more and more customers to T's monster LOL,LOL,LOL"
selling at 30.30 buy back at 28.50 up too fast
Order in to reduce T position by 25%.......for starters.
Nice Tomorrow is 1st Dividend sweetest and 3 more to come this year Good Start
It wont bottom until 25
This stock is so stagnant and barely moves in either direction for last 9 month.
"T is a long-term hold. Great company, 5G, and an excellent, steady dividend.Why sell it?"

WOW look at Wall Street dumping VZ today why because VZ has no future
I guess we are now seeing the China Joe effect. He wants to lock everything up. We will probably see at least 4 years of an up and down market until a lot of you people will wake up and vote a fair election.

"If you bought mid-day, you essentially lost half the dividend. Freaking hilarious."
looking for a 37.85 close or better today
I have growing conviction here that these assets are mispriced. Building toward mid 6 figure position.
Get it while ya still can under $32.! These deals come along once in a Lifetime!
I’m tempted daily on just sale and buy into something that moves.
"I view T as a a high yield ""junk bond"". Yes, there is some risk to your capital and no dividend is ever totally secure but T has not missed or decreased the dividend for something like 20 years. Buy, hold, take the divvies to the bank. Plus there is upside possibility in that shares at $29 today could be worth $35 at some point over the next 2-3 years."
T is the only one is green while others are tanking in red.
Again back into 28 range.
"Well... everyone telling to get rid of the stock because it will go done , good time to buy more ."
"Well Homegamers... Like I said....I SOLD MY 8,900 Shares Yesterday, Just Before The Close.I Said.....SELL BEFORE EARNINGS !"
HBO Max alone should have T at a $55 price currently. And many forget that AT&T is the leader in 5G. Also Direct TV is not a failure and I love  it.
anyone have any ideas on the pop? i checked a number of sources and don't see news. thx.

*The McClennan has rolled over. Be careful today friends
Sometimes I wonder why we still hold ATT. Recently I looked at the Yahoo chart for ATT. It only goes back to about 3-1-84. Check it out! Price per share 3-1-84=4.77 7-1-99=57.13 12-16-20=30.50. As you can see T has gone up and down but overall it is up. We have had T stock for over 50 years and have reinvested the dividend. We have also sold shares to diversify. I have to say that over the years ATT has helped us to build a nice portfolio. I believe that ATT is at a low now and it is a strong buy!!!
"Bought 2000 shares in 2019 avg cost 31.12. Loss of $5185 based on stock price right now. Rec'd total of $3120 in divy. Right now I'm underwater by $2065. I need stock to get to $29.60 for breakeven. So, how is that 7% yield working out? Let's see, that's $62.5K invested for 2 years and it's producing a negative return. Makes me look stupid, eh?"
29.99 or $30 comeon.
Close the market T is trying to close Green ! 
"Love all the DEFUND the DEM wits , that all companies are now doing"
Cheetah is quiet today.NICE.
"The fact is T is now the Amazon of telecom . T can give things away free to gain customer and grow LOL,LOL,LOL. Easy give them HBO max free and get a new customer for $100-$200 a month no brainer and now need to wonder why VZ and T mobile are now losing customers at a record pace LOL,LOL,LOL"
"MOTLEY Fool Article Just Out......ATT.....Dirt Cheap Dividend Stock To BUY NOW !With interest rates near record lows, it can be tempting for investors to seek out dividend stocks with high yields. Unfortunately, elevated dividend yields often indicate trouble. Big dividend payments today mean nothing if the stock later crashes.While dividend stocks can be a minefield, there are a few good high-yield options unlikely to disappoint long-term investors. Both telecom giant AT&T (NYSE:T) and tech giant International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have been left behind by investors this year, pushing valuations down and dividend yields up. Both stocks now look like great dividend options."
One day in 20 and @R is right!
Godzilla vs. Kong on HBO Max.I somehow feel better being long T.
"Unlike all of last year, actual science-based decisions and federal-led efforts are being championed and will eventually result in a healthier Main Street environment. This will lead to the restoration of small business and jobs, and help the top and bottom line of AT&T and it's retail customers."
5 year chart looks good
What does it take for T to go up. seems like this management is just happy the way thing are and stock holders should be happy with dividend. I bought T at $29 in 2004 and its still at the same price.
"I also bought another 850 shares at $28,48 the other day. Better then putting your money in the bank. Better interest, and chance for growth."
AT&T should be over $40.00...Just unbelievable. Great earnings call.
30 with staying power this time.
AT&T at $31 makes it the buy of 2018. Buy today and make 40% within 6 months. Upper management forecasting accelerated profits beginning 1st Qtr. 2019. Warner Media continues pumping out hit movies and 5G coverage continues coverage in every state.
"This has to be the most hated stock in the market. I will collect my dividends until people start to love this company. I just hope I live long enough to see that day. The old saying is every dog has it's day, and I been waiting for years like most holders just to hear a BARK, and wait I will."
Good morning T ~ what a week I have had but all is good . Stocks I would buy now are expensive. Waiting for a pull back which I feel will happen
US producer prices soared 0.5%; consensus 0.4%. The index increased 2.8% y/y surpassing consensus of 2.6%. This represents the largest increase year-to-year since October 2018.10 year Tbill over 1.63%What’s happening????
The cloud hanging over ATT's head:CNN
T~ good afternoon ~ spectrum will be in the news next week . If dish has to give up its discount price in 2015 they stand to profit huge . Don’t think it’s merger news but a cash friendly partner will come to light
"This dog should not be up this week given how poorly it has been managed. Also, the dividend is not secure. What's up on T?"
Is anyone leaving the station today? LOL
T ? What exactly is your plan with direct tv ? You never really had a plan and never should have been allowed to buy in the first place

Just added more. Will end above $30 today.
T down 3% in last 6 months.
There will be a sector rotation these weeks. Up to 31%.
This #$%$ - t - going south on direct tv news.
going up as VZ rallies thanx WB
Earnings will be down 90%. SELL
moves to $50
You can see how many people really do not understand how the dividend works...
break that $30 mark before ex-date !
I heard there's going to be a dividend cut in the future everybody run for the hills
so would we get shares of the new company?
"In regards too China stocks. For me they are trades, and Not investments. I will ride the trend and take tgts until I see a sell signal."

Here is one if you want to take the risk IPOE it is taking SoFi public and man is Sofi growing should have the merger done this month
"T is starting to clean up it,s act now that randall stephenson has left i think we will start seeing a slow uptick in stock price"
"Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan upgraded the stock to outperform from market perform Monday, saying “there is more that can go right during the next 12 months than can get worse for AT&T T . ” He had downgraded the stock earlier in the pandemic amid concerns about what the COVID-19 crisis could mean for the company’s WarnerMedia business, but now he’s more upbeat about the company’s prospects and strategy.“Throw in the fact that shares are heavily shorted, and we believe this is a recipe for upside,” Louthan wrote. “Large-cap value names are hard to come by, and we think investors who can wait a few months for a mean reversion while locking in a 7% yield should be rewarded for buying AT&T at current levels.”"
"at a 6% plus safe div, T is a buy all day long....I will be adding in a wee bit"
"and we all know that those HBO Max numbers are still super low, by the next quarterly report we'll see huge growth, and a steady stream of upward revisions as each phase goes into play"
"ive had my concerns over the years but hey... no fear and love the dividend rate. $34..... or 28, im in for the long haul using their DRIP program."
"AT&T’s multi-billion $ Network/Infrastructure upgrades are complete, Content, IT Services, Entertainment, cell/5G build-out, Redundant Nationwide Fiber loops, continued Asset Sales with accelerated debt reduction, First Net build, rural Fixed Wireless deployment, AT&T TV and Hi-Cap 5G delivery just now heating up. AT&T is quietly sitting at a $28.80 PPS, 15.4 P/E and 7.2% dividend, IMO this sleeping dog is due to awake with a long-overdue vengeance."
Negative market open today. Looks like back to $28’s for T today. More buying opportunity ?
OH NO!!! It looks like the final closing price of T was $29.99. That's even funnier than $30.00! LOL LOL
Value trap. They are still paying huge dividends instead of acquisition and innovation says the board have given up.
Good morning T ~ for me I am watching dish the next two weeks into earnings on the 17th or so . Real interested in what they say about progress into there network and spectrum. Stock is cheap but not buying more at this point
"Poor stock performance, but worth keeping some for good dividends. Much better than any bank or CD at least."
Looks like none of the GOP people on this board are complaining about the $1.9T spending package. I guess the $1400 bribe silenced the nay sayers.
"“AT&T says it will start deploying new 5G spectrum this year, raises HBO subscriber forecast”"
"AT&T has a high payout ratio, 289% (Using the annual income statement) it's an aristocrat stock but this ratio concerns me. Maybe the company would be in debt to pay dividends."
it is so obvious that $30 is a block wall we cant get past. geez
I guess the last post went through...
free cash more than double what they pay in the dividend...end of story.
This criticism of T stock price shows that people dont know how stocks work. If T did the same thing as JPM and give out 1% in div yield and the stock price goes up 5% youd all love it but since you get your 6% as a div you complain. If you dont want div and want to make money through growing pps go buy BRK.B. But eventually when you sell no matter how the 6% is broken down between pps appreciation or dividend it is all the same money in your povket.
"Keep an eye on the 10 yr, moving up fast. Food costs skyrocketing! lumber!#inflation"
Did I hear they are raising the dividend?
AT&TAaron Rodgers and Cheetah (Atlanta Genteleman's club) have a lot in common. Both are jack wahds.
"T cannot even unload Direct tv without a gigantic 28 billion dollar loss......Time Warner was another overpaid disaster.....so for the few pennies on a dividend which is now frozen for the next 2 years according to management, people are still buying T......it only pays for someone over 75 to consider buying this stock to help with their social security........why would any hedge fund consider buying into T with it's horrific record of overpaying and then undeveloping what they purchased......The bigshots of course make their millions but anyone considering purchasing T today would be foolish.....it just keeps slowly going down, frozen dividend or not.... Anyone under 75 reading this post should immediately look into any other stock, tech or genetic engineering especially.....in 5 years most of the good ones will have doubled and T will be around 24......."
May of had a dead cheetah bounce in the Nasdaq yesterday. Could see continuation of value stock buying. Nothing personal cheetah I do agree with you on somethings.

"Bought more shares. Looked today at how the disney PE took off once d+ got traction. It made an incredible move from 20 trailing pe to 60+ even as it's core business (theme parks) were totally shuttered for covid. Even if it doesn't happen overnight, HBO max WILL get on that trajectory. They have much better content than their peers and this 1 year marketing promotion (new releases on the platform) will expose people to the project and it will be sticky. International rollout this year. I could go on and on. Once wall street believes the story, PE will climb to 30 and beyond here. Bought in big today on top of my existing positions. VERY BULLISH GOOD TIMES AHEAD!"
Who was the nice lad who gave me 100 more shares at $28.80?
Looks like all the Swamp Creatures are slithering back into Washington DC
Watch the breadth tomorrow and the VIX T friends. Market is in a tricky spot. Some funds could blow up this week... there are sellers front running the margin call liquidation of longs. Imo if there are stocks you like wait for Market breadth and VIX to improve first.

DirecTV was a terrible acquisition. But it’s Latin America franchise was exceptional. Can they leverage that with the streaming assets ?
Evening T ~ markets have me confused. Manipulation? Maybe not but 27 years investing and made good money along the way something doesn’t seem right . Markets maybe good but economy is in bad shape
Time for ATT& T ti increase their dividend.
TMUS pain is T gain. Where is their div?
How's that short working out ?Looks like this was a well setup bear trap.Long overdue.
everybody heading to ATT for safety. equity is worth $40 a share.
KEEP DROPPING.....PLEASE.. Sorry everyone. I just want to buy more and lower my DCA..
World markets are up massively yesterday and today combined so I wonder if we end up green a penny or two?
This stock and company make me so sad. It reminds every day of missed returns compared to almost any other stock.
"yo, cheetah, did you see the article over at CNBC about the oil majors??interesting"
I sold 500 shares of VZ yesterday and added 950 shares of T using the proceeds from that sale.
"4000 crossing the border every day. That's 120,000 entering the country every month between here and Mexico. Are they at least giving them Covid tests? Maybe Phil knows."
"T is through the roof today, finally my -20% (minus) return is improving."
Interest rates increase is just a passing thing. The FED will be back in soon buying up bonds with its INFINITE CASH horde.

I had an important meeting tonight...I am reiterating $55.00 target and Strong Buy. HBO Max along with Business and Government are exceeding predictions.
"AT&T an ‘Extreme’ Bargain, May Rise 12%AT&T Inc. ( T) has continued its negative performance over the past couple of years, down 15% this year amid a broad underperformance in the telecom sector in general. Using a bit of reverse engineering Flannery found that AT&T is trading at “extreme valuation levels,” not only relative to its own historical value, but also to shares of competitor Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ), according to Barron’s.https://www.investopedia.com/news/att-extreme-bargain-may-rise-12/?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoohttps://www.barrons.com/articles/at-ts-gotten-way-to-cheap-heres-why-it-could-be-time-to-buy-1534171026"

Green on a red day. Very rare around here.
Kevin says no more bailout for the airlines. Let em file BK.
"People can make all the negative comments about “ T “ and the company’s dept that they want, but the way I see it is this company is like the largest financial institutions......To big to fail....can you imagine if T filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors and shut down its networks ? It would disrupt everything in our country and through out the world ! Verizon’s systems couldn’t handle the additional load. Hang on to your T stock. This company’s not going anywhere but up !"
"If Zacks says sell, then it is time to buy. Their articles are paid for by the highest bidder. Someone must want to buy cheap before earnings."
Turner Sports/Bleacher Report streaming service along with ESPN streaming will explode to the top of the streaming market

Here we go again. Another down day.Management change is needed badly.Sell CNN
I'm a shareholder and am unhappy with the stock's performance. I just signed up for the free 7 day HBO Max download through Youtube TV. I soon discovered not all of the movies are available for streaming and there is no search feature. I believe the same goes for Roku. Netflix is much easier to use and T needs to improve HBO Max features if they want to seriously compete with Netflix.
Annual meeting notice goes out next week.
Because of some of his recent snarky and cocky posts I am finally muting Cheetah. Good luck to you though Mr. Small Timer.
"Where are the ""$30 by Friday,"" and ""$40 next week""guys. I hope that they are all okay."
Anyone else here warming up too a long in some dirty energy?
Anybody who believes this soaring stock market is from real business growth is deluded. It's a BIG bubble.
This is one of the safest investments for 2021 period!
"The last time ATT was at least this high was Dec 11, 2020. Quite a move(for T) over the past week."
People are predicting a crash in the stock market. BALONEY... Maximum 10% correction before the FED steps in. Thats it. NO CRASH.And those predicting INFLATION are nuts. NO INFLATION whatever the prices are. Its been fixed that way.
After Netflix earnings I got a feeling this will take off today to the 30's!
Financial Manipulation is keeping T & VZ down...IMO in todays Market both should be approximately $95 Per Share
"For 2 days (in a row), T has closed over $30!!!!!! May good times be had by all!!"
"Wow, getting first COVID shot next Thursday and second one on March 11. I can't believe it. I didn't think we'd be getting any serum until maybe April."
Investor's that believe in fair reporting. At&t owns CNN. Vote with your money.
"AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner was the ""acquisition of the year"" and will have AT&T shares selling in the $50 range within a year. UBS got this one right as they usually do."
"Though its still a great time to add to a position. I really wanted to add more at a 31ish level. did not do it when I had the chance. My average is 32.92. Who knows what this stock will do between now and June 12th. If I have a chance to add at a 31 level again, I have 250 more shares set up to buy. Either way. you cant go wrong at these levels. Those that say T is the next GE, this is a totally different company, not even close."

Back to 38 end of year or sooner.
"The Fact is the U.S. Government by their own actions in selecting T has said both VZ and T Mobile can not be trusted and more because they have been taken over by the EU's one world order. The US Government is telling All Americans to NEVER EVER do any business with either VZ or T Mobile , because they can NOT be Trusted to protect your data. U'S. Government has done that by giving the business to T is says T is safe and can be trusted"
ATT is a classless company.Which means it has no class.
Hopeless stock. All the pumpers in the world will not increase the price of this stock.
lol idk why but I'm happy were back in the 29 realm again.
The dollar is falling Very bad news for the US economy. Big inflation on the way. Gas prices going to double
Green by EOD. Undervalued and nothing but good news on earnings.
perhaps I didn't mention it correctly because I mean it's 120 to 125 million with the international subscribers so maybe reconsider the price of the service when launching because people here in Europe always go with the cheaper one or the most talked about
Never see the $ 20 's again !!
It looks like T will still own a 70% interest. Which means that they will have to include that proportion of the new company’s results in T’s reported results. T would have to get down to less than 50% to exclude the results.....I think.
Why is T falling?
"All AT&T CEO has to say is ""HBO max SUBSCRIPTION blah blah blah, and 5G and EV blah blah blah"" These two comments will bring this up at least 200%."
33 tomorrow’s close great numbers across the board
#$%$ why does this stock go to 30 and back down again. Are people shorting this stock every day
"Futures green, tomorrow UP UP UP. at&T makes a lot of money."
"I doubled my position in T yesterday, I believe below 30 is a buying opportunity. It's a good piece in a deiversified portfolio - no one should put all the eggs in one sector or just in growth stocks. Don't worry, I have those as well.T makes content and strong in 5G. Yes, they need deep pockets for the auction, but 5G brings huge opportunities for M2M IoT, this sector will have massive growth rate in the upcoming years, so I'm not worried, T will monetize it.What if they cut or suspend the dividend? I don't care, then the company will reduce the debt faster, and increase/restart the divident in a much stronger financial position. I can wait a few Qs or even years for that, stock price volatility doesn't matter. T is an ultra long term play for me, probably never to be sold, will be inherited by my children."
We’re goin higher.
How many of you bought more shares today and paid over $30.20 per share?
"Let's talk covered calls...If one were seeking to generate additional income from writing covered calls, what would be the best timing to sell those covered calls? Before you respond, this is purely a calendar based question, not a price/value or any other variable. Simply seeking a timing centered around perhaps dividend record or distribution or options expiration. I guess what I'm asking...Is there (generally speaking) a sweet spot (based on the calendar) to write covered calls? I have mostly relied on instinct, with a fair amount of success, but I'm looking to dummy it down to a calendar/timing thing."
TX - how is that deregulation of the utils working out? oops!
"T couldn’t be in a worse position to compete with its well funded streaming competition. T’s own prediction was that only 3 streamers would be left standing. As service providers become mere providers of ever cheaper data, T will probably end up having to unloading it’s Warner assets at fire sale prices to stay ahead of the debt freight train. Given enough time they might do it...but change is accelerating. Competitors that didn’t even exist when T began its battle to acquire Warner are already miles ahead."
"Between getting the Divi and selling high/buying low, I have increased my share total by 1099 in less than 9 months. Went from 1,700 to 2,799 :) Easy Peasy."
"I told you all a couple weeks ago, Draftkings, GM and AT&T. DKNG was around $48 now over $60, GM was $45 now $54 and both just getting started. T hasn't moved, but it's day is soon coming as anyone with a bit of sense can see from the recent earnings the direction we're seeing, HBO Max is gonna blow up over this quarter with major releases including Kong vs. Godzilla, especially now that you can actually get the service outside of just a phone app, lol"
T is down in pre mkt today. Bodes well. Not.
I can’t believe this. They are finally getting rid of at least a part of Direct TV and all the market does is shrug?
T will POP today based on JP Morgans upgrade to Overweight. The stars are aligned.
"From article this am-“Overall, AT&T has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 4 Buys, 6 Holds and 1 Sell. The average analyst price target of $31.88 implies upside potential of 6.9% to current levels.”"

ATT stock was heading past 31 until the democratic house proposed legislation to undo the death of net neutrality at the federal level. now stock seems to have an artificial ceiling at 30. i believe it is worth a lot more. randall stevenson is well ahead of schedule in wiping out the debt which will only strengthen the balance sheet of the firm and thus the underlying value of the company. total debt has gone from $180 billion to $168 billion in 6 months. that is a 17% reduction in debt on an annual basis. at that rate the company could wipe out THE ENTIRE DEBT in 6 years if they went all out and not reduce CAPEX by a single penny.
T a real American company for Americans and will protect your data not sell it off or Collect your data for the EU one world order like both T Mobile and VZ is now doing. The Government had to give the first responders to T because they can be trusted to protect American people FACT
"T in one year -25% (yes minus) , dividend 7%. Who stole the rest of my money?"
It must be CNN's fault.
Still an opportunity to buy under 30 to get that compound effect WITH appreciation
joe sqint sese...i can ruin this country in 100 days....
Nothing but baloney on this board today. See you guys tomorrow.
I hope it goes down more so I can buy more shares. I love the stable dividend.
Evening T ~ VZ has been very quite in Covid era . Always said VZ premium customers are loyal you don’t know in Covid times
"T isnt going anywhere, nothing changed to business, whole marked tanked last week, + current dividend yield is amazing and will beat rising inflation."

streets worried about 5g spectrum debt getting piled on
"What is it going to take to try to turn this stock back in a positive direction? Their fundamentals, and earnings are solid- their free cash flow is more than sufficient to pay their dividend, their debt is more than being paid down, and they have an emerging technology in 5G, that is going to change the way we all access our internet and wireless needs. With all of their recent acquisitions- that all have contributed to their earnings.....what else can they do to show the street? They have become more than just a phone service provider- like Verizon and T-mobile. It can't be the Time Warner lawsuit over- hanging their heads. How can a company trade at less than 10 times their annual earnings- and pays a 6+% dividend- not be bought at these levels....I just don't get it. So much for people flocking to safe, quality stocks."
"Last year I bought T for the dividend. Of course, the price went down on the X dividend date and kept on going down there after. Panic set in and I sold, loosing the dividend and some capital. A short time later T recovered past my buy in point and beyond. Lesson learned? Sometimes it pays to just relax, step back and wait. Not always, but sometimes."
"Still not too late to get in on GM which is ridiculously undervalued even after recent run up, everyone is just beginning to realize how much this company has going on. They've got it all, their own proprietary battery, the Ultium which is so innovative that Honda has worked out a deal with GM to utilize their battery. They own 70% of Cruise AV platform, the most advanced AV out there(some may argue Waymo) but they are the two clear leaders, GM owns 70% while partners Honda as well as major collaborator Microsoft also own stakes in what is currently valued at $30billion. GM has a propriety hydrogen fuel cell platform which has already inked major partnerships which truck fleet companies Navistar and newcomer Nikolia to provide these fuel cells for the production of zero emissions semi-trucks. GM fully owns subsidiary Brighdrop, an EV and logistics company providing EV delivery trucks built by GM, early customers include FedEx who has already placed a major order along with Merchants Fleet just placing an order for over 12,000 vans.Put it all together along with GM's production to distribution infrastructure along with some badass EV rolling out and GM is back on top!"
"As mentioned before, luckily ex div day is a wash for me since I will get mine at COB price of today. Lot easier to get rid of a chunk and buy back after standard ER collapse."

Finally muted John! LOL
I enjoy my dividend I get from AT&T but I’ve been re-investing that money in other stocks that are giving me growth such as Starbucks Boeing I didn’t want to have too much holdings in 1 stock! But I’m still long and strong on AT&T good luck to all !

"A lot of board chatter about lack of growth for T. Anyone harboring the notion that T is a growth stock is barking up the wrong telephone pole. T is a telcom stock like VZ and their discipline is dividends (value), not growth. If you want Growth buy something else. Telcoms, REITs, preferreds, CEFs, Utilities, etc are all INCOME stocks. They ain't gonna change because you wrote about your displeasure on a message board. So go away and do research and get a growth stock. You're sitting at the wrong table!"
I understand this is an income stock and all....but will we ever see a Green Day?
"No, don’t buy this for 7% dividend. No growth. Momentum strongly down. It’s a dead end. When it’s $23 dividend won’t help."
"Price, sooner or later, always returns to its 10-day moving average. Currently, the 10-day ma is $29.10.Either price will move up to the 10-day ma, or the 10-day ma will drop down to its price. T is also in a bearish descending triangle facing a potential 3–4-point drop. T needs a good ER or some good news to strengthen its position. Bears will push this down if it breaks support at $28.30."
People need to realize that stocks with high yielding dividends do not shoot up in price as a growth stock. People are buying and holding long term for retirement. Don't expect this stock to go up and stay up on every bit of good news like growth stocks do. This stock may not hit$40.00 for several years. But don't sell if you are in a good spot and good yield with this stock. It is recession proof.

An ultra-fast internet connection powered by AT&T Fiber lets users quickly access and stream the latest online movies, music and games. Customers can easily telecommute, video-conference, upload and download photos and videos, and connect faster to the cloud. AT&T has millions of miles of fiber and this expansion furthers the Company's lead as the largest provider of fiber across the 21 states where it offers home internet service. The success of mobile 5G relies on a quality fiber connection to the wireless towers or small cells, which then translate the fiber connection into an ultra-fast wireless signal for customers.

"HBOMAX should help with earnings. However, a lot of people like myself have gotten it for free as part of their cable service. Well, I guess I'm paying for it and other channels because nothing is absolutely free. Will be interested to see exactly have many HBOMAX paid subscribers T added in q4 2020. If it's an impressive number, could see the pps top $30 and stay there. Right now, with so many HOLD ratings, not a lot of electricity being generated for T. Could see a .50 pop in the pps if they sell Direct TV, even if it's for a big loss."
5G is and will be dominated by AT&T don't fool yourselves.
not enough fear in the market. poor time to buy stocks.
"The FACT is T gets paid 7.5 billion and needs to take about a $32 billion dollar loss of which T took 15 billion for last Q so T will be force to now take what ever the remaining lose is this Q up to 17 billion No matter how you cut it that is bad. The only real question is what will have the biggest impact on T in the future. Taking the 7.5 billion and paying off debt.? or Taking the 7.5 billion and retiring shares for good. We know T pays over 7% on the dividend and I am sure T pay a lot less on the interest on the DEBT. The Question is What would have the biggest impact for T long term for the future. They will be savings either way , but what would help T long term the most?"
Look at the earnings graph from 2017-2020. If another year of down I think it’s time to exit  sadly I will sell my shares at a loss when it happens

OPEX on Friday they're going to keep this below $30 same for next week. Look at the number of open contracts at $30.

I am in it for the Div.price goes down time to buy long until that changes.
Kind of hard to decide if you should cheer or complain today huh? What a stock!
"What happened to MB and Andy? I'm guessing they both got crushed holding T, but they were fixtures here and then pfffffft, they are gone."
Just bought 1500 more shares for the dividend and hopefully a great share price raise.

You might get lucky and some one else will by VZ but not until it's in bankruptcy"
I wish conservative's would learn a lesson from our very open minded and enlightened democraties and vote with our money. AT&T helped put creepy JOE in the white house.

Safe dividends with 7.22% yield. HBO Max offers future growth prospects. It's a bargain at this price.
T was in the Holiday spirt and wanted to finish green and above $30 thank your local leprechaun
Was reading an article by seeking alpha that by the first earnings quarter of 2018 AT&T is going to raise their dividend by .04 cents. I am assuming that that is if the TWX merger goes through.
Afternoon T ~ dish looking good today
Where will HBO MAX sub numbers be by the end of 2021? Rock your votes below.
Next bill from congress.. Food stamps for everyone below a $50K income level. Eradicate hunger forever.
"Wow, we might close below $29 to take out those open 39,000 Calls that expire today."
All these streaming channels.. (Paramount/CBS is coming next week). Can't keep track of them anymore. Getting all of them will cost more than cable bundling. Oh well... so much for cutting the chord.
"Something is brewing, is it T or tea?"
"Actually, the majority of their debt is in the form of notes and debentures. About 60% of AT&T’s total debt costs between 3% to 4.99%, as per their 2019 annual report, page 73.￼￼￼ I could not tell from the annual report whether they have the ability to early pre-pay any of this debt without penalty or premium cost"

What the heck happened here? T was up a $1.32 at one point.
"$T is mismanaged Company, relative to $TMUS. It has $172,000,000,000 Debt. Cost of Debt is Huge. Current ratio is below a $1 it is a read flag, Bankruptcy bound. At&T will need to cut it's 7.30% dividend, to start paying for its debt. $T needs to restructure itself, if it wants to survive.. They need to reinvent itself. Otherwise it will collapse."
heading to red. too much bad news. b of a analyst says t price driven by bad news.
"WOW, it was actually green for about 5 minutes!"
What news is making T go up 3%+ today?
It's our money damn it!News!The only news that comes out of the monthly board of directors meeting is no dividend increase but Stankey does have a million bucks to slide across the table to Randall!
"AT&T DRIP Investor since 1981, $92K per year is what div pays me now + SS + income properties... Livin' the dream, lovin' the life, counting the blessings."
The weekends are the time T investors don’t lose money.
Shame on T (and VZ) leadership for letting T-Mobile steal all the positive press on 5G. Just horrible communication & leadership for both companies. They let the narrative get away.
T is on the move should be a $60 stock by July
if nancy has very large hands ....
Debt is virtually FREE. Who doesn't like FREE money anyways.
"Where, oh where, does one go for GENUINE news that you can confidently trust as being the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth these days? All I can see is propaganda in some form or other."
"AT&T offloading DirecTV To Apollo eNow, sources are saying that the Apollo offer could be exactly the type of deal that AT&T will “have to do now” in order to offload DirecTV and a portion of the debt the company is carrying.He added that there was ""no discernible benefit from the two divisions being operated under the same corporate umbrella""Based in Michigan, Jackson National is valued between $6bn and $10bn and has four million customers in the US.It is expected that AT&T will be revealing the final plan on 11 July 2020 when it published its financial results for the year 2020. The Telecom conglomerate giant declined to comment on the potential stake sale or IPO."
never pay over $29 for T. too much debt. they made awful acquisitions.
"It’s shameful how AT&T destroyed the ones mighty DIRECTV. Prior to the merger, you could call DIRECTV on the phone and a US representative would answer on the second ring. Now, under AT&T’s stewardship when you call for service or support you end up talking to someone in the Philippines who knows nothing and barely speaks English. I’m ashamed to admit that I still own lot of AT&T stock."
"I use T for my phone. My work phone also T. Debt looks good, price looks good, earnings look good. I see major economic expansion into Mexico and South America in the coming years to combat the China threat. T will grow bigly. I bought some T on Friday."
"T, always the underperformed. Nothing but a portfolio drag to anyone that owns it."
told ya. 1.50% is coming soon. 10-Yr Bond1.372%
what a great stocl
Take it easy people. Whenever a company acquires another the acquiring company’s stock price goes down initially. It’s because they are taking on debt. Happens all the time.
"The bonuses are a drop in the bucket on what Tax Reform/Bill is going to do for T and its stockholders will see there stock OUTPERFORM its past. This stock is set up to reach high 50s by the end of 2018, all along the way grabbing 2$ in a dividend as well."
If you like slow cooking pick this stock.
"AT&T dividend yield should really be around 5-5.5%, especially as they are streamlining operations and HBO Max/Warner Media is getting going, shares should be between $37-41"
8.3 billion in free cash flow and payout ratio of 45%. Dividend seems to be safe

"Futures not looking good,could change overnight though. Maybe back to 28.80 area tomorrow. My trigger finger gets twitchy about there!"
T finally closed above 30? It’s a saint paddy’s day miracle!
how can one find out the level of $30 strike call options expiring today? is number more than usual?
If you're in this stock for immediate growth then you're delusional. There are 1000's of better growth stocks.The upside to owning this is:1. The dividend if you're already or near retirement2. New management's focus on reducing debt and growing 5G/HBO MaxFor 2 you could be looking at years for those gains to materialize. Right now this stock is best suited for 1.

Nhsore MUTED!
obviously a computer algorithms is controlling the price the last few days
Does anyone know how long it will take to recoup the $27 Billion that T invested in the C- band spectrum? VZ invested over $40B. I don't think they would make those large investments unless the profit potential is great. I have not read anything about profit forecasts.

"Morningstar maintains $36 Fair value: 'Still attractive'Verizon and AT&T Dominate the C-band Auction, Narrowingthe Spectrum Gap Versus T-MobileAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 25 Feb 2021""The suspense is finally over as the FCC released the winners of the C-Band spectrum auction. As areminder, we cut our fair value estimates on Verizon and AT&T on Dec. 23 as auction bidding reachednosebleed levels. Fortunately, activity cooled shortly thereafter. Actual results weren’t wildly differentthan our guesses, but carrier spending was higher than we’d hoped. Verizon spent $45.5 billion versusthe $37.5 billion we’d penciled in while AT&T shelled out $23.4 billion versus our $22.5 billion projectionwith the actual amounts likely to end up $4-8 billion higher after paying to relocate existing spectrumholders. We hadn’t expected T-Mobile to participate extensively, but it still ended up spending $9.3billion, more than double our estimate.However, the three carriers also ended up with more spectrum than we’d expected as Dish Networkwon virtually nothing and cable companies Comcast and Charter (bidding jointly) didn’t win anything.U.S. Cellular and private equity firm Grain Management each spent around $1 billion, but the big threestill ended up with more than 95% of the spectrum on offer. Holding more spectrum should reducecapital spending needs, all else equal, while keeping spectrum out of the hands of upstarts shouldcontribute to competitive rationality among the three firms. Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T plan to holdanalyst meetings on successive days March 10-12. The firms will undoubtedly extol their network We don’t expect to materially change our fair value estimates or economic moat ratings as a result ofthe C-band auction. We currently view AT&T ($36 fair value estimate) as the most attractive of the threewireless carriers. We believe Verizon is roughly fairly valued ($57) and T-Mobile is modestly overvalued($108). We’re happy to see Dish ($35) exercise restraint given the network buildout ahead of it, but therange of potential outcomes around this effort is large""."
Bought back the MAR 26 $29 puts I previously sold for .16 each this morning. I'll resell them again when the stock drops back.
What year was ATT at $42?
"The #1 blunder for ATT was sacrificing Western Electric, aka Lucent, to service the mobility companies only to watch those companies eat its lunch. That was over 30 years ago! Charter {Spectrum) exists today because ATT's desk jockeys had no idea and still don't."
"All the T haters are learning to SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL, Why because T's future is so bright you have to wear shades and T is now the only Large Cell Phone company you can still TRUST to protect your data. VZ has proven they CAN NOT be TRUSTED by their own actions and T Mobile is a Foreign Company with an agenda to collect data for the EU one world order to be used against American"

has that #$%$ even said anything yet about the deaths related to the capitol seige? an officer took his own life and another who was being charged as part of the mob has also taken his own life. it's unspeakable what we're witnessing. for anyone who wants to chide me for posting about politics....too effin bad.
To think people bought this believing it was a safe bet. smh.
Morning T ~ many negative reports regarding dish and some are acceptable and some are overblown. Markets are overpriced and inflation is a problem
T knocked it out of the park folks. 78k shares in pre market do not get it.I will be adding @ 7am when TD allows pre market.Verizon owned Yahoo keeps trying to push Er down the news by putting the frivolous lawsuit above more current T news such as their earnings.Look at the numbers!Look at the growth of cellular and HBO max.Verizon has to be humiliated.T and the dividend is more than safe.Long all the way!
Creepy Joe is good for my oil stocks. Thank you at&t and cnn.
If we have 2 green days in a row T longs will witness a second coming of Jesus a
"Only Bag-hold T=Trash If you truly Hate $$, there is no way to tell the market will go up tomorrow, but T will surely continue to go downhill like the past decade with $200 billions of debts on its shoulder."
"2018 is in the books! Not a good year for us price wise. But, 2019 starts the streaming wars. The massive Warner and HBO catalogs are impressive. Game of Thrones, Big Bang Theory, Friends, and the list goes on and on and on. T actually has more streaming hours of super hero shows than everyone else combined. For those of us long, let's hope the government loses the suit and T brings all the pieces together for us. The dividend is nice, but that should be icing on our cake and not the cake itself. Happy new year to all!"
Great to see all the chat about 5G and streaming.
"AT&T T, purchased the DirecTV business for $49 billion in 2015. oops."
"Takes a lot to turn this ship , but for sure the T ship is turning and going to go HIGHER and HIGHER, LOL,LOL,LOL Hope you got some shares get ready to go higher and higher , because T's future is now so bright you are going to need to break out your shades"
was looking for a little more dip to buy i am a long
You all had your last chance 2 buy in the 20 tys
Mixed bag. In a nutshell: GOOD: Subscriber growth/phone sales through the roof. HBOMax up. BAD: Guidance lower than expected by considerable amount.This likely means the stock will trade flat to down for a bit.
"All that work today by the T haters and it's still green and going higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
Down on earnings beat. Tells all you need to know about investor sentiment and inevitable downward trend T faces for the foreseeable future! Dead money or worse!
Morning T ~ interesting times we live . Dish is up to something we shall see . T ~ I won’t sell even though I don’t own much but like you to become a better company. Prime rib sandwiches for breakfast and lunch . Peace everyone
There are 3 truths in the world:1). Death2). Taxes3). Buy T under $30
"Jan 27th will be a day for the history books. HBO Max numbers coming in strong, everyone is talking about it! Plus, auction is over, what is done is done......now AT&T recouping all money  from 5G services. Plus, who knows, AT&T is wise about DTV, we can hear taking on Roku and direct TV streaming and combo packages.....like Dis+ and Hulu......it's a great way to resolve this problem. $35 coming soon"
$50 here we come

"Phil is still spewing his hate and divisiveness. If everyone acts like that, we'll never get unified. Get over it Phil, the election is over."
"Phil say nice daily chart, positive signs. Phil please enlighten me on the buy signal your seeing!"
"ATT is 7x EBITDA. It has plenty of cash flow to pay the dividend and do all capex. If they decide to pay down debt and the EBITDA multiple stays constant, the siock has to rise or the EBITDA multiple must decline. Seems unlikely it will decline. They are also doing what any rational investor would do--thye are borrowing a lot of money at record low rates and investing it at a higher rate or return. Why would thye pay off 3-4% interest rate debt. No way. therefore they will pay the dividend."
"Don't worry about Verizon though, they're going to pay off that 169 billion debt with their Discovery Plus streaming service. LOL"
"AT&T has the Pebbles Beach PGA ads all over the place, nicely done"
"$20 or below is definitely coming for T, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
"Do your job CNN and cover the Cuomo cover-up. Just embarrassing, period, & show how biased they are."
Remember one thing from this impeachment trial...The jury was filled with co-conspirators.
"Would not be surprised to see this close at exactly 28.50. Yah know, screw the option holders on both sides of the bet and only Wall Street wins."
Any investor who does not have T in their portfolio is just not thinking straight. No stock is 100% safe and very few investments are. But this is probably the best deal you can find today.
buy back and retire shares
"Just became shareholder of T for the first time of my life. 29.2 Bucks/share. I expect good numbers about HBO Max and higher data traffic due to home offices and videcalls. I am European and EUR/USD is pretty good right now. Quite a defensive stock, but I think TSLA and other rockets will have fuel leakage quite soon. In case of crysis, fall will not hurt much with boring T."
I like collecting the fat dividend.
Morning T ~ cold  in Denver. Sold Disney late 2020 probably shouldn’t have but didn’t have a big stake anyway . Go dish
anybody else looking at Friday out of the money calls?
"do you see the market manipulation after hours. No one would be attempting to sell 10 and 20 thousand share blocks in after hours , when there are no people in the market to buy them. There are two ""partners in crime"" selling and buying the same shares back and forth to each other to give the impression of movement. They are short and were caught short with the late rally and are trying to scare others into selling shares to them. They will not be attempting to do this when regular trading begins tomorrow, because they would be creamed by the real money. You will see tomorrow. Btw what they are doing is illegal , but rarely enforced in this setting because the ""police"" have gone home for the day...….."
Wall Street is dumbing VZ and trying to get in T on the cheap before the HBO MAX numbers come out .
"When you plot 5 years chart for T vs VZ, they both move in the same direction in general, except in 2018, now they move to different direction, T is going down due to debt and from the Government , VZ is going up, the biggest gap for last 20 years, eventually T will close the gap."
I had all my retirement money in T because advisors told me it was a safe haven with good yields. Amazon just ripped all my grandkids' college educations in 1-day. I'm very sad.
"At the end of Q2 T was the most shorted stock by hedge funds. At the end of Q3 it was the third most shorted by hedge funds. T is so massive, that short equaled just 1.3% of float. Shorting T and going long TMUS was a great 2020 play but it won’t work in 2021. T spent more this month at the spectrum auction than planned but so did everyone else.If there’s a sell-off tomorrow because of news, it’s probably a buying opportunity that won’t happen again next year. I’ll be adding on any dip."
"A lot of people talk about having patience with AT&T, and they seem fine with the status quo. I think these are long-time holders, retired people, who bought AT&T thirty years ago for $15 a share. Then you have bag holders who bought AT&T for over $40 back in 2016. Very different situations. I bought AT&T a few years ago in the high thirties. Like many I bought it for the dividend. I see a company that is trying to maintain and gain share in two very competitive areas: Cell phones and streaming entertainment. In addition the company is carrying an enormous amount of debt from buying Warner Bros. With regard to Cell Phones, T-Mobile and Verizon are very strong competition. When it comes to streaming media, the competition is Netflix, Disney and many others. Warren Buffet talks about investing in companies that have a MOAT. Companies that do or own something that no one else has. Buffet would never buy AT&T. It is literally the opposite of what he looks for in a potential investment. In conclusion, I've a Sell order in for thirty dollars a share. I am more than ready to take my loss and move on."
Buy the dip why you still can. T will be going higher . So all the haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes
T is the perfect stock to counter balance your performing stocks
"How much did T spend on spectrum at the last auction? Another fiasco but alt least its a fiasco that is essential to their primary business. Sadly, I'm getting ready to pull the trigger and flee. FCF is falling into dangerous territory. The board has to be considering slashing the dividend. What do you think the stock would trade at with a dollar dividend? Not a pretty thought. There is a sound business thesis to cut the current shareholders adrift by slashing the dividend and spending some of the money buying back shares at 15 bucks to goose EPS. (and management's bonus)"
Today we are testing 31  Where are the guys who said 31.75 was solid support 
"QQQ will eat a bag of d Money that doesn’t buy back into tech will go late to the party banks and oil and smarter money will go to reits and telecoms as they’re in accumulation for the end of bank season. Maybe we break the range this week or not, keep accumulating and enjoy the ride coming soon"
SEC investigation on $T price movement... finished green on continuous uptrend intraday. Unusual activity detected
Jan 28th and 29th are layoff notification days at at&t...all they're saying is that the numbers will be significantl...probably 15% of the workforce. Jan 30th is the earnings announcement day...
Just keep adding to your position. It may not be this qtr but when managements able to show the cost saving from doing this restructuring then investors will be fighting for shares.
"As Expected T continues its way to below $20, Non-stop falling knife !"
Cue the West Wing theme music.
Stock up over 2.3% this morning on heavy volume. Looks like a close easily over $31-$32.
Owning AT&T sure is a humbling experience
T raised the numbers on HBO MAX now they hope to have 120 to 125 million subs on 2025 if they hope to accomplish then they need to reconsider the price of the service
Whoa! Gotta run to the eye doctor. Something is wrong with my eyes. I look at T and I see GREEN!
"These guys can't be wrong. Vanguard, Blackrock , State Street & Newport keep adding huge T shares. These 4 inst combined added over 200 million of T shares during the 4th quarter of 2018. This quarter maybe virtually the same."
We've got the beginnings of a mini Netflix at this point. We've seen how the market valued Netflix. Why isn't anyone noticing? I know T has made some horrible decisions in the past and they have definitely impacted the share price...but how do you screw up the best streaming content rollout? This is a slam dunk investment...I just don't get why this stock is not $40 already. Forget 5G...HBO Max is the reason you buy the stock and hold it long term. This is a growth stock over the next 2-3 years.
"Great news!....In a significant upward revision, AT&T said it now expects 120 million-150 million HBO Max and HBO subscribers by the end of 2025, up from the 75 million-90 million it previously projected in the fall of 2019. Roughly half of the 2025 subs are expected to be in non-U.S. markets, Kilar said.AT&T expects HBO’s revenue to more than double over the next five years. In 2020, HBO had $6.8 billion in operating revenue — and Kilar expects that to be around $15 billion by 2025."

VZ and T.
what did Josh Brown say about T???
"Getting DTV off their books while still benefiting significantly from the fact that they continue pay tv as is continues to exist will little change for decades, very little innovation, the best being Dish which I've liked for years, they are more innovative and cutting edge, which is why their shares hold up and they continue to increase profits, earnings per share just reported like $1.24 vs est of around $.74-76. Which their is no reason why DTV couldn't be equally effective at reducing cost and downsizing DTV iat the appropriate ratio to actually be increasing net profit significantly"

The Government is telling Americans don't do any business with VZ or T Mobile because we don't trust them with your data , Because they have been take over by the EU's one world order."
Zucker leaving...Maybe because T will Sell CNN
Crazy stock but it's been $30 for the last twenty years through thick and through thin. I don't know if anything is going to move it out of that $28 - $32 range.

"All the work by the T haters and T just keep going higher and higher LOL,LOL T is now the only cell company you can still trust with your data , The fact is T mobile is a foreign company and VZ just proved they can not be trusted anymore as they are no censoring Americans and Censoring what Americans can see , read and post. VZ has proven they do not protect Americans First Amendment right, VZ breaks them so for sure VZ can not be trusted with your data to protect it, VZ proved they don't even protect your First Amendment right your data means nothing to them by their own actions"
Talk about a dead end investment.
"The key point is still about 34.40; this is the 200 day moving average. Now as the 50 day moving average crosses this it becomes the bullish golden cross. you can see this can't happen for a little while, but we are building up momentum. If the earnings are good when reported on Oct 24, then it will most likely occur. It is not unusual to see an 8 to 10 % rise above the 200 day moving average which would bring us above 37. This all is certainly within the realm of reason."

"T forward PE = 9TMUS forward PE = 40VZ forward PE = 11T is criminally undervalued at this point. They have content + delivery finally resolved. With the economy finally recovering & higher rates coming, we'll be at $40 in no time."
"The cost of the additional spectra and associated reallocation is spread over 3-4 years.That means that a lot of it can be covered from the portion of FCF left over after paying the dividend.So the assumption that the totality of the cost is being added to debt is simplistic short bait.So far all we know is that T has obtained a short term bridge loan of 15 billion to cover the initial requirements and are working on divestitures to generate cash.At worse, they will put debt repayment on hold for the next 3-4 years to pay for the spectra.Just keep your eyes on the FCF because lots of it covers for lots of errors."
Nice stock lol.
"with a 30 dollar strike price expiring by COB today and the price being where it is, the day will be a nail biter baby! T is awesome baby! Too much?"

"Wow, wow, wow.Blomberg says that 16.7 millions streamed WW84!!!!!If it was Disney or Netflix their SP would double on opening tomorrow.But it is T and suppression articles will be flooding in before market opens and Greg Moffet will be writing another hatchet article to sat PT at 13.It may not be tomorrow, but value will surge eventually.Great move Mr. Kilar.It was predictably poo-pood by all of the usual suspects but subs don't lie."
next week ain't any better!! Pegged at $30again.
Show me a green Friday and who knows we might break the range soon
T stock now is a falling knife! Who wants to catch a falling knife early in its downward trjectory?
"Muting vs reporting. When you mute some on this board, that persons posts are no longer visible to you. They are however visible to everyone else. Reporting eliminates the offending post, and it notifies officials at yahoo of the contents of the post. Since muting someone has such a limited overall effect on the offender, I don’t recommend it because it’s comparable to witnessing a crime and responding by closing your eyes. Not very helpful. What I would recommend is to report the offender. Under the report abuse option, (the three dots to the right of you post), you have the option of being more specific with your objections. For example, you can choose to identify the offending post as an; Inappropriate post, Does not belong here post, Looks like spam post, Copyright violation post, or Something else. Under the “something else” heading, you get to put in your own words the nature of your complaint. If someone posts something truly offence, threatening or incendiary, then it’s best for everyone that you report the offending post and not just mute it. Lots of sick people out there. Best not to give them a voice on this forum. Report them and let the authorities do their job. That’s my take on the matter."
T is a defense stock. When tech selloff/market incertainity starts. T will be stable or even go up.
$T nears deal with TPG to sell large minority stake in Dirctv Uverse
"The most uncool and unprofitable blue chip security, right next to IBM"
You have to ask yourself why is T borrowing billions more dollars and going deeper in debt? A financially strong company does not need to borrow billions. Why didn't they raise the dividend even a penny like they did last December? The writing is on the wall!
What date was T handing out dividends?
AT&T to the moon soon........ hold to you dividend
No love for T.
I see no activists taking a recent position in ATT according to 13D filings.So what you see is what you get.
Does any body here realize that AT&T is getting involved with self driving cars.
it would be refreshing if Upper Management put a pause on their bonus until debt goes from $150ish billion to $125.
The moderators for this room are dangerous.
"Sell CNN and zoom, zoom, ZOOM!"
72 months divided by a interest rate will determine how long it will take for that interest rate to return all your investment just on the dividend. ---- 72 divided by a 7% yield = 10 years.
of course this #$%$ is down
Looks like T is now the only American company left to do business with. That is why the Government pick T for the first responders . VZ has been taken over at the top by the EU and T Mobile was founded by the EU
Great manipulation by Wall Street to pick up shares of T
"AT&T's CFO expects financial flexibility and debt reduction in 2021Jan. 06, 2021 10:52 AM ETAT&T Inc. (T)By: Niloofer Shaikh, SA News EditorJohn Stephens, CFO of AT&T (T +1.1%) says significant investment in network performance with attractive wireless device pricing for new and existing customers should continue to drive migrations to unlimited plans and momentum in the company's wireless business.The company expects to generate free cash flow of $26B in 2021 with a payout ratio of 50%, built upon management's guidance of at least $26B of free cash flow in 2020.The company has refinanced more than $60B of debt at historically low rates and reduced its amount of debt coming due through 2025 by about $30B.Q4 results will be out on Jan 27."
This stock worth at least 35 here period. With dividend well worth it.
"looking forward to next quarterly report, HBO Max is definitely taking off, this same day as theatre move was very smart, they've got this great lineup for 2021 which either goes to tradition theatrical window and losses money, brings in a few million, or get that plus millions of new subscribers"
Will this stock ever cross $30 again?
"I think more people would want to invest in this company if they weren't so overbearingly political. They own CNN and all these outlets which constantly spew garbage. If they would calm down and focus on operations and future growth.. then I would be more opt to invest. Companies like AT&T, APPL, AMZN, GOOG, FB etc are way too focused on political control. They all need to calm down"
"Bag-holders continue to self pro-claimed T will rock $40 one day in their dreams which in Reality this trash is more likely to drop below $20. It was $60 @ 2000, $40 @ pre 2008, Today $20s. You see the pattern ?"
I just bought back the BP March 26 $24 Puts that I sold for .88 each on 2/26. Bought them back for .41 each and then bought an equivalent number of actual shares for $25.75 each. Once I did that I immediately sold the March 26 $26 Covered Calls for .92 each. Woo Woo On the move making money. T is doing well today too.
Looks like T is on the move. Goin UP.To DA MOON baby!!!
#1Clean up your reputation!
"Long term, holding, and buying more when dividend comes in!"
HBO Max only has 17 Million subscribers. The rest is for HBO. Not impressive.
"So funny how nflx's debt, acq costs in excess of subs revenue, piles of ebit losses, etc. were all not just acceptable but embraced as they built the company. Does it feel that hbomax gets the same treatment in its assessment within the mothership of T?? I can answer that.....the answer is NOOOO. Why? Because Randall S. put an albatross around this stock's neck with his past performance. Now we live with it. Prob will continue to for a while. I might exit. No love from anyone on this thing."
I have now lost my entire 2021 dividend payout. What gives? Word on the street believed T had too much debt. T then spends $24 BILLION. T drops 6% in 3 days.Is this a sound business decision?
"We have been in a bull market since March, and that is why people have stopped liking T. Here's why you don't sell T though....the bull market eventually stops, and then you will wish you had an income stock like T.Who knows when this bull market will stop....maybe tomorrow, maybe another year. But, you always hold on to your income stocks. By all means, go ahead and invest, or day trade in something that you think can make you quick money, just don't sell your income stocks to chase after that, cause when the bull market becomes a bear market, you will regret it, because thats when income stocks start to rise, as people who ignored them or sold them in the bull market, now want them."
AT&T bought more 5G bandwidth that TMUS. Something good cooking?
Worst company on Earth literally with the Biggest Debt Mountain on the planet at $200 Billions while the Interest rates are skyrocketing. Interest Cost will eat Trashy T Alive !
The offer to purchase notes is good news. It means that cash is king and T has the ability to pick and choose what notes to retire. Seems like they are offering the market a deal to get out of the notes and reduce unfavorable terms. This is part of the plan.
"No one get manipulated, just market stumbled due to awaiting fed news , I don’t know if it will go up in next couple days after earnings (I can’t see future) but everything looks good and I assume we’ll get to 35-40 in next 3 month . Only thing that they have to get rid of Direct TV burden ."
Red on a big green day. Again.
any predictions what is the price support of T .i want T to go down more
The dirty little secret.Population control is coming.Politicians will never talk about it.The only thing to save capitalism will be selling gimmicks and staples.Where will ATT find new opportunities?Right now its not in any growth business.It's still lumbering along.It's business plan is not finite.Nothing to get excited about.
Somebody send Stankey and his team some AT&T T SHIRTS.

Everything is fine except for Direct TV. They wrote down it's value by 15.5 billion which created an earnings loss. ($1.95 per share) Gotta find some sort of solution for that part of the business.
AT&TLOL
management did mention the resumption of stock buy backs
"My apologies to Rudy for calling him out earlier.Looks like Rudy was correct when he said T had reduced the debt to $176.5 at the end of 2018. Check page 44 of the 8-K that was filed with the SEC on Jan 30. It appears that Stephenson is already on his way to his planned debt reduction to the $150's by the end of 2019. If they do generate the expected $26 billion of free cash flow this year and they are able to sell some assets as planned, they could do it! At a minimum, assuming the $26 billion of free cash flow works out as planned, with $14 billion going to dividends, they would be able to reduce the debt by $12 more down to $164 billion from the current $176.Sounds like Stephenson is already on his way to fulfilling his promise!"
the short seller are holding it down
guys do they still pay 7% dividends??
Many are predicting that HBO Max will have a tremendous year with an outstanding line up a programming.
"T is doing good. As long as it stays above $29 by March 26 so I don't have to buy any shares, I'll be happy. So ANDY claims he muted me huh? LOL We'll see. Let's see if the creep shows up when I respond to other people's posts."
Stephens made a solid presentation today
Anyone get their 29.50 covered calls called away?
Did they disclose the HBO Max subs?

Every single stock and fund I own is up......with the exception of AT&T. Wow! So surprising. The divy just isn't worth watching the stock. Languish = Anguish Debt-riddled forever.

T Mobile is not even an American company, TMUS was founded by the EU to collect data on the USA to farther the EU's one world order so for sure they can not be trusted to protect American's data ,"
Happy New Year T ~ still in twenties for the year :) lol dish going higher and tacos for snacks
ATT guidance for 2021 is what's holding down the price. Let's hope they were sandbagging and Warner/HBO outperforms greatly in the 2nd half. 1% growth was projected for 2021 and that's just a measly 1.7 Billion dollars more. Some companies would dream to earn just this increase as their total income for a year!
Call options are so cheap is there anything that can move this stock
"Don't you just love the big fat juicy dividend that T pays each quarter? Borrow a million dollars, put it on T, and the dividend covers the interest with plenty left over for you. It's a no brained. Live free of charge with no need to work or worry."
Anybody use T to park cash for the divvy until they see an opportunity to pounce on a growth stock or real estate deal?
If you bought T anytime in last 5 years you are still underwater!This sub is about to dive deep and run quite soon.
It's no wonder the stock of a company that owns CNN is constantly bleeding and becoming increasingly irrelevant. Selling this dumpster fire as soon as I get anywhere near even.
Possible income investors are bailing VZ and moving into T?
"Bought some @ $29.48 this Am. Divvy will be announced within days and once the ""weary"" see it's coming they will pile in and buy buy buy. Easily push the price back up to $33 in a matter of few days. That might not mean alot to an Appl/Msft investor but $3 swings up are great for current environment and where T is with debt payoff. This stock under -$30 is an absolute steal. When I was shorting T I loved the price $29.50 cause I'd buy and hold it for sometimes less then a week and make 1k flipping or more. I'm not a hedge fund just tryin to turn $1 outta you guessed it .15 cents. I got a long position now and not getting a board seat but I do well on shares accumulate and just let em sit. T long!"
The ARK gal is no fan of T. Why? She seems to question the div.
T is finally zooming and nothing but crickets on the board. Do I have to start talking politics again?!
RUT RO........After HoursTIMMMMMMMMBER !
"For a FACT , T is no VZ , because T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades , VZ has no future because more massive debt and no way to pay for it because VZ is losing customers to T's monster new Cell Plans with FREE HBO MAX , All of T's new customers will help pay for any debt T takes on for spectrum , VZ is losing customers and does not have that choise , Look for VZ to have to cut their dividend next year because Han's is driving VZ into the ground and running off customer and shareholders with his EU one world order Yahoo CENSORING NATZI's T will just take more and more customers from VZ"
seven days straight +. By the way when a stock gives a div that amount is subtracted from the price the next day. It is simply money the company used to have that now is in the hands of the stock owner. It is more noticeable in T because the div is so large. So if you own the stock you did not lose that money. It is already in your pocket. But stock is still way under valued. So if you missed the great discount don't hold back it is still a good buy. Not too many stocks that will give you 7% a year plus a very probable 15% in stock price if not more.
T has billions of dollar in debt. almoset 100 billion dollars in debt. this stock should be down. fair value should be 25 dollars [er share. this is way overvalued.
"All the T Haters worked so hard to get T lower and T just keep going HIGHER and HIGHER. Do you know why , because T's future is now so bight you have to wear shades , T is the only American Cell Phone company you can still TRUST to protect your data. T Mobile is a foreign Company setup by the EU to collect data on the USA and use it against them to farther the EU's one world order. VZ is a disaster they have proven VZ can not be trusted to even protect your First Amendment rights, even worse VZ has proven they will break your First Amendment rights , By their own actions of CENSORING Americans and CENSORING what you can see, read and post. For sure if you CAN NOT Trust VZ to protect your First Amendment rights you CAN NOT TRUST VZ to protect any of your data, VZ has proven they CAN NOT be TRUSTED by their own actions. FACTEven the Government knows and had to more the First Responders to T's network because T was the only Company that could be trusted to help protect the American people."

"Too bad that the broader market is down, AT&T could be up ""bigly""."
WOW! Are the Reddit players jumping on the T bandwagon?
"There is a real disconnect going on. Apple stock is priced at a PE of 23:1 and staying high, yet everyone is talking about no one paying their cell phone bill. Either some stocks are going to get hammered soon or the idea of an economic depression is overdone. I'm not saying T is in the best debt position at this point, but the dividend should be safe for 6 months unless this gets really bad in which case the Dow will be at 10,000 and portfolios will be crushed. There is no way Apple will sell even 300M Iphones if people aren't paying their cell phone bill. Yet I don't see that kind of reaction in those stocks. Most tech stocks, even consumer tech, is holding up better than the general market. But, people will be far more likely to pay a cell phone bill than to buy a new cell phone. So at this point, the sell-off in T is an over reaction in comparison to other stocks, but that doesn't guarantee anything. Maybe their sell-off is coming if the consumer suffers for longer than a few months. The question is more basic. Will governments continue down this path even in the face of massive unemployment? I thought the objective was curve flattening, not avoiding every case. So you would think in a few weeks that we would return to normal, whatever that normal is. At that point, it's on each person to decide their own risk tolerance. But I know Americans and we are risk-takers in general, so I doubt we suffer a depression and have bread lines. It will be more likely that anyone over 65 stays home and the rest of society carries on and some take more chances than others. So T will be fine and although a little bruised, will be paying the same dividend they always pay."

"Morningstar finds 'T' attractive:Analyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 27 Jan 2021""AT&T’s fourth-quarter financial results weren’t great, but the firm is making progress in several areas,notably postpaid wireless and HBO Max. As with Verizon yesterday, AT&T’s inability to discuss the Cband spectrum auction is frustrating. Management cryptically promised to provide revised debt leverage targets after the auction concludes. While we don’t harbor concerns about AT&T’s balance sheet at this point, this uncertainty is not welcome, given the attention investors have paid to the debt load. AT&T ended 2020 with about $10 billion in cash and also reportedly lined up more than $10 billion in available credit earlier this month. As of now, we are sticking with our estimate that AT&T will spend around $20 billion for additional spectrum. Our fair value estimate remains $36, and we believe the stock is attractive. Postpaid net phone customer additions at AT&T (800,000 versus 279,000 at Verizon and 824,000 at TMobile) were impressive for the second consecutive quarter, likely reflecting relatively aggressive phone promotions. Management again made the case for this activity, highlighting its desire to strengthen relationships with existing customers. The percentage of AT&T customers upgrading phones was the highest in three years, and we estimate the carrier has closed the gap with Verizon in terms of customers using newer devices. But this effort has come at a cost: Phone and commission expenses pulled wireless segment EBITDA down 6% year over year despite 0.5% services revenue growth. We expect AT&T will be able to dial back promotions as 2021 progresses, though it indicated it hopes to continue driving customer growth. At Warner, the firm ended 2020 with nearly 42 million U.S. HBO Max subscribers, up 3.5 million during the quarter. The premier of Wonder Woman 1984 clearly had the desired effect on customer interest.HBO and a strong ad market couldn’t offset weak studio results, however, with total WarnerMedia revenue down 10% year over year""."

BP on the move again. Up another .36 to $24 this morning. I don't know if I'm going to catch a break with this one. I'd like to see a big Red day in the Oils to boost those Put premiums so I can sell March 26 Puts. That's the goal. Let's see what happens.

JPM raised TSLA price target to 105. HaHa.
The board of directors should fire Randall Stephenson. ATT paid $48.5 billion for direct tv. The stock price has not improved since this purchase. Now ATT buys HBO for $108.7 billion. I have no confidence that ATT will profit from either of these purchases. I would suggest that ATT spins off their mobile business. The fact of the matter is that ATT is a telecom services company NOT a content company.
i bought some earlier 5.7 percent dividend looks good to me
A little green is better than a little red.
"Make sure to buy T today to be qualified for the dividend. Guaranteed 7% yield, plus capital gains on stock to $40 most likely within a year. You can get rich safe & easy by just reinvesting your dividends into more T purchases. Or, you can lose all your wealth by investing in nonsense like Bitcoin and watch it crash eventually."
"Wells Fargo downgrade was based on total baloney, the entertainment Landscape can eventually help this company. Total speculation without warrant"
I have to thank ANDY for reminding me of BP. I hadn't thought of that one for awhile until he brought it up again. The oils are looking strong and they should have a good year with the pandemic slowing down. Selling those March 26 $22.50 Puts at .99 per share is looking like great trade.

LOL,LOL,LOL All the T HATERS better learn to say OH NO up T goes. LOL,LOL You just can not make this stuff up when it's all so true LOL,LOL"
$35 by the end of August....$38+ end of year
"I've figured it outATT's CNN should peddle even more hate and revision to get the ratings up.Then the revisionists will gladly buy this ""equity"" out."
“Dirty” energy stocks did great today. Dirty energy didn’t fail because of a little snow storm. Dirty energy wins again!
"AT&T needs to raise its dividend to 23.5% , the price decline in the last year"
"I am what Happened I told you it was coming all you T haters LOL,LOL Why because T's future is so bright you are going to need shades LOL,LOL Hope you don't owe any VZ because VZ has no future and will be going from best of breed to out right disaster LOL,LOL,LOL"
"With all the big investing behind it, the 5g rally, the dividend, the paying back of debt and the low stock price equals a stock investors want to buy"
Amazon buys a $1B pillpack and market thinks it'll wipe out traditional retail. T buys a $85Billion TWX at discount and Netflix stock remains unchanged.The market logic is strong.
Where are all of the pumpers? The $40 by next week guys.
I love my CNN. CNN is the ministry of truth. The summer riots were a peaceful protest while the January 6 protest was the crime of the century. Thank you CNN for doing a wonderful investigative journalism. We need more honest news media like you.
"VZ has moved 21% in the past 30 daysT has moved 13% in this same 30 days Look for T to close this gap by years end. As long as VZ holds its position, you will see T make a run to 40."
"OMG BP is up .70 to $26.00 per share. It was just $15 a couple of months ago. The oils are on the move.In the meantime, the ""safe harbor"" T is dropping like a rock."
"Selling CNN would see ATT through this cash crunch. There is a cash crunch! Labor contracts are approaching extension dates.Maybe the 13 board of directors should forego their $140,000 salaries for a year,Problem is the latest analyst meeting shows the love affair this company has with CNN.There's very little left that ATT can monetize.More downgrades are going to come if Telephone can't get its house in order.The spectrum auction was a body blow."
"Stocks with new up cycles or up cycles starting and should have a very good year .T should pay you better than just about anywhere you can park your money and has upside in the stock as 5G is rolled out as they leverage HBO MAX to take business from it's competition as T's 5G monster grows.PFE you want to start buying the dips because a new long term up cycle is starting soon plus it pays over 4% just to own the stockVTRS can more than double this year and will start paying a dividend around 5-6% at the price the stock is trading at today , Insiders are buying and know it has big upside"
AT&T is now obligated for the legacy costs of not only ever phone company they acquired but legacy Time Warner and Legacy Direct TV employees. I know..not to worry...those retirement plan investments are soaring. No worries.
Maybe the meeting will greet us with 25 billion more debt on purchase of band sale??????
"the consensus seems to be Republicans will hold Senate, but I don't see the polling that reflects this in GA race?"
"Added more, buy under $29.... drip divy and just relax... 5g and entertainment group in long run will drive share price higher , yes there are high flyers out there, but as a part of your portfolio T can have a solid place"
end corp welfare!!
AT&T has a lot of debt that will take years to overcome. With that said the company is in a lot of great businesses and it's going to perform well over the next few years. They will pay down some very inexpensive debt and continue to turn out these dividends and at some point the price is going up. Maybe not 20% a year but at some point this is a $40 stock in the next 3 to 5 years my humble opinion.

"Obviously going to $35 and possibly $45 but this is a good  start. We all ,except the Shorts would like a $100.00 pps but that's not happening. Meanwhile, the Dividend makes up for it."
"The sun came up again, so I knew T would be under performing the market..."
"AT&TElliott/Singer probably exited at 32.70, lol."
"I recently bought T and it is the single largest individual stock purchase I have ever made. I generally am well diversified with this one exception. Here is why: The P/E ratio is 6.7 with a forward P/E ratio of 9.24. As of 3/25/18, the average P/E ratio for the S&P was 23.6. This to me represents deep, deep value. Also, the payout ratio is only 41.39%. This indicates a sustainable dividend. The average dividend yield on the S&P 500 as of 3/25/18 was 1.99%. T at $32.00 is 6.25%. If T is down 10% in one year from now, which I think is highly unlikely, you will only lose 3.75% on your investment because of the dividend. However, there are many more reasons for it to go much, much higher from here. I am a 72 year old retired stockbroker and former member and broker/trader of the Chicago Board of Trade, The Chicago Mercantile Exchange & the CBOE. I consider this a good investment on a risk reward basis."

"I bought Disney at $78.00 and just held on. It doesn't pay a Dividend like AT&T and doesn't have HBO Max..But I held it anyways and still do. AT&T is superior in everyday. I would like to see more marketing from AT&T on the HBO Max side because as a person like you, it's #1 and Netflix or Disney can't compete with it. AT&T needs better marketing for HBO Max because it is fantastic  but until people know about it, it's a hidden gem."
I sold 30 put contracts at strike 28.
"When a stock (T) or the market is out of favor, good news is viewed as bad and bad news is viewed as terrible. Despite the earnings, holders of T should be thankful the stock did not tank. To get a multiple like other streaming services, T will have to spin off WarnerMedia."
Hello you old time longs can you have a word to your grandkids about putting T on the Reddit stock forum .Tell them the inheritance will be far greater
I seems that there are huge bids on 5G freqs and loans will grow. Maybe companies will need to release corporate bonds to cover the cost....

"No dividend cut - the dividend will be “sustained”. -“Financial Flexibility. The company remains committed to its capital allocation plan to: grow customer relationships across 5G wireless, fiber and HBO Max; sustain the dividend at current levels; reduce debt; and monetize non-core assets. Stephens expects that free cash flow after dividends, plus funds anticipated from the video transaction and other asset monetizations would give the company flexibility to reduce debt following the recent spectrum auction”"
"""Overall, the Street has a Hold consensus rating based on 6 Holds, 5 Buys, and 2 Sells. The average analyst price target of $31.67 implies upside potential of about 9.5% to current levels.

"Figured out why everyone is so upset this morning. You probably watched ""The little things"" like I did too over the weekend. Blockbuster WB movie it isn't.

It may be #1 t the box office but you will leave scratching your head asking why why why. If this is the best, after WW84 it wasn't even a memorable movie."
"All the T haters are starting to learn how to SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"I am a long time holder of T. I have to face facts staring me in the face that T is a dog. When T was denied TMUS and had to pay 6 billion, Stephenson should have been canned. Instead, he buys Direct TV that lost probably 45(?) billion. I fear HBO Max was late to the party in pandemic viewing/subscription. Now T has to overpay billions in 5G auction. Lots of wishful thinkers here, including me."

Why 1.9Trillion. Why not a nice round number like 2Trillion. These politicians think they are wallmart $9.99 so that people think its NOT $10.
T is in good shape if things were that bad they would cut the dividend a long time ago I see big up side coming for HBO Max ! Keep buying on the dips

If all the analysts predict a price of 37 (even those that find fault with T) so how is it not a buy. They are saying it is almost a sure bet of a 20% gain (including the div). My own guess is will hit 37 pretty quickly and in 12 months will be 43. And if there are any good surprises from the merger who knows where it will go.

"T-Mobile added another 1.7 million postpay subs in the quarter. 5.6 million new over the last year. T-Mobile’s good news over the last few years has consistently been followed by bad news from AT&T. I don’t see any way out of the downward spiral for AT&T. T-Mobile can always out compete T on price. Like VZ, TMUS can partner with great content providers without the risks inherent in owning. And then there is the undeniable liability that comes from owning CNN. Eventually T’s debt may be inflated away. For now it’s an anchor on a sinking ship."

Unfortunately, this transition will still just be a blip on the balance sheet."
Maybe 10% downside risk here if the market drops 20%. I think this stock is a hideout for 2021.

too many years of bad T management and bad T CEO decisions - don't expect this stock to move up for a long time. just like PFE; keep collecting the divvy and come back in 5-7 years. it's gonna take that long for T to pay down enough debt for investors to move back into the stock with confidence. T-mobile kicked T's #$%$ and that's just the way it goes.

AT&TWow. CFO Stevens' statement sure makes it look like the dividend is frozen indefinitely.
Fun fact: Plot T vs SPY from Jan 2019 to present. What you'll see is T tracked SPY up until Mar 2020 crash. Then they diverged. SPY came roaring back and gained way over 50%. T went sideways. What happened to break that tracking? What did T do to get left behind? Who's got an answer?
"All the T haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL Why because T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades"
This is the ram up to earnings. Brace for rear entry.
How many customers fled in Q4? HBO gains do not make up for postpay subs fleeing. T-mobile gains are usually at the expense of another provider. Is not raising the dividend a sign of things to come.

"So, looking to Invest just for the dividend. Is this a good opportunity? seems like the price is low, may hold, div is increased basically every year. So, a good buy? let's start the conversation."
YEARS.........Lost Opportunity Money.......MARKET UP 400%........T Has LOST Value !
VZ gave itself a nice boost. But what people forget is that it is way up from a year ago so I am not sure how much of a higher price it can support. T on the other hand is so beaten down that there should be a lot more potential for the upside. It will depend on analysts to an extent. If they do the usual and say yes earning were great BUT maybe this will go bad etc. then it will take some real surprises to get this baby to continue up.
more pain in my chip stocks. ouch #AMD. should've bought safe ole T
About Capital Ratio- Anything with a ratio below 1 means obligations for the year ahead are dangerously suspect.Probably why Telephone begged to extend workers contracts.Don't let this company keep spinning yarns.
"The T share will not take off until they have new management. The previous CEO is now chairman, and the new CEO has many, many, many years in T so don't expect any renewal of the company. It has become an old dinasoar with good dividen. Nothing more. Also, the just got new financing, at a rate between 5 and 6 percent, and are happy about it. To me, that interest rate level, for a company as well know, etc, as T, seems very expensive. Don't expect much growth in share price. Just enjoy the dividends."
"Att is losing more and more subscribers year over year. October they announced they are basically abandoning their DSL customers which is the vast majority of their internet subscribers. Fiber optic line expansions are now being done incrementally as the original install was done on agreement with the government. They are facing much better competition and will continue to lose subscribers to the cable companies and in their rural markets possibly to Starlink. Their Direct TV acquisition was a terrible fiasco. To me the future is internet and if you surrender the internet, you surrender main avenues of growth and sustainment."
I think Buffett trimming on Apple and buying dividend stocks $VZ and $CVX might start a new rotation trend. Trim high-flying tech and move them to dividend stocks.
You missed a golden opportunity to sell $30 Covered Calls today for great premiums when the stock was $29.70 today. Do you realize you could have made more than the dividend in ONE day? AYE
I feel very positive about AT&T. 2 stocks I feel positive about are AT&T and ExxonMobil...I really feel good  these companies.
This is a $60 stock all day. Just keep buying until then
"Man ATT borrowing 14 more Billion, Dont know about T, beginning to scare me !"
T is a great buy ahead of earnings. HBO MAX is knocking it out of the park. You will be surprised. There main business (cellular) is going to beat too.
Have you seen the Barrons article that has an analyst rating TMUS as a buy and T as a sell. He talks about TMUS growth. I was wondering how long it will take TMUS to go from about 20B EBITDA to about 55B EBITDA like ATT. I can't understand T being a sell with their p/e and cash flow. Who pays these analyst?
"Thanks titus......but even Warren Buffett makes mistakes- and owns up to them....like his IBM bet, among others.If T was just a cell phone company, like TMUS- I'd be more concerned than I am in owning this right now- but I have to believe that their diversification into the media world- and in companies that are showing profits- will eventually prove profitable for us shareholders when we do sell our shares. But for now- many on here are happy to live off the attractive dividend it has been paying- which it does have earnings to do so, and can well afford to.I don't see any chance of a dividend cut- which keeps a floor under this......unless people give up their cell phones- and stop watching Direct TV and cable (HBO, CNN, etc.)None of us have crystal balls- and we do know that the big fund managers run the markets with their programmed trades and algorithms. All we can hope is that companies that are profitable- in markets where there is a need- are worthy of our invest-able dollars. Some posts on boards like this can scare the %&*# out of some people, when stocks are going south- myself included-but I find that in stepping back- letting the gamblers do their thing- and just remembering that I am in this for years- not days- and that the stock isn't going down due to the company losing money- or being in a declining industry- is often the best, and calming thing to do. I admit to watching this too closely- like many do.....because I do have probably too much of my future retirement dollars in it-but I like the direction they are going. Let's see if I can stop watching this so closely- I doubt I can....it's just human nature to be concerned about your money. And let's hope the merger announcement comes sooner than later. Here's to seeing Green numbers in the future!"
This is some stock lol.
High volume buying early. Too iffy on chasing or waiting a few days
"Come on guys. What happened to ""We're on our way to $34"" and ""The shorts are running scared""? Could we please get some consistency here? I'd like to know if I should, 1. Back up the truck, 2.

This is T, the $28 - $32 stock, not some stock that's going to grow. Unless you decide to either sell Puts or Covered Calls to supplement the dividends, the best you can expect is your .51 per quarter dividends while hoping that the stock doesn't drop more."
AT&T Investor Day:https://video.ibm.com/channel/vRfQm6pMmrP
"serious question: What is the structure of the debt?I mean, short-term loans or long-term?What is the interest rate? Fixed or variable?How will rising long-term rates (and short-term rates) effect T?I would like to jump into this stock but rising rates concern me because of the large debt."
How do you spell margin call? GME that’s how. Those holders are the definition of “diamond hands” btw check out the fundamentals on GME then count up the share price and stop when you get up to over 300
"Friday option, Now we can go higher next week , So all the T haters better to get ready to SAY OH NO up T goes . LOL,LOL"
Dont be fooled by green pre mkt. Remember Lucy and Charlie Brown.
T and LUMN are buys. VZ and TMUS are sells. Enjoy!
"You know one of the biggest differences between T and VZ. T has CNN and you just don't have to watch it you can change the channel , VZ and their Yahoo NATZI are censoring what you can see and read even their own shareholders and customers . Not just on VZ stock post but all the stocks . Big difference very big difference"
Sad day for USA . I really didn’t care either way on the election wanted to be fair as possible however. Stock markets are extremely overpriced which is good for my pocket but do think it’s overplayed and priced
I just don’t see T going above $30 this year unless Covid 19 is extinguished. If you want to invest in T then you need to develop a swing trade strategy utilizing both the common and options
"I made $100K+ last year selling T Puts. If the market manipulators want to keep a cheap T stock down, then I'm going to make money from it."
"We will see Mon. if T's recent moves were a flight to safety ahead of the G20. Meanwhile stock is soaring(for T), news articles are getting positive, and only .79 from a 52 wk high. Oh yeah a .51/share dividend getting locked in in about 10 days."
"T has many ways to lower it cost with all it's assets to drive customers to T . From Free HBO Max to drive cell phone sales to Free HBO Max and sell ads, T now has massive upside just takes time to build all the income streams and take all the customers from T mobile , VZ and NFLX As long as they get you to pay for something they can give away things to you. It's the Amazon model for telecom . Drive the rest into the ground by taking away their customer because they do not have the asset to compete"
"All the T haters better learn to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
AT&T is a very good long term investment.
When will T go woke and replace Lily with a person of color? State Farm did it with Jake.
"Close @ $29.00 today,imo. glta"
"someone asked me for proof when I said it will hit $30 before ex dividend. now if you can't read simple charts, company financials and fundamentals, you shouldn't be investing."
*AT&T IS SAID TO SEEK $14 BILLION LOAN FROM BANKS FOR SPECTRUM
"This market is still drumpf drunken grossly overpriced. This tech bubble will burst like all others. If you own one or more of the two dozen stocks that are insanely overpriced, you should seize this opportunity to raise cash, or park investments in value stocks like AT&T. AT&T has survived every bubble burst for the last 100 years."
nobody can predict the low but this point in the market could be a gift......gl
"Good ole' Jack Dorsey finally shaved off his Go tee and starts looking like a Respectable tech person instead of a vagr. Yeah since your stock lost $10 basically in 4 days and everyone is closing their accounts. What did you Expect was going to Happen, Jack?"
Scotch X T folks ~ lol . Hearing LAST chance to get T b4 30 . Funny . 29 and b~ low next week . Scallops 4 dinner
"THIS is why I cancelled DRIP. Take the cash, then re-invest after the fake run-up on Div Pay Day. Be patient...wait a week or so."
Not too late to pick up some preferred shares if you're interested. +/- 5%.
"Ya know, even if T reports in line numbers and its commentary is neutral, the stock should really move given this interest rate environment and the Fed comments today. All you have to do is take this to a 5.5% yield, and it gets the stock to 37. And as long as the market believes the div is completely safe and T will pay down debt diligently, there's no reason it shouldn't move the yield down (stock up)."
"Did anyone receive T dividend today? I have not received mine from TD. The payout day should be Feb 1, right?"
"My understanding that 10G, which is coming down the road, will be more secure!"
"Split leg golden Zebra pattern detected, possible upside +$6"
"Im fine with $T being a bank account for me. The free cash flow nearly doubles the amount of total dividends paid. Its safe.Based on its last 5 yr FCF, fair value with a 10 P/E is $32ish. I am happy buying in the mid/high 20's and trimming in the mid 30's.Rinse and repeat."
"Hype and hope keeps this thing afloat. Until there is real earnings growth three Q’s in a row, all we will see is a narrow trading range. The dividend is sucking equity out of the stock at this rate and stocks are not called equities for no reason."
Do people realize that $2000 payments is not something the Govt people pay out of their own pockets? Its the peoples money that the FED is printing.
Remember to place long term good to cancelled sell orders of $60 to start or any higher price you want for your shares
Already barely holding in green. The new T ads on tv with Lily hiding behind a desk are boring. Why even have her in an ad if going to hide that beauty. Also saw a T Mobile ad. Very impressive .
Why is ATT getting out of government contracting?Can't compete?
it's too bad cheetah doesn't get comp'd for every thumbs down he gets.
"Cheetah,I sold my shares on Jan 7 for $30. It went ex-dividend on the 8th and I bought my shares back for $28.90 and sold $30 strike calls expiring tomorrow. If it doesn't get called (doubtful), I'll sell cov. called expiring in late March. I want to be able to sell my shares the day before it goes ex-dividend next timeI plan on repeating the same trade again right before they go ex-dividend in early AprilGood luck I see things improving in the 4th quarter and I'll change my strategy depending on how the outlook for Covid-19 shapes up."
"Five members of the Texass ERCOT (energy) board resign in disgrace. All acknowledging the failures of the board to oversee, regulate, and prepare the power provider and infrastructure for redundancy and resilientcy. Catastrophic failures in the natural gas distribution infrastructure lead to widespread electrical outages that resulted in blackouts, brownouts, sanitation failures, fires, and deaths. None of the resigning members of ERCOT lived in the state. I'll say that again, none of the ERCOT board members that resigned lived in Texass."
if u buy today do u get dividend on Feb 1st?
"Don't whine about share price being too low. The dividend payout ratio is just over 50% so the dividend is secure, therefore just hope it goes down even further and load up."
Last chance <30
"Wow closed above 30, I’m definitely having a beer tonight."
CEO should leave now.
What a stock right here lol.
T is caught in the VZ updraft.
"Well, guess my 30 dollar covered call will expire worthless once again. Guess ill keep doing this until I lose my 3300 shares. Its been fun using that premium money to buy many shares of other stocks. Anyone else doing the same thing?"
"The oils are hot today. Wait until things really open up. Oil has been suppressed for so long it's like a loaded spring getting ready to unload. Back up the boat boys, the plane is about to leave the station."
If this stock were a horse it would be on it's way to the glue factory.
T will do well to hold $29.00 tomorrow. glta 
I have accidentally made Ts dividend with leftover AMC shares (50 x 2 accounts) overnight... lol
amazing how robust this market is given the situation at the Capitol. wow!
Fox News just called the election for Biden.
Does anybody think the merger will be approved?
My compliments to Yhoo for putting back up my post on the $15 and hour minimum wage. One small step forward for free speech.
"So I am admittedly not extremely well versed when it comes to investing, but I am and have been long in T for quite a while now. I will hang onto it for the dividends for years to come I believe. Could someone please explain to me why we want to see an increase in the stock price as long as the dividend is holding? I reinvest all of my dividends for now, so would it not be better for someone who is doing that to hope the price stays level or just slightly grows, so they can DRIP more shares at a higher dividend rate? Maybe I am missing something here. Thanks in advance."
Heard years ago Walmart was interested in DTV well before the T merger so wouldn’t be surprised
I look forward to the day T succeeds with all this new technology and I can tell Comcast to stick it.
Att could do all kinds of things to spike the stock price but I think they like low volatility. If they had an Elon musk the stock would be 10x higher in a year.
I try to help you guys out...MB 11 days ago$T conversationMARA is the next AMCYW
"15 states have removed the mask mandate, Texas is only the most recent one. 108 migrants have tested positive for COVID and they were put on buses heading to who knows where."
T stock is a dead stick...where are the company share buybacks to support shareholder value???
Am planning on buying 500 shares in the coming weeks
Bottom is in on t stop fighting it mms sheesh
T stock clearly is in a strong downward trend for the next few months at least.
Theree chinese TELCO companies are delisted from NYSE. You might experience some growth.
"Look at that dividend go, haha."
"Director buying, linkhttps://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/732717.htm"
I view T as a bond with a 5 year maturity. I did buy some more this week. Just a little 500 shares to round out my holdings to 4000. Now I am done with this.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day. This thing will flop just like it always does.
"Read a whimsical article, today calling long holders chickens. Well ok ,so what cluck cluck. T, Dividend's quarterly thus far although reduced due to current world constraints. Refinanced debt at lower rates.The next major event for AT&T will be the results of the C-band spectrum auction. Weexpect the results to come in the next month or so, and this will likely impact the stock.We expect AT&T to spend ~$20bn, which will increase its leverage, but with only ~$4bnof short-term debt on the balance sheet as of 12/31, we believe the company has thefinancial capacity to de-lever relatively quickly. Major Analyst review."
Whata stock lol.
"a green ticker day. I cannot believe my eyes, miracles do exist."
"Let me guess, up pre market, down at close."
Tmobile Vz T 1 to many market share isnt infinite
"Wonder Woman 1984 up to $142.5 million box office receipts world wide. $107 million internationally. It cost $200 million. Only been out for a little less than 4 weeks. It's going to make a profit when you add in merch sales and DVD sales, HBO Max subscriptions and all that."
I thought stankey did a great job on CNBC interview. was well spoken and didn't dodge tough question about dividend. he has a clear plan is bullish about adding HBO max subscribers.
Just picked up 5000 shares of #$%$ heading up?
That was a straight line down today when the DOW is up 300
"I started my T buying at ~31.5 a little over 6 months ago. From selling high and buying low everyday, I finally got down my APPS into the $26 range. Next goal the $25 range."
"I have been watching AT&T for years. First time buyer today. They have great synergy and potential for upside is significant. HBO Max is great. Don't have to go to theaters, which has become more and more unpleasant."
VZ up 1.43% today now.
"T is a disgrace to retail investors for over a decade, Unless you simply hate $$. Don't bag-hold this Titanic !"
The auction for C band must end to stop this slide for T and VZ. It was supposed to end yesterday but apparently the FCC is trying to cripple the industry and has extended it indefinitely. They should look at what a similarly scorched option in Europe did to their communications. Once the companies were drained of funds by the auction they had precious little available left to fund the networks which still remain crippled today.I thought that Ajit Pay was a smart guy but I'm now having doubts on that assessment.Sucking ever last drop from the lifeblood of a very essential industry to give politicians more money to spend is not smart.
Tindad muted.
Question for the board. Does anyone know if a company can buy call options on their stock after they have announced a stock buyback?
see if it holds 27.50
Stock pays dividend Feb 1. That means stock must go up so reinvestment pays higher price￼ Happens all the time
32$ headed to 45$ then to 60$. You heard it here first.
T is a CD stock. Should be in everyones portfolio for stability. Not for trading.
Third party Investigation of att governance is becoming necessary. Almost criminal neglect of shareholder interests. Criminal incompetence is apparent. Instutional big shots out there turn the screws on att please
Downtrend still intact. Elliott bump long gone. Stankey pimple burst. HBO Max dud. WW84 flop. CNN still stewing sewage. The only thing going up is mismanagement and their compensation.
"nice to see T up. been a T stockholder for 8 years. T goes up and T goes down (where have I heard that before?) but the dividends keep on coming. to all on this chat room, I hope the best for you. keep a good thought, all."
huge insider buying at T
this company should be at this price 3 years ago ....
"I told you to learn to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
Big Tech is showing how much political power they have. They need to be curtailed and put on a leash. The DEMS will do it.
"Netflix ConcernsAs more and more media giants enter the space, the more content will be pulled from Netflix's thinning library. Netflix's savvy management has been hedging against this unfortunate development, spending billions on original content for almost a decade, but this may not be enough. Netflix knew they had to catch up to its impending competitors' deep content libraries, and they will continue to rely on original productions to maintain subscribers.The global pandemic was both a blessing and a curse for Netflix. The enterprise was forced to shut down all production in North America until it is deemed safe to launch again (very uncertain timeline). Netflix's pipeline of new content is drying up, and many subscribers have watched everything (worth watching) on the platform.Disney, NBCUniversal, and WarnerMedia have decades of original video content at their disposal and do not need to rely on new productions nearly as much as Netflix. These three media giants could sit on their enormous libraries for years and still keep viewers entertained. This is a concerning thought for someone holding NFLX at 70 times forward earnings.There has been an enormous amount of growth priced into NFLX, and I wouldn't be surprised if investors begin pulling profits off this COVID winner following its earnings tomorrow night, regardless of the results."
So many people bashing on yahoo finance. I like T and I have bought more ever trading day for some time. Dividend is nice and I grew up using AT&T.
After the next Dividend I am out.￼
Will go up into ex dividend date. Next year this will be a big winner
Short interest appears to have declined. Only 1% of float. used to be north of 2%72M share shorted
"So $20.78 in divy in last 10 years.....hmmmm, so price may have stayed the same but we are making money."
When are they going to start buying back shares to drive the price up?
With our without Time Warner T is worth $32+
Who said silver was a buy?
Why T is higher is T's future is now so bright you will need to wear shades as the 5G monster T has built feeds on the competition and GROWS
Looks like T wants to hit 30 very badly!
Today was only the beginning. Investors will look past the biased media/analysts and their hate for T and have to recognize how good HBO Max content really is. $40 soon.
"AT&THey Larry, bro, many institutions have to exit positions in non-Aristocrats. If they don't raise it by November, many will have to exit.Thanks ""bro""."

"You people should forget about the share buy backs,it wont help the price of the stock or eps. that much with all the shares the company has outstanding.T should pay down debt with any extra money they have.This is the only way you will see any capital gains in the stock of this company for the time being."
"As Inequality and homelessness increase in the U.S, there will be more riots. Eventually a civil war and Revolution.The more that the FED prints, the more inequality it drives. Nothing that the FED can do now."
"T with it's monster new unlimited cell plans with Free HBO MAX is now taking customers way from both T Mobile and VZ, If that was not bad enough for VZ , VZ is now running off both shareholders and customers , because of the Communist company VZ has now become as Han's and his EU one world order Yahoo Natzi's Censor what you can see ,read and post. That is about as un American as VZ can be .NO ONE in America should be doing any business with T Mobile because it's a Foreign company with a EU one world order Foreign agenda or the Communist Company that VZ has become ."
is the dividend at risk?
T is like investing in a bond with a little more upside
You know it will close sub $30...Has no legs
get used to T being a $28-29 stock with a 7% dividend. that's not so bad. maybe by late 2021-2022 will be a $30-32 stock.
"thumbs up if you plan to spend money at a gump resort in the next 12 monthsif so, how much (buying a MAGA hat doesn't count)"

"Having HBO on DTV and The mirror service of HBO MAX on Apple TV has never been better time in my 30 years of subscribing to a Time Warner services... I took all the money I saved on overprice Popcorn, treats and over price movies tickets.... and put those funds towards a 65” Sony Oled with premium Bose sound system.... I will never go to the Movie theater again... I made this decision way before Covid19.... Movie theater are not doomed... but let’s face the facts... even if HBO MAX stops playing new releases on the same day as movie theater.... I’ll still be able to watch movie’s in my home in less then 90 days... To bad Movie pass did not start up this year... That said.. Theater are going to offer a business model similar big Three streaming services ... They really have no choice... but what to do about overpriced popcorn??? Because Cord cutters will become big screen cutters, for sure... Then the RESULTS WILL be CapX spending will be budget down to nothing and theater will become broken down strip malls, and new structures are likely not going to be built for the masses .. Be sure watching at home or wherever on your phone, table and/or laptop is the future..."
I am crying deep inside.
T always fades in the afternoon
"Street has no faith in management. Huge salaries, extremely poor stock performance. CEO couldn't sell 10 dollar bills for 9 dollars, let alone sell a vision to wall st."
"But it pays that lovely dividend, hahaha."
"Just make sure you pick up your shares on any pull backs and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start or any higher price you want for them . T goes ex dividend the week of April 5-9 just make sure you have gotten your shares so you don't miss out on the dividend. Then sit back and collect the dividends at T just keeps going higher and higher over time . You have to hold one year to lock in capital gains ,"
Is this a good play long term for divedent stocks. Seems like dividends would buy me free stocks each year
"Calling on all mini-bus drivers. Get ready to back up the buses very soon. We are all predicting a great run coming w TV ad's, new max movies etc. This has been a friendly but quality service announcement from your friend in at&t hell, Spartacus."
"This rise has nothing to do with a surprise coming. The big boys are moving into dividend stocks today: even Pfizer was up 3% today for no reason, but for maybe its dividend."
"Stinkey did good today. Stock goes up to 30.86 after Stinkey spoke, and now it can't even hold 30!"
T is not a growth stock. Never has been. Never will be. It can’t. It is a union based company at the core. The CWA piranhas will not let them distribute profits towards SP and buy backs etc. They would impede layoffs and trimming of benefits. T needs to be bought 28-29 and then trimmed on artificial spikes to get some profits and then re load.T will never have a straight growth trajectory. Know that when you invest. It will simply try to find a higher range and will stay there for a bit before drifting down on news.The problem now is that there are SO MANY news blips that affect T from 5G capital cost to prima Donna Hollywood folks.
The Dividend Is Going To Be Sweet! Plus T Is Headed Up! Now That's The Cherry On Top;)
Look how sensitive T stock holders are to it dropping! Watch for the inevitable panic sell in T stock!
T is competing against FREE internet TV and Low cost streaming services like HULU for $2/month.Fierce competition indeed! This is why Direct TV lost millions of customers paying $200-300/month!!In response to lost customers ATT has raised prices on the few customers left!! That will only make the long term problem worse at Direct TV.
"Gonna settle lower over the coming weeks. Even more if the market corrects with the new administration. Wait for the big dip, buy bunch for dividend, and sell Covered Calls 60-90 days out for the premiums."
"Dish @ 33.67 . Mr . Moffett your price target of 15 isn’t happening Sir . Monday’s earnings, possibly a partner , spectrum news etc . Dish 40 ~ 45 next week . Have owned for 19 years and know when it’s hot"
Time is drawing near for T investors. That 3 day weekend was the longest they've went without losing more money for awhile.
Folks I struggle with paying 131 bucks a share for tmus just to expensive
Nice to see management finally found their voice. Amazing what a little positive press and commentary will do.Duh
"Big week next week, we get the Spectrum Auction results."
Cole James Bridges....SMH. The FBI and JAG have a lot of work ahead of them.
Can't push thru 30 strikes. Why?
At this rate you are losing due to annual inflation! Dividend isn't enough to keep up with inflation considering the annual drop in the price too.
"I could only squeeze out .50 per share this month by rolling my Feb 26 T strike 29's to the Mar 26 $29's but I did do better selling BP Puts. The nice drop in the price of BP for the last two days brought BP back into the picture and I was able to sell the Mar 26 $24 Puts for .87 each (equivalent of per share). So in spite of a stinky last market day for Feb expirations, we were able to make two silk purses out of two cow's ears."
Why is this FLAT when everything else recovered 100% 200%+? AT&T CEO come out say something related to HBO subscriptions and EV car + 5G.
"The Managment has to make a statement or they won't satisfy the crowd. They should focus on HBO Max, expand it and develop it better, so they can compete with Disney or Netflix."
Let’s just call this what it is. A dog. Ruff ruff
A NEW DAY...AND NEW WINNING
@R looks like someone figured out spending upwards of 230K a year for Airport CNN Network isn't such a great idea. Zucker became the short fall guy that had to announce another one of AT&T's plans.
T snaps $30’s. Bullish rotation towards low valuation and dividend stocks.
"Your Dividend check  will arrive. It's income and drives the economy. Relax, you will get your Dividend $..It's crucial to a Company behemoth like AT&T...Just remember, it's deposited and then released by your financial institution/brokerage account. Relax it's coming. AT&T has your back."
"There is the T you all know and love, lol. What a hack dividend stock."
"@TEX, you are the strategist!"
"You ask why is it going down? no revenue growth, plus a $15.5 billion charge for Directv"
"I keep reading comments on the hope that another $2,000 stimulus check is coming. Let me see, we are nearly 30 trillion in debt, over 100 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and running a 2 trillion dollar annual deficit.When is the treasury printing press going to run out of ink. This is worse than the guy who has 50 credit cards maxed out, and hopes to find more credit card applications so he can pay the minimum balance on everything. Better prepare yourselves for the inevitable."
T is for long on dividend and short on capital gains.
Is CNN still the Official race baiting network of the Democrat Party?
Quite the stock we have here folks lol
"Crazy collapse coming after today, typical pump then dump by big boys for manipulation, T is known for that."
QANON TAKES CENTER STAGE AT TRUMPS RALLY...WOW !
OMG.......I just reviewed the posts of Superstar Bill Dundee.........they bleed misogyny and racism.....and that's not fake news...those are the fax jax..........
"The fact is T is now the only American Cell company where your data is safe. Both TMUS and VZ are now run by the EU's one world order were they are collecting data to farther the EU's one world order agenda. Up to you if you want to support the EU and Germany taking over the world without firing a shot or not . All so true you do not have to make any thing up. Germany has taken over 28 countries without having to fire a shot and they are working hard on taking the USA over from within , Just like the fall of the Rome"
ruh roh! read what CNN ceo said about covid being great for ratings. boycott???
Come on $35
"Started in the market in 1984, 60 now, had many holdings in and out in 36 years, never looked at a site before, until the down time because of the Virus, what a mistake looking at this site, been with T for 23 years, over 20K shares, will be getting about 11K in a div, Feb 1 in a Roth IRA, all tax free, Some of You people need a lot of help. I can tell You, the Virus wont get Me but reading the Post of some of You people will make Me drink GAS."
"Not looking good, going to break below $25 over the next few weeks."
i know if i buy more T it will plummet
"T is a growth stock. Just need pre-covid economy back as it was. Sports, concerts, travel back to normal. Streaming movies & sports = $$$$!"
got debt? got unstable div?got USA debt? got 10 yr skyrocketing? $53 oil. (was $35)?wake up!! USA cant print forever.
How come the DC mayor has gone scott free. She's the one responsible for the DC police not doing their jobs.
This should be the last retest of $27 before we steadily move up. Happy to keep collecting the divy until then.
Options Expiration today. MM's holding it near 29.....Next week 30+
Morning T ~ Tmus earnings today is worth watching. Any spectrum news will pop dish shares much higher
"You have to remember when reading articles about AT&T via Yahoo!, that Yahoo! is a subsidiary of VERIZON - AT&T's competitor.So what do you expect."
zucker good riddance
Constant decrease in earnings for past few years.. if it carries on. AT&T is done and we can receive dividends with decrease in share price all the way until it goes zero.
"I wish the Reddit group would invest in T, and screw those funds playing with it."
"The prospect for T's growth lies in streaming/content. It made it's big play with the TWX acquisition. Their biggest innovation was HBO Max and WW84. A dud (as measured by stock price). Further, not enuf new content + 3 vak seens in the US + year long cabin fever + states relaxing restrictions + warm weather coming = big trouble for streaming companies."
T is a great retirement portfolio stock IMHO. I owned some A T and T stock from around 1969 to the mid 1980's. I dont recall the stock appreciating much higher in price but like clockwork I got my dividend monies every quarter. When the dust settled my 15 year investment was fruitful. At age 66 at this juncture I am just looking for basically a portfolio of high dividend paying stocks where management makes paying dividends a high priority. The banks currently are giving me almost zero incentive in keeping monies there. I cant retire comfortably on a 4/10ths of one per cent CD or money market fund. As far as the bashing of CNN; I would assume CNN produces a significant operating income for T; every time I put on CNN I see a commercial within minutes. I recall when BP had that terrible oil spill everyone cried they would never buy BP gasoline again. How long did that last. IMHO HBO MAX will be the key driver for 2021.
I like Jim Cramer overall think he does a good job . I don’t buy his recommendations but do feel he’s fair
"+0,9% kind of cute;36-37 price target to sell (currently just holding and seeing how market develops)if tech sells off to below fair value this one will be sold."
"How many new subscribers were added this weekend to quickly announce a 3rd installment and the theater numbers were horrible? Just think, they spent $200 million to make the movie. Did they recoup and then some? I bet at a minimum 14 million subs to cover $200 million production costs easy.......I am betting 40 million subscribers. This movie hit the mark on a global basis......14.99 for a family to watch together. Awesome concept"
What’s the meaning of insanity?Buy T stock and holding on as investment dwindles
I rolled my BP Mar 26 $27 Covered Calls out to APR 1 and picked up another .14 in Premium. I might also roll the T Mar 26 $29 Puts higher but not further out to bring in more Premium but in the case of T I'm going to wait until we get a lot closer to March 26 to see how it's moving. If it hangs around this price by then I could move them up to the Mar 26 $29.50's or the $30's to bring in more Premium. We'll see what happens from here.
"Hey AT&T CEO, come out and say something."

Verizon - isn't controversialT Mobile - isn't controversialSpectrum - isn't controversialATT - are you kidding me?
I think that on Jan 27th AT&T will show excellent growth in HBO Max subscriber base and stock will have no choice but to finally start moving up to levels it deserves.
VZ on a tear today! The Buffett Effect. The story is told that JP Morgan once made a man rich merely by walking arm-in-arm with him across the Market floor. Brokers piled on the guy with special stock tips....

1000 shares x 2.08 = 2080 dollars in reinvestment income per year. Short T all you want. I'll keep buying and I'll keep reinvesting dividends and keep building my position. I'm LONG as long as the dividend stays strong.
183 BILLION in debt? You gotta be crazy to buy this. I lost my shirt following Buffett into low P/E high debt companies like KHC and AAL. I learned my lesson. At&T has one of the highest levels of debt I have seen. I don't care that they generate enough cash to cover the debt payments. This stock price won't move up for years.
"WHY BUY SENS NOW!From Healthcare providers who implant Dexcom, Abbott and Eversensedaily.""I have been reading these posts for about a year and think it might be helpful to weigh in. I am a Nurse Practitioner and a Diabetes Specialist. I have placed several of the 3 month Eversense sensors in the past and am a stock holder. I bought it a few years ago when I was being detailed on the technology knowing it would be a game changer. (I also bought in early to Dexcom and Tandem). Patients love this technology and were quite upset when the sales force was pulled due to Covid. It was really starting to catch on. Patients were asking for it and more insurers were covering it. The technology absolutely works and patients much appreciated the autonomy. Sensors are cumbersome and have to be changed about every 10 days. Some fail or dislodge. Eversense is a game changer. My only hesitation (and for my colleagues as well) was the 90 day insertion period. It is a surgical insertion and the site locations are limited. Many of us wanted to wait to push until a 180 day sensor was available in order to limit number of insertions per year and risk of scar tissue over time for longer term users. Insertion, however, is easy to do and was starting to be reimbursed.I do think that Eversense will end up with a pump partner for a closed loop system. IMO, Tandem makes the most user friendly pump and is paired with Dexcom. It is the best functioning set on the market. Medtronic led with the first closed loop system, but their pump is cumbersome and their sensors have always lacked accuracy issues. The new Omni pod is interesting. They have accuracy issues in the past, that they seem to be resolving with their new pump. They are the only tubeless pump and might be a good partner for the Eversense. So would the Tandem pump.Anyway, I agree with those who think that this stock is a long term hold and will substantially increase in the next few years. The product just works."

Recent article out how Corporations should torpedo the Republican Party. A review of those GOP members backing the conspiracy theories of a stolen election are risking the destruction of democracy from the party that has backed the denial of science and killed millions around the globe by forcing pollution and climate change. After reviewing how many of the states where these GOP members are funded by T it seems critical we ask T to remove their money from at least the GOP members listed. T is the most overlapping sponsor of conspiracy pushers and I will begin to move my money and services from T should this not reverse and help others do the same. PLease contact AT&T and tell them they are funding the sabotage of democracy and our environment.
"What's happening to T? Somebody knows something.If someone could help me please. I can't back up my truck because I traded it for a train ticket and a pizza the other day after someone said the train is about to leave the station. Now I'm stuck with a useless train ticket. And then to make it worse, someone yesterday said the boat is about to leave. So now I'm thinking of selling my train ticket and buying a boat. I sure hope someone doesn't say the plane is about to leave the runway. It sure is confusing.I'd like to see T drop down to the low $29's. Above $29 on March 26 but down to the lower end. $29.01 would be perfect. I want those March 26 $29 Puts I sold to expire worthless."
"Where does Yahoo get the previous close of 29.39? I guess the subtract the dividend from the previous close, so any loss the following day is after deducting the dividend...in other words a REAL loss. I just took big hits with both VZ and T, holding for the divs. NEVER AGAIN."
I nibbled today and bought another 10K T shares. No place else can I get near 8% yield on my money in a near safe way. Wish me luck!
Everything else up today. T remains a garbage stock. Need new leadership.

"It amazes me that few recognize AT&T's advantage over other media content companies (that Netflix/etc. dont have): a business model which provides not only media content, but delivery infrastructure (wireline, 4G, and soon 5G) that no other carrier or streaming company has. I'll hold my shares for a spell (12 months...or another 10% decline...whichever comes first) and see how things are shaping up then."

I’m not sure why people don’t understand that these dividend stocks are DEAD MONEY. Look at the charts. People don’t understand that when a company is paying out a BIG DIVIDEND then not enough money is going into FUTURE GROWTH. That’s why the share price is ALWAYS stagnant or slowly dropping
T is at the daily low and falling!If it was cheap why is it dropping and analysts downgrading?
Anybody think dividend safe?
What a beautiful stock! This will be a winner in Q4...just bought my wife an IPhone 12 at AT&T store...what an event! Store was packed with lines almost 100 yards long !!!

If you hold this it will climb back into the mid 30s but it may very well take a long time and it’s keystone is att now buying anymore junk companies just buy down debt and maintain dividend. Just do that only and it will get back up. Stankey is the only one that can screw this up watch him buy AOL or merge with IBM or something

At this point T should consider selling Time Warner too NFLX? DVD’s in the mail....who knew? 
"Amazon and other online sellers have decimated some sectors of the retail industry in the past few years. For instance, employment at department stores has plunged by 250,000 (or 14%) since 2012. Employment at clothing and electronics stores is down sharply from the earlier peaks as more sales move online.“Consumers’ affinity for digital shopping felt like it hit a tipping point in Holiday 2014 and has rapidly accelerated this year,” Ken Perkins, the president of Retail Metrics, wrote in a research note in December. And when he says “digital shopping,” he really means Amazon, which has increased its share of online purchases from about 10% five years ago to nearly 40% in the 2016 holiday season."

"AT&T's debt reached a record high of $190B. Ever since, the company has paid back tens of billions of debt, but the current pandemic raises questions.

Buying Opportunity
Mr Stankey has said maintaining the dividend is a priority. How much would it cost the company to raise the annual payout by a penny to keep aristocrat status? His comments suggest there is ample room for investment and debt reduction.
Cost of content continues to increase - just look at Netflix trying to create their own content & how little profit they've achieved as a result. T absolutely stole the best media/content company available today & the best part is they dont have to spend years trying to create one from scratch.
"OPEX keeping this under $30. Week after week, month after month. Cash cow for the wall st banks and funds."
The real fact is T's has always had the smartest people in the room and has changed the company many times over the last 100 years. Not an easy task for a company the size of T and to keep paying the dividend that so many count on for income. The changes they have made will start to show this year and the stock will climb higher and higher as they leverage all of T's assets on the 5G monster they have built.
"Kelly Gilblom and Bailey LipschultzSun, December 27, 2020, 4:44 PM CST(Bloomberg) -- Wonder Woman and her golden lasso exceeded box office forecasts to bring in $16.7 million for North America’s top post-pandemic opening weekend for any feature film this year.“Wonder Woman 1984” took in an estimated $36.1 million globally from 42 markets in release this weekend, after opening to slow sales in international markets last weekend. Even so, with most U.S. theaters closed, the film generated a fraction of the $412.8 million in domestic ticket revenue that the first installment in the series brought in three years ago.That may not be so bad for AT&T Inc.’s Warner Bros., the studio behind the $200 million film. “Wonder Woman 1984” also debuted on HBO Max on Christmas Day, which helped to break usage records, according to the studio. Almost half of the platform’s retail subscribers watched the film on the day of its arrival and HBO Max saw total viewing hours on Friday more than triple in comparison to a typical day in the previous month."

It is my understanding that Starlink will be selling some kind of phone service.

Poof! Just like that 1 years worth of dividends gone not to mention loss of principle
Nice close. Here come the upgrades. Enjoy.
Right now the futures are down a little. Does that mean that AT&T will go back down tomorrow?This is a very volatile market and that is very good for traders. My suggestion is to just hold onto the stock and collect the dividend. The price will take care of itself in the next 6 months.
IMHO the only way to trade this stock is to buy in the mid 28s and sell anywhere near 30 you can get. Has worked for a very long time.

"@R opined: If you are long T just make sure you place long term sell orders for all your shares a good place to start is over $60 but any higher price you want for your shares if ok , What it does is send a message to Wall Street they are not going to get any shares cheap and the more long term sell orders there are the higher T will go , Why because sooner or later you find people that have had their shares lent out to be shorted and their broker either has to find shares for them or recall the shares that have been shortedSo place them long term sell orders and sit back collect the dividend and watch T go higher and higher . Have to wait a year to get long term capital gains away ."
Hold out for lower price. We have until Jan 7 ex-date to buy and get the Feb 1st dividend payment.
closed at the high of the day...….ok
"I'm long T unfortunately. I sold March 19 $30 strike covered calls and recently bought them back. The next time we touch $29, I'm going to sell the 3/19 $30 strike again.

This has worked the last couple of dividend cyclegood luck"
Most of the open Calls are at $29.50 and above for next Friday.
A little value here and there and the Div. is not going anywhere soon.

"new news article questions whether or not T is really serious about selling Direct TV. T rejected $15 billion bid for 49% of DTV and is extending the auction to January. DTV has lost over 2 million subscribers in las three quarters alone. is T mgmt delusional thinking a declining DTV is worth more than what bidders are willing to pay? Isn't $15 billion for giving up only 49% ownership a fair price considering the bleeding of customers? T would still own 51%. meanwhile, T will fall behind in the 5g auctions because did not get the needed cash from selling DTV. I guess their is a reason analysts think T Mobile and VZ have better mgmt, because they do. While T declines in stock prices, the other two have gone up over time. Come on T mgmt, let's get it together and make better decisions or else VZ and T Mobile will leave you in the dust."
"I own the stock and I don't see it moving up a lot until you see growth in sales and cash flow. They need to put together 2-3 quarters in a row beating the consensus estimates and paying down the debt. If we get herd immunity and theaters open back up, there is a chance that T could have a good 2022. I see sideways movement and expect the stock to move up right before the ex-dividend date which is approximately April 9. Either you hold the stock waiting for things to hopefully improve next year or you trade to trade and/or use an options strategy to improve your return while you wait for things to improve.I do believe that in a couple of years, we will see the mid $30's againgood luck"

"You know what would be nice if the Government stopped the biggest data breach in history. By a Foreign company T mobile , T mobile was founded by the EU one world order to collect data. Why the government would let a Foreign Company have access to so much data about Americans , American companies and even Military data. The Government was worried about China servers and just let T Mobile have access to everything . Most because of the EU one world order. just amazing what a massive data breach and how a foreign country has so much access to the USA data"
They really need to cut the div down to .25 and pay down that debt to get this stock to move. Its the same price as 15 years ago. It would still be paying 3.5%. Sadly the old boomers that own it would soil their depends if they did the right thing.

The potential for Antitrust scrutiny of Amazon will likely keep them away from buying companies that caused the huge 1 day slide in T's stock price last week. A 10 year treasury that now sits at around 2.1% will also provide some assistance. Trump's war on 5G in China may also be a short term benefit. There is no reason why we couldn't see 33-34 again within a reasonable period of time...….

"Well lets see what other stocks you can buy with low forward PE's and going to pay you very well in dividend . T forward PE of 9 and pays you over 7%, PFE the DEM wits sold it down today because it's forward PE is 8.5% and it pays you over 4% I Purchased some today in the $36's You kn ow DEM wits were selling today because they are birth defect without a brain and need to be told what to do . LOL,LOL,LOL Here is one that has a forward PE of 4 and is going to start paying a dividend around 5-6% for what the stock is trading for today. Looks like some great upside for VTRS. , but you would have to have a brain to do what other don't want you to do . LOL,LOL,LOL and for sure not be a DEM wit"
Good savings account? Lol
they can't even let it alone AH!
TMUS forward PE is 40...T forward PE is 9...
"get the div, buy before the close today"
Nice! Got my dividend at 30.30 a share. Thanks Fidelity
I see people are dumping now that the divided has been paid. Waiting for a drop to $28 before I buy back in.
14 billion loan might be tamer than people thought for the must win spectrum?
Do Liberals see what J Bidet has done to their stocks since he stopped the pipeline and stopped deportations ? How much do their 401k's have to drop before they see it ? Are they stupid because of genetics or culture ? No father figure in the home ?
This is working out well. A close above $28.50 is looking good with only two hours left in the market. Selling February 26 Puts is up next after the January's expire worthless today.
"Message to ThomasL:Re: the jobs lost on the Keystone Pipeline, you were correct and I was wrong. I said 11 million and the actual number is 11 thousand. I misread the number when I looked it up. My fault, sorry!The other two numbers I posted were correct. 4 million expected job losses by raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and 15 - 16 million job losses if Biden and the Dems decide to ban fracking"
Deal is done. See press release
"Netflix shot the lights out!That should bode well for HBOmax, imo. glta"
"Nice to see AT&T up, But not holding my breath."
Do you feel that? I have a sense this may break 30 pretty soon. If market starts trending down look out above.
WTH is going on with DTV?? Get it off the books already. Sell if for pennies on the dollar if you have to. Just get rid of the albatross.
This is dead money
"T- posters, shut-up and take the dividend!"
Picked up 52 more shares of FREE T this week with 1 more trading day to go.
So how did Stanky do on the call
if they lower divi I'm outta here.i have 1200 shares
Well it was a good day today. Just looking for a close above $28.50 on Friday.
T will at some point integrate TW and when it does the stock will pop.. long T collecting dividend ....
Reuben says: there are reports that TPG is offering above $15billion probably $18 or $17billion for a minority stake on DTV. AT&T .... JUST SELL IT!
...and to dust it shall return
Down again? T stock will likely continue to sell off now that the dividend is out of the calculation seeing as it went exdividend a few days ago. Fact is you can wait and buy it a lot cheaper months from now and still get the dividend.

Now that's what a PRESIDENT looks like.
Looking to open $1 lower than yesterdays high. Many who bought there yesterday will be wanting to double down soon. Hope soon is today.
"I have held a strong position in AT&T for over a very long period. I am not concerned about it’s daily fluctuations. I am here and will remain because of it being a solid dividend investment. However, my view is that traders in Puts and Options control the perception of the market view of the stock. Fundamentals mean absolutely nothing to these traders. Keeping the stock at low margins manages their risks and increases their profits.Admittedly I am bullish on the stock. AT&T has made some strategic blunders financially.Going forward, the leadership team has my confidence, steering through 2020 against all odds, has increased my confidence in the long term outlook for increased shareholder value.We need a marketing approach that offset the naysayers, presenting with solid facts that give confidence in the long term growth and viability of the corporation.Another suggestion would be to reward shareholders with a special dividend for holding the stock for five years or more. Or giving them stock options at a discount. AssetsHBO, HBO Max, Directv, 5G network, FirstNet, Wireline and Wireless, Warner Media, etc,Are the basis for my holding the stock."
"T made a commitment to the dividend. THIS IS NOT DISNEY. Cell phone service and programming are solid covid resistant business. If people have trouble paying their phone bill for a little while, just think how bad the rest of the economy will be, T will be considered a safe spot. WE don't own theme parks ( closed) Movies that need theaters ( closed ) an overpriced ESPN with no sports , etc etc. T will pay the dividend like it has done for more than 35 years and in a zero rate environment the stock will trade up within 12 months to $36-38."
How Big is the Short position on AT&T. ?
"To each is own. Personally, when I travel to parts unknown, I like to have my GPS up and running or at least an old-fashioned map at arm’s length. Some people just like to wing it, fly by the set of their pants. And that’s fine, but I like to know where I’m going, how to get there and what are the hazards along the way. They might not be for everyone, but charts and fundamental analysis serve me just fine. Still hit occasional pothole, but no road traveled is totally risk free.S.L."
silver is real money. they need it for electronics. real things. not AMC or GME.
If T doesn’t break $32 today I’ll jump off my roof into the pool
No News is required for this monster to jump. This is just way undervalued.
People selling their winners today but T is not one of them
Why can’t the shorts get squeezed on this one like GameStop a quick run up to 300 would be tremendous
T just broke above 1996 level. Now I just have to live to 150.
Just bought 5000 shares at 29.07
OMG...was that green that flickered for T a moment ago. Could today break the red streak ?
"I hold this stock for the 7.5% return, I wouldn't sell if it went to $35, why should I care if it drops from $31 to 30? This stock does it's job, after a few dividend payments my actual cost basis on this investment got so low I have no risk of losing money overall. Stay salty bears."

"CnBC keeps talking about inflation... There will be NO INFLATION in the numbers reported. The Inflation is fixed, regardless of the price of things."
Hopefully Stankey says something good about the HBO Max subscriber numbers on Friday. Stock might get a nice bump. Disney and Netflix always go up on better subscriber numbers.
Come on man. U will get your grass cut cheap again thanks to me.
How is Angry Woman Titus doing today ? 
This appears to be more than a simple correction or market fluctuation. Anyone with the ear to the ground hearing anything?

Another yearly dividend increase- like clockwork.......thank you T.
"Unconvinced it's a cult? Former VP Mike Pence denounces characterization of defense lawyers account of Insurrection Day 2021, but ""remains loyal"" to Drumpf. SMH."

"Yawn, some things never change. Check out the 5-year chart."
T needs to sell CNN and add hbo max to the DTV monthly cost
All my stocks are in green today except T. Getting to be a bad daily trend. Appears large investors and some small ones are losing faith in T.
T stock will likely be in strong downward trend for at least 3 months and maybe much longer! No hurry to buy this stock for the dividend because it just went ex-dividend! Assuming the dividend isn't eliminated or #$%$ This year T board didn't raise the dividend even by a penny! Could not afford it!
In my opinion sooner or later T will purchase Nokia.
Salary is in .. another 20 shares for me today 
"HBO Max is getting the new Denzel movie The Little Things at the end of January, Cha Ching goes the new subscriptions"

"When we get into a recession the FED will have to go to 0% again and maybe negative. Your T stock will revert to the 5% mean at around 35. But for us buying in the dips it's a near 7% yield for many years to come. Buy and hold for the future, you have to appreciate a value opportunity when it presents itself."
"It is funny that there is a lot of complaining on this board. I get it, the stock price was way higher than it is now. But the ave daily volume is in the 30 million range. That means people are buying 30 million shares a day of this stock. Yes that also means people are selling 30 million shares...but my point is, is there is a lot of interest here."
The CC sounds perfect.
"So now the Minneapolis mayor is saying they need more police because of the spike in violent crimes. It's going to cost them millions to start hiring again after so many cops quite the force in disgust. Nice going mayor, you really screwed this one up!"
Cheap is a relative term. T is now $28 and some think that is cheap but how will you feel when T is selling for $17?
T stinks still down 11 1/2% over four years meanwhile VZ up 22% purchased the same day I Obviously made a mistake buying T
Hooray! The price right now is higher than it was one month ago!
Hmmmm...let's see...who should I mute today?
"T is a near, risk-free 6% dividend payer with capital gains likely to $60 in a few years. Everyone should invest a $1M in T in thieir portfolio and dont worry about it for a few years."

Not sure what is happening but I like the price gain.

If I don't make any more adjustments before Feb 26 and if the shares get Put to me at $29, I'll turn around and sell March $29 strike Covered Calls. The March 19 $29 Covered Calls are currently selling for .88 per share.

Jim MUTED! He posts too much political boloney on a message board reserved for T. 
Ben is right T just might not have any more to write off for direct TV because T may have depreciated Direct TV over last 6 years. and that is why the price and timing of the deal happened now. So look for T to go higher in the future because T's new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX are still taking customers away from both T Mobile and VZ in droves

"Argus maintains $48 target:"" We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $48. A lthough AT&T reported strong bottom-line results in 3Q18, it still missed consensus and, more importantly, reported postpaid subscriber losses that worried the market. While gains in prepaid were robust, management will need to convince investors that these 'lower-value' customers will be just as profitable. A T & T has been busy with strategic acquisitions, completing the Time Warner acquisition in June after a major deal with the First Responder Network last year and smaller deals like the pending AppNexus acquisition. These deals should help AT&T to maintain its industry position in terms of both spectrum and content as the U.S. wireless market transitions to 5G and converges with the fixed-broadband services offered by the cable companies. AT&T surprised investors by announcing that it would 'introduce' mobile 5G in the next few weeks. We did not think that handsets would be available for 5G before 2019. If AT&T can actually get a real jump on mobile 5G, this could become a competitive advantage""."

Mobile data is better than fixed data. T-Mobile is positioned to survive. AT&T has unique opportunities, (content and advertising). Hope that the board of directors who work for YOU figure it out and stop making DISASTROUS decisions."
I’m betting we’ll see a dividend increase of 7% to offset the upcoming increase in the corporate income tax rate.

You need to get your shares before Monday Jan 4 2021 and the flood of new money starts coming in looking for yield. You have Tax loss sell still taking place so it will let you pick up millions of shares without driving the price up to high.
"NFLX is worth more than T. HBOMax is not NFLX yet, but it is also a small part of T. I honesty thin that T should spin their Time Warner/HBO properties off into a new stock. Do that and sell off the direct TV properties and you could unlock tons of value. The Time Warner valuation would go to probably over 100M when it starts trading as a public company. And the value of T without HBO and Direct TV would still be like 150M. Doing this move would unlock at least 50M in market cap I think. Not sure they will do this, but thats the only way that they can get the kind of multiple for HBOMax that it should have."

"After a long voyage from England in 1640 to escape religious persecution my family made their home in Braintree MA. Our family tree has many familiar names to baby boomers who were taught American history, sadly the children of today have little knowledge of early America. Throughout the centuries they have fought & died in many wars, from the American Revolution to Vietnam to the lost causes of the Middle East. Suffice to say our family have given many lives under the flag of the United States. Today for the first time in my life I feel America slipping away. The Constitution & our way of life is under attack from the very politicians sworn to protect it.

""In total, Keystone XL is expected to employ more than 11,000 Americans in 2021, creating more than $1.6 billion in gross wages.""That’s close to what the State Department found in its 2014 report.In the report, the agency wrote that 10,400 estimated positions would be for seasonal construction work lasting four to eight-month periods. Since the State Department defines ""job"" as ""one position that is filled for 1 year,"" that would equate to approximately 3,900 jobs over a two-year period. In short: Most of the estimated jobs were temporary.The State Department forecasted that no more than 50 jobs, some of which could be located in Canada, would be required to maintain the pipeline. Thirty-five of them would be permanent, while 15 would be temporary contractors."

Ridiculously undervalued. T is a cash machine that keeps growing.

$T HBO MAX is now realizing that they have a great IP to compete with Disney and Netflix with the new Game of thrones prequel premiering next year and all the others prequels being discussed besides the harry potter series and all the DC stuff coming in and launching in Latin America in the 2nd Quarter and then launching in Europe later this year HBO MAX 2021 and 2022 will be at least interesting for HBO MAX
"Playing now on HBO Max...CNN special report ""The Trump Insurrection"". MUST SEE!!!"
"If you only value AT&T telecom business on par with Verizon, and discounted all others business (media, streaming, etc) as worthless, then T should be trading around $32. If you value the other assets inline with Disney and Netflix, then T would be trading around $60."
"AT&T, is what it is, You just need to figure out what that is. Stop putting toothpicks under your Fingernails everyday, Get your Div. every quarter and hope it can go up in value. That's what it is."
Will ATT's CNN begin the discussion about the 25th amendment to bring ratings up again?
Please start building a base ABOVE 30. Got 10k shares that need to be sold around 40!
We'll call it a winning day if it stays above $30.
"All the T haters get ready to SAY OH NO up T goes , WOW when T reports earnings and shows just how many new customer they have from T Mobile and VZ , T will be going a lot higher. LOL,LOL,LOL"
"What is the probability of this going even lower tomorrow?I am thinking about selling my Vanguard fund (VTSAX) and buying T tomorrow. I could put my shares up for sale and buy 90% of what VTSAX is worth today or wait and use 100% of the VTSAX (490 shares at $66.16 today)sale tomorrow. VTSAX will undoubtedly go up after hours today with the market being up. The difference will be about around 80 cent uptick in VTSAX so I would have around 32,800 tomorrow. If I buy today I can only use 90%of the value of $32,400 or around $29,200. If T goes down again tomorrow, I make a great buying opportunity even better. If T goes up tomorrow I lose out. Could T actually test the lows of $32.55 again. The last time I was able to purchase my shares at $32.63 and that is a 6.13% dividend rate."
"""Wireless infrastructure CEO expects 5G capex deferment after huge C-band spend.""Google this. You can't link to it. It's a Q&A with a CEO of a company that builds cell towers. You might learn something about the importance of the CBand Auction and 5G and how long it's going to take. He expects very little spending on 5G buildout for the next two years by the Big Three."
Waiting on this stock to got to $15-$17/share before taking a stake!

"JP Morgan prefers T over VZ: (Maybe $35 year end )""JPMorgan upgrades AT&T to Overweight, adds to Analyst Focus List. JPMorgan analyst Philip Cusick upgraded AT&T (T) to Overweight from Neutral with an unchanged price target of $38. He also added the stock to his firm's U.S. Analyst Focus List as an Income idea. The analyst left recent management meetings and the company's analyst meeting with a better understanding of expectations around organic growth as well as how AT&T plans to de-lever the business using organic free cash flow and asset sales. Further, Cusick believes weakening video trends are now embedded in consensus expectations. At $31 per share, the stocks' risk/reward is ""skewed to the upside and AT&T investors are being paid to wait."" At these levels, Cusick prefers AT&T to Verizon Communications (VZ). The analyst downgraded the latter this morning to Neutral""."
"As a long term holder of 3800 shares, most which were purchased at a higher cost, am in because of the remarkable dividend, and at least for now it’s taxed at a long term lower rate. I want this company to succeed and prosper. The current yield presently over 7% is enough to make anyone happy and maybe just me — but I am willing to give up another or a couple of dividend increases to get rid of some more of the debt and to get the Company back in better financial shape as long as it goes toward the debt."
I bought some more T today. I even waited for the dip. Bought more at 30.12!
"Here are 2 fast movers if you want to take the risk LGVW should be taking ButterFly public soon like next week or the one after and VGAC is Branson's SPAC it got hammered on Friday so should jump back higher Branson is taking 23andME public , T has built a real monster that no one company can or will compete with T in the future as T leverages all it's assets to drive new customers and services. T is just now taking their first baby steps with the monster with T's new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX and man is it driving NEW customers to T . Both VZ and T mobile are now losing more and more customers to T everyday , Can't wait to see the results in this Q report. For a FACT if you own VZ you will need to be out of VZ stock before the next earnings report or you will get slaughtered . I don't even need to make up stuff when it's all so true."

HBO is great for T unfortunately we are being dragged down by the rest of the company

The last time ATT closed at 30 or above was Dec. 15. Long time coming!
"T's Redness can't be hidden, Free fall under $20 continues."
Stocks rocket higher! And ATT? Oh...
"T now in the red although market up almost 600 points. Let’s accept it, T is a $28-$29 stockand will be for sometime. The positives (see earnings report) are neutralized by management.During earnings call, the one question about DTV, and T mgt avoided the question. They also gave little confidence comment for 2021...1% growth. A dividend stock that will bounce around at a high 20’s range for a while. But hey, the 7% dividend is safe."
ThisShould be 40Min what r people thinkng?
"@Mygirlfriendishalfmyage fair warning by the end of the day I plan to hold more shares than you! Who was the legend with 35,000 shares? He deleted his post. That guy effs."
Payday tomorrow. Pop a cork!
Listen to @R - don’t sell your stocks cheap
AT&T has around 10 billion dollars in free cash flow after they’ve paid the dividend. This should be used to chop down the debt or buy back shares.
1800 shares averaged to $30.50 It’s better for this to go up slowly. It’s going up pretty fast all things considered. Will it find new support over $30 that is the next big step
"AT&T makes a deal to get over $15 billion and reduce dept. Stock goes up 0.1%Roku gets a deal to carry HBO, their stock goes up 15% adding 15 billion to market cap. Only on wall street can this happen!"
"Most of you keep struggling and complaining. I keep telling you how to make money but few of you listen. I even post my trades so you can easily check the prices and the times but few of you listen. If you want to keep struggling and complaining about T that's up to you. It's your choice. If you choose to go that way, stop complaining."
Was it ATT'S philosophy to mock the President of The United States?You bet it was.
"Buffets buy of VZ , dish earnings coming up , spectrum news . Dish is going to pop quickly"
"Look at that all the T Haters are crying this morning as T is Green and up LOL,LOL,LOL"
Dead Money definitely heading to $20 or lower in 2021.
"Sold t and bought Apple on Friday. Was a good move for now. Will be back in T soon, I do think hbo Max will be a big help eventually. But they really need to cut off loose ends with the extra unnecessary ventures."
Add the last divi to this price and T is over 30 again. Just saying...and hoping...for more T gains.
"This company has the WORST communications/PR group. The CEO may be mute, but at least try to manage the narrative. Thats what these groups are for!"
"825,000 shares traded AH and currently up a penny. so you can quiet down about the AH ""sell off "" that movement means nothing."
More debt means dividend less safe
Expect blowout MAX sub numbers but will remain range bound for at least another 2 quarters between 28 and 31. After that you can say bye bye to the 7% yield forever.
T please spin off Warner/HBO. What are you a phone company or a media company. The market is pricing you as a phone company. Use the spin off proceeds of $100B to pay down debt
Looks like Facebook has finally taken sides with the DEMS. So much for being Neutral.The U.S censorship system is getting close to Chinas.
"Jack and Mach2 responding to Superstar Bill Dundee's message below are typical of the thinking on this board. You shoot the messenger and ignore the message. Well here's exactly what T said during the recent investor conference:During 2024 AT&T expects to reach a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 or lower and to do it the company expects to us all cash flows after dividends to pay down the debt and will continue to look for opportunities to monetize non-strategic assets. The company also does not plan to repurchase shares during this period. 2021 guidance, announced in January 2021, remains unchanged. Revenue growth - 1% range. EPS to be stable with 2020. Capital Investment - $21B, FCF = $26B.So basically no growth in 2021! Also, seems to me that if the FCF is going to remain at $26B, with a $14 Dividend and with $21B committed to additional Capital Investments, the current Cash balance is going to start to suffer. $14B = $21B is $9B more than the $26B FCF. Where is the difference going to come from other than the current Cash balance. If Cash starts to get squeezed further, reducing the dividend could be next in sight. It's not my position that it will, but the numbers don't add up!"
"Just what can the United States make that can compete? Cell phones? They're all made on the other side of the planet. I remember when ATT ""was"" an American company. Today ATT makes nothing. Raise wages to 15 bucks? Stankey probably thinks that's going to solve our problems."
"The economic downturn that we are currently experiencing is making the last recession look like a Sunday picnic. Yes, 2008 and 2009 were bad, but they weren’t anything like this. Unprecedented intervention by the Federal Reserve has allowed the rich to get even richer during this crisis, but meanwhile millions upon millions of ordinary Americans are deeply suffering. Unfortunately, what we have gone through so far is just the beginning."
Last few days I am up a few percent on one portfolio just by holding T.The dollar strenght has increase the value of T.
"Just got back from the dentist, WOW! Anyone find any news for the move up?"
What happened? You don't get this kind of move without news behind it and some group has seen the news before us.
T has way to many assets that are mismanaged. They need to break this up to get the value out of it. CNN could have had a comeback if there was a real management team at T.
"Thought is was too good to be true. Hope for a late day push, really want to close above 29."
"T = 28.65-0.73 (-2.48%) 10 yr = 10-Yr Bond$1.5180It is headed to 2% real, real fast."
Lock in 7% the rest of your life
"Ok, tell me why I want to own T. Down today, down last 5 days, down last month, down last 6 months, down last year."
One heck of a stock!
"Later this year and next year, investors will fall into two categories...those who bought in at the 7% dividend level AND those bought at the 5-6% dividend level."
T or $VZ if I am opening a new position in one these?
"If you only invest in T, that is your problem. T + growth stocks = a good mix."
T would have to be a lot cheaper to make up for its problems and dog performance
"LOL,LOL,LOL T has built a monster and the world is just now learning how T's monster can leverage it's assets to drive sales , First baby step was T's new unlimited cell plans and they give you HBO MAX for FREE , LOOK out world T's shin new Monster is learning how to FEED on the competition as that monster is now taking customers away from both VZ and T mobile but the gravy is people can drop NFLX and save even more money because they don't need NFLX with HBO MAX , LOL,LOL,LOL T's MONSTER is ALIVE and NO one company by themselves has the assets to compete with the monster T has built, By the smartest people in the room"
"DISH owns sling, the fast growing TV streaming business that is grabbing the cord cutters leaving ATT and Comcast who charge double. I hear now DISH will team up with AMZN to launch a nationwide 5G cellular phone service to take on VZ and T. Exciting times!"
Maybe might be interested in T at a much lower price.
"Was looking to buy some of this ""secure"" high dividend payer, but no.Too many bad decisions, among them buying Direct TV (at any price) and charging $15 for HBO MAX. And then the quarterly earnings declines.I'll stick with MREITs for my divis and tech for cap gains.Maybe it's time for midstream energy companies too."
Almost Fell off my chair when I see it Up $.14 today.
HBO max that profitable?? Dividend going up
CNN brings in over a billion in profits.ATT has been politicized for years.How many customers have gone elsewhere just because of that.How many billions in profits has this cost shareholders?

Will be at 30 before close
"AT&T prison is so painful... I am stuck here forever, but it is at least better than cash and bonds."
"I see some comments on here that AT&T cant even go up when the market does. I have been researching and following T for the last two years, Based off chart trends and what you can even see, ATT does not follow the lines of the S&P, DOW, or NAS. The market can tank where T can see major increases. Sometimes it lines up, but those are random acts. More times than not, T does its own thing. Best stock to own for long term holders. Im not going to say best time to buy, but it is absolutely a great opportunity at these prices."
This is one hell of a stock!
"Any shareholder of T deserves a year's supply of melatonin.BIG write off of Time Warner coming, Does anyone want my Randal Stevens (Former CEO) autographed annual report?"

T is going to take out a 52 week low while the rest of the market is hitting 52 week highs. Omg.

Get ready for sell the news tomorrow.
The real fact about debt is every shareholder at VZ owes $208 of the debt and for T each shareholder only owes now $96 of debt. WOW if you are a VZ shareholder you are in trouble and have no clue you are . FACT
T's price will probably rise the closer we get to its earnings report.
Sure are the big gains and losses being speculated. Going to $100 and dropping to $10. WoW. You guys will make a fortune waiting for those to happen.
"They aren't committed to being a Dividend Aristocrat. That's why the stock is down. Below are Sankeys comments. There will be no more dividend raises anytime soon. He's slowly approaching a dividend cut, day by day. Once you lose Aristocrat status, it's easy to cut it. His comments below are for the next TWO years.... so aristocrat status is GONE.______Our third priority is about continuing to be deliberate and strategic with how we allocate capital. We plan to use free cash flow after dividends for the next couple of years to pay down debt. We remain focused on monetizing noncore assets and using those funds for debt reduction as well. We’re committed to sustaining our dividend at current levels, and we’ll give top priority to debt reduction, at this time."
"funny fact: T-bills have higher total return than T, with lower risk."
The DEMS are giving children $250-$300/mo now and burdening them with HUGE debts when they grow up. The Millenials and Gen Z generation will have to pay for Pelosi's $1.9 Trillion debt bill.What a country. The Baby boomers have really messed things up.
WOW ! Dow Up 600........What Does T DO ? HOMEGAMERS......ALL Together Now

"This is how little investors are diggin' T these days......You can buy 28 strike calls for Friday for just .11 over intrinsic! In other words, you need just a ten cent move from here to start making money. As i've said before, this stock needs a sentiment boost. Maybe from a buffet or buffet-like person or from a secular story or from say, an hbo max subs story. i believe in the eventuality of things."
"Even the cruise lines which are making literally no money move higher than this, why?"
Wouldn't it be interesting if AT&T acquired AMC Theaters and added AT&T Stores to each of them after the pandemic? Theaters could essentially be converted to points of sale for AT&T services and WM entertainment.
the solution is simple. ATT need only announce they are exploring entering the EV and cloud security business.

Look at the article from smarter analyst today. David and will be sustained according to the article and Oppenheimer still has a by rating on AT&T.￼￼
Nice bounce off the lows.
Fundamentals don't mean much for this stock. Play the trading range and you'll be fine.
I know one thing T doesn't stand for......total return

Good price to average down and nice thing about dividend investing is we can wait for the price to go up with full confidence that the dividend is safe. T is solid
Cant find why its down PM
"It takes time and I am sorry for repeating myself, T is long long term hold, 23 years, 20,560 shares, Hoping they keep the dividend, And I am no longer reinvesting the dividend, I will receive around 11K in cash on Monday, Tax Free, Roth IRA, 44K a year, Tax Free, Tax Free, Tax Free. Sorry for repeating myself, But do some of you people get it. Because of reinvesting the dividend for 23 years my cost basis is below the value of the stock today. Thank you AT&T."

"LOL,LOL Spartan55 the problem you are going to have is I really believe in the Changes T has made and very sure that T is a much better company and it is going to be a real Monster in the future that NO one company has the asset to compete with T's monster they have built. The Fact that you and your buddies can move T up or down 25 cents does not matter to me because the old bid and ask use to be 50 cent spread . The FACT that should scare the hell out of you is T is learning to lever their assets to drive new customers to T. T's new unlimited cell plan with FREE HBO MAX is really killing it and taking customers from both T mobile and VZ . So once the next earnings reports come out VZ is going to get slaughtered and if that was not bad enough VZ with their YAHOO Censoring Natzi's are now running off both customers and shareholders in droves. LOL,LOL,LOL"
Faders got control of this stock.

"I am not recommending that ATT discontinue the dividend. So, if ATT used the $14+ billion that they pay in dividends to buy back shares, would that create more shareholder value than reinvesting the dividend? A 7%+ dividend will double your money in about 10 years.I believe an announcement of a buyback of that size would double the stock price in less than 10 years. They will probably do both. Food for thought!"

Genuine garbage can get $20B-$30B and anything with an actual future is worth a lot more."
The stock has dropped almost a buck since Jan. 14. Is that saying anything about the ER next week?
"$1,400 stim check? Hey, at today's price that's 46 more shares! Yeah I know I'm suppose to buy a new TV."
"Message to ThomasL:Re: the jobs lost on the Keystone Pipeline, you were correct and I was wrong. I said 11 million and the actual number is 11 thousand. I misread the number when I looked it up. My fault, sorry!The other two numbers I posted were correct. 4 million expected job losses by raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour and 15 - 16 million job losses if Biden and the Dems decide to ban fracking."
Dragged kicking and screaming to 2 cents green lol.
"Never a word from management to support the share price. The silence is deafening. No vision, no imagination, no ability to communicate. We are supposed to be satisfied with a dividend and be just fine with a market at all time highs and T trading at the same price it was 10 years ago. Beyond frustrating!"
"If anything they will not cut their div., but they will not increase it until they become more profitable, and the stock goes up into the 40's or 50's. Good luck, and happy NEW YEAR TO ALL."
Afternoon T ~ interested in this up coming week of trading. Earnings are coming and I am not convinced things are rosy
David muted!
Just remember if it wasn’t for covid T would be 45$ at least. So when theaters do open back up T will rise again.
Mr Alexander Graham Bell is ashamed what has become of his legacy.
Why are T shareholders anti-Main St? Who do you think subscribes to HBO?
This stock sure is a beauty lol.
"For the share price to go up, T needs sales and earnings growth. So the question is, once most Americans get vaccinated by June/July, will people go back to leading ""normal"" lives...go to restaurants, theaters, ball games, etc. If they do, I see a good chance that T will start seeing some growth. We have to wait and see."
Anybody here play any of the squeezes today? This Market is Bananas 
I AM THE GREAT AND POWERFUL OZ OF DISHWASHERS. BUT YOU CAN CALL ME BUDDY.
Decided not to travel staying home. Tacos with lots of meat cheese and tomatoes & onions. Go dish
Really nice up volume
Up T goes now that's some kind of stock and pays you over 7% just to own shares . WOW now that's some kind of powerful in a zero interest FED
Just like watchin' paint dry. Just wish it was drying at 28.73(breakeven) or higher.
"Ex-Dividend Date 4 Jan 08, 2021"
"Where's @R Loud mouth to share his ""Wisdom of Steel"" he's done it every twenty minutes last two days but it still went oops"
"Hope they put some go getters in the HBO Max department. What do these other guys do all day? There is no Roku Or Prime. I don't even see any promos or commericals for it. Man, just look at how well netflix is doing. That should motivate them to want to compete. And HBO has all the tools. They just need someone to take charge and run with it!"
Oh boy
NATHAN KILAR: go ahead and outright fire lil jeffie zucker...he is a liability...someone might trip over the lil sqirt...
why is T up?
Att please say you’re looking to enter the EV market and then say you’re working on a crypto currency... just start something anything and let’s get rich. Thank you
"For the vast majority, the theater experience is about the best way to experience many films. They pay a premium for that. The idea that they would be willing to pay virtually the same to stay at home for a nonlive premier is for the majority a waste of tight cash. It can always be seen days, weeks, months or years later at a fraction of the cost. Entertainment hoopla is greatly over rated. The greatest fans are those involved in it. Good fortune to T if T can pull off the HBO Max with its over rated schemes but I have my doubts in today’s environment. I’ll catch up with them on a cheaper streamer sometime tomorrow."
the vessel is starting to go forward
"Any news about the status of selling Direct TV?Last month, I had read that T was trying to sell it for $15B and the buyer would assume some debt. Subsequent to that, I haven't heard anything."
A Real.....SWAN Dive Those Last 10 MinsEH ?
"Pat.. how many shares of T are in your portfolio, how long have you held them, and what is the quarterly dividend payment that you receive? I'm curious to know. Tia glta "
Randall's pitiful management choices during his tenure at AT&T is a lesson (hopefully learned) that shareholders should be VERY careful whom they elect to the Board of Directors.
If it wasn't for the dividends I'd dump T. When is it ever going to pop? It has not moved a penny since the announcement of Warner pictures appearing on HBO Max. I'm thinking it will go up Temporarily for the Snyder Cut of Justice League then immediately go back down after everyone's seen it.
"I have a Buy order at $28.49 today, 5k shares. If it hits, then I can dump it at $28.59 for a quick $500. Not that I need it, though."
there goes little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff PRETENDING and IMPERSONATING to be a certified licensed CFP....buying BP at $31 and its now $21?......what school did you get your degree from?.....correspondence SCHOOL.....you're FIRED
"This is a gift from the market. T is a bargain under $30, and a safe harbor while the tech bubble unwinds."
Guys up a solid 5 cents today heck yeah baby
"The difference between the media plans of $T and $VZ can be looked simply as renting vs. owning. Verizon is leasing content from other owners and paying them large fees for bundling while avoiding the instant sticker stock of a large property purchase. ATT on the hand bought a very large, well maintained property that it not only uses for its own bundling but also rents it out and collects fees to pay down its very large mortgage. I am still betting on the latter strategy for the future. Just like housing and the fact you ""have to live somewhere"", the adage of ""you are always gonna be watching TV, sports and shows"" also applies."
Can you say 27.00 by summer div
This stock is headed to 10.00
What you will see as Wall Street drive T lower they are sucking up shares and T will end up higher . VZ you will see not recover the drop because VZ is now losing customers to T at a record pace . WOW this last weekend VZ lost more customers than ever before to T just check how many numbers had to be ported this last weekend WOW
"I thought that if I quit clicking on ""The Motley Fool"" articles that they might stop appearing on my yahoo finance news. Does anyone know how to stop getting their garbage? Maybe if enough people stop reading them Yahoo will stop posting them."
AT&T is a much better dividend stock than IBM. yet Jim Cramer is shiatty man.
T announced a delay of their Hogwarts Legacy video game until 2022.
"Have to post one more time. To prove my point, Yahoo took down my post criticizing Yahoo for their screening process. They are screening based on their own left bias."
"Over the past two years the company has spent nearly $8 billion buying back stock. Most, if not all of thosepurchases were at higher prices. The stock is down nearly 33% in one of the greatest bull markets in history.Our balance sheet is a ocean of debt and we are paying our top 4 executives well over $20 million a year excluding options. What a complete and utter cluster@#$% this company is."
"Don't criticize Dems push for a $15 an hour minimum wage, it will be removed by Dem screeners."
Even value investors gave up.
"If the economy is recovering and businesses are reopening and market is flying, why not this stock?"
Good day for T today. Looks like we're going to close of $29. Yo Dave2. Where do you think the price would go if they reestablished 100% of the dividend?
"told ya, 10 yr going past 1.5%"
Better get in! 45’in 2 weeks
I should have invested in a solid company like GameStop. I've done nothing but lose $ with T & VZ.
"Although I'm from Europe $T is being smart on launching first in Latin America, Latin America helped by 30% the growth of Disney+ so they will probably give a boost to HBO MAX"
ATT'S CNN participated in a plot for 4 years to bring a President down.No human being could withstand the daily attacks from this sleazy network's attacks.ATT is dirty money.
Could there be an upgrade next week as a result of today's cc?
let's wait until Friday when it's the investor day to critize when we have all the answers about their plans for the company
"According to my tea leaves, I see support for T around $28.40 and resistance around $30.70."
"Following the report, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan reiterated his buy rating with a $47 price target (59% upside potential).“AT&T has relative EBITDA stability and is focused on investing in growth areas” he explained. “Importantly, the dividend seems safe and debt reduction can continue with what we and the company estimate to be a 60% payout ratio.”The company will get more aggressive on expense reductions, he added."
"Moffett once said something like T was ""balancing on a knife's edge the ability to remain competitive and the need to keep the dividend at its current level"". I think Moffett should have a sitdown with the Barclay's analyst and so many others who say the div is safe, and in this recent upgrade, that the payout ratio is well within historical norms and concerns are overblown. It's this kind of thing that has me always doubting Moffett's cred."
William and Red Equal might be the same guy. Debbie Downers.
T is a solid investment. Most stocks are too high for me but T at 6% and no where to go but up. Long T !
"It has come to my attention that my enjoyment of gifs may not be shared by all. To be a team player, I have agreed to only include a gif on this board once every week. I want to fit in."
Then there is the loss of opportunity by keeping dead money in T.
Earnings info leak?
Went long at 34 nice divy but no growth
Grass grows faster in the winter time in North Dakota than T stock. At least grass does not grow back into the ground like t stock. Missed opportunities with capital and drop in price and dividend means you lose annually because of inflation. Overall you keep losing money annually! While in one day the appreciation of a healthy stock goes up more than years of holding t stock. SELL!
"AT&TSad to watch. Cheetah has been caught lying here a thousand times over the years, but he’s so old that he doesn’t remember it. What a terrible way to live out your later years. He’s posted here for years and never lost on a trade he says! Sad sad."
"AT&T can't even give Direct TV away. 50 Billion dollars down the toilet. Based on their acquisition history, I'm surprised AT&T didn't buy Blockbuster Video or Radio Shack."
"7% yield? Yes pls. I like how T took off when growth stocks collapsed yesterday......I believe in T’s cash generating potential (HBO, 5G) but also think it is a great natural hedge to the likely tech turbulence ahead (although I remain an $aapl and $qqq long......just part of a balanced diet and portfolio! I also like Michael Craft store as a short squeeze with 30% market cap short despite management reporting huge gains on top and bottom line....."
$34 by next Friday?
Real problems here when the stock cant even hold 30 for a single day
T will soon be treated like its texas brother XOM... $10 move coming hard and fast
is this company done. with all the bad moves they have made
T ~ my concern with this run up is it’s based on Covid ending immediately and things get back to normal. Thinking we’re entering a new normal. Visited downtown Denver Friday and it’s literally a ghost town . Buddy of mine in a high rise office building said building is empty might not come back
Resistance is at $30.09. Clear that and the next resistance is at $31.00. After that $32.00 and after that its old high of $39.70.
T is going deeper into debt! $14 billion deeper into debt just because of one loan! Trouble brewing for those who think their dividend is safe!
elliot Management takes big position
T has a face only a hack dividend investor would love.
Can we please stay in the 30’s?
Does anyone else have a good laugh anytime the stock goes above $30 knowing it is but a fleeting moment in time.
"If anyone is interested, the AT&T Preferred Shares (T-PA, T-PC) are at buy points."
"Soon everyone will know that T is and has been taking more and more customers from VZ and T mobile soon the damage to both VZ and T mobile will be so bad they can't hide it anymore in their earnings reports and the whole world is going to know that T is taking customers by the millions from both T mobile and VZ LOL,LOL,LOL"
I wonder if T is finally going to breakout of this pathetic trading range.
Everything depends on sub basically
"Happy dividend collector here. Nothing else worth mentioning with this stock, especially all the hot air left/right political circus junk that politicians and all cable news networks profit very well from taxpayers."
Undervalued but regardless AT&T is a Dividend investment for my Portfolio and it pays better than High Yield bonds...
T-Mobile is on it's way out.
Folks ~ I own T as well and certainly feel T has missed several opportunities to be part of the bull rally past several years and that’s to bad
"Is AT&T going to cancel FAKE news CNN, MSNBC, ABC,NBC, CBS. these networks spread to much false misinformation and lies."
"Buy now, get you first Div next month Ken."
"T seems steady, rising only 10% and moving in 10-20% range since March lows, not worried about a massive fall - will buy more for dividend"
"It seems that drop on earnings report - regardless of good or bad - seems to be the new normal in the market. I've been following many stocks closely and in the past year over 80% of them drop on earnings report, even if the report is stellar. So this is expected (and predicted if you follow my posts). However, the bottom of this dip - wherever it may be - is going to be wizard point to buy. Personally, I severe doubt if T will go below $30.50 before reaching a stable $33+ price. If next quarter is good, and appeal is rejected then - and only then - you will see T move slowly into the upper 30's."
You get HBO Max for free if you change your plan to the new unlimited data plan or you move your cell service to T new unlimited data plan . WOW VZ and T mobile are losing customers like crazy now all of them are going to T and dropping NFLX to save even more money. LOL you just can't make this stuff up
my commernt about insider buying by the board members was to imply their confidence in where the company value and stock price could be going....not to say their miniscule volume of shares will move the stock price..... .
"Ho Hum. Stock went Ex Dividend and price dropped in synch with dividend pay out. Now a day or so later and stock is back to where it was, dividend is locked up. Life is good with 6,479 shares, basically giving 12,958/year or over 1k/month"
"T is doing great but I hope it drops back closer to $29 again before March 26.If BP continues to rise, my next move will be to move my March 26 $27 covered calls out to the April 23 $28's and pick up another .11 in premium in the process. That's what happens when you trade options. You can always makes adjustments which you can't do when you own the actual shares. With shares, you either own them or you don't, no other choices. With options, you always have a lot of choices and you can always make adjustments as the stock price changes."
This will be the most over leveraged company in the world. Literally. Once it closes. Great yield and upside in time. Only trades at 10xPE but it’s a long term play. It’s one you guy. Reinvest divs in and forget about for 3 years
Beware February is going to go back to snow and freezing weather.
Did you forget about me? I just put in an order to buy more. At 30.05. Will I fill?
Up slightly on low volume again. Not a good sign for end f day.
T loves this trading range.
"Nice move today! Haven't been on here much as I have been watching my pipeline stocks soar. Long T, KMI, WMB, OKE."
32 tomorrow.
"Pat, you are creating yourself a very bullish message board by using the mute button."
Isn’t it fun watching the market rally while we sit here twiddling our thumbs.....
will come back big in the afternoon after the fed meeting
I see HBO Max as personally a convenience and it in my opinion surpasses Netflix and Disney. I have all of them but HBO Max is our go to. I'm thinking this is bigtime for AT&T. I am not just a Shareholder but also a Client.
"T has very low chance to be below $28, but very high percentage be up to $36 or higher in 12 months. With 6% dividend, it has very very low risk to buy at current price."
"AT&T Just raised there div. to 50 Cents a share, What a great investment, and company."
"If we are truly in a different era and stocks are more valuable than before, then T and other dividend stocks will soon see a bid. Or it's not different this time and the Nasdaq will collapse soon. I am leaning towards the former with the Fed printing trillions every year. If a 30 yr T bond delivers 6%, then the stock with inflation protection should be yielding 2% less than the bond. So T stock should be yielding 2% less than it's bonds, or basically yielding 4%. Unless you don't believe this time is different and the entire market is going collapse. Even then, all that fiat money will try and find some ""real"" yield because rich people still need to eat and pay those expensive houses payments."
"cmon get on the big red train, next stop 28 and then on to 27.50, but we get a divi LMAO"
Current ratio drops to .81!Lenders are going to make Telephone pay higher interest.
In Stankey's dreams AT&T is Dis+ ..... but in his nightmares AT&T is AT&T.
/BZ lots of room another 10 my best guess
The Discovery Channel is doing an excellent job of promoting their new streaming service. T should watch & learn from Discovery.
T is a perfect hedge against inflation and higher rates. $32-$34 within 2 weeks.
Where do I get free hbo?
I will be adding today. I'm about ready to retire and I am happy with a return closing in on 6 %. Already own 3000 shares at $35 so I will be averaging down.

"Goldman report on $T investor day: We maintain our Neutral rating on AT&T and our 12-month price target of $27 (-2% total return) following its analyst meeting on 3/13. We believe that AT&T outlined a compelling case for how its portfolio of mobility, broadband and streaming service have been (or should be) strengthened by its material investments in C-Band spectrum, fiber and HBO Max. As such, we have increased our long-term revenue forecasts. However, AT&T's $27bn investment in C-Band spectrum has once again relevered the company's balance sheet. Further, management's outlook for a doubling of HBO/HBO Max subs (to 120mn+) by 2025 is expected to yield EBITDA losses at HBO during this period, while investments in C-Band and fiber deployment will likely keep capex elevated."
Lol
Cramer tonight says T is too risky. Very bad news. The man is rarely wrong.
"IDK, but I think T will get some positive pin action when T mobile earnings comes out. Speaking of which, nice rebound from an unwarranted sell off yesterday."
Look at our little T bucket go!
"ers worked so hard today to get T down a whole 3 cents and yet After hours they are now losing even more money because T is now up by 8 cent LOL,LOL,LOL Get ready to say all you T haters OH no up T goes LOL,LOL"
whole system broke here. I see thousands of points sell off here. WE are at least 3000 points over priced here.
"Important number: $29.72. Why? Because at the $2.08 per share dividend, $29.72 is the cutoff to receive a 7% dividend. A big deal has been made about T and 7% so when the stock prices rises and the dividend rate drops (for new buyers), the beloved 7% rate will no longer be available and the talk about 7% will recede. Will 6% be the new standard for T?"
"Here we go again, getting pretty tired of down every day!"
How Randall Stephenson ever became CEO of ATT needs to be examined. Everything he did turned to dust -- everything!
We love CNN! This guy saved so many dollars for SSI!

"“Rating Action: Moody's affirms AT&T's ratings following $27 billion C-Band spectrum investment and sale of a 30% stake in DirecTV; outlook is stableGlobal Credit Research - 12 Mar 2021New York, March 12, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's"") affirmed AT&T Inc.'s (AT&T) Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, Prime-2 (P-2) short-term commercial paper rating, and Ba1 ratings on the company's preferred stock. The outlook is stable.The affirmation of AT&T's ratings reflects Moody's expectations that the company will be able to reduce its leverage (Moody's Adjusted Debt to EBITDA) on a post-pandemic basis to 3.5x or less within about two years following the company's debt-funded $27 billion C-Band spectrum investment (includes $4 billion of relocation costs) and sale of a 30% stake in DirecTV to TPG Capital (TPG). “"

Be afraid. Be very afraid. What you're seeing is the run up to earnings.
Civil War 2.0 starts Tuesday. Are you prepared?
"I have never seen such an attocious guidance for a company:-PlanManagement reiterated its guidance for 2020 and continues to expect adjusted earnings in the range of $3.60 to $3.70 per share on revenue growth of 1-2%. Free cash flow is expected to be stable at $28 billion with non-core asset monetization of $5-$10 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to remain steady compared with 2019 levels.For the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, AT&T continues to expect consolidated revenue growth of 1-2% per year. Adjusted earnings are expected to be significantly up to $4.50 to $4.80 per share by 2022 with adjusted EBITDA margin of 35%.While adjusted EBITDA is likely to grow in 2021 and 2022 driven by extensive companywide cost-reduction plan, WarnerMedia synergies, continued Mobility growth and AT&T Mexico EBITDA growth. Free Cash flow is anticipated to be within $30 billion to $32 billion in 2022..."
It's downhill
What about Parlor
Rough way to end the week. I hope March 12th will clear some things up and give positive direction. Maybe some upgrades!
Does AT&T still own the most reliable source in fake news?
"All you VZ shareholders better learn and quick to SAY OH NO down VZ goes LOL,LOL as VZ loses 1000's of customers daily now to T LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up . Look at all the phone numbers being ported to T LOL all new customers from VZ and T mobile"
"All the T haters get ready to say OH NO up T goes , Why because T's future is so bright you have to wear shades. LOL,LOL,LOL"
"great day for T, up 0.03%."
"T has to get rid of CNN....sell it, spin it off....it can’t be fixed"
Here we go I also hope it holds lets all give a push lol
Interesting T had trouble around 30.50......I’d like to see it smash threw it before I try a trade
Google and T rumor?
"If anybody is out there listening, a cash strapped ATT will throttle any chance of HBO returning to its former glory. A spinoff down the road would probably be more beneficial to stockholders. This merger destroyed the entertainment giant."
Daily press briefings. Wow! What a concept. The only reason not to hold a WH daily press briefing is if you are hiding something.
"The sale of DirectTV is long overdue, this stock can't move without the company dropping it's major anchor's which is the debt and DirectTV"
OK heres my take on next weeks trading. T will go to $30 by ex-divi day Jan 8th.
Facebook and Twitter need to have strong controls about what they can and can not do. Hope Congress and the Supreme Court do it.
30 is the line in the sand !
Easy come easy go.
"Why I bother to check this everyday is beyond me...my friends and I are at the age where our parents are dying..it's amazing how many are now T holders..via inheritance. BTW I'm not one, but the ones that inherited very well it seems the patriarch has held T in one form or the other for 50+ years. I looked at institutional holding and wondered why T is only 50% range. I know why, because most grandpas never sold a stock in his life..they only bought or reinvested. I asked a friend that just inherited a large amount if he was going to liquidate. He said it worked great for dad..nd if I sold anything he left me it would be like sacrilege. Definitely a different mindset from most hit and run investors. So that is why the 50% intitional investment. That is all there is for them to get. Why anyone would buy a 2.8% 10 yr and not T is beyond comprehension."
I’m content with price movement until auctions are over and we see how T sits. A quick sale would help a little for the process but looks like borrowing is still in the cards.
$T always provides a good red color contrast to the green stocks in the portfolio.
T breaking out on heavy volume. Buy all you can below $30. 7% guaranteed dividend + 33% capital gains (to $40) equals 40% gains in the short-term.
Fact: DTV right now today generates billions in free cash flow.
"I hate to say it but there's also a huge pile of open Calls sitting at $29.50, so $29.50 could also be in play for a closing price today."

"US securities regulators have charged AT&T and three members of its investor relations team with selectively disclosing information to analysts covering the US telecoms company to avoid falling short of Wall Street’s forecasts. The three executives made private one-to-one calls to analysts at about 20 different research groups, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged on Friday, after discovering in March 2016 that falling smartphone sales would leave AT&T’s revenue more than $1bn short of consensus estimates for the quarter. AT&T’s chief financial officer instructed its investor relations department to “work the analysts who still have equipment revenue too high”, the SEC’s complaint alleges"
Premarket is up. What will T do?
Almost back up to where it was last week. Almost.
and the daily bleeding continues
Good time to sell CNN.
"LOL,LOL,LOL I told you T was going higher . Why because millions and millions need income and T's dividend will be over 1/2 of your return this year that you will get in the S&P 500 . Heck it was almost 1/2 of the return you would have gotten in the S&P last year"

"HBO MAX this weekend had more 554k mobile app download without roku,amazon etc and Disney+ globally 2.4 million app download"
"I'm seeing and hearing much effective self-promotion (advertising) from Disney/Hulu/Disney+, but precious little from AT&T/HBO (WarnerMedia). Also, what there is out there of AT&T choice promotions is too confusing (AT&T, AT&T NOW, AT&T Yesterday, AT&T Tomorrow, HBO, HBO MAX etc., etc.). Is there anyone in the Promotions Dept. who knows how to publicise the product?"
A dime a day keeps the dogs away.
"AT&T BOD could spin off HBO Max, which means Shareholders would benefit. However, I don't think that is going to occur personally. I would like to see HBO MAX just with AT&T. My opinion but of course. I'm more interested in 5G"

"The real fact is there is only on RACIST law on the book and it is Affirmative Action and it is totally racist against white people , But today is the dawning of a new day for Affirmative action when Corporation like McDonalds start paying bonuses to be racist and discriminate against white people. Just the truth I have no need to make stuff up when it's all so true. Do you think Corporation becoming RACIST and paying bonuses to discriminate against white are going to help or hurt race relation in the future . I have seen the future so I already know what happens , but do you really think?"
whats so hard T mgmnt? you used Cnn to install a corrupt regime of your choosing amd you still cant increase earnings? whatsamatter? not corrupt enough?
"The yahoos that surpress ideas and opinions are like Beetlejuice. If you say ""Thought Police"" three times, they suddenly show up. LMAO!"
Here we go $25 and Below continues.
AT&T Fiber broadband gives you speeds up to 1000 Mbps. If it was available in my area I would get it because Charter is charging me $75 a month for 200 Mbps. (without TV) I like their strategy of concentrating on Fiber and 5G and HBO Max.
The move to $60 has begun...
"Is the dividend safe or is the guy going to cut it? He at least sounded committed to paying no less than $ 2.08 going forward, but was he really?"
The #vz Investor's CC: starts in 30 min @ 6pm ET. Two days earlier than T enjoy if you have both stocks since T lines up for their copycat session frihttps://www.verizon.com/about/investors
"falls short on guidance, whatever, they beat expectations in some really significant ways, HBO Max in particular far exceeded estimates and that was with only getting on Roku and Fire TV in the last couple weeks of the quarter along with WW84 being the first of many major same day as theatre releases, that just got the process of getting the word out regarding an amazing offering, whatever about guidance, reality is HBO max is going to grow like crazy and eventually reality is going to hit and get us back to mid-upper 30's"
we will hit $30 today!
T is bound to leap downward someday soon.Just look how it trades.
"Funny fact: in the HBO documentary Warren Buffet admitted he shorted AT&T, around in minute 14 of that documentary."
John Stankey said at&t had a monstrous day today..Up .02 cents.
*AT&T IN EXCLUSIVE TALKS WITH TPG TO SELL STAKE IN DIRECTV: RTRS
Worse than dead money!
"dumped hbomax, dtv is next"
"T is ridiculously undervalued compared to T-mobile, VZ, Comcast, etc. T leadership has to get more vocal and tougher."
"Acquisition approved and the stock drops...acquisition appealed by the DOJ and the stock drops...yeah, the stock market is totally rational."
"All the laggards are rising - oil stocks have doubled, financials much higher, auto stocks higher, etc. Only Telecom & garbage T at decades low. Yet, leadership says nothing as they collect their 10's on $millions in salary. What happened to our Activist investors?!??"
lol look at the price. I totally predicted this!
"T is the exception to the rule, A rising tide lifts all boats."
New 52-week lows every day & the CEO says or does nothing to address it.
"Hated today, but will be loved tomorrow. That's how it goes. Accumulate."
I have no idea how much the the return on the money invested in the 5G auction will bring. Does anyone have an educated guess on how much a $10 billion investment at the action will return in one year?
"Sorry guys, no $29 today."
"Poor people are looking to make a quick buck. I understand, when I was young and poor that was my hope. If you own a hundred or 3 hundred shares, you want it to go up 10 or 15 points to sell and make a difference in your life. This isn't the stock to do that with. Anybody with any kind of real money would love to get 7%+ return on their investment. CDs, MM will get you 0.5-1.0% currently. AT&T is the type of company these folks want. Getting a nice dividend check every quarter to pay for your daily necessities is where these folks are at! So please stop complaining about the price unless you want to brag that you bought some more on a down day. If you don't understand income stream and why you want one, then please just start buying GameStop or aluminum or bitcoin or Berkshire Hathaway for that matter because it doesn't pay zip quarterly either."
The election was the time to sell CNN.The value of the division ballooned to between 15-20 billion.Not now.
Recovery trade in play... AT&T ready to go back to $40
"T proved one thing that really is the only thing that matters is T can leverage their assets and take customers away from VZ , T mobile and NFLX . As T's 5G monster grows it will take more and more customers away from it's competitors as T leverages all it's assets . That is a FACT and no one company has the assets to now compete with the 5G monster that T has now built. FACTIt's ALIVE so all the T haters better get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
"amazing, isn't it, how heavy that little black dot on the graph gets, long about market close."
When will the C-Band auction results be released?
Saturday is the only day ticker T is not red
"Every stock at all-time highs except T - at decades low. Yet, leadership says and does nothing."
"T up almost 1%, I almost fainted"
"Hey, T is down only 8.39% since this time last year. add the divy, and you're only down 1.3%. Compare that to SPY index fund which is up 65% excluding the divy in the same time period. Hmmm. minus 1.3% vs up 66%."
Why do you investors stick with this company when you can buy into #VZ without constant drama?
One reason for the stock going down could be they are overbidding In workshirt and adding too much debt to the balance sheet just a thought￼￼
Not even half volume yet
With all this great news should pass $29.50 today
"Poor Hedge funds, have to sell their longs to make up for their short losses."
T should do a reverse stock split to make the stock price look reasonable.
Now sell CNN...
"one hour phil....one hour...put it right,or....."
"When the money is cheap, stock valuation goes up... Moses, 2021.."
I just added 500 shares @$29.21. glta 
"When you adjust it for inflation, this company is worth half what it was in 1985. Must be nice being a T shareholder lol"
This thing is hideous.
What an ugly looking chart! If only this were being shorted by Citron!
"DIRECTV is Destroying AT&T, Road to below $20 Begins !"
"Hey, quite simply I am a shareholder in T, NFLX and others in different industries.I point out T and NFLX, as I am a customer also, along with Amazon Prime, and Hulu.From a customer standpoint, I believe HBO MAX is the superior of the 4, 5 if you add in YouTube which I also use (but only the free version) so not really a fair assessment.I signed up for HBO Max last month, and could not be happier. The odd part is, I am not a big tv/movie guy. I subscribed more for my spouse, but have watched it every night since signing up. Will any of this effect the SP of T?I haven’t a clue. But don’t knock HBO Max until you at least look into and read what if offers, or try a trial at least.Just wanted to post once from a customer’s perspective.GLA"
This stock is like a homing pigeon. Always seems to want to get back to $30...
Buffett takes huge position in VZ. T left out in the cold again.
OK all the bad news is now out(23B spectrum price). Let's move higher over the next few months!
"I really don't understand how some of you hate this stock so much and still hang on to it. You need to put on your big boy pants, Sell it, Take your gain's or losses, and put your money somewhere else, Why wake up every morning and be miserable, really not a good way to live with all the other stuff going on in the world. So sell, Take your money and put it in PayPal, You will be happy their, mark my words."
Thank u for some sub $28
30 it can't even hold 30.
What is surprising is why Gold is not at $5000 at least with all the money printing going on.
My faithful T shares should follow the market higher. Not a lot of craziness with this safe stock. I like it. Long and strong
Does anyone like the changes the new Pres has made so far? Do you think they're good or bad for the country? Do you think the impeachment is a waste of time and money?
March 19th. Sorry for your loss. :)
"So many people talking about the debt but forgetting about HBO yet, 5G will just be fueling HBO even more. Long term bullish on this stock."
This mega power will now have profits rolling in. Collect the div and reinvest
Did anyone else add? I did and am enjoying it immensely. Look at the report!
I am rubbing my eyes it is so green. What is happening? A short squeeze?
"The Time Warner acquisition slowly making more sense over time. HBO max will be another money maker to contribute to FCF for a very long time. Oh, HBO max subs take a hit because economy opens up? Oh, that’s right people are going to the movie theater instead so T still makes their money with box office revenue. Game of Thrones spin-off next year. Let’s just say it’s 75% of what GOT was and we’ll be talking about how it’s the only show people are talking about again."
I will go Long T when Price can get above 32 . Otherwise not interested. No need to be early for this guy!
Why do I get the feeling Randall Lynn Stephenson is still running this company?Why are we paying Stankey 22.5 million dollars a year?What has Stankey done? What is he doing?
"So I got this email from E*Trade saying that if I give them permission, they will lend my shares (I assume to people who are shorting the stock) and I can earn interest on the transactions and have full contol to sell my shares at any time. I have not yet given my permission. I am open to hearing the pros and cons of this arrangement. Serious answers only please. Happy Independence Day to all!"
"""find"" me some GA votes!"
I don't care about the stock price I like the dividend
"Bought 1000 shares of T, this morning.I also increased my position in GPK. near ATH!"
"The 7.50% dividends have held up no matter what. Something is coming and I don't think any good for us all. I'm sticking with ATT and the 7.50% they are a massive company all over the world. We are retired and can literally live off our dividends.Cross fingers, but things do not look too good for us all. 90 percent of the companies are in the red......"
HBO Max going to take this to the moon on January 27th 
"Where's Stanky, probably took the day off to sail his Yacht."
Even the MyPillow guy has been silenced!! What has happened to free speech in this country....
Morning T ~ been talking about inflation for weeks now . My normal purchase of 10 chicken thighs for 6 bucks @ Safeway were 12 bucks today ! Salmon normally 7 bucks a pound. Today 9.59 . Folks inflation is real
Markets hitting new high. 46 more action than talk.
"Signed up for AT&T TV w/ HBO MAX. So far, impressed."
Economy grows T is perfect. VZ is better in non growth economy.  USA GET mojo back T will flourish. Cheer for vaccine and strong  USA economy 2021! Happy New Year!
"T is doing great today.Looks like Vagipuss and his one man gang (ANDY) from Cheetah Slamma Jamma grade school are out in force today. Oh me, what to do. Should I run and hide or should I just ignore them. What do you think? LOL LOL LOL"
so much rides on increasing revenue someway yet mgmnt just. isnt proactive..maybe some1 @ cnn can advise?
"Do not be surprised if the Stimulus vote in the Senate Fails and the Market gets shredded . It's all past do any way. Just remember Long term capital gain and you don't want to sell T for over a year any way. Just collect the dividend and wait for the Capital gain . Have fun if your read for a great CRASH If not get ready. Always remember it's Wall Street game and you are only aloud to play , because it all Wall Streets rules you have none . LOL,LOL Yes all the rules are now one sided because the SEC has not done their job in decades FACT"
"I realized it was not AT&T, my provider on Cell phone service dropping calls when I was infuriated. It was their service provider. Anyways, I thought it was mine, but turned out they had other carriers that didn't cut the mustard. I have some cheap friends but they complain about their service but my AT&T is strong. In fact, I have to let them borrow my phone. This is for real. You pay for what you get."
"Right now, with T sitting at $29.18, selling March 26 $29.50 Covered Calls for .63 each is a better trade than selling the March 26 $29.00 Puts for .66 each. The market is going to change before this Friday's expiration so I'm going to wait until Friday to decide which way to go. If I had to choose right now, I'd buy shares, sell the March 26 $29.50 Covered Calls and hope to get my shares called away at $29.50 on March 26."
"One subtle thing that is likely happening is that on the next earnings call, the hbomax convo will detract from the dtv subs convo. Disney had to turn the discussion away from espn sub losses and they did. We will start to do the same."
"Click on profile under this stock. They have 235,000 employees. They will be forced to lay off while paying the top 5 executives millions each year. John Stankey makes 10.83 million, Randall Stephenson makes 8.64 million all the while they are running the company in the ground. They are rewarded for the huge debt they have been adding."
T is hard to hold.
anything about the Lord seems to be a mystery to you...
The Mouth of Milwaukee is MIA.
will it stay above $30. it never does.
"Dear fellow bagholders, you are not alone as shareholder. We are all together in this sinking boat."
45 Senators voted that impeachment of a private citizen is unconstitutional yesterday. That makes the impeachment dead upon arrival. Dems just wasting people's money like always.
"Well, the VZ update put a big damper on both VZ & T stocks...Not bullish for tomorrow. Too much investment for little to no returns. I cant believe T-Mobile is trading at such a high multiple. I would short it."
I believe we will see T close out the week strong!
I'm at 6000 shares and counting. Yet Another Value Blog had a nice piece this morning on the space and on $T. They make the point I made - it's trading too cheap as a Telco and as a media company. Warner assets worth at least $150Bn.
if only little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff 123456789 had any T shares......he is one sad old man that has to constantly BEG for attention on this message board 24/7......and he wonders why they kicked him off the GE message board
Every time this thing goes up it seems to be always some kind of bad news. I had this strange feeling something was off about the quick rise today in S/P... Oh well back to the 28s
Buy low into one of the most solid companies in the world. Collect the incredible dividend. This time next year I guarantee t will be about $42. Good things always come to those who are patient.
Good and steady move. North of 35 is coming.
YES!! We did it. Now if they just don't adjust it to $29.99. Isn't this stock great?What a stock lol.
all we need is an aggressive short squeeze....Just joking!
"On a serious note. I own 6,000 shares. Anyone on this board own more? I hope so. I don’t understand the hostility I’m getting."
let's shoot for a limit order on 1000 shares someplace here today......increase the dividend payment and lower the cost basis....I'm waiting
At&t $28.90? Or only going higher
"Everyone please stop obsessing over spectrum and bands. There is plenty to go around, and more to be auctioned off in the coming months and years. The average consumer has NO CLUE about spectrum and bands. They only care about value. ""What do I get for my money?"" If they perceive value, they use that service."
"Women with 2 kids and $600/mo dole, won't work full time. They'd rather stay at home and take care of the kids, and only work part-time.FULL EMPLOYMENT is doable without women in the workforce next year. Thats what Yellen means when she says full employment by 2022."
annnd down again whats that now8 of the last 10 tading days and one of the up days was a penny
Up 1 cent lol.
Investors are hiding in T stock...thus is up in a down market...the more the market is down the higher T stock trade...
"For you all complaining about T, look at Pfizer. Stuck in the mid-30's for 5 years."
I told ya old folks to sell T and buy Bitcoin. Its at 60K and going higher.
T needs an activist investor who gets rid of the current board. Underperforming to all peer companies.
The dividends from AT&T funds my vacation expense.
"Road to $25 next Stop, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
We should test 32-33 by end of the week. This is a perfect setup for T. Time warner business will have huge growth with the reopening.
When do they pay out dividends?
"Brace for rear entry. Heading into today, shares of the telecommunications company had lost 5.98% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 4.19% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.86% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from T as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be January 27, 2021. In that report, analysts expect T to post earnings of $0.73 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 17.98%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $44.54 billion, down 4.86% from the year-ago period."

Who put mars up there MUTED!
No increase until HBOmax comes in as a profit.  cut 1/4 dividend if so.
Stairway to h e L L.
It will be back in the 28s soon enough. Earnings weren’t that great and debt is still T’s noose.
ATT IS WAY OVERPRICED
Barrons cover story this week is about dividend paying stocks.
Just Bidem my time when the timing is right I will surprise you all w my 200 shares... No more like 5000 but who here is counting...
T~ 20 plus years of owning dish have learned that it’s a roller coaster. However something big is in play . My guess is it’s spectrum or a partner
Going down quicker now than Piars Morgan on a Sunday Britain show... YIKES!
Looks like this move in T will be extended $32-$33 leading up to earnings announcement. That level has been difficult to get through and is significant from a technical perspective. The company is clearly worth more than what the street is valuing it now and if the dividend yield is an indication compared to Verizon then any significant revenue/earnings announcement will light a fire and we could be at $37+ in a heartbeat……..
Could not have achieved a one party dictatorship without CNN. Stock is being noticed that's why going up.
If you had some with covid 19 and were in the hospital for a long time ask them if they saw Dustin and his Army of angels if so ask they is they were shown the future
Typical ex day behavior
"T has 230,000 employees, VZ has 132,000 employees, TMUS has 75,000 employees, LUMN has 39,000 employees ... ATT has TOO MANY PEOPLE .... sorry,.. management needs to get with it, they need to reduce staff by 10% in the next year!!! ...."
Couldn't close above 30 again.
This is a story only a hack dividend investor could love.
29.10 I'm out. Can't take T anymore. I'll move that $$$ into CCL
"steady 7% dividend is tough to beat long term. now then, if they would only reign in fake news CNN or dump it."
"Just think, if you bought a year ago, you're down 1.52. Add the divy, and your up 56 cents =1.7% for the year. Yawn."
was that hulked out file clerk mary beth MB bragging about a $400 profit in AMC stock?......now that is something to brag about......except she paid $36 for 1000 shares of SDOW and it's $12 now.....I don't get it
"Does CNN have a quota that to work CNN, u must be a sweet talking fruit."
Remember to Buy the Dips and lock the shares up with long term sell orders over $60 to start or any higher price you want for them. T's future is now so bright you have to wear shades.
"well everyone, was I not right? idk why you all got so excited a few days ago. This stock is so predictable. Short this till the bitter end"
What happened to $39
"And with the games with the gme amc and BB. Come on, that will be short lived. Ultimately, people will gravitate back to value, earnings and reality.Or true companies. Not burning low life short sellers cashing in on weak, or close to bankrupt companies.Buy $T Buy $NIO BUY $PHAnd consider $PYPL $BABAThere are gems out there. The phenomenon with attacking low life short sellers will not end well for both sides.Stay safe, financially and health wise.Cheers!"
AT&T CEO must step down
Bat Sandwich Muted!
"4th quarter earnings Wednesday morning. Get in before they report because this is going to pop at least 5%, maybe 6% on Wednesday. They're going to report a record breaking wireless revenue, as their trade-in offer on new phones for existing customers has been a huge success!! And HBO Max sign-ups is going to surprise to the upside with the Blockbuster Movie releases being planned for this year, far exceeding expectations. By Friday, I predict a 9% upside in the stock price. The only thing that may hold this back is if they also provide an update on the C-band auction results, which may scare off investors because of the increased debt load they'll be taking on (which they don't need right now)"
Dumping like there's no tomorrow! WHY!
11 days till earnings. Can’t wait for the stock to be traded over 30 permanently
Why is it dropping?
One step closer to $35. Good
I LOOKED AT THE EARNINGS REPORT AND IN MY EXPERT OPINION T WILL BE AT $32 IN ABOUT 20 YEARS
After the Pfizer and modern getting fast hearings the Joey f d. A has fallen asleep
"I guess buying Walmart stock is out of the question now.""Walmart Inc. has appointed Randall Stephenson, former chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T Inc., to its board of directors, the Bentonville-based retailer said Friday."""
"Just put your long term sell orders for any higher price you want a good price to start would be over $60 , but any higher price you want will work and get ready to say OH NO up T goes . Next ex dividend is already coming first full week in April"
"Telephone isn't able to raise the dividend this year so - We can only give Stephenson $1,000,000 this year to do nothing.It's like the Steinfeld show - about nothing!"
I see 33 soon
"+4,25% T, iam really bullish with T, but... wow!"
Remember all the baby bells came from the forced break up of Ma bell aka AT&T. Who do you think will have the best 5G.
Wow! Now T is down only 16% from where it was a year ago.
Fasten your seatbelt folks! pps $31 is on the horizon
"Time to say Hello to $25 and below. Non-stop Sinking Ship since Year 2000, Decade Old Falling Knife continues."
"Where's that ""R"" guy that told everyone he was smarter than them and that T was going to higher? He did it its 31, 30 and 29. I guess he's curled up somewhere right now."
The bulk of my retirement is in AT&T I’ve been disappointing the last year however I have taken my dividends and invested in some other companies I’ve done quite well so I really had to factor that in to my total profit of AT&T that’s why I stay with it For the long-haul stay long and strong
"AT&TCheetah angry that his ""R"" alias is getting exposed for trying to inflate (or bash) T's stock price depending on what options he holds. The guy is pure sleaze, 80ish years old by his own admission and uses the name of an Atlanta Gentlemans club as his alias. (A Gentlemans club that bought hard to be able to have 18 year old dancers as opposed to 21). He only took the ""3"" off of his name after I called attention to what it meant. He's most likely a predator or was when he could get it up. Avoid that monster."
"has we enter 2021 the wheels of hbo max launching in Europe have started rolling, hbo max just acquired a Spanish tv show and will co-produce the 2nd season hbo max launches in Europe and latin america in the 2nd half of 2021, by the end of 4th quarter they will have some generous subscribers if they screw their launch in Europe has they did in the US"

"Back down she Blows off steam again just like another daily event. I parked the mini bus back in the overhead stall for now... Far as aristocrat status someone brought up yesterday ,,, I looked it up and companies have to do consecutive 25 years of div increases. However what the article on MF said it also happened to companies like XOM. T can afford to go around 3 quarters of no div increase that's it. If they don't re-instate the increase they lose Aristrocrat... That's what it said look it up"
print money and give it away and gdp will rise - what a concept - they great give away is here - does anybody think we can afford it?
Nice
Backing up the truck at $30.80-31. It's approaching an ultimate support for the stock. Strong descending trend line from 6/16 which T has bounced off 11/16 and 11/17. Secondary support at that price from the distribution from the last 3-4 years. Potentially could bounce off to $37+
"Shorts sweating bullets right now. What’s January going to be like, fellas? Ready to cover??"
"everybody's underestimating the value those Warner assets hold, HBO max is major and just getting started, while Turner sports networks along with Bleacher Report have huge value and growth coming thanks to legalized online sports books"
"Tomorrow I'll be buying back the $28.50 Puts I sold for .55 each on Jan 8 for a penny (.01) each. I'll be selling Feb 26 Puts next but the question is, which strikes? The Feb 26 $29 strikes are selling for .61 each right now, the $29.50's for .84 each and the $30's for $1.04 each. I don't want to go too high because I might get stuck with the stock and I don't want to go too low or I could be leaving Premium on the table.I might wait for a few days before making a decision to let T shake itself out for awhile before trying to decide. We'll see what happens."
Don't post anything to jinx T's takeoff.
"With the new shares added after merger, what will the projected coverage of dividend be from the combined free cash flow?"
I have a line in the water at 29.85 but no fish biting.
"Wow, what happened? The stock was up.34 right before the open and now it's down .12. That was quick! I still think we'll be heading back to $29 again soon so let's see what happens from here."
I've held this stock for a long time. The company remind me of GE with it's CEO and Board of Director which lead GE down the wrong path while pocketing $$$ for themselves. I'm really hoping a great company with great leadership will come forward and take over AT&T.

Just need to add URD to their Stock Symbol
"Thanks to CaliFUrnia, AT&T can no longer offer Data Free streaming to its tiered customers that have their streaming service with their wireless.The ability to stream LIVE TV and HBO Max etc on ANY wireless plan was a HUGE differentiator that bypassed throttling etc issues even on unlimited plans of some carriers."
Hate to speak the truth about T which was the darlings of the 80s-90s. But T's best days are behind long ago and for the past decade or so it really just showing a continued Downtrend which does not look like changing anytime soon.
"I can think of two categories of companies who do share buybacks. The first is a company that cannot find a better use for the extra capital (Berkshire Hathaway). Second would be companies where the executives get paid based on the share price. I believe most companies that do buybacks fit in the second category. Erode the value of the company to increase executive salary and short term stock price. ***sarcasm*** That is a brilliant strategy!***sarcasm*** The executives can just go be an executive somewhere else, like Walmart."
bring on 27
scare those puts to close
I’m thinking of doing covered call on T but never done it before. I wouldn’t think it would be too smart to do it with earnings release coming up. Any advice from the experience call people.
att should be 100% phone service and not outsource to call centers in the Philippines

"Looks like T-Mobile/sprint merger will go thru. Great news for T & VZ!! It keeps a tech giant (like Amazon or Google) from the 5G service sector & price competition should loosen up. Also, it will take years to integrate a merger. T opens over $40!"

congrats to the longs....maybe the comeback starts.?
LTD on this thing is waaaayyyy out of control. I don't get the excitement.Someone please explain what I seem to be missing. I want to hear fundamentals not subscribers to HBOMax increased.

Warner assets dramticaly appreciating in value thanks to legalization of online sports betting which is spreading rapidly state by state with full support of every major sports league as well as the sports networks which already see major increases in viewership and more importantly viewer engagement as they remain in front of that TV watching the game even through commercials when betting is involved
for alll you posters on here that are so negative on T stock. i recommend you sell what you own. and move on.

AT&T is a Very Undervalued Stock/Company and frankly We feel will go upwards of $60 pps.
Obviously the shorts and the call option grabbers hate it when I post backing up the mini-bus. Too funny I have time to sit and wait for 5G and the Expansion w Verizon and AT&T. One thing I don't get is how TMOB can say they are the best Network for 5G. In Southern Ohio some areas I couldn't even bars. T and VZ between the hills at least 2 bars and never a dropped call. You guys can keep your TMOB. I've tried most all of them. I have a tracfone on the vz network also and it works well...

There will no real growth until the split up the company....until then the management will continue to run this into the ground!

"On the daily charts, money flow has been up ticking over the last 5 days. DI+ is above DI-. RSI is neutral. All of this could be viewed as positive and hopeful. Now it is up to T’s ER to confirm it."
ATT paid about 48.5b for Direct TV and 85.4B for Time Warner. That totals about 133.9B. It is debatable how much value these assets are worth but it is remarkable that T debt at the end of the last quarter was 185.12B. At the same time T is investing 10's of billions in 5G. I am betting that some time soon these investments will reflect a much higher stock price. I still would like T to sell non core assets and pay down debt and streamline the company. Longs will be rewarded. Hopefully soon!
"Anti - Main St.No Republican lawmakers backed the legislation, which will become law as much of the nation marks one year of lockdowns from the COVID-19 era."

"HBO vs Netflix subscription data is pretty interesting. If AT&T ramps up spending at HBO to match Netflix, which is can easily, does AT&T suddenly get the same PE ratio as Netflix? I think Netflix crosses 300 PE before AT&T crosses 10 PE."

"Another 'brick in the wall' - $1.1 B down- $179 B to go! :DALLAS, Jan. 1, 2019 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- ""AT&T Inc.* announced today that it has completed the sale of its data center colocation operations and assets to Brookfield Infrastructure and its institutional partners (""Brookfield""). The company previously announced a strategic alliance with Brookfield that included the transfer of these operations and assets.Brookfield has established a wholly owned company, Evoque Data Center SolutionsTM (""Evoque""), to own and operate the assets. Customer contracts, employees supporting the colocation operations, fixed assets, leases and specified owned facilities have been transferred to Brookfield.Evoque joins AT&T's global colocation ecosystem program where AT&T will offer Evoque's colocation services to business customers. The ecosystem program offers business customers access to 350+ data centers around the world.Under the terms of the deal, AT&T has received $1.1 billion, which will support the company's goal of reducing its net-debt-to-EBITDA-ratio to the 2.5x range by the end of 2019""."
Getting near 7.5% yield. ooooh baby. I'm touching myself tonight.
Make sure you have place long term sell orders for all your shares over $60 or any higher price you want and sit back and collect your dividends as T goes higher and higher . T should go ex dividend the week of April 5-9 2021 now less than 30 days to ex dividend again . Alright.

Anyone else take advantage of the sale today? Just what I was waiting for. Another 100 shares at $29.15. I’m happy with it. This is my saving account and it just got even better.
Would like to see this edge up to $34 before the June 12th news........hopefully a run back to $37 or higher afterwards. There shouldn't be anything holding it back after June 12th.

If the stock closes BELOW $28.50 on Jan 29 I get to keep the Premiums from the Puts I sold but I will have to buy the same number of shares as the Puts I sold for $28.50 each. If it closes ABOVE $28.50 nothing more will happen and I get to keep the Premiums from selling the Puts.
Sell the news
T back to the debt market. Who’s buying? Read were the big banks are managing the sale but that’s not the same as buying.
"Stankey sounds very Positive so Far. Giving great answers to that bum Faber. ( Fiber) Thank God that Idiot Cramer is off, He hates T."

You could draw a stock out of a hat and do better. T basically pays people a dividend to stay lost at sea.
Does AT&T actually know that no one believes a word that comes out of CNN
Craig Moffett is at this moment $10 off on his Verizon target ($66) and $6 off on his AT&T target ($24). Next time you see that guy quoted in an article you're reading just stop reading and move on to the next article. It's not worth reading. Or his partner Nathanson.

"This statement was made by Biomedical scientist and founder of Fibrogen company few weeks ago. Biomedical scientist knows CGM technology better then anyone on these chat rooms.If you truly believe SENSEONIC is going to revolutionize CGM technology in a few years, then hold for long term. It is high risk, but very high reward stock. It could easily 30X from here, don’t pay attention to constant gyrations in the market. I always get inspiration from this Biomedical scientist who has been long term holder of Senseonic. If anyone would knows about CGM technology, it would be Biomedical scientist. He is also Founder and CEO or FibroGen, inc. A company 3 times larger then Senseonic.“I have to say I have been a long time believer in this Company and have been dumbfounded on why it has taken till now to finally be realized for its value. I am a Biomedical Scientist who helped to found FibroGen, Inc and I feel SENS has more to offer in the long run. Very important technology and an enormous market that needs this type of continuous monitoring. I was a speaker at a Juvenile Diabetes Medical Meeting in Dallas Tx in 1981 and the physicians were praying for something like the SENS technology to help Diabetics become healthier and safer. Now it is here and with future work to couple the sensors with a pump to deliver the correct amount of insulin you will have the dream that has been the Holy Grail for Diabetic Therapy for 45 years. I am happy to have found such a great company and I think they should go to $100 and beyond.“"

My position in T FINALLY tuned positive with this morning’s move. Now wondering if I should unload some of the most expensive shares (as high as $36.85) for some TLH.

Has any trading day of the year 2020 happen with T +3% ? Strong outperformance of indices today !
why did this sell off from 30.87 down to 29.70
10 days to the announcement by the judge.
@R looks like you are right. Weak hands are pillaged by the strong especially near the end of the day.
With HBO MAX successT will have a good result!Load Up!!!!
"At close there were 23 call contracts in the money, there were 14,270 put contracts in the money. Puts were not being closed. Many will take the assignment if the option"
I have followed T since 2002. In the past 18 years it's been stuck in a $20-$30 range.(see max chart)When will it fly?
"So question is should I hold, sell or buy more. Inherited T last fall at 33.50. Sold early 2018 36.00. Bought again at 33.50 in the spring. 60+ yr and not great at stocks. Any thoughts?"
This thing should close around $30 today. Most probably slightly below $30.
TD Ameritrade finally posted T dividend to accounts at 11:28 am. At least two hours late by my standards!

"The only thing that really matters is T has built a monster that is taking customers away for both T Mobile and VZ which is a great thing because both T Mobile and VZ CAN NOT be trusted with your data now. T is now the only American company the Government can trust to protect America's data . That is why the Government gave the first responders to T and T's network because they can trust T to protect the American people, and their data T Mobile was founded by the EU's one world order and can not be trusted to protect America or the American people because of their one world order agenda and VZ has turned the Company over to Han's from the EU and it looks like VZ have been invaded by the EU's one world order as VZ now Censors Americans and Censors what you can see and read. VZ is now showing they can not be trusted with your data or any of America's data. Pick what company you can trust because your data and your companies data could be the only thing that saves your job in the future of the EU's one world order agenda."

Motley Fool is promoting T today. They say that the dividend is safe.
"T has some pretty big debt of ~170bil (but it’s equity ~160-170bil) Debt to equity ~1 (not perfect but can be worse ) VZ has some pretty big debt ~150bil (and pretty low equity of ~65bil) Debt to equity ~ 2.2 (pretty bad ) TMUS has pretty big debt of ~110bil (and about ~65bil in equity) Debt to equity ~ 1.9 (a lot rudder then T as well ) .So after checking those companies they all not perfect) . But difference is T is monster cash generator (3x times more then VZ , and x12 times more then TMUS ) and with mostly lower debt to equity they can pay it off quicker than any other competitors and for sure now it most stupid time to pay off debt because it’s pretty cheap (even trying to compare Netflix as a side competitor , it’s totally overvalued mess ) . What buying me other than those already enough to buy factors that T are really trying to improve its business with strong moves in different directions to attract costumers (yes Direct was mistake but you can grow the company without doing mistakes , and good part that T can afford it because again of good cash flow which will be only bigger ) . More then that they care about shareholders with really stable divs . I own 17200shares of T average of 27.32$ and pretty confident in my 8%/year (good enough already ) plus I can’t predict the market but I would say 50-60$ would be really fair price to T especially with those easy printed money in USA ."

I am (was) up 2.4% on my trimmed holdings as of yesterday. Lots of cash on sidelines. This puppy gets dragged down enough I will start the truck back up. T can be played just fine AS PART of a comprehensive investment plan if you were lucky enough to trim on artificial spikes and then cost average down sub 30.

And that one time the stock did not go that much over the strike price and I simply bought back in shortly after that. Of course all the times I kept the premium."

"I sold the Feb 26 $28.50 Puts on Friday rather than waiting because I thought the big boys might just push the price towards $29 again after dropping it on Friday to let the $29, $29.50 and $30 Calls expire worthless. The higher the share price above $28.50, the lower the premium on the $28.50 Puts so it looks like I may have made the right decision to sell the Puts last week rather the waiting. If the stock continues to rise the premiums on the $28.50's will drop and the premiums on the $29's will rise. I'll be keeping an eye on this today and if the spread is high enough I might just buy back the $28.50's I sold for a lot less than I sold them for and then sell the $29's for more premium. That's called a Roll Up when you do that. And THAT Anonymous is how you take advantage of the market to maximize your gains. Right now I've already got .71 per share in the bag from selling the $28.50's on Friday, let's see what happens from here."

"There has never been a better time for T, or any company for that matter, to acquire debt. Because of the low interest rates, T was able to refinance its debt and lower cost by 30 billion dollars.

"AT&T Inc.AT&T (T) is America's largest telecommunications company by market cap, with only Verizon (VZ) representing a competitor of similar size.T's current corporate structure stems from an intricate array of mergers since the old Bell System's 1984, but today's version of AT&T has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years. Still, T's valuation has declined recently due to two factors.The first is rising U.S. interest rates. With a dividend yield above 6% and a very recession-resistant business model, income investors often use AT&T as a higher- yielding bond substitute. But as 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have climbed to around 3%, some investors have been selling AT&T stock in favor of lower-yielding (but safer) fixed-income instruments.Meanwhile, AT&T's $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner faced a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit that T only recently won. However, the merger has now gone through, and we believe this should catalyze AT&T's share price to go higher in coming months.But for now, the stock remains relatively cheap. AT&T should deliver $3.45 of fiscal- 2018 earnings per share, which implies just a 9.4 price-to-earnings ratio. For context, AT&T's 10-year average P/E has been 13.4.So, valuation expansion going forward should be a meaningful contributor to this stock's future total returns."
"ATT/CNN ""We may think about selling it if its losing money!That's right wait until it has no market value, then we'll do something.CNN has been losing viewers since former President Trump left office at a record rate. The Atlanta-based cable news network dropped nearly half of its audience in key measurable stats since January following a brief post-Election Day spike, according to Nielsen Media Research.From Nov. 4 to Inauguration Day (Jan. 20), CNN averaged 2.5 million primetime viewers. But since President Biden took office, they've averaged only 1.6 million primetime viewers through March 15.CNN’s viewership during the 8-11 p.m. ET slot dropped 36% since Biden moved into the White House. Even more so, the viewership decline was even sharper among the key demographic of all adults aged 25-to-54, plummeting 47% during the same period."

"yeah, sure...$28.84"
I heard there is a consumer movement to Stop buying AT & T products or services and to sell T stock because T owns and enables CNN.
"Telecommunications giant AT&T rose 0.7 percent in the premarket Friday after an analyst at Raymond James upgraded the stock, noting it trades at a more attractive valuation than rival Verizon.Analyst Frank Louthan raised his rating on AT&T to outperform from market perform. He also issued a price target of $34 per share, which represents a 12.3 percent upside over the next 12 months.""The outlook for positive earnings growth combined with a strong de-levering story are likely to drive the shares to outperform,"" Louthan wrote in a note to clients. ""AT&T trades at a discount to Verizon of ~3.5x turns of EPS and FCF, with 250 bp higher dividend yield. We believe that the combination of positive earnings growth and delivering over the course of the year will being investors back to AT&T."""
"Might close the gap at 27.70, then hope for the best."
Stock goes higher over the next couple of weeks don’t forget reinvesting of dividends coming up soon
"T is the textbook definition of a falling knife, 2 decade ago was $60, A decade ago T was $40s, Today it's in $20s. It's not hard to predict we will see below $20 next soon."
"Not sure why Cramer keeps touting Verizon as a good dividend pick. I can currently get two shares of At&T for about the same price as one share of Verizon. That way I get almost twice as much dividend income, and At&T stock has much more growth potential than Verizon."
Comcast missed out on Fox. And Disney years before. Do they try to do something here?
We need a Short Squeeze! AT&T is completely undervalued with a Strong Dividend. We need to squeeze the Short Hedge Funds.....It's coming!!!
Another Motley Fool hit job article out on ATT today.
Concerning the next earning on 1/27: Assuming the communications business is as expected all eyes will be on the HBOMax numbers. A major increase in the numbers will be next catalyst for T moving higher. Am looking forward to this earnings report far more than the recent past.(with baited breath)
"Anywhere i look, i can see contradicting ex-dividend dates. Based on AT&T-s official site, it seems that actually it wasn't yesterday, but today instead.Confirmed record date is the 11th, by all means.https://investors.att.com/stock-information/historical-stock-information/historical-common-dividends/att-inc"

"While the world was passing ATT by the last 10 years, the quarterly dividend went up 9 pennies.And! The stock price hasn't changed.That's not stability. That's dead."

"What a surprise. T getting crushed today, already near decades low. Meanwhile, VZ up. Just not acceptable. We need new leadership & a new Board."
Me just drive from Vinnings Ga to Glenridge Dr in Atlanta. Me want to find best path for people coming on H1B1 to drive to work at their new jobs at T. Maybe a lot of homes for sale from layed of Americans at T. Maybe they should be moving in there.
"LA movie theaters might be opening in a few days. By the end of the year, they are all going to be open folks. Thanks to our last president. Not the current one."
"T closing price on Friday was $32.68, why does it show the previous close was $32.18? Is that the 50 cents dividend?"
"I suppose one could build an argument that T has been building a base for over a year, and another argument that it is building a penant. What's the saying? The longer the base, the higher in space? At some point, it's gonna make a move. Which way? Place your bets."
This stock hasnt been the same since they halted their yearly dividend increases. Another clueless decision by management. The relative strength index on this stock is plain out embarrassing. Has Stankey been seen this yea?? - our gutless CEO is nowhere to be found as shareholder value crashes.
"Its this.Lily, the T ad gal, is looking a little tired, and her material is weird..laboriously pushing big 5G logo set pieces.

Maybe when tsla starts to tank.."
My Analysts have a $42 target pps ...I personally believe it's very undervalued and is going to $60...But I have only been in this game for most of all my life. Remember me when it hits $60

My thought would be @ 35. Next week.
Another day of boomers bleeding this company red with Divs. DIS within 30 cents of their all time high today after cutting their dividend to ZERO. T wont compete until covid takes out the last of them. Good riddance
T will be falling off a cliff like it always had been for more than a decade. Will be lucky to see $25 in a quarter.

"Enjoy the div and remember, this is a 40$ stock"
Today close $30.01. That would make me very happy.
any ideas on when t comes off the mat and catches up to the rest of the market?
"Interesting comment from a different forum:The investor meeting they all but came out and said that until 2025 (if things go very well for us) you can expect no revenue growth, no eps growth, no dividend growth, no buy backs, and debt will still be relatively high (2.5 debt to ebitda).They say HBO Max will not break even until 2025 and that is with 150 million subs... So, my question is what is going to happen to Turner (and DirecTV) over that time frame? What will happen to the movie business? Are they still going to be giving away free movies with HBO Max? I don't know about other people, but I have HBO Max. Which means I have no intention of paying for movie tickets when I can watch it at home for no extra cost.Then we have to look at the competition. Both TMUS and VZ have superior spectrum positions and may be able to sell fixed broadband internet nationally while AT&T will be restricted to a small footprint if they stick with fiber. Someone is going to be on the wrong side of that equation. Either VZ and TMUS are wrong or AT&T is wrong. Both VZ and TMUS are predicting growth to come from adding fixed wireless broadband. If it doesn't happen they will be in trouble (especially VZ)."
Who lit the fire? Unusually fast little jump up. Fairly meaningless in the grand scheme.
"The question you have to ask yourself is Has T done things to make T a much better company in the future.

So under priced here. It should be at its high here. Not near low. Pays great dividend. Very stable. Beats money market yield period. Whole system is broken here. Nasdaq is so over priced . Needs at least 30% sell off here. Its that over priced. Whole system is a joke with Democrats in control here. They dont do well when they are in control of government in office.

The FED controls interest rates. They have INFINITE CASH to buy up treasuries like they are buying now. $120 billion/mo.People don't understand what INFINITE CASH can do. SAD.
the second best thing is having ATT pay my dividend but best is when short sellers pay it for them
@ cheetah...thinking of getting out of ownership in T...just trade options for awhile...think you have best idea...if mkt plunges i believe T will do better than most l AM CONCERNED ABOUT EQUITIES ACROSS BOARD. thoughts/options
If the price creeps up slowly and I keep getting the dividend I'm happy. I didn't buy this stock to get rich quick.
Just added more to my position. Great dividend stock.
"T, the $28-$29 stock. T appears stuck in this range because T is known as a low growth stock with that juicy 7% dividend. If the stock goes up too much, the dividend rate would drop below 7% and investors only want T for a 7% plus dividend. Personally, I would accept 6% dividend if I knew I could capture some capital gains. But below 6%, would invest elsewhere."

"Elliott back on board, for better or worse"
"T has been trading within a band for the last 20 years or more with a high of around $42.00, a low of around $23.00 with a midpoint of $32. During that period, the vast majority of T’s highs and lows closed above $28.00. Essentially what this means is, as an investing strategy, if you buy T at or below $28.00, you have a good chance of preserving your capital while gaining the dividend. If that is your intention, then you should do well. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future performance, but 20 years of data is not without meaning.S.L."
Looks like $30.02 close. Ex div tomorrow will open at 29.50.
Thought for sure there would be news this morning to explain yesterday's rise.

"Post resolution of the DOJ appeal will settle the stocks future, a positive outcome will push it to $40 minimum. Almost any outcome will be positive as the worst case would force them to sell some of the assets which will fortify their financials."
I have owned T for about 25 yrs. The reason I got into T was because my mother started with T when she was 16 years old. She worked her way up and retired in 1995. She is 95 today. She has not purchased any stock since 1995. I will say she gets a nice chunk of change every quarter. I have put a small amount in every month. I have it set up in a DRIP plan that I reinvest all dividends. I probably will never get to where she is at today. T has been nothing but a straight line for the last 25 yrs. but if you just forget about the stock it will be $ when I retire.
"AT&TTucker Carlson talking about Stankey right now. Stankey is very Liberal and Tucker just did a story on Bank of America going through its customers transactions after the Capital Riots and looking for extremists to report to the government. Tucker said he'd going to dig into what AT&T might be doing with all its data. Stankey said Jeff Zucker of CNN was doing a ""fabulous job"" last year......"
"The main advantages of the 5G are a greater speed in the transmissions, a lower latency and therefore greater capacity of remote execution, a greater number of connected devices and the possibility of implementing virtual networks (network slicing), providing more adjusted connectivity to concrete needs."

Sell CNN for $20B to Bezo and payoff that Godzilla debt.
"Accumulate here for great yield + upside, read JPM upgrade report, $38 next year, GL"
Free printed money hurts stocks like T.
Why would T go down tomorrow? At worse it should trade right here. Bad Market news is good for high dividend paying stock like T.
We all miss Obama and how he cut the deficit after we got out of the Bush Great Recession.
Now AT&T starts to trade normally. Easily to $35.
How come down 0.07 feels like it's up +1.00?
Just a coincidence that T jumped after Zucker announced he will be leaving at the end of 2021? Probably not. This will probably increase speculation that T will be looking to unload CNN in the near future. With this news that could very well happen sooner than later.
"**** HERE IS WHAT HBO MAX MEANS IN NUMBERS FROM ARTICLE*** HBOMAX could add an additional 50 mil global subscribers within three years, which would drive significant growth in T’s earnings stream. I estimate that 50 mil additional subscribers paying $14.99 per month would add $0.76 to T’s EPS, and 24% above FY20 consensus estimated EPS of $3.18. Additionally, I believe that T will enjoy significant margin expansion as they move their content to HBOM, because T will gain the economics of their network and cable distributors as they are disintermediated, which I have not factored into my numbers. The $0.76 in additional EPS could be worth $19+ per T share, assuming this EPS stream gets a 25x P/E multiple, which may be conservation given the growth profile. Furthermore, I think the 50 mil add estimate could be conservative based on all the recent positive developments at HBOM. As reference, the HBO platform currently has around 57 mil global subscribers, although HBOM has only launch in the US thus far. As comparison, Disney+ and Netflix have global subscriptions of 86.8 mil and 195 mil. On December 10th, Disney+ reported subscriber additions of 13.1 mil subs since October 3rd, and estimated they would be at 230-260 mil subscribers by 2024, both numbers were significantly above expectations. I think it is HBOM’s turn to show big numbers in the coming months. *consensus estimates from yahoo finance"
"In 5 years, T will reach $30. Thats for sure."
"Now hear this, Jasmine: Take your spamming elsewhere. We won't miss you either."

AT&T marketing for HBO Max is pathetic. I have had Netflix and my girlfriend Disney nonsense but HBO MAX is the King!!! It's the Top Dog of streaming but very little advertising. AT&T needs a new Marketing Director because it's easily #1 but not much marketing.
"OK --- AT&T bought Time Warner, thanks to a CEO that is no longer a CEO.The question now is: What is AT&T going to DO with WarnerMedia --- if AT&T doesn't MARKET and PROMOTE WarnerMedia as effectively as the competition markets and promotes itself???"

"BREAKING NEWS ! ATT MERGER WITH TIME WARNER.............HERE WE GO !AT&T Could Learn Tuesday Fate of Time Warner Deal - ReportAT&T Inc. could learn as soon as Tuesday whether it can finally move forward with its acquisition of Time Warner and put behind it the legal battle with the Justice Department over the $85 billion deal, Bloomberg reported.The telecommunications giant and the Justice Department are awaiting a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington about the government's effort to reverse a lower-court decision allowing the merger.Under an agreement with the Justice Department, AT&T promised to put Time Warner's Turner Broadcasting in a business unit separate from AT&T's DirecTV business. It also agreed to a firewall between the two. That agreement, which was intended to prevent a full integration of the companies if the government wins its appeal, expires Thursday, Bloomberg noted.Because the appeals court issues its opinions on Tuesday and Friday mornings, it would have to rule Tuesday on the Justice Department's appeal before AT&T can end the separation agreement and proceed with the integration, according to Bloomberg."

Don't say the news going to be different this time because there has been lots of news, both good and bad, in the last 20 years. And don't say the charts or the fundamentals are different this time because there have also been lots of charts and differing fundamentals over the last 20 years. T is what it is and it's a dividend stock and nothing more. People buy and hold for years and years without trading or selling and that keeps the price fairly steady...........no matter what. T is a $30 stock and if you're expecting either a lot higher or a lot lower, you're fooling yourself. Put those charts and books away, they don't work with T!!"

So the articles that I read always bring up that ATT paid $67B for Directv and may be selling it for $15B but I have not read any articles that said how much revenue Directv produced over the 6 years. I think Directv may have generated about $140B in revenue over the 6 years. I am thinking that they may sell a part of DTV and still get some of the revenue. Maybe a partnership that will include WB content. ATT may also be able to take a tax loss on the deal. Good things are happening.
"Very strong in pre market, up .45"
AT&T is up! But still grossly undervalued. Any purchase under $30 is a once in a generation buying opportunity.
"""Confident we're going to meet the 2.5x this year. We may meet it early. If we you do meet it early, we'll have a decisionto make. We'll have a decision to make, do we stay on the same torrid pace of debt paydown or do we start evaluating whether we commit some of it to other things like potentially stock buyback.""""So let me make sure I'm continuing to be clear and repetitive, and I apologize for that. But we expect to hit this year, and we may hit earlier this year, our 2.5, but we will hit that. We will see -- live up to the commitment, we're going to do the show-me on what we've said about that. So that's the first priority.But once you're there, then you have to go through the normal evaluation of cash cost of equity, cash cost of debt, what -- where is your stock price at, what's the value of it, where you think your value is, what's the best answer for your shareholders. And so we'll do that in normal course. We've done this before. We'll go through that same process. We will get down to the 2.5 range just like we told you. We're going to live up to that. But right now, there's a good opportunity for us to exceed that and even exceed that this year in the near term here.

This is one hell of a stock! lol
Analysts are projecting a beat in earnings estimates. Zacks has it a strong earnings quarter.

"The Government has said by their owe actions that T is the only cell company that you can now trust to protect your data.

This is a great stock for people that want no risk and a 2% return.
57 cent gain from earlier this morning.
Love how people say down 25% in 2020. Only because it was up that much in 2019 but this is normal for T price range
"ALL the T haters Say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"I'm long T, T is moving in the right direction and will benefit big time from Time Warner and 5 G. The price of T is an absolute bargain in this market.

T won't drop much and will be sought after for 7+ dividend driving the price higher. Time will tell..."

I just placed an order to buy back the $28.50 Puts that I previously sold on Jan 8 for .55 per share for a penny (.01) each. They will expire worthless today if the stock closes above $28.50 however options can still be exercised up to 5:00 PM (5:30 PM for the Nazdaq) on expiration date. A penny per share is cheap insurance to make sure they don't get exercised in the event some dramatic news event were to happen after the close today.
My broker at Fidelity told me I had to keep the stock through pre-market today to keep the dividend.
It's December 28th and At&t still owns the most reliable name in fake news CNN..
Look at time Warner pe before merger and compare it with T pe. Eventually T will reach time Warner pe prior to merger. This will give you an idea how high T will eventually go. In other words T doubling in price is not unreasonable. T is a STRONG BUY at this cheap level.
I need T to close above $28.50 on Jan 29 for the Jan Puts I sold to expire. Then I can sell the Feb 26 $28.50's which are currently selling for .94 per share.
Being heavily into 5G makes this a good investment in my opinion.Add the 7% dividend to that and it's a keeper.
Good evening T ~ inflation has been on my mind and now it’s coming . Lamb chops and salad. Go dish
Can't post anything that disagrees with the left.
Still waiting for news from auction before I buy at this level. That sizable added debt with lower guidance could have major impact.
Best ready for 5G.I would choose TMUS over VZ anyday. Also a far better investment than T.Best spectrum means less overhead cost due to less cell tower. 5G is 15x more expensive to set up and VZ needs a lot more cell towers (possibly through lease and joint networks).Also TMUS isn't necessarily in needs for mid band whereas VZ must have this. VZ's network plan will be in mess if it goes to 6G and beyond.TMUS is a clear winner
Just added more shares to my position. Thank you all sellers.
pls print some more money - this market is getting boring - mean while the golf courses are packed - who wants to ever go back to work
"POOR suckers that way over paid for T Mobile are losing their dASS just wait when the next earnings report shows they are losing customers to T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX LOL,LOL,LOL"
i just want to know how much of debt they paid down
Guess we might be able to start thinking about $30 again.
"People this stock will go over $40 a share at some point of your life in the future whenever that may be until then just sit back relax and earn $2 a share per year in dividend and every time it gets close to 52 weeks low buy some more ,the only thing you'll be sorry about is why you didn't buy more,I promise and if you can't invest your money long term then you shouldn't be investing,this is AT&T they're not going anywhere they will be around long after your grand children."
"Your investment timeline outlook is a significant variable. Everyone's points on the next 2-3 ish years are valid. There are significant heads winds in the that short time frame (2-3 years), but as Buffett says, the best duration to hold a stock is forever.I admit, I am in at an average of ~$31.50 for 4,200 shares. However, considering I am 20 years away from retirement, the compounding benefit of the dividend along with the outlook that they will get the Balance Sheet tightened up, the outlook is favorable. Key is to not put all your eggs into one thing and diversify with the an outlook that allows you to not sweat the price movements or chase returns. This is just a portion of my portfolio, that yes, I wish it was doing better today, I am holding for the long term. Patience today breads success tomorrow."
"April 2019 golden cross,the move was 28 to 37 in 6 months.30% for 6 months exact same setup."
"Don't forget, T is defensive...."
I think we get back to $30 in the next two to three weeks. AT&T looks to be spending about 25bill on spectrum rights. Might seem like a lot of money but it’s going to be what keeps their money maker going. And expanding. I’m looking forward to the bid results
I think Vagi what's his name and ANDY are feeling a little jealous this morning. LOL
Will T cross $30 this week? Maybe.
Going over 30 and holding this week
Is this stock halted ?
"Talk about manipulation. On Squawk Box Joe Kernan reported the quarter with nothing but good news. Phone accounts up over 800,000 vs 400,000 forecast. HBOMax doubling now over 44 million, EPS up, and its was on the screen down 76 cent! T should be up a dollar in pre market based on the numbers."
"Upped my AT&T position by another 15%. AT&T 5G-E making headlines now. Sure, some say it is just rebadged 4G LTE, but bottom line is that it is in line with 5G standards, which by the way 5G is a TRANSITIONAL technology which builds off of existing 4G-LTE standards/spectrum/tower/network infrastructure!The 5G-E nay-sayers are having their fun, but the facts (which 5G institutional&power investors already are well aware of) specify that 4G infrastructure is a VERY IMPORTANT part of the transition to micro-cell 5G. The moment AT&T turned on 4G systems with 5G capabilities (double the speeds of legacy 4G/LTE) which use existiing 4G/LTE infrastructure of course they will call out the fact that initial 5G is rolling out (via product call 5G-E). Great marketing and spot-on from a standards support perspective.....that is why I added!"
"Market could go up 75% while T does nothing and T investors will say “at least I’m getting my 7% dividend.” You can’t make this stuff up, lol."
What a stock right here lol
"Don't worry, T will go back down by the end of the week to $28.80. These people on Wall St are just playing games with the stock."

Im not spending a penny in Georgia ever. Not Pennsylvania either. No desire to visit Michigan or Minnesota. So remember when you cheat at voting Democrats then we wont spend money in your state.
"ATT is a BUY because it is at current levels where it does not belong. Basically, a once in a lifetime opportunity back up the truck or top off during this time with cheap shares. VZ on the other hand is a HOLD at best or a SELL at its levels. Basically gradual capital erosion with capital loss and an undefined future with only a make believe 5G product. No First Net, No license fees, no box office, no media bundle, no ad revenue. Just 5G.Coupled with the uncertain, bloated market, the choice to park your money is more clear than ever. Once T hits the high 30s is when the choice between the two blurs out and some capital preservation and diversification is warranted based on current circumstances at the time. But for now, it is ALL IN for T for the near long haul with minimal risk and a massive parachute."
This is a place for T investors. Take your politics somewhere else. Political post will be flagged.
Probably end the day in the red￼
Looks like Presidente Dufuss is going to get gasoline to $5 a gallon and probably double everyone's electric bill. But we can all afford it when we get one of those $15 an hour jobs installing Chinese solar panels.
Will T beat the consensus $.73 eps estimate when they report January 27?
it has been beaten so bad by the shorts
DEMS win T goes up. $40 by the end of 2021.
The direct tv spin-off just confirms wht we all knew. At least now AT&T got some cash to pay down debt and will continue to share in the dtv cash flow. Hopefully new management at dtv does well and AT&T in the future can sell out for more
Thanks Federal Reserve!

"Gotta watch how Disney does with their release of ""Mulan"" on streaming for 30 bucks a pop. If it's successful it would be big news for AT&T and HBO / Time Warner. Personally, I'm not paying 30 bucks to watch a movie in 5 of my lifetimes but hey I'm pretty frugal."
Will HBO add enough new subscribers to help T beat eps estimates when they report 1/27?

"Look for HBO Max to net an another 10m subs from Justice League, Snyder Cut. A 4 hour behemoth."

T is a value stock. Investors see doom and gloom but they are wrong. Look at the past 100+ years. Great time to buy especially for long term. Short term may be a little volatile. Long T.
"I've been with T for many many years. I've made money, how, by buying when its 27 and selling when it hits 31. Then it goes back down. Once upon a time it hit 41. Never again. Too much debt, too many shares. Dividend sounds great, but I've made more putting the money in other stocks. T is great when current admin goes nuts with tax raises, but invest the money in a company thats moving right now. Not every company is GME, but there is a lot of movement and profit right now. Just my 2 cents. This company always finds a way to go back to 26 or 27."
"Why the move in T higher last week easy, because Wall Street got the HBO Max numbers , Get ready for Take off because T is going a lot higher. Wall Street always gets the information before everyone else. FACT"
What will the TPG deal do to T's cashflow and earnings?
"“AT&T will webcast a presentation by John Stephens, AT&T Inc. senior executive vice president and chief financial officer, at the Citi Global TMT West Virtual Conference on January 5.

Viewers should join the webcast a few minutes before the planned start time in case the conference schedule changes.”"
Less debt to cash flow than t Mobil or vz
"Looks like all the Haters have to say again OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL , just be glade you did not own VZ or T Mobile They are all learning to SAY OH NO down TMUS and VZ goes LOL,LOL,LOL As T takes more and more customers away from VZ and TMUS every day with T new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX LOL,LOL,LOL"
My Dividend is in my account!! Thanks AT&T...Guess who's buying a new ser of Golf Clubs  
Volume for the next hour will speak on how we finish up today
"The rhythm of T is to flounder aimlessly until it approaches its x-dividend date or some news event. T could see a rise prior to its ER date if expectations are positive. What I find encouraging is that T has used last year’s very low interest rate to refinance its debt saving approximately 30 billion over the next 5 years. (Correct me if that amount or time period is off). HBO Max is no Netflix, but if it makes T money, it is no Direct TV either. I honestly do not expect any surprises out of the next earnings report and fully expect T to continue its floundering for the foreseeable future unless market conditions greatly improve."
GME headed back to the land of wind and ghosts.
"Dividend or not, Stephenson has got to go."

Any tax savvy people about? I'm thinking about setting up Roth IRAs from me and my wife. Is each of our limits 6k if we are under 50 or is that the total limit? Can I transfer shares of T straight into the IRA or would I have to sell them first then but them in the IRA? I like the idea of being paid tax free dividends and that there is no age withdrawal requirement.

"I welcome $40 as some have suggested on this board. Unfortunately, there are always the inevitable pull backs and the technicals are looking like the short term trade has gotten a little beyond itself. Bottomline I'm much happier at $33.68 then recently when we were down around $31+. That matters when several thousand shares are on the line. So don't fault me if I bought some cheap PUT insurance because I really don't want to lose ground if any type of gravity were to set in."
"What good is a 6% yield if the price declines 10 per year. Switch to TMUS before it recovers 135+....sure...the big div is gone, but you get the 5G leader....growth is the way to play the sector. Always wise to choose the best in breed. The TMobile/Sprint combination is taking share...that's the only sign you need."

I sold half of all my stocks today to have some cash ready in case Mr. market heads negative. I did not sale any T today but did lose some shares to an options trade. 30s next week I hope."
"So what do serious shareholders think about the ""Analyst and Investors day"" this Friday? Business strategy and Capital allocation will be discussed. I am hoping they will announce a resumption the stock buyback program. Go to investor relation to hear or get the transcript. Hopefully we will get some positive news that will help the price per share. Go T!!!"
"yep...all my stocks were in green today, except one. which one you say, well, starts with a T. lol"

T is a thirty dollar stock so don't expect too much with your growth projections."
I think I might sell T and buy this back when I am 90 years old.
This stock should be up at least another 5 dollars here.

"Use the $8B from DTV sale & buy back the stock!! T paying near 8% on shares, as the stock price remains ridiculously low. T needs a new CFO."
T's CFO needs to buy & put Bitcoins on its balance sheet. That may move the stock. T has to change its perception from doormat to innovator.
Shouldn’t T have a good chance to beat the quarterly estimates since HBO Max most likely has increased its subscribers?
19 jan = Netflix earnings. Important news for T.
TradeGuru MUTED!
T down .44 right now @ 3:05pm from yesterday so it's really UP .08 !!
"Massive correction on it's way all bought and paid for LOL,LOL,LOL by Wall Street"
I'm hoping T goes to $30 + soon so I can sell and say goodbye. The DTV partial sale won't even cover the newly incurred 5G auction debt. Poor mgt has buried T in debt and will take many years to get back to a reasonable debt level. Other ways to earn 7% dividend with less risk.
GO JOE GO!! SO FAR SO GREAT!!!
Pattern day trading.
"Yes that is correct T mobile is not an American company it was founded by the EU and VZ has been taken over at the top by Han's from the EU all to create the EU one world order, T is the last American company that is why they were given the First responders so they could count on an American company. All the T haters are from the EU and their one world order trying to destroy T. or they are from countries that hate Americans . TMUS or T mobile was founded by the EU and their one world order FACT. You should only be doing business with the only American company we have left."

There obvious actions to take this company into the ground is a slap in the face to there investors, they need to take responsibility for there investors, but it looks like there only responsibility is to them selfs!

Great inflation hedge and equity bond. T and CVS are both undervalued and will outperform in 2021 I believe. (and this from someone who has been overweight tech for 10+ yrs!). Sadly believe that the big tech names will drift sideways from here until the business catches up with their valuations (or there is a reset).....
stocks going down tomorrow on the news
"Unless you plan to sell stop worrying about the share price. I look at T as high yield, safe bond. I am neutral on the price, no idea where it goes but feel the dividend is secure and that is allthat matters to me. Of course at 74 my views are different than some of you youngster looking to make fat cap gains. Good luck to us all."

A year ago AT&T put its share buy back plans on hold because of all the unknowns around the growing virus.The Market punished the company for making responsible choices which protected the shareholders dividend payouts.Now that it is known that the decision was sound will the market allow the stock price to return to the more reasonable levels for a well managed company with a 7% dividend?.

While seeing the stock's recent performance- and it is not what any of us would like for our portfolios- looking at where they should be long term- and comparing them to their competitors- I remain hopeful that this diversification will reward us all for our patience- while we collect our steady dividends.This is not GE- like some would wish for us to believe. ."
Question T already took a 15 billion dollar loss for Direct TV and now it's only worth 16.25 billion so how big is the write off T still needs to take this next Q 17 billions?
Low volume day and still couldn’t push up...
US gov't ATF reported that ammo sales were up 32% during 1st week in Jan.; also moonshine sales slumped 61% since the cracker riot on the Capitol.
NFLX numbers bode well for HBO streaming subscribers.
T is building a nice base to blast off. If they low balled there estimates shorts are going to get squeezed big time
"Yup, we're closed Monday which is Martin Luther Day. The next day closed will be February 15 for Washington's Birthday."
For the last 12 months we’re told this stock will plummet and the 7% dividend is unstable. The market has a sell off due to bond yield concerns and the stock rises. Lol. Seems like the divy is plenty safe for those seeking safety.
"Dear Anonymous S.L.: Mr Clean said T could reach $70 by Tuesday. Are you going to engage him/her and try to decipher what they may know that you could then apply to your investing strategy? After all, that's what this board is for, right? You said so."
Back to $29.00
"So, I've been reading lots of posts on Reddit and Stocktwits about Robinhood users about to buy $T stock using margin @ 5% interest to capitalize on the 6.7% yield $T offers. (So basically netting 1.7% interest on FREE money). I did my homework and honestly it seems like a solid plan with the $T dividend being safe, a product that works in any economy, paying off debt faster than anticipated (Thanks Fed... 0% interest) and the #$%$ CEO retiring at the end of June. There doesn't seem to be a lot of risk...all I can think of is NOT maxing out your margin limit in the rare event the market droosnso much that Robinhood exercises their right to sell your stocks to recoup their money (leaving you with a loss). Anyone else doing this? What's preventing everyone from doing it?"
"What in the world??!?! I mean, s&p is virtually flat, T is down almost 2%. Yield is up to 7.1%. So is this a reaction to int rates moving up? Because if it is, where was the upward movement in the stock when int rates plunged to zero over the last effin ten years. It's like there is an 800 lb. fatso sitting on this stock."
"This post is worth millions of dollars to this $T board if you believe me. If not that is ok . Read on. Institutions are gaming this stock. I encourage you to average down and buy more $T ... I have some very good information on why $T can not go below $25.83 for the near future. Buying will occur gradually and shoots this back up to over $30. if you notice on recent charts the bounces from this zone $26 . $T is forced to buy its own shares around this point as well as MM players. I discovered this analyzing a much bigger investors records (close family member), that got preferred shares at $25 with a 5% div. if the stock price settles under $25.83 with massive dividend well over 5% then there is a big problem for issuers of $T in the corporate debt market. Att won’t cut dividend or reduce credit worthiness. It’s better to buy up shares and for MM to manipulate upward pressure. At some point they will go in massively up to high 29.xx then all of a sudden it will explode over $32. This will most likely occur end of year into 2022.I had done some similar analysis on XOM and made mint. Don’t be afraid long term att isn’t going anywhere and just a few sparks and MM moves will make it pop... ofcourse after they get a bunch of cheap shares and make some option calls..."
AT&T announces multi-year alliance with IBM on CNBC minutes ago.
"I always liked T. I bought it again at 28+ prior to the Ex date.It's no Tesla but it's a return, etc.. You can actually buy and sell this once or twice a year and do ok. - Pete"
there ya go OPEX bringing PPS back down to $30 level. THe mm's/banks and funds aren't going to let this close much higher.
TMobile is down over $8.00 bucks. No idea what is going on with that stock. Might have something to do with AT&T winning the postpaid subscriber war.
"Gee, $29 even on options expiration. Pure stock manipulation."
Anyone not get the dividend yet? I have had my shares long before the x dividend date
This was at $39 bucks it will easily get there anytime on any positive news
"China is allowing WHO investigators a year later after scrubbing and cleaning up everything. Everyone has their stories fixed.Of course the virus did not emanate from the wu-han lab carrying out covid research next door, it came from a bat cave 1000's of miles away.NICE TALE."
"want to start picking up Silver or Gold on dips , Joe the DEM wit without a brain makes even Jimmy Carter look like a smart man. We are going to have massive inflation coming that the DEM wits can not control. With the DEBT as big as it is. Get ready for anything that you would drop on you foot and it hurts to go way up in price."
"CNN... why are you and CBS and other “news” outlets not reporting the fact that a Cuomo aide admitting they purposely hid nursing home death data in order to avoid a federal investigation??? You aren’t a news organization, you are a unscrupulous lying stooge of the Democratic Party withholding the truth from the US public..."
"If CNN goes, this is a $40.00 stock."
It's amazing how fast sellers turn into buyers.
"Other than the CEO, all 12 of the ""BORED"" members have no knowledge of the telecommunications business.Why was Randall given a blank check?"
"I'm sure the current T baggers know how to trade this stock, especially this time of year........buy today and reap a 2%+/- return in a week......it's a no-brainer......T pps has been in the $25-$45 range for the last 25 years........it has a great dividend........trade it!"
Omg why AT&T EPS is negative for 2020? 
"Whats funny about the Dems stimulus bill, is that they are reducing child poverty now and increasing the burden for children when they grow up. Millenials and Gen z will have to pay for this."
4% pop..
"Just bought 400 shares of T at 32.92. Plan to hold for 10 year minimum. True book value of this company is $47 a share, and one day, they will get back on a steady increase. These prices are a gift. Until then, great stock to reinvest dividends."
Headed back to the $40s near term. :-)
The smart move would be to take the 7.5 billion and buy shares of T because you would save over 7% on the dividend pay out. If you pay off debt it's at 1/2 the interest rate and the lower shares will pay you back with higher earnings that can be used to pay off debt. Catch 22
"Memo to ATT: You have shareholders here, not political activists.You have a thing called fiduciary duty and responsibility to make decisions to increase shareholder value.You are neglecting your role as managers and executives.

One of the most stable stocks from last week.
HBO Max is #1Top Free Apps in Ranking
"more bad news for T: ""Disney’s global subscriber number stands at 87 million, while HBO Max — available only in the U.S. — has 12.6 million accounts activated, as per Bloomberg."""
"$T warner bros and HBO MAX are now extending their harry potter and game of thrones universe and rumored to be doing a TV show from the Godzilla world, hbo max is late but is now starting to show who rules the world"

T is getting good volume. Finally should be going up soon.
"Need some suggestions on an investment that pays a dividend of 4% or more. I'm retired, 70 y.o. & already own several like t (largest holding), pfe, vz, vlo, xom, abbv, gild, gis, wmb, nee, stag, stor.. I'm well diversified, just need one more long term, relatively high return investment."
Wall Street is forward looking. The guidance was disappointing. Last quarter is ancient history. Looks like another long 3 months of little or no share price growth.
"I just changed my mobile service from Verizon to Spectrum. They both have unlimited talk and text but I was overpaying Verizon for Data storage that I did not need. I was paying Verizon $120 per month and I'll be paying $14 per month at Spectrum. It was my fault for overpaying Verizon because I didn't need all that capacity but I'm changing anyway because the lowest monthly fee at Verizon is $45 per Mo. and the lowest fee at Spectrum is $14. I'll be paying $14 per month for unlimited talk and text. You can receive, send or store all the Data you want for free with either service if you're using WIFI but you have to pay when you're not."
$31. Holds! That's a good sign!
"Yield curve inversion -- yada yada yada. Over-hyped issue, chill. This inversion started back in March, why all the attention now when the alleged recession doesn't occur for some 18 to 24 months after the event? Govt. stats say no inflation in sight as far as anyone can see, NEC director Larry Kudlow points this out in virtually every interview he's done over the past year. Experts like to quote the history of these inversions ""over the past 50 years"" and how they foreshadowed significant recessions. One problem: this only happened on just SIX occasions over the past 50 years -- ALL OF WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE 1989. To me, this raises about the statistical accuracy when all your data points are skewed towards one end of the chart.Why has this been happening since 1989, why not during the recessions of the 60's & 70's? I can answer that in two words: ALAN GREENSPAN. He chaired the Federal Reserve from 1987 through 2006. He was followed by Ben Bernanke 2006 - 20014 (Remember ""helicopter"" Ben?). Both were notorious for manipulating interest rates and so-called ""quantitative easy"" [i.e., throwing money at banks]. The primary culprit of these inversions has ALWAYS been the Federal Reserve.These inversions happen here in the U.S. largely because of the Fed's incessant need to tinker with interest rates."
"Just because I am doing well with the AT&T, Doesn't mean that I don't care about other people and their hard Earned Money that they invest in this company, I do agree that there is really something wrong with the people that are running this company that is for sure."
SEC fine would be $300Billon i think i heard somebody say ... that would basically Bankrupt $T
T is a utility says the stock price. Mgmt has yet to transform it.
Looking at making my first investment into T.
AT&T get rid of those executives and all the dead wood management layers. Some more vision and drop the boomers in your organisation. Then maybe this stock will give some decent return.
How many ATT shorts are TROLLing this board? Like for confirmation.
The times are changing years ago if Morgan Stanley recommended a stock it would be up points it seems somebody knew information was coming Friday somebody always knows when news is coming. This is great news for telephone holders there are sellers Who Rather invest in faster growing companies which is wonderful news because today’s buyers will be holders for a while and new institutional buyers will be holders for years to come putting less pressure on the stock in the future those who wait will be rewarded

Leftist Phil very busy pumping his money pit investment $T.
"For the last 20 years hopeful investors have been posting every reason in the world why T was going to move to $40 but it hasn't happened. T was a $30 twenty years ago and except for a few occasions like last year when the Elliot group bought a chunk of shares, T has been and still is a $30 stock. Why do you suppose that is? All the talk about if T had so and so's multiple or if T was Disney or Netflix, yada yada, T would be this or that, but it's NOT. T is T and the fact is that the market doesn't see T as a growth stock like it does the other companies on the list. T is a dividend stock and that's it. My guess is that it's going to be a $30 stock for as long as T stays in business. It may have a few gyrations here and there taking it up to the mid to high thirties but it will always come back down and settle around $30 because it's not a growth stock. Just my opinion."
It's got to be CNN weighing this down! Lol!
Ive never heard so many lies coming from ceo - wow where do they get these guys
Upgrade coming next week!
Sold my t options at a nice profit today at open switched it to pltr calls
"This board is hilarious. When T has a good day the cheerleaders pour out of the woodwork and we hear calls of $37, $39 and $49 again. But when T has a bad day, the weenies show up and start crying, $25, $20 and $15. It's so predictable and happens every time. The same thing happened the last 3 times T was at this price............on 2/17, 1/26 and 1/7. The only thing I haven't seen today (I probably missed it) is ""Somebody knows something"". LOL LOL I love this board!!"
7 shares got paid $3.12 not bad.
Dividend going to 10%
Price gapped down Thursday night with the market. Opened lower with little conviction in selling. Afternoon buying picked up and moved the price higher. Low volume during the morning hours with a cheaper price is a good sign. Potential catalysts for share appreciation coming our way!
Anyone concerned about its relationship with China?

"@Spartan55 The change is taking place and you can see it in the stocks actions , VZ will be going lower and T will be going higher , The price action is telling you the switch is taking place T to the $50's and VZ to the $20's , Told you it was coming you can sell VZ once it's down 50% when Cramer tells you to. and buy T once it's up 50% when Cramer tells you to, because it's all up to you it's your hard earned money , But for sure Get ready to say OH NO up T goes and OH NO down VZ goes ."
"If HBO Max attracts new subscriptions in the 10s of millions, through their marketing strategy of direct to consumer movies for free, T can easily see its stock price rise. Look at the evaluation of all these streaming companies. Disney with 45 percent of their business making nothing is at all times highs just because of Disney + which isn't profitable. T is making money and pays a monster dividend that can with stand a global pandemic. The upside is the streaming business. Their content is excellent especially for Adults. Their library is extensive and it's a matter of marketing and time before this goes higher. In this market it's not far fetched this can't go much higher"
At what point do they let this run?

I added 500 shares today as I continue to build my position. I'm very confident that the dividend will be increased to $2.12 and will be declared in mid December.
"I find it interesting that so many reputable analysts got T wrong. The Wall St Journal put a price target of $33.62 in June of 2020 and The Bank of America also had a buy rating with a $36.00 price target Aug. of 2020. Two years earlier when Warren Buffett was touting T (one of his crony friends joined the board) he said the stock would go to 60. This whole stock market is a guessing game and no one really knows what the future holds. If Wed. has decent earnings or even meets the target instead of beating there is hope of an increase in PPS. If it misses, this will take years."
"09:42 AM EDT, 06/26/2019 (MT Newswires) -- AT&T (T) was maintained with a buy rating and $43 price target at Nomura/Instinet as the firm believes ""the FirstNet/5GE deployment is currently lifting net adds from the first responder community.""Additionally, Nomura writes that the ""worst has likely passed for entertainment EBITDA, and FCF/asset sales should improve leverage in 2019.""AT&T has an average analyst rating of buy and $36 price target.Price: 32.68, Change: +0.13, Percent Change: +0.41"

Next week T should go up to $30 for Divvy. Ex-div day Jan 8th.
"When was the last time we seen AT&T up $1.13 ? This is hard to believe, But hope for the best for the stock."
"Investors Business Daily did a hit job on T yesterday. Excerpt-“AT&T stock should not be bought right now based on its fundamentals and technical analysis. Investors want to prioritize stocks that have seen growth of at least 25% in earnings and sales in recent quarters. T stock currently falls far below that.Despite its nearly 7% dividend yield, AT&T stock has dropped well over 20% in 2020 as the company's increasing debt has deterred many investors. Shares have a long way to go before reaching the nearest buy point.”"
"People. ATT (and Verizon BTW) desperately need spectrum for the 5g rollout. T has the least flexibility of all bidders. Saddled with debt incurred in two disastrous acquisitions, it lacks the financial flexibility to compete at the auctions. but lack of spectrum is an existential threat to T. The prices for bandwidth in the current auction are already astronomical. Where can T get the money? They are already over leveraged and the media delivery/content assets they purchased are worth about 25 cents on the dollar. They are coming for your dividend. You heard it here first. Don't hate the messenger. My family and I have about 80k of T stock in our holdings. But you really have to ask yourself why would they pay 7% in a 2 percent world? No spectrum-no ATT. What will T trade at if the cut the dividend in half or worse yet suspend it? 15 bucks if they halve it. 10 if they suspend it."
i am 62 and t is my retirement lifeboat.
So the minor stake puts the value of DTV at $15b. The sale is not for $15b. I see many people not understanding this. It’s like shark tank. I offer 1.5b for 10% then the company is worth 15b according to my offer.
DIV EX date coming soon buy now to be sure
"if it doesnt go up dont worry we got a dividend. wth is wrong with T investors. The total return is negative, its not a bond, its a bum stock."
Pure 
the ONLY thing T is good for is the divvy....the ONLY THING
"lol, they waited 6 years for the lawsuit, and did it the night before an ER. The powers that be love to hold this stock down, because they want cheap shares.T as always is bullish in a neutral sense."
JUST CURIOUS. What price does everyone need to be in the green?
"Look at that all that work by the T haters today and they are losing money as T is up and green , LOL,LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up LOL,LOL,LOL"
Volumes are increasing.I'm looking to add if price is around 28.50; target selling price is 37.00 USD.If price goes below 27.00 somehow I'm adding a larger position.

We live in times where having 0 news about a stock (GME) is better than having good news about a stock (T).

$T giveth and taketh away.......
How does someone like Randal Stephenson get to be CEO for so long? Here’s his track record after taking over in 2007. 1. Failed to merge with T-Mobile in 2011. Paid a break up penalty of $5 billion which revived the fortunes of T-Mobile and resulted in its taking over ATT in subscribers2. Bought Direct TV for $49 billion at a time in 2014 when the transition to OTT networks had just started and has been losing customers every quarter since then. 3. Bought Time Warner and has all of 25 million subscribers compared to Disney + of 100 million subscribers. Not in the same league as Netflix. 4. Sold Hulu to raise money I hope John Starkey is better.
"According to some on this board, T is a defensive stock. LMAO"

Anyone getting nervous out there? What will the market do if the Democrats win both seats? How about if the Republicans win both seats? What if the seats are split? All kinds of possibilities.
What should I do? I sold 1500 shares of T at 29.20 and put it in SPY @ 338. Should I take the gain (short term tax gain) and go back to T? I am worried about how low T might go should the market correct a couple thousand points.
So is T going to keep the aristocrat status?I think the dividend is the single most important factor in this stock.
Dive dive dive
"Stay nimble and open to new ideas folks. This is an amazing market, but dangnabit you gotta be fast "

"Att wants to keep customers in high prices plan????? Their Att now ak Directv now is going to rise prices another 10.00 this will drive a wedge between the customs and they will bail, I know I did. As far a high prices cell phone plans TMUS will scoop them up in no time. TMUS offers the best military and first responders discounts than all the carriers plus free Netflix and free stuff every week (no taxes they are included). As far as getting fiber internet good luck with that #$%$ a lot of folks are more interested in when Starlink will be come available this should create a lot of competition, I read some were that he is even looking at adding Sat phone to the Starlink network and take on the cell industries."

Afternoon T ~ dish is moving higher folks much higher
still waiting for Joe to talk about showerheads.
Direct TV is Randall Stephenson's responsibility.It's a ball and chain tied around every stockholder's neck.Why is he still around?
You hold T for dividend and will tolerate some degree of market loss. Can't beat a 7+% yield in today's environment.
I?ve learned a company?s with a history of vocal management in support of investors and price appreciation is just as valuable as its balance sheet. Markets are momentum and sentiment based. $t (lower case is intentional) doesn?t give a rats #$%$ about the stock price. I won?t ever make a blue chip a big position in my portfolio ever again If it?s board behaves anything like att and is generally viewed in pop culture as uncool or stagnant
"HBOMax not giving share price much of a bump since many of the subscribers are getting on for free. ATT using a page from Phillip Morris, get em hooked and they'll come back for life. Looking forward to the worldwide launch to see if that will get share price moving."
When does T usually raise dividend. I’m expecting another 1cent raise.
Question is how much the leak will cost them with the SEC now
"it has been all gloom and doom for a good reason and for a long time. Now they take the write-off, T has no place to go but UP.still a cash cow!"
"T's monster new unlimited cell plans with FREE HBO MAX are taking customers away from bot T Mobile and VZ in droves LOL,LOL T will be going a lot higher , Just pick up shares on the dips before the shorts can cover and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start I am sure we will have to raise the price at some point or any higher price you want for your shares. Then sit back and collect the dividends as T's stock goes higher and higher LOL,LOL Man T's future has not been this bright for decades. T's to the moon Alice"
Here we go again. Another down day for T.Management changes needed now.
HBOSomeone will come up with an idea for live streaming.It will be a home run with minimum expense.I remember when there was a show that just showed a family's activity live and was very popular for a while. Imagine nobody hasn't done it during this pandemic?Mark my words!
I understand why a stock goes down when that stock is ex-dividend. But why is a dividend so meaningful if the stock goes down that exact amount the same day? Maybe T would be trading at 200 if it did not have to pay a dividend for the past 10 years. Is there anyone who can explain this to me. Maybe it’s a tax thing? Thanks.
$26 and change after earnings.

I've been a long time T shareholder and accumulator who has never seen the level and frequency of guidance they've been offering since Elliot came into the picture.I have to feel that these guys are serious about getting the price up to $60/share.
Any idea what is driving this higher? Treasury yields? Glad I added more last week
Looking backward at these price swings it appears that there is some big accumulation going on.Everytime it starts to bounce off 30 they bring it back down so it can not break out and get away from them.Two months from now we will see who has been building these large positions
Was watching the NBA on TNT (owned by AT&T) last night and there were impressive ads on there (free to AT&T) for HBO Max. So much exciting content and films on the way. Made me glad to be a shareholder.
Another time Warner Debt laden acquisition.....Just because a CEO wears a suit does not mean he is smart. T management never learn that acquiring debt is NOT a good thing.

Honestly I never would have dreamed this would be down in an up market with ex-div tomorrow. Especially the way it's been running the last few days. Maybe they will come to their senses later today.

Guys are acting like we didn’t know they would need to take more debt to get what they need.
30 tomorrow. 40 next week.

Watch and learn DEM wits without a Brain.

Took the smartest people in the room to build a REAL MONSTER and keep paying the dividend shareholders depend on as they completely transform T into the MONSTER it can be. FACT"

Maybe granny was right when this hole tech bubbly burst I should own T and gold

"Spartan55 you just need to learn you are a DEM wit without a brain and about to lose all your money in VZ as VZ keeps going lower and lower Why ? easy VZ just keeps losing more and more customers to T everyday. VZ has no future and can not compete in the new 5G world they now face FACT LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
VZ not moving either. Just been a bad week for telecoms. Thought Netflix mentioning T and DIS as their main competition would have sent this higher today.
"If Stankey can find someone dumb enough to buy it....

HBO sub projections..If all goes well.... when the heck does that ever happen? For ATT?
AT&T will go NOWHERE now that Stankey flat said that there will be no Dividend growth. That's why most people hold T.
Does t own hbo. If so it's their most valuable asset by far
"If this is true, it's going to take a long long time, if ever, for HBO Max to move the needle in a meaningful way._____LightShed Partners did a study that 83% of streaming viewership is tied up in five services — Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, YouTube, Hulu and Disney Plus — and everybody else has to fight for the remainder."

"Nice article from Raymond James with a buy rating on T and a price target of 32. Same target as others but I have a friend who owns a well known drug stock that is down 20 bucks a share. She does not care because she gets $8.000 a year in dividends. She has owned it for years and it split once so she is still about even on her principal. No worries, this stock will eventually gain back some as well at T if they hold that dividend of 7%.. F crashed because they took the dividend away and most retired owners of the stock want some kind of income that is over 1%."
lets go to 30 today!
Look at that 5 year chart LOL Man this is the worse investment in a record bull market. Hopefully for the sake of the company they cut the div to nothing and get this garbage back on track. So sorry to all the longs who have missed out on the best market they will ever see :(

My now is the moment that T is gonna pas 30. I mean this YEAR HAHAHAHHA
Let's all post a political message and drive Vagipuss nuts. LOL LOLFunny why he never takes Phil to task. Phil posts more political messages than anyone else on this board.
"@TEX, @John. Brick, NJ, @R the trading at or near the end of the day is very interesting (options-wise). It seems to be repeatable  what do you guys think?"
"You whiners always complain about AT&T never going up, never growing. TMobile and Verizon are basically trading right around the same price they were at the end of July 2020. That's about 7 months. TMobile doesn't pay a dividend and Verizon's is less than AT&T by about 3%."

"Now that I think of it, CNN ""IS"" a reflection of management's culture. The rest of us have to live with it."

"After a stock goes X dividend, the price of the stock will decline by the amount of the dividend. That's almost a given. What happens after that is a reflection of market conditions at that time. In the case of T, price usually goes further down, to the $28 level or so, before leveling off. Eventually, it will make a run to about 30-dollar area again before retreating once more. T is considered dead money to many investors, but that’s because they don’t know how to trade the stock. If you are here to make a quick buck, then sticking around for the dividend was the wrong more. The right move would have been to buy into T several weeks before the X dividend date, take advantage of the ride up, and sold before that date. If you bought in for the dividend, then wait for the price to go back up to your entry point before selling. You might have to wait a bit and watch your investment decline to uncomfortable levels, but T’s price will eventually go back up as long as you got in under $30. Depending on market conditions, wait a week or two and you should be able to recover your investment along with the dividend. It’s not a guarantee, but so far it has worked for me. Also, T is in a long-term decline. Unless things turn around, try to get into T below $30 for the next dividend payment."
Is dividene $2 per share? That seems to high or is it $2 per quarter???? Pays four dividends?
Up by a penny.
"There is the T we all know and love, always red."
"If I am being honest, I must say, everyone saying they are adding a few thousand shares or currently hold 10 thousand shares or more is not impressing anyone. Maybe you are telling the truth. However, if you have that much money considering 1000 shares would cost $32,000 and taking into account that you would hopefully have other holdings, I seriously doubt people that can afford that would waste their time on a yahoo finance message board. I am young, and have everything I have saved up for the past 6 years invested in the market. AT&T is 31% of my portfolio at 465 shares. I make decent money and have bills like everyone else. It's funny to see people saying they are adding a few k shares here like its nothing. Maybe its not, 90% of people with that kind of money would not waste their time here. Those people know exactly what they are doing and don't need to brag or convince people on a message board to buy. Be real people. Some of you may be legit, but I'm calling the rest out. Besides people bragging about having a lot of money and buying a few k shares like its nothing, I do agree with their reason as to why. Their is a lot of upside here, not just in share price but dividend increase as well. T is a cash cow and they could clear and debt off their books within three years if they wanted too. I'm in It for the long hall."
At&t has a 25% lose in stock price and a 7 % div. That is Good? U smart people tell me what u think.

No one read WSJ? T sold Government solutions unit for an undisclosed price.
Looks like they almost doubled there HBO max subscriptions.
"Why did Warren Buffett invest in Verizon and not in AT&T?From a value point T provides much more value than VZ, e.g., Forward P/E is 8.68 vs. 10.69, Price/Sales is 1.17 vs. 1.79, Revenue is 171.76B vs. 128.29B, Free Cash Flow is 36.36B vs. 16.063B. Both of them have high debt, 182.98B vs. 151.24B. However, I believe T's debt is more manageable due to its higher FCF.The only reason I can find that Buffett still prefers VZ is he believes their management is superior to AT&T.You are welcome to share your thoughts."
"How are you at&t share holders liking higher gas prices. Higer taxs, power bill, food prices around the corner. 7 % div may keep off food stamps."
Anyone watch the series Titans on Max yet? Just finish. Not what I expected but turned out to be pretty good show.
"To Yhoo, if you are even remotely objective, you need to put back up my post on the $15 an hour minimum wage."
Why the T is so cheap? Because of the high debt level? Is dividend really more than 7%. That's really a good deal.
Just added to my position. Buying Opportunity!

"T's 5G monster is ALIVE and starting grow LOL,LOL,LOL Say up we go"
This stock hates $30 never seen such a resistance lol
Tranny Phil’s T investments.
AT&T is lagging because of the uncertainty surrounding additional debt needed to be taken on for 5G.Gonna be awhile before any meaningful valuation increase. Wait a bit for the pending sell-off as T announces the additional debt it is taking on. Buy more when the dust settles.
When T suspends the dividend and the boomers sell the millennials will buy the dip for the HBO hyper growth. Netflix is nothing more than a hosting company and the only real players with premium content are DIS and HBO. Thank you!!

I went to college and I went to law school. I'm not a financial advisor just a small investor etc..But why would financial experts buy Direct TV at such a high price ? Aren't they supposed to know all aspects/pitfalls ? Is it true they'll take a huge loss ?
"Remember to place long term sell orders for all your shares of T over $60 is a good place to start but any higher price you want will work , It sends a message to the short sellers they are not going to get your shares to cover with and if by chance any of your shares have been shorted you broker will need to find other or have them recalled . Just place them long term sell orders and set back and collect the dividend , The more shares that have long term sell orders the higher T will go"
you won't go wrong buy T at this price. buy today sell.in a week at 30.
"Good year ahead!!! Or ???The best risk adjusted trade IOM...if you are a dividend income investor and and an option trader is,...sell the Jan 2022 $28 put for $3. That equals a 10%+ yield, “IF” T stays above $28 Jan 2022. I know, if you don’t trade or trust opinion trading you won’t get it. Just buy the stock and BE HAPPY. It’s all good.I’ve Been doing this for 30 years  and I’m getting way more cautious now. This is a cautious conservative trade."
Can we just hold a stock right here so it closes at a higher the day because everybody knows what happens it opens up and runs up a quarter than it closes down a penny or two.
Do you think T will break 29$ again?
"@R’s strategy makes use of out-of-the money call options on a stock to force market makers (who make a market in that stock) to buy large amounts of to hedge their exposure. @R’s strategy just adds to the buying pressure. Now you have sell orders that can’t be used because the price is too high (unless the price happens to go that high ). On the other hand, if there are “weak hands” out there, that lessens the buying pressure - short term holders normally use sell stops to protect their small profits. Once a sell stop order is tripped, it turns into a market order and you know the rest - timber!!"
Tomorrow we go UP UP UP folks! Stay in T and hold your shares

Lou Dobbs fired from fox for not telling the truth isn’t that a surprise .

Probably end up in the +40 cent range. Always takes a dive at the wire.
"Hello T investors, I can't help but be constantly amused by like dislike views of motley and Seeking alpha gurus.. The bottom line for me is I'll collect my 7+ dividend and sleep well at night. I do believe that current management will reduce debt and push 5g and the media portion of T, which will cause the stock price way above the nay sayer analyst predictions. What say you ?"

I hate it when earnings are reported before the open. If VZ fell 3% on mediocre earnings I hate to see the possibility of T just meeting or lower revenue.

"Come on man. You will pay higher taxes, gas, electric bills, food bill but u will get your grass cut cheap, cheap, cheap. Thanks to me and CNN. If at&t can keep paying div with no profits, frogs can hop without bumping rear end."
T is a nice stock to remind you that non performing stocks exist. Rubbish management.

At least with AT&T you can be pretty certain each day will be a down one. Not much guessing here.

"The future of streaming is going to be free with ads and in-app purchasing of new content. AT&T would be smart to be the first to go that route. HBO subs numbers would instantly soar. Advertising revenue and purchases for viewing new content would surpass they’re already to high $15/mo. Also no cancellations of HBO. If it’s free it will always be on their device. Time to be an industry leader, ahead of trend, rather than behind. All other streamers would quickly scramble to match. It’s coming anyway. T does have unique opportunities no other data provider will have. ADVERTISING REVENUE."
"You people and analysts seem to forget why AT&T tried to diversify in the first place. The wireless market is saturated. Meaning there isn't any new customers it's just 3 companies competing to lure customers from each other. A zero sum game. That's when they bought DirecTV and TimeWarner. You want to go back to that? I don't. And you also seem to forget that we're in the midst of a worldwide pandemic. There is no telecom I would rather own than AT&T. And we're already seeing the affects of owning Time Warner with postpaid subscriber results that AT&T hasn't seen for decades. HBO Max is the bait. And take a guess where those subscriptions are coming from? That's right, VZ and TMobile."
Value stocks in play today.
Anyone have any info on the exclusive talks with TPG mentioned on January 24th? It’s been almost a month no word from either side.
Why do I feel T won’t hold above 30 by closing bell. It would be nice to stay in the thirty’s even the low thirty’s now.

"You that like to trade for pennies you just might want to learn a little about long term capital gains , does not matter if you trade in a 401k or IRA you pay no taxes until you take it out , but with the DEM wits going to raise taxes you are going to want to know all you can about long term capital gains. The difference can be paying no taxes on $80,000 or paying 37% or more on $80,000 , you will need to plan ahead to take advantage of long term capital gains or not all up to you . The major key is you must hold the stock for one year before the gain becomes long term capital gains ."

"Just a little comforting words- to all T ""investors""- not traders.....from a ""little known investor- Sir Warren Buffet"":""Instead of frequently checking a stock's price, you'd look to the earnings and dividends over the years as determining whether you made a good investment or not. And that's what people should do with stocks.""Probably some of the best advice out there. Their earnings and dividend increases have gone up consistently. As long as the company is sound, and making money, quarter over quarter- let the market do what it does- this should be back in the 40's after the DOJ goes down with a knockout- and T's aggressive acquisitions into expanding their business- and not sitting back- relying on phone service, like other carriers, should propel this much higher - while we collect a solid dividend that is 2X current treasury rates. I will admit- I watch the stock too closely- and it does drive me crazy when it is not participating in recent market runs- butI often have to remind myself that traders trade on any bit of news......and in this case- it's not because the company is losing money.....on the contrary. Brace for a rough open- let it wash out- and remember the company is doing just fine."
I have to ask?Just how many layers of management does this company actually have?And this a communication company?

As much as I love HBO MAX that can’t be the reason I hold this company. Way over leveraged & I’m expecting it to continue trading flat. Trimming my position to add NFLX. Never too late to buy an industry leader with a first mover advantage.

"“It's worth noting the spinoff will include the entirety of AT&T's U.S. pay-TV portfolio: DIRECTV, U-Verse, and AT&T TV.”The free cash flow generated by these entities I believe is significant and will now be captured within the new company formed to receive the “spinoff” of these businesses. Therefore the current dividend of T will be a much larger percentage of its remaining free cash flow. I would like nothing better than somebody to show me where I’m wrong on this, But most of the boobs here wouldn’t understand this and will just give me all thumbs down on it."
"T taking more and more customers from VZ now everyday LOL,LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up when actions speak volumes LOL,LOL"
"Wouldn't it have been nice if management had not over spent and created enormous debt. Then they could have supported the stock price. Now instead any gain is easily sold without fear of any kind of potential stock buyback, or any significant buy interest due to that enormous debt hanging over our heads."
"Why can't the Reddit kids starting buying this stock? LOL Cmon, it's cheap kids, you can get a lot of shares."
0% interest rates forever. I am still waiting for negative rates on my mortgage.
No love for this stock... Dividend is secure yet here we languish below 30.
"Question for you all When the stimulus does not pass are you going to hold strong or are you all selling . The stimulus is not going to pass the first time around , Just the way it works or how soon do people forget"
"Get ready for the HBO stimulus to the MAX LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL and all the T haters are going to have to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
Going to get a good earnings Report!
AT&T owns CNN. Foreigners own FOX. take ur pick.#USA!
"$25 or lower around Q1 earnings is confirmed, Very Bearish outlook ahead for T=Trash."
"Still time to get into MO. MUCH better stock than T.Dividend KING, 54 dividend raises in 51 years.They are tied down with constant CAP-ex.They are moving smoker, who want to, to heated tobacco that has up to 95% less carcinogens.They pay out 80% of earnings as dividends, intentionally, to keep lawyers away. They are predicting earnings of $ 4.67 this year which would mean a HUGE dividend increase in July.Just broke a 4 year downtrend in the stock price yet still Yields 6.8%.'T investors are crazy not to have already swapped out T for MO."
LeWoke James: I’m oppressed Also LeWoke James: I’m worth $1 billion.
"I feel nausea.The rest of the market is showing red (dark red) and T is green......This isn't right, is it?"
over 1pc lower in PM.Has T suspended stock buyback?
THIS IS A HYPEI DONT BELIEVE T THAT SUBSCRIBERS INCREASE. EVEN MYself cancelled my contract with ATT AND DIRECT TV LAST WEEK.
Where are the buyers of BustTv?
Surprised the stock didn't rise because when the merger went through the stock fell!
"As expected , zero coverage on serial killer Coumo’s crimes."
It will be refreshing not having 45 around. The fraud is gone and T can now prove itself.
All 5 G Companies Are Going To Be Hot Hot Hot This Year! Hold On Baby;)
"Now the question is will current shareholders get shares in this spinoff, since att still owns 70%"
"Top 5 largest revenue FY 2018. Company share price/Revenue/PE ratio1) AAPL $175/$262B/14.442) BRK-A $304860/$248B/124.633) AMZN $1672/$233B/83.014) T $31/$171B/10.825) GOOGL $1149/$137B/26.28With T's integration, restructuring & workforce streamlining are complete, FCF increasing and debt is decreasing, stock price should rise."
"The true fact is you now get HBO MAX for FREE with your new unlimited cell plan from T and it is now gaining new customer in droves from VZ and T mobile , Why because you can save even more money by dropping NFLX , T now has the Amazon business model for Telecom T can give things away or discount item to customers to drive new customers to T, Watch what happens next ,as long as you have a Cell plan from T you will get HBO MAX for free and that is now happening today or HBO is free to you and they sell ads on it . Or you pick what you want for free with you cell plan or it's really heavy discounted so no one company in that business can compete with T. T now has massive upside as they are taking customer from VZ , T mobile and NFLX FACT it is now happening more and more everyday Why because customers can save money switching their cell plans to T , networks are just a Commodities business it's all about what else you can get for FREE or heavy discounted and T has the assets to leverage free and heavy discounted LOL,LOL you don't even need to make this stuff up because it is now already happening today as T takes more and more customers from T mobile and VZ both have a massive problem and it's T's new business model call the 5G monster T has built. Really has nothing to do with 5G other than 5G has unlocked the assets T had to leverage the new business model they have been building for years. Took the smartest people in the room to change T's total business model into an Amazon telecom business model , You could see it coming as they built the 5G monster why still paying the dividend WOW that took guts and brains to pull off such a massive change. T has built a business model that no one company can compete in the new 5 G world T has created. FACT"
The air continues to flutter out of the extremely lofty go-go tech stocks. That money is chasing value stocks. AT&T has to be at the top of list for many. IMHO.
No thought police today? Are they at lunch or get laid off?
"Stock ridiculously undervalued on any metric. Fair value today is $35-$40 based on any metric. $60 once the virus lockdown is over, 5G everywhere, etc"
Voted against every Director who voted for the DTV acquisition and compensation
This is quite the stock!
I don't own T because it's DEAD money. I owned a lot a year ago and let it be called away with $30 and $31 options. BAD STOCK IN A BULL MARKET. T will preform better as the market tops out. Dividend is safe as they know nearly every shareholder is in T for the dividend. The have detracted from a great business with terrible acquisitions . Can they unwind some of them and lower debt without too big a hit to equity? If so T is a good way to make 10% in 12 months.
"I've held T since 2002, bought for the div. and the price has been averaging around $25 all this time. Meanwhile Amazon and others has turned penny herders into millionaires whilst I'm sitting here waiting for my 52cents every 3 month. My question is; How could an entire board of directors consisting of other CEO from other companies not know that DTV was a bad expensive deal."
"No reason why Dish should be doing so much better than DTV, productive great profits that just blew past estimates, same businesses with different management is the difference. Great move by T, get DRT off the books, let someone run it effectively to maximize profits in which T will share, win win all the way around"
Tired of this stock being stuck in the mud. It's worth more. Frustrating.
VZ a real #$%$ company run by the EU one world order under HAN's and about to destroy VZ at all cost to the shareholders as the Yahoo Natzi CENSOR real Americans that will always be FREE . LOL you just can not make this stuff up . VZ going to $20's and T going to the $50's Why because T has a future and VZ does not . FACT
Just bought more!
I think it’s a good play to sell dtv. This gives them money and more time to spend on hbo max since that’s where they’ll get more money in the long run. They’ve made their money on dtv now it’s time for new things.
at the end of the day T move up 28.76 with heavy volume.
I am amazed this undervalued company is trading this low. Fair value is $41.00 and that's being conservative. Some Analysts believe it's going to $55.00...This is completely unbelievable and just amazing.
I have had T a long time looking for dip to buy more great dividends
ARK and BlackRock are looking at AT&T if they buy this will rocket
Next plunge we’re going underrrr!
"7.278 billion shares x $2.04 dividend divided by $26 billion free cash flow = 57% payout ratio. Investor presentation says “High 50s %” dividend payout, meaning no dividend cut, 51 cent dividend should be declared next month."
"What do the green numbers mean for the price of ATT? I haven't seen that color for awhile, it's normally red."
"Wow! I made $38 in 6months on a $ 5,000 investment. Must be CNN! Lol!"
"Next quarter they will raise HBO MAX protections again, from 150 to 190 million subscribers."
Close but no cigar.
Safe stock to invest in at least it doesn’t fly around park your money and sit back it can get to $34 plus on any positive news with 5 and 6G it’s been over that easily before
"I believe that John Stankey, will be on CNBC at 9:15 am EST. If anyone cares. I believe."
"AT&T is a great long investment for any portfolio keeping day trading away since the stock doesn't fluctuate much.something tells me that we are heading to a very large financial depression soon taking down huge profits,hope not but the writing is on the wall."
Huge T news. We'll be at $40 in the short-term.
"Added a 1000 shares at the close, couldn’t pass up the DIV, I think I did the right thing."
T's targeted ad business is a huge money maker. Should come into action later this year.
Is T ever going to hit and stay at 30? I should have put everything into XOM. Maybe this downturn is a message to the Libs?
"Not a good day for me in the markets. Hope you all did better than I. Did make some small change with my puts on Nio, but other than that, today was a bust."
Just sold all my shares in T. Ben a holder of this stock for for a while now and no longer trust any corporations that are owned by big financial institutions.
should we be concerned about the amount of people saying they will drop $T cell services and all of that and will spray the word because they restarted their contributions to the GOP
"All it takes id for T to have to warn earnings will be higher because of all the new customer gains everyday as the take them away from VZ, T mobile and NFLX LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Well, saying goodbye to part of yesterday’s gains. Just wasn’t meant to be...heading back to 28’s ?"
"Spartan55 what you should be asking yourself is how come VZ is down a bigger % than T day after day and that is because the connection between the 2 is now breaking because T is not just in the Commodities business like VZ now is , T has a future and VZ is now in get trouble"
"New to trading. How much dividends does this company pay, per share?"
Maybe T could get Jeff Bezos as CEO. That will shake things up.
"What's the story on HBOMAX live sports?Will it be on a new HBOMAX ""PLATINUM"" ?Will the present HBOMAX be called plain ""Vanilla""?"
"T haters are starting to worry just wait T is going a lot higher , LOL,LOL,LOL"
"There's a right way and a wrong way.My understanding is Telephone is underestimating 72,223, 744 possible customers. Now, why is that?"
"Every 6 months, the Congress should give everyone $1400 stimulus checks to spend. Should cause the economy to boom."
We found out that T now has a very bright future and OH poor VZ does not
No buyer yet for CNN? No surprise. You need to do a lot more house keeping.
"New article criticizes T for not selling DTV and not taking the $15 billion offer. Article believes the longer T waits, the less they will get for the losing DTV. The $15 billion offer was for a 49% ownership, leaving T with a 51% majority ownership."
That runup sure didn't last long!
"Some people can't see a bargain when it's staring them straight in the face. $T is far from being a $GE. $T has over $25B in free cash flow, a shrinking debt and over $175B in shareholder equity paying a 7.5% div. If and when $T hits a P/B of 1.0, I'll be buying 1,000 shares. There is no way $T is going to give up their Dividend Aristocrat status - you can take that to the bank."
"Whelp, name your favorite squeeze play. Mine are RKT and FUBO. GME too nuts for me. Market appears to be rolling over btw. Check out the McClellan and the Cumulative advance decline line"
buy in the $27's sell in the $29's
"What good is T? No total return, flops during market corrections. Don't seem like it does anything good."
Randall's epic blunder will haunt this stock for years.
$30 is that too much to ask?
looks like $T was a pioneer on deciding to put it's 2021 movie slate on hbo max and theaters has hollywood will have to delay more movies
People here commenting how Disney added 21 million and HBO MAX only added 4 million must think the US is the only country and seem to forget Disney is available worldwide and HBO MAX is only available in the US
"The day is not over until after hours trading is done LOL,LOL,LOL Get ready to say OH NO up T goes"
T ~ upgrades or down grades don’t really matter the stock is a mess . Tmus & dish are making progress . T ~ you have an identity crisis need to figure who you really are
"Going to pay T for Free Obama phones and for FREE T internet. LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL Got to love the DEM wits , Next it will pay T for FREE HBO max LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
"r.... ha! just wait till a few. CARAVANS. come. marching in! who do you think will. pay 100,000 a years for support for each of. our. NEW. americans! "
"Look for a small increase in the divy even though last years results do not support it, that what T does."
Did Spartan55 reinvent himself as Gordon Geico?
Happy Friday T ~ buckle up dish fans earnings Monday & news of spectrum 40 next week . T ~ hang on to 28 - 29 for the long term :)
How many HBO MAX adds? That’s the big question? If substantial T starts to turn around.
What a person wants in your portfolio is a stock that has a safe dividend and steadily rises in price year after year. Not T stock!
"4mvp has just been muted, my apologies that I waited so long."
Thanks for the dividend
I complained one timepeople laughed at meI don't complain anymorelife is good
"From Nomura: The levers are in place for ""significant"" free cash flow growth at AT&T, Kvaal writes. However, he believes the company ""must perform against a skeptical Street to drive shares higher."" The analyst thinks Wireless is on track for sustained service revenue growth in 2019 and keeps a Buy rating on AT&T with a $43 price target"""
I’m a long term divy player so don’t jump down my throat when I say “I hope we stay above 30!at close because I’ve seen this movie before”.
I hope I'm wrong but the sale to comcast is the best deal att can make. if not 2026 bankruptcy
People seem excited. Let’s see if we hold over $30 first.
This is one of the best stick to buy and hold in this market climate!!
Got my dividend yesterday!
33$ by May 1st
"Look at all the T haters all crying as T goes higher and higher LOL,LOL,LOL"
Apparently everyone arrested in the capital insurrection have 2nd grade reading levels and think WWE wrestling is real
Quite the stock we have here folks lol.
"Looking back over T’s weekly chart, if you bought for the dividend, you would have to wait 1-6 weeks for price to return to you buy in point. For a trader, that is an eternity to tie up your money. For an investor, that is a walk in the park. No guarantee this trend will continue, but then again, when have we ever had guarantees? S.L."
"ARK investments says that streaming is replacing linear TV programming, so HBO Max should be beneficial. 50 and 200 day moving average are about to cross, which is extremely bullish."
May close negative on the day...
"It's amazing that despite comment after comment to the contrary, so many people still keep expecting T to behave like a go-go stock. You're in the wrong neighborhood."
Watching OAN and News Max real news for real people.
Tranny Phil is ready to participate in the girls sports competition. Go get them buddy.
based on today's nytimes article I would not be surprised to see both democrats win in GA. some polling indicating strong early voting by dems.
$50 stock trading at $30.
ring the dinner bell: the TW deal won’t be stopped
Guess WS seems to like that T is allegedly on the cusp of selling a minority stake in DTV for a higher than 15 billion valuation.At least that's the rumor.
"Bingo, another 5 percent dividend check in the mail."
"Like T a lot add 3000 x29.5993, T is good company I think."
Der t Sanchez MUTED!
I agree ATT will go into streaming; this company is the most underrated company in the stock market; it trades with a PE less than 7.
Increasing your profits is that all you care about? destroying of our democracy does not bother you ?
33 coming??anyone think it can hit there in the next few weeks?
Blue horseshoe loves AT&T
"What sane and rational people call holding responsible parties accountable for their actions, conspiracy theorists call a ""cancel culture"". Pure insanity."
I just rolled my T MAR 26 $29 Puts to the APR 30 $29's for .72 each. That's .20 more than the dividend in one month.
"From that Raymond James analyst:“The investment firm is bullish on the Dallas company's next 12 months despite a large C-band bill.""We believe the situation improves for AT&T over the next 12 months, offering a solid total return story,"" Raymond James analyst Frank Louthan said. ""AT&T is expected to generate ""more than enough free cash flow to cover its upcoming C-Band commitments; 2) keep leverage in check; and 3) maintain the dividend at or above the current level."" C-Band is spectrum to be used for 5G applications.The firm also notes that balance sheet concerns are ""overblown"" since AT&T currently has ""~2.7x leverage, roughly a 1/2 turn above its historical average.""”"
Finally T removes the ball and chains. T has only one way forward. Up.
"Example of reinvested dividends. I put large sum of money into T about 3 Years ago. That money now nets me approximately $32,000/year in dividends. That money reinvested will give me more dividend money next year and so on. Eventually it will get to a point where an investor can retire and collect just the dividend checks without touching the stock shares. This may be on a larger scale than most but the same holds true for anyone who does the same. Compounding dividends is a very powerful way to get an edge in the market. Good luck to all!"
"Remember when Trump suggested ""injection"" of disinfectant to beat coronavirus and ""clean"" the lungs?"
"T up a nickel!Wow, watch the fade...Hate to be negative but this company just doesn’t have a clue.As other companies market caps explode this company just sits."
"It is fading, buying T before 1pm is a good way to lose a dividend in an afternoon, lol."
ByeDon! The world is now a better place. Toilet and showerhead exec orders changed it.
ATT'S CNN draws an effeminate audience.
"Down, down, down. Even for a dividend play the company still needs to do well to maintain a competitive edge. When will the dividend players say enough is enough? $25, $21, $14.95?"
A safe stock with a safer dividend than most. Hopefully they buy back some shares with that 7.8 bil. Market is acting crazy for a minute. I do i own a nice piece of T ITM options 9/2021. I feel safe with Mr T
"I think I have had enough of ""good"" news for a year. Elliott back in, selling DTV, purchasing new spectra.... Any more good news will drop T back into the 26s in two weeks."
no wonder this country is in such a mess. only need to read all the political posts.
Strong 5% move on dish today . My bet another 20 % next week good things in the works
"A matter of time before T cuts the dividend. For 2 reasons. 1. Reduce dividends to lower debt. 2. As the price goes lower, dividend rate goes up. At some point T Mgt will feel that the dividend rate is too high and by cutting it, reduces rate to 5% or so and saves money for T."
AT&T is 100x better than the 10 year T bills. Almighty stability with 7% yield. I renounce AT&T the king of the bonds.
"Just pick up shares of T on the dips and lock them up with long term good until cancelled sell orders over $60 to start or any higher price you want for your shares . then just sit back and collect the dividends as T's new monster takes more and more customers from VZ, T Mobile and NFLX by this time next year T will be going higher and higher , It's a new world T has created that only T can play in because no one company has all the assets to compete in the new world T has created. . FACT"
"Non-Stop falling old school Dino going extinct Next. Year 2000 $60, Year 2008 $40, Year 2021 $20s. What's Next is Crystal Clear."
Not that I want it to happen but it's looking like Cheetah may be back owning T shares!
"Remember T is now the one Cell Company that you can Trust to protect your DATA, Both T Mobile and VZ can NOT be TRUSTED to protect your DATA , T Mobile is a Foreign company founded by the EU and VZ does not even protect your First Amendment rights and even breaks them VZ does not have the right to do that no matter what VZ thinks just like VZ can NOT put up a sign that says for WHITE ONLY NO BLACKS , The FACT is VZ is breaking the laws of the USA by CENSORING what you see, read or post."
How can companies pay 15 an hour when there are fewer jobs than ever. how can people afford a burger when they pay their workers 15 dollars an hour. you know how much they are going to charge for a burger. Make it at home it's much cheaper. We are going lose more jobs then ever. You voted in the wrong people.
"HBO Max, Peacock, Netflix, Prime, Disney, Youtube... Pretty soon people will spend $100 on these + internet.So much for cutting the chord."
"Raymond James put a $32.00 price target on T three days ago. That's not enough to make anyone buy. You can easily make 2 bucks a share trading bio stocks, banks, fuel cells, or solar in just one day. Sure they don't pay dividends but so far that has not paid off well if you owned T for one year. This is the day before ex div and this stock is stalled with some even selling to miss the next payout."
Breakout should be imminent
BOOM ! Hit 30
We are up a nickel in premarket. Will it hold??
"No one wants to touch this stock - CNN is toxic for more than half the country, AT&T is the ""uncool"" brand for any smartphones, HBO is a relic from the 70s. I'd fire the entire Marketing & Communications team, followed by the CEO & Board."
Got The Dividend Yesterday! And Get To Add Some Cheap Shares Today! Sweet;)
Boy look at that BP go. It was $15 3 1/2 months ago and now it's pushing $23. That's a real growth stock and it pays a 5 1/2% dividend besides.
A month ago I said T was a $28-$29 stock. Still is.
Big Baby has left the building. Not even man enough to stay for the Inauguration. Sad. Wimpy. Good riddance.
Green stands for cash. LOL Next week Wednesday we're going to be rolling in dough. I can feel it.
BIG MISSITOLD YA !
Well this has been undervalued very long. Even when numbers are good analysts come back with reasons why it will be bad next time . And the street listens regardless of how well it does. But sooner or later the numbers will be so out of line with the stock price it will make a move. I think we are there now but time will tell.
Yea $30.00 lol
"Gas up 25 cents overnight. Thanks, Joe!"
Talk about manipulation look at Gamestock the last 6 months and todays spike.
What a #$%$ company.
Told you
"Most stocks drop after they report earnings and it doesn't seem to matter whether they're good or bad. Don't be surprised if T does the same. I'm glad it's up because I just want it close close above $28.50 on Friday so even if it drops after the ER, the cushion might be enough to keep it above $28.50. I like where it's at right now!"
"I have gone over the latest report and read many articles of people that have done the same. Bottom line the dividend is rock solid, the wireless business is doing fine, even the wired business in not a total loss. Yes direct TV has issues and yes WB has issues due almost entirely to the shutdown. HBO Max is growing at a slower pace than some of us wanted but I believe by the next Quarter T will have a deal with Amazon and Ruku, or at least be on its way of having a deal. But anyone that says the dividend is in trouble they don't know what a balance sheet. They have zero clue. This week I will reinvest the dividend payment, at these prices is a slamdunk."
glad to see Rush is dead - there is a great equalizer and life is fair
"Road to below $25 Begins, Very Bearish outlook ahead."
Hoping price drops to $28.40
"When everyone said...sell, sell, sell. I bought, bought, bought! Because of this I make over $150 for every penny the stock rises. In other words, it's amazing what reinvesting dividends can do for you. Strong buy and hold long term!"
"OMG, this stock never goes up!"
"did i hear that right? amy klobachar taking credit for breaking up ATT which lead to the use of cell phones?trumpy may have told some whoppers but this is right up there with gore inventing the internet, obama saying your health insurance will go down, and obama bribing the iranians with 1.5 billion in CASH"

"This is from last month but I never saw it on any news feed til today... sorry if it's a re-post (not really)https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2018/09/27/nine-states-support-at-t-in-antitrust-battle.htmlLast year, 11 states joined the federal government’s lawsuit to block the $54 billion merger of Anthem and Cigna. Eight states supported DOJ’s challenge to the $37 billion merger of Aetna and Humana. And 16 states joined the Federal Trade Commission’s opposition to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar’s combination.The Justice Department’s antitrust case seeking to stop AT&T’s $109 billion acquisition of Time Warner, however, has garnered no support from any state attorneys general.In fact, nine state attorneys general – seven Republican and two Democratic – filed an unprecedented amicus brief late Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit declaring their support for the AT&T merger and their opposition to the federal government’s arguments."

There will be more upgrades when the stock buyback program is officially announced! I wonder if some of the sellers like Elloitt are getting back in.
I said at 33 and I'll say again: Patience will pay for long term investors. It always has and it will continue to do so. Long T!!
Low volume let’s sellers push it down easier. Tomorrow should pick up to normal after “the talk”. We will see from there but today really isn’t a tell.
The trumptyrioters at the Capitol preferred T-Mobile phones bc T had no service!
It is obvious how the market feels about this stock. Reaching lower and lower as most stocks are at all time highs. Severe competition and heavy debt. Owner of Direct TV that is losing millions of customers continually! This stock needs to be a lot cheaper before I would consider it in my portfolio.
Just manipulation they want to buy cheap. The earnings are good. This stock is going to be over 40 next year. Very safe field for investors
Looks like we're finally breaking though $30! Go T! CNN most watched cable news network.
"Here comes the dividend reinvestment get ready to say OH NO up T goes as your broker rips you OFF LOL,LOL,LOL"
"T gets left out of almost all the conversations about online streaming companies. Media is very focused on Apple, which is a joke. T has the second largest catalog behind Disney. Netflix by comparison would need to spend decades creating content at their current pace to catch up to where T is today. I don't think people realize how massive this really is."
"So let me get this straight. Over the past year T has dropped from 38 to 28 a share, but the dividend makes this a good stock to hold?? I'm just trying to understand ones logic for continuing to hold this... Anyone care to explain?"
I’m sure yesterday’s surge was not an accident. Worst comes to worst we collect 7.2% forever.
"Wondering if just buying in after market and selling in pre market , almost daily, is the best way to trade T"

After obsurd DTV purchase and overpaying for Warner, we are nevertheless finally at a point where T is actually utilizing their Warner assets in a strategic way, yet these assets are being ignored at the moment, however by next earnings the success of HBO Max both as a service as well as it's role in post paid adds and low churn will be too obvious to ignore"
"I just resold for .24 each, the T Puts that I bought back this morning for .16 each. That's not a lot in actual money but it is a lot in percent per trade. A 50% gain in one day is a good trade no matter how much money is involved."
"even the DEM wits now think Joe is a DEM wit without and brain screw up. because of what it's going to cost the American people for Joe stopping all drilling and cancelling the pipeline.

No $ , H, I, T , you just can not make this stuff up LOL,LOL,LOL you have to LOL or LOL"
"WOW look at all the new HBO MAX subs to the moon Alice . Going to destroy NFLX , I would bet that HBO MAX even took some from DIS. They sure came out and fast tracked the 3 WW movie so you know they got a lot of new sign ups for HBO MAX ."

"TI guess someone reported my post? Yahoo deleted it. Be jealous if you want to, but I hold 57K shares of T at just under 30 and pan on compounding anything priced at $32/share or under.Call me."
Disney and HBO Max have all the content to dominate World Wide streaming by 2025!
Don't believe any article you read about the C Band Auction. None of them know anything. That info will not be disclosed until after the auction is over. It's all just speculation.
Health care was growing exponentially as people were living longer. Something had to be done about it or the world economy would collapse. Hence the Wu-Han virus.
"Had it with T, retired from there . Bellsouth was a great company. Sold almost all it,good dividend .Lousy mangement. will buy NO MORE...."
"If HBO ($T) ever decides to pull it together and pump out some Harry Potter TV series like Disney is doing with The Mandalorian (or all of Marvel), can you imagine the subscriber growth? They own the rights to produce any film adaptation of the #1 selling book series of all time. How hard can it be to get J.K. to sign off on this. Worth buying just on THAT. 7.5% is totally worth it for Robinhood users though, especially since they dropped their margin % to 2.5%. And yes, I get how margins work."
"Look's Like A Great Day For , AT&T , Stock , Great Safe Dividend's , At 7% , And Their Stock Price Is On It's Way To $34.00 , To $36.00 , And AT&T , Profit's Keep Growing , And I Will Be Adding More AT&T , Stock , Today , GLTA ,"

All you that left the Service and did not vote for Joe the DEM wit you need to move your TSP ASAP Good luck Joe will try and stop the massive amount of money leaving the TSP"
We shall see next week on 'Analyst Day'- if anything it is the 'high debt load' - which they already explained how they are handling and managing with over 90% of debt is 'fixed' at low rates and with well managed payment structure- and the 'DOJ /Dish conspiracy against them'.
"Yep, T folding like always."
People think investing in T is safe. Not if you consider the opportunities you are missing and what you get in return.
Well I thought they would take to stock up but the market was so bad and they did try but I have confidence the stock will open probably around 29 for the reinvestment (Drip) plan.￼￼
sooooooo much debt!! Stimulus forever??
"Randall L. Stephenson is probably in his last year or two as CEO. At some point an activist investor is going to step in. Funds own a lot of this and they can't keep taking huge haircuts year after year. As far was Wall Street is concerned, Verizon seems to do no wrong and AT&T can do nothing right."
"""It comes as no surprise that AT&T (NYSE: T) led the charge, losing 616,000 ""premium TV"" customers (mostly DirecTV subscribers). "" with these kind of q4 losses, T price has shown incredible resilience. perhaps most of the bad news is behind T."
"T) will begin trading ex-dividend on January 08, 2021. A cash dividend payment of $0.52 per share is scheduled to be paid on February 01, 2021."
"Good on HBO Max, in spite of it being Friday, I think we will end this day green!"
Another auction coming in October. Sure hope T saves for this one because we don’t need anymore debt added
"T is only selling a 30% stake of DTV to TPG for 16billion. T will still control 70% of DTV. Good move. T is beginning to make the right moves, and will become more, and more profitable."
The talk about T offering a free HBO Max supported by ads as an additional option to the ad free current option at $14.99 month. Not sure if that would work and would those paying a monthly subscription cancel and convert to free ?
REAL WINNING !!!!!
"So 5G and T is a bad investment, but TSLA, RIDE, NKLA, is good. One makes real profits, the other is working on it. Every car company can make an electric vehicle. T revenue 172BTSLA revenue 24B"
Today it's January 9th and AT&T still owns the most reliable name in fake news CNN.
"so my very capable high performance I bought new and had windows 7, now needs windows 10 for some desirable things. All the major tax software, Turbo Tax, tax act, etc. require Windows 10 if not 8. One or two have an online thing that is somewhat version independent. Jesus. This forced upgrade is as bad as the cell phone smart phone manipulation that keeps requiring, 2g to 3g to 4 g to 5g, etc"
The geriatrics that are destroying T are the same that have destroyed the earth with their greed. Forever to be remembered as the worse generation and the sooner they are gone the better for everyone. These were the same olds mad at NFLers expressing their 1st amendment. See how quickly the NFL flipped on that one when we won!!!
"T bouncing around 1996 to 1998 levels. T not alone. Look at BMY, PFE, BAC, GE, etc.....Gen X Money managers busy chasing Bitcoin, Blockchain and Bubble tech is dilutive to the entire market."

It wouldn’t surprise me if T finishes in the red￼
XYZ MUTED! 
The company needs some growth. No real sales growth in 10 years.
ATT is cash-strapped.What's left to monetize?CNN?CNN?
"I keep seeing these effective T Mobile ads on tv. Where are T’s ? T Mobile is aggressive while T plods along. Even as a long time T investor, I admireT Mobile for what they have done."
In the meantime everyone is watching HBO Max and talking on their AT&T Cell ...And Direct TV is the best. It's Dividend is safe and sound. It's unbelievable AT&T is not at $60 pps. It's currently operating extremely fast and well. It's at the front of everything. Including owning Warner Bros Entertainment. This Company is rocking it.
"Does T close above $29.00 today. Thumbs up ""Yes""Thumbs down ""No"""
Analyst mentioned Comcast’s should spin off Peacock streaming service and merge or combine it with with ATT’s HBO max and start a new company. Would post the link but I don’t know how. Said otherwise they will never catch Netflix or Disney as content acquisition is to expensive.
"Wow, look at that BP go!! Woo Woo"
I just rolled my March 26 $26 BP covered calls up to the $27's for a cost of .58 each.
"Has lost over 20% in the last year, but hey, it has that great dividend, hahaha."
Green is good.
"Believe far more chance of 20% up than down especially if HBO surprises to upside which I think it will....that said, most likely scenario is flat stock price and continue to enjoy the 7% yield."
...and the big sell of starts. too much debt. no jobs. cant stimuli to infinity!
America’s flocking to movies and bars. (Yahoo news) Warner has about 17 releases this year.
Phil I hope you got the joke
CNN rating up.. AT&T is simple
Stock goes down dividends go up yes dividend is better for me I ain’t giving up my stake
Newbie to this stock. In with 3500@28.69 last week.Happy New Year 
Will it close at $29 or higher? Yes or No.
HBO 41 mill wow
I believe T is on the right track.
Tell the CNN news crew to just report the news. I'm not interested in their personal views.
"T The only American company left you can trust your data with up and green like it should be and the EU run companies VZ, TMUS down and red like they should be as they collect your data to farther the EU's one world order."
"The sum of all assets value exceed what T stock trades now , some think that T debt is too high but they neglect that money is cheap and T businesses are cash generator positive, shares at historically low price, with great dividends payout, T in the process of selling non core businesses and reduce debt in parts or whole. T will hold well in a down market. T is better than holding cash .....Cheers"
Nice stock we have right here lol.
25 DOLLAR IS FAIR PRICE FOR T
Any spike close to or over 30 is an unloading opportunity if you are overweight and cost average is green(ish)28 and below ... add crumbs to lower cost average Rinse and Repeat If market is due for a “major correction” why would T be immune to that pressure ?
Are we printing Homelessness again? GO BIG.
2021 should be a good year for T we should close above 30 Today .HBO-Max is great should help with $$$$$
So...is AT&T destined to stay flat forever??
This is T longs today no stoping us
"Joe and the DEM wits are now using your TSP money again as they steal from you. Just like Obama and Joe did, You can not stop it the only thing you can now do is move your TSP to your own IRA so you are in control of your own money , Joe hates the military that's why they are stealing your money . DEM with hate the military , Remember how bad it was under Obama , Clinton , It will be even worse under Briden and his left wing ding bats. You took an oath to protect America from the Left wing Ding bat DEM wits that want to destroy America. FACT."
Headed to $40. The T content engine hasn't even started yet. If you like Disney and Netflix. Give HBO just a fraction of those multiples and is off and running. The growth is about to be unlocked.
"Argus maintains $48 target:• Reaffirming BUY and $48 target• AT&T's lackluster 3Q19 results, reported on October 28, were overshadowed by the company'sannouncement of its new operating and capital allocation plan, and the introduction of the new HBOMax subscription video-on-demand service.• Management believes that subscriber losses from the Entertainment Group (DirecTV), have peaked.• We are lowering our 2019 EPS estimate to $3.57 from $3.59, but are raising our 2020 forecast to$3.65 from $3.63.• The interest from activist investor Elliott Management has driven T shares higher in 2019, though inour view they remain a bargain relative to some competitors."
A close over $30!!!!!Yahooooooooooo!!!!
you know i was thinkng of selling my shares of viacom and buying att for their dividend.But after what I just heard on Tucker Carlson I wouldn't buy Att if it was a dollar a share.Shame on Att for putting profits before America and shame on anyone who owns Att for putting profit before their country!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Latest from Morningstar: 'T wants customers' :""AT&T Wants Customers: Analyst Day Highlights Focus onStability; Shares AttractiveAnalyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Director, 12 Mar 2021AT&T wrapped up the U.S. wireless carrier proceedings, holding its analyst day following Verizon and TMobile earlier in the week. Unlike its peers, AT&T declined to provide concrete longer-term financialforecasts. The firm instead outlined its expectations in broad strokes, with one exception: debt leverage.AT&T put stability and growth at the center of its messaging to investors, emphasizing the investmentsit is making in 5G, fiber, and HBO Max as foundations for the business. We continue to like the movesnew CEO John Stankey has made thus far. We don’t plan to change our $36 fair value estimate, and webelieve the shares are attractive.Management expects to end the year with net debt at 3.0 times EBITDA, up from 2.7 at the end of 2020and with net leverage declining to 2.5 times EBITDA or lower in 2024. While AT&T does have a higherdividend payout ratio than Verizon or T-Mobile, all three firms now have similar leverage metrics and areat least hinting at large shareholder returns in the coming years. AT&T also has the most diversebusiness mix of the three. We continue to view AT&T’s balance sheet as a strategic limitation (it wouldbe nice to repurchase shares at the current dividend yield) but not a significant threat to its viability.Stankey took the opportunity to address differences between his approach and that of his predecessor.He directly conceded that AT&T has been underinvesting in important areas, including efforts to retainand attract wireless customers. Stankey views establishing and growing customer relationships as the top priority for 2021, which will require investment in networks and content along with additionalmarketing efforts. Both Verizon and T-Mobile used their analyst days to strongly hint that wirelesspricing won’t change much over the next couple of years. While we’re disappointed that the industryisn’t showing pricing power, we’re at least hopeful that AT&T’s drive for customer growth won’t ignite aprice war""."
"There are 123.91 M Shares Sold Short as (02/12/21). If you own T shares, don't let your broker make your shares available to shorts. To prevent that from happening an action you can do, is to place your T holding for sell for an inflated price, that way your broker can't make your shares available for shorts. Do it today !"
Big boys are gobbling up the stock now ——> their analysts will come out and upgrade it —-> big boys make a lot of dough $$$$
"My investment strategy is simple: Besides mutual and index funds (and a select few other individual stocks), buy, hold and never sell AT&T, Verizon and Apple. Hard to go wrong with these three in your back pocket, especially since everyone is 'cellphone addicted' now-a-days. Keep texting my friends lol"
Well there goes the Div
We learned today that the power grid can not support any electric cars even today or the future. LOL 13 states you can not charge any electric cars . What a waste of money is being wasted on electric cars that can not be charged today or even in the future. You will not get me to put one dime in electric cars because that future will not make it. DEM wit pipe dream.
Warner bros is the 2nd highest revenue movie producer ahead of Universal studios! Warner Bros movies are eating the competition alive this season. Reaching a billion worth of sales and eventually more!
"AT&T is making money with 'late payment fees' for the past months on bills that do not even arrive in time to be paid within five business days of the date due listed on the bill. That is highway robbery and fraudulent billing. They blame the USPS and put the burden on their customers to correct a problem of the companies making. Hopefully some NY or CA class action outfit will call them. Or consumer watchdogs will force them to at least mail out a postcard notifying customers, as they can do that for any marketing or promo but not for this as it is making them a ton of unwarranted cash. Late fees paid by customers who are not late at all. Bet other compaies are doing the same thing."
One of the best values out there. Market is just rewarding other metrics besides cash flows and user bases. If T was an IPO it would go up 500% in a day. Let’s get some god dam positive news going
100% right Pat.
Netflix showed good results. Difficult situation for T. I hope it will not be that bad. I will abadon this stock with just a small profit.
Red Equal has been placed in The MUTED Waiting Room.

"In the next episode of “Dividend Chasers,” watch another .5% disappear from T investors."
Did I just actually see a good ATT commercial?
The Lincoln Project versus CNN.It's hard to decide which one is worse?
T= Free cash flow $7.9 Billion up 78% Full year $22.4 Billion up 36%
At one time we would get a dividend increase in December.Anyone know why we have not received an increase ?
yikes. painful reversal in semis. im getting hurt. #AMD
"I've been a share holder for awhile now and today I have decided... At&t is a value trap. I haven't sold my shares yet, but I'm on the brink. I had hopes otherwise, but it seems every time we take a step forward we take another step back. It's like management has actively decided to be the worst or just next to it in every industry they get us in. I was hoping for an entire divesture of DTV, but we got a measly $7B back out of the $67B invested. Debt is crippling this company from growth and now we just went and took out even more debt to be in the 5G auction. VZ made double the investment in 5G that we just did so they will easily be the industry leader in 5G taking market share from At&t. I first looked at At&t's multiple streams of income as a way to be diversified. However they are arent a leader in any of the industries they are in. There is no focus. Slow to no growth Telecom, confusing/ chaotic media provider (HBO go, HBO Max, At&tNow, DirecTV, Uverse), content creator (don't even want to see how bad they mess up warnermedia) I'm sure any income they get from warner media will be squandered away to pay for past mistakes and playing catch up in 5G. I dont even trust the dividend is safe anymore. Rising interest rate are coming and that will be the end of it. I've just had enough. Hopefully my shares will go to somebody who can find the value in it that I can't."
"I heard Joe tell a reporter the other day that the reporter was a One Horse Pony. He said you are a real One Horse Pony. What is that. I have heard of a One Trick Pony, but never a One Horse Pony. Is that a monogamous pony or what. Gaffe number 462,149."

Maybe old Warren Buffett made the wrong call by buying VZ and not T. We will see.
looks like little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff 123456789 woke up from his after lunch nap.....or his meds have worn out......he sure does spew out meaningless BEE ESS for someone who owns ZERO ATT shares
"omg, look at it fade. It is going to finish red again! T is hopeless."
"All the T HATERS get ready to say OH NO up T goes, Why because both VZ and TMAUS earnings report are Telling you T's new unlimited cell plan were you get HBO MAX for FREE is now taking customers away from both of them , Just wish T had started that sooner, but they are now taking more and more customers away from both VZ and TMUS everyday. T monster is ALIVE and now growing . LOL,LOL,LOL"
Mother Zucker should just leave now. Only.put out the statement trying to find a job.
T is sick.Thank you ANDY for bringing BP back to my attention. I had completely forgotten about it until you reminded me of it again. You can remind me of other great stocks anytime! Woo Woo
Gonna use my stock certificates to wipe stuff off the bottom of my shoe.

Go bucks.. GO T..32 tomorrow.
"Down 30% in two years. That just about 5 years worth of dividend yield. Revenues have declined for the past two years. Maybe it's time to get someone new at the helm. Stephenson has been CEO for 11 years, and the only thing that continues to go up is his salary. The shareholders sure aren't seeing any benefit."
I need this to drop back to 29.90 new buy price i have missed the last months lows by pennies
Does it make sense to replace T with a better combination of Viacom CBS and Verizon?
DG MUTED!
TMany of those HBO subscribers are free and don't even know they have it. More smoke and mirrors from T. Short-lived pop and then back down to 29's. Show me don't tell me.
free money falling from the sky - who knew the covid party would be so great
Down she goes day after day So nice
CNN must be spun off. If you can't sell it just spin it off and let it sink. CNN is all about what is worst with this country. It has to go! It is an embarrassment to all shareholders.
wow if this ain't stability than I dunno what stability is
"I have a theory on the price action for T this past week. If you look at stocks that have even a remotely larger short interest, they have performed much better this past week - see SKT, IRM, KR and of course, GME. Could it be possible; even probable, that these hedge funds have been freaked by the whole GME phenomenon and are covering their shorts to keep from being ""hooded""? Where are they getting the $$ to cover their short positions? Selling from other long positions, if they have no money on the sidelines. And, if they have money on the sidelines, they are not putting new money to work in T at the moment. In a sense, we are being manipulated in that weak long positions are selling and there aren't as many buyers as there normally would be due to it being put to work elsewhere. Just my theory and I'm sticking to it. We will return to $35 or more in the coming month...just hang tight."
"Other than the dividend, AT&T is a dud. Unless you're one of those ""set it and forget"" types, then maybe you are happy with its lack of performance."
Bought some shares throughout the past two weeks and some more earlier today. In at an average of $29.00 . Will be adding to my position with my dividend payment.
Is there a need for 10G?Just trying to start the conversation.
I wonder how much are stock is going to go down today
ED pattern on the one day chart.
"Chill. It's just bad timing. The tide of the overall market is too negative for any individual company like T to overcome, even with a relative positive report. The price of T today is not about T, just a general reflection in sympathy with the market. If T was going to get hit, it was going to get HIT, period. A negative report today would have sent the stock MUCH farther downward! Again, today's action is not personal to T, just the market carrying T along. T's report today will truly be reflected when the market resumes, and apparently that ain't happening today. Yes. it can be frustrating, but don't be a sucker and sell today. I always thought it would be the next quarter before you get a true indicator of real sustainable positive movement in these times of a pandemic. Again, today is ALL about the MARKET, not T. Chill!"
"Raymond James upgrades ATT to outperform, target 32."

T's monster is alive and going to be taking millions and millions of customers from VZ, T Mobile and NFLX LOL,LOL you don't even need to make stuff up when it's all so true . Took the smartest people in the room to build a real monster that no company can compete with LOL,LOL,LOL"
Vagician muted! Low IQ
The DTV deal lands with a thud. Ex CEO Randy makes Immelt look like a genius. He is the one responsible for one idiotic decision after another. Gonna take a long time to clean up this mess. They ought to take Randy's one million dollar fee and give to some young up and comer who might have an idea how to properly market their assets. A very stodgy company that needs some outside help. IMO
Looks like a major flush tomorrow morning...Thanks Joe.
"Here's a legitimate question for this board. Whenever T drops, someone always says, ""I love when T drops because it gives me another chance to buy cheap shares."" So why do so many of you whine every time T has a Red day? Are you happy that you can ""load up"" on more ""cheap shares"" or are you frustrated that it dropped again? The other possibility is that you don't really know if you're happy or frustrated. So which is it??"
More people here are starting to see the value of selling Puts and Covered Calls to boost their returns and that makes me feel good. Just trying to help you all make more money here.
Gamer MUTED!
Just read cnn ratings down yeah 30 could still happen. In a parallel universe
No interest in the telecoms right now.
The weekends is only time T isnt dropping...
great volume and price action considering the market dropping like a rock
If they really want to juice HBO Max they should speed up the production of Game of Thrones prequel House of the Dragon! Currently the release date is sometime in 2022....
Wow cnbc trying to protect the little guy from trading no journalism
Wallstreet Bets please come to T and Squeeze the Shorts here
The dividend is not secure.AT&T's Capital Ratio is now .82VZ's Capital Ratio is 1.38
For sure now one thing is becoming really clear VZ did not change the company enough to compete in the new world they now face as they are now losing customers to both T's monster new cell plans and T mobile. The only asset VZ has is now running off it's customers and SHAREHOLDERs as they VZ one world oder yahoo NATZI censor both their customers and shareholders LOL You don't even need to try and make stuff up when it all so true. If you own any VZ shares you will need to be out of VZ stock before VZ next earnings report show all the customers losses that are now taking place. WOW is it bad now at VZ
"If millions switch from T because of CNN, T's dividend is not safe."
"Still no word on the DTV situation. Everything about this company takes forever. Took them forever to get the streaming service off the ground, so why should the DTV deal be any different."
"Hello folks fellow long $T here with 1800 shares. I want to direct attention to my successful high dividend and growth plays . MO is going to 50 at least and pays well, and ORCC is a hidden gem with at least 30-40% upside with massive dividend."
Sam MUTED!!!
This might be the only stock didn’t work this year.......
That lawsuit going to sit for years ain’t gonna change nothing it’s going past 31 regardless
Forward p/e of 10.....HBO Max will outperform Netflix in latest quarter for new subscriber growth (Netflix PE is >80) and company will also benefit from 5G super cycle. The only thing not to like is high debt....but given low interest rate can live with that. I bought $AAPL when PE was 12......for me this is similar value opp that we will look back and say...why didn’t I see how that stock was beaten down to a crazy point? Good luck all....do your own DD but I am long T and have conviction it will be a top performer in 2021.
welcome back to everyone looking for a safehaven rn
option expiry today
"AT&T's movies had 80% of the USA box office this past weekend. The latest being ""Tom and Jerry"". They are doing as well as they can with a little more than 50% of the theaters closed and the movies being available on HBO Max. By the end of this year, the theaters will probably be open again."
"This must be one of the most pointless stocks of the last year. Omg, what a disaster, goes nowhere."
LONG ON T
Shorts have the wrong stock in T--short something with no cash flows! Cash flow of T is super in this environment and dividend is solid.
AT&T is not undervalued. It's valued at whatever someone is willing to pay for it.
anyone else get the feeling this will close today right around 28.50 strike?
"any tech analysis fans out there, T hit the bottom of a 2,20dma Bollinger band today."
park your money here and collect 7 % .I done that 9 years ago .might sell in 10 more years.
"In the pre-market it appeared like T was in for a bad day. But so far it's turning out to be ok! For a moment there it went over $30.00. Something is up, besides T's price!"
First big day in awhile and people on here talking like it’s going to the moon again. This is an earnings bump. People chasing in hopes of a big beat. Any miss on eps or subs and we see $27 again fast. So let’s just hope for the best and stop the speculation.
"guess my 30 dollar call will expire worthless today. guess I'll write another one next week. Maybe I'm just meant to keep this stock. Meanwhile, blood pressure will continue to spike."
CNN is nonstop lies 24 hours a day. AT&T owns CNN.
"I have owned this stock a few times and have had AT &T at my business for over 40 years but had to finally let it go, i called 2 months ago as my statement went from 207 to 440 because my agreement lapsed, i called and agreed to sent up a new agreement was told the price will be the same as before for another year and they would credit one month over payment which they did, then on next months bill i was charged 440.00 again asking why they say we discontinued dsl service well being a little upset said i just agreed to 2 months ago to the same price and for a year. they basically told me things changed and my bill will be 270.00 a month instead of 207.00 because they discontinued dsl. well i changed to spectrum so my bill will be 0 from at&t. very disapointing"
"Reportedly (SA article) an industry expert has projected that HBOM has beaten all contenders in new subs for Q4 capturing just short of 20% of total while NFLX was distantly placed with a 7.2% capture.If those projections are anyway close to reality then there will be a lot of short crying on 1/27.Since NFLX just reported 8.5 million new subs in Q4 (up over 11% AH) HBOM would have added over 22 millions new subs in Q4.Even if projection is wildly off and HBOM capture is only 12% that would be over 14 millions new subs.Pollyannish, as it may sound, it is not implausible given the late Q4 deals with Amazon and Roku and the release of WW84 on Christmas. Also considering that Stephenson reported 4 million new subs as of late October/early November, and that was before both deals, neither the 14 nor the 22 millions are outlandish."
Netflix up 15% just today and we get a 7% annual dividend?

And here.. we.. go!
CNN takes poll position from Fox. “AT&T Inc's CNN topped cable networks with roughly 2.8 million viewers per day”
"Is this Stankey's first earnings report since he became ceo?If so, It's hard to imagine that it would be anything but okay or better. Or at least accompanied by some good news about the sale of DTVand/or respectable HBOmax sub numbers.Only my opinion. Glta."
"Hope you got some shares on sale this morning , Last chance because earnings are coming and the numbers from HBO MAX , Get ready to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
AT&TSinger and Elliott are shameless. They made money on 90 percent of their stake from 2019 but lost money on the final 10% that they sold last year. 5 million shares. So now he buys 5 million shares again to try and get a bounce to dump those for a profit as well.
"Partnership with Nokia. Hilarious, Two peas in a pod, both bum stocks and companies."
They sell stake in DirecTV to pay for 5G bidding.
Jason Kilar tweeting about the 80s Lakers series Showtime. Could be epic.
"Looking forward this year, if DTV is sold, considerably less revenue. Much higher costs for HBO content as HBO makes up revenue lost due to theatre closures. $18+ billion spent but not completely paid for spectrum. It doesn’t look like an environment that allows for debt reduction. As other services providers partner with streamers. T, because of owning HBO, finds it’s at competitive odds with BOTH service providers AND streamers. Jury is out on owning Warner."
Roll Tide!
I don’t know why I feel this is going to pop to $50 bucks all other mobile companies are over $50 ATNT is super undervalued
Very strong day this early post dividend
The 30 day grace period for disclosure of positions is bumping up against the annual meeting. I'm thinking someone is playing his hand now because proxy time is around the corner.
"The C-Band auction should be AT&T last major investment. No others that I'm aware of anyway.. After that's all said and done, LTD will rise a bit near-term, but capital expenditures should remain relatively stable for the foreseeable future as HBO Max, 5G, and Fiber build outs more forward as planned. FCF will be sufficient to continue funding those build outs while servicing debt and paying dividends. Of course it will take years for a multinational conglomerate of this size to build shareholder value. In the meantime, collect cash and reinvest."
all this roaring action this week is a HUGE SIGN!14% unemployment is a reality.
"Federal Judge Rules That FTC Doesn't Have Strong Enough Evidence In Claims Against AT&T's DirecTV -- MarketWatch2:52 pm ET August 16, 2018 (MarketWatch)SharePrintA federal judge ruled on Thursday that the Federal Trade Commission doesn't have strong enough evidence to back its claim that AT&T Inc. (T) subsidiary DirecTV engaged in deceptive advertising of its satellite TV service, according to the Wall Street Journal. The FTC was seeking nearly $4 billion in restitution, alleging in 2015 that DirecTV had advertised a discounted 12-month pay-TV plan but didn't make it clear to consumers they were actually signing up for a two-year contract and that prices could increase. AT&T shares have fallen 15% so far this year, while the S&P 500 has gained 6.3%"
"DOW 50K, T $32. Thats my prediction."
AT&T is not really controversial... Gene Inger simply says buy the dips 29-31 especially if we get another during re-allocation; and watch and see this stock not just maintain the dividend but move higher on a stronger PE multiple as a media stock within a year.
Stoked I bet on this company! Excited for the dividend payments.
"Wall Street is buying T but so sorry if you own VZ you are about to lose lots of money LOL,LOL,LOL"
I'm calling on AT&T to keep it's Aristocrat Dividend in tact. I would like to see a 1 penny added to the Dividend and continue it's Legacy. Thank You.
"The DOW is up only 0.38%. T is up over 2.60%. However, volume seems normal. Anything, anyone?"
As an employee I will get my div at COB of ex div date. Then I will shed 25-30% if it recovers some of the div amount.Been burnt with its downhill climb towards and post ER too many times. Maybe HBOMax will save the dayMaybe notWill buy back again if major dip or hold/DRIP the rest as needed.
Moscow Mitch is History. That Turtle needs to take his place in the back benches of the Senate and ride out his term.
6 percent dividend and PE less than for 7 is not bad
Laughable that CNN is just now putting some heat on Gov. Cuomo. Where was this before the elections?!? I thought so..No credibility as a news source.
$30 calls slipping away. Better hope tomorrow brings some good news
"Make 6% dividend,lose 20% per year"
Still at the same price where I bought it and keeps paying out dividends. Limited downside risk. Give it another year for capital appreciation and get paid to wait....
Ugly day in the market. But $T is outperforming the Dow and the other indices. Forming a nice strong base here. I will buy more tomorrow.
I suspect T will go down tomorrow to $29.62. Just a feeling.
"So far, drop today exceeds the dividend earned yesterday. Appears T back to range of $28-$29. Maybe change if good earnings report later this month and HBO Max subscribers increased to at least 20 million plus."
If you want to get the dividend in T you have to own the shares before Jan 8 2021 . why because T goes ex dividend on Jan 8 2021 Time to lock in that dividend before you miss out
It should be over $40.00 but I am here for the Dividend which is very generous.
"Ok ATT TV raised my streaming TV another $10 a Month and that is the straw that broke the Camel's Back I am moving on to another service. Started around $40 a Month now up over $80. Do not have ATT in my portfolio, so I couldn't care less what the stock price does. Bought Kroger before Warren Buffet great earnings and service. Good by Bandito!"
This stock closes green today.
Still believing and paying my bills on time.
"All the T haters better learn to say OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL"
"T is my largest holding but I feel that it is a company that has lost it's way. Recently, I cancelled DTV and now I am switching to T Mobile because T has lousy customer service and has not bothered to update DTV since the pathetic purchase. I believe that the next earnings report will show continued baling not only on DTV but also on the mobile side. I actually hate this company but have not sold it due to the dividend."
Do you all know what one can do with INFINITE cash. Control the markets. If the FED wants the markets to go up it will go up. If the FED wants the markets to go down it will go down.Never go against the FED.

"Got my Div. today. FromAT&T, Very happy. Good Div."
"Tax loss selling season is over. Where will people park their money? Perhaps at a undervalued stock, trading near a 5+ year low, paying a 7.3% dividend?"
"Trimmed portfolios into cash hoarding for now.Making bank on SRMX, MARA and ADMP at the moment. Yes, its gambling but still funny how I am making back entire dividends with only a few hundred dollars in play. About the only thing to do now is find runners separate from the bloated broad market.Still have a decent chunk of T at just above cost average. Not losing sleep on it and have maximum DROP and contributions going to it while it churns"
Too bad they couldn't unload Direct TV. Huge mistake buying that.
NNDMDOES ANYBODY KNOW WHY ARK IS BUYING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF SHARES EVERYDAY OF NNDMThanks in advance and thank me later DO YOUR RESEARCHNNDM is Almost top 5 in ARKQ they did their DD
The stock price is telling you what a success HBO Max and WW84 is.
"People are buying more shares, omg, talk about dense. Down over 20% in a year while everything else up huge, but it pays that dividend. smh..."
Looks like some profit taking after a couple good days. Some money is to be made if you are in the cycle and start chasing the stock share pricing. I have a couple of companies I hold with 3 and 4 dollar swings every week. I just can’t bring myself to chasing stocks. When this is over I hope our economy recovers in a timely manner. I am too old to have to live through a four year recession. Be safe. Be well.
If T is a defensive stock then why aren't more running into it for the dividend and overall fundamentals?
"Homegamers..... I Had 8,900 Shares.... Kept For The DIVVY..Sold 2 Day Ago Actually @29.67.....Found KMI, Also Paying A Great DIVVY Tomorrow.......Took My T Money........Bought KMI... You Might Say I SOLD T And......."
"The deal is closed, to be appealed it would have to be a issue of law"
"I dare anyone to read anything into this chart with the loan exception maybe that the price it's currently trading around seems like it has become support, excluding the wash-out in Dec, which took down the whole market. Even recent moves in golden cross and macd crossovers haven't meant @#$#. But that's all fine, because my belief all along has been the company simply needs to deliver some good fundamental news....be it earnings or key drivers. Any others on the board that consider themselves good chartists feel free to weigh in. I'm one that believes sometimes, not often but sometimes, a stock becomes totally detached from the technicals. That's where I think we are."
"Let's see what happens when 5G come's out, and all the potential that will come with it. T will be right in the forefront of it all with other big companies."
"AT&TOh my.. but what do you expect when the new CEO, when speaking of the dividend, says ""what do we get for it???"""
Does anyone know what Craig Moffet's thoughts are on this huge investor day for T?
"This is where we sit.CURRENT PRICE27.89, at support, 28.03 ± 0.364 type double, strength 10SUPPORT BELOW-1.7% at 27.41 ± 0.356 type single, strength 5-4.5% at 26.62 ± 0.346 type single, strength 5RESISTANCE ABOVE+4% at 29 ± 0.377 type triple+, strength 10+7% at 29.84 ± 0.388 type triple, strength 9+10.5% at 30.82 ± 0.401 type single, strength 8"
"27.00 - 27.50 would be a great range to add, a retest of 26.50 even better.There is not too much short interest. A target of 37.00 could be a level to exit the trade."

The DEMS will get T to $40 by the end of this year. Just watch.
T selling Direct TV--Good news or Bad?
Let's keep that selling price slightly above $29 by Feb 26 so the Feb 26 $29 Puts I sold expire worthless. I'm pulling for you T. A Slightly above $29 close on Feb 26 would be perfect!
I love my CNN. The #1 cable news network. I love my propaganda. CNN never lies as they’re the ministry of truth. I only trust CNN news. Fox news is for insurrectionist.
"Next movers for T share price include Kong vs Godzilla, normal runup to ex dividend day, and 2 wks later earnings report. If all go well we could be looking at 32-33 by end of April."
"Expect big move on Friday to $34 on Investor's Day. Most likely a Buyback announcement. No one is expecting much, which is why we'll get a big move. T is now getting tailwinds on so many fronts. It will not stay below $30 for very long."
Doubt T will go higher or lower. Its stuck in the mud spinning its wheels. As long as it pays 7% its a CD.
Cash hoard truck restarted...just warming up ...not backing up yet....
"Sorry folks, I think today is my fault. Every time I pickup more, the stock drops. I have been averaging down since 34 and figured 29.65 was a nice catch. I will let everyone know when I buy more next time so you can get out first."
I prefer the price holding right here. Many of us get tempted to sell if a stock goes up 10% and miss out on decades of dividend reinvestment. This tape makes me a forever holder.
"An honest question from a novice trader.I'm looking for an entry point on T, and I already have multiple scars from trying to catch falling knives so don't want to add to my collection.In the opinion of the board how will the possible decisions of the DOJ case affect the price?If they approve the deal will the price go up or down and conversely if they say no which way is the price likely to move?"
"My projection: in the next 3-6 months this stock will hit 39.00 USD.Which might not be as high as you want, but that's probably the max, and still offers a good upside.On the downside I see 26.50 USD. I took a position today, wasn't paying attention to this before."
"The FED will buy up at least 50% of the bonds before they are done. With all the money printing, Inflation will be 0.1%. Thats the Core PCE deflator."
"T Mobile @ $130 share vs T @ $28+ per share. Why is that, other than difference in management. I had sold 1/3 of my T when it recently reached $30 and change, and was ridiculed for it but looking back, was a good decision. Still have the remaining 2/3 shares (800) and just hoping for good er on Jan 27th, so T doesn’t drop more."
"Hiya HomeGamers !I LOVE MY 'T' ! Long About 8,900 @28.82 or so.Just Sold Some SLV. Have 178K Ready To ADD To My T Position...Come Back To $28.82....Ready to ADD More !"

"Just be glad you don't own VZ or T Mobile because their stock are dropping and they are going to get SLAUGHTER as T stock Skyrockets LOL,LOL,LOL"
I'd like to see T move up to $29 again where my Puts are.

Red in a sea of green. Ground hog day. Again.
T is in no man’s land with the grey area surrounding future dividend increases. The cash flow is monstrous but knowing when to go Long for the long term is now a crapshoot.
No stock is safe guys. If your long term you shouldn’t care about day to day price fluctuations
"Bloomberg) -- AT&T Inc. is nearing a deal to sell a significant stake in DirecTV to private equity firm TPG, marking a long-sought exit from the struggles of managing a declining satellite TV business.A deal would value DirecTV at about $15 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter. That’s a fraction of the $48.5 billion AT&T agreed to pay for the business in 2014.If AT&T and TPG are able to reach a deal, an announcement could come as soon as this week or next, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.The talks could still fall apart and end without a deal, the people said."
"Wow, T is green, that's a first."
Teun MUTED!
What Does this mean to the current T shareholder? Will we get shares of the new company or is it publicly traded?
"$32 post earnings beat, hbo max numbers and content pipeline, 5G rollout, stable+ 2021 outlook. Implied div yield 6.5%. CNN is a drop in the ocean of AT&T, and still the best news station globally. Stop the whining :)"

CNN - dont fear the facts. Try to prove them wrong if they make you sad.#facts
This thing will not cross $30 today. I guarantee it.
"Because I’m a Direct TV customer and an AT&T customer, I believe I will get HBO Max at a discount every month......and maybe the first 3 months free. :-)"
"That sharp fall at end of day, preview of tomorrow’s opening, lol."
"YEP ! It Was T......Reason For The Nashville Incident !Investigators are reportedly examining whether a suicide bomber with a fear of 5G technology could be behind a Christmas morning explosion in Nashville’s historic downtown that injured three people.The blast, which caused extensive damage to dozens of buildings in Tennessee’s biggest city, took place outside a facility owned by the telecommunications company AT&T and knocked out or impaired mobile phone services in several other cities.Federal agents spent the weekend looking into a 63-year-old man who owned an RV motorhome similar to the one that detectives believe was turned into a mobile bomb and driven to the scene.Meanwhile, a Nashville television news channel reported that a person of interest, named as Anthony Warner from a south eastern suburb of the city, worked as an information technology consultant for a real estate company.Steve Fridrich, a realtor who contacted the FBI after hearing the man’s name on a news bulletin, told WSMV TV that federal agents had asked him if Warner had a paranoia about 5G technology.According to WSMV, sources close to the law enforcement investigation have said that among the various tips and lines of inquiry was one that suggested Warner bought into a conspiracy theory that 5G technology was being used to spy on Americans."
"@R going to be crying once he figures out T will probably takes another 15 bln$ charge for DirecTV and another 25 bln$ loan for 5G Spectrum. It'll hit the books in the first quarter with him paying for it, YOU son!"
Sure CEO realized the debt issue and will do everything he can to reduce. We don’t know things he doesn’t. Stock will rise every announcement of debt reduction!
Can’t wait for the next GoT

"For those of you worried about T cutting dividends. Not going to happen. Read below:A classic Dividend AristocratAT&T is a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the S&P 500 that has hiked its dividend annually for over 25 years. AT&T (known as Southwestern Bell/SBC Corporation before 2005) raised its dividend annually for 33 straight years.AT&T expects its adjusted EPS to hit the ""upper end of the $3.50 range"" this year, which would represent at least 15% growth from the previous year. The company currently pays a $0.50 quarterly dividend, which equals $2.00 per share for the full year -- which should be easily covered by its earnings.AT&T noted that its free cash flow (FCF) rose 17% annually to $6.5 billion during the quarter, and it expects to finish the year with FCF ""at the high end of the $21 billion range."" That should give AT&T, which spent $12 billion on dividend payments in fiscal 2017, plenty of room to raise its dividend and pay off its long-term debt."
Man I love when this stock price goes down. I feel the NEED to buy more! My future self is so thankful when that dividend hits!
FED handout of $50 a month program for all low income Americans is huge this is many BILLIONS of free money to $T forever...
@cheetah is also using the call strategy
"T is down over 24% since this time last year. Factor in the divy, and it's only down over 17%."
It's like Tom Hanks when he finally got his raft past the big waves surrounding the island. LOL
"In this market stock increase because of momentum. Nothing else. Until T goes up, it won't go up. I don't really understand the thinking, but it's a fact and momentum wins. Market Caps and PE ratios are worthless. T needs to stop the dividend, pay the debt and then the stock will catch fire. As long as they have a dividend they have a metric in which they can't be judged. Tesla has no dividend or even yearly profits, so they can't be judged on anything but hype. That's the new market currency - Hype! T needs to start hyping their brand and get serious about it. Spin off HBO and it would be a $100B company on it's own within a few years. But under T it will have a value of ZERO forever because of T's debt."
Asked everyone many times to refrain from political posts and stick to the business at hand. This is our office. This is our place of business. This is where we gather to share info and expertise so we can make money. The political posts and personal attacks are a waste of everyone’s time. Jim and R reported for wasting my time and other who are here trying to make money.
"Suspicious run up. Caused by dummies buying today, thinking they'll get the dividend this afternoon at closing bell."
How could anyone look at the chart of T and think it is a good investment? This thing is a complete joke.
"Job recovery, 5G, video streaming...$60"
But I thought T was a value trap?
"At&T must borrow enormously to effectuate their 5G plan. They didn’t plan ahead? Typical AT&T, lost in the past, trying to drag itself forward."

"People like Wonder Woman, but they wont sign-up for it, but the Matrix 4 is a different story. That's my date for whether I stay in this stock. If HBOmax can't sign up 30 Million more for that movie, then it's a dead service to T. If they can't make it work, T would be wise to sell it and return to being a cell company. Right now Apple would pay $150B for Time Warner/HBO. Think about T with $150B less debt and a 7% dividend. That would mean the stock at $50 or $60 easy. The job of management is to return value to shareholders in the long run (it's been 20 yrs since ATT was at $60) so if they can't get there by being a media company, then it behooves them to retrench and get there by being a cell company with low debt."

I'll guarantee this stock won't go below $28 this week.

"$T AT&T Price Target range $35 -$50, almost all stocks have climbed back to pre-pandemic level, ATT was at $38-$40 during last quarter 2019 and Jan2020. AT&T is expected to move uptrend by March 2021. Grow your position, it’s great discount price at this moment. Best dividend stock by the way."

"If you are willing to hold long term and if stankey doesn’t get us into another DTV debacle, then T will gradually pay down debt. That alone will make it go up over time.

It’s not a growth stock just income."

Then, throw in the ridiculous stimulus, easing monetary policy, etc. we are about to get an interest rate shock that will make the oil crisis of the 70s a blip. You can guess what this will do to stocks..."
one more question: who sold most of those $30 calls that expire today?
Earnings have been going down for the last 5 qtrs in a row and estimated earnings for this quarter make it down for 6 consecutive quarters. What does that tell you about the stock price?
"I want to believe in Big T, but the only way for me to figure this one is s to follow price."
"I am sure that everyone is speculating about the merger decision tomorrow? For me personally I started buying T 3 years ago before talks of a merger. I believed in AT&T then and I believen in them now. I reinvested all dividends since. My cost basis is $34.50....so I am down on share price but have 15,500 shares. So I guess what I'm saying is that if you truly believe in something solid like T, then you really should look at the big picture long term. It will only take a small rise in stock price for many investors to make thousands of dollars. Short term investors should really take a look at buying and holding in my opinion."

"A Tough & Tough announced a while back CNN Airport Network will be shut down in March 2021.. Zucker face that one, Jeff! Good thing he is leaving because without him the ship is soon to fail.!?! Lara Logan is the only real journalist left the rest are what we call in telecom ""the lackies"""
Looks like they sold defense it services business but no details given
AT&T is the best stock to own for life!
"My March $30 strike covered calls expire March 30. I doubt it will be called but if it is, they can have my shares. I expect the calls to expire worthless. The price of T common stock normally goes up right before the ex-dividend date around April 8. I plan on selling the shares when the dividend chasers push it up then and buy the shares back after the ex-dividend dategood luck"
T is for ever I’m paying my bills on time and will be watching every movie they put out so reaffirming I love at&t
"Who do you think you are preaching to @R, we are the choir."
"I still don't understand why this is under $60...We've done  the research.. It's just a waiting period, but very undervalued in our opinion. It's ridiculous but whatever. Strong Buy."
WILL CLOSE RED!!!
At $30.50 I'll be 50K strong in T... Keep on rising!!!
"AT&T, my patience is running thin. Your balance sheet isn't anything to brag about despite an attractive dividend. HBO Max has too much competition and I am starting to think that a dividend cut is warranted. I will maintain my long position with hopes that the next few earnings reports show signs of life."
Excellent decision by AT&T given the low Interest Rates...Let's also realize they refinanced their debt at historically record lows. Very Bullish and see AT&T as a great Long-term Buy. I also believe HBO Max is an excellent asset and sets the bar!
This is over a $50 stock compare it with Verizon and TMobile this is a very strong company they should be $60 plus by now 5G will take them past $50 by April
T should spin off HBO. It has nothing to do with cell and their debt issues. It would be bigger if not just as big as nflx
Just added 500 shares @$29.25 glta 
Smart investors who had multiple gains last year will start to divert their money out of over-valued stocks (soon to be corrected) to a stable high dividend stock like T. T will have definitely a different stock chart behavior this year. (will reach $50 this year)
Hooray! Good chance I'll get called away on my 30 calls.
What a shame to be wasting a big up day like this. We need to make money on up days to cover losses on down days which will be coming.
I see it didn't take long for my covid infected migrant post to be removed
"Full Disclosure I/We own shares in AT&T. Our Analysts have a $42.00 price target Because of recent inquiries to firm we have a full disclosure available... We have a current target of $42.00 public records...Given the HBO Max and 5G, we will be able to give more information. On a Personal level  I enjoy being a part of the AT&T family as a Shareholder"
"ROFL! See told you, T always folds. After 1pm it will be even worse. So predictable."
AT&T the Leader in 5G and HBO Max is definitely going to propel AT&T higher.
1 month:T down .65%VZ down 4.92%TMobile down 9.10%
"Seriously, is there no better place to make money in this market other than T ? The dividend yield can get swallowed up in a days trading. As far as price appreciation is concerned, that’s not going to happen till the debt is repaid and there is some growth. Until then a 7.15% payout is all you can get."
"guys, don't bother me right now. watching The Investigation on hbomax and trying to contribute to growth in T's stock price."
CNN should blow more wind to keep Texas' windmills going again.
"Listen to them cry as T goes higher and higher LOL SAY OH NO up T goes LOL,LOL,LOL"
I don't know why you're all so upset. T is doing just fine.
"AT&T was broken up by the government in 1984, Look it up if you don't believe."
7% yield baby
A dozen bobble heads.The bored of directors.
"Just saw the""little things"" on HBO Max last night. Good movie."
Inside day ? Gap fill? 
"Wow, what happened. It was way up before the market opened. Yikes! Sure glad I sold the Jan 29 $28.50 Puts rather than the $29's."
Dead money in VZ would actually buy more T . Today I discussed buying a sober living home . Long story but 3400 a month income is attractive
This stock continues to underperform. Time for the CEO to do something about the stock price.
"This is a BOOMER stock! Hey boomers! were in cannabis stocks like $TLRY, were in EVs like $CCIV and $NIO, were in OTCs like $LTNC, GET WITH THE PROGRAM YA OLD HAGS! ENJOY YOURE LITTLE DIVIDENDS! WERE GETTING RICH!!!!!!!"
T's 5G Monster is ALIVE and feeding
I see the rotation out of the high flyers. Investors with common sense are taking some profet and buying the laggards like T.....
"T is so underperformed. Hopefully, 2021 management will do better"
Give me $50 PPS AT&T...
"Argus maintains $38 target:Analyst's Notes""Analysis by Joseph #$%$ CFA, February 26, 2021ARGUS RATING: BUY? Reaffirming BUY and $38 target? AT&T has finally begun to divest DirecTV and other U.S. cable/satellite operations, which have been ameaningful and consistent drag on consolidated results.? While AT&T is paying a heavy price for its decision to enter the direct broadcast satellite business justas that business was declining, its deal with private equity firm TPG is one step toward improving itsfinancial profile.? AT&T will be able to retire some debt with the cash it will receive from the deal. We also expect apositive impact on margins and EBITDA growth, though there may be additional write-offs in the nearterm.? We are maintaining our 2021 EPS estimate of $3.19 and our 2022 forecast of $3.25""."
T balance sheet is so lopsided with debt and goodwill this dog is going down.
First the NRA. Next the Trump Organization.
Don't you miss the $42 days?
"Shorting T to at least $25 is the way to go, AT&T downgraded at Oppenheimer after C-band auction results."
"All major indices turned Red, T's collapse will accelerate from here."
"DO YOU LIKE FREE MONEY? AT&T is the next Disney+.... by the end of the Summer, all new Theatrical Release Blockbusters will go through HBO MAX. Add onto that an amazing Dividend. ADD on to that Institutional INVESTORS interested in 5G like Warren Buffet in Verizon. $T is both a GROWTH & VALUE STOCK DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH"
is itvworth to even bother with this?? :/
"Dow down 1200 pts. in first wk. of Crooked joe on the job, wonder how far it will go down this wk. and thoughts !"
look at that pegged at $30!!
I still believe AT&T is a $60 stock and possibly higher than that. For now We have a great Safe Dividend. I do believe We will see $60... Now let me go to my drinking and I have a date night so I need to have a few beers and go to the pharmacy awaiting a refill on my Viagra. Date Night 
"I’m cracking, I’m cracking. But then again, I’m an old schooler!"
Apple revenues were down 4.5% and it’s up 7%. AT&T revenues were down 1.3% and it’s down 4%. Apple pays a dividend of 1.85% and AT&TPays a dividend of 6.65%.
"just touching a recent high. If we go above 32.39, you have to go back to Oct of last year to find these prices. Really feels like the narrative is changing from debt-laden co that is grasping at straws to stay competitive to modern media company that foresaw the changing landscape and is on the right path, debt reduction as a focus too."
Do you know what STLA is ? It is Stellantis. The NEW 4th car manufacturer on the planet and is about to start announcing good news. That’s where my money that I have in T is going today. I am done with this.
T wants to do something but appears to be low on energy. It needs a five-hour energy drink to get it through the day. At this pace so do I.S.L.
I think this stock is just waiting to crash down to $15-$17/share! It is just a matter of time and I am waiting to buy and capitalize on it!
Stock closed $28.80 let’s see how it closes today Monday on the opening drift purchases happen I wonder how high that will be what day is the best time to sell on the opening check it out￼￼￼
How much of our 58 billion do you figure we made back from the direct tv purchase I. Think we should cut the ceo pensions over that bad purcahse
"T is selling all day now low 28.40 divi .52 I have no idea why buy 4000 shares, after div. stock price 27.89(28.41-.52) sound good to me on top of it T have good business ."
One of my children just dropped T for another competitor’s plan.
cnn out of control / liberal haters of Rush slandering his name on this post N0 comment from T mgmnt
This is only my opinion but I do believe most of the rumors about Michell Obama killing and eating those three homeless men in Washington DC.

"Not easy to overcome a 600 pt loss on the dow, lets see what happens on a better day."
"Oh look, the sun came up.....that is how I knew T was gonna be red today, hahah."
31.50+. Next week
"What happened to ""T will never see $29 again""?"
As long as the divi yield stays around 8% there's not much of a downside left.
"If you want in the 23 and me going public it's going to happen under VGAC and Wall Street SMACK the SPAC to shake out the weak hands today MAN the DEM wits are just giving away their shares , Wall Street scared the shares right out of them . LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Today Verizon has a market cap of 242b, T's cap is 218b...this is the biggest abstract as T has twice the assets of Verizon, 4x the amount of fiber in the ground, a satellite network and the largest media content library in the world.T will match Verizon in the 5G space at a minimum, they're fully invested to the future and the stock will shine in 2019 and then launch upward in 2020. Book it, bank on it...collect shares now while they're cheap...Asset value alone is huge and potentially a target by many..."
"T is up again, hmmm maybe the Godzilla vs King Kong movie reviews are coming in better than expected...lol"
"Hey guys, I’m new here. Merrill is showing $2.08 dividend. However, I read that T is giving $0.52 in dividends. What does that 2.08 mean on Merrill?"
AT&T is getting sued for 1.5 billion dollars. could not happen to a nice deserving company
This was at $45 before 5G was in picture this will be over $50 within 60 days
"Don’t worry, it will fade, it always does. Buying T before 1pm is a good way to lose half a dividend rofl"
Might be another tick coming in. Wait for it.
"Bullish on this stock for sure, the current valuation of AT&T given the assets owner by the firm is outrageously low. Given AT&T’s forward-looking strategy of diversifying into digital streaming through HBO. As the business grows and becomes a larger component of the firm’s revenues, we can expect a great valuation multiple on AT&T due to comparables like Netflix and Roku. Future outlook is strong."
Hi $30; welcome soon $40.
"All of yesterdays gain gone. Sell the news just like I said. Earnings, Results etc.. are for the birds.. means nothing to the stock."
"It's becoming evident that your media darlings, CNN (and NBC), played a role in inciting the Jan. 6 violence at the Capitol by hiring an ANTIFA leader to stir things up. He is on tape calling for violence in the Capitol itself. Still love CNN?"
Doe the POTUS control oil prices? It is moving up fast! 1% a day!Int rates blasting up too.
Must be T cheerleaders here. Been flat for years. Nothing going for this dog except dividend
"I sure hope T closes above $28.50 next Friday so I won't be forced to buy actual shares with the Puts I sold. I don't want to own this stock, I just want to sell monthly Puts. Right now the Feb 26 $28.50 Puts are selling for .69 each and the $29's for .92 each. That's by far the best way to make money with T."
Management needs to correct the perception problem T has. If you put the name Disney on this company the stock price would be double. Only management can change how the street views this company. It is time for the StankMeister to earn his pay and change T's image.
"T is turning into a platform company and away from a commoditized product company. This alone should double the ""PE"". Buying under $30 is a gift. $40+ in 2021."
This is real news the justice department is appealing but a judge has already approved the merger. I’m curious to find out the Basis

Looks like a food fight today between the buyers and the sellers. LOL
Put it right where T likes to go RED....
Dropped to #19 in Valuelines dividend portfolio
Well.....Timmmmmber Tuesday.......Woeful....Wednesday !
HBO Max is a gold mine
Incredible Buying Opportunity! Buy Buy Buy!!!!
The markets are at all time highs but where did T go? - down!! Earnings beat and it drops. What would happen if the market crashed 40 percent? Right! No doubt T would plunge to new 52 week lows!
"Dividend stocks are dead. Nobody wants a 2-3-5-7 % yield when growth stocks can make that in a day. T is a great company with good assets, but why pay a dividend when the balance sheet is disgusting? If the cut the dividend for a couple of years, pay down the debt and do buybacks, thanks to HBO and a clean balance sheet T could easily be a 350-400B company and THEN is when you pay a dividend. It's honestly pathetic how bad the dividend is hurting the company and limiting the potential of the company while seeing all the boomers in this chat room praise it. SAD!"
"6,500 shares and counting."
Elliott bought T....
Is the civil war starting?
"the old 'network error' ploy. yeah, okay"

"The bigger the resistance, the bigger the break through."
"You want $2000 check which Mitch is holding back, you vote DEM in Georgia elections."
How it feels to be a passenger on $T watching management fiddle on a sinking boat

"a lot of shorts covering, including mehave a safe new years"
"with ex-dividend date coming up Jan 8th, and divy at 7.25% while the Treasury is close to 0%....kind of like this timing. Maybe even some call options."
"Wow, the OTC market is on fireSRMX ... 5G iOt play ... not too late to get in but the train is leaving fast"
Why do I feel the low 20s in T stocks future? Why does it feel inevitable?
"Ex dividend is coming the week of April 5-9 2021 Get ready to say OH NO up T goes , Just place long term sell orders for all your shares for any higher price you want . Anything over $60 is a good price to start. But you higher price will do , Lets the shorts know they can not have your shares to cover with."
Here is a link in regards to HBO Max's strategy to attract subscribers through more family content. https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287816/hbo-max-kids-content-shows-competitors
I hope it tanks to $8.00 could care less. Not attached to the stock. Then I would back up the truck to add more.
"Dead money, going to test $20 or lower before 2022. Very bearish outlook ahead."
Buy order in at 33.33
Buy the S&P 500 and enjoy another 50% gain in the next 2 years with the FED's printing press running full bore.
Something is wrong here and it's called stock manipulation! Either that or it's CNN! Lol!
Volume hasn't been this low since Xmas eve day when the market closed early. Seems many are not willing to sell before the earnings release.
"Disaster.... Transaction values DirecTV at $16.25 billion — a dramatic decline from the $48.5 billion that AT&T paid to acquire the pay TV provider in 2015,"

good thing I didn't listen to one of the cheetahs and go all cash. market timing is a fools game.
Option sellers don’t want to lose out so keeping it under $30
"Established 1/2 position @29.22, waiting for earnings reaction to gradually fill the remainder. In my dividend portfolio anticipating a 10%+ annual total return over the years with an eye on the free cash flow to adequately fund the payout."
"AT&T is a great  Company period! If you don't like them than just go away!!! Most of these comments are from Short Hedge funds and others are from disturbing individuals who are ridiculous and miserable . Meanwhile, AT&T is supporting jobs and pays a very healthy Dividend."
The Dow dropped rapidly. Someone must've miked joe up.
"I love the corporate speak in their news release ""optimum use of resources."" I'm impressed and these people are paid millions per year for this tripe."
"Good game so far if you're a Tampa fan. I picked Tampa because I'll never bet against Brady again but I do believe the Chiefs will stage a comeback in the second half and the game will ultimately be decided by one or two make it or break it plays. If the Buc's defense can hold up against the Chiefs in the second half the Bucs will win, if they can't they'll lose. I'm just guessing, let's see if I'm right."
"P keeps moving higher I'll keep rolling the Covered Calls out further and to higher strikes to bring in more premium and to raise the strike price higher. You don't have to get your shares called if you don't want to. You can just keep rolling them further out and higher and bring in more money while you're doing it. And to answer another question that someone here is sure to ask. Yes, I will get the dividend for BP if I still own the stock on ex days even though I sold Covered Calls on the shares."
"If you can move your TSP to an IRA do it why you still can and before they change it so you can't . The US Treasury is now holding the money for 3-5 business days from the time they take it out of your account before they sent it to your bank , Joe and his DEM wits of destruction playing with your hard earned money . You just can not make this stuff up ."

We are about to close and a penny into the 30’s. Will it hold??
We have all been anticipating the judge's decision......what happens if either losing side files an appeal? How long will that overhang the merger? We could be in this same position for months and months.
"6% dividend, avg. analyst 1-yr price target of $37 is about 15% capital gain. That is 20% gains, nearly risk free. T is a great buy at these levels. Only in America...."
cases are higher cuz hospitals get more money from taxpayers for covid patients. Die in a hospital and coroner says c19 cause of death.
Focas on Nokia. There is a good possibility ATT will purchase Nokia by this summer.
"if you think about it, an argument can be rationally made, that if the fears of corona virus becoming widespread in the U.S. were to materialize, that actually the services that T provides, where people can communicate /video conference/ text with each other, as well as entertain themselves , and use the internet for a variety of purposes without direct physical contact with other humans, such that T's business/ profits etc would increase , not decrease. then the stock moving down because of the fear of corona virus is not logical.I am not selling my shares, lol"
Does anyone see T as a recovery stock as we slowly come out of this pandemic?
Me thinks T will touch $30 again tomorrow... Will wait and see.
This stock is a CD. Why is anyone watching it everyday.
Touched $30 and couldn’t stand it. Back to $27-29.
I'm issuing a 60 target
Can't even get to 30 anymore before it is hammered lower. Even if HBOmax has a blowout quarter this stock is hated so much it won't make much difference. Hope I am wrong.
One step forward three steps back!
"Heres why the stock market won't go down more than 10%. The FED and its INFINITE cash will prop it up. In fact the FED right now is dumping billions into the markets by buying bonds. And if a crash happens the FED will buy Stocks directly like Japan. Ponzi Scheme on top of Ponzi Schemes. Thats what the U.S economy is all about.And the trick is to hide these ponzi schemes from everyday Joe Sixpack, which they are doing really well with rigged inflation reports and GDP reports and unemployment reports all designed to fool Joe Sixpack on the street.Thats what Harward and Ivy league schools are for, they teach you how to CON the little guy."
"cheetah, just simply say that in order to sell the puts you talked about that generated 7100 of profit for you that it required setting aside 280k in cash in your brokerage account. that's all. and then acknowledge that if the stock moves lower, you either have to close your short for potentially a loss, or that the stock could get put to you at a price higher than the market price i.e. another loss. i have no gripe w/ your strategy, it's just that you always only tell parts of the story. not cool."
We need an activist on Reddit to talk up T. T is being manipulated to stay low as it is heavily shorted.
"The good news, imo. They wrote down the carrying value of “video assets” by $15 billion. I don’t know what the carrying value of direct tv was but they paid $67 billion for it. So they evaluated the carrying value very recently and during supposed negotiations to sell all or part. THEREFORE, the current market value must be a LOT more than what is bandied around here. Does anybody agree, or are all here too stoopid to understand that."
I'm hope'n for a 'nice move' tomorrow!
Got the dip at $31.80
Spectrum results should be coming any day now. What if T came out on top?
"""Gross proceeds from the C-band auction have smashed all expectations. Proceeds stand at $80.2 billion after 62 rounds.

T’s annual dividend is now 5.5 % or 270% higher than the 30 yr T-bond and 348% higher than the 10 yr T -bond (annual interest rate 2.06 and 1.58 respectively).
Even a day like this T can't move up only up .30 is a joke!
"Folks this is not good ,Dow down 1100 pts. since Creepy Joe has taken over !"

BRIEF-At&T Declares Quarterly Dividend On Common SharesBY Reuters— 2:58 PM ET 09/25/2020Sept 25 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T Loading... Loading... ):* AT&T DECLARES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON COMMON SHARES* SETS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.52PER SHARE Source text for Eikon: Further company coverage:
"With recent announcements from Apple, and Disney, about streaming services to come online in the next year there is no chance T will lose the lawsuit."
Jobless claims nearly 1M. Time for the FED to print even more. YES!!Stock Market is UP UP AND AWAY.
"Short market day tomorrow. I think we close at 1:00 EST. Looking for a close above $28.50 for the Puts I sold to expire worthless. If it closes below $28.50 the stock will get ""put to me"" and I'll have to pay $28.50 for the shares. If that happens, I'll sell the shares on Monday, hopefully near, at or above $28.50.No problem if I have to take a few cents loss on the shares because I previously sold the Puts for .88 per share. I still want to be all Cash before the Jan 5 Georgia election in case the Democrats win and right now, with the Republican Senate turning down the $2000 Covid relief checks, they may just pyys enough Georgians off to screw up the election. If we end up with a Democratic President, House and Senate, I'll likely sit it out for awhile to see how things shake out but in my opinion, the market will drop big if the Dems win."
Will continue to add T every chance I get and hold 10 years min for the dividend alone!!!
"Revenue growth will come once people go to the movies again & there is a regular movie releases. Warner Brothers revenue declined 10% year-to-year due to loss of movie/ad revenue. Its simple math. Comps will be much easier going forward. In the meantime, HBO Max will appease investors. Very low-risk buy under $30."
Yay time for another fake Elliot bump to cash out at 34
"Hey AT&T fcvk bags.You have a couple of quarters left to make a dividend increase. No matter how small, you better keep that aristocrat status.You do not need another negative headline."
100 buck bet closes below 30...any takers?
Cheetah is a hedgie trash talking T for his own trading purposes spreading disinformation.
How is it that there is a chip shortage. Its not as if the car industry is booming because of covid. hmmm.... something is not right here.
The only people who should be holding T are retired or dividend investors. This stock will never budge from 25-35
"Look at the price movements T holders.Says all you need to know. More low, lows ahead!"
"Big advertising revenue for March Madness. TruTV, TBS, TNT all owned by AT&T. Games being shown on all those channels. That was completely missing last year."
"I'm going to cut my T position by 80%I feel that the stock will drop to around ~$27.80 before it reaches $30.00I might be right, I might be wrong but I don't like the fact that T are in $190B debt and continuing to take on more debt.Definetly a solid company but I'll buy back in I deem the price fair for me."
Could it be that word is finally leaking about HBO Max subscribers beating expectations by a good amount? Me thinks something's up...
Won’t be long before smaller companies like Zoom etc will pass T’s market cap and can leverage share price to possibly acquire T ...T’s management hasn’t a clue as other dynamic companies are passing them by.
Breakout for T is at $29.23. Resistance at $30.08.
I like $T. It’s not perfect. But I like it. Trading at a lower multiple than T Mobile and Verizon. Trading at a far lower multiple than all streamers. They have critical infrastructure impossible to replicate. They have a jewel in the media landscape. A bit of reversion to the mean and a bit of growth sends this on its way to 50.

"So Phil, is the attack on Cuomo still a political hit job? Hard to keep up w when to believe the woman. Oh, right when she accuses someone u don’t like."
"T-Mobile CEO all over CNBC and the talk shows, trashing T. Meanwhile, Stankey hides and does nothing to promote the company and stock. Now is th etime to be gushing all over HBO Max & the change thats happening. Instead, the narrative is being written by all the negative articles and analysts. Do your job Stankey!"
"The U.S is a country with a younger population, now that covid has taken care of the 65+ old people. Don't want those people around being a burden to the health system."
T is under quiet accumulation. Short term target (1-2 months) - $36. Longer term target (by year-end) - $39.
"HBO MAX launching in all Latin America in June then launching in Portugal,Central Europe, Spain and the Nordics later this year can give a huge push to their subscribers"
"Here's what I don't get. I understand the concern about the size of the national debt but Congress spends so much money on things like museums and loans to other countries yet they can't spend another $1400 on every American who is suffering because the government won't let them get back to work. And at the same time every Congressman is still getting paid, living in their plush houses and not worrying about how they're going to buy food for their family next week. And now Cuomo and DeBlasio are bickering about who should get the virus shots which is delaying the distribution of the serum. Is it any wonder why people are so upset about things?"
"stock looking for four up days in a row,can it happen? problem is down day and selling comes in late everyday. I smell something cooking!"
Down premarket! Of course. Dead money!
Should amaze people how 40 million shares of this stock trade everyday and it literally goes nowhere 
"This is probably the last window to pick up T sub-$30. It's been trading at generational lows for a year. I feel fortunate to have picked up shares at $27 and $28.50 a few weeks back, and preferred T-PA last week."
His question and answer program was cut off yesterday because his handlers were afraid of what he might say.
This stock never stays below $30 for long. Next target $32-$33 in the short-term.

I have an honest question... I am about to refinance my mortgage around %2 interest.... and can cash out 200 thousand to invest all to T for long term. Would this be a wise decision? Please advise.....
Up volume is exceeding down volume. Always a good sign.

"I'm a shareholder but I've got to say AT&T has the worst customer service and Loyalty Department I've ever run into:Been a loyal customer as long as I can remember and I approached them in December for 10MBPS internet service from my existing 6mbps. I wanted to try streaming TV to save some money. They agreed to a loyal customer price of $40 for the first year after which it would raise to $60. Since then my bill has been $49 and I have contacted them monthly with out email written agreement. Today contacted again and was pushed up to a manager. Then to the loyalty department and was finally to they could give me the $40 monthly but would have to downgrade me to 6mbps. That was that. I know $9 isn't much but it is the fact that they told me what I would get for a set amount and didn't live up to it. I'm retired and live on fixed income so try to be a frugal as possible. I don't throw my money away. I also stand by my word. They don't. They don't have to. I did tell them I finally understand why the DOJ was pushing against the merger. They are not the old AT&T I once knew. I paid the $49 immediately but will be looking to find a new provider after my scheduled heart surgery (aortic valve replacement, aortic aneurysm repair and bypass)"

We always get hyped up over tiny gains that follow with big losses. I’m tired of it. Div doesn’t offset
"The big question for me is how safe is the dividend. I am a 7 year T long and obviously not happy about the price of the stock, but certainly happy about the DIV and thinking of adding more T now at these prices..."
"Cheetah, just looking at others in there space and their market caps compared to T’s over the past few years.The numbers don’t lie...They’re looking at T in the rear view waving see ya!"
We better do something right. Dividend is nice but I wonder what Musk is going to do with all those satellites  he’s putting up  into space. I think he will be coming after our type of business or at least competing with use. We will see.5 year's I say for the time period.GL

"GG owns Berkshire. A shares. So I read. This is what the old man wrote this year:""Recently, I learned a fact about our company that I had never suspected: Berkshire owns American-based property, plant and equipment – the sort of assets that make up the “business infrastructure” of our country – with a GAAP valuation exceeding the amount owned by any other U.S. company. Berkshire’s depreciated cost of these domestic “fixed assets” is $154 billion. Next in line on this list is AT&T, with property, plant and equipment of $127 billion.""As Buffett said, that fact alone is not an investment triumph. But the replacement costs here are fairly high."
hopefully good news on earnings front. don't want to see a hit like VZ got today
"take advantage of the dips in T and make sure to pick up a few more shares the next great run higher has started it will be slow and take time but you will get paid very well to wait in dividends . That run to $65 is in play this time and the break out to all time highs , Why because T has made the changes to the company to make it a much better company in the future and the 5G monster T has built is going to grow again"

"AT&T Inc. (T) stock fell 26% in 2020, closing the year within 22 cents of the last price traded in December 2018. Of course, the perennial laggard AT&T is a special case, saddled with years of debt accumulated by poorly executed purchases that include 2015's disastrous DirecTV acquisition. The company also overpaid for Time Warner in 2016, but that bet could eventually pay off, with the new HBOMax streaming service growing at a healthy pace."
Ah ha... Final closing price $29 just as I predicted.
Looks like we open above 30. Will it hold??
IF T could stay flat at 30 just not go under 30 don't believe anybody would really care if itgoes higher or not30+ safe dividend in this market? ok with me

"HBOMAX Value has been doing well for months now. T did not, and has not participated."
this merger is putting t into the drivers seat. so many great things they can do and they dont need to depend on anyone else as they just got dealt a great hand that will win big time. all the other companies now got to figure out what they need to do to stay relevant.
"T is the best and most predictable stock to trade. In the first 27 trading this year, I have increased my share count by 159 free shares. These shares are only from selling T high and buying back in the same day at a lower price. Hence adding an ave 5.88 shares a day to my total. I have increased my yield from 7.67% to 8.26% already this year. Lowered my AVE PPS from $27.10 to $25.18."

AT&T would have hard time selling ice to someone in you know where.
One thing you can ALWAYS count on is T underperforming. Only a hack dividend investor would buy this.
If ATT cut the dividend to zero and used the $15Billion per year that they pay for dividends to buyback stock shareholder value would increase. Some of the people that hold the stock for dividends would sell but T could buy those shares. Other investors that want growth would buy T just like they buy TMUS with zero dividend. I can't help thinking that $15B per year could be the thing that is holding ATT back along with 7.1 billion outstanding shares. What would happen to TMUS if they declared a 7.3% dividend? Most of the thumbs down will come from short sellers because they do not like large buybacks.
It's a Dividend play. Buying Opportunity and very undervalued. Strong Buy with a $41.00 price target. We feel it's a good place to put your $ to work.
"Tesla goes up and down $1 every 3 seconds. When T does it, it feels like a miracle has just occurred."
I am listening to my analysts who feel it's going higher so that being said it's a Buy and Hold.
T stock is in a strong downward trend. Question is how low can low get? I figure the stock just went ex-dividend and due to historic trends should hit a bottom around late March excluding any of the numerous other factors that may come into play.
Say goodbye to 30 calls.
AT&T added 4M HBO streaming subs. Disney added 21M. Let that sink in. Why is Stankey still around?
Don't get too excited. This is not a huge catalyst for AT&T. They will remain a majority owner of DTV.
"T will go back up to $40 regardless of the Time Warner decision. If AT&T gets approval, it will be very exciting and hopes for great synergies and growth potential will be injected into the stock. If AT&T loses.......Then Stephenson will be fired or will resign, and hopes for fresh new leadership will be injected into the stock. This is a win-win situation. :-)"
"I am not looking for desired effects as morningstar would put it. We are looking for the ""Wow"" factor........T needs to do more marketing to attract more people to HBOMAX! They missed the ball on Wonderman, they should have more than tripled on such movie! They are doing the same exact mistake with the new Denzel Washington Movie! They need to advertise the new Games of Thrones show aggressively! They own an bunch of channels, it should cost much, I understand losing some advertising dollars will payoff GREAT DIVIDENDS to the Company longer term. Someone, Please speak to the board and Management of such mistakes. I also believe AT&T box, can kill Roku and replace DTV! This company has too much potential and great opportunities but they are scared to make moves! Look at DIS, they took very bold moves and were successful, I have no doubt this can be even a getter success, if they just simply execute more boldly and not worry. until management gets it act straight, just keep collecting dividends."
Wanna hear some great news? There is another round of 5G bandwidth auction coming. lol
This is the safest play out there when the market comes crashing down
Usually add under $29 but w spectrum auction and fact position has grown as % of portfolio has me hesitating
Boat anchor of a dividend dragging T down again. To bad the retirees wont let T compete as DIS and NFLX (neither pay a penny in divs) rockets to all time highs with tons of new content for streaming. They wont be around in 5-10 years so they got to bleed T dry while they can. Greedy old people. Good Riddance
I just rolled the Jan 29 Puts I previously sold on three other stocks I'm trading to the Feb 26's and picked up another bundle of cash. They all report earnings next week like T and I'd like to avoid that minefield. Unfortunately the Jan 29 T Puts that I sold aren't in position to do the same as of yet. Hopefully the spread will widen before the ER next Wednesday and I'll be able to roll them forward for another good profit. Keeping an eye on it but we'll see what happens.

"Story about AT&T. Wife worked for SW Bell back in 1989 stock was $99. Company had given her 7 shares before she was laid off 2 years after starting. Merger of ""Baby Bells"" SW and AT&T stock split 2 for 1 now $45 then back up to $99. She remember 3 splits. Held those shares still today. Now she has 1000 shares and gets $2300 year dividends reinvested the dividends all these years into repurchase toward shares and has never touched any. I just bought 1000 more shares yesterday since it will start substituting our retirement starting next month..Even though splitting seems to be a thing of the past these days it was golden for her. Oh and she had 2 years of College paid for upon layoff..... went back to school got her degree and had a successful 30 year career as a programmer..True story.... moral is .... AT&T solid company."
Will today be the day we retake the 29 level?
Look at the hit the market is taking today!
This looks to be a good buy at $28.33 and a good sell at $28.83
Don’t sell hold it for a week will go over $33
"The talks about breaking up Ma bell were first presented to AT&T in 1982 by the government. There was only one phone co. before that, and they use to take care of all your phone needs. If your phone broke down they would replace it free of charge. You new people know nothing of how it was. Then the government got their hands in, and everything started to get screwed up."
"Despite the 15 billion write down, DirecTV still has 17.2 million customers and revenue of 7.2 billion for the quarter. (about 1/6th of AT&T's total revenue) Also when you write down an asset it improves the earnings in subsequent quarters because of less depreciation and amorization expense on that asset."
Is this the company that owns the most reliable name in fake news?
What a......lol
Worst Stock on Earth will continue to go downhill to below $20. Very Bearish outlook ahead.
"Back to $28 this bum goes, T is a disaster."
"Does ATT'S board, (13 members), hold virtual meetings?My guess is probably NOT!"
They’re un relentless racism alone is enough to sell this un American company.
"more T bad news:“ There are risks involved with investing in AT&T. The company has accumulated a ton of debt attempting to turn itself into an entertainment giant. That strategy hasn't exactly been a home run. AT&T had $153 billion of debt at the end of the third quarter, and it's been losing premium TV subscribers at an alarming pace. The company has been trying to sell DIRECTV, which it acquired in 2015 for $49 billion, but bids so far are reportedly around $15 billion.”"
"I just read a post from motley throwing in the towel on T.. I agree that while T is servicing the debt, it probably won't see any big moves up. However, I do think that present management is moving in the right direction.. So let see, I throw in the towel because T is not moving up fast enough, I lose the 7+ div and I need to find another investment to replace it with that hasn't already shot up so high it's ready to pop, not an easy thing to do at this time. I'm going to stay long with T ...."
Stock market will continue to grow as long as interest rates stay low.... Stocks will get slammed to the ground within one second after the interest rate is raised... Goldman Sachs will push the sell button and computerized trading will wipe out 10 years worth of gains... You won't have a chance to react..
Don’t sell your stock cheap! Thanks @R
another week of opex manipulation by wall st!!!
"the dividend will get cut. There are great dividend stocks out there, this isn't one of them."
T is a growth stock! Once USA economy recovers from Pandemic T in 30's all the time. Earnings January 26th should be interesting. Divided payment .52 February 1st! Long T!!!
Feels like I’m waiting for the end of day sell off. Hope we can close green.
you never lose value of spectrum when it is used for 5g..... this is a money maker deal... increased revenue!!! 26 billion in cashflow.... they can use dividend cash to pay or DTV sale and loses to offset the gains.. its all a tax game at this point...hoard the loses until taxes go up!! no brainer.... earnings will be up

Both VZ and T Mobile are playing the spectrum game which is a Commodities business which is just going lower and lower in price , T is now leveraging it's assets to drive margins and that is a game that only T can play , The FACT is the Government let T build a monster that no one company can compete with in the new world they all face. LOL,LOL,LOL"
T is brilliant! CNN is positioned to become the main propaganda machine for the Harris administration! Think of the money!
"T is a sell,,,,within one year this company will take the largest write off in accounting history relating to Time Warner.

"no way would i hold anything in this environment.no f'n way!not with all this debt!!cash out, go into ""dont lose"" mode"
AT&T's CNN should consult Project Veritas for lessons on how to become journalists.
"Own T don't trade it by more now on any DIPS. Have that dividend locked in as T goes higher and higher . Started buying IPOE which is taking SoFi public in April 2021, was almost $30 and now dropped to the point to start picking up shares and locking them up with long term sell orders over $100 to start. Massive upside in the future as it takes business from all the large Banks . The new world of Banking SoFi Number 8 on the list of major disrupters"

"Motley Comments:Management expects to exit 2020, a year hindered by the pandemic, producing $26 billion in free cash flow. Despite the 7.3% yield -- or $0.52 per share per quarter -- the free cash flow payout ratio is only 58%. Yellow flags are flying after the company didn't raise the dividend in the first quarter for the first time since 2003, but Stankey reiterated on the latest earnings call that there was plenty of cash for investments in capital and content, paying down debt, and maintaining the dividend. Increasing the payout isn't off the table either. As long as management raises the dividend by the fourth quarter the streak of consecutive yearly increases will grow to 37 years, maintaining its status as a Dividend Aristocrat. If management can stay on plan, the payout will likely rise and the stock is a buy at the current price."
"cheetah and others.....when you talk about your naked call and put selling, (i assume it's naked b/c you never talk about buying or shorting the stock to protect), why don't you talk about the margin requirements aka the buying power restrictions that result in your account. Another reason i presume you're naked is you don't talk about how your stock got called away or got put to you. So you're always right?? Lastly, if you are naked, you should talk about the likely very small positions you're taking since they're tying up so much buying power in your account. Because while I don't begrudge or judge anyone for making money w/ a certain strategy, I think you mislead non-practicioners of options trading."
Luckily I am at a level and cost average that I do not care for this to churn for a while as I DRIP to accumulate even more (to shed a chunk at a future spike)My free-ed up funds have allowed me to make instant bank on several other runners lately. I feel bad for the ones stuck with overweight shares and/or a high cost averageHope you guys get to a “inner peace” level soon so you can focus on growth options as well.
T will be going sky high soon. When all the lazy American workers are laid off from T mobility and good peoples are brought in on H1B1. This improve T bottom line greatly. Me be laughing so much about this.

Value stocks in favor! Go T!
"Who was it who said he was thinking of selling his higher priced shares earlier and someone else said ""I wouldn't"" Maybe he should have huh? Or at last sold covered calls against those shares. To let thattype of situation pass without taking any advantage of it is almost a sin. I took advantage of the moment by buying the Puts I sold back cheap and I'm going to sell them again when the stock drops lower again."
Janet Yellen: Please pump some money into T; it needs it. I will be getting $3k of so-called Covid Relief that I really don't need.
"The last time T hit 30 was January 7th. If T breaks 30 next week, the big question is can T hold above thirty. There has been a rotation from the highly speculative stocks in tech, alt. energy, and biotech into ""old"" economy stocks with dividends. Let's see if this trend continues."
"I never liked T service, they have #$%$ cellphone plans and no FIOS plans or anything looking to the future. Directv is really dumb when fiber offers 1 Gbit service. We would still be using rotary phones if they had their way. They are not a monopoly anymore, they need to compete. The PUT/CALL ratio shows traders are not optimistic, the dividend protects the stock from moving very fast.Somebody tell me why this company should exist in 10 years."
We’re up a nickel in premarket. We’re on a roll.
"The price action of T is very curious. Talk about steady, not even slow and steady as that would require upward movement of some sort. In a time of heavy volatility this stock has traded in a .50 range since the start of the year for over the past 30 days. I guess this would be called building a base?"
I owned this stock for over 30 years and keep asking why.
I ever tell you all that I love making money off of T. I sold high and bought back in low this morning while picking up a few extra shares. On those shares I am currently up $.55 a share
This is a 40$ stock

Given the damage to our facility it will take time to restore service. We have already rerouted significant traffic from this facility and are bringing in other equipment, including numerous portable cell sites to the area.There are serious logistical challenges to working in a disaster area and we will make measurable progress in the hours and days ahead. We're grateful for the work of law enforcement as they investigate this event while enabling us to restore service for our customers.We'll continue to provide updates here as our recovery progresses."
Keep those dividends coming !
"Here is the math. EBITDA $65B less capex 21, less dividends $14 less income tax 5, less interest 8equals $17B of discretionary cash flow that will pay down debt and thus reduce interest. That gets you to $163B of debt at end of 2019 and a 2.5 EBITDA to Debt ratio. That will provide for dividend increases and stock buybacks. Stock is a solid buy."
"omg, it is fading. Will probably finish red yet again."
"William has been escorted to my MUTED Waiting Room. Eric, Spartan, and Cheetah are already there."
It would build confidence in the investors if the upper management started massive refi of it's 150 billion in debt. Better to do this now when the rates are low... and there are lenders that have liquidity to help.
Why would they release such awesome news when markets close at the end of the week should be going over $31 bucks tomo
T making a come back already?

"macd crossed the signal line on friday and went positive today. also, if it closes above 29.91 it will have broken above about a three mo trading range. i have been faked out by positive chart developments w/ T before, so by no means is this me suggesting these are screaming buy signals. but we are also leading into investor day. it could be setting up for a move, positively positioned and some of the reopening trends (movies) are helping. fingers crossed."
Verizon and ATT invested about $45B and $23B in auction. Has anyone read anything about what kind of return on investment this could produce? Is TMUS ahead of T and VZ in spectrum?
"All the T haters better learn to say OH NO up T goes , Why because T's 5G monster is ALIVE and feeding on the competition LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
Now is the time to buy..... anything but T.
"Just Wall Street ""Lunch Talk"" is AT&T going to $50 with HBO Max and 5G? Maybe $35 but let's keep in a trading range. Everyone on board say it with your beer mugs and wine glasses."
"There are likely two reasons for T to increase:- Yield 7+% (people are now looking at yield, since the move of the 10 year bonds)- Buffet bought into the competitor (to my opinion with worse chart structure and fundamentals)There was bad decision making of T in the past, and it could occure again in the future. But they have certain parts of the business growing that will catch more investors attention over time.That being said: 28.50 USD (good buy) - 27.50+ USD very nice buy - sub 27.00 USD great buy.Just my opinion. I hold shares of T in a portfolio I manage for my partner."
My Disney stock crushed it on earnings for their streaming. Weird thing is it sucks compared to HBO Max....The guidance will be interesting. Tick Tock .....Let's see.
When will it surpass $31.20? Anyone hazard a guess?
"T is not a growth stock, it's an income stock. You buy 100 shares and earn $200 in dividends annually. Full stop."
Has anyone ever seen a company with a dividend rate of return higher than its PE?
Congrats you guys threw away $30 Billion and expect the stock to move up because you acknowledge this publicly now ?
"CLNE~~partners with Chevron, BP, TOTAL. Contracts with New York MTA/Sanitation. FedX, UPS. Canada and USA."
WHOW! Ts on a ROLL!! !!
"They can spend all the money they want on 5g, won’t matter. T is like NOK, a has been. It’s a good stock, if you like losing money."
"Just be glad you don't own VZ because VZ is now losing customers to T by the 1000's everyday WOW VZ is now setting a new record daily of how many customers VZ can lose to T LOL,LOL,LOL Look at all the new T customers we got this weekend WOW"
Those who have held T.....sorry you missed the best bull market in a half a century...I guess you will catch the next bull market...any day now any day....
"I just resold the Feb 26 $29 Puts I bought back yesterday for .17 each but I decided to sell the March 5 $29's instead for a little more premium. Sold the March 5 $29's for .38 each. That's a quick $2100 bucks in ONE day. If the stock closes above $29 on March 5th those Puts will expire worthless and I'll start all over. I'll be selling the March 26 $29's next which are currently going for .70 each. If the pricing keeps dropping towards $29, the March 26 $29 strike premiums will increase in price. And that's how you do it!"
There will be a big push to unlock the stocks value within 6 months. Right now it's best to split out growth because of the crazy valuations vs dividend stocks. We even see the Euro stocks like Mercedes and VW considering ipo's for faster growing divisions. T will have no choice but to spin out HBO at some point as HBO is worth $0 as part of T and $100B on its own.
I'm not finding any news?? for the jump?
Dems will stimulus and spend to accelerate economy to sidetrack u from paying attn while they up your taxes.
Looking good here folks. Watching closely.  today might be the day
c n n finally talking about gov cuomo......he belongs in the chinese govt.....with the rest of the liars
"Wow, look at that BP go!! I'd expect some profit taking to hit the stock soon. This has been a straight up ride and nothing goes straight up forever."
Out of this and got GM.
So I guess these people who are selling and the analysts downgrading the stock wanted AT&T to fall behind in the 5G race? They are all idiots. AT&T HAD TO take away a good portion of that spectrum and they did just that.
Got that divy though.....better off in dirty energy me thinks  Little know fact - The main ingredient in Solar panels is lots and lots of COAL ! 
For that are long T just make sure you have place long term sell orders for all your shares at over $60 to start or any higher price you want for your shares. That way it sends a message to the shorts that they can not get your shares so cheap and if by chance your shares have been lent out and shorted your broker will either have to find shares for you or be forced to recall the shares

Looks like Direct TV sale is going nowhere.The hole is getting wider and deeper.
Thumbs Up if you think T is going to hit $32 before it drops under $30 again or Thumbs Down if you think it's going to drop under $30 again before it hits $32.
Early Christmas present for my son. 300 Shares of T.
 I was just told that AT&T will beat the dropping cable viewership numbers by going into streaming big time. For the first time in history AT&T will own the content and also own how the content will be distributed. DOUBLE WAMMIE!
MIKE MIKE MIKE get a grip.
Am happy with the numbers.
"ATT will be $28 per share 100 years from now... It's like a giant slop bucket for pigs in $10,000 suits..."
Universal Basic Income is a necessity now that the Dems are in charge. Its our money anyways not the Politicians.
Dividend is in jeopardy!
Who are these experts on this board berating people that are long on T? Ranting about how clueless we are for not investing in growth stocks. They don't understand that our portfolios and reasons are diverse. Most of us probably made money on the high fliers and want to put profits where we can generate dividends at a decent rate. T is a minor part of my portfolio and well worth the risk at the price point I was able to buy in at.
"""AT&T is expected to generate ""more than enough free cash flow to cover its upcoming C-Band commitments; 2) keep leverage in check; and 3) maintain the dividend at or above the current level."" C-Band is spectrum to be used for 5G applications."
E-MATRIX MUTED!
"NEVER EVER do any business with a company like AT&T that is willing to take away your right. AT&T has become a Communist company under Han's and his EU one world order CENSORING NATZI's that censor what you can see, read and post. That is about as un-American as it can get."
Boy if I was a shareholder right now I'd be selling March 26 $30 Covered Calls. They're currently selling for .68 each.
This is where you add to your position. Not a lot in case it keeps going down. But a little that way you don't feel as bad about the bags your holding at a higher price. If you don't buy on down days you will hold lots of bags. It hurts seeing money evaporate with the share price. It is a little comforting that the trade volume isn't much higher than usual.
$31 close mark my words
It's like buying T in 1997. Same stock price. Extremely stable Bond like stock.
"The dividend yield on this will be 8% before it is over, it's a train wreck."
"At 2pm, someone dumped over 1 million shares for some tax loss selling. That will end in a few days and the pressure will be off. This will be a nice stock to own for 2021"

"@R so @R went from being a ""Financial Genius"" to an ""Accountant"" then a ""CPA"" telling everyone in Government to sell their TPA shares. Then he comes out now blaming conservatism on Verizon. Now he says Verizon is a ran by a third world country. This guy should be avoided at all costs! His daily lies over on Verizon. Just b/c we have the best Network and his stock never goes ""UP UP UP"" like he says repeatedly throughout the day. His 2000 shares of ""Grandma's Trust Fund"" isn't getting him anywhere. Right, SON!?!"

"Circles the drain again, same stuff different day"
"1600 shares purchased, first time buyer of T. The recent div increase, 3 upgrades in last 2 weeks (JP Morgan, Citigroup, Cowan) and good price point."
"Just how did things get so bad for T? It wasn't all that long ago that T and VZ were almost at the same price in the 40's. Since then, T has fallen down to sub 30 and VZ up up near 60. How does this even make sense? T has way more assets and things going on than VZ. The only conclusion I can come up with is that leadership matters, and the market has absolutely no faith whatsoever in the leadership of T. RANDALL MUST GO!"
I think that it is a matter of time for WBS to come visit since this is a legit hedging for the upcoming turbulent market. Have a strong support at 28 and a high dividend payout.
"The world is so convoluted by humans, I am surprised that we are still around and haven't destroyed ourselves completely."
"T earnings. 4th quarter results on Jan 27th. Expected EPS is $0.73. Prior quarters reported EPS were $0.76, $0.83, $0.84, $0.89. Has been a steady decline in EPS. Revenue also declining. This may explain why majority consensus ""hold"" rating for T and why in a trading range."
"Assuming T ~ dividends are safe but debt increases, spending, and let’s not forget COVID issues, argument over stock buy back could decrease"
Would have been nice to see that gap get filled. Maybe some income seeking funds buy some Monday. I truly feel for y’all on this one. It’s clear cheetah has the best strategy with this stock.

I Strongly oppose selling any part of Direct TV....HBO Max is great but I like and so do my family and friends Direct TV. It's better than streaming and and I do both. If I were on the BOD I would not sell a stake in Direct TV.....It's a valuable asset to AT&T. As a shareholder I have expressed this to Mr Stanley. I'm bullish on AT&T but don't think We should give up on Direct TV.
Half a divy lost today.
"So now the new Pres. is going to give Latin America $4 billion bucks to ""make life better there"" to discourage more migration across the border. What do you suppose are the chances that the $4 billion winds up in the hands of the drug cartels? Hmmmmm, wonder if our new Pres. thought of that."
Tax loss selling to offset gains while this is at lows makes perfect sense... then buy back the shares to regain profits net year...
Added at 28.95. Always down more than dividend. Like clockwork.
My apologies to the late Fred Gwynn for comparing him to John D student Kerry.
T is down 4.3% in the last 6 months. ROKU is up over 200% in the last 6 months. That illustrates opportunity cost.
"Listen to the longs whine! LOL Aren't some of you whiners the same guys who keep saying, ""I bought T for the dividend and I'm going to hold forever. I don't care what the price does"". So what are you people whining about? This is what the price does! LOL"
Voice is free.... Which part of free is confusing?
"assuming the Trump news regarding increasing of tariffs hits the markets hard tomorrow and causes a sell off in T shares, I am planning to look at buying T shares. First of all, T's businesses are shielded from the tariff wars, secondly its bondlike status will help it as yields drop in a flight to quality of the risk off type of market dynamic. Thirdly, I expect that this is just Trump's hard negotiating tactic and will ultimately give way to a deal being struck. If T sells off , it will likely be a good trading entry point. See, I can be selectively bullish on T...……."
Shall we say $29.96 close?
DOW is lower than the close on Dec 31. Not sure what the big fuss is all about with the back and forth nonsense of it shooting up vs T
"The only time T leaves $28/share is when it goes into the $27s,"
Can somebody tell me why AT&T is giving virtually free service to Illegal immigrants? That's unbelievable! And funnier is the homeless people actually just claim homeless for EBT and free stuff and living in Southern California driving Cadillac Escalades and have 5 vehicles and 8 kids fat. AT&T better wise up.
"Periodic Reminder...All things Motley Fool should be ignored. They create hate and fear articles to attract ""clicks"" for which they are paid. They are bloggers, not analysts."
and there he is posting his short interest strategy to one and all......it's purely little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff and his con-artist promotion way of trying to get you shareholders to sell so he can gamble with options when owning ZERO shares.....get it?
Lots of people throwing in the towel today. A complete loss of faith in management.
"T has everything going for it now. Loads of new subscribers on HBO Max and a steady income stream with it's phone infrastructure ""which is being upgraded to 5G as we speak"". This is a 31 dollar a share stock in a month, after the next wave of subscribers flood in! Time to load up."
"since my estate was settled late last year I am now the proud owner of 100,500 shares of ATT.....that's currently a value of $2,857,215.00 with $209,040.00 in yearly dividends....of course that's nothing compared to little tiny pee wee schitzo freak cheeto puff.....even though he owns NO T shares he will be BRAGGING about how much money he makes off his put/call options any second just watch"

Can't pay the dividend without the 14 Billion its trying to borrow it isn't just about the 5 G spectrum folks get out while you can this debt bomb is going to 3-8 once the news of missed dividend gets out
I'm 6 cents away from being in the green on share price. I'm already in the green on profit though with dividend reinvestment.
Time to Back up the Truck Boys and Girls and get you 7% div while you still can.
T is great.
It must be CNN why this is doing so bad!
This is getting hard to watch. I think I will have to do something else today.
not an advice. AT&T price prediction March 21; $38 min. News talking about AT&T more to come. listen up a company who works for their best to increase their potential soon going to be paying us.
Ahhh the 30 minutes to close swoon. I may have to start capitalizing on this trend.
"Argus maintains a $38pt and expects a dividend increase later this year. Synopsis follows:ARGUS RATING: BUY• Reaffirming BUY and $38 target• As expected, the pandemic weighed heavily on AT&T's 4Q results, especially in the WarnerMedia andVideo divisions.• However, the core wireless services business continued to show resilience as work-at-homerestrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vital than ever.• The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in the wireless industry, thoughconsumers may still be reluctant to switch carriers due to the pandemic.• We are lowering our 2021 EPS estimate to $3.19 from $3.27 and setting a 2022 forecast of $3.25.INVESTMENT THESIS We are maintaining our BUY rating on AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) to a target price of $38. The COVID-19 pandemic had multiple negative impacts on AT&T's business in 4Q20,especially on the WarnerMedia and Entertainment divisions. However, the core wirelessservices business continued to show resilience as the pandemic and follow-onwork-at-home restrictions have made communication services and connectivity more vitalthan ever. Based on management's comments, we expect AT&T to face continued revenue andprofit pressure from the pandemic in 2021. While these effects may tail off over time, thefuture is highly uncertain - as reflected in management's weak 2021 guidance. Still, AT&Tcan rely on its strong balance sheet and prudent management as strengths in the currentenvironment. The 4Q20 launch of the iPhone 12 may spur increased competition in thewireless industry, and AT&T has offered an attractive promotion to boost iPhone 12upgrades. Nevertheless, consumers may be reluctant to switch carriers until the pandemicrecedes. AT&T trades at a modest forward valuation premium to peers and at the low end ofthe historical range."
I'm so looking forward to a fact-based science-centric administration.
It looks like T is going to hit its 52 weeks high soon with financial improvement and future improvement to 2025
"How much do they want to borrow? Seriously, they just said they were paying down debt."
$30 tomorrow.$40 next week.I wanted to be the first this week to say it.
All the worst-performing stocks up big except T. Oil stocks - huge runup. Financial stocks - huge runup. T cant even get to $30. Time for new leadership!
I guarantee that we would double in share price if they would announce that CNN was cancelled.
"talk about consistent yesterday market way up T down ,16 , today market down a few points,T down .16, note to self sell at opening tomorrow,worst stock there is"
"Well, how a good nights sleep changes things. Look at all that green. Maybe T stays over 29.00 after all."
25 years with Verizon and switched to att today. Better price by a little but it comes with hbo max. Had a trial period and can’t be without it with all the new releases coming out. I think this is gonna be the case going forward for many Verizon and other users. Probably why they beat expectations for this and it’s only gonna continue as content increases
"l have both HBO and Netflix and I oun 2500 shares of T and no shares in Netflix. I try to find something to watch on HBO , It for me is hard to do despite their bid inventory, so I go to Netflix and have no problem finding so many program's that are really good plus Netflix menu is much better to access. I am 79 yrs old and I have had both for the same amount of time one year..."
29 never againBwahaha!Toooo Funnny
"So much baggage. High debt, expensive spectrum bidding, money-losing direcTV biz, covid crippled WB production biz, high dividend, etc the list goes on and on and never gets crossed out..."
Who in their right mind is selling at these prices? Good God!
Watch what this stock does on Tues. near the close. That will tell you everything you need to know about the earnings report.
imagine if the market wasnt down 2%
"LOL,LOL All the T haters get ready to go higher and higher , Why because T's 5G monster is ALIVE and feeding on the competition LOL,LOL,LOL"
"When T reports on Jan 27, they will show a large increase in HBO Max subscribers which should be positive for the stock price"
If you have to borrow money to pay the dividend then that company is not going to be around much longer
HBO MAX and HBO GO Asia crashed several times today because of the Justice League movie $T gambling so far seems to be working for them
My guarantee stands. $29.99 YES!! I can now touch myself tonight and not break my promise.
There are diminishing dividend returns as the share values peters down .5% a day. I’m reading that T has entered a “oversold” condition. I sure in the hell hope so. An up day or two would be nice.
It would be a 'big plus' if we close above $33 again- a sign of 'things to come'!
T~ said many times T shouldn’t have been able to buy DTV . Could of simply had a bundled marketing program to lure DTV customers. Time Warner another gem . Wanted CNN
"CNN ""facts first""great!"
"Boy, you guys sure like to complain. The stock goes up and you complain that it's not enough. Now you're even complaining about the number of employees T has. What's next, how many sinks are in the wash rooms?"
Young and institutes investors are not into T which has no excitement around it. Faster we learn is good. AT&T's best asset HBO MAX is not able to create any buzz. It's done. Netflix is the king and will remain that way for years to come.
"All green today, except for Mr. T."
"Morningstar has a $36 price target and sees the shares as attractiveI tried to post a summary of their report but Yahoo deleted my postIf you have Schwab, you can see it there"
Established a relatively small position this morning. Picked up 400 shares at $28.19. Was torn about diving in as I like better balance sheets. In the end I decided on a smaller position. Just gotta love that dividend! I know a lot of you are underwater on this and wish you all the best on recouping your investment with nice profits in 2019. GLTA
Today my friends we are not bag holders
"I've been on this board for the past two years, and not once have I contributed anything useful."
Hope T closes at $29 today. Could happen.
Do you know that AT&T￼ has a History of paying a Dividend for 36 years!
Surprise! A dive at the bell. Again!
This is a classic buy and hold stock. Anyone complaining of short term losses should go day trade something elae.
Its starting to move. UP!!!
"Amazing folks think this is a high growth stock, it is a dividend stock. W 5g and HBO max being key drivers it will take some time to move needle. Drip (or if retired live off divy) and just relax"
Time to embrace low $20s. Outlook turning very Bearish.
30+ today?

"If you think T is bad, look at Pfizer.. came up with a vaccine for covid and its stuck in the mid-30's for many years now."
How are you feeling about the earnings report?
Donny please be our next ceo our then we can offload cnn for sure
"So long as the market manipulators keep playing games, AT&T should repurchase shares. It would actually save more money than paying for debt. Even if just 1B a quarter, just to retake ownership of the stock."
“Large minority” stake eh.... kinda like jumbo shrimp I guess
"John Stankey's 1st year as the CEO.I give him high marks for off loading most of Telephone's extra baggage and getting back to the essentials,But! The public perception of ATT needs polishing.He missed hitting a home run by not off loading CNN during 2020.Now, its worth billions less.I say sell it anyway."
"Wow, the whiners are out in force today. I don't understand why you just don't sell if you hate the stock that much."
"High Invest in wireless and fiber sector, debt decrease by not increasing dividend, HBO Max beat expectations even by not being released in Europe. Revenue decline but managment clearly in work of transforming the company. Everything is set for a decent long term."
"T ~ your revenues are worrisome, your debt is massive , spectrum will in the billions . Reasonable to assume an argument of dividends isn’t surprising"
"$40 by the end of the year, $50 by the end of next year, $60 by the end of 2020."
$30 today would be nice

DIS cut its div to ZERO and hits all new highs day after day. While geriatric controlled T will be mired in the mud because the old dont care about the future because they wont be a part of it. Sad its legal for these old people to rob this company blind b4 they die off. :(
Decent volume but seems like it should be 10m by now moving up like this. I’m prepared to drop back a lil so I sold a bit at 30.20. Be happy if it stays but buy more under $30 if it drops again
Did T sell DTV?I can't find any news to that effect.
S&P hitting 4K is judgement day. Crash 2.0
It doesn’t like $29.
Is there a changing of the guard in progress? VZ has always been the fair-haired boy and T the redheaded stepchild. Is that reversing?
"Morningstar says 'T' is on target:Analyst Note Michael Hodel, CFA, Analyst, 24 July 2019 ""We continue to believe AT&T is moving in the right direction. The firm delivered solid wireless results during the second quarter, while Game of Thrones provided a lift at WarnerMedia’s HBO unit, which has struggled to grow amid a carriage dispute with Dish Network. The troubled entertainment segment again outperformed our expectations, balancing pricing and expenses better than we thought possible, contributing to profit growth. Consolidated cash flow was also again strong, enabling another quarter of significant debt reduction. Management increased its 2019 free cash flow projection to $28 billion from $26 billion. This increase was based primarily on the sale of WarnerMedia receivables, rather than any major change in the business, which appears to reflect management’s desire to begin repurchasing shares as soon as possible. We agree that repurchases would add value for shareholders given the current stock price""."
"If T was smart they would spin off HBO. A stand alone HBO is worth $100B. And that's without Time Warner behind it. Just IPO the thing and allow it to prosper. At todays insane prices, it will skyrocket. The smart companies know their brand weaknesses and Mcdonalds shows the way. They IPO'ed Chipolte and held all the millions of shares as it skyrocketed once detached from the hated parent company. T has too many haters, but HBO is a well liked brand with a history of some of the best shows ever made by a non-broadcast network. They can keep the partnerships and free HBO for Cell subscribers and even better - pay a fee for them. T revenue doesn't go anywhere, but HBO revenue grows like crazy. So HBO stock hits the moon and T goes nowhere, but a T stockholder gets the 7% yield of the T stock and a new share of HBO that gives the growth. Too bad they probably can't see how great that would be."
Whole system is broken here. Its all day trading daily here period. Need massive thousands of points sell of in all markets in us period. Wall Street greed only here. This is what happens when a Democrat gets into office. They give away everything in the system period. Working people get nothing period. Democrats are known for this period. THis is why we crash by thousands. Need to raise taxes on corporations here and now. We need trillions that were given away by republicans period. They gave Wall Street massive cuts. We need massive taxes raised on Wall Street by trillions here period. Need to pay up to pay for everying not more massive debt by government period. We tax payers pay for it. Wall Street needs to pay here and now by trillions to make up for last 4 years of cuts/ or no new taxes.
"Dish has some real execution doubters but, if Dish can get some traction they could be the next T-mobile. The DOD actually seems interesting in a possible joint project there. Something AT&T would historically have done. If Dish can make their 2023 build-out comments, Dish’s nationwide open RAN network will become the lowest cost provider. The 5g golden rule: Text, talk & video...all just data. He who offers the lowest cost data wins. It’s a race to the bottom. AT&T’s only saving grace may be owning content (HBO) and advertising. I’m not sure that will offset subscriber losses."
Any buyers if this hits 14 ? I’ve been waiting a year and so far no luck .
I'm sorry for yelling at you but that dude said $40 for AT&T! I believe Goldman Sachs has some great people and I love you. Please answer the phone tonight.
I believe almost half of the voters in the presidential election have a pretty good idea why the Nashville bombing occurred. The answer will never be mentioned on CNN.
Looks like someone wants to make Bat Candy today for Options Expiry. Or a witch hunt whichever comes first...
Anyone has been watching Condor AT&T original series and streaming on their channel (Audience) much better than most Netflex movies. It comes on every Wednesday.
"My grand father said this is a nice boomer stock. Nothing booming so far, unless you mean this crater on the returns on T on my investment overview."

"Barring some big news it looks like we are going to have to get used to shares being range bound between 28-30 for quite a while. Fine by me, I'm not selling as long as the dividend isn't cut and it seems to be secure for now."
Cramer says ATT is to risky. Cramer recommends Tesla. What is more risky a telcom with strong cash flow and possible revenues from streaming PE around 20 or a car company that makes < 500k cars at a PE of around 1500. I hope Elon is able to create all the things he dreams of. They sound very cool but most of the ideas are still vaporware. At current prices which investment has more short term risk?
Another close above $30. Looks like I can have a little pork with my beans tonight

Morning T ~ dish is moving higher two 52 week high days .Telecom is getting interesting
28.30-28.50 or lower is great to add/start a position in my opinion;even a little above is ok. Don't chase too much.
"They should have called it Home Box Office instead of hbomax. The former conveys the idea of many many movies whereas hbomax sounds like a suped up, single channel (hbo). The reason I say that is that I think T is having a problem converting hbo customers who get it over cable to the streaming product. Those customers possibly don’t see they’re getting incremental value. Jmo"

28.73 is breakeven for me. Now in danger of losing principal. Although cap gain would be nice all I want from T is to stay at breakeven and rise in time enough to get back ex div drop each quarter. 7.24 yield is why I'm in T.
We will get dividend paid on 8/1 also. Cheers to T holders.
"Where's the head cheerleader, osulinn, who said $32 by today and $40 near term? I think he also said we're on our way to $60."
I’m in this for the yield. Fcf strong enough to alleviate debt concerns. HBO max should be a growth driver.
Will forever be allergic to $30!
"Everyone has an opinion just like dASS holes they should be aloud to speak , but you just don't have to read them or agree with them , That is what has made America so great giving the right for every dASS hole to speak their own opinion no matter if you agree or not , That is what so many in America has fought for and died for is for you to have the right for everyone to have the right to say their opinion. FACT. Now we have the YAHOO NATZI that are run by Han's and the EU that are taking your right to speak as they censor and only post the ones they agree with. FACT I can see a class action lawsuit in VZ future for censor people right to speak ."
This little c needs to be Muted for his post's.
Hey T...Why dont you start talking up the subs number??!?? This leadership just doesnt get it - period.
"Under 29 and I’m loading the truck! The trading multiples will eventually change to reflect the growth of HBO Max. Check out how that service did with the release of Wonder Woman 1984 a few weekends ago! And there are many more hits to come..Otherwise, new CEO and management look to have their priorities straight, finally. I hope to get more clarity on the removal of non-core assets (Direct TV?) during their investor day at the end of the month and also an update on debt repayment and dividends."
if we close above 29 I will climax

"Right now, I evaluate T as a volatile bond fund. To get this kind of yield from bonds, I have to invest in emerging market government debt in countries like Ukraine or Romania. From that perspective, T offers the stability of a company that provides critical US infrastructure, streaming growth potential and a 100 year operating history. Given current market valuations and a distaste for value, T is an easy buy and hold here."
Futures are up.. T will be down 5c tomorrow. Good luck.
"up 1 cent, we're on our way, Not"
I just brought another 2000 shares. Cheers!
I sold T and bought arkf
Up by a penny. Thanks Phil.
I've read many many articles where people have said HBO Max has better content than Netflix.
"All kinds of positive numbers in that report, 800k postpaid adds vs. 400k estimate, seriously! and all they can talk about is revenue guidance of 1% growth vs. 1.4% estimates, ridiculous!"
CNN losing viewers by 30 to 40 %. Will advertiser's ask for refund or just cancell all together. May mean more chances to buy AT&T cheep cheep.

"Verizon going to present the MVP award. It's OK @R we have you covered, buddy. Wow no T commercials or HBOMax yikes!!"
anybody seeing know why 30000 shares are for sale at $60? expiring at the end of the month. Is anything suppose to happen in that time frame?

"As of Dec 28, Wonder Woman 1984 has earned $85 million world wide which included $16.7 million for it's theater debut in the US on Dec 27. The picture costed $200 million to make. The first Wonder Woman movie, released in June 2017, grossed $821 million world wide.I don't know about you but I don't think Wonder Woman 1984 is going to be the big money maker that many here think or says it is. Not saying that's good or bad, just saying that's how it seems to me."
Not enough shares traded for T to be buying back shares so might have been the shorts. Day traders taking profits off the highs of the day.
"annnnd down again,maybe we can get to 28 today, worst stock there is #$%$"
Hmmm!Kilar is talking WM and HBOMax tomorrow and T moving up ahead of it.Could there be a connection there?
owned t for 8 years 5 t shares collected alot of dividends solid stock. you won't lose money on T.
Load up at these prices while you can
"Name any part of AT&T’s business that is growing. Here’s a company that has more debt than any company on the planet and is unable to retain customers. Yeah I know it’s $15 buck HBO. 5G is T’s biggest nightmare not it’s salvation. Surplus spectrum will be sold to the likes of Amazon and Apple and Goggle. Prepare now for the coming data commodification. Everything T sells is data. Data will become cheap. No company, because of debt, is more at risk. You can thank the former CEO’s and board of directors. Add the liability of owning bias CNN which angers half of America (potential customers) you have maybe hedge funds best short idea. Oh wait it is."
This doesn't happen very often but T has regained the ex-div drop on the same day as the drop. 1 Year after merger completed this will be a $55 stock. Buy now for big capital gain and extremely generous dividend while you wait.
T will not drop any more until after the ex date
The average Bull Market period lasted 9.1 years with an average cumulative total return of 480%. The average Bear Market period lasted 1.4 years with an average cumulative loss of -41%.

"Report out that the House will investigate whether Trump overstepped in the govt's actions vis a vis Time Warner and the Washington Post. I suppose this is the beginning of what we can expect over the next two years. As an investor, and as u.s. citizen, it made me ill to know how the DOJ was being used. It was very hard to find an academic, a regulator or other ""expert"" who supported the DOJ's initial suit and even fewer now with the appeal. I'm a republican and can be even handed in looking at things. But on this matter, it's terrifying to think how the government's power is being used."

The T is definitely not for TOTAL return.

Could it be possible T will close above the 5 day moving average 
We think ATT is one of the most safe stock around. Watch....you get at least 7 percent on your shares.. We have owned during the extreme down market that occurred. Do not bother looking at the share price. Treat this stock has you would a bank c/d (which now pays about 2%. ATT has been around from my Grandmother's day and I am in my senior years. Watch...slowly people will get wise and put there money there for 2-4 years. I am being sincere.... hard times seem to be coming...too much gov. money nowbeing allocated . My question is why would people go back to work when they can get more money than when working. Hold tight this does not look good for us.
Well I'm 100% Cash going into Tuesday Georgia election.

(That's a lot of money when you're selling thousands of Puts.)

"T has done very well in the last couple of quarters, esp the last one, w/ regard to competing in wireless. This tmus dude talks as if they're running away from T and VZ. All three spend oodles on marketing and the churn rates are very high vs other products. If they had a superior network they wouldn't have to compete on price. I guess we'll see about the future and 5g but i believe the wireless world will continue to be dog eat dog and thus i'm glad T has made strides to differentiate itself and produce addl growth options."

"The hat trick of streaming HBOMax-Disney & Netflix can be all yours for under $50 bucks a month. And with TW cranking out movie premieres on HBOMax, most streaming junkies will want all 3. Each bring different content to the screen that we all want; covering all generations and bundled together it seems we have enough to indulge ourselves. Forgive me as I digress..Nothing gives me more satisfaction than streaming the fiction of White House Down with all the politicians paying the ultimate price for their incompetence and stupidly.As for predictions...I see HBOMax blowing away all estimates because of announcing the premiering of TW movies. It’s a bargain coupled with a holiday roll out, and the gifting HBOMax as WW made her debut streaming was a great marketing idea. Finally discounting right before earning I believe was to add as many new subscribers to add as much rosy scenario as T can about HBOMax to earning. GLTA"
"I switched from Comcast to AT&T yesterday, Jan 18 2019. My bill dropped from $ 130.75 to $73.00,, $57.75 monthly saving. Reception speed 30+ Mb/sec is all good to see anything streaming without buffering. Modem with phone hook up included. I am now posting on AT&T modem. Paperless billing."

"AT&T CEO Says No Need to Worry About Generous Dividend -- Market Talk10:56 am ET February 8, 2019 (Dow Jones) Print10:55 ET - AT&T shareholders needn't lose any sleep about a possible dividend cut despite its lofty 7% yield and the company's pledge to rapidly pare the $40B in debt it added when it bought Time Warner, CEO Randall Stephenson says. Speaking to CNBC, Stephenson reiterates AT&T should generate $26B in free cash flow this year, leaving $12B for debt reduction after the company shells out $14B in dividends. He says there's another $6B-$8B in the pipeline from asset sales. Add that to the $9B it repaid last year, and AT&T will have repaid 75% of the Time Warner debt by the end of 2019, Stephenson tells CNBC.

Well good news. If value is now up to 16.25 and they sold 30% means ~4.875b sale.
"Fox News correspondent Charlie Gasparino reported that the pending TMUS/S merger could provide stronger competition to fight Huawei. As I understand it, TMUS/S are service providers, whereas Huawei is a supplier of network infrastructure products. If so, how can TMUS/S compete against Huawei? It seems to me that the real competition for Huawei, as it regards US carriers, is between Huawei and Ericsson and Nokia. What have I missed?"
"What would it do to T stock price if they decided to stop the dividend and put the roughly $15 billion per year to pay down debt? Let's say they also use the majority of the $43 billion cash flow for the next 2 years to pay down debt. How would the stock price react to the debt being paid down by roughly $50 billion per year - $100 billion in 2 years? Add in a possible Direct TV sale and maybe you can pay off $120 billion in that time. It seems the main anchor is the debt for T stock, how much do they need to shed before the market values them higher? I know they need to show some revenue growth as well, and I'm confident that will come over the next few years."
I am personally upgrading T to a strong buy!

"That's right Mr. Market, I will not sell my shares to you for the next 10 years."
"Based on today’s drop for T, this stock is what it is, a dividend only play in the $28-$29 range unless 1. Good earnings report on Jan 27th 2. HBO MaX total subscriber count has increased to at least 20 million 3. T management is serious about selling DTV. Not increasing the dividend this year is also concerning some investors although 7% plus dividend is still an excellent return."
Will they pin T at 29 for today's options expiration?
if this deal falls thru and stock doesn't recover thru earnings or buyback. ....Stephenson has to go
The immediate reaction will likely be down because of the DEBT word. The outlook is what matters.

"Ex-dividend tomorrow. T is green and that's good. Yesterday VZ got about a $.75 pop going into its ex-divy dat today. I own both, a lot more VZ. Hopefully streaming and Time Warner E pay off. I have to say after the failed attempt to acquire TMUS with T losing a $4 bil escrow to TMUS and after the Directv fiasco, I am very glad the old CEO is history. He grabbed for the biggest deals he could do to buy cash flow, I hope he was right about Time -- at least in range."
T getting pumped on CNBC.
Should head to $32 by summer easy
T's growth will come when they start doing their targeted ads.
"For anyone frustrated with the price, T was $30 bucks 2 years ago, 10 years ago and 20 years ago so the current price shouldn't be much of a surprise. News or earnings don't seem to affect the price so you can probably expect a lot of the same for the forseeable future."

"Was stuck in the $28-$29 range and now progressed to the $29-$30 range. With the drop today, the yield went back over 7% so I bought some more shares. If T continues to add cell customers, HBO Max customers, and movie theaters start to increase capacity as the COVID virus decreases, I can see over $30 per share price even if dividend drops to 6% range."

Compare with T that went from 34.76 to 28.70 in that same 5 years, a drop of 6 bucks. Adding 5 years of $2.04 divy, ur up a tot of about 4 bucks. What would u rather have? A win of 4 bucks or a win of $111 not counting apple divy?"
would it been wise to buy T yesterday or today so you can get that 52 cents divident ? or am i wrong . any ideas please thank you

Just live off the Divi."

Remember the movie Its a Wonderful Life that George Bailey squares off with Mr. Potter as the Great Depression occurs and the stock market crashes. George ends up the richest man in the world and Mr. Potter doesn't get the Bailey Savings and Loan association.

And that goes for so many other companies that have been beaten up mercilessly. The market is on sale and now is an opportunity in the making of a lifetime......Will you be smart enough when everything looks awful to act?

Maybe the FED will buy some T shares. Only way for the stock to go up.
"A guy died and whether you liked him or not, some of you people can't even be civil with your remarks? What the heck have we become and what's happened to our once great country?

"I am from the old Bell System, I never sold a share of ""T"", I never do dividend reinvestment. I save the very generous dividends to build up cash to buy more ""T' on the ""big-dippers"" which on the very long run gives a ""Super-Return""."
"on a positive note, the dividend yield improves every business day. Yearend we have a 50% dividend yield with the heading of the share price."
Lots of unusual hype on reddit for 3/5 calls for 30c and 30.5c looks like it’s going to be headed that way. Someone knows something that we don’t
hang in there the last day for tax loss selling is tomorrow. now's the time to buy oversold stocks like this one. stocks that get hammered during selling season almost always outperform in the new year.

"Options are definitely pointing bullish...open interest on June 15's, calls - 507,602, puts - 346,544, call-put ratio 1.46.It could be different at other expiration dates, but this alone is very telling."
"This is too great a discount, esp now that T's multiple should reflect at least a portion of the multiple of a content company. Even if you got it up to a 10x, that's about a 3 pt pop in the stock. As of January 7, AT&T has a forward PE ratio of 8.64x for fiscal 2019, and its estimated PE ratio for fiscal 2020 is 8.49x. The forward PE ratios for Verizon, T-Mobile, and Sprint are 12.03x, 17.07x, and 113.24x, respectively, in fiscal 2019."
"This time, AT&T will go up to $60...I think we hit $32 on thursday."

This is a $40 dollar stock and it will get there anytime now
@TEX and his buddies have excellent strategies. Chime in with your strategies as well
"Meanwhile, my ZM ""Zoom"" shares up 70 points just today including after-hours....I am shocked T is so undervalued. SMH!!!"
"I own both... Cramer is Cramer .. always trying too hard to find us a bull market, right?.... hahaIn 2019 Cramer pumped T ever chance he got with his thing on how to read charts... in short ... The charts person he quoted said “T was a great buy because of the chart indicated a buy low senecio”... because timeline is hard to do when it comes to buy low sell high........ However it Never did do much.... I think it is was $37.00 or so during the episode....... and that was a buy point based off the historical charting of the lows...As for Verizon, it did start a down trend towards the end of 2020... So its very easy to call the ball on VZ going up...However Buying T under $30 is very smart and Cramer should be pumping it now... but Cramer will not pump T again until it’s above $35 or even above $37.00..... Cramer is very good at creating bag holders.... sometime he’s spot one.... HOWEVER, I never foolishly follow this guy... That said 9 out of 10 times, I owned his stock pick way before he pumped it up....So just do your own home work on this...... Find your own bull market....... Because either T and/or VZ can and should always be good paying dividends stocks for long term holders .......despite Cramer pumps and dumping opinions about either T or VZSomething to consider ...... 10k in a savings account will make you $0.17 per month .... The same 10K investment in T will make you around $30.00 a month.... Hmmmm...... that’s roughly 200 times as much before taxes.... no brainer ... right?"
Downward sloping trendline back to last june.It sits at 30.50 currently.Thats only 1% from here.If we break that we'll be on our way.
"Tell ya what, give me 30 bucks and I'll give you 53 cents every qrtr."

you won't lose money on this stock and the dividend is so sweet.

Below is what bots trade off.
"For all of you who keep saying T is getting dragged down by CNN, you're barking up a wrong tree if you think CNN is holding T back. Half the country loves CNN so how does that wash with your argument? Stop making excuses for T. T is being held down by T."
Whens the dividend announcement coming?
"Thank Heavens that Randy got the company on the inclusivity push except for the laid off techs and service reps, and worse and worse service metrics."
Cramer bashed T again! What wind sock  says > 7% yield is scary!
My feeling why T down fall recently was Time Warner shareholders taking their profit. I wanted to buy more if it hit 30 but already own a lot of T and VZ. I believe we have hit the low going forward.Good luck to long term holders.
"T only went down the last two days due to the fund managers had to sell T and buy TWX, now that has been completed they can buy T. Crammer talked down T earlier so he can buy some knowing he made the wrong bet."
Sad but its gonna tank again as people rotate back into growth. Helluva lot ofDeals out there
TMUS-VZ also tanking today.
Revenue per share has been flat since 2013. Profit/EPS has come from cutting capital spending ($4 per share to 2.80) and tax cuts (33% to 19%).
Anyone else notice Big T closed above the 200?
"There are some weird people on this board. If you bought T for anything but the dividend I don't know what to tell you. It is a sub $30 stock period the end, better than a savings account."
"Market participants comprise so many types. One type is the uneducated who keeps hammering away at how dumb mgmnt was in the past to do this deal or that. They harp on it over and over as if the stock will reflect the past stupidity, whereas the smart investor knows that the stock market is forward looking and all historical facts are already reflected in the stock. So for you that are in the former camp, have at it....keep repeating the number of billiions less DTV is valued at today vs when they bought it. Say the numbers atgain and again as if you're saying something new, or as if you're intellectual somehow because you actually know the numbers.. The rest of us will determine whether an infusion of cash from a DTV deal positions the company better or worse for the future and will buy/sell/hold based on that."
"Wow, look at all the cheerleaders pouring out of the woodwork. LOL LOL We're on our way to the moon folks! Before you get too excited let me remind you that T's trading range is $28 - $32 and also that we've been here three times before in the last three months and even higher in mid December.Now carry on, it's fun to watch the ants running around this ant farm like a bunch of loony birds."
if you're like me I'm wondering why little tiny pee wee schitzo freak dr fauci cheeto puff stopped BRAGGING about buying BP at $31 with a slashed dividend......and stopped lecturing T shareholders on this message board about shorting its stock and gambling your shares on his call/puts options.....not only does little tiny cheeto puff look like dr fauci he knows everything like the cdc dr too......maybe he;s just having another bad day
"The anti T media predicts the market will go back to theaters. But big theaters closed or at 50%!!! The streaming numbers are not in yet for Wonder Woman. The strategy for streaming hit movies is correct and T will prosper! They have the films that the markets want!!!! Ha! The second wave of covid is strong, good 4th quarter for T and better 1st quarter 2021. Why such anti-T anger?"
This sure is some stock lol
Afternoon T ~ it’s a real shame T isn’t in the position to buy back shares . The stock needs a catalyst to move higher and not being negative just don’t think the stock is moving much higher
if you paid $57 a while back are u still stoked on the 7% div in your ROth?ARCC pays 9%
"My father is a Pioneer, worked at Western Electric for 30 years, will not all 30 he worked at Baltimore works on Broening Hey in East Balto and was transferred after judge Green broke up the Bell System in the 1980's and moved to Merrimack Valley in New Hampshire to finish his caareer at Lucent. He has gotten that dividend every quarter to supplement his retirement. There are many many people who rely on that old faithful payout. Thank you T for taking care of our family over the years"
"Get ready to say OH NO up T goes as they take even more customers away from VZ today LOL,LOL,LOL"
"Cable TV is dead. T is positioned to take advantage of worldwide switch to streaming via ala cart purchases of HBO Max. They will most likely lose Direct TV customers or at the very least retain some them to HBO Max. 5G does not have the big growth potential as HBO Max/Time Warner movies. HBO Max is the only reason this stock will go higher. Subscribers will be the focus of investors for the next few quarters as the big streamers (Netflix, DIS, Youtube TV, ROKU, HULU, Apple TV, etc) have a huge final fight to the finish for market share. Should be fun to watch the reports each quarter if your long and they crush the subscriber numbers."
I warming up too T here.....will have an  on it tomorrow. It did generate a short term buy signal last week.....if price holds I may be a player. Boy would that be something if the momo crowd pushed Big liquid T up too 52 week highs
"Play this smart- buy the dips, sell the rallies."

Another wonderful red day.
More rumblings of new max subs beating by a lot. Steady accumulation. Wednesday should be exciting to say the least. I'm betting longs will finally have a good day and shorts should consider covering before earnings.
Grab it while you can..HINT..Weekly....I am telling you...MMs will try to hold it back but they will be washed away!!!!
"Yesterday's close approx $30. T pays Divy $0.52 and stock is down $1.07 to $28.94, this doesn't really seem like a good deal. T is down double the quarterly dividend. Thoughts??"
"Once the larger funds have run their scam on 'growth' stocks that make no money and sell-off, they will all return to ATT which is probably 30% undervalued at the moment. It is a funny world, debt and cash are cheap and yet investors are looking for ATT to pay down debt?"
"Att has profits!!! ALL it has to do is stop the dividend, and the debt repayment machine will start... Why people hype on the stock going up or down... Tell them to cut the divy, just like WFC did, if you do not want to see a down day..... and have all previous and current management buy the stock on the open market.... you will see 40 in two weeks then... no one is ready for that!!!"
Quite the stock we have right here lol.
"My, the bashers are out in force today!"
I can see why Warren Buffett bought TMobile instead of T or VZ. Apparently they have a big lead in 5G spectrum.
What is surprising is why isn't Gold at $5000 with all the money printing thats going on. Bitcoin will hit 50K soon on its way to 100k.
Happy NYE to the weakest dividend chasers and humans in the market.  
"I'm in. IF they cut the dividend, it would be to pay down debt and that would get investors excited. So whoever bailed would be backfilled by others. It could actually go higher immediately, but if not it would drop and then rise fairly quickly. So basically this is a safe buy at 30."

I would really like to add a few more shares to my holdings. Been waiting for a hard bottom to form. Do you think we have seen it? Thanks in advance .
Man I love this stock. Ignore the noise. ATT will be around for a LONG LONG time paying dividends the whole way.
Pre-market action is nice. Will see 33+ today. Time for WS to appreciate T!
Is anyone else worried about their ability to continue to make dividend payments. Just say that they added 0 earnings after preferred dividends and everything (0 addition to retained earnings). Now considering this they would only be able to continue paying dividends at the current level for 2.5 years. Considering they took a loss this year and net income has been decreasing for the past 4 years is this something anyone else is worried about since most people in T are in for the dividend. Thanks!
"VZ new game plan is to see how many customers they can lose to the GREAT and powerful T every weekend is now setting a new record of how many customers VZ can lose LOL,LOL,LOL,LOL"
TGIF T ~ VZ & T bidding big for spectrum and worried about TMUS growth is probably doesn’t sit well with big shots
I've read some concerning articles the past couple days about HBO Max. They are basically throwing everything into it. If it doesn't work out for the streaming part they will be forced to re-evaluate the whole Warner platform including Max. Everything else getting tabled until MAX has some more content. Plus didn't know this but WW84 is no longer on streaming in the U.S... Only thirty days at the same point at theater release then all new content gets the boot off the guide. Yep.
hbo max now #1 in app store hottest app this holiday weekend. Disney #6 the only other streaming service in the top 200. will wall street care come monday?
WHAT IS THE PRICE DO YOU NEED T TO GO UP TO TO BREAK EVEN?MINE IS 34.23
You thought the riots over the summer was bad...we havent seen anything yet.
This stock is full of suprises today!
Besides my cannabis play this has been the worst stock in my portfolio. I have watched it drop over the past 5 years from 40 to 28 because of income. How much lower can it go?
IF T IS SO RICH WHY DO THEY NEED TO GET A LOAN FOR $14 BILLION AND GO DEEPER IN DEBT?
I did manage to buy 500 at 28.62 adding to my current 3000 shares. We will see where this goes.I hate the stock market.
"$35 by Friday, pin this post. Thank me on Friday"
Will the short squeeze Run up AT&T stock like GMELot of shares short
Almost all selling this am.
Is there a law preventing this stock from closing over $30?BTW- The yield fluctuates with share price- dividend is fixed until and if T changes it.
When u start paying $4 per gal and power bill goes up 20% . CNN helped sleepy Joe get slip into white house.
"T Goes down everyday like it's a routine, Too Bearish for anyone to hold while everything including GE goes up a lot recently."
I added 500 shares today @$28.88. GLTA 
"Three facts:1) CNN is the highest rated and most watched news channel in the world. 2) The motive has NOT been established in the Nashville bombing. Any speculation is just that.3) HBO Max is here to stay and movie theaters are likely destined for the history books. Between the overpriced everything, shootings, bombings, and COVID-19, it's unlikely anyone will return."
As expected yesterday’s low is bear trap just to scare the small day traders. Institutional holding recently went up exceeding to 54% of the outstanding volume.

Is a correction in the whole market coming? Maybe holding some cash for awhile might be a good idea. It's all a craps shoot.
CFO basically said today no dividend increase for 2021. Very disappointing. Says the stock price not reflecting dividend value. Ya...who's fault is that!?! T leadership needs to be paying more attention to the stock price & not their salaries & bonuses.

I am very surprised at how few investors are keeping up with what AT&T is doing in the area of Artificial Intelligence. AI is going to drive our economy in the future and AT&T has so many opportunities to grow the bottom line with their access and the Bell Labs.https://about.att.com/inside_connections_blog/future_of_ai
"Wow, this board went downhill fast. Yahoo censors where art thou?"
Loading up on T today. Dividend this week. Easy money. 7%. Booya a!
"So kinda mixed bag but overall good. Earning and revenue topped estimates, hbo max now 2 years AHEAD of schedule. Seems like sale of direct (well really partial sale) is going happen . I believe this is a positive (yes they made a terrible decision to buy it, like epically bad) since the thought process is what is best thing going forward. T was most active bidder in spectrum auction which short term is going to mean more debt (est 14 billion range) but long term good as this will help w 5G revenues. Guidance wasn’t as good as I hoped but overall not terrible. Still long T and believe nice stock for long term. D collect divy while u wait. This is not a high flyer like some clowns on here are bashing it for not being, it’s an income stock w potential for capitol appreciation esp when u control ur buy points. Good luck all"
OPEX keeping stock price pegged again and again etc
"CNN, the highest viewership on cable. Why would you want to sell a moneymaker like this? Now ad cost will skyrocket and become a cash cow for Warner Media. Things are looking up. If they did sell it though I can think of 1 billionaire that would gladly buy it."
Will it close above 30?
Guys this is a New Years miracle we are up more than 10 cents
LOL Forgot I still had 50 shares of AMC sitting in the portfolio... out with $800 profit. Hey Andy you still here? How about that AMC?
I/We believe AT&T is one of the Best Dividend plays with forward price appreciation in the Stock Market. Strong Buy.
"From webcast: ""We are having a STRONG 3rd Quarter"" - so expect good things on Oct 24th!"
This is a nice little run here. Hopefully we get 35 back soon and then onward to 36.
Remember when I said there is no other option but for VZ to come down and T to rise. The SP disparity was too great and with no reason to be as such. VZ had topped out for a while.No future proofing with media assets and only a money burn 5G to show for with apparently low ROI
Fear of earth rotational cessation if close above 29.00 ?
Typical T shareholders after receiving dividends
Does anyone know when the dividend announcement is going to be made
T ~ VZ big time premium customers are adapting to a new normal and with remote work etc VZ is in trouble. Wouldn’t short but won’t buy
Go T! CNN most watched cable news network.
Strange. ATT hasn't had any major institutional sell-offs that I can find in the SEC filings. I wonder why the price continues to scrape the undercarriage of respectability.
Dividend payment today? Must be in brokerage account after market closes today!
My guess is that T is going to continue to drift lower back to the $29 area again. How could you guys not see this coming today?
Hopefully the Netflix earnings will have a ripple effect on T but I doubt it.
doth my eyes deceive me?! are we actually going to close above 30?!?
Owning T stock is like being on a treadmill. Going nowhere fast.
"Looks like its $29 close today. Maybe next week it will go up to $29.15, but I doubt it. More likely 28.79 next week."
T being red is as sure as the sun coming up.
"Keep that in mind: T understands that the market is changing. They are adapting quite fast, the transformation takes times but it wont take long until good returns will come. T is currently the only telecommunications company that REDUCES its debt and still is able to invest highly in 5G/Fiber. Just look at T-Mobile and Verizon and their Debt-Outlook and Debt ratio. The Long-Term is just better for T.The biggest Asset T has is HBO Max (TimeWarner, but it comes down to its selling platform). This is the only streaming service that is able to really compete with Netflix. Just take Disney+ and HBO Max side by side. Disney+ is absolute trash and still the stock got rich because its a ""streaming"" service. So many people underestimate the burden of making a series of a large franchise. They are extremely expensive. The result is that Disney is barley able to bring out new content.Iam bullish on AT&T. It´s my largest position."
Somebody should go on Craig Moffet's Twitter account and ask him how that $66 price target for Verizon is looking. LOL (I don't have a Twitter account) Or the Moffett/Nathanson Twitter account.
"T, what are we going to do with you. Just incurred billions more in debt for 5G. No increase in dividend so far, top priorities per Mgt is 1. reduce debt. how ironic since they just incurred billions more in debt via 5G auction. 2. sell DTV although appears Stanky reluctant to let go of it. heck, why not wait another year when DTV will be worth even less.3. make HBO Max more successful. of the 17 million current subscribers, 75% of them get it free, so not a big income producer. T was\is successful in the tele business but got in over their heads by buying media which they were qualified to manage. verdict: T buried in debt and not proven yet that their media will be successful enough. a somewhat risky investment because of mediocre management. hold status."
"Seriously, how long will a 7% dividend last¿"
"T has a flood of new customers all from VZ's DUMD dASS HAN's and his Yahoo Natzi's running them off in droves as VZ now Censors what you can see read and post LOL,LOL,LOL you just can not make this stuff up . VZ FN themselves LOL,LOL,LOL Good Job Han's"

"I love how people get so scared when the market tanks. 2008 is a great example. If investors bought shares back then at discount prices, you would have a small fortune. Peaks and Valleys, someday you are on top of the mountain with a ton of shares."
at&t sent out 40k offers to management for voluntary separation...6 months salary...
"Race to the bottom: T-mobile prepay for single line is now as low as $15 unlimited talk text and 3g data. You can add 100g hotspot data for $50 per month. Can 100g data replace home internet? Yeah, maybe, depending on how much video you stream. AT&T has a prepay plan for $25 single line with 8g data. You must pay one year in advance ($300) to get that price. Analysts said having just 3 big providers would stabilize prices....Hasn’t happened."
"T, get a $.52 in dividends and lose up to $1 in stock price. How can a company who pays ex CEO who bought DTV , a $1 million in consulting fees after leaving T ? To me, weak mgt ."
the dividend of T can be considered as damages payment for the underperformance.
Bezos is not going to be the CEO of AT&T...He's just signed on to be a Consultant advisor for AT&Ts Warner Bros Media and HBO Max....Enough said.
[ 28.30 - 28.50 ] target range today
no money to be made on this stock
"What is wrong with this stock? Everything goes the way T wants with the merger, the law suit, the 5g roll outs, large capitalization etc. Surely things will slowly improve? How can a company with so many assets servicing a large public hunger fail?"
"Hope you did the smart thing and sold lots of stocks yesterday on the big up day to get ready for the CRASH that is now coming . LOL Inflation is here and only going to get worse watch for companies reporting input cost and margin squeeze as their stocks get slaughtered.

I am sure Melvin Capital regrets they didn't short T instead of GME.
"Hola ! The Como boy is going to court and impeached, probably around the time when T hits $35,"
Back below $30 next week ...
Verizon is up to 169 billion of debt according to multiple reports. But only AT&T has a debt problem. LOL
"once again, i've been with this stock many many years. 26 to 31, thats the range. Buy it for the dividends when stock market goes down due to tax increases. I unloaded all at 31. It will go back to 27, like it has for years. i plan on buying in june, when market realizes you cant print cash without tax hikes."
The dog had a good day
"All the T haters better learn long term to say OH NO up T goes, LOL,LOL T's new unlimited plans with Free HBO MAX is taking customers away from Both VZ and T mobile , Lets see if T mobile can hide how many customers they are losing to T or the earnings and customers losses are so big they just can't hide it LOL,LOL,LOL T's monster is now feeding on the competition LOL,LOL,LOL"
T nears deal to sell minority stake in Direct TV
T stock is not performing well ...... yet another dividend cashed in...
Make sure you get your shares of T on any pull backs before the ex dividend the week of April 5-9 2021 and before earnings shows how many customers T is now taking away from VZ and T Mobile Make sure you lock up all your shares with lock term sell orders over $60 or any higher price you want .
@apoplectic hun: the open interest is crazy! Wow!
AT&T is a pioneer company pays very good dividend; it's way oversold at this level especially considering other companies valuation.1T market-cap for AT&T by 2022 is the target.
do not worry my friends if it doesn't go up in price we will collect the dividend from the shorties very good CD be happy and be patient
Thumbs UP if you think T will keep moving higher from here and thumbs DOWN if you think it will start dropping again in the next day or two. Remember T is probably up in sympathy to VZ and if Buffett wouldn't have bought VZ today T would probably be doing what it usually does (which is not much).
"those are just noises to stir volatility so that someone can make money out of others wrong moves. Don't forget ATNT has been there all these years without the merger. even without this one, there will always be opportunity for another one. business still goes on. even if the merger approved, there will still be rumors like ATNT's financial status for the merger and so on."
"Worst stock ever not named Lehman, it's hard to find worse stock than T after Lehman in 2008 whereas even GE has been steadily going up. T is the Lehman of 2020s."
"Holy Cow! T one year ago 39.06. Now 29.23. A loss of 9.83. Add back 2.08 divy and you only lost 7.75 => 19.8% loss. When you go around saying nice 7% divy, you should be saying you lost nearly 20%. Worse yet, SPY was up over 14.5% in the same amount of time. You'd be up 14.5% instead of down 19.8%."
"Remember without DEM wits without a brain like all the T haters you would never get Great companies like T on sale, because T is now taking customers from VZ and T mobile with their new unlimited plans that you get HBO MAX for FREE, I would not be surprised that T would not have to warn that earnings are going to be better than they were thinking because they are now gaining so many new customers. LOL,LOL,LOL"

Do You not think if that was true that they would do that. I guess I must be an Idiot. It must just be Me."
"Bonds today are a terrible investment. AT&T is a bond replacement with its 7% yield. Total return on an investment = Price Appreciation + Dividends. Historically, dividends represent 40%of total return. May be a little lower today because of influx of technology. But with price now at extreme low, price appreciation is a good bet to go with your 7% dividend."

March 12 is the investors day at AT&T. Should be an interesting day￼￼￼
Morning T ~ said this b4 tmus like it or not but they are becoming a huge player in telecom. The stock is extremely expensive and don’t own but I follow
"$T Not increasing their dividend might have been the best move they've done in a while. Let's be honest, 95% of us are here for the dividend with a hope that one day their share price increases. It's not what we wanted, but could be better long-term. $T not increasing their dividend might be their way to pay down some debt and look to focus on HBO MAX expansion, which will be their cash cow in the future. They're expanding HBO MAX to Latin America and upgrade their version in Europe to match that of the one in America. Once they drop DirecTV, better things are coming, hopefully."
"The way I heard it, the DOJ once again tried to show that it's in the best interests of T to withhold content e.g. Turner, for the purpose of inflicting longer term pain on the competition. T attorneys and expert witnesses testified that this has never been demonstrated to work. There was also a lot of discussion of the modeling that the DOJ relied on and how it was or was not flawed. It sounded to me like the DOJ tried to prove that notwithstanding the modeling, the merger could do harm to the consumer, and in my layman's opinion, the judges didn't buy it. I realize that ain't worth much, but figured I'd post it anyway. I mean, what else is there to do on a 600 point drop day."
MO. Higher dividend. Infinitely more pricing power.
"Wu Han has a coronavirus bat research lab. And everyone is telling us that the virus came from a bat cave 1000's of miles away from Wu han.CNN keeps repeating this, trying to make it true."

T is going to go down in history as being the all time worse stock. Need to stop playing politics and think about valuation for the company besides pumping up dividends. Which is all it has going for it at this time!
I would like to see a $60 pps. Enough said.
"Looks like the only cell service that should be on any military base in the USA should only be T's cell service , If not the data is now going to the EU's one world order through T mobile or VZ controlled by Han's from the EU. Remember actions speak volumes as VZ and Han's EU run Yahoo NATZI censor Americans and even their own customers and shareholders. Very scary to have the EU with all the USA military data."
Shorts own and manipulate T. It is hard to understand why mgmt let’s it happen. Buy back your stock or delist it. Mgmt does not support shareholders.
"Another down day for AT&T, this is terrible. Management, across the board should be fired. They all must be taking payoffs from others."
"5G pretty soon to juice HBO; lower debt; new HBO advertisement subscription and with all the programs it will have, this stock is still pretty cheap. Highly bullish with this stock."
"Here is one for you if you want to make about 17% or about 12.5% on your money for the year VTRS should make about $4-$4.50 and start paying a dividend this year which should cause the stock to double , but if you don't want to buy VTRS for the growth and dividend , you can sell the Jan 21 2022 $17.50 strike puts and you get over $3 which is about 17% on your money or the $15 strike puts for about $1.90 should get you about 12.5 % on your money . Up to you what kind o#$%$ want to take a what kind of return you want. . T's option just don't have much money in them and they really never do."

wow look at all of this crying. picked up enough shares so I can do another covered call. Going to wait and see if I can pull off another weekly 30 strike. Can't do that with you all crying. Your tears are making the price go down! Merica
T above 30. I repeat. T above 30
"7 Reasons AT&T is undervalued and poised to outperform... 1) T offers a high dividend yield backed by a growing stream of free cash flows.2) T is aggressively paying-down debt which decreases its risk profile every year.3) T has begun an aggressive share repurchase program which will take advantage of the low price to earnings multiple in the stock price.4) T expects adjusted EPS to hit $4.65 by 2022 at the midpoint.5) T expects to pay off 100% of the debt issued for the Time Warner acquisition and end with debt to EBITDA of 2.0 to 2.25 times by 2022.6) T expects $31 billion in free cash flow at the midpoint by 2022.7) T has guided to use between 50% and 70% of free cash flow after the dividend for retiring shares (over 3% annually) and expects to retire 70% of shares issued for the Time Warner acquisition by 2022 (about 750 million shares).Assuming T hits their target of $4.65 in 2022 EPS, shares appear too cheap. Even if assuming no multiple expansion, then they arrive at a share price of $49 in 2022, or approximately 15% total annual returns over the next three years. Assuming T sees multiple expansion to 12 times earnings, shares would trade at $56, or approximately 18% total annual returns.Source: Seeking Alpha"
"Looks like the AT&T acquisition of Time Warner is turning out to be the ""catch of the day"" and a future goldmine for AT&T revenue/profit growth. No doubt in my mind it will break the $40 barrier before the end of this year. With a 6% dividend bonus deals like this don't come along every day."
If deal doesn't happen T will sky rocket. If deal does happen T will climb slowly after market sees benefit.
it will be the largest media company with it's own content.
"If the market would value AT&T telecom assets the same as Verizon, and AT&T media business the same as DIS, and it's streaming business the same as Netflix, AT&T would have a trillion dollar market cap."

Thank you BP for the big red days at the end of last week. Gave me a chance to sell the Mar 26 $24 Puts for .88 each. The T trade was good but the BP trade looks to be the big winner. I really like the oils here!
Biden is gonna print $2 Trillion covid stimulus.. Another 5 Trillion later to boost the economy.Where is all this money coming from? It grows on TREES. YES!!!
"Where does AT&T go from here?Did not slow down to even take a breathe at $37. Testing $37.50 again and with the tax proposal passing, I figure we will get another push tomorrow. This will make the manipulators very happy. The price will continue to go up throughout the year and should test new highs above $42 by mid 2018 after the tax cuts go into effect and we see in one quarter what it does to the bottom line. The second quarter that comes out in early August will solidify the results and we could be looking at not only a higher price but also a higher dividend.."

Hmmmmm A few things to think about today."
The Feds announced they will pay $50 a month to all low income people to have internet service . This means every American qualifies for free internet service if they could not afford it already!!! This is huge!!!!
I have a few questions....They are simple questions. Why is Elon Musk investing heavily in ExxonMobil with his personal $ Why do that if you believe EV's are so great. Another is why is Disney Executives buying into AT&T? It's their personal $ but why are they doing this? Things that make you go hmmm.
HBO is closing in on its 50th anniversary next year. Seems like most everyone who wanted HBO pretty much had it.Amazon Prime...just a baby. Gotta admire their streaming model build. It looking like genius.
"Don't worry, this will drop like a concrete block from the 10th story soon. It always does."
Stop falling for analyst pumps its a debt ridden #$%$
It is very simple. AT&T owns CNN. Right there they lose 50% of their potential customer base. They need to stay OUT of politics. And stop gouging customers with mediocre service and poor equipment.
"T's 5G monster is ALIVE LOL,LOL,LOL"
Berkshire Hathaway takes stake in Verizon and Chevron. He likes both sectors he said. Should be a Catalyst for AT&T.
"yo, cheetah,question for youI have a bunch of ATT bought at different times at different pricesI think you use Ameritradeif you sell covered calls, do they give you a way to specify which lot of shares your covering the trade with?in other words, can you specify which shares would get called away?Fidelity doesn't appear to provide me a way to do thisI assume they would just use the FIFO ruleit makes a difference for tax planning"
Anyone get their dividend payment yet?
"Understanding T investors they are in for the dividend for income to live on.. Getting paid over 3 times the 10 year T bill is something most dream of.. T investors get it every 3 months. T investors look and wish T would fall because it lets them lower their cost. Most have more money to buy more shares on the drop. Why does the drop not bother them? Because most are never going to sell and only buy more. For sure there are not many investment that would be better that T if you never planned to sell and only buy more. FACT, Plus to top it off T has now built and new business that no one company can compete with in the future and the future for T has not been this bright sense the first phone was made. Get ready to break out you shades because T is going to shine."
CNN is the highest rated and most watched news channel in the world. Period.
There's the news everyone's been waiting for.
You can’t beat this stock. High yield and growth potential.
How can T not avoid a huge 4Q impairment charge on Direct TV. The auditors have to be all over this; the price T paid for Direct TV and carried on the books; vs. the low bid prices to take the asset debt off the books. Watch out!

Was reading the conference call transcript and only saw 1 question about DTV. Stanky's answer was difficult to understand and very vague. I was wondering if anyone else heard or read the call and saw anything about DTV that would be useful to know.

Should I hold ? This is by far my largest inve
We should easily break out of the $32 range to $34+ with any good news at all tomorrow on Analyst Day.
"Alright folks, first time poster on T board. I bought 100 shares in 2013 and 100 shares in 2015. After dividends I have 300 +/- shares. I'm up a whopping 28% since 2013. Can someone give me a compelling reason (especially with a dem in WH, which is typically anti-dividend) why I should hold onto this thing?"
"Cut my losses on at&t on 12-22-20 and put the 40k in jd stock which is a China communist country stock but at least they admit they want destroy the US , wish CNN and AT&T would admit it. But until that happens, I have made 15% in 2 months."
"Think about where this is going. Warner today announced an end of Pepé Le Pew because he inappropriately made advances by kissing the arm of cartoon women. This from the Warner that gave us Sex in the City, Hung, Rome, Boardwalk Empire, Got, R.I.P. Cathouse, Westwood, Game of Thrones and many, many more.Does Warner’s ouster of LE Pew suggest Warner is now finding religion. How can AT&T tolerate the hypocrisy. Is it even fixable. We’re living in different times where past deeds are exposed and there comes an accounting."

TMobile down over $6.00 right now. (4.50%)
"AT&T is an awesome steal, 7% div with some major catalysts that people have been ignoring that that will be driving up share price.GM is a similar opportunity, possibly even better, raking in serious profits, massively reducing costs while having in my opinion the industry's most advanced AV platform in Cruise which Microsoft eagerly joined forces with, gaining some ownership as well as forming a strategic alliance to use their expertise to facilitate the AV capabilities, possibly the most advanced EV battery, at least advanced enough that Honda reached out to GM to assist them in provided batteries and tech for the development of two new Honda EV automobiles. GM has a third subsidiary which it owns, that being BrightDrop which has developed and already has a massive contract in place with FedEx to provide them with EV delivery trucks, contracts in the works with others as well. Each of these subsidiaries if spun off, especially Cruise AV would be valued greatly than GM is now, Cruise is currently valued at $30billion based on the private market, 80% owned by GM with Microsoft and Honda also owning a share.Massive upside in both AT&T along with GM"
AT&TCheetah thinks its funny that I don't know much about Options. I think it's even funnier that I make a little over 118K per year in Dividend income and don't need to play around with options gambling.You'd give ANYTHING to make that kind of mailbox money. Have fun scrambling around with your little options tables. HAHAHA!
This stock is like a clock. LOL (sad really)
CNN is fake news by fake journalists. Project Veritas has real journalists and news.
Get rid of Fake News CNN and stock will recover.
"Which is more likely? $30 +, or $28-$29?"
"I think T is still being held down due to the merger - uncertainty with courts, dilution of stock, merger integration costs, debt, etc. Once there is more clarity, T should be trading back to its equilibrium before all this merger mess started which is around $40. There is no way VZ should be trading at such a premium over T. I dont know why T hasn't announced massive cost-cutting yet from the merger. Maybe its for ""political"" reasons as the ruling is held up in the courts. The market likes massive cost-cutting, which is a no-brainer for T."
As a T share holder what is in it from this spin off? I have a 1000 share of T
All this SEC stuff happened 10 years ago.
anybody else always have trouble logging into Ameritrade? can't trade because streaming quotes not available is the second problem if you do get in.
 T has Morning Wood
From seeking alpha...The company has the pieces in place to transform the business but seems too anchored to traditional ways of operating...Really? SAME DAY PREMIERS? This is traditional? HBO MAX is the Cadillac of streaming!
T is doing well. slowly growing which shows it isn't being pumped.

$1400 should make the robinhood/reddit traders happy. The Govt should give everyone $500/mo Food tax credit to account for the food price rises. That would be nice.

"It's hard not to be under the water if you sat in T for long enough. Either just get out and call it a day or you will continue to face the same problem every now and then. It all started around Year 2000 was the starting of T's down fall. With 2 full decades of data of continuing decline, you can feel pretty confident to say that the Downtrend is intact and will more than likely to continue downward from here."
It doesn't matter how much the FED prints. T is stuck in the mud spinning its wheels.

"Pre market already in red and back to high $28’s. Should be interesting to see how today goes. Earnings and revenue down YOY, but some positives too. Growth in cell customers, HBO and HBO Max subscriber increases, dividend coverage in high 40’s % for 4th quarter and 55% for 2020, so dividend is s@fe."
Shorts covering buying stock take profit!! 
David....thanks for the daily lol........what is your game plan here?..........T has been in the $25-$45 range for the last 25 years.......do you really think anyone on this board is doing anything but lol at you.......it's time to focus your efforts somewhere else..........just some friendly advice........
Out at $30.30 back in at $29.77 happy enough
We are up a penny in post market. Going to try and make another run for 30 this week??
S ome thing else for anyone retiring soon you might be better off taking Social Security than living on you IRA and 401k money . Social Security you can not leave to your Family but you IRA and 401k money you can all up to you want what you want to do. Just some thing else to think about before you retire or you can just blow it all and have the DEM wits take care of you. Some have that plan already.
