I got up at 6.30 on my off day because my wife wanted starbucks.
I dont like these 1000 reserve stores. Looks to me like a big loss to me

I’ll jump in for 200 shares at 88.81
"Hanging on to SBUX and my other holdings because the market will rebound at some point. But it's so ironic that after today's action, SBUX is back to where it was a year ago. A year of gains wiped out."

"I do not post on these boards because frankly I believe it is a waste of keystrokes. However, as a shareholder the comments by the CEO about hiring a bunch of refugees sparked my interest in reviewing the comments on this board. I have been sitting in a Starbucks in Arizona for the last 90 minutes and there hasn't been a single minute where someone hasn't been in line waiting for their ""overpriced"" coffee. I will continue to hold my shares and buy from the shares from those that boycott. I have learned over a long investment horizon that consumers have very short memories."
"I am amazed that this stock is staying at this price ahead of the earnings report on 4/28. With a huge percentage of the stores not even opened for the past month, it has to take a pretty big toll."
"It looks like a stock split is a mixed bag , not really having that much effecthttps://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/analysis/2020/08/12/how-stocks-tend-to-perform-after-stock-splitsand remember today you can buy 1 sh or in some brokerage accounts even fractionsin the old days shares were bought in 100 s blocks and we used fractions like 1/4 or 1/2 for prices"
Acquisition coming? Why the big move today?
"Update on the post yesterday where I mentioned BCCI the CBD infused coffee company that is advertising at the Super Bowl,the Grammy Awards,61 NASCAR races and the NFL games. It is up over 30% with 12 times normal volume. I hope some of you took advantage."

WOW nice drop.Dunkin up
Miss Menneth has her pet goat Leroy and Kored has his pet black swan Lynn. Well he was supposed to anyway. The four time Super Bowl champ was a no show on Friday Sept. 30 and still hasn't been seen. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!

I suggest you check out AMD it is the next apple taking huge market share from both intel and nvidia.AMD is in a duopoly Witt Both intel and nvidia and while the market cap of intel is 240 billion and nvidia 160 Billion tiny AMD who is crushing intel as the ceo has even admitted it and sold all the shares he was allowed to sell search for it.AMD market cap just 15 Billion they will quickly become 30 Billion a fraction of the 2 companies they are in sole completion with and beating badly Read this article from investors business daily about what AMD has announced at computex and how it has a 27 dollar price target. You will make big gains as AMD is going to follow nvidias trajectory from 2 years ago and you will make much more than you ever will in Sbux read this from investors business daily not my words “AMD Stock Nears Buy Point On Trade Show Announcements”

Obviously this company is prejudice or they would not need training.
Market correction is looming and folks are out of jobs to afford $5 coffee.It’s a buy in the 50 .IMO

I’m bullish on Sbux this year but this is definitely due for a decent pull back in the short term.

Starbucks is a bloated stock should be worth $42
"People aren't going to go back into stores for a long time. And stores will drive thru have long lines with many people just not willing to wait for what seems forever to get a coffee pick up. Sweden never closed their movie theaters, but they're deserted, no one in sight, just like SBUX stores will be upon reopening. Short right here @ $77.10"
Nervous about earnings
oh hell no! it's going up.
Would anyone like to enlighten me on how this went from 93 to 96 within a day after reporting an awful 2020 outlook? Just curious as to how that happens.
Seems logical to me. Flight to quality $SBUX down and $GE is up.
"Once again, tiny Kenneth demonstrates how small he is by trying to drown out other voices. Too bad little fella. Damage is already done and you're just making yourself look worse."
"SBUX was priced for perfection, competition is on the way .Making good coffee is really not like refining gasoline or mining silver"

This will now be a bait to get free money at all fast food and drink shops. They all better be prepared for a massive amount of copy cats.
All my money is elsewhere *facepalm*
"why are people complaining about the price of the coffee in store?let's be real here, the majority don't own shares in the company who shop there, let them buy the coffee and you take their money.after all you bought the shares for the money....right?it's investing, not get rich quick!"
Auto buy button was pushed by institutions.
no more reccession ..economy booming again ..christmas close ..buy buy buy
My prediction is earnings miss. Starbucks executives are busy in multi-culti meetings.
just think you can buy AAPL right now for 123 and SBUX is at 108 ?there is no comparing state of the art tech to a fancy coffee shop
Guys. I believe SBUX is a good buy at 70 dollars.. That's where my technical analysis sits since I have been doing it since march 24 approx to today
AHHHHHH back under $60.What do ya think about thatjoey punk the loser. costblodiving faster. ha ha hahah hew
"More often than not, the daily chart looks like a ski slope. I have a feeling that if SBUX only meets expectations or misses by a penney, it'll get brutalized.."
Most of the people bought put and now they are scared because of loosing $$big time
sbuxPrice/Cash Flow (Most Recent Quarter) 30.81Book Value -6.72 yes that is a negative numberPrice/Sales (Most Recent Quarter) 4.51 wow for a company that sells coffee ???EPS Growth (Last Qrtr vs. Same Qrtr Prior Year) -28.38% again that's negativenot to mention all the sales and revenue lost in the midwest power outages
Whose watching the CEO on CNBC? watch the interview.
"JC Penny, a huge success? Let's hope it's not contagious"
Schultz left because of the anti-semitism threat he gave big monies to the israeli defense and his loyalties were questioned
So SBUX is going to do a buy back and expects the government to pay their laidoff employees? NO WAY !!!!
MY GIFT IS UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WRAPPED IN RED RIBBON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO STATES LEROY!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"The two clowns that inspired this latest round of PC/SJW by Schultz/Starbutts, must be laughing their FAO! This is the most blatant example of corporate pandering I have ever seen."
"For those in the restaurant space willing to take a little risk, check out BFI (Burger Fi), a rapidly growing burger chain in Florida and Saudi Arabia. Great reviews, they handled COVID well (kept revenues flat) by expanding to delivery and more takeout, and are poised for growth (see their press releases). No dividend however. But a multi year play on a well run restaurant company.$BFI $DRI $EAT $SBUX $MCD $WEN $CMG"
It's pretty quiet here today. no group therapy session today?
CNBC says Buy buy buy!
Let's see...8% beat on EPS - 40% run up in stock (plus 6% after hours). This is truly a joke. One hicup in the economy and comps go down 10%. I think this is a bit long in the tooth. Good luck longs.
starstruck is finished - every homeless dude in the country will eventually find out about the free accommodations at starbucks - flooded with the homeless you can then add illegals who known they will never call the COPS- after that how about drug dealers knowing it's a no COP zone- skin heads might also try to invade one just for fun- add to it how about a BLM invasion -- everyone welcome to the new homeless shelters where the old ones would hassle you for drug use-- the new starbucks shelter will never question you-- how about those felons who are on the lam -- won't find anyone calling the COPS so you can rest up there---I am going to hang out there myself and hope they throw me out so I can start legal action and get some of those star buck$- they are right it is about race- but not the kind they are thinking of-- a RACE to the bottom is it

Wait three months you will be able to buy Starbucks at low 50s; good company long term however
Might as well sell this stock ! not very many people like the new rewards program! most loyal customers will be alienated
"Starbucks longs....great brand and will go up when recovery takes hold. I have you seen the epic short squeeze on GameStop, AMC and Michael’s Craft Stores? I like MIK because 30% of market cap is short and scrambling and company is over delivering on top and bottom line with only a 12 Price to Earnings.....fun to watch the shorts try to cover. Do your own due diligence but think Michael’s could easily double next few days!"
"OK, my last time to starbucks, went to the restroom and a poor homeless guy was washing out his shorts in the sink and he said the free coffee they gave him caused him to get the runs. He also said the open bathrooms are great for washing up and doing his laundry."
"There must be a thousand Starbucks stores in Las Vegas, they are everywhere, in grocery stores, too. And they seem to always be busy. I still see new ones springing up. One area they look for expansion is Europe. We hear about Asian expansion all the time but I did not see a lot of stores in Spain and Italy other than a large store at the Barcelona airport."
Starbucks is feeling the pain when business activity comes to a sudden halt. They are not in the minority as countless industries and companies are sharing a similar fate. There is no reason to avoid buying this stock if you like it like I do. Just buy small amounts and buy small amounts of other companies that have been decimated. Who would even consider Royal Carribean cruiselines. I would and even though I'm down 900 dollars on 45 shares I'm thinking of adding another 10 to 15 after today's pummeling. The ships maybe moored but they will sail again. You need to think this way.
hmm they saying this under pressure for some reason but lines at the drive through are 3x longer than before covid
"When life is rosy, I am happy to pay five bucks for a cup of coffee. But in a depression, fifty cents is too much. Their business model is no longer viable. Not today, not next year."
They came out with this statement so that when earnings come out it will be a massive beat.
I'll have a Venti water with my name on it & a pocket full of napkins
You see movement out of Growth into Growth and Income...that means SBUX
what's the price target at?
Starbucks now offering delivery in SF! Instead of $8 coffees now with delivery fees it will be $15-20 coffees... YAY!!! 
Best no to mix politics and business Howard. I personally have save hundreds if not thousands on Starbucks coffee since the immigration comments. I'm just one example and I bet there are thousands.
Dow Jones is up 20% in the past 2 months. What more is there to gain for the bulls at this point in the short term?
is this a good entry point?
"I would buy a couple hundred shares at 80 , keep selling it people I want in"
Institutional investors love this stock. They will continue to add more in 2020 because EPS growth is inevitable
"Can someone tell me why this stock isn’t moving at all? SBUX is the biggest thing in coffee right now, drive through lines are crazy, every mobile order counter is slammed every morning, and with the cold coming about hot drinks should be on the rise!"
we buy our espresso from puerto rico and perk it at home. it is so good. not everybody has the time or wants to wait for their morning fix. I could never justify spending $5 a day on a coffee but I guess there are many who do. for now i'm long...
"sbux by my house ofcourse in CA, is a new homeless hang out, nowhere to sit."
It's time to show Starbucks what half of the voters of this country can do! boycott

AMZN should buy SBUX and start selling on amazon :)
"Poor guidance, low growth and a high forward multipleTastes like burnt coffeeATRS"
"Four months from now SBUX will be in the $20's. They're estimating a 47 cent loss per share this upcoming quarter report, and estimating breakeven next quarter and a 45 cent profit seven months from now. With a P/E of 24 and a ttm EPS of .64, figure it out. SBUX will be back to $90, but it will take 3 years."

"If you bought SBUX at 71 earlier this year then I understand your selling it today. But I am not. For who, in their right mind would sell SBUX before the holydays seasons? The same goes for AMZN. Ghassan"
Kevin just sold all my sbux
"Somebody said SBUX will convert unprofitable stores into restaurants, offering breakfast and lunch.Ok, so SBUX is going after Darden? Well I got an idea, this really won't cost anything. Stop the political tweet and just serve your #$%$ coffee.

Starbucks drive thru's are all very crowded.
Buy and hold. Period. You will have doubled your investment in 2 yrs.

"Majority of Starbucks locations are still closed (I.e malls, shopping centers) a lot of high traffic areas, plus a lot of people aren’t working right now and aren’t getting their coffee, sure lines may be long at some but that doesn’t mean much. I expect them to be short on earnings tommorow and the price to drop, it will eventually come back"
Wish the CEO would stay out of politics end of story!
I like 90. 90 is a nice round number. 100 is even better. Do I hear 120 in a year?
"This is an opportunity for SBUX to lock up all interiors. This will lock out all the water drinking bums, unemployed and fake employed. K. SBUX has a big advantage over other retailers; it has a drive-thru business. Customers don't care how they get their caffein and sugar drug fix. What do they care if they et te drug from an arm out of a little window. And, people will be living in their car more and more all the time because of their smart phones. This all a win win. The employees will be happy to put the 1"" chain and padlock on the front door . No more cleaning up the bathrooms after slobs and homeless. No more having to be nicey nice to everybody, because there will not anybody in there. Only happy drive thru customers happy in their cars. K ? Fleet."
pretty cool this stock drops the same day SBUX announces wage increases sigh
"It is surprising this stock doesn't do better, based on the fact that at any given moment when I drive past a Starbucks drive through, there are at least 8 cars happily waiting to spend $4 on a cup of hot brown water. The markup / profit on that must be hyperbolic."
SBUX is borrowing money to pay dividends - Moodys cut's SBUX ratings...

Off a dollar for what?
Almost a 100% gain from the bottom of last year. Unbelievable for a large corporation like SBUX.
"Over 50% of Starbucks coffee shops are not selling enough product to cover their overhead and yet the shares are trading over 100 X of the last 4 quarters earnings , a real joke on wall street, Booyah to all clowns, bobbleheads, and jungle bunnies of wall street."

Off to Starbucks to get their new drink Purple drank latte
If it’s break 115 it will go to 116.5
Cancelling Buyback and losing 70% of sales and this stock still sees $70. Wow there are really some believing in this stock. There should be panic selloff normally.
Odd smell at Starbuck's identified. Coffee isn't the only brown thing in there and that's the poop on the matter. Fecal people...as in excrement.Enjoy your coffee now you get the result in the first sip if you get my drift.
to go please with real milk and sugar
SBUX is opening stores at 25% of normal traffic. This will result in a net loss. It will slow down the hemorrhaging of money in the form of fixed costs.There is nothing good in the news. Management states that losses will continue and increase dramatically throughout this year.
75 bucks - 2 weeks longest
Below 60 is a good buy
SBUX 20 bilion invest
"Go down , expensive products"
"SBUX to face new competition. Circle K, Exxon, Chevron, etc. to install at the pumps a new technology that can automatically make 24/7, a cup of coffee 100% as good as SBUX and Peets. Cheaper price, quicker, fashion designer cups from Gucci to YSL. The only people that go into SBUX or sit outside are bums. People only want the caffeine and high quality coffee on the fly."
Why the drop
False earnings numbers again.
$102 and beyond let’s go!
hold or sell?
Big BUBBLE......
starshits has to be the worse coffee ever.
margins shrank....profitablity down.....guidance not raised but in the lower end of range
"Seems like Jim Cramer poured water on the run and then promoted several other investments he's currently invested in. We've seen this before, once his position is built then he'll be all over Starbucks telling everyone what a great move Ackman made."
I just don't get it. I sure hope this is a double bottom forming.
"Obummer - not so much the Zulu warrior, more the Nigerian con artist. SBUX new drink , the Obummer. U order one thing get another and get short changed."
"Don't worry guys. There's hardly any volume on $SBUX today and it's down again. Everyone's just waiting for upcoming earnings, when they'll crush it. If she comes down a bit more before then, I may add to my holdings."
"The result speaks for itself. I feel bad for some of the franchisees who have to see their revenue suffer because of the lack of common sense of ex-CEO Schultz. I think they should consider changing their franchise to Coffee Bean, Pete's or Dunkin if they no longer share the same business philosophy with the Starbucks corporate."
"I've been saying it for months, and now finally its starting to sink in. Today, Starbucks is DOWNGRADED... Sell NOW.."
"The management of this company has violated their fiduciary obligations, by putting their own leftard political agenda above the interests of it's shareholders.Shareholder lawsuits will likely follow.The board needs to replace management."
"Downgraded on cannibalization fears, meaning Starbucks are losing sales to other Starbucks locations. Would you rather spread your sales across multiple locations, assuming all are profitable, or give those sales to another coffee house competitor? I'd rather collect all the profitable sales possible, as long as I was able to deliver a great experience in each and every store. Long story short, I think cannibalization fears are overblown. The SBUX story is still only in chapter 4 of an 8 chapter book and there's a very happy ending in the end."
"world's people doesn't like army, nobody like war, but world's people like SBUX coffee, SO world peace will boost SBUX sales strong growth. China support North Korea quit nuclear bomb and long missile, the world war will end, the world's people can sitting chair happy drinking SBUX coffee, no war affect them, this is very good news for SBUX."
Are you guys aware that there is a CBD infused coffee being sold. The company stock symbol is BCCI. I found their website very informative. They will be advertising at the Grammy Awards this Sunday as well as a bunch of NBA games and 61NASCAR races. They also had ads at last weeks Super Bowl. Why doesn’t SBUX sell an infused coffee?
"The shorts are trying desperately to get the price lower. Almost hilarious to read, the things you people say. The intelligent people understand what you are doing. Here is reality:1. Starbucks is a very profitable company, always will be. 2. The stock is now very undervalued.3. People are not going to stop drinking coffee.4. This is a golden opportunity to buy low, sell high at the end of the year.I bought 3,000 shares and plan to pocket at least $17,000 by Christmas. 5. Dividends increased.6. Debt is relatively low. Look at other companies!7. The closing of 150 stores is a GOOD thing, not a BAD thing. Why? They are under performing, and there are better places to open up shops. That Seattle mall where there are four Starbucks shops is pretty ridiculous. 8. Stock buybacks will happen now at a much faster pace, and the number of shares will increase, more than normal...per press release. Beautiful! Will increase the price obviously.9. For the truly investment savvy people out there who understand selling covered calls on your shares, that strategy also add to your profits. So you get dividends, price appreciation, and covered call profits!! A triple ""bagger"" so to speak. Good luck Longs...the shorts will cover within a couple days or so. We can relax and enjoy the rise back. In summary - as Warren Buffet says = Buy low, sell high."
the weather's changing... people Need their SBUX in the morning!!!
So sales are down. That should be no surprise considering Shultz insulted half his customer base

no matter how you want to bash it.....Starbucks is very popular in Asia/SE Asia. Been to those regions to visit last year and I was seeking out Starbucks while I was there and every time it was busy/crowded.
Dunkin close to $70 as starshit sinks.
Just put a buy order for $25. Hopefully I could close by the end of next week.
Selling about over --buyers looking to enter. Earnings report indicated tremendous sales growth and they met earnings expectations--not really much reason to sell. One to three more days? MCD rebounding.

Buffett said that most people are used to working from home and now they may make it permanent. That means those morning office workers getting coffee are not coming back. He went on to say retail space maybe overpriced. So SBUX is paying too high of rent without the customers coming back.
100 seemed to be the top for a while and im sure with everyone losing everything to covid people will start making coffee at home so i can see this dropping to 95-100 for a while... but stonks will stonk so gl

The other day I was in one and a smelly bum came in and sat down... smelled the entire place up... but nothing the employees can do..

Punk boy joey in prison for welfare fraud.
It is employee abuse by rich homeowners in San Diego and SoCal. 13 to 30 add-ons to a coffee. Institute a $15.00 surcharge for anything more than 5 add-ons by one of these juvenile customers with the $15.00 earmarked for the SBUX employee that made the coffee. They have the money. Make them pay.
"Coffee is the biggest legal narcotic in the world. Every one hooked on it, and Starbucks is there to supply it legally lolDue to evolution of electric cars and solar systems, people will start consuming less oil.

"You see were the clowns of wall street can't function properly ?, a simple coffee shop like Starbucks that serve everything from frozen to microwave it is trading at over 28 X last year earnings,and than we have (WBA) that earned close to $6.00 a share all of last year and is trading at just above $42.00 ,where is the logic clowns ?"
"Pure speculation is driving the price of Starbucks up. Are people traveling? No. Are people grabbing a Starbucks on the way into the office? No, because nobody is going into the office. Are people meeting at Starbucks? Very few, as most of them are allowing minimal people inside. Revenues fell to the $4 billion range & profit tanked last quarter. Yet, somehow the stock price is equal to what it was a year ago, when the economy was humming along."
"It looks to me like a big player is unloading shares. If so, it will turn around once they' ve finished unloading their position. This happens to gpod stocks now and tben. Dividend payment coming up and they will miss it. Tbe fundamentals haven't changed. Good forward guidance. They are opening more stores in China, etc."
"I wonder how many of these folks work at Starbucks??? Wow40% of all workers in LA County (10.2 million people) are working for cash; and not paying taxes. This is because they are predominantly illegal immigrants, working without a green card.(Donald Trump was right)"

"Starbuck’s sole expansion strategy is selling $5 cups of coffee in China. Most Chinese can’t even afford it so basically it’s just for showing off. With the trade war and hatred for foreign brands mobilized through the 50-cent communist propaganda, I’m afraid Starbucks has more downside to go."

"This happened in a Starbucks a little while ago: Sunday morning, a man came into the store and picked up the Sunday New York TImes. He asked the cashier whether he could read the newspaper. The cashier told the man he had to pay for it first. The man said he only wanted to read the it. (I don't know what else one can do with a newspaper other than reading it.) After this exchange was repeated twice, the cashier said OK. The man didn't pay for the paper or purchase anything; just took the paper to a table and read it. Afterwards, the paper was left scattered on the table and chairs and the man walked out of the store. The Sunday NY Times only costs $5.00."

Financial analysts predict that Starbucks will grow by about 6% annually over the next five years. Starbucks is up by 0.6% this year and the future of this stock is looking very bright. Many investors have been able to cash in on this investment this year due to rises in their share prices. I can do better in Municipal bonds and sleep at night.
Any upgrades today? They made and beat the top 6 billion and missed by 2-3 cents due to paying all employees during store closures. As the states and world start opening things will get back to normal. There should be upgrades. Not a bad report under these terrible times.
I understand China can bring growth opportunity but isn't too quick an expansion there one of the causes of the stock dropping off over a decade ago and Schultz coming back? How is this different today?
Up almost 6% today! More than the DOW and the NASDAQ Longs with patience will be fine.
"Investor conference euphoria will settle overnight. P/E of 130...

"Starbucks, Target Among Companies to Still Mandate Masks in Texas Despite Lift on Covid-19 RestrictionsI see people boycotting in tx"
"Starbucks is opening stores with 25% occupancy. Drive throughs will pick up a modestly, they are not going to be able to handle large volume of customers because they have to have employee spacing. They cannot allow in more customers until most people are vaccinated, at least a year from now, at the absolute least. There will be no time shortcuts for the vaccines to be declared safe.At 25% customer occupancy their profits will crash and they will maybe cover their financial obligations for rent and payroll, not to mention their losses from aged inventory, rents, and expensive fixed costs of buying less product , for at least the next 2 years. Hopefully, for the next 2 years, their losses will slow down a lot.The stock market will exhibit signs of V shape, and at times U shape, but when stretched out over a timeline of 2 years, it will look L shaped.

Seems overdone
new credit card should be a big boost to revenues. this will hit 80 by end of year.
Ouch! Not looking good. Would like to invest but there is no telling when the bleeding will end. Maybe they need a new market strategy
Can't believe this held the 52 week low! impressive!
SBUX longs will learn the lessons of their lives at 4PM today and they will realize that yes daddy stocks can go down....I am going to go out on a limb and predict the 49's level will be hit AH tonight..PE 30 is ridiculous for SBUX revenue and earnings growth...
Shorts must be ecstatic
"after school, in Brooklyn college New York, I saw a lot of students drinking SBUX coffee, l didn't see any people drinking sodas, if you are KO holders, buy SBUX to replace your KO, SBUX drinks are very health coffee, it's worth to drink, it's stock is worth to buy, $75 per share is observe."

"ELEV8 Brands, EVAT would be a great addition to this coffee chain. Getting a great leader in the HEMP COFFEE/TEA market."
"Starbucks is dishing out pay increases and stock bonuses to employees, becoming the latest major employer to boost compensation after President Trump approved a tax cut that will benefit businesses.The coffeeshop chain said it would spend $120 million on wage hikes that will vary in magnitude throughout the country. The company said it already pays more than minimum wage in all of its markets.The Seattle-based company will also give stock grants to everyone employed at the company's stores, plants and support centers as of Jan. 1. Hourly retail workers will get at least $500 in shares while store managers will get $2,000.Altogether, Starbucks said it would spend more than $250 million on the increased wages and benefits.The company credited ""recent changes in the U.S. tax law,"" saying they ""accelerated"" the decision. Starbucks will also offer additional parental leave for six paid weeks to all non-birth parents. Walmart, the nation's largest employer, recently announced a minimum wage boost to $11 per hour. JPMorgan Chase announced 10% average pay increases for workers on Monday, and The Walt Disney Co. announced $1,000 bonuses Monday.Dozens of other companies have also announced wage increases or bonuses THANKS To President Trump tax cuts for low to middle class Americans of All races.OF course the white lib Dem millennial COMMUNISTS will refuse the bonuses and pay RAISES because they came from President Trump."

Where are the buyers? I am short this has been!
You see the looting of American companies in paying the CFO one million dollars as a consultant; and people expect Starbucks to do well; all these money is from the shareholders; if Starbucks cannot do well with lines in their stores and expensive coffee something is fundamentally wrong with this company
Wall Street logic--sell SBUX and buy X it has a better business plan and outlook. Duh...
Bill Ackman sold all his position.It’s a way overpriced and will drop down in the 50-60 with market correction looming.
"bought this at 71, glad I made a move"

We all in deep sheet

"If you are a SBUX bull you cannot be too disappointed in todays action. Bounced right off of the 15 DMA almost to the penny, closed nearly flat in a bad tape. Volume was elevated but nothing to get excited about. Bears? It looked good for a while, but the action into the close was not encouraging. Tomorrow is another day. Bears get a point for closing red, but bulls have to feel relieved. It could have been much worse."
So confused as to what is going on here
Downgrade Goldman!
Looks like large numbers of Americans are planning on permanently boycotting Starbucks for their ridiculous pandering of Islamists.
I use to spend $100-300 a month there! Now I got once or twice a month for about $10-20... I am sure a lot of other people are doing the same! The coffee maker we have a home now didn’t cost a lot and makes the coffee just as good if not better! I am a coffee nut. For not that much money now you can make better coffee now at home... no need for the $200+ machines anymore!
Ttttttttoo much information. Does this company do anything that they keep to themselves?

"I don’t believe it’s still bellow $50, it should of been $55 plus. I don’t care all the losers in this board bash sbux all the time, they can’t afford to buy for even $5."
does not look like sbux will hit 52.00 before earnings.

well SBUX does look like a value compared to CAKE but MCD looks like the best value
looks like the markets are not going down anytime soon
This is going to tank. Peeps staying home making their own coffee rather than paying $5
This stock is worth at most $50. Sell now before it's too late.
its not about what happened is more about guidance and going forward.
"A downgrade today by Ned Davis Research Group from buy to neutral could explain the price action. Zacks had also downgraded recently. Still, the Thompson Reuters equity summary score is 8.8 out of 10 which is still very good with 8 buy recommendations, 15 neutral, and 4 outperform. No sell recommendations."
"6-4-18 Downtown Denver Starbucks on 16th; two of six outside tables occupied by homeless, one with legs on table vaping. No paying customers in sight. CNBC Schultz love fest will continue and SBUX decline will be attributed to his departure vs political policies that are bad for business."
just an interesting observation 1st Q 2019 earnings .75 a share stock price $661st Q 2020 earnings .79 a share stock price $691st Q 2021 earnings est .53 to .65 stock price is $103 but we are not in a bubble .......

"Grimmikins, great call on shorting COST at $113 as it closes in on yet another 52 week high near $190.BittyBit, great call on advising all to buy GE at $22.50. You've still got that reverse-Midas touch, Docta Dums.No wonder you two dust bunnies consider yourselves to be a tag-team."
Fathers Day & Dunkin. Perfect together.starshits take a hike loser.
If Schultz attains the presidency will junkies and homeless be allowed to use restroom facilities on demand? Will there be needle collection facilities thruout the White House?
"Grimbelina, did you know that COST is sitting at $194.38? At what price did you get called on your short at $113? C'mon, you know you got called. You know you lost a big 'ol imaginary wad. How much imaginary money did you have to pull out of your imaginary safe on your imaginary yacht to cover that imaginary short? C'mon, Grimmikins......step up, son.Betcha you won't."
"Some $COST beans made at home, never going to $SBUX unless Iam traveling. Will retire a year early."
trading 5 bucks above avg estimates
I am not giving up on SBUX yet just wil wait for it to drop to 40s before I initiate a position. I can't not believe how negative people are on this board. They act as if this company is going bankrupt when it is just growing slowly
Congrats nice safe haven.
Going lower until things get back to normal.
Surprised to see this trading up post market may of beat (just) expected earnings but have revised down Q4 Outlook from their own guidance given just over a month ago...loyalty members down and trading now at over 120 PE of there own EPS predictions at current share...looking v punchy
My buy order $ 44.00
Think I have whiplash!
Drop baby drop!
I. Have Sbux for a long time 95 percent up I really think it’s time for me to sell. Was a great div but when a company is saying they are closing stores and not doing good. Rather sell before it goes lower
"The new platform/format/configuration isn't worth whatever Yahoo paid for it. Go back to the old format, plus incorporate everything under one 'click' (chart, vitals, messages ('conversations'), profile, analyst's opinions, etc., and you'd have the rest of the 'online charts' guys eating out of your hands. You'd sell lots of ads, and maybe get Yahoo out of the doldrums. I'd like that, and I'm sure you would, too. It's the American way."
looks like it going red oh. no
I am a Bull on SBUX if they use this crises to permanently close all seating arears. Employees will love it. This will cut costs bigtime. No more bums in there. Fleet
Where's the crowd?The past 3 days the amount of people at 8am has dropped to 10 from 30.
"here it comes u doubters lol the problem was short positions due to goldmans dowmgrade, now positions covered time to climb..20,000@30.00/share"

Hey Red DNKN down almost 10x SBUX yesterday.
All of a sudden the commies running this company like capitalism.....
ne can shed some lights on why SBUX being dump big today so far this morning
Upgrades tomorrow. Market and profitability improving. Covid vaccine rolling out fast.
This is undervalued currently. Earnings date in a month. Lots of changes to products and expansion. Interesting to see what happens
I have a buy in at 53.00
DPW +5% happy trading guys
There's a post on the Rumor/Murmurs/Buzz page about $SBUX and $CVSI being in talks to run +CBD in all locations upon FB competition. Has anyone seen any corroborating sources?
Up or Down after earnings report tomorrow?
China took a bite out of the apple like Lunkin Coffee house will take a bite out of Starbucks in China!
I'm out. SBUX is losing more than the dividend is worth.
"13,000 Starbucks homeless shelter stores in the United States"
"The gardener, it seems to be working, the stock has done better than expected during COVID. Long sbux."
Of course this should be up - miss on both lines by a lot... why not go up?
Yes relief rally ahead for tomorrow
"these guys pulled their advertising from tucker carlson, time to boycott starbucks"
"some analysts said SBUX open too many stores, but they didn't know every SBUX stores have very good business, SO I think SBUX can open more store ,it's sales have more room to growth, SBUX taste are very good, no one can pass, SO SBUX can get more customers and sell more products, SBUX worth $75 per share now."
"Sitting in Starbucks in Arizona on a Saturday morning for an hour. Extremely lite foot traffic. Only 2 customers sitting in store. Have owned Starbucks stock several times but not currently. Would be interested again at $40, not a penny over."
looks like a good buying opportunity
There is not any significant growth potential for sbx. Too risky to keep it before recession..
$103 pre market??? I smell a venti rally latte coming! Lol
"Time for old too rich man Schultz to move on. He's hurting SBUX shareholders with his far left nonsense. If he has a cause fine, then do it personally--don't mix politics and business on my investment! He should work on the terrible business numbers instead of shooting off his mouth about his far left viewpoints that make himself feel important and meaningful! Idiot--hello Dunkin and McDonalds!"
Dunkin the stock to own.
It’s going to pop pop goes the coffee lid !
Great move by Starbucks to pay employees.. Yes share price will be hit short term.. But millions of people around the world will remember the companies that showed loyalty to their employees in hard economic times and our brand will just bigger.
"it's morning, millions of cups of coffee are being served at the moment at Starbucks locations."
"How your daily coffee habit is costing you $1,000,000 -"

it takes at least 20 minutes to make your coffee
SBUX PROFIT MONIES USED TO COMMITT GENOCIDE AGAINST PALESTINIANS SCHULTZ WAS CATCHING THE HEAT
This lacks the volume needed to make 52 week new high.
Total BS pop at the end of the day. AMZN and AAPL both did the same. Someone hit these shares hard and paid a price for AMZN after the close.
"All restaurant stocks are down a ton!! They will come back, only when? Buy $QRS $MCD $SBUX etc etc."

I am buying coffee every day from Starbucks to support their common sense position. tmThis cancel culture nonesense has to stop.
Wow this Starbucks chat has more trolls than the baba chat
Does anyone drink Starbucks coffee anymore ? The growth cycle looks like its over to me ...high PE and low growth ...time to short or sell this .
you don't need to be able read the tea leaves...Starbucks CEO is a NUT JOB !!
"Revenue will collapse in next 2 quarters - China+airports. The company has a negative book value of $5 per Yahoo Finance Statistics, but hopefully they will keep buying their stock back and draw down their cash."
"College student here, and can say that Starbucks all around campus are lined up outside the door every time I walk by. Along with a large variety of their products located in vending machines, it is by far the most popular coffee product. I sold today since I was up 45% and believe the stock had a little run in the previous 2-3 months. Valuation is getting a little high and the PEG ratio of above 2 is expensive also. Great stock to own when reinvesting the dividend and believe it still has room to grow. Good luck to all, hope I can jump back in after a little pull back. Originally bought due to Chinese exposure, but with growing competition from other cheaper delivered coffees, Starbucks may have to rethink the business model. Shanghai store is still doing extremely well and fundamentals remain the same. M-Man"
$65 soon.
Absolutely love this company and love this stock.

"Schultz says, ""Rents are coming down."" If he were smart, he would have bought the space, not rented. Never own a restaurant or bar, unless you own the real estate. Imagine SBUX' book value, if they had focused on putting profits into the real estate. This company is horribly run. that is why it has stagnated."
It broke multi year support; Watch out below 40; this stock is not a growth story anymore; if you cannot grow with busy stores and expensive coffee something is seriously wrong with this company; save your money and don’t be romantic and stick with this company
Maybe the CFO is also running for dem nominee.
She's trading on technicals...should see 77 soon!
Starbucks is giving out millions of free cups of coffee to black people who 999.9% of them will never spend $5 for a cup of coffee.
Is this place in trouble?

Why is Starbucks still in the doghouse?
"Take whatever amount you'd feel comfortable making 15% a year average over the next 26 years with, and put it on SBUX, let it ride, reinvest the dividends, and don't worry about the short term with it. There'll be big gains, flat periods, and corrections, but over the long term it will be a big winner, and a boulder for retirement."
Starbucks is best in business
What. Is. Going. On.
Starbucks reached a 52 Week high at 100.34
"SBUX show tail rise today, SO SBUX is good stock, all good stock always shows tail rise, SO don't sell your SBUX, SBUX will rise more than fall in future,"
"SBUX earnings Missed the revised estimate, Missed 60% from original Q2 EPS estimate. Don't forget tomorrow morning a very very poor GDP decline report will hit the market and DOW, SBUX will go down down down in my opinion big time."

"SBUX junk bond not backed by Fed. It is an illusion that the Fed is buying all junk bonds, that is not true. They have Blackrock buying them and they have rules1. They can only buy 20% of any ETF.2. Only 10% on an individual debt offering3. Companies that tool Cares Act money are not eligibileIf SBUX took Cares Money none of the junk bonds are Fed backed. At best only 90% of the debt is Fed Backed. So SBUX debt downgrade is worse than people think. Earnings may already be in the debt sprial and people are buying the stock."
Earnings in line with EXPECTATIONS and more revenu ... No reason to go down...again tomorrow we Will see 60$ in regular session
SBUX will bounce harder than it fall.They are buying back and reopening all chinese restaurants.Here one can order online and gets deliveredThe model is working good Gl
"SBUX and DIS are no brainers for reopening plays. Revenues and free cash flow are both massively compressed due to COVID, just imagine the rise in the share price when all that business comes back. Some of the reopening may already be discounted but not all of it. SBUX's FCF at its peak was 9 billion in 2018. I believe it can get back to those levels over time. Long term this is a solid play and anyone who disagrees will get smoked. I made a mistake selling my shares several years ago when it reported six straight flat quarters...I should've known better but I got back in after realizing my mistake and have no plans to sell. SBUX isn't competition free but it has strong brand loyalty amongst its customers and its beverages are widely respected around the world. As a customer myself I am proud to be a shareholder."
"Well, so much for that bogus ""lawsuit"".______________________________________A federal judge has thrown out a lawsuit accusing Starbucks of misleading customers about the ice-to-product ratio of its cold beverages.Ridiculing the plaintiffs and their lawyers who brought the case, the judge said no reasonable adult customer — much less a child — could be deceived by the company’s beverage labeling."
This is going to start the day on a dip and move past $89 tomorrow. The week is going to finish with a bang. New highs are coming.
I bought 150 shares at 21$ 10yrs ago...and I dont even drink coffee and had never gone into any Starbucks stores. Just show me the money
"It's what's going on with china tariffs. Maybe a good buying point,but who knows"
China drinks Lucky Coffee
Hard to maintain these levels that are 20 bucks higher then per crisis a everything is still closed
"Starbucks needs to be like Dutch Bros. Double Drive through.....no bathroom, hot girls in shorts. Anybody who has seen a Dutch Bros in action, can fully understand why StarBucks is closing stores. If Dutch Bros ever goes public.... buy every share you can on day one. My StarBucks shares have a cost basis of under $1.00.....so I can’t sell. But I would trade them tax free for Dutch Bros in a second if I could."
"Everyone on her talks everything except for SBUX, in up 7% on this run.... Let's go $56"

i will never never get rid of SBUX i love this stock ill keep buying every month
"If they dont drink 2 cups of coffee instead of 1, SBUX needs to touch 80 again very soon."
Another haircut coming? Hope so.
"You see when I tell you that we really don't care about earnings ,just look at (SBUX) they didn't make any $$$$ ,but we still pump the stock up cause there was too many puts on the stock ,so we pump the stock up and we got to keep all the premium that you guy paid to protect your shares and after all options expired we just dump the stock ,BBBBOOOOYYYYAAAA"

"Feet on the table...how appetizing. Schultz should order one of his ""partners"" (i.e. barista slaves) to walk outside and slip a comfy red pillow under the gents feet."
"Hey, where did all of BittyBit's ""ALL CAPS RANTS AND RAVES"" disappear to? Did he embarrass himself and erase them? Did he re-read them and have a sudden pang of the ""dumbs""?C'mon out, BittyBit. Display that ""superior person"" intellect for all to see.Hey, TD releases their earnings next month. Will this finally be the month that they cut their dividend, or will it be next quarter?Are you still my favorite geriatric Illiterate DumDum?Yes, yes you are.Hugz."
"Institutions unloading, should see 77 then 70 in a week or two."
72 by end of February
I don’t understand why the Street doesn’t jump aboard with SBUX it gaining more and more sales I only see huge upside in the future and behind 
Is it still a good time to start a position?
Right where this stock belongs. starsuks closing stores. Nothing but sugar water.
own some april and may call options 60 strike go starbucks buy me that new car cash money
will close today at 58
"Brace yourself for good news. We have waited 40 minutes for our orders this morning. There were about 40 people in front of us; however, we all got our red cups. I think this is going to be a record. The majority of the orders ordered with the mobile app."
i expected big gains AH. what is going on?
Short it! Bubble!
"3 upgrades this week and down 4 bucks, makes sense for this market"
This company grows at 10% so this valuation is absurd. How in the world did this stock get to such a high multiple?
"We got a gift of two 20 oz tumblers with Via packages. Ugly, what am I supposed to do with this? Might re-gift to someone who believes in this POS."
"Jim Cramer's charitable trust lightened up on SBUX, citing too high valuation."
sold this coffee bean garbage 2 days ago bought on cramers advice...ill listen to myself next time no more actions alert minus for me
Just opened Facebook and they HATE Starbucks. Millennials of all races standing together. SB taking a hit for this. It’s no longer cool to even have a cup in your hand
https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2018/04/hardly_a_stir_when_starbucks_denied_a_cop.html
how many days of sales were lost during the big power outage in texas ?
Lefty CEO will cost shareholders money in the long run. Time to take the profit and move on from this theatre of the absurd. Please trade accordingly.
"poor little grimster. so infatuated with man on man action, and meanwhile his beloved dunkin stock drops every day. maybe he can have joe eastie console him during these difficult times"
$DNKN raging while $SBUX drips. Might be projected increases in toilet paper and sanitary supplies at Starbucks
"I am a junk food person, but own sbux. Went to a Starbucks this weekend. The food is good, beverages good, environment nice, very busy. With expansion in china I just think this is still a better bet long term. The stock has been over punished. I love mcdonalds, but even with the store remodels, they're just not the same feel as a Starbucks."
In LA many if the local coffee spots are out of biz...SBUX slowly becoming only option
"Don’t be so emotional, watch the Brazil coffee crop"
AMERICA! GREATEST COUNTRY ON THE PLANET!$BAC $WMT $CSCO $NKE $AAPL $SBUX $FB $TWTR
This might go down Monday cuz it jumped unnaturally high today
Any worries about China retaliating against American businesses as these tariffs take hold in two weeks?
Downgraded by PIper today! Already at price target. There goes the momentum we had.
Drinking my daily Starbucks coffee now. So tasty so good
"This stock hasn't moved in 3 years. At this valuation, with that (growing) dividend, and their unparalleled branding power, I'm about ready to buy 500 shares and let it cook for 20 years"
SBUX stock is set on auto pilot just slow and steady upward motion you have to love it great $$$$$. Machine
Starbucks is going to 90 before year-end
SBUX HAS LOST ITS PRICING PRESSURE
CNBC stock
"If the general market has a big rally while SBUX is red or flat, it is all on Schultz."
Bought some Starbucks. New position. Sheep are giving away great companies at discount. Who am I not to take their shares? Long term investing
Starbucks will announce that waiting areas will be added to all stores for people who don't buy anything.
"Over the next 4 months, SBUX will go to 110, then pull back to 100."
After hrs is easy to manipulate. wait for the real market
Just said on fox business starbucks announced 2nd quarter sales in china down 50% WOW!!!!!
looks like Starbucks he's going to break out soon $90 plus coming
"No dine-in policy is great for business. No more cheap-o's buying a tall drip with free refills, spending half a day being an eyesore to other customers, and often leaving a mess. Totally non-PC to say, I know, but it's a fact.I'm also pleasantly surprised by how much foot traffic and drive-thru traffic there has been. BUY!"
Glad I loaded up during discount days.
I’ve seen a lot of boards but this is the craziest
I just dumped all my sbux coffee in the trash along with this stock due to rebellion of CEO against our President!
Shocked that $SBUX is open on Martin Luther King Day.
"The most successful boycott of SBUX is a moderate boycott. I figure that SBUX will lose 35% of my business without it affecting me one bit. I will still go there because they provide me a service that I really want. However, no more gift cards. Instead I will give other local coffee houses my gift card business. Also, when convenient, I will choose the local coffee houses over SBUX. Their coffee is a little better. I don't care about the extra 20 cents I have to pay."
The sad part about Starbucks is--- Everytime Shultz leaves the stock TANKS! History is proof! Purchased Put calls on SBUX and glad I did.
I admit I was wrong because I said Starbucks will disappoint again; maybe now it will get their house in order
"$55...51...49..48...and this is even after the mention of buyback. cannot wait until China devalues their currency, SBUX goes to down $5 in one day if that happens"
"I have a massive position in Jimmy Roger's ETF the, "" RJI. "" $6.05/share. 35 commodities from gasoline to coffee to wool. Pick up 10,000 shares today and hold for 3 to 5 years."
1 French vanilla latte and some SBUX stock please... 
Earnings is 2 dollars a share; give it at best a twenty multiple; this stock should trade at 41
"I drunk SBUX coffee 18 months, I didn't see doctor, I didn't eat any medicine too, I didn't flu shot too, my skin very smooth, my stomach gas distress disappeared, my body strong and healthy, SO I think people who often drink SBUX coffee their health sure be better than others, SO SBUX coffee can long-term drink ,it's stock can long-term buy, SBUX can reach $100,per share."
did we already see bottom with Sbux yesterday?
Anyone knows why people are selling SBUX and buying MCD. They usually are up together.
"I told you to buy starbucks earlier yall, one of the top stocks to buy, 2019, tastes fantastic as well https://pressreleasereviews.com/2019/01/06/starbucks-corp-sbux-technical-analysis/"
I bought this at a bad time(╥﹏╥)
SBUX needs a new CEO if PEP can have one why can't we?
why oh why buy this stockdo your DD they are borrowing money to pay dividendstheir er is going to be worse then expectedthey lost 15mil each time they shut down to do training
Did anyone else just see the share price hit 96.69 +6.66%? We are blessed 
SBUX in my busy neighborhood is CLOSED!...why are so many closed? (no drive through) !...why?
"More time being focused on BUSINESS and lesson social matters,might result in better outcomefor shareholders of SBUX!"
UhhhhhhhhhhStarbucks!
"CEO is ""woke"" = company goes broke!On the bright side, at least SBUX investors who end up homeless will still get to use the free bathrooms."
History shows SBUX will sell off possibly closing gap to $59.00 sometime after this earnings report. Consider market is very jittery now and this is priced to perfection currently.
$65 and climbing.Its now obvious who the better co. is.
Wow! Up we go. Love my Starbucks coffee 
I like sbux pricing power. I want to own this company but it’s too expensive here.
"Ian , I Agree , I Love , Starbuck's , Stock , Their Safe Great , 2.5% , Dividend's , While You Wait For Their Stock Price To Rise To $110.00 To $130.00 , Is Worth The Wait , Starbuck's , Grocery Store's , Product's , Is Starting To Make More Profit's , Then All Their Store's , Both Have Double , Their Profit's , And Now You Can Go In Any Grocery Store , Across The World , And Buy , Starbuck's , Great Product's ; Starbuck's , Stock Price , Will Rise Very Soon ,,"
"What's so appealing to this stock at this price and the headlines? P/E is in the high 30's - time to sell out before the pullback, it's had a nice run."
I guess white bashing didn’t work out so well. Shultz made it a race issue. America is sick and tire of the Obama race card being played. Most people are color blind. It’s the leaders and executives that drag race into the equation.
"Starbucks stock is very much like Disney stock. With all the ups and downs they are both moving sideways overall. Starbucks stopped its upward path in late 2015. This is a stock for short term trading otherwise it's just your money sitting there, dead. Just look at the longer term charts and there is your story, this is no longer about growth."
So apparently the only hate speech Starbucks approves of is hate speech towards Trump and conservatives. Has to be the case because social media has been over run with such hate for nearly four years and Starbicks has been 100g silent. Starbucks is now on my families boycott list.
"If they're smart, shorts will cover now with the drop in price or they will lose their shorts later. Shorts are always nervous and many times desperate because shorting is not investing, it is gambling. They think negative postings will have an effect but there is no negative effect. It just makes them feel better."
"Starbucks management are demo-commie tools. They love to further the democrats FEAR agenda. Thi is NOT a pandemic of any sort. Just an excuse to destroy your life, account balances, tell you where to go, what to do, restrict your movements, and use the media to scare you. Democrats hate this country."
"SBUX is the new CMG....CMG couldnt catch a break with all the illnesses happening at their locations, and the stock tanked hard. Now SBUX seems to be suffering from the same dealio. EVery piece of bad news will be scrutinized and taken out on teh stock price unfortunately."
"local business rebound from February to now after December and January weak, SBUX sales sure be add growth from local businesses rebound, American added crude oil production, gasoline price decline in March, this is very good news for SBUX,"

"Sold too soon , I took profits but was hoping to get back in a little cheaper . I may have to wait for the next bad headline . I am however glad to see the shorts, bashers and bathroom trolls shut up for a change ."
Any Liberal policy is doomed to fail....see you at $20
Oh Kenny Boy my well whipped whipping boy. What a delusional little freakazoid you are after all these years. Huffing and puffing and strutting around like some sort of tough guy. We all know your story son. You are only fooling yourself.
Starbucks will be up surprising numbers after earnings. biggest coffee company in the world with big prices! its like a drug to the average coffee drinker. cult following big UPS on earnings.
Tall vanilla latte is my celebration drink of choice...#SBUX
Ohhhh joeyt where are you?
those why hyped Dnkn coffee can stay there. starbucks is the way to go 75 coming.
New CEO continues to trim costs and increase value for shareholders. Loving this turnaround plan - mostly because it is working!!Starbucks to lay off 350 global corporate employees https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-lay-off-350-global-183825455.html
Red closing today.
"You can’t keep upping wages, benefits like tuition, healthcare for employees who’s only required skill is asking if you want a danish with that..."
Anyone have a clue why the dividend wasn't raised? First time in quite a while and they are doing well. This will be the 5th quarter at $0.36.
more videos showing no go even if you buy something. why are there guards at star bucs?
no sugar
"Some of the longs here claim they park their money in SBUX for dividend? 2% is a dividend? 3-month CD is higher than that and risk free.Why would you want to catch this falling knife?SBUX is now officially associated with the Left, while half of their customers (former) presumably were the wealthy white people that are willing to pay $5 for cofffee, most likely right-wing folks. Yeah, run your mouth, and not run your business. That's how the company got here.BTW, Left hates SBUX too, it's a racist company in their eyes. After all 2 black guys were kicked out. The Right refuses to go there after hearing the CEO reaffirmed the hiring of 10K refugees and his liberal BS.$40's coming you like it or not."
"price goes up, but in low volume.. hmmppplet see how far can it go"
Doubt this will bug the down trend!! Government is QEsing the market for sure! It’s 100% Uncle Sam’s Casino!!
sbux popped up my my 52 high list. just trolling the news to see how many banks upgrade the stock AFTER massive gains have been seen. always funny to watch.
manipulating
25% Global decline in Coke Cola in April. SBUX has to be 75-90% decline. The consumer has dried up being off too long.
Think we'll reach $53 tomorrow?
"SBUX no reason down today, because it's business continue extending."
Smaller cups for the coffee means sbux is hurting@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@Good!!!
Time for another SPLIT!!!!SBUX I bought under $10 and has never disappointed
Sbux will be fine
Kevin Johnson said 90% of stores are reopened in China. Hard to believe everything is just aces there now.
Hey Red SBUX up $1.00+DNKN down $.75
"Hey Kored.If you weren't so boring and pathetic, you'd be amusing.Keep up the mundane work."
"A couple of times, Cramer has vaguely referred to some big plan Kevin Johnson has coming. Any speculation what he's talking about?"
"Over priced, over rated, yes they will be around with less stores. What about China you say, Chinese will go to LK."
"It’s Monday and I gotta go get my woke coffee, home brewed isn’t quite at satisfying"
"the millions SBUX wasted on closing to ""train"" 99.999% of workers who didn't need training is now showing up as lost jobs due to store closings. They could have used those millions to keep many of these stores open so that they could have turned themselves around, now the money has been spent and is not available for these displaced workers, classic example of investing resources on the wrong things"
Coffee is a thing for boomers. Energy drinks
"Study just out from Sweden's University of Bjorn. Results of 30 heavy coffee drinkers denied coffee for only 5 days, and they had to be put in straight-jackets.Study led by Professor Emeritus Nils August Johanson who was Chair of the Nutrition Science."
Why is this stock so expensive? It has a PE ratio of almost 200... I'm just wondering how much more room Starbucks has to grow? Maybe into more countries as they become more developed as well as the younger generations love of Starbucks coffee. A 200 PE ratio means that it will take 200 years for Starbucks to generate a profit that equates to their market cap. Can Starbucks profit increase enough yoy to justify a 200 PE?
Anybody know of a stock website where normal people can have intelligent conversations?This thread seems to be dominated by high schoolers.
my daughter. works at one she says money good for last quarter I bought call options 60 strike
"One million vending machines worldwide vs. physical stores occupied by all day bums, the unemployed and smartphone charging people. This is a no brainer. Look, spending customers only want the caffeine, sugar and milk on the fly. Face it, Caffeine is a legal drug."
try and short it.
Starbucks in China increasing sales.. I believe next quarter should be up..So bought some here if goes lower cost avg in play..Bullish
always have long queue at my local starbucks
will China retaliate against US companies doing business in China in light of recent legislation against Chinese stocks?
Be over 80 tomorrow
"Relax, it’s a temporary problem."
See you at 45 and changeYou cannot justify this stock price.SELL
"REMEMBER.... SBUX was a $50 stock 16 months ago (and always well below that for last 20 years). In 13 months, it DOUBLED to $100 PPS! Ask yourself what this company did to double its value in that short amount of time..... Maybe everybody was just hyped up on the quick profit caffeine rush!"
"wow, dnkn missed big because of falling sales and the stock is tanking."
Why we know Howard quit as a CEO because he saw it as a sinking ship and the company got a new loan on its ballooning debt. To make it worse Moddy downgrades made it worse.
$DNKN outperforming $SBUX as per usual. Capitalism still appreciated at $DNKN
I can see few downgrade coming over next few days by analysts.
"I asked this back when SBUX was 77, but I'll ask it again. How does this company go up every day? For this to go up 10% in a month is ridiculous. The only way they grow is by raising prices. Is it just momentum investing at this point?"
This stock is a joke Manipulation Nation. Out
Starbucks reached an all time high at 102.01
How about Goldman’s fake downgrade?
"Boycott this leftist maggot of a company. Buy your coffee somewhere else, or save some serious coin and make it at home."
If this drops below 50 it could see a big drop. I’m looking to buy at a bigger dip. The new ceo likes money.
STRABUCKS is the leader but nothing wrong with playing second LK ...lK JUST BLEW OUT EARNINGS
The bottom is far away and this will be an awesome deal
The SBUX shorts will be smiling at the opening bell Monday!
"Joe Terranova on CNBC just gave SBUX a .40 cents shot in the arm. Said he bought it this morning. If you are a bear you cannot be particularly thrilled by todays action. It looked like it might break into the $76s for a few minutes, but buyers swarmed in."
"I agree what about 10,000 people that live in the core why don't they hire them is he really for his country"
"Looks like it holding strong at 112-113, it should slowly climb back to $116-118 some time this week. With the US target to reopen July, and coffee is a must thing, earning is not the best but still showing very strong, I am holding it and bought some more today."
My Starbucks coffee smells so good
The President of China has just asked Howard Shultz for help to mend US/China relations. It shows all investors the respect Starbucks has in China.
SBUX JULY 26 HIGH $99.72CLOSE TODAY $96.30$3.70 TO $100.00 
"Who shorted at 70, 71,72?"
"Americans like sugar water like Starbucks, Coke and McDonald's. Personally I think McDonald's $1 iced coffee is good enough."
Buy and hold SBUX forever.
Balloon Stock
"Any idea why SBUX is down today, while market up nicely? Is it the Teavana news about judge telling them they Have to keep some stores open?Thanks,Gearhead"
Massive pricing power here. Love it
"Sorry I didn't go to the Halloween party which you never gave me the time of. Really didn't want to climb over blowup people, be besmirched, called bad names"
buy back can not maintain sp price down
"$50 is a good entry point, it will come to this, Mark it."
all stores closed in my area.
this seems to be a great hold
Typical negative articles and scare comments and sell offs leading to the next big move upwards
Shultz today on good morning America promised to open stores in undesirable areas. Let’s see out that works during the round of riots
HAHAHAHA...look at the shorts on this board. They are so full of righteous indignation! Learn how the stock market works and then pop off. You are the same people who have been screaming to short the entire market since 2009.
Buffet said be prepared to lose 50% of anything you invest in and he does not see any compelling equities for investment. He did say don't bet Against America and eventually the recovery will come but went into a 1929 comparison and it didn't recover until 1954. So SBUX should be up in 25 years.
For anyone on here actually interested in Starbucks...interesting fact - Tilray Cannabis just announced a previous Starbucks executive as their head of retail sales. Interesting to ponder what impact the future of cannabis infused beverages might bring to the market.
forming a nice base here at 83$ although i was hoping for base at 84$
"FINANCIAL CRIME By Ashley Stewart – Staff Writer, Puget Sound Business Journal an hour agoStarbucks Corp. paid Executive Chairman Howard Schultz nearly $18 million in 2017, according to the proxy statement the company recently filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Schultz's base salary decreased to $1 from $1.5 million when he stepped down as CEO in April. Former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson took over as CEO then, marking the Seattle-based coffee chain's transformation into a technology-driven business.Starbucks reported $21.8 million in compensation to Schultz for fiscal 2016.The tech transformation started with the development of Starbucks' mobile payments technology, which helped the company built a ""moat"" around itself in the struggling retail business. The company is testing a cashless store concept in downtown Seattle.Schultz's compensation also included a 60 percent increase in personal security, to $325,000.New Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Rosalind Brewer, who was announced in September, will have an annual"

"AMRN is the best buying opportunity for significant stock runup, as per Matthew Lohr.Selling SBUX would be a big mistake good for a $10 pt. pop."
Could it be unsuspecting new investors being robbed?
"in USA cities, Starbucks always has customers standing in line. China will be no different. Revenue will grow big time, just wait for it."
Corona virus just messed up the move higher! I’ll be back for you Starbucks!
"Why SBUX surging? Top Mgmt. has read here my idea for the new business model. Permanently close all seating areas. Walk up and drive-thru only. Operating margins will surge. People don't care how they get their caffein and sugar fix. It is a drug, and they will be happy with it coming out of a window. Employees will be happy with no indoor customers. K"
"Starbucks it’s just a coffee shop how difficult is to replicate a coffee shop. China is stealing complex semi’s and chips, and you think they will not replicate Starbucks. Good Luck!!!"
How low will it go?
where is my dividend? i thought we get paid on 20th
SBUX is going to get crushed in China. ￼
Drive thru’s doesn’t prevent contagious covid 19Starbucks CEO is Clueless!My Gawd!
Are y’all seeing this?
Dunkin Donuts tastes way better.
I am with a lot of people on here. SBUX is a great stock however this virus might last a while and even when there is a vaccine it will take a while for 335 million people to receive it. I think the best play here is just sit it out and let it come to you. Also I want testing on a broad scale so we know what we are dealing with
There’s no way the SEC news can justify a drop below the 50 day ma. Seems more like an overreaction. This is a buying opportunity for people as it rebounds.
"Subtle product placement (GOT), well done SBUX"
i just bought 10 more call contracts ! Today is a gift to load up some more!
"I already opened a small postion. I will double or triple down if it goes much lower. Nobody can tell the bottom, dip buy, average cost great companies (large cap)."
"This will be at 55$ within 2 weeks . Great company but not for now. I'll short or trade some put spreads and buy it back at 50-55 in a few weeks, actually I prob won't buy until after next report . Either way this will lose 20+ % very fast"
"HOWARD SCHULTZ says he is shocked that TRUMP won...WELL, DEAL WITH IT!!AMERICANS ARE SHOCKED HE HAS THE NERVE TO CHARGE $5.00 FOR A LOUSY CUP OF COFFEE !"
Starbucks should have never changed their reward program. They upset their loyal customer base
Watching SBUX
I like sbux’s new reward program. More flexible and it allows me to redeem coffee and bakery items faster. 
$DNKN gains again out ahead of $SBUX and the public restrooms they espouse.
"the key word here would have been ""temporarily"". That would have eased the chicken #$%$ who sold. every article I read just says closed 2,000 stores. Well, that sounds permanent instead of temporary. Big difference."
Good luck when they want to go pray every half hour. That is what many company's are running into and then CAIR gets on thier #$%$ if they don't allow it
buying opportunity
$70 in predicted future. The disaster of the coronavirus just begins.
I can't post Yahoo police deleting my posts
"Ah Guys... This is a 49 dollar a share stock. I went in and no restrooms, no seating, just high priced coffee and THEY wanted to put in the sugar and cream themselves! I'm outta here. Tell me when it reaches 49 a share."

I purposely protests and have not bought a cup of Starbucks coffee for two months nor have I bought gift cards or accessories that I used to for my relatives and family period starting to really enjoy the smaller private coffee shops around town period I will not support the hiring of people that hate our country verses veterans. I sold Starbucks at $59 will never buy the stock again. God Bless America and our veterans. your only strength protesting is with your dollars spend it on local coffee shops.
I’ll buy when it reaches the 30s
They can’t even maintain a simple app
Starbucks needs to sign Kaepernick to prove they are woke...
Just bought SBUX for first time yesterday at $53.17. I’m also very long on AMD.
Run for the Hills
Let's be realistic.. There is no way Starbucks should be in mid 70s considering there is no revenue over last 4-6 weeks and probably into the next 8 weeks. I am happy to hold and buy any dip under 65 dollars. I will stay patient until then
This dog
I know I cannot wait to meet a buddy at Sbux for a coffee or a in person meeting
"I’m shorting $sbux , much better short than this. Expecting a bad earnings."
"$40 coming very soon, no one has money left to buy the fancy coffee , buy Necafe and Tasters choice . SELLLLLL"
let's see that long over due short squeez now
Plan to add 20k stores by 2030. Snowflake college grads will be able to get a lot of jobs.
If we have finish red today -150 or more we will break support for DJIA on 1 hour. Brace for impact. New York and other states just announced they are not opening until May 15th. Not looking good right now.
Made it through 100! Let’s go!
Coffee is losing it's steam....literally !!
tomorrow another leg up!
squeeze em
Yes Sir everything will be just fine. 10M unemployment claims last two weeks. sounds like a problem for 5.00 coffee.
Up 0.26% today wohooo! Can’t even beat the market what a bearish stock it is..
"Sold all of my shares today @ $57,50. Management and I were not on the same track. Good Luck to everyone!!"
$35 or lower.
Starbucks rally!!! Who’s with me?
wonder if this is a good entry point or should wait more
Mid-cap company with 6% is a gift
what a massive bear trap. As if someone wanted cheap shares
"come out, come out, wherever you are and have a cupa coffee"
Starbucks will crush it tommorow
"Uhh,,, I'll have a Grande Flat white.No sir, our risk management team has taken that off the menu for legal reasons."
"Short term traders like actions and most have very little patience. For long term investors and people that have the patience to wait, there is a high probability to buy into $SHAK at $15. For sure some would argue that the $15 price is ridiculous. I could be wrong, but the future will prove itself. When $CMG was around $750 in 2015, people also argued it could not possibly drop to $250, but it did. When $SBUX was at $40 in 2006, people also argue that it would not drop to $8, but it did. When $HABT was around $40 at IPO, people also argued it would not drop to $10, but it did. These are just a few examples, there are hundreds of other examples of ridiculously over pricing."
Why isn't jumping to 60 yet? Is someone nailing it?
"dunkin coffee #$%$, tastes like folgers. SBUX good coffee, good company run by morans or moran. get rid of liiberals morans, company will come back again"
SHORTING MORE
Is SBUX eyeing ACB?
SBUX reaches over half of its goal to hire 10000 US Veterans and their spouses! DNKN pledges to sell some of it's franchises to Indian veterans if they can get a loan.
"We closed above the 10, 20, & 50 day moving average. Blue skies ahead."
"If you're looking for a cup handle, here it is. China will get a grip on the coronavirus and SBUX will bounce back, perhaps up 10% depending how long it takes. $104 in 6 months."
Greedy companies using Bailout money to buy stocks instead of preparing for debt and other needs
"Honestly, I see little value in going to Starbucks unless their dining is open. It's nice to meet people, especially when they have BOGOs, otherwise I'll probably stay away. Long Term is probably much better for them"
China and the CEO is a cartoon character
"Starbucks to Shareholders ""If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38% you got last year, it’s a free country,"" he continued. ""You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company. Thank you very much."""
Don't tell anyone but being home and making my own coffee I realized that my coffee is much better then the one at starbuck!! One way I will save money in the future...
$15 coffee in SF when minimum wage is $15! Hey not one ever accused the mass population of being smart! They don’t know they are working a whole hour for $0.25 worth of coffee in a fancy $0.05 cup... lol
Having Starbucks coffee now
"fun fact, this stock had the same price three years ago lol"
Big beat!
Goldman’s Downgrade will help put more juice on the short sqeeze tommorow!!!!! Yeahhhh
Leaning far to one side politically. Allowing non-customers to hang out and use the restrooms. Not the best business plan for a high end coffee shop.
I don't know about you but the starbucks all near me in Center City Philadelphia are always PACKED!! I'm buying and buying and buying. Starbucks will be fine.
Up whopping 15 cents
See ya later shorts
the quidance will prove to be conservative. pick your day and buy this stock
"There is a little gem company worth checking out right now. Strong financials, corporate team, and at a great entry non-inflated place to purchase. After hours is popping right now on great earnings."
"Starbucks is now the public restroom. I never shop at Starbucks because I don't like their coffee and it's too expensive. But I'm glad to hear that I am welcome to use their restrooms. I often go jogging and often it's hard to find a restroom when I need one but there are a lot of Starbucks along my route. Thanks to SBUX, I won't have to risk getting shot using the bushes of some of these hardcore homeowners along the way. Thanks SBUX!"
luckin coffee in china still has no profit.. will be brushed away by starbucks soon and they will have the big china market all to themselves !
"If this current price trend continues, it would not suprise me if there was a buyout offer. Maybe taken private."
sentiment for SBUX is buying hehehehe
I guess forward guidance isn’t required during a pandemic. 5/17 42.50 diamond hands
They flopped from penetrating Australia and so many other countries... the US presence is all that keeps the company afloat and that market is saturated with no more growth.
I'm guessing they are closing the stores where people only come in to use the john and score some free wifi.
Big pull back as I called today. Made easy money. Thank you very much.
"SBUX still young ,it's sales still growing, SO it's stock worth support."
2 weeks before this stock is above $100.
I believe Starbucks must be badly managed and has losses from employes mismanaging the food

Once the economy reopens SBUX will soar. Take advantage of these price levels while they are here.
"National Boycotts of SBUX, Nordstrom's, and underway. No one hates like the left. Disney is siding with Soros who is paying $1,500 a day to each individual to start violence on American college campuses, thwarted free speech, destroying property and promoting violence, and starting fights at Trump rallies during the campaign.Wrong choice Disney, SBUX, and Nordstrom's!!!"
"if book value is negative, where a company's liabilities exceed its assets, this is known as a balance sheet insolvency."

"I can't wait for my neighborhood Starbucks to reopen. Just walking there for a cup of coffee takes me away from my ""work from home"" routine. Actually, I'm might walk there twice a day."
Commodity Coffee prices are down about 18% from a year ago $1.22 down to 1.03 . That should prove a large positive for Starbucks.
Getting closer to pre-earning price. Great stock. Long and see consistent gains!
SBUX will be over $100 before years end.
Tired of their flavor. No SBUX for me.
Starbucks in a revenue death spiralPrice increases accelerate volume declines faster can’t make the numbersNo growth soon to be negative = PE 8

I wonder if Starbucks will let the employees wear ALM or WLM pins too?
where do analysts get .72 from? Last year the EPS was only .62. Did they do a lot of stock buybacks or something?
International alert.  Guadalajara. Mexico. I saw at least 5 Starbucks locations at the airport alone and I probably missed seeing one or two. There are also locations all around Mexico's 2nd largest city and they were all busy. Way to go Starbucks!

"COMPARE SBUX drinks price others coffee stores drinks price, almost same, but SBUX drinks are better than them,SO SBUX won't lose customers, opposite, SBUX can get their customers, MCD coffee are baddest in the world, SO MCD coffee sell $1.00 nobody drink, MCD ice cream are baddest in the world too, nobody eat, it's taste awful, some coffee stores and ice cream stores face to face with MCD, their very busy in summer, but MCD only some people eating food .SO cheap drinks won't hurt SBUX."
"While Sanctuary $SBUX mires in mediocrity, $DNKN rises up and give the people what they want--coffee and food, not socialism."
Up because of its own 2023 guidance? Sounds shady.
Down she goes. I love it when Dunkin beats down starshits.
"SBUX coffee are very healthy drinks, long-term drink can keeping your healthy, it can save a lot of money for HUMAN'S health, why world's health care cost rise every year???because people drinking too much unhealthy drinks, such as: KO, PEP, MCD coffee, DNKN coffee and others coffee and sodas, these drinks endanger HUMAN'S healthy, SO these drinks sales will decline in future, SO SBUX coffee healthy drinks will take their market share, SBUX sales will continue growth, SBUX: $100.00 per share point day can wait."
I heard SBUX is going to issue a 10 for 1 split and a 33 dollar div.
"Hey Grimmikins, it's Mother's Day this coming Sunday. Don't forget to gift your sainted Mother with your presence on that day to thank her for allowing you to move back in with her after having failed at adulthood. Thank her for your meals, the roof over your head and rescuing you from destitution and dereliction. Take her somewhere nice to show her just how much you appreciate her. Then sit your skinny little #$%$ down at your regular table and send her up to the counter to buy you your usual. After all, her pension check is your pension check. Afterwards, give Docta Dums a jingle. My wife and I will be out again this weekend, so if yourself, BittyBit and his pet goat Leroy want to use our place for your menage-a-trois, you're welcome to it. Just lock up on your way out and clean up Leroy's leavings. Put them in a doggybag for BittyBit. If the alarm goes off, just remind them that BittyBit is an ex-law enforcement official. Show them his stun gun. That'll convince them. (Did Bitty ever run that length of yarn up through the arms of his oversized motorcycle jacket so that he can't drop his stun gun?)."
"PE 191, too high"
"I didn’t take a short position before earnings, but I’m disappointed. Was hoping for a big miss and fall to $75. Either way, congrats to the longs!"

"They pull people from burning cars. They stop people who are shooting other people.They stop people from speeding. They stop people who are driving drunk.They stop people from giving drugs to your kids.And Starbucks employees treat these fine people like dirt.

starbucks will survive this pandemic as it has huge amounts of cash.
I hear Dunkin’ is kicking $SBUX all over the country. Nothing new.
SBUX reached a new 52 Week High at $62.56
"sbux sales can keeping continue growth, because low income people afford it now in USA, and some worldwide just beginning, sbux will new high continue,"
He's gotta go.
"SBUX no reason down, because all coffee stores and restaurants sales looks rebound in February, plus all sodas price rise 8% in supermarkets in this winter, candy and beer price rise too, the groceries stores sales too weak,plus store rent fee rise 8%, SO business man need rise things price to offset lose, these are very good news for SBUX."
Why does $DNKN always outperform $SBUX ? Would appreciate your stock advice.
"Hey Red SBUX up twice as much as the PRIDE Of The Punjab,"
Monday will be brutal. Depending if USA lockdown this weekend it will be worse.

"Maryland closing stores but some people are working around it by going to VA,DC. VA will soon close starbucks & gyms as a way to prevent people from traveling."
Short this to 55 and start buying. Easy money
I commented on the growth of Starbucks and I would like to respond to the criticism; Chinese growth can never be assumed as certainty; most of the domestic growth is from high prices ; I LIKE STArBUCKS long term but it's PE needs to come down and the stock needs to approach 50 in my opinion to be attractive; having said that if you are really long term investor you can buy the company ; safe and good but a little bit expensive
SBUX is down 6.94% to 54.00
Let more people use your bathrooms. That’ll help!!!
"Starbucks will now have to deal with every lowlife homeless character wandering in, using their restrooms and sleeping on the furniture. The CEO is an idiot for pandering to loiterers. He doesn't realize the pandora's box that's just been opened. Good luck with all the future lawsuits losers!"

"Short $SBUX, i expect it to miss earning by bigger % and announce worse than expected gudiance."
zi=tart
SBUX and LK will be great due to China sales but LK market cap is cheap as they expand also in India and Mideast.
"Real tug of war between the bulls and the bears. For the bulls, green is better than red and SBUX out performed the market all day. Volume remains slightly elevated but nothing to write home about. For the bears the bulls failed at the 15 DMA for the second day in a row and gave up almost all gains which were quite substantial a couple of hours ago. Tomorrow? Who can say? The market seems to me to be rolling over. It is being held up by five large cap names that are out performing the rest of the market. If they pull back even a little we are headed 5% lower. I could be wrong, that is what makes a market."
look at it after hours. the doors will be open soon.
"I guess the non-paying customers are taking seats, and not spending money...... Not a great business plan. Looks like Schultz screwed the new management team"
This thing is trash.
I became obese in one month after drinking a Starbucks Latte everyday. pure poison
With the pandemic the days of the $7 latte are history. People have changed their habits of overspending on hyped coffee. No growth and no profits.
I've been in Starbucks since 2008let the good times roll
Starbucks is going over 80 buy year end
No surprise. Years of raising prices are finally catching to SBUX. You can increase sales and foot traffic by raising price duh!Consumers have other choices like making your own coffee for pennies instead to paying $5 to $9 bucks for a cup of coffee
I sold thisdog. Bunch of foreigners waiting on you and half can't speak English. Coffee is overpriced and taste like dishwater. Dunkin' Donuts and McDonald's better coffee and cheaper. Besides I hate the  flaming liberal management.
"People not working or out and about on the way to work, nor traveling in airports with many Starbucks. New stay at home world will bring SBUX back to reality"
7-11 COFFEE is a good substitute. Hire American Vets !
Shultz sell his shares. Makes you a cash rich billionaire? no one on earth has that much cash except El Chapo. BS politics.
"I knew SBUX coffee, SO I drink SBUX coffee, I knew SBUX under value, SO I bought SBUX, l buy SBUX coffee, SO l knew it's business, SO I don't sell SBUX. l will buy more SBUX if I have money,"
8M shares traded ..lots of buying is happening ..
And here comes the downturn to retest $56/57
How soon after the dividend is paid 25th can I sell my stock? I'm after better dividends than what Starbucks is offering.
BROOM CLOSET WILL BE READY FOR THODE WHO FAIL TO SHUT THEIR BIG MOUTHS!!!

"""Starbucks to lay off 350 global corporate employees""That shouldn't happen to a company run by socialists that don't believe in capitalism...."
"SBUX should be between $100-$105 in 6-8 months, given its historic ranges in forward and trailing p/e, in earnings growth, and where we are now after a 15% pullback. The chart shows a bottom and the beginning of another run upward. China's 6% GDP growth isn't a concern, and will only get better when Trump is gone."
McDonald's has better coffee than Starbucks. Seriously.
buy buy buy
I don't think the boycott against Starbucks is working as I have not been to one that wasn't packed with people
Sell Fancy coffee...One Latte-Cappu-Frappu-Chino-Ice-Cold-Water on your head please
"SBUX has some growth potential, but would wait to see how the coronavirus situation plays out here (what's the impact on the Chinese market). Also, I'm concerned about the company's long term financial stability. Margin is getting thinner. Without the tax decrease the company wouldn't be generating more operational cash flow than in 2017. So I think a tax increase would hit the company hard. I'm very interested in how the company will pay back the current liabilities this year without having much cash (both current and quick ration fell below 1). I don't really understand the rational behind buying shares back when the P/E ratio was around 30... and doing that on debt and sacrificing the majority of its cash reserves. Without the buyback, EPS would've been 10% lower. So what will the company do to pay pack the current liabilities? Issue shares on dropped price that it bought back when it was more expensive last year? Or issue even more bonds and increase it's debt/asset to 50+%? How is this company planning to grow in a sustainable way? What is that I don't see, which is making everyone suggest to buy?"
I'll hold my short until $55

Is SBUX going to close red or green tomorrow?
this liberal company needs to let people in it's stores again
Switching to a better coffee? Anything but Starbucks.

"Sbux needs TOMZ!!!Great news!!!!SteraMist solution orders have increased significantly in 2020.With the increase in demand for our decontamination technologies, our BIT solution sales have surged significantly throughout several divisions including Hospital-Healthcare, Life Sciences and the TOMI Service Network (TSN). TOMI’s revenue model is heavily driven by recurring BIT solution usage by clients and service providers, providing a consistent and predictable revenue stream over time.This growth is partly a result of the recent registration of SteraMist on the EPA’s List N for SARS CoV-2 efficacy and the use of SteraMist on N95 masks and other PPE to assist in the decontamination and reuse of protective equipment in short supply. Year to date, BIT solution sales have increased by approximately 1000% compared to the prior year."
"MM thought this was a V receovery now they see from earning it will be a long recovery. They all say the same thing which is a lie.

That is the lie as they know the stabilized numbers, but it is so low they dont want to use it as guidance."

Do I need to convert my keyboard to auto over-punctuation?Do I need a large, imaginary black friend? Do I need to post about grave desecration, strange mano-a-mano fantasies, cylindrical objects, nets and cells?

If SBUX is closing stores due to the pandemic where will all the homeless people hangout and take a bath? This seems unfair.
Bought a 1000 at 56.60 why do these Trump loons hate SBUX I don't understand.

So much for an AH pop..
SBUX in play. Looking for breakout at 58.89. Target: 68.78.
man people are all over the place from sell to buy to holdmore bearish sentimentwonder where this goes next week
Really SBUX up only 7 cents while DNKN up 23 cents. Doesn't make sense. Can SBUX cliimb up and stay at it's highs for once
SHORT THIS SHORT IT LOVE IT DUBM CEO
If the world ends and stocks sell off I’m ok with it as long as I have coffees
"all sodas 12oz ×12cans up $0.5 in January in supermarkets, SO SBUX drinks price have more room to rise, SO buy SBUX won't make MISTAKES, SBUX sales sure be continue growth"
Long prolonged selling as the virus spreads and this thing grinds downward. Only down 16% or so off high
Are the stores being closed mostly being used as homeless shelters? I would challenge the media to see how many of these 150 stores are in lower income markets
starbucks like the state of NJ. pricing people out.
Thoughts on a Canopy-Starbucks deal? $CGC $SBUX

Sell!
"What possible metric could be looked at to warrant buying SBUX at 200 PE? I get the fact that money is cheap right now and Starbucks is a good company, but this is truly insane."
"buy it now, you'd be glad you did"

Is anyone here concerned with 0.5 EPS and 200 PE?
say what you want...but every time I pass by my neighborhood starbucks there is always a long line of cars.
Sell now. This quarter barely deals with US slowdown
Rumor has it that SBUX refused to pre-warn on earnings so Goldman Sachs had no choice but to take them down.
I see this going to drop to around 57.00 for sure before morning.
3 bad earnings in a row. How much longer can they be forgiven?
Coffee next to oil is the most traded commodity on this planet. Almost as valuable as a damn resource. This is a great investment
SBUX is down 4.94% to 78.31
This is a sick market reminds me of 1999. This market trying to digest possible inflation and bubble possibilities in some stocks so we are in for some unsettled times and yes the national debt and yes the big tax credits that Trump says will trickle down to spur growth. I've heard that before oh yeah that trickle down ended up overseas. The good part is that Starbucks has been resilient when considering this volatility. Then their future growth will be Asia so trickle down will work into their favor. Don't you just love GOP's trickle down now we should call it Trickle Down 2.
Still long line at my local Starbucks 
They are saying that people are buying store label brands a lot more than ususal. Do you think they are running to Starbucks. Coke fell more on that news than Starbucks? Who buys Starbucks in a depression
"3/4"" sheet of Plywood at Home Depot is $87.00"
GLORIOUS! Still can't believe got this at $50 last year. Aint capitalism grand?
holy cow! what just happened!
And congrats to all you long term owners! I wish I had bought this and held 15 years ago too! Let it go way way too soon

CEO pulling usual corporate speak schtick. Not convincing
Hard to believe that $SBUX is sponsoring the Republican National Convention in 2020. I thought $DNKN would.

"Imagine how much starbucks would make if they sold their coffees for $3.00-$3.50 instead of $5.00-$6.00.Broaden your customer base, encourage current customers to buy twice as many, and you will make mucho more denaro."
"With tea market being untapped, huge coffee growth continuing in China, and India expansion at its infancy, there is tremendous room for growth for Starbucks. It can easily break above $100 billion market cap soon..."

"Up 10% on puts , plan on holding until lunch tomorrow. Never hold options through earnings especially since the second earnings comes out the volatility drops causing options prices to drop."
The sheep sit in the cars at drive thrus everywhere in ohio. Buy for long term great brand loyalty high no matter what they want their latte makes them feel good.
Selling SBUX Monday. Company not going in the right direction in customer relation. Will they wear Merry Christmas t-shirts in December? Good bye Starbucks!! It’s been a nice ride.
After all the talk about Starbucks after that phony earnings report. .. A profit warning for 2020.
JUST WENT LONG AFTER THE CLOSE AT $56.00...WISH ME LUCK !!!!
is the virus real ? or a Dem hoax ?because if it's real then SBUX will get killed as soon asthey pass it on to a customer who went thru the drive thru
SBUX is never going to stop going up it’s so strong  it’s selling mass amount of coffee beans like huge pallets of coffee all week at BJ’s they can’t keep it on the shelf
Mara straight to ten then a placement
"NOSE Dive. they can only keep the share price up if they keep buying back, that money will soon be gone and we will see $50 very soon"
"I ask again; why do we need these stores? For bums? As a stockholder, I want doors locked at 5,000 locations by December 31st. We only need drive thru.I can attest that all locations I go into are full of bums, because I am one of them. Like them - I sit and charge my phone, use the bathrooms , get free re-fills, enjoy free heat and air conditioning - and free water. Many spend several hours in one location, and then they spend a few hours in another location."
"buy SBUX, KO and MCD won't lose money forever, this 3 kings stock sure be rise to over history high,make stock money and get dividend."
I apologize I was wrong!!!!
Starbucks is down 4.91% to 99.55
Strong support at $54
"SBUX business updated have been finished, it's sales continue growth, shopping mall closed and traffic decline can't stop it's sales growth, on line shopping growth very strong can't stop people drink it's coffee too , SBUX coffee can crossing the world, SO this time is very good chance to buy, don't miss it."
The selling is far from over. Most companies don’t have just one bad quarter. Plus stores in China could become a political victim
"I worked a fast food restaurant back in the 80's that was frequented by bums, weirdos, teens, drunks and just about anyone else you can think of because of our location. We never had a problem throwing anyone out and if they got tough we got tough right back or we called the cops. You what the difference between then and now is. We did not encourage people to loiter in the place then made when wouldn't buy something. This is SBUX's fault all the way. Sell."
shorts have been quiet today
"Stock is trading at a 200 P/E right now. Insane. LOVE the company, but if youre buying at these prices, good lord."

Anyone know why the stock price took a jump about halfway thru the after hours session? Cut the loss in half.Gearhead

People go with what they know. People know and have had a great experience and coffee at starbucks for years. That's why it will never fail.
Internal reorganization plus reduction of admin costs just one more positive that will create value for shareholders.
"Congrats SBUX, I thought the good ole days were over. But they can still show solid growth with a >10,000 store operation!"
PE is 27 for TTM. Earnings will be down compared to TTM. What is the math that makes you bullish here? Aren't we a year away from anything significant happening here?
wow i can't believe my eyes sbux is ripping. been watching it for months took a small position at 76.75 wish i bought more i had nothing but good things to say about it. i don't even go there for coffee i just know its a solid company that will rise
Still overvalued considering the price from 2008 crisis time frame.

Now, MOST of their stores are in ASIA everywhere you go there is one of those stores. I have a feeling this is what is starting to happen with SBUX. Little by little they are closing US stores and concentrating in Asia"

I just got back from 10 days in Spain and Italy. There are so many coffee and pastry shops there but I was surprised not to see very many Starbucks. Why not? There is a large Starbucks you see when you arrive at the Barcelona airport but hard to find any elsewhere. Lots of local ma and pa establishments and regional companies. Looks like more market potential there but I don't know the barriers to entry. I'm sure Starbucks does. China is the country always being mentioned.

It's all good that the CEO and CFO left; they were making filthy amount salary basically doing nothing! That's a saving in admin cost. SBUX should be find here on out. Buy Hold and Profit. GLTA.
Finally doing something positive ! Back to paper straws.

sell the new highs unless very strong volume
Starbucks going up settle around 52.50 next earnings up more.

"We all know earnings will not be what we are use to. But you still see those drive through pick ups 12 cars deep all day long. They are still bringing in money!!! Their international business is doing good, i would no be surprised to see Starbucks make a play for Luckin in China at their current share price at $2.50 even if they offered $5.00 to $10.00 a share they would gain all those assets and at the same time wipe out the competition in China. Luckin in being held for some reason, possibly Starbucks making a hostile takeover? Any Thoughts"
Starbucks inside of most Target retailers near me. I expect the new Ulta partnership/ inside stores will boost Target AND starbucks for a long time to come.
Starbucks have beat the earnings quarters in a row. Not hard to guess what is waiting for it this quarter since all restaurant stocks released bad earnings.
"SBUX really tries to appeal to the millennials, but the execution is poor and backs fire. I still remember the commitment to hire 10K refugees, well, why not hire unemployed Americans? Now the CEO wants to come out and apologize? Ok, SBUX is now the new homeless shelter. As a company, the revenue is really just saturating, the only strategy the company has is to sell different drinks constant and overpriced coffees.As a potential investor, I'm holding back because I do not like what the company stands for, it's all about politics and not about their customers."
"Earnings per share: 61 cents, adjusted, vs. 55 cents expected Revenue: $6.75 billion vs. $6.93 billion expected"
No doubt in my mind Starbucks will hit $200. I don’t care what anybody says.
C’mon $100 then it’s time to sell and buy back at the dip
"Does anyone know how many stores are still open thru the drive thru? Bought a few shares today after seeing the increased massive traffic jams 3 times a day, day after day. It seems people are still going there but now everyone is in the drive thru. If my local store is any indication of thw whole, then today's price will end up being a bargain.

DNKN gain % today is 3X that of SBUX
The most sheep on one board award
The coffee is an amazing product everyone in the world enjoys it SBUX is going to march up into the $90’s by year 2020
All I can say is get in while it’s hot
What else are they selling besides sugar water?
Why does it always take 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee when there are 3 customers and 6 or 7 Starbucks employees?
"To The CEO of Starbucks, I would like to recommend a stock price split for Starbucks. I think a $25 or $30 some dollar price tag seems a lot more attractive to a buyer than a $60 one. How bout it, to spur some buying action for this stock? :) Sincerely,Angela Brightwell, shareholder (would love to have double the shares, see)"
"TGT sales strong growth, people go out more, that is good news for SBUX,"
All your short will be
They cooked the books!!!
Happy day.;-) glad I got some profits
Never listen to the Najerian brothers; one week ago at 58 said buy Starbucks; all they do is watch the options trends; they don’t know anything about company fundamentals; I agree it is time for this ceo to exit; we are tired of excuses and mismanagement; all the ceo does is sell his shares high and blames everybody else
Best thing at SBUX: Get a free Frappucinno (LARGE ~ Low Sugar) on your birthday! Who else does that?
"they are building store every 15 hours in china, and the growth is 10 percent . thats huge."
The worst coffee ever. starshits is losing to Dunkin donuts.The coffee machine at shop-rite has better coffee then starshits.And the stock price proves it. ha hahahahah hahah hahahaha.
Q2 sell off of the market will be worst than the current one. No one is listening or really cares that earnings will be horrible. Good luck in 2020.
Make Starbucks great again.

Have the published a list of closing stores? I'm curious if they're 'skid row' stores.
Stop buy Starbucks coffee from now ...
$SBUX don't make anything proprietary. Most restaurants everywhere serve coffee and food and they also have tables and chairs WIFI and restrooms.
"how good is SBUX coffee???I finished 1 cup 10oz usually takes 5 to 10 minutes, DNKN and others. I finished it usually takes 10 to 30 minutes, sometimes I can't finish it, coke soda 12oz, I finished it usually takes 10 to 30 minutes, sometimes I can't finish it,,"
starting to build a nice base here at large volume ..we should see 88$ soon
Why not take it further....a Safe Zone for illegals?
Earnings a lot better than their coffee
"They will lose a lot of stores. If the economy goes into deep recession, they will lose many stores as no one will have money to pay for overpriced bitter coffee."
"And to think I’ve been waiting for a real pullback for a long time.... every time I pass near a Starbucks I tell my girlfriend, this is my biggest regret for not investing."
what happened at the end of the day today that looks strange
"Taking on huge debt and spending it on propping up share price:::Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) announced today the closing of an underwritten public offering of $500 million of 2.200% senior notes due 2020 and $500 million of 3.750% senior notes due 2047.The company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of Starbucks common stock under the company’s ongoing share repurchase program and payment of dividends."

"SBUX coffee fresh will leading forever, because SBUX have enough customers, SO SBUX can make fresh coffee, others don't have enough customers to make fresh coffee and they don't have enough money to make fresh coffee too, SO SBUX can eat out coffee market,"
"too close to 100 to short when a stock gets within 10 of 100 you canbet they will hit 100 , then it will be time to short maybe 102 or 103"
"SBUX build bottom successful, the next move up 15percent to match analysts target price $64.85."

Next stop $40.

"I'm definitely not a fan of the tax plan that was just signed in to law, but the new corporate tax rate of 21% should be of some benefit to SBUX where their tax rate is typically in the low 30 range. That 10% should help earnings, free cash flow, benefiting their already solid balance sheet and likely driving further increases to the dividend. Lots of growth ahead and a lot still to like here. Challenges ahead? Absolutely, but that's to be expected with a company this size. I'm fine being here because for the most part, SBUX does things right. Best of luck SBUX longs..."
DNKN rules.
"Another decent day for the bears. Crushed the 15 DMA on the second try. The 50 DMA is at $70.75, still quite a way off. If it cracks that look out below, this short will be making money. Tempering the bears was the second day of low volume. To get me excited I would like to see higher than average volume, not lower. For the bulls you are still above Wednesdays close and well above last Monday's, so nothing really to panic about. Most important is the general market backround. The SPX is just two points above the 15 DMA. This line held on 5/6, 5/4, 5/1, 4/21, 4/3, 4/2. The last day it closed below was 4/1 and that was only one day. Since 3/26 the SPX has been above the 15 DMA for all but one day. I believe we are at a near term pivot point. A close below, especially two days on volume and the bears will feed."
"The 300 store closures were announced 6 months ago btw. Funny that the news drops stock again. Oh well, just a buy op."
"If you can't sit there, a lot of people won't go. $5 coffee is not the same #$%$ coffee and enjoying the place with friends."

lol
Could be that we’re waiting for a new monthly candle to make the chart look nicer. Expected tomorrow to continue the uptrend unless we see a heavy drop today.
Last split in 2015 what do you think are chances this could happen latter this year ??
"When you see a company like (SBUX ) trading at over 75 X last year earning we all know that the market is the biggest joke in town, clowns, bobbleheads, and jungle bunnies of wall street have to be a little bit more creative, but than again greed doesn't leave you much room, Booyah."
"Like Beyond Meat is in starbucks, look at plant based BABYF as well."
"should settle low 40s, about fair value there"
"Last year two black guys were hanging out in a Starbucks not drinking coffee or purchasing anything to eat. Although not bothering anyone, common sense tells one they probably should purchase something....police are called and the two are arrested without incident. Protests erupt, Starbucks apologizes and closes all stores for a half day to provide ""sensitivity"" training to all employees. However, when police are refused service, Starbucks will attempt to discipline the rogue employee and move in like it's nothing. Anything wrong here Starbucks?"
No one will want to eat at a starbucks wearing a face mask.

"I used to be a shareholder but will likely never own the stock again. Visited the store in ocean beach California and concluded that Starbucks stores are quickly turning into homeless shelters. I was there for one hour and at least half the people walkin* through the door looked disheveled and purchased nothing. Either just sat down or went to the restroom. Even the workers were giving wary eyes to these people. Can’t even image using the restroom. However, after a venti I had to go and what did I encounter. A dirty homeless man waiting in line. It is truly disgusting. I feared Touching anything in the store fearing disease. What the hell is the executive leadership in thinking? They want Starbucks to be a welcoming place? Well this paying customer will be welcomed at other non Starbucks coffee shops. Truly disgusted."
"SBUX now trading higher than DNKN. Natural order of the universe has been restored.This of course does not even take stock splits into consideration. SBUX has been by far, a better investment. However, if you want to take stock advice from a sailor suited sissy boy and his geriatric, oversized motorcycle jacket wearing, Liberace lisping little buddy, then by all means go ahead. The road to financial ruin is littered with their advice."

"Pick yourself up and get back in the game Kenny Boy. You're not gonna let those pervs keep you down forever are you? No ma'am you are not. Time to wolf down a bowl of potridge, grab the red hot fire poker and go show them who's boss!"
Even though I absolutely hate their balance sheet I am holding for now. Last weekend both local Starbucks had lines for the drive through that overflowed out into the road.
agree
There IS NO bottom.
Feel sorry for people that short this stock wonder how they feel losing money when this market has been doing so well must be tough.
Speaking of tangled webs and deception. The little Big Rimster sure wove himself a good one didn't he Kenneth? Yes Siree Bob as you like to say. Those bold claims of doing my wife at my house really came back to bite him in his boat slip didn't it? Oh you bet it did. Just proved that he was either A. a coward or B. a liar or C. Both. I'd say C.
still got another 5-10% rally tomorrow.
Stock should be down 4-5% on this poor earnings that doesn’t justify stock price

So it is OK to wear BLM shirt but not MAGA hat? Starbucks is out of their minds and this is completely out of hand. The African America community has been sold out by the liberal democrats.....how can they even look in the mirror .....everyday there are so many people killed and wounded in Chicago EVERY DAY and nobody cares!So if BLM what is anybody doing about that? The Democratic mayor could care less....explain that
"Closing up all the tea shops they bought, ouch!"
I don't understand market too much stealing money from people
Nice!
"$SBUX has direct competition in so many ways. The experience is not the only place. I don't think they can expand their business to get them out of this funk. You're going to have to look at the fundamentals and see if the charts are going to support you entry point on this stock. This business now us up against some serious competition. A Starbucks store on a location here then and less that two hundred feet another Starbucks in Kroger's. and one nearly every 1 mile part? They also put themselves in the political cross hairs too. When I'm on the road and in search for a good cup of coffee, I no longer look to Starbucks like I have in the past. McDonald $MDC has some good coffee now. Faster service and on the road. Who wants to line up in those long lines of 10-20 cars for a cup of Starbucks. They use skeleton crews to operate their stores, so you wait inside too and you waste 20-30 minute for a cup of coffee. Starbuck no longer has that appeal. This is my opinion but the it resonates with lots of other people too. $SBUX has some negative sentiment.... to overcome."
Everyone knows they would feel a bit strange if 6 armed police officers were standing near you in a store. It's just human nature. But you can't express that feeling because it's politically incorrect.

Team Oat Milk

the decline is not over yet.
I will not go to Starbucks with reusable cups that customers return as I do not want to drink out of a cup that many others have used no matter what their cleaning process is as mistakes always happen no matter how unlikely. One mistake for me is too much if I’m the one with the dirty cup. And I refuse to pay extra 6 cents for a hygienic throw away cup that gets recycled (thus not a big environmental issue). This seems like a dumb idea that will hurt sales. I’ll buy coffee elsewhere.
will Starbucks be considered a restaurant and maybe get money from next stimulus? i don't think they need it but wondering if next stimulus being finalized will raise stock price
"Always down, ha ha ha ha ha"

"Check out $SHAK earnings per share estimates for 2021 on the yahoo finance app. 90 days ago they were $0.61 per share, putting SHAK share price at about 100X 2021 earnings estimates. Then the EPS est got cut to the current $0.29/share, putting share price at 207X 2021 earnings estimates. Time for SHAK to deliver some magic, since its P/E on 2021 is higher than everyone in the restaurant industry, including the solid performers with much higher operating income, like:$CMG$SBUX$WEN$DRI$DINEBut SHAK is trading in a PE range higher than every restaurant performer. SHAK must be more like $ZM , the obvious winner in the COVID-19 environment. Oh, wait, ZM only trades at at PE of 140X future earnings.... so SHAK must be on another HIGHER level of value since it is at over 200X 2021 earnings. It must be that they sell a very good cheeseburger in their largely NYC-based restaurants... I know there is a reason SHAK is priced up here in the clouds, we'll all figure it out someday.... I doubt it's simply that it's been pumped endlessly by the shameless analysts still calling for a ""hold/maintain"" on this one."

$SBUX stock is in a negative cycle that may last. The sales miss and moving out of a growth stage is definitely the basis of today's decline. SBUX leading indicators predicted this turn in advance. https://www.blusignalsystems.com/sbux-leading-indicators/

"There's a laundry list of better stocks to own, long term and short term vs. SBUX. I cannot see how people continue to own something that isn't paying you squat in dividend (<2%), yet you people constantly like to voice how well the company is doing, and how much money they make. The company is run by a bevy of super-socialists and Howard Schultz is their head commie. Management speaks and sells catchphrases, and your $5 coffee drink goes to 90% employee benefits and management salaries. They hire illegals, and management promotes illegal immigration and California socialism. A LOT of better stocks out there for free-enterprise capitalists."

I think SBUX can rise to over $100,some coffee stores sell cat coffee, but too expensive ,only 2oz sell $6.00 , only a little people buy it, some people said they can't sleep after they drunk,"

"SBUX will turn red before close. Most importantly, this is the most overvalued in S&P500. I won't consider buying it even it is $65. Traders are just crazy chasing momentum stocks.

"I believe we have farther to fall here before I'm backing up the truck to the loading dock. So much of Starbuck's revenue is based on 2 factors ... The place to get coffee on the way to or at work, and a social gathering place. With COVID-19, more people are working from home which will impact Starbucks revenue and, people are avoiding social gathering until the virus is under control. If it drops to the 60's I'll start loading up because fundamentally it is solid. It is just going to be a short term roller coaster."
Looking hazy to me. Closures are not good. Everyday counts...

"Just went into SBUX and asked the manager what I could get on the shelf for $100. She said that turnover on all the cups and #$%$ they have there was terrible and they should toss it all and add a few more tables for all the excrement that spends half their day there fooling themselves they are actually productive. I think she is really smart, I offered her a job in my business and she is considering it. I feel like Moses leading the Israelites through the sea."
"Illegal immigrant kills NFL star on Super Bowl SundayFEBRUARY 5, 2018Indianapolis Colts lineback Edwin Jackson was one of the two men struck and killed by a truck on Super Bowl Sunday — and the suspect is a twice-deported illegal alien.Another American life ended tragically by a criminal that should have never been in our country, outraged fans say.Jackson and another man were killed early Sunday when a suspected drunken driver struck them as they stood outside their car along a highway in Indianapolis, the team and police said.“The loss of life at the hands of illegal immigrant criminals should make all Hoosiers sad and ultimately angry. We must do more to get these dangerous illegal immigrant criminals off of our streets, and guarantee this never happens again by building a wall, ending sanctuary cities, and stopping illegal immigration once and for all,” Indiana Rep. Todd Rokita said in a statement.The Colts said in a statement Sunday that the team is “heartbroken” by Jackson’s death and that the 26-year-old “was loved by all in the Colts organization.”State police identified the victims as Jackson, who grew up in Atlanta, and 54-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, of Avon, Indiana. Police say they were killed when a suspected drunken driver — who is also an illegal alien –struck them as they stood outside their car along Interstate 70 on Indianapolis’ west side.Police said that it’s believed that Monroe was an Uber driver who was transporting Jackson when Jackson became ill. Monroe pulled over to the side of the highway and got out to help Jackson when both were struck by a pickup truck that also hit Monroe’s car, police said.The pickup’s driver, a 37-year-old illegal immigrant named Manuel Orrego-Savala, is a citizen of Guatemala and had been deported twice before. Orrego-Savala was believed to be intoxicated and was driving without a license, police said. He allegedly tried to flee the deadly scene on foot but was quickly captured.“Orrego-Savala is in the United States illegally and has previously been deported on two occasions, in 2007 and again in 2009. State police investigators are working with U.S. Federal Immigration Officials and they have placed a hold on Orrego-Savala,” Sgt. John Perrine said in a statement.The 6-foot, 234-pound Jackson attended Georgia Southern. He was signed by the Arizona Cardinals in May 2015 and released by the team about three months later. Jackson was signed to the Colts in December 2015. He was placed on injured reserve by the Colts last September.The Colts said in their statement that they “admired” Jackson’s “outgoing personality, competitive spirit and hard-working mentality.”“He was well-respected among all with whom he crossed paths, and he will be greatly missed in our locker room and throughout our entire organization,”"

"I love Starbucks coffee. Drink it daily. But, that being said, with all of their stores shutdown to everything but drive thru, they are still priced for a fully open market. Their quarterly numbers are going to be dreadful. I would be a buyer in the $50s, although I have day traded a few times lately."
So do the earnings come out tonight? Won't know how much they've lost until end of trading day?
"Starbucks price held up well today. Despite the drop, I think Starbucks is one of the few companies who was transparent about the effect on business from the virus from the beginning. It looks like the price already reflects this more accurately than other company stock prices where the effects are still unclear."

"Wow, it never ends with starbucks. They can let homeless, smelly, encopresis, obnoxious customers in, and drive away many good customers, but they turn around and ask the Police to leave. I think a good solution would be to allow the Police to not respond to 911 calls from Starbucks, the employees participating in asking them to leave, and the customers who probably put them up to it. We could easily have a nationwide list of people who don't like the Police, and who also might target the Police. And for that matter, lets keep the EMT and Fire Dept away, when you've been in an accident or your house is burning. If you like anarchy, lets let you be the first victims of a lawless society, and see how that works out. Generally, people who don't like the Police use drugs and deal them. The police should have asked the barista who wanted them to leave, then got a search warrant for that person."

why??? I dont get it Can someone explain
Please submit uniform styles for SBUX Baristas to wear on roller skates for curb service. I will then submit to home office in Seattle.
I used to buy more when it'd dip below 55. I'm getting a little overweight on it now. Still a believer that it'll catch fire again.
They wanted to use the bathrooms and refuse to buy anything. Then they say there and refuse to buy anything. That’s trespassing. It happens to all races. Why should this be a special event? It’s just for the bait for free money.

"This is a joke? The Dow is down twice as much than SBUX today. Will people still feel comfortable going to SBUX when they are scared of Coronavirus and when their stocks are down. Also, China is coming back, but really slowly and SBUX is most probably losing money on its China business. This should be down much more. Any opinion?"
I sold Starbucks at the top after holding for years. I would have bought back my shares around 50 except every time I go into a Starbucks store it’s almost empty. Back when I first bought SBUX the stores used to always be full with long lines. Now you can walk right up to the counter and place your order and there is no problem parking. I haven’t seen a full store in a long time.
This is only getting worse. Sold this dead cat bounce and will start accumulating again in the 50’s. Great long term but the next 3-6 months will be rough
Went to Starbucks twice this weekend. Nice coffee and pastry
"Hey, why stop at unlimited loitering? How about free coffee for the homeless, transients,bums, beggars, BLM, LGBTQ, La Raza, and all illegals.

Starbucks should be renamed something like the Lounge & Loiter Safe Space Java Jungle."

THU MAR 29, 2018 / 9:45 PM EDTStarbucks coffee in California must have cancer warning, judge says Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and other coffee sellers must put a cancer warning on coffee sold in California, a Los Angeles judge has ruled, possibly exposing the companies to millions of dollars in fines.A little-known not-for-profit group sued some 90 coffee retailers, including Starbucks, on grounds they were violating a California law requiring companies to warn consumers of chemicals in their products that could cause cancer.One of those chemicals is acrylamide, a byproduct of roasting coffee beans that is present in high levels in brewed coffee.Its only safe to consume Tofu And Kale in Lib Dem Communist Sanctuarry State California ."
"When Starbucks reports a 57c quarterly loss at the end of July, their ttm EPS will drop to $1.40 and SBUX drops to $50 or lower. Buy it then."
"China support North Korea quit nuclear bomb and long missile, that means Asia political trend to peace, SBUX have huge business in Asia, SO this is very good news for SBUX, Trump fired tillerson, this is very good news for stock market too, because Trump want North Korea quit nuclear bomb and long missile, so all political are trend to peace. that is very good news for business, it's very good news for stock market, SO strong buy SBUX. because SBUX business are world's people business."
"MY LAMBO, ITS ALL GONE!!!!!"
maybe i will get in at 49
I hope other CEO's learn from SBUX CEO Mr. Johnson. He did exactly what you're suppose to do. For those who were hoping for a tank. You're out of your mind. SBUX is a great company to invest in for long term. Overpriced but people still pay for it!

Lets go Starbucks! Lets Go!

However, you do have to admit, this is one business that has flourished and it's only a matter of time before the big competitor comes along. We've had some regional coffee companies that served great coffee, nice business model but I guess don't have the funds to compete with this monster. Someone is gonna have to generate a MASSIVE stack of cash to compete with the bux here but I do think it's coming one day..."

"After Starbucks posts another loss for last qtr, their PE ratio will hit 150. I am out now, waiting for the market to come to its senses. More companies going out of business and layoff continue, the US market should not be priced for perfection. Love this company long term, but it is way too over valued for me here."

Boycott Starbucks and drive them out of business.
This will hit $70 by Monday.
"So a person goes to SBUX spend what $5 to $ 7 for a blessed coffee and homeless are welcomed inside the store. Schultz, better not run for president this will kill him and the liberals"
Wow. Even Starbucks is lowering guidance. This market has no bottom at this point.
"Waited at the drive through yesterday for 23 minutes! My hot coffee was cold. I walked into the store to complain. The Asian lady behind the counter was a real ""B"". Never again!!!"

Hmmmm.......the guy thinks.........I think I'll buy ICE at $238.85 and spend the next 13 months posting away on the SBUX board about what an evil and #$%$ stock SBUX is.Thirteen months later, today, that $47,770 is worth $47,300 for a loss of $430 with ICE.The same money put into SBUX on that same date would be worth $61,675 today for a gain of $13,905.Now, don't respond. Erase, erase, erase."
Yuban is better than Starbucks. Yup I said it!
They forget about the part where they ignored the people asking them to leave because they didn’t buy anything. It’s not a white or black thing. I was asked to leave before so either I buy something or leave. Refusing will get you kicked out or arrested. Star bucks knows the rules. Only reason they are letting it go is because they don’t like this kind of attention wrong or right. Why make it into a race thing?
"Carnage for the bears. This thing just defied gravity today, on no real news. Actually rising into the close as the SPX declined a bit. SBUX is safely back above the 15DMA and its flirtation with the 50 DMA only three days ago seems like forever ago. The technical damage by the earnings report is mosty repaired. I am now under water on this trade, barely. The bears have really nohing to hold on to right now except hope. The jobs number tomorrow will be so bad that the market gives back the weeks gains??? That is not much to put your hopes in as the bad jobs numbers seem to be mostly baked in. News? There was a little good news out of China, but nothing that I feel would cause a nearly 5% move. Today I am stunned. For it to be up with the market is one thing. For it to do four times as well is inexplicable. Old saying: The market can stay irrational a lot longer than you can remain solvent."
101 or nah? Lol
"Only day dreamers will invest in a stock like SBUX that trades over 30 x earnings, it's only a coffee shop that serve you food from frozen or from Microwave , called BBBOOOYYYAAA"

"My guess is that the bulls are letting shorts have fun up to the support that was created in June after sbux saw the 3 white soldiers. So support should be about 82 (almost there!). Also, the RSI is showing oversold, so that should hopefully start a boost up until earnings."

"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/real-reason-starbucks-stock-just-165349501.htmlNever let it be said Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) can’t come up with excuses why it’s not performing as well as it has in the past. Within the past few days, the company has suggested slowing delivery-based business in China, higher labor costs, healthier diets and lackluster innovation all contributed to the lowering of an already-tepid growth outlook for the current quarter. In that same vein of intellectual honesty though, there’s a much bigger reason slowing sales led to a two-day, 11% plunge from SBUX stock that dragged it to multi-month lows."
"SBUX open high- end coffee bar will drive SBUX sales strong growth in future, SO SBUX have a lot of opportunity to boost it's sales growth, strong buy SBUX,"
Modigliani technical analysis show support at 47; this formula NEVER FAILS
"Facts..... SBUX is down about 11% in the last 4 weeks, and down about 15% in the last 8 weeks.... What gives any of you the indication that the stock price is ready to go up? You should ask yourself..... Will it drop another 15-25% (or more) before at least leveling out!?"

My 105 calls not looking good.
"PE ratio sitting at 68. Next qtr will also be a loss because of the Covid #$%$ show and PE will go up to 100. I love Starbucks, it is just too expensive right now. The S&P is about to test its all time high, which when it got there previously everyone said the market was too overvalued. Back then unemployment was 3.5%, now over 11%. Over 20MM people not working and I am sure cutting back on discretionary spending. I am a buyer of this at $52/ sh. See you there this fall."
i own lot of long call options i have already made8500. in 2018
"inflation Will boost SBUX sales growth and profit growth, because SBUX is integrated products (maker and sellers), plus tax cut SBUX doesn't need mortgages, all real stores business too weak, SO business man have to rise price to off set lost, that means SBUX coffee price have more room to rise, SO this kind of inflation are very good news for SBUX ,"
O come on now. Great place to go to meet homeless and illegals.
is the yahoo PE quote of about 28 accurate? historically at what pe does this company sell at?
what if they try to close for reeducation training and everyone refuses to leave think I will try that see if they have me arrested I M GENDER FLUID - so they can't call the cops
SBUX is way down and it's going to go way up. Pick up these cheap shares. Strong BUY!

"Diversity hiring has statistical logic to it, but you still need to hire the best. The idea is founded in the notion that all ethnicities have an intelligence distribution like the bell curve. The size of the top 10% of these pools varies but “whites” have the largest pool, mainly because they generally have access to better education and culturally it is emphasized. If you exhaust the top 10% of the “white” pool you begin to hire lesser quality staff. Being vocal and aggressive about diversity should attract all sorts of people. Thus you get exposure to the broader top 10% base. The idea isn’t to just hire a black person or Asian person, but rather, to attractive more top tier applicants. This notion was explained to me from a close friend who advocates for Aboriginals to get involved in science, especially aerospace (as he’s an aerospace engineer). So you need to motivate all people to pursue higher education to tap into the total top percentiles and part of that motivation lies on the back end of education- getting a job! Companies that promote diversity help to motivate."

If Starbucks wants to sell me morality instead of coffee, fine but i dont have to buy it. Maybe they can introduce a new coffee called ""Bitter Loser's Moral Judgement""."
stupid downgrade today. These analysts are a joke . Another bogus call to get in cheaper.

Or, SBUX is a buy because Covid is over, and they will have sit down customers, again? They can't have it both ways. Either way SBUX stock is wayyyy overpriced."

Got back in at the dip!

With all of those SBUX stores closed in China due to the coronavirus it is going to catch up to them and it will drop. Probably sooner than later.

"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?"

SBUX is typically taxed at a rate in the low-mid 30%, which will be sub-25% going forward. 5%+ saved on $25B in revenue is substantial, especially considering they already had industry leading profitability metrics. We're likely looking at a boost in profits nd free cash flow measured in the the high hundreds of millions of dollars. That's no joke!"

Buy the dip. COVID may have made things rough for SBUX but long term COVID doesn't get the final say...the vaccine does. This is a great reopening play and their business model is very solid and their competitive advantage sustainable.

I'll take a sugar free vanilla latte please.
I just watched the call of the day and it sounds like Starbucks is going to guide down because of no frills coffee and because of Dunkin' Donuts. Obvious everyone agrees the stores are busy.. For me I always enjoys Starbucks. There is nothing special about Dunkin' Donuts coffee and other coffee shops are hit and miss. Starbucks is busy because the coffee tastes good consistently. These guys are arguing business model over product. The stock is cheap now and they want it cheaper.
No $SBUX for me again this week.

Yeah Starbucks earning can be bad... but there open over in China and they can be good... Also there offering this Bynd- impossible meats.... that’s great news taking into account the meat shortages we are experiencing these days... I’m curious on the earnings... my opinion it’ll be decent... but to those who like Starbucks check out Bynd... Bynd is positioned nicely...
Just thought I would check in to see if SBUX had started its downward spiral to $50 that Rodrigo predicted - nope - climbing even higher again this morning....

This was bound to happen eventually. How StarBucks handles the wave of Black Lives Matter people who will now be squatting in their stores all day long using the bathroom......That’s the big unknown.

Holding nicely
"Hershey can predict and SBUX can? That was suckers rally yesterday The length and severity of the pandemic and associated changes to consumer behaviors remain uncertain.

Great time to start a position in my opinion. I’ll be establishing a position at 114.81 to target 120.73 with a stop loss at 112.22
This company is artificially propping up share price by buying up those 40 mil shares they plan to buy. Watch the price cave as soon as they stop buying.
Earnings .51 vs .31 expected!!! What a massive beat!
Analysts' estimate on short term bounce from 200 dma== 89$
crazy how they managed the pandemic
lulu is a bigger bubble than SBUX
video going viral of Sarbucks drive thru employee copying credit card information and using it at a store spending over $200 wow...
"Very happy employees. No more seating = no bums, no unemployed and no fake employed hanging out there all day long. This is good for SBUX. Build more drive thru windows. Fleet"
"Can I please get a serious answer to this question.... I am not a long time Starbucks stock owner. I had a really bad day today as I’m sure a lot of you did. I have 10 $105 calls expiring this Friday and 10 next Friday. What do I do with the ones expiring Friday? For anyone who has owned Starbucks for a while, how will this react tomorrow to the good investor day news? Will it open at the high and then trade off ? I just never have followed this stock and I don’t know how it normally reacts to good news. Any help would be greatly appreciated"
bought some shares in 1992 6 forward splits im not rich but im not worried i always hold long calls for fun money and to buy more shares
Show me the money
Going to move right back to Sbux after LK's earnings are released.
If I always buy something to use the bathroom and to take a table why do they get special treatment?
great short headed to 30’s the new CO is a deadbeat and now you have to wait 20 minutes to get a Americano with an extra shotwhat a joke turned a great company into a political company
Here comes the 52 week lowI have spent $1000 less at Starbucks since Schultz spewed his hate for our president
$70.00 coming !!!!!!!
Why are Starbucks baristas allowed to put covers on coffee cups barehanded? Why aren’t they wearing gloves?
Dunkin sales out performs starshit.
Low volumes
Cathy Wood gets her coffee here every day
50 +/- 3 looks like the new normal until proven otherwise. Confidence is build brick by brick but can come down all at once.
"Sbux biggest competition in China, LK, was raided by China market regulators yesterday. They are done. Also 10+ cars at Sbux drive thrus in Dallas all day everyday. Prob where you live too. This will go higher inevitably with the opening of the economy and more store."
If you don't buy a coffee on Tues do you buy 2 on Weds ?
"Over sold, not a good time to sell unless you have a nice profit and a better place to put your money. We are not that far away from huge resistance @ $77.96. Any close above that could single a run higher to approx $89."
"ya like i say a green week is coming but the problem is there is no news. this stock will go up with out real news but it will fall when the all market is red. so I mean thismarket green sbux green market red sbux redthis is only because there is no news!!....,,,,,,,,,.....JUST WAIT NEW HIGH ON THE WAY!!!!"
"Great buy under 60. Five years from now you will wish you loaded up. They are expanding and opening up everywhere. Grocery stores, malls, China now. Once this virus leaves the soccer mom and kids will enjoy the $30 visits again at the locations. I’mBullish."
What did I tell you people?! You don’t sell your $SBUX.
Schultz got out at the right time. Great timing!
Dominant in the space..... lots of people in stores ..... need to still figure out better way to process the large number in each store..... big growth over seas..... I'll stay long
"look quick, it is trading in the green for 1st time in days...may not last"
You have to be nuts to touch this stock with a 135 PE ratio and even yahoo says its overvalued by 43%
Can I bring my goat into $SBUX ?
Do you think there will be a significant dividend increase soon
Now if someone could get those machines to be silent while on. Then that person would get rich fast.
JoeyTee and the Costco Man were SNOOKERED by wall st pros and pumpers are are not learning the lesson the hard way with their wallets !
"Don’t you know the formula. Every time a Executive retires or leave the co. They bring some stories to bring the stock price down. So they can get new guys shares with 10% 15% discount for his retirement account. It will bounce back with revenge tomorrow or next week. The RSI is also to low , meaning it’s over sold. Why would you sell or short here ? To lose money ? Buy buy buy and make money. See you at the top with a cup of #SBUX in the hand !!!"
"sbux supports BLM and likes to intrude on employees personal lives by asking them their financial status not only theirs, but spouses, too. they should mind their own business! they're going downhill much like Seattle and Portland!"
Had to wait 15 minutes just to order my coffee never was this busy.
what will the goofy CEO say tomorrow about guidance he has no back up plan to exit China
Low 70z s good entry point.
"GUYS BOTH AMC MOVIE THEATRE AND NIKOLA MOTORS REPORT THURSDAY AFTER THE BELL, AMC IN EXTENDED"
I took a shot and added some SBUX right before the close.
Schultz was on CNBC this morning from Shangai promoting socialism for the United States. Makes me sick. Stop buying this swill if you don't want socialism to accelerate in the USA.
Starbucks will have declare bankruptcy in the next few months.
Owning SBUX is like death by a thousand cuts. Every day market hit highs and SBUX goes down. China opportunity has no impact to the price. US market consumers running to cheaper DNKN and Mcd coffee. Yet SBUX introduces $10 coffe houses. Time to drop this from my portfolio because management is not reading the tea leaves (sorry for pun). Good luck all. I am out.
Demo-socialist coffee up today...
"SBUX just spilled boiling hot coffee on the crotches of shareholders. Why settle for low growth and a high forward multiple when there are much better fish in the sea ?For example, compare and contrast the current NASDAQ analyst consensus estimates below:SBUX 57.43/sh (19) 2.76 (20) 3.14 (21) 3.64ATRS 2.87/sh. (19) .06 (20) .24 (21) .43If you do the math, SBUX's estimated earnings growth rate from (19) to (20) is currently a paltry.........13%... while its forward PE to (20E) is a very high....18On the other hand, ATRS's estimated earnings growth rate from (19) to (20) is currently a very robust........300%... while its forward PE to (20E) is only.............12x... earnings.SBUX= 13% grower; 18 forward multipleATRS= 300% grower; 12 forward multipleEqually important, the current trade war between the US and China will have ZERO.... impact on ATRS.Good luck to all "
I buy more today Really like the rr below 50 entry
Schultz is a very righteous guy that is getting sued for not paying millions in taxes. I guess all liberals are just a bunch of hypocrites
"So you all brilliant investors, you really think Sbux is going to do the volumes it used? It will be a long long time for now for sure!!"
Over/Under on when they reverse this policy? Guess we can give up on Howard Shultz run for president the day he announces the reversal? I bet its memo and no interview when he changes his mind.
When is Schultz coming back to the rescue again. Fire the CEO NOW
"""...Starbucks President and CEO Kevin Johnson said quick pivots have helped increase sales. In the U.S. — where 70% of its stores are still offering no interior seating ...""Starbucks promoting the covid shutdown FAKENESS, and run by BLM and socialist supporters."
definitely will buy if this drop after earnings
I noticed that Hard Rocks have replaced SBX with Dunkin Doughnuts. Mgt told me SBX wont accept dollar deniminations greater than $20.00...so they will be getting hit with c. card transaction fees as well as alienating customers.
Will definitely add to positions in SBUX if it drops after the earning. Have sold all of my MCD shares and look to deploy them in SBUX.
shultz has been using sbux as a pawn to drive his political agenda for years.. he was a great ceo and returned in 2008 to engineer an amazing turm around stories. he has also layed the tracks for a potentially very successful footprint in china. but its time for him to go. if they can just maintain same store sales domestically that is about as much as you can expext. the growth will be in china
Been getting a lot of traction recently as a dividend stock. Solid buy
"How stupid are the shareholders of this company to bow down to low life people over paying customers, what are they going to do when mass turn outs come in and expect the mayor to serve them tea. The police chief who is black even agreed to throw them out, wake up liberals or you,ll lose our country."
2008 to 2015 was the growth sweet spot.
"The only reason Norwegians come here is to vacation in AZ, FL, or CA."
DNKN down 65 centsSBUX down 5 cents.
SBUX looking at Sonic Drive-In Restaurants of America. Would be a good fit.
$85 will sure look Pretty!
"Stocks you will never lose on.. SBUX, Costco, apple, msft.. Need I say more.. No I didn't think so."
$70 is closer than you think.
Stinky burnt liberal garbage coffee
"SBUX sales growth higher than American economic growth and world's economic growth, but it's stock growth lower than Dow Jones industrial average and s&p and nasda, l think this time is buy time, tax cut and low unemployment rate will boost it's sales growth in this year,"
"According to 2018 census, my neighborhood has a black population of 27%, but all 6 Starbucks have no black males working in any of them. I guess it's like going to the headquarters if Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Apple and finding more BLM posters on the walls of their buildings than black employees. I did read where Apple hired a black lady in the Affirmative Action Search Board whatever that is."
Never will patronize Starbucks .
"30 million jobs gone, but let's get in line to purchase a 40$ coffee........stock should be at 10$ per share in no time."
this is going up all the way thru earnings. 82 coming.
"I drove through our local SBUX this morning and was shocked to see the employeesstrolling around in Black LIves Matter shirts. I asked the girl at the pickup window who supplied the shirts and she said the ""manager told us to wear them, it's from corporate"". Really? SBUXhas always been anti-gun, but anti law enforcement and pro-Marxism is something else.I told the girl in the window that I won't be back and she remarked ""my Dad wants me to quit"".Shameful. BLM is a Marxist organization packed with urban terrorists and criminals who are unitedin their hatred of law enforcement and hatred of America. Shame on SBUX. I wonder whether themanager of our local Starbucks realizes the BLM crowd would eagerly burn his place of emplyment at the drop of a hat."
soy latte time
20 billion in debt....not so good.
Increase of 5% at least coming now. Congrats to who cashed.
Looks like a good buy at these levels. Anyone adding at $55?
Will the anti BLM comments hurt the stock tomorrow?
STARBUCKS GOT A RAW DEAL. 2 PERSONS ARE POLITELY ASKED TO LEAVE 3 TIMES BY POLICE AND REFUSE. BOUGHT NOTHING! THE CEO SHOULD GROW A PAIR AND BACK THEIR EMPLOYEES. SO ITS OK TO HANG AROUND BUY NOTHING THEN REFUSE TO LEAVE WHEN ASKED? PLUS TIE UP THE TABLES! WHO WANTS DEADBEATS AT THEIR PLACE?
Need to break ma9
Water and sugar coffee.
So upset I didn’t have the extra cash to put into this when it was at the 50-55 range. Was screaming to pull out of my emergency fund but decided to stick to my rules. Hoping to see this drop back into the 50s after these next few paychecks so I can jump in on this
"Shultz, let an 80 billion dollar business get deztroyed, but just dont want to be insensitive? Ok, fine, its the liberal way. why not give free coffee to veterans, its sensitive but also heroic."
Shultz needs to be FORCED to go to sensitivity training for a year with regards to employees and shareholders of a company that he USED to push his person and false agenda.

It’s all about China now. That story unfolds next year.
"Does anybody have thoughts on SBUX in China? AND how this latest announcement will affect the company? Luckin Coffee is proving to be a significant challenger and is rapidly expanding. With the trade frictions of the past year, I have been nervous for the brand in China. Anybody care to share thoughts on the political scenarios that may emerge over the next year or two? I'm north of the border trying to look after my investment and while they stock has performed well with a nice dividend, I have been uneasy about this stock throughout 2018. hoping that the brand isn't associated with Trump and Trade.

"the logic with Starbucks coffee is that1. people are not going to their shops anymore which should decrease sales2. if people are so addicted to specifically Starbucks coffee, they can buy the bulk package and make it at home...which will end up decreasing the net profit because it is cheaper3. if people are just addicted to coffee and they realize that we are in recession, then buying the cheapest bulk coffee and making it at home is even cheaperfolks you need to realize that this coronavirus situation is not going anywhere for another 9 months or so...with artificial intelligence, it takes 12-18 months to find a curedon't really see how this stock is still in the green."

"Would love for sbux to close just under 82 tomorrow. sold puts with 82 strike. I want the stock before it runs up, and you know it will sooner or later."
Market saturation is not going to be friendly for SBUX. Poor economic stimuli coupled with way to many coffee shops equals a sharp demise in share holder value.

"They are using stockholders money to buy their own stock, Deceptive and will dilute the shares value. But they can spin it, they cannot keep it up forever."
Starbucks will continue to be a buy because it pays a dividend. This fact is part of why the stock has risen so much in the last year. This fact will keep it propped up. If you hold it even for just a year you will be rewarded from the dividends alone.
Options expire tomorrow- TIMBER after that watch and learn
How does $SBUX succeed with such bad products at high prices. Are people ?
"Why does this have the P/E of a high growth tech company? Their branding and name recognition is amazing, but their products are not superior and they are easy to compete against. People will be avoiding places where they interact with other humans in close quarters more in the future. Why would an investor buy this? Seems like institutional and ETF ownership is propping it up for now."

Every time I see a Starbucks symbol it now reminds me of the confederate flag!
"I just sold all of my shares in this pos, if that had been two white males there would not be a word said. White males have enough common sense to leave when asked too.

Am reading this fun thread at Starbucks and enjoying my morning coffee plus cinnamon roll. Yummy. Many stupid posters bashing since 50-60$. What price is it now?
opens at 79-82 tomorrow!! great earnings report. Couldn't be happier!
so how much are these SBUX protests going to make dunkin drop today?
"A year and a half ago life was wonderful, and SBUX was doing great, holding steady around $60 per share. Now we are looking down into the pit of doom, business is down big time, and the stock is STILL at $60 per share??? What is wrong with this picture?"
Its going to touch $70 after hours
Bought in at an avg cost of $49.40 just sold for a $2 gain and will buy more if this drops after earnings . I just didn’t want to risk betting on earnings .
"If it's so undervalued, why aren't the boys with real money on it? Because it's not."

"I see a red flag; Closed my position, w/ just a tiny gain."
50% cut in sales!See you at $45.00
SBUX was trading in the 80s last nov. WAY before the virus hit. We are within 10% of that - the valuation here is crazy high. Major pullback tomorrrow after earnings tonite.
"Higher the pre-covid pricing. Hmmm.....anywhere there is a Starbucks competitor, the other chain's lines are much longer. Dutch Bros and Illy just to name two. I think this will ride up, but will fall. So I'm buying here and will ride it but will be out before the fall."
This this is a forward PE of 40. And every Kramer wannabe is recommending it....jeez. Makes AMZN look like a bargain.
I heard earning would have been higher if not for the exploding toilet paper expenses
Is Starbucks in the coffee business or in the sugar business? Trying to figure that out.
If you were short SBUX and long DNKN today you are very happy.
"Everybody stand for the flag and in honor of that guy escaping the septic tank, after being stuck on the walls so long."
SBUX management should RESIGN NOW !
Just calmly chugging along like a river...beware!
"compare Dow Jones ,standard poor and nasda, SBUX under value 35percent,"
Headed to 120. So much pricing power
Let’s go ....hey
Buy at 50
Must be nice to have LK as a competitor who cooks the books
SBUX will be $90 next week!
I had this stock for 5 years and t did not do anything; despite high prices and traffic the comps are 1 percent; management is very political; this is a good company to work for but not for investors; save your money and invest somewhere else; five years from now it will still be in the 50s;
"SBUX coffee have no competitors, SO it's stock price worth $75 per share, some coffee store sell $1 coffee, but it's taste too weak as water, SO SBUX coffee sell $2.5 is not too expensive, SBUX coffee taste worth more than this price, SO I think it's price have more room to rise. at least 10 percent rise."
Has the stock factored in a 13% unemployment rate?
"Reconsidering easy money is good news. We need a good economy, not easy money."
"I don't like how the 1-hour charts looks going into next week, not looking good."
bullish reversal candle strong buy noww SBUX yes strong buy nowwww
will move back to 86$ territory today
"I live in CA and there are so many Lib gov't freeloaders, so I know what John is talking about. CA used to be a great state but now Marxist govt. has destroyed it. People are becoming more aware but need to take action and vote out all destructive Dems ."

Any Starbucks that has a drive through the line is a steady 20 cars deep! People love routine.

"All this earning numbers is made up, Wall Street is bull.... , think of it they make company look good when it’s not. Stop lowering your number to make company look good. I deliver for Uber eats and Starbucks is not the same , I know this because am on the road every day, It’s a shame ."
starshits has the worse performance when stopping at their drive-thru.
I take it Investor Day went well
what price to add more??
We may see the $40s before a turnaround. Earnings are at risk for the next several quarters as the boycott takes hold because Schultz attacked half his customers
The problem with Starbucks is that they probably lose a lot of food to theft and waste by their partners; they have not been able to sell all their food in the afternoon; nobody wants to go to Starbucks to eat; great place to work but bad place to invest
Down $1.41 he he hehe haw hawwww.
If you cant sell Coca Cola how are you going to sell $6 coffee. This will be down at least 10% today.
Basically nothing from them earnings hoping for a pop in the am
Will beat
"Stock buyback in progress, Using personal investors money to prop up stock price is deceiving the public. Stores are slowing down and their best news is releasing a ""Red Holiday cup"""
Do you think SBUX will be hurt by a China trade conflict ?thumbs up yes thumbs down no
When the homeless begin testing this new policy of staying as long as you like....and they will......That’s when the problems start. I can see this being “tested” nation wide. Everybody wants to be on television and get a sweet cash settlement from a giant corporation.
strong SBUX NOWWWW
"Hey the Hecla man is back comparing apples and oranges and reveling in his ability to ride a universal wave of precious metals.Nope, don't own Hecla and didn't take your sage advice.

So overbought it’s not even funny... this is bitcoin $20k status...
"sbux have very strong business, it's business can keeping continue growth, China coffee market strong growth just beginning, so sbux can reach $150, sbux front view very good, forget temporary problem,"

"After saying they wanted to hire 10,000 immigrants and support gun control (Gun Taking) Stating that Austrailias gun laws would be great to have in the USA where they decieved the public and took all guns after a they said it was to register them"
Somthing to like for both bulls and bears. Bulls have to like the way the stock held up on a pretty #$%$ earnings report. Did not even approach Thursday or Fridays lowns and still above the 15 DMA. Of course it helps to have a strong tape. Bears? It did close almost at the days lows on some pretty good volume. Me? I am short and I expect it to trade down to $71.50 at least. That being said the market in general continues to defy gravity. That is not good for the bear case on almost any stock.
Are REPUBLICANS allowed to enter STARBUCKS ?
EASILY PROVOKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHY?????????? TRUTH IS PAINFUL
Been over 6 months i am waiting for a pullback....
"Look at the financial,that's reality. This stock is going up from 52 ,people need there coffee"
I sold today...stock at 80% of original high and sales definitely off way more than 20%. I love this stock for the LT but won't get back in until the world is headed in the right direction. and not just COVID but the US Sino tensions that are apt to pit the Chinese consumer against Starbucks if things escalate much more. Risk reward not there now. decent guidance and you could hit $80 but disappointment and continued increase in COVID and we could see $65. I don't like those odds right now.
Building the support at 84$ .niceee
"Now their trailing P/E is within their historic range, which is fine. From here we can expect 15-20% y-o-y earnings and stock price increases."
"this down, and LK is up both coffee, so what if they closed in china for the moment"
"With the new refugee program, will $SUBX still serve bacon on the breakfast offerings?"
Long line of customers redeeming happy hour offer today. Holy molly
Personally I think it's a 23 dollar stock. My opinion. Extremely overvalued on all metrics.
I see 18 times eps around $45
sbux is paying coffee bean farmers more to deal with the coffee crisis even if they miss earnings theyll have farmers with them jn the long run while other corps wont
"Seems trade deal with China improves relationships with US companies doing business in China and therefore, Starbucks!"
"Next time, buy the cops a coffee..."
Great buy now!
"This stock is at most $45, who pays $5 coffee in a recession?"
SBUX is up 5.81% to 59.60
"Grimmikins (golf clap)...Bravo..an absolutely stunning display of your intellectual skill level. I quote: ""Joey to stupid"".Now, do I need to point out the delicious irony contained in your brief, moronic, low level post consisting of a whole eight words? Did your Mom have to make you a jam sandwich after that feat? Hey, wanna talk about your short of COST at $113, or will that go the same way as when I ask your about your imaginary yacht in the south of France?BTW, was flying out of Southwest airport in Ft. Meyers earlier this week and didn't see any snowplows. There was a Starbucks and a Dunkin' in the airport. There was a line-up at Starbucks, but Dunkin' didn't look very busy. Very colorful, but certainly not very busy.I anxiously await your usual lame, limp, sterile Sissy King reply."
"Some problems in Buffalo., The main store keeps running out of food. It's not because it's too crowded. Yesterday, they were out of all lunch sandwitches and most breakfast sandwitches at 11 AM. On a SATURDAY."
Ouch today lol
SBUX 125+ before end of month
"Of the 3,300 layoffs, how many will be refugees?"
Did you know that Melania loves DNKN?
There is nothing wrong with closing down stores that are not performing well. Closing down non-performing stores will save SBUX lots of admin costs. I am sure SBUX will research other areas in the world where they can open up stores that will perform much better. I am going long.
Starbucks = Quality +Experience +Habit- ( minus) Politics! Stick to the Product! !!!!!
Dunkin up .20cents.Where is starshits?Down as usual.Everyone went to Dunkin for holidays.
I just bought 3 fraps
Going for a ride up today...
i have a feeling we reached the bottom ..we just got rid of the chickens with teir life saving dumb solid 200 dma stop losses...up from here
Perfect SHORT if available shares at your brokerage..........SELLLLLLLL
Some 4000 StarBucks in China seeing humongous drop in clientele.
The stock could get back to about 53.80 short term on a technical basis.
look for slow same store growth in numbers out tonight. SBUX has a issue of lack of people in stores!
"another value metric that many new investors think is meaningless is book value but they are wrong, would you buy a house that appraised 100k for 1,000,000 ?"
"SBUX Schultz looks very happy, SO l think SBUX sales sure be very strong in March quarter, he looks SBUX have a lot of opportunity to keeping continue growth,"
"Cost analysis of a Grande Cappuccino at Starbucks. Cost +/- $4.35 just material alone no labor or fixed costs maybe$.25 for the cup, lid, and content.Starbucks is making at least $4.00 net profit and this is why the operation is a cash cow.If the company can keep that putz Schultz away it cannot miss.Have you ever had a business meeting at Dunkin Donuts. No! It's always meet you at Starbucks and those stores are always busy."
"$8 coffees going to $15? No big deal! They buy $1,200 iPhones every other week they can afford it... "
You don't mess with Trump. Trump always wins!
Don’t worry folks.... if the liberals continue st this pace... you will not recognize this country in the next 20 years.
"In my area of northern New England, I see SBUX coming back to life with longer drive-thru lines and take out activity. They are all open, just no inside eating."
SBUX reached a 52 Week low at 62.95
"When I was growing up in the 60s and 70s, entertainers ands business knew better than to mix politics with what they do.Why anger any part of your customer base with some loud mouthed opinions.Do what you do and shut the pluck up.You hate Trump CEO?You screwed your shareholders now."
I love Starbucks but I think a way to solve the bathroom problem would be to start a outside bathroom consisting of say 2 outside johns that are used at construction sites and public parks.
"Waiting for SBUX to hit above $85 to sell some calls. Currently own shares and selling puts strike below $70 due this month and next. All holdings are positive. Positives abut SBUX:- Experiences learnt from China regarding reopening.- 60% US stores have drive through- Less impacted compared to other restaurants regarding ingredients such as beef. It's in short supply.- Most ingredients have longer shelf life which will cut down the operational wastes.- Balance sheet is sound and with decent credit rating to raise money in bond market.- Seasoned management, no top management personnel changes.Overall great company."
So glad I bought Dunkin instead of starsuks.
DUNKIN $60
Ok ok I can understand that you can't make it to 60 today because the market is so bad. But next week easy 60 ok dokie?
"Everyone bashing Starbucks, well I had Dunkin and the only thing better was I got my coffee faster, easy when nobody's in line."

Good stock to have when the market falls. SBUX doesn't seem to go up or down much at t'all :)
Crazy Resistance at: resist. $77.09 (24) Once it close above that it could run back to $ 89
LDSR on the move 5 days straight. Check it out.
Any reason not to take a short position today ? Covid cases increasing. State's are starting to pause opening up.
I haven't been in a Starbucks for nearly a year. I don't miss it either. Schultz should have never dragged politics into the frnachise
"Hey Ed, how's the E.D.? That implant help any?"
locations in major Chinese cities not as busy as they used to be. trip last week visited and went by many locations for due diligence. Luckin new stores open literally right next door to 2/3 SBUX locations. their to go bags from digital orders were more than actual customers hanging out at SBUX. Lucking coffee tasted only ok but 30% cheaper. not sure how growth can accelerate in their key market
Coronavirus just declared a national emergency. Love sbux but no question the outbreaks in China are far worse than being reported and will take its toll on the economy globally.
I think Starbucks share price will hit $90 within the next 3 years. Sit back and relax.
3pm we hit $100
Interesting reaction from ER. If the rest of earnings season goes like this we are all in very good shape. GL America. God bless the Fed and unlimited monetary supply.
So much politics on these boards and less on investing

coffee is poison
Do you know why?
"Oh..by the way...not only sold all my stock, but I will throw out my gold starbucks card, and never enter another Starbucks again....would rather drink bad coffee than support the liberal jackass who runs the company....idiot."
"Alot of gay bears on this sub. Coffee is a drug, SBUX HAS NO COMPETITION, Its a premiere brand... NEED I SAY MORE?????"
bought the dip today. Looks like a short squeeze tomorrow. Buy buy buy!
I think StarBucks will get several positive Analysts notes overnight. Maybe an upgrade or two....just on the financial strength of the company. StarBucks is very profitable.
Kroger up huge as consumers buy groceries and avoid Starbucks and restaurants
"BMO (Bowel Movement Operation) are a bunch of idiots or crooks. SBX opens multiple stores in densely populated areas like California so as to capture the markets. Otherwise, if one store was too crowded customers would move on. Instead multiple stores ensure high sales. Each one is crowded. I trust a master marketer like SBUX to make the right location selections, so disregard crooked BMO shouting sell in a down stock market all the while they or a related party have likely previously shorted the stock or hope to accumulate at lower prices. No reason to sell SBUX here!"
"This is a great entry point for longs. Support at $90, analyst guidance raised, and earnings coming up for the holiday season. No brainier"
I’m liking Sbux in the $40s
Having a policy regarding bathroom usage is not political issue.
SBUX=Homeless Shelters. Another BAD Liberal policy...they NEVER end!
why looking for stock split
"Immune to the market, lol. Everything else crashes while this stays where it is. Those Chinese love their Starbucks!"
"So if it's so bad why have a stock market OR real estate investing? What's your solution for people , business and government to invest in????"
dead stock or pretty idle money going nowhere. don't waste money here. just look at the charts. its been #$%$. i've watched for couple years already.

I believe a loss of business is in store and I would sell stock and RUN!!!!

Wow $DNKN at $71 while $SBUX down to $51
haven't we all drove down an interstate and ran into McDonald's just to use a bathroom first and then make a purchase next....... just sayn
Laughing heartily and mightily at today's Mad Manson/Sick Rimster meltdown. You know the little fella is hurting when he is reduced to making up a plethora of new ID's to converse with each other and support the unfounded slanderous nonsense pulled from the nether regions of the little man. Here's reality little fella. Me: married to the same woman for 25 years. 3 kids. You: 72 years old and never been married. No kids. Now let's apply a little logic. Who exactly is it that is having trouble performing? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"if our supply comes from china, and tariffs are coming, shouldn't buyers be worried that Starbucks will be more expensive then it already is??"
dam this forum is toxic.
College is FREE!!!!
SBUX will bounce higher. Strong Buy at 50.
"We the small investors are here to try to make some money. If you are a business that is more worried about PC and not making money, regardless of what company it is, I am out, because the priorities are not right for me to make money. Best thing I read was to not get emotional in investing. It stands true today."
when do you sell is the question - no way these levels last......
"I don't understand why there are no updates. And this thing isn't over. Has anyone looked at the map where infections are present. All 1st world countries. Why is Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East immune. Hmmmmm. Perhaps not quite reporting stats yet. Someone sneezes in these countries and everyone has Malaria. SBUX stores are shutdown across China and that doesn't massively delay there growth and bottom line prospects? If the stock were trading at a 15pe maybe it doesn't move but it is priced to take over the world and is priced for perfection. And if you look at the chart it has dropped only 2% since the virus and store closures were announced. As of today, it has not dropped at all. Wow. talk about bullish sentiment. Never seen it higher. hope that doesnt change."
What time is the party?
SBUX reached a 52 Week low at 53.07
DUNKIN
Starbucks reached an all time high at 100.72

￼BUSINESS News. Starbucks Creates Policy on Nonpaying Guests like 2 Blacks arrested last week. Starbucks tells employees in a letter that everyone is “considered a customer” even if it is blacks using bathrooms and free Wi-Fi. I guess I’ll get my coffee elsewhere.

"Today it reached a high (60.70) that ""closed the window"" (gap fill). We'll see what it wants to do now. There is some resistance above."
"Recent study out of University of Oslo concludes that caffeine is as addictive as illegal narcotics. The study, helmed by Prof. Fridjof Nansen, went on to write that sales should be restricted to over age 21 consumers."
Is it possible that China management from Starbucks has been reporting inflated numbers like the management of Luckin Coffee?

It just keeps dropping. YESSSSSS
SBUX has discounted their coffee by about 30% at COSTCO; SBUX is trying to increase their top line revenue. I believe this quarter earnings will be below expectation. Margins will be hurt.
Is Starbucks gonna let everyone hold hands and run to a safe space provided in all sites next?
OPEN UP MORE LGBTQABCDEF BATHROOMS THATS THE TRICK TO GAIN VOTES ON SOCIAL MEDIA OUTLETS
"Well, I actually visited two StarBucks stores today. For so many boycotting, I must say I didn't see any evidence of a drop in traffic. I suppose I will have to wait for the this Qs earnings report for evidence that this apparent boycott was effective. As an investor holding shares in SBUX it is ALL about China. A store being opened every day in a market that dwarfs the USA. The CEO should know that business and politics rarely mix. My respect for him as dropped significantly, however, my interest in SBUX share has not been diminished because unlike the lemmings on this board who are SO insulted that Shultz has some stupid affinity for refugees, I recognize the fact that the USA is no longer the center of the ""consumption"" universe. Besides, I hate to profile, but much of the traffic in the stores looks like it leans left anyway. Many of those on this board complaining about Shultz throwing a few bones to refugees probably prefer truck stop coffee and conversation anyway. If SBUX can convince 2 billion Chinese to drink coffee and/or high priced tea then I will continue to be rewarded holding this CASH FLOW ENGINE !!"
SBUX not going anywhere. The shops will be filled again when Things get back to normal.Buy the stock at discounted prices. Hold for 2-3 years and you’ll be happy.Divided staying in place.
"Vending machines to replace all SBUX stores. A million machines. Huge profits. But, are competitors secretly ready to roll this out and crush SBUX? Stay tuned."

"Tarnishes the Starbucks name then flees. Shame on you Shultz. I like most of the workers I have dealt with at Starbucks. In fact I can't recall any bad experiences with any of the workers over the last two decades. The issue at hand here is not a worker issue but a leadership issue. Its always possible in any business to have a few bad apples but to turn it into a corporate issue was wrong. Can you imagine if the police did what you just did because of a single bad officer? You handled this wrong, your PR was a disaster, your threw your employee under the bus, and you tarnished the Starbucks brand name."
"For SBUX, the current 2020 consensus estimate is for EPS of $1.37. The stock currently trades near $74 per share. So, that would be a PE of 54. Um, Red Flag???"
the relationship between customers and baristas is the reason to stop buy at starbux. I do put my money on the theory and it does happens in most of the stores in South Korea. Do not underestimate starbux. It is a still great long-term stocks snd company.
shorting this junk right here. 1k shares
Fonz you are hilarious you said you didn't vote for Trump but you sound like fox news never a fault with our lazy egomaniac in your eyes he is the greatest thing since bread now that is too funny.
"Enjoying my coffee and breakfast sandwich with egg whites only at home! The sandwich doesn’t taste like toilet paper and the coffee is way better! Anchor farms Carmel macchiato.,.

I'm sure the BOD was in the process of giving him an ultimatum.
Nice drop. I love it when a plan comes together.

Where is my dividend? i thought it was aug 5th?

Expecting a pullback on earnings !

broke the 200ma now. will break up once the economy crashes. $$ flows into low beta stocks then
hong kongers are starting to boycott Starbucks because the chain is being managed by a company that is anti democracy....this issue has been escalated to Washington dc by hk democracy activists
is this good? i can't see it....
Kind of gross how you have to put your own lids on the cups....3 times now i have seen people either sneezing or blowing their nose at these little lid/cream stations
It is funny to see shares of a company that consistently increases its revenue and earning over long-term keeps getting hit over and over. I am a buyer when I see this kind of insanity.
sugar water
haven't looked at this stock for a while. Did this get hit by tariffs? I was curious why the 20-point downtrend? have cash on hand looking for a buy. :+)
The worst coffee ever. Go to DUNKIN.
Lots of room to raise divy. This is a buy
"Shorting SBUX when the economy is about to reopen, which will restore same store sales, revenue, and cash flow, makes as much sense as lighting a match when there is a gas leak. You WILL get burned...if the latest run up hasn't convinced you this company is dangerous to bet against wait until all of its stores reopen. Sure it is expensive from a PE standpoint but it also has a gigantic earnings growth rate projected out over the next 5 years. If it had no growth then valuation would be a concern to me but rising rates have not impacted it that much as this a stock has a beta below 1. So this is not going to get punished the way the profit less stocks will. PE is not the end all be all reason to sell a stock. I think selling right now is extremely dumb and short sighted.

Love the coffee but no way am I buying this stock with a p/e of 200!! Insane. And people cry about Nvida's 80 p/e?? Seriously?
Trulieve Cannibus gained $1.10 today closing at $22.40. They have a crack executive management team. SBUX SUX!

"If he wants to be President, Schultz should sell his SBUX shares. Otherwise, people will ask if China is giving favors to SBUX in allowing its expansion there . Otherwise, voters will fear Schultz is to China as Trump is to Russia."

"Any Crooked Hillary supporters, Millennial crybabies, and LGBTQ weirdos still hanging onto this dog stock?I told you last week that this stock would be tanking..hahahaha.. Soon there will be no place for the snowflakes to socialize..."
Stock has gone no-where in 2-3 years...now a policy that every shareholder does not want to see. Fleeing soon!
"SBUX earnings number in 2 weeks will increase EPS, and lower P/E, which is why their stock price is rising to the occasion."
Doesn’t the debt to equity ratio scare anyone? It’s negative right now. Isn’t that a sign of bankruptcy is coming down the road?
Think I might sell my DIS profits and load up 300-400 shares of SBUX
They gave bad guidance. Why is it not bellow $50 yet?
The selling is far from over
The new Bernie!lol
fools r selling ...sbux is a cheap stock and already down 20 percent since few months ....so this er is a boost to price back to above 90
One day this bad news will eventually sink in. Starbuck is a luxury not a necessity. People think some pent up demand for $6 coffee is what people want. They compared it Chipolte. Chipoltle is not a luxury and is cheaper than hamburgers at Wendys.
I’m a long term SBUX investor but tomorrow is looking horrid. Hope it can hold 64$
"SBUX is pontificating two year's out. That is the problem with today's market: it is too far forward looking. Stating what might happen a quarter or two out is one thing, but two years? A lot can happen between now and then. Even with the rosy numbers SBUX is grossly overpriced."
"Stock market fear is here. Buy SRTY. It is 3x Bear on small caps.And, Blue Note to Place in the 5th at Del Mar. It's a lock."

Rewarding to see! They deserve everything they get
Sorry for your loss Miss Manson.
"THIS STOCK IS ONLY UP BECAUSE OF SHORTS. 7 BILLION IN DEBT AND 2 BILLION IN CASH. THIS STOCK IS AT 27X NEXT YEARS EARNINGS, IF EVERYTHING GOES WELL. WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD PAY THESE PRICES FOR THE STOCK. BY FEBRUARY NEXT YEAR THE STOCK WILL BE BACK DOWN TO 50 WHERE IT BELONGS."
"Put this into perspective . Buffett says this about See's Candy. Think about Starbucks mega-vast spoiled inventory.Buffett: ""But we have a lot of Easter candy [left over]... and we won’t sell it. We produced a good bit of it, and we couldn’t ship it, and we couldn’t put it in stores.”"
Looks cheap. Will buy 53
"I did my D.D. (similar to what I did with NIO around $3) and ended up buying 1,000 shares today under $5.00 and I have to say I'm looking forward to buying more. I think Luckin' has great potential, their tea products are set to be huge profit puppies, but 'introducing' China to coffee is going to be huge, super cheap costs, lots of stores, and a ginormous market! That final point I cannot stress enough.I'll be loading every red day until I have a couple thousand shares. I'm most interested to see what their new audited financials show, I know some people are weary, but this company reminds me of $SBUX back in '08, after it got beat down on worries about profitability following restructuring and expansion. Post the 75% drop in SP $SBUX jumped 2000% to present day. It's good to see the board being restructured and it gives me hope we'll see LK back on the NASDAQ some day.Right now I'm thinking there's a similar consolidation period of massive institutions looking into and buying LKNCY, very similar to NIO after it got hammered down thanks to bankruptcy worries. Barclays & BlackRock both own ~1,000,000 shares, and I expect more major institutions to buy in shortly following some major red days. This is a long hold IMO, and I'm super excited to see the mid and long term growth prospects of the company.All M.O., hope this helped nudge some people in the bullish direction!"
"Starbux is done,why pay $5. for a coffee you can make at home! The status symbol is over and done with,buh bye starbucks!"
"our fight with China will hurt SBUX, just sold all my shares after years of buying, China will assuredly will have general population boycott, with no growth in US China was their only big hope, may even a great short"
Very poor business decision.

"Starbucks (SBUX) Opens Store in Bali, Expands Global Presence https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-sbux-opens-store-bali-132501078.html"
When will Starbucks open their restrooms in California? Remember when they told the public anyone can use them whether a customer or not. They lied! How does one get the wuhan flu from a bathroom? I miss the days of watching the junkies take bird baths in the sink and using the bathrooms as injection sights.
"I sometimes go to Starbucks, but this company is dead in the water now. For how badly HRB was punished, I am surprised Starbucks is only down 4% pmt"
It’s uglier than expected....https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/01/29/business/lunar-new-year-coronavirus-economy/index.html
Nice day for the bulls on low volume. That makes it suspect. However SBUX moved back above the 15 DMA as did SPX. I have not covered. Today was just out of hand.
Dont invest in Coffee shops that double as Homeless Encampments.Be careful using those toilets! I wouldn't want to sit on those seats ewwwww
SBUX is up 7.09% to 69.48
One concern to be aware of here is that SBUX is exposed if Beijing decides to rile nationalist fervor as trade tensions rise. They have done this before (vs. Japan over disputed islands and vs. South Korea over installation of missile defense). If Beijing starts using stronger nationalist rhetoric against the US high visibility American brands like SBUX can be hit hard.SBUX has 3300 stores in China and aims to grow that to 6000 by 2022. That growth could be in jeopardy if they get in Beijing's crosshairs.
"a recession is coming and no one can stop it. The FED has to raise rates (recession) if not, yield curve inverts (recession) trade war (recession) end of basically 10 year bull (recession) better to prepare now then after the dow sinks 3000-5000 points, S&P migt hit 3000 then it falls to 2300-2400.

"7 reasons buy SBUX: 1#1) SBUX coffee 10 oz sell $2.34, DNKN coffee 10 oz sell $2.29, that means SBUX coffee have more room to rise, #2) SBUX sales continue growth, #3) SBUX have high profit margin and low p/e, #4)SBUX coffee taste are lot more better than anyone, #5) SBUX can open more New store, #6)tax cut and low unemployment rate will add SBUX sales growth in American #7) people who afford SBUX coffee growth very fast on out of American, SBUX worth $75 per share now."

"in USA:mcd and deli stores $1 coffee didn't hurt sbux, opposite: their $1 coffee boost sbux sales growth,why???? because their $1 coffee only get more people drinking coffee,but these people indirectly to sbux, , because sbux coffee better than them, so mcd and deli stores $1 coffee get more customers for sbux,so LK will be as same as mcd and deli stores $1 coffee, LK will get more customers for sbux,because sbux coffee better than LK,LK will be temporary stores."
Today is Thanksgiving. I am thankful for coffee that is much more superior than scarscux. Any coffee is better than a 5 buck o cup. Happy Thanks giving. This stock is a turd.

Wow. Down $30 since July high...30%. Might be buying call options soon.
"I'm sick of liberal CEOs talking politics. Why would you alienate ANY friggin customers??!!! I've had my son and his group of high school friends just say their done drinking Starbucks...one of them is going into the marines...nice. Don't say anything about any group. Not even the 1/2 percent communist party for christ sake. #$%$. I'm out, done owning and done drinking SBUX!! This isn't your own privately owned company moron!!!"
You guys are so amusing. Long Starbucks!
Great move by sbux getting this out of the way on a strong gain. Every company will take a hit. Hopefully when sbux reports this news will be built in.
I was waiting to buy sbux but it went up too fast! Hehe good for you guys who got in at 52's or 53's.
"""Now, the company also offers coverage for procedures that were previously considered cosmetic, like breast reduction or augmentation surgery, hair transplants, facial feminization and more. Starbucks worked with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health on the new benefits. ""Making my latte without sterile gloves? NO THANK YOU."

"Starbucks has played politics too long. So now they want to hire 1,000 refugees? Why refugees over us citizens? I am done shelling over $5 for their coffee. I'm sure others are too."
We're pretty saturated in locations (150 stores is nothing). They still do tons of business. This will recover soon.
"Starbucks is a good coffee house but,.... i have never had such bitter caffeinated coffee or seen drinks loaded with that much sugar.... like drug den!"
Looks like many traders took their profits and ran. The company is still solid and this may be the one to hold a bit longer.
I will be buying in shortly for a two year commitment. They are way ahead of this. There are not prescription drug strung out bums in China and if Trump does his job there won’t be in the USA
"It’s time for NBEV. It’s a unique opportunity. Increased revenue YOY, millions... and the stock is < $2. 2020-2021 will be huge. GLTA"

No ceo should ever take sides in a political side . You are here to sell coffee and make money for the stock holders. That is why you work for the stockholders!!
"Expansion into Asia will recreate the growth of the 90s. This shouldn't be trending down for even 5min. Too many US store? They said the same thing when the stock was in the 20s. This company knows how to reallocate resources and comes out ahead. Up up up, if you're long."
"Market and SBUX continue to defy gravity. After the last two days bears have little to hold on to. I did not cover. For bulls SBUX fell early, quickly challenged the 15 DMA, bounced and never looked back. Despite two very strong days it is not close to being overbought. The bears really have nothing except the SPX is getting close to recent highs and perhaps there will be a little profit taking. News? What difference does it make. According to the market just about all bad news is baked it. Some kind of Corona spike? If it happens it is at least two weeks away. Will see what happens Monday"

"I’m glad I snatched up those $67 calls at close. Please no negative surprises on the conference call, Kevin"
"The stock went up after the diversity training. I guess they should do more of those, eh? But, no, totally unrelated. Getting ahead of a PR disaster is just smart business. People are reacting (or over-reacting) to Schultz, Maw and technical downgrades. The company is on track to decent earnings (improved in the future by cutting underperforming stores). I sold at 54 and bought back in at 50, so I'm ahead on price and have money in the bank. Every two weeks should be so bad. Maybe people should learn about stop-limit orders and quit making up stupid political/racist fear-mongering so they can make their puts pay off."
"Definitely a buying opportunity. As much as I hate Starbucks, I can't deny how strong of a company and product they have"
"Here is another fake stock (SBUX), I bet you that there isn't 1 Starbucks coffee shop that is making enough $$$ to pay the rent since Covid 19, and the stock is trading more than 50 X all of last year earnings ,a real huge disconnect from all the jungle bunnies of wall street,Booyah."
Why the relative weakness in SBUX stock price the last few days?

Clearly funds buying and we could be back on track
"why it is down with good earning, 4 days in a row"
buy at 60

He is prob selling all his stock because he sees what a mess he has made
I think Starbucks will do do good. Stores are always busy. Overseas expansion good..
"WOW. REALLY a bad choice to use funds for a buyback right now, especially this early in the crisis. If there's excess money for buybacks, right now, used it for the employees, first, to make sure they are taken care of, BEFORE buying back stock. This is exactly what's wrong with som many of these companies."

The stock ran too much too quickly. It drops in September. I think we will see below 80 this month.
"Until Starbucks improves the quality of their coffee I cannot be a buyer of this brand any longer. I used to be a daily customer until I realized how over roasted, burnt, and ashy their bean roast is. And all drinks are just laden with sugar and cream to hide it. After visiting a local coffee shop I realized how poor the quality of Starbucks coffee is, now I can't drink it anymore. Tastes like watery fireplace ashes to me now."
"only SBUX coffee can make American great again, KO PEP and MCD sales decline in worldwide, iPhone sales slow down in worldwide too,only SBUX coffee sales increase in worldwide, SO please support SBUX make American great again."
"They will not perform for another quarter and it will go down, but will do better after that and probably for the next 15 years. Wait for $50, then buy"
Buy point coming in about a week I think
Close Below $103.
Grande decaf soy latte.....$5.36.I think thats the last one of those for me. Probably 10% goes to their messed up social causes or BLM. No thank you.
I love SBUX... I enjoy sitting there using the WIFI and drinking my Pete's coffee and taking dumps in their bathrooms....
Closing stores for a day of ‘white bashing’ has consequences. Next time remember who your paying customers are!
The slowing US COMP SALES the issue
SBUX - Just remember who your paying customers are

Then you have India. Think Internationally that is what this stock will be considered. The Coca Cola of Coffee.
the numbers don't lie Starbucks is on the rise and I believe $90 is coming soon
broken company same range for three years your not making money owning Starbucks
Bought on sale today ... great recovery stock!
What a load. No way in hell SBUX returns to pre-Covid levels. Probably half the work force that used to go to the office will return to the office after Covid.

SBUX reached a new All Time High at $68.89
"why SBUX sales can keeping continue growth???because SBUX customers are young people and high school students, these people's life have long way to go, SO SBUX sales never decline forever, it's sales will continue growth forever, strong buy SBUX, you will make a lot of money and get dividend, it's stock price long-term up,"
"Just less than 1 month ago 12 million shares of SBUX trade it hands at an average price of over $95.00 a share , same SBUX is trading today under $84.00 which bring us to where did the $132 million went ? most of money came from the hard working people 401 K"
Ahhhhh anther drop.
Hey Red SBUX up $.19. DNKN down .49. You’re probably at DNKN getting free coffee due to EAGLES victory and the Indians and Mexicans are looking down on you.

"Most paid bashers on this board are unaware that Starbucks sales in China are up! And they wrongly suggest that Schultz is still with the company.

We pay CEOs millions to sit there and give lame interviews; The present Starbucks management will not be able to turn around the company; China is a difficult market to grow and Starbucks is not growing in Europe because they have a lot of local beautiful cafes ( I am from Greece and the Starbucks are empty because those countries have excellent local coffee shops

"The $3000 I invested in SBUX in 1993 is worth $257,000 today. I've followed key numbers along the way: revenue growth, earnings growth, same-store-sales growth, trailing and forward p/e ratios. The last 3 years the stock went sideways but kept pace with valuation as growth slowed and trialing p/e came down to match. The numbers I use value the stock at $71-73, but China growth concerns suppress demand. If Starbucks hits expectations next Thursday look for it to break $70. And if next quarter stays the course look for $78. If and when China goes throttle-up watch p/e and a return to 20% y-o-y growth. The 2% dividend makes it easier, too. When rev growth is 10% and earnings growth is 20%, trailing p/e 29+/- 2, forward p/e 23+/- 1, SBUX was making its 20% yoy gains. Last spring I sold my house due to divorce and put another $170,000 on it at $55.60. Now worth $199,292, that's up 17.2%. Starbucks is a feelgood cheap luxury. I shake my head at the haters who feel it necessary to lie about the price of a cup of coffee and trashtalk the taste and the brand and the people who like the place. It's a great American brand and icon known around the world. Yes, SBUX is counting on China to take the baton and yes, the hand-off is suffering a lull, but hang in there. Watch those numbers. And ride the wave where it takes us. Think about supporting Howard Schultz for POTUS; he'll patch things up with China, unite the world, and SBUX will carry us smoothly into retirement."

What time to they report earnings tommorow??
Starsucks this week but I am positive this is an awesome company and will recover in no time
I see a few new stores in California and Washington state and the folks are waiting in line - in their cars even. . It doesn’t matter that there’s Woods coffee in Washington — Tim Hortons is in Canada.. But Starbucks is the juice that fuels.
First attempt at the 50 DMA was rejected as expected. Will there be another attempt today? I think so. Will it get through? Not today.

Hmmmmm... now I’m even more confused by Rodrigo because SBUX is climbing even higher again this morning
groth in china is vital to starbucks future.
"HORRIBLE COMPANY. Evil, terror supporting CEO. I would never go to such a store again."
Oh Menneth boy. You sure took a hiding from moreland. You can't bury your shame by flooding the board with your nonsensical and irrelevant posts. We witnessed a full fledged Mad Manson meltdown and everybody knows it!
"Bigger wealthy inequality gap is hurting SBUX the hardest! No matter how wealthy the ultra rich, they are only less than 1 % and can’t consume coffee 10x daily individually! The Pre-pandemic SBUX consumers are extremely shrinking! LOL"
where does Starbucks get the supply to make the coffee?
well today was a frustrating day.
"Does anyone remember back in the 2008 crash, you could buy a share of SBUX for the same price as a latte? My thinking is that once this Coronavirus crash hits its bottom, you will be able to do it again."
"Adding 20,000 new outlets? Cannibalization?"
$70B market cap:1) $7B check from Nestle coming before year end (10% of the entire market cap) Poof.2) $5B returned to shareholders already this year3) $20B more returning to shareholders over next 2 yearsDo the maths...
"uhuhuuhuuhuhu….10%...….uuhuuhhuuhhuhuuhuuhuu Magic, keep those stores closed ! No electricity, no labor cost no nothing and still get 90 % of income ! What a country...……..."
"Challenge Question: Can you actually think of a company that is more HATED by America than SixBucksDown , oops I meant SBUX."
Market is being manipulated by fear mongers. This too will pass like every other crisis.
Waiting for the $60 mark again
"So SBUX has a billion shares outstanding does anyone think $40million dollar buyback does much to offset any potential earnings drop. Good news 90% of stores in China open, but the real question is how much are they selling. Also in US what will impact be on closures on earnings. I am holding SBUX but worried about the earnings report and guidance."
"Below 73 tomorrow, then to the moon next week!"
drinking my daily starbucks coffee now...so good
"Curbside service trial in Gainsville, FL. (big college town). Barista's on roller skates. Cute outfits too."
Will hit 80 very soon!!!!
Sell this pig.
"Home prices expected to fall, we are at the top of a 17 yr cycle. 20% drop in markets expected minimum. Spending on luxury and pleasue will drop even more"
While Starbucks is busy 'White Bashing' the white folks are going to quietly boycott Starbucks. I wouldn't own this stock for anything right now. Just wait until homeless people start harassing Starbucks customers for money.
THE PEOPLE INVEST AND MAFIA DISTRUGE
Starbucks is on the move huge upside coming $90 by year end
"Dip buyers in SBUX, wait until it gets to $40 range. That's where I see the long-term support, now that we've broken below the $50 price levels. At $40-42 range, a yield of 3%+ also looks attractive even if earnings growth slows down to lets say high single digits. JMTC."
Starbucks is my favourite place to get coffee. The staff is always friendly.My drink is always perfect.I have no problem paying for a quality product. Thanks Starbucks!
"With Starbucks' continuing rapid international openings in China and Asia, new product expansion, and growth in distribution channels. There is no reason why this company cannot reach the market cap of McDonald or Coca Cola. A double from this level is well within reach in five years if management team executes well."
"what do you guys think about this? buy, hold, sell?"
this thing is tanking because you go to buy a cold brew coffee and they dont have any ?
When is next earnings release date? Heard TV guy (I thin CMNBC) touting September option calls? How about the stock?
"The governors in New York, California, Nevada, and other states are trying to take down the US economy, by shutting down business. They should be arrested by the Federal government. They are working directly with the media to create fear. Coronavirus is NOT A PANDEMIC. People better wake up, your 401k is in danger, your brokerage account balance is in danger, and your job is in danger."
Got to love the arrest of 2 black men in a starbucks while the waited for their friend. Starbucks is really embracing Trump's policies to make America great (segregated) again
Why is it plummeting this morning? Profit taking?
Another great move by the new CEO. Definitely cleaning house and focused on mgt efficiencies. Nestles deal to distribute Starbucks coffee pods and stock buy backs are just two more positives for this stock. Glad I held onto this stock to enjoy the move back up. https://www.wsj.com/articles/starbucks-hires-finance-chief-from-hyatt-1539006456
"The management is very aggressive, with big plan for 2021, expect for the big jump tomorrow, and the rest of the week. Put on your seatbelt guys."
Still waiting for the Starbucks CEO to issue an apology to all the many white people kicked out of their stores for not buying anything. Or don't white lives matter?
All phony publicity to appease !
This stock needs a big drop then buy
$75 Next!
This place is going to get slayed during the next recession.
I wish Starbucks would focus more on their coffee than their social causes.
Free coffee if you vote for Howard in 2020 Will be his campaign slogan. http://www.townhallmail.com/pfjthgsyttcbhytybyhjsbrllvbllyvsddjgkhchfqlvdlc_spvrsmpvjsktbmmbjjlbjj.html?a=&b=02%2F24%2F2019&c=e1b642d82c9b7a40d859e3e2f6063c2e&d=27593076
"The thing about the straws. Seattle -- SBUX's home town -- just went strawless on July 1st. To a point, the company's decision is a matter of necessity as much as choice. The compostable straws are already in the stores in Seattle. That said the optics are good. For today, the stock is as green as their policy."
"i want to by some shares, is this reliable?"
"will recover, 116$"
"On the way to 75, 80"
someone is playing around with this
This will open big $67 minimum

"With relations with China seriously deteriorating, any opinions on Schultz's prediction that China will be SBUX biggest market?"
With economy still at lockdown. Shorting SBUX “should” be where you make money.
"Honestly, based on what Starbucks has done and the fact they are currently operating (comparably at high levels from competitors) - This may be the safest and best play on the market today ....March 19,2020"
Like we didn’t know the virus outbreak will cause some pain!! #simplefacts
what warrants this a 34 pe?
Buy this stock if your smart
DUNKIN up^^^^^^^^^^^^
Guys I just went to Starbucks to use the bathroom and there was NO LINE for the coffee!! Sell while you still can!!
some of yall need a stock investing class lol
"This is a long term. Sbux has brand equity. And mostly non franchised stores and good knowledge of present and future demand. Retail or wholesale, they even roast Costco brand coffee. Will be around long after I’m dead."
These headlines are so misleading. 2nd quarter ended in March and barely reflected what the company is going through with the shut down. The loss in the current quarter will be staggering ( and next). No one will be racing into the bistro for a long while. Life will not jump back to the way it was. Good luck longs.
SBUX PE ratio = 54 Its a SELL.
"Here's hoping that the racial training nonsense completely backfires, and the stock tanks."
Seattle Leftists burn the original Starbucks store. Bite'n says nothing.
Sbux went up 1.67 after market. Still has it rebound.
"they closed half their stores in China, and the virus situation is unknown as far as how long the stores will remain closed. uncertainty. and Luckin coffee is proving to be a major competitor, just give the Chinese time to steal the secrets of the business from SBUX, get goverment backing/funding...and SBUX will lose business in China and rest of the world. not good for SBUX investors."
"From mission statement at website: ""to inspire and nurture the human spirit."" Hmmm ??translation: to provide free spot for internet connections for loiterers to not necessarily buy any product?? And give no guidance to staff who don't want to deal with street people but do want to actually put money in the till.This man wants to be President?"
"Tried a tall Pikes Place with a shot of bitter moral authority - awful. Apparently, others agree."
Is Starbucks the new SHITTMASTERS
My kind of down day
just wow on that 200k shares
Dunkin up today.
Since Dunkin went private the execs at $SBUX won’t get embarrassed as much by $DNKN meteoric rise while Starbucks runs a public restroom utility for Democrats and Socialists. Short $SBUX or lose your behind
The world is waking up with coffee...
Adding on this train . Priced to Hold
"Starbucks is like a legal dope dealer. People just got to have it. Including me. I’ve even tried making it at home to cut costs down but it’s not the same. Very good business. If you look whos is in the stores it’s people from all ages, especially younger generations who will be customers for life"
"The more I read here, the more I realize nobody knows a damn thing."
"AMZN cut jobs, AMZN business has been top to end, AMZN on line sales too weak, people go out more affect Amazon's on line store sales, SO buy SBUX now, because people go out more, SBUX coffee will be sell more, I think SBUX sales will growth over 15% in March quarter 2018,"
What’s with the panic. They are closing stores in U.S to expand in China. China growth is faster than U.S. stock to increase 20% by end of year
Everytime I go to Starbucks the sp goes up
"Options prices have decreased￼ drastically bought 50 for 2021 ￼ if the price of the option goes up significantly by earnings I’ll sell bought $30 put at .17 — also I hope they decrease their LGBT stance and Bill Gates SR founding is a business I do not support, down with new world order business’"
"He’s an ex ceo he left along time ago what ever he does has no effect on starbucks , please stop with the stupid comments about it"
"Today's date: Sep 30, 2019. SBUX will level between $100 and $105 in six months. (I own 5000 shares; bought my first shares in 1993)"

"Sold out completely......ALL LIVES MATTER and they cowered just like everybody else. What about hispanic lives, Vietnamese, Indian....and on and on."
Overbloated.$63
Closing 100's of stores yet the stock price go's up? what am I missing??
In 209 SBUX came below $10. Now all their branches are closed and still selling $77 a piece. I have shorted it at 76.10.If market goes up a lot I would buy leap put option.
Every time I go by Starbucks drive-through is packed I purchased a small position 74.40 !
It'll all be about the guidance
Schedule D with tax loss carry-over coming for demo-socialists that own this...
"Now SBUX can do what it should have done long time ago. Chain and padlock all front doors. No more bums, unemployed and fake employed in there. Seating areas have been in decline for years. Now, they can permanently close interiors and save big money. Employees will love it. SBUX will have a strong drive-thru business. People just want the caffein, sugar and milk. Get it from a window - what do they care. They rather drink it in their car anyway. Safer, have smart phone and car radio. Fleet"
This seems to be a typical pattern with SBUX. Stock edges up over time then gets whacked at earnings giving it all back. Over reaction imo and it will soon creep back up once again. GLTA
Follow China's Market and that will Help you to Position in the AM
I love it it’s a no brainer for me $$$$$$$$$$$$$
I need another roll of toilet paper...I'm screaming at the BARISTA to get on it !
Cramer and schultz just had to take a shot at Trump.Looks I'll be going to Pete's.
"LMAO what a textbook example of the perils of mixing business and politics. Howard took a fabulous business and alienated over 40% of the US with one statement!! Why would you EVER motivate a passionate political supporter to look elsewhere for a cup of coffee? How can a guy be so brilliant and dumb at the same time ? He can rationalize his statement all day long , but it is undeniable that it was a unwise business decision. He better hope China is the gold mine he thinks it is !"
90 tomorrow
don't know what they were thinking opening so many stores that are so close to each other.
djia conversation----mute
Everyone should stop going to SBUX and paying 5 dollars for a cup of coffee that cost 25 cents to produce
"ALLREADY FOLKS CALLING FOR A BOYCOTT ON SOCIAL MEDIA ""We will continue to work to confront bias and racism,"" the statement adds.But Starbucks is curtailing its employees' ability to be a part of that work. The company has banned workers from wearing clothing or accessories that support the Black Lives Matter movement, according to an internal memo seen by Buzzfeed News.That memo cites the company dress code, noting that workers cannot wear accessories that ""advocate a political, religious or personal issue.""""Clothing and accessories highlight Black Lives Matter do not currently adhere to policy,"" the memo adds. ""You can show support for black partners by wearing the Black Partner Network's 'Keep It Brewing' t-shirt."""

"WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY overbought RSI over 80...be careful new 52 wk high, market makers WILL start shorting this heavy soon. MARK IT"
"Howard Schultz board member and democratic supporter, has to close stores for racial training the hypocrisy is delicious. I love how these democrats fail all the time."
I spend $20-$30 a week (a relatively small amount I know). Until they are neutral and it’s a place I can go to get coffee and only coffee I’m done with Starbucks.
Put large screen TVs in their bathrooms to attract more users
"Seriously tho I was told delivery is $2.99 and the Venti is $8 so $11 coffees... Bwahahaha since minimum wage San Francisco is $15, that means they will need to work 44 minutes but then taxes so 15% federal 8% state then SS and Medicare so they make about $11 after taxes. So ya work 1 hour for a coffee! Very intelligent! Gee I wonder why the poor are staying poor..."
"i always buy my coffee (frippa) at McDonald. it's costs half the money, taste just as good !"
drinking much $SBUX right now!!! Every morning is a good morning with $SBUX!!
"Market up, $DNKN up, this POS $SBUX down. It is an efficient market."
The Starbucks premium (valuation) is now dead. Significantly lower growth will only support a 10 to low-teen forward multiple.Anticipate further multiple compression going forward.ATRS 
There are so many people here investing on political views and not financials. Starbucks isn’t going anywhere but up and everyone talking about using the bathroom at Starbucks or whatever go buy smith and Wesson stock.
"Rumor going around on internet. SBUX to permanently close seating. Employees are happy. Stock will run, because operating costs will go way down. Walk up and drive windows are the new cost efficient and no bums model. Fleet"
"Except for lunch, SBUX has lost it's women customers. Why should they sit in there w/ bums? Look people, the charm, comfort and ambiance of sitting in a SBUX is long over. And, it is not coming back to a deteriorating American society. Chain and lock the doors, add more drive up windows, to 5,000 locations, and the stock will surge to $500.00 to $1,000.00. Tell me where I am wrong?"
"After reading through the C.C, SBUX still have some growth potentials of china, east asia and afternoon sales. U.S’s same store sale is not bad as we have expected but it needs to be improved nonetheless. What do i want to say is it is still value here and worth to wait for it."
Anyone have a link to the conference call?
I was at the Starbucks in Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh) today and it was packed. Great to see.
"I am sure Senator Warren thinks $SBUX is the bomb. After all, Howie gives her cash."
Starbucks is Starbucks we will recover most of the losses today!!!
down on a big up for the rest of the market ..big time manipulation is happening
I noticed Saturday that a lot of the socialists who were at the Science March were more than willing to create waste by carrying arouns Starbucks cups and lids which will be landfilled. Hypocrites. I am waiting for a giant #BoycottStarbucks rally. Recyclable water bottles will be the vessel of the day.
Starbucks business is very good. Long lines at my local store. International business is strong also. Higher we go
Starbucks business in China is going fine
sbux is getting too concerned with liberal agenda
looking at the market cap of both starbucks $SBUX 100B and luckin coffee $LKNCY 3B there’s a lot of room for the latter!
60 seems like a good entry if we make it there
"Read that SBUX is testing digital menus in their stores. Isn't some fancy new food or drink item, but should make things more efficient and lead to a better shopping experience. Terrific!"
Almost$62. Where is starshits?blup blup blup sinking in the toilet where it belongs.
Eps cut in half. Same store sales cut in half. We goin uppppp
Undervalued
we will see 80 this week
I’m going to start buying puts along with my stock purchases....
"Careful shareholders, SBUX is likely to follow TGT down the tubes. CEO's should be barred from EVER using the company, which belongs to the shareholders and employees, as a forum for persotnal politics. SBUX CEO should be fired immediately without prejudice and stripped of all compensation and benefits. SBUX CEO should be forced to make restitution to shareholders and employees until all his ill gotten wealth is depleted. SBUX CEO may should serve prison time for negatively affecting so many Americans."
I heard there is more #MeToo shes to drop on Wall Street. Any heightened risk at SBUX?
Get ready 85 tomorrow!!!
"Alright boys I put in a buy order that expires friday, if it hits im back in"
Dunkin $60.Where is starshits.
"closing 2k stores for the time being. market: buying opportunity. I still cant get over this. Look at the balance sheet this company has negative equity value because of the debt load. they are not invincible to increases in input prices, or a decline in demand, or competition. They are at 26 Billion in revenue, and trade at 104 Billion market cap. I know this will probably never happen but what if interest rates increased. I dont know maybe im crazy but debt is still debt and if something were to change where margin declined this company would have some major headwinds"
"Closed right at a 52 week low for this LIBERAL LOSER company....Many avoid this company now. This is what investors get when management promotes their liberal views. Many, like me, are SICK OF IT! Customers wouldn't take a 'starbucks coffee' if it was free...."
So you want a coffee and go to a sbux and you happy.Go to dd and you may need a tetanus shot
LK own both players
soup kitchen CEO
Many people bought a Coffee machine at home..Not going to SBUX again. Habit changing
"Very bad day for the bears, especially if there is a strong green follow through tomorrow. These kind of reversals are never good depending what side of the trade you are on. SBUX underperformed all day but green is better than red. Volume was about average. For the bears both SBUX and SPX stayed below the 15 DMA, and that would make me feel better if not for the 700 plus point swing. Tomorrow who knows, but my finger is on the trigger. A small gain is better than no gain."
going up now
Sell before it gets worst
"This is a forever hold stock for me, similar to HD. I think it's important to realize the next 3 to 4 years will be difficult. The mandatory yearly minimum wage hikes will affect the bottom line of ALL retailers. In my opinion, anyone owning this stock since 2009,2010,2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015 should be up by at least 50%. If you are uncomfortable with the perceived growth, get your original out, and let your 'free' shares trade accordingly."
"Only Starbucks is buying Starbucks stocks, everyone is selling"
Drop this turd. GTH out of this position...
Dunkin or other coffee shops or cafes just dont have the same nice ambience and vibes as Starbucks. i like to get my coffee at Starbucks.
Nothing has changed at this company. Traffic and SSS affected by their politics. $70 /share my butttt.
"I understand their new latte, the potte latte will come in a cup that you can use as a well you know a receptacle and I will come in standard sizes, like small, medium, and large...no italian names so you will not be confused.."
"Appleton, we need an update on a bathroom in 50 Capital Ave SWBattle Creek, MI"
Any idea what's driving the optimism on SBUX stock? They missed their reduced earnings and still the stock is unchanged.
"Not sure how many people are in mood go to Starbucks with their masks on. People used to go there for work, study, interview, and gathering. Now....I don't think so."
awesome day!!!! SBUX will come back stronger for an epic earnings report on October
"Morgan Stanley just reaffirmed its ""Buy"" rating on SBUX, and set the price target at $64.00. Also, hedges are increasing their holdings on SBUX. With its dividend increase and share buybacks on the horizon, SBUX will likely outperform in a long run. Just be patient longs. With its rapid expansion into China, and general Asian market, including India, its market cap will likely surpass $100 billion cap within 2 years."
Got this one at $73 and WOW what a great move!
"SBUX is kinda a scam stock management is using debt to buy back shares so they can make more moneyDespite only earning a total of $9.03bn net income over the 3 years to September 30 2020, the company has paid out $5.4bn in dividends and spent $19bn buying back company stock in that time. It’s similar to taking a shot of adrenaline. While it might feel amazing now, there will be a comedown, it’s just a matter of when.Likewise, in the short term, there’s little concern of consequences, but longer-term there can be issues. It ultimately means that rather than the business growing organically and driving share price appreciation naturally (which it still is to a degree), a large portion of the returns have been driven by a shrinkage of shares outstanding (20% reduction in 3 years), which itself has been funded by borrowing money. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-nasdaq-sbux-100-return-173028458.html"
"If SBUX pulls a .76 out of their hat next week, their p/e will drop to 28 at today's price. That's pretty much a bullet-proof number, with strong upside. Settling the trade war with China and improving relations there will ensure SBUX goes forward at a 15%+ yearly average clip for the next 20 years. They did it here domestically from 1992-2015 at a 20% yearly average.."
Doesn’t support BLM. Boycotts coming....
I love this brand and love the run up this past month. But earnings will most definitely be soft. What to do?
"SBUX will be taken a hit within the next three months, sorry whack-job liberals but a reality check coming shortly."
SBUX is down 4.90% to 71.20
Earnings 7/25/19. Wonder how China is doing? Their economy has slowed; new public Chinese coffee company opening many stores; some say tariffs have given bad taste to Chinese for American products. Next week will tell.
Is there any truth to baby Yoda collector cups coming out? I thought I heard someone mention sbux was going to have them.

"in kings plaza brooklyn, MCD's right side is SBUX, MCD's left side is DNKN, people drinking SBUX coffee more than DNKN, nobody drinking MCD coffee, MCD coffee sell $1 nobody drink,SO buy SBUX better than buy MCD,"
Wow they are gutless. Back to Dunkin fir me!

"SBUX has now declined for 7 straight sessions, on higher-than-normal volume, in a generally firmer market.My take?

Heavy buying yesterday and today
the green advertising for starbucks would fit so good with TGODF so some one should make a desion soon or get left behind
$DNKN outpacing $SBUX by large percentages. Not surprising.

PE of 170 ?
Starbucks is up 4.91% to 82.54
"If you like income, this was paying 20 cents not long ago, now its 36. As rapid growth slows SBUX is turning into a high dividend machine. With dividends growing 20 percent a year. Holding it for 5 or 6 years or more and you've got a dividend super star in your portfolio. Be patient and the rewards will come."
"how many Starbucks are in China? How many in US? How many in other major economies that are getting just killed on currencies vs the strong dollar? Trump is not backing down on trade, China is SLOWING and Europe is basically in recession. The FED is not going to reverse course (if they did they lose ALL CREDIBILITY with no ammunition for recession, which is coming whether you like it or not inverted yield curve or not. Lets just say, most of the pundits you watch or listen to on tv are going to lose a lot of money, at least on paper if they are in overcrowded trades. FAANG could fall 30% as a group if China slows or devalues or sells treasuries pushing the US dollar to parity with EURO ( a very big deal)"
Play both players LK...Starbucks has a 100 billion dollar market cap so how much higher % wise...LK is just getting started and signed a deal for India and the middle east..while I like starbucks for another 10% Lucking could triple
Insane value. Added more share today. Will keep buying as long as it keeps dropping. Only a month away from an expected good earnings which will send stock back to mid 50's. Free money!
"After hours trading is confusing...Why is SBUX up big after hours, I don't see any news....."
"Would You Wait in Line for 7 Hours at Starbucks? These People Did and They Didn’t Even Buy CoffeeMichelle Lynn DinhMichelle Lynn Dinh May 6,2020Comments0The grand opening of Aomori prefecture’s first Starbucks location in the Hachinohe area drew quite a crowd. On May 4th 2020, around 100 people waited in line on the first business day of Starbuck Coffee Hachinohe Tamukai."
"Good day for the bears until this AH news. SBUX will open 85% of its stores by this weekend. Could be trouble for the shorts tomorrow. Curious the announcement came the same day their debt was down graded. Took a couple of runs at the 50 DMA, but could not penetrate. Rarely does it go thru on the first try. Volume was a bit elevated, but nothing overwhelming. Tomorrow? The news favors the bulls, no doubt about it, but I think SBUX follows the market. If it goes higher, perhaps I cover my short, and take a little money and run."
"Pete's coffee goes IPO, sbux will sink to 52 wk low. Pete's is way better coffee. if they open a store next to every high profit sbux store. sbux is finished."
Paying the price. Focus on business not politics. Change the CEO and get someone who is laser focused on the business and is not drawn into the political discussion of the moment.
A vendor bought me a $SBUX prepaid card as a thank you. I asked him “what I did wrong to deserve this abuse” ?

Why does everyone hate? Buy now at $95 and sell at $105 and short at $115. Why do you have to make it so hard???
I had Starbucks for 5 years; take my advice and sell; stocks that go from growth to value get penalized and have a lot of room to drop significantly further; do you think the one day drop is enough? One year from now Starbucks will be churning at the 40s; management needs to stop giving interviews and work on getting their food options much better; notice that after 12 noon nobody orders food
it's nuts this bathroom thing is even an issue. I have gone into plenty of restaurants to use the restroom without ordering anythingand never had a problem with using this. Leave to the MSM to make an issue out of a non-issue.

"wages rise will add SBUX sales growth ,because people have money to buy SBUX drinks, inflation Will add SBUX sales growth too, because SBUX are coffee maker, coffee seller and it has coffee stores, SBUX is coffee leader, it's leading coffee price go up, it can controls coffee price. SO coffee price go up will help SBUX make more money, wages rise, inflation, tax cut and economic growth are good news for SBUX,"

Starbucks are closing storesI seen two big Starbucks close there running out of cash
This is why Apple stores don’t have chairs or sofas. :-)
Starbucks has a very unique business model to help spread the corona virus. SBUX P 15/5/20 42.50
Closing 8000 stores for an hour or so. What a waste for a couple non paying bums
SBUX is up 4.92% to 74.32
"Starbucks will eventually fail in China, again. There will be more local brands like Luckin coming."

SBUX is down 7.83% to 62.95
Drop baby drop.
Linking managers' pay to diversity targets will result in a multitude of problems! Look what happened to Wells Fargo over the past several years as an example....hiring in a PC manner results in unqualified and shady folks filling your ranks!
thats why your seeing consecutive stock price upward motion

A good sign. Went to do grocery shopping today. Passed by the coffee isle and noticed all the bags of SBUX ground coffee sold. that should bold well for sales ! LONG !

Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) -29.80%
I used to buy coffee from Starbucks but I refrained from buying ever since the sit down lottering scandal happened. I have lost ten pounds and don't support a scandal to pay thugs. Am at least I am healthier.
What if people start avoiding restaurants in the us.
this will be 70 to 72 by end of February
People still want coffee even if they need to wait 30 minutes at drive through. I bet they had a killer quarter in China from the bad publicity of LUCKIN
Let’s close at 84-85 end of week

I agree this stock is going nowhere; all I see is students sitting for hours as if the stores are libraries; a note to millenials please study at home or at your college.
SBUX will be forced to pay out 15.00 per hour across the US now not in 3 years.
Nice beat! we will see 90 soon...
"SBUX plant coffee, make coffee, sell coffee and open stores sell drinks, SBUX coffee drinks are very good, I think it's coffee trees and coffee nuts are a lot more better than anyone, it's drinks are very health, SO people SO love SBUX drinks, I think SBUX can rise to over $100 per share, because nobody can make this kind of coffee, l drunk SBUX coffee almost every day, my stomach feeling very comfortable, my stomach gas distress disappeared."
Empty Starbucks this morning at the plaza I usually go shopping at. Guess the boycotts is picking up steam... First time in awhile there were more employees than customers.... only couple people inside using the free internet..
"Starbuck's , Stock Price On Friday , Up $3.81 ; Monday , Maybe Even Higher , Back To $80.00 , Very Undervalued Price Stock , With A Great Safe APP. 2.5% Dividend's ,"
This is a 45.00 stock at most!
"SBUX profit margin lousy. Now, add increasing fuel, food and labor costs; This will be dead money for years."
"Wall St. will use whatever narrative they want to raise or lower stock prices. Now, the narrative is, ""ignore our previous pronouncements that Covid is good for the fast food stocks, to now not having Covid is good for them."" They can't have it both ways. The stock prices have gotten so far ahead of themselves, that for the next two years earnings and stock prices will be flat."
In what kind of world do you miss revenue by 40% YOY and the stock price goes UP. What a bizarro world markets are. This is horrible. Stimulus can't save us folks. This is going to get much worse.
"SBUX is a strong buy. Stores packed domestic and international. Even with Trump's trade war, SBUX is doing well in China. As Cramer would say BUY BUY BUY!"
The in-store line length indicator never lies. 5 to 10 deep customers at the counter last year. This year you can walk right up to the counter and place an order. Please trade accordingly.
"Shorted 1030 shares of $SBUX starbucks at $78.40. Why?? Think about it, In US who drink starbucks?

New all-time high pre-market.

"$DNKN up today, public restroom shop $SBUX down. Logical"
That was a quick selloff into red!
I think the new upscale cafes (latest one in Italy) combined with share buy backs and the lack of political commentary from former CEO Shultz is combining to bring this stock back to its former glory. Patiently awaiting return to the $60s.
I think SBUX is poised to make another run at 60.

Don't you think Starbucks is looking into expanding their offering.
When the company buy back share. What’s that mean? Good?
Dnkn up double of starbucks.Proves where holiday shoppers going.
I talked to Johnson last night. Permanently closing seating areas is on. Big increase in operating margins. Barista's will have the whole place to themselves. Will party on and let loose while making coffee. Walk up windows to be installed with outdoor seating only. It is times like these that drive innovation. SBUX just won with my idea. K

Hope Starbucks surprise us with good guidance.. But I am very concerned about the ER.
A company heading towards negative sales growth for years to come. Borrowing to pay the dividend and buy back shares. Even a PE of 10 is too generous.
The REAL reason your latte or mocha tastes better at Peet's is because SBUX uses different machines that affect the taste. You just push a button... they need that strategy because of all the illegals and uneducated demo-socialists they hire and the turnover.
I think I will buy some puts beforeER
Volume today is only about 10% of normal so far. Buyers are looking for a buy in point and should come in before ex-dividend date.
I love this company.
Better short it! Love it at $35

All liberals claim to be for wealth equality, yet many liberals are millionaires, while the rest of us average only about 340,000 of wealth. People who claim to be liberals, but are actually hypocrites, must have holes their head. Or should get one. How about people who make millions off of minimum wage servers at their coffee shops, and poor coffee pickers in South America."

SBUX is clearly overvalued. There is no upside in this stock.

Are WE ready for a split?

"I can grind fresh beans, at home, 12 cups for $1.10. Weekly cost of coffee $5.50, Thermos cost $12. So my coffee budget for a year is under $300. But $SBUX supports Antifa so go there but pack some heat in case someone decides to loot the place."

"An article appearing in the ROOT today related blatant and scurrilous discrimination at a DNKN franchise by the owner. She called the police on a poor unfortunate African American woman for wanting to use the wi fi without making a purchase. But all the employees knew the woman as she was a paying regular. She was just nearby, didn’t feel like having anything and needed to use the wi fi. DNKN may as well just call her a NGR.BTW why doesn’t DNKN have any CHRISTMAS COFFEES like STARBUCKS?"
sbux is too liberal

"first post on SBUX, doesn't it seem like a perfect Amazon buyout?"
Starbucks has the goofiest social positions. Why don't they appreciate their customers more? I quit going there and now use our small local coffee shop.
Starbucks will easily get back to 100$ EOY. I teach kindergarten and my students show up to school with tiny drinks and green straws. The customer base starts with the youth. Easy 22% Growth.
"Starbucks should take over NBEV, and get into CBD infused drinks. Sounds like a good mix and getting NBEV while its inexpensive."

This stock is in the dog house!
I don't own this stock but based on today's news it's dead money at best for foreseeable future
Helloo $82s.... Will we see an $81?
Schultz is crying in his liberal tears
what reason does SBUX need physical stores? For bums? SBUX will be run out of business by high tech coffee machines with millions of drive up locations.
Does it look positive on earning?
Consumers are broke unless they had a job.
Great Buying Opportunity!
Stopped by today to take a nice dump. No coffee though too expensive. By the way the restrooms are looking a little shabby. Maybe management needs to hire more immigrants. Just a though.

I see long lines in all SBUX and is less likely to go under.
Jumped off the 200dayMA last week. Needs to challenge the 50day EMA and start trading above it to confirm a breakthrough and reversal. Q4 is on average their best quarter so the move could happen early or it could happen after the jan 20 earnings report.
"$47 soon then$46 costs are rising and I don't drink coffee anyways, but if I did I can make it myself"
Sbux is a sell. Buy it under $70
This will go green tomorrow
Will buy if it hits $60's
boycott Starbucks!
"why are you going down in Green market , cannot understand the market, it looks like somone watching our activity and doing opposite , what we are doing"
Buy frsh instead Spangler is ceo
What else does the sugar company sell.
Anyone else think this could go to $130-$140 this year?
i see 35.00 coming real soon
Yahoo forecasts SBUX to grow revs at 50% over next 5 years but last 5 years of reality only grew revs at 14.5%. Make sense?
$50 was the bottom. Buy or Regret.
DOWN
"So this is new news? Any body with half a brain knew this was going to be bad short term for all consumer companies. I own this for years through all forms of “crisis “ coffee shortage, Keurig k cups, General Mills contract, teavana etc. I think decades in investing, this to shall pass. Long and strong."
"Missed their earning last time. StarBucks by me are almost empty and kissing your feet every time we do o in there. Somethings not right. People are boycotting it seems. Cheaper and better coffee at many other places, including Dunkin Donuts, and no sarcastic lefties serving. Goodbye Starcraps."
Starbucks is going up before the weekend
NO MAN OF LETTERS ALWAYS IN FETTERS
I'm getting close to shorting this hype
$SBUX is paying Muddy and Citron and TWJ to bash the competition. $LK is going to to disrupt coffee business worldwide. I am buying low 20000 shares thanks to the shortz. Holding it for a massive squeeze when they have to return shares borrowed and % $ paid to banks.
HeyNobody will go to starbucks if Homeless can hang out there.
Too many people want to suppress this one. Very unfortunate.
good jump today..
Lk could triple in the shorterm..while starbucks may gain 10% in the next year or so .
Nope
Wow unbelievable volume mostly selling is happening. Not sure where is the bottom?

How is this stock being so resilient?

SPCE Space ships going to the moon with a Starbucks cafe and having a drink and coming back home... What an idea?

"Beat on earnings, missed on rev"
I see hundreds of messages here hating on this stock but all our local Starbucks have been having lines wrap around the building this entire time.. how in the world could earnings be down? People have loved getting their drive through coffee.. gotta be fake short posts

"To: Kevin Johnson and Pat GrismerI am a coffee hound.. however, I will never drink another cup, buy your ground coffee or step foot in a Starbucks again. I saw a film clip of Howard Schulz on a report by Lou Dobbs tonight. I am of the belief that China is a communist country who persecutes those who fight for democracy. They suppress free speech and imprison those who speak out. I do not believe in their politics. As an American I have a choice and I did not like Schutz’s support of China. Therefore, I will not buy any of your products and I will sell my stock. I know this isn’t going to hurt your earnings or your stock price but it does make feel good and sleep at night. Thank you for reading"
China is definitely a concern here

Sell puts before earnings?
There’s no reason to not be bullish....these guys are competing in a league of their own and if you think their valuations is too high now you’re insane. Just look at Chipotle.
To all you Trump voters out there cheering this earnings miss and claiming your boycott is having an effect there is no way SBUX would post even 2 percent postive growth otherwise
"Wow. Even on the day that SBUX was downgraded, it still made new 52 week high."
Still feel like their forward P/E is a little too high
Headed higher
Problem with Starbucks - everything they sell is overpriced
Time for Howard Schultz to come back !
ppl just sell it after get dividend pay. lol. dont worry will back up soon.
Tomorrow morning 5am pst GDP report q1 is due.. very very bad one combining with Starbucks missing earnings and sales.. wow expecting 10% and 15% drop with the perfect storm.. did i mention infected case just reached a million.. perfect storm to bring down the stsrbucks hype$tvix
haha up 67 cents and you guys said this stock would keep dropping and it is higher than DNKN
"buy SBUX before New high, drinking SBUX coffee can cleaning foot smells, mouth smells, it can keeping HUMAN'S healthy, drink SBUX coffee better than eat medicine , buy SBUX is better than buy health care stock,"
"Up 2 in the AH,,why?"
All hunters at Dunkin not one at starshits.
DNKN 20 bucks higher...no politics there

buy here?
Just wait until they come out with a new Frappuccino
DNKN up 6x the amount SBUX today. Capitalism vs Socialism
Whenever I read a bud comment I use Joe Bidens voice in my head
all i can say is if tha past 2 days 14m volume was all sell and no buy we would be at 50$ not ..obviously someone is inloading and someone is loading big time at the same time ..lets see who wins here :)
I believe one of the things that hurt same store sales was the Panera Bread subscription
Did sbux beat earnings?? I don’t know
150 stores in the US. Such a staggering amount! That means 3 stores in each state will close. And how many will open?Probably about 100 in each state. And raise the dividend and buybacks? Oh NO. They are in trouble!!!!! Give me a break!
Why does this stock say “nobody drinks here anymore”?
The 52-week low was at $50.02 before the recent upsurge triggered by the federal relief package. The reality of the worsening situation will reassert itself very soon (perhaps already occurring) and the rally will reverse. I think it is reasonable to expect that SBUX will dip below its 52-week low before we come out on the other side of this disaster.

"COMPARE SBUX coffee and DNKN coffee, SBUX coffee taste a lot more better than DNKN coffee, DNKN coffee as second hand coffee,so DNKN need sell ice cream for save it's life, SBUX coffee will eat out coffee market,"
SBUX is up 5.72% to 65.65
China lied
"$108 for a stock that makes 57 cents a year, is no bargain."
What an ironic moment in time to be announcing quarterly earnings. Profits are likely to beat expectations but forward guidance will be anybody's guess with the virus hysteria. China is only part of the profit picture and that could change to the positive on a dime once the spread of the virus is contained.
So Dunkin has their stores open and they lost 35% of stores volume because people were brewing at home and not spending the money. That is with SBUX closed. Imagine when both are open competing for customers. That 35% becomes 52% of both companies. So rev for forseeable future is down 52% when they are open.

"Howie is gone, I heard he drifted out to sea. Maybe he'll find an island with a Starbucks there. Just like the one on old Pike Place."
"Another raise in prices at Starbucks. I'm getting tired of the continual price increases and even though I have no problem with paying for my morning coffee, I think it's time to go back to good old regular coffee. It's not the price. Well, in a manner it is. Paying that much of a cup of coffee just feels like a ripoff. If more people feel the way I do, then I think the company will find itself in a downward spiral. Always increasing prices to make up for lost customers. Not a very good business model at this stage in the companies life."
Opinion: Market's eerie parallels to 2007 should raise recession fears
People will continue drinking coffee! It's an addiction!
"sbux going much much higher these coming weeks. A lovely trade, friends."
robots!!!
Price Target $72.
I got deletedbigd is a bag holder at 57$he said strong buy at 53 then 52 then 51he's wrong and don't delete me again
well..it looks like we're bouncing off the 200 dma. fingers crossed that it's uphill from here.
Hitting $100 today!! Let’s go
$40 million share buyback at $60 a share is only about 720K shares out of 1.2 BILLION outstanding. This doesn't even move the needle to help with earning and growth rates losses.
"Easiest swing trade ever. Still a lot of room to run, $55 minimum. Buy!"
So how many of you chicken littles covered today ? Maybe next week will be better ? Haha
"A good day for the bulls but there was something for the bears to like. The bulls had a green day snapping a four day losing streak. Volume was good but not great. There were some negatives but green is always better than red. For the bears you had a failure to make up yesterdays losses and a failure at the 15 DMA. Plus you had the stock close on the lows of the day. Tomorrow, who knows, but it will probably open lower."
Predicted exactly the price; Modigliani technical analysis never fails; now the models predict stabilization at 48 to 49; maybe 50 but don’t get too excited it will not see the high 50s for quite a long time
"Amazing! Destroys the company, and leaves!"
"Now's the time to buy. Sbux store in Shanghai makes more than double in 1day what US store make in a week. My friend, Kevin Johnson said that sbux will use blockchain so buy this ETF too, stand back and watch it GROW!"

"Hey guys, anybody know anything about any agreement or possible talks with Aurora. I saw webinar this morning with the CCO of ACBFF. He had a Starbucks coffee cup that looked empty yet the logo was always facing the camera. He picked it up once or twice but no coffee on the lid Rumors are rampant. Thanks guys."
Shld I buy now
is there any other stock besides DNKN negative today? must be a real loser to own that stock.
when will somebody start from the ground up a fresh coffeedelivery service ??? I mean 2 cups can cost as much as a pizzawe need a dominos for coffee stuff ...
MCD is a better stock with coffee that is a better experience
in a week from now it will be $50
Lousy coffee & overpriced sugar water.
These new super Starbucks stores raise the game and show the future. They are a destination on their own and a million miles from a simple coffee shop. Only wish I could visit a super Starbucks but none local yet. This is a quality company.
I think the next huge craze similar to Beyond Meat will be NGTF the company that makes the great tasting sleep friendly ice cream for nighttime snackers.Read about it.i love it and recently started building my position.
"Also, the COO Rosalind Brewer is leaving the company in Feb. What a disaster and uncertain future"

"This is what happens when you use company money to support leftist socialist agendas such as gender neutral bathrooms, supporting transgender politics & diversity and NOT focusing on PROFITS. This is a business afterall."
"I have a half dozen $SBUX travel cups. Since I despise the place due to their liberal political action, it seems only fair they buy back the cups as I bought these because they sold coffee, not Democratic talking points. Who do I call at SBUX to get an offer? I'd guess they retailed for ~$100."
"Toady the bears caught a break. Down $2.00 and closed near the lows of the day, erasing Friday's gain. Garden variety profit taking after a fantastic Thursday and Friday? Probably. Despite the 2.5% sell off there was plenty of good news for the bulls. The sell off was on the lowest volume since back in February. The 15 DMA at $75.48 was not really challenged. News? Nothing company specific, but the market in general tends to be discounting bad news. Despite SBUX the SPX closed higher although losers outnumbered gainers 346-157. The market continues to be held up by FAANG or MAGA depending on how you look at it. Tomorrow? I am still short because I feel the market is going to figure out it is overvalued and trade lower in the near term."
"Buy on weakness. Historically, one yr after political sales, stocks goes up 10 %"
Our usual $MCD buffet on Friday will include French Fries as we will be watching the Ryder Cup early. So we are moving it up to breakfast time and the local manager agreed to make us 5 lbs of fries too along with Sausage McGriddles and of course coffee much better than $SBUX. With app printing this is a good deal too. Mobile ordering works great.
bet this might touch 52 today
"guys, whats your opinion the price to sell this stock? $105?"
"The biggest drop from the highs in the last 5 years was around 18% before it rallied back. We are almost there, RSI is 20. I hate to put money to work when the stock is tanking but i think 47 is an eazy 15%"

Motley Fool article on SBUX in the morning! Buy Buy Buy
If china has 90% recovered then Starbucks should have jumped back. It’s going to take a while for china customers to get back meanwhile Usa will lose customers as days go by
Cramer pumping this again at these valuations.....what is his story ..????
The short's caused this action for the stock to go down. When it hit $59.50 in dropped to $58.5 in two minutes. The shorts won't win. SBUX will rise today. All news is good for the company. My estimate is that the stock will probably hit $60 within a few days.
"Thats it guys I sold. I bought at 27 dollars and sold today at $1.33. I have lost $150,000 and its all trumps fault. If Hillary was president this would of never happened!!! She would of closed down travel the second someone coofed in china and she would of made sure $LK would replace $SBUX. ITS NOT FAIR"
"I like SBUX offering Beyond Burgers in its Chinese stores and Chinese sales should do well. However, in the US headed towards the mother of all recessions I can't see unemployed folks paying for their daily SBUX fix. (Personally I brew my own coffee at home with my Aeropress)."
Last time I was in one of their stores was January. Switched to using the Keurig at 30 cents a day
It’s all about pricing power and sbux has it

"$84,70 at the close"
Upper lid on future markets keeping it down I feel once it gets opened she will sky rocket
SHORTED HAHHAHA
starbucks is going to 150
SBUX needs a 3-5 more years of consolidation for the earnings to catch up with the valuation.
Starbucks is up 4.91% to 105.33
sell some #DPZ and buy more SBUX
"If it does as it did when  I owned it a couple of years ago, it will split sometime after it hits $90. Since I am 99.99 % invested right now, as soon as I see what  happens Monday and free up some funds I will be picking up 50 shares, so when it splits I will have 100, and then sit back and collect the dividends. Oh, someone askef why is it  going up, China  is opening up, sales are up there."
Common men.. it's 4 hrs more to go before the close and you're still here. Move faster I know you'll make it 60's.
Big chance this cup of coffee will hit 45 soon
dont know bout u but I still buy coffee when I'm sick
"ave m, ave j, ave u,Coney island ave..............in Brooklyn New York, these busy street don't have SBUX stores, l CAN'T believe,"
"Reason is, Starbucks will most likely close since they don’t want to risk a worker spreading the disease. One can easily infect other customers with the touch of a cup or ingredients!! Thoughts? i placed puts"
Good long-term play.
Starbucks is so much better then Luckin coffee because it will never ever ever ever ever make any profit
"I repeat it was $99.72 July 26,2019"
Boycott SBUX until Schultz says he will either drop out or run as a Democrat. If he runs as an independent and gets Trump reelected I predict SBUX goes bankrupt.
"Grimmikins, old sock, old shoe.Do you realize that if the mighty DNKN can manage to gain just another $7.75 per share (or a mere 16.75%), that it's share price will be right back to where it was one year ago today?Now, you never did answer my direct question regarding your Costco short that you bragged about at $113. Seeing as COST is now closing in on $170, at what price did you cover?Will you answer? Nah. Full of hot, fetid air......much like your inflatable raft."

"Is that low P/B ratio a good thing (undervalued), or a concern (poor ROE)?"
I warned you people to get out of this stock. It is realistic it could be trading in the 30s a year from now. Chipotle corrected more than 50% from its peak when it had some bad business issues.
Nothing to see here. Flat
60 cents per share compared to 56
"BS every Starbucks had like 20 ppl in line, unless closing early hurt them this much???"
basically this has become a public toilet chain that so happens to serve coffee valued at $80 bn mkt cap. Flush this down.
Isn't a company with negative book value technically bankrupt?
"have stock over 15 years , should I sell?????"
Slow and steady looks nice very well maintained track record
Luckin will take Starbucks down in China and now it’s become a office/shelter in the USIf you don’t do the mobile order get ready to wait 20 minutes for that $5 coffee it’s getting old I agreed
Forward PE = 25.51; in this environment? Give me a break.
after hours means nothing. It's what the price is at closing is what matters.

Should break $100 today. Enjoy the new high!
"yahoo doesn't seem to like my replies they keep deleting them, no profanity at all, just truth about this company."
"I've been a SBUX share holder for many years but never really tracked it closely. I was surprised at the consensus for earnings for Sept quarter were so low. In the shops I frequent, one thing seemed to be true: Covid or no covid, people want their coffee. So why the low estimates? What is the biggest factor that I should understand? Are margins lower? Sourcing costs? It can't be sales alone."
Summary of one of my academic article: Caffeine is not taxed heavily like tobacco. Caffeine and sugar are legal drugs around the world and have no government limits on daily consumption even though it is a highly addictive substance. SBUX has thousands of locations with drive thru windows delivery system during Covid-19 and any future pandemics.My paper concluded that SBUX is a long-term buy. It was just published in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs. K
this hasn't hit it's peak yet.
Going back up!!
Wow. This stock is doing awesome. I don’t know how they’re doing it when I don’t see customers in the store. Is it online sales?
SBUX is down -4.92% to 57.57
Adding 
"As a good American citizen today I will drive by Starbucks once again without stopping. I sure would not enjoy being locked inside with my Trump shirt on! They better hope China pulls them out, because I'm boycotting them!"
"Middle class America stand back while this #$%$ wants to give foreigners a job ahead of you !This not America first ,this is America second again ! We are tired of it !Boycott Anti America Starbucks !"
BUY BUY BUY!!!
I find it funny that so many people hate on Starbucks. Do you investigate the background of every product you buy off the shelf or establishment you go to? The answer would be no.
Anyone see joey at Dunkin. Schultzy boy finally fired the loser #$%$.
SBUX has already planted roots just about everywhere. They'll be fine. No reason to panic.

Judging by the action since bad news they have repurchased over 1.5 million shares minimum.. That is mucho dollars that could be used for expansion but instead try to make share holders comfortable
"buy and hold , peoples like this coffee , when pass front a Starbucks all the time is a big line"
Hoping $59 support holds
"To Gary, why do you want SBUX go down more, because you don't have the stock or short the stocks.Sbux is worldwide not only in China."
"SBUX hasn't gone anywhere since Howard completely overreacted to Trump and the immigration plan. I still hold my shares from a long time ago and could sell and drink ""paid for"" coffee for the rest of my life but I choose to keep the stock in hopes the left will continue to drive the stock upwards. No luck on that yet."

I heard somebody say McDonald’s was good competition for Starbucks. At least up till this point I have not heard of Starbucks poisoning anybody
Be patient this is a Golden one jus cooling off that’s all ran a lot this year! One of the best YTD
I expected SBUX to raise the dividend. i think this now will be 5th quarter at $.36/share. Did I get this wrong?
"(SBUX) lost close to .50 cents a share last quarter, why is the company shares are trading @173 X last quarter earnings, when almost every starbucks coffee shop are not selling enough product to cover their expenses and paying for their rent since Covid 19 ? Bam,Bam,Bam."
Obvious target candidate for China. The government will resort to banning business for key companies to put pressure on Trump. Starbucks will be at the top of the list. Their so called growth plan ends very shortly. Stock will go down 15%
It is strange in the market as starbux lost money but the share price did not taste the shock of loss in revenue and profits. It means fundamentals or bad or good news of results does not matter to any of the stock script. I am lost in stock market jungle.
"Don't be complacent, The last recession SBUX dropped to $7. It is trading at 20X earnings before this crash. Most stores in the US and Canada are now closed. The CEO yesterday said that they will buy back shares, completely crazy. Save cash, everyone is trying to get into cash."
If you are selling at these prices you are a FOOL
Tomorrow is options expiration date for Starbucks.
Yep profit taking in action
A split would be nice
why is the stock giving up ah gains with such great results and guidance?
I love Starbucks!
Why is it taking so Long this time for SBUX to announce the dividend increase? This is the longest it’s been
Isabel scare mongering.. Doesn't effect me.. All I gotta do is look at a solid balance sheet and a great CEO and I am in.. Regardless of today's stock price.. Look long term covid19 and you will be rewarded
"Due to strong share buybacks, SBUX has not been trading in a ""real"" market for almost a year. Note the last few weeks as the share price floats higher, weekly volume has dried up."
Sell this stock. Stop going to Sbux. Buy coffee pot= Save enough money for nice vacation
Hedge funds buy this stock so they can tell them what say. It doesn't have anything to do with business.
Starbucks gives you more dividend for a cheaper priced stock! Always a good idea to buy below 100!
DNKN outpaces SBUX again
Good co. But concerned about the Chinese tariffs. Din a small cap imo has more upside and a bigger yield. Ceo wants to earn over 10 dollars share in 5 yrs. Do your own dd.
"True or falseserving of Starbucks coffee at our conference. “Schultz has been praised by the Israeli government for sponsoring pro-Israel, anti-Palestinian seminars on college campuses (“Losing the Media Battle,” Jerusalem Report, April 22, 2002) and his company has sponsored a fund-raising event for the Israel Emergency Solidarity Fund, an organization which engages in crass anti-Palestinian propaganda to raise money to support the families of Israeli soldiers who have died while protecting Israel’s illegal military occupation of Palestinian territories.” Reubner wrote: “Because the CEO of Starbucks is so supportive of Israel and the system of apartheid that it has foisted on the Palestinian people, we strongly urge you to reconsider your arrangement to serve Starbucks products"

"Good old predictable, masochistic Kenneth is back.. In true form, my original post was removed due to its sting, however it's easily reposted.Yup, our resident Illiterate DumDum is back. After his last hiding he went into hiding but is now back for an additional hiding.The threats will start once again, about how ""authorities"" are going to get all who oppose him. This will quickly degenerate into stage 2 where he'll be unable to suppress the urge to interject with mano-a-mano activities. These often contain references to cylindrical objects, large men and violence. Not to worry, these are not threats per se, merely Kenneth's way of expressing his latent (but not well hidden) desire.Stage 3 will entail threats upon ones spouse and children. Again, don't worry and these ""threats"" are merely Kenneth striking out at the things that he doesn't have in life.Stage 4 will involve Kenneth ranting and raving, spewing spittle all over his sunken little chest, pounding on the ""!"" key, claiming victory and superiority.........then fading away until his next scheduled hiding.It's Pavlovian.

Proof we are in an everything bubble. SBUX was a more valuable company in 2018 when the price was in the low $50s.
so many coffee placeshang out for people who buy a coffee and work for hours there they look busy but $5 coffee holds a spot for three hours

She's inching up now
Why it's not showing a BIG GREEN yet in premarket?

This company's business model is a franchise of free bathrooms. The barista is just an afterthought.
"Shultz is best coffee maker and baddest lunch maker, l hope SBUX can get best lunch maker and keeping best coffee."
The rally is based on CNBC report by STAT that has ties to Gilead. They have been caught in the past for reporting falsely for Gilead. CNBC keeps this story up on their website and appears to be false. The market will likely drop at the open.

If he runs and screws the election Starbucks will completely lose it's rich yuppie clientele. I guarantee I will never go there again."
Deep discount. It was trading at 79 last week and now at 74. 99 a few months back. The restaurants are getting opened and SBUX will get all their customers and they are hungry to into the restaurants again.Full recovery and more
Is this really an appropriate forum to discuss Donald Trump or our mutual interest in SBUX
No executive raises per shareholders vote? Is it true?

Even your buddy Cramer can’t help these results. Stock ran up 40% and not justified
SBUX is desperate not to lose customers to the growing competition so it decides to give back some of its profits in the form of rewards card and the stock goes up? Makes no sense that anyone thinks this is worth paying a premium for the stock. The price will slide...

I haven't been in a Starbucks in over 6 months ever since they decided to be a political company. I haven't missed Starbucks either. Schultz ruined the Starbucks brand name.

"STARBUCKS will be the 'shining star of all wacko liberals'. News is they will use closed stores for restrooms including showers (at shareholder expense) for all bums living off the street AND illegals including those in sanctuary cities. After many of these 'folks' commit their crimes against hardworking, legal AMERICANS, they can do 'their business' AND get a nice shower in prior to their next crime. STARBUCKS, just ANOTHER 'shining star' for WACKO LIBERALS. Thanks, STARBUCKS shareholders. And don't worry - a 10% decline in the stock is nothing. There are much more declines to come."
Good time to buy? or will the stock further decline due to corona virus?
I really feel sorry for the shorts they are losing their shirts you really should do research before investing most Trump supporters live n trailer parks not the consumers that SBUX are after they drink folgers.

Rumors of 4 for 1 stock split and increased dividend. This is possibly why the stock is up! Buy now!
"I look back 10 years ago when Starbucks was an interesting place to go to in the morning before my work begins. The company has certainly changed over the years! The employees are no longer friendly / personal as they were in the past, the company wants to customer to be IN & OUT ASAP and that no longer works for me... Gave up my Rewards card since the beginning of the year.... Good luck to the long shareholders."
"SBUX will re-test its Wednesday pre-market low $93 before Tuesday. If it holds, it will test 52 week high again soon. If it fails, it will drop to as low as $70 in a few weeks. The next few days will be very critical to both long and short."

Everyone says he will split the Democratic Party and give Trump a win. Maybe it is time the Democrats look more closely at him and why people would vote for him.. 60 Minutes was eye opening. He said all of the things I think America needs to hear. I was a Republican for over 40 years and changed to Democrat when Trump was nominated even though Hillary was no peach. Hope Howard runs. He'd have my vote.

It’s not too late for SBUX to buy into BCCI. The Super Bowl isn’t until Sunday and the Grammy Awards are also about to come up.
Bought a house in a new development! On my block is 4 rentals! All 4 of them have 2017-2018 cars x2 in the driveway and they come home with Starbucks and cloths every single day!

Oh and they have the newest iPhone everytime it comes out... oh and they have about $500-1k worth of Halloween and Christmas decorations in their front yards... lol
This will see the 30s before the 60s

Now if forward analyst consensus estimates are revised downward near-term, SBUX's PT will likely drop to around 60/sh from 65/sh, resulting in a major sell off. What should one do ?Sell the mature company (SBUX)and replace it with a young company that is about to enter a hyper growth phase....The stock is...T X M DTXMD is a 6.43/sh stock with zero debt (SBUX has a staggering $3.99B in debt according to Yahoo) $148M in cash and analysts currently estimate TXMD will grow its earnings ....over 500% between2019-2020. TXMD currently trades for less than 10x forward estimates and analysts believe its 2 lead drugs will be best in class and have an estimated $2B in peak US revenues.....Blackrock recently raised its position in TXMD 30% to 14.4M shares and Cantor currently has a $28/sh PT for TXMD.......In conclusion, based on current analyst consensus estimates on NASDAQ, balance sheet and forward revenue and earnings growth, TXMD has SIGNIFICANTLY....more upside potential than SBUX...... Good luck to all "
got trapped at @65. can this come back?
I’m enjoying my Starbucks now which I bought at Costco; 2 lbs for $9.99. No homeless drug addicts or mentally ill here!
SBUX is up 6.06% to 96.49
If they increase the price of their coffee in order to better their earnings be careful. It would be the signal for me to exit. Rapidly.
$SBUX now buying Portalet companies to increase capacity in their stores. Venting a challenge but allows restroom users options.
Going up tomorrow...
let's get real
Starbucks customers use it as a office also a meeting place for Senior Citizens and a Library for students free WiFi and outlets they spend hours over a $7 coffee
Massive call option activity on this one. Been tracking SBUX & BIDU as they're two of the most stable yet undervalued stocks I'm seeing right now. Think it would be a great thing to either hold long or call options 100c-abouts. Still has a ways to go. Thanks for reading my fellows
The stock is too expensive but they have people hooked. They could serve junk and people would still go to starbucks. Carribou Coffee is WAY better but fortunately for starbucks no business competition.
@zero cool my put options are looking really good.
"GLTA is all I have to say, recession here and those customers that indulged in $7+ coffee drinks will most likely be purchasing something more worth while, ha!"
Today should be a big day for us longs. Don't let the shorties #$%$ you today. Their puts expire today.
"Who in their right mind would buy this, at after hours, at all time highs, with ridiculiouly high valuation metrics, while all the major indexes are rolling over? This a major bubble and people that think stock prices only go up are going to be destroyed."
well my estimate was 0.65 this time so for sure I'm loaded up everytime below 116
Does buying the dip apply to this stock? Lol
Company is not helping itself being political. Also I think the food in Starbucks always taste like its a week old. Plenty of better locally owned coffee shops I like better and its fun to discover new places. Sale aren't increasing no room to make any money in this stock.
By the end of the year SBUX will be trading in the $90's....
Chinese recent devaluation has be to be big headwind. Starbucks needs to talk to this.
***Breaking News***Starbucks (SBUX) to release its own original online streaming service! Named Latte+ it’s set to be released first day of April 2022!
"Schultz stepping down, so he can join his California friends in the communist party."
McDonalds has better coffee at half the price!
I guess bad earnings will be forgiven. this is not a bad drop.
"all about guidance, and it was raised"
The Grim brought down kevinb69 & joey.U don't hear their mouth here anymore.big is the next welfare punk to go down.
Way overvalued! Should be trading around 30-35
Good luck Shelley. SBUX is one of my 'forever' stocks. My 200 original shares from 1994 is now at over 6700 shares via dividend re-invest. I hope it does go to $40 and continue to add shares at that level. [_] cheers [_]
Dunkin the best coffee world wide.starshits is old stale burnt sugar water.
"Hey chickens, thanks for selling me your shares for sale price. To celebrate, I'm going to buy me 10 of the 4 packs, drink a pack, and take a bath with the other 9 packs. When I'm come out, I'm gonna be brown like a Mexican and smell like coffee beans"
Let’s close at $97 today and another $$ tomorrow and next we fly 
Dog dead money get out
Technicals show next support at 47; if you do advanced technical analysis the number is 48
"all coffee prices have been raised in New York in 2019, only sbux coffee prices have no rise in 2019, so I think sbux earnings of 2020 will top estimates, because sbux coffee prices have more room to growth."
Paying $6 for cup of coffee is history. Time to invest in coffee pots.
"Look's Like Next Stop , $80.00 , Maybe , $85.00 , By Friday ; Good Luck ,"
Put options looking good for this for ER
What happens to the share price when they report the next quarter's dismal earnings?
"Starbucks serves coffee, Dunkin serves heavy creme. Fat American like their heavy creme."
"LK is such a good company, they sell so much coffee that they had to fake HALF their sales....Wait, if they had to fake half their sales wouldnt that mean they arent selling very much? Oh no. WHY DID I SELL $SBUX FOR A CHINESE COFFEE SCAM $LK"
Went long at 103. What's with the sudden breakout in price? any news updates?
so if sbux buys out TGODF will they have a cap mark value better then ko ??
Those who compare McDonald's coffee to Starbucks must be really poor.
A Pro-China company
ICE raided 100 7/11 stores in 28 states arresting 21 illegals. Our tax dollars at work. Why don’t they arrest 1000s at Dunkins? No illegals at SBUX! Over 30000 US Veterans soon working at SBUX.
Costco is out of its Kirkland/Starbucks med. roast coffee 2.5#s for 11.99.
"Hit that $52, like I said, this dog stock is going to die.. #$%$ CEO and his political views don't mix with business. Next stop, next week, SBUX @ $50... boycott Startbucks, the coffee of Muslims..."
Starbucks is transitioning from growth to value; this the kiss of death and the stock has a lot further to drop before it becomes stable; very long term safe to buy in the low 40s
$70 coming very soon?
I think this company would be so much better off if they would just stick to running the business and stop trying to be politically correct. Now they want to pay for transgender operations. Run the business!!!
Great opportunity to short $SBUX. Overbought and at least 20% downside for easy profits.
"Most Starbucks coffee shop isn't selling enough to pay the rent , yet the shares are trading at over 35X Earnings, a real joke of wall street."
"Market recovering because people who make less than $75,000 getting a $600 check? When many households have lost tens of thousands? This is nuts."
"So, now we wait until earnings release in April and in the meantime watch the price go sideways. This is getting tedious."
was disappointed that there was no divendend increase of split. probably next quarter. those that think its overvalued simply dont understand the potential of China. as china becomes more westernized they will slowly move from tea to coffee.
Cramer said this stock would go bellow 50 on the Q3 earnings report. forget him!
I will be sipping on my Starbucks grande Carmel machiatto in the morning
this will tank... BLM is a no go for the bucks well no no for my bucks
"Some 4000 Starbucks stores in China compared to 10,000 in USA, will be a casualty of the MAGA campaign.SBUX should be valued in the $40s, no more."
Overpriced coffee served with a side of liberal pandering.
How is it that America drops mountains prescription drugs and initiates a housing crisis creating a homeless problem and we say it’s Starbucks fault.
你是个白痴 What does this mean if you are Chinese Zi?
Wow huge $50 support
"Sonic will have free WiFi too. No bathrooms. When you have had enough and have to go, it will free up a much wanted parking space for the next Sonic/Starbucks customer."
$SBUX “weather the current storm and emerge even stronger.” ~ Pershing B.A.
"SBUX long run is over. This is a $13 stock for the next 20 years, or until they go broke, whichever comes first."
"Vaccinations being fast tracked. More, & more people will be out & about as the days pass. Starbucks business will continue to pick up."
I agree with Goldman Sachs. SBUX is still only $5 away from Oct high. It's facing stiff competition in China from new comer and also anti-USA sentiment in China as well as slow down in China. It's competitor is about 20% to 30% cheaper in China.
"Bought some 27-Jul call options with 52 strike. After earnings blowout, expect 10% bump. Easy $$$."
Dunkin’ Donuts baby
#Amzn and #SBUX are equal to the titanic right after it hit the iceberg. It might stay afloat for a little while but it going to sink. Jump on a life boat now and buy gold while you can.
Anyone else feel like this has come back a bit too fast... don’t get me wrong I’m bullish long term and own shares but I feel like it’s within 2-3 more bullish sessions away from returning to where it was pre corona
should have rotated from SBUX at higher level into CMG
what happens if china gives them the boot next week?
Should I wait for earnings to buy?
Good time to get in now? or wait and see what happens between USA and China ? (wish i bought it when it was 63$ in April...)
SBUX ..... GETTING READY FOR LIFT OFF !!!
"Over 4000 StarBucks in China, and soon it will be laid to waste bythe US-China trade war.Why would China allow Starbucks to operate in China when Chinesecompanies can't operate in USA ?"
Any Trump supporters who spend one penny in Starbucks are traitors to the cause! Let's Drain the Swamp and Drain the bank account of Schultz by driving this stock to $10. Time to buy from companies that support American citizens and our values instead of the Democratic National Committee and their progressive liberal globalist agenda.
its china usa deal effect ...sit tight ..it will fly soon ..all stocks like this
"Kind of a tug of war with no winner today, volume was down a bit. For the bears SBUX stayed under the 15 DMA, for the bulls, it seems to draw buyers in any sell off. I still think the whole market is to high. Have a nice weekend all."
No one resists Trump and wins
"new to market, is SBUX a long?"
Looking good getting ready for tomorrow turnaround
Time to upgrade price target.
Not good enough. Well sell off tomorrow and then buy on dip.
This stock should not be 200 PE with only 0.62 EPS
Time to buy. SBUX back to the mid-fifties in the mid-term.
Short 500 shares of $SBUX and use the daily profits to buy yourself a daily $DNKN coffee
"Boycott Starbucks, No respect for America's safety, only Shultz's pocket and stupidity. We will never buy a thing there ever again."
sbux coffee prices have more room to growth
So SBUX had two black men arrested for using them as a waiting stop for another associate. What’s wrong with this company?!!! Sell! Sell! Sell! This is a scandal that dwarfs the FB/Cambridge Analytica incident! Expect a huge backlash!
"poor grimy, that Costco short at 113 is really looking bad after blowout earnings and up $ today toi a new high of $195. but at least rite-aid is only down to 1.78 a share even though you bought it at $8 because it was ""stealing all of costcos business"""
sbux is all sugar water.
"I sold this morning all my SBUX. I love the brand and the company, but the market is really overpriced right now and SBUX basically just came out and said they are looking at tough times ahead. I will buy back in when the path forward is better or the overall market isn't insanely priced."
"Just wondering, it's just less that an hour before the market open and why it's popping yet to 60?"
"I am trying to get a better understanding of Starbuck’s new policy. Starbuck’s in recent days made it official: The Seattle-based coffeehouse chain announced its open-to-all policy earlier this month in a message e-mailed to employees.""Any person who enters our spaces, including patios, cafes and restrooms, regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer,"" Starbucks said.Does this mean someone can throw a birthday party for 30 - 3 year olds at Starbucks without a single purchase?Hell they can order a pizza from Dominos to be delivered at Starbucks - the Birthday Party Center!"
Starbucks is giving all your shareholders money to fund Chinese Health Care for China workers
7 billion in Market cap lost today !Starbucks stockholders lost 7 billion dollars today !they did not realize how expensive this stock was and how much it could fall !and it can fall another 10% easily from here as the pe ratio is still too high !
"The stock price isn’t a good representation of in store business, no reason for the down trend especially with earnings... people can’t live without $SBUX !"
"Added to my position at $71 a share, down from my first purchase at $83. I don't care about the Coronavirus, I care about the opportunity to dramatically lower my cost basis when I get the chance. It'll make me that much richer once this market turns around."
"Stores reopened in China, time to rock an roll"
Needs to fill the gap before it bounce
$SBUX $lk $lkncyStarbucks china biz is down What could be it???The biz is bad or LUCKIN is eating up the shares????
"Dude they are not supporting Jinping. All he said is improve US China ties. All due respect, if China wasn’t the manufacturing giant it is today, everything would be really expensive"
Dunkin always the best coffee.
Anybody seen Kored?
$72We will close tomorrow
"Refugees don't use toilet paper, they wipe with their hands. Enjoy your coffee!"
"This joke of a company is still closed down in places where every single other store is open. I can't believe this! Not some tables closed, indoor dining as a whole! Why even build those fancy storefronts?"
"i think the coffee is good, only the company is run by idiots and ceo is dip$hit moron, who shouldnt even work as a dishwasher."
So Starbucks is now catering to the participation trophy winners and not paying customers. That’s a recipe for a financial train wreck.
"When two black men were asked to leave a SBUX in NYC, the entire chain was shutdown for retraining the employees. Will the same occur this time since it was 5 police officers that were asked to leave? Both situations deserve the same treatment. Where are the apologies from SBUX. All I've seen so far are reports that they will investigate. Even the media is treating this with less coverage. More people discriminated yet less coverage...….. #boycott Starbucks"
Dunkin up 57 cents.starshits down 40 cents.fonz trick is going down.Dunkin again the better coffee.
Selling all before earnings. Not worth the risk and covid still a factor
"calls all day baby. great quarter, in the news and on the rise!"
Watch it turn negative today
"Consistent upward price trend for the last month. New leadership, reduced mgt costs, share buy backs and innovations in oversees cafes seems to be working. Glad I held on through the tough times."
Just bought 140 MAR 70 PUTS avg $2.89 each. Since Schultzie running for Prez this makes for easy money as the libs will soon boycott.
Now SBUX wants to train police what a joke keep out of real work the left does not know about crime or work.
Sbux will be a $50 stock soon..
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/drop-starbucks-stock-doesn-t-155429814.htmlThe Drop in Starbucks Stock Doesn’t Look Like a Buying Opportunity
When China adds to The stimulus Starbucks will skyrocket even higher
SBUX reached a new All Time High at $66.75
when are earning coming out?
$85 almost here!Did you heed my advice!
Dunkin still ahead.
"Just read a report about the new accounting change that requires leases be accounted for as long term liabilities, like debt.SBUX was mentioned as a loser in this regard due to leases on their many locations."
"SBUX coffee : back to taste endless after you drunk, SO SBUX can get customers from it's competitors, SBUX coffee sales can continue growth SBUX can continue open New store,SO SBUX is safe harbor , it's better than saving money onto the bank, SBUX dividend higher than savings rate, SO SBUX worth $75 per share,"
Do you think some Starbucks stores will be shut down permanently! I remember that the last time there was a recession in 2008 that happened
Conservatives have spoken. NFL is next!
How much China is in Starbucks
"LK down big, the money's coming here from the China market"
"Let's see what's good about Starbucks1) The company's plan to buy back shares and dividends to the tune of $25 billion in the next 3 years.2) Starbucks app is increasingly popular, enabling customers to order and pay before they arrive, all the while collecting and redeeming rewards.3) Its major push in China.Yep, I see Starbucks at $140 this time next year!"
"Eddie Lohr Jr., adding to his position!"
John is absolutely right. SBUX has a negative net worth of over $7 billion as a result of $19 billion of stock buybacks in the last 3 years and long term debt of $15.9 billion. There is no cushion for changes in business nor funds available for acquisition or new expansion. Cap Ex is constrained by dividends and debt repayments . Surprised when I saw this and sold my position.
Has anyone seen their PE is 115!!!
Kroger bought by Warren Buffett last month will gain as consumers buy groceries and avoid restaurants
Nike going down faster than Starbucks...
"LK down$8.5 now, high technology coffee just temporary, because taste always a lot more important than anything, sbux is taste King,"
"starbucks just cut their SSS guidance for China, the only growth engine"
"A good day for the bears SBUX punched through the 15 DMA on moderate volume. The 50 DMA at $71.61 is in sight. If that falls, look out below. Tape was all red. It did bounce a bit off the congestion level around $73.00. On the fundy front some stores will be opening next week. How many people will come out remains to be seen."
Upppppp
"Is it true that Starbucks bought 250,000 BLM shirts."
easy buy now and little risk just sell if drops below 200 dma
I would buy Nordstrom's or Macy's before this...Bill Ackman is buying Nordstrom and Carl Ichan is buying Macy's. Starbucks Bill Ackman al bought into.
"TEST OF YOUR LOYALTY TO SBUX: Would you rather have consensual carnal relations with a perfect 10 once and have to drink DNKN the rest of your life, or stay with this SBUX swill. Comment as you see fit."
will drop more
Buy and hold SBUX for a few decades and you will be rewarded.
When will be the next dividend?
Stock should be selling for $40 because of all of the politics the leadership plays. Its now a homeless shelter and a horrible experience
Short at $64.785k shares!

Vegas every Starbucks I went to had a line. In the morning it was 10 deep at least. People are buying this stuff.
"Kenneth, could you explain the concept of ""superior person""?. Does a ""superior person"" sell TD at a multi-year low for a massive loss (if one is to believe that you had in fact ""invested"" at all), then ""invest"" in C (after calling the bottom, of course), then watch C sell off for another 50% haircut? Years later, C is up about 50%, while TD is up nearly 200%.Does a ""superior person"" call the bottom in LEH, then ""invest"" in it just before it declares bankruptcy and the stock goes to zero?Does a ""superior person"" call for a dividend cut for TD for the past seven years, only to watch the dividend continue (and be raised several times), while watching the stock price march past $100, then split 2 for 1?Does a ""superior person"" lament the plight of the downtrodden Palestinians, berate the Israelis for ""apartheid"", yet ""invest"" in an ammunition-maker that supplies the very evil forces that so abhor your sense of decency?Does a ""superior person"" spend all of his time lamenting against SBUX while watching it increase nearly 300%, while watching an imaginary $47.770 ""investment"" in ICE languish for thirteen months for a loss of nearly a thousand dollars?Yup, you're certainly a superior specimen, Kenneth. A superior specimen of hypocrisy, illiteracy, financial ruin and perversity.Now, erase this post and reply with yet another of your strange fetish-induced fantasies.Strange Illiterate DumDum..................."

Is he wandering alone through the wilds of southern France, hopelessly lost after having hidden all of his own Easter eggs, or has he fallen victim to some nefarious highwayman on the Interstate? Was he detained by the ""authorities"" for having gotten into a heated argument with himself outside of a local Starbucks or has he merely gone stun gun shopping? Could he simply be out buying a new pair of the Nike's that tie their own laces, or is he at the candle store, sampling its wares? Perhaps he's simply at a conderence.....................Where, oh where has my tiny prancer gone. Here, Kenny.................."

"SBUX has always been the low cost drug provider to the Public. It is a drug called Caffeine. Customers need that ""hit"" just like smokers but the cost of caffeine is far cheaper, and safe, compared to nicotine. Face it people, we are in the legal drug distribution business. K"
"SBUX pass half price (64.87+52.81)÷2=58.69 very easy, SO SBUX can reach New high in short-term, compare Dow Jones industrial average, s&p and nasda, SBUX worth at least $75,SBUX sales can keeping continue growth, because there are lot of places don't have SBUX store in worldwide and American, anything of it's drinks are better than any drinks, it can keeping HUMAN'S healthy,"
"Global sales....The lines are always long, people love Starbucks."

Looking for a 2 for 1 split and .06 dividend increase next week. I know its' only 3 quarters since last one but I think they will do it.
Expect 5% min up tomorrow
Dunkin up 4 cents.starshits down 30 cents.Same old story. starshitsproducts suk like fonz.
im not Greedy.... 98 is good enough
"The shorts claim overvaluation and that this will crash...the company has an earnings growth rate of 50 percent people...it's not like the company has no growth to support the PE..and anyone with a brain knows that economic reopening will only drive the stock price higher once all their stores experience the normal volume of traffic and all of them reopen, restoring things like revenue and free cash flow and EBITDA to normal levels. This is not a stock for shorts...you thought its recovery over the pandemic was painful enough, you'll learn what real pain is in the coming months."
"All the fast food/takeout food stocks are grossly overpriced. They shouldn't be trading above 20 P/Es, but some like CMG, SBUX, DPZ, Jack and PZZA are trading at ridiculous multiples. I would like to buy SBUX stock because I like some of their fancy coffees, and they have a large footprint and loyal base, but the stock shouldn't be above $80."
I have the solution Let the illegals stay and deport all liberals
Love my morning starbucks
Had sold this stock at a nice profit but bought again today on this dip in another account - outlook is solid. Boolean

"I have a small position in SBUX, no emotional attachment to the brand, and doubts as to how well they will do in China (even though the stock is doing quite well right now).Anyway, I'm sharing this from another board. I have considerable respect for the DD that this poster has provided, and this was an aside that was relevant to the stock that was being discussed. ""Starbucks released a newly designed “cat paw” coffee cup for ¥199RMB( $30 USD). People stayed in tent overnight in front of the store to buy it! People sell online for ¥1800RMB/one cup!

Boycott this leftist anti American company. Lots of places to get good coffee without giving money to this leftist pig.

All I know is every Starbucks drive thru is wrapped around the building.I have never seen one not busy
$DNKN a better value for consumers than $SBUX
Ackman likes commie coffee......
"the lines in sbux are insane, everyday, all day! how is this stock not at 100?"
The WORST coffee in the world along with its fatty food
"SBUX have to open New store in busy street brooklyn New York ,because these busy street don't have SBUX stores, SBUX stores too far from busy street and residents, people have to drive car to buy it's coffee. there are lot of busy place don't have SBUX store in Brooklyn, New York. SO SBUX sales have a lot more space to growth."

I have significantly reduced my caffeine intake while WFH and I'm sure so have many other people. You realize how powerful of a drug / artificial stimulant it is when you start cutting down. So many withdrawal side effects. Not sure why the stock price is up considering that their shops are ghost towns.
Now known as Sanctuary Starbucks.
slow and steady increase wins the race. This is a fair long term stock to buy
District on Long Island is now making baristas come in after store closes to do extra cleaning because they can’t spend$$$ to hire prof cleaning service! True story
Those who are worried about sales.. Why? Covid19 has skewed everything and these reports will be irrelevant as the market has already priced covid19 in. SBUX imo will now trade between 62 and 80 for the foreseeable future.

"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016.

"Changing of the guard here and SBUX is yesterday's news. May do ok but the future growth outlook in this is vaporized. Up 3-5% in the past 6 months is sad compared to LK up over 150% in the same 6 months. Hare to Tortoise, this Hare (LK) has power boosters of a space shuttle vs the speed of a donkey with SBUX."

"SBUX has real world experience with this in China. Most of their stores are back open over there. Don't forget all these people working from home or quarantined at home will be brewing their own coffee. I only drink starbucks at home. If management is not freaking out and is doubling down to buy back more stock, we should follow as they have their finger on the pulse of this company.

This stock is trading just like amazon did for the past two weeks (not much upward momentum). This tells me the smart money is getting out or not interested in any upside suprise. I would be careful getting in now or perhaps securing whatever profit you have from the 40% upside this year.

"From 1992 to 2020, SBUX averaged a yearly 10% increase in revenue, a 20% increase in earnings, and a corresponding 20% in stock price. Those are the yearly averages over that time. I was and am an investor in SBUX that entire time, and have logged the data. Along the way their ttm P/E averaged 30+/-2; a premium in their sector but reflected their 20% yearly gains in EPS stock price, and recently their dividend increases. They maintained a yearly average forward P/E of 24+/-2. It's going to take 3 quarters to get back to normal operations, and then 4 more quarters of .75+ EPS to get their historic benchmarks back on track. Today's ttm P/E is in the 60's; twice where it normally would be if things were normal. I feel SBUX will trade in the $55 to $95 range over the next 2 years, with the low occurring within the next 3 months."
stock should drop back to 75

Gotta wonder if the Chief Operating Officer of Starbucks decided to leave once faced with the challenge of “hiring and promoting an individual based on the color of their skin”. I cannot imagine a more difficult or asinine request from management in a position that demands hiring and promotion of the most qualified candidate.
Why is it rallying into the close.....

"Now pe 30 is very high and analysts expected it to fall to the 40's exactly what I predicted based on missing same store sales growth..The only thing holding it up is naive retailers and large stakeholders who need you to buy the shares from them slowly so they can get out !Overall, same-store sales for the company rose 4 percent during the quarter, with same-store sales in the Americas up 5 percent and China growth up 6 percent. U.S. same-store-sales growth was 4 percent, the company said.Analysts expected the company to post overall same-store-sales growth of about 4.9 percent, according to StreetAccount. In the Americas, same-store sales growth was also expected to be up 4.9 percent, while China growth was anticipated 5.5 percent.Mark Kalinowski, a Nomura analyst, said that buy-side analysts expected that if Starbucks reported only 4 percent growth in U.S. same-store sales it could send the stock plummeting by $3 or $4. Shares initially rose during aftermarket trading on Thursday, jumping as much as 6 percent, before reversing to just under 1 percent.The company cited a 1 percent decrease in traffic for the lower-than-expected same-store-sales growth in the U.S."

"When the pandemic hits hard enough, there will be mandatory shelter-in-place orders. Starbucks will be closed as it is non-essential. It is a matter of time.

Still a great price for SBUX atm
"$DNKN up, $SBUX down. Monotonous."
i am really disappointed in this political decision by starbucks. I have been drinking their coffee daily and use their ground coffee at home for 20 years but now i just feel disgust. Why cant these companies just shut their mouths and stop with the advocacy? Don't they realize half the coffee drinkers support Trump? Dumb dumb dumb.

Buying back in has already started. Told you shorts not to get your hopes up. Professor says not to buy here...some professor. Meanwhile analysts think otherwise. People who lean on the P/E like Professor are completely missing out on the fact the company right now has a large chunk of their stores around the world closed down and that there is lots of potential value still to be unlocked. We aren't getting a mean reversion anytime soon. Not to mention SBUX has no formidable competition to speak of when it comes to coffee. Only an idiot can't see this.
"Nothing to do with politics and everything to do with dollars and sense. I believe SBUX has gotten too far ahead of itself since mid March.

The problem with Starbucks has nothing to do with politics; actually I admire the company that they try to provide good benefits to the workers; however they HAVE STOPPED GROWING and that is deadly as a stock; they are going to be in the penalty box for the next two years. If your horizon is super long stay with the stock but personally I can find thousands of better companies to put my money
"Really don't know to much about company financials just enough to get me in trouble. I had a little extra cash to play so I bought this stock (2,343 shares) back in July last year when it hit rock bottom because of all the negative news coverage , thinking it would most likely bounce back at least 10 to 15 percent and I would take my gains and run. I had a little scare in December and almost sold but I'm still hanging strong, never imagine it would almost double in a year. Now all I worry about these days is paying the dam taxes on this monster. I hope many people are enjoying the same situation....and remember haters gonna hate, glad I didn't listen."

"Today, all of the major stock indexes are declining sharply lower falling by more than 1.0 percent on the session. This decline comes after a huge rally that started on December 26, 2018 and lead to a near term overbought condition. Whenever you see a big broad based decline such as today it is important to look for stocks that are holding up in this sell off. A few stocks that are trading higher today include Starbucks Corp (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (NYSE:CMG). The one thing these stocks have in common is that they are all restaurant stocks. Now if these market indexes decline further over the next few days or weeks it will be important to see how these key stocks hold up over that time period. In fact, the restaurant sector should be watched closely. These stocks could emerge as the leaders in the next rally."

"This end of the quarter window dressing, sell your losers. Next week buyback will start, they announced cfo today to get out bad news before end of quarter. Easily above 50 next week, great longterm entry point."

"P/E of 68??? When the bottom falls out, you'll better cash out quick. Starbucks' ttm P/E has historically been 30 =/- 2, while their forward P/E has historically been 24 =/- 2. Next quarter their ttm EPS will go even lower, and it will be 2 years before their ttm EPS gets back to $3."
The one and only reason this most recent kerfluffle is a thing is that it was recorded and put on the internet for all to see. It's like viewing the process to make sausage. This is a wonderful model for the shakedown industry. Just like insurance fraud only more insidious.
"Priced for perfection , so they missed that"
Powerful move.GLA.
"Just watch and see ... when earning post, The stock will shoot up like tsla (lol ok not quite like that) but still lots of money to be made here. People can’t survive without their $SBUX !"
does anyone have an update on dnkn stock today?
"Technology has been ""momentum"" driven for a long time. Also; once SBUX problems are fixed (if they are ever fixed) than it will be too late. There are big premiums to be paid for stocks that have ""sunny forcasts"" and even those are not guaranteed..."
Rapper Common training Starbucks employees about anti bias? Doesnt he hate Donald Trump and All Republicans. He is very opinionated and controversial to be teaching anti bias. Is Colleen Kapernick in Starbucks next training session?
A lot of $ for sugar water.
This going to 40 soon

77.48 is what needs to break today then 77.94. It's wide up into 78+ with any buying pressure.
Well Mroeland. It looks like we've finally induced a MAD MANSON MELTDOWN! Just as you predicted!
You have no idea how many travellers were ordered during the 12 days of Christmas.This is going to look really good!
Starbucks 5-1 Split Coming which should make 6 Billion shares outstanding!!!
"SBUX, the company that supports hidden cells coming in ."
Does this go down after dividend?
Does $SBUX really trade at a 39/PE? Talk about insanity. Coffee company trades at high growth tech valuation.
SBUX should be renamed white guilt incorporated.
CEO focused on political distraction to cover his ineptness at managing the numbers. Where is the board on this one?
The party’s over.
National Starbucks boycotting! Everyone I know is talking about stop going to buy this anti America over priced #$%$ coffee. sold my shares.
A move down soon. This isn't good entry point.
10.000 shares bought at 51
"A good day for market bears, not so good for SBUX bears. Yes SBUX went down, on some volume today, but it fell at half the rate of the S&P 500. SPX pierced the 15 DMA, and SBUX was above it for a while today but ultimately closed quite a way away. SBUX is 4.25% above the 50 DMA, and SPX is just .25% more. If these lines are crosses look out below. I doubt ther will be a challenge tomorrow, but perhaps Friday. News? SBUX got a compliment from Jefferies. Perhaps that is why it held up so well today. Still short at least until it challenges the 50 DMA. If it bounces off I will cover and take a small gain. If it puches through I will take a large gain in the neighborhood of $66.00."
Any news yet??
"Shares are plunging, stop price is diminishing, and value is lost in dilution. It will only get worse from here. Stay away at all costs from satanicsucks."
$50 would be a very reasonable price for SBUX right now...fair value.
$SBUX entering into new market to merge their interest in bathrooms with coffee. They will offer coffee enemas at a fixed price of $20 to improve the health of their customers. A “hot shot” will achieve the stated objective followed by an “iced shot” to relieve any temporary inflammation. Should improve margins and allow for the addition of multiple restrooms that can double as enema rooms. These guys can make money out of the ****storm they created recently. No word on insurance reimbursement in the USA. Gerbil removal will be a $99 charge.
"I believe there are operational issues at Starbucks costing the company about 1/2 billion dollars of bottom line. Specifically, faulty equipment is making them use 3x more coffee on espresso drinks, costing loyalty, and redundant labor, not to mention all other direct costs of electric, water, cups, etc. if just 1/3 of the store have older faulty equipment, the cost to bottom line is between 350 and 700 million dollars. Because of the upgrade cycle at Starbucks, this cycle will continue for years."
Adding on any weakness.
"New first lady to make an example of former cyber bully. I fully expect Mrs. Trump to hold KCM out as an example of what can happen to a cyber bully. Every cyber bully will eventually have their own Chatham Branch incident, Melania will remind us. Be nice and respectful online, or you too will feel the sting of your own self pepper spraying."
"The far right threatened boycotts of DIS, SBUX and TGT a couple years back... To those who did and are still reading this message board, please reply so I can ask you to threaten boycotts of the others stocks I own. BTW... Thank you!#DIS, #SBUX, #TGT"

"Will There Be Condequences Kenneth?. For my support of Starbucks and CEO Schultz? Can I expect a visit from the so called People's Army, aka Dumb Peoples Army or DPA?"
Who needs REPUBLICANS ?
It’s amazing the talking heads refuse to even consider that this might be due to social issues
"I was wondering if $DNKN was going to let non customers in to use the lobby and bathrooms. My local manager said no, they were going to refer them to $SBUX"
there's Always a Long Line @SBUX!!! GOOD 4 INVESTORS!!!
Starbucks has 16.3 million reward users and climbing that's powerful strong growth and getting right poeple this is great stock proformance model
P.S only reason it’s $0.25 worth of coffee is because of the fair trade agreement!
SBUX back to 5 bucks like 2008?Whose going there now? Not me
tmw is double star day
Starbucks are always packed
If you don't want coffee meet at the park
Long lines at ours in Tampa
Good day to short SBUX or buy puts. They slightly up the new stores before 2022 in China. I still think tea cannot be replaced by coffee in China. And Luckin will keep kicking Starbucks' #$%$. The management needs to come up with something to excite the stock holders. Today is the day but they will fail.
"BUY AND HOLD, THANK ME LATER ROUMD XMAS TIME"
"Jane, you were a cheerleader here. You had all positive comments here and now your jumping ship?"
"Kenneth, your little cartoons aside.........your claim to have ""shut my mouth"".......blah, blah, blah.........You do realize that just because you won't engage in conversation, doesn't mean that you've muzzled your opponent, right?Now, could you explain your call on JNUG and tell me about the impending dividend cut in TD?Nah, didn't think so.Post some more cartoons and respond to yourself in the third person, strange lonely old dude."
"Negative net value, too much expansion/debt, too expensive, fad over, down to -0- soon."
Trying to think of one example in which getting political helped the shareholders......anyone?
More hunters at DNKN
The only thing I don't like about starbucks is the line is always to long just bought another 1000 shares on the dip have owned since 2014 have doubled my money since these are free.
Your smoking straight up rocks if your buying at these prices...
"If people can buy a 6 pack of beer and eat a big Mac at Mcdonalds, I am sure people will always be able to go buy a Starbucks coffee"
$90 here we come!!!
I’m looking forward to the newly designed U.S. stores.
SBUX just whipping DUMPN's tail today. Lil Rimster must feel like Charlie Rose. The jig is up lil fella. Down you go!
Wait till they figure out that Starbucks is not an essential business. Start buying below 55
"Sanders kicked out of restaurant because of who she works for.... what a nasty precedent set... so no matter what background the person is you can kick them out if you just don't like their boss. Starbucks can use that excuse: ""we didnt kick them out because they were loafing in our restaurant it was because we didn't like who they work for."""
this stock is worth 35
I guess you can't make as much running a homeless shelter as you can running a business
Pure over-reaction! I am in and long.
Trying to decide if I should sell.
just comparing a cup of black coffee from Dunkin Donuts to a cup of black coffee from Starbucks and you will see Starbucks wins every time. that is if you like a strong and Rich cup of coffee!
What does Bathe Boy mean anyways?
"Oh Kenneth Boy, are you going to join us in our little yule tide end of the year celebration? Come on over and have some egg nog and cookies boy. Rim is here and he brought some shrimp on a stick. Ya never know, we might even sing a few karols. C'mon Kenny, you don't wanna miss this. You can even bring your pet goat Leroy."
sbux in great position as a downturn in the world economy is starting
Passed by a Starbucks Sunday afternoon and the drive thru line was looooong
Rock solid!!!
So now I can go ask to use the locked bathrooms without buying anything. If they don’t let me I can sue! The homeless can all now hang out there without buying and taking a bath in the bathrooms.
What's up with those wacked-out over paid coffee makers refusing service to cops? Most of these punks are lucky to have a job that pays so we'll with benefits.
Long SBUX!
Sbux huge reversal up to minimum 55 can go vertical to 70 and higher there is more news to follow . Infinity reversal up
"It moves down no matter how the market goes, I am so mad about this stock"
"this is dead money, until they raise the dividend again."
"Sell advertising in their bathrooms, since their business model is running a franchise of bathrooms."
Earnings next week will be critical to direction of the stock. I believe the analysts are too high with there estimates and I think Sbux will crater after earnings. It will create a good long term buying opportunity. My 2 cents.
this new CEO is so square stock goes down to 45 before replacing him
"SBUX executives are destroying its own company from within. First it was preferential treatment to illegals, then having innocent people arrested, then a place for the homeless and druggies to loiter. Why haven't the entire executive team (including board of directors) been fired?"
Dunkin superior coffee to starshits.
Upgrade to 107
Great results and great dividend raise!
Great Call!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
After hours looking good
now deatholl rise to about 136 virus this getting alotlot worst and strongerbe warned warned seethis crashingbelow $65 in 2020when you shut down haalf your store in china and could do a complete shut down in china coming days to week this will diffently hurt your revenue and earning number ii the coming q1q2q3 in 2020
bizarre price action on a solid market day.. wth?
I wonder if the $SBUX employees are feeling good about their stock options. Baristas might go on strike. Power to the people who don't buy anything. Long $DNKN
Great dividend growth and stock appreciation. Reinvesting my dividend has proven to be a wise move.
Bought in 2007.. was down 75% for 3 yrs. Now up over 600%. Just buy it you have long horizon and don’t look at it.
"will be interesting to see what they end up at tmrw. If it's negative news, this will probably drop a good stone. Then it will go back up. people are addicted to coffee."
Earnings better go better then Intels today.. Good revenue and still got battered in after hours.
Wonder when they'll re-open for inside seating. Around Chicago they still have a no inside seat policy.
news came out .. reccession b.s. fear is gone for 2020..rest comfortably tonight cz Starbucks will be fine
"Chinese people are a lot poorer than Americans on the average. I'm not an investor yet, but I don't think quarters and dimes in China would make a big difference"
"Lol, classic. Y'all shorters are gonna lose your money, and those who went long on the slip will laugh it up. Keep the shorting fellas, I wanna make more money. #TrumpIsSecretlyGay"
will China Joe really inact a 100 day lock down ie marshal Law ???how will that be for SBUX profits ?
SBUX remains and will be a strong company
Looks like boycott is workingEasy short
"i mean yes there are short term issues here, but there is also the balance sheet. They are loaded with debt. they're very profitable so not a huge issue but i would still be cautious of buying a coffee shop that trades around 4x revenue"
sbux is green but unermarket. Monday will start red and finish green. LET'S GO UP
I think I will have a Grande please!
Let the boycott of Starbucks begin. Trending on Twitter.
Declares a loss and the price go's up???
is this a good stock to buy
Starbucks Price Target Raised to $81.00/Share From $75.00 by Morgan Stanley yesterday. Well I guess that means were over valued here lol
Downgrades will take this back to $62
Love Starbucks drinks and the cheese danish and egg bites and lemon loaf
I told you guys Modigliani technical analysis shows 48 a strong support line
If they know anything guys they are keep it to themselves... I see no truth to the rumours from this lot
Went short after hrs. Too many unknowns with this Woke pajama boy company

All the while going up. hmmm. How long will the boycott last?
"A truly evil company. I like it. Waiting for a pull back. They have exelent tasting coffee and snacks, second to none. The driveways are always full here. Who else here likes Starbucks Coffee ?"
"Hey, ""Lekes mees askes you soomeseen"" (Maria Bataromo talks like Popeye). How much is a large coffee with 15 add-ons? And, 30 add-ons?"
Nobody ever drank beer from a straw. Just sayin.
Strong support at 200ma
Pricier brews and premium food will make SBUX SOAR

"the PE ratio will come down quickly when the stores open for inside seating and ""impulse"". buying"
Does this ever go up 2 days in a row? What trash. Gave up most of yesterday mornings gains by the afternoon and will give back the rest this morning.
A couple days at 48 and then dive to 45; advanced Modigliani technical analysis will show this pattern
Trump had SBUX in the white house today I repeat Trump had SBUX in the white house!
SBUX has special Christmas Blend and a Christmas Reserve coffees. DNKN has insipid coffee only drunk by Hindoo cab drivers and freeloading cops.
funny how some shorty shorts still have hope for this stock to go down ..while SBUX is gonna be the next wholefoods to be aquired soon !
just to let u know its forming a cup I think it's not fully there yet but only half there this might be its lowest it will go for a long time!!!
"(SBUX) is a simple coffee shop that serves most of their product from frozen,and 6o% of (SBUX)coffee shop will not survive in the next 6 months Booyah."
headed to $20
You know a stock is about to go up when all these shorts come out of nowhere talking smack lol!
sbux holding tooo nicely ....booosting power to sky rocket
SOLD. Out of Starbucks.
There’s lines at all the SBUX around here even at 630 in the morning when I’m on my way to work.
all the sbux i see have line ups around the block at the drive thruwhy dont they have take out walk away at the front door. order online wait in line. just like the drive thru but on foot
"Notice the 'gap down' (candlestick charting) back in mid-Feb. Though the gap or window has been filled/closed since, that gap now establishes 'resistance' to future upward moves. This latest #$%$ in Philly may solidify that resistance, as 'corporate' has now opened their doors to any number of non-paying squatters at the inconvenience of those who actually fill the coffers."
"To take advantage of these sales season, bought 2 $SBUX. I believe that this company have potencial to growth."
They have stopped buying back their stock - that's as good as issuing a sell rec!but of course they still want retail to buy. what a scam. buy all you can at these prices and good luck.
Nice chill morning for the shorts to go for a run
what's wrong with this pozz?
my coffee at starbucks is less than 3 dollars
"Man ive been waiting for long for a pullback, i should of simply jumped in a long time ago... SBUX is a money printing machine with there over priced coffees"
Keto
"Bad and over priced coffee, save yourself $1200 go to McDonalds. Better and cheaper."
Why is everyone on this thread so angry it’s going up? Lol
"A question for the accountants here about leverage ratio (total debt/total assets). If I read their balance statements correctly, this company is primarily using debt financing...in fact for the year ending in 2018 their leverage is a whopping 95%. Can someone explain why that is not terrible particularly during a recession?"
"SBUX can rise to $100 per share in 12months, because it's sales can continue growth, only SBUX have strong business in Brooklyn New York, others business too weak, SBUX business remodel have been finished in December quarter 2017,it's business can continue growth in remodel time ( Amazon's effort) SO SBUX earnings can keeping continue growth after remodeled, don't sell your SBUX, strong buy it,"
"Starbucks to buy into Aurora? I'm hearing a rumor of this! Think coffee and bud at the same shop. Relax, take a sip. Take a puff. All goooodddd."
My advice would be to drop SBUX and pick it up again a few weeks.1) Their earnings are most likely going to miss2) Fewer customers3) Closed stores4) Poor communicationCaffeine is a drug. You don't mess with people's drugs or you will get slapped.I am currently mad at Starbucks because they closed without telling me. I need this caffeine to keep me going at my job.I never invest in a company I myself am mad at as a customer. haha ;-)
Nice consolidation after it's move higher. Will go back to $100 range...
Mid 80's coming soon...
Is this the dip we have been waiting for lol. Get in before we hit $90
Question this stock seems to expensive at this price do you agree
time for a split for SBUX??????
Dunkin up double that of starshits.Dunkin the new american coffee.
Any explanation for the ceo selling 9m worth of shares??
"Stock is down 1%, did socialist Howard open his mouth again?"
"I talked to my sister and we're going to have the family reunion at Starbucks this year. They have tables, A/C and the restrooms are close. They clean up after the party."
"With Panera rumored to be up for sale, I always thought that a merger with Starbucks would be a great fit since SBUX still hasn't gotten its food act together. I'm sure it would be a pricey transaction but does anyone see it as being financially feasible?"
How muchis sbux dividen pay
I've been boycotting Starsucks ever since Howie decided to alienate conservative customers. I'm never ever going back.
Just watched a super interesting video on YouTube talking about how Starbucks is effectively a bank. Definitely worth a watch if you are an investor https://youtu.be/mr039xnco-8
Sorry made mistake. NY Socialist lady is 28 not 20
This weekend stbux offered employees 30 day paid leave if they do not want to work during this crisis. They will not have enough people to man the ship come tomorrow
Looks like earnings was seen as a vente cup of nothing.

Friday Bloody Friday for DNKN. Where R U Big Rimster? Hiding under the bed? HAHAHAHAHAHA
Some one please tell me how is it possible that this market keeps holding up? Are investors totally clueless as to what’s really happening out there??
First day back to School.Coffee Business is busy as all get out!!!!
Philipit’s a broken company that’s become political with no further growth or price increases can you spend $8.00 for a coffee it already cost you $5.00 also they have competition in China their heaviest invested expansion they lost their CEO because he wants to be president like Trump the new CEO is a lame and clueless safest short on the market
Opening over 65 as it is in post market should setup for a run !
"Starbucks stock is up on ""news of massive protests and boycotts"""

"$SBUX canceled the deal with $SQ. They have no terminals and their payment system looks like in 1980 s lol Moreover, their baristas do not get instantaneous Tips at the point of sale."

"Why the sharp jump up just after hours? If it jumped up during business hours , I could believe it was due to store openings news.But it is happening just after the close. This is something dishonest."
I bet they start limiting your internet connection to 1 hr soon. Sad thing is I don't want there people migrating to other stores with better coffee.
"Happy MLK Day. All Black coffee 1/2 price,"
pump and pump though customer is not there and guaranteed next 3 months customers will be less. But who cares just pump the stock price
"Starbutts, Starsucks, etc... Why are they even bringing these into play? They had a good thing going & somehow managed to fumble the ball going over the goal line. Cleanliness matters. At least I think it does. Maybe that'll be proven wrong. Maybe people are so addicted to the juice that it won't pull them out of line if someone winds up taking a dump in the corner. And if someone does start to take a dump in the corner, how does the Starbucks staff respond?? If they call the police, they'll be blasted for insensitivity. If they don't call the police, they'll have lost all control. So they are in a tough spot right now by trying to please everyone. Maybe they should follow the gas station routine wher they chain the key to a tire rim & you have to ask the cashier for it."
Is the loyalty to the Company or the high caffeine ?
"I understand that $EXAS will enter into a joint venture with $SBUX where testers can come in, get a cup of swill, and dump in a bag so it can be tested. Coffee that is  followed by a  in a bag. Synergy."

"Hated the political pontificating by the former Starbucks CEO who inappropriately used this publicly owned company as his personal soapbox to promote his own virtue signaling and so, I never invested my money in the company. Now that the loser is gone and the tank of the PPS (due to the pandemic) presented an opportunity, I was reminded of the comment the Roman emperor Vespasian once made to his son, Titus (who complained that he was making money off of taxing urine): ""The Smell of Money is Always Sweet"". And so, I bought several thousand shares in the $68 range last March. Still brew my own coffee for but more than happy to profit from others who believe they are promoting social justice by drinking Starbucks brews."
"Listen I wouldn’t hold this for a long especially when Starbucks announces that they pay for employees college, where do u think they will get the money to pay for colleges of the dum millennials? They will use some share money from investors and this will drop down soon.."
Awesome day
time to increase the dividend!
This stock will be in the 40s next week
man what a green run? mkt imbalance on sbux?
"If SBUX goes under $50.00 watch out below, mid 40's are in sight."
Getting ready to take a dump and get profits!
still got chance to buy.. closing 53.70
I have decided to short them....too much expensive right now. fair value around 60usd and potential upside within 12 months around 70usd. At 64usd dont see much space honestly and hope to make money shorting them (after i have lost lots of money cause i was long on apple). Never i have made 2 mistakes at same time !
What % of baristas at $SBUX are transgender?
Nitro cold brew is awesome

I'm sticking with this stock. management team has become more accountable and buttoned up. less senseless spending and more accountability from what I'm hearing. I'm long for now.
Ready to go
I have spent $150 less at Starbucks since comrade Schultz penned his maifesto Mein Kaffe.$1 for a large McDonald's is the way to goShorting here as same store sales will be down highly.
What happens to Starbuck latte and mocha can at Costco? they no longer carry the drink?
"no wonder same store sales are down, they still won't let people in the stores that I use.too liberal"
I think I should buy in tomorrow
"Price Earning Ratio of 23. Most Starbucks all over the world are closed. Presently, there is hope, less people get infected, because they stay at home. What will happen when the economy opens slowly up again? Dr. Fauci said until there is a vaccine, there is no back to normal, back to how life was before the virus. How can the recent increase from 50$ back up to today's 70$ be justified?"
SHORT IT HERE BUY IT CHEAPE LATER
"Just my opinion, but since Starbucks implemented the mobile rewards program, I've seen more and more customers use it and redeem rewards regularly while more people learn about it. Although Starbucks doesn't need much assistance to attract customers, the amount of daily consumers increased exponentially solely because of this app."
Pure speculation that SBUX will take market share from competitors and people will flock back in droves. 300 mil in cash helps but this is a $60 stock
Who is going to spend on a $6 coffee when they are in the food bank line? The analysts are living in their ivory towers thinks American will splurge for a small luxury. Are you kidding? People are reusing the tea bags.
Hows Sargent Schulz politics working out.
I have a feeling that SBUX stock holders are seeing the share price go through another period that we had during 2017- 2019 when it did nothing but go sideways. I doubt we will see $80 for a year or more if then.
"Oh Howard when people have to wait longer in the drive thru thats not good for climate change, and you just made a lot more people choose drive thru."
"Oh boy, this has alot to fall..................."
starsucks creamer recommended this
SBUX is worldwide & in every major city / airport I travel through there are always people waiting in line to buy the coffee & other BS they are selling. I'm still buying the stock
How does a stock like SBUX trades 27 times forward earnings ? SBUX will come down to $45.00 VERY SOON
"SBUX will return and the only difference is , no dead beats hanging out for free. This is a business not a social club. They will come back like CMG"

SBUX my fav stock. While rest of the market is trying to figure out where it wants to go. SBUX just goes up up and up.
where is our dividend?? it thought it's 22nd?
Hey Kenneth Charles. What's the capital of Israel son?
Too high valuations
Sbux now taking it mall owners by not paying them and requiring reduced rent. Sent a letter to all mall owners to demand rent relief. That is class move right away. Must not be able to pay rent.
"used to be a loyal Starbucks customer. Read Howard's book, liked the company, but now I will take my business elsewhere. I called SBUX customer service and expressed my feelings. She was very polite, but seemed unconcerned. I have now found some new local coffee roasters as well as tons online to order from. Never would have found them if not Howard foray into politics haha. Finding new coffee gems and saving money, Thanks Howard ! :)"
The starbucks fiasco is an excellent case study.
heading towards 75
I think it will keep going down. Planet Fitness as a $15/$20 membership that they will get despite being closed unless people cancel membership. People have the option of not going at all to starbucks....
Starbucks and Target. Great 2021 winning combo starter pack
What a blood bath today!
Power hour just before earnings
Not a bad report considering the world has been shut down. Stores open up in May and sales will rocket up...
I used to own Starbucks for many years but I am afraid it won’t do anything; five years from now it will still be in the low 60s; a better company is McDonald’s because that stock will reach 200
So why are they doing a stock buy back? Because investors are fleeing. Every day it sells off and they desperately buy to push it higher. this is deceptive to a new buyer of a stock. All signs are pointing to a slide when they can no longer fool the public
Looking good people. Don't listen to the doomers! This stock is great investment.
KGKG IS  ITS DRINKS SALE ON AMAZON. NEXT REDBULL DRINKS
I regret selling calls at 77 now. Hopefully tomorrow is green but below 77. If not well I wish all bulls goodluck and if it goes down again I'll buy back in
To alienate about 40% of your customer base can't be good for business can it ?http://insider.foxnews.com/2016/09/08/trump-supporters-call-boycott-after-starbucks-ceo-endorses-hillary
"Starbucks is selling it’s brand. Over price coffee , yes . They use premium packaging. They make you feel appreciated and special. The atmosphere when you get in their stores is different that any other coffee shop. Even asking for water is given to you in a nice cup with ice , lit and a straw. This stock is class premium service. When buying a stock look more than numbers and charts."

So Starbucks discontinued the drink I order “Starbucks double shot on ice” to rename it “Iced Shaken Espresso”. The drink is now more expensive and they now charge for substitutions other than milk.

SBUX making a new all-time high on the day that their China competitor goes public sends a strong message that the institutions (that own the great majority of SBUX shares) are not at all worried about LK.
"Some people think that because their local Starbucks is busy the stock will keep going up. Wake up call people, the market doesn’t work that way. Apple is perfect example. Every apple store is packed all day every day. Stock is tanking. Starbucks overvalued and heading down. Sell to persevere capital and buy back in around 55"

"Best vote is with your $! Trump promised to vet immigrants better. Great Idea. Media slants and distorts what is happening. Starbucks feels strongly they need to support convoluted lies of liberals. Feels immigrants need priority for jobs over Americans. This is there right to do so. I voted my opinion today buy avoiding my daily latte from Starbucks.Let the marketplace decide if the business world needs to support the bent, twisted, lying, distorted propaganda that the media is passing off as news. This is not and never was a ban on a religion. Carter and Obama restricted people from these countries for periods longer than this proposal and in their time they were right to do so! Trump is acting legally and intelligently. Starbucks? Well probably not so much!"

Sbux knew how much employees would get on unemployment because they were on govt task force. They knew it was more than they made sbux and was afraid of losing them. So they paid them as a greed move. Sbux great move.
Most of the bums in there are on their phones. Some play loud music while others are trying to read articles on line. I have seen bums in there fall asleep with their head up. I go in there. I slum. I have a gold card too.
I have never seen such negative comments on a board. I agree totally. I do hope he runs for president to waist his money and muddle the socislist democrat field.
"Speculation is that Shultz will run for president. If that were true, SBUX will go to $30 or less in no time. That's basically telling half of your customers (conservatives) to go somewhere for the coffee. No Trump supporter (like half of country) would ever step into SBUX again.I'm not taking side. But if you were liberal, as a customer, would you avoid businesses that constantly tell you (1) No cradle-to-grave policy (2) Build the wall (3) Low Taxes to empower individuals + businesses (4) Tough, merit-based immigration policy"
"boycott time. I will never spend another dollar at SBUX as long as they tout BLM. In my city, the BLM riots have cause as much fear and more damage than any other hate group, that includes the white hate groups. BLM is no better than the white hate groups. For a few cents a cup, an no hassle, I can make my cup at home. saves time and money."

Gap up to $72 before the end of February! Upgrades eminent this morning!
"SBUX will use this crises to permanently close seating in thousands of locations that have hour by hour problems with bums, and nearly bums hanging out in there all day long. This will make Barista's very happy. SBUX will save big on operating costs too. Even when this virus is over, do you want to go in there and sit in the same room with bums, unemployed and fake employed that are high risk people ? I think not.What is ""fake"" employed? Somebody on their smart phone all day in there pretending they are working on something.SBUX should add drive-thru windows and build locations that are drive-thru only. I think in Santa Monica, they have a walk-up location too. Smart . Fleet"
Starbucks is down 8.49% to 72.31

"Using your company as your personal political platform is not only wrong, but it costs your investors and your employees. Poor earnings are a direct result of Shultz using SBUX, a company that he is only an employee of, as his personal political platform. Poor results are due to the fact that the company has been boycotted because of Shultz's personal political beliefs that he THRUST on the shareholders, the employees, and the customers. SBUX is a strong brand and will eventually return, but never to the company it was before Shultz used the company for his personal political gain."

Starbucks ALWAYS tanks on earnings. This dookie has been funding violence by shoveling money to ANTIFA and everyone knows it. China is going to crush stock this as US-Sino relations worsen. Hopefully the fascist rioters masquerading as peace loving millenials will burn down every store and humble this one world order seeking company. Get ready for the bottom to fall out.

I do think that the only thing bigger than Kenneth's portfolio is his imagination.This post will soon be erased due to its ability to cause pouting."

There are 30 people in line at the local TD Ameritrade office for a buying puts seminar. I asked a few why they were there--FYI they all had $DNKN coffee with them--and profiting from $SBUX demise was their sole purpose. Seems like America is awake !

"Stock prices are falling because nobody's buying but people are selling. Stop selling. Hold. It will rebound as the flu dries up. It may take another 2, maybe 3 months, but people get it and get over it within 3 weeks. P/E ratios are way low given where business will be in 6 months."
"translation? we cant seem to get more people in...so raising prices is our only hope....... “Transaction growth is our largest opportunity,” Operating Chief Rosalind Brewer said in an interview, adding that traffic improved at the end of the quarter thanks to new cold coffee drinks."
Some bums inside can actually sleep with their glazed over eyes wide open looking at their phone. I will stay with sitting in my car. We need curbside service on roller skates and chrome coin changer.
Could a Starbucks buyout of luckin be in the cards?

Thank your democrats for turning this country upside down
"Starbucks is iconic, they have a stock buy back program in place and are giving back to shareholders, back up the truck at these prices, or wait for a bounce. Closing the stores is good business management, its what every well run business does. Funny stuff though about the restroom issues, I guess I'm old fashioned in that if you visit a place of business just to use the bathroom, you might be a freeloader....."
"Schultz will soon see how Americans feel about his progressive, liberal, socialist, globalist, open borders, anti-American agenda. Not only will we be boycotting Starbucks, we're going to be selling our SBUX stock and drive this terrrorist-loving POS down to $20!"

"More downgrades coming. From 92 to 52.

Jimmy Roger's ETF the RJI. $5.86/share. 35 worldwide commodities from lumber to oil to wool.
stock is now down only 21c in the pre-market. I guess cooler heads have prevailed. Dividend increased 20%. Same store sales grew 8% when accounting for extra week last year. 36% of sales are from mobile. Stores are always packed.I don't care for the political leanings of the management. I wish they would just stay neutral like any sane adult would do.

Bizarre that this stock trades higher than pre-pandemic levels. P/e of 130 is disgusting.
i disagree that sbux will reach 40 to 20$ in four months technically its too big to fail i woudnt be suprised if it surges outta nowhere technically its expected.
 ALERT  I TOLD YOU @ $23 to short PCG. NOW @ $10.50Now I SAY GO LONG. JCP. 50% upside! SBUX still rocks but ya should have sold before duuuh.
"With the raging coronavirus, do you think people feel safe to go to Starbucks coffee shop to buy a cup of coffee or meet with friends and coworkers even if Starbucks stores are open? I would not feel safe to have my coffee prepared by some one else when there is a deadly virus spreading rapidly. I think for the short-term instant coffee manufacturers and the Keurig machine sales will shoot up as more people will switch to out of Starbucks."
china stores still closed

"Here's a thought: Illegals vs. Liberals ?I'd rather keep the illegals, they really are just wanting better lives for themselves, I see most of them working hard, saving the money and sending it home to feed their kids. This is dignity and they make daily sacrifice to make ends meet.Now look at liberals, bunch of free-loaders, know-betters, un-American spoiled brats that believe they are too good for blue-collar jobs. They are lazy, unaccomplished, in debt, gluing themselves to their phones 24/7. The LOOK-AT-ME, LOOK-AT-Me culture is sickening.I'm 36 years old, immigrant from Taiwan originally. I've lived in the States for the past 20 years. And I went to Berkeley... oh yeah, the hypocrisy I've seen, you wouldn't believe it. Oh believe me, if I had to pick one of them, I rather kick out the liberals and have the ""illegals"" here."

"Starbucks Corp. beat Wall Street expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter, but said it had lost more than $1 billion in sales because of the pandemic and called for slimmer profits in the next quarter.Starbucks SBUX, +1.29% said it earned $393 million, or 33 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $803 million, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter, “primarily due to unfavorable impacts related to the COVID-19 outbreak” that chipped away at its profit at a clip of about 35 cents a share, it said.Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned 51 cents a share, compared with 70 cents a share a year ago. Sales fell 8% to $6.2 billion, the company said.Lost sales due to the pandemic totaled about $1.2 billion, mostly due to modified operations, reduced hours, reduced customer traffic and temporary store closures amid the pandemic, the company said. Same-store sales fell 9%. EGO is a 13 dollar gold miner and they earned .33 this q ... so SBUX IS WORTH ABOUT 15"

Are we going to do the Starbucks fade today?
LK more stores in China than SBUX and moving into India and Mideast with teas and coffees. Market cap will catch SBUX imo.
"Coffee at Starbucks is very good, if they improve their smoothie game they could definelty be a 300$ stock because of the added influence vegans would give the company. I hope they move into good smoothie making soon and this stock will soar to the moon."
"Shultz leaving is great news for this company. Always brought worldwide attention to any negative or mistake the firm made instead of simply addressing it internally as most worldwide companies would do. They still have a large following, innovation in electronic pay and growth in Asia. Hoping new mgt now has a clear path to make Starbucks great again! Might even dip in and buy more shares. Interested in others thoughts?"
I think its a bust
LK their biggest China competition was raided this wk! SBUX will be fine and higher in due time!
We are waiting for 67!
"Starbucks said 90% of its stores in China are now open, and the board added as many as 40 million additional shares to the coffee chain's buyback plan. The company also plans to open a coffee-innovation park in China."
Why the little Post earnings AH Activity a lot the things they mentioned on the call was expected
imo expect a sell-off after earnings then buy. Thoughts ?
Been a shareholder a long time. Also a Gold Member. Now the new rewards program is horrible and the opposite to what the airlines and auto rental companies do. Dumping the Gold Members. Just sold my shares from my IRA and will continue until April 16th then bye bye Starucks.
Earning out yet?
keep holding with summer coming it will sky rocket. lol
"I went in yesterday, took a dump and left. No effort by $SBUX to sell me anything. Shocked."
"Funny how Starbucks claims to be socially responsible but serves the least healthy ""coffee"" anywhere. Where is Michelle Obama and her healthy alternatives? [sarc]"
Like I have said in the past great company to work for but lousy company for investors; wait for low 40s
Nice Run................Go SBUX..........:):):)
Buy Puts. This millennial breeding ground is going to take a haircut.
It seems like good times are over for this company.. it is sad tho - I like starbucks drinks. How will I drink them anymore if they file BK.. Hopefully doesn’t happen
This Johnson guy reminds me of the previous CEO at McDonalds. That guy was a carrier employeeHe lasted about 1 year before Easterbrook was hired as CEO
"SBUX just broke below it's 3 year coil pattern on heavy volume. So stock is a sell here IMO. If it gets as cheap as 10 times earnings, I would be a buyer of shares."
Made lots of $ from DUNKIN. Glad I didn't listen to joey.
"Just sold my SBUX shares. I have held for a long time, I bought in at $27. Wish I didn’t have to sell but needed the cash to help cover a huge loss elsewhere. I will rebuy again...hopefully"
Sitting in that 55/77.5 iron condor :)
Luckin Coffee IPO will sink SBUX share price in my opinion. People will diversify. So they sell SBUX and buy the IPO. And there are few new people who will enter this sector. This is not other tech company.
Can’t say Cramer pumps this stock for his trust every chance he gets and the communists censor u
$DNKN up while $SBUX is down. Getting monotonous.
"Just think longs...it could be worse, you could own TSLA too..."
when is dividend ?
"Liberal Schulz hiring 10,000 muslims which some may have killed American solders is a very good reason never to buy a cup of coffee from this loser"
People please look at the chart and china and USA are both about to join forces super new highs coming
"Happy Day of Rage Miss Kenema Manson. Will you be waging message board jihad today? Be sure and wear your over sized motorcycle jacket if you do. It won't make you more intimidating to others, but it might make you forget about your under sized thingy thingy."
"I hear they will be starting a program called star-bucks. When you make a free account with the app they will give you 20 star-bucks each month, which are the same as US dollars, except you can only spend them at a starbucks store that month. Its possible some of the people who spend that free money will spend a few extra real dollars if they run out and happen to be hungry or something. This program could double the stock price by 2022."
"David , You Are Right Again , Sale's At Starbuck;s , Re Opening's Are Going Great With Record Sale's , And Now Their Profit's Are Going To Be Huge , And In A Few Week's , Their Stock Price's Will Be In The $90. Dollar Price , Thank's David ,"
"I'm thinking about buying before earnings...question for longs: does warmer weather months generally effect starbuck's sales? I'm asking a question, as I've never owned."
Frightened perv hides in underground shelter while insulting everybody makes perv feel normal!!!
Ceo selling 98. Not a good sign
Time to buy bouncing back tomorrow
Wait until all the sell recommendations start coming out
If Starbucks signs
48.85.....if that breaks low 40ties...SBUX will survive
"$GE may be setting up a new floor. Then the slow, painful slog back. But, obviously, it's not unusual for public companies. I've had Starbucks ($SBUX) for a while. It dropped like a rock a few months ago because they closed more stores (than usual), the CEO retired (even though right-wing investors seemed to think he was evil), the CFO quit, lowered earnings expectations, China, and -- umm -- bathrooms and who gets to use them. $SBUX bashing looked very much the same as GE bashing here. They're back to trading above pre-drop prices less than three months later. So, it happens. GE just took what may be an undeserved hit the last two days. Maybe it was deserved -- at least they should have been in front of the news instead of issuing comments via LinkedIn -- Seriously, who does that? JMHO. But basically, ignore the bashers. They don't care about your well-being. If you want in or out, do your due diligence and commit to the choice, whichever it is and don't look back. But here's the thing, no matter what the analysts say and no matter what they write and no matter whether they're bullish or bearish, somewhere in every bit they issue there's language that should be read as: ""I dunno, I could be wrong."""
CEOs shouldn't take sides in a divided country. Interested to see the next ER.
70 today
Why does this guy keep gaining and then rejects the same gains
"Bought at 50.95, let's see where this goes from there..."
"(For beginners) Long-term outlook for SBUX stock. Technical analysis...See it on YouTube. Search for the title ""SBUX stock Starbucks Coffee 2020 02 05"""
Don't drink their coffee and think they are nothing but a trend till someone outdoes them and they will be forgotten history. Conservatives CERTAINLY won't miss them....
.56 with an extra week in the Q ?
MROLELAND PLAYED HIS FINAL TUNE ON HIS HORN AND IT WAS ALL KORN
So im just wondering what is drving down the stock price for sbux and other related industries
SBUX is to buy MACD daily to buy yes $$$$
maybe XOM should go into the coffee business ?they already have plenty of stores ...since you can buy 2 gals of gasoline for the price of a latti just think what has to happen to make gasoline compared to coffee I make a lot of coffee but will never be able to make gasoline
Oh Kenneth Boy. I know you're out there. I saw your little pointy head rise up to pluck a cucumber just a couple of days ago. Where are you little man? Stop hiding from your hiding little fella.
I don’t know the bottom I got in at $56 I still believe people are addicted to their coffee so I will continue to buy the downward sliding scale util the rebound and hold for 20% profit.
Wonder if Howie supports Kuerig and their socialist views? I will go to Dunkin.
Waiting for the earnings call... Hang in there one more month!
"Joe and Joey123, Grant... = Pumpers This is why people lose money in the market. They get bad info from pumpers"
"The growth is gone and stores are closing, move on to something else"
"It is ridiculous... but there are still a lot of people lining up for starbucks. I dont get them or why, but good for Starbucks."
earnings beat things are moving right direction plus will likely get tax break as a restaurant from stimulus should be above 80 very soon
Just a little curious. what's with the long drabby texters? Maybe a good cup of coffee might help.
80 soon
"Pump it up before earnings, LOL ."
If it makes you feel better $MCD and $DNKN are down too so not worried about $SBUX
73 close
It makes no difference anymore. It's all funny money printed endlessly by the Fed. Up up and away.
I contacted Sonic yesterday to initiate negotiations with Starbucks. There should be a pilot in some County somewhere. Probably a Calif. County. I think SoCal.
"a stock is grossly manipulated when it moves up three times the annual earnings in one dayand it seems to have about a 3.5% return, but that is ""adjusted"" how about the real earnings?"
"sbux earnings report very good, sbux can reach$150 per share,it's very good chance to buy now, coronavirus is temporary, sbux sales have more room to growth, don't worry,"
"One day I felt the need to take a dump and I pulled into a $SBUX since they have free bathrooms. The place smelled terrible and lots of yuppies in there getting financially sodomized for their coffee. Sad,"
"I picked up some SBUX today. I figured that since I like going there, may as well own some of their stock too! Good luck all!"
Great company
Shorting hard Monday morning. SBUX.POS
"So, What Happened?"
"Maybe next quarter, Kenema......https://finance.yahoo.com/news/td-bank-group-declares-dividends-113100654.html"
Earnings after the bell??
This is looking to be a pretty good buy right now
SBUX now the must have job. Why? Customer by walk up and drive thru windows only. This will be permanent. Full employment at SBUX.
If you can't run a kool aid stand what makes you think you can run a country?
I feel like this has been around $75 for the last eighty years.  money to be made elsewhere
"Hey, what happened to Kenema's post about all of his inflatable toys, Long Leroy Big Al and the like? Where'd that go? Did the Menneth realize that it actually left in a bad light and he voluntarily deleted it? Is that what happened? LOLDon't worry Docta Dums, you're still my favorite ex senior law enforcement, geriatric Illiterate DumDum of time, idle threat, idiocies, inanities and all."
"Sales figures not in yet, and people only slowly going back to work. With such a creaky economy a lot of people in China are not going to go spend $5 on a latte when they could get something cheaper at Luckin.."
The reason SBUX's PE is so high is that EBITDA is dramatically compressed due to so many of their stores being closed. Will it cease to be expensive once all their stores are back open probably not but as the dominant player in their industry this stock more than deserves a premium valuation. But the P/E and debt ratios will dramatically decrease once EBITDA fully comes back online with the reopening of all their stores. This company is not going to implode due to valuation...it has nearly a 50 percent earnings growth rate over the next 5 years. So it's not a bubble. The price will only go higher over time with economic reopening.
Wow this is a overvalued stock. Can I borrow your shares?
"People, Ackman doesn't throw $900 million into a stock for no reason. It's one of my 'forever' stocks since 1994. Splits and dividends all the way to the bank. I'll be hosting a shareholder appreciation day this month at one of the Santa Cruz County locations. [_] cheers [_]"

Wow seven sessions this has traded down why! SBUX is never a sell
This coffee is lousy. Gas station coffee much better then starshits sugar water.
All the bums in the world will sit in at Starbucks to down load 24hrs worth of YouTube videos in 2hrs without paying for a single cup of coffee. And they will take a sink shower in the bathroom too.
$85 Yet?
I hate SBUX because I have to wait in line forever to get a freaking 4 dollar cup of 50 cent coffee. I am done with them.
I love the open door policy for Starbuck's bathrooms because now the junkies have a safe space to shoot up their dope.
What a POS. Any questions?
$100 in 2021. Easy! everyone goes to starbs...
Just bought shares in BCCI a coffee company supposedly advertising a cannibus infused coffee at the Super Bowl.
"l drunk SBUX coffee every day now, l saw it's business very good, l don't think trading war hurt SBUX, because China coffee almost all coffee import, China doesn't plant coffee trees, SO China coffee import tax will lower more than rise in future."
I feel like the P/E is a little to high for $SBUX... Anyone else feel the same way??
"Joe Terranova sold SBUX a few months ago, bought Dunkin and sold it recently to buy SBUX again because they are recovering quicker on the international front. Always do your own DD, these ""analysts"" are not the experts."
I think the call will change it around..Strong Guidance
Okay what happened since last week? Keep raising from $77 . sector rotation ?
Guys! What Happened To All The Dunkin Donut Pumpers ???:(:(
"Splurged for the office today, bought everyone a Filet o Fish with extra tartar sauce, fries and a strawberry custard pie. We sent someone to Starbucks to get coffee but the line for the bathroom was around the block so we got $MCD coffee too. Smooth but strong, I liked it. Won’t go back to $SBUX it’s trying to be a sanctuary city."
At least 75 millions Americans won't buy their coffee. That why domestic sales won't improve.
looking for a big move tonight!!

Starbucks is opening a new location in China at the rate of one daily. Are crowd sizes in these new locations similar to US? Success in China could power the share price in years ahead.
Michael Scott of Dunder Mifflin will lead today's diversity/racial bias seminar. Employees will be asked to name a member of another race that they would like to sleep with.
I really like this company￼ I haven’t invest money yet because I believe￼ is too high right now I will buy around 60 bucks￼.
SBUX closed near the high of the day yesterday. Very bullish sign!
Really good ER.. spike tomorrow morning.
How ironicStarbucks closing stores in Blue states and opening more in Trump red statesLiberal environment apparently not profitable Boycott!
"VIRUS GOING TO GET ALOTLOT WORST MORE DEATH COMING JUST OUT 5 MINUTE AGO WHO WORLD HEALTH ORGANZATUIN JUST DECLARED WORLD WIDE EMERGENCY ON CORNAVIRUS ,REPORT WERE IN DANGEROUS TIME NOW"
Like I said a couple of days ago. SBUX is a less valuable company today than it was 4 years ago when it was at around $50.
Are they closing shop in Asia and in Italy comingthis week?
Starbucks new tiered rewards program will bring in more customers and repeat customers
"Perfect timing for him to have an excuse to leave the co after the policy enacted to ensure the reduction of patrons, paying ones, and render the stores a gathering place for those other than buying its products. It’s earnings and revenues will start dropping quarter to quarter from now and he will claim no responsibility. In fact he can even claim how great he was and things falling apart upon his departure. This can even be a point to use for his White House run.Fat chance for his political ambition, I’ll say."
"It is reflective of the extreme right today; in that, coffee has now become a beacon of politics. If we extrapolate, then liberals would have never bought gasoline and Ford automobiles (i.e. John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford were staunch Republican). Let's get serious and talk about economics rather than some pedagogical nonsense when it comes to SBUX."

"Trump supporters are mostly low incomers in rural areas. I don't think this boycott makes any sense to me, since I don't think they can afford starbucks coffee. But the price for me so far is still too high with 30 pe. I will wait for 23-25 pe which is a reasonable price."
Roger NOT Gary Sorry
Will Starbucks deliver here too?
Just put in an order for the $75 calls for April 18. This is my first option trade :) wish me luck. Good luck to yous

BUY NOW on the Cheap!! going no Lower
All the naysayers have been totally wrong...Fess up....
Went to my local SBUX last night. I have never seen the parking lot so busy.
Will $SBUX survive without Democrat supported subsidies?
Picking up more when it drops to 50
"I never thought I would have to sell SBUX, but my sell order executed this morning. I am out at $49.00 with a small profit.The CFO picked a good time to retire."
Cramer added more share today.
"Time to play ""catch the falling knife""."
I bet earnings are going to be real bad

Why does it go up 6% after hour?
should I buy Starbucks even if is at $60 im new at this and I need opinions? thanks
Dividend date 18 Feb 
Great stock but overvalued above $80.00. Wait for the drop.
I wonder if the liberals will keep their tax cut bonuses or give them back since Trump isn't their president.
Strong Buy after dividend
"all people knew SBUX coffee is best coffee, SO there are lot of investors want buy SBUX, SBUX sales will pass MCD in 2018, buy SBUX are better than buy any stock NOW, SBUX coffee sales could continue growth in recession of American and in third world, that means human very love it's taste, third world people too poor, but they drink SBUX coffee, that's incredible."
StarBucks will be closing thousands of stores in the US. The double drive through no bathroom business model used by Dutch Bros and soon to be other regional startups will make this happen. StarBucks will do fine in Airports and downtown areas of large cities......but all of their freestanding suburban stores need to pivot to the Dutch Bros model......or close down.
This is some of the least savy and childish analysis on any Yahoo stock chat board. Absurd politcal commentary on this board. Who on this board has serious fundamental or technical analysis to offer?
Nice drop.
"Who's buying at the top of the top?Oh yeah I forgot, buy high sell low"
"Howard Schultz still has political ambitions, and is implementing a diversity and inclusion program at SBUX to further those personal goals."

"My daughter had one around the corner from her place in Dublin, Ireland. I went several times when I visited her. She said she goes there all the time and it's always busy, but efficient. I thought the place was clean, never saw anyone taking advantage of anything. Staff was professional. Drinks were good. Customers were polite and in and out. The ones I go to in my town are the same way. Maybe it's the ones I go to, but they look well run, clean and busy. I think this whole thing is way overblown. They are a trip destination to millions still. Don't see that changing long term."
"Schultz called out Sanders for being too far left? that is the problem right there for Starbucks under Schultz' leadership, he is blind and clueless. He doesn't even know his mental own scale is pressed so far to the left there isn't any more room left...and yet he calls out Sanders? lol.. priceless."
I would feel a lot more comfortable if SBUX would install the advanced security devices from AiTX.
"Stock’s been testing the bottom the last week on what amounts to no significant news. I think we’ll likely see a bounce up from here. Just think, they’re winning in digital ordering and this quarter they’re riding pumpkin spice in both hot and now cold versions."
"I like Starbucks, but honestly, how is this stock near all time high?"
Starbucks is going higher. Glad I held during the downturn. Only up from here.
"Seems Starbucks senior management has to decide if they are in the coffee business or the public restroom business. I don't think the latter is very profitable, let us know."
beautiful 90 coming soon
Starbucks will never see 90’s again huge drop
sippy cup should bring it to 55.00 ... competition is coming but that's normal with the profit in a coffee. It will take years for the newcomers to build up and they might just fail.

That is now at an end based on what was left of authorization at end of June. (note the volume today).

This will be a sale!! Hopefully I can triple my position in low 80’s. Report is fantastic. Virus is short lived and this will take off.
sold my stocks. companies should learn from this. i am tired of them taking polictical sides. just shut up and run your business.
"There are a lot of turkeys here,although I suspect $SBUX won’t sell me anything if I use the lira as currency."

SBUX willstabalize over the next few days and then move to the $52-53 level. That was a floor and now will be resistance.
"california locking down again , I guess they will leave SBUX open"
Boycott this Liberal backed stock and ADVERTISERS.
Will Starbucks ban ‘black’ coffee?
Was an every-day customer but haven't set foot in there since they came out with their big political agenda. Shorted the stock too. Cant believe the arrogance and stupidity of management.

"It Look's Like , Next Stop , $85.00 , We Our On Our Way ;"
when this trades under 50 with a 3% forward dividend yield and only paying out 38% of income as dividends says it's priced to fail.
Every Starbucks drive- through has a line of cars. There's a reason why! Buy up...
It looks like $120 on its way
Do earnings come out before the market open or after closing tomorrow?
starsuks has no Christmas spirit just $. Evil company.

"SBUX IMO needs less Politics and stick to the Product. The wealthy don't care about differences and if you want to make $ , so should you. if you want to be a better person, choose to be.BUT DON'T BE A FOOL JUDGING PEOPLE BASED ON COFFEE. LOL."
If it gets to $90 a share and you have a ton of shares (over 100) you could trim but I certainly would not sell off all of your shares. ￼
"Can't worry about this too much. Overall market is taking a beating and the shorts are trying to push it down before their options expire tomorrow. Once they shake out, we're back on upwards. Stick with fundamentally strong companies and you'll make in the long run. SBUX all the way!"
Corona virus issue is just a pin in a bucket..look at the earnings and how they are expanding which is much big of a value.. I can see Starbucks everywhere now and people are liking it...open our eyes and look for what really is happening..
best time to buy Starbucks you won't see it this cheap it's going to be in the $90 soon
upgrades tomorrow mostly from 53 to 59-61 range....but stock trades at 64...what do u think will happen? I smell 62.50 by end of day. The numbers dont justify more.
I have 800 share and selling.
We've been moving up higher on such light volume. That is really concerning. I'm guessing that any type of sell-off will move this down quick. Thoughts?
What? No chatter over the police being asked to leave or move out of the line of sight of a Bux customer in AZ? Any assumptions on how or if this incident will affect Bux bottom line?
i like the way they tell everyone's the sale is drop hard. better than lie to ER day.
"MCD coffee and DNKN coffee are unhealthy coffee, after l drunk them, my stomach feeling uncomfortable, I went bathroom too times, l CAN'T sleeping,"
Great rebound today - all things considered. Next week will be green again. Enjoy your weekend drinking coffee.
$80 next week
$SBUX is down while $DNKN is up. I sense a pattern
"New flagship store, liquor licenses at select locations... Closing in on the 52 week high. Stock up 27.75% in the past year. I do recall a certain illiterate DumDum calling for the demise of Starbucks. There's that ""superiority"" shining on through yet again (much like calling the bottom in C, selling TD for a loss, calling for dividend cuts, buying LEH just before BK, stagnant dollars in ICE, bizarre options strategies that make no sense).I could go on, but I'll let his multiple posts speak for themselves. Kenneth is my best ammunition."
Waiting for cannabis infused lattes....I'll be in Starbucks everyday.

Why is Starbucks added to robinhood restriction list? You can only own 1 share!
"LOAOAOFF SBUX IS CLOSED FOR OH,OH, THAY UT ALL TOGETHER, DIVERWITY TWAINING. OH OH THO WONDERFUL"
I just visited a Starbucks and all I saw is college students and lonely people self absorbed on their smartphones . It was very lonely and sad the state of affairs of our country. Nobody looked at each other
Strong buy at 45; it takes a few weeks for all the selling to stop
performing better than the market second day in a row
Woo hoo we are getting some love today
SBUX will be trading at $90 within 3 months. Buy and hold.
"Earnings season in the fall is tough for retailers and there are very few companies with the ability to crush earnings this season like SBUX can. Digital ordering is working. With the stock been down 15% off it’s high with low volume, I think time to make some money next week."
"""SELL THE NEWS!"" Who wants delivery coffee delivery anyways? I like mine FRESH and HOT. Look at these futures, nowhere to run to now!"
This is going to 94 today
Very bad news for Starbucks today
"tax cut, income tax return more than last year, it will boost SBUX sales strong growth,"
Raising prices to pay for the franchise they gave the two mutts from Philly.
"I went short on these fools this morning. Their earnings report late July will be terrible and this stock will tank 30% between now and then it will be beaten down further with weak earnings. Wait until customers get a peek at their restrooms, which will be visited by every homeless person within a 2 mile radius any store. I can't speak for anyone else, but if I am in an eatery/coffee shop/anyhwere and they have trashed bathrooms I leave."
Boycott Starbucks!!!!
"Macy's just opened a Starbucks in their women's department in the Westfield Mall in Palm Desert. If all Macy's (and other anchor stores) open these little cafes, many men will not bark at going shopping with their women. They get to sit and enjoy coffee and not be bored waiting. Great idea. Looking to get in at under this pop."
"Closing stores and people staying home, but yet this stock go's up?"
Sorry but the new rewards program is huge negative for this stock! Check out Twitter and Facebook
"This is a big day, literally, for coffee lovers, as the world’s largest Starbucks opens its doors."
Visited Starbucks roastery in Seattle a couple days ago. Awesome place. Very impressive.
**ALERT***Starbucks seems to be on verge of a big selloff as 200 day moving average is breached this could cause automatic program selling !This is because fewer people are going to shopping areas where many starbucks are located and because the ceo has taken a stand against republicans did not help !not my words read understand and accept the next thing you will hear is cramer bashint it after he gets out maybe before earnings imo...https://www.thestreet.com/story/13841699/1/is-starbucks-breaking-down-here-s-how-to-trade-it-now.html
So when would they likey pre-announce a miss? All they did was say they weren't raising guidance for the year and that was almost a month ago since they closed 2000+ locations in China.
"you telling me this piece of  stock which nobody even heard of few months ago is worth more than $wm, $bac, $sbux? GTFOH...This is grade A pump and dump scam..."
This is dragging my portfolio down. More pain coming. Should have sold.
Hell with Cali ! they say everything is bad ! I will have a Venti coffee without an extra shot of fear mongering
Red right after “awesome quarter” lolll
i should had hold sbux bought during crash at 75 sold at 90 :(
Hmm. First Lady Trump to focus on cyber bullying. Remember when you were a cyber bully Miss Menneth? Someone broke you of that at the Chatham Branch. Do you remember who that was?
"""Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius."" I said exactly this in 1993 when I bought $3000 worth. That holding is today worth $343,000, or 19.83%/year. Starbucks is following the path of McDonald's internationally, so look for this juggernaut to continue for at least the next 26 years."
Back in! We're going back up again!
Wow... Shareholders must think Maw literally counts the beans. He doesn't.
I told you guys this stock deserves the 40s
You guys chose Biden so enjoy your shutdown and higher taxes. that’s what you voted for so just wait for it. Gonna be fun 4 years
They lowered their earnings forecast because of the amount they are spending on technology. People should do their research before they sell. It's why the stock went from down 3.50 to down 1.50.
This stock has already priced in a global recovery as well as 20%+ growth for the company. This stock will crash below $100. No point in buying an established company that isn't a fast grower at this multiple.
"sbux stock did really good this year. also good increase yesterday, i think will go to 95 very soon, read all the articles and check all the financial data https://pressreleasereviews.com/starbucks-corporation-sbux/"
"Impressive relative stregnth in the first hour. This bear is thinking of taking his money and running. Bounced off of yesterdays high , but is holding up very well"
"Buy at 43 and 50, sell at 61."
