"So I'm trying to logically think what's going on. Back in mid-2016, GoPro stock was tanking because of long period of no new products and falling ER. Then in August, when a new GoPro Hero 5 rumor started popping out, the stock went to $13~14. Then in Semptember, when the new hero 5 and Karma were announced, the stock jumped to ~$17, but then settled back down to $14.Now we have new Hero 5 camera and Karma. Yes, Karma was recalled, but even before Karma release was clear, the stock was around $13~14. So, shouldn't the stock price be at around $13~14 now? Why is it below $10, especially when Hero 5 sale is pretty well? Does it mean this stock has lots of emotional investors? Seriously, the company looks a lot better than back in mid-2016, but the stock price is not higher."
Record recurring revenue subscriptions.......EPS estimates being upgraded......all the signs of a good year coming.....we might never see $6 again.
"This stock is killing my portfolio. This company just can't get the stock price to get a run. The stock expected to beat expectations and still goes down, what's up with that?"
What's happened?
"If you see opportunity for stock price appreciation because the company will be acquired at a premium then stay. Does anyone doubt their exceptional technology? Drones, self-driving cars, all critically require this stuff. Cameras are critical but nowadays seen as either value-add (like iPhone) or necessary to apply a firms niche market solutions such as with agricultural drones. Companies are buying secondary technologies, either using the production channel or via acquisition instead of investing resources and capital to build themselves. The Retail opportunity for GPRO is dying. If they can change their business model to one of channels sales or OEM they’ll be fine. Think outside of the box, people!! It’s all about the channel."
"Some people don't understand why it tanks today. Over the weekend, there were couple of Karma crash or Karma hands-on review videos popping up on Youtube. Karma has somehow been concluded by different people as a dumb drone that is easy to crash. Karma drone buyers are mostly new to drones and they will more likely to have crashes. There will more crash videos coming out on Youtube. It doesn't smell good right now."
"I sold all my share 1 week ago, thinking that gopro incresing is finished...but seeing what will happen with this company in the near future makes grasping that gopro is a good one... waiting for market to open and I'm in again. Let's go for $10 in next 4 months"
"GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO) is projected to post quarterly earnings at $0.79 per share on revenue of $569.85 million."

Where does the stock price go over the next few days RSI 24 so we’re oversold and the press release We think $4.75 or higher by end of week
VR market poised to really take off over the next few years. Let’s hope GoPro is a major player in this new field. It is theirs to lose.
Long another lot at 3.66. Dollar cost average this gift price.
30-million shares SHORT...soon to feelmega squeeze...
Climbing back to $90
"can't take it any more, i'm out. gonna take the few bucks i got left and invest it in apple. with my luck, apple will buy out gpro next year."
Just on time
"Looking at the volume after hours, remarkable. There is a ton of institutional blocks an what looks like regular investors. This stock has so much shorting on the anticipation of at poor earnings report on the 4th and they are going to have to cover their shorts. This will be quite possibly the same squeeze that happened to Gamestop. Same set up. Tomorrow will be wild. For those who are already in long, this will be your week!"
One of my post disappeared ????
"So where is Crabby-Paddy?? and his loser sidekick lwber?? Crabby would still be barking about how all this good news was ""smoke & mirror's"" and that realistically they can't agree with Nick and his UP-TICK projections for late 4th qtr & 1st qtr 2017. They should thank the Yahoo powers that-be for changing the board. They'd never get the chance to live-it-down back on the old board! Crabby? You here boy?? LOL!!!"
Just a suggestion: the market is wide open for an 8k resolution video camera.
"LOL, the wife is making money here."
"So I see all the class acts still remain here. To those holding the stock, congratulations on the 16% rise. I sold this and am currently long another stock.For those who do believe in charting, today was very significant. All signs prior to today showed oversold and today provided the first of 2 candlesticks. There is speculation here regarding institutional buying -- not necessarily. Average volume is about 4M shares. The public can easily spin 20% of the float -- and realize that for every share bought, another was sold. This could have provided an exit point as much as a good day up. The 2nd candlestick will be instrumental meaning you should look for continued volume (not like today, but higher than average) along with trending up. If the stock settles back to the mid 7s, that wouldn't be a good sign. Mid 8s is another plateau -- really moving into the 10s would be where you want to be next.I'd like to point out that this is being spun as another 270 jobs -- I'm not sure if that makes a total workforce cut of 17% or if this is additive for total cuts of over 30%. All I will say is either the company had a lot of people not doing much or this is reactionary. If the later, production and many other things will suffer. Any workforce losing 3/10 people can't continue at the same pace unless you're removing dead weight along with entire sectors of business. Also -- you eventually need to improve your business model -- you can't just keep cutting staff.With market reaction to SNAP, I don't believe GPRO is out of the woods yet. Even though the next call isn't until May, Woodman should have a good sense of numbers now given the quarter is wrapping up in 2 weeks. Hopefully the guidance provided is accurate.Good luck to those holding. If I am able to exit my other positions and GPRO is back in the 7s, I might jump back in for the ride through earnings -- but probably would not hold through the announcement given their history."
Bankruptcy ahead.
just a hardware company..
your 5$ call wont worth now. sell before its too late
Think once before you put sell order..some one is buying all the stock. Almost 15m who bought it for taking losses.
LOTS of SHORTS poised to COVER between $5.50 & $6++RATCHETING UP FAST!
"New 52-week low, Leka. Are you still buying? What happened to your floor at $5.50? LOLI told you this was headed to $4. I guess it is still EOY for you, rookie? GL!"
goshit 5 box
"5.73 after hours, what is happening?????"
The numbers weren't bad -- just not up to the expectations that GPRO's CEO created on Black Friday. The biggest issue is that the revenue line isn't growing year-to-year. It looks like the market for these cameras is about $1B/year -- and not growing...
GoPro Option Alert: Feb 7 $5 Puts at the Bid: 11977 @ $0.83 vs 7 OI; Earnings 2/5 After Close Ref=$4.45
"""Growth-oriented investors looking at GoPro’s financial performance since the IPO might want to review the company’s revenue trajectory. After peaking at $1.62 billion in 2015, revenue dropped to $1.16 billion in 2016, reached $1.17 billion in 2017, fell to $1.14 billion in 2018 and showed an uptick to $1.19 billion in 2019. The company remains unprofitable on a GAAP basis annually, although it told investors it hopes to be profitable on a non-GAAP basis for 2020."""
"this company has Retained earnings of nearly -$600M. this means when you add up all the money going in and out to date the company has lost over half a billion dollars! the growth rate for revenue and earnings is positive, but it is not high enough to keep the company afloat as they have had to take on debt to keep the lights on. the company is in a crowded market, with lots of profitable competitors, and the added $150M in debt plus interest is just the straw thats going to break it with such low RoI."
Craig used to respond to every comment. Where did he go?
This is a long term play with gambling money. It can either go belly up or $10 in the next couple years.
selling price would be atleast 9 it's a big opportunity for Google apple Amazon enter into professional camera business
Well just when I thought things were going good... goodbye to my money
According to multiple sources gpro is in talks with amazon to be bought out for 10 dollars a share. As reported by benzinga cannon could be interested as well.https://www.benzinga.com/media/cnbc/18/01/11002902/gopro-might-be-looking-to-sell-itself
"I'm hoping a big company like google or Apple will buy them and turn this company around, the brand name has lots of value"
What did gpro say about guidance going forward? What are they revenue estimates for the 2nd quarter and the year?
This jewel is on a mission to reach $100.00. I will help make the mission possible. BUY BUY BUY. THANK U JESUS.
the gap will be filled
"So, let me get this straight. Last year, GoPro had .22 EPS for Q4. This year, it’s more than 3x that. And they’re worried that the company “missed estimates.” Seriously?! They set it ridiculously high. Even the massive FAANG companies miss their own forecasts all the time. I honestly do not understand why people still pay attention to these analysts and their forecasts. I’ve done very well over the years by just ignoring their stupidity. You can’t set some ridiculous standards and then act all surprised if the company doesn’t meet it. Hell, even .66 EPS is reasonable, and that’s 200% higher than last year’s! No, the dimwits chose .70+ EPS. My mind is seriously blown. Let’s call these forecasts what they really are—mostly guesses. That’s how Tesla even beat the Q3 earnings estimate by over 900%! Do you people still believe these analyst clowns? You’re going to miss out on good companies or miss out on fundamental-driven stock rises. Just pay attention to the actual meaningful numbers and not “forecasts.”"
Happy Monday shorts!!And hi Craig 
"Craig: I can understand an occasional post with an opinion, but YOU'VE POSTED 28 POSTS over the past 24 hours. I call that an OBSESSION!!"
"Why is everyone talking about Carl Ichan, are you referring to the position he had in GoPro in 2015?"
No one likes this pos
I’m excited about the future for this company. The reason I say that is because of the ads I’ve been seeing around. GoPro is the name that people associate with action cameras. And they’ve been getting better for a while now. Hopefully the trend will continue.
I know most of you won't want to hear this... YES GoPro is a sinking ship but make no mistake. They will beat earnings and stock price will spike up one last time 9+ No doubt the company will be for sale and they need share value to increase to look attractive to a new buyer hence showing how sales this quarter were strong. So the lay offs and latest announcements is to adjust the balance sheet. So consider these levels a discount and load up. It sounds crazy but we'll see another bull run. $$$
dji osmo pocket will take 10 to 20% of gpro 7 black sales
Who said WSB is buying this up. Where’s the source
"Before you invest on gopro try buying karma hero 6 , this product is great the drone is easy to fly with great resolution and most of all the hero 6 is water proof,good price for the karma combo, this will attrack a new set of people not just for sport ,this will be the new norm for photography. This is the only drone that you can removed the camera. Its worth buying the stock now with price target of 14 and above."
When insiders sell I sell too. CEO sold shares on Feb 20th-
$1 soon
One last negative earning this quarter and will become a PROFITABLE company next year!!!
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 9.27
gonna buy me some more gpro
"""With this momentum and a continued focus on expense management, we're planning for growth and profitability in 2019,"" GoPro Chief Executive Officer Nicholas Woodman said in a statement."
"Holy shh folks, tsla is in space off to Mars, next rally is $gpro GoPro tomorrow on earnings day. Good to be in it for once."
"All the new bulls here are amusing. For over a year GPRO has done nothing, not even a dead cat bounce. Not a bull and I think the company has problems longer term. Woodman's got a lot of ground to cover to get his credibility back. That being said this could still be a nice short term rally. I think a solid close above $10 makes for an interesting next week."
book value is still higher than $8
"Well that bump did not last long, but at least now I can cut my losses."
Nice volume this morning something good is about to happen good luck longs and merry Christmas and happy Hanukkah to all.
From $2 dollars to $7 within 1 year. That's a volatile stock.
"""Nicky"" will get his new Hero 6 Black shaft in prison."
Buying
"How about a gopro that's detachable from a phone,, you could attach it on a small drone or maybe your hat or chest for filming"
"Has anyone seen the Gpro video's on Facebook? Check it out, They are outstanding. This is a great winner for Gpro. GOGO GPRO."
going back toward 4.28
"Guys, better to hold cash for better entry point, not necessarily on this stock... just wait and you will double"
Check this out..https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/10/05/gopro-shouldnt-fear-google-clips-camera.aspx
easy 4-5% up from here no way this goes down more then 17% on the day
56% shares sold short today. Still bullish pattern continues.
So when will Nick unload his shares at the bid? It happens every time the stock gains at all.
"I don't get this move at all. I ordered the Hero 8 on October 1st and when I did this it said it'd ship on the 15th, so how was this ever supposed to produce revenue in Q3?"
Up 20 bucks today. Feels good. That almost offsets the 3K I’m down thanks to Woodman.
Shares went lower on lower volume. just understand the bug guys want to play games with you retailers. I never was scared even when the price was at 2$. They can not buy my shares. sorry
Believe GPRO is bottoming TODAY ...and for strong/positiveFundamental & Technical reasons!!

"This is a GOPRO induced diversion designed by an ""APPLE DESIGNER"" to allow all those holding bags from $50 a sh down, to average down using all time lows as your chance to ride GOPRO UP back to $50. Suckers if you don't buy . Long and strong short suckers. Use it or lose it."
Earnings beat is coming tomorrow!
Most investors are underestimating the prospects of GoPro apps and this should be a buy for retail investors as more and more institutions are buying even price is going down . Did you relax and ask why ? The reason is simple the monetization is coming soon .
Not doing good for the New Year.
GoPro 5 at Costco....opening up channels to sell remaining inventory of the 5's.
"I see you all are having fun with Craig. You all know about the ignore feature right? I agree with the bulk of the posters here regarding the stock being overly depressed at the moment. Then again, most declines and rises overshoot, then correct. Also the constant pinging of the lawsuit will be winding down as we approach 1/17. That said, I believe we are experiencing price manipulation today. Nothing has changed for the sudden downgrade. Personally I think this was done to allow shorts to exit without the continued rise OR to allow some investors to get in a bit cheaper. JMHO. Good luck to everyone."
gopro never ceases to dissapoint.......
Analysts were all wrong
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/general/2015/03/10/why-we-wouldnt-short-gopro-stock.aspxThe article is an old article but think how much money shirts mucmst be loosing when you don’t sell your shares .
Did I say finish strong last Friday? actually I meant today.... :-)
Should I hold or sell before the apple event?
"What a surprise it is to see the ""Craigs"" hiding during this run-up."
"And I better not here MF changing there tune now, just because GPRO is announcing some relatively good news. MF can just keep their mouth shut."
I still feel this stock/ company has so much to to grow! they are set up for a take over...
What I couldn't believe is that gopro never designed an entry level dash cam to attract non-adventurers and then up-sell them down the Road. There are a lot more cars on the road than adventurers. But gopro was notorious for incompetent mgmt. Maybe if Nick didn't spend over 2 years interior decorating his yacht he might have concentrated on the core business?
@craig where did you go? LOL hopefully not Vegas. Nah...you need money to gamble. LOL
"Xiaomi protected their reputation when they said they would not overpay for GoPro. No doubt they came in with a low figure, it was rejected by Woodman, and they've decided to shop elsewhere. A nine percent drop as the trading day closes and double the average volume tells the tale."
I'm surprised it didn't tank harder today...
Basically when AmD was trading between 9-11$ last year I was in the chat room and after quarter result somenone said this stick is going to die and I asked that guy to bet with me it’s going to break out . It did and guess what who ever listen made huge profits . Once again we are about to see GoPro recover in 2019 .
GOBROKE NOW!!!
We will see $5.00 or more by Friday.
I remember when this IPO'ed it shot like a rocket to over $90.pps. Funny !
"GPRO finally caught up with FIT. The companies are not going anywhere but their stocks are DEAD. Unfortunately, they will never recover."
This pos has become day traders’ meowtch
SHORTS WILL PAY A BIG PRICE FOR THIS MARKET DROP
"If you can see through the fancy, extensive wordage within the Zack's article, you'll see that they're saying absolutely NOTHING - other than promoting their own ""service""."
beep beep beep beep (truck backing up)
Going back to 12 before earning if there isn't a buyout before that by snap let the short squeeze continue shorts are trapped.
"It is amazing to think that Apple once forced Steve Jobs out of leadership there, but the GoPro board has not yet done the same to Woodhead."
"Seasonal production requires support, hence, reduce the price to entice. Seemingly, management/insiders, pulling cash out could indicate tax extension due and/or personal holiday expenses. Black Friday will be turn"
RUNNING TO $13 AH $GPRO
They also sell drones now. Big market.
question: what's the best news source to track for early pre-market news?
"LEKA: RED, IT'S RED! STEP RIGHT UP AND GET YOUR KARMACOINS! ONLY $5.97!!! EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO AVERAGE DOWN (AGAIN)."
good luck
unpredictable stock!!!
40% of the GoPro Stock was short -- $350 million dollars worth -- they must buy back in -- my 3 million GoPro shares are listed FOR SALE -- I put my order in -- to SELL at $24 a share -- GoPro Stock - Buy Now
Buy while you can...good luck
good to see the move...
Whew! rough couple of days.
Strong volume
Imagine if the sell of wasn’t happening i probably would of breaking even rn
"SARWAR: Let me guess...it's currently down to $4.85 and you're going to crow how much more you're buying (after saying the same at $5.50 and higher). Well, at least you're averaging down...a lot!"

I just went long a small amount. Was waiting for the pullback before investing! Riding out to zero if I have too.
"To the GOPRO SHORTS......suck this.To the tiny GOPRO trolls (you know who you are), one word; IRRELEVANT.But then again , you knew this."
IF GPRO CAN'T MAKE so some corporation us should buy GoPro make drones compete with chine .that is good

"Guess what, average analysts price target for GoPro is $10.56"
Today actual share volume excluding options was 5.55 million shares and only 3.285 million sold short. We saw highly options trading . Don’t sell your stock and I would say to buy more as the stock goes down. While I don’t expect this to go too much down still it would help to accumulate more shares at lower prices
GoPro also increased cash to almost 200 million as o mentioned after the last quarter . Good luck shorts but you guys are going to get squeezed.
Just 8 trading days until positive earnings.Take a look what stockdid in April/May for less stellar 2nd quarter!
GoPro’s getting ready to erupt and sky rocket to $5 by Wednesday closing.... y’all better stock up now before it’s too late..... or be like Hilary in 2016 and be a loser for the rest of your life
I have a 686 credit score is that good for a 18 year old?
"Per their presentation at the Citi Global Technology Conference today, GoPro reconfirmed their expectation for continued growth and profitability for 2019 3rd & 4th Quarters and into the future. Over the last few few weeks large institutions have increased their holdings, while at the same time short interest has decreased. Anyone currently holding GoPro stock is a fool if they sell today at this current low stock price."
diamond
what news changed positive?
Let’s get and ONLYFANS line up of cameras and this will be to the moon!
"Interesting Tidbit - On December 23, GoPro posted a video on YouTube featuring the best footage of 2016. Bears and bulls will agree it's very well done. What's compelling (and I know Craig will pick up on that word) is that much of the footage was shot with their drone (although it's not listed in the credits while the camera is). At least for me, that sends the message the drone will be back in 2017 and will not be removed from inventory next year. For the record, that does not suggest quality nor sales, just a view into the company."
"I got a good feeling about GoPro especially with the release of their new subscription service which has over 800,000 users."
"Just bought 6000 shares Gpro I am convinced that this stock is going to fly after ER, there are too many shorts around. I am a contrarian investor and this is a growth stock, market leader with loads of innovation."
I love Nick W. This was one if my best shirts from $80's to $10.00. I predicted bankruptcy but I'm not that patient.
So this is tiny CraigAKA the GoPro Troll living large on a permanent vacation
any news?
"Well, stock isn't going up, but I'm taking a vacation soon so I will buy GoPro fusion anyways. Good product but bad management."
"I want to know now that the company is controlling their costs better, with a more price competitive product and better advertising, what will they do to evolve? How is the company going to broaden its portfolio and therefore broaden its target customers? There are huge markets out there that untapped such as vehicles, on body law enforcement, home security, integration with robotics, etc.... The company needs a real shot in the arm in the VISION department to have a a real turn around and not just live and die as an action cam company. They need to evolve and broaden."
This jewel is on the move upward Thank you jesus.
Bestbuy has new GoPro Karma displays up and it looks awsome. They are giving more anf best shelf space to GoPro. more then all other Drones combined.Both Mavic and Karma released on 23rd. Earnings in two. Very exciting. Jan calls are the call. I like the 15s.
"This stock was once 97.00. We know that would take a lot of growth and probably a buyout, but the 52wk high is 17.00 and that is very obtainable. I currently own a bio stock and considering buying GoPro. Anyone here buying at these levels?"
"GoPro up for sale based on his comments, will hit $7 over the next few days"
Look at the short interest!!! Massive!! Buy buy buy! YOLO!
I break even at 8.60 a share :/
Ok people reading posts gives me a headache. Sounds like the pump and dump family. By high and sell low right? Ever gone to a new restaurant that just opened? They do what is called a soft opening to work out the bugs. I have seen very few perfect anythings on open. That being said if you are invested in GoPro because you like the story and are not in it because you jumped for a big hit early and now are stuck a bit yeah. The rest of you please get out and move to the penny stock exchange where you can moan all day long with lots of friends.
all it needs is 3 market players with 5 million and they make a few hundred thousand $$$ on the squeeze if not a few million on a dollar + move
Today Gopro was shorted 69.06% of total volume. You bears need to reach that 6$ soon so I can buy more before q4 and guidance of q1 2018. Increase the volume to 99% please so we can see 6$.
this is just comedic lol
"HERO Session Holiday Bundle.Five days only.For five days only, buy a HERO Session and get a FREE handler,FREE 16GB SD Card and FREE GoPro Gift Bag. the offer end 28th november???? OMG , They are giving away accessories to attract the sale?????GPRO IS DOWN PEOPLE!!! CAREFUEL!"
People bowing out for the weekend. I expect a rise on Monday and then on.....
For sale!
Will the holiday spending push it up to $17?
"i could see a halt any day coming with offer one of 6 companies- AAPL,goog,fb,nike,garmin and jdi"
Making moves I see GoPro. I’m gonna have to join the ride/ team. Looks good from here on out
Why this went to 86 to 10 what happened?
should easily beat estimates... could only hope they managed inventory this time around...
That high volume dive this morning selling at the bid was probably Woodman himself after pumping it.
"I'm new to investing and I thought go pro was a good buy . Obviously I'm thick . I bought a lot of these shares and have lost a vast amount of money . Why do people sell when share price drops ? I really hope they go back up, I refuse to sell them until then ."
CONTENT. What is the valuation of the content captured by GoPro (it is a scratch I have had a while now) users over the years...it has a valuation for sure. I wonder what it is.
$6.00 today
all they want is the name. Gopro is still a household name.
I smell a buyout
#FireWoodman!
Nick woodman said on conference call with JP Morgan we have more to come on Stsbilization
"Leka at this rate, you can buy Nick's shares for under for 4 bucks."
WE COULD SEE MASSIVE SHORT SQUEEZE TODAY DUE TO GPRO HAVING HUGE SHORTS INTERESTED. Nothing is better than smelling shorts get burn in early morning hours.
Good move up today with allot of volume toward the end. We will see another positive day tomorrow. Wallstreet is starting to analyze the 4th quarter results and guidance and realizing the growth potential.
It will go below $7
GOPRO!!!!!! PFIZER!!!! BP!!!! my top 3 stocks :)
$100 EOY confirmed
4.50 by mid of Feb
Huge SHORT interest! Yolo! Absolutely massive WSB!
Looks like the SMA is in recovery mode? We could be around the corner...time to get back in.
"GoPro earnings beat expectations, breaking streak of holiday-quarter missteps"
I buy when I see blood.
"I was a sucker and held this for a couple years. Lost $20k. Fortunately I was able to buy FB cheap and made up most of the loss. I won't say good luck to longs, because this is just a terribly run company."
what is this late afternoon surge about? any rumors?
Wait till tomorrow! All UP
"Settlement Date Short Interest Avg Daily Share Volume Days To Cover1/12/2018 31,103,919 12,322,504 2.524156"
never short a dull tape
"The problem with Gopro stock: It goes down with the market and sometimes on its own.It comes back slow. As usual, short attack.Unfortunate that the market has not given Gopro its due even though the management is turning things around.Hope we get some BO talk like Twitter has been having for years. That way it will bring the stock up from time to time..."
http://www.alphafinews.com/earnings-review/make-a-hit-with-this-stock-gopro-inc-nasdaqgpro/
Hour of power! Time to cover shortie! You have been warned!
This one is going higher and higher
Pride is one of the deadly sins when it comes to investing. We have all made bad trades. Time to admit Gopro is not and never will be a good investment.
"Ouch, apparently Morgan Stanley is not impressed. $4 price target.https://m.benzinga.com/article/13122633?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&utm_source=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F"
Victor help me 
I know some who bought GoPro IPO and rode it into 70 and ARE multimillionaires from GOPRO. Haha SO WHAT?
go green
For those opting to take short-term gains on GPRO--as I predicted...an EXCELLENT short-termswitch is MIME...headed north--with 25-50% potential upside. Selling below $40...consensus: $55+!!
"I am guessing gopro have nice earnings to report next week, i have seen some huge premiums placed on August 21st, $6.5 calls"
"Gratz, longs. $131M in revs for the quarter and Woodman claiming Q4 is going to be amazing. Where have I heard that before?"
hope to see 4.10 today
"This company is ran by someone that majored in being a frat boy and minored in self-indulged profit taking. Somewhere down the line of his collegiate goals was business management but I think he flunked out. If Woodman gets evicted, the stock runs. Of course he's a multi-millionaire and I'm the backseat driver but his first priority needs to be the shareholders. Remember everyone... underpromise/over deliver. They are still the ""Heinz Ketchup"" up action cameras."
Why does yahoo ah show up nearly 10%? All these articles saying it tanked 12%? What’s correct?
"Today I'm posting for my friends mark and jbrad. I have my crayons and coloring book out and... seriously you both are complete tools unless you're the same person in which case you're a double tool.A couple of you may find this hard to believe, but the stock is really just spinning at this point. Going up on low volume to me isn't really significant, but I'll take the gains regardless. Volume has been below average. Building strength here. I made mention of this prior... selling in the last ER was about 30% the time before and the news wasn't that bad. Also, legal announcements should start up again within a couple weeks. All the various lawsuits will ""consolidate"" into one . Might mean a bit of money for all those holding pre-last earnings announcement. I don't think that will impact the stock price.So jbrad/mark -- let me have a peek into the crystal ball now and see what it tells me... yes... uh huh... oh, you both are... well you know. You've both posted your predictions and have been mostly wrong -- like last earnings call. So how about you shut your pieholes and do anything useful other than criticize -- or maybe get your prescriptions filled. It is possible to have a respectful disagreement, but clearly that isn't in your wheelhouse. And btw, about 3 weeks ago, I posted that I was getting into CSIQ and FEYE -- because the magical charts said so. Look at the price now. Charting works and if I need to explain that to you, then we have demonstrated your lack of knowledge regarding the market and stocks in general. So spare me your BS.Good luck to those holding."
"JBRAD AND NEY sure do stop chirping on days like today, with pps down over 4.25% Come on, you cheerleaders! Where are you? Oh right...you're just around on the days that it goes up a few pennies."
"Check this out, this thinks does not come in a day https://youtu.be/0r8fM-OVUfM"
"If the customers want to do is shoot aerial footage then yes MAVIC is the better drone. But, that's where the comparison stops. That's where the KARMA's detachable camera HERO takes over. The camera is a multi-purpose tool for those who wants/needs/must get the perfect shot they want in their video. Hiking, biking, scuba diving, snorkeling, sports activities, the ultimate action cam. So please stop with the comparison. The mavic is limited to aerial footage but the KARMA is more than a DRONE!!!"
They have a good opportunity to use Blockchain technology
What this stock needs more than anything in the world is a new CEO. Current CEO is toxic. Does Woodman have what it takes to learn from CMG?
Ahh should’ve waited 2 days before buying in
Invested at 17 is there any shot it reaches that number again?
Good results! Let’s see if this thing drives back to $14 - $15 in the next week or so!

Apple wants to get into virtual reality glasses I'm thinking they wanna buy GoPro
Thanks GoPro.... you never make my day!
Question now is whether the CEO is worth the $1 salary?
"Hedge funds boosts its stake and shipment starts earlier than anticipated. This is great news. The main ""sorrow"" was that the delay was caused by problems in the camera construction (i.e. heat problems). I guess we can ignore that now that the cameras are shipped earlier. By the way... where is J S today? LMAO"
Tough times.. who is optimistic for $10
Read the thread folks.Headed back and beyond 52 week highIN SHORT ORDER...
"Earnings will be as pre-announced: not goodBut, they will come up all the new products they are going to come out with in 2H, 2018...like Ring like security camera"
Let me guess. Same pump and dump news like FIT got.
I'm very conflicted right now on whether to sell or hold before the ER because of the last quarter drop even though I am confident that they will beat or break even with analysts predictions.
Why is Apple always a topic of discussion compared to GoPro? Read a news blog that Apple new iPod pro has new camera feature. I don’t think an iPod has nearly the same flexibility of a GoPro camera.
We eating good tonight!!
$6.50.... today.
"33 m out of 78 m short. Sweet!!!. At least 2 weeks to cove, if all shorts purchase!"
Karma is coming and you can be sure the whole world is going to know about it starting the 19th. We are going to see one of the best marketing campaigns ever moving towards Christmas. Who has most eye catching video content? GoPro period. who has the marketing dollars to make is happen? Go ahead and bet against them. The biggest competitor is nervous...See DJI Mavic new leak on foldable drone. DJI is going to get hip checked.
"Regarding sales and demand. George Kesarios from SA said it well.""Today GPRO put out a press release saying that camera unit sales during the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday period were up by 33% Y/Y.Not only that, but ""according to NPD Group, since the launch on October 2, HERO5 Black has been the best-selling Digital Imaging device in the United States.""Let me repeat that folks, Number one. Number one means it doesn't get any better than this. I do not know what that translates in revenue, however number one means your products are in demand. It means the market has the highest regards for your products, and it also means that you could barely keep product on the shelves.This is something I have suspected all along. It's one thing to have production issues, and it's another if you can't sell you products because no one wants them (AKA BlackBerry). In the case of GPRO, it was a production issue and not a demand issue.In fact I think the company's guidance last quarter was very conservative. Granted GPRO's next quarter will be without much (if any) Karma revenue, but people forget that this is a camera company, and not a drone company (yet).So while the Karma recall was a disappointment, the fact that camera sales are 33% up Y/Y, more than makes up for any lost Karma sales."

Why It's Time for Apple to Acquire GoProhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2019/11/14/why-its-time-for-apple-to-acquire-gopro.aspx
You are now seeing GoPro short squeeze begin Pm . Case study in Epic short squeeze disastersI told you cover
In the grand scheme of things what’s another 5% down in premarket...Heck overachieve and go for 10%...Might as well.
Over $6.00 in the first hour of trading today we will go up more than yesterday
"Why are so many of you acting like children? Bob, Mark, Mike, etc...I think it is GREAT that short term, so of you can maybe make back some of your losses. But you're acting as if this means GoPro is out of the hurricane, and that is not at all true. Did you read the ENTIRE article? It CLEARLY mentioned a ""near term reprieve"" and that ""The firm nonetheless reiterated its ""sector weight"" rating on the stock"". I hope some of your take some profit and can play with house money. Also, bear in mind, that analyst could be wrong, and maybe sales won't be what they are projecting. Several analysts have revised downward, so we will know soon enough. I am big enough to see two sides all the time and not play ""I told you so"" but it seems many of you are not. Gloat while you can, 2017 is going to make or break this company. I hope for the former.""We think action cameras remain saturated despite some near-term growth due to easier comparisons,"" the analysts said."
GET REAL...GPRO IS POS.Their DRONE is so many years BACKWARDS compared to DJI. I mean for real? why even make a drone then?This stock is worth like $11.50 range.
"I’m thinking swing to the upside for the next few quarters, people have more money today than they did in the past and GoPros are cheaper now! Their app is becoming more integrated with top social platforms, and the flow between GoPro and uploading to social media is becoming effortless. We will see a trend between GoPro and Facebook/Instagram in the future with user activity. The GoPro App and instagram will continue their partnership, and hopefully lead to a buyout."
"I actually think the recent move to collaborate with Jabil is smart and potentially significant one. if it works out, who knows what the next step is ... maybe someone becomes really interested in acquiring gpro."
Is this were GoPros stock changes the trend and stops following the decline of wearable devices stocks? Not even to sure why GoPro would be put in the same league as Fitbit anyway totally different company's selling doing totally different things
"also not factoring in sales estimates directly from gopro, and other retailers such as best buy, cabellas, etc q4 could be bigger than forecast. and of course fusion camera is tge wildcard for q1 2018. should see better days ahead"
momentum traders coming
Bought 1000 shares at 10.54
"I was waiting for this company to crack 600M market cap before I saw it as a takeover play. I don't see enough value to jump in right now. Anyone believing gopro will get over a billion is downright crazy. I believe the max they'll get is 800M hense why a 6% premium isn't enough for me to believe/risk they'll get bought. This will be a shining moment for Woodman if he can use one of his few skills, being a salesman, to squeeze out a few extra hundred million(s). But over a billion?!? Come on look at GoPros revenue and margin decline and tell me how you could possibly be that optimistic. Management failed in the direction of the company. New management doesn't change the declining interest in gopro cameras. The only thing for sale here is the gopro brand, everything else is worthless. Intellectual property? If it was worth anything then gopro wouldn't have lost money for 4 consecutive years. I saw gopro falling to 500M-600M and then being bought for 650M-850M."
Nick Woodman needs to remove himself from future CC calls after opening comments. He has a bad habit of talking too much.I like new CFO CJ. He provides more clarity and focus on the call. Please Nick step back.
Another SELLING Wave has Started !!! watch out

"hi guys, anyone seen Nicholas , his office claim he didnt show nor called for the last 10 days !!!!!!! would appreciate if someone can clarify and confirm"

Buyout news on friday
next gamestop?
Sounds like some of us are PANICKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gopro could/will be a youtube competitor! I believe that’s why they renamed the app so that in the near future gopro-app be re-released as a social media app... buckle up
"Leka, please explain why Go Pro is such a good investment based on their EARNINGS. I need a good laugh."
"GPRO will announce their new subscriber count towards it's projected $700k new subscribers by December 2020. if they beat that number, TO THE MOON 15%.in September 2020 they already had 500k new subscribers within 3 weeks after releasing HERO 9.Tomorrow's announcements will include that blowout report, IMO. take position."
Ok now the price is looking attractive. Someone on this thread made the observation that YouTube videos anticipating new Hero 8 are many. Good point. Numerous people reviewing and anticipating action camera that will allow for vlogging with coming mods. I just ordered the camera and now looking at. The stock. Reviews are pretty much all positive. Good luck Kong’s. Risk is GoPro screws up 10/15 ship date. Major positive is that Woodman brings in a seasoned CEO that realizes potential in this company.
COVER! COVER! COVER!
Chart looking like its turning bullish... nothing in its way until earnings.
Any update from today’s presentation?
GoPro will jump in 5 mints
Webbush up grades.
For sale....
buyout or merger soon. they are holding the news
Where is my man Craig when you need him heyyyy?!
CLASSIC SHORT SQUUEZE confirmed!
"Nicholas , u waiting your time and money , i told u before and telling u again , u will never see GPRO above $6 as long as u remain CEO with prefer shares , want to bet ??"
The squeeze will be big. Shorts be like...
"I have a good profit on gopro rn, should i keep the stock?"
"To all GPRO board members: Happy New Year. Truly. I know you love or hate me, which is fine and fun for all of us. That being said, free advice is worth what you pay for it, but let me give you one tip you should do your due diligence on: CytoDyn (CYDY). This stock is poised to explode in early 2020 and beyond. It is a biotech. If you read about it, you can make your own determination as to you what you think, but I will say that this company is going to change worldwide treatment for cancer, HIV, NASH and several other diseases. Check it out and join me...or don't. But have a great new year and good luck in 2020."
"If it will get close to $5 i think the buy will be good again, I may be wrong. Seems to too fast to hold at the moment. Any thoughts up or down??"
Within past two weeks frantic short covering alone took GPRO to nearly $6 PPS. Expect to bust through this week with UPBEAT2Q before and after the bellThursday.
$20.00 by year end. count on it. buy buy GPRO NOW.
"SARWAR: Were u smart enough to have an exit strategy and took profits where u could, or did u ride GPRO right back down again? I’m guessing the latter."
Most companies has lower forecasts while GoPro has positive forecasts still can’t rally it clearly shows the hatred of WS against GoPro but I would still hold and buy more shares . No worries I don’t care about small price movements .
"Just wondering why YAHOO After ours @ -$.10 ($5.30) for GoPro, and all other sites show +$.02 ($5.42). Hmmm."
"InMode is currently finalizing its financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2020.

Next up: Karma sales fail to meet expectations. Wall street hates Woodman even more than they do now.

Can anyone say:BUYBACK or BUYOUT?!

At the end of the day it's a camera you can attach to your head.Everyone's got a phone with super high tech cameras features these days.Opened up some short position here based on the run up last couple of days.Good luck to all.
"GPRO worth just 1B?Their business model is not good, but they are not going bankrupt (HEROs, Fusion, and Drones are good products).Institutional investors will notice 1B is to cheap or another company will buy them.1B is not sustainable. Just buy and hold."
"Hopefully FitBit isn't a sneak preview of our fate later today or tomorrow. That said, Nick and BOD -- high time you learn how to manage a company properly. Constantly missing deadlines, product delays, too little or too much product in the pipeline. GoPro is a name and product that everyone recognizes -- so the simple fact that you can't get this right is utterly ridiculous and a testament to your lack of ability. One word -- activist. Commit to what you can actually deliver -- or perhaps even deliver more than you committed to. A stock that goes from 100 down to 9 says a lot. Your job, at the end of the day, is to protect shareholder equity and you're doing an absolutely horrible job. I'm in at under 15. I'm sure there are many in MUCH higher. So either lead your company to success and put the ship in the right direction or step down. Activists are everywhere -- even Apple. So you are ripe for the picking and they love companies that have brand name recognition."
Buy buy buy. Good chance for sure it will go around 11$
Guys anyone that is invested in this stock has to be in for a long wait before making profit but I do think there will be a lot of profit
"The weakness in revenues was broad-based across geographies. The company witnessed a 35.9% decline in the Americas to $175.7 million, while Europe plummeted 46.7% to $89.6 million. Also, sales in the Asia-Pacific region contracted 29.5% to $69.5 million.In addition, adjusted gross margin came in at 24.8%, down significantly from 39.5% in the year-ago period, and below the expected range of 25-27%. Non-GAAP operating loss came in at $37.4 million, considerably down from operating income of $31.6 million generated in the comparable quarter last year.Further, camera units shipped tanked 40.4% year over year to 1.361 million."

Craig- are you for real??? It seems like you are on this site 24/7 with your negative remarks about GoPro.
"It's the current GoPro management that s holding the GoPro price-per-share down with its administrative ineptitude. There have been way too many avoidable mistakes and pratfalls by management over the past few years, to the point they're now being looked on as ""surf-clowns"" by would-be investors. The PRODUCT is GREAT. The management belongs in a circus."
GoPro will be in the $6 range by the end of January just prior to 4th quarter earnings report. This is a bargain below $5.

I’m thinking 10%+ tomorrow
does gopro make a camera that can record shareholders getting screwed.
"I'm happy to read many positive comments here. I have some GoPro shares and have been in the red for quite some time. I'm reluctant to let them go. It seems they have unique products and a loyal customer base, so I don't see them going away. Or maybe another company will buy them? I'd love to hear any thoughts. :-)"
"Just an educated guess, but I believe earnings is scheduled for 2/4, which coincides with ""well update in early Feb on Karma"". Thinking they will both happen on the same day."
great sign the motley fool idiots wrote an article about GoPro. anytime you see motley fool say something a little bad about a company you know it's a good time to hold on. I know there's a lot of people that been holding this stock and there's nothing wrong with taking a little piece of the pie. I do believe there is something bigger brewing GLTA!!
"HERO 8 media Mod is half price already. 39.99 down from 79.99. I was,told by customer service a couple of weeks ago that plus membership discount does not apply to those accessories and a few others, like multi battery charger, Max grip tripod etc. not sure why this bothers me. I’m beginning to think that GoPro will miss on 11/7 due to already known sales lost from production delays and the cost of moving production from China to Mexico. I can’t find any news or previous write offs of the June move. Such a switch in production for the largest GoPro market, North America had to be costly. I’m a long term bull on the company due to product alone, but as I’ve stated in here before...Woodman doesn’t have a clue about financials and operating expenses. He’s a great marketing guy but his pie,in the sky hype gets the best of him and costs investors every couple of years. Any thoughts/facts on these issues?"

"SAN MATEO, Calif., (November 14, 2017) – GoPro, Inc. (NASDAQ: GPRO) ushered in a new era of creativity with the announcement of its 360-degree camera, Fusion, which begins shipping to US and European customers today. With its ability to capture immersive 5.2K 360-degree spherical content, Fusion captures everything around you, so you’ll never miss the shot. And gimbal-like stabilization makes sure it all looks super smooth. The GoPro app enables users to control the camera, live preview their shots, and stitch, trim and share content right from their iOS smartphone (Android coming soon). On desktop, Fusion Studio (with Adobe Premiere Pro CC plug-ins) enables OverCapture, which lets you re-frame and save traditional fixed perspective videos “punched out” from the large 360-degree video. Fusion, together with its apps, enables people to capture and share unique perspectives that are not possible with traditional single lens cameras. Bring everyone in the moment with you. Shoot in all directions in stunning 5.2K""A mobile OverCapture experience and new visual presets including Tiny Planet and PanoFlow will be released in early 2018, while ongoing software updates will continue to enhance the experience for users.Fusion is already receiving praise for its outstanding design and engineering, earning a CES 2018 Innovation Award in the digital imaging category."

"Have a funny feeling they'll beat Q4 numbers raise the stock price again then sell. Getting rid of the drone department is trimming the fat. Let's not underestimate international sales particularly in China. Not long on Gpro anymore but there will be another run to $10-11 then we'll see a buy or a complete re-structuring. Bottom is at 5.58. At these levels, this is a BUY till Q4 results. There's always a silver lining. For those who want to make some good trades (not the masses who bough in high on this) there may be an opportunity here folks."
It’s strange that a camera fad turned into a public company. I haven’t seen anyone use a GoPro in years.
So a quick post... the stock is starting to build a shelf. Bad news that we are aware of is obviously factored in and all the ambulance chasers at this point shouldn't be impacting stock price. Preliminary sales numbers of the Hero5 would be good although some assumptions can be made from how long it takes to get your unit. And... Amazon is back selling it. All technicals pointing to an oversold condition -- so should move up before it goes down barring anymore bad news.
Earnings what time tomorrow?
He sold approximately $20m and that should hold him for awhile. He’s diversifying his wealth.
Calm before the perfect storm. Perfect buying opportunity. We will skyrocket Q1 2018. Charts says so as well as Hero6 seeing incredible sales and this isn't counting FUSION!!! Not to mention a brand new drone announcement. We've seen the bottom folks. Buy low. Sell high. So for GoPro. BUY BUY BUY!

Not Green leka.
"I think that GoPro reached an agreement with Xiaomi to where GoPro needs to get as much of its cameras off the market first before being bought out. Xiaomi would want this in order to sell more of their products once they buy out GoPro. Its known that GoPro cameras are made to last a while for the consumers, so this probably is the biggest issue Xiaomi would have with selling their new stuff because current GoPro camera owners would not even need to spend money on new cameras. Like if you agree, otherwise share your thoughts and opinions."
"Nothing but a double top action bringing price down lower in an overall HUGE bowl formation. The upward trend will resume again shortly after we clear out the double top formation downward trend. Learn how to chart guys and then you wont have any fear when a stock goes into a downward trend. As long as you understand the overall trend, the small downward trends wont scare you."
"Can we all agree that the recent run up is due to GPro FINALLY getting their act together and releasing Karma?If so, can we also agree that they are 2 years behind the ESTABLISHED competition and that when DJI releases their folding drone NEXT WEEK - MAVIC, it will crush any hopes that GPro could ""dominate"" this market? I would rather buy a drone from an ESTABLISHED company for close to the same price, for better specs and with better tech and software."
GoPro business is obviously dead but woddman will make more money manipulating his stock. The question is are there surfing days in prison?
Buy st 4.25
"Remember, when the negative articles start showing up, it's usually the time to buy.Big boy insiders MS, GS etc...(just like in the GOV) use media outlets to suppress stocks right before a 'good news' event.So, happy to see the neg article today - probably means GoPro is going up soon."
PHOT will buy GOPRO
they beat huge. Still a loss but .15 vs. .22 expected is solid and shows profitability—hopefully—going into the end of the year. Should be a bunch of buying going on after today...

ANYONE that missed GOOGLE IPO should invest in GPRO NOW. You will see SIMILAR run with GPRO over the next 5 years due to various initiatives going on with GPRO.
"Great camera, cheaper than GoPro. Cannot wait for the ""thumbs down"" from all of the geniuses who think doing that will change the facts.https://www.yahoo.com/finance/m/f16477a9-8833-3035-b424-6535e77b09f8/ss_this-action-ready-camera.html"
"Hi Guys !Gopro to face heavy resistance for now. But the products have been sold out in cities like Dubai and Mumbai. I have been reading reviews from the consumers and the retailers. 90 percent of the retailers and consumers prefer Gopro due to its Image quality, Stability and smart features. I believe the company will perform good in Q4 due to a very strong demand and good product launch."
I am no longer trading this stock to gain more shares. Time to hold (at least) for a couple of years.
No matter what's out on the earnings call...the stock will tank and go to $4.20 ...later it will pick up and go higher $8.50
According to the wsj gpro is in talks with amazon to be bought out for 10 dollars a share.
my estimate 8-10 by end of year then will trade a little higher in jan til earnings unless we have more news during that time of raising earnings even higher
"GOPRO may soon announce within 5 days some new wearables including floating sun glasses with three removable polarized lenses and case. I bought a pair. Is this a prelude to camera sun glasses like snap or just sun glasses. Either way, GOPRO way over due for new revenue stream."
it's going to 12 to 14 Next Week...
"Haha the epic GOPRO short squeeze continues, GOPRO onto 13s before ER."
What are the chances that this will touch 11 in 4 weeks

Articles saying APPLE GETTING INTO USA DRONE BUSINESSES
"Tech giants such as Apple Inc. (AAPL - Get Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL - Get Report) have more cash than they can spend, and could easily cover GoPro's roughly $840 million market cap. However, bidders for GoPro might be more likely to come from Shenzen than Silicon Valley"
"Trailing stop triggered this am at $12.11, but bought back little later at $12.10; wife was sooo upset I sold and made me rebuy soon after , lol"
GPRO LOSS NARROWS AND FORECASTING POSITIVE 2018;TUME TO BUY ITS CHEAP!
Stop loss set at $7.... this company may still have a lot of hopes but it has definitely lost faith in investors. Hopefully it won’t dip below $7 before Q4 report.
wow !! below 50DMA - bear raid.

"A goodbye letter to Craig, jbrad043, mark, Dan K, and Olivia Jagger:I did love the back and forth posts about GPRO but I have since moved on to Cryptocurrencies. What caught my attention was new about Bitcoin trading at $4,000 when I last heard about it was trading at $200 a couple of years ago. I watched alt coins like OMG jump 6900% and knew there was a different way to make money. For the last couple of months, I have open crypto wallets, accounts on exchanges around the world, and just put in an order to buy some mining machines out of Russian. I have participated in ICOs like 0x which I closed my position at a 800% profit, just close out KNC ICO at 300%, and sold NEO coins after a 40% jump.The cryptoworld now is just getting started and it's like internet in 1997 which only had AOL email. This is a huge shift. People no longer need banks to transfer money, it can be all done via cryptocurrencies for pennies, taking seconds, to anywhere in the world. Smart contracts will eliminate companies like Uber and Airbnb since it will eliminate the middleman and create a true peer to peer network. Even Etrade and Ameritrade will not be needed as people shift to decentralized exchanges.You obviously are very smart and very dedicated but I think you commit a huge about of time, chasing pennies with GPRO when you could be chasing hundreds or thousands of dollars in getting into cryptocurrencies.This video is a great interview with an ex-hedge fund manager, formerly of the investment firm Fortress Investment Group talking about cryptocurrencies. Please do your own research and make your own decisions but if you have any questions, feel free to contact me at jckpc@yahoo.com.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-09-26/how-macro-trader-novogratz-became-a-bitcoin-convert-video"
$22 within 2 1/2 months. $31.00 by end of Feb. Next spring.......$36 - $43. I still own 2000 shares @ 19.55Think positive!!!!
GPRO is down 5.93% to 3.57
THIS IS THE BEST PROGRESS I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS. THANK YOU GPRO.
Look at Tesla. Live n learn
This is what GoPro stock was doing right before it hit the roofs overnight. Maybe it's a mind-game to get ride of short-term traders. Who knows! There hasn't been any bad news that should force you to pull out prematurely. Don't be that person. Stay long and you'll keep getting rewarded. PS Look out for that tsunami surge to happen around 09/28.
"Facts are facts, boys, even if you don't like them. ""Although GoPro has lost almost 94% of its overall value since reaching its all-time high in 2014, it will continue experiencing more problems in the years ahead. Not only GoPro faces tough competition from other players in the industry, but it is also hampered by consistent lack of proper business management, increasing expansion as well as Research and Development (R&D) expenses, and decreasing brand popularity.All the recent news including GoPro's decision to layoff workers, substantial price discounting, as well as missing analyst's targets throws light on a fact that the action-camera maker is rapidly losing its significance in the market.The stock currently trades at its all-time low, and it will likely continue moving downward in the forthcoming years. The company's revenue has continued to fall, and its management has failed to diversify its business which is apparently not a good sign for investors."" GuruFocus"
"I went to Best Buy and session was out of stock/ sold out. Looks promising for clearing the way with the new entry level replacement. Good stock of Hero 5 and 6. And strong sales of same. Said all drone sales slow, but Gopro cameras a steady strong seller"
We had massive volume yesterday! I don’t know but my best guess would be this has less to do with earnings & more to do with large short interest! Watch volume today! Power to the people!!!!
Let's close above 5.75 today at the least.6-6.05 would not be surprise.
Back to 2.95 by morning
Rumor Apple to buy GoPro
60m traded today. buy out is on paper now.
is there going to be another push? ;^) above the .30
"Nick sell, you won't last another year."
"GoPro, Inc. (GPRO), VP, Corp/Bus Dev, GC, Sec, Saltman Eve T, Filled Form 4, on 03/10/2021, Disposed 10,000 shares, at Price $10 worth $1,00.000.Follow On Instagram, money_insider_stocknewsFacebook, Earnegy InvestmentsFor Stocks Inside News and Details."
The travel industry went bust this year and yet GPRO turns in its best earnings year in years. Looking forward - going into this year with low channel inventory should gain momentum as everyone looks to get outdoors and get away as COVID restrictions give way by this summer. Hiking the PCT is the top of my list. I see $25 - $30 by year end. Watch the 50-day MA for entry points along the way.
This jewel will finish today at $8.45. Mark this post. GO GO GPRO> Thank you Jesus.
Everyone here should read this: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/081216/top-5-shareholders-gopro-gpro.asp?partner=YahooSA&yptr=yahoo
"TECHNICALS FOR GPROSo, I studied GPRO and looked at various things.....ALL indicators are showing a good upside up to $18 or even $19 now. This stock is about to FLY. We have already met the low point yesterday and that is why we saw an upside. From its only upside till we meet the higher end which is $18 to $19 range. So my opinion, if you bought this stock hold. If you bought it above $19, then unload at anything above $18 because at that point it will retract back down and I do not know what that point will be at this point. Anyways, I think we will see upside from here till $18. Good luck everyone."
gpro take out $6 this week.
massive volume... big money has had it.. seems
Higher highs...Higher lows...TAKE NOTICE!
Between 10 am and 10:20 am someone bought about 2 million shares. Not sure what gives but definitely a bullish sign.

New GoPro camera  is coming out soon
Droppppp the boom.. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-hero7-black-earns-ces-140000116.html
Great GPRO vibes.Generating BUY orders!
They will probably report good earnings because of high volume sales and markdowns with the layoffs they will set a huge boost to profits 1 quarter boy wonder
"I hope they don't manipulate this down, the short position is 30%. They did that with SNAP today, couldn't get passed $9."
Does GoPro have their products made in China?
"Look at all the gopro fusion videos posted on youtube within the past month, each one is a sale and will lead to more sales. This is with the software being beta and only direct sales from GPs website. What will happen when this hits Amazon with the bugs ironed out."
market decided and seems enjoying seeing Nicholas booming his head to the well everyday trying to understand why market is damping his shares
$12 for SURE this year....Amazon will buy it for $12'sGoPro has hired JP Morgan to put itself up for sale.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/gopro-has-hired-jp-morgan-to-put-itself-up-for-sale.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cheadline%7Cstory&par=yahoo&doc=104934026&yptr=yahoo
Why risk or even hold into Q3 earnings? Analyst expect a increase of 90 million in revenue from Q2. Why buy the Hero4 when you knew the better 5 was coming out. I do not like the risk reward here. luck
"Funny true story -- I been testing the GoPro 7 black --it is a real ""Game Changer"" -- I purchased 2.6 million shares since December 1st -- my first purchase was at $4.14 - I am up over $1 million dollars -- since December 1st --"

3 Tech Stocks That I Wouldn't Touchhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tech-stocks-wouldn-apos-143000503.html
Gpro reports that they have about $250mm in cash? Either they drew on a line of credit or they haven't paid their suppliers.
Not engaged in selling talks? Too much drama for me today
"I went to Best Buy and he said gopro,s are flying off the shelves and a best seller in the store. He said its the only action camera that they recommend."
my take is Nick will take a offer for north of 15 per share min and that could happen any day
"""GoPro (GPRO) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.70 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.79 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items."" Now, is this postive or negative going forward?"
trade-up program is good idea.I like to see 5.33-5.4 to end the week if not more. Settle down here for now.
Gopro 4 days Memorial special. Time to upgrade.
$20 today
margin calls coming
hopefully $14 this week!!
"Results out. Seems like after market is taking it as a mixed bag, but up about 30 cents right now. Decent guidance for 2Q."
"I once owned this stock and decided to sell it when it was trading in the 70s so that I could buy AAPL, one of the best decisions I ever made. I never imagined GPRO would sink to the single digits, it's kinda sad actually. I have a Go Pro and used to use it until something went wrong with the battery, hasn't been able to hold a charge since. :-\"
I've been putting a little bit into go pro every pay day. I find it to be a huge buying opportunity.
New HOD--as predicted much earlier.Headed well north of$6++
58 bucks a share is my break even lets do this GoPro
"Wow, it looks like GPRO is finally going to break out to the upside. I guess everybody should dust off the upper right side of their screen!"
"What's propelling GoPro to improved earnings is the same course of action that propelled EA to improved earnings over the past 9 years. They initiated layoffs, narrowed their focus, cut out products that were lacking, their stock then went up 1000% Guess where most of the senior management team for GoPro used to work? EA."
"To bad I don’t have taht much money I only have 10,000 at 18 is that ok?"
"The perpetual GoPro bears acting like experts are really just disgruntled day traders having to make that fatal GoPro short decision of whether to cover immediately or @ $11 Tuesday.""Sell your GoPro position for profits before institutions sell for theirs..."" stupid f'fin day trader mentality. Sell Monday and guess who buys your shares?!.......that's right genius, INSTITUTIONS are buying ."
"Hopped out of this today at a break-even $8.50 as I didn't see any major moves coming. Yet this seems to be the one stock I never get right. Good movement and volume today for those holding. I don't think seeing 9s is that far off. I'm in and out of LXU in the meantime. Short term this looks strong, but with the Friday turn, long term direction right now is a bit unknown (based purely on charts). Good luck to those holding."
Trading below FIT
"mark my words. I am not selling until it is above 50. there is no global leader in a field, like gpro in motion camera, has a market cap less than 7 billon"
holiday season I thought GoPro going to be good but guess not
"Yup, his is a breakout. If it survives the ER and can break above the Feb 27 high.... we might have something here!"
BUYERS returning...look for new HOD!
Drone hobby is coming to an end. This will impact cameta sales big.
The second one is happening right now
"Director, Nicholas Woodman, Filled Form 4 on 02/24/2021, bought 153,744 shares worth approximately $1.1 million.Follow @money_stock_pick for inside tradings news and sec filling details"
Four large insiders (Including Mr Woodman) dumped stock at $3.81. Goes to show their confidence that the current run up will hold.
"New article says Facebook has just hired 2new media videos production executives. One of the new Facebook exec Henrich, is explaining how the new Facebook video media platform is all “storytelling” and he used the word “storytelling” at least 3-4 times in the paragraph. STORYTELLING MEDIA VIDEO PLATFORM IS EXACTLY HOW GOPRO EXPLAINED THEIR MEDIA EXPERIENCE.IMO FACEBOOK BUYS GPRO and any day."
"GOPRO's coming up big today with massive gain, amen..."
Anyone in the WSB group on Reddit? Would love to know what's being bantered there....
I still feel like this stock is very undervalued! I see growth
"Apple would never buy them. maybe amazon, make them alexa enabled. but why waste your time with this stinker folks? this company is done"
Reverse head and shoulders flashingGREEN=BULLISH for GPRO.
This is gonna BOUNNNNNNCE
AAPL should buy it
"The recent drop was a good bear trap. Well see where $GME, $AMC, and $GPRO can go."
DJI will launch a new action camera at the same time(likely day after)GoPro product launch in September. Same game plan as karma launch and DJI launched Mavic Pro the next day. DJI YT reviews are. Sry favorable and most preferring DJI. Influencers switching to new Osmo action as DJI copies and then approves on Hero line. DJI AI investments will be seen in new line up as will the new DJI clod for drone and Osmo action data and editing. This is the last nail in GoPro coffin.
Any word if Woodman was included in the layoffs? This would really pop then...
So how big a bounce do people expect tomorrow? I would guess around 5 
Having the entire market yourself in a declining market is a bad business to be in.
BOOM

"No matter what the shorts do , this stock is poised for 15$ . Steaming , Subscription, hardware , software , accessories , brand Promotion, positive cash flows and profits are all good things happening for this stock. You tube enthusiasts and even film makers are into Gopros. What if GoPro taps the film industry next ? Huge Revenue potential with huge gains . Watch next 2 years buddies . Please short again hahahaha"

Why is this up?
Finally broke $6. It has to hold in order for me to get interested.
Any rumors about what’s next for features and specs gopro max 2 or hero 10? What do we think about 360 video catching on or will it be a bust like 3D tv?
"Chart looks good, no reason why SP can't reach $11.75 before pullback/correction."
As I mentioned 240 million plus in revenue and -0.07 to -0.01 EPS. How’s is it going for the shorts now ? Next quarter we are gonna see around 10$.
Waiting for 8.62.
You people that live on these boards are too funny. Your posts don't sway a stock's price one way or the other. But if you want to waste your life posting on some yahoo board be my guest. I check in from time to time but I don't live here like you losers.
"Craig....? where are you, brother.."
"Apple should buy GoPro -- GoPro is using MP4 -- plus GoPro 7 Black should be taught at every Grade School, High School and College in America -- it is the #1 Action Camera in the WORLD -- GoPro Stock - Buy Now -- $4.31 a share"
They had some interesting insights about GPRO on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This baby is on the move. Don't try to stop it now.
Another 500% and most might be even. LOL
Just bought gopro last week. the earnings scare me.
"I have a funny feeling these WSB will be pumping GoPro next, the next GME"
they don't buy woodman's plans?
Lol some one want to buy 40000 shares at 6.00$ but could barely fill the order. Where are all the shorts ? Hahahahaha
Margin calls Tonight for a lot of people .....
Oh Yeah YEAH!! This stock is flying of the window sill today and yesterday! I told you so
"APPLE is getting into the ORIGINAL TV and FILMS BUSINESS. Facebook, Google and APPLE they all want to own GOPRO and one of them will after this quarter"
"If Karma has an attachment rate of just 5% on the 10M+ existing H4 cameras, that's approximately $300M+ in revenue.I could care less if Karma has low market share -- which it will compared to DJI. The fact is, H4/H5 users WILL choose Karma. That's the power of the ecosystem GoPro has built.It's a no brainer - buy/hold through Q1 ER."
Nick should announce a 10-for-1 reverse split.
Strong brand destroyed by horrible management.
Sad.Not just for GoPro but for everyone cheering it’s demise.Fd up world.
Love Apple plus GPRO!
"No one is going to buy gopro and try to compete with Chinese companies. Gopro is sinking, the drone is dead, there are no new ideas. They are going to try to milk this for another year and reduce staff along the way. Leasing or selling patents is all that will be left."
1 week to completely destroy almost 2 months of uptrend !
Sold all my stock today in this loser...I had too. It's a slow death and better opportunities elsewhere.
just got this feeling news after the close not sure what it is just news we shall see!
Sam  Thank you for returning.I was super lonely  without you Thank you

"Poor Leka tried to catch a falling knife from $9+ to $5.37 but thinks he is a pro for ""averaging down""There are some real ""pros"" on these message boards. LOL"
Hope CEO won't give any warnings on earnings
Stop watching share prices daily and buy the stock . It will hit new highs in 2020.
"I did more short this morning and wiped out my losses, now making gain !!!"
If you are making a financial decision based on what people say on yahoo finance you will never succeed . Do you own math just don’t listen to any one.
h hopefully they announce BO tonight
"wait, they still sell GoPros? Havent seen one in ages"
"Nice boost with fake subscriptions. New Gopro 9 comes with FREE one year subscriptions, they aren't getting money for these new numbers."
"It was almost exactly three years ago, at ~10, that I told you this was going to be dead-money at best. And I based it all on one very simple reason: broken stock. A stock that drops +85% AND stays down for 2+ quarters, isn't making any meaningful comeback with like a 95-98% probability. And a very substantial comeback has like a fraction of one percent chance.What about now? It's still a broken stock! May be you get a move to 8-10 if you're lucky, but that's about it."
Into the 7s again here we come(;
"Good ""getting in "" point! Up and up!"
$6.05 and climbing
"Once again, Mark is sitting at home with his billions and share holders are holding the bag. Take a look https://investor.gopro.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/GoPro-Announces-Second-Quarter-2019-Results/default.aspxStop supporting Wall Street people, Please take your monies away."
I believe the best bet for a buyer will come from China. I believe the price could be in the 10.00 - 12.00 range.
"I spoke to Gopro staff at its booth in CES three weeks ago. I learned that while Gopro gave up its ambition in the drone market by laying off people in the Karma division, it still continued to sell and support the current Karma drone. Basically, there will be no Karma 2, but Karma 1 is still on the shelf. It was disappointing to hear that Gopro exited from the drone market, but it might a good move for Gopro. After all, the Karma division has under-achieved by delaying the initial release, had a recall for its debut, and have not followed up with a Karma 2 after one year of Karma 1's release. Cutting off an under-achieving department is a difficult decision to make, but sometimes a business has to make such decision to focus on its core profitable business for the short term. While it continues to sell the current Karma 1, it will provide revenue, and even some profit, from the Karma sales (though the bad publicity will negatively impact sales), because the Karma dept has been trimmed of excessive cost."
Why this bitvh went down? No news maybe nick is dumping the stock
Just watch this video and tell me which company does more to attract its investors than GROPRO. This company has a very bright future ahead.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOuF7ZbcCUs&feature=emb_logohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOuF7ZbcCUs&feature=emb_logo

"Harmon andGoPro will be talking again. At these levels I wouldn’t be surprised to see DJI just go for a buyout. Remember, GoPro producing its own chips. gp2 chip in next line up. DJI could use that to fatten margins across entire line of tech."

Not worries at all. Doubling my position when it hits $7.50.
And now GPro is $6.30 so I guess this paid pumper is not that goodOrenAlast year$GPRO conversationwe will open above $10 and go green in the first 2 hours had 25000 shares bought 4000 more at 9.50 don't mine if it opens low so i can sale my protection puts but I know it will open strong the earnings wasn't bad at all the future looks great.lets make America great again and buy American
"to recap ER , $350 m in case , something neve been before,$100 m generating from operation , 145% increase on subscribers with estimate of $100 m in revenue ,no debts as the lone will be converted,confidence guideline for 2021 , by the dip , no question"
GoPro is up 6.50% to 4.99
What’s the tangible book value of GRPO now?
"HERO 10. Looks like the 10 will have built in 5G wireless chip. Add your GoPro to your wireless phone account , like an iPad, and use wireless data on your account to livestream, upload content direct. No phone needed. This will allow a feature to also live chat one on on ( zoom style). I bet GoPro will be sold in wireless carrier stores as well. This will make for a much easier user experience. Buy the dips."
after hours trading looks like lots of people are selling off they terrified for earnings report. hoping for the best
"I understand the idea of direct to consumer, but what about all the stores that carry their products. years ago when Woodman was on Shark Tank he praised the decision to put the cameras in Walmart (lower margins, but higher volume). If they can really cut costs without sacrificing or cannibalizing their sales this could be good in the long run."
upgrade
GoPro stepped up their game 
Woodman will file bankruptcy soon.

"FY earnings will be positive (that's what the consensus analyst estimate says). The new cameras are in the shelves in almost two weeks. Right in time for the XMAS present season... This stock has been bombed - and the dust is settling. In my opinion, this stock has far more chances to get back over $4 than below $2.75"
$4's tomorrow. Watch for the downgrades.
why the increase today? Just hype from FIT? or there any specific reasons?

shaking the tree and picking bottom feeders
"Sold my Call, took profit! Enjoy longs, could hit $9 today"
Craig short interest increased to 41 million from 39 million yet gpro is still going up . If you don’t get it then you don’t know how to invest . I am sure shorts will realize they have already lost it and will start covering just wait for Q1 2019. I expect this to go up to 12$ by then .
"So seems like this particular stock doesn't work well for me. 4 other positive trades this week too. AAAHHH. So -- obviously down day on somewhat heavy volume, but really nothing like ""day after earnings"" volume. Just seemed light today. Other stocks like FIT also suffered. Seems we may have caught this on both ends. Regardless, I'm sticking with my sell at $8.75 for now. We shall see. I know many here have been holding long for a while - hoping things turn around for you sooner than later. Seemed most of the news was positive although GPRO did lower expectations making sure they could hit. I do expect a better Q2 with the trade-in program in full force."
I might jump in once it reaches 1 penny
Level Ii asks trending much higher. Bullish reversal just underway.Now confirmed.
time to short!!
shorts will be squeezed like lemon today
"What a delicious time for a buyout! Apple could buy GoPro, announce it on their conference call next week, and have GoPro confirm that Woodman is leaving the following day. Or maybe Woodman will just leave."
"GPRO needs to diversify into military applications, surveillance and on-dash cams for fleets."
"This is NOT good news for GoPro, didn't they layout of 200 people in November saying they were going to be profitable in 2017 only to lower guidance during Q4 earning report. Now they are laying off 270 people in order to meet lowered guidance for Q1 and say (again) they will return to profit in 2017. Are you a little worried that they only talk ""revenue"" and not talking ""sales""? I would say sell some covered calls but the stock it too cheap and it would be a waste of time. Enjoy the 13% pop and taking some off the table while you can."
I noticed that insider share ownership have gone up from 10% to nearly 40% and with institutional holding at nearly 40% there's not gonna be any spare float to cover the shorts
Woodman unloaded a bunch of shares this past week. Check the SEC filing.
"I am sorry for the people that had to endure it, but I am glad Citron came up with the bearish report since it gave the opportunity to invest in this company at 19. The company is amazing and the stock a beast "
May this stock hit $15 by EOY#PapaBless
Nothing a future 20 to 1 reverse stock split cannot take care of! lol
Just got upgraded by Longbow Research.
No valid reason to be Long ....we see that now ...
Are earnings coming out tomorrow before the bell or after the bell? I could look it up but if someone can help me out it'll save me some time. Thanks in Advance.
This stock's PPS obviously doesn't want to be held down anymore.
Very Good News is going to come.
"There you go, SEC investigation as I said"
Close to million shareswill trade first hour!This is HUGE...
this thing just makes me sick to watch.....gets crushed as soon as it makes any headway.....good news gets met with tireless shorting....this thing is hopeless....there will be no Christmas for gpro!

When can I get even on GoPro at 20/ shr ? Long time sufferer here.
"If I were short from $10 or above, I would start covering here and lock in the profits. This could easily run to $8.5 by early next week. If it runs all the way to $9 or higher, I'd consider going short again. If Hero 7 is as good as the reviews claim, they could have an exceptional holiday season and I think going back to $6 is off the table for a while."
Catching our breath.Headed MUCH higher!

No resistance untilwell north of $6++!!
"Can someone tell me consensus on subscriptions for the next qtr? I haven't seen anything. They mentioned bottom line growth and profits on revenues of 25% Y/Y. But they haven't mentioned if they are looking to add 300K (50%) or 750K (100%) as they have the last 2 qtrs??? I know they are attacking subscriber base aggressively as they see this as their future of in-house, low overhead sales for additional products and services."
BO BO BO BO news please
James Brumley of Investor Place writing an a new article on the end of GoPro is an article from a failing investment journalism company. Brumley had not been able to make his mark within the investment community and jumps jobs every two years. He’s trying to be sensational and just a hind site journalist with no vision. Look at his bio and Investor Place as a company. They are failing and would be very fortunate to be as successful as GoPro. Your noise should be embarrassing. Go back in your den.

I own 1/3 of 1% of all the outstanding GOPRO stock. I will continue to stay long and believe stock will be in low teens in two years. I am very disappointed that neither Woodman nor McGee even mention shareholder value or any reference to the shareholders. I’m glad they have learned how to run financial and operational aspects of the company. The essence of a public is to create shareholder value-no mention. I will communicate with McGee directly and point out the absence of delivering for shareholders. A self centered communication is not good enough.
I’m seeing close above 4 today
We will be green in the first hour we close around $6.00
Finally Osmo Pocket is selling with mix reviews. Just see what people has to say about video quality . As I said GoPro is by far ahead in that space and personally if I had to buy I care more about the video quality than other features . So would it be a GoPro killer lol 
"Bagholders dump before this hits 6.66, the mark of the beast!"
live-streaming. Now we're talking...
All-in-all gopro is good tech company. Hope big player can benefit from
"Guess what, those Hero 6 Black unboxing videos I found on Youtube yesterday are no more.... Interesting. Someone must have gotten in trouble for that one. They no longer show up in a youtube search and they are gone from my viewing history..."
Picked up more puts
Who needs a GoPro camera to capture the experience of a free-fall without a net when all you really have to do is buy some of its stock and get the same effect...
"Take a look at a 3 or 6 month chart of GPRO. Turn on 50 and 200 day moving average indicators. We had a bullish cross of the 50 and 200 day moving averages occur about Sept 7. Good things happen when the 50 DMA lives above the 200 DMA. The 200 DMA has levelled off and the rising 50 DMA has been retested. If it's defended here it could turn into a technical buy real quick and massive volume will pour in and it will retrace into the upper 17's,.... regardless of what the overall market is doing right now. Just my opinion.... any other thoughts gang?"
I'm out. I had to sell the only loser in my portfolio to offset some of the gains I realized on other positions. Do I buy back in on the hopes someone might aquire GoPro someday? I don't know.
Big things are starting to happen for Gopro its about time. We should see a big stock price increase today. GO GPRO!
And soon the news of being bought out...shorts be careful
"Here's what I find a bit shocking. None of the directors/execs (including Woodman) are buying at these historic lows. I mean, you come out on the stage and speak of confidence that you'll be fine. That's lip service. Back it up with a personal buy or some sort of stock buyback even, that's tangible action.What strange too is that there have been ZERO ""Automatic"" any transactions in the last 60 days too (sure this is just a coincidence). I'm not here to bash, I've actually stated in my last handful of posts that where we are is where we were headed. But, here we are and I'm just not sure now based on lastest information. Anyone have any compelling info besides the great brand yada yada yada? Anyone see any red flags on their cash position & cash flow? Forward P/E 21? If we have a decent market correction, I actually think it will shake the heck out of GPRO tree and we'll see $4s. Maybe I'll just wait for that?"
"Real tough to break that $11 mark. Earnings report can take it there if it’s good. Prediction 24 hrs after earnings sub $10 until consecutive good earnings. GPRO needs to prove consecutive earnings for a solid $12/share is the new 10day MA. Subscription service is key, if they get 10% increase in those subscribers it will have bagged a solid $11/ share. GL HF"
"Olivia makes some good points. Not all fallen stars are stars... some are duds. But Olivia, to your point, Apple launched an empire off of tablets and a phone. And really, not much has changed. There are a number of large-scale commercial applications for these cameras. I don't believe the drone market will be their savior in any way, shape or form. Also, I noticed some hostile responses to your initial email. It certainly isn't a requirement to own the stock to have an opinion if it is sound -- and yes, the market has punished this stock, rightfully so. Mark -- I'm a bit surprised at your comments both to Olivia and Jason. While I don't have any use for Craig most of the time, it seems you might be pumping the stock -- and I own it. Factually speaking we know the stock gained about 11% yesterday and held on to 8%. We also see today that while it gave a little back, it seems to be holding above 10 with decent volume. We also know that there has been a decrease in shorts by 5% since last week - but this is with a stock that had 32% short to start and that's HUGE. It seems the Hero 5 sold well. But, as Olivia stated, Woodman has been HORRIBLE to date in his delivery. Aside from historical numbers and 2016, which we all need to know about, they need a solid plan for 2017 that will help this stock North and restore faith in this company.Really holding anything near 10 today will be a win as far as I'm concerned. A little up or down doesn't really matter."
Just added 500 sh BULLISH GPRO
Sam heeeeeelp

7.54 test coming this week IMHO
Not sure why anyone would still own this...Except for a WRITE-OFF...the end is coming fast....keep buying and throw it away ....

"gopro should pivot to clothes manufacturing or maybe shoe making,ya know, something where the USA has a competitive advantage, like electronics manufacturing"
"All aboard, the boat is filling up. Remember folks, it takes time to fill the boat. But when no one wants to sell anymore, that's when we take off. Same thing happened in Sept.when GoPro pulled back to $12.60 area, then sprung up to over $17.50 over the next few weeks. Same ting is happening here. You need to buy when you're terrified"
"Victor, Sam, say something bad about gopro."
"I have lost so much money and too much confidence in this stock to care what new drama Goodman is trying to swing? Over the past 4 years, it has been an absolute disaster. I now only have a forgettable number of shares. I am still absolutely traumatized by this stock. I wish it well but my goodness... I want my time and mental health back!"
good brand with good belance sheet but no love from investor.
Reddit army?
Short squeeze! Buyout! New CEO! Some many options.
I bought a put
woodman has completely failed all shareowners since ipo. He should move on before any more damage can occur.
Hello... YouTube subscribers. Remember I'm in for the long term. These pullbacks are only short term. GoPro is a great company and will be a winner.
"I.. I... I am hurt by your comments, Amana. I really thought you would have exercised more couth than that- People expect more from such a GPRO icon. Oh, ye of little faith.... Perhaps you'd be better served to buy Kimberly-Clark Corp (manufacturers of Kleenex)KMB as of Jun 07 10:17 AM ET135.32 1.74 1.30% But, for the sake of redundancy, let us hear you cry about GPRO some more... in the Key of B flat,, please! Just bought more GPRO at $5.79"
Come on GPRO give us $10.00 or better. THANK YOU JESUS.
Tempting to buy a little at 5.50.
My name is craig. I am neither short nor long this stock. I just have a great business mind and exceptional foresight into the mind of the electronics consumer. I will read your posts and let you know why you are wrong. I live a lonely life. I have to go feed my cats now. Be back in 15 minutes.
Will close 5.50
sold out
"This stock is seriously underrated. Rated one of the top 10 coolest brands and has a huge cash pool available, Gopro isn't going out anytime soon."
"I made a lot of Money from my position in Mu, Intel , appl, and Albemarle , now its Gopro turn."
this might crash to 4.50
"GOPRO SUBSCRIPTION PLAN is $4.99/month and if you break your camera, they will send you another. That is about $60/year. Thing is, Squaretrade will do it for between $35-40/year for 3 years. GoPro is already priced out of the market! Hahahaha...come on Woodman...stop it...you're too funny!"
starting a position $3.25 and will double down at $2.60 and $1.30
Yeah looks like buyout is going to happen soon
Who said it was going to 6 last week?
"Hedge fund Prentice Capital Management, however, has focused on acquiring a larger stake in GoPro stock. Prentice said that as of Aug. 5, it owned 7.9 million GoPro shares, a stake of 6.51%. When the fund’s ownership level ticked over 5%, it was required to make the disclosure in a form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission."
There is some else going on with this company - Haven't seen such a bullish pattern earlier - specially with no news
Like a volcano getting ready to erupt!

"LEKA: Where you at, little buddy? Wave those pom poms, quick! You need some lift!"

"Best Buy check for DJI Action cameraA large store and no DJI Action Camera on display. They can take orders, but delivery subject to completion of enhancements. No orders yet. Looks like they are setting up for Holidays. Gopro refresh will crush DJI this season. The annual shareholder meeting 1st week in June will be very positive and I expect the stock to hit 8 after meeting."
buy below 12$ now before December 2020 results.
I have faith this this stock will rise after hours with better than expected news...

I'll buy buy buy. Even at $8. I know i'm going to make mad money:)
On fire today guys (and girls)! Buy LOW and sell HIGH (Craig haha)! To the moon and beyond!

GoPro short trolls better COVER. Get ready for the GOPRO BULLISH SURPRISE ..... prepare your gravestone Shorty Free advice ....take it
"Ok, so we're not seeing the blowout numbers to drive post ER surge in the price... I'll grant that.For the first time since buying shares I read the full earnings report and I must say I am impressed with the turnaround:1) free cash flow of > 300M as of Q4 is pretty impressive;2) transition to direct sales will continue to drive results in 20213) the $49/$99 subscription is evidently a no-brainer for retail customers, especially when they save so much on the unit and accessories4) enhancements to the app and the potential to convert free app users to paid subscribers - this will have the effect of converting to future purchasers of >$300 units5) reduction in capex was largely related to displays/costs associated with staging the GOPRO displays in retail locations... with transition to direct sales this capex reduction is likely to be a permanent savings6) appearance of direct sales underperformance is explained by better-than-expected rebound in retail salesThe Guidance given is resoundingly conservative for 2021 I believe. With a forward PE of 7-11 this is a steal for anyone who is wanting to hold this for 12 m or more. But even for the next 6 months I believe we'll see steady climb from $9 to $15, but believe we'll hit $20 before the end of the year.When asked what the plan was for leveraging the cash flow, the CFO I believe said they rolled some of it into debt retirement and planning for some that are due in 2025. This is building investor value.Summary - we're not going to see a short squeeze.... and No Reddit pumped craziness. BUT I now believe we'll see $20 before 12/31/2021. At this price point it's worth holding.Would love to get your reaction to my post. Rational discussion everyone."
"Repost from 4/9""So I am the frustrated long guy.....9/8/15, 200 shares @ $606/20/16, 250 shares @ $ $53.509/1/15, 233 shares @ $42.9310/25/17, 950 shares @ $9.72Total -$23k and break even @ $23.31I have been through the lows of lows and sticking through the consistent earnings misses. That being said, for once I am confident in the turnaround. Not for the hardware, but for the value-added services and finally the direction woodman's people have instituted. W/O his team they would be f'd. He is a joke, but this will be a $50 stock in a year. Screenshot this and we will see you next spring.""Averaged down again @ $12 for 166 shares. Was 2 days too soon, but that was the entire market that dipped. Not Gopro exclusivley.Cheers"
Average cost around $3.70 now...still think we will be above $4.25 in the next few day’s.
"Last night I told my kids a story about the olden days, when people were willing to pay $90 a share for this stock! They didn’t believe me."
"I didn't see anyone post this. Interesting. Gopro could have easily gotten into people's home with their brand name and a twist on this (without straying too far from core). Netgear has a great name and position for this. Anyhow, just more noise in the marketplace for GPRO.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netgear-planned-arlo-ipo-sounds-141033600.html"
I’m thinking 15 by Friday? What about you guys. This stock still so undervalued if you think about their recent financials and their paid video subscription service
So a good time to buy on the dip. Also good day for PUTs and leaps.
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 6.98
"wow, i hope GPRO Shares are wearing a Gopro camera, because this fantastic fall will look spectacular in 4K"
"Since employing APPLES Sr. Designer, GoPro has been acting more like APPL and less like""tiny Craig the GoPro Troll""""Silence is golden"""
"Woodman appears to be living in some sort of alternate reality, his own version of the movie Ground Hog Day. He keeps making the same $400 camera, for fun throws in an even more overpriced $500 version and appears genuinely surprised they need to be heavily discounted to sell. He has been using the same excuse since 2015. His whole upper management team, what's left of it is inept but Woodman is the real problem. A totally incompetent CEO who needs to step down but won't. For everyone who keeps saying the worst is priced in, clearly it is not. GPRO is down 26% YTD and down another 4% after hours."
"Happy Friday, longs! In case you missed it...GPRO has NO SERIOUS bidders for a potential sale."
"I just spent the last few hours watching the Intro Event, and listening to the conference call. My initial reaction was that GoPro just hit one out of the park. Pricing is right where it should be and this will definitely be on the top of everyone's Christmas list.After listening to the conference I was somewhat disappointed when it was revealed that Karma does not have a ""follow me"" capability. I should think that the next iteration of Karma will probably incorporate a follow me feature. That said I went to the GoPro web site and watched all of the videos about the drone itself, the stabilization mount, and the controller itself. What I discovered, is Karma was designed to be the most user friendly drone available so that even a person who has no drone piloting experience will be able to master the use of this incredible camera platform easily and confidently. There is even a flight simulator built into the controller so that you can practice using the controller and view a Karma drone in simulated flight on the controller screen without ever having the actual drone take off. There are several pre-programmed flight paths that can be used to do some common video paths. One is a 360 degree circle path around the subject, another is a from point A to point B flight path and another is a path that pans from the ground below to the horizon while the drone flies forward.The fact that the stabilization system can be removed from the Karma drone, and turned into a hand held stabilization device is a huge plus which enables hand held Hero 5 cameras to be turned into an autonomous GoPro camera stabilization platform.You can get spare batteries, motor arms, propellers etc as reasonably priced accessories too.I have to say that one of the things that GoPro does that I find is heads and shoulders above any other company out there, is that GoPro has the capability to produce the most stunning promotional marketing videos that can knock you socks off. GoPro's promotion videos make you want to go out and buy their latest and greatest gadgets. It is my guess that when the holiday season gets here you are going to see GoPro promotional videos targeting the Christmas shoppers and the new Hero5 Black and Karma drone packages are going to be selling like hotcakes at the $1099 price point. And for those who already have a Hero4, the $799 Karma package will sell well too.With these new product offerings, I think GoPro is back on track to be the leader in this field, and I predict a very bright future if they stay on this course.GLTAL"
Bankruptcy Nick. Announce it you gobber!
"it's amazing how many "" experts"" hate this company and stock. you don't see too many stories that are positive! all they want to do is crush this stock. lets see what earnings do."
"My prediction of $8.14 in 17 days, 6 days ago will come to fruition. GoPro owns the majority market share in this space and will continue. They can flatline or grow, but will at least remain stable. They will slowly take aim towards social media, which can open up additional revenue at minimal costs or at least open new eyes for a takeover. Things look decent for GoPros future, no one grows without learning from past mistakes...mistakes are good."
"WAY to much competition for gopro now. I'm afraid the GoPro era is falling hard. I've been racing dirt bikes with GoPro cameras my whole life until about 2 years ago when I discovered way better and cheaper brands. Infact, me and the buds use to call it a GoPro and now we call it a ""action camera"" just because there is so many brands."
the best short in my lifeeeee!!
https://www.stockme.info/news/2019/05/09/gopro-announces-first-quarter-2019-results?aid=999

I hope many of you bought more in the low 7's...Up over 20% from those lows..
Wishing us all a Merry Christmas!!

"If they beat revenue guidance Q1 then, $16 soon. If new subscription strategy is progressing, then, $20 is near."
Here in Slovakia  people are buying GoPro it is sold out. What’s wrong with this company?
"From Barron’s about Black Friday and GoPro. Don’t worry...it’s only based on facts :)GoPro, meanwhile, appeared to be one of the weekend’s losers. “GoPro data points are simply not positive on a few fronts,” McCourt writes. He points to weak search and download trends, as well as “substantial” inventory at Best Buy by weekend’s end. And the older Hero 5 camera may be outselling the new Hero 6, which costs $100 more."
Ok my wish is coming ture. I think it will be around 10-11$
BUY BUY
Can someone donate me some money for more gopro stock
Just bought GOPRO sunglasses with replaceable lens. Stock will jump on this news when announced.
Back in LONG 3.80. I think(hope)any bad news built in here. All time low stock price today just as GPRO turning a profit and really getting their business model in order. HEORO 8 looks amazing and should push majority of GoPro users to upgrade. Announcement of new products coming soon! GP2 is an amazing new chipset.
finally a news article on GoPro. Stock is up today and let's hope it continues to inch it's way up heading into 4th quarters earnings report.
Losing $ again for 3rd time since when it was @65 in n out . LolUnreal
You cannot continue to lose money every quarter and stay in business unless they dilute or get a buy out .. that’s a fact
"Sony using OIS for stabilization and Gopro using EIS. while sony has a great name out there but Finally GPRO is able to challenge them with there EIS stabilization technology. This is the perfect time to diversify to other markets in cameras for gopro and compete with sony etc. This stabilization is so good that it will prove to be the turn around point for GPRO. sorry craig but we cant ignore facts about GPRO new products and I would remain bullish on GPRO as I am bullish on INTC, MU, PDLI, SANOFI. Thank you for all your suggestions but I am still up for accumulating shares of these stocks."
This is the Strongest I have seen the stock in over a year. Went thru 6 like no one elses business.. WOW...Cup and handle in a neighberhood near you :)
DJI has an uphill battle against competing with GoPro in the handheld action camera business. They should stop wasting money and just buy them! Buyout!
Short interest up to over 28%. Any good news...and this takes off like a rocket. Only reason I can find for yesterday’s big sell off was shorts taking positions. That’s time to go long. Wait for it.
RED - And the trend continues. Did not get the follow through it needed.
"Not that's a great Karma review!If you can't get the by the link just Google search ""GOPRO DRONE!!! Karma flying in NYC""."
GPRO is down -6.18% to 5.62

Holiday sales critical for GoPro to stay afloat. DJI will undercut on price and over developer on tech. Back to 4.00. No one will even want to buy this company at a premium knowing DJI is crushing them. It’s over.

GPRO reached a new All Time Low at 6.10
Ok...does ANYONE have a real explanation (like some real news) as to why this is jumping up and trading so many shares after hours? Is Reddit involved?
All the talk I see is good! So getting a $11 call option early this morning looks good!
stock should not be punished like this...
Someone wake Leka up so he can average down more and buy more shares at $5.26!!!EOY!!! PROFITS!!! ALL THAT MATTERS!!! MARK IT!!!! LOL
gopro to release karma sept 19 read all about it!!!
"luv all the ""its a hold"" comments. Really! do u want to hold a ""hold"" when you can buy a buy...if it was a good Q with good guidance, it would be up as thats what good Q's do to stock AH and thereafter.might be time for the goog to add this to the fitbit purchase. its a ""hold"" at best :) spacs, are a buy! Agc will make merger news soon."
"There are shortages from the factories, because the company told them to reduce quantities. They just left the inventory build phase. They still have a couple months to legitimately push product into channels.....Except... the channels are pushing back. The wholesale customers are not loading up as expected..It's that simple."
"A great day to average down, again. 7.43. I hope the market corrects soon and provides a 5-6 buy point. The exhaustion of those holding and watching this stock drift down could make for a nice dip as well. Good luck!"
$15 soon ...
This earnings report will be make or break for GoPro. It is better than preliminary reports then the company may hold on for a while. Otherwise it is pretty much dead. I'm thankful that I invested very little in this stock. But even though my stake is small I may still jump into one of the class-action lawsuits against the horrible management of the company.
"GoPro has the making of a Blackberry-like story. Low debt, one-trick-ponies, slowly diversified away from flagship product..."
Sell now
If this CEO resigned the stock would pop. He played down the takeover eventually he will be the only employee at GPRO.
"Trash stock. I bought at 40 years ago, rode it to 90ish, sold my entire position and then watched it slowly crater to single digits. This stock has been stuck below 10 bucks a share for about 7 years now."
WHEW! UP 4 CENTS AH! Time to retire...
"without any other news, it seems the market likes the recent deal by gpro with Jabil."
GPRO is up 6.45% to 5.78

"so basically Nick cannot sell more than 3,500,000 more B Shares and he could lose control of Gopro"
Motley Fool sure coming out hard against GPRO.. 4 articles in two weeks. At the end they tell you to consider buying other stocks besides GPRO
Wallstreetbets said BUYQ LET'S GOOOO! YOLO
going for 5.5
The longs will be smiling this week. Load up Monday morning folks. Uptrend ahead and we'll be seeing green.
"Let’s see SNAP negative earnings and it gains 22%, GPRO positive earnings beat on both fronts up 3%, what a crock"
The only bad thing about GoPro is the CEO himself.
"Most frustrating stock I own. Every time it seems to be ready to break out, it plummets right back down again."
Bought some at 4.03 will sell at 4.2 in a few hours.
"I have no doubt Gopro Drone, Hero 5, and Sessions will be among the top selling Christmas items around the World. At $14.50ish this is the stock buy of the year.There is No competition!!"
Great news! Nick is allowing GPRO bankruptcy proceedings to be filmed by GoPro customers. Yay!
when to exit is the question now.

He’s an expert in Merger and Acquisitions as well; No background here, just believe that because he says that no company has every announced interest in acquiring GoPro means that noone is interested; if you disagree he will fight you (Hes probably also a MMA champion / title holder during his 20 year tenure at Maker Studio)3. His qualitative assessment on why people should just use their phones to film action shots is the gold standard. The reason is the cloud and that some smart phones are cheaper than GoPros ( Dont worry about video quality or protection from the elements or actions, everybody loves cracked screens)4. Lets not forget hes also an expert quantitative and value trader. He can tell you when it people will dump for “profit taking” With all of these, you are probably asking yourself, gee, Craig must be a millionaire by now just trading GoPro! We will have to ask him. Craig?"
I have a feeling this is going to be the US stock of the year

Apple just announced a monitor with 6k resolution. Now all the world needs is an action camera that shoots 6k video...
The potential for GPRO is enormous. A short squeeze is always possible and usually inevitable especially when there is such a high short position as in the case of GPRO. But what will eventually move the stock higher is the fact that GPRO is here to stay. They are well positioned in the market worldwide and are considered a market leader with excellent products. The stock price at this level should be considered as a strong buy. GPRO products are selling very well. There is no doubt that other companies with synergies are looking at buying GPRO and you can bet your bottom dollar they will be taken over and bought at a much higher stock price than it is today. GPRO is a strong buy with great upside and very little…if any downside. GPRO is the stock to buy.
Hoping for some big news this week from Gopro mgmt
"Here comes the bottom is in crowd, we are closing green today. You do realize this GPRO was $12 not long ago. Why is this camera company a turnaround story. It's not and the stock price is telling you that. Every short term rally is sold. Lower highs and lower lows. There were places selling the Hero 5 for $250 over the holidays.That is a pretty hefty discount. Woodman hasn't had a successful product launch since the Hero 4. Stock is oversold so a bounce would not be a surprise. Any bounce or short term rally will be sold. This company is done with Woodman as their CEO."
"Do GoPro trolls have feelings? Take your emotions out of your pretend GoPro investor game, troll."

Bottom now in for next leg UP...confirmed.
"GoPro Planning To Re-Release Karma Drone Before Holiday Season. :: On Benzinga.If things go smooth, Gopro should see a good upside during christmas or new years."
"Very interesting movement, gopro usually goes down when there is no news at all"
here comes 7.7-7.8
Thinking about getting in but 2 things worry me. What is the magnitude of the lawsuits against this company and has it gone to trial yet? Is there any risk of this company running out of cash in the next year if they have a bad Holiday season?
Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? go to (http://Pick-stocks.com).
I predict $20.00 or better before earnings. This jewel is on the move.
"No more free advice SHORTY,until the GOPRO  BOOM. Any day , until then ... GL GOPRO LONGS STAY STRONG and green.Aloha"
Could someone please tell me who these A-holes are. Gopro is making money but they can't let that go. so they now want $520.53 million for Q4 when Gopro is looking between $460-$480 for Q4. Who are these people. Someone Please. I'm sick and tired of them all.
Private equity acquisition by Bernie Madoff and Bernie Ebbers!
"I remember when GPRO was in the $60s and people were ""loading up the truck."" They make a nice camera but let's be real... that's not a multi-Billion dollar company. They're king of a niche market but that's all. In the past I was short on GPRO and I was long for a while. Now I keep away from this stock."
"Every day is getting more destroyed , by no apparently reason = gopro stock"
When you look at their 5 year chart it literally looks like the Enron ride! https://youtu.be/KPsj0oOJB24
Bought more at 8.54 and more at 8.45 now lets see what happens
"GoPro Max was sold out at my local Bestbuy. I think this camera will be a hit. Not that it will turn the company around, but can buy it time to get their act together. The products are the best they've ever had. But the action cam market is limited. They need to enter new markets with new products. It's worth a gamble at current share price."
"well, 12$++ easy"
green
Hero5 is unbelievably good. The prototypes have worked out faster and better than expected in the 2016 Olympic game!The drone launch will stage soon! The October's earning and revenue numbers should be able to support $26 to $32 per share with guidance raise and buy-out speculation!The stock price should head up for $20 a share! The pull back is done!
I feel so lucky that I took loss @something around 60.it was big loss but now 4 ??
Is it just me or is Motley Fool spewing garbage everyday on GPRO. Seems odd. Nothing has changed and yet they keep talking. Its as if they are related to shorts...
BANK OF AMERICA initiates Buy rating on GoPRO with target 24
9.00 limit order filled. I had to double on this sell off. Surprised really. Tuesday was obviously short covering. Hopefully longs will come back soon.
Horror show.
"I'm just here looking at these comments waiting on the next quarter reports to come out and see these haters magically disappear from the message board, seriously guys every comment is about too much competition or this company has a better drone but GoPro has just beaten estimates for the third time in a row making all of your remarks invalid. If you can't see a pattern of growth for the company maybe the next release of reports will prove otherwise."
"DJI is having their tech event soon. Apple September 10 will make those that believe the camera on a smartphone is a GoPro threat...sell. iPhone 11 is all about the new camera. New DJI Action cameras coming right on the heels(as they did to GoPro with karma launch)of GoPro 8 announcement. DJI launching a few new devices in September. Long term I am a GoPro loyal but in the short term, I intend to trade the stock weekly. Perfect swing trade!"
Now primed forMEGA run-up
All the bears went back to their caves
"With GoPros move to sell the Hero9 for $350 with sub, they have officially went all in on selling most of their products on their own website as ones selling at Best Buy are the $450 version only."
Anyone else about to double down on todays breakout? If the SP500 is bullish gopro is breaking out technically.. hard.. golden cross
1 Year Chart:Reverse Head/Shoulders =BULLISH!
"where is the market pulse, this is bs"
"Cool stuff happening at Gopro - they're attacking international markets, optimizing their product/supply chain/inventory management, building lifetime value through trade up and annual subscriptions programs. Mismanagement, botched launches, burned retail, doom, and gloom is already priced in the stock. People learn from their mistakes and improve (some take more kicks than others) and this optimization will be reflected in the stock price. Gopro isnt going anywhere. Millenials and next-gen love travel, adrenaline, and showing their adventures on instagram= growth. If anything, a tech giant will acquire Gopro for their tech, brand, smart employees, and patents. Buy the fear."
It is nice to see they are finally monetizing content. That will grow exponentially over the next few years.
"GoPro Inc. said Monday it will begin production in Mexico of U.S.-bound cameras in June, with sales beginning in the third quarter. The announcement comes after the action-camera maker said in December that it was moving production of all U.S.-bound cameras out of China to avoid potential tariffs. The company said it will maintain production of non-U.S. bound cameras in China. ""As stated previously, our decision to move most of our U.S. bound production to Mexico supports our goal to insulate us against possible tariffs as well as recognize some cost savings and efficiencies,"" said GoPro Chief Financial Officer Brian McGee. GoPro's stock was unchanged in morning trade. It has run up 51.2% year to date, while the S&P 500 has gained 12.5%."

So JBL is one of APPLES and this APPLE/JBL DEAL could be great for GOPRO. APPLE WANTS GOPRO TECH
So here we go total units of caameras old in the whole 2017 is 2942(000) and in 2018 until now is 2924(000) and craig still think they didnt do well. lol you need to dig into numbers. i can give you more reasons to buy this stock now. lol
Over all the market has punished GoPro but who cares about price at this point since GoPro turn profitable and with app Monetization and then content I can see 3 billion revenue in next few years with 40% plus margins meaning even if GoPro makes 10% net income would be 300 million with which it can retire 50% stock and then do splits like Intel did many years ago. Hey any one bought Intel at 42$ when I said to buy ? Or Mu at 28$ or appl at 145$ or PMT at 15$ ?
What a pos stock
"To everybody who bought between March and November and held on to this stock, congratulations. Looks like GPRO finally broke through the $9 resistance. With no bad news or market does not crash, it may reach $10.50 before EOY.Cheers."
"Craig, sometimes I post to share information and let others, such as yourself, digest then interpret the information. After all, in theory, this is a place to come, learn, and become a wiser investor. While in most cases that doesn't pan out, I liken it to gold mining, where once and a while a nugget comes to the surface.However, since you asked, my take is that I have no take. While I like that Woodman predicted decent earning more than a month before the release, there are still too many unanswered questions such as international sales, future plans, company morale, the recent firings, etc. With that many variables and a CEO with failing credibility, I'm happy to sit on the bench and avoid the splinters until such time I feel confident to get back into the game."
"Based on the leaked photos of Hero6, the cat is out of the bag. I dont see them waiting another week for Hero6 release. I think there will be an announcement this Monday"
The Deal is Happening !!!!
I'm surprised and happy . At last it did Break Even for me and beyond.
So reading woodman quotes at CES: “happy with sales in q4” .. “ o boogeyman” and the company projected profitability in 2019. May get to 7 share after earnings .. 35-40 percent upside to 10 percent down??? 4.90-5.10 is a good enter point imo
"Translation of the New York Post/MarketWatch article:Woody is trying to get the best price for the company, but his current ask is not being accepted - for now. ""He's a complicated guy"". Obviously, negotiations are ongoing.This company is going to be sold."
"In addition to the cool new features, don't forget overseas potential! If GoPro can fix their inventory/ supply chain issues with GoPro 6, Fusion and the drone , it would easily be valued $18 plus in my opinion."
GPRO #1 Zachs growth stock...Google it.

"Funny, google clips still has not been released, sad cause I already sold my 5 Gopros, just waiting to pull the trigger, https://store.google.com/us/product/google_clips?hl=en-US"
"Turning point for GOPRO. The massive reduction in OPEX of over 100m moves OPEX to revenue to near 26%. The change to direct sales model, takes pressure off of inventory write downs. The firing of VP of products Danny Coster makes way for younger innovating leadership, thus, new product such as Zeus. Outside agitators is showing how to unlock shareholder value. Finally, the stock will reach it’s potential. A lean profitable business, leads to buyout. Stock on the way to $12 and buyout $20."
what happened to gpro today
someone owns 30% of B shares they could make a play for the A shares to win the 51%
Korr acquisitions group may be interested here? They delivered a letter to Woodman.
Another 5% drop tomorrow and I'm out of this stock.
RSI now at 25.Time to BUY & COVER!!
"When companies express interest in buyout the price shoots up and then drifts downward until an official announcement is made, which usually takes a few months to materialize post rumor of “interest” vs rumor of “offer”."
Are we going up in the green? lets do this
THANK YOU JESUS. THANK YOU JESUS. YOU ARE A WONDERFUL GOD.
"I own a lot of GPRO stock, but I hope this thing drops to hell. These two talking are #$%$ bozos. Plus what I lose will be peanuts to Woodman?s millions of shares. That will be the ultimate win, watching him GoBroke. I?ve never seen a more incompetent CEO. ?Pricing yourself out of Q4?? How is that an excuse for a consumer company? 2 years ago they had all the manufacturing problems, delays, recalls etc... this guy has had plenty of shots to fix the company. He is just an incompetent CEO. This company could probably do well if it switched leadership and focused on VR technology and smaller wearable cameras. Unfortunately we won?t see that. Woodman is too arrogant to step down and majority board member. The only consolation prize will be watching him make himself go bankrupt."
"here starts the climb leading up to earnings. hope.... yes Craig, I hope it holds."
Sarwar...did your pom poms get coronavirus?
"at least we are not down by >4% like other tech stocks, I'll take that."
"FUSION = 2018 Cash Cow. 360 is VR is the future and GoPro is the biggest mainstream player in this space. Sure it will not (maybe ever) replace the flatscreen as it will take the masses to fully adopt another entertainment medium but for the market that the fusion market will hit, it will be millions. Not only for professionals, action sports, adventurers, but your everyday family that wants to record memories and want to re-live it fully immersed in the future. Can you imagine a baby's first walk and bing ""in the room"" all over again? Or a wedding? GOPRO LONG & STRONG!!! Load up 14+ after Q4 reports."

"the Management sold 6,5Million Stocks, the last half year. This Stock is anything for shorties, you can be sure the Management is also short because always bad news are coming the last few weeks and if the Stock want go up, bad news come again."
"Millennials like to travel.. If GoPro can get it together, this stock has a chance of making big returns. And if it fails and drops to 3 bucks, it is a risk I am interested in..."
"I have being looking the GOPRO VR videos, they are amazing I don't really care waht the shors and basher are saying aboutthis stock, I can tell you one thing It has a potential to skyrocket to 300...this is not a one trick pony, Car Dash Cam, Body cam, VR, Drone, Stabilizer, Cloud, etc, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKWWhf8RAV8"
"Good time to buy and take advantage of the big guys manipulating this stock for their own benefit as they do! Once GoPro starts showing profitability again, there will be no bargains like today's activity. Right now, a lot of people are just holding. Once trading volume increase it will not be so easily manipulated."
Looks like GPRO is finally getting the upward movement (when the rest of the market is down) that its earnings deserve.
Be prepared... gpro bankruptcy will be moved to Delaware (judges will be bought) licenses and preferential assets will be kept by a select few insiders / stock holders will be bagholders of a new pink sheet stock that gets delisted
Good time to short!
Gopro incredible stock movement ? Here we are again !! Manipulation is still attached to this stock like the little fish who follow the shark ! Sad . Hope in the earnings guys !
The extremely low volume in recent days verges in shocking.... it’s really dried up... we need a catalyst to ignite this thing.... with any bit of volume this will take off to the moon - easily to north of $15 and maybe even $20 if WSB gets involved again... thoughts?
I see leka stayed under the rock today.
Bank of America moves price target to $6.50.
"Wih tourism on the rebound, GoPro is sure to jump."
If GoPro shows signs of earnings beat this quarter I will be buying and adding more stocks every day or week. Just so Craig know .

"DJI UNCOVERS MASSIVE EMPLOYEE FRAUD SCHEMEJanuary 22, 2019 Sally French 5 News,Dronemaker DJI unearthed a massive case of employee fraud happening via an internal probe, in what could have cost the company up to 1 billion yuan ($150 million).Employees were inflating the cost of parts and materials for personal gain. DJI responded by firing a number of employees, alerting law enforcement, and also set up new internal channels for employees to submit confidential and anonymous reports relating to any violations of the company’s workplace conduct policies.DJI added in a statement that it not incur a full year loss in 2018.DJI discovered the employee fraud corruption via an internal probe and has fired at least some of the workers involved. According to Reuters, news of the massive embezzlement began on Friday when an internal document regarding the incident was shared on Chinese social media.DJI did not disclose how many employees were involved, but the Financial Times reported it could be as high as 29 employees.“DJI holds our employees to strict ethical standards and takes any violation of our code of conduct very seriously,” DJI said in a prepared statement. “DJI took swift action to address this issue, dismissed a number of employees who violated company policies, and contacted law enforcement officials. We continue to investigate the situation and are cooperating fully with law enforcement’s investigation.”DJI is far and away the world’s largest drone maker, making popular drones including the DJI Mavic Air, DJI Phantom and DJI Mavic Pro. The company employees about 14,000 people globally. The DJI market share is now at an estimated 74%, up from 72% in 2017, according to the 2018 Drone Market Sector Report by Skylogic Research.DJI is a privately held company and thus does not disclose its financials, but in 2018 was said to have a $15 billion valuation in light of discussions around a new round of funding that would have raised between $500 million and $1 billion. That would mark the biggest round ever raised by DJI, whose previous $75 million fundraising from Accel Partners in 2015 valued it at $10 billion.Share this:"

Woody is a funny guy! I truly hope it will hit $6.50. Give me more justification to SHORT the cr@p out of it.
GOLDEN LLAMA AWARDS TO ALL PUMPER LONGS
Stay away I did mistake I bought 2600 shares on 3.98 going to quick red zone with good news hahaha my bad luck
Definitely hedge funds at play.
"Why GPRO is going to knock one out of the park...Check out this retracement off the 13.40 high; supply (of stock) did not come into the market until after the retracement was well under way; 1/2 way down. These were weak hands selling today, Tuesday. Volume off the top would indicate an exit by large players which did not happen. Instead the big boys were buyers today....watch and see. They've manipulated it lower to buy and right before earnings release...ah huh. Not hard to figure out that the ER is going to be winner."
Gopro looks good. I expect it to hit $10 in the next 12-18 months. THey just need to keep building on their subs and get some killer apps.
Woodman should push teeth whitening gel on QVC. They’d move a lot of units.
"look at after market, up >1.2%"
"Im bullish and picked up some shares for a turnaround after 5 years..... However My daughter in her early 20's does not entertain or her friends of buying one. Ive asked them. My friends in their 30's and 40's do own them. And myself in my 50's think its too much a pain in the #$%$ to deal with another piece of machinery. That being said. I have been watching this stock since drones first came into play and AMBER and GPRO were fighting it out. AMBR has powered back.. GPRO has languished. My belief is, if they can pull off this qtr than two in a row in a strong market should see a nice run going into the next qtr earnings. It will be interesting to see how subscriptions come into play and the 130 Mill equity raise cleans up the balance sheet. That being saidWho is buying this product? Is it outside the USA? Whats the demographic?I still believe its a buyout when their blcn sheet improves."
now Nick merge with that company asap
we have a big short squeeze going on hold your shares and watch it blow past 16.00 jmho
2.5m volume in 7 minutes. Not bad...
I guess that new pick up I was going to buy on my Go Pro profits will have to wait ! That said I think that it will be in my driveway by next year!
5 Reasons GPRO is going back to $81. Most Importan -Membership program; 80% of the members got the service included for 1 year w the purchase of a device. It was actually cheaper to get the camara w the membership than w/o. This means no revenue has been collected & doubt most will actually pay for it when their trial is over. 2. 30X PE nothing else to say about this crazy valuation 3. Small Caps rallied hard and juice is about to run out (Rus 2K)4. GOPRO went public in 1993 and in all these years they still aren’t profitable. WHAT??? 5. The so called CEO just last week sold 200K shares or $2.5MM. Never a good sign when the captain of the boat sheds a significant percentage of his shares specially just a couple of week away from reporting earnings. Good luck if you are long not sure if this is just a broken company or a tragedy.
"I hope someone buys GoPro out , evidently they need a new CEO !"
Just bought back in 1000sh GOPRO.I’M BACK- BEACHES!!Let’s go GPRO APPLEsCALLING

Should I hold? Or is this gonna keep dropping?
"Hey, Woody!I'm sure we're all impressed with the videos of you out on the ocean surfing the waves, but but how about taking one of you looking like a CEO at your desk, working for the company's return to $90.00 per share!!The current price-per-share doesn't reflect the GoPro product, but does reflect the market's lack of confidence in the company's management team.For ALL our sakes - get off the surfboard and return to the office, or step aside and let a qualified and effective CEO take the reins of GoPro, Dude. For all our sakes, Woody - get off the surfboard and/or step aside and let an EFFECTIVE CEO take the reins, Dude!!"
Please someone buy this company
"The problem with GoPro is NOT the GoPro camera --- it's undeniably the ineffective GoPro MANAGEMENT. THAT is obvious.Either merge or sell the GoPro company, or bring in a more proficient management team, and you'll see the GoPro PPS rise substantially."
$5.50 by EOD
GPRO is up 5.36% to 5.50
"For last year and first half of this year, GoPro survived without any new product (I'm not really counting Omni and other accessories as new products). Now they have two new products, and one of them was not able to meet the demand because it was way beyond the management's expectation. There is no way that this company is not making profits nowadays. The major owner of this stock is Vanguard's, and they are not selling any of their stocks, and neither am I."
Guys this stock went down more than 90% later is gonna hit $2
GoPro is up 10.82% to 9.16
why we tank today?
GoPro! GoPro! GoPro! Blast off time!!!
will Institutions buy 70-80% of GoPro now ? Will the shorts really get burned? Just wondering how those shorts have positions at 4$ will be feeling now . Keep buying we need to be at 15$ soon.
"New products not available at stores yet.The ceo spent to much time with his head in the clouds among other places! Making appearances in shark tank, etc. Comes out makes a demonstration of the new gadgets just to miss availability dates? Bad too that he is both ceo and chair of the company. Need to separate those right away."
"Fight from bottom back to the top, dont tell me this is not a good stock. GO GPRO!!!!!"
Saw the beat and decided to check out go pro. Looking at the analysis page it suggest eps of .26 for 2019. Are they not expected to earn money for the rest of the year?
Let the class actions and downgraded begin!
Where is all the Long?
The products are out and reviews are excellent; the drop from $5 was absolute retail irrational panic...we missed nothing of the holiday season. The top days that people buy holiday gifts are Black Friday and Cyber Monday...there's still plenty of time for consumers to build up their Gopro holiday wish lists after seeing all the awesome reviews. The company is back on track and turning around. l wouldnt be surprised if we see multi-year highs from here! Sky is the limit!Excellent recent interview with the CEO:https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/The-Future-of-GoPro-A-Conversation-With-Founder-CEO-Nick-Woodman-561181251.html

I'm a new stocks trader. I see that GoPro stocks are going up I'm seriously considering buying $500 worth of GoPro Stocks. Any advice? I know for sure that GoPro is only going up. I'm a skydiver and a motorcyclists and both communities wouldn't choose any other sport camera than GoPro. Just a thought.
Anyone hear about guidance for next qtr
BIG POS
"Here there are many who do not understand how the market works, if the company gets bad results they hate it, if it gets good results they cry with joy, they want to get rich in a short time. DEDICATE TO ANOTHER THING !!"
Feels Good to BUY.
"If it is true that the new camera will be able to live stream, i hope they showcase that by doing the launch event filmed with go pro's live streamed through facebook and other SM outlets. Would be a nice immediate showing the technology"
"Ah, there we go - now the world makes sense again. I knew that GoNo would not stay above $7 for more than a moment."
"Wow, positive news for a change! Now if GoPro could just find a new CEO..."
Any news?
"Has anyone noticed the sarcastic similarities between posters like Tee, Adam and others to Craig Classic??As I said....""A Craig by any other name makes me laugh""."
"Slow climb back up, oversold on some news - new GoPro and app/editing will do well"
GoPro lol
Buy GoPro! Support American products!
"I bought Gopro because I like the product that same as a Fitbit. What I have since discovered is that it is hard to be a one product company. I should have learned a lesson from my own business - be diverse. As soon as your hot product cools off your in trouble. I held Fitbit waiting for someone to acquire it to add it to its offerings - which did happen with Google. Unfortunately, they paid a very low price for a company with no debt. Gopro is being held for same reason - but at current price it may not fetch more than one times sales which would be $7 a share. If they are sold. If not, it would take a big change to move this stock"
Whatever happened to Yi and Xaiomi?? Weren’t they supposed to destroy GoPro? I guess they missed one important thing consumers want. They weren’t GOPROs.
Funny true story -- 4/17/2019 - why did GoPro stock go down over 4% ? Some rich billionaire wanted a 4% discount from his stockbroker -- it should be 100% illegal trading.
"Extra, extra, read all about it here:Gopro has a cult following, me being one of them. I have the H3B, and when the H4B was released, i bought another one, why?! As i began to learn how to edit and create short vidoes, i began to see opportunities to catch other angles at the same time. So i purchased the H4B, and still there are additional opportunities for more angles that look great, now i have the H5B, so now when i go snowboarding, i have one on my helmit, one on the front of the board facing up at me, and one on my gopro stick in my hand catching a wider view of me and a group of friends. All different shots to make for a great video project. The karma gives an additional angle to add in, diversifying my video like I diversify my stocks. The truth is H4B is still a competitive camera today, two years later, in terms of overall quality, durability and specs. And us followers would have waited longerfor a new gopro to be released, because we know what we are getting. And once one follower gets the new one, all followers need it like sweettooth's crave sugar. Patience fellow investors, patience"
"Markets up huge, so of course GoPro is down..."
Im going to say it. Been thinking about it awhile now. Here it goes:
Shorts appear to be covering en masse. I wonder why?
About to bounce offLOD/Support yet again
GPRO DIRT CHEAP.VALUE & GROWTH PLAY...FORWARD PEUNDER 10...AMAZING!
$7.50 by EOD
GPRO is not even trading at one times revenue. They still have positive equity. What am I missing? I know Nick recently sold some shares. There have been some price point debacles with various launches and drones not working correctly but why would this be trading at such a ridiculous low?
"I would not be surprised if we hit +20% at the end of the day. Massive and final historical squeeze on the GoPro shorts. The game is over, go find another stock to manipulate boys."
I wonder who is buying... Insiders trading?
Is it gonna go and hold above 9.50 this time?
"Ahmed-Taylor Linked in Profile : I have worked at four startups (one went public, the other three were acquired), and at large media and consumer electronic companies.

Does these few pennies drop force you to think to sell your GOPro position ? If so please don’t waste your time and sell it. It’s time to buy as it’s undervalued . Time to average again .

Reddit chatting up gpro
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-tries-subscription-angle-132100152.html
Between REELSTEADY AND GPRO this team will ROCK with NEW PRODUCTS.
"DJJ spark & Motley fool. While the Spark is an interesting drone it seems more suitable to indoor pics and video. It's size and weight will be affected by wind. Even its product description qualifies its performance with ""no wind"". No 4K video with spark. Don't get me wrong, DJJ is out smarting and working harder at pushing the boundaries harder than GoPro but this is by no means a Karma killer. As I have said a number of times, GoPro must innovate and start being more features to its products to keep up with competition."
Anyone here own a GoPro Fusion? Anyone mount it on a drone? If so please provide a link to an online video so we can see some real world usage/footage. Thanks!
ER Warning takes this in $4-$5 any day now.
"Prediction: No company will buy GPRO with Surfer Dude as CEO. He is at best, dead wood. In the near future, he will step down to make way for the future. Stock should pop maybe $1., then continue to go down."
Hey Nick maybe you can go on Shark Tank and get a $5 million loan for 1/4 of your company.
"I would rather get the session for $199 than the clip, no competition to Hero6"
This stock should be heading back up in the next few days.

"GoPro Possible Buyers 2Amazon (AMZN) might be interested to buy GoPro:GoPro action or motion camera can be used as personal camera. There are more than 7,594,000,000 people in the world.If every family own one GoPro Action or Motion camera, you can count how much money GoPro can make. Amazon know that.GoPro Action or Motion camera can be used by transportation tools (Air Plane, Ship, Bus, Truck, satellite). Any GoPro camera can take pictures and store the images in cloud storage system. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the powerful Cloud Computing Service in the world.

I am surprised to see Verizon is selling Gopro Cameras.https://www.verizonwireless.com/accessories/photography/Is this a new marketing strategy with wireless cameras ? Not sure when did it start? Any one has knowledge of this sales venue for Gopro ?

"When a pps drops by 10% on a single day with NO NEGATIVE NEWS from the company or any other source, as was the case wih GoPro's pps earlier this week, it usually merely signifies market manipulation, and a buying opportunity rather than any problems with the stock."
Broader market roaring back. Last chance to buy GPRO at deep discount.

Who might acquire GPRO.....https://investorplace.com/2019/11/5-beaten-up-stocks-to-buy-that-could-be-saved-by-an-acquisition/
hero 7 silver and white are NOT selling.. massive inventory issue.. gopro AGAIN has confused their product line..
GoPro will soon come with a 5G enabled action Cam . DJI will burn cash in this niche Market. And things are not pretty good for DJI already as they face tarriffs plus there video stabilization is not even close to gopros . My assessment so far is DJI will fail to penetrate the action market with there OSMO action and will burn a lot of cash.
still believe a halt is coming soon to report some news
"I specifically like FUSION product line. Never mind, the 699 price. Not many choices in 360 views...Will be basis for future VR/AR, immersive video.More than Apple, eventually FB will be a buyer of Gpro with its Occulus line of products.(the yahoo news article says Apple should be interested in as gpro complements the watches)."

InstaGram and Snap is the next on social media list but GoPro relevance doesn’t end there . Look at fusion for google street views. Then we have AR and VR space . Things look pretty good to me from now on. I don’t really care if the stock price goes down or up for a day or few.

"To all GoPro LONGS wishing all of you Happy Holidays. To all the GOPRO shorts , bears , sloths and especially the GoPro Trolls this says it all."
"Gopro has a potential double bottom chart forming. To complete the chart traders would target 6.40 based on the height of the chart. In hindsight that's why GoPro started to explode after the ER. But the steam has cooled off and gopro was unable to ""breakout"". If you're holding gopro and wondering why your down. It's because traders were trading gopro based on the 6 month chart and not investing. It appears traders are slowly giving up on the potential breakout to 6.40 (the height of the double bottom is about 0.80). Traders are constantly moving and thats why I believe GoPro is bleeding out again."
What’s gonna happen when Q4 results are announced and forecast and more products line up announced ? Guess what ? Shorts are gonna get burned hahahahaha
I am hoping to see 7.40 within 3 weeks. I am not sure though if they will make it there. This might be a gamble that did not pay off.
This will go back to $15+ by friday

"Huge gap in the spread this morning. Bid 4.56/3 and asks way up at 5.95. Smart decision by GoPro to make an effort to leverage IP by expanding to different markets without taking on the balance sheet risk. Ideally, this is how the Drone should have been executed also."
"GoPro will not be able to ""fix"" the Karma issue in time to get product to stores for holiday season. No one in their right mind will buy Karma until they establish that the issues have been fixed. GoPro headed to $5.00 very soon."

"I remember how Garmin got beat up from high $60 all the way down to $24 when the mapping business heated up in huge competition. Today it is back over its high since $24. If GoPro keeps on its good cost management, inventory control and great price on all its quality cameras, we can easily back up to its IPO cost again which is around $25."

Congrats to longs that held in there. I traded a few times and completely bailed at 4.40. Just when I was done with Woodman big dreams and small reality he may have just delivered. Good trade turned good investment it seems. I still fear the drop of Osmo Action 2 so I won’t be going long again. Nice ride. DJI new action cams will be a real competitor. Good luck!

If GPRO just sold out all inventory and stopped selling product as well as laying off 95% of employees they could just get royalty revenue on their patents right? THey could probably get a very high PE multiple and likely be worth much more right?
AAPL should buy them.

Apple is cutting on Q1 . Just shocked to see how experienced corporations are doing lately and we sitting here blaming GoPro . Craig see bro .
David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital just disclosed a 1.017 million share long position in GPRO. These guys play as a team and quietly help each other get on board before lighting the rocket. Then when GPRO triples out of the blue they will blame a Reddit message board and not manipulation of a few billionaires in cahoots.
every stock is red but not Gpro:)
Anyone buying hoping for an acquisition?
"It will be red for today but green again early next week...the earnings report was actually awesome. So they missed by a bit, no big deal for a super company selling the best cameras ever!"
I think the stock is going up because of the new subscription business that is straight of profit if you break the camera u pay 20 percent so if it’s a GoPro hero 6 it’s 80 I don’t think they will lose money 80 it’s probably what it costs to make a gopro
"GoPro shorts PAY UP by WEDNESDAY Thursday will be that SQUEEZE, you know the one that F$#KSYOUUP and sends you out of GoPro and back to school. HAHA IN YOUR FACE CRAIG THE GOPRO TROLL YOU PATHETIC teeny tiny speck you get more SLAPS THURSDAY"
Your insane if you think this company is going out of business. Many companies try to create their own action camera but GoPro still out performs every one of them. GoPro has built a huge name for themselves that now when majority of people see an action camera they assume it is a GoPro. This company is going no where any time soon. Bears go back to your caves and stay there.
"Ship it!!! It’s awesome how much the stock fell since announcing the production delay. Now, we are shipping and we are green not even 5%. This is all manipulation, no one is actually trading on fundamentals. It’s hunting season, and bears are on the menu."
Anyone make any bets on this one today?
GPRO 12mth total return negative 39% however woodman says quote “puts us right where we wanted to be”
"1/4 OF FLOAT IS SHORT WAKE UP PEOPLE. I'm long for life either way, but just know you're possibly the greatest short squeeze in history. Oh and let's not forget the daily rip/saw action. And you tell me, who the hell else is selling cameras? It's either professional photographers using $5,000-$10,000 pieces of equipment. #2 selling drone, rapid global growth, constant GPRO plus revenue stream. Back up the truck folks."
Anybody aware as to why there’s barely any volume on GoPro options?
Personally think shorts (33% of float short) gonna come to the realization quickly not as bad and gloomy as made out to be and when this doesn't go down that much tomorrow they will be supporting the price in here as they buy to begin exiting their short positions.
"This used to be very sought out, just like TSLA today."
ok we are ready to take off :)
Wow! That's a huge beat plus guidance raised in future quarter. This will close above $10 tomorrow and looks even more like a acquisition target while under $5B market cap. I know social media companies are looking for hardware companies to integrate into their platforms so my guess would be Facebook.
"Everyone is buying GoPros with the Trump checks, so this thing will fly!"

buy an iphone put a base and have a better camera on a phone
Mega SHORT SQUEEZEbeen predicting ...before AND after bell.
I think we all have seen the manipulation. Friday like many other days the stock popped and the short funds came in to push it down thus increasing their short positions. When enough continuous buying comes in they will loose that power to stop a rally.
"Got in at 10.46 hoping for a positive outcome. Still in it, holding the bag now."
"I think we may well find a buyer here.With the market cap this low. A well established brand name, we are foolish to think JPM will not be getting serious calls.. Shorts will say otherwise, but I think there are huge companies out there that would be discussing this at some point.."
"I remember when this was $80 a share and I thought, wow when this implodes it will be epic but i never thought it would be on it's way to less than $1....but here it is! everyone that wants one has one. Their total addressable market are customers that own one now"
"So let the bidding begin. Predicting the only firms willing to take a chance on such a small market are current competitors that want to build a brand in the US and have a low cost of production. Thus Yi and Yuneec would be my first choices, followed by DJI."
"It's not really green, because this is just the usual market manipulation, meaning that it isn't going up based on anything other than non-material factors. Now there will be profit taking, and it will plunge to new lows, then go up another .40 and then plunge again...only Leka doesn't understand that nothing has changed with the fundamentals. Dead company. Ride these waves, if you can/dare."
Should I buy before ER or after ER?

Shorts adding up their losses. Lol
justmoi predicted $8.88 at week's close. Called longs fools that don't know how to invest. Let's see who will be closer to hitting their target at day's end.
Recently Apple announced iPhone 11 and tried to sell it based on its camera features rather than any other feature . What’s the take away. More competition for GoPro but at the same time Apple has an assessment of this growing market and they want a piece of this market just like they wanted in car. Now we have to ask ourselves what can GOPro do to defend itself ? Well when some one attack your fortress you don’t wait for the past hour to defend . GoPro management must realize this new threat and leap into apples own fortress as I suggested earlier last year to start producing cellular cameras to integrate the whole community into its ecosystem. Not easy but no worth it . It must start thinking like a diversified company rather than just media company . You can leap into other industries if you have the right approach but I know investors will doubt once again if they try. I m still bullish on GoPro as I didn’t see any significant change and a lot of GoPro videos now surfacing on you tube meaning they are on the verge of monetizing content very soon. Best of luck both shorts and longs. But there is not much down side to this company . Just be patient .
Hi !Can anyone suggest what seems to be the target for one year horizon on this stock ?
"Near the end of 2017 I had a few thousand bucks just sitting in my investment account, so I decided to toss it at GoPro in hopes that it might have good sales from that holiday season. That was probably the worst investment decision I have ever made. I am just glad that I did not have more money available at the time or else I may have bought more of this dead horse. At this point it could drop all the way to $0, which it likely is going to, and it will not even make a blip on my overall portfolio. Suffice it to say, I don't make random purchases like that anymore. And I also investigate companies' CEOs a little before investing in them. Had I known what an idiot Woodhead was back then I would never have bought this stock."
"Just in this morning, latest short numbers. Yikes! Short interest at this pps remains super high. I am never one to ignor large short interest as they collectively know something (and have been more right than longs). I thought I'd add a substantial position down here in the $4s but I'm not a buyer. IF (and a big IF) there is a partner or buyer then there's rocket fuel. But if not, it's going to be a slow and painful death downward IMHO."
BestBuy and GoPro offer free battery (worth $99) with karma purchase. Super nice deal. Offer ends October 30th.Q4 is going to be big ... pushing karma.
New spherical camera for GoPro announced. Fusion. It's going to be tested by pros this year. Release late 2017.
SHorts will be like .. what $8 bucks Huh How.... soon ...
Woot thank God I bought some puts yesterday. Rode it up and on the way down thankful I didnt get rid of them today.
"I see Craig (Mr. Short) is back on the board. Hey Craig, as I said a few days ago ""Per their presentation at the Citi Global Technology Conference a few days ago, GoPro reconfirmed their expectation for continued growth and profitability for 2019 3rd & 4th Quarters and into the future. Over the last few few weeks large institutions have increased their holdings, while at the same time short interest has decreased. Anyone currently holding GoPro stock is a fool if they sell today at this current low stock price.""Maybe it's time for Craig to realize that this not a good time to be short on GoPro."
Short interest of 30%
Closing green today
I think the buyout price is at $52 so my millenial brother can break even ;)
"shorts will try to bury this right away, but they will be slaughtered...just look at the blocks being bought."
$5 stock?
NoGo today.
Shorts - Are you covering?
when does Gopro release earnings
This all goes back to Woodman. Wall St still doesn’t trust him. We’ll see in the coming months. Dead money for the short/mid term.
https://www.technowize.com/three-ai-powered-companies-that-will-transform-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence/
Went to Best Buy and Fusion was discounted-selling same as Hero 7. Fusion display was replaced by DJI Maverick video. Gopro must be selling Fusion inventory making room for Fusion II. What thoughts do you have about product refresh. It seems that Woodman is very confident these days.
"Where does this company advertise? I never see an ad anywhere. Maybe print but not tv. If they could just get out there and show what their products are capable of, it would make a big impact. look at Apple. They’re constantly advertising. Yeah I know it costs money but cmon."
nick admit it before you go under merge with someone else! You do not have much more time!
You have been had if you think gopro owns the market. There are so many other cameras out there that people use.
Whats interesting is that After Hours is actually down after the PR... probably people jumping hoping Karma was going to have a sooner release date or a more firm date...
"if you see the dates this was downgraded, it's like to easy to say this could be green. and sales are just perfect. I think even with today's gains it's still at a low"
of course i buy 3k shares and it tanks.
It's time to short! Be sub $7 by eom. Mark my words!!!
"GPRO has made a new low every year since it's IPO, quite an achievement in a bull market. Watch it rollover tomorrow. Price point for their cameras will continue to drop. This company is toast in a couple of years. Hard to believe this went public @24 in 2015."
three dolla hollah
...the tailspin only intensifies at GPRO. It is just too bad that some stocks are so damaged that very little to nothing can inspire confidence in their viability.
"I was going to buy Gopro when it hit 10 points.... I missed out, regretted it, then got caught up with real lift stuff, was going to buy again if he continued to go lower to 9.... Glad I didn't buy anything yet."
I believe GoPro is paving the way for a hybrid hero and fusion camera . Let’s see what’s on the table .
WSB heads. Google GoPro Short interest! Crazyyyyyy shorted.
"This is how it works. Stock is at the bottom and reports an unexpected positive surprise. It caught the brokerages who hated the stock by surprise. So they walk it down on big volume so they could shake out the weak hands. A few days later, we see an upgrade with a higher price target AFTER they have accumulated. This time it is the weak handed shorts that will fuel the fire."
Looks like GPRO will be disclosing financial info tomorrow. I’m betting they will be raising guidance.
Bankruptcy filing looming?
SHORT INTEREST.....>>>>>>>>>>
"About 6 years ago, GPRO was new and they had thoughts of being a media company. That did not work out so they pivoted to drones. Their drone products were slow to market and were outdone by others. Now they are out of drones, what is their next move? Sadly, I think this is the end of the line for GPRO. Surfer Dude went as far as he could with the idea. The stock will grind lower until the company is sold."
52 week low. All time low. It's now time to worry about BK
Boom goes GoPro. Maybe 11+ by 2/2
Buyout? Apple is in line
at almost 14 million shares shorted the short position was 43% of total volume.
"GoPro is a screaming buy here. DJI will do 1 one Billion in revenue this year. It has a market cap of 10 Billion. GoPro 2.2 market cap and will do 1.8 Billion in revenue 2017. You can buy a turnaround Tech company with a awesome BRAND that has just changed it's business model in a massive way. AMZN has Prime $99 dollar a year. GoPro is now offering GPRO Plus subscription Cloud for $59.88 year. People, this is very big. This makes it so easy now to share/edit your experience with everyone. They solved their software problem. Do not under estimate this. New Drone, new Hero5(Hero4 2 years old) Tons of upgrades. Then you start getting recurring revenue from the $59.88 1-10 million subscriptions. Do the math, recurring revenue with high profit margins, nice! Why is it up again today? The big money knows what I know. This is a massive turn around tech company that has just changed it's business model in a big way. You can buy a tech company for ONLY 1.2X revenue. If DJI was public you would be buying it at 10X revenue. This folks I have to say is a NO Brainer. You are getting massive value here. 1.7 million drones in 2018. Exploding market and now GoPro will take 20-30%. with a BRAND everyone knows."
What's the movement about?
$7 is coming very soon if not today by Friday for sure way to sheap
Tenor Capital Mgt has significantly increasedownership stake of GPRO in most recent quarter--burgeoninggreater bullish enthusiasm for the stock at its currentlydiscounted PPS.Important to note!
100 off hero 6.
"I will take it all day long. Up 3% with the NASDAQ down on 8 straight sessions. I like the COO quotes in the PR release. They have this thing turning around IMO. Going to take time. Patience to be rewarded nicely. Going to be a long, hot summer for the shorts..."
Check this out. Bullish!https://youtu.be/NcNl237RKnQ
Boo yah! Told y’all 10 this week. Now Cramer even on board.. hold if you got them.. shorts will crying tomorrow ..
In at 4.20. Bounce back to 5.00.
"People complaining about lack of follow me, seriously try using it on the phantom and see how useful it is really is... not much. More like an invitation to hit a tree. Karma wins this holiday hands down, expect to see sellouts."
"10 M of share and it fall down 0,20 ahhahhah i really do not understand how long i must wait until reach 14$"
cramer told me GPRO is a turn around story about 4 weeks ago.
Reality check.
Look at Intel/Amd/Nvidia ALL 3 STOCKS GREEN TODAY JUST LIKE I SAID IN PREVIOUS POST. CASH THAT MONEY BABY!
jbl and gopro
"Craig couldn't afford cable tv. I told him Karma was flying live feeds over Pipeline on the North Shore. He demanded a link HERES YOUR LINK ""CRAIG THE GOPRO TROLL"""
"GoPro and Snap, put yourself in a dancing hotdog suit while you ride the wave!"
Im liking the movement keep it up.
Let’s get this on WSB?

I dk why I am not worried about this price decline. It takes an organized investor to make money and form IBM I learned how warren didn’t loose money .
Why does this stock always goes down every time they come out with a new product?. can anyone explain?
GPRO is up 6.04% to 4.04
no resistance lol... going down like a #$%$
Sorry guys but every time I buy a stock it goes down I just bought me go pro and all ready went down .11 in minutes so so sorry
I would like to see Apple buy this company out.
Lets go 10$
"For sure, somebody knows something...but certainly not anyone who has posted on this board recently."
Lots of capital is in tech FANG stocks today. It will flow back to GoPro and push it 10.3 and close at 10.2 on Monday.
"I had been watching GoPro hover around $8 per share for the past years, with a couple of spikes in that timeframe. When I dipped down to $7.50 I decided to throw a little money into it - fortunately very little. Now I am hoping for a new company to acquire it, but if not then I will bail out at $5.50. There is no way this stock is coming back up given how clueless about the situation the CEO seems to be."
"I keep GPRO in my portfolio as a reminder. When you think a stock has bottomed, it can always go lower and lower and lower. I brought into the hype after the IPO, purchased more shares to average my total cost down and those shares are nowhere near $45 per share years later."
Short!!!
"Why every time the market crashes in a big way, Gopro stays untouched? For all the calamity this stock goes through, in these moments it shrugs it off and goes up. How come?"
Maybe just a little sprout
Any takeovers proposed???It's been what? 3 weeks
Run Shorty ruuuuunnnnn
David Einhorn is adding more GoPro shares: David Einhorn’s Greenlight CapitalNotable Q1 Buys/Increases:GoPro Inc (NASDAQ: GPRO)
anybody have any insight on today's move?
"I think the only thing keeping this company alive is their name . GoPro is a great name , but when you have to spend 500.00 for a mini camera that is kind of a pain to use and You have to swap out batteries and memory cards and attachments... and this is all they have to offer since they quit selling drones"
Institutions selling before earnings so at end of day they could buy all the shares back for cheaper. Textbook
This jewel is going to $20.00 before earnings. THANK YOU JESUS. GO GO GPRO.
Woodman is telling investors and analysts at CES that GRPO is NOT for sale. That is why the stock traded lower yesterday and is indicated lower today. He needs to be kicked out.
"DJI was supposed to start shipping the Mavic on the 15th, there has been no indication that any units have gone out yet. It appears they did their product release right after GoPro's and put a release date ahead of the Karma but never had the ability to actually hit that date. Once Karma releases and people have still not gotten their Mavic, we might see some conversions. Also Karma will be in stores before the Mavic will so that could help as well."
"The hallmark of this stock remains the same. Huge drops followed by little or no recovery. If Woodman can't find a buyer or won't sell, this company is done."
"I am thinking GoPro shares are halted after closing. We all start crying because once again, they disappoint. But wait, GoPro receives buyout bid from DJI for $7.95 per share. BOOOM! Finally a good hold!"
"Cassandra/Craig: I guess you'll have to go find a different ""funeral"" to attend to."
oooooo up a penny
Reaching $7 tomorrow! Buy Now!!!
Sounds like mike works for or has a vested interest in DJI
"I think this article will give investors something to consider. It isn't saying NOT to invest, but it will give you something to think about for the long term. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-fusion-camera-gopro-inc-173103689.html"
Buy buy buy
Hero6 is now #1 BEST SELLER in action cameras on Amazon. https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Sports-Action-Video-Cameras/zgbs/electronics/7161074011
Upgrades coming.Great CITI reception.
Just bought in 4K at 5.56
I'm still down. Need 9 to break even.
Higher highs...Higher lows...Headed much higher!
I just added more share. This was expected I was tell you all from January
To be honest I think GoPro is going up from here. They had a rough period with product mishaps and delays but it seems with new products and a good CES with hot new products it seems a good time to get in.
What’s the reason for the skyrocket?
"Millennials like to tell stories...GoPro helps them do that....top recognized brand, Hero 6 coming, should be a strong close to 2017 for GoPro and its share holders."
The funny thing is a bunch of the GME Reddit people are doing silly things and filming themselves wit a GPRO doing it. I really like this stock. I think they will too soon.
"GoPro Possible Buyers 4Apple (AAPL) might be interested to buy GoPro:Apple and GoPro has some similar camera interests. GoPro even hired Apple core designer Daniel Coster.Integrate GoPro products with Apple products, it will extend Apple's business."
Is there a reason GPRO does not pursue the law enforcement body camera market. They should seek a cloud service to partner with. Then soar to the moon...
"GoPro should roll out some package  for cloud along with upgrades for one million independent truckers alone in America who drive semi trucks . GoPro shoulda also make it viable for them to save their video on the go becoming a security camera . Enhancing features and cloud would help GoPro to secure the more than 500 million $ market . Along the way GoPro can start working on autonomous vehicles and radars . I truly expect this move from Nick now . Come one nick do it now . It’s the best time to have an agreement with intel for their mobile Eye chips . This is going to be a huge market for GoPro . GoPro will not only be a streaming company but a recording , security. Autonomous vehicle company after that move . Let’s do this together nick ."
GOPRO GOOO HIGH HIGH HIGH
Here we go - after hours announcement has GPRO plummeting. This stock cannot stand a little success. I’m finally above sea level on this thing and am ready to just dump it.
WHAT??? I don get it. Why are we down with positive results? WTH???
Perfectly timed for the sale announcement...friday ..don't be short
$11 today and $17 by friday.
"GoPro has three upcoming events - November 30 (NASDAQ 35th Investor Program), December 5 (Raymond James' Technology Investors Conference), and December 7 (Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference). Whoever the GoPro representative is, he will hopefully offer insight into the present and future. I recognize Woodman's credibility has plummeted, but nevertheless he will have to answer questions."
predictions for December? mines sitting at around $18
Don't worry Nick will buy another yacht despite all time lows on the stock.
Cause of rise: Seeking Alpha is writing about unconfirmed buyout at $14.
"Check gopro website, Fusion ship date is Dec 7 now for those in line. I ordered mine immediately after seeing this. For those that got in early, ship date was early November. All signs looking good thus far. Does not seem like Gopro will meet demand for the holiday season with this camera, they said in earnings call they are ok with this. This demand should transfer to Q1 2018 after all the reviews are out on youtube and the rest of the film making population understand what this camera can do. Im going to blab here, if fusion is successful, it will get a custom GP2 chip in 2 years. Also ordered a Hero 6 yesterday, $1200 this year going to gopro from one customer. Im sure there are many like me out there."
platmying with house's money yet?....except for the shorts who though this now profitable company was headed to zero.....lol
"Woodman, basically said, we sold all our old inventory very cheap, now we'll buy it all back from you to get you into a newer model...WOW! What a great business mind........and how is this generating profit? I mean, thanks for the $100 dollar trade-up gift,I'll take it because I wasn't using the old one anyway. And now, I just got a new one for $100 bucks cheaper..If your going to take a hit on the product, just put the dang things on sale for a month or two, $100 off, for everyone to purchase!!! My friend is #$%$ he can't get $100 off, so he bought the competitor....."
NAKD is next
7(s) today
GPRO short term target: $12GPRO long term target: $30
"I've learned a valuable lesson today... come to this board without signing in so I can see everything posted by Craig and JustMoi given I have them both on ignore... chuckle a bit... then give my 2 cents. After all, I do need some entertainment.First, to address all the negative comments. Craig has actually made a few good points. 2017 is a very instrumental year for GPRO in terms of cash. However, given the 15% cut in workforce and removal of dead businesses causing them to return to core businesses -- combined with the news today... well seems we are headed in the right direction. To what Mark said, year over year, revenues continue to climb. This is meaningless if expenses grow faster than revenues -- so now they need to manage growth and continue to develop new innovative products to keep the markets humming.A few asked how JustMoi came up with 4.74 -- He did pick something near half... but did no math. Given the keystrokes are near one another, it makes for an easy lie. Normally I wouldn't be so rude -- but JustMoi... provide some basis or seriously shut the f up. A chart, graph or anything that supports anything coming out of your fingers. Even if you're shorting, you can't be drinking your own Koolaid. I think all of us here, even those holding the stock are open to real information of which you are providing ZERO. But for those who may be new or impressionable, I always urge you to listen to none of us and look at the facts.Now on to technicals... About 6.5M shares by 8:20am PST. We are looking at a 10M+ day. A week or two ago I mentioned candlesticks... well here you go. As Mark stated, holding above 10 today would be a great sign and as he also stated, some of this is institutional trading. I found his comment to Craig a bit funny about Level 2. I'm guessing he is googling it right now to figure out what that even means. There will probably be some piggyback news in the next day or two to keep the run going.Honestly today the news was not that substantial -- in my opinion. However, it is moving the market significantly and as I've stated prior, this will cause an overreaction with a short squeeze. My word of caution is beware of the 2nd candlestick, especially if it is down. As always, take 30 minutes and study the annual chart as well as the 3 and 6 month charts. History has a way of repeating itself.I think we might see a small bump or even on 2/2 -- I don't see us revisiting the low 9s anytime soon. I know... facts. Well, sales, even without the Karma, were much better than expected and are suggesting year over year growth of 30%. This will be tempered by write downs, which is why I don't think it will bump as much as it otherwise would. However they are decreasing operating expenses moving forward. Unfortunately that won't be reflected until Q1 2017. Above everything else, they need to provide an executable and attainable plan. Under commit and over perform.Good luck to all those holding."
"It always impresses me when people just write without knowing or understanding the products, competitors, the facts, and without using logic or their brains. Here is why Karma offers more value than other drones for less:"
"I have owned a couple golows, but the 8 is a huge upgrade...they will be in a better position than previous quarters. No pain no gain baby! I love a comeback story!"
Tempted to buy
Let's start with what went wrongNo lets start with what went right
looks like the market didn't like the layoffs
"What’s the news, buyout @ $12,17,21????"
i still have some shares i bought at 22 dollars long time ago :) still holding!!!
"Everyone who wanted out is out, only us bag holders left, willing to gamble and go for a ride, dont get in unless your willing to lose"
It's time to buy this stock! https://seekingalpha.com/article/4240547-gopro-offers-incredible-value-heading-profitable-2019
Adding more shares 310 in cash rn
Apple will buy GoPro and the cameras will sync with your iwatch. Should sell for about $1.5 - $2.0 Billion valuation.
Buy before close
Luvin those $3 PUTs I bought 6 months ago
"Ooh god, When will merger happen?"
"Wedbush ups price target 50%, from 8 to 12. Stock price promptly drops 20%. Must be looking for some underwriting business."
Looking like $6-$8 ++ PPS
technical trading to 7.5 by EOM worse case. IMO
"curious. do u guys see a post after steves, from a person named bowman? I flagged it as spam. wondering if it deletes it from just my thread or everyones"
"Share to Instagram, uhhh. Whoopie dooo, still a POS"
Who else is expecting dilution or a warning ahead of earnings? Their cash position is down substantially YoY and they need capital to fund product shipments / R&D
Back up prob due to raised outlook
Sell Time!
any news why we are down 8% premarket ?
I am wondering why GoPro just don’t release a camera with sim port the cell version just like iPhones . Would be a great product .
GoPro lifted to strong buy at Zacks.
GPRO please don't disappoint. 4k at 11.50 just filled. Knocked it out of the park with AAPL yesterday so going to gamble hard core today. LET IT RIDE I suppose you can say.
come on FLASH CRASH ... take her down
The slow climb has started!!! Not long on GOPRO but be assured that we'll see $8+ again before buyout. Load and Hold!
Is this not a HAPPY DAY for GPRO Investors. Great Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Matter of fact Institutions now own 43% which means 2% up from last quarter. Buy the dips before this stock is 10+. Q1 2019 and then no more 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 only 10+."
"Today will be another great day to get into GoPro. Yes I am a shareholder, average price 6.10. woodman is no CEO, he knows, we know. This has been his biggest mistake - he should never taken up the CEO role, he should kept it to CMO (play around, enjoy life, let his company grow and keep doing crazy stuff to build the brand). GoPro is a great brand with great distribution (you see it really everywhere, go to Asia it is at every mall, airport, etc.). Read the book: how brands grow, key to growth is brand and distribution. GoPro will be taken over sooner than later and mark my words it will not be one of the Top A players (Apple, Amazon etc - no relevance to existing business) also not of the B Players (Sony, Garmin) - they don't have the marketing talent or stomach for it, they wouldn't know what to with such a youngster brand. I mean when was the last thing you saw something great from Sony after PlayStation or Garmin… cant even recall? Who needs a top class brand and distribution.. yes the Chinese they have they hardware, what they don't have is brand and distribution. I hope JP Morgan brought in some of their Asian talent into the deal team….."
"next stop is 6.00 by friday, after retestesting the low at 5.04"
GPRO is up 8.96% to 2.19
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 8.92
GoPro is up 11.20% to 10.07
"the layoffs means 3 things1. The missed 4qt estimates, 1st qt guidance by a mile2. They will announce no Karma 2 and getting out of the Drone business3. They are prepping the company for s buyout, maybe DJI? makes sense with all the discounts in the 4th qt trying to prop up revenue for a sale, regardless of margins.I still think #1 is the most likely scenario but imo #3 is more likely than ever"
Guys Get out now this is $2 believe me
Anyone else hearingBUYOUT? Bottom fishing now underway.
Eargerly waiting for buyout news
@sam do you have lot of put calls
https://www.google.com/amp/s/monreport.com/2019/01/09/gopro-inc-gpro-valuation-appears-to-be-a-smart-buy/amp/Is this what we call financial analysis ? When the stock goes up then valuation looks attractive and if it goes down a little then it does not . I mean what is wrong here I mean I don’t trust these guys most of them for analysis.
this is it for gopro...
gopro gets bought $10/share
"I just read some DJI MAVIC reviews on the best buys website. People although not many say that the camera on the Gopro is far superior, I believe that this could be a strong selling point. I would give up some features for a superior image quality. I'm really curious to see what happens."
Bargain price will not last...watch it rocket UP
watch for pulm reversal
"Looking good! Finishing near HOD, the gains are holding up nicely! Weak hands wont fall for S/T price slide down anymore!"
"With GoPro having improved its operations and income, the GoPro PPS will again turn on a dime (as it did on Friday), and we'll be seeing even more of the ""retail trading crowd"" become Gorpro shareholders in the not-too-distant future. This is just a ""trading see-saw"" at the present time, and is nothing to do with GoPro as a company."
98 high - 3.24 low price best sales in history you do the math
I think someone is covering their shorts You don’t have to be rocket scientist to figure out who’s covering
Very active to deleted messages do some home work
Out of stock Karma with Gopro6 on the best buy close to my house
GPRO has the makings of a ringer going into the quarterly report only a week away. The turnaround has passed the midpoint and the quarter is looking good. +12% short interest in this “attack the short” market could lead to unbelievable gains.
New camera comes with 60 fps ! Big big improvement from 30 fps!
"Thank you Google for cheap shares, loaded up more.Most likely Clip will be a flop (but let’s assume it will not) it is and will not be a competitor to GoPro at all. People who use Gopros will not even consider buying something like this cause it will not get the job done."
"""We are right where we want to be""- Nick Woodman. Translation, I got rich off the IPO, sold a lot of shares with my early lock-up date in 2014. Shareholders well not so much but congrats to the shorts. Remember we are GoPro, not GoBroke."
Why would any of you sell now that the company is profitable??
YOLOOOOOOO to the moon
Check out TheDailyWoo on Youtube. Drone crash video
West Coast BUYS...about to hit SOON
i hate this stock so much whh am i even invested :(
"As a former short, I love to check back into this board around earnings. There always a new die hard fan that thinks they have found the bottom, that magic moment other investors missed. They eventually scamper away never to be heard from again. TWTR turned out to be a disappointing investment but GPRO takes the cake for one of the worst IPO's I have ever seen run by one of the worst CEO's ever."
"When Gpro couldn't hold $15 repeatedly, I knew there was a problem. Woodman appears inept at handling the company he started. This stock is a shorts dream come true. Maybe Nick should give another vague interview on CNBC and tell everyone how it's going to be a Gopro Christmas. He seems clueless."
Anyone else see a middle finger emerging on today's chart?
Anyone think it will break $10 tomorrow?
well I sold all my shares moving on to Microsoft
go go gopro
gopro will be back past 6 in no time. buy low!!! youll thank me later
Let's get some mentions on Reddit !If any of you GPRO longs have Reddit accounts you might want to start mentioning GPRO on their WSB board. Let's get north of 500 mentions so the community starts looking at this undervalued stock...
GPro must have known the delay way before yesterday afternoon. These are the same people who said last ER that the 2nd half of the year would be a lot better too.I guess they were hoping announcing new products would offset the drop in stock price? lol
similar chart as radioshack
Told ya folks. Under 5 here we come
The next is $10.00 a share. The next is $15.00 per share. At $20.00 it will linger for a while.
"There is a chance it will rise 10% in the premarket tomorrow, right?"
https://www.facebook.com/131043201847/posts/10156161099716848/These are the rules to remember. Don’t get trapped by brokers or speculators .
I think very soon GoPro will receive one or more upgrades from analysts and this will lead to 6.5+ USD
"something is quite fishy here.. only one hold when they released the q4 data and no noise since then. Good or bad, i hope this will be around 8 9 this week"
buy out coming soon
Back to under $5 soon.
https://normanweekly.com/sir-capital-management-lp-has-trimmed-parsley-energy-pe-position-gopro-gpro-has-1-8-sentiment/Another report for Bears to see The lowest analyst price is 6$ and the highest 19$ very low risk and high return situation. as per these prices we have a 22% down side while we have 146% upside. which one will you choose?
Today was what I was looking for. Covered this morning. This IPO was done to enrich Woodman and his family. He should have taken a pay cut two years ago. Now he is desperate to sell and the market knows it. Woodman clearly is not qualified to run a public company. One bad decision after another because of his giant ego. All this company has now is a Hero camera and based on Christmas sales that isn't worth a lot.
"I got back in. I dont think things are going very well, but I am willing to ride the wave."
Wow this thing is still dropping? Woodman needs to leave. He is destroying this company. Feel bad for the longs here.
"Jbrad: Here is how you cite a source with facts. HERE IS WHO IS GETTING LET GO FROM GOPRO NOW: This article states that the VR division is GONE, and there are new cuts to PR, marketing, sales, and that the video editing team is gone too. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2017/03/15/troubled-gopro-deepens-layoffs-eliminating-positions-in-media-and-virtual-reality-divisions/#23002d434632"
"MASSIVE LAYOFFS do not = a strong quarterly path to financial stability. There is barely anyone left to lay off. This is called ""smoke and mirrors."" Let's see GPRO do it without layoffs."
Yeah right! Every one one here is iOS in deep
I am in with $25K. It’s oversold and undervalued
The deal is happening!!!
"All this company needs is better administrative leadership. It's all very well knowing how to invent a superior product, but knowing how that product should be marketed is what makes a company successful. GoPro has the product, and that's great, but what the company needs is effective executive leadership."
GoPro is expected to release a new Hero6 camera this year and a 360-degree Fusion camera in 2018.GoPro (GPRO) is no longer on death watch.
"over now, get out before it is bk"
How To Make Money in the Stock Market.Don't take these Yahoo message board posts seriously - and certainly don't let them influence your investment decisions.
"me being an idiot sold it at wrong time and bought at wrong time now i ended up losing $$, wonder if I should just bail or wait until tomorrow.. it keeps going down now damn it lol"
should I avg down now? my is at $8.
Yeah this one’s done...go to $GPRO.
Two weeks ago I put in a great deal of money and a grow pro thinking it would do well over Christmas now you got a recall I should've just threw my money out the window very extremely disappointed
what the hey it's up...
Very bullish.
buyout?
Y’all should have taken profit today
Craig many of my friends are waiting for this smaller cost camera which they want to use for practice games recording etc. in such use cases they don’t need any 4K or so. this will slowly create lot of use cases you just see.
next stop sink-o-ville lol told you it will sink today. sold mine yesterday
#$%$ Nick? Where are you? What is going on? You are killing those who had faith in you.
Bought a Hero 7 Black last week. First gopro. Have to say I might send it back. I wanted to like it. I believed some hype of the Image stabilization. I have just had many glitches. Went on gopro and reddit forums and i am not alone. Maybe i expected to much. Wanted it as an extra vlogging cam. You just have to fiddle with so much. Audio was set to auto and cut half my voice off until i switched to stereo setting. anything beyond iso 800 is not usable. only can do 4k with the fisheye fov. low light is terrible. color and stabilization only works well in really good light. maybe i was expecting too much from this little thing. but going by the number or returns people report. this seems not to be just my issue. so far it seems like gopro is just giving anyone who complains a new unit. maybe there was a manufacturing issue with earlier units. yes i have manually updated firmware!
should see bounce to 5.35
To all the fathers out there have a Happy Father's Day.
Be smart and buy now
selling will dry up soon enough
"Own 5000 shares at $22.50 and 2,000 shares at $9 over the years. Will keep holding till it gets to $48."
"Anybody hear of ""Follow me"" function may be added to Karma in a up coming firmware update? That would be great."
Is this the next Game Stop?
They need to innovate. They need to incorporate night vision into their cameras. I know fishermen would love it especially if they could squeeze it into a small package at an affordable price.
"As you know, this company is doing very well --- see the PRICE!"
This stock is the ultimate. It supposedly beats by 0.02c and managed to shed 14% after hours. Even good news struggles at gpro.
"company and product are fine however, in order to attract new investors Nicholas must convert his prefer stock to common stock , he knows it but yet insist to hold its control through the prefer stock, once he does will see GPRO at $15 , try guys to convince"
Motley big pump article after a bear article Monday after ER. They must think it’s bottomed
"Was expecting over $6 since it beat earning. Don't get the love they deserve. Anyway, I will keep all my 30,000 shares till it gets to $25!"
"I'm calling AT LEAST $10.00 per share, come Christmas."
Profits are ....
GoPro can barely get any launch right. This year all North American production has been moved from China to Mexico. GoPro made this move in June. That’s the delay. Such a huge shift in production of the tech they are selling takes a lot more time. Then there will be quality issues as hero 8 is the first camera to roll off new line. Even Apple and Samsung struggle with such changes. What a mess. New management long over due.
still going down? interesting
Thanks Wooddick. Soon this will be below $1.
So glad I got out of this stock a while back made my losses back elsewhere in a couple months!
I believe there's something positive going on here really. Even the options are saying so.
Up 40% off lows a few days ago. Congrats.
Any idea why its moving so much today? Is it just residual from the upgrade and increased guidance?
"Whoa, what's going on here ... down almost 25%"

I think I'm just going to stop looking at the stock until the new year and hope for the best. The drop is making me sad.
"Losing track of lawsuits. Is it the same lawsuit with reminders posted on yahoo finance everyday or are there new lawsuits being filed? Despite all the lawsuits, bad news and eroding fundamentals, the stock is showing a floor around 9ish. Is this bottom and relaunch of Karma Drone will skyrocket this stock or will it become target of short sellers starting in the new year?"
History has repeatedly shown that any time this stock has seen any kind of momentum Nick winds up kicking it in the nuts.
Over-priced in the 4s should and will trade sub-1 dollar
I looked at the Best Buy web-site and they also have Karma's available.
$4.50 by Friday?
Added today at 7.86. Hopefully a market correction will happen soon and back to the 5.00s for more buying. 3 insiders are selling. Manipulation...again!
Since 12 noon last Thursday (5-2) this stock has gone from $5.60 to $6.20 at close today. Up 10.7%. My guess is info has leaked out about first quarter results.
The shorts needs to short this or find your self losing the price to 8.70$.
GPRO is up 4.97% to 4.97
No one believed when i said to buy at 4$ but those who did are sitting on 50%+ gains now while shorts gets squeezed i would be watching this historic short squeeze from my phone or computer. comment or like if you would watch it too :)
RedPro
DJI launching new tech in May. Mavic Air confirmed. Osmo Action2 due as DJI launches every other year. GoPro needs to innovate. This one trick pony won’t last. Trade it but don’t invest. GPRO very predictable trade. All hope lost in hands of current management. It’s a real shame as so much has gone into the GoPro brand. Good luck!
Will GPRO get back to 60-65 range again?

"bankruptcy for real, he fukked everyone who bought this POS"

Fusion will sell.
Some just bought 800k GoPro stocks
"Lowering cost bases I’m transferring my 370 shares of gopro to Robinhood! ! i bought Microsoft stock at 66 bucks! micron at 30 bucks! Alexion pharmaceuticals at 98 bucks! I was up 1,300 bucks on gopro one time so craig please I’m a better investor than u I just started at 15 u can’t messs with me old men"
"Lol 3 dolla after earnings , which eventually didn’t happen and what happened was upgrade to earnings and revenue for 4th quarter. What I think is going on is revenue is diversifying lately and yes it doesn’t include advertising revenue which will be generated from users of GoPro app which is easy and very powerful toll to create stories. I believe GoPro app will compete head to head with SNAP. Best of luck Longs."
52 week low. Get out now. This company cannot even turn a profit and has been RED for months.
"Good news, gang - it is up .04 in after-hours trading! $90 here we come...or not."
I’m at school doing credit appeal
@Craig why do you want to comment on every post? I appreciate your time on this blog but not all the information you provide is also true. I know you make money if this stock go down for that please provide your analysis but you cannt keep hurting all others.
"Nick's credibility is at stake: he is probably not first to be wrong... we have seen him wrong several times.However, partnership will get better brains than him. At least he seems to indicate he is willing to collaborate with someone.What? Possibilities:In-car camera monitoring, given uber and lyft popularity? Gopro waiting for existing inventory to clear out to come out with some news.Probably, on a new product in partnership with someone on existing inventory to clear out.Plays into subscription focus and given gopro expertise could do well with ai for movement.If those are not true and it is just pure gas out of Woodman, then this stock does not deserve to exist. Let them go bankrupt.But given that Nick has publicly indicated so, once after ER and more recently and then probably in a week, he might be prosecuted if there is no proper followup."
Does anyone on here think they could beat their estimates for Q2 and revise higher?
"Okay. I really think this is unfair. Yes, this company wasn't able to meet the demand of their products, failed to meet the due dates, and had a little issue with Amazon and all that. But GoPro doesn't deserve this kind of treatment in the stock world. Patience is a virtue, and seems like many people investing in GoPro have no virtue."
Shorts are getting destroyed in this market. Look at what happened over at GME and DDD. Any reasonable announcement and we could be at 20 as quick as DDD went from 10 to 30. They had a higher short ratio so that is why I say 20
Is there earring today after market .???
best bet by Friday morning at open it is around $15.25...
"Whoa, a heavy hitter just invested. THIS IS NOT THE END folks. GPRO will climb again to at least $10-11 before a drastic sell. That or major re-structuring. Let's not forget the international market, particularly China. Hero6 killed it in sales. Prediction is Gpro will beat Q4 earnings then we'll see. I'm no longer a long on this company but can't deny there is at least a trading opportunity here. $6??? I'm loading up! Buy low sell high... GPRO still has another run in it... Down but not out. Buy opportunity."
bought 2000 at $8.10

Mark this post. GoBroke will NEVER have a green day with Nick Wooddick at the helm!
Did they not beat expectations?
"Wish I could buy more here at 5.30. Inventory isn't that great, but for a beat this good, GoPro should be going much higher that 3% tomorrow."
"Interesting that JP Morgan Chase and Co just issued a Form SC13g (as required by the SEC) stating that on Dec 31st, they purchased more than 5% of GoPro stock. Does anyone have any thought on this activity?"
"Just my opinion: A. First, new app for non hero users, 2nd, new sun glasses that look almost identical to snap ( I received my sunglasses yesterday, and 3rd, future release of camera sunglasses. Result, more users, subscription and hardware sales. If this happens going to be big, very big."
Looks a lot like a company stripping down to fit a buyer

"LOL...Great earnings report and up close to nothing AH. Not sure what else can move this thing. I got in a 5.10 yesterday and will hold for a little bit, but man, thought this thing would popped at least 10% on that report."
What the hell does today's press release mean?
I cant decide weather to hold Thru ER. Honestly it could seriously go either way. Part of me feels like the karma release statement indicates an EPS miss in an effort to keep things postive
"Wait until tomorrow morning. Sky works just reported a great Q and it's down after hours. Have to look at the volume, but I believe shorts are covering and bidding down the price. Tomorrow, with a higher/normal volume, this will take off. IMO."
Why?
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 5.80
"Price actually just made a new 52 week high and hasnt been this high since mid 2017. If earnings and forecast are positive, this could continue to trend much higher. Resistence probably in the $16 range"
"Can we just let this stock stay between $5-$8 plz, I like the consistent income."
"based on my past experience selling on amazon, using the number of ratings per product, one can roughly estimate how many units sold, although it can vary alot depending on the quality if a product (bad reviews more common) using a .2% review rate, i estimate the followinghero 5: 700 reviews @$300 = 350k units = $105 millionhero 6: 155 reviews @$500 = 78k units= $40 millionhero 5 session: 349 ratings @$200 = $24 millionsession: 857 ratings @$149 = $64 millionkarma hero 5: 150 ratings @$899 = $68 millionkarma hero 6: 25 rating @$999 =$13 millionkarma grip: 109 ratings @$300 =$16 milliontotal roughly 330 millionwithout counting accessories, older hero cameras, plus subs , might be a chance for a $500 million q4. time will tell hoping my numbers are on the low side."

For all you die hard longs. Hero 6 is currently the 4 best selling action camera on Amazon. Additionally it has the lowest ratings of any of the top 10 items in the category.

Turning GREEN...The news IS STRONG!
"For me looking at the charts of AMD and GPRO I can draw a lot of similarities both company's went through similar problems AMD had now made good and the share price is reflecting that, I see GoPro heading down the same road"

Hey, at least you are back to even on those 35000 shares you purchased @ $5.55.You are just a papertrader and just here to troll. Good thing too or you would have lost a lot of $$$."
GPRO owns 89% of the market and they cant make money. LOL. Dying market.
I'm still new to investing should I be worried about on there quarterly earnings for today.
LOSS NARROWS; BUYING FOR $14 TARGET!!
bet it hit 9 rather then 5
There is NO WAY the US will let a Chinese company buy a US Technology company. Not going to happen. They have made this clear and will use CFIUS to block any proposed transaction. Do not get caught up in the hype as people try to pump the stock a little to dump it and leave others holding the bag.
"I see Karma differently. To me it stands on its own, and let me tell you my thought process.....As a kid, I had a chance to get a action figure (Batman) vs. a transformer (Optimus prime), if I were to compare them, is that a fair comparison? Now, I absolutely loved Batman, had shirts, sheets, etc..., but, I chose a transformer, but why? It did something that the Batman action figure couldn't do, which is act as an action figure, but then transform into something else (a semi truck). Which meant, I could not only play with it as a robot, but then play with it as a truck, getting multiple uses as a kid out of it. Now, I take a look at the Karma, is there any other drone that I can get multiple uses from? Those uses being removing the durable camera and using it in air, water, land; then also being able to use it with a gimbal for professional like quality footage, as well as being attached to a drone for aerial footage. Now, is this a good comparison, I think so, is it a perfect comparison, probably not, but, there was a transformer that came along called Soundwave, in which, it could transform into a cassette player (not a real one), but also had a tape inside that came out and could also transform into a robot animal and played with on its own, which became one of my favorites. That said, is it fair to compare a transformer with a single use action figure??Karma is similar in that it has uses that I don't believe others have yet, and in my eyes, it is the transformer of the drone market, so is it fair to compare to other single use drones?? I believe it stands alone, and will attract consumers just because it has multiple uses. Or, maybe I am the only consumer who sees multi uses as a better option. But if I get another drone, which doesn't have a detachable camera, or a durable one, I also have to purchase a handheld gimbal and a durable, good quality camera; different brands potentially, research for best price vs. quality; price tag of approximately $400 extra if choosing knockoffs, more if preferring long lasting quality/durability. I was extremely disappointed in the recall, if it wasn't for that, we would be in a lot better shape. However, the potential is there because of multi use aspect that no one else has, all one brand, one stop shop, which makes up for some of the lack of capabilities of Karma. Am I way off the mark here??? Feedback/criticism welcomed."
"DONT SELL ANY SHARE UNDER 30 ! New Camera and new Drone will dominate the market. Plus, rumor AAPL and GOOGLE want to acquire GPRO for cheap 27 !!!"
Can you say JAGUAR? Well can you short trolls? Your more tiny...like shrimp 10+ by Fri.?!
This company is on life support. Only a management buyout and outright sale will resuscitate GPRO. Think Fitbit.
Nick Woodman is the Bernie Madoff of the camera biz.
Volume drying up... we will find out if share holders have conviction or not.
This is going to be the best earnings report ever. go go gpro. can't wait.
bought more at 8.38..hope this works
I was conservative.passed million sharesat 10:10...This is just the pre-game warmup.Take it to the bank!
What a great run up at the end of the day!!!!!
Watch Louis Rossman review of gopro on youtube....eviscerates them
Lowering price points and more competition = lowering margins. Forces higher production and sales more to hit revenue targets. You can't produce and sell more if you're laying off staff left and right. Does not compute.
"This is definitely a BUY opportunity. Let me explain why. GoPro underpromises. They are no longer that company builds a huge inventory, ends up with overstock and announces loss the following quarters. They want to be profitable , which requires them to be a little on the conservative end with inventory levels. Btw, they become profitable as we know. Cash flow is important. All the difference for 17 Q4 guidance is 50M (520-470). Now, GoPro beat estimations by approx. 20M in 17 Q3. And there is no question that the Q4 revenue will be higher than Q3. In a quarter where you have more sales, you have better chance to make up that 50M. I strongly believe they are underpromising. I expect them to hit 500M range in Q4, less cost , decent margins will result in solid EPS."
Just turned GREEN!
Buy out by years end
what's the reason for today's drop? i can't stand 5% drop for no reason any more.
"I promise you will double your earnings this year on AMD. They are a beast with new line of products. Gaming CPU lower price than Intel, Graphics card for bitcoin mining and general gaming all sold out, new product EPYC with massive gains in severs around the world. <---(Microsoft first customer) Lots of public releases and great CEO Lisa Su. Watch the stock if you interested. Best of luck in the future and hope one day you thank me for gains."
Below $1/share coming soon compliments of Nick Woodman.
"this stock keeps creeping higher. was in this and lost in dec. I think went from 5.50 to 4.40. I sold for 15% loss. now back to 6.44 high range for a while, buy at 6.35 limit, GTC."
Might be up 5% today
Hero 7 Black is the fastest selling GoPro...ever. That's impressive given the Hero 4 did phenomenally
Why not declare BK Woodman? 97 to 3 speaks for itself.
Put buy orders in the 2 buck chuck range. It will fill tomorrow
Low volume today ;P
Finally crossed my cost basis at 5.06 keep going gopro you can do it!
What price would you but for a short term trading opportunity?
Didnt think it would get back this low again. I see the volume picked up dramatically in the last hour. Something going on. Must be reports of slower sales or something?
Shorts will look like this today...
Buy shares now???Or option trade???
what is after hrs volume
How much market share does GoPro control?
Camera maker GoPro Inc would be able to import 31 types of camera accessories duty-free.That would help the bottom line.
"Buy at 50 cents, Yes it is going there in 2018."

"Look at those big institutional baggers, they won’t tell their investors how big loss they’ve suffered in this stock alone."

Patience is needed. They aren't going bankrupt. Coronavirus along with margin calls is giving us grief....along with the opportunity to snap up shares on the cheap.
Is 10.20 a buy point?
"http://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-gpro-strong-industry-solid-125412824.htmlGoPro (GPRO) looks like an interesting choice for investors, as it is seeing solid estimate revisions and belongs to a great industry."
oversold start buying now
I'm shocked so many people want to waste their time on this stock when there are so many better ones out there. Go ahead and dislike my post. You GPRO longs have dreams of making it big with this stock...your dreams will never be more than dreams. Go and buy some AAPL MSFT or NVDA. Those stocks will give you a thousand times more bang for your buck than a failure of a stock like this.
"Hey Woodman, I thought GoPro was a ""Media"" company? LOL"

Why did this go up recently?
Alot of talk about amazon but it seems no one is even mentioning the fact that gopro signed an exclusive relationship with india's largest electronics retailer mid year. I have a feeling thats going to bear major fruit in these next few earning cycles and provide some surprises. Thoughts anyone?
I say it tanks

WHEN IS APPLE BUYING GPRO?
hmm...ahhh..got no words for this stock.
"The psychology sorrounding this stock is unlike any other I've encountered in my recent memory over the past 20 years. So, it starts out with an obvious dead-cat like bounce. By the time it is 2-3 pm, like clock work, the dump begins and the holders can't get out of the way fast enough. Sometimes, with such a robust early bounce, the sell-off my set in early as the bag holders just don't believe this stock can hold on to any form of life. I've lost too much money to care. I will need 300% bounce to even get close! for me at this point, 10% bounce from a baseline of near zero is still zero..... Good luck trading today guys...."

Hey you all technical chart investors are going to raise prices to 8.70$ as it is about to cross 200 SMA it already did crossed 50 and 20 day SMA and is trending upward also earnings beat increased volume and better forecast. Keep the run going .

Lol  Shorts can’t get a break. They all work hard to say bad things....Apparently you guys don’t work hard enough.
Sad state of affairs for this company.
"Gopro products reviews are excellent. International demand and growth with the increase in travel. Current low market cap/buy out potential, Potential new product lines and SERVICES (which means RECURRENT REVENUE STREAM) in the works, product management optimization and execution enhancements. There are tons of of shorts on this - this is going to skyrocket"
for real this is my first day trading and i bought Gpro. what is happening?
"Lol, GoPro stock can't even get a market sell off right!"
Up Yuge tomorrow!

GOPRO mentioned on FOX NEWS last night in primetime. Fact!
Interesting....
One word SPARK. DJI's newest offering. GoPro is going to have it's handful trying to stay in the game. I fear GoPro does not have the chops to play in this very rapidly changing environment.
"Disclaimer: As I said before I do not plan to sell my shares until it reaches $14.Let's do the math: 1. Company has roughly $145M cash, which translates to $1 per share. It has long term debt of $80M, so in general 40 cents per share.2. It is already profitable, with closing this calendar year with on expected value of 4 cents per share. This is including the one time cost of restructuring with cost more than 45 cents per share and another 9 cents loss on Q2 which will be negated. All in all even without growth it is very reasonable to expect it finish 2018 with over $1.3B sales and 60 cents earnings. Add in your own growth projections.3. With an industry average P/E of 25 this already puts the stock to $15 per share + 40 cents net positive cash, so easily $15.40. This is from today's numbers with projections, with any kind of growth on sales it can even go higher.So, yeah I do not care if it is $9 today, $8 next week, $7.5 1 month later. If the market does not appreciate it now, it will 8-12 months down the road. I am patient, and I will wait for a breakthrough (if not somebody acquiring it earlier)."
tape camera on stick and you have GOBROKE. GOING TO ZERO.
"look at Q4 reporting around the industry. There is a very slim chance that they don't beat rev estimate of $373.61M (-29.3% Y/Y). EPS will be the big winner as they trimmed the white collar fat, introduced high margin cloud subscription revenue and increased direct to consumer ecom (higher margin) fulfillment."

"Unless they unveil something revolutionary this year and things head in an even slightly better direction, I think a buy out is best. They hold many valuable patents and licenses that companies like Apple or Garmin could want. Take Apple for example, they didn’t need to buy Beats by dre but they did to improve that niche market. Hopefully, they do the same with GoPro at $9+"

GoPro Upgraded by Vetr Inc. to Strong-Buy. $9.04https://baseballnewssource.com/markets/gopro-inc-nasdaqgpro-upgraded-by-vetr-inc-to-strong-buy/1227495.html
"OK so my thoughts. All of these people that surf, ski, boat, kayak, go on outdoor adventures, travel to foreign places , climb mountains have money. I'm a surfer and bought the original Go-pro many years ago, for me then it was to difficult to work the product and I couldn't be bothered with it. I gave it to my daughter she loved it. However it seems GPRO has finally simplified the whole ""capturing daily life experiences"" $1200 to me is nothing, along with the rest of the outdoor enthusiast if this works like I think it will. I have no grandchildren yet and have many years left, I'm 52 & am going to pick up the whole package."
Jesus said we'll see 3 before 3.50
should run a little before close
"go pro .everything for sell ,including woodman."
"This is a perfect stock, after eraning and mid term and long term, the vaccination has started, and soon a lot of ppl will want to explore/have fun/travel and ofc gopro is a top choice for that. So for all new Investors.... think more about who will buy it and why."
Great News - @CES Woody is announcing a new HERO 7 BLACK shaft to go right up investor rear ends!
"Man what is up with this stock in pre and post market every day, one share being traded back and forth basically at the same prices"
This will be $8+ before you know it.
Why I am not worried about the stock price ? We saw that GoPro made all time lows on March but since I said it will go back up some doubted it will be zero . Any ways why I think this stock price is short term is because shorts are just looking for any bad news to turn the uptrend but this ain’t happening . If you would have bought GoPro in March lows you already made 300% in just 6-8 months . Lucky you . I think GoPro is heading to 15 $ after Q4 . Keep buying
"The deal may not be completely dead, or else the stock would have plummeted faster and farther today with a lot more volume. Xiaomi may be posturing, low-balling, or whatever. Hopefully J.P. Morgan is still brokering the action. And hopefully, Nick understands (as Xiaomi does) this could be his last chance at saving his company."
GPRO starting to get on the radar with the WSB crew. They love sticking it to shorts and hedgies in stocks like this. Perfect candidate for WSB!
R.I.P GOPRO 2018.
people still buy these?
Companies don't go BK easily. It may take years for GPRO to degrade to the level that a company like AMBA takes them out in a mercy merger. Just the waiting for GPRO to complete hospice will only add more pain to longs. Everyone is underwater and will get more wet in the years ahead.
"Ok now Nick the rpick, now what?"
Any feedback on new Quik App performance?
stock peaked May 15th... happened to be the day DJI announced action camera..
S-Q-U-E-E-E-E-Z-E ! ! ! ! !
"@craig well why you're not tell us how can lose 0,43 point in just one day without any news , and just after a banker upgrade ? O well but as usual you will tell us that GoPro has no future and all your normal stuff , instead to admit that this is a huge market manipulation !"
"It's time to buy, there is strong demand for Karma."
Cover your short and go long. When GPRO turns it will move up fast. Back to 5.15 before a pause
Short positions up from 38 million shares to 39.715 million on Dec 31 2018. GoPro still registered positive return since start of this year . We will have to watch January 15 SEC filling of shorts are covering or still shorting 
"Sorry longs, the $199 camera is not good news for you."
RED LEKA. IT'S RED. BETTER COST AVERAGE AGAIN.
Management need to go
I think I will GoBroke with this stock.
$12 for SURE this year.... GoPro has hired JP Morgan to put itself up for sale.https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/08/gopro-has-hired-jp-morgan-to-put-itself-up-for-sale.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cheadline%7Cstory&par=yahoo&doc=104934026&yptr=yahoo
Buy out will be for $11.50
Since it was FB was the other bidder for fit and lost could they be after Gpro now?
what's moving it down today?
Thanks for selling 10 mil worth Nick. This stock will never sustain any momentum with Woodman doing this.
"I am telling you as a gpro shareholder, DJI will now become a player in handheld camera market.. micro gimbal and follow-me tech will lead the market.."
Power to the people! Let’s show these Hedge funds shorting this stock the losses they do richly deserve!
Hell Yeah!!! 11 Tomorrow!!!
"Bought 10k more shares today. Tail winds stimulus money, return to travel and opened economy. A full year of operational excellence will prove profitable growth."
"I’m so sad, I bought this stock around $90/share years back. Thinking of just selling it for a lost"
Apple plz buy GPRO!!! 
Moved most of my money to $AMD $RUBI $TLRA continue to hold on $GPRO and $SNAP. I am still holding a nice chunk on $ROKU since i got in the day of the IPO so
should go over 10 very fast
Nice reversal today in a down market and on volume perhaps to bottom is in? I think I said this before but who knows only Mr marketmaker!
Q4 is around the corner. Peak season for many platforms. E-Commerce etc.. I believe GoPro will beat the estimations. Both in Q3 and Q4! 5 quarters in a row!
5% per day up and up! I am totally Ok with this kind of growth.
"Good morning. Quick update. A couple days back both slow and fast stochistics crossed (%k, %d) signifying a change in direction (up). Also moving averages (10 and 50) crossed. RSI stable around 55-60. We had a bump in volume late yesterday in trading as well as one this morning for a total of about 750K shares between the 2 days. Would like to see 9s this week with volume moving towards 2M+ shares daily. Easily expecting $9.25 exit point (for me) before Thursday, but not set on if I will remove the sell and wait until Thursday day or sell prior. Earnings release s/b after hours. I would expect us in an oversold condition prior to earnings looking at 1 month or longer charts. That said, I think buying right now would be risky as we don't see the 9s frequently.Fundamentally speaking, the new COO seems to be on the right path to internal cleanup. Also I am a fan of the buyback program for a number of reasons as I've mentioned in prior posts. From a consumer perspective, it helps create more brand loyalty as they release new cameras. From a back office perspective, they can gauge the number of conversions from old to new in an effort to scale production accordingly before new product releases to avoid shortages or extreme overproduction. I also believe this can allow for a small bump in price-point as consumers will know they can upgrade at a discount going forward. Lastly, with the $175M lending, even though almost 80M of that was used for a private stock buyback, I think this provides some reassurance that this stock is worth at least 10s and more if and when they right the ship. Lenders would have been privy to forecasting models and estimates that none of us have seen as part of their diligence. For those interested who actually understand the benefits of charting and are frequent traders, I""m happy to share other stocks with buy and sell points. As I've always said, here to make money. Happy to discuss constructively -- that would leave out a select few :)Good luck to those holding. 9s soon."
GoPro post covid intrigues me.......
"I doubt GPRO went down today for the white Hero7. In all seriousness, the Hero7 is the absolute best product of its kind. On a podcast, a very affluent promoter of an entertainment company was bragging recently about how great the Hero7 is, and how there is nothing like it on the market today. I had to test it myself and oh my! Fantastic little machine. Any bump was recorded with an unbelievable smoothness! I had to get me some shares. Took advantage of the nice dip today to dip my feet in the water. I’m very impressed."
What's the catalyst here. I don't get it.
How can WOODMAN sell all those shares KNOWING that were was an EARNING MISS? SEC needs to look into this.
Lots of new faces on the board....stick around the party is just getting started
Hope the buyout is at least 58 bucks a share so I can break even. LOL
Bashers out in force.Bullish Signal to LONGS
Why the stock is halted?
Even at 50 cents per share GoPro is still over-valued. Woodman will destroy any value still left.
HOLD THE LINE!
What's the expectation for earnings? Is it on track to beat? Worthwhile purchase at this late stage or not?
"There's no doubt that GoPro has a quality product going forward. GoPro's management is another thing entirely. Change the management, and....Voila!"
gpro will be 15 by the end of this year
Shorts lining up to cover in final hour.Same pattern all week!
Google Clips is dead. Why compete with Gopro if you can just acquire Gopro at this valuation? https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20917386/google-clips-dead-discontinued-rip-camera-ai
"Follow Mode, Watch, Mutiple waypoints on Cable cam, and other updates coming to Karma on the 28th as well as ability to utilize Hero6! Update accidentally posted briefly on the site and was captured by a Support Community member."
With weekend comingand strong Q2 report(+news?!) just 5 tradingdays away...MANYindicators have started flashing GREEN/BUY...just in the past day or two. Not too late to reap reward bigly.
Bounce HAS begun
I am sure it’s just profit taking . They top rev .
"I'm going to be taking a bit of time away from this board. While I understand hopes and prayers, it doesn't move stock prices. Tomorrow we will open in the mid/low 9s. Yes, it will bump up. then it will go down. Back in the 3rd quarter we went from 13s to 10s with a close in the 11s. The stock proceeded to fall another $2.50 before recovering. While I don't believe that will occur here, we will probably retest the high 8s. As I've shared, my remaining shares are ap of $15.04. I will be working those down as opportunities present themselves and may average down once the price stabilizes. I think what annoys me the most about this board presently would be the number of people who's opinion changes with the wind. A number of posters had a lock on exceeding expectations and are now going ""oh yeah, I knew it was going to do this"". Yeah, no you didn't. Pick a side and own it. To those holding, well a bad day for us. To those shorting, nicely done. Good luck all."
Waiting for the bottom to buy
buying here...
This stock will not slow down until it hits $20.00. Then it will base before going foward.
"Bad news! If the Karma shutdown news had occurred last year, investors could have realized losses for tax year 2017. Too late now! Tax rates are lower so losses are valued less. Some of you are thinking you will hold until GPRO gets back to $10.50. Not going to happen."
Call Woody skeeedaddy! Bong hits and gnarly waves with a Hi5 sign!
Will be back in the green tomorrow
"So why does a tiny irrelevant GOPRO troll have to reply to each and every post jbrad posts? Because craig is ""A TROLL"" w/no GOPRO investment position. He's a scared GoPro short who won't take his own doom and gloom advice. Craig , your GOPRO drivel hasn't convinced any GOPRO LONGS here to even consider selling their GOPRO shares. You pathetic, haha can't even convince yourself to short GOPRO. Your a JOKE. Irrelevant trolls"
my prediction is $8/- by end of this year...is a buy now!
"@Leonardo: Apple buy: hurdle is Nick, he does not want to. He controls the board, sells at 98, then 9.3 and lets the stock tank and still does not want to sell to suitors. Apparently there is interest in some companies.Gpro is not as bad as @Craig makes it out. The decks are much cleared with DJI being banned and Fusion being interesting.However, the problem for Gopro stock is Nick! Longs have to pray he catches some disease on his asia trips..."
"Good coverage Market Realist...finally a article from an analyst without bias (Motley Fool) or in the case of Zack's just plan worthless. GoPro 5 silver best selling camera in US and Europe in Q4, GoPro 5 black second best selling camera in US/Europe during Q4 2016. Finally...accurate explanation of Karma...not meant to be the fastest drone, have the most features....it easy to use, takes the BEST VIDEO and has way more functionality than DJJ drone."
GoPro/APPLE BO?! Yes
why buy now if u can buy 6 box
"All GoPro needs is new leadership and management. We know it, Woody now knows it, and the market knows it. One way or another, it's going to happen. Hold."
"My sell order for my $12 call options didn't trigger, it would have around $13.75.... oh well. Maybe I'll be able to sell it when this thing is at $14 or $15.... keeping my fingers crossed that somewhere in the next 29 days we'll see higher and higher share prices!"
can't believe I bought back into gpro
Ska-weeeeze 'em!
Wonder ... you missed the 200% run up in the last few months... $4 to $12.... now that's funny...
GoPro mentioned on Fox News. Free publicity. Won’t save them much but the publicity is worth it.
GPRO reached a new All Time Low at 4.98
10.00 by January
"6.1 support is crucial. If it breaks, 5s for gopro.Btw, given Gopro deals with chinese companies for manufacturing. What effect will it have on the already thinning margins because of lowered prices?"
"It's just coiling, getting ready to spring upwards."
more down please so that I can buy more
GoPro Fusion -pretty cool  https://www.instagram.com/p/BX3-GRKAmXW/
The Result of Q2 might have missed analyst expectations but comparing them to last year results offer a promising return from losses to profits this year. Most of the time a share price is speculated by option sellers and I m sure that the price will be up in few weeks so I will start buying this now.
We need that break at 8.6$
We all received our email for the proxy vote. please vote against CEO and other top manager compensation packages and shares they are being offered for compensation because they are not doing a good job.

"It's a shame because GPRO did a lot of good for Colorado ski resorts, especially during the slower summer months. The obvious problem is that it's such an easy device to copy and not particularly expensive to make. When you're a startup, it's much harder to get the second home run than the first."
I am expecting 8.50$ very soon.
"RED ...and the TREND CONTINUES. This has never broken the downward moving average trend. Those who got out saved themselves a lot of grief. Those greedy ones that stepped in thinking it was a ""GOOD DEAL"" are paying the price."

"Red as usual , this stock is just manipulated ! Nothing will make a difference , bad news good news , its all air ! Nothing real ! At last the earnings (maybe) it should be 12-14 but who knows !"
Great news and movement coming from GoPro these apps couple months. With the holiday season closing in and now and even greater theory of a buy by Apple could spruce up the volume. It would make perfect sense for Apple to get into this company especially since the drone is already out. A little tweaking and perfection of the drone is what Apple can bring. And then they’re right there with Amazon and their drone ideas and advances.
"guys, gopro projections were based without including fusion camera. i am buying this stock again !"
"Olivia - Since you hate GoPro so much, why do you waste your time here? Why don't you go find another board to write your ignorant rude remarks on?"
Rising short interest.....Rising monthly cash flow for GPRO......increasing subscriptions.I predict....the stock of the year.
"Is there any rumours about a new Maxx camera? I think there is still a big future in 360 once people figure out how to edit it easily back to normal video. When I got the fusion it would take like 2 days just to render a 10 minute video on my Mac Pro, so I basically shelved it, then last season I tried editing on my phone and found it WAY better than on a computer. This got me back into using it more, and realizing how cool it can be to not worry about where you ""point"" your camera."
New HOD...Gonna leave $6+in rear-view mirror.West Coast nowawakening!
Sam thanks for coming back. I was super lonely without you 
Hopefully they can meet their goals this year. They consistently over promised and underperformed over the years. Maybe just maybe a real turnaround is taking hold. Finally. If they can meet their numbers as promised and brick and mortar reopen 2022 can be very surprising to the street. Lets hope the market doesn't correct till 2023... Thats asking an awful lot....
Beat earnings by %10 :)
Class action. He played Mark Cuban with his own company during the ipo

Dear Gopro I need an 8k gopro max asap
I would by under $7 before you can...Easy Money... Sorry shorts... Time has come...
Oh My I see GPRO is Mirroring FIT lol. GPRO on its own Short Squeeze... watch out....
"It's not about pumping or bashing if one is a real investor, it's about facts and context. Longbow Research downgraded GoPro to underperform from neutral with a price target of $7 per share. Analyst Joe Wittine warned that GoPro will likely miss sales estimates for its cameras in the fourth quarter."
"I think I would have better in site than most analysts , having 3 boys I know what there friends and they like and go pro is huge each kid has one and they download and make video clips for YouTube."
"they are gonna dilute the shares soon, they are running out of money guys"
I liked the earnings report. I heard CEO interviewed an liked him also.
Okay day traders...1 yr chart...patience
We are now at 1 month low at 8.75-8.80 (since the earnings rise) and it has only hit this low during market stress. It has yet to get lower than 8.75 and I consider that a buying opportunity.
When is the annual bagholder meeting?
This will flush out everyone who bought on the way up from the $6’s - build a new base from here - I can easily see ascent to $12 in the next 60 days- easy!
subscriptions looks good. beat the 750k. 67m loss for the year. atleast they have enough $$$ in the bank to last awhile. let’s hope they keep subscriptions moving in high double digits and increase sales. this market loves tech performers and hammers all others.. LT hold :-(
"Did a quick look at the charts today and between how they are looking (looks like a downturn might be coming) and the low volume this close to earnings -- I am closing my position while there is a gain to be made. My gut says long term might be good, but I'm not willing to continue risking money ""in the event of"" with so many stronger volatile stocks in play. Good luck to those holding."
This gonna moon tomorrow I yolod some 12/4 calls

I like the reviews overall I've seen on a new Hero 7 black I think I may be purchasing my first GoPro. we spend a lot of time at the beach with our new puppy and she loves the ocean I think will attach it to her collar and not only that I serve it sounds like this thing is easier to use and ever I hope so. I'll keep you posted!
I just bought another gpro / don’t get me wrong it’s a great product .. but they need to turn a profit. can’t they team up with Aapl as a peripheral to their phones ? I’m sure aapl would be interested in their technology / reduce production costs .. synergy .. accessories ..cmon guys. Look at Kodak .. it’s a tough industry / but if you can team up with a big boy you could possibly be profitable
Craig Classic!!
I believe GoPro will make fusion the next camera line up for growth and I would explain why. So with fusion they are able to put 360 degrees video into a fixed video by stitching . So let’s just say GoPro makes a breakthrough and develops softwares and the software does stitch the whole video with certain defined formats and then customers are able to post those videos on insta gram and Facebook etc directly at the time of capturing . They will also want to open a platform for the customers in the future where they can post videos just to share with the world . But I do believe if GoPro does achieve it would be great for the company in the long term attracting many more customers and also super serving its existing customers . Hope to see this news soon.
Would be nice to see a 20% gap up today?
Get on this Rocket TODAY and ride to outer Space. go go gpro.
"Reality is that break even is far off for a lot of folks still.... I have become too skeptical to get ahead of myself again on this stock. Having said that the last month has been quite promising. For a short period, the behavior of this stock is tolerable and supportive of hope. It will be nice to see if this sustained."
Concentrate on business not deleting messages any market up or down ur stock is in red zone how may innocent investors kill
OUCH
I have one more month to sell this POS for tax loss.
Big volume someone is buying alot
stock goes up lawyer file law suit. they should really learn how to use puts.
Cover GoPro now shorty. Because I like money News is squeezing.
GPRO RSI showingway OVERSOLD...hence: STRONG BUY!
wow it's going down hard lol what is happening?
GoPro Karma Drone flying LIVE right now on TWC the 2016 Billabong Pipe Masters Surfing contest is on live and Karma has live feed footage over Pipeline Oahu Hawaii and saltwater and spectators and it's not falling . It's flying GREEN SKIES. Aloha
THIS HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL DAY. ONLY SIXTY EIGHT CENTS FROM A 52 WEEK HIGH.WE WILL GET THAT BEFORE EARNINGS AND MORE. GO GO GPRO
You guys think I should wait for a dip? Or buy now with the anticipated launch coming up
"Seeking Alpha has there piece of commentary on GoPro which I mentioned a while ago that the industry is growing and GoPro being the leader will benefit. Although they are not fully bullish on the stock it seems they have changed their stance for some reason and may be they will buy position very soon. Beware some one is manipulating the stock again and don’t just sell yours for now. Not a good time to sell , it still has room to grow as a company."
Strong support at$5.46-$5.48. HUGE UPSIDE POTENTIAL:$2-$3++
"There is future for go pro, I just saw another review of DJI MAVIC on B&h website. Drum roll 1 star. I think they might have rushed the release."
quick rip to 8?
Wednesday is a confirmed hardware launch and new price point of 439.00. Wonder if GoPro launches new software as well. Editing tools for HERO and smartphones. New PLUS Benefits? GoPro should really do some sort of PLUS premium for 9.99 a month as well. Pay up for the full month kinda thing.
"I just read that DJI is using their drones to spy on the US and transmit sensitive data back to China. If this is proven to be true, I am assuming the company will be shutdown with its proprietors transported to a US military prison, and their spy drones will be banned from US soil.If this all happens, I would assume most drone manufacturers, including GOPRO, will see a revenue explosion. Right?"
let's get 59 $
"I just bought 33 $13.00 Oct 2021 call options ! It’s straight up gambling (not investing)! Hope to turn my $6,500 into some nice play money over the next month or so.... or lose a big chunk of it. We’ll see!"
"This jewel wants to go sky high. i am looking at $20.00 easy and then upwards,"
The last of the carnage? We had a fairly sharp upside reversal yesterday. If we can get some follow through today value play buyers will pour in and push it higher!
ZERO moat.Few if any valuable assets.A greedy and lazy CEO. One of the worst performing Founder led companies I’ve seen.The only upside for this POS is based on hope that an incompetent larger player will buy them out.
If you all see I predicted this turnaround 3 years ago. I have been a bull for long enough and I am not selling my stock for Marginal returns . Gopro just announced 2 new subscriber services and this is huge news on top of the 700K subscribers for plus. this stock is heading to the sky in a matter of weeks.
"Guys don't forget that the company increased its revenue a 19% since same period lat year. Net loss is also lower. I know that the company is still struggling a little bit, but they are improving their products and services. Definitely doing better results than what I expected and what analysis expected too. During 3 quarters in a row analysts did not hit their expectations."
why is GoPro down almost 10% today???
"CONGRATS to those who bought in the $3's. But here is the question: Do you have an exit strategy or just prayers? You're in the black...do you take profits or ""Ride it to $80!""? A smart investor has an exit strategy, both high and low. There was money to be made here, but you don't make any until you cash out. I hope you're being smart about it, because there is NO new reason for it to be going up, which means it can crash right back down again. Be smart..."
I think Nick was on his yacht during the conf call.
Might go long and sell calls first thing in the morning
"Per Camera Jabber:""GoPro has had its issues but the Hero7 Black and Hero8 Black seem to have put it back on track with an amazing stabilisation system. If the company follows its usual pattern we can expect to see a GoPro Hero9 Black in the autumn of 2020"".At this point I believe that we are all waiting to hear about the positive results of Q 4, 2019, and GoPro grand plans for 2020.Happy 2020 to all!"
"Ok Craig, first off you stated that revenue is in the red. Where are you getting this information from? Completely untrue. Look again. Second you stated that cash is going down every quarter. Yes this is true. So you’re 50/50 so far. Now looking at the last three quarters isn't enough to completely analyze GoPro's financial statements which is what you did. You must look at 2013, 2014 and 2015. This is where many don't want to take the time to look onto. Revenue is climbing every year from 2013-2015. 2013 was 985.737 million 2014 was 1.3942 billion 2015 was 1.6919 billion. Do you see a trend here? Now your argument will be what about 2016? Well we only have info for three quarters and fourth quarter historically is the best for GOPro. So am I saying everything is rosy? No not even close. Given they have had 6 bad quarters where over spending and diving into areas maybe they shouldn't. I personally feel GOpro was trying to expand too much too fast. Learn to walk before you run so to say. A company with a market cap of 1.3 billion and 1.6 billion in yearly sales (revenue) does not have a sales problem but a spending problem, period. If you want to go more into depth on the financials go ahead poke holes in the statements I just made."
I knew recovery would come. Now CRAIG do not talk #$%$ anymore
Snapchat or Kodak should consider buying GoPro
hard to see it over $5 with their outlook.
Please give us $19.00 before earnings. THANK YOU JESUS.
Instant 360 one X is one of the reason....https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3JSp3vDMVg
"Does anyone know, how Gpro will perform in international market?"
"Bought at 8.50, anyone think I and anyone who bought within last 5 days will see a profit in the next month?"
GRPO is surely building up the short interest. It may take a reasonable earnings to cause a real +100% squeeze. Shorts are still in control for now.
"With the close above 10 tonight this will be over 11 on Friday, ignore the shorts, I've added"
It's always darkest before the dawn.Midnight in the garden of GoPro.
Reminds me of $GPRO GoPro
It's pecker pounding GREEN! LEKA WINNING BIG $$$
Seeking Alpha touting GPRO to $15 Target
"Craig, what are your thoughts on the gopro shorts?"
One other very positive note no insider selling at recent highs :)
So with 500k subscribers GoPro will generate 25 million $ revenue every year . With accessories and camera sales this company could make millions easy . All the growth factors are there . Right time to jump in before sky rocket
Gm looks everything is good but stock in the red Zone enjoy

Forget about short squeezing. Soon we will find out how effective the shift in the business model is. This could be a great turnaround play with the subscription model and direct to consumer approach. The business has been setting itself up for a good recovery and the stock should follow. A short squeeze would be a cherry on top.
buying < $3
Does anyone think this stock has enough cash to last the next 2 years or will they need to file a 2ndary offering? Also does this company have any shot at becoming profitable in the 4th quarter of this year?
Short squeeze
"Sometimes, being right isn't fun. Today is one of those times, as GPRO is tanking. It's currently $4.06 as I write this. I hate seeing American companies fail, but sometimes, things just are what they are. As a smart woman once told me, ""He who you do not let die, will one day not let you live."" In this case, it means if you continued to invest in GPRO, you're just losing and it will kill your portfolio. Sometimes, you have to let a bad investment die. Smart people know when to cut bait and move on. Others, like Sarwar, refuse to listen to facts and history."
Does anyone know if GoPro is spared from Trump’s 25% Tariffs or not? I just read that the iPhone has been spared and I’m hoping GoPro will be too.
"What can you said about Jaguar and GoPeo relationship Mr Craig ""negative"" troll ?"
Looks like the shorts are getting there way yet again
May 13 short % volume was 45% and may 14 it was 36%. It means shorts have started to cover before they get hammered further . I am expecting 10$ sooner now than I was before . Read between lines and stop selling your shares for cheap .
i would never hold short over a weekend ever!
"What's hilarious is the Mavic been available for over a month but you may have ordered one but no one has received their Mavic they ordered yet. But GoPro Karma recalled and relaunched 3 months now and you'll get the GoPro Karma package way before the expensive Mavic is even shipped. Maybe Chinese dji Mavic having some internal problems delivering of their own. GoPro Karma package , better deal better AMERICAN Company making better memories. GoPro about to take more than Market share from dji. Watch"
Company could sell Karma helmets.
When will Gopro do a secondary offering? They are almost out of cash.
The shorts are praying it does a U turn ! sorry folks - it's only headed one way and that's to the moon!
Craig master Wall Street it’s upupupupip
GPRO headed much higher--ongood authority!
Are the longs really going to hold their breath and white knuckle it for six months to see if Management can get it right? This Management?
"great brand, now affordable, going into Walmarts etc... I think they could do ok in the next couple of quarters."
Nick is buying up teeth whitening products over buying stock in GoPro smh.
Vice grips on the shorts!
Only a matter of time until the attention turns to $GPRO. A recognized name with over 10% short interest that has been controlled by short hedge funds for too long. Viva Go Pro
It will be in the 20's by Christmas 
"Saw GPRO is getting some attention and decided to check it out. I don't have any holdings and wondered if I should get some shares with this pullback. I don't think I will and I will tell you why:- Looking at the past history the share price was as high as $85. That was NOT a symptom of any reverse splits so I consider that neutral. If the high price was in the last year or two I would take that as an encouraging sign. Reverse splits are death, IMO. :-)Then looking at the financials, it appears in the last period they had $1.2B and in the current it was $1.6 Which is great.The thing that worries me is the earnings. What the heck are the spending all the revenue on...?! This not a new company so I would expect to see more profit when you consider how expensive the products are.And the last concern is competition. I bought a 1090p clone WITH a water-proof case and mounting accessories for $9.95. In fact, I bought 5 of them at Roses in Galax, VA."
"Hey, I think this is a real good deal now! It finally went down by some points!! I'm buying in, no doubt. These cameras are perfect."
This week we will say goodbye to single digits and move to double digits and never look back next stop will be 20s great news from Barcelona...
Today will be a great day for longs be patient
GPRORun it back to 50Buyout ?
"In order for GPRO to see 10 again, all it needs is a miracle."

DJI exploring IPO. Now that’s the one to invest in! Amazing innovation and great management.
"GoPro CEO to investors: We are right where we want to be. 5 bucks a share, is that really where we want to be?"
"Okay, I just bought more shares today. This was with the last dollar of my money, including my life’s savings. I’m averaged pretty low. I am sure Craig is gonna verbally bash me! But it won’t mean anything at all until I sell at a loss. Everybody knows that!! Okay, now the waiting game. . . Hurry up and wait. . ."
So much stabilization and 4K too! As well as live streaming. Looks like the perfect camera for action
"Does people really understand what GoPro is doing with this remote thing ? It sets GoPro to be the security camera you needed at home , take it out and record your actions . A fixed security camera don’t offer much value but a GoPro provides a huge value of the company can grow into this market segment . I expect GoPro to be entering a lot of vertical and horizontal markets soon ."
gopro is down 40 something percent in 3 months
"Q1 & Q2 are shaping up well for Gopro stock. A close friend who happens to be a EVP in a financial position at a well know big boy retailer has given me very positive news on sell in metrics for both the Hero 6 and Fusion, along with solid sell through metrics on Hero 5, 6 and Session.Additionally, the Q2 refresh of the Hero Session line along with the announcement / Q3 release of the Gen 2 Karma drone with full sensor suite and vastly upgraded flight control / photography software bodes well for a stock trading at 1x sales, steadily building available cash and greatly expanding overseas sales.Lastly, we are seeing manufacturing starts that are the largest seen since 2014 (in fact larger than 2014), which leads one to believe that accelerated over seas sales is materially increasing production runs and thus potential revenue."
"Even during the ""turn around"" woodman and co. still has an excuse like Fit who sold for pennies cause that Ceo couldnt hack it either."
Saw $10.91 AH. There are two options here depending on your timeline: this could run up going into Thursday and one can sell into that strength; or risk fall back to $9-$10 afterwards with impressive run-up again past $12 in the 2 months following. Depends on how you want tour capital to work for you in the next 2 months....
Woody quick 10-1 reverse split before bankruptcy filing.
"Still saying $16 ... we will resume the uptrend starting Monday, buying opportunities through the holiday, $10 by Christmas then the short squeeze around that time shooting to a quick upper teens. $$$"

"The run up to earnings starts today, shorts should be covering, longs should have bought on the dip. There is no turning back now"
Gopro Hero 5 selling like hot cakes. Stock should rise up slowly. Big bang effect cant be guaranteed as of now as the company needs to update on relaunch of Karma.
someone is buying below 6 looks like has a good support at 5.90
"I used to believe in this company, but not anymore!! Thinking of buying short term puts tomorrow!"
Woody will crush investors - MAX PAIN!!!
OK shorts....you better get ready to take it!
"Guys, this company is in full turn around mode. Don't let your paper hands make you miss out on this. https://antonio-linares.medium.com/gpro-is-turning-around-5c17590b2f93"
"It appears that GPRO is out of woods. Next Monday after the close, they are coming out with earning.It willbe great and stock will rocket. As you might have noticed from AMBA. He is supplier of cards/chipsfor the camera. Hold tight, the time is ripe to take a bite. You will enjoy when it moves up over 20%. Even yesterday in the morning it hit 13.40. Hedge funds are playing with it and thinking they have control in theirhands but after the earnings the institutions and large investors will boot them out, then it may very well crossover $15.00."
I hate my Hero 5. It freezes up and I have to take the battery out evertime. It overheat the camera and uses up the battery. Don't want to switch to chinese product but gopro needs to do better with QA.
Been watching this stock for months and they say the turnaround just started??? No it started months ago but analysts are to full of it to see it. Months ago when they fired people they were reorganizing that was when the real turnaround started not after they have a quarter that sends it soaring. It just makes me mad analysts bash this stock to the ground not seeing the vision of the company then after it soars and they change their views.
Gopro is trading in tandem with Fit Bit and that’s not good short term.
Today's pre-market news will add MILLIONS to revenues and PROFITABILY.Red is the new black!
SNAP PPS = $8.00 to $70 within a year.Compare the statistics of GPRO with SNAP. What gives with the PPS difference?
Craig!!! Wherefore art thou????
Should be a 20 dollar stock IMO
Anyone see a potential reverse split on the horizon?
This explains the put volatility in mid Feb at $20. Looks like people are expecting good things from earnings.
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 7.90
This is pretty impressive how the price is holding and coming back pretty strong! As we get into late Dec expect to hear leaks of subscriber numbers and or holiday sales performance. I can see this heading towards $10 by end of year....
No reason for this to be up. Amazing that it is doing better with little sales than when it was hitting all time sale records!
wondering what those sellers know we dont ? firs Q report was great and positive with share at $7.5 applaud for moving to Mexico clear guidelines for 2019 being profitable no bad news since or company announcements than why ?????? only reason being they can playing on company options pity and not respectful for the efforts they made
"Give me a break, no real interest here in GPRO....If their was it would be on the scanner.WTRH, ride the wave next week back to 12. FOOT OFF THE BREAK by perhaps the worst, most manipulative and brave mm in the game.Weak broke and poor mm's usually crowd around 200 million cap 2 dollar stacks.This guy though could run and hustle a 40.00 stock with 5 billion cap if he and his other 2 market maker friends in collusion wanted to but instead he chooses too stay right on Waitr and push it around and back down on every little lift.Foot of brake next week though, he can't risk June 16th.NKLA is going to 120, with or without robinhood newbies. Just a matter if you were in on time or not?It's your loss."
$275m Rev. 28%GM. (0.22) eps for Q2 estimate. Thoughts?
Went to B&H Photo Video in New York website to see that GoPro is their top selling device.I would assume that Amazon and others would have similar results.

go GoPro go GoPro go! I just traded up my hero 4 silver for $100 of a new hero 5 black! Boom! Brilliant GoPro!
Apple or Google will come calling to acquire GoPro and work it’s intellectual property into the guts of a camera on a phone. That is if GPRO does not take a ride up and get too expensive beforehand.
"how this has not been purchased by another company is surprising. I agree with some of the sentiments, that the CEO should go. He should go. I also wonder how all of the content they have is not being monetized. FB should buy them just for that...I thought Apple might buy them, and they may yet as they have committed about $200 billion to be ""invested"" in M&A, dividends and buybacks..."
Don’t know with GoPro $GPRO the short ratio is going up as analysts slice their price target to something lower like from 7 to 5.50 when they were not right on the first target in the first place and the stock hits new recent highs. Billionaires helping billionaires. GPRO deserves to be the next $GME but those billionaires can put their money where there mouth is because they got it. Manipulation at its finest like in$GME $AMC $IRBT $DDD before the jump $PLCE All these should have the SEC investigating the short hedge funds and their friends helping them out at the brokerage houses

Anyone have confirmation of Osmos Action 2 launch at DJI event in May? A lot of anticipation for a scheduled launch. DJI launches new cameras every other year as they have a few and a seem to alternate. OA1 launched May 2019. New drones doing as well.
"The house got cleaned in the toughest year on record with most retail closed. Yet earnings are stellar, cashflow is Stellar, #$%$ is stellar. What not to like."
"With GME type of short squeeze, prepared to see GPRO reach $100 at least."
"""Longbow noted that the wearable camera company delayed its shipment date for its new Karma drone to November 28 from October 23 this weekend"""
"I am estimating that with monetization of content and attracting that advertising revenue along with the subscription for GoPro hardware and cloud GoPro revenue will reach 2-3 billion by 2023. If all these are executed well we will see huge profits growth and revenue growth. Considering all that I believe GoPro is trading at a significant discount right now . With 2 billion in revenue and net profit of 10% it would be able to make 200 million a year and with 15% 300 million. With 3 billion of revenue they would be able to make 300 million a year at 10% profit and 450 million with 15% net profit. All that being said GoPro is at huge discount and the least optimistic estimate would be 150 million a year. That is the sole reason institutions are on a buying spree. Upward momentum in stock price , improving fundamentals and increase in short burning, low volume on lower days and high on higher days. Higher highs and higher lows are all signs of buying the stock"
"In my opinion the objetive price for Go pro is USD 26,55. I feel is really unfair that a company like Go Pro Inc., which is a brand recognized all over the world, has this value.Everyone in their house have a Go pro...Other companies that are less accepted by public have a better price .... What is happening ?"
I predict Gopro will announce Bankruptcy in 2018 and will see a stock price below 2 dollars in May.

"While trail riding, I tried mounting my Iphone on my helmet. Didn't work out too well. Get my point?GoPro took a beating because of their ridiculous drone failure, but the product rocks and EVERYONE on earth loves and recognizes the GoPro brand for action, or even subtle vacation, filming.GoPro WILL go up at some point. Sales are cranking and everyone who buys one watches their jealous neighbor buy one a few days later."
My 13 year old son came home yesterday and asked if he could get a Hero5. He said all the kids at school are talking about getting a new GoPro. Very good sign.
"I see a strong drop for gopro imminent, stock market as a whole is overvalued, mainly due to the damaged covid stocks rallying. Gopro is trading way above analyst price targets, even after factoring in new sub #s and last earnings call. And they won't benefit much at all from vaccines or economic recovery."
Gap up today ? :)

Why is it going red
GOPRO should change its name to GOAWAY. They are going to go belly up unless they get funding. They will be selling their products for a loss this holiday season.
5.67 to 5.81 intraday high
up a couple dimes a day is all I ask
is it too late to jump on in?
Goodluck all
Benzinga out with earnings outlook - .48/share loss vs .04 a year ago - 56% decrease in year over year revenues! This is bleak.
Take your profits and run. This a gift. I'll buy back @$8
"GOPRO, everyone and their uncles are making cameras for sports, thrill seekers and drone that are a lot Cheaper and not such a big lost when damaged. You’re buying a name, the product is just technology that’s old news. Just my opinion"
Anybody have the new gopro? How is it? Thinking of upgrading mine.
40 minutes toLAUNCH!
"I'm very surprise that the CEO Nick Woodman still aroung, after 2 years of bad performance, the CEO should be the first one to let it go.what are they waiting for?????.All the Top Management should be changed , starting from the CEO post"
Zooooooooommmmmmmmmmmmmmm....once upon a time it was a stock market darling......$98......more recently $29......
"Here’s my hypothesis for GOPRO FY 2021 net profit after tax: GOPRO will have double digit net profit with high single digit growth. It’s based upon $1.3b revenue @ 37% net gross margin generating $481m in gross profit. Remember GOPRO operating expense will decline from $300m in 2020 to $250m in 2021. Thus, $481m-$250m generates $231m net profit. That reduction of $50m in operating expenses will cost near $32m in severance and cancelled lease contracts. What’s remaking is $231m net profit-$32m in severance and property reduction leaves $200m in profit. With an estimated 170m shares that generates $1.18 earnings per share. With a PE of 12 ($1.18 x 12x earnings). Therefore, the stock will be somewhere near $14. The massive OPEX reduction unlocks shareholder value. To support my analysis, if FY OPEX was $400m or $150m higher than forecasted $250m in FY 2021, which make GOPRO marginally profitable. The power of cost reduction and operational excellence always generates great results."
"This is It, over!!!!!"

"New HIGH of DAY...on under 500,000 shares. Do the math!"
"From the Seeking Alpha article: ""The signs are pointing to a troubled holiday quarter. Sure, GoPro could be waiting to surprise the market but the evidence isn't promising and it would be a bold bet to be heavy on the long side going into earnings in another month and a half. If GoPro were to miss revenue this quarter it would be the final nail in the coffin as far as chances Wall St. is willing to give. In fact, the company's livelihood depends on this quarter and sets it up for a good or bad 2018."""
very high option activity $6 & $7 & $8
When is this CEO going to be shown the door?
"I’m done with this,Unloading everything today. Which I should have done last week.Ridiculous pos"
Up .25 today and GoPro will be up1.25+ tomorrow. Need a link then trywww.tinygoprotroll
How is GoBroke treating everyone on this fine day?
What makes me laugh is GoPro feverishly buying back their own shares to try to keep this turd afloat and the pumpers here on Yahoo! Finance thinking that whatever they post is going to move the stock up to help them out of their massive paper loses.
GRPO has been commoditized. Why buy when you have better quality video on your cell phone - the CEO even marveled at how powerful the computing power was on CNBC. So who would buy for a legacy camera company? And before you answer remember that under the current administration deals are not getting done by foreign buyers. CFIUS has proven to be an insurmountable hurdle. That leaves domestic US players. Fewer options mean lower premium - if any.
"LEKA: Remember about 5 hours ago, when you were crowing because it was up .16? That'll teach you to not think the game is over in the 3rd inning because your team is up by a run. Well...actually, you don't seem capable of learning, so I take that back."
Shorts be like...
"Same old thing...the market makers are taking the share price up for a week or two, and then KABOOM...watch it plummet and you'll all wonder what the term ""profit taking"" means and get screwed again, because like pigs, you didn't have an exit strategy that was reasonable, and you thought ""It has to keep going up!"" No, it doesn't and it won't. This has been the same pattern for 3 years now. Those who don't learn from history...oh, nevermind."

"Dear Nick W., you have great vision for the company. You have filled white space people didn't know existed. Your products are highly competitive if not superior. The brand is tarnished, but still strong. With all due respect, PLEASE CONSIDER STEPPING DOWN, and letting a proven business leader realize YOUR vision and GO PRO's full potential!"
"Pls advise, do you know why is 7% down before opening?"
"There is strong buyout value in Gopro's tech, employees, brand, and data. This can easily integrate with operations of many large tech companies from various industries - phone, security, drone, hospitality/tourism, social media, etc. At this market cap, it is value, buyout, and a growth play. This 'niche' market - travel, tourism, and sharing experiences via social media is growing. They have a high quality product (excellent reviews all around), but there's ill sentiment towards management and operations- the latter is improving naturally through learnings from the past. Bad sentiment is baked in already, hope you're not short."

MEGA REVERSAL...TO THE UPSIDECONFIRMED!
Did the cfo just change to the date to profitability to 2019 instead of 2 half of the year?
I'm no fortune teller but I think many will look back on this time in the GPRO chart and realize that it was a seminal moment for investing in GoPro. Once their new displays hit Best Buy (and the like) and the average shmo sees their products there will be a surge in mom and pop stock purchases while GoPro's bottom line improves from massive sales through the holidays.
If GOPRO shows a profit .06 share tomorrow-the stock moves past $7 and on the way to 9 by year end. Finally right sized the company and with expanding margins with subscription growth and direct channel That points to upward move. With vaccine in Q4 and consumers with more cash-its all good.
The Giant GPRO Wakeup. Will see $10's next year for Sure. $9's within 2 weeks.
"GoPro has been a no-growth company almost since its IPO. Facts are facts, sorry.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b03fb530-f819-328e-a9ec-6c1cc64cde2e/gopro-has-been-a-no-growth.html"
"Yet, only 631m market cap"
Showing resiliency in an overall down day. Been doing that lately. I'm not saying this is a wonder stock. Just noting this behavior has been consistent.
Daily Volume is shrinking .... means Strong Sell ...
GPRO reached a new All Time Low at 6.28
Even 'big boys' scurrying to cover now
I got cheap price 6.09 shares 10 thousand see what happen ? Strong buy
warned you guys
Nice quarter. Does this still have a 33% short interest? If this is the case we may hit 9 sooner than we think. Interesting interview with Nick Woodman https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-05-02/gopro-ceo-nick-woodman-on-bloomberg-studio-1-0-videohttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-05-02/gopro-ceo-nick-woodman-on-bloomberg-studio-1-0-video
"There is no sale, there is no suitor. That line of BS from JPM was given to keep this stock going from below $5 yesterday, plummeting the stock into oblivion."
"SARWAR: Did you see my post a while back, suggesting you and others look at CYDY? I bought at .33 in December, and it just hit $1.34 today. Honestly, do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll dump GPRO in a second, or at least make up your losses. I'm telling you this as a friend...or at least as much of a friend as one can be on an anonymous board. 6 months from now, you'll be reading about how CYDY is at $20. It's a biotech about to blow up big time. Good luck!"
Next quarter GPRO will finally have positive TTM earnings.
G A R B A G E STOCK
GPRO FLASH CRASH has Begun !!!!!!! $3.52!!
down goes Frazier
"Pretty low volume day, likely won't even reach 4M by end of day. This means that most people are content with the price and are eagerly waiting for the earnings. This means shorts expect below $8.5 post earnings (otherwise they would start covering in the last week) and longs expect quite an upside (likely $11+) since only those prices would justify the risk."
jdi could be the buyer to get in US market since they are private
From 81 a share to 7 / congrats longs you deserve free food stamps
As GPRO temporarily retraces...MIME just starting its move as predicted earlier!!
"Read the article today in Investor Place about why GPRO may not survive 2019. Then think about it and decide what you think. Facts are facts, sorry Sarwar."
"Shorties want to capitalize even on good news but that will soon change , these people didn’t see the full report and are claiming things which aren’t even in the report . Lol"
At least we can capture GoBroke bankruptcy proceedings on a Hero cam!
"I can only say that I am happy that at the time I bought GoPro I did not have much cash on hand, so I only bought 500 shares. It looks like I will lose all of that money but I am probably going to stick around for at least one more earnings report or to see if Woodman gets ousted as the CEO."
"SOLD. Sorry guys ., I sold my positions. I should have stayed with my original prediction of that this stock will sink. But I bought in $14 thinking that was low. And after losing 10K., I'm not willing to take any further risk. With recall, this stock is bound to sink more. Probably $4 is my prediction now. Cut your losses now guys. Its not worth hanging on .,I will buy this stock only after NICK is fired."
bought this and unity this morning at the DIP!!!!!!
"This jewel will be $12.00 before earnings. $20.00 after earnings, THANK YOU JESUS."
"I am still trying to figure out why anyone thinks this is a good investment. Several product launches, two rounds of layoffs in the past 18 months the only one who got rich in all of this was Woodman and the shorts."
6$ by the end of the week.
"This board just keeps getting better and better. Most everyone here has provided some useful information. Some less than others and there will always be opposing views. Amazing how quickly people trash talk. My 2 cents on social commentary.Regarding GPRO, continuing to consolidate nicely and quiet as mentioned below by Chris. Then again, Friday is typically a lighter trading day. Tight trading range as well. We have gained roughly $1.50 off the lows and are holding it. As I recall, last earnings, the price moved around a bit and tanked a bit just before announcing with a wild ride on the day of earnings. We were even green that day for a short time. Personally I feel there are a lot more chances for good news here - but as many have said, they need to beat expectations and come with a plan for 2017 bringing the Karma back to market and discussing their other revenue channels. Technically, earnings will provide the 2nd candlestick.Good luck everyone and have a great weekend."
So DJI is presenting a stock offer worth between 500mil and 1bil ?! With a 1bil more it may just be enough to purchase GPRO. Why else would GPRO dump their Karma Drone business. Makes sense for DJI to buy GPRO !!FB I don’t know what now. Does DJI BUY GPRO??!
"While you are waiting for a turnaround here, you can join us at HIT.V!"
"Of to a great start!!! GoPro to $2,00?"
Is it time to buy in? Risk vs Reward...the reward is much greater than any short term risk. Might lose 10% vs gaining 30%+ in the next couple months????
"Craig, not sure why you keep using the excuse that GoPro has been silent. On Dec 5, Nick Woodman attended a Raymond James conference and specifically stated that the Karma was not going to be released for the holiday season, were working on power/electrical issues and that it would not be released until all problems solved. At the very least, either listen to everything or if you did, stop using this as a scare tactic. Just makes you seem less credible."
are you seeing this?! $12.94
Let's keep on moving this baby up...
GoPro: Why It's a Screaming Buyhttp://money.cnn.com/2017/03/28/technology/us-drone-registrations/index.html
Went to Best Buy and they said Gopro selling well and they are challenged to keep inventory current. Said the Fusion will be next “must have”electronic device. He said nothing can compete against Gopro. I also saw a TV add on cable from a very large appliance store advertising Hero 6. I think Gopro will beat expectations because there is no expectation fo Gopro to perform.

All the YouTubers use gopro and the quality and stability is nice.
"New subscription-based model, licensing agreements... all signs point to them prepping to sell"
This is what we get with a founder controlled company with 73% ownership of GPRO! Any other CEO would of been fired a long time ago!
"How is it going leka and jbrad? Guess those vapor shares you were given will now never get vested so you can stop with the senseless pumping of the stock on this board, like this actually has any impact to the share price."
Thank you shorts for creating a buyin opportunity before next week!

Damn this thing goes down faster than it goes up. Amazing how it trades just like FIT. Shorts in control.
"Stock price is tightening up. Not many buyers or sellers. Seems to me everyone is waiting for 2/2, which will provide Q4 and 2016 annual performance as well as direction for 2017 and possibly some product release dates and guidance. Lots of speculation here -- but honestly it is all just speculation. Hopefully sales of the new camera line were as strong as indications which would suggest they beat earnings estimates, even with the write-downs for the business lines that are being cut. Also the 15% cut in labor should be reflected going forward in helping to get the company back to a positive bottom line.Good luck all."
Orders just placednorth of $6 pps!!!!!!

Go Pro devices do not need a sophisticated chip like Amba provides. No one buys Go Products anymore.
"GoPro should partner with eScooter companies (or at least manufacture a scooter mount) to take advantage of that growing transportation trend and people wanted to record their trips for both time-lapse and accident/safety purposes. If they made a lower-end sku that were built into the eScooter, they could offer cloud services to store videos of each ride that both scooter company and rider would have access to..."
"if guidance isn't great, does this stock really have that much more room to fall? now with hero 5 and karma entering the market, it's hard to envision this stock going back to single digits. the stock has been battered so much these past few weeks, i feel like there's a huge upside potential and minimal risk going into q3 earnings. thoughts?"
"Longs have two options , 1. Sell and Run 2. Sell and Short"
I see this going down to 6 to work itself up with actual proof of work. I would not buy this until it dips much much lower.
"A new, lower priced and competitive GoPro camera? https://gizmodo.com/this-sure-seems-like-a-new-unannounced-gopro-1824157450 shows a possibility."

THERE IS HOPE FOR GOPRO...
Carl Icahn will burn the shorts if he’s an investor in GoPro now . I know this guy. He burned a lot of people on herb life . I am not sure about the news but read it in comments if it’s true then shorts have no where to run 
WHERE ARE THE UPGRADES?
"I think there are three things the company needs to accomplish in order for this stock to head upward for the longer term. 1. Another earnings beat next quarter that shows growing revenue 2. The hero 6 needs to be a rockstar 3. the company needs to be able to prove it has it supply chain issues all buttoned up and deliver its products on time without recalls, delays or disagreements with vendors (like what happened with amazon last year). If they can't pull through with the latter we will probably get a nice ""hype bounce"" for a month or two but it will then just wind up injecting another year of skepticism into the company and stock."
This is a shake-out and someone is snapping up shares! I'm staying in for the merger and acquisition announcement!
Need to hit $9 and I break even.
I like this price.. just loaded up!
why is it green?
That 7% turned 2% fast

Go pro is going up
"Shares of adventure video camera maker GoPro (GPRO) are down 3 cents at $9.16, after Piper Jaffray’s Erinn Murphy reiterated an Underweight rating on the shares this morning, and cut the firm’s price target a buck to $8, writing that “this Holiday season has not gone as planned from our perspective,” including product delays and restructuring, and bad e-commerce trends.“Our weekly Amazon tracking indicates the average pricing basket of GoPro products has seen a sequential quarterly decline from $282 in Q3 to $265 in Q4,” writes Murphy. Murphy now models Netflix’s Q4 revenue at $515 million, down from a prior $546 million estimate, and below consensus for $604 million."
Woody prolly unloading shares again. Wonder what he wants to buy this time. Can’t trust that guy farther than I can throw him.
"Feels a lot like early 2016... with this dumbed down version of the Hero 5. I thought they were going to change the form factor. Oh well. Maybe it'll sell, but I'm not impressed. Nothing new."
LIve Streaming and were at 6.45 LOL I only check my stocks once a month. This is crazy.. !!!! BUying more here. As people start to use the new product then we go to 9 or 10 short term.
"one big takeaway that everyone's missing is the number of gopro plus subscribers which is now close to 350000, adding a minor but not unsubstantial 30 million to the revenue stream!"
"For the millionth time, I desperately wish I never bought into this stock. After more than 4-5 years of nightmares - literarily from the beginning of this junk, I finally cracked and dumbed all the rest of my shares. What a colossal waste of my time! The loss is unbelievable but I can't continue to bear seeing this symbol among my portfolio. The drain on my joy is to expensive."
Will the earnings be positive or negative?
What new camera....
https://www.google.com/amp/s/nysenasdaqnews.com/2019/01/08/has-moment-finally-arrived-gopro-inc-nasdaq-gpro/amp/Who cares about momentum ? What is going on what’s wrong with the stock ? Why is it going up ? I wasn’t expecting GoPro going up for the next few months . Well I think there is news which we don’t know? Or may be just short covering and who’s selling their shares at such low prices?
"GoPro 7 Black -- is a big ""Game Changer"" -- GoPro Stock -- Buy Now -- No Sale --"
LOL... there is nothing proprietary about GPRO's products... no moat or barrier to entry.Xiaomi or anyother Asian company can manufacture their own cameras.Sony has been making superior cameras for decades!
https://newsfilter.io/articles/russell-investments-group-ltd-invests-828000-in-gopro-inc-nasdaqgpro-7fb29ba9bca24eeb577d0854783251ce
I heard AMC getting hit next
"They said y'day: Target 5M Units 2018, so Q4 would be at 2M units. Revenue up to 380M, would mean 190$ per Unit? The Hero 7 Black is priced at 399$. I don't understand their rev estimates für Q4. It seems too conservative about the sellings of Hero 7 black."
I like this stonk.
Just doubled down. I can’t resist this price. New hardware and software announcement soon. This dip is a gift.
"Isn't ironic how everytime (IMO) GPRO bumps up in price with positive pricing action, I see another bafoon article or micro-interview touting how GPRO is lowering forecasts, or how it's future could be in trouble, or some other frivolous BS."
so much for being green for the day !!
"Delay, delay, delay. They made such a big deal about launching the drone for Christmas and now they have pushed back delivery 5 weeks to November 28. That beautiful multi month up trend is getting ready to break."
let's see if it can stay above 5.05 and close around 5.25 if not more.....
"GPRO reminds me of Taiwanese HTC. Both has a CEO with major controlling stake, that stubbornly doesn't admit personal failures, and still runs the company not willing to stepdown. Ironically the founding CEO Woodman is also the person killing the company."
Buying with conviction in GPRO since yesterday. Higher highs higher lows. Back to 10+ soon
nick push that button and sell it
So time for a little fun. What will GPRO close at today? I'm saying $11.23. The one closest buys beer for the rest :)
Get ready for next week! Could be a lot of fun if your long!!!
GoPro is up 9.39% to 6.76
To gopro
Tuesday I’m buying 2000 sh of GPRO. GPRO @7.50-7.60 is a good risk/reward BUY IMO
I am only down a few cents. No biggie. Long and strong. They will sell those $199 cameras as fast as they can make them.
BEST TO GET IN NOW IF U WANT TO GET IN UNDER $10.00 A SHARE. DON'T WAIT UNTIL AFTER EARNINGS. GOOD EARNINGS WILL TAKE IT TO NEW HIGH.
"Woody should partner with McDonalds and bundle the Hero 6 Black with every happy meal purchase for an extra 99 cents, ppl will think Woody is a genuis!"
"I say $11 before ER, if it stays at 10 or below then it might be a miss based on share price action. so $11 before ER, $12.50 after ER, touch $14 after upgrades in the following 2-3 weeks"
What did happen with GoPro exiting the drone business?That was very disappointing.
"Just a quote I agree with: ""Craig hangs around to attack every optimistic comment. Must be a sad life to live."""
"it’s very simple: they don’t sell as much as they used to. The hype has passed, and competition has basically eaten their marketshare, and the false illusions from dreamers pumping this stock have faded. Hence, the bubble popped. One of three things will happen with this company: (1) goes bankrupt + gets taken over by PE firm; (2) gets bought out by competition (Garmin) just for the intellectual property/customers; or (3) is slowly fades into the background yo eventually close operations as its product become a commodity with no competitive advantage"
"I buy GPRO here as it is a buy out candidate.With all shorts, this could make a wAy up"
"So I originally invested at the IPO and made some huge profits and cashed out. Looking at the price now, it seems like a dumb decision not to buy regardless of any negative news with the company. I know plenty of extreme sports fanatics and every single one of them has a gopro. Not some Chinese knock off or any of the other cheaper alternatives. I will be moving some funds around to put a little nest egg in GPRO in the next few days. I'll probably let it sit until the end of 2018. I see positive signs for GPRO in the long run. This is not advice, simply my opinion. Good luck to all."
"Well this was fun while it lasted. Good to be well above sea level finally on this dog, but it is time to sell when it hits $10. Should have sold when it dropped to $12 but I foolishly had hopes that they would get a new CEO."
bought in today 6.35 earnings should be very good.
Good news tomorrow? Or bad?
Santa Claus rally for GoPro starting soon!
Man I hate this stock.
wow this stock is bleeding everyday.
Nice day :)

"SARWAR: Well, it's 8/14 and we're approaching the 52 week low, despite how wonderful you think the company has done these last few quarters. So tell us...the Baltimore Orioles...if they pull off a 2 game winning streak, are you putting your money on them to win the World Series this year, despite the fact that they are on pace to win about 68 games. I mean, why bother with facts, right? Only fools look at numbers and extrapolate from known history. You're an out of the box thinker, my man! A rebel!"
"Qt 4 gains GPRO should be around 6.25, in my opinion."
GPRO is up 5.85% to 5.25
"im in,"
Anyone bought this at 93? lmao
This will be the year GoPro gets bought. They need a real managment team to run the business and get Nick the hell out of the way. Great camera maker horrible investment. Any change will not come quickly.
What should we understand from “no comment” answer from Nick on BO
"With the ER i expected some pullback, but I feel like 10% is a severe over reaction. Things are looking better for GoPro and hopefully over the next two months, they can get on a selling spree. Christmas is coming up and the economy seems to be humming along."
Hold on for a uptrend ride guys. Go go go
come on $17.00
GPRO needs to stop being an ATM for short-sellers:1. Go private 2. Buyout/mergerOr3. Buyback shares
"if you notice lately gpro is giving us good news on Fridays, today might be the day"
Who call it!
$10.00 a share is just around the corner.
Forget the 200 day which is a long way off. This stock can barely hold the 50 day. Took out yesterdays low with ease.
What's the word on the street today? Good earnings bad earnings? Thoughts?
what happened to trigger rise?
"Again Do not filter out my MSG:I have 20 stock portfolios, Last Friday 19 stock all went up very good and there is only 1 stock that went negative , GUESS WHAT it was GORPO, the famous GOPRO stock, I guess if Mr Nickman and think that is his name, don't waste people time and money, just quit or be fired so people can make money out of this company , it is been already 2+ years and look how hemanaged this company into a total LOSS, Also I;'m very surprice that the Board Member is not complaining ????"
"Maybe they should get into Dash Cams, and Home Alarms like Ring."
GoPro will have record holiday sales this year with the new camera. The mods will have more sales after the holiday.
cvm is worth a watch.. slight sell off this am after heavy gains ..then to the stratosphere
one more. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5U_vvCBIXl0
Wow GPRO is doing really well today. Congrats longs
"Sam, where are you I’m lonely  here..."
"Took a risk today and sold some other stocks in my portfolio to buy a bit more GoPro. Though I genuinely think it should easily reach $12-13 in the short run and $14+ in a longer period, I feel a bit nervous on having an unbalanced portfolio, but damn it is so hard to resist buying from these prices :(."
GPRO IS GOING TO SHOOT AT THE MOMENT NO ONE IMAGINE !!!!! THE ON THIS BUS YOU WILL ENJOY A GOOD TRAVEL !!!!!SIMPLY PATIENCE
"The most amazing thing, that has been missed by all of the financial writers, is tha the recent GoPro camera exchange program has been delayed up by an IT screw up."
Hahahahaha look at the shorties trading after hours to drive the price down by few cents . Hahahahaha
Good news coming soon don’t sale
One of the best stocks to buy now. It’s holding great while the market is down.
Let the GOPRO SHORT SQUEEZE begin! UP GREEN MONDAY and likely all week. jbrad KNOWS. GOPRO BULL$ $$$$$ march to 20.
So if the trade deal is signed soon it’s still a good thing to do? Seems like an over reaction. And the new nafta is still not done.
wouldn't be surprised if Woodman is selling lol
"Hey, am I right or wrong? Anyway, I thought I had a more surreptitious kind of intellect about me. . . Haha!"
NEW co. with action cameras coming in the market daily...go pro could be BK soon...
A Craig by any other name makes me laugh.
They started shipping hero 8 today. Also its not on preorder anymore. You can buy the camera and they send it straight away..
4.42 Looks like somebody have already seen holiday sales numbers.
"Question on everyone's mind:Why release news about the Drone 1 day before earnings? Should we try to read between the lines? Or are we thinking too hard? My thought is, if I had ""bad news"" f, I might start with trying complimenting the person. Because even if the good thing was actually true, but I say it along with a bunch of negative things, the compliment will get lost and have no positive effect."
This week for Longs and Next week for Shorts!
Should sell to Apple
"Why didn’t GoPro get into the home security camera business.? I know no one who extreme skis, jumps off cliffs, surfs or is an expert kayaker, yet just about EVERONE I know has security cameras at their home. Big mis take for this company."
Looks like 2-hour heavy buying volume will soon pass all day Friday...Shorts arescrambling to cover!
"Forward looking statements on the investor call sound good. It's going to dip tomorrow, but long term, it is still good."
So now they are making positive earnings and the stock is worth less than last year when they weren’t profitable. That makes sense.
"If anyone here is surprised and wondering why GPRO has fallen so fast and so far in 2 days, then you really do not understand what has been going on for the past 3 years. You are why casinos keep being built, thinking ""This time it'll be different and I'm gonna win!"" without really know how to play the game."
"Gopro is really a semi public company. When Woodman holds 30% of the stock and even more voting rights, who on his team can challenge him. He has massive leverage with decision making because he really owns the company. Never hear him talk about shareholders like other public companies. He’s a big owner and big problem."

GoPro stock.Is the short squeeze coming?

Under $12....??????Buy that stock.
it shuld drop to 5
"(Quick conclusion for people who do now enjoy reading: It's time to change tech-stock if you are looking for the big bucks)Hi there,First time typing on this board, have me excused if I do not know the rules. Yesterday I sold this stock at 14.67, only to regret it, since it rose another 3.5%. But today I certainly do not regret that choice. I've been following the stock for some time now as a long, and I have doubled my savings doing so.. But this will be it for now. The stock has exploded in the last couple of months, and right now the Zen-hype has finally reached the last investors resulting in yesterday's spike. The threat that AMD poses to Intel has however also become aware to them, and I am sure that the savings on their products just is one of many financially tactical decisions that Intel will make use of.. Even though I'm not a fan of Intel, I most certainly am a realist, and to think that AMD suddenly will steal an incredible market share from such a financially stable competitor is just naive. Even though the stock may continue rising a couple of percent this year, I am certain that it's rapid growth is over. 700% in a year is almost to good to be true.The decision to sell my stock, however, was really hard, since I did not know where to put this money that I had made of this share. I ended up at GoPro ($GPRO) because the similar position it has in the market to AMD's position 52 weeks ago. A large brand with lack of innovation. Their stock has been receding to just 16% of it's value 2 years ago, and I believe that the tables have finally turned for them. With the now large competition in the action-camera market, they've chosen to focus on drones, which in the following years will be HUGE, since governments all around the world are investing in those. And looking for a large-scale drone purchase of a government, these government will take large note of GoPro since it is a brand known for quality and efficiency. That's it. Again, I'm not here to convince people to leave AMD behind, and I do believe that the company has a couple of pennies left for the year.. But if you (as I am) are looking for companies with big potential, then it might be time to change. And my best guess is the GoPro-stock."
"Guys , I'm just using the new hero 6 and karma , can't tell you how amazing they are , unbelievable product , this stock is really too much manipulated, also the sell off of yesterday was crazy peaple should invest in GoPro is crazy undervalue , should be minimum 14 !!! I hope after the earnings we could see it!!"
It appears Gopro is finally going somewhere up with a buy out soon. Great!!!
I’m praying for woody to say block chain
"GoPro Possible Buyers 5Garmin (GRMN) might be interested to buy GoPro.If GPRO is still traded at $93.70, GRMN might not be interested to purchase GPRO.However, when GPRO is at price of $6 ~ $9, it means GPRO is traded below 10% of GPRO all time high, GRMN might be quite interested in acquiring GPRO. These 2 company's products have some common ground. It could all be installed into a moving object, including car, bus, aircraft, ship, etc. When GRMN and GPRO merged, the new company could be the winner in both GPS and Action Camera markets."
up up up
DJEL' You should have listen to the presentation at Wells fargo 3-2-20
"GOPRO DOWN BIG IN PRE-MARKET. Why? Because those who understand that GoPro cannot be trusted just yet did some smart profit taking if they had bought under $9 and now, with manipulation, the market is correcting a bit. There is no reason to think that Q4 will be beating any estimates and Q1 will be in the red too. Karma will not have new features, most likely, and the holiday season where they thought they would sell it is long gone. Plus, Karma is already behind in terms of some basic technology that drone users want. But hey, if some of you want to ignore the facts, it's ok. That is what makes America great. There is a sucker born every minute and someone else knows how to separate them from their money. Would you stay with a spouse who lies and disappoints as consistently as Woodman and GoPro? If yes, well, that's a ""you"" problem. Think about it. ""I'm sorry I hit you again, honey, I promise it's the last time. Please take me back, I love you!"""
Super nice deal for HERO6 (six)$399 use Amazon’s mistake to your advantage. It’s $499 everywhere else.https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-CHDHX-601-HERO6-Black/dp/B074X5WPC5
"According to Yahoo there is still HUGE short interest on GPRO, 25% of float. We haven't even begun to see the short squeeze! :-)"
Buy Cryptos and sell GPRO.
"O Craigeo, Craigeo, wherefore art thou, Craigeo?? Deny thy folly and refuse thy Finance board trolling. Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn gone forever, and I'll no longer expose thy bullschyte."
"Now is the time to buy big. With the new Hero 9. GOPRO can ship new cameras to beat forecast and move beyond $5/share. If they miss forecast with new product, big big problems...... buy today."
Chinese made cameras will be taxed at 25% meaning DJI will lose American market and would not be able to compete with GoPro in American market. I don’t think DJI will have much success with their action cam . But we will see how it goes for them .
Is Nick Woodman related to Bernie Madoff?
I told u stay away going to red now is in red zone going 3.70 today hahaha
the stock hasn't moved as much today
Gopro stock needs some kind good news. Mainly with management changes or BO
"Clearly reversal to downside . From after hour earning high of $7.40 + to Friday sub $6.50 . This new cheaper camera products reduce the profit margin. . It’s a sell now , I was out at $6.75"
"Google clips is not even an action camera, it’s funny how market reacts without even checking the facts. If any camera with cheap price would kill GoPro it would have been Xiaomi Yi, which actually is a decent action camera, not some portable gif maker"
"GPRO reported a 34% spike in rev & a narrower-than-expected loss of just 9cents a share. Wall Street had targeted a 25 cent per share loss. What’s even more impressive is that not only did GoPro cut operating costs by more than 36%, it also slashed its inventory by 39%. am I missing something? am I not reading the ER right? When will the manipulation end? Eventually the stock will GoUp..."
Im currently in Austria. Most of the tech stores here sell GoPro and they are happy with sales. GoPro has a great potential overseas as well.
Time to Short this or wait til Monday ??
Why the sudden drop in the last 2 days when the most recent bad news was aired 3 weeks ago?
"Last week I went out on a limb, said I thought something's up, and had a nice conversation with Olivia. I'll take my chances and go out on that same limb. I'm not suggesting anything big is happening (such as Woodman leaving), but somebody knows something, and I'm guessing earnings will be as expected or better. Volume doesn't justify a huge announcement, but someone in the dark would be a fool to buy that heavily in the mid-sevens, which is where we opened this morning. After hours was also huge, but not overwhelmingly so. It could also be the reveal of a new product, soon to be debuted, or a new relationship with some other company. To the naysayers, GoPro may be down, but they're far from circling the drain. I welcome your thoughts."
Latest Hero now available on GoPro.com
"Rising with heavy volume. MACD, Stochastic oscillator and RSI go green, according to stoxline. Would like to see a move above 8.16."
BENZINGA IS REPORTING OF CHATTER ABOUT RUMOR OF MICROSOFT M&A FOR GPRO
From the Volume of trades Id say most have placed their bets.
Nick said there is high demand for GoBroke cams at the right price... 99 cents USD for Hero 6 Black is the price point
can someone tell me what the company is predicting for gross sales 2021? I know they said they expected 25% increase ...... over what number?
"Ohh Man...the big short is over, buying every drop from here! Buyout coming, lower the cost under $3"
"GPRO products are for people who ""wants"", not people who ""need"", but the new Fusion is so good, people will really ""need"" it for 360 shots."
It's obvious big money purposely brought this stock down to LOAD UP. Short squeeze is coming and GOPRO will beat earnings. Don't follow the band wagon bashers. This stock has another run in it before the sell. Load up folks! $$$$$
Gopro can't get out of it's own way.
Does anyone think the GoPro name is worth anything?
"Good opportunity for all this big companies FB,AAPL,GOOG,Amazon,Garmin,Canon"
"I'm holding, it will be 12 bucks upon the buyout announcement."
Can we get a miracle tomorrow??
"Cameras have become a commodity, and my two year old cellphone has 12mp GoPro is a great camera, but not the only great camera.."
"previous Q was great and market appreciate with price raise to $7.5 guideline was great for 2019 we are now weeks before second Q with announcement business was deteriorated , someone can explain why its trading now $5.4 30% less than after first Q release ???????"
Great chance now
"Woody Dude: This has been a ""Narly Ride"", dude! How about taking that surfboard of yours out to the beach, retire, and let someone with his feet on terra firma lead the company before we ALL wipe out?Cowabunga!"
GoPro will unveil the Karma drone on September 19th
DJI is a Chinese company. The only real GoPro competitor to come along(Yi a joke)is a Chinese based corporation. Tariffs will make their competition impossible. GoPro has moved all production to Mexico for North American bound devices. India will be the Asian base along with Vietnam. Chinese consumer is toast.
"All you bald genius shorts are about to get crushed. Gopro is consolidating and coiling w/ UPward pressure . Cover or commit suicide either way ,ITS CHRISTMAS AND GOPRO PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUT, we GOPRO LONGS WIN . GoPro bears areWRONG."
Craig Classic!! Say it ain't true!! I went and put all my assets on your advice!!!!
"Gpro has good products, but does not seem to understand how to properly execute. Hey here is our newest product. But the added features we promised won't be available until next year!"
My only concern is analysts expect higher than GoPro forecast high end of $310 M. Even if GoPro announces revenue on the high end it stilll may not be enough
GoPro has been hiring people in software department . I believe some thing new is coming.
"Couple of factors for short term investors. there is a Golden cross coming, then we have MACD cross over of 50 day over 200 day, Stochastic strength getting positive. RSI is getting over 65 again and most of all GPRO is in upward trend now. one more factor is shorts covered a little of their positions. these point to 8-10$ price soon."
American Bulls ratesGPRO a strong BUY.Brand new upgrade!
"Leka said GPRO should be $35 by March 2018. Mark it! LOLGeez, how much money did that kid lose on GPRO?! yikes."
"Another week has come and gone. The worst two words for GoPro share holders?""Temporarily Unavailable"""
GoPro Corporation needs proper LEADERSHIP besides a leading action-camera.
When we hit $3.50 today .. I'll buy the board a round a drinks ....
"It will be interesting to see if Woodman lowered the bar far enough. If he starts talking about a Hero 7 being yet another turnaround product, head for the hills. It seems that Woodman does not get that the general public does not need or want his $400 action camera. He has been saying the same thing since the IPO at $24."
Woodman just said that the company is for sale on MSNBC
$6.66 oh boy
Mikey said the same thing about JC Penny and look what happened there.... dufus.....
just grab 2k shares. holding my breath.
They had a pretty good guidance for a company in their position. They expect growth from 2017.
"Wow, look at that short squeeze and the huge line of major companies just jumping to acquire GoPro."
Hey am late to the party here...is it still early?
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131768-gopros-holiday-quarter-trouble
What's driving it?
"GPRO opens at 9.18, climbs to 9.45, then dips to 9.02 all in one day, and with no news from the company. Is there anyone here who thinks GPRO ISN'T being manipulated - for now??"
red ....hahahaha
YOLO BRRRR WSB THIS IS MASSIVELY SHORTED!
"Currently there is no reason for merging with this company. Its management has proven not to be credible. I see in this page a considerable number of trolls, such as Craig, Sam, etc., people likely embittered by early stock purchase or premature stock sale. However, positive revenue growth and profitability are achievable before the end of 2018. Three reasons: costs reductions, adjusted pricing, and GoPro Fusion 360. Turnaround is indeed a thing, and although much slower than what anticipated, during Q4 2018 or Q1 2019 GoPro may see it. Due to its high volatility, I would not recommend to have new positions for this stock. Nevertheless, it is probably close to the bottom and it has a high potential of growth. This is the reason why selling at current price levels (5.57 USD) is probably a mistake."
What’s a realistic price target for GoPro after next quarter earnings?
"13% short of float. GPRO need ""Reddit Army"""
What happened to all the little shorty trolls that non stopped spammed ... BYE
"This is most certainly a buy as most people know. The evidence is there of at least doubling your money if you hold at least a year. I have some money in it, but not much. If I could afford more, I would buy more. Opportunities like this don't come around often, but they do come up. This is one of them."
It's going to 10 very soon
Zach's. STRONG BUY
"Live feed from CES 2017 on ENGADGET:Friday Jan 6, 11:15-11:30am PT Nick Woodman on how GoPro moves forward after an eventful 2016.GOPRO! GOPRO! GOPRO! GO UP! GO UP! GO UP!"
53% short volume . Candles point to another rally soon.
"Still way under valued. See what happens with full year profit forecast, cash retained, combined with profitable growth and operational excellence. On the move big time........No way would GOPRO sell for $14/share."
"I don't even expect GoPro to grow, I am just waiting for stocktraders to realize that its undervalued as it is right now. Apple had stiff competition too, but their branding kept them at the lead, just like GoPros brand is ultra strong. People don't even use the word ""action-cam"", they say ""GoPro"", it's that strong. Growth is a plus for my play, especially since they reorganized for healthy earnings."
Three white soldiers...thank you very much.
The UFO's like GoPro!
Videos of the Day.
CRAY CRAY.. Just got filled an entire 20k shares long ..6.35 and below after Market... lol..This does not get easier then this. Easy 30 cents tomorrow.. if not a buck...

Bloomberg Woodman interview; Wood is talking growth and profitability-Buy Buy Buy!
going up??
"should partner snap, both seem a camera company, no?"
https://gopro.com/news/gopro-unlocks-mobile-overcapture-experience-for-fusion-camera
Go go pro!
Any idea of the release date of the 360 Fusion camera?
Last week the earnings date was 11-1 now its 11-5 what’s up with this
"Went to Best Buy and they had only four Hero 6, but 40 Hero 5’s. Is Hero 6 selling that well or channel supply limitation to lower inventory of the 5."
SQUEEZE THEM !!!!!
Is no one posting or is the silence because YAHOO turned it's computerized remark maker off?
New to Gopro curious if you guys feel this $7.00 is a decent entry point
"SARWAR: Happy New Year, you old fart. I've said it before and I'll say it again...I have 4 letters for you...CYDY. I bought a year ago at $.335 and it closed 2020 at $5.39 And by the end of January, early Feb, should easily be close to $10 based on results that are about to be released for their phase 3 Covid trial for their drug leronlimab (Vyrologix). I know, I know...you have too much pride to check it out, but to anyone else reading this, Google the company (CytoDyn) and their drug. I'll check in again soon with share price updates. GPRO has NOTHING when it comes to potential like CYDY does."
You forgot one: Craig also said that he is some big shot lawyer! Circa about 1.5 years ago.
"Longs are desperate. Many are underwater from $50 which was not too long ago. Central in the longs' mind is the right to at least break even. This ""right"" does not exist so the best we can do is to post encouraging messages such as:A buy-out from Apple will happen just after CES at $50 ps.Woodman is going to implement a huge stock buybackThe country of Lower Slobovia has named the Hero as the action camera of their country.The NASDAQ will force all GPRO shorts to cover.Woodman is going to co-market his cameras with cannabis or other shyt. All of the above is genuine BS. But it will make the longs feel better about their investment in GPRO."
"Profitable company with no debt, strong brand, over 1B in revenue, trading at 1.5B market cap.While we have snapchat IPO at 38B market cap with no revenue."
Finally in the 9ths. will se 17-18$ in few months
Brilliant move tying discount to plus subscription. I just upgraded from the 7 to the 9 with some new accessories. GPRO is back. Going to be a huge holiday season. $15 by EOY 
Could be the best write off of the year. A million years ago they would have called this a rock on a stick. So really nothing new here.
"Here we go, big institutions are starting to buy before earnings. The stock should be trading around $6 by end of February."
comin' back!
"I love when this stock price skyrockets like it did today. . . except I think it's a bad idea to buy today! So, CRAIG, I did not buy too many shares today. Don't worry, I'm still making money."
Short it now then BIG MOUTHS
"Chart is setting up nicely, good consolidation in the $12 range with a new bottom being $8..... this either runs up to $15 ore-earnings or explodes up if this tight $12 range holds going into earnings..... but this bodes well for the rest of the year as others have noted. The sunglasses product release puzzles me - where is the fanfare for a new product? Why is this being kept a secret. I still say GoPro need to figure out how to monetize traffic to its app/site OR.... partner with an entity that knows how to make the GoPro videos a hotspot for social media destination.... if the user base is there, the money will eventually flow.... this is why I would like to see a partnership or an acquisition (either GPRO acquires, or it sells to a social media darling)"
"GoPro Fusion on sale for first time since launch. $100 off at Best Buy right now, it's already a high gm% product so perhaps they're making a sales push with the GoPro Mountain Games going on and summer break around the corner!"
Camera on a stick
Those of you who don’t know math let me explain before you sell your shares. The Mexican tarriffs is only 5% compared to Chinese 25%. What would you buy DJI over paying 20% or GoPro paying -20%? I think I would go with the saver with better quality . So chill it’s not just time to sell these shares .
GoPro is screaming buy buy buy from every angle now . Institutions hold a good chunk of this now . Shorts have 2 months to cover or see you at 15$ soon without your shorties 
PIG POS
GoPro is up 10.37% to 9.15
Well hello there 12 I haven't seen you since October of 2016.
The GPRO pps is up for a very good reason. The product is both viable and desirable.
GPRO will be going up until earnings.. Should be great!!!! New Product accesories have been rolling out and selling out right away. THey have changed this from an action camera to an every day camera with there editing software.I do not want to put my $1000 iphone in arms way taking photos when it comes to many activities especially when so many have Crypto Currency now and would hate to lose or break their phones.. Yeah photos go to the cloud for most but getting back your cryptos will take lots of time if you should lose your phone. GPRO is a changed model and even Woodman will be annoyed that his Portfolio Manager told him to sell some of his shares months back... Watch out... I truly think now is a great time.If your trading it I don;t know but thru the 4th quarter its an easy 50% plus. I can go on and on
"Interesting that this is one of the big movers today, yet no one news coverage is acknowledging this. Insiders know something"
Red again today...how long will the bleeding last for?
"@craig LOL...LOL..and to think you weren’t only skipping the long trade, you went short...LOL"
4.00-4.50 tomorrow. Market hates Woodman and rightfully so...
Please explain why I should not short this stock right now
"Some dude said on the discussion board on YouTube that he can use Mavic pro as a handheld camera device, just like go pro!!! I haven't had such a good laugh in a while."
"What GoPro has going for it are a couple of very strong things. They've got a great brand, and they have excellent international retail distribution. What they are lacking is the ability to maximize this. They need to leverage their distribution and brand to sell other video items outside of their basic sports camera lineup. Video security, dash cams, body cams are just a few of the areas where they could move into....and likely will. Karma was the wrong move. But the category as a whole -- personal video -- has a lot of future potential. Don't be surprised to see upcoming announcements. Glad to see they are shoring up their financials. They're certainly down...but don't count them out just yet. Hopefully they make the management changes they truly need to make."
I hope some one buy this company
GoPro's uptrend resumes.... next stop $17!
Bankruptcy announcement at CES?
Did any of you sell?
Look at the chart. 1 Day 1 Week 1 Month 3 Months 6 Months 1 Year ALL RED. Short this trash can and make your money back. Another way to make it back is go to AMD/INTEL/NVIDIA our future.
"The all-time high GoPro stock closing price was 93.85 on October 07, 2014. what happened? looks like there are hundreds of cheaper camera options on eBay and Amazon with similar specifications. good day trading stock. someone convince me how this company can really grow in next 2-3 years with so many cheaper options. all the execs have cashed out over the years. if no groundbreaking innovations and products, this will likely be flat or drop in next few years."
This company is disappointing to say the least.
"Earnings report is going to show positive guidance, next day they will announce buyout"
"thestreet.com thinks that snapchats ugly glasses that will record 10 second clips and upload them instantly to the web is the reason GoPros stock dropped today, clearly they are not very bright."
Buy out from Arby’s coming soon
BAHAHAHAAHAHAHA
"LEKA, enjoy your cost average when this goes to $4"
"What interests me most about the Karma news is that they mentioned that updated features will be available via updates, which to me means follow me features and others that are currently lacking. Whats also interesting is that the stock didnt pop at 10am when the news broke. Maybe because it was expected tomorrow anyways?"
Gopro is a prime candidate for acquisition. Their technology is far superior to others within that space. Sophisticated drones designed for markets like agriculture or search and rescue MUST have reliable and flexible cameras. They need to be capable of withstanding severe weather and patented stabilization within the camera itself. Companies in need of this technology will “lock-in” supply chains similar to how Apple does it. Ironically another great example is how GoPro used Ambarella chips. Those guys tanked when GoPro shopped around for another supplier. Nowadays It’s cheaper for someone to buy the technology versus source it and therefor risking the supply chain. I’m holding until they are acquired or they hit $.00001/ share.
"Remember when the loser creator of GoPro was on Shark Tank acting ""successful""? sad"
The announcement is on Friday
The good news is when Nick declares BK he will allow BK proceedings to be filmed on GoPros.
Building a base
Hero 6 is now selling on Amazon for $399.99. It will be interesting to see how well it sells now.
"I think we are likely to head to 7.50 but after I don't see any reason why we won't be heading back up, similar to what happened back in June when it reached the mid $7 range"
This should go green. Dismal Q4 already priced in to the stock.
google will buy gopro
GoPro had 89% of the market and still lost money. No wonder nobody else wants to entire this market. It’s failed market.
hi guys what are the expectations from results ?
Paid bashers on this site screaming GPROBULLISH.
STRONG SALES FOR CONSECUTIVE WEEKS WILL PUT THIS STOCK IN THE SKY
Great ER but it is not going up!
LOOK OUT $20.00 HERE WE COME. THIS GO PRO STOCK IS ON A ROCKET.
"Hey, Woody and team...."
"don't be scared...stay with this company, stock will pop-up next week after earnings!"
Did Craig change his id and become bullish on GPRO yet? lol
Limit order just filled at 4.00. Looks like a BUY here. When this stock moves...it really moves fast on high volume. Someone big is trading so hopefully a pop back above 4.50 will be quick. Again.
Never break the golden rule about staying clear of investing in companies with a shady CEO. I went against that and did it with this one a while back as a spec play and it held true once again. I feel for the people who invested a lot of money in this horribly run company.
"The MSNBC analyst Najairian or what ever his name is gave the worst piece of analysis I've ever heard for today's pop. He said that management has cut the workforce by 12% therefore this stock has increased to where it should be, up 14%. It won't go higher than $9. MSNBC, please hire me. The requirement consists of talking out of your #$%$ Never have I heard of a dumber reason than that. Absolutely terrible and my ten year old could come up with that."
I like how it's holding today.
What does this lawsuit mean for the stock price?? Thanks guys
6-7$ by today buy buy and buy
Definitely hoping for some good news
Buying on momentum/ volume final half hour!
"The numbers are still horrible. But hey, at least they beat on revs! I wonder how sustainable selling off the drone inventory and discounted cameras will be. Hint - its not. LOLFor Leka, I guess it is ""2019 is all that matters"" now instead of his EOY spam. LOL"
"No News! Price goes up, Strange!"
"I had a chance to sell this turd at $17, but I listening to the people who said it would never see below $14. Thankfully I sold at 11.75. Don’t listen to anyone on this forum, this turd is a sinker"
"On an unscientific quest, I queried the Best Buy rep in the photo department of their Burbank (California) store. ""GoPro camera sales are excellent,"" he reported. ""The Karma, though, while having its advantages, is fighting a tough battle with DJI, especially the Mavic."" Nothing new here, although I am surprised at his enthusiasm for the camera sales. I encourage others to do their own investigating. Results may vary."
Good time to buy in ? I see nothing be positive chats here
I am buying 100 shares hoping to get a price 10. Thats 30%!
WOW!!!!
"Im all in!!!!! 15,780 shares and HOLD until $10+"
Up up!
Dam I hate to say this but I'm selling all my gopro shares not going just take my loss
"If WSB was coming for GPRO why would they comment on the feed? Besides, there’s only 3 people saying it. No one on reddit has mention GPRO."
Checking to see if rumor of AAPL interest in GPRO M&A?Anyone else hear this?
Jan 11 10:30am 3.9 million shares already traded and SP keeps popping higher on limited news. Can somebody tell me what is the catalyst?
"From MarketWatch: But GoPro is now a slow-growth company that is winning through cutbacks and expense controls. If its single-digit revenue growth does not pan out as it hopes, it has few levers left to pull. In this cutthroat industry, where GoPro’s rivals include smartphone cameras, investors can never get too hopeful or complacent about turnarounds, as a niche business can become quickly obsolete."
how is Nick private yacht coming along?
10$+ EASY NEXT WEEK
Where are all the shorts ? Can you short this again ? Please please
https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/gopro-quik-app-attack/amp/
I hope shorts covered yesterday. The stock will trade between $6 and $7.50 until the next earnings. There won't be a cheaper opportunity to cover before then.
"SARWAR! Happy Thanksgiving, wherever you are."
Serious question ....Where are Go Pro camera's made?
"Want to see a GoPro killer, watch this video about the Revl Arc Camera. No need for a gimbal since the stabilization is built-in. Maintains the horizon when bungee jumping, sky diving, even a spinning tire. It also uses A.I. to automatically edit hours of video to find the best minutes."
"Headlines MOTLEY FOOL 14hrs ago :""APPLE SHOULD BUY GOPRO "" Wow imagine that?! That's what people are saying and yes I may have mentioned similar thoughts...$GOPRO in the $40s 2018 without APPLE !GOPRO $25 ps APPLE BO offer 2017 ? Nope LONG GOPRO to the $50s then ATH.Really...."
Gopro just delivered 97 million $ free cash flow this quarter. if trend continues into 2021 then gopro is very cheap below 12-15$.way undervalued with so much growth prospect. buy buy buy. just so you guys know tech stock trade at more than 30 times free cash flow. while if this trend continues gopro trades at 5-6 times future cash flow. way undervalued per my calculations. short will get hammered. if you are short don't have much time get out.
Dustin don't ask why. Just thank the good LORD it is on its way to GLORY with the investors.
Traded all my shares for GBTC
Down again today! When will the short squeeze start?
surfer bro #$%$ going to 0!!!!!!
Facebook/Oculus or google will get it
Going to $12.00 - $15.00 in next year .Double my money.
"what should worry you most is that revenue was down over 220M in Q4 and then still down 10M in Q1. If gopro demand was still strong they wouldnt miss that big in q4. They also should have seen added q1 revenue from customers that were maybe waiting for the typical price drop, but they didnt. They blamed drone sales in q1 but they also gained suscription revenue (typical gpro management deflection) so it's worrisome to say the least. GoPro has ambitious suscriber growth forecast for the year and honestly in surprised how many they have this far too. All companies are shifting to suscriber revenue streams to balance their revenue. I would wait for another ER of bad sales. Then you may get an entry price that matches the risk involved in this stock. Still too many gopro hopefuls laying around propping up the price. This company will only succeed through future products if they connect directly to social media or streaming. Why anyone would own this stock before GoPro releases such a product isn't fair to themselves. The products gopro currently sells are in a shrinking market, as well as declining Average Selling Prices. If you expect a turnaround with this current camera line up I would highly suggest asking yourself if there might be another option other than gopro for the time being."
"Woodman stresses 'partnerships' and seems to say 'standalone' did not work out.He says more business model optimization/growth just in camera... Hmm...Looks like some partner asked Gopro to prove it can be focussed on camera and software, subscriptions as the business model and show margins. There might be a promising product that may be in the cards to interest that partner...His facial expression seems to indicate some truth to it and his leaning towards partner shows some confidence...(sorry that's my read and btw I am not a fan of how woodman managed it so far).130k subscribers without pitching subscription it seems... I would not be surprised if the content channel comes back on. Either he is clueless or is re-inventing for a better model: we will see in the next 3 months. Given all this, there may be less downside risk than upside potential at this point.Btw, this stock is highly manipulated. Two observations based on past data:1. In most cases, shorts attack when mkt goes up (safest short given its low volume); when mkt goes down, there are usually better ROI candidates to short than this... There is enough confidence/support for this pattern, look back in history. All of it is predicated on 'low' volume days.2. There is a second pattern on breaking-support levels (7.5, 6.12, then 5.7). I was surprised that Gopro was unshaken with mkt drops last week but now it may be the only one that dropped/stayed so (while mkt recovered so well). Seems to be a trading stock (although so far trend has been down but might reverse soon given there is some strategic less-risky shift into software and subscription)."
GoPro! GoPro! GoPro! Good going Nick... Keep it going!!!
C'mon C'mon GPRO GIVE US $20.00 PLEASE. We have been waiting a long time. We know you can do it. THANK YOU JESUS.
Buying on the dip

"shorts are not pilling meaning the market thinks GPRO still has room to run however latest behavior where its cant break and sustain $ 9 suggesting something real has to open to convince market to break through $12 , lets hope ER will convince"
The only good that will come of this is Woodman finally realizing he needs to hire a real CEO. Woodman has his optimistic vision for this company but he can’t keep reaffirming guidance as he just did a few months ago and then lower again. GoPro will be sued for that one...and lose that suit. Woodman can remain board chairman and run around the world building his vision(which is a plus) and leave running a real company to a real seasoned CEO. Any day now new management will be announced and lift stock back to 5.00.
"Interesting action this morning. If you take a good look at the charts, you'll notice there has been some heavy blocks of selling, but several heavy blocks of buying, one at 78.1K and another at 50.6K. This could preclude some good news. Whether it will move the needle is another story."
"Thurs. we Slap that troll silly.. Eat it Craig and I'll film you (using my new GoPro HERO6 ) in slow motion eatingshat !! Imagine that, filming Craig the GoPro troll eatingshat ; LIVE FEED ON FACEBOOK LIVE. Watch it all the rest of 2017 on YouTube and GoPros own QUICKSTORIES. Eatshat Craig."
"no resistance to the upside, shorts will be smart and cover their positions , a gap-up is coming, go long gopro near $11.25 put Good till filled limit orders in to sell at $30 for 30days so your shares can not be shorted, if you own gopro already put Good till filled limit orders in to sell at $30 for 30days so if your brokerage shorted you your shares or shorted your shares they will be forced to cover because you have called them to market."
Yes beat!
GoPro finally broke out of trading range . All the shorts will see is 12$ soon 
When will GoPro will go up?
"As everyone expected, up"
Why what happened to the shorts ? Why aren’t they shorting so the price goes down ?

"Remember GPRO at $90 post IPO? EGLT news out, technically Bullish..."
Why is it up 10%
Bankruptcy announcement VERY SOON!
Buyout needs to be in the $11-12 range.
Do I sell my shares for a loss or wait for a potential buy out? Thoughts?
Woodman will announce he is looking to sell the the company. Stock jumps. At least in a fantasy world that i wish i lived in.
$AAOI $AMD $NVDA $SNAP $SQ $AAPL $MSFT $GPRO MOVE TO $SNCR!!! Insanely undervalued stock with huge upside potential. It will be trading above $25.00 in few days!!!
"Christmas rally incoming! Black Friday and Cyber Monday are next week. Products are HOT! Get in before the institutions start gobbling up shares in this turnaround company. Positive notes:*There is 23%+ short interest.*There is ONLY 60% institutional ownership.*The company is becoming profitable.*The company is GROWING.*Consumer reviews are the best ever and consumer demand is strong!* The new initial product sales eclipsed previous product offerings!*The company subscription program is growing 66%+ YoY (less seasonal revenue effect and growth)* The low current market cap makes it a buyout candidate; there is strong value in Gopro's tech, employees, brand, and data which can easily integrate and find synergy at another company."
Take a look a the tips they have to offer. I’ve already made $500+https://www.bullishcharts.com/
"Craig will post , here you go now after dropping below 4$ for a little while "
"Well, I was expecting a drop of some kind today"
This is the enduring tale of this stuck... The only thing it does consistently is loose money. it has no ability to gain traction and advance two or three days in a row no matter the news. I'm hitting the snooze button as apparently most on this stock board have done. There has to be a strategy to redeem lost time somehow......
Once I break even with this #$%$ will never go back to buy shares or product.company is a scam!!!!!!
"Can't really do it , it's so sad to see that for this stock it's hard to make a day of recovering like +0,50 , it's strange a pop to 10,15 and then down down down , can't really understand it , btw the enthusiasm for the new product was 0 , this is incredible , I think the new product are amazing and the company is facing a year of good recovery, so why is not going back to 14?."
Wow 5.5+ m volume
Hero 8 black ready for order at Best Buy with delivery by 10/21 also months amazon with delivery by 10/31. Only delay seems to be the mod and it’s accessories that do define the new design shouldn’t effect sales over next couple months.

"GoPro s next Hero6 8k ""the Legend""?"
All this sell off just for a #$%$ google not real competitor ? Do this market really hate GoPro stock ?
"InvestorPlace more fake journalism. Vince Martin claims GoPro is a $6 stock.. If that is true, then Market cap would be approx. $780m, with $1.3b in sales and earnings of $7.00 share and minimal debt. Investor place has a programmed rolling GoPro bashing. Third journalist to bash GoPro this month. No credit and these guys are not analysts. What a joke"
for me there is no significant reason to sell my gpro shares and I will keep holding my shares. My goals are different than day traders no day trader or short should tell me what to do with my investment. If you bought it at 90$ I am sorry it was never worth that much. Even now you will lose on not buying and for listening to manipulators. Good thing I don’t get manipulated easily .
24% short and growing
go pro 7 game changer - everyone is going to buy now- buy this stock make lots of money money!
Also buy Micron technology below 60$ is heading for 100$ Next year .
"I'm impressed with today's movement back into solid green. I'll admit I had been on the sidelines for a while prior to the bad-news in early Jan... Bought back in earlier this week and then more yesterday before the close. Feels like that was teh right time to get back in. If they are successful in expanding their consumer base with new products that have more mass market appeal, it's going to be a big deal for the company..."
This is clearly the worst trading decision I ever made. This stock has no bottom... never had on. the only predictable trend is lower lows! So frustrated!!!!
"Told you so, dbag longs: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-cuts-200-300-jobs-013155043.html"
"Quick question.... I’m not a sophisticated investor, so generally to try to buy what’s popular at the moment, a little after GOPROs ipo I bought at $91 a share, how long do you think it will take to get back to the $90s? I’d like to sell my position to buy more bitcoin but don’t want to take a loss. Do you think I’ll have to wait more than 3 months for it to get back to 90?"
be strong and hold everyone. this temp sell off is nothing to fear.
Time to cash OUT.MIME ready to SOAR!
GPRO is down 5.85% to 3.80
CEO is a disaster. We will see 5 today.
If GPRO rose from $8-$9 range to $16-$17 over Karma optimism....reasonable to me it will again.
"If you're smart, you'd load up on this discount. GPRO is headed up after earnings!!!"
Dear father.....$10.00Amen
The fall of the stock. What a mass of frustrated! Bye forever
"I have 700 in my saving account can’t touch that total networth about 12,000"
The new GoPro sleeve + lanyard is already out of stock after releasing it 3 days ago
For whatever reason I refuse to let go of this!!!!

"Thank God!Now, we can start making some real money off of this awesome brand presence."
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 6.72
"Good news didn't last long? I'm buying when the dust settles, and waiting for next pop.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gopro-stock-surges-after-results-come-in-better-than-feared-2019-11-07?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo"
"""Facebook interested in GoPRO"" considering a parternship not a buyout....mark my words..."
why this doesn't go up it should be 8 $ at less
Woody has no mercy for shareholders.
What a fall for this POS! from $96 to $4.54! there's more room at the bottom!
Remember - Christmas is coming.
Loading up and waiting for CES. Right time to announce cooperation with Canon. https://www.canonrumors.com/canon-to-partner-with-gopro-in-some-capacity-cr0/
Big boys return from lunch shortly...expectNEXT LEG UP.LEVEL TWO STRONG!!
Feb 4 is the game changer...years of pain followed by the gains.
Hmmm. Toughie. Go with Craig's novice msg board advice or Blackrock's proven professional track record. I think I'll go with Blackrock on this one.
LETS RIDE TO $12!!!
Hold for the long haul folks - this is definitely a contrarian investment. Let the price recover close to $10 (yes it may take 2 years) and then hang on in hopes of an acquisition
"Wasn't long ago that run ups (or downs for that matter) indicated news breaking ahead of public disclosure. Now one has to factor in the potential for a GME effect.Either way, Love it....having bot a few shares back in the 8s. Earnings release will be telling.LG"
Gopro to $30
Triple bottom ThursdayRSI: 25-30FLASHING GREEN!!
gopro is on fire as it's going much much HIGHER!
Checked to see if any inside buying filings have occurred and don’t see any. This concerns me but maybe not that unusual? I would love to buy the stock today especially since they had a successful CES display and the stock is near all time lows.
Attractive entry level
still a long way up but good luck to who is holding...
Wow first time gpro has been up on the year in 5 yrs / the only problem is the 5yr return is negative 90 percent .. great going woody
"wow wow wow, 0.94% PM ? nahh i dont believe it, will fall anyway"
"odd thing i see here. a lot of institutions have increase their stake in gopro, approx 2-3 times. also, neither woodman or anyone else sold a share. it is really interesting to me. i think something is cooking behind the scenes."
Got out @ $8.60. Was expecting this to break $10 by now. It doesn’t. I decided to sell it and buy back at lower later. COVID is worsening and travel is not going up pick up soon.
TOMORROW 6.50$- EASY
"Up as much as the Nasdaq today? The tell will be the next time the Nasdaq is down, what will GoPro do. Risk needs to be rewarded here, or everyone should just go buy the QQQ"
"Short-squeeze comes to TSLA, will arrive on GPRO too, 10$ is easy to reach!"
added more at 6.20..let see
"I guess shorts panicked, pumped this to 6.40 by covering, and now they figured out it was suppose to come down anyway...I was wondering why its going up if they still loss money."
get ready for some news
Nice to see Karma Flight Kit is selling on GoPro.com as of today. During Feb 1 Karma press release they communicated it would launch some time in April.Hoping this is one of many future promises that actually get delivered.
"we all complain about foreign products, made in china, made in mexico, DO NOT BUY unless made in USA, BUY GOPRO"
Just bought another 10k shares
"Blackrock, GOPRO BOOM.Buy now. You too tiny troll."
"GoPro coming out with a cheap new camera without 4K would be like Tesla coming out with a new, cheaper car that doesn't have wheels. Another GoPro FAIL."
Forward Guidance would be great as gpro is not dependent on China anymore and they should exaggerate the fact in their Call !
fade into the 5's today - WATCH!
Why spend extra couple hundred dollar for a camera when you have Iphones that do everything not just camera?
"Didn’t expect the swoon to under $4, should have picked up a few thousand so I’d be even now. At least it’s headed in the right direction."
Craig cares a lot about me tbh
"GoPro Possible Buyers 3Microsoft (MSFT) might be interested to buy GoPro:Comparing with Apple, Microsoft has less hardware business. By acquiring GoPro, Microsoft will be increasing its participation on hardware products. Most families in the world have PC and/or notebook with Windows OS. GoPro Action or Motion camera could be one/multiple devices associated with PC and/or notebook. After integrating GoPro Action or Motion camera with PC and/or notebook with Windows OS, GoPro camera will be much powerful when its images can be easily posted by Skype, wordpress.com, and so on. This might be a win-win solution."
"C'mon - what ""fuher"" and ""Craig"" are on about is merely the ups and downs of GPRO in the daily stock market....not GoPro itself. Just look at the general FACTS about the company. When the manipulative market bullsh smoke clears, this one will be going up....and up."
gaining momentum
Buy Buy Buy
"It doesn’t make sense to sell now. I am sure someone will offer atleast what it is trading now. Considering the worst case, why sell? On the plus side, I might get $10.Let us see"
so it is not that bad after all. closer to profitability. everyone knew that Q4 will be a miss... so any share price drop from here is irrelevant
Canon will buy GoPro. On the prowl
GoPro is being acquired in the next 12 days
Just watched the CNBC segment with Nick's smug mug in the top right. Do you think people who got in at 60 (not me) are smiling? So dumb. Put a serious look on your face and get to work dumbarse. Complete tool.
"Sick of day trading for the last couple weeks, ready to join the longs campaign start from tomorrow."
Gopro next to fly. Buy now till 8.42. Sell 9.52
Best Buy has a secret crush on GoPro. Any possibilities there?
"Welcome to your new 52 week low. Great investment, right?"
why are spammers trying to destroy the stock thread
NEW FLOOR LEKA!
This dip has nothing to do with GoPro - either as a company or a product. It's merely temporary market pps manipulation.
"GoPro is obviously a viable, and quality product. All it needs is viable management."
Won't go back to the $40's any time soon (unless bought by someone big and even then $15 might be it) but I can see $10 on the road ahead and it wouldn't surprise me if it happens sooner than you expect.
big purchase of stock is coming. Just got off the phone with my stock friend I will say. It is going higher.
Spike in volume again $6.00 coming soon
Nasdaq down (-0.60%) today and GPRO trading up on volume. Traders will always trade it up and down as is their right and proved yesterday with a precipitous fall from it's high. If you're long GPRO don't hope for one day 20% gains. Hope for steady 2-5% rips. That's the sustained growth in share price you want to see. Also you're seeing the fear of shorts in holding this into the weekend. We all know that GPRO is going to announce the 6 soon and on that day you'll see another 5-10% rip up. This is called shaking the tree. Goodluck to all. Including those simply trading it.
Load up! This is going to the moon! Wallstreetbets behind this one. Go to the YOLO feed.
"I ordered online at GoPro.com ship,met being 10/15. If you have AMEX platinum card you get $60 off when ordering 300$ or more on GoPro site. Rebate is cash back on card. Makes for a good deal for HERO 8 and 7"
Stage is now well set for the announcement. Coming soon...to be bought out by ..
it’s everyday price is red
New product rollout imminent. RAVE (p)reviews!!
Deal with AMZN and Walmart Sales Surging
"Push the ""buy American"", in light of the Chinese DJI news!"

Don’t forget that Woodman gave away 1% of the company to Monster Beverage. Another Nick nothing results
what's going on?
"$shak, $Fit, and $Gpro welcome $Snap to the club. See our message boards for therapy and guidance. Step 1: We start talking buyout to feel better."
This is company has always been a failure
"Tell tail sign..holding at sub $9....folks, it's going lower"
The GoPro website added another video
Maybe I can get out of gopro tommorow been holding for almost 2 years
citron covered their short on gpro no going after pelaton
market diwn 600+ we fought for green imagine had the market been green 2
just bought the last Hero6 available at my local Best Buy.
"Like others, I'm buying at sub $4/sh because there is value here in the name, fact that they dominate their market, and have a great product. They have enough liquidity where bankruptcy simply isn't likely to happen anytime soon, and their financials are improving. Yes - management needs to be replaced. It still kills me why they haven't released more/different products, especially since they have a strong brand name and international retail distribution. Call me crazy, but I see value at these levels. Worth the risk."
If we close near $10.60 or greater bodes well !
Tick tock craig. Nov 1 draws nearer.
"Bidding war between Enron and Worldcom for GoBroke, final offer 30 cents per share. Woody TAKE IT!"

Warned shorties to cover 3+ hrs ago.Feeling the burn?!
People are selling because they are panicking. They will deeply regret.
"Congratulations to all GPRO longs, including myself.Wow! Just woke up in Asia and found the price ending rocketing up. Analysts are never to be trusted, they write buy/hold/sell reports for a salary. Blackrock's buying is slapping hard on their faces, for those that put out sell recommendations, or kept constant negative projections on GPRO.As for poor Craig, I muted him as I found him too negatively biased. This should teach him a lesson, never read too much into analyst's reports as long as they don't own any position in a stock they reports on."
bloodbath
"Is APPLE LOOKING @ the DRONE BUSINESS?!GoPro and APPLE are the perfect match.Home security, drone up, VR/AI, media platform, USA "
Wow wow buy moment should be 12.00 soon may be afer couple days very bullish
"sneaking it's way back into the green, like a boss! GoPro's gonna kill it this year. Non-Gaap profitability in Q3, Q4 and full year profitability as a result. Then, with innovation and solid execution on strategy, never looking back...Aside from general market skepticism, I'm not sure why anyone would be selling at this point. Let's do this! ignore the naysayers."
"Craig , what is your position in GoPro stock here? Did you say, ""none""? Or you're super short and bald?! Or is it both? Haha Karma gonna get you gone or long.MerryChristmas Long GoPro-"
The trend continues gpro down 30% since November 1st and the overall market roaring with new highs almost everyday
$20.00 soon
"Now that the ""looking back"" is over and done with, we can now start looking FORWARD to a year of more activity --- and revenue."
"270 sales if posted, back to teens. One week left in quarter. Many trying keep it down. Should trade 8.50 (at least) ahead of earning."
woohoo up $0.06 lol
LEKA! GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CASH AVERAGE DOWN (AGAIN!)
"good news coming very soon ,gopro is in talks with a few people stay long you will be rewarded."
expect an upgrade within few weeks. gopro is diversifying their cash flow. they might open new social platform for sport people and others. it's a question of when not if when this thing pops. more and more people are sharing video experience. gopro has a great brand recognition and they are going to be profitable soon. look at twitter. GL
it's on fire! excited for the earnings report today.
"Don't let anyone talk you into selling your shares at this level, folks, so they can pick them up cheap."
$5 footlongs. Woody is opening a subway franchise. Now we know what he meant be Hi5 sign-off!
New 52 week low on the way ....
"Seems no bottom for Gopro unfortunately. Followed this Company for a while and saw the decline. Feel bad for the LONGS, but this is arguably one of those stocks where it could fall another 50 percent before earnings. Then I will look again. For now I am out!"
"SEC one of two investigations. This is a MAJOR firm, not some fly by night. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equity-alert-rosen-law-firm-161400417.html"
I see GPRO range bound between $6-7.50 until next quarter earnings. Trade the stock. Don't hold it.

The company already released a video showing the capabilities of the 360 degree camera and started a pilot some months ago. But GoPro doesn´t want to reveal many details on its 5.2K spherical camera yet. However, last week most of the specs already appeared on the internet after the GoPro Fusion manual was leaked and got picked up by 360 Rumors. Now, the GoPro Fusion 360 degree camera also appears in the Radio Equipment List of Canada and the National Radio Research Agency in Korea. Both show us the model number SBDC1. In addition, the documents shows us the 360° camera with incorporate both WiFi and Bluetooth technology. !"
"Will be in single digits tomorrow. Wait, it's already in single digits and going nowhere but down."
Closed my position. Feel like we’re going to trickle down to 6.50
Easy money here - unjustified drop and will grow back and bigger within the week
"$4.500 easy, week or two"
"Looking at this from a Business perspective... GoPro has been on the decline for a long time now, people usually buy cameras before they travel. The Travel sector is in the gutter now and no one is going anywhere. They keep releasing new editions of their GoPro and quite frankly no one knows the difference between the products. The reason they are up is simply because expectations were so low that they obviously had to come above it... no most, and no intrinsic value here. GoPro was at one point the goat but now they simply have a normal product with a normal company. Just look at the chart, it has to be one of the worst I have ever seen"
https://www.nmsunews.com/2018/11/15/gopro-inc-gpro-shows-signs-of-strength-ahead-earnings-season/
GOPRO WILL GO TO 2 BILLION VALUATION AFTER THIS EARNING AROUND $10 BEFORE EARNING WATCH AND LEARN SHORT COVERING AS BEGUN
"GoPro is now trying to create new products and expand as a company, not a product. This new outerwear could catch on, but it is a bit crazy to think it will bring any real numbers. BUT, they could create a “YETI” type following, which could cause customers to buy a lot of their new clothing and gear. I could see a GOPRO cooler coming...this side of the business has decent potential, but hard to see GoPro becoming a clothing brand. Still very bullish, with a $12-$16 price range."
Big run up tomorrow
buy before it starts flying ! this tax loss selling will not last forever
"CEO came to CNBC saw his stock is tanking, and now he sees that he will lose everything. And then suddenly put a PR about selling the company. Also, He owns more shares than anyone. Just be careful now"
"Absolutely criminal. I understand a pullback from highs, but -5% everyday this week. And to drive the knife in deep, Erinn Murphy makes her first appearance since the last time she drove the price down with her BS. Concern that Amazon isn't getting a shipment till the end of the month. Hmm, maybe demand was higher than expected. I guess she forgot to cover her last short position before it headed up again."
"It's funny to hear people talk about how they don't see how these cameras will continue to generate revenue, but I see them everywhere I go... they are on the slopes, on the trails, in the water, and out on the desert, even in town. Strapped down to helmets, handlebars, on the tips of skis and snowboards, surf boards, paddle boards, kayaks, and canoes, drones, on selfie sticks, tethered to people's chests harnessed on animals, and suctioned down to the hoods of cars, trucks, and OHV vehicles. A cell phone camera is great but it doesn't serve the same market or function. GoPro owns this market and is dominating it. There is profit in producing independent film, youtube is a billion dollar entity because of such filmographers, and GoPro is their tool of choice by in large. This will not change. Not only do I own and use GoPros I will continue to do so. I will aslo continue to by their products as will my friends amd colleagues who all also use GoPros exclusively.I don't believe the PPS should be 80.00 as it once was, but it certainly should be above 10.00. You can br a visionary and invest now for a healthy 40% plus return, or sit on the sidelines as this company runs back above 10.00. I'm long because I see value in market share, and their current product line which will sell above expectations as people gear up and we move into the holidays. With the tax cut most have extra money in their pockets for a vacation and accessories. GoPro is a product people will indulge in, and independent filmographers will replace old tech with new... add in the GoPro extras and we'll see better than expected sales in the foreseeable future."
When do we find out what companies are interested in buying this company

What the hell is wrong w/GPRO?!!
After hours trading today was equal to what happened in 7 hours during the day....over 2 M shares....there is something brewing.....earnings are not for awhile.
"GOPRO, like Apple makes its own processors. Chip shortage should have no affect on their ability to produce the GP line in coming quarters. That was a shrewd move. No longer reliant on Amberella for chips."
"Nicholas, regardless your efforts with new streaming announcement , unless u start buying directly new common shares u want see $ ,6 again , so far i keep my promise u better believe me"
"02/21 GPRO is going down today because the Korr letter clearly explained why the company is a complete disaster and investors are suckers (which is why insiders HAVE NOT BOUGHT A SINGLE SHARE since 2014) and all of mangement's moves have only benefitted shorts. Come on, guys...Sarwar, etc...you need to be smarter and accept what the letter says. The company COULD have value, but it clearly states ""Management should take a buyout"" and disappear."
"WELL, TIME TO BUY, 10$++ EASY!!!"
This stock has left a huge gap? With no catalyst at all. Can someone explain to me why I should buy this? It's not worth anywhere close to this value. The Daily also looks bearish.
Duct tape an inferior camera to a tree branch and you have GoPro. Going to 0.
OMG at the lawsuits...???
"Report seemed really good... Extremely positive and encouraging heading towards reopening.The subscription growth is incredible!Whatever noise happens after hours today, I'm feeling real good long term here."
"""For the milluionth time, I wish I never bought this..."" wah wah wah... perhaps you could buy shares in Kleenex. no, seriously! Thanks for the advice. I just bought in at 5.85 today. Go big money! go gpro... go gpro... go gpro... smile, you're on camera!"

"Nice volume today. It could be that there is some form of a hostile takeover to throw out Nick, but this is pure gambling NOT investing."
needs a 45/1 reverse split to attract new money
Analysts are out for their own agenda. I can't believe Merryl did not take it to at least a hold. With all the things going on the think it is an underperform. Unbelievable. I wish they could be held more accountable. it killed the momentum today just like they wanted.
"96 INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS ARE RAISING STAKES IN GOPRO, INC. (GPRO)"

great report better then expected $11 to $12 very fast in may . before next earning $14 to $15 let the short squeeze begin good morning all longs.
"Some have obviousl been waiting for the earnings report to be released before selling shares, regardless of whether the report was positive or negative. They're playing the ""buy on the anticipation, sell on the news"" game. Looking forward, this report is POSITIVE. I'm in and staying in."
earnings is priced into the stock and over the 3 month average its oversold
"This is an open offer for jbrad, wired, or anyone else who believe GoPro is going to be fine. I've explained why I think GoPro should be run from as an investment right now. Between several years of nothing but losses (and 2017 is already said to be a loss), several failed product launches, and missing the entire 2016 holiday season which was supposed to get them back on track, there is nothing here to invest in long term, unless you like playing the lottery. So now, for those who disagree, try posting something intelligent that shows us your cogent, coherent, rational argument for why you think the opposite. Let's hear what you have to say, and ""GoPro is a leader!"" doesn't count. And for the record, they WERE a leader, but one cannot lead without product. Say something adult, and maybe you'll get treated as one. No wishes, hopes, or dreams, just rational thought, please. I think some of you can do it."

"To those who think this is the bottom, it is not. Unfortunately CEO's credibility is now completely lost. He gave awful news yesterday and at the same time he had the most fake smile. Difficult to accept, but it is clear he is lying. This stock will keep losing value. In december it might even touch 3.x$. Then there will be Jan 2019, whose results will say once for all that this company is going to go bankrupt unless it turns a profit in the next quarter."
This was the first stock I ever bought. Those was bad times
Already hit the average daily volume in the first 30 minutes. I'm not seeing any news. Interesting.
I have been longing for months and last night the result was terrible. Management did not stand up to their promises and just kept giving empty guidance. What I am trying to say is why?! Except for the fact that this got oversold earlier why is this green now!? Why?!
"Share price will react to results not Cramer or other analysts opinions. A couple of things will move GoPro: 1) no miss on earnings/show profitability on a non-gap basis for the 3rd qrt, 2) Fusion is shipped Nov 24 or sooner with no glitches. 3) no inventory issues with GoPro 6......meet or exceed this GoPro will see mid teens or better. Too many day traders and people concerned about day to day price movement."
business is NOT booming....sorry chumps...
GoPro kills the Session camera cube https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/20/gopro-kills-the-session-camera-cube/?yptr=yahoo
60 millions share sold today I am wondering who bought that. It’s only drop 1 dollars.
"Scroll to the bottom of this page: https://shop.gopro.com/karma Looks like an accident but they posted ""Coming Spring 2017"" So I guess that confirms the release of Karma in the spring?"
What is your opinion of a Q4 beat and rising guidance. I have big losses in GOPRO and thinking about buying options for a huge short squeeze to recoup some losses.
surprised to see not pop to 5.65 if not 5.8x
"Yesterday's action shows there's a lot of short sellers that don't trust the company and year end sellers. This will probably start moving back up in January once all the tax loss people are out. Nick is trying to fix his image by turning this company around (I believe he's doing a good job with the new products and focus), but it looks like many investors are holding an irreversible grudge towards his past performance. It might be better if he resigns or does a re-org where he's still 'in' but not controlling. After yesterday, I'm sure Nick is going to pressure JP Morgan to find a Gopro buyer/merger/partnership. A lot of their employee pay packages are tied with the stock - if it falls enough, he loses all the talent and Gopro eventually dies. Nick won't risk that - this is a good buying opportunity."
Brutal day for SwingTraders but I’d you are long this is an opportunity. Marky words: there will be a big swing back into double digits in the new few weeks

"Look around at the pricing on the Hero line of cameras. Best Buy and Target are offering gift cards on top of discounted prices. GPRO no longer has any pricing power now or going forward something I still don't think Woodman gets. There is zero chance this company survives as an independent company going forward. Woodman better wake up and sell if that is even possible. As far as $10-11 a share, dream on that will never happen."
They nailed it!
Who got trapped and is now losing money? Be honest. lol. New wave of pumpers for a dead company.
Flirting with 1 billion Market cap !!! 1.5 billion is where it should be out with what I believe can go to 3 billion by end of year. That's 10.125... short term... not too Shabby 50%.. I have already locked in the gains haha...
American Bull:BUY GPROCheck it out.Just turned bullish!
Carl Icahn Coming for you shorty....
When can we will see some NEWS
"5.77 was resistance, now sitting on 5.62 support"
"ladies and gents, just took out the high of the day, this is going HIGHER"
The CFO Brian MCGee sold a nice chunk of his shares at 7.93 yesterday. Two other insiders sold at just above 8.00 on the same day. Not good. Obviously GPRO is going to 6.00 with the insider knowledge of either no news or bad news mixed with overall market correction. Can we get 5.00??? I’m buying all the way down.
Andrea ur smart like me
$gpro is nextx
"Made a deal with the devil and used unsettled funds to take substantial position at $2, now break even is $2.60. We will try and sell at above by FRI. House money will stay for eventual buyout."
Why the sell off?
Up down up down blast off or implode already. I got a few thousand shares and wants to see some action!
Smoke the bowl like I said. Amazon & GPRO together will rule.
"Wow drop back down, I should have sold at 12.50$ smh."
why hasn't GoPro been bought out by a larger more successful company?
ABOUT TO POP!
"When GPRO could not hold or build on early minor losses yesterday those Motley Foolstersput out TWO negative articles in two hours. We know they are short with negative sentiment,but now they are SCARED. Perfect setup for LT move higher. Just keep checking metrics forkarma on BBY and AMZN you will see traction building. When they announce a decent contract for body camand karma to Law enforcement, we will we will rock you."
I traded this stock back when it was 120 a share. I was lucky to have bought at about 60 and sold around 110. I exited the position and bought apple which was around 100 dollars per share at the time and made a nice profit selling apple at about 220. I am so glad I never touched this stock again.
Don’t worry too much about DJI cam because first they have to prove why customer should switch from GoPro . Then it has to compete on price and then it has to gain market share. It’s a fail just like the OSMo pocket which I said earlier will not be able to compete with hero 7. And don’t forget that GoPro have 2 new products coming which NIck didn’t mentioned much they wanna keep it secret. DJI will fail in action Cam market. Not an easy task for them.
Seeing lots of great content being shared on my Facebook from people using Quik
Cavuto on FOX at 3:00pm EST just mentioned that Gopro has made the move out of China. The press and operational excellence should be a strong tail end for Gopro.
Leka I like u buddy
Wow! A 30 million revenue reduction for a 1.25 Billion dollar revenue company causes a 23% drop. That is a bit silly.
Leka do you need a low-interest loan to buy more GoBroke shares?
Buyout by ENRON!!!
"Rotation out of GME into GPRO and a few others by Reddit crew. Just getting warmed up here. Hi Craig, I miss you so much!!"
I find it interesting that Hero 5 is selling better then Hero 6 (Amazon & Best Buy). Hope management accepts the fact that there is a price point that is optimal and Hero 6 is not it. Next year's lower priced model better be very good AND under $350 or so. Otherwise there is no hope for those long Hopeping for a SP above $12.
"About to place orders$5,97-$6...look for volume shortly..."
Hold Hold Hold !!!!
Ok...now in much deeper than I ever anticipated. Bought long at 3.28 today adding to two previous purchases at 3.80 and below. This is waaaaay oversold on the news that moved it. All the YouTube tech reviewers are loving the 8 and it’s new media mod design. “ game changer...” he’ll I upgraded to the Hero 8 as well. Much more versatile than the osmo. Any good news on China deal and fed cut next week will be good for a nice market rally taking GPRO up with it. Good luck Kong’s!
"Interesting to see at today's NASCAR race at Sonoma, California, GoPro had signage all over the track, positioned so that the cameras would pick it up. Obviously not an inexpensive venture.Fox Sports debuted their new ""Fox Sports Visor Cam"" on Danica Patrick's helmet, but the press release gives credit to Broadcast Sports International (BSI) for the amazing shots. Too bad, as that would have been a fantastic opportunity to have touted GoPro."

More bad news for Gopro. https://www.lexology.com/library/document.ashx?g=14706b03-0674-4348-a853-7970f02cf26e
"Nick Woodman, seriously MAN!!! give up the helm of GPRO to a more qualified CEO!!!!!"
Poor Craig...
Come on GPRO give us a ten plus before closing.
"I was on this board two years ago explaining why this stock was dead-money, at best. That was near $10 then.I'll explain again, it's really very simple:A stock that falls about 85% or more from the high, and stays down for more than a few months, has a very low chance of staging a major comeback of any kind, and an even smaller, tiny, chance of a complete recovery. Regardless as to the reasons why, that is the reality."
I'm beginning to think Craig Classic tells fibs. How could he???
Let's see how long or how many days this board can go without name calling or someone shoving #$%$ down another person's throat. Or is it amusement? Entertainment? #$%$...
Is GoPro finally being approached by an acquirer. What’s the good word causing the after hours action?
Woodman may be one of the worst CEOs of all time
"GOPRO should easily be 9.35 at end of FY20. That is earnings of ,.38/share x 24.6 PE (industry average)=9.35. Then beatings earnings +15% appreciation=10.75 after year end February annual meeting. Then, the analysts high estimate earnings is 1.13/share and low analyst estimate is .29. If we average the highest and lowest we get .71/share. At a PE of 24.6 x .71/share is 17.47. That’s the potential for 2021 $17.47. That’s a market cap of $2.6b. Great opportunity and Woodman finally has learned how to create value. Stock is on the move........"
Added at 7.99 long. Buying all the way down.
http://www.marketwatch.com/story/gopro-gains-as-blackrock-increases-stake-2017-01-30?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooUh oh shorts! Here comes the big squeeze!
Look back to January of last year... stock is following a very similar pattern. Prices also jumped up last camera launch
"http://stocksnewstimes.com/2017/12/28/gopro-inc-nasdaq-gpro-beta-factor-analysis/Institutional Investors now own 36.80% an increase from 35.59% of gopro and that is what I have been mentioning, every one hold there shares. We will see very big jumps very soon."
I see a wild unpredicted future for GOPRO. The worldwide brand is a household word today. Ask any any of the current and future consumers if they’ve heard of GoPro? 9-10 will say of course
Could be very effective if laying off 270 people and announcing partnership with experienced Drone designer. Usually the stock goes up during CES next week. With Woodman a negative shock and messaging is expected.
"If Google has entered the “smart camera” market, who else will? Amazon? Apple? Will they look to make a splash an acquire GoPro or do it on their own? Will Google want to venture further into the camera market and also look to acquire? Many companies have been acquired but still operate on their own to the most part. GoPro being acquired by a large tech firm would give it access to better talent, technology, price and budget."
They are right where they want to be? Reminds me of the time they told us it was the best time to be a Gopro employee after a huge layoff.
Wish gopro had the management garmin has
"With the exception of today and yesterday I never posted anything in this conversation. I see today why. Almost all posts are insults to other people or trolls who enjoy to ""predict"
patiently waiting $3’s
to be honest. It should have been a 5- $6 stock to begin with. GoPro as a one-trick pony. even the CEO cashed millions of dollars of stock for charity when was like $80 bucks a share
I'm listening to the Pinterest call and just seen the big positive shift here ... what has happened to get it 10%+???
SALES OF GROPRO UP AS POV PORN GAINS POPULARITY
going 9 in aftermarket!!!
Profits are already...
Today is a gift for shareholders take the money and RUN before Nick knocks this stock down to sub $1 level.
Nov 1 last ER went badly with a 24% decline. This followed a $6-$7.18 spike before earnings. The price action is much different this time. I expect a nice run on this quarters ER. I like the setup and expect good results.
Good for GoPro! really like the product and company. This will help long-term but it shot up too quick im picking up some shares at $6.65 level in a few days!
Hello Craig . Nothing just a friendly hello 
Price barely gets to 6 bucks and Woodman unloads 1.4 million shares. That should tell you a lot.
Congradulations leka you made the worst trade of December. Remember how you bragged about selling BB (prior to the big run) to buy more GoPro?
Market down 400 but GoPro is up 3%. What's wrong with this picture?
GoPro will be bought it by a joint venture between Enron and Worldcom. Price tag 5 cents per share!
wonder what happens tomorrow in UK merge with Garmin
The market maker will try all they might to keep GPRO from popping. In the process that short ratio is increasing. Once $GPRO gets the attention is deserves well see flight like in $AMC and $GME
Someone tell Trump. If he mentions GPRO in a tweet as an example of how to deal with the tariffs this pops to 20.
waiting for 4 buck chuck
Got my Zeus mini today. Amazing little product. Very high quality. They are going to sell a ton of these.

"I posted last month H5 went from 13th to 9th on AMZN best seller list. As of evening of 12/19 it's down to #6. I know, Craig, this COULD mean they went from selling 1 per day/week to selling 2...BLAH, BLAH, BLAHAlso best seller on Amazon Canada, France, and U.K. Meaningless."
"To see what could and might happen to GoPro' price per share, just take a look at another camera company - SNAP, which went from under $8.00 per share to over $70.00 within the past 12 months. They also have a similar EPS."
Looking for $7 soon. Turnaround and big upside coming.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2019-04-30/gopro-ceo-says-some-production-is-moving-from-china-to-mexico-video
Zwweig-Dimmenna Associates and Prentice Capital are playing this stock. The stock price has separated from the business due to this manipulation. Zweig made a purchase to run up just before what they knew would be a revenue short fall for Q4.
They need to get rid of the worthless CEO and start innovating fast.
The key is subscription model is working!!!! This is big and in my opinion very promising for the future of this company!
"thats it, done, over"
Whats going on with this stock ? Does anybody feel it will start any upward movement sooner or later ?
"I'm curious, is anybody on this board actually have first hand knowledge of GoPro products. Did you buy the Karma, Hero 5, and gimbal?"
Shorts tonight.
Time to cover shorts...you bout to get steamrolled
"Why is this under $10 still?! GoPro seems to have avg under 10 since falling Karma debacle!You know what constant ,over time, ""sideways"" share price action usually means?! Usually means BO. Not guessing here someone wants a lot of GoPro under 10. Not me, got enough riding this through 2017 HOLIDAYS.Black Friday is about 1 month. GOPRO w/full hero Fusion karma inventories at ALL OUTLETS will make next 4quarter the best 4q in GOPRO s history. 3rd q 2017 will be good for GoPro. But 4q2017 will be absolutely HUGE . Yes full inventories, possibly more new products from GoPro releases before a huge BLACK FRIDAY."
This will go down to 3 soon
"as much as I hate saying this, we r more likely to head towards 7 than 9 this week, this stock has been tearing through every support!!!!"
$7.50 to $9 a share
Looks like the upside is winning. Might end Green.
"Today is the day! We will find out if all our research and estimations for this company will hold or not in a few hours. We will say goodbye to some of you tomorrow (assuming you will sell your shares after the stock reaches $12+). Though I plan to hold on until $14+ for the first half of my holdings and keep the rest until the end of 2018, I respect your decision and wish you best of luck for your future endeavors. It was a fun ride."
$16 is coming!!!lets go
"Don’t dump all your shares, the price action is disheartening but there’s strong support here. There has been some technical damage so we’re just repairing it now."
When will Nick unload shares at the bid on the open market and cause the price to tank? It’s about that time it seems. He never passes up the opportunity to dump when the price goes up a buck or two.
"Nick Nick, for real?"
GPRO projected at$8-$9 PPS by multiple analysts making it aSTRONG BUY!https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GPRO
"Craigeo, Craigeo, wherefore art thou, Craigeo??"
"In other news, CEO Nick Woodman is still quite rich. GPRO Investors? not so much !"
Looks like some covering is going on. Must be some truth to the buyout rumor.
YOLO! Buy squeeze the hedges
"I'm out. Taking $60,000 tax loss."
Nick Woodman never quits his habit. Dumped another 200 000 shares 2 days ago at 11.17. Is that means Q1 report will be not as good?
He comes the sell off. God help us.
lights out at gpro
"Just wait it out, folks. This see-sawing is no more than external players manipulating the PPS. It has nothing to do with the valuation of GoPro."
Well at least one person actually received a Karma. https://youtu.be/za_AoPauE6U
Guys I’m down 1000 dollars :( I want my money back! I worked hard for that money 2 summers!
my interpitation of the restructer. is this company is in trouble. and with less for people to spend. means stock price is headed down.not up. sonce they are doing away with employ wages and it will still cost them.
True or False? https://www.investorsobserver.com/market-intelligence-center/stock-update/analyst-expect-gopro-gpro-stock-to-rise-54/
"I've sold this junk and feel free. One of my worst investing mistakes of all-time. Hard lessons learned....and to think, I was once up $10 a share days before it plummeted faster than I knew what the hell had happened."
"I just try to grab 10% then get out, if the market is doing down then get out, don't fight it, it's not smart to hold anything long anymore with such volatility"
Five (5) key technical indicators wisely flashing: OVERSOLDPlus fundamentals about to turn STRONG.
"I think we saw the floor today, Now it's up to management to execute there plans effectively"
"Been telling you all for months, buy buy buy"
Yesterday we had a volume of 8 million shares out of which 5.44 million were sold short. Interesting let’s watch how much short today and it will tell us where this squeeze is going . We will definitely see 10$ very soon.
#$%$ Nick don't you have any positive news to help those who are still holding this stock because we thought for sure that you would be getting this company back on track soon????
"Craig by the way I bought more Intel , Facebook , MU stocks today they are also really attractive ."
"This is literally mass hysteria in progress. The company keeps losing money, keeps over-promising, revenue degrowth is as big as ever, debts is increasing, cash-flow is basically disappeared, competitors are getting better and cheaper, and people: ""buy buy buy""."
Is GPRO starting to base around 4? Sure looks like it. Might be here for a little while. Hopefully it does consolidate here and start its move higher. Good luck all.
There might be more to this than the announcement of profitability for 2017. The volume is too high for this to be anything less than institutional buying.
Gopro is coming up with big structural change wow that’s gr8. This might give them a chance for buyout or good 2018 margins or clear focus on core business.
Looks like GoPro is starting to come alive again
Get ready y’ll. Amazing week ahead.
"Analysts expect $0.34 EPS (4Q17), up 112.50% or $0.18 from last year’s $0.16 per share. GPRO’s profit will be $46.50 million for 5.66 P/E if the $0.34 EPS becomes a reality. After $0.09 actual EPS reported by GoPro, Inc. for the previous quarter, Wall Street now forecasts 277.78% EPS growth..."
"I got out of GoPro after NickyWoody bought a yacht. That was the last straw for me. If that wide-mouthed Woodyman is out, this will fly like a drone!"
Wow .20 hardly worth the risk I took.
Is it going to go up?
If USA go with tarriffs on Chinese products it means GoPro will dominate USA action cam which is by far the biggest market and a win for GoPro . Looking forward to see how this will play out. Don’t forget that 50% of revenue from action cam market comes for where GoPro will dominate.
Whats good today? Low volume @Alain what you thinking ?
"its official, 9/28 release date, no delays nothing, past 12 we go this week"
"Woodman is a bit of a joke, He did what he needed to do to bring the company public and sold out real quick knowing how difficult it would be to grow or even maintain He has made his money and the likelihood of the stock ever going to such heights are slim to none. He has made such a mess of things throwing out guidance not really knowing where the company was really headed. On a good note, He has wised up by giving conservative guidance for the next quarter. The stock price will hover here give or take .75 cents for a few weeks until the numbers start coming in from retailers after Black Friday, That is where we will start seeing a climb back to 10.75 provided the number are positive, Then it will hover in the 10.75 range once again until more numbers from retailers start coming in after the holidays. My prediction is that the numbers will be coming in very positively. Hang in there!"
I just lost $5k today from this.
Is it bad that I actually like my GoPro Drone?
Earnings will be a big hit
Craig is shorting again 
"JBRAD: looks like you deleted your post of this morning, trumpeting that you bought 392 more shares this morning. You really deleted it because you're already under water on it? That's weak man...weak. Stand behind your decisions like a man."
Popular brand are surging up
HOLD!!
How does GPRO not get upgraded after a conference like today beats me. They certainly responded to the naysayers calling last year success a Covid fluke. Looks the the transition is panning out and bringing much higher revenues profits and the king of it all cash flow.
GoPro is up 11.02% to 11.59
Mickey likes it.
"I believe it is my turn to own some of this. I think there might be a double here. Company refocused and ready to consistently beat the numbers. Go GPRO, I'm buying in."
"It is interesting to read the various headlines. GPRO is for sale, it's not for sale. The only headline that will be of any benefit to shareholders is, Woodman steps down as CEO. Nothing else matters until he is no longer the CEO of GPRO. He appears willing and able to drive his company right into the ground."
"JOSH - where you at, baby? Buying more now that it's down another 3%? Yeah, you still think this is a bargain that no one else can see but you. Go for it, stud. You da man."
"As Mark Wahlberg said in Deepwater Horizon fim: ""Hope is not a tactic""."
"Abt’s biggest weekend draws included LG’s 65-inch OLED TVs, Sony PS4s and Sonos One speakers, while top Cyber Monday sellers included Sony Bluetooth speakers, GoPro Hero6 Black 4K Ultra HD cameras and Fitbit Charge 2 activity trackers, the company said.https://www.twice.com/retailing/chicagos-abt-electronics-record-shattering-sales-thanksgiving-black-friday-cyber-monday"
Further DJI will have to cut margins by 25% to compete which is almost impossible .
Good morning today we go over $9 and by Friday we will close over $10 shorts are trapped
"Not trying to be negative but with a huge jump like this people will be taking profits for a short while, maybe a few days. Just saying, that’s a huge spike."
Wished i have high conviction on this stock. I have adding when it was at $8 on last week. What was the good news?
"High time to cover,SHORTIES...also breaking: GOPRO onprecipice of launching Second Generation drone. Google it!"
"By the time, Apple gets interested in buying GoPro, it will be no less than $37 dollars. This used to be over $80 dollars a share. Still cheap. Added 20,000 shares this month so far."
"Oh this is really the time to buy now, average down, the floor is in, etc etc etc long BS"
"Nobody cares, it is slowly spinning down the toilet bowl"
"It is so bad that not even the shyster lawyers want to go to bat for the longs. Usually, they can find some evidence of investors being ""materially mislead"" by management. Each investor stood to recover a few hundred bucks. But it is not to be."
I can see this breaking 9.50. Have my order to fill at 7.80! Hope it hits!
God I shorted 14.77...this is how hell looks :)
"Based on Apples new news, and given their recent expansion mentioned by Alain , I think they will either buy GoPro or they will jot buy GoPro. They could be preparing revolutionary camera technologies with or without GoPro."
when will this POS end
GPRO revenue is below 2017-18 revenue. No COVID excuses. Hero 9 a major upgrade and no pop. GPRO can’t seem to maintain profitability. Over promise under deliver by Woodman is getting old. Profitability seems to be achieved by cost cutting as annual revenue keeps dropping. I am grateful for new buyers of this stock. I’ve watched and trade since it was in the 30s. Always same story. Good luck!
"I swear this is a hub for misinformation. As of late...- Average volume is at 3.8M shares (10-day moving average)- Price has moved from high 8s to mid 9s. No real resistance at these levels- No volume spikes other than the 1 selloff after Q4 ER.- No news regarding any buyouts, rumors or otherwise- No new guidance regarding 11s or 12s- There is no ""short squeeze"" currently. Nasdaq shows short interest down 2M shares from mid to late January. However we won't know more until mid/late February numbers are posted.My OPINION -- based on charts and historical movement, I don't think we will see 10s without news. I would prefer to see less news and more execution. Given the Karma just re-entered the marketplace and the HERO 5 line is relatively new, I wouldn't expect new products until late 2017. ALL SPECULATION. If blingx2 is correct, this could suggest that either the Karma is very popular OR channels have short supply. Until we see numbers or indicators -- WE WON'T KNOW.As for all the babble about charting not working -- that simply means you don't know how to chart. For those of you that believe in the company you own shares -- great! I am all about numbers... plain and simple. And if you believe that investing is simply luck, then I'd advise you to put your money in the bank. This isn't Vegas. For those of us who actually do understand charting -- no major indicators. But the 10/50 DMA are converging suggesting a change in direction away from consolidation. Yet I do believe it will require news for a significant upward swing.So for all the jbrads, marks, orena and all the rest -- gotta say, I just don't understand. 90%+ of your ""information"" and I use that term loosely, is just made up garbage. I don't need to call you names, tiny, troll or anything else. But I will admit, I simply don't get it. Are we going to see 11s and 12s? Maybe -- but again, need some actual real news that people can get behind. If this were truly a buyout target, I believe interest would have already been sparked. But I do believe this company could merge with others in media for a good additive arrangement.To those holding, good luck. To those shorting... seems this stock has stopped falling -- might want to lock in profits given they diminish the longer you hold."
I hear GOPRO releases their products WORLDWIDE TOMORROW. If it's true; I'd hate to be short GOPRO !!!!!KABOOM.
The negative news is what we all know ; Woodman over promises and under delivers. That’s a fact and therefore the market is preparing for disappointment. Wouldn’t be amazing if they over delivered.
"I was in $4.95,sold $5.30. well sold too fast"
8-9$ buy out news soon.
"I love all the comments from the novice investors here. One time sales,I am buying zillions of shares. The question is why.Give Woodman credit for the Hero camera, beyond that it is clear he never had a proper long term business plan.He made himself very rich,while robbing investors blind. Another Hero camera won't change the increasing lower priced competition not only from other camera makers but from cell phones as well. Woodman turned down a partnership with DJI and now GPRO has their own mediocre drone to sell to the shrinking GPRO faithful. Woodman's only answer to GPRO's problems is et another Hero camera. Brand name doesn't matter when sales start to decline. Lower highs and lower lows for three years. I said it earlier in the year,new lows coming for GPRO. Dead company walking."
Totally normal fraud and manipulation. nothing to see
I got another 1k for nice dip.
A little play at 7.30 then 10.00 here we come.
I honestly don't know what to do with this stock anymore. Bought at 10$. Wait for a miracle or take a loss and move on.
GoPro is up 19.34% to 7.90
"Craig the problem is that your statement are always negative, so Yes i am a pumper and also a short, but you take a SHORT stance in every of you comments. REMEMBER, ""IF IT LOOK LIKE A DUCK, WALK LIKE A DUCK QUACK LIKE A DUCK...GUESS WHAT!!!?"
Nice technical breakout with longs in control. I expect possible pullbacks for accumulation. Hopefully it holds 6.30 by the close. Upside to 7.54 should be next level of target/resistance.
Going to 9$+
millennials have started to only use Gopro for all their vacations
"Back in the old days, at east you could turn stock certificates into toilet paper"
Long at 3.85. WTH I love this new Hero8...based on YT reviews. Considered DJI Osmo action but couldn’t pull the trigger as it isn’t a GOPRO. Only Apple has the same influence on me. Gotta be a GoPro
It looks like GoPros found support in this area and reversal is in progress.
any room for improvement?

I’m still holding 2k shares @ $8.05 avg price. Not gonna sell till I see $12.
THIS COMPANY AND I HAVE A GREAT FUTURE. WOULD U INVESTORS LIKE TO JOIN FOR THE BIG MOVEMENT?

$8 is the target buy price
"Bought back in at 3.77 yesterday. Tempted to sell(again) but afraid this pup is about to take off and I will have to chase above 4.00. So many enhancements to GoPro coming. Wireless charging, motion detection and the big game changer 5G chipset. GoPro can stand on its own without needing a phone to upload content to IG SNAP etc. 5G connection direct to internet. The new MAX reviews are all positive. Actually calling it the best action camera ever and recommending over Hero 8. I’ve been using the 8 for about a week now. Amazing how far gpro has evolved its AI And EI. Hyper smooth is unbelievable. I guess I will keep an investment here. Woodman says that 2020 will see the launch of all new product categories. Should be interesting. Obviously recent hedge fund buys for good reason. Good luck longs!"

@ Craig Would you invest in Bitcoin?
GPRO must stable at $6.3's first. Then find the potential buyers in this month. It's should be $7's at the end of Jan. 2018. Then will sell GPRO at the end of this year at $9's. Good luck
GoPro......America's drone for the masses!

How did GPRO'S presentation go Tuesday 12-1 at wellsfargo sumnit go?Any comments.
On Thursday whether the news is good or bad our hedgie friends shorting are going to make sure the GoPro stock goes down. Irrelevant of the report and at the expense of all the shareholders and employees of the company. Have cash ready to but and get this thing going. The expected news is that revenues will be down because of the more profitable subscription model. Less revenue but the subscription model is increasing the profit model of those revenues into a new year that shows growing revenues YoY for the foreseeable future.I'll make sure and you should too that our friends at WSB is ready to do the same. The short ratio went from 12% to over 25% and it will quickly become much higher as they short to fulfill their agenda to make GPRO go down no matter what.$GME $GPRO $AMC $IRBT $BB $KOSS $EXPR $NAKD $PLCE $IRBT $NOK
"Good finish! Look at 5 D chart as well as 1 D intraday - there was strength going into the close with volume.... I could be wrong but this suggests the week-long net accumulation is not yet over.... maybe we have a shot at $14 - $15 second half of week.... for the doubters, look at the VOLUME."
Got the 8 for Xmas..its awesome.
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 9.57
Why is this still at $6? This belongs in $3
I like GoPros pricing it's for the pros not the average joes
I received my Hero 8 and it has most of the intuitive features that you wanted your older Hero cameras had. It makes the camera much easier to use. I went to Best Buy and that no Hero 8’s zero max cameras on display. What’s going on.
it will be bought out.... It's a good product bad management. Any big companies will surely buy it
Gopro isTurning it wounds into wisdom. All the Best
Now who wants to say Nick’s not unloading shares?
Goproshould partner up with discovery and Verizon channel that's launching a streaming service in January that would be a home run!
"JP Morgan Chase upgrade to $13, Motley Fool slaps GoPro on the back for Inventory Control Improvements that contributes positively to the bottom line, Quik Stories named a favorite editing choice by Digital Trends....pretty good start to the week. If price would climb and stay above $10....be a great close to the week."
Cover now or cover tomorrow over $7 makes no difference for me

Another Institutional Investor loaded on 6.51% shares of gopro. Bad news for shorts. and a million reasons why these institutes are running to load up on shares. best of luck from now shorts.
I feel bad for the people who shorted Snapchat lmao same things is gonna happen to gopro short sellers
"i think 20 dollar is a fair price... 3 billion capacity, about right for gopro. dumped apple yesterday and tesla, glad i did, now more money for gopro"
Motley Fools are not in a good place. When GoPro reports out for Q1 those fools are going to take it in the shorts big time!
"How's it going, shorts? You're toast. This is a 1 bagger or more."
This GoPro stock makes me more depressed every time I look at it. I am wondering if anyone has any input on if I should cut my losses now or wait until after Black Friday to see if it will rebound? Any input would be greatly appreciated.
"For the first time in the last 8 months I feel the shorts are in big trouble here, I've always believed in my investment here even though it's been extremely painful but my pain is nothing compared to the pain the shorts are gonna feel"
"I want the shorts to drive the price again below 8$ so i can scoop up more shares, Please do it before next report"
This game is riged...Douche bag Cramer ...took your money..so did the analyst...

"You haven't lost anything till you sell, don't sell buy more GoPro ASAP . Tomorrow green."
Is that all the shorts and profiT takers can do after an historic rise. I think this confirms the strength of the stock. Buy now for a squeeze since this downturn is weak....
Just in at $4.95. Almost forgot this stock.
GoPro revenue will not beat. hero 9 has been seeing major discounts for months. Best Buy refurbs a plenty. Always a good indicator of sales. Big discounts and lots of free accessories in HERO 9 bundle. Should be interesting in May.
When is that 3$ coming ? Lol
End the week $13+ if the reaction is anything like Q3
I told you a while back ; GOPRO Fusion +VR +QUIK APP = No Competition . It's about the VR produced w/ GoPro Fusion 360 cameras making other competition's camera perspective obsolete. Eventually FB needs GOPRO as will GOOGLE and APPLE and SAMSUNG and...... FB buys out GOPRO.Soon

"What happens to GoPro recently? Popped $1.5 at 3x average volume today for no news. Anyone has any news to share, please?"
"Watch gpro short position daily it will give you all into what the market thinks. I think gopro have turned around things since it successfully diversified lately to drone market. in the start no one would have believed apple would be in such a position but now they are sitting on so much cash and look at their price , profits, business models etc. i noted one thing recently so many people suggesting sales are low in holiday season. lets wait for the figures and see if they are. further management is conservative due to problems in the past and they would do what is right to compete. some people suggesting lately big discounts offer been suggesting sales are low. once again lets wait for the numbers. when gopro was about to release q3 numbers so many people were saying it will miss. although it didn't miss the stock still went down which makes me wonder why . because of forecasts. well see short increase in that month. now see short decrease coming. the volume traded today was also shorted mostly. now think this way many investors are not selling until Q4 result and i m gonna wait even if they miss the estimates and thats for a reason. for those who want to short best of luck."
"This week we will know what the stock is going to do . The daily chart shows bullish as of now . Might continue might not . Had a strong sell off today when it hit the 20MA which happens a lot but doesn’t mean we are bearish , could be profit taking. Tons of call options for this thing .they had new products out and a subscription and maybe a possible buy out coming . GL. To all"

"What are they producing that hundreds of other companies aren't or can't produce cheaper and as good or almost as good at a lower price? If the answer is nothing, then they're a commodity business and maybe not a very good one because their product line isn't broad enough, like a Sony, and they don't have the same economies of scale. It's what I'm seeing here."

If u r in for the long term forget the analysts' views
$nvidia $sq $nflx $snap $gpro all these stocks got a pump and will drop like a rock going into the new year. Get out while you can before all the gains get wiped out and continue heading down south to new lows.... It’s going to be a long winter.
Once the upgrades start rolling in we could see jump you to $15 ! Load up now.
I think hero 7 black and silver selling well in America’s and Europe while hero white selling well in Asia pacific . Well that answers most of GoPro problems . They should be making low cost products with value for buyers for Asia while premium products for America’s and Europe. That way they will expand into Asia market without compromising much .
Today's volume is 8 times higher than average volume! It will go above $7.50 on Monday!
"We have 2 Craigs in this board, a smart one and a annoying SOB. You know which is which: )"
Any predictions on this board can be dismissed as guesses. Let’s hear about GoPro’s products and strategy.
As mentioned this will keep going up... follow gopro and broadcom
"Would someone who's a fan of the product please explain what's so special about their product? I mean compared to the cameras on phones, Canon, Nikon, etc?"
What would happen if I stop being gopro troll and start being long?
GoPro restructuring plan rename the business GoBlockchainPro watch the stock quadruple
GoPro gone by way of the Dodo
GO GO GO GO GPRO.
Is there any reason for owning GPRO now? It is such a disappointing stock but is there something still to be salvaged from the latest bad news? I have only 500 shares so it is not a huge deal to be down on this one stock. Can anyone present a case for holding and not selling?
Expect a reversal around noon eastern time then it's off to the races again... ALL ABOARD!!!
"For some stupid reason, people n market tied up GPRO n FIT, whereas they're totally diff business n products function as well. GPRO already went thru the pain, fall hard and on its way to recover now. Good ER tomorrow for sure. Nick really wants to turn this ship around and he does with new products !"
I added 10000 shares 6.09 $ see what happen
Remember when this was in the 9’s cuz I do.
Went to Best Buy and they had 1 Hero 6 and about 25 Hero 5’s. Session was sold out and accessory stock was very thin. The sales help said GoPro is among the consistent strong sellers. We’ll see the results soon.
Anyone waiting for Buyout news?
So they have $200 million dollar in cash balance and I wonder if they are going to acquire another company or not?
I'm out! Can't take Woodman's lies anymore.
Hi shorts!
Adding a extra 200 shares at every dip.
Craig I just have a basic question for you . You claim that you don’t. Short stocks and you are not a fan of GoPro so I am thinking why would you even bother to be here. Misleading claims again . And by the way there is a saying time is money 
If Nick can keep from salivating and unloading a million shares at the bid we may keep the price action going.
no position but the street could have made that article about any company with bad amazon reviews. the amazon kindle and apple ipads have bad reviews. such a bad hit piece on gopro by the street
massive bowl forming on 1 year chart. Price is gonna be good for a while.
"Like I said one of the worst IPO's ever. Run away and never look back. Woodman has no idea what he is doing, never has."
Would be crazy if GORPO breaks its all-time high within 12 months. That would be one of the greatest comeback stories of all time. Proud shareholder who betted on this kind of comeback :)
every hour I look at my gopro shares I throw up.
A deal is going to be announced very soon that is after Morgan Stanley will buy all your shares
Every day since earnings with this stock:Oh nice it's up 20 cents at open!Oh wow it's down near $8. Oh it closed flat. Oh nice it's up 20 cents at open!.....
"Pretty sad that besides giving a lower Q4 guidance than expected, Nick makes an announcement about selling his own company stock in an effort to diversify his portfolio. Don't know why, he should be able to diversify without selling his Gopro holdings. #$%$?? Is he short on his own company? Come on Nick...you are killing me. I thought I was able to retire. Hung on to this stock waiting for it to get back at least to a third of what it was. But unless something breaks pretty soon, it looks like at 68 years old, I am going to have to go back to work."
Why is GPRO going up while Market going down. I believe Shorts covering before report or some people buying at these prices. We will see how this stock is again manipulated as soon as report is issued.
"Look what this #$%$ had to say. Who is this POSApple, Fitbit, GoPro, and Garmin all came out with new products in the second half of the year, and Black Friday weekend provided the first real hint of how well those items will sell during the crucial holiday season. Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt thinks the early signs look good for Apple, Fitbit, and Garmin, but not for GoPro."
Jeremy bragged about this stock for a long time.
I don’t think GoPro is a direct winner from Van over DJI drones but it is a winner indirectly if GoPro management can capitalize on this one in a thousand opportunity. Here is what I think how GoPro can end DJI action cam ambitions. Lower the price enough so DJI can’t sell their action cams in US market . They will get squeezed by the ban on their drones too and would be unable to fight on margins . This is a golden opportunity for GoPro to return the favor .
"Stuck at a higher entry point, I don't always enjoy Craig's posts. However, as an online analyst (on this board), he has raised some valid points by looking at the stock and the company in black and white and not grey. For what it's worth, looking at international potential, I believe GPRO will continue to make inroads. That's a plus. From a consumer standpoint, while slipping, GoPro continues to have the credibility investors no longer see. As a camera company, the drone may not have been a good idea. Woodman is a minor league player, now in the big leagues, and not smart enough to see he's his own worst enemy. Read glassdoor.com and learn the common thread among posts is the poor internal management that governs. Many on this board post conjecture; their statements belie the truth. They're fortunate DJI is having their own drone issues. And the fact is, there may be room in this world for both DJI and GoPro in the drone world. I'm heartened that today's action was on low volume. Does it surprise anyone there is no clarity on what is happening at GoPro right now? Do you ever wonder if the flight problem was a GoPro issue or the fault of a supplier? There are other questions which need answers. And this is where I agree with Craig: If there are no positive facts coming from the company and no explanation as to steps taken toward a brighter future, why buy the stock?"
get the same people said the same thing with fosl
"Hey all, I bought this at $80 about six years ago. I haven’t followed it much since. Does anyone know when they did the 20x1 split? I can’t find the split date anywhere???"
I dont know if anyone at this company ever thought of this but I think it would be pretty cool to see video of those guys and gals in a squiril suit and see there heart rate data on the screen. They should try and get a deal with the tracker companies like fitbit and the apple watch and have the realtime data on the screen.
"The only reason I see for the share price of GPRO declining is the daily media repetitions of the latest ""poor 4th-qtr guidance"" during the last earnings report ....which is nearly 2 months old. This is now OLD news, folks, and is only a guesstimate - not fact."
Travis is very confused. A reset has taken place. Inventories have been balanced. Distribution overseas has made huge gains. Marketing support overseas is catching up so penetration in those markets is happening. The best news is Hero 5 and Drone will are coming in a big way.The operations side and product mix is right per management. Hate if you like but you will watch the company move away from you quickly.
buyout news may come soon..
Will we ever see 60 again?
ON THUR AFTER THE HOURS MM FRIEND BOUGHT MORE THAN 150000 SHARES@8.38.IN THE MORNING THE STOCK WAS TRADING BETWEEN 8.38 AND 8.40 AND REACHED 8.66 THAN AT THE CLOSING THE STOCK WAS TRADING 1SHARE AND 10SHARE WHICH WAS PURELY MANIPULATED.NEXT WEEK THE STOCK WILL TRADE AS HIGH AS .9.50
The shorts here are funny. Desperation moves.
"ZOOOOOOOOOOOOOM........................A nice article by Motley Fool who I hate.....but....a nice positive write up here under GPRO.February 7th I think is earnings date......I predict it to be creeping up as that date gets closer.This is a NEW company as compared how they used to do business.1,000,000 new subscribers give them $50,000,000 recurring income.....$50 per subscriber)If you have a big position....you can sell covered calls at $15 and take in some good income.I did it on SOME of what I'm holding."
Riddle me this: Woodman said growth will return later this year. With what? There has been no growth for over 2 years. Are there new products on the horizon? Maybe a drone?
"Hi everyone, does anyone know how many shares of GoPro Woodman still has? According to many websites it seems that the Woodman family trust sold all their 706980 shares at 9.22$ the 3rd November. Is this information correct?"
Google: Pioneer Reporter...mini wifi cameras.
"GoPro gutted their company to be profitable, it lacks growth, and still has an unreliable CEO running the show. It is laughable people think this stock should be surging 20%+ today. ER was already priced in considering the stock is up 25% since hitting a new low at $4 a couple of months ago. Maybe if they show some real revenue growth and this stock might actually go much higher. Doubt that ever happens.Then again, these are the same people who have been trying to catch this falling knife for years. They never learn."
"Morning Craig ! Wow, look at that volume! 1.7 million shares in first 20 minutes"
SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL SELL
Buy now what!!! Are’u seriously this $2 stock
"My thought is that Gopro still has a bright future with adventurers/athletes/filmmakers but their products just aren't for the masses. Most people I know that bought a gopro in the past 3-4 years have hardly used there gopro. Reason being they just don't ever do anything all the interesting or adventurous they just bought one for the cool factor I guess. Is the gopro a good camera choice to take pictures of your family and pets, no. If your backpacking in the mountains, kayaking, surfing, wakeboarding, or skiing every weekend than yes a gopro is the camera for you.After the Q3 surprise earning beat I really thought gopro would meet the top end of their Q4 estimate. Wasn't expecteding guidance to drop as much as it did, bummer for investors. GoPro still has crazy sex appeal and content, brand in my mind is worth more than fitbit. Things could turn around, they could very well have a profitable 2018 through focusing on their primary customer and cutting unprofitable ventures. Fusion could very well be the top selling 360° camera since it launch, content and images they put out are amazing eye candy to armature filmmakers' imagination. Perhaps the Fusion offers investors the hope karma failed too."
GPRO has something big coming. I mean it is going to be big. REALY BIG BIG BIG.
You sell your shares now with Ty on your side then you should not be investing in the market . IMHO
Under $4.

Good volume
Wow it spiked a bit
Amazon good news is coming! It will uplift the stock price to above $15 per share! It will be followed by one private investment firm to make all cash offer to buy out GoPro at $25 per share! The good news are coming!
We just hit something after hours on and important somebody’s radar.
News? Big spike last 10 minutes
Thank why institutions are stocking up Right !!!!!!! . I have been following the top holders and it looks like they are buying ???????/
I think the best thing GoPro did was offer 3 different price points. Gives people a reason to upgrade. Sell the first hit for cheap and then they will pay for the better one.
"Both BOZO Craig x 2 (which I think you are the same) AMAZON has the hero 5, GoPro Hero, Hero Pro with Wifi enable, ALL in stock and able to be delivered tomorrow 11/30/2016. Just checked best buy and the have all the Hero except the hero 4 black most can be pick up at the store or delivered. Checked Target and they have all of them also and ready to be delivered you get it by 12/01/16 with express delivered. NOW I AM REALLY UPSET THAT CLOWN LIKE YOU ARE GIVING OUT BAD INFORMATION TO THE THIS FORUM, and you should be kicked out...PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THIS TWO CLOWNS WHICH I THINK ARE THE SAME CRAIG AND CRAIG 2.

"Question is, are all these gurus wrong? Right now, short interest is still at record levels of 33 million shares shorted. The next batch of these numbers will be interesting to see with shares down at this level. I don't currently own GPRO but I did do a few trades on the last lows for unimpressive gains. I'm just looking for some sort of confirmation to start a new position and so far I'm not seeing it yet. I think there's maybe $1 per share buck to be made at $7.50 back to $8.50 with more if GPRO actually is turning itself around."
"I was always taught to trade without emotions ... And it works!I believe 10$ was bargained price for the stock. If it could go down or up.. It wouldn't matter. But remember Wells Fargo had similar issues regarding employees and the stock has practically recovered... Wether whoever gets fired, or not... The stock is at a bargain, in comparison to the companies actual value. Warren buffet always prices the worth of the company, and honestly if I was to be him I would say; this company seems to be worth around $25 to me IF NOT MORE.."
only $.36 estimate..... should be easily beaten
"I’m just going to say that here in Wisconsin, I’ve seen so so many new boaters and water skiing etc... They are mounting GO PROS on their boats...

"GoPro Possible Buyers 1As a frontier Sport and Motion camera maker, there should be plenty buyers.First possible GoPro Possible Buyers : The Boeing Company (BA)It is possible that Boeing buy GoPro, and install GoPro multiple cameras (10 ~ 50) in each Boeing air planes (inside and outside of the are plane), capture flying status and store in cloud storage system.This will greatly help tracking each air plane flying status by 7/24."
We could see a deal as early as this weekend $10 to $15 is possible by Tuesday morning have a great weekend longs.

Currently Citi has PT of $2.5 for $GPRO as of 8 days ago. Morgan Stanley analyst just gave a PT of $2.2 a few days ago. Travel industry may not fully recover for years.
Hola hola . GoPro expecting to sell 5 million units and NIck was pretty happy I think they beat the numbers and will be high than expectations . We are seeing some good news soon. I will be buying more now since I am convinced that slowly it is returning to profitability . And don’t remember to hold your shares and buy more so we can have a real short squeeze 
"gpro is the best video camera money can buy, this stock needs to turn around, I think a buyout is coming from tsla"
I strongly belive this will go up To 7 today and close above. great product. lot of people love the camera. Any big tech company can pay peanuts to buy this and make a fortune with integrating their tech on this
Buy GoPro before earnings report this time. You could miss on this rally for sure. You will end up buying it for over 8$ after this report. Let’s see and watch together whether you agree or disagree with me .
Sue Nick.... May he never be free of endless litigation....
If we get a sustained strong push upwards shorts going to be sweating
push to 5.69 by close?

Thoughts on today's action ? I think up a few cents then down again ...maybe around $3.30's
The GOPRO SALES #s won't lie . They will speak volumes. Loud and clear. GOPRO MAKE SOME NOISE THIS WEEK
Woody expects 2 million subscribers by the end of 2021. They have shifted to a more direct sell to consumer through GP website. Podcast was pretty good take a listen.
New lows coming. Very poorly run company. CEO thought he was running a company like Apple. Competition has surpassed GPro. Company continues with name momentum but that will eventually fade. Very sad.
"GoPro is a perfect fit for Google. Combining GoPro's camera hardware with Google's data center and video editing Software, there is little overlap but tons of synergy"
Gpro fans buying at these levels.
They provided a wrong guidance with an error of almost 30%. Clearly there is space for a class action here and they totally deserve it.
Can we thank Fitbit for this dip this morning?
I took $350 of my profit from gpro to buy the hero 9 bundle deal they have going on. Smart move
Where are all the bears to drive the price to 1$ ???? Can you do it fast?
So glad I sold my entire position at 5.41 last week. Small gain fro 5.10 purchase a few days earlier. Woodman is no CEO. This management team has been making promises forever. The window is quickly closing on GoPro action camera dominance as DJI Osmo action camera is as good and in some opinions better than Hero 7 black. Woodman should have taken that DJI offer a few years ago to produce drones together splitting revenues 50/50. GoPro makes the camera DJI would make the drone. Woodman wanted 75% of profit as he believed the name GoPro would sell more drones. Now he has an enemy in DJI. Game over!
"SARWAR: Sorry for your loss...but then again, I tried...TRIED to get you to think and understand history."
GPRO is rebounding and i believe will get to 10$ very soon. i track hero 7 and fusion sales and fusion has picked up for sales lately. this will be another success story hyped by media very soon. happy for gopro shareholders. good news will be coming in the next few weeks and beyond.
Oh my it’s going to be 50
technical suggests rally to 5.65 if not 5.8x and then decide to stay long or take money off the table.If i see 5.8x; I'm taking half off the table.

looks like Woodman stop selling shares in June? Why? buyout potential?
"Good start, Woody...now let's get going!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-hero8-black-now-works-130000442.html"
Hello... subscribers I'm Jeremy and I believe in GoPro. Have a great day...
GOOD DEAL LEKA! AVERAGE DOWN!
GOPRO $8 buyout?
I am all over it now.... Back in... Easy Peasy !!!!!!!! PLaying off of Fit bit ... Will be a great next quarter.... Can anyone say new batter life on GO PROS :) Oh YEAh !!
"When woodman said no boogyman, he neglected the markets boogeyman China, which every time the markets rally is brought up, for Gopro to be in the green on a day the market is down 400 pts irrespective of the gain percentage ought to bring fear for short positions"
GoPro finally caught up with FItBit. They are both on the same boat and sinking together.
May 5th will be a very important day...................... These guys almost always under deliver. If they deliver on the last conference call projections things will begin to change in a big way. Two qtrs and we see a double or triple from here. That is if the market doesn't tank or have a major correction.. Its getting very long toothed and Feds can't spend forever.
"GoPro now held 72% plus by institutions , congrats to the people who thought they made money selling their shares . I ain’t selling my shares infact I added today ."
"I doubt GPRO has the ""cash"" to settle ANY Shareholder Lawsuit ....."
"anyone watch MVIS? bounces all over the place. 100% +move in a week. pennies to $25 in a year. pretty insane. The only thing changed in the last 10 years with them is they sold stock for some cash and reddit has become their best friend!!!!Gpro needs some friends. Tech company , Growing again. More profitable than MVIS. More money in bank, Building and growing a subscriber base. zero debt."
I finally bought one of these and really enjoyed it on vacstion
"Manipulation by larger investors today to enable them to buy in cheaper before big announcements of next week? June 4 =Shareholders Meeting, June 5 =http://investor.gopro.com/events-and-presentations/event-details/2019/Baird-2019-Global-Consumer-Technology--Services-Conference/default.aspx"
"This STOCK is so cheap that just blow it upCraig should cover, if you have pocision I think you're just a talker more"
Sell before Woodman liquidates his remaining 32 million shares.
rising water lifts all boats...lets lift this boat above 13?
Time to take profits.MIME about to SOAR!
Help 
"Real holiday sale for gopro is on christmas day since most of their sale are in europe and asia, not base on black friday , company had solid fundamental current market capital less than revenue and good amount of cash vs debt, short sellers seems not going below 8 dollars, overall this stock have good upside potential."
close at 7 and gap up in a.m.
It looks like people are getting excited about the ER.
the best way to start off your day irritated is to look at your Gopro shares. bs
"Most bloggers I talk to about portable Vlogging says they prefer the iPhone 11 over any GoPro version, including the Hero 8. I actually like the idea of having a GoPro for vlogging and a separate camera for vlogging on the go. GoPro needs to do a better job for consumers like me weighing this decision to promote their camera for vlogging in the go... I realize vlogging is s secondary usage to the primary action capturing, but vlogging I feel is a large segment GoPro needs to grab for growth..."
Elon looks like he could be a GoPro guy. He said something about GameStop and it’s up 180% after hours over 200
Waiting for the BIG turn around. It is coming. REST ASSURED.
Will be red soon
"Leka wins the Darwin award, can't justify his multiple purchases, average downs, paper losses nor give any reason why there is any reason for upward guidance of GoPro."
"Victor, Sam, help. I need this stock to go lower."
$3’s next week!!
Does anybody else think Brenton Tarrant was the best marketer of all time for GoPro?
"SARWAR: CYDY did not have any drug rejected, in fact, they have not yet released the results from the 2 FDA approved trials yet. You are a bastion of misinformation. The results should be out in the next week or so for their drug, leronlimab, which will be a game changer for many things, including COVID. And thus far, all of the news has been nothing but positive. Did the share price fall? Yes. Why? They are on the OTC and there was a short attack. They will be uplisting to the NASDAQ in about 4 weeks. You really need to get a 3rd grader to read and explain things to you. Watch what happens to the share price by August 15."
7 gonna come by Thursday
I think an interactive game for all sports. They have the videos or could create them. Huge market....
Out at 6.86 and good riddance.
Looking for new HOD
"I love all the comments regarding Woodman sandbagging the estimates for the next quarter. Hard to tell as he has zero credibility with shareholders or wall street. Woodman needed a homerun with the Hero 6, he didn't get it. Next up he will start blabbing about a Hero 7. No reason to buy here."
"Glad I got out at $9.50. This is going to low 7's again, 2 ANALyst already came out with bad channel sales, based on hard data, I also did my on investigation, found out some displays in Walmart were not even ready for Black Friday."
You think it'll jump up by Friday?
miss the days when Gpro was at $60+ and would move 15-20% after earnings. That was some great action. This stock is boring now
"Well another -0,30 also today , this stock can’t really hold it self, I’m wondering if nick woodman have any concern to let his stock =his money constantly die"
Called it yesterday
GoPro is terribly managed and may go bankrupt within a year if not sold to another company
GoPro is up 10.11% to 8.28
Must be a buyout coming or something.
"As usual the ""stock"" is not following well the real company , that has been the real problem during all 2017 , and this i the result , but yesterday come out more news that I was expecting , and the product are amazing !! So slowly (hope fast ) we will se the stock climb ( in my vision with a 16$ result ( maybe 17 no more ) and a stabilizing around 14-13 ! , as I previously said guys ""it will be a bloodbath to watch until the end of your taking profit ! But let's be clear now the foundamental are good for real !! I'm going to order the hero 6 + karma today ! So enjoy"
Bullish at these prices the brand GoPro alone is worth 2 billion
Did you guys see the Simply Wall St blog that suggests GPRO is 40% below its intrinsic value? Makes a good case… but years of poor financial performance is the reason why retail and institutions price the stock lower. If Woodman can start stringing together profitable quarters when we are are rewarded accordingly. Here’s to strong earnings next week!
"This is BS. Why are the fkin estimates so high for a company trading at $1.5B market cap. To expect $530+ million in next Q sales, would make it trade at 1x Sales. Apple, MS, FB, etc. all trade at 4-5x Sales at even such huge market caps. And Eeny, meeny, miny, moe IPO companies with no sales or profits trade at like 20-30x Sales and have $2-3 billion market caps.If analyst wants to keep such high earnings expectations, this stock should be trading at least $40.Groupon (GRPN) is another such ex where the market caps and earnings expectation does not make sense. I know Market is all about growth but these are good solid businesses with instantly recognizable brand name and acceptance."
Well John I can make exceptions .....if that's going to make you happy but you've got that right and I stand by my recent words but you're not GOD so don't push my GOPRO (if you know what I mean).
Sell order at $10. I’m glad that I held this long enough to get in a positive position but it seems to have no staying power even after a positive earnings report last week. Hopefully the order won’t execute but I’m not taking the chance of going back negative on this company - especially since they still have the same CEO.
"I can't relate because i haven't purchased any GPRO, but looking at this technology I really like what HIT Technologies is doing right now, basically creating a GoPro camera using your very own cellphone. Perhaps you could look at it as an opportunity to change your luck and get that money back that was lost in this stock? Not an advocate for the company by any means, and have a very small position in HIT, but their future looks bright and i would rather share potential good ideas for everyone's benefit."
THIS NEWS IS A MARKETING STRATEGY FOR INSIDERS TO BUY MORE SHARES BEFORE EARNING ANNOUNCEMENT THE END OF THE MONTH. LOAD UP NOW BEFORE IT JUMPS TO OVER 7.
Only logical answer is GoPro investors like it up the p00p chute
"I am a cinematographer, many of my friends have multiple older Gopros. I talked to some of them today and most of them will use the trade in program. This might be bigger than many would think- I opened small position today."
Good article on GPRO about why it is not worth more than $6 and I agree. There is nothing that has shown this company has turned around yet. Last year the Holiday season was a complete disaster and there is no reason to believe this one wont be either. They already conceded there is not enough internal parts to make the cameras. I bet that is just an excuse as they know they will not be in demand anyway as everyone already has a cell phone or two or three that can take videos. How much will the China tariffs effect this company? How many bad quarters can GPRO have before it needs to file for a secondary offering? They have over $100million in debt now and I expect it to grow. This company is not in very good health as it is not a product in high demand that people need to have.
"At the end of the day.........week.....month.......yr., have I made money or lost it.So far I am down. In at $14 a while back. I will not sell because I am confident it will get back over $14. My position is small, so 5 to 10% fluctuations are not worth the risk to try and pick up a few shares. For those in the same boat, hang tight!"
Stock prices are often based on a company's FUTURE aspects. Zack's worthless article is about GoPro's PAST Covid year earnings. Hold 'em if you already have 'em.
Close over 13.50 is very bullish. Looking for it to touch the 200 ska by Monday in the 14.25ish area at a minimum.This run will take it to the 16-17 dollar range imo.peace!!!!!
gonna close at 4.6
"So the Hero 9 is $450 retail or $350 with a 1 yr sub to Gopro. If Sub at $5/mon, thats $55 a year. With $100 discount, thats 2 years free right? And if we use the Hero 8 price of $400, then its 1 year free. However, profit margins might be better on the Hero 9 as they are selling more direct to consumer vs retail channels. Dont know their wholesale price, but if it was say $300 for the 8, then they are still making $50 more per 9 now..."
FLASH: GPRO set tosurprise to UPSIDE.Google what happenedmid-April to mid-Maywith a far less compelling story!Technicals andFundamentals aboutto converge in synchat just the right time.GLTA LONGS...our time has arrived. Tick/tock.
"Geez Leka, what happened to your floor? LOL"
"I'm going to apologize in advance to most everyone here for my next couple of comments. Mark -- you have a vocabulary of about 10 words - apparently calling people names gives you credibility in your imaginary world. Oren -- 12? Really? We barely scraped 11 before Q4-2016. Care to share why? And someone here rumored a ""secret facebook deal"" We can all pretend -- but again, I stress that people actually come here looking for information. Scary I know. So if you would just kindly remove yourselves from the gene pool or have yourselves neutered, that would be great. And FYI -- should the stock pop to 12 because of a buyout, that only proves that you got lucky although if GPro was really ripe for a buyout, don't you think something would have happened in the 7s? AAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!"
I think hero 7 Black is selling well and most suppliers have original pricing until now. The other 2 models have less discount than before and it let me think that there could be a beat of revenue as well as margins and profits . This might be last opportunity to buy at this price . After this quarter things seem really well for gpro to get business done .
DJI coming in to save us all? Buyout? ...that’s the plan
"By looking at the insider trading section, it seems that Woodman recently sold all this shares (beginning of November), however the CFO and other directors didn't show any significant activity concerning their trading. Anyone has any thought on that?"
been in since 5.08 wit 2k shares
It will be nice to see where shorts drive the price so we long bulls can buy some shares. It might be time to load on more shares. Bcz I don’t think there is any significant change in guidance both revenue and profits and plus the 360 max is very attractive product at this price point further o think with hero 8 delay the 360 max will get promoted meaning that GoPro will further penetrate 360 market. Don’t loose your sleep for such small news.
Worst day on the Market in 4 months...but GoPro still went up! Good sign!!
"for the longs, at what price are you waiting to sell?"
Institutions now own 65+% . Will we see more buying by institutions as the price March south . I will add of course.
The market will see a light at the end of the tunnel after they find the vaccine for this pandemic. Had good profit with gold and bitcoin but more profit to come with a better and greater market. Soon people will leave their house. Plane will fly and businesses will open.
"This stock has been the very definition of ""Long Suffering"". How much longer can people suffer?? SMH"
easy short...lol
Woodmens in his office beating his meat to all you loosing money.
"Woodman has done nothing for shareholders since GPRO went public in 2014. Make a $399 camera, tweak it every 2 years and then discount it after the release, is clearly not working. What happened today usually happens in January when Woodman warns on holiday sales. GPRO has no pricing power, a limited group of buyers and a CEO who clearly has no idea what he is doing."
"Someone bought 120,000sh of GPRO at 11:00am. That’s $600,000. Worth of GoPro.The exact timing and @5.96 price suggests insider buying. To me anyways."
Any dips below 4 are a buy for me right now. Watch out on Wednesday.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-founder-open-partnership-165239359.htmlEven Woodman doesn't believe himself anymore!
"I'm going to buy the GoPro Karma Bundle right now (if I can find one in stock on AMAZON or somewhere else?) I'll let you guys (who care) know after I try to purchase one, today. Aloha"
So what is the story with gopro?
We have a buyer !!!!!!!!
"Personally I would love to see this fall further, so I can back up the truck. GPRO isn't anywhere close to bankruptcy. All it takes is GPRO deciding to launch new products outside of action cams, and this will jump up significantly. And it's going to happen. Read the latest interview with Nick. Easy buy and hold at these levels."
Hmmmm... down 10% on low volume... wonder what it means
Sometimes the best investment is the one u don’t make:(
If some one is not dumb they can figure out from DJI and Gopros video that DJI video is still shaky not as stable as GOPros . GoPro wins this one . I don’t think more people will like OSMo action.
The silence and sideways sp always means something substantial has or is happening to or with GOPRO . GoPro didn't hire APPLE's ex Executive Design
What is going on with this stock no momentum itself. When is nick going to come out and talk
Should of taken my broad to the mall and spend 1000 instead
Bought this on last week. I guess im good. Can this be worth $100 a share in 2023?
Happy Friday shorts! Miss u Craig 
this is one washed up stock.
It should have been bought by APPL long time ago.
"An increase in 2 million shares held short were at $5 and below. Think 24M collectively all have GPRO wrong? I'm not exactly sure what it translates to BUT my guess is they're adding as GPRO rises. This would be in line with the past and since not a whole heck of a lot has changed, I don't see any reason to change sentiment. Sure, pricing is different (lower margins?) and maybe there's a buyer out there? I think Woodman is the obstacle to a partnership. The overall view of Woodman is likely held with smart money and potential partners too. The other thing that might be upsetting is another offering to stay alive which I think would cause major dilution, but who knows.https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gpro/short-interest"
"After hours, it indeed acted similar to FIT yesterday, however, it stabilized around $6.15, but it said that turn around at the later half this year is expected."
"Everyone waiting for the ""sale to"" news....could come as early as friday"
come on gopro push green
On track to hit $10 EOY. Good luck everyone.

closed above 200day moving avg-chartists have a lovefest-we go higher!
"I bought into gpro at the product launch in Oct. and thinking to ride it through the holiday. The blunder by management really killed the stock since then. There is still some hope if you are still in this thing like I am. Here is my analysis. From 2013-2015, gpro sold more than 15m units, if 1 in 5 hardcore gproers decides to upgrade then this is about 3mil new demand. I think that is what is happening based on my reading of reviews. If the 30% growth rate over last year can be sustained as indicated by black Friday number, then you can anticipate about 2.6 mil units sell though this holiday (last year number is about 2.0mil). The average ASP for 2016 is $262. So this amounts to $682mil in revenue. or if they can match the 2014 Q4 hero4 release number at 2.4 mil for $629 mil. So the guidance is still achievable without drone. The big question is if hero5 could sustain the 30% growth over 2015 Q4 and this is big if. On the other hand, hitting Q4 number is not going to move the stock as the street would question the sustainability of hero5 and growth. The fate of gpro hings on the karma unfortunately. That is only growth driver at near term. My bet is that gpro can right the ship by releasing karma by middle of January to generate enough momentum for a squeeze to the high teens."
Going up today/ What do you think?
All I'm going to say is look at Friday's candle on the daily. Anyone that knows anything about technicals will understand the chart doesn't lie.
buyout might be any day now
Closing in on 50DMAFlirting with HOD...Small float...Big buys...Lots of shorts to cover!
And even more Bee S..... You should really delete your pumping trailOrenAlast yearReplied to a reaction$GPRO conversationIt will not stay under 10 for along time just keep buying you will see 20s this year if not a 5 billion buyout .
Woodman and Mcgee sold shares a few weeks ago and filed last week to dump more March 15 2021. SEC filing shows today they will sell more. I think we are wondering why the big run up. Take some profit and ask questions later.
may buy back in $6s
"A declining 200. Four major corrections in the last 10 months, not including the horrible drop at the beginning of the year. An arrogant CEO. Someone tell me why this is a good investment on the long side."
If gopro would have teamed up with an auto manufacturer to do 360 dash cam type hardware they could have maybe saved the company. But gopro never expanded outside their target audience. Decade of relying on same people....

GoPro cameras flying off the shelf duringAmazon Prime Day.
GoPro had a prime sales area at the front of the Costco store today. Maybe some retailers are allowed to sell GoPro cameras.
The time to buy is tomorrow before it go up to 5.50 by Friday and Then Monday 6 get in while it’s cheap 7 coming watch and see by Wednesday!!!
"my model is telling me 10.48 close, 7% surge tomorrow before ER and blowout qt at 05 cents per share, shares surge 25% on Thursday"
As an investor in GoPro I am not selling my shares and will keep buying . The company has 6 successful products recently . Got faction again to be profitable and is cheaper than ever before .
My brokerage app is showing down 6%...yahoo app numbers are off
I thought the camera market was gone... Don't cell phones have cameras on them?
"Just trying to figure it out how shorts get exited if it has a good earning? Last quarter, the shares were heavily shorted from $10.5. If it has a good earning plus announcing new product, I hope GPRO can get back above 10."
Even a terminally ill patient can have days where they feel pretty good...but they are still terminally ill.
"They have been struggling ever since that artificial price on 9-30-14 of 93.70. Woodson or whatever his name is, was lucky he didn't end up in jail."
"Unfortunately GPRO doesn'T say that yesterday,while making a video for their publicity,a 30 years old italian guy lost is life in Austria on a base jumping attempt. It is very sad and I think I will use a GPRO camera only playing golf...."
Maybe AMBA will buy GoPro and make them start using their hardware again.It's as good as any other ideas these days.
maybe Nick should start investing in the blockchain frenzy GoPro blockchain.com
"I'm taking a break. Really tired of morons who automatically refuse to believe anything other than what they PRAY will happen, versus what the facts are. Really tired of fake Craig posting stupid things as if he is me, and no one here is even asking him to stop. If you cannot tell the difference between his posts and mine, well, you're still not that bright. And if you want to keep thinking that GoPro is a great investment, just remember that for 2 years now, I have tried to warn you, and it was over $50 back then and is only $8 now. Seem like a great investment? Not to me. Has GoPro learned from their mistakes? So far, there is no evidence to believe they have. Yes, they fired HUNDREDS of employees this year to ""cut costs"" but that does not make one a truly profitable company, it is only smoke and mirrors in the short term. No one left to fire next year. HERO6 isn't a game changer, Fusion is a niche within a niche with VR NOT being widely accepted at all for at least the next few years, and Karma 2? Who cares. I'll be back after they announce Q4 earnings and Q1 guidance, because I am SURE that morons such as leka, ace, john, etc will be silent as mice by then. Happy Holidays to all, even the morons. You couldn't bring one ounce of actual adult conversation to this board when someone disagreed with what you need to believe."
"Captain, we are prepared for take off. Chairs in the up right position, tray table locked...prepare the cabin for liftoff. GoPro"
The real reason Karma was shut down was because it still fell out of the sky and is a HUGE liability. This is Nick's KARMA alright!
"Last time I checked, GoPro is losing money..."
"ANYHOO, SEC FILING 2/5/20 BLACKROCK ACK, 6.8"
Any thoughts about upcoming earnings?
why do I need to get $400 camera when I have an iphone that does nearly everything.
who is going to buy GPRO
"GPRO ranked #1 Strong Buy by Zack’s. Posted this article last night, but was taken down for some reason: http://m.nasdaq.com/article/why-gopro-gpro-is-a-strong-growth-stock-cm865611"
"Ok my total share of broke is 445 :) ima get it to 1000 shares so when it hits 6 I just break even I bought most my shares at 7.90,7.60"
GoPro is up 11.26% to 11.96
"Caitlin last month$GPRO conversationBuyout imminent!....Betting on FB for $10-$12 share.GPRO was $7+ when Caitlin posted this.She is a bagholder there, and based on her noobness, I'm betting most everywhere she posts."
I know that I will get a chance to get out in 2018. I will wait till then.
Sold everything at 10.25. Lost over $30k on this scam stock.
"So the tiny GOPRO clown troll pretending to be a bear analyst for GoPro stock is critiquing an actual professional stock analyst's bullish call? The tiny troll's opinion is just re fabricated bear based agenda , propaganda. No position = No conviction FakeTiny troll, you should short the next pop. Teach you a lesson on opinions."
"What is amazing is GPRO doesn't rally with any sector, consumer or tech. On Black Friday there was a retailer that offered the Hero 6 for $425 with a $75 store gift card. It sold out quickly. Pretty clear the Hero 6 is overpriced. Woodman better adjust his thinking rather quickly or he won't have much of a company left next year."
"Personally I don't see the dji drones as good as there made out to be, lots of talk about the fact karma doesn't have obstacle avoidance well nor does dji mavic in reverse and if anything that's more often than not when people crash, secondly I think the camera on the dji mavic is way to flimsy and is going to cost loads to repair but as with karma everyone knows how tuff a GoPro is and also spare parts are easily bought from their website for Karma, I think with karmas other selling points and comparing it to what I've stated above the karma is gonna sell a lot more than the doom says think"
Apple will buy GoPro for 5billion USD!!!
Will invest before earning tomorrow. Snap took off after good news . This is the same .
"i drove by bestbuy this morning and saw a line out the door so i stopped by to see what was going on. people were all in line waiting to buy the hero 5. my goodness, this stock is going to the moon!!!! i'm cashing out my retirement savings and going all in now. everyone else on here is saying this is going to $100. i get to retire early."
This will triple from here. The chart is looking very strong here. New products will excite consumers in this year. It is turning tables around!!
In for a 50 -75 cent pop based purely on technicals. Let's go Gopro!!!
Wow the new go pro 8 series have some awesome features maybe we’ll see a pop
ouch
"I sold my 7500 Shares today under 14!The wife put her foot down and said 21kLoss is too much, I have to get a 2nd jobat radio shack for the next 5 years to make it up."

Jeremy said this stock was awesome. I hope he is right. :(
West Coast now awake.Taking GPRO solid GREEN!
just sold aapl and moved to gpro.. hopefully the launch of karma and possibly gp5 will create a big hype.
Only way bagholders recover any money from gopro fraudsters is thru class action lawsuits.
GoPro is about to buy that 1 billion valuation again .
This will hit more than $12 tomorrow. In their last earning it went up from $1.50 to $10 in one day. Shorts will be toasted tomorrow. Shorts will drive this stock to the moon today. Longs! Sit back and relax .... enjoy the ride
"GoPro is a ""Fun"" company, maybe it can branch into Activewear Apparel to leverage on the ""Fun"" image.Licking the wound for now......"
I worked for a company where the CEO was trying to take it to zero. Turns out he was working with an investment group on the side to buy it out for pennies on the dollar. He’s in prison now. Starting to wonder here.
"If it goes lower, I'm buying more! A little too high today so far to sell, but if it really spikes, I'm a very wealthy man! Remember, shares for the long haul, baby. . ."
Short volume now at 39.48 million up from 38.5 million . Clearly signs of rebound . We need to see short interest for 05/15/19 to see how much this is true. Will be over 40million and institutions still buying . When institutions buy it is a sign of extreme strength . Institutions now holding 60% shares up from 54%. Good signs . Keep buying.
It's ready to Tumble under $3.70 ....
Put in an order for 4.75 after hours. Hope it goes through.

"Today, Even volumes look healthy :)"
"Not for Nothing.Amazingly Positive reviews from actual purchasers of the Karma Drone.Who cares about the day traders, shorts, hedge funds. This is going much higher in next six months.That is all for now."
GPRO should find a way to integrate their camera's into popular vehicles and uber as part of vehicle package // maybe it is optional or maybe it can be integrated as a feature into high end cars as dashcam. That will totally improve profitability and can open up new cars to include similar options.

Nick woody buying
SUrprised up so high. Looking at their financials they burned through $70 Million in cash. They are going to need to raise cash fairly soon.
Karma was the only interesting product line at GoPro... Nobody wants an automatic camera with a small sensor... That’s called a cell phone camera.
"I’m going to college for chemistry! After that I’m launching a pharmaceutical company, y’all should buy my stock when it hits the streets"
Any buy out will be from Garmin. They have had talks before and will/should be even more interested now. Great fit.
Sold puts earlier today rip
Why is Craig not talking now? I don't get it! This stock is a really good opportunity to make money in future years. Those who remain bearish are because they don't want us to see that they were wrong
Woody will make Bernie Madoff look like a choir boy!!!
"Here comes Craig with his - ""words of wisdom""?? Tell us what you know Craig!"
The conference is today. Craig please keep talking more *#¥% about GoPro
We will be at $20.00 before 2nd quarter earnings.Don't forget this.

"After some research, rally ""might"", emphasis on might, be due to a drone patent. Maybe they learned from their first unsuccessful foray into the drone market."
"This Company still operates at a loss . No new news over past 3 months and up about 100% . Get out of the clouds people , this will reverse to 12 before it goes anywhere higher."
"With a potential opportunity to be bought, how much would you think this purchase would be for?"

A failed attmept by shorts . Good luck next time .
According to Buffet don’t ask the barber if you want hair cut . Don’t trust the experts . I have to say this I like Buffet.
This downward pressure makes no sense and I feel like I will add more shares into my current position. I don’t think there are any significant news and it’s just the charts traders. I am holding and increasing mine position at least.
I have a lot of skin in the game with this stock. I honestly wish it weren't so. The behavior of this stock unfortunately gives more heartburn and the danger is ever present. I remain a long-term believer that success is not impossible for this stock. I wish all holders well!
"Been roughly a week. I see we still have posters looking for 12s. jbrad -- you're as bad as Craig, who you constantly attack. If by here we come, you mean in a few months, well maybe. But certainly no time soon.This stock will continue to consolidate at these levels for at least 3 to 4 weeks and will probably test the low 9s and high 8s. See my post a week ago. Anyone looking for a quick pop should wait. Those holding probably won't see this go much lower UNLESS there are more issues with the Karma or the lawsuit settles for a larger amount than expected. The later probably won't occur and hopefully a good latch replaced the old one for the Karma battery.For those thinking the Karma is going to save this company -- the margins have been trimmed as drone companies are having issues with competition. GoPro needs to be smart all around... in their cameras, online offerings, drone technology and anything else they delve into.There is no reason this board needs to continue to be a source of misinformation. And barring any new information, history will repeat itself. Good luck to those holding."
I called To buy gopro at below 4$ now I call it a buy at below 10$.
overblown initial reaction. It's going to recover quickly. This company is killing it and will easily exceed the Q4 guidance given...LONG!
"I get off an airplane in Thailand a few hours ago. As I walk to customs area I'm greeted by the biggest , clearest digital billboard I've ever seen in an airport and I've seen a lot , I travel for a living. It's for the Huawei P10 smartphone. Extremely popular here in Asia. Every P10 and P10 Plus come preloaded with the GOPRO QUICK app. The growth potential for gpro internationally doesn't receive enough attention. Young demographics on the Asian continent, GOPRO brand. Saturation ? More like barely scratched the surface of their potential markets."
I think the chances of this going green today are the same chances of me getting laid tonight.
I tend to believe the high class Oppenheimer Funds over some site called Investor Place. Buy the dip.

"Fusion is actually pretty cool, at first I did not get the whole 360 thing, those videos make me sick, but the way they are editing them using over capture is amazing, I've been bag holding for a very long time... I'm -50%"
"While the exuberance before ER was short-sighted due to inflated projections, the negativity now is likewise exaggerated.This reminds me of Sq when Barrons and wallstjournal had a negative article when SQ was at 9 last year. From then on, it never looked back. I dont expect such a dramatic comeback but looks like Gpro is clearing the inventory for a reason and 360 camera has promise and very less branded competition and applications in VR. Markets are pricing for too much risk here..."
Ridiculous reaction to a decent earnings report.
"Is anyone REALLY surprised by the recent plummet in price since the small pop? Come on, guys...how many time are you going to let Woodman fool you and then blame him for it? I keep waiting for GPRO to do something right, but at some point, it's ""game over"" and the sun is quickly setting here. Sometimes, the better part of valor is to know when you're defeated and move your assets on to something stronger in hopes of winning the battles AND the war. GPRO is a lost cause right now."
GPRO was up over $2 last night in after market trading. HUGE volume. Earnings out on Thursday. Wonder why it fell back this morning? Any reasonable guesses?
"Nice move pre market on over 250,000 shares. Something good cooking in the oven!"

Nice start to the final say of trading this week! Thank you Motley Fool!
I’m out. Great run from below 4.00. But true to GPRO history we will correct before earnings on 11/5 back below 5.00. I will buy back at a lower price. Way too much profit here to pass up. I’m sure a lot of traders are saying this right now. Good luck!
I don't know why any company would want to buy this......what value could they offer? All their products can be made better and cheaper.
Come on gopro touch 6$ today then it will reach 9$ this week
$96 to $5 and the stock is still overvalued. Sad.
Spin spin spin. Nothing changes. New lows comming unfortunetly. Cutting cost to stay afloat is not a solution.

Only 4 days until we get exciting news and a large beat on earnings. This is going to be the best news we have heard in years. As long term investors (we deserve every thing we get) Have been holding since 2014. THANK YOU JESUS.

Nick Woodman wants to raise his annual salary from $1 to $10 Milllion. What do investors say?
Get ready for Blast off today!!!!!
GPRO is perfectly positioned with the social media crazed of vloggers. Hero6 and QuickStories= GROWTH!!
"Could GoPro make a delivery DRONE for AMAZON fleet delivery?! Just a question for the ""experts "" trolls short irrelevance unnecessary ."
"Dear Woody! PLEASE knock off the freakin' arrogance and step aside. OK - you and your team have developed a good product, but over the years, you've proven that you're NOT an effective CEO, so PLEASE:1. Quit taking GoPro videos of yourself ""shootin' the curl"" at some international beach, and get back to San Mateo and sell the GoPro to either Apple or some other known company with a more proven team of corporate executives. Or....2. Bring on-board (no pun intended) a new GoPro CEO and corporate management team, and do what you guys do best (as far as GoPro is concerned) and retreat to hanging-ten in GoPro's Research and Development Dept.Again; the GoPro product is a very desirable product, but unfortunately the GoPro Corporation has ineffective ""surf-dudes"" running this approaching wipe-out of a Surfing Safari company."
"Get ready, kids, it's about to start again. Here comes the profit taking, and the share price plummets to $3.70 or so. It does this every time and continues to fool people like Alain, who can only thumbs down this post, but not deny it once it actually happens."
"This little correction will be over soon and then, we will see this thing grow the way it should!"
we are getting to it
"Never thought I'd post a comment on here but here goes. Clearly GoPro has had execution issues, which (in the grand scheme) are minor to be honest. Failed session year, Drone recall, whatever. 36% of the float is short, trading at @$10 on NO volume. Means that no more bad news will drive us longs out. GoPro has a synonymous brand, has acquired 3 software companies, and has a much larger vision than playing tug of war with DJI for drone sales. If you want to race drones by a DJI, great, Woodman will tell you the same thing. They do not provide a life solution tying the whole package together nor do they have the vision GPRO does. Even if it's still years in the making customers believe in the brand. It's cameras are built like a rock, and you can bet they won't sacrifice quality on the future of Karma. Lastly, GPRO has what the greatest companies in the world have; tactile greatness. When you see and feel an iPhone, or a macbook, they look and feel superior to anything else. Well, when you see and hold a hero5 you want it plain and simple, when you look at karma vs. any other drone, you want it. Longs (from any price) still holding are smart to do so, in a decade they will be a major media player in a market that doesn't exist yet and the shares have the potential to reach all-time highs. Non-believers are following Wall Street propaganda which is standard, but visionaries and artists can see that this is much more than ""just another holiday product"" as you'll be blasted with by the news and doubters because they're ""technical short-term critics."" Jobs was a decade ahead of technology, as GoPro is and will continue to be. 4K (streaming rate 25 MBits) is not provided/cheap/or easily accessible bandwidth to 70% of those paying for service. I began to recently doubt Nick's execution abilities recently but had to bring myself back to the ground and remember, 36% IS SHORT. THEY LEGALLY HAVE TO COVER PEOPLE. Let's not forget they aren't actual equity they're arbitrary shares in the float. You can be the biggest bear in the world and I'd still bet against you. GoPro, sounds superior when you say it, provides superior products when you see/touch/use it, and is now getting into easy-to-use editing and content delivery? Good luck to those who are short, but just know when the squeeze hits, it won't be a 10 or 20% increase like so in the past, it'll be a $10/$20 one. In the end, Brand name wins. You don't say tissue you say Kleenex. You don't say action camera you say GoPro. 2020 will be north of $100. Good day"
Where did Leka go? I miss hearing about all the money he is making on GoPro.
"Only down 10 cents, Nick is really going easy on bagholders today. Tomorrow he won't be so nice. :-)"
Elon Musk: Google's AI camera doesn't even pretend to be innocent.
what to look for in Q3 earnings report. Revenue of 270 million average consensus vs last Q3 was 290 million. number of units of hero 7 and fusions sold. gross margin near to 35%. international growth in units and revenue. forecasts as well for Q4. as far as what i think from watching investor relations on gopro official website i think since last quarter they have been successful in selling gopro cameras plus they also started yearly membership with some benefits. at this point i am not really sure what they want to achieve through this membership. i think they will beat revenue with some big numbers if they did sell hero 7 cameras as they have mentioned. Will be adding more shares soon.
$GPRO ships its first new 5.2K spherical camera Fusion pilot units.... http://alph.st/b988032c
"Woodman ruined the deal with DJI and he will ruin it with Xiaomi. This $199 Hero camera just shows that he never did learn that nobody ever did want these entry-level cameras. Interesting that the session form factor is no longer. The camera trade in program proves that they are not moving cameras and have excess inventory on the books. We are witnessing a real death spiral in this company. No talent, no innovation, no real new product, no direction, out of ideas, just a ghost brand at this point."
"Sold 5000sh at 7.49$, 3500$ PROFIT EASY"
"Wow, green"
Nick Woodman believes GoPro is extremely over-valued. He thinks it should trade below $1.
Gopro Earnings winner!!
Where is the genius Moi?
I added more today
"So In 2016 i was told by a guy that hes shorting the market because it a long bull market. My thesis was dude you are wrong , there are no signs of economic slow down. right now we are mostly in debt but a long as consumers spending the economy will keep growing and so will the bull market. If there are any significant signs of consumer spending slow down that would be the day i would sell but for now just chill."
Like clock work sliding red
This company can't execute.
told you to hold...
To Gopro shareholder
If they fire woodman this will be at 20 dollars on that day
"The reason for the discrepancy in analysts expected revenue and management's projections is because analysts expected GoPro to sell Fusion retail out of brick and mortar stores. GoPro is holding off on doing this until Q1 when they update the software, because they don't want to mass sell the product when the software is not completely ready; selling on their own channel, they're providing that caveat regarding the updates. So now the guidance for Q1 is going to be way higher than analyst estimates once Fusion hits retail."
Market is so overreacted. GoPro will beat their estimation for Q4 just like they did in Q3. They’re being conservative. Short term $13.
Does this company have a future?
Buy NOW for BUYOUT!
Are we finally about to see profits and gross margin expansion as well as net profit expansion ? It’s more than likely now .
Love to come back and look at the one of the worst IPO's to ever list on the nasdaq. This stock has missed the entire bull market. Gopro has been discounting their cameras for months. HERO7 Silver 4K Action Camera for $179.99 on Google express. This is a $2 stock at best.
Anybody else feel the GPRO stock hitting the $20 - $23 mark by Christmas?
Oppenheimer upgrades gopro to outperform with a $10.00 price target.GO GO GPRO.
Thanks for the easy money. A week to the day same thing happened to FIT. See you at under $4.50 soon.
"Don't have a herd mentatilty, Gopro did not give great expectation for 2017 just in case they don't make it, But the demand for their Karma unit and hero 5 all over the word including USA said something else, IMHO the first Q of 2017 will tell otherwise and will blow all the analyst brains out. I am long."
Where is Reddit?
Hope for fall to low 5’s and buy more for prep move up in anticipation and actual earnings report and new product launch.
roooofl going down down down :Ddd told you to leave this hip guys
Please someone come help
Starting to go beserk.Big BUYS
Motley Fool latest article on VR talks about Google and Apple (big tech) if they'd be able to make VR much more than a toy. Don't mention GOPRO who has a better VR EXPERIENCE than both Apple and Google Samdung or FB.. iIf GoPro is a BO it's going to be with a Huge price premium 50+ ps Whatever price BO would be best for all shareholders. Let's move on w/a GoPro BO or make a move already WOODMAN its primed either way.
News coming?
GoPro is down 13.16% to 4.29
"This stock continues to be overvalued. The Q1 earnings beat was minor and a red herring. They're growing revenue artificially by offering a discount to subscribers on all equipment purchases. This strategy increases revenue but it also jacks up COGS. As they acquire subscribers their margins should be improving but currently they are not, this is the result of the artificial manipulation of revenues through the promotion."
I think we close right at $7.... Good work GPRO keep it up.
Time to buy
Looking like the Last Chance to Grab this stock in the low 7's. Oversold again considering recent good news.
Love the dip. Adding more to my portfolio.
I see lot of news on gopro today after longtime..
heading to 5.00 Woody
"Following Woodman's comments yesterday, I am issuing a buy rating on GPRO with a target of 11.75 before year's end. A lot of loose ends to tie up, but if his answers were correct, they appear to be making headway and the market will respond."
"I’d rather buy a footlong than a share of this, but I guess after 5-6 hours I’d end up with the equivalent of a share of this..."
gpro has been on my watchlist for awhile. I will initiate a position tomorrow if it stays below $6. Exceptional earnings report in this climate.
This jewel will be $10.00 or better by week end. GO-GO GPRO. THANK YOU JESUS.
"I see a Double Top, next week I see us drifting sideways for awhile until a shoe drops.."
"can the mavic detach its camera to use with a gimble? detach it to be use underwater, scuba, snorkeling, surfing, biking, hiking, sports, snowboarding etc?!?! So, don't just compare them on what their drone features are, compare all of their capabilities..."
NEWSFLASH! GoPro COULD climb above $15 today! Apple COULD buy it! Nick COULD step down! Leka COULD cost average (again)
"I see today is a really good day for GPRO stock. It pulled in a smidge, was defended, then finished nicely. It's relative strength is still there. It's uptrend should continue tomorrow as the profit takers diminish and DJI's product launch becomes old news."
Woodman said he preferred to stay independant! The balls on this guy.
In his interview it sounds like he is not against selling the company or merging the company
Holy cow what a hold...... I smell buyout news coming out soon....
"GoPro CEO to investors: We are right where we want to be. Stock price to Nick, how do you like me now."
GOPRO 6.48 WHATSSSS? OMG ..... NEWS?
"This idiot named Craig didn’t read the letter , where KORR says it’s undervalued and this is what I have been screaming for a while . I am patient enough and will keepBuying shares as strategic buyers like Google and Garmin can pay 15$ easily for the brand and company ."
"Last call to BUY orCOVER SHORTS b4NYC major appearanceat Citi Global TechConference NYC Wed.,news and upward guidance! California is buying. That speaks volumes!!"
I have seen that people short this stock based on revenue estimates for Q4 and believe me the company is taking very small steps to make sure it’s profitable in 2019. Just watch and buy at the bottom . I will be adding 1000-5000 shares soon . Best of luck to the shorts
"According to the last article by Simply wall Street. Consensus number for year 2021 have gone from 1.08 Bill , 44 cents eps to 1.09 Bill, 41 cents eps. There is very little room for GPRO. If they have a hiccup we are slammed. If they outperform We should see a decent price upward. According to the conference call last week they said 25% above last years numbers. They did 892Mill. That would be 1.11 Bill. Not much above consensus. Im and worried.2022 consensus is approx 80-90 cents EPS as high as $1.17 . As long as market stays strong and they meet or beat we can see a stock price of $15-20 after two qtrs of meet or beat based on forward 2022 . Not very exciting for the risk. Ill probably stay long but they have no wiggle room."
PUSH PUSH PUSH PUSH TO $20.00
Why would the Chinese want GoPro? There are numerous cheap knock-offs on the market at a fraction of GoPro cameras. I don't think it will happen.
Chart says 8 once new 52 week high printed.

https://www.cnn.com/videos/travel/2019/07/22/eagles-gopro-selfie-newssource-travel.cnn
let me see my crystal ball
SNAP acquiring GPRO seems like the most likely and logical outcome here.
change the name Gopro to Gocrytos then we'll see this company sky rocket high again.
"HERE IS WHAT WILL HAPPEN. When GoPro announces earnings, people like mark, mike, and jbrad will feel completely right about everything, while of course failing to consider the difficult future for GoPro in the coming year. Since they only hear what they want to hear and will consider nothing else, there is no point in sharing thoughts with them unless you're singing the same tune, because you'll just get called names like a 3rd grader might do. You know what, guys? The board is all yours. Just because you might trade seats on the Titanic doesn't mean you made a good deal. Just because you didn't get the bullet THIS TIME in Russian Roulette doesn't mean that when you play again in 3 months, you won't blow your head off. You guys congratulate yourselves too much, but then again, that is what scared, desperate people who cling to each other do when given any shred of positive news, even if that news could be ""The ship is sinking, just slower than before."" That's it. I'm out. If anyone wants to have debates without name calling and childish garbage, I'm all for it, but when I thought jbrad and I were doing that the other day, he had to revert right back to being the lowest common denominator kind of guy that he is. All we can expect, is that jbrad, mark, and mike will be who they are."
Is buyout real?
"Have been looking for a Hero 7 silver bundle, which I should have bought before Thanksgiving. The prices just keep going up. Good for Gopro???"
"This entire IPO was an orchestrated scam. This stock once traded for $98. That was 10 seconds before the CEO broke the lockout period agreement and ""donated"" $500m in shares to charity and cashed in another $500m. That alone was worth more than the company today... not including the payouts to family members. And the company did nothing since then. Just sold a few more cameras and bought a yacht."

I think Nancy ripped up the good report
lol My name is clown Mark I am rich and own 5500 shares of GPRO yea I became rich because I pick winners. Lol dude the only way you have any wealth is because you inherited it. Don't worry there is hope for you keep finding GoPro stocks to invest in and hold them till they go bankrupt. That way your parents will b so proud of you. Mark your well on your way. Keep finding those winners and never sell
"The GOPRO Karma Drone will be ""the best available drone, for the price, for sale to the public , for spring break/ summer action. New features assures this . Something substantial about to be announced? Only a SURFER KNOWS"

"Nick wants all investor money to fund his yachts #$%$ and blow, party -time with his surfer bros."
"Have to say........... overall this board has very little following, like the stock. Anyone know of any boards or sights with more individuals involved for more conversation and opinion on GPRO???"
Did GoPro ever come up with a fix for all those expensive drones that got bricked Jan 1st?
Is GoPro now GonePro?
sentiment is so bad that it will bounce 10-15% as long as ER is not terrible - IMO
"Guys, my cats give me good advice."
"I wish I had the wisdom of Just Moi. So... horrible earnings, lack of product and recalling all drones. Yet we sit here above 10. Now I called averaging down in the low 9s... and if all this didn't push the stock there, well I'm not sure what it will take. I believe I will average down to the high 12s with a purchase at 10 or very close to. Seriously... some people here must have no one to talk to!!! ;) Good luck everyone and look for the 10 day MA to flatten out as a sign that we will have a short spin up."
it won't take much to get this stock to wake up and be above $50. The only thing that will hurt this stock will be a bear market or crash. if that happens a better spot to buy. The stock has a lot going for it. Could easily get hot and make a run on the smallest good news!
Buying GoPro was such a bad decision. Rookie mistake!
About to bust through $900-million market cap!
Shorts are fighting til the last minute. That is incredible 
no word!! gopro need a new CEO
Going RED now..... Nose Dive
This is one of those days when Craig Classic runs off and hides.
This Jewel is going to ROCK. THANK YOU JESUS
My GPRO calls were up 70% today. NICE!!
Should I buy myself an unexpected early Christmas gift?
Thanks to whomever sold me those shares at 3.28 yesterday. Just sold 2/3 of my GoPro at 3.65 maintain core til next year. Good luck longs!
What’s cooking here ???
Just like Fitbit best. Doubles??
na na na nana na na nahey hey hey good bye
Thank you Sam 
"Okay, I’ve been watching this for a while. GoPro probably has a trick up their sleeve that will boost sales and make a pretty good profit. Cameras are now used EVERYWHERE. Yeah, they didn’t get on with the police cams, but there are still so many more opportunities for them. Maybe another company will not make Nick an offer. Maybe will go with the Chinese junk. Maybe GoPro will fizzle out and go away. But like it or not, believe it or not, the name and actual product is worth a hell of a lot. Everyone should know that. My bet is that it will go up nicely. The reasons to be bullish far outweigh reasons to be bearish. Now I’m in at about $4, so I have much less risk than those who bought in much higher. So (I think) that if you are in at any price, stay in. Plus this is a great day trader. . . but but be careful of missing out on a run up."
we we taking dollars here 6 7 8 then we get hot
"Disappointing, I was expecting $7 by now!"
"Costco is selling the Hero 5 bundle for $290 and the response is very positive at that price. Woodman just doesn't get it, he has priced his products too high with the all the new competition. I am willing bet at the first of the year Karma, Hero 5 and 6 will all come down in price."
John is correct in his analysis but worse case the stock holds 200 day moving average 9.5+ on 5 million share volume. To those that listen to Craig guys please do some research before you listen to anyone on this board.
I’m glad I’m finally on the sidelines after selling at year end taking my huge loss from $25. CEO is clueless and stock is the worst POS ever. I’m sure going back to $3 soon. I was always so hopeful but always got disappointed. Do yourself a favor and get out.
put a fork in it. its done
Tax loss selling. That's all.
"Desperately Seeking Craig Classic. Wherefore art thou, Craig Classic???"
Huge losses last quarter compared to last year.wow
Waking up on West Coast...look for new HOD real soon!
Horror show. Remember when Cramer said ya gotta own this one?
"I've been complaining to GoPro twitter almost every day and gets no answer. I know it may not work, but how about we all go to twitter and ask them to release any status about Karma recall or Hero 5? If enough people demand. They may release something."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gopro-announces-preliminary-fourth-quarter-140000159.htmlAs I said - NO DRONE, DONE. COMPANY BEING GUTTED TO REDUCE COSTS AND SHOW A PROFIT. IT'S OVER."
"People liked the earnings, this weeks been a buy low frenzy for some people, shorts to cover now and on to 5$ hopefully, GL longs and shorts"
I want you to notice
EASY $10 stock.
Quick update: Expect us to close under 9 today but possibly above 9 tomorrow. Looking like a light trading day of about 1.5M shares. Would expect the same tomorrow. Next week is when buying should pick up for swing traders -- no reason to hold through the weekend if you are only looking for the pre-ER pop. All significant technicals pointing upward entering a slightly overbought range. Expect to see fully overbought before earnings. Good luck to all holding.
I personally read all of the statement and forecasts are really good with some new products coming in Q4. Don’t miss this opportunity and buy the stock before it even goes up again. I mentioned a while ago to buy or you will have to buy above 8$ after this quarter which is more likely now. Congrats for a good quarter . Don’t worry about the cash decrease as GoPro expecting to have more than 200 million in cash by the end of Q4. Bets of luck bulls.
"Earnings disappointment. As a long time holder, I'm immune to this news as I'm so used to it."
Remember back in the day it used trade in the 80s. Always risky to buy one-trick ponies. RIP.
Incredible strength considering the market crashing. Looks like money is going into small caps. Does gopro ever announce sales from holidays like Father's Day or do they keep pretty quiet about everything?

"Unbelievable , after all the good news that we had , GoPro stock seems to be the worst ( Most hated ) stock of the Nasdaq ! ! It’s for sure the most frustrating stock , just going down , I am definitely regret to haven’t sold it at 11.89 in late September , unfortunately it just went up for 2 days, and in that days no one could knew of the drastic (crazy ) and continue sell off that was coming in October/November !! Just unbelievable , if I were nik , I would try to make a buyback at this price instead of wait ...."
Great keep going up
Volume is now 7 million. next day should be 5 then 3 and then 2 or under. reversal on the horizon again.
seems that some ppl are already covering!!!! good luck to all the longs!! never been more confident about an earning :)
"Ok, the moment you've all been waiting for....this is my final GPRO post. I'm tired of waiting for it to rebound and for you pumpers to finally accept that the company is an unmitigated disaster. If that Korr letter wasn't a clear VOTE OF NO CONFIDENCE in management to you, then you really deserve to lose your money. Sarwar, John...I'd say good luck, but you don't understand luck when it's in front of you. As I write this, GPRO has plummeted another $.12 to $3.78 after you were certain it'd be headed to $7-9 now. You both like getting punched in the face. You're not fun anymore. It's boring and sad. Have fun pumping each other as the price falls until they get new management or a buyout at a bargain basement price that is nowhere near what it could/should have been. CK1 out."
I'm hoping for it to stay around the $5.20s today

"Decent day today, people just riding the buzz into ER, or is it possible that this can hold after?"
Profit taking.
the bar was set too high compared with other quarters
not 1 reason to buy
"Remember - the Gopro camera product is quality. It's the Gopro management that needs changing. This company, in the hands of quality management, could fly....even without a drone."
"""Given these dynamics, I think it’s likely GPRO does grow revenues 10% per year over the next five years and gets operating margins to around 10% (where they were in 2012 and 2013). That implies $1.9 billion in revenues and $190 million in operating profits in five years."" Quote from the investor place article."
I can think of many profitable directions for GoPro products... ?????Drones?????
Woodman over promises and never delivers
This is how a Over valued ...Over priced stock acts ... up 1 cent ...then flat....then DOWN

"HERO7 Black is driving the highest levels of social engagement we've seen for a new GoPro, and we've seen correspondingly strong sales at GoPro.com during the week since launch,"" said GoPro founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman.

Lehman like market disaster could happen this week warns analyst . My reply I hope it happens sooner than later so we can buy cheap stocks. Shorts should short double and GoPro volume decrease shows that shorts don’t believe in much down side . Come on you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out . As the stock goes down volume decreases meaning a reversal is more imminent than ever before . Stock up on this one .

I guess I should have bought in today. I really though the market was going to push this down. Is this a headfake in order to sell calls and then bring it underwater?
"I understand there's a lot of pain and fear in this stock but for me my thesis is simple. Good brand in niche markets, simplified product line, and entering a hyper growth market at the right time. If they can fix Karma in short order this thing has good upside. The consumer drone market should come in around 500M this year and is projected to grow north of 1 Billion in the next 2 years with DJI owning 70% market share. IMO Karma capturing 20% marketshare in short order once they get going is realistic given their camera install base and it represents a great potential growing revenue stream for GoPro which solves a lot of problems. As a consumer who does not own a drone but considering one (they are too cool!) the purchase is a no-brainer based on flexibility. Getting a drone and a top of the line removable camera gives me two toys instead of one and I like getting the most bang for my buck. I don't know much about drones but it doesn't look like DJI's are removable. My two cents."
"where do u guys, and ladies, see this stock going pre karma. up or down? no conspiracy theories please."
any price under 10 is a good buy
GOPRO GETS A BUY FROM ZACKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
From -9% to green in one hour. Crazy. I think everyone can agree about this.
This 10% gain hardly puts a dent in my short position. Staying short.
Why falling.???
The turnaround has begun!
Back in after being out for about a year and a half. I think the GoPro Hero 7 lineup is going to be a turning point for this company. I bought a GoPro Hero 3 long ago and had not wanted to buy any of the new cameras until now. I also saw a video where Peter McKinnon on YouTube gave a positive review and many commentators were saying they stayed away from previous models because of his negative reviews in the past but were thinking about buying one now. There is definitely more challenges ahead and the market will demand many more advancements but this is a step in the right direction.
Thoughts where this will go today?

My first choice is a fixed GoPro for the best possible quality, and heck I might even get into some Podcast, Youtube, or Onlyfans business on the weekends. Seriously, the stay at home high-end worker is driving this cycle and the numbers will be shocking. Then we get the pent-up demand when everyone goes backpacking this summer after watching mega-hours of Netflix adventures during the COVID. Clears $17 and next stop will be $40 from a technical point of view."

"Pull up a long term chart of Gpro and other than the four month IPO rally this stock has fallen like a brick. The shorts are looking long term and they don't see a future here. Every move up is sold. Even when they re release Karma they are late to the game. Stock won't go up, new low coming. What a horrible investment and management team. Shorts have made a killing and they aren't done yet. So many great companies out there. Other than a short covering rally why bother with Gpro."
Bankruptcy in 2018 for GoBroke!
Continuous squeeze into teens. GPRO will roar back
Wow Cramer is positive on Gopro and even many other analysts that good for stock
GPRO Woodman FIRE YOURSELF
Don’t compare $GPRO to a $GME or $AMC. GME needs to change their model to stay relevant and hopefully can. $AMC is completely relevant if they survive the now. There will be a huge get out the house trend once people feel safe to go in a theater around a bunch of people for two hours. I liken GPRO to $DDD which turned around its business now and saw a huge gain as a result that stayed. Staying somewhat off the radar and keeping the inflated price since success now could be tied to the price move.
blackrock inc owns more than 5% of gopro
could we see a halt after close news pending? We shall see!
Wheres our upgrades???
"It is still a rumor and only going up because of hype. Probably won't get in until I see some more positive feedback. Been in a lot of ""we are merging or buying out"" situation and it hasn't been the best scenario."
"Volume coming in. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline. Looking for breakout at 6.40."
Does anyone think this can hit 30?
I want to see if these people on both side who either like or dislike Gpro will be mature enough to admit they were wrong when the stock goes up to $12 or down $4.(Or just down or up in general doesn't have to be those numbers specially) I can tell you me personally I'm down 5% and at least for 2018 I see this stock easily going past $10. only time will tell and the silence of those who can't admit when they are wrong. Go luck I hope you guys make money if not with GPRO with your other investments.

just technicals.... unless we get 5.4 by close; forget it -
"Wouldn't read too much into Woodman's sale: has to be after the quarter results due to SEC rules/quiet period.If this is an automatic plan, he might be setting a precedent to say he sells periodically (did at 8s, doing at 12s, then 15s etc.)as well without causing shareholder panic at time of each automatic sale.If he is indeed desparate, he'd sell off gpro to Appl or someone, rather than low. This may be a good sign after all..."
nice close today on the stock? good buying volume on close
It looks like GoPro did not have a very good Black Friday weekend. Color me shocked...
Don’t have any positions in GoPro any more. But hate to say that GoPro is going back to 9 in a week.
GoPro will become a top ten viewer on YouTube soon. They have already plans to monetize content and reward creator of contents . I can see expanding margins and revenue growth as well as profit beats. Just buy this stock too cheap now.
"Yikes. Latest short interest numbers in. https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gpro/short-interestFor such a decline in share price, shorts collectively think this is going much lower. Like BK. Man, 25 million shares still short. Sorry, they all know something more than me... us."

Gopro is now a great hedge for a market crash - great upside potential - at 3.5 back up the truck and buy all you can.

GPRO reached a new All Time Low at 6.69
From a technical point of view this should pop to about 6.30-6.40 and then have a large sell off... earnings report will play a major roll into the drop
"Hey Sarwar! It's 7:30am PST 10/26 and GPRO is down another 5% or so. Remember what I said last week? I told you it was going to go up (which it did) and then drop lower than it was before it started going up. This is EXACTLY what is happening. How did I know this? It's called paying attention to the past 18 months of share price movement. Wishing and hoping doesn't replace cold, hard fact. Sorry, man. I hope you get your amazing sales for Q4, but remember, just because you lose $100 million instead of $110 million the year before doesn't make you a profitable company or a good investment long term. Those who don't learn from history..."

Lower trade volume, in general, makes it easier for institutional manipulation to drive this stock up and down for their investment return benefit (some covering short positions, some bringing the price down to scoop up big lots cheaper).2)Even though the young management team has made some stupid blunders over the past 3 years, the products are still well received. And the company has strong branding.3) Just like any other stock, GoPro is also driven by Geo Political, interest rate adjustments, and all other noticeable market swings in general (such as yesterdaay). On a day like yesterday a lot of people will exit the market in fear of a repeat of 2008.4) Once GoPro shows profit for number of quarters (and it will soon) the picture will become much more positive."
"they missed expectations by 173%; whoa, lookout below!"
Everyone get your Go Pro out for this epic drop because the volume came to a standstill!
"Greetings sports fans, Gopro fumbled the ball on Sunday, a fitting day to fumble the ball, however, if they can play some really good defense like that of the Seahawks for now, they could get the ball back and score a touchdown to win, or at least a field goal to get some points on the board."
"Obviously GOPRO product sales have passed both WS estimations and GOPRO company guidance . Products sales #s will continue to climb to record quarterly revenues driven by spring break KARMA and Hero5 sales and cost reductions due to job cutsNext quarter more of the same with summer sales OF KARMA , NEW GOPRO HERO6, VR nearing much anticipated release along w/ a BIG BIG PARTNERSHIP announcement. GoPro shorts squeeze through Friday and if the shorts don't cover they die trying Monday. If momentum swings bullish (and it will) we will see SP rise very quickly due to institutions overplaying their short bets."
"• GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) is scheduled to announce Q1 earnings results on Thursday, May 6th, after market close. • The consensus EPS Estimate is $0.00 (+100.0% Y/Y) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $186.72M (+56.4% Y/Y). • Over the last 2 years, GPRO has beaten EPS estimates 63% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 63% of the time. • Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 3 upward revisions and 1 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 1 downward."
Shorts are nervous. We can run this thing. Don’t be bashful
Sold half my position
"There should be a special board for people who bought $Gpro, $Fit, $Twtr, and $Snap. Therapy group."
Why hasn't GoBroke filed BK yet?
"Nick should make an energy drink! GoPro, makes the most sense."
Gopro breaking above buy point in cup and handle formation but the volume is not there so it will probably fail.
Finally even!!!!!! Had many moments of selling this but I’m glad I got my gains back
"broke $5.90, never look back."
either u with us or against us. if u against us just cash out!!!
If there are potential buyers why buy now and not wait. It is becoming cheaper everyday.
GoPro is down 5.85% to 3.80
Where is the volume ? 
go go go
"GoPro dumb short midgets been covering all week. GoPro @9.50 triggers short squeeze . The really dumb shorts cover all next week.See the difference? ""dumb GoPro shorts"" covered this week and ""really dumb shorts "" (ie Craig the troll) will get squeezed next week. GOPRO BEATS 3Q2017 ER HUUUGE.Thank you President Trump !!!!"
"The Hero 8 and Max are awesome! I'm a Hero 5 owner, which I love. Couldn't see the reason to go with the 6. I'm trying to figure out how to hide the Max I plan to buy from my wife :)I think we'll see improvements in revenues and net income over the next year. I can see a lot of owners upgrading to the new cameras. And if GoPro announces something new in a new category, like dash cam, body cam, home security cam, etc....could see a large jump in share price and revenue. I think shareholders at sub-$4 level will ultimately be rewarded nicely over the long haul."
"ER on February 4th has great potential. But it could go either way, GoPro ERs hasn't been consistent."
"I’m glad to see this doing well from a price standpoint; good to see the cloud membership growing. My concern from a long term growth standpoint is what comes after GoPro Black 9? Black 10? What else can they be working on to keep this going? Otherwise there is risk of it topping off at 10-12 and go stagnant again. Maybe beat case scenario is it gets bought out while it’s hot? Thoughts? Full disclosure - my average purchase price is $6.50 and I hold about 14,000 shares. Need an exit strategy"
Weird stock. Cant figure this one out.
Simple question. Who owns this conversation room. Bulls or Bears?
Guys i have to say i was wrong. In reading the last earnings call i didn't realize how well the company was doing. I am LONG go go pro!!!
"""Woodman steps down as Apple Inc. acquires GoPro"" - Future headline... circa 2018.... us Longs can only dream of that day!"
Woodman is a joke. Who would buy a subscription from GoPro? Out of his mind.
"Hahah the WSB crew is starting to look at GPRO position, LETS RIDE!"
"Should be an interesting week, are they gonna release a consumer vr rig?"
The earning release was excellent IMO. Not worried in the least. The after hours action is just noise that will shake out weak hands. It gives us opportunity to scoop up cheap shares tomorrow morning. It is quite clear that the company has turned a new page.
"Does ""Craig"" STILL own this board? (LOL)"
Well looks like my short position will be turning green today.
Why there are so many of these class action cases recently? I lose big and no longer hold GPRO anymore. But there are three law firms filed class actions against the same thing? I also see the same thing on Intel and AMD. Give me a break.
Go pro needs innovation. DJI is coming to eat it’s lunch real quick.
Stock markets all time highs. Economy best we have seen in 50 years. This is going to end bad for GoPro when the economy goes south.
plss go up to 5
"Pitching a new reality show... get Nick, Martha Stuart, the founder of theranos, and bill Akman to host an investment show and call it sheet tanked..... contestants win if the DONT invest in their companies."
redPro
New action cam releasing soon. Looking forward to that.
"While this company is still likely destined for bankruptcy unless it is bought out by another one, the reaction to the earnings report seems a little overblown. Both revenues and net income increased significantly from a year ago, and net income as a percentage of revenues increased even higher. This is definitely a 'well it didn't meet the smart Wall Street analysts' expectations' kind of a sell-off. I certainly would not buy any more of this stock, but I will just continue holding what I have for now and hoping for that buy-out. And if it doesn't come by December, then I will likely sell it and take the tax write-off. I have little chance of ever getting back to break-even, but I don't need this big of a write-off either."
Also hearing buyout imminent on strength of return to profitability
Nicholas will undoubtedly torpedo any possible deal. Guaranteed!
At launching pad forSecond Quarter Profit!
Heading to $4?
Nick has more important things to worry about other than his failing company like scheduling his teeth whittening appt.
buy out is the ONLY hope for this POS!!
why down?
10AM buying frenzy. let's go
Hopefully they are getting bought out.
I just added few more shares of gopro I don’t want to miss this ride. This buyout is going to happen.
It's bound to happen. Just wait for it and you will be a happy man or woman. #$GPRO diamond hands to the moon #next meme stock
"The short-squeeze has arrived! Don't try and tell me I'm wrong either, with the number of shares traded today, you have no rational..."
"Wow. The price shot up, and then profit taking brought it right back down. Gee, we have only been seeing that for the past 3 years...I am sure Sarwar has learned nothing."
I'll hang on to it for a few more weeks to see what happens. Can't go much lower and worth the risk IMO.
An upgrade or two and we squeeze the shorts!!
"In 2014, Woodman was the highest paid US chief executive, paying himself $235 million while GoPro earned profits of $128 million. Woodman has announced that he is open to selling GoPro. ~~~~~~ This is the guy you want to invest in, Sarwar? Even he wants out!"

The reviews of GoPro 6 is amazing. I had the buy th stock after the upgrade by Oppenheimer. Just buy and hold.
Higher highs +Higher lows...Just sayin'...HINT!
3 upgrades tomorrow 10.00 price target coming
The level of stability in Hero 7 is a breakthrough without even a gimbal attached.
I hope this has a giant short squeeze coming! love GoPro! come on WSB
Im going to say it... this company is complete and utter #$%$. zero intrest in Gobroke anymore.
Just stopped by a freddies and they are almost completely out of hero 5 and 6. Just think about it. They could definitely use this technology for drones.
As I said earlier get ready for double digits .
They should get in the home security camera game.
Are we gonna break 4.00 ohmygosh.
"GoPro isn’t making more money and seeing fatter margins to hit adjusted profitability, they are simply cutting expenses. More debt than cash. R & D is toast. Woodman will sail away on his yacht and leave longs with a huge tax write off. Happy ending."
showing strength. It only counts if closes above 7 today
What's Next for GoPro: Interview From CES | GearJunkiehttps://gearjunkie.com › gopro-2020-ces-interviewAn interview with Nick Woodman at CES today
Lol I just watched a video of DJI action cam and it isn’t even close on stabilization so my guess is GoPro customers are not going to change . But it was a good try by DJI a Chinese company to copy patent if Gopros. I honestly think trump should ban DJI action cams because they copy every thing. Should be first thing for trump in morning hahahahaha.
Will be $5 next week and then steady decline below $1 with eventual Bankruptcy thereafter.
Shorts trying so hard right now! Shorties burning on the dance floor! Bye! Squeeze is coming!
When will the short covering start?
"down day, low than normal volume. seems like selling is finally drying up. Will go higher when they release qtly in April. 25% rev growth and 100% subscription growth. Please make your numbers......"
"Oh, and casinos are different. You are pretty much guaranteed to lose money, they will even tell you how much you will lose. It is 100% based on luck, except for certain card games. . . I'd rather play the stock market casino or none at all."
GOPRO 8.50+ w/green market today ?!Bought AMD @14.07 yesterday morning hope GOPRO can bounce like that Aug1st ER!!?
Please note that the Chinese company DJI has a terrible reputation for customer service ( just do a little research on line).It's going to be very interesting to see what happens when the DJI- Osmo Action ( Dji's Chinese knockoff version of a GoPro camera) doesn't perform as well as expected...
"Small tech rotation Fit Bit + 6.2%, GOPRO + 6.1%, AMBA +1.2%, TCEHY + 1.9%. Will see if it holds before the long weekend."
"All it takes for this company to fly is to have a cash positive earnings. With over $1.3B sales, as long as they keep the operating expenses under control they should be able to make $60-70 in profits by mid 2018 if they keep their profitability promises. even without much room for growth a reasonable 25 P/E ratio puts it into a a market cap of $1.75B (or $12.32). Now add in the fact that growth companies are accepted with much higher P/E ratios and we are opening the door of $15-18 range easily.This stock has so much potential. All the management should do is keeping profitability in sight and keep promises and we shall be fine. They do not have to reinvent the world for this stock to go back up."
"It should be obvious to longs that GPRO is trying to find a bottom. Where this is nobody knows. It is all about withstanding the pain until the capitulation event happens. Yes, it is pain. But do you sell now and miss out on the run up? Pain."
why is it going down today? shed some light for me. thank you in advance.
"Looking for an entry for next leg up. Stochastic oscillator and RSI are triggering bullish signal, according to stoxline."
"A significant beat 2/4. Lower OPEX, higher margins, higher revenues and executing a new strategy usually leads to over shooting forecast. $16 soon. If GOPRO becomes a cult stock again, at least double that."
"2.5 hours trading, it's already twice the average volume. Amazing. The good days finally come for GoPro."
"They had a great first product than the company sat complacent for a longtime. Finally they are starting to get their sh...t together. They are a tech company, not a hardware company. They need to be sexy.... increase offerings. They have enough cash and cashflow to keep improving their balance sheet and increasing revenue's and offerings/products.... takes time for a billion dollar company to work it out."
Apple will buy GPRO and Ring this year.
"Just got a black Friday email from Amazon.....clicked on it....first page, Hero 5 front and center."
go broke!
5.50 plus
At this level it is a good candidate for an acquisition which would support the stock. It looks like a lot of bad news are already priced in this stock so not a bad bet for those who can stomach it.
Shorts will not be able to stop this soon...
Come on Apple... you have the cash... buy Gopro and get it over with!
What happened to the add on MODS available 12/15 for HERO 8. Another mister. Anyone know?
"Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference coming Tuesday; GoPro presents at 4:00 PST. Don't know what can be said, but I thought I'd mention it anyway."
Where’s the “squeeze” at?
"I finally pulled the trigger, long on margin with gopro. I did put in my stops, but I'm pretty excited to see what this company is able to do in 2017. big money seems to be betting in favor of a strong turn around this year."
I am buying GPRO AT 9
Anyone else thinks today will be a great buying opportunity?
GPRO was $12 at the end of September and proceeded to fall $4 in less than two months. That is not acceptable risk for an investor I know. GPRO has not had a multi quarter rally since it's IPO 3 years ago. Naz is on fire and this thing barely has a pulse. Tax loss selling still to come.
I have a problem with any company that insists on having their CEO plastered over their external messaging. A great product destroyed by a self serving egotistical dill weed.
"Back in today fully locked and loaded, now I'm just left to decide where to book the holiday some hot so I can wear my new shorts ;P"
http://www.shortvolume.comthis shows how much the stock was shorted today. I request all shorts to short more so we can buy for less price.
no phone or iPhone X is on track to make a GoPro irrelevant. Those phones are fragile af even hikers are scared they might drop their phone while walking. Gopro's stadigy of a camera be an extension of one's phone is a good one.
Who actually has a GoPro?
GoPro is up 6.65% to 5.29
Anybody have contracts out ?
"The GoPro CHINA news is about taking international market share. GOPRO is a HUGE BRAND worldwide. Wait till GOPRO releases KARMA in CHINA, INDIA, and EUROPE. SOON"
"who cares if this thing goes to 8 bucks tomorrow, it just means we buy more because everyone loves g pro and this will be $30 by christmas!!!!"
Took some profit at 10.70. Still majority long and buying back today’s sell on any drop below 10.00. Too tempting to leave cash on the table in this market. Chart GPRO and big runs like this have never held without some retracing. And of course I never underestimate Woodmans ability to F this up. LOL. Maybe a new CEO is on board and that’s the reason for big run up???? Congrats longs! Where is @craig? HaHA
I bought a Toyota Tacoma and it came with a GoPro mount built-in to the inside windshield with tint around it and everything.I've finally gotten around to buying a Session 5 for it. It mounts up well and looks cool too. The voice commands work well. One down side it will only video for about an hour between charges so a continuous loop video is out of the question unless I run a power wire to it. I like being able to push realtime video to my cell phone with it. Overall I'd say the Session 5 is a fantastic product.

With record expected retail sales in retail in general and a product that is selling it should not take long to trend back up.
"Being able to convert their action cameras into web cams could be a great opportunity. I'm not sure why they can't/won't convert, but good webcams are sold out at many places and some backordered till August. I think they should be focusing on using their knowledge and target real product needs (webcams) and not flashlights."

Hey every one I would like to put some numbers so you guys can have some insight to what I think about having another Q4 earnings beat. First of all many people who short GoPro saying Q3 revenue was less than last year I do agree but what’s the reason let’s see. While last year GoPro has Karma drones and GoPro cameras this year Q3 result were little less because they quit selling drones only about 85000 of those are reflected in this Q3 which will make about $8.5 million of revenue . Let’s see what if we did not have sold karma last year . By comparing that I think GoPro has been better this year because they sold more cameras as well as raised more revenue from camera business than last year Q3. Which means the top line business is improving . We will see this happening in Q4 as well and revenue will fall but my question is did this fundamentally mean GoPro is finally going to dust ? I don’t think so because last year they had Karma which contributed to the revenue . So even if revenue falls Q4 this doesn’t mean GoPro is closing it’s business. What I would compare is the units sold for cameras last Q4 with this year and the revenue and earnings generated from that same business. Best of luck to the shorts but this stock is dirt cheap just some people don’t understand how to do analysis .
700 Billion Mrk Cap? lol. Looks like this former unicorn is headed right to the glue factory. That glue will also sit on store shelves until it is heavily discounted
"Anthony raises a valid point. If a takeover or merger were to occur (and that remains a big ""if""), it had better occur before the earnings report. With increased competition, it's hard to believe the company is doing well this quarter."
"GoPro has a cool name, the cameras are a pain to use . I think this stock is going down to a dollar"
The price will recover very soon . I will buy more shares at this point

I bought my son a gopro last year and he doesn't really use it much since he has an Iphone 6s. This is a dying company...
I smell bankruptcy coming real soon
major sell coming this holiday.
Come on Nick just do it! https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-09/kodak-stock-surges-after-announcing-coin-to-join-crypto-craze
Sunday night or Monday we should here about the deal my guess is $10 to $14
"um, a $400 nick Woodman special or a $75 chinese camera that is actually better...tough choice."
The company and the company's product are doing fine. What you're seeing is just market buying and selling. It has nothing to do with GoPro itself.
If its sinking like 17% means it will take long time to recover to $10 again.
"Sold 20 put contracts on this at $9 for what looked like an easy premium, had I known they were reporting I definitely wouldn't have jumped at that 15 minutes before market closed yesterday. It's got pretty good support at this price so the question is dump it at open Monday or sell a call for Friday at the money. The call sounds like the smart move but the market seriously needs a check next week which means GPRO could lose more value. Uptick at 9:30 sell a call, downtick dump the stock."
Why this bitvh keeps going down
"While I would love for this to be true, it smells like a pump and dump to me. What company ""announces"" they're interested? No verifiable sources either? Nope de nope."
"In this earnings most important thing is the forward lookout imho. We already know they will post positive earnings, (though estimation of 2 cents per share might have a surprise on the higher end). Whether it is 2 cents or 6 cents doesn't have immediate impact on the cash position of the company, but if they give forward info on how they will keep this form, it means a lot. 2 cents a share per quarter would put them in a P/E ratio of 124, which is not horrible if they hint on growth, but pretty bad if they signal their sales will go down. 8 cents a share already puts it near S&P P/E average and would be crazy good, but again one quarter doesn't really matter so what matters is the consistency and growth projections.What I will focus on in this earnings is their forecast on the future quarters w.r.t. what they estimate their share in the action cameras and drone pie will be. We already know the market itself started to saturate in U.S. but has a huge growth internationally (similar to smart phones back in 2010). What I want to know is how they fare in big markets like Asia Pacific and Europe."
"GoPro Names Facebook Executive to Board, Boosting Media Heft"
"the earnings for GoPro do not even matter, I'm a long-term holder holding a bag of course. so they finally show a profit in the fourth quarter of 2018 only to be followed by three quarters of losses again? I wish I never bought the stock. #truth"
CAN'T WAIT for this earnings report! Better load and hold. We're hitting $7+ shortly. You heard it here first :D

Image how Woodman would feel when his company goes over 10 and he sold at 6. lol :) Institutional investors love that .Look at WWE ..

"LATEST Short Interest Numbers (as if Feb 15, 2018)...declined but not as much as I thought it would.A lot of big money (retail and institutional?) knows best apparently. This would be a great place to cover I'm thinking, but this makes me feel that more pain is still to come.https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gpro/short-interest"

Hahah when shorts get smashed we are shooting 40-100% in one day...going to be epic when we touch $14!!!!
I’m thinking to open a position and it’s really great price atm but gro was an 4 before covid I’m not sure it will see 12 again maybe $10

"Can we just be serious for a minute, without bashing or pumping? Management has driven this stock into the ground for the past 5 years. If you're willilng to short or day trade GPRO, you can make money if you can buy enough shares for it to be profitable enough, but long term? No. This is NOT a long term play. GPRO will have a very hard time reaching their revised sales numbers. Very hard. Will they have enough product for the holiday season? Who knows but given the HISTORY of this company, do you really want to bet your hard earned money on it? I know I don't. Facts are facts. If you don't like them, I am sorry, but it's your money to lose, and no one can stop people from making bad decisions, even in the face of facts. In America, we have the freedom to make bad choices (as long as they're legal), so if you really cannot face reality, go ahead...invest more in GPRO with the price so low. But don't say you weren't warned, especially if you have no exit strategy, both high and low."
"Great earnings. Q4 revenue increase, profitable and sale is up for black 7 model. The guidance for 2019 is solid and profitable. The only concern I have is moving from CHINA TO MEXICO which will cause operation expense to go up. I will see tomorrow..going to be a great month. My target is 8 soon."

"I see no direct competition, the AI component it's a factor that gpro should consider in the future. If Apple come up with a camera things would get bad..."
"Its funny to read these comments sometimes because everyone's opinion is based on different timelines. Perfect example, $GPRO will be sold, its not a matter of if,its more of when. Nick is young and he has taken the company from a standalone camera product to developing an ecosystem. I won't reiterate what the analysts say, both good and bad, because most of us have read them. But think about the big picture. Go Pro created the ""action camera"" category. Most will associate action cameras with Go Pro's and therefor refer to action cameras as most would associate YELP with reviews. I would say that both Go Pro and YELP serve as similar examples as definitive words defining what you saying without using ""review"" or ""action camera"" for example. Essentially, they are ingrained in our vocabulary. But that is just a point, not a valid reason to invest. But that shows you that Nick created a great product and yes at the hype of sales and everything else, this definitely should have traded where it once was. And based on the mishaps and decrease in sales Q over Q and Y over Y, this should be trading where it is now. But what most need to realize is that the street is divided in half with all the haters wanting to continue to hate, and all the longs saying its time for time this to rally and get back to where it should be, which is in the $20's. $APPL is my number one candidate to buy Go Pro and I would estimate that would fall within the $35 p/Share range. Don't ask me how that number came to light etc. etc. I have been working in finance all my life, I live in Newport Beach, actually have friends that were involved with the IPO and still are friends with the initial circle of friends that started this small company back in the day. Proprietary wise, they have created an ecosystem that will fall in nicely with AAPL. There are some other companies suitable for buying Go Pro, but I don't see them being a stand alone company for 2 more years. I see them launching the new product line 9/26, adding more key new hires from tech companies, I think its possible they return to profitability, and then rumors start to form. But keep in mind, Go Pro was one of the only few IPO's since 2010 (in tech sector) that actually turned a profit. They are extremely valuable on paper and with their recent mishap last year, they did trim the fat and re-organize early enough so that now they are primed for a bright future (assuming all the numbers make sense) and buyers like the new product line of course. But its inevitable that Nick sells this to AAPL. They have this unique relationship and when Tim Cook gave an interview on CNBC, not only were they using the Karma (and not disclosing on TV) Tim gave some free shout outs that was kinda odd. Sure, it can be read as nothing at all, but what if. I think AAPL is impressed with what they have done thus far, and I think that even with sales being down year over year, they just needed to learn things the hard way (stock went from $80 - $8), revamp, create and do things differently so that it can create the HERO 6 and have a following etc. etc. Anyways my two cents. Good luck. I do think 9/26 is a success. I expect more upside than downside, and with the short interest being so high, I am following the option contracts and going with the longs as they will be rewarded if you continue to see what happens, monitor, and I give this stock a price target of $22 come March when all the holiday sales have been factored in. If Go Pro beats the street's views across the board then, I see this breaking into the 30's. Now, YELP does $90M a quarter and they are trading at $38. Sometimes the brand recognition and value beyond what they are doing revenue wise makes more sense as you look at the bigger picture. And a few key industries that will succeed the retail market will be Film, TV, Porn etc. The growth of these action cameras, karmas, etc are essential to the way these reality and media content projects are created. I see Go Pro as the leader, will always be the leader, and one day just like BEATS BY DRE, will be in the APPL portfolio and easily adapted within the ifamily. Again, these are my two cents. Not arguing, makes no sense to do that. Just an investor that sees near-term upside and long-term upside. But I also see the market going down over the next 6 months. So if that happens everything I just said matters, but wont materialize for a while. Good luck to all."
Maybe today is the last day the stock sees it above $7...
Seems to be doing well?

"Travis McCourt from Raymond James issuing a warning of slow sales is a career light weight. He’s just an an gofer analyst and a career nobody. He cannot move forward in his career because he lacks strategic significance. He’s spent much of his career with Raymond James unable to get promoted. It’s the easy path to opine on Gopro negative view-he doesn’t see the strength of Gopro in 2018 because he can’t take a risk and therefore only risk takers get promoted. Sorry Travis, you are no risk taker and therefore rot as as an research analyst and compete with college grads."

it's been a good day today guys. only seen this stock drop in the red once. still don't regret buying this stock
it's going to three dollars if he does not resign
Simply and easy job 7.50 minimum coming soon 
52 week high today
This will go high next week! Hold on!
Read the prepared earnings comments .... just down 6% down is a buying opportunity. They are saying second half will swing to profitability for the whole year... sounds like good news to me - we will have to wait another 3 months to really see the stock price start to move up through $6 or even $7 but for the patient investor I see being able to double your $$$ if you enter here and hold 12-24 months. For an easy doubling of investment I think it is worth the headache of wild swings in pricing given short positions and small float. Thoughts?
"GOPRO needs to announce dividend , then boom."
GPRO's decline in the last month coincided with the launch of the DJI Osmo Action camera.It's cheaper and apparently strong competition for the Hero 7 according to the reviews.
"On GPRO website now...click on investor relations for PDF:I’ll cut straight to it – thanks to consistent momentum throughout the quarter and a strong launch of HERO9 Black coupled with our GoPro subscription service, in Q3 GoPro generated non-GAAP EPS of $0.20, $100 million of operating cash flow, and we expect to be profitable for the full-year 2020. Revenue in the third quarter was $281 million, up 109% sequentially. We ended the quarter with $147 million of cash on hand and expect cash to grow north of $200 million in Q4. At the close of Q3, GoPro had 501,000 subscribers, a 35% increase sequentially, and we expect to exceed 700,000 subscribers by year-end."
This stock should be junked before its earnings on 2/4...set a buy at $2.25

gpro buyout is coming
"Hero 6 is the best selling camera on Amazon, Best Buy and B&H......Fusion will contribute significantly to 4th qrt. Brand new market therefore not up grading a previous Hero camera. Plus the 699 unit cost will drive avg unit price. This is a must that Gopro be ready for demand this holiday season."
"Dear GPRO,why don't you try something innovative like partnering with motorcycle and all-terrain vehicle companies and installing your cameras in their vehicles as a new point-of-sale. you could partner with automakers and install your cameras in their vehicles as a method of monitoring and recording crashes or traffic incidents to protect the driver.I think Camer number X7 or whatever the next number is just ain't cutting it at this point in time."
wonder what Nick is thinking these days???
Craig will never cover! U will be in debt!
and it will drop to 5.5 end of this week
"going to finish strong today, I expect."
the irony its that it held on 2 the nickle
$6-$7++ by next week
Woodman at it again. He pumps up the stock when he needs to sell some and then actual numbers come out that contradict what he says. I own a small holding in this so before you scream short just don’t. I’ve seen this movie before I know how it ends.
"I see Craig is still being the idiot GoPro troll. ""Did you cover yet you short ugly little GoPro troll?"" ..... you should cover Monday ...and do I have a bridge for sale for you , little man. Let me know asap , ok?......thanks buddy.!"
"SARWAR: What's up, buddy? Remember when I told you about CYDY a while back when it was about $.33 in November? It's about $4.50 now and is getting ready to go parabolic. Don't take my word for anything, please, but check it out. CYDY has the drug that will beat COVID. Then people can film themselves on their GPROs again, once they're allowed to be around other people. But CYDY stock is what you should learn about. Fast. Going to be over $10/share in early July."

If Karma is being used or tested at the Surf Championship...THEN we could or will see a KARMA XMAS...IN YOUR FACE CRAIG...if that is the logic...People don't forget that Craig make .001 dollars for each reply.
Just considering Cash flows Gopro should be now worth more than 2 billion as it show us it could generate 100million each quarter in positive FCF. which would still be trading at 5-7 times FCF. while FCF might not be positive for short term investors the company can invest it in longterm growth which gopro has decided to do by rolling out new subscription services. this company can grow at unprecedented levels and is a sure buy even at current prices. any short holder thinking gopro will go down again should rethink. I own a lot of gopro shares and not thinking to sell at these prices.it would be wise for shorts to cover at these levels before they have to catch it higher.
I have a GoPro why is the share price so cheap damn! Buying today love my hero8  Let’s go GoPro!
GoPro will go skyrocket today I have a strong feeling
GPRO was as high as$4.63 less than a month ago...and biz has only gotten better since. Need I say more?
Got notice that my GoPro 8 will arrive tomorrow. Excited to get this thing and excited for a nice climb from here
appl new division in Cupertino Gpro?
Who wants to take the chance of ruining their phone with all the info in it. A GoPro is built extremely rugged for an electronic device and guaranteed with free replacements if it does break. I don't like carrying my phone when I'm going to be adventurous and there's a chance of damaging it. A GoPro is allot cheaper than a phone.
Stop selling people... Never sell on emotional basis.
"bad apples are being shaken out today, fundamentals are stronger than ever"
GoPro and Karma production back on the track according to the latest news. Sounds like supply is catching up with demand. This company will do well with Black Friday and xmas.
"JAY: After your ""good chance this is $9.20-9.25 today"" post of yesterday, yes, you certainly have proven that you are no analyst and that you cannot provide in depth reasoning to back up your assertion...which was dead wrong.

Paper hands selling. Diamond hands will reap the benefits
is ER today ?
"We are not going to be seeing Nick Woodman on Shark Tank any day soon, I would say, unless he is one doing the pitching to the sharks about another scam, that is"
Still no shipping date on Karma even on Gopro Web page. CC call indicated production problem was fixed and they were running at 100%. Then came recall. We are not even sure if the identified the problem. This need to be clarified.
GPRO will be partnering with GOOGL or AMZN. Wait and see
If I was short like 10 % of float on Feb. 26(yahoo finance) & I saw a huge spike in volume & rapidly rising SP my first call after my diaper change would be to my Broker asking to cover ASAP! If this continues we may see true panic & an awesome St. Paddy’s day for longs!!!!
"Just to keep things in reality, for those who want to tout Karma Grip as ""good news"" or some kind of manna from heaven, all HERO4 and most HERO5 users would not only have to spend $299 on this, but an additional $30 for a harness. Andit isn't even that great a product overall. From The Drive: ""While the Karma Grip is an undeniably neat toy, it doesn’t break any new ground, and isn’t a do-all stabilizer wand. It’s bereft of pan and tilt controls, cannot stand by itself, and lacks a tripod mount on the handle. (It does include a slip collar for mating up with other mounts.) Pricing is comparable with existing third-party options.The Karma Grip probably won’t be the winter shopping slam dunk GoPro needs to reverse its fortunes. """
Man I'm still a rookie made the mistake of making two purchases of gpro when I could have saved on commission
We’re going up to fill the gap. The week got shaken out. Q2 guidance low for beat. They learned their lesson not to over promise.

GoPro doing well today. Going much higher
GoPro is getting into the police body cam market. Google it
Craig....wherefore art thou????
"Craig ""the GoPro clown troll analyst"" ; IS IRRELEVANT. Fake poser fraud"
"This board is becoming more interesting -- almost partisan. There are clearly pumpers and dumpers, but very few neutral posts. I have shared that I am long... but this stock has both pros and cons at this point. To comments below, 10.5M shares were traded yesterday -- a good indicator. But today isn't a good indicator as it is falling back a bit. This could be simple profit taking from those who bought in the 8s and 9s with concerns of locking in profits. Also the news yesterday was positive, but contained some speculation as well. I think this is a great camera company. But this whole drone thing might be like the other ventures GPRO has entered into. The drone market is tight, pricing is falling, and they have produced a product that is missing some key features. But GPRO has opportunities in both the personal electronic and commercial markets that can make this a stronger company. To everyone here, I don't see this being a $5 or a $20 stock as many have suggested. I'm in the middle around $12-$13 assuming they provide a solid plan going forward. I too took some off the table this morning looking to get back in at a lower price and cost average down.Good luck all."
Watch it FLY...no SOAR!
ALAIN: Happy Thanksgiving. :)
"I believe GPRO is a great value play, I may reach 20$ in 2018!"
I wonder what ex-Apple designer Danny Coster is working on at GoPro these days...
Anyone knows reason of this volume buying? Nasdaq down gpro up
Something seems to be brewing here... takeover? Merger? Social media play? Potentially new products such asGopro branded Satellite phone?Watches?Home security cameras?Two way radio’s?All of the above?!
Volume looks like it might be average today. Surprised. I would have expected about 1/2 yesterdays volume.
FYI - Xiaomi buyout interest is fueling the spike
You have to love this market. Gopro can't do anything right as far as the market is concerned yet Tesla gets credit for car and now an imaginary SUV they don't even have on the market yet. A 41 billion dollar market cap but no bubble here. It's looking like Karma is another unmitigated Woodman disaster.
@craig where you at? Earning coming!
"Looks like Leka went sailing again in a sea of RED. LOLEOY, PROFITS, ALL THAT MATTERS!!!!!"
"Woodman again on TV 'reminding' potential buyers that GoPRO company if 'For Sale', and then proceeds to go on about wonderful future plans and opportunity .So, I am assuming he is getting desperate and will accept one of the offers that are already on the table, which of course he feels are 'low-ball'.Sale coming soon."
"""Flat revenue and earnings estimates earn GoPro a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). There’s not much to be gained from shorting a stock at $5/share, so GoPro isn’t necessarily a selling opportunity, but it’s also not a good place to allocate capital in a diversified portfolio."" from Zack's bear of the day."
This stock needs to see if it can pass through $6.63. Might be tough. It will need some type of news to do it IMO. An upgrade or raised guidance IMO is the only way it happens.
"I bought the new Mini flashlight and it was shipped received within 2 days free shipped.-amazing light. First, I cleaned the engine compartment in my wife’s Audi and used the magnet on the underside of the hood for light. Next, I used the alligator clip to secure light and changed the ignition switch on my Porsche. I took for a test drive and attached the magnet clip to my Hero 8 and recorded drive through scenic route. Finally, took a walk at night and used the strobe on the mini light for safety. Not bad for 1 day. Must have flash light."
Family that just got back from Disney world said that saw a ton of people with GoPros!
"A reason for buyout: GOPRO needs to turn a profit this quarter and 4th and prove a profitable business model. The case could be made that they are lean and growing with improving margins. They are market makers and leader. A company like Sony, Cannon etc., could make the buy out and integrate, back office functions like HR, finance, administrative, legal etc., into the larger acquiring company. The GOPRO division would then be high double digit profitability and be accretive to bottom line quickly."
https://apple.news/A6slbZdSlQ_K5ylXPhZzxCQGoPro has already partnered with Intel on 360 I believe more will be coming in the future .
June 2 Mike pence said we can double tariffs on China meaning 50%. Sorry Craig but Chinese manufacturer would not be able to sell in USA which represent 40% + action Cam market . GoPro should utilize this opportunity.
"they make cameras. fair value here is $3/share and thats just the goodwill in the name. But hey, you never know. I could actually see Apple taking a flyer on this one. Maybe it gets $8-$9. good luck to you if you're still in it..."
Investors Place had no credibility. Here’s a customer complaint quotation. When Gopro shows some strength this manipulating Investors place sends out a negative communication. The author Doesn’t make any sense. He projects Gopro to grow to $1.9b at 10% operating margin and a potential to sell at $14/share. This makes no sense and this is what stock manipulation looks like. A customer quote below. What a sham.Investors Place - Unavailable Stocks ReviewThey send you an email about DIV stocks for retirement.

"I see (well actually I don't because I blocked his comments) that Craig has been extra busy lately. For anyone wondering how this all shapes up, please look at the 1 year chart. I bought this stock WAAAYYYY too early with my first average at $14.82. But I now sit in the low 11s. Then again, probably not the top concern of anyone here.So the future of GPRO... I think an easy 10+ before earnings and we might see a dip after earnings release on 2/2, I don't see much bad news left. I've read a lot of comments about whether or not Woodman is a good CEO. Well, a ""Good CEO"" doesn't allow 80%+ of his company value to vanish while missing deadlines and over/under estimating product demand. But GPRO has a good product as many here have pointed out. You know that because it is the first name that comes to mind in wearable camera technology. Are you going to mount your phone to your head? Probably not. Your motorcycle helmet? I say no. How about to your body while surfing... yeah, good luck with that. And it seems they are finally making headway into other markets.The chart for the last month almost mirrors what happened the last time we found the 9s. I don't know about this stock finding its way into the 20s without significant growth in sales and product lines -- but I think and easy trip back to mid teens. JMHO.Good luck all -- well except for Craig. Stop trashing our stock you silly person!!!"
Go pro has such an amazing social media campaign it's mind blowing. This company is not just about their product but also about the lifestyle and what people do with it. Community is strong.
Upgrade by citi with a target  of 6.50 up from 5.50 should hit that very soon
"Can someone explain this mystery: Three weeks ago, GPRO pre-announced $340 mil revenues for 4Q. But they missed this number. How is this possible? The quarter was over. Did the CFO fail counting school?"
It's getting scary. All in so far.
"Seems like MF is playing devil's advocate bashing GPRO on one hand but then shedding a twinkle of light on it as if to give justification for looking at the stock differently (now to go up) after they have loaded or are done shorting it. Just a hunch, but look for GPRO to start rising in the next few weeks in anticipation of good sales of HERO 5, anticipation of re-launch for Karma......oh and MF will miraculously starting painting it (GPRO) in a better light............go figure. Long - GPRO."
"I'm not sure if anybody went to the SEC filings but as of Friday February 9th there were two 5% + Acquisitions and GoPro one of them was the Vanguard group looks like they picked up another 212,000 shares to make their total 8.8 million shares which is 8% of the float."
Big things are starting to happen. Stay for the big ride up.

"KS, JBRAD, NEY...remember when I said GPRO could just as easily be down 2%? Well, 10:25am a day later, and it's down 2.4% So? There is still nothing moving it up or down in terms of new facts. So stop screaming how ""It's going to 10! Mark it! Post it! Lick it! Stick it!"" or whatever other inane prognostications you have. Until there's news, it's just bobbing on the waves, being blown about by winds far more powerful than you.

"I still say Woodman has screwed up yet another product launch. This stock could be back to 7.00 but for his big mouth reaffirming sales and revenue only to restate weeks later. The answer...new CEO. Bring in a seasoned CEO with the business acumen to lift stock price to reflect great products. Woodman could stay chairman. Woodman has great vision but needs to channel,that into a different role. Head of marketing?? Maybe bring in new chairman as well? Imagine what another big name from Apple could do here. GoPro has Costner as head of design, adding someone from management would pit this stock on a winning streak. Consistent winning streak!"
The CyDy guy should be congratulated for rejection of its vaccine. The stock is going back to earth . With zero sales you can’t bet like that and he is telling us not to invest in GoPro where there are so many opportunities . The company will become and ecosystem as long with software giant. Just don’t listen to the creepy shorts . Buy buy . Good luck Craig and co .
Beware now.
Prediction for december?
Did GPRO ever fix the drones.They were bricked Jan 1st ifthere wasnt an update?
"Congrats longs? I guess?EPS estimate was .06cents the earnings report says Gaap earning of .02cents, so technically did they miss the earnings ?"
All GoPro needs to do to bolster Karma above the Mavic is to release an attachment for the gimbal that would allow for smart phones and a corresponding app to control both from a tablet. The modular nature of the Karma would allow for this sort of pivoting in the future.
Once this beer bug #$%$ clears up people are gonna get out filming more than ever.

"I only need 300% to break even, yeah!"
GoPro earnings beat top and bottom line..revenue up
Nick goes on offense price will get above $10 and institutional money pours in
"Despite a downgrade from Piper Jeffrey this morning and PT cut to $8, still holding $8.70s and trending higher. All comes down to Karma drone. It's not easy tech to pull off and GoPro has done it. Battery problems are relatively easy to overcome. If they do announce strong progress or better report the battery issues are behind and relaunch at CES next week, I expect a strong rebound."
Past due for an innovation to reach masses and create new revenue stream. It’s going to happen.....
2 more profitable quarters and Gopro can hit $13s easily. Holding Gopro for at least 6-12 months.
GoPro is down 9.54% to 9.77
"Stop everyone to guess and instead say you know what it will happen to the stock. No one knows, this is the simple and difficult truth. This stock especially might go up 500% in one year or go down to - 50%. No one knows and here's most people here show off saying that they do this for a living bla bla blah but in fact it is just guessing. Like red and black at the Casino."

"Weak mike, do you think you're the only dumb SUCKER that sold your shares to them because they said GOPROs in your ""......deep #$%$ blah blah""? Well feel better because many weaklings like you sold yesterday but you're the only weakling dumb enough to believe it and admit it here......wow dumb , weak and poor. Right now you must be #$%$ at yourself for being soooo weak.Craig feels sorry for you shorty butI Don't. Ahahaha what's it like being soooo weak? Huh what's that? Speak up tinyasstroll"
Looks like the stock is headed to $7...
Disappointing report versus expectations - which is all that matters in the market anymore. It looks like the company has finally figured out how to turn a profit though.
Snap will make an offer very soon

A fake downwards and on to next 3 month high :) 95% sure that this will be positive by EOD.
The stock Maker is playing with the price of GoPro with dirty way. Why the price is down today more than 5% and Dow & Nasdaq. Are very up.
maybe SNAP will buy it out?
whats going on with gpro ah..looks like it will touch 20 soon
"Montley Fool...I'm a subscriber, have been for a couple of years. It becoming ridiculous how often they bash Gopro. MF must have a substantial short position....and with the ears of many subscribers they are trying their best to hammer Gopro to move the SP. I get it....Gpro management made some big missteps and in todays world you aren't forgiven. Missteps can be corrected but creativity doesn't just happen or appear. Let's be honest Nick came up with a powerful solution that Sony, Panasonic, Cannon, Nikon and many other Large companies didn't even think about. I think Nick and Gopro has finally been knocked off its pedestal and realizes that changes must occur to be a player for long term. IMHO I think Gopro solution of multiple purpose is more powerful/compelling than a single use drone. Look forward to second generation KARMA and returning to profitability."

I don't even get excited when it goes up like this because you know there will be a random 1.5% drop over a 45 second period between now and close.

"GoPro stock down 5.5% todayShares of consumer technology company GoPro (GPRO) are down 5.5% today. There’s no significant news surrounding the company, but the stock has gained just 3.2% year-to-date. GoPro has lost a whopping 41% since May.Similar to BlackBerry, GoPro has also burnt significant investor wealth over the years. The stock has lost 95% in market cap since October 2014. GoPro has tried to introduce several products across price points to drive revenue growth higher. However, action cameras aren’t like smartphones. They’re a niche product with a high upgrade cycle. GoPro is expected to struggle with revenue growth and profitability going forward. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/07586038-1db4-3500-bc41-fef1ceeb4b9b/blackberry%2C-roku%2C-gopro%2C.html"
GoPro didn’t borrow any money In 2018 meaning it generated its own cash flows to fiber expenses. What ls the take away for 2019. It’s of course a strong buy now since cashflows will be generated to reduce debts and expand. Chill Craig don’t tell me it’s not profitable Hahahaha. Your assessment is flawed because you only take into account profits which is an accounting measure. While I would like to see a business profitable on accounting terms I would also like to see positive cashflows so wait for this to burn shorts really hard hahahah .
"GoPro's next presentation:Dec 5, 2018 02:30 PM GMT39th Nasdaq Investor Conference Hopefully the will share positive news regarding Q4 2018 activity!"

"...not sure why are people expecting ""sky rocketing"" but based on the recent events it should go slowly/steadily up. I can sense some hesitance and wondering if there is a surprise comming to wipe smiles of our faces. Realistically, how bad the ER can get?"

Congrats everyone
Morgan Stanley raised gpro's target price $1.50 per share. 12-16-2020 GO-GO GPRO.
"Even after all of the numbers and projections from GoPro, Woodman may have said everything investors need to know with this quote in the company's press release: ""Our first quarter performance makes it clear that there is significant demand for GoPro, at the right price.""In other words, GoPro has no pricing power. At this point, GoPro's success or failure comes down to being a low-cost producer of action cameras. That's not a great place to be."
I bought 2600 share on 3.98 see what happen I will keep it till next year for long term
I'd give this another day or two before touching it..
will Nick give us a thanksgiving present
what do we have here
"Actually, it's good to find out that 2,500 Karma drones were sold within a couple weeks. That means once they fix the issue and go to full production, +20,000 drones sale is easy target. I was first really disappointed, but at least I find that GoPro is pretty ethical company and willing to work for customer satisfaction. Unfortunately, though, this recall did force me to stay longer with the stock than I anticipated..."
Going to 0 within 30 days. Watch boys and girls.
This could be another AMC or GME??
what does fitbit have to do with gopro?
This co has restructured their old business model to meet todays millennials demands. The recent price surge may mean they may have surprises during the earnings release.
"GoPro products are strong and dependable. It is great that they moved a greater part of their manufacturing out of China earlier this year. If they were to announce contracts with the Military and/or law enforcement, their revenue and stock price could go ballistic!"
Can’t wait to troll Craig after gopro goes up 40 percent up and he is force to cover 
They told us in January they hope to return to profitability in 2nd half of 2018. You knew this was going to be dead in the water until then. You should have sold knowing you had more than enough time to wait 30 days. You could have took the tax loss and jumped right back in at a cheaper price. Not only that you could have made gains else where in the meantime. I'm up 8% YTD. Those that hold gopro not only lose on the stock going down. You also lose on oppurtunity cost.
"GOPRO did it again, NCAA, Follow by NFL, MLB, NHL, ETC, ETC, ETC"
I believe MarketWatch should keep their negative opinions to themselves especially when the topic could easily be wrote positively because either way will influence the market and it's just their opinion !
"The current technical condition for GPRO is strong and the chart pattern suggests that upward momentum should continue. The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. MACD-LT, an intermediate-term trend indicator, is bullish at this time. Chart formation indicates a strong rising trend. Upside momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI indicator is very strong. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days indicating that GPRO is under accumulation, which is a bullish condition. The stock is ytrading above a rising 50-day moving average. This validates the strong technical condition for GPRO. The stock is above its 200-day moving average which is pointed up indicating that the intermediate term trend is bullish. Opinion by second opinion analyst. $7.25 coming soon"
GPRO having a good day today. I wonder if they are selling good for the Fathers Day weekend.
A diversion from the infighting - Referees Will Wear Hats with Built-in GoPros during the Big Ten Championship Game https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/30/referees-will-wear-hats-with-built-in-gopros-during-the-big-ten-championship-game/
"These are the latest short interest numbers. On October 31, SI was at 31.7M. Today it's at 24.5M. A decline of 9.25M or roughly 27%. I see the pros/cons of a lower priced camera so I'm unsure if this will save them. But, short sellers who have dominated and been correct since August 2015, when GPRO traded at a pps of $63.00. They're slowly exiting (not nearly enough IMHO). At this point, I'm trying to decide if a position of a couple thousand shares for a swing trade/pop of a few bucks (hedge if they turn around) makes sense. Would love any intelligent, factual opinions. I started a position of 250 shares at $5.30 I think with the plan to buy the dip if it still made sense. Anyone here with a large short position from a high that hasn't sold yet willing to offer their insight?The stats don't look horrible, it's just whether they turn it around or not. And btw, I'm not a Woodman fan.Cheers."
$8.14 within 17 days... https://youtu.be/UeSjyxPcKSw

"GoPro shares will sink further. They have horrible customer care policies. 30-60 day turnaround on defective NEW cameras, all while billing the new customer for a subscription they cannot use. They are fading and unless they change their relationship with their new customers they will become obsolete."

This jewel is following in SNAP foot steps. Look out $60.00.
"I hear Class Action, based on Woodman selling then releasing news of the Fusion technology won't be released until 2018"
"Big day for the stock. I've been on the sidelines for a while, but decided to dabble in again yesterday morning. Happy with that decision so far..."
"Latest short interest numbers: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gpro/short-interestWith the drop in share price over the last few weeks+, this is not a good sign.This has me thinking that we are likely to test/break $5. From last SI reporting til now, it's been a ride down from roughly $7.83 down to $5.83. WOW, $2. I don't short myself but I like the $2 per share gain.I'm not sure what the magic number is for short sellers to get out but apparently it's lower.Based on analyst opinion (Morgan's latest?) it looks like a rough road ahead UNLESS A GOOD BUYER with proven track record steps up to the plate. The biggest challenge I see in this is Woodman. Seems he'd rather be king with lots of shares rather than see the company be wildly successful. A buyer may want a more seasoned CEO in place."
Where’s Leka? Still cost averaging down drom $90?
CV panic selling likely to soften price. Will add more under $3.50.

"Given that GoPro will be insulated over the long run from China tariffs, I would have expected this stock to be up much more than it is after improved revenue guidance..."
I think people are buying this instead of GLD.
Power to the people! Get the news out!
i buy more 2k today.
"What if GoPro became a media company and produced content!!!back to $90 in 2022. Nick needs to take some risks, buy a freaking network, the dude was worth a billion a couple years ago. Make a bike and make some work out content with POV trail riding or something in Hawaii, VR bike riding"
@craig where you at today? haven't seen you post today
"Feb 2nd 2017 ,!the day GoPro trolls wish they had bought at least 1 share of GoPro w/ real US currency."
"At this valuation (~$500m), I wouldn't be surprised if Google (or another tech company) acquires Gopro for the value in their tech, brand, employees, and patents. The synergy and ease of integration would make this a perfect buy out candidate. A partnership with AirBnB and travel companies to add GoPro rental add-ons for customers on their adventures would send this skyrocketing."
Go Pro is doing a trade up program and subscription program now. Their customer lifetime value must be improving big time and they're turning a profit! This is the mother of all buying opportunities!!! A lot of people have been burnt but this is turnaround time!
"The gopro hero 9 is the buggiest release the company has ever launched. its not worked 100% since release day (i know as i own one and don't use it) a heap of features not working and worse still popping sounds on all clips, now since December the slow motion has verticle lines reported by many making it unuasable for slow motion. This company is an absolute ghost when it comes to after sales support - this titanic has hit the iceberg and is sinking fast. just read the consumer testament here and DYORhttps://community.gopro.com/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/Cameras/label-name/HERO9%20Blackhttps://www.trustpilot.com/review/gopro.com"
Pick up some 2023 riot calls. Won't be long till bitcoin explodes before Christmas or After.
Dont get me wrong this stock is a momentum stock trade only. I would not invest in this right now until they came out with some good news. I have yet to see any good news to stop the bleeding. You would think if the new $199 model was selling like hot cakes they would have at least said so. I dont think they are selling at all. Here we have fathers day coming up this weekend and you hear nothing about sales or any discounts.
"This temporary price drop has nothing to do with GoPro, folks. It has everything to do with the current Korea-U.S. war-games being played."
"If you don't hold a position NOW just read and don't post . What you think , your opinion of GOPRO, means absolutely nothing to shareholders. If you are neither LONG or short; what you think of GOPRO stock is LITERALLYIRRELEVANT."
Bottom line is - GOPRO NEEDS TO SHOW PROFIT ON THE BOTTOM LINE !!!
pump n dump????
10 minutes away from the Lunch Time sellers joining us ....
"An obvious ""buy"". Look for $16+ next week after Karma release"
"Skweeeeeze 'em, Gopro!"
"Making profit for the first time in 4 yrs now...we were in the teens loosing -$100m+ back in 2016. The turnaround is here! Stay long, hold, buy dips...target in the teens, either way your making money."
When it’s coming?
needs to break 7.6
"Quick update before the weekend. As genius mark pointed out, we are having a green day. Low volume. Still consolidating. Looking for the 10 day and 50 day MA to cross. Not much changing regarding indicators and no real news or volume. I am curious to see the change in institutional ownership and shorts for this month. Should be out mid-month.As a side note, it is entertaining here with posters like mark, jbrad and others who are always right - -but I could swear they actually said 12s after earnings. Too bad I missed out on those highs. Sarcasm aside, I do think long term we will see double digits again -- but anything 15+ is going to require something substantial. You can only disappoint so many times. Here is hoping that new management gets things done. Good luck longs."
Putting a GoPro Camera on these massive stock dive would look spectacular ! ! !
I told you 5 dollar foot longs! ENJOY! YUM YUM!
"This was the dumbest investment I've ever made. Should have listened to the signs and to Craig. I was just giving them too much of the benefit of the doubt. I should put this money in Apple, Google, and Facebook. This depressing and a hard lesson learned. I sold last week except 2 somewhat small call options. Lost 50% on GoPro plus opportunity cost of what I actually sold to buy GoPro which makes it even worse."
Honey it's for you. Who is it? Someone named Margin I think.
"As Nick talks, the song, ""I love the way you lie"" plays on repeat mode in the background."
and amzn
gpro will bounce from here. History repeats itself...
LOOKING FOR $6.00 TODAY.
Woodman.....WOW.....captain of one of the most historically bad companies and stocks of all-time
"From article today......Adding subscribers is a positive for GoPro, but investors should wait to see how many of the new subscribers stay on when they have to pay a monthly fee. Getting a subscription for free with a camera is a good deal but doesn't give an idea of true demand. That's why I'm skeptical of today's move and think the pop isn't likely to last."

No News but going up! Weird :(
"Zachs consensus,, no revisions in over a month. Street see's rev's @ 187.2 mill 56.8% increase y/y breakeven on profit,, Hmmmmmmm???? I dont think the street is taking into consideration no debt since mid Jan and higher profit margins cause in house sales. Sure hope they meet or beat that Revenue number....."
still... stock is not up in proportion to volume...
Possible Buybackand/or BUYOUT pending--at premium!
Racked up a big $11 today. Feels great.
This should get up and run to teens
My guess for EPS tomorrow is ($0.25). Another 11 cent beat. Let the games begin!
"OK so I have been checking the SEC filings am=nd not one insider has sold a share into this run. With the holiday season, covid and outdoor activities I say GPRO will run to more new highs. How far and fast I have no Idea but I would say a double may be doable.. Hence I may just double down. Oh yeah and the gap from earnings has been filled. beautiful chart."
$3.50s as expected. It will get a dead cat bounce if/when the market goes green for a change.
i would never short a stock at the 5 level to dangerous
THANKS SATIJA.
watch the 5.75 level we pass that an we will see a close above $6.00
"Question: Should a buyout actually occur, it's estimated to be at around $8 per share. However, with a 31% short float, shouldn't that temporarily drive the price higher when the covering starts?"
"Buying more. September is when Nick to drop the bombs on shorts' head. 18 months to correcting mistakes. Many veterans on board to helping out. Delay new products are gussy move but it will payoff eventually. Longs here will have very very very merry Xmas ! Be patient. We almost there. Shorts will try the hardest but take advantage on any dip to buy more. Gpro is on the surging moves, and yet the bigger guys are looking into swallow GPRO right now. GOOGLE, APPLE, MSFT and RTN"
2 million shares traded after hours.
$12 soon!
Attach a camera to a colonoscopy scope and you'll find the heads of many longs.
The stock might move higher.
down 10% today .......TAKE it DOWN
yes i made $.03 time to sell.
"Gonna sell some fast calls, who is buying these?"
You will never see $11.00 again.
ALL LONGS SHOULD STAY TOGATHER AND PUSH THIS JEWELL TO $20.00. LETS GO LONGS
"Jonathan: down almost 4.5% today as of this post. You're very quiet. Thinking about how maybe you really ARE wrong about GoPro? This is just manipulation, up or down, so imagine how bad it's going to be when no one cares about the next GoPro product that comes to market...if there is one. I doubt you'll ever be man enough to say ""You know, I swung and missed at this one, but hopefully my next investment will make up for it."""
"I never thought I would see this day happen, but I am actually in positive territory on GoPro for basically the first since I bought it. I feel like I should just sell it now and forget that I ever owned it. But it seems like they are making some good moves lately, so at least now I just can put in a dump price and cut my losses if Woodhead decides to revert back to his dumb ideas again.And as I typed this, I just dipped back into negative territory, but it was a nice feeling for 5 minutes or so."
17$ coming soon
Look for heavy BUYING and VOLUME right out of the box today. Both PPS and volume trending sharply UP!
Painful!
This is what I feel today
Hero 7 is still selling well and is evident as I said 1 quarter ago we will have beat on all fronts another beat is coming. Bulls had a good run and we could get to 10$ easily.
APPLE still thinking to buy GOPRO.
8 shipping tomorrow. Not only am I excited to get this thing but I'm also excited to see what this thing does for us shareholders
What’s funny is Investor Business Daily wrote a hit piece on GPro this morning then deleted it after the 15% move.
Its clear...sale is the works...NG is never silent when the stock goes down...he's just waiting for earning's call to say ..here you go...
"Top management is buying shares today. total= 275,000 shares. GO GO GPRO."
I just need 6.5 to breakeven and not sure if it will
"Congratulations, Cramer!! First General Electric....now GoPro. You sure know what you're doing, huh."
expenses cut + hero 7 sales = win
Going to $16+ tomorrow after market tomorrow/after earnings announcement - going to try to sell my 3800 shares post market pop.. Hopefully $16+ or more. Godspeed friends.
"Wow, what strength in a down market? Never mind this pos lost 90% its value. At least it seems to have found a bottom? Or did the shorts move out to somewhere else for the interim (so will return in a day or two)? Or is it just waiting to move either up or down soon?May be worth buying $6 calls and $5.5 puts. This stability for Gopro looks unreal."
Why the huge after hour drop?
"Seriously, when company said its started making money, wall street won't react, if tsla says I burnt 500 million this qtr, wall street jump to the roof and stock will go up by 20%. Pathetic"
Guys know why is hero 6 no longer selling on their website?
In. I figure if this is on the mend and it is turned around no reason why we shouldn't hit $7+ by end of summer.
"The current PPS reflects the now old and well-known news that the previous quarter results will be a disappointment. After the earnings report, barring any further negative news, it'll be time to look to the future - not the past - a future without the financial lag of the Karma."
$10.00 is just around the corner and around that corner is $20.00. GO GO GPRO.
"It looks like the GoPro (GPRO) fad may be coming to an end. Over the last 5 years, these shares have plummeted over 94%, and any sign of a comeback seems to be dwindling, with its most recent earning report illustrating a 54% year-over-year decline in sales. Sell-side analysts are increasingly pessimistic about this dying brand pushing this stock into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)."
"Woodman is cruising around the world on his 180 foot $40 million yacht, instead of running the company, but was still paid almost $1million in compensation?"
"lawsuits may come, wow."
Can I hear 10% down today? 2 more hours of trading to make it happen! Where is Alain with his completely accurate predictions?
"Buy Now, Sell Later "
"Buy the dip, so we can go to Cip"
Does anybody have a picture of Crabby-Paddy that they can post on the side of a milk carton? He is missing ever since his doom & glom prognostications miserably failed him. I hear lwber is in therapy now with his shrink!! LOL!! Go GPRO!!! Up we go!!!
last year gopro mentioned they were moving production away from China on tariff concerns. are there any articles out there that state how much gopro is still dependent on China?
People still trade this?
told u guys to just wait..
"Hopefully, this stock is not making its way down to 6.00"
I think the goal for GoPro this year is to get 1million subscribers for $5 that is 5 million a month and $60 million a year I think that alone will get us to $9.00 next goal will be 5 million subscribers which will be $300 million a year and 3 to 4 years we could see 10 million subscribers which will be $600 million a year this stock as the potential to go to $50 a share when that happens.
Shoulda loaded up on gopro on xmas eve. Double +
Looking real good!
Oooh when the Feds come walking... that’s just what they will do...

Seems I should take my own advice. Looks like mid 9s before ER tomorrow AH. Volume still seems light to me. Might hop in for a quick pop depending on how Thursday AH goes. Good luck to those holding.
There is definitely something else going on - I posted this few days back as well. Only Insiders would know this. They must have diversified their business model or may be coming up with some Medical device manufacturing - Watch out for some great news !

Happy market manipulation dayhttps://marketexclusive.com/analyst-activity-citigroup-reiterates-hold-on-gopro-nasdaqgpro/2018/03/
Hey all you longs this thing is building a nice base here in the mid-$8 range - bodes well for nice upswing after the new year... but with all kinds of tax harvesting activities I think we gotta wait till the new year to see the resumption of a March towards $10 - for those with dry powder maybe we see sight downside to buy low. Long to $12 !
"The volume is most likely due to the fact that they expect to release Hero 8 on October 1. Per their social media posts from last night. Reviews, from those that had access, must be good."
maximum 8 per share will be sale price
"so I tried out my new karma yesterday with my hero 4 silver and I must say, I am very happy so far. it performed better than I expected and I'm excited to fly again having tuned some of the settings more to my liking. I'm no drone nut, so my experience is not compared to anything, but it was simple, safe, intuitive and a lot of fun. I think as they update software and add features, the karma is going to be a real success. looking forward to that."
“Apple buys UK startup to improve iPhone picture taking”
This is precisely why I hate this stock.
What a slow painful ride ... and it all began when Woodson decided to buy that 80 Mill yacht .. I should learn to short more stock when my gut tells me to 
I have just read an article describing all the latest events affecting the stock price. Who want to read here it is https://finpedia.co/bin/GoPro/
"What reasons should I buy this stock for, can't figure out what to plant some of my cash in, this is definitely one of my near finalists."
Bought 10k shares in pre market at 9.66....Sold mine at 12...glad I did.
"What do we have to fear ? It can only go up, good advertising for Christmas will light the fire for this stock."
"The company already has successful branding and products and patents on those products. How much research & development and marketing expenses would it take to even take a worthwhile piece of the pie? Face it - at the valuation, it is better to buy Gopro than to build from the ground up. Everyone around the world thinks GOPRO when thinking of action cameras. Gopro has become synonymous with the word camera where people don't even say the word 'camera' now when going on travels/adventures. To consumers, it's the difference between have a pair of Nike (Gopro) shoes or a pair of shoes from Walmart (other brands.) I'm sure technology companies have their eyes on the company for acquisition - I wouldn't be surprised if we start hearing more news about it soon at this valuation."
Wow! Even on lower volume finish in the green! We just might see $14-15 this week!
I like GoPro products but their stock gives me cancer!
"AND ITS TIMEEEEE!!!!!! Let’s buy this! Buy some today, tomorrow and Monday...go long"
Market goes up....this goes down....market goes down...this goes down....not a good pattern....It looks like this thing is done! And as for a bottom put in......looks like it is far from it......just love how they just do the slow methodical take down.....10-20 cents a day as if no one will notice......so good to be a short in this stock and have all the market makers...brokerages and algo's working for you!!!!

while this might be the most hated stock... at the end of the day when the numbers are added up they will show Improvement which is what we have seen the last few quarters. this stock should be at least at $10 right now and I see it going to $15 if Nick Woodman is taken out of the equation and they bring a competent CEO.
"$7.50 close today would not be surprising especially with subscribers going up 40%$10.00 plus by years endGoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) announced Tuesday that its new HERO9 Black camera has pushed the number of GoPro subscribers past 500,000, and the number is expected to exceed 700,000 by the end of the year."

Good Go Pro short interest! This is going to the Moon! Diamond  hands.
"The Karma Stick seems a little expensive, but minimal competition in this realm from 3rd parties. I own a Hero 4 Silver and would be very interested in owning this, given that a lot of my video is shaky and this would all but correct it. However, I think only your more ""extreme"" users will shell out $300.00 to purchase it. I mean, why wouldn't I just spend $400.00 more and get the drone too (when it is re-released). As for the Karma, it is coming back, and my guess it will be in Q1 2017. I don't believe that they are just ""fixing it"". I believe they received a luke warm reaction from the drone community and also saw what the DJI Mavic had. They will come out with a better Karma than before that also has their flight issues fixed. But like many have stated, the Karma wasn't built to save GoPro, its just another accessory / revenue driver. Their biggest money make should always be the cameras themselves. They just need to market the product for everyone, not just sports enthusiasts. I actually just bought my mother a Hero 4 Black over Christmas for $299.99 as it was $150 off and $100 cheaper than the Hero 5. She does outdoors stuff, but also has many grandkids as well. I am hoping she will use it as an every day camera, which is the exact market GoPro should be flocking to and compete with the likes of Canon and Nikon in the point and shoots. They have the name, they have the cache, now they need a better line of products that just don't build off owning a Hero 4 or 5. Of course they can also expand software wise with their Cloud, but they need to make it better and also free. Provide all owners with limited free Cloud space that can only maintain a certain quality and then offer upgrades that increases both space and quality. You first need to lure people to your service instead of starting it out at $4.99, especially when there are other free options out there. And when we think about competitors in the space, 3 come to mind. But quick, can you name them other than brand? No, most people cannot. When they think of ""action cam"" GoPro comes to mind first, not Nikon KeyMission, Sony Action Camera, or Garmin VIRB. Looking at Amazon review wise, The GoPro Hero 5 has a 4.1 rating on 125 reviews, the Nikon Keymission 360 has 1.9 rating on 108 reviews, the Sony FDRX3000 has a 4.8 rating on 9 reviews and the Garmin has a 4.1 rating on 48 reviews. So comparing the Hero5 against the competitors, it has one of the highest ratings and the most reviews. Looking at Best Buy, the Hero5 has 545 reviews, the Nikon has 21, the Sony with 59 and they do not carry the Garmin. Review scores are pretty similar to Amazon. In conclusion, they have a great product (camera) and they have loads of cool and profitable accessories. Their first intro to the drone market was a doozy, but I expect them to come out with a better version in the next few months. I also believe most respective buyers were already owners of GoPros and so I see those sales coming at a later date vs to a competitor. What they need to do is execute better, have a broader camera line and a revamped online platform that can generate cash. Right now, they have poor execution. So if you believe they can turn it around, I believe they have the product and market to be successful. But if you don't believe in their leadership, then I would not buy into their Stock. I personally believe that leadership will eventually execute properly or be bought out before they go obsolete. I mean if you look product wise, Nikon dipped their toes into the Action Cam market and failed miserably. This is just a random though out of left field, but Nikon could acquire GoPro and have their sports action cam market fulfilled instead of pumping money into R&D and failing to compete."
Best case scenario. A bigger company with no prospects and a lot of money comes along and buys this dying company.
"Seems this board is becoming more of a circus and less of a place to share real information. Between the $5 dumpers and the $20 pumpers...Short and sweet today. Stock is consolidating, which is a good sign. Normal volumes... no major buyers or sellers, which is to be expected. Anticipating some movement next week prior to Thursday based on anticipation unless there are changes in analyst ratings or other news releases prior. Technically speaking, we are actually overbought, but seem to be holding strong. Personally looking for low 11s, but wouldn't be surprised to see 12s Friday (next Friday). I think projections were drastically cut so GoPro would beat estimates combined with strong sales. Also, Karma sales and write-downs may already be factored into estimates provided on the last call. Guidance will be very important going forward. Side note -- there was a good article on valuation about GoPro being at 1x gross sales. Seems low, guidance will help dictate direction and multipliers. Maybe Trump will line ""the wall"" with GoPro cameras.Good luck all."
Double volume up 10%? When is the buyout?
Just realized that GoPro has a 31 percent short interest. Any positive news will send this stock flying. Think I’ll buy some call options. Look at what happened to snap today.
How can they announce a new camera one day and say it's delayed the next day? The lawyers will be all over this.
GoPro bear trolls getting SCHOOLED.
"Leak-A. Explain one reason to purchase this stock that doesn't reside on a hope or a dream. Also explain how if the stock is green one day even a fraction of a percent it is very exciting news (even though you are down > 20%), yet if it is red it doesn't matter because you have a long term ""investment strategy"" with GPRO."
I like the stock. YOLO!
"As lousy as GPRO has been as a stock, the consumers are very well aware of the product and the brand associated with the camera. I just finished 2+ weeks traveling with the GoPro mounted on my caps. Almost everywhere I went, people recognized the brand and liked the fact of the camera being mounted onto the cap."
in @ 7.80 12k out @ 13.25
What a volume!! Finally something is cooking?
"The problem for Gopro is twofold. They don't have a long term business plan and their CEO has a huge creditability problem. Karma release aside this company is a very high risk investment. No one ever gives shorts their due. They do their homework and they have been spot on regarding Gopro. No bounce, no buying interest with CES a week away tells me this stock is going lower. Great camera, lousy management and an even worse investment. Why not pursue the commercial side with the voice activated Hero5 session. Woodman needs to let investors know his long term plan. Perhaps he doesn't have one and there in lies the problem with the company."
Higher HIGHS...lower lows--onsolid volume.

"Good news! A shyster lawyer has filed a class action suit against GPRO and seeks recovery of millions of $$$ for shareholders. I knew it would not be long before the lawyers would jump in to fight for the retail investors who were duped by GPRO. It won't be long before innocent investors can claw back some of their losses. How much can you recover? Well, the lawsuit only covers those who bought last month so for the vast majority you will get zilch. But this is better than nothing!"

All a great setup for your high-flying momentum stocks, including our beloved GPRO!

How will GPRO do today when should I sell. I bought 1100 at 16.65
"Nicholas, i know u trying hard and presented at MS , nothing will help to change my mind , start buying or convert your prefer stock otherwise as promised u will never see $6 , so far market believe me better start too"
what about this lawsuit against them recently?
Taking new position here
"I knew that was just a hype spike, my puts are happy"
up 5%
beat
"This stock will come back , I just bought shares today , they have a product to sell , they will have new management and how bout them being bought out by Google , Amazon or Apple , that really looks like the more likely scenario"
That lasted long!
"GPRO is the strongest stock around. Sure, they've lost money for the past 4 years and plummeted from $90/share down to about $6/share and have shuttered their entertainment and drone divisions, both of which were said to be what was going to bring them back to profitability, and sure, they fired over half of their staff which made is APPEAR they were more profitable for a quarter or two, and don't worry about the fact that there is more competition than ever, smaller margins, and that they have only 1 actual product. GPRO is going to soar! Why? Because of the power of prayer! Come on, guys, who's with me? Sing it...Whaaaaat a friend we have in Woooooodman....."
"Cramer saying GOPRO looks ""to have life"" based on GOPRO about to release 2upcoming cameras and he's saying those new cameras (Hero6 and Fusion) could propel GoPro back to a 15-18 point range again. but he says don't apply that to Fitbit, ""They are not the same."" UP G"
As per Zack’s revenue helps to push the price to $6
"You’re welcomesincerely, FIT"
I think sooner or later shorts will realize that by the end they are going to loose a lot on GPRO. Only arrogant poses cant see this stock us under heavy accumulation and any time soon will skyrocket
"Hero 6 Black back at the number 1 best selling spot on Amazon... clearly it's a fluid situation, but it sure is showing selling strength."
it seems the dji action is at best par for the course.. no reason to switch from hero ...any thoughts?
"Over the last 12 months, GPRO’s free cash flow per share is a negative -9.41%At the same time, Nick Woodman gave himself a raise. Did he thank any of you share holders? You are paying for this.... Not to mention, cutting jobs..Sure he ""slashed his pay to $1"" That does not account for all the extra shares hes taking in or bonuses."
"holding up good, for today"
$60?........You need to average down.....what are you waiting for?
"Woa, Nellie. 50DMANOW within easy reach!"
Love this stock at $4 buying then
"$12 soon! Absolutely not even the slightest bit worried about a year where people couldn’t even leave their homes, hence the revs miss. The company is way undervalued and we will see $12 in no time. I assume we will hear some rumors of buyout eventually too."
Plus they lost less money so they definitely improve from last year! They now have 247 million in the bank so that means it could be a good long
Down this POS goes
"Is there a reason to buy cheap knock off or GoPro ?Why should I spend money on knock off that will shoot worse then my IPhone or Android camera ? why spend extra ? nope I won't, but I need a good video camera to shoot my sport activity or other activities.I can buy a SLR for 1000$ my Image will be amazing, but 1000$ ? I prefer to buy cheaper Good quality camera, what is there ?? mmm ... nada, only GoPro, it is not loosing ground, the big SLR cameras are loosing ground to GoPro.I don't see something out there from Chinese manufactures that can give a descent fight. Anyway the people that buy Chinese stuff won't spend more then 100$ on camera, they don't care about quality cause they can't afford one, so they will say that is the same as GoPro, talk is cheap! show some proof, in the end those knock-offs are worse them IPhone 6s cam.They will use the cheap ones as driving recording device not as Quality activity camera and shoot with iphone or android daily video. So the main competition is from IPhone and Android and not from knock-offs. Can those compete with GoPro ? Not yet !GoPro Have at Least 3-4 years till those ones will catch up."
Its Friday! TGIF! TGIF! TGIF! Will GPRO continue its momentum and hit $5+ today? Hmm...
"Fusion. What is the market for this? Is the demand really there? I started a tiny position in low $5s with the plan to buy into $4s but haven't. In the event there's no buyout, just trying to figure out if the new lineup, pricing, and fusion has a chance. My thoughts are that they'll run out of money before they can properly execute. But, seems like there's enough interest down here in the $4s that it seems like a bottom. Something about the numbers won't let me pull the trigger to take a real position for the recovery, buyout, or strategic partner. Woodman has really made some serious blunders over the years and I fear he'll never step aside for someone else to lead. Any fair thoughts are welcome."
Bounced !
The deal is happening !!!
Hey Craig - Why so angry this morning? It's almost the weekend
Volume at near standstill...We are about to explode to the UPSIDE... News! Earnings/Profit!
I think 2017 will be gr8 year for GoPro!
lol
added 300 more at 10.65. Fly GoPro.. touch the sky
"Its ok Leka. GPRO will keep selling Hero5 and 6 cameras for no profit but keep building up their cash. Maybe in 3 more years they will have $600M in the bank so you can make up for your losses! Enjoy holding GPRO for 3+ years just to break even. LOLBuying all I can at $9+ - LekaBuying 23,000 more shares at $7+ - LekaGPRO $35 by March! Mark it! - LekaEOY! Profits! - LekaI averaged down by trying to catch a falling knife! - LekaWhat a clown. LOL"
All this stimulus money is going right to GPRO. The subscription model is very similar to planet fitness model. Keep it cheep so people like me purchase it and forget/choose not to turn it off because someday we might need it. Brilliant I say.
Why is this wearables product company not an acquisition target at this market price?

Of we see the candle stick of the past 6 days it suggest that the stock is still on bullish side IMNO. 
"Broker just called:""Average UP!"" So I did..."
Why is GoPro -8.51%? Any news? Please trolls avoid generic useless answers. Thanks.
"Sadly, the pain with this stock has been unrelenting. No other words come to mind but intense disappointment & frustration."
The problem is any serious buyers would want Nicholas out and he can't let go.
launch of Gopro home/office!...
"GoPro sold out its first batch in 1.5 hours, second batch in under a day, third batch up now. Over reaction to slight lack of supply.... but obviously a silver lining... people WANT the Karma. Long."
"Thank god for today , I'm recovering SOME loss ! Jeeez"
I own 4k shares in this at $8 I will wait and hope for the best.
Markets up tremendously and this is in the red.... cmon
I am so surprised that they have not been bought out. Apple can this company around in no time and make a ton of profit just by branding it under Apple.
It can see $5.00
This is once in a Lifetime
"Up 2%, go go go"
Oh Snap... We are going to be off to the races sooner then I thought.. HOLD on..
There were Hero 5s and Hero 4s in two REIs yesterday in Northern Cal. They're on shelves.
One thing I didn’t notice was change of new flagship introduction which will be in Q4 and that actually is a good strategy . I personally wanted to email GoPro to postpone sale of new flagship to Q4 or may be Q1 2020 because we having great sales for hero line up. That some thing really interesting .
Days to cover now at 16 highest since 2014. Meaning no one is ready to sell and we nearing the short squeeze. They will panic don’t know when but it is coming .
WHAT?!? Dropping on profit taking after a false run-up? Who could have forseen such madness?!?
Bloomberg trade analyst mentioned Gopro as an example of companies moving out of China and why China faces lost trade
really fishy things are happening with this stock as someone is trying to lower it down even though a lot of people are buying it. waiting for a pop
"Just like TWTR, Woodman took his company public right as the company was peaking. I don't blame him for the run up in the stock, that was wall street traders at their worst. He has totally mismanaged expectations and for some reason doesn't feel he owes his shareholders an explanation. Trust us isn't going to work anymore. This isn't a private company. Nine months to built a base and it is sitting right on the 200 day. It better hold."
"When you put all extreme sports in a bundle, you get a ton of GoPro users, all action sports combine might be a larger base than any single sport? Extreme sports don’t have the fans/spectators like a traditional sport, so you got to resort to filming yourself or friends and posting on social media to gain any real accomplishment. I don’t see myself or friends duck-taping our phones to a surfboard or dirt bike. The theory of iPhone taking over this market is pure idiocy. GoPro is long term, maybe not a great stock, but a stable company."
Don't underestimate over captures market size could be hero 2.0
"Down day all around for stocks, however might end Green towards the end, that's when whale size investors like to buy."
only a buy out can save the bulls. Won't see 5 ever again
They can't keep this dog above 3 for long .
"New REVENUE Streams & Possibly NEW Owners>>>--The stock (NASDAQ: GPRO) climbed after CEO Nick Woodman appeared on Bloomberg TV on Tuesday to talk about new revenue streams for the company, which last month said it’s exiting the drone business.Woodman also didn't rule out the possibility of GoPro being acquired, a prospect that surfaced last month amid reports that it had hired investment bank J.P. Morgan to explore a sale."
"I watched Nick on CNBC yesterday, and I think he slipped alittle when asked about the Hero5. I think he almost said it was the best selling camera they have had. That being said, I think they are going to beat their and Wall Streets expectations."
Just sold my 3000 shares. Still made a profit but things aren't looking good for GoPro. Will buy back in at $9. Talked to a bunch of reps at Best Buy and they have no idea when they will be getting the Karma. GoPro hasn't announced whether they are delayed or sold out but at this point i don't think it makes difference. Good Luck to those who are still holding.
Will it hit 7 today?
Luke Lange from InvestorPlace has a 1 star rating and I know him to be a Party animal. The major companies do not want him because his background and success is limited. He’s fooling around as a blogger
"I went to Walmart to see the go pro section it looked ran sacked like someone had stolen only the most expensive and left random stuff behind with mark downs on all the products, the display still plays the video and overall the display and customer reach is better than the cameras aside it they have a good store presentation and overall looks like they sold out and are getting rid of the leftovers"
I need 20 bucks to get back to even..Think we'll see that this year?
Not a good quarter... but the good news is Nick has hired JP Morgan to help exploring a sale of the company.
BUY MORE LEKA!

"if this beats earnings, look out"
think about this for a second. how is google clip going to compete with 360 fusion once its ready for shipping in November. the only ones at risk (slight if any) are gopro sessions but clip doesn't even come close to how good GoPro's resolution and stabilization is. I am sure GoPro will tweak their software to make their cams a bit smarter like Google clip's think. consider this a discount price and load up. Don't let google clip think otherwise

"Was thinking of buying in for the 1st time at these levels for a ""buyout pop"". Any thoughts? Valuation is currently near $1B (seems rich) so I'm not sure how much an Apple or Samsung would buy it for."
added more shares today at $8.50 . Chart looks great and Nick is not selling shares 
"GPRO =Technology, Value, Growth =Money on the floor.... just wait and see"
"Webbush raises GPRO""S price target to $1200 from $8.00 with OUTPEFORM. GO GO GPRO. THANK YOU JESUS"
Had 5K a while back to throw in GPRO or TWTR. Flipped the coin. Chose heads and it was GPRO. Market chose tails. It was tails.
Down 3.5% - not usually what you expect to see after a supposedly good earnings report.
How much would I get back from the class action lawsuit or the lawyers are getting all the money?
time to get out of the market people...
the positions need to hold as of now. this company is full of disapointments but I think this is the last of the shorts. this one is for the BULLS!

"Xiaomi to take a couple of % to aquire GPRO, done deal. Sit tight. Sell above $8."
Down goes Frazier
New HOD...already!!
NEWS IMMINENT!!
Back to double digits!!! Wouldn't be too surprised if it reaches back to $11 bound before the earnings.
The next big step down begins today
Short interest was 38 million shares on Jan 15 an increase from 28 million in December

Remember when this stock traded at upwards of $60 LOL.
Don't worry about Sony rx0. Sony can't touch GPRO in the action  market. With GPRO shutting down their entertainment division their whole focus in on their camera. We should see a significant upgrade on their Hero6 camera.
"Buyout hype pushed this stock up and it is quite possible it drops hard after ER back to $3.50 - $3.75 range. Be prepared, longs."
Will blockchain be a part of our future?
its should sore 25% today however main problem remain having 25% shorts they either will fight for their life today or give up seeing it above $7.25 today
"I checked Amazon, the GPRO Hero 5 has only 3.5 star rating, so does Hero 5 Session. I'm kinda worried."
"Just when you think this company is finally on mend, reality sets in again..."
Any news on the ER?
Gopro Shorts and Bashers.
"LOL, when they going to de-list this POS. I remember when they were saying ""Its a media company"". LOL"
Loving it!
they are in trouble
"Let's start this so-called ""EPIC GOPRO SQUEEZE "" . The oxymoron smart short has LONG covered.Tomorrow interesting to say the least!UP GREEN"
Great day today.
"Watch closely, as the SP becomes more depressed, it will be like a spring being wound tighter, looking to be a better buy with every dime it drops. You won't get in on any action waiting until earnings look great and the Karma is flying high because then it will be too late. I not saying to buy now as this thing may drop another $1 or two. Who knows, but buying opportunities for the patient investor are looking better every day......IMO."
to infinity and beyond
What if... New karma can fly in the rain...
"If the sale goes through, what would be the share price of GPRO? Did I make a mistake? I am already down $1200. I bought this stock today hoping that this company will be acquired. Please shed some light on me."
Up .61 today - woohoo! Down .61 in after-hours trading - woohoo...I guess being even for a day on GoPro is really not all that bad though. Just waiting for it to go to zero at this point.
Is this just up because the market is up? Just wondering where a good entry point would be. Anyone here long on this?
"Yes, Volume is low. Tomorrow will be Shorts day!!!"
Just pre-earnings report manipulation.
"If they are shipping Sep28th, why dont they just issue a PR statement.Why should investors know from third parties?Here's what I see:Manipulation on no release news till wednesday. Ensure calls get sold off... Then 'release news', then have a big jump and ensure calls get some roi.No straight up, sorry MMs will manipulate lack of dates and leaks need to translate to action.(may be management also likes it that way).Disclosure: I am long and think gopro is having a turnaround. Why? In addition to hero6, fusion:1. Drones are the future and Gopro is positioned to take lead with defense given DJI troubles. Drones are not even factored in the current estimate calculations by analysts...2. Leadership in image processing and partnerships with huawei and others will be huge for marginsUnlike Fitbit where there are research hurdles (of erroneous HR from pulsox esp vertical movement: i am an expert there),there arent as many research hurdles for gopro and is doing better than competitors...Eventually these innovators will be bought by one of the tech biggies but in time, not now."
"Muted Leka, life is already better. Only shows you how to lose money and when not to buy a stock. Knows absolutely zero about GoPro or it's business, can't give one catalyst for this to move higher. Endless pumping of BS."
Surprising this Isn’t moving higher on good news. This was 5.00 beginning of November on less than stellar earnings and production delays. Hard to figure sometimes.
So many people in this forum trying to act cool and smart and push directly or indirectly their short agenda especially after this pop.. . Reading all this I think it is probably time to buy...
"Craig posted a message a while ago that said he was taking a break, then deleted it. Now I see why he's taking a break. Not much point in bashing at the moment, huh Craig."
"A 6 month double bottom at 5.86 to 5.83. Should we close lower the than 5.83, then short term minimal drop in price before a major move up or down. Is DJI Action Camera a negative catalyst or Woodman selling more shares. Let’s see what happens; I may buy more shares...."
https://youtu.be/ar7bGNcM9Z8
Lol the Shorties can’t even short more than 2 million today . Where are all the shorts ? I want some more shares please .
1 Gpro share should be worth more than 10 snap shares.
Will be very interesting to see this at the open and what will happen in the next 2 weeks. Sometimes moves can be contrarian. Look at MRNA it got a downgrade and it promptly goes up! Hoping we might see $12 in the next 2 weeks!
Finally GPRO is doing something right. Time to invest a little more today before it gets to high.
9 days of downtrend !
"WHAT?!? The price spike and is now plummeting? Oh wait...it's GPRO and that's what it ALWAYS does, and will eventually find a new 52 week low. I hope y'all took profits when it hit $5 earlier today for about 90 seconds. It's already down to $4.60 and the market has only been open for 15 minutes. Now feel free to ""thumbs down"" facts, you geniuses."
"Craig few questions: Why are more institution in GoPro than the one that sold out?, Why 83 institution decrease their position 8.7 Mil, 116 institution Increased their position 16.0 Mil almost double, Bew position 7.9 Mil, sold position 2.48 Mil almost 400%. Numbers don't lie correct? http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gpro/institutional-holdings"
I think GPRO and FIT should merge.
"BYE BYE gopro - scraps within 2 years at the going rate, a company that is the ABSOLUTE BENCHMARK of how NOT TO do after sales service/support. Products that are 7 months old that still won't operate as advertised. Customers annoyed with no product to replace dead on arrivals. YEP pat on the back a great business to back....NOT . DYOR and read their support forums on their website. I'm selling my Hero 9 for well under cost as i can't put up with a product that only works 50% at best of the time with all accessories and can't even sell it which is an alarm bell"
Mute Craig
Pattern suggestion a correction to 10.50 in short term.

"Chart-wise, in wave 3 up to target of $12.50 in Jan, followed by a drop to $10.50 or so Feb '21, longer term target $17.40 Apr or May '21."
http://bangaloreweekly.com/2018-01-04-citigroup-inc-begins-coverage-on-gopro-inc-gpro/ look at this Feb 2017 report still circulating hahahahha . We know whats up.
"News headlines tonight say ""CNN has received the first waiver from the FAA to fly drones over crowds'"" couple days this headline may affect GOPRO anD KARMA 1 and 2 and Karmas being used by FB LIVE FEED. Drones becoming everyday regulated tools."
I just completely fail to see how these little specialty cameras will ever generate ANY kind of mass market demand.
I started to worry about this stock...
Nice Q. Positioned well for growth and aquisition. But insiders know the deal is done
In classic GoPro fashion it's down. I really need to stop investing in this company. I make money but barely
"OMG... periodically I check back on my notable investment mistakes to see what I might have missed since throwing in the towel. For this stock, I can only be grateful I cut my losses. Only the pumpers remain talking to one another. Visit to this forum by retail investors not paid to pump the stock is decidedly down. Sadly, the stock has managed to shave another 18-20% in the past month. Yet, there are those calling this a winner on the verge of a breakout. Shaking my head while being thankful for the courage to cut my losses and move on."
Why is this not sinking fast?
"my next door neighbor whos 80 years old just bought a hero 5! this stock is going to explode on that news people! unload all you can on this one, its going to $100 by end of this year!"
Where is CRAIG........ HELLOOOOO..... CRAIG......
"GOPRO Q3 $280m revenue @ 37% GM is $103m GM. WITH OPEX @ $95m Q3 = $8m gross profit @ 140m shares outstanding equals $.06 pps.Q4 $400m revenue @ 40% GM is $160m GM. With OPEX @ 105m Q4 = $55m gross profit @ 140m shares outstanding equals $.037 pps. All non GAP. If they follow through into 2019 they could make $.60 per share and with forward PE of 20, this could be a 12 dollar stock"
"Was suckered in with new products last year. Lessons learned, glad I got out at 8 last year. The GoPro 7 is a great camera, but not enough to keep this black hole afloat."
lawsuit city
"I knew that GOPro will hold this 4$ level very tight and it isn’t going down any where from here . The company will most likely make profits and then I believe as GoPro is an action recording company and sharing it on social media . It perfectly makes sense for GoPro to diversify into health gadgets like Fitbit , Garmin and Apple . Fitbit merger would make more sense ."
No more drones - back to becoming a camera-on-a-stick.

Hopefully this dying company gets bought by the likes of Apple or Google. Anyone else hoping?
When will this go green!!
I’m surprised it’s holding 5
This is gopro. Love and Passionhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bt3Qkq6HX0P/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=8bayk6n7sx68
bears cant make it today. congrat bulls.
Why are these notes only available to institutional share holders ? Is this a collusion between GoPro and Institutions so that they can buy more shares ? There are a lot of questions but I believe in terms of dilution it doesn’t mean much for the public who hold shares as they aren’t more than 25% of total float. I think this move will benefit GoPro and I think they took advantage of low interest rates so they are smart and will benefit results furthers . Not much of a negative .
It's just keep going down buy announcement soon
February 4 earnings report.......it should be terrific from what the company says.Recurring subscription income....record sales for the most expensive camera.I wouldn't be surprised if a recommendation was about to come out by someone....or.......a takeover?????
When is the earnings date for 3q?
STRONG news IS IMMINENT...
"added 7000sh at 6.96$$, waiting for 8$++ before this friday!!!"
"REPOST from ""SilverSurfer""--I'm not sure if anybody went to the SEC filings but as of Friday February 9th there were two 5% + Acquisitions and GoPro one of them was the Vanguard group looks like they picked up another 212,000 shares to make their total 8.8 million shares which is 8% of the float."
I should have bought a lot more of this at 9$ per share. It had lost me so much money I was pisd off at it. Held only 20 shares.
shiyt stock
given the market is down 300 pts
ANDY: DONT U MEAN HERO 7
Where are we with the bidders
Gpro will give us a great christmas present. Look for $20.00 or better. GO GO GPRO.
Half cap to sales. Starts to look cheap. Global mark people still buying and like their cameras.
heading to 2.00
Thanks for the 1500% profit.
Loaded @8.16
Love seeing GPRO rise! It's so funny reading everyone's comments! Especially the negative people who only down talk a stock so everyone can sell so they can short the stock or buy in at a lower price haha Vey manipulative!
Gopro please please bring out a MAX 360 8k
"so sooo, what do you think about earning call? beat or tank?"
"I love my Karma drone and I'm bummed that Karma 1.0 is the only drone we'll see from GoPro for the foreseeable future, but I think it was the right move for the company, even if it was shocking and a huge let-down..."
Will be $10.0's within 1 year. Rate = 20% is EXCELLENT investment at this point.
Google international mega leaks on GOPROHERO 8. Amazing upgrades. Stock poised to be be a counter-intuitive market leader today/Thursday. Big gainsare now imminent!
buy buy buy now.... this an opportunity.....
Great GPRO newspremarket/at the bell
10 end of year if holiday sales are flawless
"hoping for a green day, people will start realise that it is undervalued, real price should be approx 12-13$ ps. lets wait and see for Jan 9"
Is anyone long on gopro ?
Overselling isn’t a bad thing
someone is trying to drive this down to scoop cheaper shares? 
Bought more gopro
"This company is done for! It has no great IP and with declining sales it is a matter of how soon, not IF when it winds up ..."
Guys check out my CraigPro Analytics.Ask me and I will accurately tell you how much individual stocks will go up and which stocks will go down and exactly how much. I’m Craig and I know everything.
"Im liking the risk-reward here. Yes, it can go lower, but 0.7B company? They won't bankrupt, they will either improve over time (long long time) or get bought. Could be a ten-bagger :)"
"So wow! Opens even, down to $8.20s. Now back to $8.50s. Purchased 2 lots at 8.60 and 8.40 with my sell already in place at 8.75. Sitting on 8k shares and looking to be out today. Might move my sell order down if it doesn't look like it will hit, but it appears to be stair stepping upward. The call might give it that push it needs. Volume lower than expected so far. Good luck to those actually holding. And JAX -- really buddy? How about you stop pretending."
Any new product launches in the coming months?
It's down because nobody expects anything new or innovative to come out of this company ever again. GoPro is a ghost ship sailing off to nowhere. The talent is gone and there is virtually no IP in the company. The only thing left here is a brand.
Too bad. The right CEO would have had this stuck in the triple digits. Thanks for partying more than directing Nick.
don’t say I didn’t tell ya so
Take a picture with a GoPro camera of your short position in order to avoid future mistakes
I think the Motley Fool is starting to change its tune as it pertains to GPRO. Read article that suggests investors take a chance on the company in 2021 in hopes of accelerating profitability and therefore share prince in 2022. For the patient long term investor there is a huge payoff in 2022...see article here:https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/02/why-its-time-to-buy-gopro/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article
Up in premarket
the road to $20
8.00 or higher by 12/31/2019
hmm afterhours -5.32% why?
Lucky I sold at 7 
"Wherefore art thou, Craig Classic??"
"Bears here don't understand this quarter was not a bottom play. The growth numbers for their new products and subscriptions are PHENOMENAL! Profitability is coming in later. The company is turning around!*There is 23%+ short interest.*There is ONLY 60% institutional ownership.*The company is becoming profitable. *The company is GROWING. *Consumer reviews are the best ever and consumer demand is strong! * The new initial product sales eclipsed previous product offerings!*The company subscription program is growing 66%+ YoY (less seasonal revenue effect and growth)* The low current market cap makes it a buyout candidate; there is strong value in Gopro's tech, employees, brand, and data which can easily integrate and find synergy at another company.Get in for the short squeeze and before the big boy institutions start scooping up shares, because Gopro is proving itself a turnaround company!"
Their move to Mexico manufacturing now makes them a better risk-adjusted bet relative to almost every other CPG company. They avoid China tariffs AND direct supply chain disruptions (until CV hits Mexico...).
I knew it. Time to eat crow soup and bear jerky trolls. Should have bought long or covered already . What are you waiting ?! Good news?!Well you got it .Negative words will be eaten and spit out only to be re-eaten by trolls claiming GOPRO stagnation. Just the opposite.BEAR TRAP
I too am receivingSTRONG BUY alerts.Reversal imminent...
told you it's gonna pop
look at Gopro cash and debt this company won't go bankruptcy any time soon Google will buy it.
"Hero 6 back to normal price on Amazon.497. Thank God, looks like they were just trying to pump up those numbers for the end of q4.Happy new year and lets see $15!"
The new Gopro series is awsome!
"New Karma video just released, 1st glimpse of the aircraft (albeit brief)... exciting!!!"
GoPro will go really high tomorrow
You are not smart at all if you think GoPro will go out of business. Sure they have hiccups but they make the number one action camera it will go back up
The fact that GPRO hasn't announced Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales news should give you a hint sales are not going as planned...just saying
Good Morning Craig - Hope you slept well
"Covid didnt start till end of the qtr beginning of the 2nd qtr. Its going to be hard to compare Y/Y. I think they will crush whatever estimates are put out there. Big box retail is beginning to reopen, adding to the subscription based in house web sales. We are going to have a good year. Should exceed 2019 numbers with much bigger profit margins."
and it continues to sink lol leave the ship!
"Do I hear knees knocking, Craig????"
￼#1 RankBull of the DayGoPro (GPRO)GoPro has had upwardly revised EPS estimates and is up over 66% for the year.This is ok Zacks website today as Bull of the day. Annual shareholder meeting June 5th should news about product refresh
the goddess of luck is with me today
"Added at 7.42. GPRO has weathered the last few market sell,offs much better than expected by most. Higher highs followed by higher lows is a bullish sign. Back to 9.00-10.00 on the next market run up."
"Rising with good volume. The RSI is rising with the MACD also moving higher. Bullish crossover in KDJ, according to stoxline."
buyout rumour?
FLASHING GREEN/BUY
Near term this seems like an easy short to the low 4s. I think that’s the bottom of this range for now.
No big discounts on gopro this black friday. Is it a good sign or bad sign ?
"To each his own. Clearly some people like being punched in the face repeatedly. Live and let live, I suppose. The SP says it all."
I wonder how crabby-patty and lwber feel now? Their negativity towards GoPro has hit them right in the face (HARD) and the should be so embarrassed. LOL!!!
https://www.thecerbatgem.com/2017/04/29/gopro-inc-gpro-stock-rating-reaffirmed-by-stifel-nicolaus.html
Gopro will trade above $7 in the first hour of trading watch and learn have a great day
"A little market manipulation and u guys mistake it for the coming of the messiah. Get ready for profit taking and another dive within the week. No new camera, no buyout, just the usual pps manipulation."
"DJI, once again, has thrown a wrench into Gopro.. their osmo pocket is a game changer.. shows that DJI will continue to take business from gopro"
"On the conference call Mr. Woodman and co were very defensive and to me their reasoning for future guidance is good. The numbers are very modest in my opinion and GoPro is surely beating the guidance numbers in q3 and q4 easily if their new products are okay. If the new products are awesome, the stock is hitting 10+ end of year. Good going GoPro!!"
"GME is seeing another wave of a short squeeze. Maybe GPRO will join in on the fun this time with a bigger +100% move instead of just slightly. The future quarters projected sales growth of 56% this quarter, 98% next quarter, is not too shabby. I sold right after earnings because I was hoping for a exceptionally strong quarter that came out OK. My sale was only because last quarter revenues were substantially down YoY and it was a short term move protecting a gain thinking GoPro shorts would win until things settled. Now with great YoY revenue gains the company wont need to be as perfect to go up. Things have settled and I think the time to buy is now. Who knows if some sort of short squeeze comes our way in the process."
I never thought I would see the day gopro would be over $6
"GPRO as a company and moreover a stock is done. As for now there is a small chance to make money on this pos only on short side and almost no hope on long one. Never mind everything can be reversed, just wait. I do not know where is GPRO bottom, may be in 1-2 bucks but it is gonna be a nice profit if the company survives."
SHORTS TAKE NOTE:About to soar...indicators turning GREEN...Expect more new HOD in rapid fire!
"Remember the IPO and the run to $90, a dream now... Also watching EGLT which turned technically Bullish on Friday..."
Is Nick on his yacht today or getting his teeth whittened?
Worst stock buy ever made not even worth selling
It’ll hit $10 end of this year.
"Craig and JasonK. Big dog and little dog. Barking at yapping at the mailman thinking they have an effect on whether or not he'll go away. And when he does, oh they trot around the house feeling very proud, waiting for master to come out and pat them on the head. Good dog. Problem is, sometimes it's not the mailman, it's a guest....""Shut Up you stupid dogs!"" the master yells and apologetically says to the guest, ""I'm so sorry, let me put them outside."" And outside the dogs go, but they just keep sneaking back in."
Going back to $10 next week
Apple please come and buy gopro
Under $10. DAMN YOU CRAIG!!! DAMN YOU TROLL!!! WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS RIGHT!!!
hopefully Nick's wife tells him to sell please and move on a new chapter of his life!
"Fiu, that was interesting. Let’s see tomorrow at CitiGroup"
where is troll craig?
Expecting significantpullback/consolidationTuesday a.m.-- beforeroaring to new highs.
"Look at the market Intc generated 35 billion in cash flows and yet trading at 10 times PE? What’s wrong with the market while GMe can trade at 1000 of multiples . I mean the market really is F up but staying on course will make you rich . I keep buying Intel despite all the rumors and business loss. On result Intel been beating amd and every one and infact they just doubled down on GPUs and mobile eye chips , Altira is another play for them in AI and Habana in cloud revenue stream . Cho cho but GoPro and Intel are trading really cheap . Keep buying these shares ."
Oh wow.
"Now everyone be nice to Craig. 'Tis the season to be jolly, and Craig is making us very jolly. Besides - Craig's my friend. Craig's YOUR friend. He must be our friend because he's here 24/7, making sure we sell our GoPro holdings, or not purchase them in the first place. He's only thinking of us."
i think the coming news will say Gpro in talks with?
Good possibility this will close around 9.20/9.25 today
Puts are printing!!!!
"Hahaha the short squeeze is going to be insane!!! $12 will be the new floor, we will top out above $16 in the next week at this rate."
Karma is almost here. Gopro website still has available Oct 23....should be a nice ride (no pun intended). Best buy reviews look very favorable on Gopro 5 and Session. I plan to visit a local Best Buy next week to see the Karma and inquire about sales activity/interest. IMHO we could see 20+ by year end.
Big position unloaded this morning almost at open. Either someone knows something about earnings and subscriptions or bug boys are taking their positions before a solid run up . we will find out soon
"Hi guysPlease help on below : If Gopro is bought at $ 14.00 per share by another company, What happens to the call options with strike above $ 14.00 ?"
"GPRO shorts must cover today and tomorrow, ahead of earnings. This is a safe play ahead of the election, as the next president will not directly affect GPRO"
"I bought 7500 shares @ 16.82 last week and now i'm down almost 20 grand! My wife is about to leave me I put in our house fund, nowwe can't get our new home."
COVER COVER and COVER you Shorts..... The Time is NOW
"GoPro @$12 soon ... told y’all at $2.05 buy it all! ALL IN! ...careful though, big dip in January coming for all stocks...buy more Feb/March"
"if this falls to 8.75, I am adding 1000 more. who's with me?"
book value over $8
"I think today there were a number of ""signs"", whether you are long, short, or simply here for entertainment. You would only post news today ahead of earnings in hopes for a pop -- either to push the stock forward in case of an anticipated fall tomorrow or in hopes of a double-pop with what might be relatively weak news tomorrow. I also noticed increased activity in the 9.5 puts as noted by Benghazi. Honestly as much as I'd love to see this stock finally get out of the dirt, it isn't looking good. All that aside, many here have believed the Karma to be part of the solution. Clearly the market isn't seeing it that way. Might be a ""wait and see"" reaction to see how well it sells and if there is a 2nd recall.And btw, jbrad -- we made a one sided bet. I don't see how I get anything here :) Good luck all."
This is a normal and expected pullback into the 50 day moving average. It's just re-testing here and should continue its uptrend soon. No worries for the Longs.... the chart looks good!
shorts are trapped for sure millenials are into gopro bigtime for all their experiences and vacations and post it on social networks
Went to my local Best Buy today. They only had 2 GoPro5 left. Nothing else. NOTHING else.
Who is bull on GOPRO? I AM BULL
I am short this stock for the long haul. Already sitting at a 30 percent return on my short position. I seriously doubt this company will ever return to its IPO price.
Looks like I was a bit premature with my $4.10 purchase :-)
Schwab wanted to borrow my shares I said NO. Shorts bombing GoPro. Don't sell hold. Somethings big and positive buy the dips. Could be an M&A
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/845c8eb6-0aa0-3b99-bee2-1fac28318ad7/gopro-launches-its-first-live.html
"Schwab just offered me $200 a month to borrow my shares of GOPRO to ""facilitate a short sale""."
"Production delays lead to a $30m revenue shift from 19Q4 to some time in the future, essentially a time best known as ""(we're not really sure when)."""
anybody know when the ASM is?
Who is going to buy this company? It keeps on losing money. Google bought Fitbit.
"Countdown to earnings has started!Still have my Oct calls ($13) as well as 12,000 shares in retirement account.... if this coils tightly in the $11-12 range we could have a surge up on good news into the $13-15 range"
6 dollars Nick sir
"Over 50m Gpro shares traded over the last month, huge volume lots of panic selling and hungry buyers, scaremongering by analysts and waves of negative news ..... that usually means that something's up and pro's and market movers want in.I am long now 6k shares at 9.5 bucks, holding strong now for better news and possibly a buyout offer from a big player ?Let's seeChas"
I think I've reached my limit. I'm not adding any more to my GPRO position.
Will comeback strong next week. Its long term hold
This will hit more than $10 tomorrow. In their last earning it went up 1.50 to 10 in one day. Shorts will be toasted tomorrow
See what Nick Woodman has to say about that DJI Chinese knockoff version of his GoPro camera:https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/gopro-ceo-brand-much-bigger-than-current-product-offering
Highest will be 9 today ?
Good news is coming very soon major short squeeze is coming
This company should be a target for another tech company ? FacebooK? Insta?
Sell this stock before seeing $4 this week. It looks like that no improvements thr out this year.
GoPro Launches TradeUp Program for Camera Upgradeshttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/4615d4cb-b7ba-366b-8204-d0d6ca2abe65/gopro-launches-tradeup.html
Going down like the Titanic
"Hey @craig, happy hump day "
"If GoPro can make a successful presence in the ""streaming"" sector - the addition of the FB guru on the board will help-the original content aspect if this could be more significant than many realize. I see GPRO (if they successfully do this) being a very strong growth stock in the next 18-36 mo. They have the best hardware in the market. With this; the users are capturing some of the best original content in the market. A platform to showcase this beyond what they have currently will help monetize their content - FINALLY. good luck."
Why is this falling so hard?
Gopro brand is tarnished. Drone recall followed by abandonment of drone altogether? Why take a chance with a product whose company is going out of business?
"They could always lay off the other half of their staff to post another earnings beat. Wait, might be hard to make a profit with no employees."
"This thing TANKS hard today, all that matters: Lowered guidance big time!"
I'm in @6.11 any thoughts
"GoPro Corporation's stock price-per-share should NOT be at this low level. Something is dreadfully wrong here, and, in my opinion, it's NOT the product. If this had been a major corporation like Apple or Disney, the management team would have been shown the door LONG before their stock price went from $90.00 to $3.70."
YOU AIN'T SEENNOTHING YET...JUST THE REV-UP
There must be something really bad for it be down faster in 5 hours than it went up in the last week. A deal fall apart? Soft demand for the $199 camera?
Bought more shares today. 
offering coming?
"Complete failures in day trades today. Just sold out Alibaba, all in GoPro. Time to go big or go broke."
Good morning .. back to 11 by Friday close ..
"This is the time to buy GoPro, not to sell it."
"% Above LowThe current share price compared to the 52-week low. 28%, and in the past 12 months GPRO has share buyback at 3.9%, we are moving on up, IMO"
why? because everything in the market is overpriced?
"Just bought in at $5.85. Its outlook looks pretty good, so I'm holding long term."
Gopro will most likley beat Subscribers number of 700K and then price will go through the roof. we are looking at750K-800K subscribers this quarter.
"I think yesterday was the annual google product release announcement panic, but I expect the price to recover quickly once that blows over."
We are going to retest high of $13.75 soon!
Also hearing/sensingBUYBACK/BUYOUT!
"GoPro up nearly 3% pre-market. Look for an early morning pop up to low 15's then back down to high 14's. Caveat - if it manages to make it to 15.72 support level, then hold on to yours hats because a short squeeze will then push it back into mid-16s (where it peaked just 2 days ago!)"
"It would be nice if Amazon $AMZN partnered with GoPro $GPRO on drone technology. With a new drone patent pursued and issued, maybe a new drone division will materialize. A strong partner with an included investment could make for a huge 2021. Just a though since GoPro seems to be making themselves relevant again."
All these short squeezes will have repercussions on other stocks as a loss on one short position and equity to short will create calls on other positions that need to be covered to raise capital. $GME $GPRO $AMC $DDD $IRBT $BB $BBBY
"That's right we're BACK , becauseWE NEVER LEFT. Just ignore the idiots-short-GOPRO TROLLS. CRAIG YOU PASSHOLETROLLDUMBFUC"
GoPro is a huge BEARTRAP
Time to add more shares now. I believe hero 7 will not only be the best seller of all time but will be sold for longer time and many customers who used to use Sony will switch to GoPro for live-streaming . A contact with Adobe all good things and turnaround is here already . Just add more share now . You won’t be able to buy at this price later after the report
"GoPro is now in India. Maybe too late for this quarter, but it will definitely boost the sale for 2017. Not sure anything after that though. They really need to aggressive invest into other fields. VR and 360 seem okay. Karma with more features than DJI would help too."
Atleast Nick should speak up today
"Looks like the CEO has no street cred. Don’t worry we are going to deliver next quarter, next Christmas, no wait, next year. Heard that story before as the publicly traded shares are an ATM machine for him. What a scam."
People are taking profits it seems 10% down risk?
Just joined the LONG team @ $5.26. My screener spit out a buy signal with 75% chance to take this on profit by the close tomorrow. GLTA
"Really going to enjoy the show tomorrow. Watch what happens when 30% float is short and gets squeeeezed hard. Doesn't happen often Shorts, sleep well tonight "
NEXT STOP $13.75. GPRO CRASHING! SELL NOW AND SAVE WHAT IS LEFT!
going to 5.00
"I find it disheartening that not one GPRO enployee (including Woodman) make any insider transactions at these lows... nor did GPRO buyback any.So, either they don't believe the hype they're delivering or maybe they're really in talks with someone for a BO or partneship and can't.This leadership and technicals etc., do baffle me."
"The revenue of $377 million for its fourth quarter, a 12.5% surge when compared to its year-ago quarter. The Wall Street guidance projected revenue of $374 million"
What was the news?
$100 EOY remember this
I believe better days are coming.
BUY BUY BUY BUYING OPPORTUNITY!
GPRO is down -11.04% to 6.69
Is this oversold yet?
Gro pro will drop to 6??
"Sale or no sale, I think the anticipation of it alone will send go-pro up today."
Sold another third of holdings at 12.45. Love the company but this stock is a trade. AGAIN! When GPRO turns down...it will drop much faster than it rose. Good luck all!
Craig I bought more shares at 4.56$ today . Just defying what you are warning about . I m sorry my friend I don’t listen to you but I m playing it long.
It's a commodity! Might as well go invest in a company that makes #2 pencils.
"GoPro IS AWESOME...if you need some tax losses. But hey...why bother with facts when investing, right, Leka and ace? From Zacks : ""GoPro estimates its fourth-quarter revenues to come in at about $470 million (+/- 10 million). This figure represents a 13% contraction from last year's tally and a massive 26% decline from 2014’s fourth quarter. And GoPro suffered from major supply-chain issues last year which meaningfully impacted the holiday season, which should also be taken into account in year-over-year comparisons.Projected full-year 2017 results don't look good either, and actually reflect negligible growth when normalized for supply-chain issues and messed-up product launches which supposedly hurt growth. Additionally, a free cash flow shortfall, and continued margin compression are other red flags that cast doubts over GoPro’s growth story.Evidently, weakness in the holiday season of 2017 would likely spill over to the first half of next year as well. And we have yet to talk about the intense competition and soft demand that GoPro faces.As GoPro grappled with production delays and bungled-up product roll outs, it lost significant ground to competitors like Sony Corp. SNE, Garmin Ltd. GRMN and Nikon Corp. NINOY. Amid an onslaught of tough competition and reviewers increasingly recommending cheaper alternatives, we believe GoPro's market share faces a very real threat."""
earnings released
Just got in for 1300 @ 6.61. Might have missed the boat.. Hoping for a .50-$1 increase after earnings.
does gpro issue guidance ie will it later in the talk?
Great price action! My Oct $13 call options are jumping! Only wish we had way better VOLUME on this uptrend. And want to see analyst upgrades!
remember when woodman sold at 90.
Who is going to buy this company? Why would they?
GoPro green Wednesday will hold gains and close above $9.5 If GoPro can hold base of 9+ tutes will begin big block buying . Watch for volume increase above avg for confirmation. GL GOPRO LONGS
Tomorrow gpro will close $6.66.
It has been an interesting learning experience. I'm out! Best of luck to those who still in this one.

"In the money put buyer in GoPro after earnings (TheFlyOnTheWall)BY The Fly— 12:00 PM ET 05/04/2018In the money put buyer in GoPro ( GPRO ) after earnings. The stock up 32c to $5.28 after results released Thursday afternoon and 7.2K Oct 6s trade for $1.36 on ISE. It's an opening buyer for a customer account, according to ISEE data. 15.1K trade total and the put buying seems to reflect concerns that today's uptick won't hold through the next earnings in August. The stock up 6.2% today, but down 30% YTD nonetheless."
"one day soon, gopro will just be a YouTube channel with video clips of Nick eatting shrimp cocktail on his yacht....with 12 million views and 12 million thumbs down."
Shorts getting squeezed hahahah. more than tesla now soon.
"$20.00 Target price, BUY,BUY,BUY,"
"if the launch didn't cause a short squeeze, what will?"
Tomarrow going to be fuuunnnnn!
Momentum to $6 plus.. coming your way :) They finally are getting it right.....
"You going to strap your IPhone to your head, take is surfing or mountain biking ? ? I thought so.... Cameras have zero affect on GoPro.....Your comparing apples and oranges. Think about it"
All time lows coming!!!! Great job Nick!
I know my prediction could be bit extreme but if Karma is truly amazing this stock can go back to $25 easily by the end of the year.
"I would hold at least for 10 bucks. This stock just went through the 200 day moving average, which is a good technical indication for Traders to enter the trade for higher prices. Some important information seems to be forthcoming for this action to happen. You evidently held all the way down, be a bit patient and maybe things will improve. I am a Trader and follow technical changes. GPRO technical indicators have changed...! Huge overhead at the 8 to 10 area, but huge volume entered in august drove it up to the 720 area and now, once again huge volume coming today. Hold...!"
time for new CEO?
"FACTS FOR PUMPERS TO IGNORE: ""At its core, GoPro is a niche action camera company with no moat, a small addressable market, a lack of demand drivers, stagnant revenues, and low margins. Ultimately, that combination means that this company will never produce big profits. In the lack of big profits, GPRO stock doesn’t deserve to fetch a price tag north of $5 today.GoPro has turned into a small revenue company with anemic margins and no profits. Will things turnaround? Unlikely. The fundamentals underlying the action camera market aren’t going to change anytime soon, so unless GoPro finds some way to more deeply monetize its already existing ecosystem of users, the action camera maker will likely remain a low growth, low margin company."""
The problem with the Hero line of cameras is most people just aren’t smart enough to figure it out It’s not just a action camera it’s a video camera but it takes a little effort to get the perfect footage it can produce In this day and age everyone expects stuff to be Alexa After a week with the 6 I can say it’s better then the Sony video camera I paid 2 k for three years ago
"Woodman is Scott McNealy 2.0. If you don't know who he is google him and see how things turned out for his company. GPRO will never make another $499 camera and soon the $399 price point will fail to sell. Prices have nowhere to go but down from here. GPRO peaked with the Hero 4 the year they went public @24. Woodman has laid off almost half his staff, just to turn a profit. My question has always been why Woodman hired them in the first place. This was a great short when it went public, now it's dead money."
THIS JEWEL IS ON A MISSION TO GO TO $10.00 OR BETTER BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. GOOD LUCK TO ALL INVESTORS .THANK YOU JESUS IN ADVANCE.
"Oh well, ... it is barely 10:30 am and the fizzle is well under way (yawn!...)"
Reversal with GREENMomentum...
"This is a real simple story. Revenue of $260M per Q. Market cap of $850M (based on $6.00/share). Global brand with huge equity. #1 maker of action cameras. Unless you as an investor believe revenues are going to death spiral and the company is going bankrupt, this is a buy. And it's a buy for the foreseeable future at these valuations."
new to this board. just bought this morning.should i sell at lost or hold?
The up trend is your Friend. Stay long and strong with this great volume.
She’s still a buy. Gonna keep holding strong
Earnings should be better than past. They announced great Black Friday and Cyber Monday results. CES was a hot with their new products. I’m thinking this could go to 6.
"It amazes me about how much focus there is on the product rather than the performance of the company. I'm not saying not to buy stock in something you believe in. APPL, DIS and others are great examples of this. Yet they can execute. It is also funny to see the number of critics here who don't like the word ""consolidate"" or ""chartists"". To you Mark -- you don't add anything here other than a constant stream of negative babble while pumping the stock with no basis. You like their products. Great. Same for you jbrad. 4 days ago you made a statement about today. Odd... I don't see much going on. I realize if you tell the future enough times, you might eventually get one right, but you're not even close to 50/50 -- so maybe a little less criticism and a little more anything useful. And maybe learn how to string a couple sentences together.For those holding, seems a premature turn to the 9s -- nothing significant has been announced and volumes are flat after the institutional shedding one day last week. Hard to say exactly where we go from here. There should be new headlines regarding the lawsuit in the next few weeks as they pair down all the individual lawsuits into a single case. Charts show slightly oversold long term. Seems like anything 8s presents a buying opportunity.Now for those who will comment (mark, jbrad), I've not been shy about disclosing how much and at what price I own this stock at. But had anyone taken your advice before earnings, they now would be sitting on a stock worth less now than it was trading for at that time. As I've said before, I jumped in WAAAAY too late on this stock in the last rise, so I'm still in the red. Unlike you both, I do make mistakes from time to time. But if the stock goes up, like now, I'm not going to complain. Good luck to those holding. Shorts might want to rethink things as we don't seem to be falling much further if at all."
One year chart showsBULLISH...reverse head and shoulders.Last earning cycle GPRO shot up to 52-week high of $7.64!And the $$$ were notas good as they are about to be.
hoping for end of year tax sell off to around 7 - 7.30....then load up the boat.
Pandemic-->More travel restrictons-->Less travels-->Less action camera purchases-->Less revenue for GoPro-->Even lower price
Finally GoPro is trading higher than 20 and 200 SMA’s which indirectly suggests investor sentiment is increasing. With the new focused strategy I think that the company is going in the right directions and soon will be trading higher than a year low. Just 3.80$ more to go.
Come on gopro your on sale and the sale price is around 1.5B. move up
"Up it goes, there was a hand off of sorts. Should close green"
Risk/Reward looks really good right now
Gopro Private Equity buyout by Bernie Madoff. Bernie considers Nick Woodman a son!
Those 2% down days are starting to add up. The problem GPRO faces is not this year but 2018 and beyond. The deteriorating stock price is sending you a message. There is zero reason to buy here until they report and provide guidence.
Is this BUY??
When will the pain stop? Earnings report.... now this.
So I was having a look at recent patents granted to GoPro in the past 6 months and a common trend I saw was 3D and VR patents but also real-time object tracking and broadcasting. Could it be possible that GPRO is perhaps getting into niche sports broadcasting like mountain biking/surfing etc? Or perhaps the VR cameras + object tracking as Autonomous driving applications.
Volume rising...
"CEO is a clown especially watching that interview on CNBC earlier....he said "" Let's start with what is working"" too funny obviously very little."
Remember Apple being $4.94? Hmmmmm :-)
one of social media company is intersted
It’s going up. What might be the reason?
Let see how long Nick can hold until he resign from the CEO post to make good use of his WEAK leadership
7 is where it will be before earnings because after 9 to 10. Wait for it ... Wait for it .... :)SAles Sales and more Sales.. Killing it right now..
What is thE reason for AH surge? Can’t find any news. Any info is appreciated. Thx.
Will we see Hero 7 coming out? I would really love to see at least one more generation before they go out of their business. Their camera is pretty cool...
"And the nonsense continues. So pertinent information... the lawsuit. An ambulance chaser. Typical nonsense for those who don't own up to their own stock trades. That said, probably not many here would argue the fact that the BOD and Nick aren't doing their jobs. Then again, there are methods to address that issue.Travis -- Go Pro isn't basing that much on the Karma. Its a new product. I've discussed this yesterday. I do agree things are not good right now. But seriously $5? That would be like me saying it will be $25 tomorrow. And depending on the actual issue, hard to say how long any fix would take. They never quantified the actual number of units having the issue.Can the stock go down? Of course. But it seems to be holding strong at these levels. As I said yesterday, I was hoping for $9 to average down, but its not looking like that will happen -- again Nick -- not a challenge. All technicals are suggesting oversold at this point, so we will probably solidify in this range and head up before we head down again. Of course some sustained positive news might actually sustain a rally -- but it will need to be something real and substantial and not Nick flying his Karma around off the deck of his boat.Just my 2 cents. Good luck to everyone (well almost everyone -- how I love the mute function here)."
Great earnings! GLTA Longs!!!
Give us $10.00 today.
Today we breakout over $6.00 close
I think today is the bottom of this sell off for GPRO. Yesterday was high volume sell off. Sub 9.00 is a buy. All in all this puppy is a reliable trade.
"THIS WILL CRASH CRASDHBACK BELOW $4 , BE VERY VERY PATIENT PATIENT DON'T BUYIN YET WAITWAIT AND YOU BE REWARDED WITH A MUCHMUCH LOWER PRICE BELOW $4"
I’m completely out at 12.75. Nice run! In entire position at 7.47. AGAIN! See buyers back below 9.00. AGAIN! Good luck longs.

"What's strange is the media is all over the already known earning...with headings like "" GPRO stock slumps"" after hours...it did not!"

Just bought some calls. Super attractive. Over sold.
Good time to by some GoPro shares? Potential to go up back to 12/14? Anyone?
HUGE upside potential.Gonna pay off in spades. Underway...
https://www.thestreet.com/story/14385076/1/gopro-is-now-oversold-gpro.html
I just bought a Hero 5 Black and started setting it up. Told to install their Capture app on my iPhone to control the camera. I think I'm going to be sick. You need a constant wifi connection to control the camera. Seriously? They don't have wifi on mountains or oceans where people use these things. I've never seen such a deluge of one-star reviews. Glad I don't own any GPRO stock!!!
"So a couple days ago, I posted saying we would have smooth sailing unless cameras started blowing up (like the Samsung) or drones started falling out of the sky. Clearly I should be writing that GPRO will hit 20. I've read the various posts here and it is almost mind numbing.On the one hand, yes, they are recalling 2500 drones. Given that was all that could have been sold, there is little point to saying how many more ""could"" have sold. However given I do sales analysis for a living including metric development, it would seem more would have sold if available. Then again, a good thing they weren't. Used units cannot be resold, so this will end up being a write-down or write-off. And thankfully no one was hurt. Many here fail to realize that this may be covered under insurance -- so the company might not be taking a hit at all, other than sales. Given how quickly GoPro reacted, it all seems a good thing and yes, people will purchase it when this all settles down. I would point you all to the Samsung 7 and various iPhones after multiple issues.What is troubling to me is if they knew about this during earnings. I'd rather one lump sum of bad news rather than the constant pings. We recover, then hit again. What else lies in wait? Also, why did this happen in the first place? Bad QA? And if so, should we expect anything with the GoPro Hero? I would hesitate to say no only because it is a more mature product.If we can stop hearing bad news aside from the jibberish of analysts and shorts here, it would seem there is only up to go from anticipated strong sales and eventually re-releasing the Karma. I'm not sure what more could go wrong at this point -- and please understand Nick... this isn't a challenge. Preserve shareholder value and do your freaking job."
I like this support the stock is creating
Can this pig be bought? Thoughts?
"Wow, please someone buys this company maybe then we get a rally to $10.00"
You can smell the desperation. Someone just took it in the shorts.
Bought 10 call options for a strike of 25 dollars yesteday. Made nice profits so far. :D
"surprised that Google hasn't bought GoPro already. Google is making big push into hardware business. Rightly so because software doesn't reside in thin air and your competitors do not always want to run your software on their hardware (when they do, they usually ask for a huge fee, like the billions that Google is paying Apple to install Google search as default search engine). So far, Google hasn't have a single piece hardware in No.1 position, Pixel phone, Google home, you name it, all in distant No.2 or worse. GoPro is its moment to break the No.2 curse, until the opportunity is gone (thinking of DJI)"
GoPro reached a 52 Week high at 6.60
"Morgan Stanley issued a huge head fake. And the traders gobbled it up like Monica Lewinsky. GPRO saw sales go down. This does not mean forever. Once the new products hit the market, sales will zoom. Everyone should just chill until the new products are announced. Rumor has it Woodman is looking at embedding a camera in a surfboard."
"$6 tomorrow, $5s Friday"
This is a short seller slow burn. They are covering but slowly as the die hards are still holding out. We’ll see.
I know that Feb 1 gopro is going up but if It doesn't I don't see it coming up again till next year
Go pro Go Down
Does anybody know who might be loading up on all that GOPRO stock at those bargain basement prices??
Is it the game stop crowd coming out to play?
"I hope shorts covered today. Based on the short interest that remains, there's a lot left to cover. It could be painful the next couple days (unless you don't think a deal can be struck)."
prices in Amazon are down across the board... Hero 5 $299...
I think FB is considering buying GPRO also to re-spark interest in their media platform via video “storytelling “ media. GOPROS ABOUT TO BE ACQUIRED....PREPARE FOR A MOVE UP
All the week's gains wiped out today because loud mouth tweets. And is definitely algo trading. Volume is very low for such a big down day.
"The following is very nebulous; just some observations for what they're worth: 1) After-hours picked up today to the positive. One trade was more than 10,000 shares up .16 from the close. A sign someone knows something that will move the stock as little as half a buck? 2) I visited a Best Buy here in Los Angeles last night. While there, I took a look at the Karma display. Not like the old days. Adequate display, but not as good as the competition, of which there was plenty. The salesman said sales are picking up, but were not strong as people's trust is never good following a recall. One positive is that the camera can be removed and used without the drone. Customers have commented on that. However, designed to have a wide view, the GoPro lens may not be optimal for shots at altitude. 3) Article after article appears on the Net citing GoPro as an excellent takeover target for companies such as Google, Apple, Snap, etc. Mind you, it's all coming from a journalist's keyboard, but there is a lot of sentimentality in that direction. 4) There are also numerous articles on sites such as Glassdoor that continuously cite the company as a good place to work, but experience frustrations with upper management with the CEO being at the center of their frustrations.Nothing here reveals the future path of GoPro, but between the infighting, I'm hoping someone else can contribute intelligent thoughts. I expect to hear the negative as well and, as long as it's constructive, can weigh both sides."
"A good price for entry is 8.62. If it ever get there. I will buy and set my stop loss at 8.5.If you are looking for a good (hot) tech stock, you should check out AMD. Its price was below GPRO, but today it is above it. Did think that could happen at the beginning of the year."
FYI. Best Buy killing it with GoPro. Checked three stores in San Jose. Each store reporting strong demand and sales.Haters going get smoked! Karma out 15 days and then the real marketing starts.
"(WHY DO I KEEP VISITING HERE?): I am a researcher, I am not famous for wasting my pain and my errors are often more important than my wildest successes! Now that I've gotten that out of the way for any that wondered now or in the past, I revisit this board discussion as a shrine/memorial to infamy. I hope that I never forget the disaster it was for me to own this stock and what elements of my own action magnified the impact of an original error. Fortunately, I have now recovered the absolute amount lost here elsewhere. Nevertheless, to think I could be that much farther ahead causes me to shake my head. While not always an admirer of experts, in this particular case I wish I had listened better and challenged my assumptions more vigorously. I locked myself into an inner chamber that reinforced my own biases... For the fun of it, here is what one such expert is thinking right now about this company. +++++++++++++++++The current technical condition of GPRO is weak. The underlying indicators are negative and a reversal of the existing trend seems unlikely at this time. The stock has underperformed the market when compared to the S&P 500 over the last 50 trading days. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bearish. GPRO's chart formation indicates the stock is in a strong downward trend. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days indicating that GPRO is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading below a falling 50-day moving average which confirms the weak technical condition of GPRO. In addition, GPRO is below its falling 200-day moving average.+++++++++++++++"
technicals are not good :-(

tomorrow's news is going to make this explode!
"If merger happens, what would be the timelines friends?"
When all is said and done Gopro will takes it's rightful place in the history books next to Worldcom and Enron.
I am not surprised by this price drop and no need to worry too much . Be patient.

"Its the end of the year and GPRO is near its 52-week low. What happened to Leka and his ""EOY is all that matters"" spam? He and so many other clueless pumpers said it would be $10+ by now. I guess he won't show face here anymore after being so wrong. I guess Sarwar took his place? LOL"
I know what is going on a lot of Put options being bought and we will buy Call options once it goes down . Plus would add actual stock
Next 2 hours we will see some profit taking
Not allowed on this site to express an opinion about 2 law firms acting with no basis. Most likely they have profited by shorting GPRO and/or free advertising for their firm.

I even see employees are asking to sell this company
"If it goes to $3.00, I'm buying a bunch o shares! I suggest you do the same. . . even if it only goes to 4."
Very clearly a shakedown ahead of positive earnings.

Bashers out in force=VERY BULLISH SIGNAL
Nick gets my vote for worst CEO of the year. What an astounding series of missteps.There is no catalyst to take this stock higher. Tax loss selling still to come.
the solution is to sell to a major electronics manufacturer...like Sony or Samsung
"Random thought... I hate how they compare a GoPro hero to smart phones. Totally different. I'm not going to strap a smart phone to my helmet and take action shots. The Hero is for action sports. Small, awesome quality, durable etc. Problem is that it is a small market saturated with cheaper action cameras. I had a cheap action camera which was decent but the GoPro blew it away. There is still a need for GoPro cameras and I'll continue to buy GoPro cameras as long as they exist."

Given Robert and Andy’s passion for next-level visual effects, we’re really excited for what our future holds with them as a part of our team.”The ultra-creative duo of Robert McIntosh and Andy Russell share backgrounds in film and video games, fostering a unique skill set that intersects the arts and technology and have a passion for enabling creators of all skills to easily make cinematic content that “looks expensive.”In a few short years, ReelSteady has built a passionate following within the FPV drone community with the cinematic features and effects their ReelSteady products enable.We expect their background, skills and passion will help us continue to grow our software efforts and develop more ways across our app ecosystem to help our customers create cinematic visual effects and premium editing features.You may recognize some content that has been powered by their products—like this Longboard Freestyle video and this micro-drone video that went viral a few years back (created by Robert, himself).“Everything we’ve done so far has had no official link to GoPro, and now as part of the team, everything we create will be embedded from within GoPro,” Andy says. “We are excited, especially for our customers, for what is to come—collaboration as part of the GoPro Team to create amazing things that will enhance the GoPro experience for everybody.”So what does this mean for ReelSteady customers? No changes in the immediate future. ReelSteady products will continue to be sold on the ReelSteady website and supported by GoPro customer support. But what all ReelSteady and GoPro customers should be excited about is the magic that Andy and Robert will bring to the work being done across the GoPro App ecosystem to enhance the cinematic output of your content.“Its feels kind of like we pulled the golden ticket and are going to Wonka’s factory to see how the products we’ve used for years are made,” said Robert. “We are huge GoPro fans. We built a company and product to specifically serve GoPro users and are fired up to join the GoPro Family to continue creating solutions from the inside. It is really exciting to be here!”Which means we get the honor of saying: Welcome to the whimsical world of GoPro, where we are “the dreamers of dreams.”Welcome to Team GoPro, ReelSteady! You can learn more about ReelSteady and its integration with the current GoPro HERO line here."
I'm not saying this is cheap at $4. But have you ever seen a stock go from $90 to $4 a 96% on not much changing on the grand scheme of things.The drones weren't really a thing when this was $90 but that was a failure.The GoPro channel ended up being a bust.The product though is what it was back then. Did people think people were going to be buying gopros like phones? Upgrading every 2yrs?
"Interesting about Craig. Never has an original thought, just criticizes those of everyone else. In polite terms, I'd consider him a jerk, although I'm sure you all have other words. Congrats to those who purchased low and profited today and to the shorts, I hope your investments were not too deep."
Gpro IS ROCKING & ROLLING GO GO GPRO.
GoPro was granted a patent titled 'Motor Control Optimizers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles'I think GoPro is getting relevant again
Make a camera that shoots 8k video already.
"Once upon a time, GPRO reached $98.If GPRO back to Elliott Wave up-trend, It could possibly be:(1) ($98 - $8) * 1.618 = $145(2) ($98 - $8) * 1.382 = $124(3) ($98 - $8) * 0.618 = $55(4) ($98 - $8) * 0.382 = $34"
I dont like 6.66 i would like see 9.99
"We will soon see how transparent Woodman really may be. The potential shutdown of the drone business after Woodman promised Karma early 2018. Of course, he said they were not pushing a Karma because of low margins or they knew they were exiting the drone business. The sales volumes near $80m with OPEX NEAR $60m and is a big drag on margins and profit. If they exit, margins and profitability rise. Gopro can easily turn a $1 share profit and at &16 x earnings should be a $16 price. With a buyout about $20 share. That’s reasonable"
The hedgefunds and analyst have demolished GoPro since 2015. We need to make this stock the next GME!
"GET OUT NOW WHILE YOU STILL CAN., THIS STOCK IS GOING TO $11.50. NEXT STOP IS $14.25."
Went to a local Best Buy and they were sold out of the latest camera
New HOD imminent!
Barron's........recurring subscriptions....revenue......the stock for now thru next year......
I was told in a yhoo chat room to buy all the gpro at these prices so I took out an equty mortgage and cashed kids college fund and am buying 100000 shares is this good? They said going to 20
Every single time. GoPro screws up every new device. From karma drone to camera launches. I regret selling too soon but I knew the move of production from China to Mexico would not go smoothly. Guadalajara Mexico is a drug infested city. No one goes into the city except drug dealers. Decapitated (seriously) bodies found just outside city. On many occasions. Not only will there be delays but quality of the Hero 8 will not be good. GoPro should have gone to Vietnam. There are no tech factories in that area of Mexico that produce anything of quality. If GoPro thought this move would be lateral in cost and quality they would have originated production there. GoPro was trying to save some money and this is result. DJI new osmo action 2 will destroy hero 8 and be launched before hero 8. What a mess. Yet another year of burning cash.
woodman let her go we would rather own grmn stock
"Longtime lurker here. All of you here are pretty funny. You definitely keep me entertained. Been a longtime GoPro fan and bought in around 10 myself. Just wanted to say that I was at Bestbuy the other day and saw a kid with his family picking up a couple GoPro5's and I asked the employee how much of them have she sold and she stated they were selling like hotcakes....~300 or so this holiday season. Plenty of Bestbuys in the area so I am not sure if this is a good thing for the stock or not but I wanted to mention it. I have strong faith in the GoPro brand as they've always captured the market with their brand like Apple does. I also think their product is superior in most ways. DJI is cool and I own their drone...but they really make it pretty annoying to set up and get everything configured. Which is the reason why I was excited for the Karma, simple, intuitive and easy from the looks of it. Might not have all the features but it does cater to the average user who just wants an easy shot for their videos. Anyways, I am just rambling now...but I am long and have faith GoPro will pull through!! Keep with the updates everyone, I appreciate both negative and positive comments."
Woodman says it's coming . Get ready
"I was a believer in GPRO before coronavirus. But one can only imagine that sales are coming to a grinding halt. We already knew that Q1 figures would not be pretty because of excess inventory in the channel. Q2 will likely be a disaster. I can't see there being any demand at all right now for their products. it would not surprise me if revenue for 2020 is 50% below 2019...or more. This means that debt levels will increase, or the company will mint/sell shares, or both. If there was no coronavirus, my thoughts would be different, as GPRO was one of my largest holdings. I dumped last week because I see this heading lower. This is a product category that is both travel-related and non-essential, meaning that holders run a much higher risk of seeing further declines."
"Simply Wall St - James Lanzone increased his sales by almost 10%. This is small consolation for those of us who were halo pong for explosive upward move, but it’s now clear stock ain’t never returning to $4 ! Let’s hope this rises back to $13-ish territory in the next 2-3 months. I am disappointed in the lack of a fast move but the company - and therefore the stock - has stabilized. Long term holders will prevail."
tax loss selling.. next week will be better
Is it the Hood to the rescue?
"@Sarwar's enthusiasm (plus a few others on this board) is fascinating. It flies directly in the face of realizations for this stock and I have to salute them for both loyalty and positivity. Hopefully, pushers of this stock are real unconflicted individuals. I am also hoping that I am wrong. I've seen too many tailspins like this to bury my head in the sand. So what, they now have 2 billion views, this stock has tanked more than 90% from its high point! Quadrupling of the value via earnings will be nice. Sadly, still won't lead to break-even for unfortunate folks that bought early into this looser. GLTA."
All those gains over the last week wiped out in less than 5 hours.
"I agree and keep in mind that BlackRock owns 6% of Gopro and good fundamental profitable growth moving in the right direction under BlackRock’s guidance. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager. That one reason GoPro’s focus on operational excellence balancing Woodman running the company like a salesperson. The future is bright for Gopro, but they need to gain the confidence of the market performance. I’m looking in mid twenty’s in two years."
10-15 next week after buyout news is my take
"Yesterday's dip was nothing more than what has been happening for months. Without any new, material news, pps goes up 3% on Monday, down 5% on Wednesday, up 2% Thursday, down 3% Friday...none of it means anything as there is NO reason for it to go up or down right now, other than manipulation. Nothing has materially changed."
At Best Buy Chicago superb a pallet of hero 8 black only 2 remaining. More7’s in stock than 8’s. Ok sales on Max.
Watch the roach shorts cover GoPro tomorrow...... GREEN .
Woodman definitely sold into the rally in the high 8s. That’s why the quadruple volume and the step down all day long. When this stock pops at all he always unloads shares at the bid. It gets old.
This Baby is going to Rock after Earnings.DO NOT FORGET THIS POST>
GUYS MOVE TO FIT
We could see gains today of up to 15% no shares to short and no salers get ready start your engine

This stock has a 'reddit' feel to it.
GoPro hero 5 sold out at wall mart and target in my area.
"GoPro stock on track for best day in a year after results beat expectations--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shares of GoPro Inc.(GPRO) are up 18.6% in Friday morning trading and are on track for their biggest single-day percentage gain since this time last year. The company on Thursday afternoon posted better-than-expected financial results and management spoke of profitability goals.

""If successful, profitability and sustained growth should follow."" He rates the stock at perform. J.P. Morgan's Paul Coster wrote that GoPro's(GPRO) ""path to profitability became clearer, though management must execute on a heavily skewed 4Q ramp for us to get back on board.""

"Is there ANYONE here who will be man enough to say ""I was wrong"" if the following is true? SARWAR? JOHN?

"GPRO could be acqired by Facebook or Apple...but don't be surprised if someone comes out of ""left field"" and picks them up soon."
...what just happened today? Does it mean a bad news is comming and everyone already knows except me ? What's the news?
Guys trust me this could of been worse. I looked at the detailed numbers it's not as bad as you would think. They cut costs like crazy to post .29 EPS with all the bs they went thru last quarter this is not that bad. Mark my word this will not stay under $10 long
This stock has been in freefall since it opened this morning. The angle shows it closing around $5.90
"this is easy money...""GoPro's Plus subscription service surpassed 305,000 active paying subscribers as of November 4, 2019, up 21% since our Q2 2019 Earnings Release dated August 1, 2019, and up 66% year-over-year."""
no balck friday for me this year. I'm broke because of gopro. will sell this pos for tax loss.
Do you all know that GoPro average target price now is 7.38$? Up from 6.25$ . This should let you know what is coming.
Sarwar: sorry about the huge drop today. Truly. I don’t like seeing American companies fail.
