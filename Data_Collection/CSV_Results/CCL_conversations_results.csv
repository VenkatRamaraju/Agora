Thumbs up if you think we hit a false bottom on CCL
"We already know that the earnings report will be more than 8 million dollar loss, no profit, no idea when they will be able to make money again, can they actually avoid bankruptcy?So why would anyone buy this before earnings report? use your common sense."
UBS upgrade trying to get a few more bagholders in. Have fun with your confirmation while CCL plummets back to earth
The business will be back. Be patient.
Bears are out in full tonight.... vaccine approval! Sail ban lifting in less than two weeks! Hold ya shares boys next year will be at $25 easy 18 -24 months will be at $45. Let the bears spread more negativity it just shows weakness

"luis2 days agoMARKET ""ZOMBIE""The ""zombie"" market created by the FED continues its artificial bull run in an unflappable way, without a doubt the indexes have lost contact with the economic reality and the FED has created a market addicted to permanent stimuli that will no longer be able to return to normality.I have no doubt that the markets will rise as long as the creation of money by the FED persists, the balance of the Federal Reserve is increasing and will continue to increase in order to maintain the market.The ultra expansive free money monetary policy (which only benefits a very small group of people) is causing an unprecedented accumulation of unproductive debt, in reality, the investment of companies is at historical lows, companies are simply accumulating debt and then use the money to buy back their own shares.The increase in inequality is increasing every day, the working class continues to make the greatest sacrifices.The magically created money policy of the FED is holding back productivity growth because companies no longer have to dedicate themselves to producing, they no longer have to be profitable for their share prices to rise, I repeat, now they simply acquire debt to buy your own actions.Although the FED denies it, we all know that infinite QE has only served to force indices to rise.Now, the big question many investors ask themselves is: why have the mountains of free money magically printed not achieved a general increase in the price level of goods and services? The answer is very simple: the real reason to keep inflation under control is that all the money created does not reach the pockets of the working class, that is, consumers are the only ones who can generate an increase in the demand for goods and services, that exceeds the capacity of companies and consequently generate inflation, but the reality is that most of that money has served to force the indexes to rise and favor a very small group of the population, remember that 5% have close to 90% of the stock market, therefore it will be difficult to see significant increases in inflation.We are in a delicate situation where the working class will continue to make the greatest sacrifices for the benefit of a very small and select group.June 07, 2020"
On the other side of the clouds is a big blue sky!
"The opportunity to buy Carnival now is incredible, even if you have to for year or more. Not only do we have a vaccine on the horizon, the cruise ships can now test people for Covid before they get on the ship so it will be a lot safer. Check that off the CDC list and we're sailing.... And the price is unbelievable at this level."
"Buy now for 27, tomorrow for 28 or Monday for 29. We're on the way to a new 52 week high!"
"Buying this doesnt make sense unless you have a lot of cash and are thinking of going long.Entering under 10 looks good in 3 yrs. You can forget about dividends for at least 12 months but in a few yrs it should be 30, 40 with a good dividend.If this pays 2 dollar dividend a yr in 3 yrs think how good it is if you buy it at 10 dollars a share.But forget anything good this yr unless you are a good trader and can buy and sell during this crazy fluctuations."
@Bawls Are you ready for more good news?
"The company’s (Carnival) nearest maturity is 500 million euros ($605 million) of 1.625% bonds due on Feb. 22. They currently trade around par, according to Bloomberg data.$530,000,000 monthly cash burn + $605,000,000 (+1.625%) = kiss goodbye close to 1.2 billion dollars in February. Money is running short and at this point, with s&p lowering their credit rating, they can only raise money through junk bond sale. And even then, not only that this will create another debt at high interest, but 600M is a drop in the water. Chapter 11 is getting closer."
One year from now yesterday's 24.68 price will appear as a 52 week low. Golden opportunity to load up. There's nothing to loose

"BIG Turnaround Pre MARKET !BREAKING NEWS........ Sailings To Resume !Carnival Corp.'s AIDA Cruises said it will resume sailings in August after they have been paused since mid-March due to the Covid-19.The unit said it is starting to take bookings Thursday for the AIDAperla that will start sailing Aug. 5 from Hamburg, followed by AIDAmar from Rostock-Warnemunde Aug. 12 and AIDAblu from Kiel Aug. 16.The sailings will have capacities that are lower than pre-coronavirus levels and won't call at another port, AIDA said.The company said it will require passengers to fill a digital health questionnaire prior to cruising and will check their temperature before boarding. It said it has physical-distancing guidelines and routing systems on arrival and departure and on board, and that it will manage capacities at public spaces such as restaurants, bars, theaters, and sports and wellness areas.AIDA also said it will equip its ships with Covid-19 testing kits and have around-the-clock medical care on board.The resumptions come as AIDA's parent company is redeploying certain vessels due to delays in ship deliveries amid the pandemic, causing sailing cancellations through as late as May 2021 in the U.S."
Price target $33 !LOAD UP ON CCL folks!It will be here before we know it!CCL = Strong Buy!
I’ve been trading ccl since 1988. Made so much money. Trust me this company will be around many more years!
"Comments from the US Government Coronavirus Task Force March 10th (link to video below):1. Noone from the particularly vulnerable population is going out on a cruise in the near future.2. If someone gets seriously ill on a cruise ship, whether from Coronavirus or another cause, the cost of medical care onboard the ship, airlift evacuation, and land based care will be at the expense of the cruise line.3. The cruise line industry provided Government a proposal today. Government will be reviewing the proposal within the next 24 hours and putting plans in place to ensure the safety of the passengers. They will look specifically at the hardest hit states being Florida, Washington, California, and New York.4. The last question of the Q & A session was a 2 part question on coronavirus tests and cruise industry potential bailout. The test question was answered but the bailout question was not.5. They mentioned tax deferrals to assist the hardest hit industries including airlines and cruise lines but the most important focus of the stimulus package is to assist individuals will sick benefits and lost wages.Now it makes sense why RCL and NCLH increased their lines of credit with banks over the past 24 hours.Link to the press conference below (cruise comments start around 4:25 into the video).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k55xdwKJTw"
I tend to avoid companies with no current revenue or any future revenue in sight for the next 6 months.
13 million shares in less than a hour!!!! Up up up!!!!!
"Beyond a flattening if the curve on COVID-19, or word of a vaccine, what would, if anything, pull this stock up in next 4 to 6 weeks?"
"This will get worse - they are probably losing 1.5 to 2 billion per quarter. Profit fell from $336 million in the first quarter of 2019, to a loss of $781 million in the first quarter of 2020. Earnings per share were a negative $1.14, compared to $0.48 in the same period last year. The company said that not only were forward bookings for the remainder of 2020 “significantly behind the prior year,” but that even bookings for the first half of 2021 are down. It reported having $4.7 billion in customer deposits as of Feb. 29.It’s worth noting that the period covered by the filing is before the cruise industry suspended all voyages in mid-March. The company still generated $916 million in cash from its operating activities during the first quarter, indicating that its losses in the second quarter — during which no cruises are likely to sail — could be much steeper."
CCL is just warming up for its launch to $42! No worries!
"$42 by May 1, 2021! T - 1 week before CDC stands down and lifts the no sail order!"
"Some CCL holders are turning this room for political discussions, not financial. They are getting desperate & blaming everything on CDC, as if the CDC has full control of all cruises in the world, including Europe, Asia, Oceania, central & South America. Cruise ships are global companies & each region has its own rules & guidelines. Health departments in other countries could care less about the Democrats or Republic. They have their own worries & circumstances. Bottom line, cruises will eventually sail with fewer ships & many restrictions while loaded with massive debt & diluted shares that will only grow before sailing, which will drag them down for many years to come. Enough said.."
Looking nice and GREEN today!
Ok. Chuckles. Shout out to the people that bought at the bottom and are holding long-term
First time thinking of investing in cruise line. Is this a good buy?
whos ready for a cruise?
fly ccl...fly today!
"CCL said is set to sail, here or abroad it’s going to pull anchor!Let the cash roll baby!!!!!!!"
"Sold 200 shares of puts today (Jan 2021, 30 strike) for $2.7/share. I will either be collecting the $540 premium or buying in at a net price of $27.3 for 200 shares. Hopefully I just get to keep the premium, but buying this at $27.3 is hard to go wrong with long term. As I see it I win either way eventually."
"If your day trading, Buy the pullback after market open, this is gonna fly today..."
Both RCL and NCLH are trading higher today. CCL will catch up to them.
"As of May 29th. 32.52% of the float is short... Yeah.. I'd be scared to short because everyone needs to cover to collect on their money. Another point If this company goes bankrupt then shorts can't even collect their money. Mortality rate dropped again as well. Where is this ""spike"". Don't believe me? I put the numbers for you everyone here to verify. Go check for yourself. https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"
Hi guys!When CCL report earnings? Tomorrow in premarket or aftermarket ?
I am new to this stock as of today. What's the consensus on where we are heading?
When it tanks well it TANKS
"A Federal Judge Overturns CDC's Unconstitutional National Ban on Evictions! Interesting, the unlawful CDC cruise ban should be overturned next by the conservative FL judge!"
"I set my buy order for 1000 shares @ $20. Please, somebody short it down so I can get it."
This is undervalued
HOLD THE LINE CCL!
day traders testin their luck again. hoping people will test this drop.
"Shorts always tout here the same stories: bankruptcy, dilution, virus...Investors have shrugged of those and started to focus on the bright future of CCL.Solid liquidity and great demand for future bookings. Buy and hold: $60 next year."
Next earning reports in June 22 will be from March - May imagine how horrible it will be since no business in those months! That's when it will go down under $10 and that's when new investors should invest in my honest wise opinion. Any thoughts?
"CCL is an $80B company, deep discount current pricing"
The 55 mil shares short will boost ccl past $30 soon.
CCL $30 by Friday $$$
the only buying that is being is done by shorts covering their position for profit taking. once all shares are covered the downtrend is going to continue. you bulls buying nothing right now.
"CCL, Lighten up, normal stock movement at this point . My opinion, CCL will show significant increases as cruising begins to open up going forward. Prediction CCL will be over 30.00 leading into Summer and into the 40's toward the Fall. jg"

India triple Covid variant. CDC is warning of global cases increasing. Are you feeling lucky holding cruise stock?
And they still haven't announced that they will push back cruising for at least a couple months or more.
"The Norwegian state oilfund is the largest Sovereign fund in the world, and now they are buying Stocks in Carnival Cruises"
The director bought shares at $8 a share. The stock was about $8 on Apr. 2. The Saudi share buy announcement was Apr. 7. hmmmm
Really bad trading .I hope change management soon .
"Did anyone actually read the CDC's 40 page framework for conditional sailing order that was issued yesterday? No cruises longer then 7 days to or from the US. Masks are required. Testing before you embark AND before you can disembark. If one person tests positive forced isolation and the whole ship is quarantined then forced to return to original embarkation port AND then forced quarantine when back on land... only transport from the ship is on non commercial flight or charter buses! The list goes on and on. This is all of course ONLY if each ship passes a simulation cruise and can actually get certified to sail under a huge list of conditions. The cruise lines can't even advertise or sell cruises longer then 7 days anymore! That ends Hawaii, Panama Canal, Transatlantic, South Pacific Crossings, etc. AND before booking a cruise the cruise lines have to advise passengers of the CDC's travel warnings for cruise ships. Good luck getting your travel insurance and even health insurance to cover you. This order is in effect till November 2021. Think about it, one passenger or one crew member tests positive and your socially distanced mask wearing cruise vacation is an instant nightmare! We won't be booking anything for 2021 and I'm not even sure how the cruise lines can financially weather this storm. Glad we sold our shares earlier this year "
Why is this going asymptotic after hours? What I do know is shorts won't be sleeping well tonight.
"Adding more myself, might sell them if this rallies into the close. Have my long term shares still @ $8."
Stocks will recover but CCL is one that will go down further ... for the foreseen future until this pandemic passes. Can Realistically go into teens..
4mn revenue with a 1.5Bn mc. This belongs around 10/share compared to ChargePoint
"A senior adviser to two former U.S. presidents delivered a stark message Friday to Canadians hoping for the resurrection of the Keystone XL pipeline: get over it. The project is gone and not coming back, said John Podesta, who was White House chief of staff in the final years of Bill Clinton’s second term and a senior counsellor to Barack Obama.Call it coincidence or retaliation, you can forget about Alaska cruises until next February. Speaking of retaliation, White House looks at domestic travel restrictions as virus variant surges in Florida. That will surely affect some of Carnival's future cruises."
"Governor DeSantis is going after the CDC to reopen the cruises, they are threatening to port elsewhere. Won't be long before things are normal again"
The boiler room continues. I remember people saying this was a buy at $37 not even 10 days ago.

“Good news” ONLY $2 BILLION loss — JUST $250 MILLION More than expected!Really? Investors will overlook this!
Credit Suisse upgrades to outperform. PT: $40.
We are on cruise control and shifting up to a higher gear soon. That's what I think.(and hope :)
"CCL is and will continue to be a $$$maker! Cruising will come back strong, soon.Stay long and take it to the bank. Jg"
Can Amazon take this over like AMC....I would love a 56% up day!
classic value trap
their earnings call will be amazing 300% increase in sales and 5000% increase in sales in 2022 solid investment.
All we need is some positive news from the Center of Destruction of Cruises about reopening guidance.
Are Earnings today?
Any other longs holding this for at least a year? Got it at $9.90  
"Unfortunately I bought it at 16.30 yesterday, do you guys think that it’s possible to hit 16.30 soon so I sell it and wait better place? I was afraid that this would fly, I don’t know what I was thinking, I got 2k shares"
This recent news provides a nice buying opportunity
"I'm not sure why the cruise lines don't just plan Vaccination Vacations. Anybody vaccinated can cruise. With some 20 million in the US getting their second doses in the next three weeks, there's plenty of folks who'd love to travel. Including me!"
"The debt is definitely a concern short term and will be looming until the vaccine gets to a certain percentage of the population that we can look to move past these crazy shutdown conditions. With the cash on hand, created by the shares sold and new long term debt, they have another year, without having to add to the share dilution or debt. When cruises continue, CCL will be able to attack the debt right away, prior to reinstating the annual dividend. Not paying out the normal dividend for the next 2-3 years may well be in the cards, but it will allow for CCL to get the debt back to reasonable levels quickly and possibly even buy some stock back, to restore some of the share value lost due to the pandemic. I highly doubt there will be opportunity to buy in the $20 range 6 months from now and beyond. Longs will serve themselves well, buying filling out their positions in the next 30-60 days IMO. I am loaded up and will push a few more chips in, if we see anything lower than $19 before then. Good Luck All!!! Lets Make Some Money!!!!"

"I entered a bit high from here $29/sh. My intention is a long time hold. My wife and I were, prior to COVID, very active cruisers with CCL and other cruise lines. My gut feeling, is that any price under $30 is a good entry point. Obviously, if you can buy in lower and CCL begins to open up cruises that are not sailing, then CCL should rise to the high $30's to low $50's. It is a time sensitive trade and holding maybe my only choice. But I feel strongly that the cruise industry has shown promise once again and will grow. I also see the potential for CCL and RCL to offer sailings to ports they do not service pre-covid, but now may see opportunities and possible smaller cruise line competitor take overs. I am bullish and see this as a long time hold."
watching charts. I can see people are trying to buy back in right now because they sold at a lower price and fomoing back in and this is how you lose money. once you're out. stay out. and I suggest you guys reduce or get out of your position because this will go in the teens I absolutely guarantee it.
Very strong support at $20. The Saudi cavalry I guess. First thing when investing is to know you won't loose money

"Max 3 month ban. CCL has $ for 12 months. This delay actually helps because nobody is cruising til COVID cases diminish (newsflash, it will be within 12 weeks - cases are peaking now) ensuring an on-board outbreak wont happen again. That being said, I hope this stock gets slammed because I'm long and wanna keep averaging down"
I have been warning you not to short CCL from these levels. You are playing with fire. Their growth game has just become even bigger. CCL will be trading around 70s in 3-4 years.

"$CCL $RCL $NCLH Pent-up demand! news 3/8/21With the pandemic still in full swing, and none of the major cruise lines cruising just yet, raising prices on a service that no one can yet provide may seem like strange advice. But here's the thing: CIN reports that cruise reservations are ""flying off the shelves,"" and the cruise companies are enjoying ""record sales volumes.""Analysts think this is indicative of strong pent-up demand and are encouraging cruise companies to take advantage of this surprising seller's market by raising prices.

Just add rapid covid-19 tests before boarding. Problem solved. Mostly old folks going on cruise ships that got money and no job to loose. All on board this is going up and away!
Honestly I planned to just hold for a long time. But the continuous no-sail extensions is too much risk for me. Sold all my cruise shares today at a 60% Gain. Planning to buy in again once there is a bit less volatility
Fauci needs a gag order and we need to get on with life.
The COVID curve is flattening. Cases have dropped 16% in 2 weeks and dropped 76% since the peak in January 2021. At this rate everything will be normal again by this summer.

Hold our buy/sell today?
Carnival just accepted delivery of a new boat named Mardi Gras a company without any revenue for almost a whole year and a cash burn of $800 million every single month since and on 12/18/2020 carnival was supposed to disclosed their 4Q earnings but decided to postpone it until January 7 for reasons unknown but I could only guess it was for the reasons mentioned above all the burnout of previous cash
"Will be over 50 by the end of the year. One of the best stocks to invest right now, along with AAL & M"
What are “sponsored posts” anyway? Herd immunity is closer than we are told. Have to count cases that recovered and are immune. Government information is skewed about immunity and it’s frustrating we are not getting the whole story. Better that we are scared and grateful to the powers that be than “confident.” CCL will sail.
BOOM!
back to 18
Looks like the news we waited for months wasn’t good enough wall st realized today Ccl is in major trouble

When are these GHOST SHIPS goin to sail again?
Opened a position this morning. Love you guys!
"Thought about buying CCl or RCl here and going to pass. They will probably recover and do good, but just not sure if they will make it in time before a wide roll out of a vaccine. Another issue is the dilution of shares and the bonds with warrants issued. Even if this gets traction going up the selling pressure could be too much"
Can’t wait to cruise again!

"Everyone here talks about CCL and all the cruise lines based on average price, ranges,.short and long etc. Think is, a major economic sector has never experienced a moment where something like a deadly contagious virus basically shuts down completely. Wish new cases.annoumced a few hours ago, it going to get to a point were no ports are going to allow cruise ships from.other countries to dock, and NOBODY will be wanting to board a crowed cruise ship where they can be held in quarantine for up to a month. People will find other forms of vacationing until the coronavirus is controlled and vaccine created. This will take at least a year, if not longer vaccine wise. Going to be devastating to the industry, as well as the economie that depend on the tourist $. Add a bear market and nervousness by the public,.u can unfortunately possibly see a huge loss by cruise industry, while being overextended with heavy debt that was going to be paid based on 2020 estimates. People I know are canceling their cruises this year. If it spreads in California where a few new cases were confirmed, kiss 2020 goodbye and say hello to a recession."
so if they dont cruise til november how much cash will they have burned by then? Thank you for your help
going up all week. Saudi investment a big deal. take a cue invest now
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"I am happy for all the shorts today that had those great 28 and 29 puts. Way to go, again!"
This goes up a buck overnight!!!!!
What was the sudden increase about?
"David, you are gonna get smoked....JNJ news pending with 100M doses ready to distribute to pharmacies across the US..."
when does the company earning report come out?
nobody is going to want to cruise with a mask on ....no wonder MC analyst just gave this a $4 price target and doesn’t expect cruising to start again until 2024
CCL is looking good! Could the CDC's decision be leaking out to insiders?
Left Ft. Lauderdale yesterday and saw 5 cruise ships docked in port. They have not been there for over a year. Nice to see them back and getting ready to go.
"As we watch oil drop in price and ships idled, we wonder about how much fuel volume CCL has hedged and how much they will have to sell into the market given their demand for fuel slows or stops. A double whammy Oil is a headwind short term"
Need 10% correction
"You don’t have to be an equity strategist on Wall Street to get this, COVID 19 is dead by summer both in the US and even in Europe. Sailing is back on in summer."
Going to wake up to another 10% gain!!
Stock in great health .Direction 30 $ without problem .Strong buy
"Reopening, vaccines rolling out, people looking to travel after such a big dry period, cruises and airlines are gonna boom so much. Extremely bullish"
"Cruise ships, similar to theme parks, are designed with density in mind. How many people can fit in a confined space.It’s likely we’ll see India-like outbreaks on multiple ships this summer. It will be a PR nightmare.Alaska is shutdown for another year. The good news is that the RV industry will pick up the slack.CCL bankruptcy by the fall, perhaps winter."
I keep trying to post an article about CCL Shorts getting burned by a 12% gain in just the first week in February and why. But it keeps getting deleted.
Two types of people here1. Day Traders - CCL may be not for you2. Holders - Buy and hold it for a year and your investment will double at least. What will happen in 2021 ? - Life will go back to normal ( at most part ) which will include travel.
There’s a lot of tension on here tonight! Until there is a vaccine we aren’t punching to the $20 let’s be real. Day trade this with a long term position kept in the back burner. It’s not going BK. Everyone’s just trying to make a Buck mean time.
When you’re UP 40% you can afford to toss cash.... SHORTS will be graveling at my feet for a few bucks to cover...CCL = Strong Buy!
"Sorry for all of the spam, but has anyone been able to find the actual AstraZeneca press release? It feels like the mainstream media is intentionally over-hyping this. This is the most complete quote that I have found so far: ""This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday. ""In large trials illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully. We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimise any potential impact on the trial timeline.""https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/08/astrazeneca-halts-covid-19-vaccine-trials-410308"
I assume dividend will be suspended. To much lost revenue.
Carnival's To Do List for today:1. Sell cruises to Alaska based on the hope that lobbyist in Washington will bribe Congress to OK cruises.2. Cancel or delay cruises to Alaska until the 2022 season and offer cash refunds or rebooking to 2022.3. Sell up to 50 million shares before the share price drops below $254. Focus on the 2022 sailing season5. Try to renegotiate lower interest rates on $20 billion in debt.
this should be at $15 no more
"Royal Caribbean Interview: CEO Fain says any changes required at first might not need to be permanent.“There will be a lot that will be a lot different, but it’ll be one thing the day we start up and something else a month later, and something else a month after that.”Likening the situation to restaurants, he says: “Some are starting with low levels of capacity so they can social distance. Then, as they prove that works, they’ll reduce the social distancing. Before long, these restaurants will be back to the way they were before.“With cruise there’ll be a transition period too but the fundamental experience – the things people like about it – will still be there, and that’s what makes it attractive.”https://www.travelweekly.co.uk/articles/372754/big-interview-royal-caribbean-cruises-richard-fain-says-sector-will-come-back-stronger"
bad news but SP going up. interesting
Travel and airline stocks have a long ways to go down yet people. Think hard about it.
I sold yesterday and booked a 5 % loss if I had held until today I’d have got out clean ahh well. U can never time the market but I’m out so doesn’t matter. I wish all the longs well I hope it works out big for you all but I see a very steep hill ahead not advice just my ramblings. Good luck all who continue to sail in her
"Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian on watch for CDC updateMar. 16, 2021 8:10 AM ETCarnival Corporation & Plc (CCL)By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor1 CommentJPMorgan says it expects to see new CDC guidance for cruises relatively soon and believes the specific instructions will generally be more agreeable that the last update in the fall.Looking ahead, the firm thinks the key issue for cruise line operators will be pricing.""We are gaining conviction that the most likely direction for ticket pricing is higher from here, driven by pent-up demand against curtailed and phased-in capacity, limited occupancy later in 2021 and into early 2022, extraordinarily long booking windows today, and a further recovery in booking volumes likely to happen once the CDC moves and brands restart marketing efforts. Net yield growth of MSD+ has been achieved in years of strong demand, and we believe the sensitivity to pricing for cruise equity values is underappreciated.""Price target revisions (2021 year end, taking into account share offerings): Carnival (NYSE:CCL) to $33 (11% upside), Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) to $110 (16% upside) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH) to $36 (14% upside)."
"Just woke up a millionaire between AAL, UAL, CCL, and NCLH"
"Booked my first cruise ... with Carnival for only $279 plus tax, Oceanview per person on August 1st. It goes to Nassau, Grand Turk and their private island Half Moon Cay. It’s a 4.5 day cruise with three beautiful beaches which is what I want. We are going with a group (6 couples) we need a break and couldn’t pass this deal. Folks soon things will be back to normal. Buy and hold all the way to $22 - $26."
"Buy and hold, buy when others fear! This is going on an upward trend! Buy and hold, check the charts, it’s obvious."
This seems like a bad year for Carnival.
Carnival secures $4B financing package. Thumbs up for bullish
"Canadian TV Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said in news conference ""Avoid all cruise ship travel"" as well. CCL will have to fold as no cusomters will board the ship. Heavy debt, hugh fix costs will wipe out the companies. It will not be sustainable not to shut it down."

Trumps administration releasing 3 phase plan to get U.S open and running again....
"I'm new to this group, just bought a few shares, why, because there's a bent up demand or at least feeling that a lot of folks want to get out and travel. Once they open up it's my humble opinion that cruses will be booked for some time to come. Yep, just another long."

"..........................and Johnny said,..........................................................and so it is.............................so that's that."
"Was long since early April and sold out at $26. Happy to more than double. The vaccine progress coupled with new mutant virus will put additional pressure on cruise stocks. Don't expect sailing till June or later and $CCL, $NCLH, $RCL will raise more cash and cause dilution. Good company, but stock will only move south on any bad news. Not a good investment at this time. Will reenter in the teens."

"CA starts phase two openings Friday. Now everyone realizes:1) quarantine wasn't to cure anything, was meant to merely just spread the deaths over time as health care system and local/regional/federal were unprepared. At this point, it is time to stop.2) There is no ""safe"" . No Coronavirus vaccine has been developed over 20 years. There wont be one coming for this. And just like the flu, it will mutate anyway. 3) The fake ""safe"" for the sheeple for at worst one percent leaves 99% being destroyed on many levels. not just financial. So a net benefit isn't happening and finally various medicare Govt leader get the idea. Time to get the economy going.watch this compressed spring open up."
"There aren't many companies out there that is doing much business right now and obviously their losing like crazy but at the end of the day, the question is who has lost more and has the potential to gain back the majority of what they have lost in the next few months. This happens to be one of them that I think would gain majority of it's losses back. This company allows you to vacation without going over your budget, and to me that is always a winner."
So Carnival is borrowing money and pledging no assets in return. Not good. Nothing to stop them from borrowing into oblivion.
Seems like CCL cannot hold on to the nice inter day gains. When the start price is highest the selling begins. Day traders I guess. They will only stop when they get left in the dust
Better get on-board now...as soon as it is announced that cruising will commence we will promptly sail past $35 to bluer seas!!! :))
"CNBC again just mentioned strong bookings for 2021. cruising is vital business in tourism and it can't just disappear like that, carnival have financial back up and funding till next year which is enough to generate revenue again with strong bookings."
"CDC now claims only 90,000 died of the COVID-19 in revised numbers. Now it looks like we shut everything down over a bad flu season."
STILL GOING after hours. $13.20. Where will in stop? No one knows.
"if they're allowed to start sail, bookings will come in fast. people cba with the virus forever and also, they can simply have a pcr test before sailing."
you want to hear the truth? tech is bloated so people are scared to go in. recovery stocks like carnival are scary to go in because of CDC being controlled by democrats and Europed lockdowns. People are looking for value plays but even value plays will drop on a overall market correction but not to the extent of stocks that lie outside of its fundamentals. This is why everyone is talking about a crash and goldman sachs keeps saying no crash is happening. They did the same thing in 2008 and said the real estate market is alrite and then they went short on their investors.
What date is CCL earnings release? I don't it listed officially anywhere.
15 is support.
Shorty be shortin
"Well, that played out perfectly. Sold CCL over a month ago, and bought Gilead because of remdesivir (see my previous posts). Can’t get any better than that."
"Load up the boat, Not even 7m shares traded in the first couple hours. No selling pressure and people are getting cheap shares. Another good time to add more shares if your looking to invest.Good luck longs."
June $35 calls super cheap.
"The fed is buying corporate debt like crazy. Nobody is going bankrupt unless they have no chance of future sales. Scared of Covid? Carnival already had a ship full of people who spread it to each other. An actual case study to learn from and develop better safety procedures. But wait there’s more, everyone has been couped up at home and wants a vacation!"
So much for my Alaskan cruise thanks to Canada. No cruises in Canada until at least February of 2022.
"Sorry @Bill. I owe you an apology. I posted to you earlier. I forgot, you won't be here today. CCL is green and so is OCGN."
Watching people buy this stock is like watching people boarding the Titanic. They look so happy.

"According to the government, by July 2021, all America’s who want COVID vaccines will have them.that means the epidemic will be over. Sailing will resume this summer."
The oil prices are so high.
when this drops to $20. I guarantee you new investors will enter and talk about how cheap it is.. oh they do not know.
told u this a month ago this company will be bankrupt by November mark my word
"Micky sold $103,000,000. In CCL. And he is the chairman. What does that tell you? It tells you the stock will never be this high again."
"What is so encouraging for the longs is that CCL shares are going higher on huge volume. A lot of buyers are coming in. With the virus under control by spring, ships are going to be sailing real soon. We should see CCL hitting $35-40 in a few months. A lot of shorts on this board talking BK. The more shorts we have, the better for us when the squeeze comes. GLTA"
Fair value for CCL is around $56
"Carnival needs to start storing oil on their ships. They’ll make a fortune. If they can fit a few barrels per stateroom, they’d make more money than sailing with people. Oil doesn’t eat at the buffet!"
Special thanks to those buying the dip; perhaps CCL can delay the inevitable a little longer......
Congrats to those that took profits today. That money can be invested with another solid company thats less risky and actually making revenues.
Pretty funny that Carnival’s main clientele are anti vax folks but they won’t be able to cruise on Carnival without a vaccine. What to do?
All Cruise lines will be allowed to conduct business again. They’re too important to the economy. We have vaccines available & a lot of precautionary measures can be taken. Lots of people love cruises as well. We’re going to have this business as long as there is ocean in the world. Not to mention it’s a very profitable business.
Arriving at the bottom of the wedge. Should bounce here...

Wow thank you CCL! I lost a ton shorting the market and made it all back in 5 days with 3500 shares of CCL! I thought I would just buy and hold since I am an avid cruiser. :) Just wish I had bought more. :)
I believe the judge handed it off to a mediator so tomorrow may not bode well when the news comes out 
Bullish!!!!
GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY RIGHT HERE!! Stock price will sail full steam ahead following announcement by CDC soon that cruising can once again commence!!!

"I just had a procedure in the local hospital. Talked to a couple of nurses about the ""new"" virus. They said it is so overblown right now. Corona virus has been around for years. This is media hysteria at it's worst."
Up pre market bc of ABT news. There’s a call at 910am est . If that goes without anyone saying anything to negative about the vaccines then this will continue to trickle upward today.
pretty much no cruising til next year. the best months of summer gone.. might drop all the way to 10 dollars. pretty much puts this right back to pandemic timeline
"Yahoo says Carnival has an earnings report today, but I don’t see any info on that??"
Anyone think this will take a cool off day tomorrow? This thing has gone nowhere but up for a week.
After Hours will shoot over $27 !!!!! Huge Help Coming.... Cruise ships going to SAIL
"Look at the huge volume of March 12 (Friday) $27 calls. Probably written by Goldman Sachs who have 40 million secondary offering shares to sell.CCL finishes the week under $27, just like it closed below stack of $28 calls last week.Longs might make a penny this week, but they will not make a dime."
"Once-in-a-lifetime chance!!! Down to $20? Cruise lines stock is definitely a winner in 2021! THINK think deeply & wisely, how could cruise line has no growth in 2021! When the Covid-19 cases reduced to single digit in China, people get out & spent money crazily (even thought no vaccine yet!)..Cruises will do GREAT 2021! Do not let the market-players take your cheap stock away! REMEMBER! this is once in the life time chance to own a definitely winner!!!"
This is why you never listen to the conversation on here or on any platform. Yesterday people are screaming and yelling saying “this is barely a low teen stock”. Dont let these people persuade you to sell your position. Just do what you want to do.
It is time to buy the dip on this. I don't see how today changed the reopening narrative at all over the next couple months. Shorts are going to lose quite a bit of money here in the long run.
Congratz to those who sold and made profit!Congratz to those planning to hold long term!
"Huge up day in the market today. This stock goes up a buck. A handful of folks on here are happy and think it’s headed upward now because of the up day in the market. Reality check, the stock will have up and down days, but more down than up, because of the poor situation that it is in. This will continue for quite a while. Sorry to burst your bubble but in the end, numbers matter. Cash burn matters, stock dilution matters, no cruises matters, Coronavirus effects matter, the outlook a year from now matters, a year from now the company still losing money on its balance sheet(which WILL be the case) after using up all of its cash on hand and liquidity very much matters. It’s nice to be positive and hopeful, but in the stock market it’s better to be smart and knowledgeable on the true picture..."

Colorado stopped masks in most areas. We need are cruises. We have been stuck here for over a year. Can't wait. It's like waving candy infront of a baby. Time to sail. $CCL $RCL
Be careful “shorts” because maybe the earnings report is not what you are expecting. Be careful because maybe Carnival has agreed with some countries resuming many cruises. Be careful because the Saudi money didn’t get in for nothing. Be careful “shorts” because lots of “institutions” are getting in. All the best for everyone 
"Don’t get stuck holding after hours, they will try and get an offering in soon with the stock at this price"
I’m pretty sure this next wave of Covid is going to be a lot worse than what everyone thinks. I hope I’m wrong but I lm right a lot more these days than I used to be. I got more to lose in equities than most of you on this board I’m sure. Be careful what stocks you own going forward. There is going to be a lot of movement soon. GLTA

diluted 1 billion dollars @ $25.10. burn through 530 million dollars a month. delayed cruises til may. i think they're going to delay cruises again. in which case another 1 billion dollar offering for 2 more months. anyone buying here is going to be treated like a free atm machine for carnival.

I find it funny. Some ppl on here think they are going to get a stimulus package. If a package is granted for travel it wouldn't be for cruise lines. Most of these ppl don't even know what country they are registered in. It's PANAMA not the UNITED STATES. They pay no taxes to us so why would we give them a stimulus package. funny Ppl.

Losing money, while having to keep all aspects of ships in working order, paying docking fees, etc. Thus, the losses quarterly.Most bulls sight the ability to burn through cash and maybe sell some boats. But, let's look at the prospect of selling boats. They already tried and failed. More than likely because of the return they would see.What is that sale price? Given they stopped the sales, it must be pretty low compared to the retail value of the boats. 20%, 30%, 40%?? This is unknown, but prospective buyers (of which there are only a few and typically are CCL's competitors) would more than likely be in that 20-40% of retail value range. Given that reality, The sale of all Carnival Cruise Line assets (essentially the sale of the company before or after bankruptcy) would pay off total debt and leave very little or nothing to justify CCL stock price. The above is why CCL stock is vastly overpriced given the current situation."

airlines are open why not cruise lines
derek chauvin got convicted of all counts.. people are extremely sensitive and scared.. you think democrats are going to budge on lifting the no sail order extension that desantis is trying to appeal.. Tough luck.. house and senate are going to enjoy this chaos.. they're not going to lift anything.. they don't understand freedom. they want compliance and control..

"No operations until April 2021, means no cash. CCL is burning money every day they do not operate the business. This jumped from 12 to 17 on vaccine hopes. But there still is no business until next year. I see this dropping to $12 again very soon. Sell and get into stay at home plays. COVID isn’t over, in fact cases have never been higher. Look to invest in companies that will be around forever, no matter what happens."
All price targets hit we should see the down trend continue 24.20 will be the bottom
The weather is great!!! let’s start cruising people
There are so many ppl trying to scare others so they can make a profit. Kinda sad to be honest. If you do your HW you would understand that this company can survive 1yr without making a cent. The market will rebound stop playing mental games with others onhere.
We should see at least $20 today. Vaccine distribution to start soon and everything is going back to normal.
CCL SHOULD SET UP A CLEAR DEBT PLAN FOR THE SOON FUTURE.
People can keep doubting me and listening to the shorts waiting to see them lose money! But this strength AND GROWTH in 2 days of all red exchanges shows the immense strength of $CCL
I would normally say just reduce your position and buy the dip but this is going to dip really hard. I would say just get out and avoid Carnival stock for awhile. they're going to have to raise more money again. I don't know what part of the capital stack they plan to raise but it's not going to be good.
"I am a short-seller of CCL because my entire portfolio is down several hundred dollars because of the bear market triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and I am looking to make back some money to ease the pain. I see the cruise/gambling/hospitality industry stocks as the surest industries to short given the obvious negative impact the pandemic has on these industries. Once I make a few $ on what I see to be an inevitable short- to mid-term drop in these stock prices and buy to cover, I hope all of these stocks rise up to even higher heights than before the pandemic. I hope that all of you long investors have your patience rewarded and strike it rich. GLTA."

"If CCL and NCL double be November, sell and re-buy in December. Their acceptable value is CCL at $42-$44 and NCL at $46-$48. Anything more is overvalued and they will fall back toward normal value. As far as the comment about CCL reaching $27. That's. not a problem. CCL has been in an up and down cycle between $27- and $29+ since mid February. Hope that it breaks out of $30 so it can head toward $35. It needs Europe to sign off on the monthly pandemic progression schedule for decreasing affective cases."

"When cruise line stocks crashed in March part of an overall panic and no cure or treatment known. Now the panic is over, there are better treatment procedures, and dozens of vaccines likely to be approved for public use, (many in third phase with a couple of those began in June.) It's only been four months and all the cruise lines say they have cash for 12 months and options after that. Sounds like one of Russia, China, India/Europe will have something from testing in Brazil - good news."

I’m thinking about opening a margin account just so I can short this stock. The most glaring short opp out there. I love how owners are pumping up the stock price to make it look like everything is ok. Will only leverage the mid to long term financials to an even more negative outcome. I’d get the hell out if I were you all.
This board is for the investors..... not for the shorters....We all know currently there is no business in cruise lines.....
CCL to resume on aug 1st starting cruises at $28/day

"$CCL $RCL $NCLH  CNBC ANALYST JUST SAID THEY’D BE SELLING CARNIVAL —  READ THEIR CRUISE SPECIAL DROM TODAY - On CNBC today: “40Bn total lost in 2020. If things return and the CDC clears the cruise industry, there will be; No self serve buffet. Covid testing. Temperature checks. Mock voyages in the fall with no passengers to prove safety. Limited passengers when they allow passengers. Mask. Rising fuel and labor cost.” Huge changes from 2019. Reiterating: No self-serve buffet? Im out. Sorry, this is insane. I’ve been a shareholder for while, I’ll take a cruise in a year or two, but this is way too sketchy now. HUGE CHANGES EVEN AFTER THEY OPEN - IM OUT!"
I couldn’t wait for my cruise on April next year. I will definitely get the unlimited drink package.

Miami Dade Mayor released a letter last night. She’s meeting with CDC officials to come up with a plan to start allowing cruises to sail soon out of Miami under new guidelines. You heard it here first. Any minute now it will come out on the news.
IMMINENT LIFT OF CRUISING RESTRICTIONS OUT OF U.S. PORTS BY CDC. IT'S A MATTER OF DAYS NOW.
Going to pop up
"I really want to grab some shares but I think it will hit 23, then buy!"
Notice that no article is bein posted. There is no additional CDC guidance. There is one reference to the Conditional Sailing Order remaining in place on TradeWinds. The next phases of the CSO are under review. If you read the Order it clearly says that it can be lifted prior to Nov. 1. There will be a glut of vaccines coming within about 1.5 weeks. This will pop back up today unless people continue to be confused.

"Expect the same today, early rise and then sold off, It is what it is at the moment. Making a nice base here in the process. It will rise when they want it too.."
"Their credit rating was downgraded to junk by Moody a few months ago. Now Moody is considering to downgrade it even deeper into junk territory. With this kind of rating they will have to borrow at a very high interest rate. It is highly unlikely that with such credit rating they will be able to borrow at 6%. I f previously they paid 12%, they will now pay a lot more and not half. BTW, why borrow money in the first place if they allegedly have billions of dollars cash in hand???? Why not use this cash and pay off debts instead of creating a new debt? Longs here were so proud that they have enough cash to survive for a year or two. Where is that cash? They already burned all of it?????"
I bought and held CCL when it dropped to $8. Bought some more today.

They expect to be able to be in mass production with the ""active ingredients"" on that line in December of 2020. In order to get to 1 Billion doses per year they would need to raise capital and build something like 5 manufacturing lines. Interesting..."

"Perfect couple of days :) Held nicely on support yesterday. Today there wasn't a follow through on volume, It only picked up when the the buyers arrived, So hopefully $28.50ish is a nice support level. They stepped it down today on light volume shaking the tree and picking up cheap shares. RSI nicely lowered. Also a lot of positive news regarding CDC, Fed, Disney. Lets see where we go from here. Still very bullish...Good day longs. :)"
"Definitely a good sign, but just read the whole guidelines, and there is no mention of cruises. Talks about domestic travel, and international flights."
I don't know what will happen. I bought in CCL and NCLH both under 8 and was going to hold long term. they both shot up one day to 18 and 20 and I should have sold but I held and then they bombed the next day. I have been watching the news and there's still 11 ships that cannot dock with sick people on board. CCL said they are losing 500 million a month. I sold both and got out with a 50% return in around 10 days and it was my first time buying stocks so I am very happy. I don't think anyone really knows what will happen but I wish you all good luck.
so can anyone please sensibly explain why people should buy carnival shares.. i bet you can't.. don't talk about no CDC may or may not.. give me some real positive info... revenues.. less cash burn.. firm start date?? anyone?
"Oxford coronavirus vaccine: Does it work? And what happens next?The global race for a vaccine is on - here's what we know about the Oxford vaccine and the effectiveness of other jabs around the world.Scientists believe they have made a significant development with a vaccine that has a ""double defence"" against coronavirusOxford scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in their quest for a Covid-19 vaccine. Here's what you need to know.Does it work?The clinical trials have so far been successful, the Telegraph understands.Researchers have shown that antibodies produced against sections of a genetic material called spike protein, usually found on the surface of the coronavirus, after infection are able to kill the virus when tested in the laboratory. They want the human body to recognise and develop antibodies to the protein that would stop the virus from entering human cells.Trials suggest that not only is this happening but also that the body is developing a crucial T-cell response as well, which is deemed crucial in the defence against coronavirus.When will it be available?AstraZeneca is on track to begin rolling out up to two billion doses of a coronavirus vaccine in September, if ongoing trials continue to prove successful.Chief executive Pascal Soriot revealed last month that they were already starting to manufacture the vaccine.Prof Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at the University of Oxford, has said the ""best scenario"" would see results from clinical trials in August and September and deliveries from October.What is the next step?As the level of coronavirus in the UK subsided, scientists began trialling the drug in hospitals, where it was likely to be more prevalent.They have also enrolled 5,000 volunteers in Brazil and others in South Africa.Developers are expected to report their Phase I study results - which would show whether it is safe and whether or not it induces an immune response - within the next fortnight.The global vaccine race: How other countries are developing a jabWorldwide there are some 218 vaccines in development, according to the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine's vaccine tracker.Of these, some 29 are in human trials - though experts caution that there is no guarantee any of these will be effective. Or it could be that early versions of immunisations offer only partial protection from disease, reducing Covid-19 from a deadly illness to something comparable to a common cold.The Oxford vaccine is one of the most advanced, described by the World Health Organisation’s chief scientists as a “leading candidate” partly because it has recruited a large number of patients with trials underway in Brazil and South Africa. MeanwhileAmerican biotech, has said the vaccine triggered an antibody and T-cell response in 34 of 36 patients in a recent trial - though they are yet to publish data to back up their press release.Are these other vaccines effective?Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at the University of Nottingham, said that other vaccine technologies are not expected to activate both aspects of our immune system."

""We are excited to once again serve our guests from the U.S., and we express our deep gratitude to all national, state and local officials who have worked collaboratively with us, the CDC and our entire industry to make this possible. It is great news for cruising, for travelers ready to again explore the world and for all the communities in Alaska that depend on cruising and have suffered great hardships over the past year,"" said Arnold Donald, CEO of Carnival Corporation.""As one of America's natural treasures, Alaska is a land of beauty and wonder, and one of the most popular destinations for our guests. We look forward to our brands restarting this summer from the U.S. while also supporting our longtime partners and the communities in Alaska.""Donald added: ""Our highest responsibility and top priority are always compliance, environmental protection, and the health, safety and well-being of our guests, the people in the communities we touch and serve, and our shipboard and shoreside personnel. As we continue to work with the CDC on requirements for sailing in the U.S., we remain committed to returning to service in a way that serves the best interest of public health and provides our guests with a great cruise vacation at an exceptional value.""Plans for these itineraries to fulfill obligations under the Passenger Vessel Services Act (PVSA) are expected to be approved. Princess Cruises, Holland America Line and Carnival Cruise Line are each continuing the return-to-cruising preparation already underway, according to a press release.Carnival cited recent guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and close collaboration with Alaskan officials for the restart.These Alaska cruises are available for guests who have received their final dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to the beginning of the cruise and have proof of vaccination. Crew vaccinations will be in accordance with CDC guidelines.Princess Cruises will resume operations in Alaska starting July 25 through September 26, with seven-day cruises onboard Majestic Princess.Holland America Line will resume its cruise operations to Alaska with seven-day itineraries aboard Nieuw Amsterdam, calling at Juneau, Icy Strait Point, Sitka and Ketchikan, with scenic cruising in Alaska's iconic locales, including Glacier Bay and Stephens Passage. The first cruise for the brand is scheduled to depart July 24, with 10 Saturday departures that will operate through October 2.Carnival Cruise Line has already opened Alaska sailings departing from Seattle beginning July 27, with weekly departures through September 14 aboard Carnival Miracle.

Clinical laboratories can evaluate 94 specimens in under 3 hours, or 382 specimens in under 6.5 hours, with a single Thermo Scientific KingFisher purification system and Applied Biosystems real-time PCR system combination.

Look at the rapid rise of cases in Europe... 1492 new cases in Italy, 133 new deaths Germany and France 20% new cases daily, both over 1000 cases, USA over 500 cases, nine countries had more new cases yesterday than China did. The short term future for cruising - ....there is no short term future for cruising, they will all be parked until this virus is contained. Just my opinion based on the facts"
"It's a billion dollar corporation that's been in business for 50 years, has more financial stability than any of its competitors, and was easily trading at triple (and even quadruple) where it is now before COVID-19. It's going upward because those things are true. A virus with a 2% mortality rate isn't going to turn off the entire world from cruises forever and bankrupt Carnival. Even if the price dips again 2, 10, or 100 more times."
"Who knows what will happen with the pandemic but once it is under control and there is a vaccine, CCL will spike! Just be patient..."

"From The Miami Herald regarding DeathSantis lawsuitThen there’s the issue of standing. While cruise companies may be able to successfully argue they are victims of the federal government’s regulations, the governor is unlikely to be able to make the same argument.“It’s a political stunt, and it’s not viable,” said Bob Jarvis, a constitutional law professor at Nova Southeastern University. “DeSantis doesn’t care that it’s gong to be laughed out of court. By the time it gets dismissed his base will have moved"

"Carnival Corp. Won't Go Bankrupt: A Dive Into Its DebtApr. 03, 2020 5:55 AM ETCarnival Corporation & Plc (CCL), CUK48 Comments5 LikesSummary Carnival Corp. recently raised $4 billion of 11.5% senior secured and $1.75 billion of 5.75% senior convertible notes due 2023. A public equity offering of 62.5 million common shares at $8/share was announced at the same time. The new $5.75 billion of debt is on top of about $9.5 billion of existing debt due through 2023. This comes after failure of any help from the government's $2 trillion stimulus bill because of foreign incorporation. With cash flow generation of $800, the company will be able to service its debt and return to normal valuations."
"If you're wondering why this popped today, it's because of this news: https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/how-fed-intervention-saved-carnival-11587920400 Essentially, it's because big investors just found out that, back in late March, CCL was about to take on a big risky loan from sleezy junk bond firms with 15% interest and other terrible terms due to low liquidity in the corporate bond market. But the Fed's injection of liquidity to more established banks and bond buyers helped attract better investors and more favorable terms to CCL's bond offering. Now, as we all know, the terms from the April 1st offering were 11.5%, which still isn't great, but the article showed that the Fed's efforts to inject liquidity are working--which wasn't clear until now--and that's a good sign that, if needed, CCL might be able to get more loans with favorable terms from reputable institutions in the future. So, the Fed's not ""bailing out"" CCL like some (Cramer, Bernie, etc) have sai, but it's efforts to get money to banks is working. That was not at all clear until this article."
"when you hear on earnings call in 2 weeks that 40% of passengers have canceled bookings whether paid in full or in part, huge losses will be guidance. ships cant sail 50% full, they bleed cash if less than 85%. the operating losses would be staggering. They will have to scale back on the number of cruises, cancel them outright and refund passengers, the range of what could happen is mind boggling. Layoffs, parking ships for months, lost revenue will cost them hundreds of millions. Americans most of all are health freaks, they will not gamble a few thousand $ and take their cruise, my guess"

Just stick to travel like cruises and cannabis and gaming and you’ll be better than fine. You’ll be fine and high and having fun too. Btw buy Norwegian too. We’re all still on the breakout watch lists."
"Let's have a day longs. Probably 5%-9% today.. Shorts, better cover now before their brokerage calls them.."

"All mandatory non-essential business bans are being extended. There is NO way they can open tourism back up until a vaccine is ready. TOO much risk to other nations, let alone to our own. Good luck out there, but all travel and Airlines are doomed. The Stock Market is 100% over valued. Science is the only thing that can save us for investment purposes. The irony is Mother Earth is being saved now."
No chance cruises will resume in 30 days. For sure will be extended.
I am in at 27.18 another 5K shares here. Probably $50 by January.
BAYLOR WINS NCAA TOURNAMENT! $30 BY CLOSE?
With the vaccines going into peoples arms it?s making it easier and safer for business to start running back to normal and that goes for cruise lines. Right this second I would wait maybe 3 months before buying stocks with any of them because they are expected to drop some more before rising once again. I also have no problem showing these business that I have the vaccine because it makes them feel safe and less likely to need to quarantine any ship like it did at the beginning that hurt the cruise lines and other business at the beginning. As for #$%$ will improve just as long as everyone fallows CDC guidelines.
"If this is 2A of the phase and it took them 5 months to arrive at these instructions, it seems they probable have all the phases figured out, now it is just a question of when to release them. It is just a matter of time for 2B to come out and eventually they will lift the entire CSO. They are waiting for larger percente of the population to be vaccinated and the daily cases to decline on a consistent basis. So I am interested to see what CCL opens up at on Monday because these guidelines can be read either bullish or bearish depending on ones viewpoint"

So they make about 73 million per week. Times that by 0 and you have why the share price is dropping

"Great time to buy in, this will up soon once things begin to open in a weekly basis, it’s a low risk high reward stock at this price, CCL will be fine, backed by the Saudi’s, this stock will rise soon. Take the opportunity now, this will be up in no time. Buy when others fear!"
Extremely high volume is taking it down.
If you believe the corona virus is a blip in the road and will be contained eventually. This is a great chance to buy a solid dividend paying company at a major discount. The stock market rewards investors who buy when there is blood in the streets and sell when people are greedy. This is one of those moments when you need to jump in a little at a time - and sit tight until it gets fairly valued and weathers the storm. I just opened a position about 30 minutes ago at 31.29. Hang in there longs.
Bought 350 shares last Tuesday at $8.07. Sold this AM at $12.48. Up 55% in a week. I'll take it.
CCL getting ready to DOUBLE!!! CSO will lift any day !!BUY BUY BUY!!!
Buy while not late!!! Flying to $32
My post keeps getting deleted. All I said was HA HA HA!

What was that at 1030? half a million share buy? Maybe a big short cover? As long as there is no bad CDC news between now and close we should touch $29
carnival extended pauses til june 30th. more dilution coming. keep pumping it
"Bubble burst. Hyped up over vaccine and now that’s it’s actually here people look at true valuation of company. Buy the hype/rumor, sell the news. Next stop $17 end of week"
SHORTY: Quit chasing the carrot for low pricing. Hop aboard CCL as it’s going to $65 in 2021! ITS INEVITABLE !
Major sell call should see a nice correction in the morning
"Do random Saudis influence your investments? if so, then Warren Buffett should influence your investments as well and sell alll your airline stocks. It doesn't make sense to buy CCL because random Saudis who you guys never heard of invested and not sell airlines stocks after Warren Buffett sold them lol."
Shorts better cover
SHORTY: I know you are feeling like jumping off a bridge..but WAIT! Swim to CCL and some of us will pull you aboard! CCL = Strong Buy!
Sold short at 30.10 - will cover when under 25 (probably next week) - easy 50K gain - stock with 30 billion debt and no revenues is a no brainer
CCL getting ready to fire up the ships soon.....get in while it’s still a bargain $$$
The WHO just put out a recondition to all people over 60 with any underlying conditions to not travel or attend large gatherings. That’s me. Why don’t they declare Coronavirus a Pandemic?

For now this is awfully fun to watch. Just knowing that EVERY DAY the shorts must pray they wake up just to see the color red. Sad part is when they watch the news at night that have to pray more people get sick or die to have a chance. What a sad way to live.
I hope whoever sold today took a huge bath!!!
I see all the pump. But what’s really going to happen. Right now. It’s 28.9. Predict 26.7 today
"Posted this Saturday but admin took it down:......Even though the 'no sale order' was finally lifted yesterday, which was a crucial threshold and a huge victory for Mike Pence, there's still going be some volatility here in the short term because of the election next Tuesday.....but on top of that the CDC is still willfully putting their thumb on the scale by insisting on a long laundry list of restrictions or 'expectations' to be met in order for normal capacity cruising to resume. They want 'test' cruises to show that mankind is God and king over nature. Its incredibly absurd.It's ridiculous in my opinion for the CDC to think that they are going to eliminate a virus through protocols ...it's overly burdensome and unrealistic. Do they think they are going to control every aspect of our lives regarding someone catching a virus. Uhhh, actually that's exactly what they think.. I've coined it the 'Fauci delusional syndrome.' It's just unnecessary IMO. Especially with a 99.9% survival rate and that the vast majority of people on cruises are between 25 to 70 years old. That group has little to no issues with Covid,.. even if they get it ......Simply have passengers sign a waiver holding the cruise lines harmless if they should contract Covid under the guidance that the cruise lines are making realistic efforts to keep passengers safe and comfortable. Basically an indemnity clause. Which every small business including the cruise lines should employ.To think that man-kind is going to completely control a virus is incomprehensibly pompus. So in short, cruising is unfortunately still overburdened by the CDC and the Democrat mindset for now... but I think you'll see some lessening of these restrictions and unrealistic expectations AFTER Trump wins the election.Trump 2020"
"You know what. I think I am going to buy some Carnival soon. Everyone loves a cruise, and this is going higher."
"As a 25yr travel expert, I tell you buy and hold!! CCL demand is off the chart, booking are highest ever and they haven’t announced start date yet. CDC have to announce in April and they know it, they are just holding on, so it looks like it was their idea and they didn’t buckle to massive pressure"
"risk of covid on a cruise ship isn't any different than on a plane or in a theater...but theaters and planes are in operation.....this is just a ruse against the cruise industry by the CDC nothing more.....and who is the CDC to stop a company from operating? I know the cruise industry is trying to do the right thing by following the recommendations, but CDC is not an authority that can shut down business. They have led people to think the CDC has some mass authority and they don't"
Tomorrow 30 $ .Normal price .Now its strong buy .
"I am sad to say, this article about online forums is @issay to a T. He fits all the traits of a basher.Thumbs up if other forum participants agree."
"12 percent on 17 bill in new bonds is about 2 bill a year in interest, add that to 1.6 bill in interest per 2019 cash flow and you see that the 3 billion net income of 2019, if that ever returns, is not enough to keep CCL afloat. Current shareholders will own nothing, and the bondholders will take ownership. Did I miss something?"
"@Chuck and Hugo.....Question. Do you or do you not have a position in this stock/company and if you do, approx. how big of a position?"

Been trying to get a refund for cancelled cruise going on 3 months. They just dont want to give up the money. Will file a lawsuit on Monday.
Sell sell sell
"CCL IS MOVING TO $35, only to be followed to $45 then $65!!!BUY BUY BUY!"
"Less than 10k cases daily in the UK. 15m vaccination target met today too, generally looking good worldwide. Here's to a better year :)"
I have a put for $30 should I continue holding or sell immediately when market opens. I’m down $60 so far
"Set an alert for $14, have to convince myself to buy then. May get luckily for one more pump And dump before bankruptcy"
That was a nice close all charts indicate we will trade much lower
Looks like no cruises out us in July cdc changed it plan
CLL is shaking off todays drop
Go check out stockwits. Bears are getting quite worried!
"A Plausible theory? Part 1: CDC lifts NSO, CCL spikes to mid 30's within 1-3 days! Part 2: the WSB TARDs finally are aware of this revelation & go full TARD on CCL, sending it to $100 within 1-3 days! It could def happen!"
if I had more cash to trade I would go all in CCL. this is a no brainer guys. will go up by 10% tomorrow
Royal Caribbean issues $1.5 billion in shares today and somehow competitor CCL is down even lower! Yikes!

Reports from Europe indicates most countries have suspended giving the AstraZeneca vaccine due to complications in some recipients. The results is expected to be further lockdowns in Europe. This is far from good news for the cruise industry.
"Most of you are playing the stock. Me, I’m one of the many cruise passengers who look forward to getting back on the ships. When my world cruise was aborted at the beginning of the pandemic and CCL stock sank, I determined that because there had been no actual ship that sank that the stock price would eventually return. While still on the ship (!) I bought positions and am now surprised and happy I did so. Btw, I have two future cruises reserved."
CDC controlled by democrats. Governor Desantis which is a REALLY good guy called for CDC to lift cruise restrictions. Guess what.. Democrats don't like Desantis.. Tough luck.

CCL had better come up with a Diamond Princess plan quick. Before everybody on that boat is infected. Set sail for Hawaii or something. Prepare a hospital for them. Right now every new case starts the 14 day quarantine period over again. Hawaii is a 3 day sail at full speed.
why get a bail and start paying taxes when you can get a loan save money and give higher dividends to your shareholders and build bigger ships. Carnival is run by a smart team AAA grade just be happy your in so low we wont see this in our lifetime again.

However, some guests are starting to worry that this could be a sign of a further suspension.https://www.cruisehive.com/carnival-details-new-options-for-cruises-seven-days-or-less/47094"
"If you buy know it’s at a premium for today, but it’s a bargain for the future!"
"No one here expected to reopen cruises by end of Q2, Q3. People are buying this with assumption that there is no earning Even till end of the year. And that’s why it’s $10-12 not $40... Do you really want it to be $3-4 just they can’t make money for 2 quarters? BK for the biggest cruise company with recently cash raising? Less likely"
Do you think Carnival Cruise lines will go bankrupt? Any advice please
"Bull trap? At least is good to see the LONGs come out and play. Yes, they only come on when there is green on the tape."

Boom!!!!!
It takes some time for this stock to climb to $60. Be patient. Buy and hold.
"The stock can go lower to $7, $6, or $5 but not sure why many of you even consider bankruptcy would be the only resort for this company. Two points to be noted and than you decide if bankruptcy is certain: 1. 2019 it generated $20 Billion with 30% net profit; and 2. Carnival just raised $6 Billion on bond with 11.5% interest with maturity date on 2023 which was overwhelmingly bought by investors. $6 Billion is not a pocket change that investors would just handover to a company that may be on a verge of going bankrupt. And remember, after 9/11, airline companies didnt went bankrupt but they actually got bigger than ever before. So people will go on cruise again 2 years from now as many has been doing for decades, otherwise why would even Carnival has $20 Billion in revenue."

Thats why it's a double edged sword. I don't know why the left media keeps pressing this. They're going to lose if they don't get logical. Oh, yahoo is a left media."

This thing's got legs. I've seen this before back in 2009. Gotta hop on now and let this horse run. No telling how far this will go. Situations like this is why we invest. The time is now. We're not seeing 12s again. Ever.

If the market sells off, these cash burning companies are going to be the first to drop like rocks. Reading the last report casts fear, uncertainty, and doubt for at least the next 6 months."

"All stocks are trading with the same pattern today, pure manipulation, don't be played. Stay long."
Anyone have any idea why this is the only cruise line in the green today?
Up over 75% since I bought CCL but I am very long on this. These red days big and small will be easily forgotten once the economy truly gets up and running. I only really thought about two things before buying and while holding. A) is CCL going bankrupt - No B) is CCL currently anywhere to the value the company is truly worth - NoSo why sell? I am not for a long time.
Get ready.....it won’t be much longer.....SHORTS ARE SCREAMING
"CCL has reported its 3rd qtr financials; it doesn't look good. CCL has a non-standard Fiscal Year which ends on Nov 30, so its reports are about a month earlier than most other companies. If you're a stockholder there is a lot to worry about right now. Two items are particularly worrisome - since the 1st qtr financials, long term debt has doubled from $9.7 B to $18.9 B; also since the 1st qtr the quantity of common stock has increased almost 30%, from 685 M shares to 883 M. In short, even if CCL revenue gets back to pre-COVID levels it has a big hole to climb out and what earnings there are will be divided much more finely. CCL will survive as a company, but I doubt stockholders will much benefit in the next 3 years minimum."
"if CCL gaps up over $27 in the morning, next resistance is at 32."
"Only 7.72% short. They are not convinced. Normally in this environment...in this industry, you would see north of 15%.This is going higher."
Can everyone say Christopher was right on on indicators
"The real truth and confidence in this stock will be after the first few sailings and the results of those sailings when they return. If nobody gets sick from COVID-19 (not counting Norovirus) and those results are released to the public, I believe more and more cruises will be launched and the confidence of the cruising public will be increased tremendously. The result(s) will be a boost in the share price. However, if a case (or cases) of COVID-19 develop among passengers, folks may take a little longer to build confidence in cruise lines and it may affect the share price although, CCL has shown that one way or the other, it appears to be a somewhat resilient stock/company. Time will tell"
"what a lot of ""invetors"" are missing here, is this, the founding family owns close to 25% of the outstanding shares, micky arison the chairman is the son of the founder, his sister is the richest female in israel. they are not going to let this company go under, you should have recieved you annual report/proxy this past week, ccl has had record eranings, but they have had headwinds before the, no more docking in cuba, problems with at least two ships, longer then expected dry docking. but if you look at pay out ratio, it is in the mid 40% and micky ariosn himself would loose close to 300-400 million dollars if dividends where cut or suspended. that is a lot of money. once again this is another waste of shareholder money with ill timed buybacks. buybacks are the biggest waste of shareholder money. its all smoke and mirrors, just look at two other companies that wasted billions on buybacks, gis and ge."
"If CCL are selling $500 million worth of shares @ $13, why is it trading at $17? Do I have the price of the secondary offering wrong?????"

Carnival just opened 8 day sailings today with updated CDC guidance. Bullish thoughts for everyone!
CDC states no cruises until November 1st. I sold all my shares that I bought at $18.11 mid last year. I would hold but bankruptcy is a real concern now. Might buy back if it drops below $20.
Norwegian cruise lines Oceania cruises says launch of 2022-2023 itineraries on march 3rd. Resulted in Single best booking day in the company's history. Demand is deff there :)
The volumes are also kind of low today. Is everyone waiting for the White House Coronavirus Task Force Press Briefing today?
We'll close around 20 this week. I know a lot of you try to talk this stock down but that's just makes it obvious it's going up.
"NEWS!! UK announces return to Cruising. CDC under major pressure to relax cruising restrictions, will do so possibly this week with proof of vaccinations. CCL will shoot past $35 when announcement happens, GET IN NOW you will kick yourself if you miss this ride up."
"Probably makes sense to wait until fall to cruise anyway. They'll be more vaccinated people by then. It takes around 45-50 % booking capacity to break even. Cruises have both high fixed and high variable costs, so why operate a ship at 15-30% capacity and lose even more money? Demand is there, let's wait. We'll probably see cruises to nowhere, where they'll dress rehearse cruises."

"Planet Hollywood announced they will begin construction of their newest hotel in Cabo, early 2021. For now, the location and the size of the hotel, has not been disclosed so hopefully we will find out soon. The government announced the other day that today we will move to a level 3. What does that mean? It means that bars will now be allowed to open and anything that is currently open will be allowed 40% capacity to 50% capacity. It's so exciting to see that we are moving forward, and tourists are coming in!"
CDC Eviction Ban Overturned! Judges found CDC exceeded authority to stop spread of virus! This bodes well for May 12 no-sail injunction to overturn CDC overreaching by restricting sailing! I am even more confident that on May 12 the judge will throw out the No-Sail Ban and cruises can sail IMMEDIATELY!https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/05/05/biden-admin-appeals-judges-decision-to-overturn-cdcs-nationwide-eviction-moratorium/?sh=6433362380ad$CCL $RCL $NCLH
"Listen guys, I don't think many, (if any), cruise ships are gonna have to file for bankruptcy.. I think people will indeed cruise again as early as the no-sail order expirey. I'm basing that off the fact that /i/ personally would sail again as a consumer. Even if the no-sail order gets extended there's still ways around it, like docking outside of the states - however with states already starting to open back up, that's highly unlikely/necessary. It's more likely that the order is suspended early tbh. Especially once the /real/ coronavirus data starts to be released, showing a 0.0x mortality rate. For example here in Ontario it's 0.01.. in Cali I believe 0.03? .. the numbers are just astronomically low. That being said, cruise line passengers and staff /have/ died from the virus.. and even a few deaths can taint the image of that industry and cause psychological issues in future passengers. Majority of people that cruise are old - and old people are at highest risk. They will need to do some serious marketing to target a new demographic, and with that, obviously comes lower revenue than we were seeing pre-corona. Meaning the peak we saw is not the peak we should expect as the evaluation will be decreased for many years. Still, I think a fair value is $38/share by August. Just be weary.. if there's another outbreak they are basically toast. I'm investing another $10,000 @ $16.40 given the new information I've learned."

"I'm pretty excited about the RCL Seaface mask patent. I was thinking standard surgical masks don't make sense, especially in water sports areas, but... I realized that you can always have some sort of free breathing snorkeling mask with a virus filter on it.

"yowza... if and when we hit $30, it will be a 300% gain in <11months since first buy, and 375% gain in just over 10 months from second buy. Sold half the shares with a $15 limit order twice- once going up, the other a down limit sell. Bought back some between 11 and 13. I'm lining up a cruise for two on a stern room with balcony and panoramic views... all on house, or rather ship money.. Not too shabby.. %^)"
"I'm guessing after a 1 dollar up in less than 5 min, people hungry for money captured they 100 dollar profits or maybe $500, that such a poor vision in my opinion, but well... that's fine, every brain is a world."
I don’t understand all of the selling . No matter what this is easily a $40 dollar stock when things return to normal and $60 after a few quarters of paying down debt. This is the one stock I don’t trim because the only thing keeping me from greater upside is time
"For those of you who say day after day ""Who would ever want to go on a cruise""Pent-up demand': With bookings strong for late 2021, many cruisers are ready to sailMorgan Hines, USA TODAYMon, December 7, 2020, 8:06 AM PSTAfter what will have been a shutdown of more than nine months, the cruise industry is preparing to sail again in the U.S., and major cruise companies have said bookings are strong for the second half of 2021.While the industry prepares to return to U.S. waters with new health and safety precautions and in accordance with new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the United States, along with much of the globe, finds itself in the midst of a worsening COVID-19 case surge.With the pandemic continuing to rage across the nation, are cruisers raring to get back out there?The answer is yes, according to Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the leading trade organization for the industry. It found that 73% of cruisers say they are ""likely to cruise"" in the next few years, and 50% say they will cruise within the year.The data that Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications for CLIA, shared with USA TODAY, was collected before news broke that a vaccine may be available in the coming weeks.""Our data shows that cruisers are eager to cruise again and are willing to follow stringent public health measures in order to return to sailing,"" Golin-Blaugrund said, noting 90% of cruisers polled said they would wear a mask.""People have grown accustomed to taking such precautions on land and understand it is a small sacrifice to make in order to experience the joy of cruising while maintaining a focus on the health and safety of oneself and others,"" she said.Michelle Fee, CEO of travel agency Cruise Planners, echoed the cruise line association's sentiment. She told USA TODAY that there is ""pent-up demand"" for cruising. She expects that many people will be back to sea in the second half of 2021 after rescheduling their 2020 reservations.""There are people who are ready to go and are raising their hands and saying, 'I want to be on one of those initial cruises,' "" Fee told USA TODAY, noting she would be willing to board a ship herself. ""It’s my industry; I would probably be (on) one of them.""""Cruisers are going to cruise,"" she said.Carnival, Norwegian and Royal Caribbean all see demandMultiple major cruise companies said booking trends have proven that cruisers are still interested in sailing in spite of the pandemic – particularly in the second half of 2021.The first half of the year, according to Carnival Corp., reflects COVID-19's affect on the industry, but for the second half of the year, bookings are still looking good.""While the company believes bookings in the first half of 2021 reflect expectations of the phased resumption of its guest cruise operations and anticipated itinerary changes, as of Sept. 20, 2020, cumulative advanced bookings for the second half of 2021 capacity currently available for sale are at the higher end of the historical range,"" Carnival Corp. said in its third-quarter business update.At the company's last business update in October, 60% of those bookings were new as opposed to redeemed future cruise credits being applied to new journeys, Roger Frizzell, spokesman for Carnival Corp., told USA TODAY.Carnival Corp.'s lines are scheduled to resume sailing at various points. Some sailings are canceled into April 2021.Similar to competitor Carnival Corp., Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. said in its third-quarter earnings report released Nov. 9 that bookings are below historic levels, but the company doesn't expect that to continue indefinitely.""There continues to be demand for future cruise vacations, particularly beginning for sailings operating in the second half of 2021 and beyond, despite limited marketing efforts,"" the company said.Norwegian is scheduled to resume sailing in March.And Royal Caribbean echoed the sentiment on bookings.""Booking activity for the first half of 2021 is aligned with the Company's anticipated staggered resumption of cruises,"" the company said in its October earnings report. ""The cumulative booked position for sailings in the second half of 2021 is within historical ranges.""Royal Caribbean Group's cruise lines have suspended sailings through February, with additional cancellations beyond that date.Ken Muskat, executive vice president and COO for MSC Cruises, which has been sailing in the Mediterranean since the summer and expects to sail in U.S. waters in March, said he sees an appetite for travel overall that the company is ready to feed not only in Europe but also in U.S. waters once it receives approval from the CDC.""With our guests eager to get back to cruising and new itineraries, ships and destinations lined up, we’re continuing to see growing interest in our 2021 cruises,"" Muskat told USA TODAY in a statement.150,000 people expressed interest in taking a"
Added more at $60.60. Good buy

Welp that’s a huge bear flag if over ever seen one…..hope the new CDC news helps
"Two weeks ago, shorts argued for CCL's bankruptcy. Now they cried out you should sell to take profit. They are essentially bunnies in the headlight. Ignore them and focus on the bright future of CCL. It is $30 this week and $50 this summer! Hold tight this gem."
Got in at $9.00... I was 100% prepared to lose that money lol. Next day the Saudis buy half the company. Sheesh
more and more ppl is vaccinated. they would get back to travel really soon. Can't stay home anymore :).
This thing is dropping tomorrow. I will buy it lower. Good luck everyone.

"Now that Carnival can begin cruising to Alaska, any speculation for an increasing share price is more hopeful. Share prices will at first drift slowly downward, but will then suddenly shoot up dramatically. Expect more bearish posts in the coming weeks as panic sets in."
ALERT: CCL BARGAIN ALERT!!!!
Carnival officers didn’t delay earnings to announce bad news. It just doesn’t make sense. Good luck to Carnival and their shareholders. It’s been a difficult time which I hope is ending soon.
Going to RUN UP end of day
I don't understand why you shorts beg for scraps.... down 2%
CCL docked in Mobile Al yesterday must be getting ready to Sail.
As a reference. I thought this was crazy expensive at $25.10. With all the cruises being delayed in summer this is going to go well below that price is all I'm going to say
Premarket price dropping as traders start to figure out the late night news of $8 per share equity issue pricing and $10 per share price on convertible notes. There's no reason for it to be trading above the $8 equity share price right now. Why should you pay more on the market when there's 62.5 million shares being priced at $8 per share. It should open lower and not higher.
Amazing this isn’t down 20 percent of the earnings and this news
You really think cruises will begin by summer? Think again. Time is our friend here to diminish the virus coupled with the vaccines.
@blind optimism leads to failure I baught ccl at $12 and sold at $14.50 do you think we can see $9 again?
"Interesting reading some Analyst opinions. Cruise stocks are definitely increasing because cruising is just around the corner and the analysts appear to want you to sell now ??? Wonder if they have other intentions,like buying on the sell off.??? Be very careful what you read. I have been following CCL for a long time and anybody who bought during the last year should be looking at great profits going forward. cruising is almost ready to begin again. jg"
travel will reopen but at some point fundamentals do matter for carnival as well. this is overvalued.
"A LITTLE RHYME FOR OUR SHORT FRIENDS – RIP!It's days like this, that makes me love stocksWhen the shorts get caught holding their cox.They think they are so smart with their puts and callsBut no matter how they play, they end up banging their heads against the walls.They can't figure it out, it just makes no senseThey just don't see the greener grass on the other side of the fence.Fundamentals don't matter now; we’ve never seen this beforeIt's more about recovery and momentum, not your silly folkloreSo quit being negative and come join the funWith the next three announcements there is more room to run.And when this dip we know you will be back talking your trashBut Just remember us longs, you know us…. We are the ones with all the cash!"
Get ready to make MORE CCL MONEY!!!
DeSantis is calling to rescind no-sail order
I’m holding
Almost half the available shares have traded hands today. If the stock can't be pushed down today it is going higher tomorrow and that is a fact.I will be adding more at the close if the stock holds up.
"CCL's Costa Diadema, just returned to port cutting 10 days off a cruise. Passengers tested negative for COVID-19 prior to boarding but guess what? It did not stop this virus and some passengers got it. Anyone who promotes this stock has a motive and a 'bad one'. The corporation's long past the point of any recovery."
"There is no way CCL is cruising in the USA this year unless the CDC is FORCED to allow cruise. The below is the CDC's updated guidance on cruising! :(COVID-19 and Cruise Ship TravelLevel 4: Very High Level of COVID-19Key Information for Cruise Ship Travelers CDC recommends that all people avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide. That's because the chance of getting COVID-19 on cruise ships is high since the virus appears to spread more easily between people in close quarters aboard ships. It is especially important that people with an increased risk of severe illness avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises. Cruise passengers are at increased risk of person-to-person spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported on cruise ships. People who decide to go on a cruise should get tested 1–3 days before their trip and 3–5 days after their trip, even if they are fully vaccinated. In addition to testing, passengers who are unvaccinated should self-quarantine for 7 days after cruise travel, even if they test negative. If they do not get tested, they should self-quarantine for 10 days after cruise travel. Passengers who are fully vaccinated with an FDA-authorized vaccine do not need to self-quarantine after cruise travel."
I've been bearish for a few while now but agree the potential for a huge squeeze is looming. Closed all my bear stuff on Fri. Not sure its low enough to go long tho because it could plummet suddenly with bad news and with index pressure. On the side lines watching closely for the next move now. I think it will squeeze up then go back down on the path it's on now. That's my humble opinion :)
Is this a good.buy or no? What's the debt I hear about?
Are cruise lines going to move operations to Cuba or any other islands?
"They don't need any money from the government because they secured their own. Then with the Saudis buying 8% of the company in the 13.xx range completed on may 26th this is really the bottom. Maybe we see $9-$10 range here or there. But that will be the absolute bottom.Either way I will add going down or going up for the next 6 months. I see a nice 10,000 share position with an average of around 13-14.Next year at this time it will easily be $20 and within 3 years this stock will be back in the 30-35 range.Long term this really is a no brainer."
Cruising was approved by CDC ...
Thumb up if you are shorting at the open!
CCL JUST ANNOUNCE CANCELED SUMMER CRUISES
We will open $28.00
"Now it makes sense why Warren Buffett and other big investors like Ray Dalio sold their airline shares and warned now is not the best time to buy stocks. Perhaps they are expecting the second wave of the virus in the fall? perhaps they are expecting the next earning reports in July and August for the months of April-June would be a lot worst than one just released? Now everything is coming to the light slowly and i am glad i am waiting to invest like them. INVEST WISELY PEOPLE DONT FOLLOW THE TREND AND BE BLINDLY OPTIMISTIC. Use common sense, do your dd, look at history of pandemics and recession, this will help you make a logical decision before investing and losing it all!"
@Jake You better call a non emergency transport company to start loading the bus.
massive short squeeze like AAL is coming to CCL.
"@David, I can’t inmute your account... I have to log out to read your Crying.."
"2.5 billion every quarter from selling general and admin. With no bookings, how long until bankruptcy with only 500 million in cash?"
Pump it! I need $30 or my stimulus check will be gone!
"Chart Update:- Still looks bullish, But very news sensitive atm. Last weeks action looks healthy as people were still prepared to step in, in the face of a weak market. Seems range bound at the moment $24-$29. Looking at the positives if we can break $29.30 then we could go to $33 and then $39. Negatively Support @ $24.50, $21.74 and $17.89."
I’m in long. As long as we can stay out of bankruptcy we’re good.

One of the very few stocks that is still undervalued in the market right now.
"I have been telling you not to short this stock for days now. Short interest ratio is just huge you are basically giving away your money to longs. None of the big cruise boys will go BK they are pretty cash heavy right now. Europe and Asia has beaten the virus. They started vaccinations and the US soon will follow. You are risking your portfolio for a ""maybe"". From risk/reward standpoint this is the wort stock to short right now. It was a good idea when it was 25-26 a month ago when cases started to increase in the US but not now. $CCL $UAL $NCLH $RCL $PLAY"
"You call this ""investment""? Billions in debts and growing. Money pit. Burning $600MM per month. 12 years to recover. Insiders selling. And you call this a good investment?"
Read a couple of articles that said airports were packed this weekend and that people were ready to get out
Not sure Carnival will pull through today's news after it's last round of high interest fund raising...
All aboard!!!!! CCL WILL NOT be held down!!! Cruisers are packing their bags!!!!!
Hey chuck when are you going to answer my questions? I know you are super concerned about the health and well-being of the readers here but is it possible you post what you do in order to spread fear because you would like to short the stock?
"Booked a Med cruise on a Princess ship (division of CCL) for November 2021. I wouldn't book one any sooner; have until August 2021 to pay or cancel without penalty. Yes, there is a demand for cruising, but a lot of potential customers are going to hold back until things settle and they get reports on what going on on board the ships. For numerous reasons I expect to hear some ""horror stories."""
"I find it hilarious that the negative posts fail to see that in 5 days up15%, last month 34%, six months 42%.. Those are nice returns for Longs and big losses for shorts. Those are facts.."
I was apprehensive of how reassuring the CEO was during these times...if they have so much cash for 12 months why borrow now at this interest rate? Something is not right
just out of curiosity has anyone else been asked to take part in the covid19 vaccine trial? offering from $700 to $1200. And if so would you do it?...for how much?
Saudis just invested large in LYV. Live nation. CCL does bookings through them. Saudis know something.
"Buy now while it’s still cheap, these low prices we be going up faster than you think."
"last 2 weeks, CCL dropped 70%. institutional investors know it is a severely undervalued pearl. They rush to buy at current bargain and hold. That is why when market was down today, CCL is going up. it will go up more next week. Even it recovers to $20, it is still a bargain with huge potential to go up."
Woah! What was the catalyst for this 9% rise? Can't find it?
"SHORTS, how low is CCL going to get? I'm thinking that I should sell today before the big Crash you speak of!NOT! CCL $42 BY 6/1/21!"
Gonna run today!!!!
"I attribute a majority of today's losses to Fauci's trying to scare the SHEEP about reopening to soon, which will be ammo for CDC to further delay the cruise restart! It's being proven in Europe & Asia that cruising can be done safely, even without vaccines! Also, the CDC is allowing people to be crammed in retail stores, airports, airplanes, casino's, bars etc...., but won't let cruise lines sail (w/their protocols, it would be safer than other leisure activities)! The current administrations Enviro Wacko's view cruise lines at polluters and evil; they are going to drag their feet on allowing cruising in an attempt to bankrupt them! It's time for the cruise lines and the attorney general's from FL, TX, LA to suite the heck out of the CDC!!!!"
"CCL stay long , cruising will open soon! The shorts are going to get crushed!CCL stock will become a huge money maker SOON. Jg"
"Somewhere in here I read a bout a quick test from iAbra, then I found this. ""Before iAbra changes the world, it has to prove its product’s reliability, which has not yet received any external regulatory validation. Nor does there seem to have been any oversight of the underlying data for the company’s claims for the test’s accuracy.""On the other hand, SRNE has a test currently under FDA review, and hopefully will approved soon- thereby helping us to bring the sea and the sun back together and raise CCL stock!(Full disclosure: I own SRNE and CCL, though I'm new to CCL)"
"In the next few months. All of the cruise lines will decide whether to exploit their customers or not. There are a large number of booked passengers who would just rather not cruise right now.......and won’t. They will pay the cancellation penalty, and the cruise line will rebook their cabins and make a tremendous profit. Again, I think the first cruise line to waive cancellation penalties for any cruises for the next 2 months will win. That’s the line I would switch to. :-)"
I have 10000 share at 16$
Further upgrade by Argus to buy!
"Seeing the options action since Monday this week, this was expected. Best time to short is tomorrow afternoon."
July 4th CDC will allow cruising. Watch mad money tonight with Norwegian Cruises CEO.
From $16 to $12 just in 5 days. Let that sink in folks thats how you short a stock and make money. 
"Mentioned few weeks back..i ve stuck 6 months in this baby with a huge (-) P&L..luckily am out..leave aside wishful thinking..the cash burn for the last 1,5 yrs is immense and will take long years to recover the financial stability..add the loss of fleet on top and still no sail order...tough cookie..I shall consider to jump back around 20.."
I see a lot of shorts spreading fear into this board. I feel you guys i know you didn't expect that the market is going to rebound quickly. Im sure your aware that the CV is on a downtrend now.convincing the longs to go short and hoping to cover your losses is not gonna work. The market is going to recover quickly than you expected. people are going to rejoice that the cv is under control and your toast
I see Sally is upset with the valuation by MC analyst at $5 a share 
Way oversold. This once again is the strongest Cruise Line on every metric and is President Trumps favorite Company in the Country. It's a bargain here.
"I'll try to help you all out. Here are the facts. As of March 31, 2021. Cash Balance - $3.6 Billion. Lossing approx $500 month. Now selling till at least July - $2 Billion more gone. Now cash balance is $1.6. As June - 352 Million debt is matured, Sept another $488. See the math? Management can't wait until the last minute. My point...more debt coming on. You thought 11.75% was high...just watch!"
4.83 next year's earnings and paying out $2 per share? That's less than 50% of its cash flow. Dividend is totally safe. That's why I bought more today. A bank isn't gonna give you a 4.35% CD rate and I don't see CCL dropping under 40. Im catching the boat before it sails away
All my price targets hit we broke resistance so I’m thinking lower
Kicking myself I didn’t jump when this touched 18. I will keep an eye to see if it hits 22 and then I am scooping it up! If it never does that bless you all that have it! Good luck!
"Seeing today's performance, I think that even the most loyal long will say to himself that it's time to let go of this stock"
guys im long on CCLdo i buy more shares at 14.20 or I wait
"guys too much market manipulation don't believe every news and suddenly sell your stocks so cheap! Real value $50-60, be long and strong. it's a $6 billion revenue every quarter business. nobody will le them bankruptcy. don't beleive the news cruses are canceled whole year of 2021."
I say easy call that cruise lines announce another delay to end of June - They keep around a 3-month window so that they minimize the amount of deposit refunds when CCL has to cancel vs. guests decide not to pay the full fare 90 days or so before departure and then they have the standard penalty (for those bookings made prior to coronavirus hitting). Which Bulls want to be on record to say we will see cruises in June?
Looks like some more Major Pensions are accumulating CCL today!
Still a lot of resistance @30$. Lets see if we can blow through that on high volume.
Many upcoming positive catalyst's to shoot CCL into the mid to upper $30's next month!
$30 by Friday close? Gigem!

SHORTY SHORT McSHORY!!!!!!!
"Good morning Carnival Cruise Line investors. While reading this message board you will notice that there are a few people that are major short position players. They are also believed to have other aliases and will post using them all by flip flopping back and forth from one alias to another.Known shorts on this board for reference by aliases are @Issay AKA @Bill, (changes alias back and forth) and is the one who does most of all the article posting @Harry Bawls AKA @Ilostmybawls, @David (short one) @Paul45, @Lancer, @kevinThere are a few more but the ones above are the ones you will usually see post most of the time.Although everyone is entitled to their own opinions, these specific people will do anything in their power to provide this board with only negative information about CCL. They will talk about imminent bankruptcy, bloodbaths, never again to sail and quite a bit of other negative information. Some will bombard this board with a barrage of postings of cut and paste articles all day long while posting incomplete articles and only post sections that are negative in those articles. In addition, those articles are never dated, and many are old and recycled articles that have been posted on this board on many other occasions. We have CCL bashers; paid posters, totally untruthful people and certain ones who will flip flop their position to make you think they are on your side and then switch positions and then always turn rude when they have taken a short position.You will also find that on days CCL is green they are usually nowhere to be found but on negative days they will come out in packs like circling wolves on a kill with their garbage and taunting posts. The closer CCL gets to being red on the day, the nastier they usually become.Unfortunately, they have driven many real investors away from this board that were helpful and provided real information and knowledge.I urge you to not take their information as fact. Do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. Please feel free mute them to keep the integrity of this board intact if you find them to be too much."
I think Chuck might have had a heart attack and died. He has no posts in 10 hours. Normally there would be about 75 posts in that time frame. RIP Chuck!
The most recent vaccine news is very promising. J&J’s single shot can be stored in a regular refrigerator. Do your own research. Cruising will be back probably sooner than we think. I’m long CCL.
My wife and I have a Mexico cruise booked for March. My wife is getting frightened and may not want to go......which means we won’t go. We take 2 cruises per year on Princess and have for years. CCL is quickly coming up on their “Tylenol Moment”. They really should waive their cancellation penalties for all upcoming cruises to anywhere. :-)

The CDC has no valid reason to disallow cruising when they are allowing casinos, bars, resorts, airlines, airports, sports venues, restaurants, retail stores, clubs, schools, routine BLM/Antifa protests, and releasing covid positive illegal aliens into the USA! Their stance on cruise lines conflicts with their stance on all other industries! The cruise industry is the only industry not being allowed to operate which is causing thousands of job losses, billions of losses by the cruise lines, and billions of losses in economic activity in the states that have cruise ports! I suspect the current administration and the CDC are being POLITICAL and view cruise lines as POLLUTERS, and they see an excellent opportunity to inflict as much financial damage to their disliked industry as possible, all in the name of public health! They are clearly dragging their feet! I contacted my representatives yesterday, and it only took 5-10 minutes from their website contact portal! It's time to take the gloves off! The cruise lines, as well as the State Attorney Generals from FL, TX, AK, LA, should take immediate legal action against the CDC!"
CCL is share for 100% jumpIn June the world will be without Corona or better to say with control and vaccine in hand.The demand for cruises will be huge. People with money or without money that take loan for vacation. My estimation - from coming June 2021 the demand for cruises will pick and CCL will be at least $36 which is 100% from now. I bought nice quantity of shares and hold
"States can open tomorrow. Life could go normal and we can see markets going up Buy now, still cheap"
"Due to the relentless C-19, CCL will soon go bankrupt. This epidemic has never gone away"
"Hold on shorts, we are at the final stage. FOMO...They will remove the fake floor soon.See you at $20."
Next leg up starts tomorrow! Keep your chin up CCL faithful!
UK told they can book summer holidays with confidence as bookings surge.
Added @ $8.66 ... Today's volume indicates capitulation.There will be less dilution since capital increase has been reduced because of the successful bond offering that was increased. The selling pressure was coming from the convertible traders.I expect a rebound tomorrow to $12.
"Seen it so many times, the way it’s trading it’s being propped to let big money out then dilution news when markets are closed. Watch and see"
"Yes, I would say that investors in CCL should feel quite confident in their choice. Top management surely must have confidence during this time of uncharted water. Not to worry just because CCL's CEO, CFO and CAO were selling shares and the CCO is exercising Options.. I'm sure there is smooth sailing ahead. AHOY!"
Yeah CCL knows one way from here....UPCCL = STRONG BUY!
"Charts:- nice bull flag forming, plus we retested last breakout and are now going higher, Think we see $30 before next weeks earnings report."
ALL ABOARD!!!
Carnival is up 6.80% to 26.83
The pool of shorts.....CCL = $$$$$
I put my money in various cruise lines and felt the burn when norwegian sold more stock to keep running. I don't know how much more we can take.
Hello Ralph and John lol
$CCL $NCLH $RCL. The great cruise comeback begins! https://nclembark.com/
Travel & Leisure stocks are undervalued and oversold from yesterday indeed
Oh boy ...
This could just get really funny.
"this stock will be $90 for sure eventually some months later, but this time is not that time, there are more and more COVID deaths, more people getting infected all over the world, if it stays above $24.50 I would be happy and more when it does a quick run to $30 and plummets again to $24.50, I have been watching this stock for the last two months and this has been the story."
Today put option volume is quite large.
"I did purchase carnival today. But I also loaded up on Aurora cannabis because I feel like they’ll be part of another merger that sends the sector soaring. If the CDC has a change of heart, you won’t be able to buy enough carnival."
"For every person that is excited to return to a cruise ship , there is another person who has no desire to return. Take your own survey and see for yourself as 2020 has changed everything including the way we will vacation."
50% retracement or more? Going to need to raise more money. 2 years without income is some insane cash burn for these big companies.
back to 18 soon
Everyone take a moment of silence for Christopher’s margin debt right now. 
$23 at closing today
The new CDC Director’s rant of impending doom doesn’t give me much confidence that the travel ban will be lifted anytime soon. I fear they make decisions based on politics and not science.
All short trader posted bad comments about traveling stock but they are hungering to travel by summer. LOL
"Hey David, I'm up almost 40c. Take profit or stay greedy?I'm sport David. I would like a winner for tomorrow (It's not BILL, is it? I made good money with with in the past)."
Just can’t get the shorts to smile.....guess they know CCL is going UP!CCL = STRONG BUY!
"Holding strong longs! Up 70% from lows, this one is a money maker!CCL = Buy now before $35"
"President and CEO of the Alaska Travel Industry Association, said in an email that there had been some early optimism for this summer thanks to pent-up demand and the start of vaccinations.""Many cruise lines had announced full sailing schedules for the summer, so we were hopeful we'd see a solid step toward recovery and many businesses would be able to stabilize,"" she said.Leonard said her group is working with Alaska's congressional delegation to come up with solutions to safely start cruising again, and it is seeking ""possible changes to complicated federal regulations"" so ships could sail between U.S. ports without a stop in Canada."
Why would CCL be up over 2% on a day when the the overall market is tanking? I thought the Shorts said that it was immediate DOOM for CCL Longs!
Ok it’s about to tank ready shorts 27.20 let’s go
"2235 shares at $19.00 eachcould be worse like $20+, im happy with my $19 position."
"LONGS, BE CAUTIOUSI have been long all month and it was not that easy as you know.I was reading an interesting post on Twitter about valuation.Stock under normal conditions trades @ $40.Dilution from capital increase and convertible issue is around 25% so it brings us to $30.Cash burn is around $1.2/share/month,assuming they will be back to normal in September (sailing ban ends on July 24th but they have suspended some of their cruises already til September) so it brings us to $24.Then you have possible lawsuits, refunds with higher credit, lower pricing for next cruises (10% lower).Then you can imagine that their boats won't be full in September.All this warrants another 20% discount til year end.Which brings us to $20.UBS has a target price @ $16JPM (the bank that advised them on the liquidity actions) @ $13Me personally if it goes to $20, I am out and will wait for a pullback to buy back.Your thoughts are welcome (in a polite manner of course)"
"ALL ABOARRRRRRD! Ron DeSantis says we'll load the next death ship to nowhere if we want to. I just want to go back to work! Are republicans working with or against corporate America? DeSantis crowd about putting people back to work not locking them up inside. Tourism is Florida's lifeblood, but the governor made it political."
"Once we are done with ""bargain hunters"", it will slowly drift down. Watch for large lots exiting...."
"Trump said cruise lines must register in the US, pay US income taxes, and following US employment laws in order to even look at US assistance."
First lot hit target. Thank you longs. Will ride the second lot all the way down to $22
"Before we even knew what Covid-19 is, CCL was in a steady decline from low seventies in JAN 2018 to upper forties in DEC 2019. That's during their peak business & the heights of the economy. And now, with all the debt, share dilutions, no sailing and if any, with half the ships at half their capacity, Covid cases & high unemployment, do you really think this will bounce back to $50??If you are too emotionally attached to ANY stock & refuse to look at the facts & writings on the wall, then you need to just move on & play BINGO."
sell on the news is this weeks mantra
All aboard!!!
"At the end of the day, there is light at the end of the tunnel with vaccines and distribution looming. So the more cruise lines sell off, the more attractive they will be."
"If 3500 people get on a ship for 4-7 days and just 1 person gets or has COVID, does that mean that everyone onboard will have been exposed and have to quarantine? Serious question. I am long."
Just for Coffee!
"Carnival Corporation's Costa Cruises Brand to Restart Cruise Operations This WeekendSource: PR Newswire (US)MIAMI, Sept. 3, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Two cruise line brands from Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK), the world's largest cruise company, have announced plans to resume sailing operations, with Italy-based Costa Cruises scheduled to restart sailing in Italy this Sunday, Sept. 6, followed by Germany-based AIDA Cruises scheduled to resume on Nov. 1.The brands will begin in a gradual, phased-in manner with six initial ships and limited itineraries, becoming the first two of the company's nine global cruise line brands to resume operations. The initial cruises will take place with adjusted passenger capacity and enhanced health protocols developed with government and health authorities to follow shoreside mitigation guidelines.Costa Cruises is restarting sailing with two initial ships departing from Italian ports beginning Sept. 6. Costa Deliziosa will offer weekly cruises from Trieste on Sept. 6, 13, 20 and 27, visiting five destinations in southern Italy, including Bari and Brindisi in Puglia, Corigliano-Rossano in Calabria, and Siracusa and Catania in Sicily. Costa Diadema will follow on Sept. 19 from Genoa, calling at Italian ports in the western Mediterranean, including Civitavecchia/"
"Cruisehive reports that since TUI (part owned by RCL) restarted cruises in the canaries, 60,000 guests have been on their ships with only one incident of covid. This involved a family of 4 who were quickly identified last week and isolated before being taken off the ship. No other guests were affected. The reality is that there will be cases happening onboard the ships when they sail. As TUI Cruises has shown, with almost 60,000 passengers and only four infections, cruising is an inherently safe activity, provided the necessary measures have been taken and implemented.It shows that the Media is ever so fast to create a frenzy when the ships involved are a sizeable US-based company, Royal Caribbean. Yet, when the ships are a German-speaking company (part-owned by Royal Caribbean), the Media remains quiet. Therefore, the so-called petri dish culture onboard cruise ships seems to be nothing more than a media-induced hype."
"Jayy, I am unable to find shares to short Carnival.Waiting for a good entry point to short Norwegian. At this point, I would not go long with Norwegian, after todays news and since they filed with the SEC, that they may file bankruptcy. Ouch"
This feels like game over for the doomsayers. The battered travel industry will recover as will the stock prices. Airlines cruise lines retail hospitality gaming. Of the stocks were hammered up to 80% now they are all headed back up
A close up of our new camelKids named it Carnival.
Top Bullish Charts for October 2020  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"Looks like we are gaining some new interest finally with CCL which makes sense with last weeks tech pull backs. A couple things to think about if your new to this stock. Great price still-yes, still undervalued by 60% +.What will move this stock either direction in the next couple of days. Any news that CCL will purchase rapid testing. News pertaining to either the FDC lifting the port restrictions or delaying them further. Either would result in 15-30% incline or drop. News about the Italy cruises last week doing well/bad pertaining to containing Covid.I won’t mention BK bc that is out of the question and has been no matter what other might be saying I never saw that in the books. If the delays happen with either the port or vaccine than yes mayBe 6 months from now that could be in the works. -just something things to think about since I’ve been following this stock since Feb. my position is both long and short . Hope this was helpful ."
"Would be great if someone moderated these boards to keep the conversation about the stock at hand. If it isn’t about CCL, go somewhere else"
"UPGRADE ALERT! (Posted now)Yangshi Yu is the Vice President at Macquarie Group. Could that other unknown analyst, Charles Yu, be related to him? If anyone has more info about this analyst please share it here. I'm curious about his rate of success or how many ratings he has under his belt."
All cruise lines down 5%. This requires a sec investigation into stock price manipulation.
About over for this Monday and it was a lot of fun.
"My Holland America agent told me yesterday that they were real busy rebooking China cruises - I should have listened to this information and sold out. Still, a $4 drop this pre-market seems to be a bit overdone IMO, especially since we are already down over $4 over past 2 weeks. Time to buy more IMO."
Well since all the bad news that can possibly come out did so already. Can those that have no relevant information stop posting. Just makes you look desperate  Posted that before but apperently some ppl just got too much wax in their ears.
"Buy when others fear, this stock will rise faster than it went down."
Yes Andy and that move is FANTASTIC pr move......people will be thinking of floating hospitals and not contaminated ships.....very smart move by the company.
you know its a great sign when insiders are buying millions of shares. That means they believe in the future of the company. An insider would not buy any shares if the company was going bankrupt. They have a good news coming hence why they are buying millions of shares right now. Its better to get in now so you can easily double your money in couple weeks
"GUYS, CCL & NCLH are breaking out and $40 is in sight. SOON, sorry shorts."
"SOUTHAMPTON, England, Dec. 9, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Cunard, a part of Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK), the world's largest cruise company, announced today it has extended its pause in operations due to the ongoing travel constraints in place across the world.Voyages departing on board Queen Mary 2 up to and including May 28, 2021, and on board Queen Elizabeth up to and including June 4, 2021, are now cancelled. Departures on Queen Victoria remain unaffected and are scheduled to resume May 17, 2021.Guests who have had their voyage cancelled will automatically receive a 125% Future Cruise Credit, providing an additional 25% on any monies paid, to redeem against a future voyage.The 125% Future Cruise Credit can be used on any new booking made by the end of December 2021 and on any voyage available at the time of booking. Voyages are currently available through to early 2023."
No testing required for vaccinated cruisers….non vaccinated Antigen test ok.
"In 1 and a half years, people will be going back to healthy ways. curry this is a company with no cash flow"
"We are getting biased news out there. For example instead of saying CArnival starts again by June, they say it in a negative way “they canceled everything till jun”. This is indirectly manipulating the price"
The good TSA data will boost up CCL this week and a decent short squeeze will help CCL get $30 this week.
Up $1.30 pre market....yea baby
DROPED SOO MUCH
This is soon going to be very funny.
"Any goods news and this stock will go over $22 in one day. You'll never know the future, no one knows.All I know about this company they have the most cruise ships and also they have enough money to go with zero revenue for the next 11 months.There are a lot of people would love to go on cruise ship after long lockdown. 2021 booking looks goodand we are only half way to 2021, 6 months to 2021. It's not that bad. They can make the loss once they are to business and they will in 2021."
"These are the facts and you can speculate to your hearts content. I am bullish long term, but short term very bearish,1. Earnings were pushed out for a reason. They are bad and they need to try to find a way to spin it.2. Their first ships that sail have to pass strict environmental investigations 60-days prior to sailing.3. Everyone involved will need to be vaccinated. Onboard crew come from impoverished countries that do not have the vaccine. They will be at the bottom of distribution in industrialized countries. This puts most crew out until late Summer for vaccination. All port personnel and terminal personal will need vaccination. This puts them out until May in most cases.4. Protocols in place for covid free sailing has failed. They will need to announce new testing and protocols to prevent it which they can't do. Their only option is make vaccination a requirement. I think the CDC will mandate that in order to open ports.5. The first sailings that will start in May at the earliest will still be at 33-50% capacity. This will be the case for the first 4-8 weeks. This will also be on about 4 total ships instead of ~12. The others slowly get phased in. 6. The only ports that will be open in 2021 are Port Canaveral and Miami. That limits the total number of ships that can sail to less than half their US fleet."
$40 will be eminent! Let’s go April 
$CCL $RCL Said absolutely no fully vaccinated cruises on CNBC. Losing 1Bn a month. Bad news
Mention reddit cruise .Strong buy ccl rcl norwegian
"options expired, this is gonna run next week. buckle up people.Have a great weekend longs :)"
"Harry, do you not understand graphs and support levels. One NCLH and CCL crossed $20 they never looked back.. All 3 cruise sticks are setting higher highs and higher lows.. I wish more intelligent people would post. Guy and Santam say ""bankruptcy, stock will go to $1, etc"". When all they've done is jump 50% since July. These are facts.."
"They couldn't pay me to go on a cruise ship right now, to just get quarantined?? Doesn't make sense"
SHORTY McFLY: CCL continues to climb because it’s going to $65! More vaccines administered will FORCE lifting of CSO. Your stupid to not recognize this...hence the gif.....
"Look at their balance sheet : 8 billion cash with 24 billion debt,500 million cash burning every month and all the good news about vaccine is already priced in. Run and bag the cash before it's too late. (Also they have sold their 3 ships during the last quarter which means that the net margin will be low even the cruise began to operate 'normal'."
Will see $40 by summer
No real action that will affect buyers or sellers for the rest of the year. The key decision makers in companies & investment firms are all enjoying an extended Holiday. Relax & take a deep breath...
Just bought this last Friday at the highest price . I’m so sad
"A Federal Judge ruled on Wednesday that Carnival Corporation must certify each of its ships are environmentally compliant at least 30 days before resuming service in the United States, according to a court order."
I wonder how wrong Christopher will be today? Or even if he will show face??
Benzinga reporting unusual options activity on CCL today causing a drop and options alert. High volumes of unsettled contracts traded.
It’s coming back. Calm down
"shorting at this level is the equivalent of answering a maths question a few months after the teacher has told you the answer. Yes the situation is bad, yes cruises cant sail...this is why the price dropped soo much... you dont make money being late..."
"CCL just pulled in the staging lanes , it’s doing it’s burn out fixing to take off!!!!"
"so the FL / Tx / AK vs. CDC hearing is at 9am EST May 12th. Judge Steven Merryday is a 71 year old Florida native, republican appointed by Bush Sr. in 1991. anyone's guess how he's gonna rule in favor of? and only 22k reported covid cases yesterday. shorts are about to lose a LOT..,"
"I am still losing $$$ here so many of you but congrats to folks who bought CCL MGM NCLH RCL DAL UAL DAL AAL, etc yesterday at the solid bottom. Short covering will last through next week of May!!! IMO"
Bookings might be climbing but at what cost? They are giving cruises away for nothing. What they are saying is misleading.
"CCL is going Bankrupt next year. The company will survive, ships will sail but the share holders will not. Ya'll know it, just look at the numbers. Bearish on the stockBearish on the investorsNeutral on CCL corporation post bankruptcy."
Charts:- Another resistance level here mostly on the weekly. Ichimoku cloud sits at $29.94 also 200 weekly sma sits at @$30.80. A nice break through them on heavy volume would be setting us up to have support @$30 and also could see us run to $33-$39.Downside maybe a drop to $28.50ish to lower RSI and then run past this Resistance.Good Luck Longs.....
back to 15 during earnings
"If the vaccines are approved and deployed faster, ccl will sail sooner."
"I'm back in the game, let's go boys!"
have a strong feeling this is going to start tanking come Monday... even as soon as today before the close. sold half yesterday... thinking about selling the rest today unless I see something soon that convinces me otherwise
COVID infection in the USA is dropping like a rock.
"Time to cruise now, cdc should have its budget cut by 95% to see what it’s like. Unaccountable bureaucrats on a power trip=cdc."
"Look at the graph, it’s easy, Carnival isn’t going anywhere. This stock price won’t last long fellas, either you’re in or out, but I’m not scared, it’s common sense. Too big to fail."
Sell on newsBuy on rumorTrend is still upWill be over $30 next week
"Stop and think of the last 60 days of vaccinations, CCL at $18. Now think what the next 60 days will look like. BUY THIS STOCK WITH EVERY PENNY YOU HAVE! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!! EASY $40 BUY BUY BUY!"
"If you were short, would you cover by the end of day or risk more good news coming out over the weekend? Think there will be a violent up move some time today, probably late."
Too bad most people wont have the money to travel especially amidst rising inflation.

One single analysts issues a crazy price target based on wild speculation while most analysts still have a price target of mid 20’s and much higher.... many other articles explain cruise lines have plenty of ways to conserve cash during this time... CCL can go at least 6 months with no revenue and survive on cash on hand plus their 3 billion credit facility....
"Bad day I say and why did I let you all talk me into buying this CCL for ? Any thoughts, any thang to say, do you feel guilty, or just may be ashamed for doing dear ole' Johnny like that."
Ok shorts we have a very nice set up for tomorrow we will bank $$$$$ 26 below cash out

Crazy. Why would the stock pop this morning when CDC will require 95% of passengers to be vaccinated?
bookings for the fall and winter are thru the roof love this!
"Like I’ve said few days ago... $Carnivl This coming week will be very interesting. I think we will see some up trend action. Every last week of the month we have been exploding (3/24 - 3/26) and (4/27 - 4/30). I would not be surprised to see the same action and hitting around $16 - $19 this coming week (5/26 - 5/28). On 3/27 and 5/1, it has been dropping. So 5/29 could be descending day. (Yes, Friday are sell off day ) If that doesnt happen, we could see the moves on first week of the June. (6/1 - 6/4).I could definitely be wrong, but it has been a trend. Overall, very unpredictable market.. but we are hearing and seeing some good news about booking, opening in August, vaccine, states opening phase 2, and etc."
"Hey guys, what's funnier than 24?25 B)"
"Cruise demand shown to be strong as Oceania Cruises’ 180-day world cruise for 2023 sells out in one day. A third of the bookings came from people who hadn’t sailed with the brand before and one in five guests extended their voyage to 218 days. Fares began at £38,059pp."
Can anyone justify why they are buying shares in this company? Please don't say the vaccine is going to save them!
Futures up! Let’s gooo!!
"small and medium block purchases still more than sells, It's just taking a breather. MM's accumulating here. Nice action to see actually. :) no-one is heavy selling and it's being bought at all the dips and Fibonacci levels, It will run again soon."
Not nice UBS... not Nice!
"I would cruise before getting on this plane any day. Part of the article says, ""But as the nation starts to reopen, airline traffic is starting to pick up and there is more pressure to fill middle seats.""https://www.msn.com/en-us/travel/news/packed-united-flight-leaves-passengers-scared-shocked-amid-fears-of-the-coronavirus/ar-BB13STs0?ocid=spartanntp"
"The ""Me too"" movement has officially moved to the cruise companies! None of these companies are making money & they keep postponing sail dates further & further in the future. One company after the other is borrowing more & more money or selling more & more shares. The writing is on the wall but many shareholders keep dismissing all that & prefer to bury their heads in the sand!"
"@Keith I have 6000 shares I shorted just before close for tomorrow only with limited downside risk. Profit taking has to commence for at least one session.

"This is a great stock to be for the long run, it’s going to rise back up like most stocks, it just needs time, buy it will, buy now when it’s cheaper."
So...the volume picked up to over 50 million shares traded and CCL went from down 80 cents to only down 13 at the closing. Very strong finish. Up in the AH.

"It’s amazing people are still buying at this level when there are so many options out there.The fact is yes, cruising will return, eventually. That being said, Carnival has taken on billions on billions of debt, with huge interest. They have diluted the value of the company and there is no dividend... there is no good reason to buy this stock. Even if cruising levels were back to pre-Covid, the debt ratio is insane, the value is no where close to what it was.LNG is replacing coal in every applicable situation and market reports consumption is expected to increase yearly through 2040. GLOP, $3.50 a share right now, dividend will earn you revenue.MFA, survived the Covid crisis and already raising dividends, making you money. $3.75 a share.Those are just a couple that I own. Not saying to buy what I have, I’m just saying be smart with your money.Covid created an amazing buying opportunity with hundreds of stocks taking a hit. Stocks that haven’t taken billions in debt and will actually give you a return on your money.Sooo many.Don’t waste your money here folks.Good luck to all.."

Don’t understand if this had 2 upgrades in the last 2 days. Why volume is so low. Either picking up cheap shares now or had already accumulated and were just trying to pump it. Either way looking weak atm.
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Fairstox.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"Also Saw SWN on Wall Street bets last night , said short interest @33m +shares would start to cover after Goldman Sachs upgrade and price target hikes.."
She’s a beauty.....CCL = Strong Buy!!!
"Holding since last year at this time, just a matter of time before the are back in the big $$$. If there's one thing people love it's cheap booze and buffets LOL! GLTA"
$30 eminent
"Yesterday, here in California, people were in line at 3 am to get into a re-opening casino. People can’t wait to start doing fun things again. Cruising is one of those things. There will not be a shortage of passengers once the ships begin sailing. I’m getting a few emails a week from Carnival with great offers. Vaccine and cures will be flooding the market before you know it. Too many billions of dollars to be made so there will be multiple companies in the game."
Do not short this!!! You’ll thank me later
"The MS Westerdam, which has more than 2,000 people on board, has now been denied entry by at least four different ports over fears of the Wuhan coronavirus.The Philippines and Taiwan announced closure of their ports to cruise ships due to the fear of coronavirusserious issues for the whole cruise industry"
Oil will start to come down so CCL will have no more excuses going forward. This is a good time to add. I think the numbers are too low now and a beat is in the cards next 2 quarters.
"Need I speak of the absolute genius of The CRUISE Act...no, it’s speaks for itself."
At what price would you sell your CCL stocks ? I'll do it at 40$
"A lot of people here keep asking about ccl cash and bankruptcy. So here are the facts, that anyone can check:-CCL has enough cash to stay alive for the next 12 months-People already make a lot of bookings for 2021 -The cruise industry is blowing up in the last 5-10 years and its not going anywhere-The virus won't last longer than summer 2020, many countries already started easing restrictions- CCL burns 500m monthly - CCL has 6B for staying aliveso now if you still think they will go bankrupt, ask yourself: ""Are we really gonna do this whole home quarantine for the next 12 months?"" In conclusion im NOT saying BUY IN NOW, im saying in long term we can see a recovery for ccl to at least $30 as soon as we contain the virus. As soon as its over people will start buying those cruise stocks like its free gold. We might hover $10-$14 for some time but as soon some big news come out we will sky rocket on this one."
Let's consider the consumer more often then not boomers and above as far as demographics. There aren't allot of youth that use these cruises this means it's a dying business model.
I’ll buy 500 more shares to make 1000
"The “surge” isn’t real. A 7% increase on 55,000 cases is not a very large amount when speaking in terms of the whole United States. The CDC wants to push down prices one last time so all their buddies can get a good position."
More good news coming out in 1 hour!!!!
We should test 25.40 today down trend will continue for a few weeks
A TIDAL WAVE of CCL BUY recommendations should begin next week! Rocket Launch commence!
"Tommorow we see a dip.....although expected losses... but will cause a dip. I believe the pain is baked in. However, it the future bookings that will make that dip recover quickly. I'll be ready for that dip. jmho. GLTA"
"FOMO mom's couch millionaires pumping this garbage is cracking me up. Look, I can play analyst too. Forget 110%. I predict a 250% increase. Probably gonna take 5 years but I predict that. I love it. Any bit of nonsense they can put out to drive it up a few bucks to pump and dump and all you suckers buying over $20 are falling for it. I also predict earnings out this afternoon. No way were they gonna put out such dismal numbers yesterday, on a Thursday and watch it sink. They'll sneak it out this afternoon after closing bell with the hopes of some motleytard stamping out another bogus article over the weekend with a fake pump in an effort to keep it from dropping to its true value. Mark my words people. Earnings will come out today. They will be horrible ( to no fault of #$%$ just is what it is right now). And some analyst will put out their prediction of ""bookings to break records in 2025. or CDC to open cruising in North America soon, or some other obvious post that will come to fruition but years from now"" that will help bounce the sell off Monday back up to unjustified price. Better to wait until this tanks down around $20 again to buy in. You've been enlightened."
Smart money waits for restructuring which is inevitable. Company's in a 'Sea of Debt'.
Airline data points indicate faster than expected bounce back for the travel industry. Higher tomorrow!
"CDC's no sail order is very ambiguous. It says it's in place until Sep 30th. It does not say that it's in place until 11.59 on September 30th, not does it say until the end of September 30th. So does this thing expire in a tonight or tomorrow???"
Those converted shares from the last 2 dilution deal will flood the market next week. That’s over 400 million shares. If you see a spike in volume next week then you’ll know what it is. Good luck everyone have a good weekend
CDC just denied Carnival Cruise request
@Lancer I have 5 now. CCL will be making it 6 very shortly. Today alone will make the down payment.
Royal Caribbean just announced cruises starting again as early as March 24 on their website. I’m sure Carnival is right behind them!
"Don’t believe @David. I don’t post bad articles about CCL or trash it. I just personally don’t think a company with $26 B debt, huge dilution and no REVs insight is worth $28..Good Luck!"
$CCL $RCL $NCLH $UAL $DAL Wouldn’t want to mess with today’s market rally or this week for that matter.
"I wish ccl could have waited another week before doing the raise.Italy and Spain's curve has flattened and going down.Stock price will soar, look at the futures."
After hours market makers filled so many 27.82 orders. the bid was 27.88 ask 27.90
"Ok Kobi, Let's think calmly: hurricane season will start soon, Covid vaccine won't be ready for next 6-7months (at good wish), plus another winter flu season starts from November 2020 though Feb 2021, how could CCL/RCL/NCLH sail again? No sailing then no income, then stock will be punished..... go figure"
"CCL expected loss per share -1.52...actual? -3.30!!!!!Forget $15, we can scoop up shares for $12 or less today"
DONT LISTEN TO BRUCE H...HE BOUGHT SOME PUT CALLS AND NOW PANICKING....CCL JUST STARTED SAILING AGAIN. PRICE WILL UP
"Carnival has so far about $$$26 billion in debt and growing. At this rate, debt will pass the $$$30 billion in a matter of 3 months. By the time they resume sailing the debt will grow to $$$35 billion. It will take them some 15 years to pay off this debt and that's under normal conditions at full capacity. Go see for yourself. This information is available if you search it."
Oil down CCL down. Good time to get in? Its almost at a 52 week low.
CCL is ELECTRIFYING!CCL = BUY BUY BUY
"Carnival upgraded to Outperform from Neutral at Credit SuisseCredit Suisse analyst Benjamin Chaiken upgraded Carnival to Outperform from Neutral with a price target of $40, up from $18. It looks ""increasingly likely"" that a mid- to late-summer restart for cruises is ""reasonable,"" Chaiken tells investors in a research note. The ""event path seems to be pivoting,"" which should lead to more positive sentiment in the group, says the analyst. He believes Carnival's disposal of 19 ships will drive better unit economics than the Street is modeling."
When I bought this a year ago people said ccl is going under. Here we are a year later. My biggest regret I didn’t buy even more!
"Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, Chief Financial Officer David Bernstein, and Arnaldo Perez, the cruise line’s general counsel, sold a total of $2.7 million of stock."
im in... 15.9
"Carnival is still buying back shares everyday. Last Summer, CCL was buying 100,000 shares a day, but lowered share repurchases to 50,000 a day. Why the change? My theory is that they were unable to buy 100,000 a day unless they bid up the price. the blocks of shares that they are purchasing are on the smaller side. No big blocksseem to have come up for sale, (at least as Carnival is concerned). This tells me that the Carnival stock priceis solidly dragging the ""bottom""."
The vaccine won't do anything because the Dems and liberal press are fixed on setting fear in the hearts and minds of the American people. The earliest the cruise industry will start seeing the light of day is Nov 5th.
"Longs must be in shock. They saw the futures last night and this morning and were sure that CCL will spike today. With J&J and stimulus, huge demand and people booking every possible cruise, longs were sure that that's it, that today is the day to go the moon. Instead, stock ends up in red with 60M shares sold. It seems that between dreams and reality, the latter won. This company is drowning in debt. Covid is far from over. No Alaska cruising. No cruising this year. Even if they manage to cruise this year, it will be limited. It will take Carnival many many many years to recover. That's the reality. Today, smart investors voted to move to other better stocks and let the dreamers hold and wait 10 years for the recovery."
Shorts losing upwards 7 digits soon after they find out what just happened
"Super LOW VOLUME day! The Calm before the STORM or for CCL, the LAUNCH to the MOON! This was dedicated to Shorty McShorters!"
Discount at this price...

"Buy and hold as much as you can, this stock is going to bounce back up!"
"If you are a ""long term"" long here I am sure you all know who @Harry Bawls, @Bree @Rico @Sally are.No need to comment them to encourage them."
They're going to have to raise more cash for sure. Pretty sure they're going to have to dilute you guys at least one more time. I already knew this but they made an official announcment. Reality going to sink in now.
"Too much optimism for a diluted, cash burning company. PT $22"
"The Covid-19 stimulus package will pass today and the stock market will go on a 2 week tear, resulting in a massive short squeeze across the board. My 2 week prediction for CCL is 24by end of next week and 27 by end of first week in January. Enjoy!"
don't sink with it
"I'm ready to get paid on this one (again). 25,000 shares deep. Let's party!"
"Huge buyer, sweeping up all the cheap shares pre market."
"carnival will never be the same... well, not until we get a reliable vaccine. I sold all my shares and am steering clear of all cruise stocks. for now at least"
Non stop share dilution and debt for this one
Ok shorts. You had your fun. It should bounce off $28 support.Today shorts will be the driver past $30. I see what you did there MM’s.
"there's gonna be a ton of new usernames posting here in the coming days and weeks. that's how you know things are about to take off! shorts: you should stick to the PTON and ZOOM plays from here on out, it's not gonna be good for you around here..."
Sell the news
All talks about BK and stuff like that are BS. As soon as virus vanishes (to be more exact as soon as Pandemia starts to deteriorate like it happening now China and S. Korea this stock will skyrocket. As soon as state of emergency is lifted CCL restores a business in a full swing momentarily. Many people planned their vacation but were scared by virus and still have an intention to have a rest. As for lawsuits - should they are filed it is going to be a government.
good morning all. chuck is back resuming his normal doom and gloom posts every 5 minutes aimed at saving us from ourselves.......lol
"One thing for sure, the cruise ships are well stocked to handle this innovative COVID test approach, sent by a friend:""A new and easy self-test for the horror of Covid 19 is doing the rounds and it's simple, quick and positive (or negative if you see what I mean). Take a glass and pour a decent dram of your favorite whisky into it; then see if you can smell it. If you can, then you are halfway there. Then drink it. If you can taste it then it is reasonable to assume you are currently free of the virus because the loss of the sense of smell and taste is a common symptom. I tested myself 7 times last night and was virus free every time thank goodness. I will have to test myself again today because I have developed a throbbing headache which can also be one of the symptoms. I'll report my results later. I have been testing myself for the last 5 months, morning, noon, and night. I use bourbon but have tried: scotch, Drambuie, gin, tequila, and vodka. Vodka will show positive as it has no taste, so I use it to clean my taste buds before taking a test."
"One shot vaccine, outpatient...cruisin here we come!"
Time to say hi-lo to a new short play for about five days
Why would anyone short this stock. Do they really think it is the end of the world because of a virus. I live near where the cruise ships dock and they are all spit shined and ready to go.
Buying in low 20’s let’s go
Going to fly up everyday
UK holiday bookings up by 600% as UK declares international travel allowed from May 17th.
anyone buying super heavy in the $42.50 range? these prices are steals
"If you are curious or want to learn a little bit more about $CCL, I made a video on it. I explained why I am bullish on it my time-frame. I also talked about a bunch of other travel stocks. Hope it helps!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UbPwdGi61c"
"Carnival have had two cruise ships infected. The Diamond Princess passengers that don't die get a full refund plus a trip credit similar to the booked trip. The Grand Princess passengers will likely get something similar. These two voyages were costly. Zero revenue and twice the costs, then liabilities and clean up costs. New sailings will be cancelled to save money. Pence will announce some changes to the industry later today. I expect a pause in the sailing schedule, some tax relief and backstop financing to reassure investors.The cruise companies have some work to do. A Canadian outfit had worked on a portable test lab for the zika virus which they have been funded to turn into a COVID 19 test lab. It can be used by less trained technicians, can produce fast results and can be used in remote areas. you can put one on every vessel.Cruise ships can be very safe if infections are found early. Have a swab and test program on every vessel and it will safer than staying home . Bankruptcy ...no, share price at bottom ????? I think lower but it may be getting close. If they announce some good cooperation between the companies and the Mike Pence team and cut the dividend early the share could stabilize and maybe go up....just my opinion ...what say yee do people see a pause in sailing"
SAFE TO SAY BYE BYE $15?
I am in long
Pre-market looking good. Markets depending 5-10% gain again today. Good luck.
"When Each Cruise Line is Scheduled to Resume Cruises in 2021""It is important to note that this schedule can and will likely change due to the fluid health pandemic"".https://cruisefever.net/when-each-cruise-line-is-scheduled-to-resume-cruises-in-2021/"
During the tech bubble in year 2000 it took 3 years for the stock market to decline 50% and reach its bottom. In 2008 financial crisis it took 2 years for the stock market to decline 57% and reach its bottom. How many years would it take for current pandemic/recession crisis for the stock market to reach the bottom from its high February 2020 date?
It seems odd that a company that is going to benefit greatly from the economy reopening would drop at all as we make huge strides vaccinating and getting back to normal. There is a huge pent up demand to get out and start cruising again.
One of the CCL Directors purchased 1.25 Million Shares at $8 for $10 Million Cash. Look at the 10k Form. This baby is going to rocket higher.
Imagine selling this when its going to be 40+ in a few months

This will end up at 27.81 and Monday if there’s no bad news we will power up.
Call me crazy but I will - assuming the world has not collapsed by summer - make reservation for my annual Christmas cruise in the Caribbean. I am very hopeful this tragedy (meaning Corona virus) will be over by Christmas. I am also positive by then the very fast Corona test has been developed for mass consumption and I am sure the cruise lines will consider it if it is ready and economical. I just hope Carnival will be very careful with their spending until then - since I don't want a chapter 11th situation and left with a huge loss
Why this was down today?
Green coming by end of day! More vaccines in the arms of Americans today...CDC will be FORCED to lift CSO!Get in NOW!
I repeat! Easy short term LONG trade for the JNJ vaccine.
CCL is heading up to pass 30 and fly to 34-38.
CDC chief is democrat. So they may well be traying to hurt Florida business because they are conservative and doing well. A well ran state.
Getting my vaccine shot tomorrow. Will finally feel a bit more comfortable!!!
Moving up. Let’s go Carnival.
"The Travel section in my Sunday newspaper mentioned that, due to popular demand, CCL added 22 more cruises to Cuba this year. More cruises, more revenue."
"BUY, BUY, BUY, BUY"
Thank you for your shares! Added some more to my position
CCL is on its way upward!! No stopping now. Heading to 35.00 to over 40.00 this summer!! Jg
Strong week ahead.
The bears will be running their mouths constantly until this reaches $31.
Do u guys believe that we already passed 11 &12 positions? That we wont see it again?
When you see this many people tearing a stock down right before the third friday. (Triple Witching) We all know whats gonna happen. This friday is the squeeze. The banks never loose!! $CCL $ RCL
I’d like to start a discussion: how likely is $CCL to survive until next winter without any revenue?
"Charts:- Hidden Bullish divergence. Bears have run out of steam and chart is back in the Bulls hand, expect this to make a run to near $30 this week."
Today was progress! NCLH was down.
"CCL upward blast!! Gathering lots of confidence, CDC could sport some great news on cruising dates soonjg"
CCL and other cruise lines have submitted the covid19 plans to CDC for approval.
"Jansen and Jansen vaccin (Johnson @ Johnson) als OK d by FDA. Good news. Also Sputnik vaccin will be distributed in Europe.(hungary, to begin with as they do not want to wait for permission EMA)I think we will be cruising sooner than we first expected. :)"
"Like I’ve said several months ago, and people refused to believe, that Cruise lines will not sail again until early 2021. This news just in, “ Cruise ships will not return to U.S. waters with passengers onboard until 2021, Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), announced Tuesday. The group has extended through Dec. 31 a voluntary suspension of U.S. operations that expired Saturday. CLIA includes Carnival Cruises, Disney Cruise Line, Norwegian Cruise Line and Royal Caribbean, and makes up 95 percent of the global cruising industry.” $CCL, $RCL"
Me laughing at every shorty crying that cruise and travel stocks are going to tank in the next few months.
"Could run away today, with pre-market being strong. Here's to a positive day"
Question...Moody's downgraded CCL (and the other cruise lines). Does anyone take Moodys serious anymore?
$130+ HERE WE COME!!! :))
"Singapore: It may take four to five weeks for the COVID-19 pandemic to end and the world to look to a post-COVID normal but that too with no uncertainties. ""At some point of time the pandemic will pass, but it may take four to five weeks before we finally see the end of the pandemic and the start of a post-COVID normal. What will this new post-COVID world look like? we all can tell,"" Right said."
"You are being spammed, I mean scammed. Anyway, CCL is about to pop. J&J vaccine news is not priced in yet. Next week should be great!"
"The FUTURE Forecast:July 4, 2021CCL $42! Cruisers that just left the port of Miami lounging by the pool on the Lido Deck, drinking a Miami Vice from the Red Frog Pub, & Eating a Guys Burger!"
No sail order expires on Sept 30th. Havnt heard them trying to extend. If CDC lifts No Sail Order then this suckaz gonna jump!! Already doing testing before boarding on there boats in Italy. No reported cases!!
guarantee this will go down at least $2 tomorrow. Earnings are gonna be real bad. Sell now and buy again on the dip.
"Wow, up over 2% after hours!"
"Bought at 16. Hold, sell, or buy more CCL?"
which is better? Carnival at 15 or Norwegian at 12? I'm thinking about swapping my norwegian shares for carnival who is bigger and probably will survive this
This whole COVID 19 will be gone before the end of summer. Shorts are buying into the fear. This will SKY ROCKET just on FOMO and SHORT COVERING> Stay strong.
Somebody who bought long in this in the last hour explain to me why? I genuinely want to know.
"Also earnings are on Wednesday, April 7, 2021, at 10 a.m. (EDT)"
"A GUY's Burger & a frozen Miami Vice from the Red Frog Rum Bar will hit the spot while lounging on the Liddo Deck come July 2021! Cheers! $42 by May 1, 2021!"
Booking a Carnival cruise for your entire family gatherings this Thanksgiving holiday would be fairly cheap.
"Charts:-Primary Target (short term):Bullish Pennant , confirmed (42%)PT = $37.80Secondary Target (Long term):Ascending Triangle , confirmed (99%)PT = $49.68"
"Lordy, up 44% from my first buy, up 80% from my last buy, in < one month! We don't no stinkin' tech stocks or IPO for those of gains, just buy when there's blood in the streets or corona on the boat. And some cajones helps too..."
This stock has no reason to be this high and imagine when cruises do start and there is an outbreak onboard
I'm new here but what's up with the Blind Optimism dude?
"$20 by Friday for sure, they just said no sailing until Nov  Just erased the best time for cruises"
"There we go. The potential is phenomenal. As I always said, a good news and we should be running back to what life used to be with a slight difference."
The upside has been decimated with dilution and bond sales. Now even the bonds are destined for zero value as they liquidate all the best assets just to make interest payments.
Anyone remember when most the airlines went bankrupt? Well isn't it possible this will happen in the cruise industry as well?
Small healthy rest. Accumulating energy to climb to $30 this week. Shorts still hang on. That is good news. A massive short squeeze will easily send CCL to moon.CDC will give a green light. The whole economy is reopened.
the judge hearing the case of FL vs. CDC on may 12 is 71 year old native Florida republican appointed by Bush Sr. how do you think that's gonna go for you @christopher?
Shorts are starting to cover
Let's hope they don't dilute more tomorrow...
This goes over $14.5 in AH
Bounced off 100 day sma. Very Bullish.
CCL will sail soon to the moon! CSO/NSO will be lifted in less than 30 days! Get in NOW before she goes to $65!
"I just bought more with this dip. Cruises are popular and in the long run will rebound. I just can't sit and watch it... buy, hold, walk away for a year...."
So if u sell they will buy
"Too many people think this is their ticket to get rich based off YouTube etc. I can name 10+ companies off the top of my head that will rebound much, much faster than a cruise stock if that’s your goal."
"Will the variants be resistant to current vaccine candidates? The possibility that the new variants will be resistant to existing vaccine candidates is low, but not “inexistent”, Dr Moncef Slaoui, chief science adviser for the US government’s vaccine distribution effort, said Sunday.Other researchers also say the mutations are not expected to be resistant to existing vaccine candidates, which will still protect against them. Unlike influenza viruses, the coronavirus evolves and mutates at a much slower rate.However, as more and more people get vaccinated, researchers expect the virus to evolve mutations that will help make it resistant to vaccines in the future."
Fully operational in July.
"Increase Liabilities from last quarter by $6 billion for new debt and deferred revenue and assets by $5 billion to account for $1 billion cash burn last quarter. Get a book value of equity $12 billion, over the increased number of common shares (850k) and a book valuation of $14.But book is a terrible way to value this stock because there is no outside market for cruise ships (especially not the largest fleet), the others are strapped and unlikely to buy, just as well to reduce capacity.You can't really consider this a growth stock.So you hope it is a cash cow, that will use its unique assets to generate dividends. But the 11.5% coupon on the new debt swallows up all the cash.I just' cant convince myself to buy at this price. Below $14 there is a weak argument on book value.Change my mind?"
It's totally normal for longs here to get upset when they hear that insiders are selling instead of buying. Or that cruises might return only in 2022.
"Found this article posted on etrade research. Price target is $17 and ""NOT bankruptcy candidate"" https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3070605&headline=ccl-stifel-cuts-carnival-target-to--says-not-bankruptcy-candidate"
"Nobody purposely talk down CCL which now has ratings of 9 strong buy, 6 buy, 8 hold,1 under performance and 0 sell. Average rating is 2.04 (1=strong buy, 2=buy,3=hold,4=under performance 5=sell). Look at the trends too, CCL only had 2 strong buy and 1 buy last month but now 9 strong buy and 6 buy."
JB will announce all adults in the USA will have access to vaccine this month. The epidemic is coming to an end in America!!!!
"""Returning to passenger cruising is a phased approach to mitigate the risk of spreading COVID-19. Details for the next phase of the CSO are currently under interagency review."" if anything this is a good sign that they are willing to change it, just clickbait to say they are ""keeping cruising restrictions until Nov 1"" typical journalist who forget to add the context to quotes."
"What cruise lines are NOT, tax based in the US? Thx in advance!"
Double bottom and super high volume today. Might be the long term bottom.
"Good Luck gang, out for a bit."
"Glad I got more at $11, still my average is waaay high at $29. Was at $40 before corona"
"I don't see how this won't go up in the second half of the year. Completely full flights when I am looking online at vacations. Travel demand is still strong, and cruises are going to come back fast as soon as they are allowed."
Friday is the conference Day!!!Watch out for the bull run!!
"Buy when it’s still cheap, this is a temporary dip, look at the market conditions and then look at the pattern, it is going to bounce back up mid week, very typical trend, royal Caribbean is doing the same pattern. Buy and hold, easy money."
"CCL is low. When COVID passes through and runs its course, people will be booking like crazy with pent up demand wanting to get away. Cruising is truly a total vacation package all in one especially with young kids. I see CCL a bargain right now getting back up in the 50's by summer 2021. How many of you remember what happened with the cruise lines right after 911 Sept 2001 and the few months thereafter? Same thing going on now. Buy 2-3k shares and forget about it until next summer. You will have earned a nice return."
Buy!! New cdc rules coming! We starting back up very soon. Price increase more money more people. Buy going to 120$ by the end of year.
"Over 2M Americans vaccinated on Friday!! Just wait till J n J vaccine is available in 3 weeks...herd immunity by April...the cruise, air n hospitality industries r so undervalued right now n will see demand like never before!!!"
"I’d like to see the cruise lines sponsor a drug company to create a near instantaneous test and have them set up at the terminals. It’s hours in lines anyway, what’s another couple minutes to get a test. If everyone is confirmed virus free, cruise ships would be the SAFEST place to be. No outside influences. As for the no cruise extension, you can’t fly to the ports, anyway. It’s all baked in."
this plandemic is expected until 2025 ...until the complete transformation of america into india west
Keith and Dean you need to do something. This thing is melting while markets are on fire.
if they voluntary decided to not sail until 2021 then THAT MEANS NO BANKRUPTCY. NO COMPANY WOULD FORCE BANKRUPTCY ON THEMSELVES
Today is the day you should cheer.. take it back to $30... rinse and repeat.
Christopher is deleting all his post lol
"A question for the experts?How is it possible that inflation is the cause of the stock market crash, when inflation is a product of higher liquidity which causes the price of products to rise including the price of a cruise vacation package when the salary of employees which is 40% of the cost remains constant, in my opinion when the price of the package rises product that there is more demand than supply, in this case the companies in the market that offer a product that can be sold for a higher price, they can have higher profit, and the marquet cap of the company can be higher"
"This is a no brainer. I am backing up the truck on this one. Carnival owns Holland America, Princess and other lines. Carnival is very undervalued and also pays a dividend."
"AFTER VACCINATED, WHAT 3 TOP STOCKS TO BUY? CCL - CCL -CCL. $100 AHEAD."
Looks like most cruisers and airlines went up today...sign of institutional buying interest maybe?
Hurry up 40 cents a share so I can stop shorting this boat that ain't never gonna float!! then buy long term at 40 cents a share
"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, putting things aside, this is a blue chip that was really unlucky and considering it is a world pandemic, everyone is going through hardships.. But their brand is still strong and other than this virus, this stock would be at $50 or higher, cures and coming up, the curve is flatter than ever in NY, less hospitalizations in NY, Cure available in France very soon and right to try exists in the US to hydroxiquine with zinc or however you write that. As Trump said, he sees the light at the end of the tunnel already, it's happening slowly. Remember, NY is not all of the USA. The saudis also bough in 45M shares, this thing is heading up soon, i got in at 10.5 , cruiseline is having a really good curve all together upward, shorting this at this price already makes no sense haha."
All the pieces are nearly together for the MASS CRUISE RESTART IN USA! CCL $42 BY 7/1/21!
"Did anybody hear from issay bowls, or Jim."
Those who were waiting for 25 to get in: your dream came true
"Onces we have a cure. All the ones who didn’t invest,will be very upset"
Suddenly the bears appear on ccl. Short lived. CDC has cleared cruises to start summer.
Anyone holding for long term. 2 years or more.
"Fauci and Walensky continue promoting the scamdemic, however it's played out and will soon be time to get these cruise ships going in the US."
If I hear one more person talk about earnings I swear  what do you think their earnings are? They haven’t sailed in a year. Just shut up and buy!!!

"It is unacceptable that the CDC has not yet responded to NCLH's resail 4/5/21 request! They are incompetent, unprofessional, political, and power hungry! It's absolutely UNCONSTITUTIONAL that they have this power! They know that NCLH's plan is indisputably safer than their own bureaucratic CSO and safer than any other travel/leisure activity! As a result, they CAN'T respond!"
"This is why the Longs are holding on:CCL & most of the publicly traded stocks have ran an impressive rally since they all tanked earlier this year due to Covid. However, CCLs price appreciation will not keep going up as it did in the last 6 months, because it is running out of steam. You cannot have zero revenue, multiple share dilutions, billions of monthly expenses (operation, payroll, debt's interest) then you expect the price to keep going up & up. It does not make any sense. If you made money in the last few months, then good for you! great timing! That's what we're all here for, is to make money, but it is time to move on & let go of any emotional attachments to the company. The writing is on the wall.."
"Travel won't return to normal soon at all if ever. I don't walk around alone by myself in a mask or drive with a mask but I can certainly recognize that millions of people do and that social distancing isn't just going to end when the all clear is given. Elites will just be moving onto another virus scare anyway, they're already fishing for one."
"None of you know what’s going to happen. Both sides have valid logic, let’s see who’s side has more money."
Treasury yields are at 1.74%. The sky is falling.... don’t forget they were 10% in 1985 and 5% in 2000. Big whoop. We will survive.
I get up everyday and try to be optimistic then you read places like California and others are now starting to get hit hard. 30 Million laid off. I do not know what tomorrow holds.
"From now on, looking forward is the only strategy. Money will flow to beaten down sectors like travel and recreation."
Sorry shorts not today
Now if something would spur AAPL it would make my day!
Why do uninformed people think carnival is going bankrupt. They would ever only go bankrupt if this lasted into the 2nd half of next year. Some cruises are starting in a couple months. Yes things aren't going to be great for the next few months but bankruptcy is not on the table at all.
"This stock is too risky at the moment. I may get back in when the chance of bankruptcy is more tolerable. Even if the government lifts social distancing on April 30th (best case), it would still be too scary to go on a cruise for a while. I know I wouldn't go till at least when they have vaccine which is estimated to be 12-18 months away."
Do we see another go at $30 today. :) lots of good news out there today. Good luck lings
Passenger tests positive for Covid on first ship to sail to Caribbean.
"Hey SHORTY McFLY, how you gonna feel when CSO lifts and CCL hits $65"
Shorts I feel your pain......
"Long term this is a no brainer, just have to survive the dips."
"Seems like Trump will provide aid somehow to cruise lines.After the Senate added language to the stimulus bill that effectively excluded the ailing cruise lines from aid, Trump told reporters earlier this week he may seek ways to get them money. “We’re going to work very hard on the cruise line business and we’re going to figure something out,” the president said. Trump has previously indicated his support of the industry and Carnival chairman Micky Arison.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/28/trump-pushes-back-against-congressional-oversight-for-500-billion-bailout-fund.html"
I know it hurts to watch this but it's gonna get better before long for all you LONGS. Right now it's the day of the shorts and it will be covered then LONG it be and up we go.
people won't be cruising in any numbers till mid next year. can they survive the delay is the question.
"the founding family owns or controls over 25% of ccl. they will not allow this comapany to go under.regarding the dividend, the ratio payout is below 50% ccl had record eranings in 2019.close to 50 million passengers board some form of passenger vessel annually, from round the world cruises, to cross channel ferries, also over night ferries to many countries. a dozen passengers come down with a flu likeillness and its the end of the world.this is not the first time passenger shipping companies have had to deal with world wide crisis. world war 1 and world war 2 no one was taking pleasure cruises, and in fact many passenger ships where lost due to war.pleasure cruises have been around since the early 19th century, and they have managed to make a profit.the only thing different here, is up to about 30 years ago, society was not afaid of its own shadow, running on mob mentality, and acting irrationally over everything and anything, prior generations had one thing present day society does not, and that is GOOD OLD COMMON SENSE AND RATIONAL BEHAVIOR!"
"Better to buy pre or post earnings??Honest, educated answers only please."
I do think this current price is a fair evaluation but if this keeps shooting up I'm out long term at least.
"I dont understand. CCL has little over 500m cash on hand, but this quarter made a loss of 700m. Thats -200m. Also CCL has over 6billion debt. Why is this stock rising?"
"This guy named Shayna knows the game, very intelligent guy "" Biden I'm not smart money, but if I was, this is what I'd do. It's a pretty safe bet we'll see a vaccine by Thanksgiving. We'll likely get leaks of a vaccine, preliminary results, etc, before ...meaning the market could start moving end of August, or Sept. People that see the vaccine is more likely, will start hunting for deals in the market before the investors that need less risk, and really, the deals that are left are banks and travel and leisure, casinos, cyclicals, etc. Behind this will be a massive, world wide wave of optimism that things will be returning to to normal. When the vaccine is out, and proven effective, there will be a world wide party the likes of which we haven't seen. This will create buy pressure everywhere, and massive optimism. Tech stocks are also due for a pretty decent correction, money is going to rotate out of them and that money will also be looking for a deal. Stimulus money is coming back into the market soon, that will be largely retail investors looking for cheap stocks, again, buy pressure. This is a perfect storm of buy pressure across entire industries. Add to this, that in these cruise stocks, institutions are controlling nearly 90% of the float for most of the cruise stocks, and some these stocks have almost a 20% short interest. If these institutions decide to hold for a bit, this will dry up the float, and make for an epic short squeeze we've not seen in a while. Then, with the stocks driven up, since these hedge funds are now liquid and able to sell, they will. They are going to make billions."" $RCL $CCL $PLAY $NCLH $UAL $DAL"
"NEWS!! Will be released this week or early next week that CDC will begin to relax cruise restrictions & allow vaccine passports. CCL gonna fly past $40 when the news is out. The question is, do you buy more CCL now at these levels, or wait till it shoots back up past $40?"
"The sailing industry is a very strong industry, so once a few people are released, especially many people with money there are loads of orders along the way, the sailing industry is profitable and will remain with us for a long time"

"For the first time in a month, the 7 day average of the number of new cases in the united states is decreasing.

"New Job Posting Hints at Potential Return of Disney Cruise Line SailingsDisney Cruise Line has posted a new job opening for a beach lifeguard at Castaway Cay, Disney’s private island, suggesting they may soon resume sailings.Disney Cruise Line has canceled sailings through February 2021, and removed March sailings from their website. While it’s likely lifeguards have been working with a skeleton crew at Castaway Cay during this near year-long closure, a job posting suggests they are in need of more people soon. Currently, Disney Cruise Line lists 26 sailings leaving in April 2021.In October, the CDC allowed their no-sail order to expire and established guidelines for cruise lines to resume passenger cruises. The CDC’s phased plan includes testing for crew members, ensuring cruise ship operators have adequate health and safety measures, simulated voyages to test operations, and certification for ships that meet requirements before a phased return to passenger sailings will begin."
"Good thing I record my screen. I always save the recordings. LOL, Christopher I have your posts you just deleted if you need to be reminded what they were."
Spiking 4.8% when market is down and no news! Insiders & Institutions were probably leaked that CDC test sailing approval is imminent and they are buying! Shorts better cover!
What happens when they announce they are filing for bankruptcy? Do you get your money back?
We maintain $12 it looks like $14 and some change is the next leg!!!! Ride the wave
Jeremy isn’t going to help you now lol
"This is going down, they are going to halt the ships from leaving the ports because of the large danger, carnival already is getting sued for the outbreaks, this is going down to $15-$18 tomorrow, it will recover in a year, but for now this is a sinking ship."
"Robert, Christopher, Ms. Clean, Richard on the Loser Cruise they were able to buy from the combined $30 they made from shorting this week"
Shorts can’t find shares to cover. Epic!
does anyone know how much Saudi fund pay for carnival? was it $12 per share?
"so seems like after purchasing 100 shares they give some sort of obc, anyone have any more info on this?"
Just exited my position and locked in profits. I see the bull case but I'm not okay with the risk at the moment and can't imagine what guidance they can possibly give tomorrow that will result in the stock not dropping further. Good luck to the longs!
Buy low sell high...Repeat...
"CDC under a lot of pressure right now. You can't say it's OK to travel for airlines, busses, trains and open theaters, gyms, and sports arenas, and not allow cruises to resume. Especially if already vaccinated."
"Those of you who already own CCL stock, your shares just became worth even less, though I doubt most of you realize this. CCL has dug itself a financial hole that it's going to have a very hard time climbing out of. The CCL of 2019 no longer exist; Ch. 11 is a very real possibility. Even if that doesn't occur, you're not going to get dividends for a good long while."
"Generally, cruise lines need 40%-50% occupancy just to break even. Why even sail at partial capacity only to lose money?"

"Dr Fauci estimates that around 60 to 70 percent was required at the onset of the pandemic. Last month, he increased the HIT to 70-75 percent in television interviews.However, last week, Fauci told CNBC News that HIT could be around75 to 85 percent.""We really don't know what the real number is. I think the real range is somewhere between 70 to 90 percent. But, I'm not going to say 90 percent,"" he told The New York Times.“When polls said only about half of all Americans would take a vaccine, I was saying herd immunity would take 70 to 75 percent,” Dr. Fauci added.“Then, when newer surveys said 60 percent or more would take it, I thought, ‘I can nudge this up a bit,’ so I went to 80, 85.”The needed HIT predictions for coronavirus by Fauci is close to the measles HIT which requires a 90 percent threshold.Once again, the devil is in the detail. No matter how many or how fast companies will produce the vaccine, the reality is that anti-vaxxers will hinder efforts to achieve herd immunity. This will be a very long and painful process. And if you argue that those who refuse the vaccine will not be allowed to cruise, go to a movie theater, take a plane, or dine in restaurants, then you have to consider two things. First, decrease in income for companies who will refuse those who are not vaccinated. And secondly, lawsuits that will pileup against these companies."
perhaps CCL can market virtual cruises that people can enjoy on their phones in the safety of their home. with virtual reality machine vision and touch
will be back to 24's soon this week
What news source?
"Retested the 50 day sma at 23.79, couldn't be more bullish from technical perspective. Up we go!"
"I read through this thread and honestly can understand each sides point of view - investing in CCL ( whether its options or stocks ) is simply higher risk/higher upside investment for those who have a high risk tolerance. Let’s be honest - nobody can say with 100% certainty whether or not it’s going bankrupt or not. Possible? Potentially but that’s why again it’s a much higher upside play over a 2-year horizon than a Netflix, Google or Facebook for example."
"I am new in this board. Does it make sense to invest at this price for long term? Say 1-2 years? Once the vaccine is out and all normal, I think this do good?"
Good vaccine news regarding Moderna. Will accelerate vaccinations. Should be a good week next week for all travel stocks.
Shorts saying...” Why is the ticker CCL so GREEN?”
Im all in at 7.

"Only 47,819 new cases of Kung Flu virus in the U.S. for the last 24 hours with nearly half the population vaccinated. Could someone short a million shares of stock, and then smuggle the virus onboard the ship hoping for an outbreak? Just thinking. Sorry for spoiling your day."
"Proof of full vaccination(cdc card), rapid tests before boarding the ship (testing cost built to the ticket price), along with safety measures, and that would be help convince a hesitant public to cruise."
Beware! 20 of 23 users on this board are the same person. Don't fall for the scam. Make your own decisions.
Very bad news from the World to CCL.
"once CCL sets sail, it will be the shorts that will be filing bankruptcy!"
"sold off yesterday at 12.1, waiting for lower entry price, wait for 7.8"
Sad as shorts keep trying to rally down as they resort pulling their gold teeth to sell just to cover.....
Florida sueing the CDC is great but let's not forget the piece of work it was last year to let people disembark the ships when someone on their ship tested positive
I reitterate...400 million vaccines will be available soon which is more than the US population!!! Sailings coming back real soon as cases diminish daily in numbers! Today is the day we sail past $30 IMO!!! :)
Where is that @brr loudmouth guy? He has seemed to disappear too. Wasn't he a career long on this board?Kind of odd when the price rises the shorts disaooear.
"https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5862/Considering Canada banning cruises in fear of virus-carrying American tourists, I believe that this will be the normal attitude and behavior on the part of many Caribbean countries' government officials rather than the exception toward American cruises. If things get better and vaccination rate is better than expected, American cruise lovers may be able to go on cruises to nowhere toward the end of 2021 limited to a few ships. Another year of $0 or close to $0 revenue in 2021 means another $7 billion deeper in the hole for 2021 on top of the $6 billion plus in the hole in 2020. Is CCL part of Fed reserve? CCL has no way of creating or printing money out of thin air. Every cent CCL spends that they do not have must be borrowed or obtained from selling stocks, which dilutes existing equity holders, making your share of future profits a fraction of what(a lot less than) it was when you first bought CCL stock. For current shareholders of CCL, is this so difficult to have your mind wrap around this concept?"
AS I SAID..... Heading up in AFTER HOURS!!!!
Time to buy. Will be much higher soon imo . Really good company and insiders also believe in that.
$CCL $RCL Too much uncertainly. Stocks look like they want to drop.
this will trade in the 30's as they get within 6-8 weeks of sailing again... I think 125% upside within 5 weeks from now
Would this be a solid buy & hold opportunity for CCL?
I will rest easy knowing I’m on the Regal Princess as the shorts paddle their way out of debt!
Looking for a good bounce today. Watch and learn!!!
"If you can’t hear them, they are predicting CCL !Strong buy!"
"Don't worry folks, 40 is coming soon"

"It takes more than posting GIFs of Shaquille O'neal, flying rockets or ""Buy, Buy, buy"" for a company & its stock to prosper. A company needs REVENUE/EARNING GROWTH, SOLID CASHFLOW, LOW DEBT, HIGH EARNING PER SHARE. Do your homework! Be an investor, not a cheerleader!"
"Announcement:A hedge fund who shorted CCL he realized when trying to book a cruise for his family that prices went up 35% he pledged to paper guys please sell ccl he needs more money to be able to pay for his and family extravaganza vacation ,he needs to make more money on shorts"
Last time there was an opportunity like this was in 1992
"Just as I thought, There was a lot of options expiring today @ $24.50 & $25I think that's why it was kept at that level most of the day to manipulate the profit/loss. Has gone higher now A/H and expecting this to fly Monday."
What is the difference between CUK and CLL and does anyone know why the differenceTheir financials show they are the same company so shouldn’t we all just buy CUK?
covid spike in europe could impact the cruise industry. CCL Holland America hub for Mediterranean & Adriatic is Rome. Italy is in lockdown again.
People are so confused when cruise stocks continue to go up even after more voyages get delayed or canceled. I don’t see how it is that complicated. They are consistently profitable beast companies in normal times and it seems more and more like those times will be returning regardless of how many set sail in the next six months
Cruise meeting appears to be back on the menu guys $NCLH $CCL $RCLhttps://www.porthole.com/vp-to-host-conference-call-with-cruise-lines-today/

Delta increases flights to Alaska. This should help CCL due to their hotels and attractions there.
"They’ll be sailing by summer, guaranteed. Take that to the bank"
back to 10 soon.
J&j vaccine is very effective. It is single dose. COVID epidemic will end this summer in the USA.
What an amazing day after a 4% gain. Two weeks ago this would have dropped 3% the day following a 4% gain. People are feeling optimistic and money is flowing back into the whole market. I feel a very bullish month coming on!
WOW! $13.73 high today. We’re almost there guys! See everyone at $14z
All stay-at-home stocks taking a hit today while the back to normality ones recovering. Today is a small sample of what's coming on for next months. I wouldn't like to be short on CCL now.
$70 BY JUNE 2021.
Oh well. Not the best of news but as a long term investment doesnt really effect me. I guess we will see where she wants to go.
"Long and strong, unlike Ken's #$%$"
"Every time it goes up before the earnings, they dilute..."
"The financing is a clear positive for the company. That said, people need to stop comparing cruising to flying in terms of recovery. People flew after 9/11, yes. But flying is almost a necessity. Cruising is not. This industry has a ways to go."
CDC WILL ALLOW SAILING BEGINNING JULY AS REQUESTED
Did someone get hired as a cruise industry consultant?
This stock worth 9$ no cruising at all!!!!Banks upgrading and will manipulate u guys and short the stock!

"News just now from a realtor in cabo San Lucas, Mexico (1:40 PM) PST Hello I hope you all are having a great week so far. I have a few announcements this week regarding what is happening in the Los Cabos area. First of all Vidanta and Carnaval have announced their return to Cabo San Lucas starting in November and December. That will be a huge needed & welcomed boost to our community! Norwegian had also made their announcement a few weeks ago to return to Cabo and I am expecting the other cruise lines won't be far behind to join them. At this time we still remain at a level 4 but they will be announcing next week they will decide to move us to a level 3, fingers crossed!"
hey bill hope are you doing today?
There is still no announcement from CCL on when earnings will be ? Only estimates have been posted.
"Carnival is planning to start some operations by May 11, according to a statement. ....."
"I use to move 10k -20k people a month in transportation on March and if this information can help the slowest months are may June July August September October why ? Because it’s hot in Florida and that’s normal economy so I want you to think deeply before getting trapped in a buy or short position, you won’t see many people cruising until February next year I wish you all Success I’m really praying you can all be wise investing and not get all emotional and lose your money to the professionals that been doing this for so many years. Trade small size and learn before losing to the pros"

JnJ will testify today that they can supply 20 million one shot vaccines to the US by the end of March with 100 million total by end of June. A decision for FDA emergency approval expected this weekend.
I like DISNEY at these valuations much better than CCL / RCL. Cruise lines have Much risk and no earnings followed by low earnings and higher debt and dilution. Disney is a better Long Term play.
"11:03 ET - The expert panel formed by cruise operators Royal Caribbean and Norwegian in developing cruising protocols has gotten the support of the CDC and will share findings with the rest of the industry, says panel co-chair Michael Leavitt, who is former governor of Utah and HHS secretary under the Bush administration.

possible new short positions coming in with selling pressure and then shorts will cover around 20 dolalrs and then bulls are going to cheer for no reason because it's going up when the stock was down and then more downtrent. will take a month

"Delta Airlines just gave me a full refund for my flights to and from the Princess Cruise that I will cancel tomorrow. They didn’t have to do it, but couldn’t have been nicer about it.........We’ll see about Princess tomorrow. :-)"
Short term no sailing extension..See it?
"Just be careful, i opened a short position cause i believe a crash is coming... Also if you check the latest SEC on CCL and CUK you will see that insiders sold almost 2.000.000 dollars worth of shares last week....... Short term and mid term i don't see this stock much bullish........."
I swear I will once again buy Cruise line stocks. After the bankruptcies are complete and we have a HUMAN SAFE vaccine in 2027.
"Here's how to get a free holiday.Start planning your vacation as all senior citizens will have been vaccinated within the next three months.We all invest $20,000 in CCL (biggest and best in the Cruise business) and watch the shares recover by even a fifth.

"Recent poll notes 75% respondents say they will cruise again. If people are saying that in the middle of a pandemic, 95% plus will be saying it when there’s a vaccine. CCL will be up to $30 in a year and back to $50’s in three years."
"In time, Cruise Line stock prices will go beyond the current 52-week high."
"Don't worry, Halloween will be here before you know it and CCL can use the ships as haunted attractions. Rightly done it can bring a good amount of money. From there we jump to Thanksgiving. Give a twist to the Plymouth Voyage, something like ""Had the pilgrims have this ship, where would have they landed?"" and just sail out to sea for 4 or 5 days going in circles. After that it is Christmas. Have a Christmas party everyday just outside the port city. And hopefully by Jan 2021 you would have at least survived."

Not sure the remarks will love the stock one way or the other. Nothing new. Did sound like there was less liquidity than everyone was pricing in though.
Moving up now!
"As of Feb 2021, Carnival debt ballooned to over $30 Billion. A large portion of that debt is due within 24 months. The risk of bankruptcy has not eased, and in fact, has gotten much more real. The junk rating on its debt only provides further proof that the company cannot service the debt, and they will have a very hard time trying to issue more debt in the future. Any debt they can issue will come at a very high cost."

Vaccination on this Sunday 24th. Next one on 13th April. Not because of age or vulnerability but because I’m a key worker. Just one of the millions of key workers in the UK who can’t wait to get back to cruising and will be ready to board once the green light comes on.
"""Look at the rate of decline,"" he said. ""We've got about half the country, I estimate 55% based on the sampling capture rate of tested, confirmed cases, about 55% of the country has natural immunity.""And when vaccinations are added into the equation, with 15% of the country being immunized by the end of this week and up to 40% of the country by early April, ""that will kick in,"" the doctor said.

Bought $50k yesterday. Good price to me to get in.
"RIGHT NOW...Most of the 121 cruise ships that entered U.S. waters after March 1 had Covid-19 cases on board, according to newly released C.D.C. data.The United States on Thursday reported more than 40,000 new coronavirus cases, a record total for the second straight day, as a nationwide sense of urgency grew and caseloads soared in Southern and Western states that were far removed from the worst early outbreaks.In an apparent sign of that urgency, White House officials said that the coronavirus task force planned to reconvene on Friday for its first briefing in nearly two months. The last briefing took place on April 27.Thursday’s record came as at least four states — Alabama, Alaska, Montana and Utah — reported their largest daily totals.California, where stay-at-home orders were imposed particularly early in the pandemic, surpassed 200,000 total cases on Thursday, as its number of infections doubled over the past month. That is the second highest total for any state, though California’s per capita infection rate remains far lower than New York’s."
"If anyone looks at the 5 year chart you will see that there is strong support in the 42-44 range ,,, with a safe dividend and excellent growth ahead this is a screaming buy ,, when great companies get hit ,, the board tends to dry up because of lack of confidence ,, thats when it should be bought ,,,,, when the talking heads tell you to buy it at 58 with a target at 65 ,, makes no sense ... good luck to any buyer at these prices .."
14 is just around the corner!!
"It's anybodies guess how low CCL will go, the real question is whether CCL will survive the pandemic and not go bankrupt. Because if does infact survive this storm, CCL will come back stronger and head to all time highes in 3-5 years into the future...So if you have the patience to ride this crazy roller coaster, you will be rewarded generously!!!"
Bought a bunch at the close. Long term hold.
TRVG a sleeper.
CCL $30 SOON!
"Come July, the Lido Deck will be full and CCL will be raking in the cash!"
going back to $10
Time to buy .. easy 50 by 4th july
5-Day chart is a beautiful thing
Insanity. No other word to describe it. This company was in financial trouble pre-covid. And now with 26 billion in debt and maybe resuming sailing it's going up as if a gold mind. Just unreal.
"Shout out to all the CCL haters. Been here since 14 posted multiple times, and its only up from here! Like I said six months ago, to the 30s we go!"
"What a bargain CCL is, this low level won't last long! $42 soon!"
Is it true I heard all the cruise ships that Carnival owns worth 40 billions?
Carnival is up 6.62% to 23.04

I think this is heading for Chapter 8 bankruptcy. There is no other way they will be able to get out from under the debt they have had to acquire to stay afloat. Boat tickets alone can't undo this financial damage. Am I wrong?
Keep making stuff up chuck. Hey....have the saudis sold their stake yet as you said they'd do this week? Good lord you need attention don't you? Amazing.

Anyone else also in NCLH and RCL?
well whaddaya know. they did extend pauses today from seattle to alaska. you can effectively say NO sailing in summer. you better believe you gotta wait 6/2022 for this to pop again. This is going to drift down and sideways for months and every bull in here won't know what happened.
one piece of good news and will jump to $35
28 bucks to end today would be fine with me.:)
leg up to 31 about to begin
Tomorrow it will go up above $16
"Carnival call volume above normal and directionally bullish. Like I've said before. Betting your money against a cash cow that produced billions in revenue and believing it will ""sink"" - no pun intended - over a pandemic that is nearing its end is a risky bet. Tomorrow's investor brief will outline a careful and systematic return to cruising, with an optimistic outlook for the next FY. This stock belongs in the $25-$30 dollar range all day long next year."
"Carnival announced this morning that its Holland America brand has opened bookings for cruises to and from Europe for 2022.

400 million vaccines will be available soon which is more than the US population!!! Sailings coming back real soon as cases diminish in daily numbers! Today is the day we sail past $30 IMO!!! :)
Wow. Ship sailing only 25 recent filled when sails. Is this true. They canceling cruises cause it will lose more money than staying idle. Is this true??
Just opened my first position in CCL (or any cruise line stocks). 100 @ 8.10. Might add more over the next few weeks.Lets see how this plays out over the next 5 years. GLTA
Bree the bear talking about today being red after a 4-5x since the crash. We will absolutely continue up from here.
@David. Shorts don't take profit. We short stocks just for the fun of it. Another stock guru.
Trump just said he will bailout the cruise lines. Just bought 500 @17.5
With the new share offering and dilution the company is able to ride this storm out through next year. Us old people aren’t antivaxers. Can’t wait to get mine. Love cruising. So much pent up demand this stock will explode like a sailor on shore leave. Bought shares of CCL for my Roth IRA on Pfizer vaccine news. Expect to more than double in -2 years and possibly sooner with all the shorts needing to cover. Great return coming.

"Charts:- Everything still looking super bullish, no sell indicators in sight, Hopefully we can see $30 this week, maybe even $33. Again I think news could be our only downfall, what with Arnold coming out saying news about finance, It's known news but I wonder what the market will make of it Monday. Could be the indicator of the week, Green Monday and I'll be confident we go higher."
Funny how people think cruise stocks will go back to normal levels soon. We are a doomed society with democraps in charge. The taxes alone will drain anyone capable of affording a cruise in the future. Thanks democraps for the downfall of our nation. Good luck affording a cruise with Bidens tax plans! Please give it a thought!
"MSC Cruises Extends U.S. Pause Through April 2021.MSC Cruises announced today a further extension of the temporary pause of its U.S.-based sailings through to and including April 30, 2021, according to a press release.

Gold bath tomorrow
Hope you guys sold at 30. Get back in at Resistance level
About to bounce
dilutions and delays or fomo of reopenings. Fight between bull and bears. I'm a bear at the moment and probably end up being a bear for a good month before I like the price for this and all the reopening energy subsides.
What ever happened to David's 'WOLF' of Wall Street? Rumour has it Issay's got it hanging up in his trophy room.
just wondering where is a rock bottom? I think the previous $8 is already behind. I meant an intermediate one. At what price should I start to increase a position. My average is 9.2 but I took only 50% of initially planned position. 1 year target is 24-27. I do not think I will have more patience to hold CCL. According to the CEO they have a blowout amount of booking for 2021 and already started to to book for 2022. as Always the market should take it well in advance.
No business until late fall. Have fun wishing for new highs here. I can realistically see this under 10 by mid summer
CDC ALLOWING CRUISES FROM MID SUMMER. say hello to $40 very very soon..
$CCL Upgrades Credit Suisse Outperform USD 18 » USD 40 Upgrades Argus Buy USD 33
Last tiny bounce before it drops to $27.89
"Just bought additional 10k shares, what a nice day)"
Whats do you guys think the stock price will be when they announce cruise cancellations? Any thoughts?
All cruising guests need proof of vaccination then we can sail!
"Treatment showing promise and vaccines around the corner. If you’re not on board, you’re missing a great cruise higher. $11 is in the rear view mirror."
Where r those guys who said Q2 earnings is already priced in?
CCL has now secure enough covid19 for its crews and passengers at each port entry and depart and will share all costs of 50% with customers.Right it's preparing a comprehensive plans for CDC
I gotta say. It feels so good to sell when the market is up and buy it back on the dip
"CCL positiveCruise lines are warming up their engines. Italy gave green light to cruise restarting, meaning Costa and Aida can restart cruises next weekhttps://www.corrieremarittimo.it/cruise-ferries/crociere-msc-e-costa-scaldano-i-motori-approvato-il-protocollo-per-la-sicurezza-sanitaria/"
"Shareholders benefits plus nice divi, good deal."
"So between borrowing money at a super high interest rate and diluting stockholders, just how much cash does this company have left and their burn rate is going to go through the roof even when they do start cruising again. All these ships have to be brought back online and anyone who knows anything about machinery that has sat for a year without functioning knows what the cost is going to be. I really don't know what these guys actual plan is other than to just keep borrowing money and diluting stock and then right before they reopen they file for bankruptcy clear out the spreadsheets and move forward from there. Pity the common shareholder"
When can CCL price reach yearly high?!
I guarantee all these idiots happy that the price dropped don’t even have short positions. They are just blowing hot air. Don’t stress. 8% is a 1 or 2 day setback. We are looking at the lowest number of cases per day since the very beginning of COVID. Cruises will be sailing soon and longs will be enjoying huge returns!
Sad....
"NCLH on CNBC - CDC rules not practical to restart cruising. ""Instead of easing rules the CDC doubled down"""
Bought 1000 shares @ $19.70 this morning and sold @ $20.10 and made $400.
Who in their right mind is going to buy a sinking ship?
There is no shorting going on with CUK.... only 1% of the float is shorted.
Yep! CCL heading to $65Won’t be long for the ships to sail!Strong buy!!!
"Short are delusional, they are hoping for the virus to be spread again and the lockdown reimposed, so that leisure travel like cruise line will never operate again. IT WILL NOT HAPPEN. Leisure travel is coming back, inflation means people have money and willing to spend it, and economy is reopening along with more vaccine rollout. CCL has hit rock bottom and it’s time to come back."
"Florida files lawsuit against CDC.......About time...it’s ridiculous that Americans can get a flight and cruise from Nassau, Bermuda, St.Martaan or Cyprus and yet, they can’t get on a ship in their own country!"
"“If you are a healthy young person, there is no reason if you want to go on a cruise ship, go on a cruise ship.”Anthony Fauci, Director of NIAID"
"Two CCL Positives for Friday! The cruise lines, the administration, and CDC had a meeting at the beginning of this week to plan a resumption of sailing in July; the cruise lines were were greatly encouraged by the governments engagement! Also, NCLH sent another letter to CDC requesting that they respond to their resail plan, they are keeping up the PRESSURE! The CCL launch to $42 could be SOON!Time for Alaska & Texas to sue!"
Up Up and Away!!!!! CCL!!!
Carnival share repurchase scheme is able to be voted for at the annual meeting. Voting by April 19th. Yes!!!
I'm really starting to accumulate this stock on the way down and I'm not nervous about my bet either. It's cheap and people that go on cruises really love them and are ready to plan the next trip back out to sea
"Just red an article that the last travel ship dock after 6 Months at the sea, no one want to be stack at the sea for that long, don’t think anyone will cruise before vaccine in place, beside, most of the cruise clients are old people’s and families that will not take a risk, all the bookings bull in the media is just to raze money, I’m not shorting the stock I’m just realistic, this companies will bankrupt, it will cost them billions just to saddle the lawsuits against them, don’t close your ayes when your money park here, https://www.google.com/amp/s/ktla.com/news/nationworld/final-cruise-ship-still-carrying-passengers-docks-in-germany-after-6-months-at-sea/amp/"
At least wait till after Q1 report in 2 weeks to consider buying. Q1 numbers would be really bad which will bring this stock to a new bottom.
"Charts:- Nothing much has changed really, A lot of resistance on the weekly at $30 and nice support in the $28 range. Daily still looks very bullish being above most indicators. Again IF we can break $30 we can see $33-$39 going forward, with $30 becoming nice support. So could either be a good week, or a choppy week testing both support and resistance.Good Luck Longs. :)"
Just heard...No bailout money for cruise ships. Is that correct?
"We’ve had an excellent run and now we need time to consolidate, is all. Consider purchasing shares in fast growth Fisker, or in extremely oversold Viacom. It’s almost impossible to not make money at those attractive valuations."
Wake up shorty...CCL = Strong Buy!

There is a problem with all this vaccine talk. Fauci has stated that we now have to worry about variants. There is a new variant from Brazil being brought up by the migrant surge. He basically said its not the “wild type” we now have to worry about but this these mutated strands. This is coming from the highest paid federal employee. Id be cautious to think that sailing would be given a green light. Especially when these ships are traveling internationally
Added more shares today...Gonna be a good Christmas!
"I'm gonna sell off some shares here. I'm long but I can definitely see this dropping back down. and if it doesn't, I'm okay with that. I'll just write a couple of thousand in losses off on taxes this year, lol. still have a significant stake and should do well long term."
Charts indicates sell
"There is a thing called ""mute"""
Ouch
"Anyone shorting this stock now shouldn't be trading. Potentially very little downside on this stock now, except for unforeseen circumstances, Its obvious now they will be cruising second half of this year, day trade all you want but don't open any shorts without very tight stop losses as any morning you could wake up to massive losses. $20.64 this crosses the 50 dma, which is a huge buy signal, I think we go past that tomorrow. I'm fully loaded with shares, and will add on any weak days. Good luck all, the worse is behind us."
Will CCL close above $30 on Monday? Can you imagine being short after the positive CDC news and thinking all weekend about those major losses coming on Monday! WOW!
**BREAKING**:CDC will unlikely require test sailings after all for un-vaccinated cruises! Great news for CCL!
with all this debt it might be better to do chapter 11 in long run
"Be patient with #$%$ has super strong liquidity. $20 next week, $60 next year, for sure."
"This stock keeps living in the red, yet many on here saying it will be at $30 soon. Not sure what’s giving so many extreme confidence at the moment? (I also feel like 80% of people on here are phony...just trying to manipulate perception)"
"What a bargain CCL is! We won't see this low of a price level much longer! $42 by June 1, 2021! The coming SHORT squeeze will be BRUTAL!"
"CCL was 72 just a couple of years ago, which means it should be at least 50 by the end of the year."

Barron's out with a hit job over the weekend.
You can book a ticket starting June. Which is actually a positive news.
I purchased 100 shares of CCL in 2011 for the primary reason of receiving shipboard credit on every Princess cruise we go on (250 dollars for every cruise greater than 14 days). The stock price is lower now than it was when I purchased it in 2011. We go on 4-6 Princess cruises/year so my investment has paid off in that regard. Definitely CCL needs to take a look at management since we have witnessed a lot of issues onboard.
"Wow... These are some mighty low volumes. I guess everyone's waiting until Trump's thing today, eh?"
How do you think the price of fuel will effect cruise ships bottom line ? It may be as much as a dollar more by the time they sail.
7 day alaska cruise for $714. If they file for bankruptcy will you get your money back.
I bought in at $8. My only regret is I didn’t buy more
They can't keep up the mask charade longer People ready to get out!
Carnival will easily be in the mid 30's once the CDC allows cruise testing!
investing in CCL anytime within the past 6 months is a no brainer. It will be ALL smooth sailing up and up from here. It doesn't require anyone to be investment savvy to figure this one out. If you cannot see past this then I don't know what to tell ya. You are quite hopeless at this point.

Bottom is in...markets are getting a sense of how long the curve takes to flatten based on china and south korea... if that malaria medicine works WATCH out shorties because having a way to treat the virus takes away the fear
"another point is many retail investors look who is buying and trying to follow. Saudi bought a lot of shares. It means those guys made their homework including getting an insider info. They found that BK is not on a horizon and the company makes all her best to avoid it. If BK is not a problem the only way the stock can go in a due time is up. As for Buffet. He makes same mistakes as others though his ""information and analytical power"" are 100 times better than anybody else have. And Buffet bought DAL for $46+ to sell those shares only several days later for $24 losing 50% of this investment (same LUV). It was a pure emotional move. I remember Buffet actions in 2008-2009 crisis. He bought several stocks on a way down and then they dropped 50-70% more. Then he changed a strategy and started to buy only preferred shares with guaranteed 10% interest (GS, GE, etc.). Resume: do not look at W. Buffet and other high ranked investors. They are deeply involved in the WS ""typical insider info"", they can do things that you are not allowed due to many reasons. Use you head and common sense (in a long run common sense is the best tool, while within short time frames it works against you - the WS mantra -the worse the better and v.v."

BEWARE!As two new usernames were added today 99.7% Of all comments and replies today were the work of the same person. We all know who this person is.
"From the July 16th Sec Filing:""On March 14, 2020, concurrent with our and the broader cruise industry’s suspension, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(“CDC”) issued a No Sail Order through April 13, 2020. On April 9, 2020, the CDC modified its existing No Sail Order to extend it until theearliest of (a) the expiration of the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ declaration that COVID-19 constitutes a public health emergency, (b)the date the Director of the CDC rescinds or modifies the No Sail Order or (c) 100 days after the order appears on the Federal Register, whichwould be July 24, 2020. Based on the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect that the CDC will extend the No Sail Order beyond ourcurrently announced voyage suspension, which would result in an extension to our suspension of voyages. In addition, the duration of anyvoluntary suspensions the Company has implemented and resumption of operations outside of the United States will be dependent, in part, onvarious travel restrictions and travel bans issued by various countries around the world, as well as the availability of ports around the world.The no cruise will be getting extended, thus the offerings to raise cash that they're bleeding daily. Expect RCL to follow suit soon.$CCL $NCLH $RCL"
You have been warned shorts..Good Luck!
Carnival perks.... I'm not sure if everyone's aware of this but CCL offers shareholder perks. Purchase a 7-day cruise as the shareholder and you get $100 on board ship credit. Nothing like sweeten'n the pot.
You can blame the new guy in office for this.
They will dilute and dilute over and over again until they survive through this. Its a 15 dollars stock but there will be 1 to 4 dilution making the share price much lower
"Since we have some real simpleton shorts that can’t read here is a graph showing how many people have been vaccinated. So shorties....when mommy packs your lunch, and you eat all your apple slices, your tummy gets full. You see shortie, vaccines are filling up the world .....https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations"
when to sell $11 break even put? it expire at friday. wait or find a good place to sell? first time option buyer.
Any occupancy over 30% puts cruise lines in profit. That’s how they were able to offer ginormous dividends of 15%.We will be back over $30 before end of the year!
CCL sure does look GREEN today! I thought shorts said it was going to $15?
i feel we may get an analyst updates soon on CCL with positive rating. its been a while .
Thanks CCL. I sold all my shares. Good luck rest of you. Might wade back in later if reality matches this topsy turvy market.
"SHORTS, I know you’re angry and hope this ship will sink, but let’s look are the reality. If CCL was going to fail, it would of by now. The fact of vaccinations are soaring means population will be ok. While not perfect, it will open up traveling globally very soon. Now this is a fact, not a pump. Just buy as much CCL as you can afford to minimize your losses and ride it all the way to $55 CCL = Strong Buy!"
Not looking good for longs. 
"For those hoping for quick recovery, keep in mind that vaccination around the world is very slow and well below anticipation. Some European countries are now suggesting that instead of giving 2 doses as required, to give only one dose to as many people as possible. In the USA vaccination rate is also well behind anticipation. However, when asked this weekend (meet the press) if the US will follow Europe by giving one dose instead of two, Fauci was totally against it. So, it might happen that millions of people will be vaccinated, but because they didn`t receive the second dose on time, we will be back to square one with covid."
@Keith Please check you @Harry calculator to give us his updated total loss at this point. Today alone has to be gigantic!
Insiders must know the NSO is about to be lifted and are BUYING! Shorts better cover!

Great news on vaccines. CCL will continue an upward move . The “shorties” are drying up. Looking at 26+ this week! Jg
Trend speaks for itself. 2 red days coming
"Domestic Cruises Are Coming Home To England on May 17March 09, 2021BRITANNIA 2British MP and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Aviation and Maritime, Robert Courts, has announced that domestic cruises will be resuming on May 17 in England.This was said during a virtual meeting of the All Party Parliamentary Maritime and Group (APPMPG) on March 8, the group wrote in a tweet. Courts later confirmed the news to the British media outlet, The Independent.According to The Independent, Courts told MPs that the government is “working with the home nations to get UK-wide domestic cruising up and running.” Meanwhile, voyages between English ports will likely be restarting on May 17.“Courts said the domestic move would help the cruise industry restore confidence and demonstrate the robustness of their protocols for passengers and crew, The Independent wrote.Paul Ludlow, the President of P&O Cruises, who earlier announced short UK cruises starting summer 2021, said he is “delighted” with the news.""We are delighted that the government has acknowledged that UK domestic cruise holidays can begin from May 17,” Ludlow said, according to the cruise line’s Facebook post.“Whilst it will take some weeks after this date for us to restart our operations, we are very much looking forward to welcoming guests onboard this summer for our series of Ultimate Escape staycations – UK coastal cruises. Details of these, with ships, dates and itineraries will be announced later this month,"" he added.Cruise Industry News Email Alerts"
"Enjoy the dips folks.....Zacks showing optimism and presently “hold” as the year ahead shows profits, lower covid figures, increased bookings and signs of new sailings planned soon. RCL adding Oddysey of the Seas to its 4 ships already sailing. It will use Israel as a homeport. Europe commencing sailings this month."
Shorts have no hold on CUK.
"Money flow today is just slightly negative by 1 million USD. That should tell you that again someone is just picking up these shares on the cheap. Plenty of buyers out there even in a down day on the S&P. Might not be green today, but trend is still healthy to the upside."
"Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG) stock was picked by investment advisory Evercore as one of top five picks for the clean energy transition planned by the US government. The advisory gave the firm an Outperform rating with a price target of $42, implying a 66% upside potential."

Something isnt making sense. An article for CCL came out about cruises happening in germany and for some reason drops nearly 5%. RCL indicates they may not do any cruises until 2021 and they only went down 0.29%. Am i missing something?
"They've secured enough money to last them a year, so I'm not sure what the bankruptcy chatter is about. They also issued another 750M of common stock which dilutes the shareholders...so there is no surprise that this is down today. Short term this will likely go lower but in my opinion 3-5 years from now the stock will be at least 4x what it is right now."
"Carnival said that all guests may be required to provide identifying information and information about certain activities engaged in during the cruise so Carnival can perform contact tracing in the event any person onboard is suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Various location tracking technologies may be used to assist in the collection of contact tracing information such as wearables, video surveillance, transaction data, and photographs taken during the cruise."
"with china virus spreading, market headed lower esp for cruise companies .. watch and wait ..'cause you'll have an opportunity to buy at a good price ...with nice yield ... for long term investors this will turn out to be a good opportunity ...glta"
Time to buy?
"@robert Actually 1/3 of this 30 billion debt is cash they have on hand. Before the pandemic their debt was already close to 10 bullion, and they were paying interest on it. And you're not taking into account the money they were giving away as a dividend. Yes, another share offering is likely, but not earlier than next year when the stock price will be around 50 and market cap close to 50 billion. With a 10% stock dillution they'll be able to bring down their debt to 15 billion as soon as early next year. So this debt is completely manageable. And yes, they got rid of a few ships, but those were older ships which were more expensive to operate. It should help them to improve margins once things get back on track"
CCL sold 400M share during covid and raised $10B now sitting on $11B cashHigh demand for cruises means no discounting fares to fill the shipCCL will cruise higher in 2021$40 for christmas
Good day to buy more. Buy?!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Cruise lines are going to skyrocket soon. Everyone is going after the CDC. Florida governor, the Miami mayor. Due to financial impact Carneval CCL will start sailing soon. Others will to, but carnival stands to earn the most since they haven't changed ports yet. Look up all the news articles. https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/florida-feds-cruise-ships-operate-sue-76709226"
"Maybe people realized that the Cash Register ain’t gonna ring, for a year."
"In Korea, even on the day of zero confirmed cases, everyone wore masks on the streets. It's a pity that the U.S. can get rid of the corona without a vaccine if they wear a mask."
"It is not practical to do cruises until a vaccine is available worldwide for people. Say a 1,000 people board in Miami for a 7 day cruise. Add to this 600 crew. So you have 1,600 people on the cruise ship. Normally you would require the people be self quarantines for 14 days before entering a country. But since they are flying in from all over the place how can you do this? So you just have to hope they are virus free & take their temp ( which is no guarantee of being virus free ) and possible do a Cover-19 test on them before boarding. You may not test positive if you just got the virus in the past day or two. The ship leaves and stops in 5 various island ports over the next week. Everyday they gets off the ship to explore the island and interact with locals and other passengers from other ships. So when they get back on the ship every afternoon their temp is checked and you keep your fingers crossed that they did not catch the virus. If someone tests positive you can rest assured the ship will have to quarantine all passengers for 2 weeks and the ship will not be allowed in any other ports. The cruise line will refund all passengers and give them a free cruise at a later date. Plus the ship will be out of service for a while for massive cleaning. Big financial loss. When the cruise companies can do 6 months of cruises without any cases I will consider cruising again. VACCINE? With a lot of luck...for our population to receive vaccinations it will likely take 12 - 18 months. Even if a vaccine was approved today it would take at least 6 -12 months to produce enough vaccine doses for the planets' 7 BILLION population."
"solid day, really nice to see that short covering at the end of the day. Seems they don't like holding shorts overnight, onwards and upwards."
"Us government just approved new test. NBA, Yale land the COVID testing breakthrough the NFL (and the general U.S. public) has been hoping for. $4.00 test. Rapid test. Cruise lines should open much higher Monday. $20 plus this week."
"I wouldn't touch even at $5 because better deals and much less likelihood of bankruptcy, major airline stocks."
2 carnival Cruise ships just crashed in Cozumel
Shorts haven’t said anything in the last 2 hours.......gone green again by any chance?
Ron DeSantis just called on the CDC to open Port Canaveral up and allow cruising again
"$42 that has nice ring to it, how does that sound to the shorts? Better cover!"
"I am neither short nor long, but find this stock interesting because of how it's related to the virus epidemic. IMO this is a classic 'relief rally' that will soon fail, mostly because people will soon realize the cruise lines aren't being bailed out and because of all those who will take the opportunity to get out on this pop. But we shall see!"
Hi SallyAre you taking good care of David and his dog at the shelter? Thank you.
"A securities class action lawsuit has been commenced in the the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The complaint alleges that throughout the class period Defendants issued materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the Company's medics were reporting increasing events of COVID-19 illness on the Company's ships; (2) Carnival was violating port of call regulations by concealing the amount and severity of COVID-19 infections on board its ships; (3) in responding to the outbreak of COVID-19, Carnival failed to follow the Company's own health and safety protocols developed in the wake of other communicable disease outbreaks; (4) by continuing to operate, Carnival ships were responsible for continuing to spread COVID-19 at various ports throughout the world; and (5) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants' positive statements about the Company's business, operations, and prospects, were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis."
"If cruise lines reopen before the virus is sufficiently under control, they run a significant legal and public relations risk, especially if a ship endures another outbreak like the one on the Diamond Princess. Additionally, there's the question of what a cruise would look like during coronavirus. Would customers be tested and screened every day? Would they have to wear masks at certain times? Cruises involve disembarking in exotic ports of call, so even a passenger who was disease-free at the beginning of a cruise could contract the virus during an onshore visit. Then there's the question of whether cities and other destinations want thousands of cruisers coming ashore during a pandemic. It's a logistical nightmare."
"News out in UK. Partial openings soon. With everything to be opened mid June. That may mean you might see cruises back to normal but with reduced capacity, July August time. Good news."

Norway and Saudi funds loaded CCL shares. They are long term players.
Fox business news today talked about top stocks for good chance of short squeeze. S3 research firm predicted GameStop short squeeze in Jan. Went from $20 to $500. CCL on that current list of potential short squeeze!!
"No brainer at this price!Buy as much as you can, it will be heading to $45 soon!!!  "
ccl owns about 200 billion dollars in ships..theybaint going bankrupt right now
Shorts are in trouble!!!
One year later today's price of 23.72 will show up as 52wk low
"HAHAHAHA You longs will watch this stock goes bankrupt or watch it going nowhere for many years. Make it many many many years. If and when cruise lines will resume operations, it will come down to how long it will take each of them to become profitable. Looking at debt size, Carnival will be last. Money will migrate from Carnival to other cruise lines."
I'm waiting for $25
"Cruising is such a solid future proofed sector. One of the remaining few Covid affected sectors to take advantage of while it’s still in recovery, easy 50-60% gain with a two year horizon. All aboard! Went with CCL and NCLH 50/50. Good luck to all "
"Royal Caribbean Will Sail Out of This California Port Next Year For the First Time in a DecadeThu, March 18, 2021, 7:23 AMRoyal Caribbean Navigator of the SeasCourtesy of Royal Caribbean Royal Caribbean's Navigator of the SeasA Royal Caribbean ship is heading to Hollywood next year, calling Los Angeles home for the first time in a decade.The cruise company said on Wednesday it will plan to move its ""Navigator of the Seas"" ship to LA in June 2022, sailing for trips lasting for 3-5 nights to Catalina Island in California as well as Ensenada and Cabo San Lucas in Mexico. Additionally, the ship will sail select winter holiday week-long trips.""California was calling us home once again, and what better way to reintroduce Royal Caribbean than to bring our next-level cruise vacations to the City of Angels and make it a year-round adventure starting just in time for summer,"" Michael Bayley, the president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International, said in a statement released Wednesday. ""We're excited to return to Los Angeles to add bigger, bolder vacation options along the West Coast. With a ship like 'Navigator of the Seas,' complete with waterslides, activities from day to night, and a lineup of restaurants, bars, and lounges, friends and families alike are in for a memorable getaway.""The ""Navigator of the Seas,"" which was refurbished in 2019, features a three-level poolside bar for taking in warm California nights, and a pair of waterslides that will get anyone's heart pumping: the Blaster aqua coaster (the longest waterslide at sea), and Riptide (a thrilling headfirst mat racer).Before heading to LA, the ship is expected to sail from Miami or Fort Lauderdale on three- and four-night itineraries to the Bahamas, according to the company.On land in LA, officials started loosening coronavirus-imposed restrictions this week, allowing attractions like indoor dining and museums to reopen with capacity restrictions. Additionally, Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park will finally be allowed to reopen on April 30.The city of Angels, however, isn't Royal Caribbean's only new city. The cruise line plans to sail three to seven-night journeys from Haifa in Israel to the Greek Isles and Cyprus for fully-vaccinated travelers in May."
"For shorts only: ""Costa Cruises, the Italian company of Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK), has revised its plans moving its restart to May.""It's uncanny how quiet the shareholders are when the share price drops by 4% in a few hours. Sooner or later, they will wake up to the fact that cruises will not start before the end of the Summer.Black Rob says that the shares will close above $30 today. Wake Up! Your dreaming again!"
Rise in variance COVID across the country. CCL is not going to open back up till next spring. Suckers bet on companies that have 0 income and burn through billions of dollars. Say goodbye to your money. You have ideas have been manipulated by the PUMP AND DUMP
Looks like markets recovered down trend on Ccl will continue 23.10 will bottom
"BEWARE!14 of 17 people who have posted on this board today are one of the same person. Yes, we all know who it is.Do your own homework!"
"Just a few facts to calm all the ”vaccine ppl”.i) All attempts to create a vaccine against all previous strains of corona-virus have failed. And they have tried, hard.ii) Present virus has a genome sequence borrowed from the HI-virus (by the virologists in WIV). This may lead to COVID-19 becoming a chronic desease. Stay home, stay safe, was your hands, wear your mask.iii) No cruises until new daily cases go down to zero (globally) and stay there for at least 6months.With this knowledge, try to extrapolate the value of cruise liner stocks."
"I think this selloff on the fake news is overdone. CDC is reviewing the no sailing order and will obviously lift it very soon, allowing fully vaccinated cruises"
"CDC is feeling the pressure! CLIA, US Travel Association (today), Gov. of FL, Mayor of Miami, all the 4 Major Cruise Lines, US Senators, and thousands of cruisers and investors are confronting the CDC about lifting the NSO!"
"BREAKING: $RCL CEO Richard Fain in interview “We’ll I think it may, and we’re really very pleased, and excited...it really does support the pathway that we think is achievable...we’re feeling pretty good.” Says both pathways outlined by CDC are feasible by July. https://twitter.com/SquawkStreet/status/1387796880676073483"
"Also remember we haven't made a penny in a year, So $26 isn't that bad is it :)"
"Vaccination pace picked up and in April, CDC should revise its guidance to start sailing in May imo. If they do, this should blow past 30 in no time :)"
"As a veteran of eight cruises, three to the Mediterranean, we have a cruise booked on HAL to Hawaii next January. I love cruises and HAL is our only cruise line, but I am very skeptical of boarding a cruise ship in the near future. I am 23 years older from when we took our first cruise. Too many unknowns now. I have owned CCL years ago and sold out. I recently bought just a 100 shares for $49, just before the mess started. A 4% yield was very attractive then. I watched this sink, government suggesting no cruising, horror stories of ships looking for ports. I sold for $27, the first loss ever taken in my rollover IRA, seeing nothing positive in the short term. Now in the $11 range, it was a good move to sell. How COVAD-19 plays out is, IMHO, will be the deciding factor of the cruise industry for the next three years or so. Cruise lines will have to do significant discounts to fill ships and profits will be squeezed. Of course, $11 offers a larger potential for making money and the downside risk is less."
It’s better to sell before the earnings
I don’t need to cruise again! I can know afford my own yacht!
Gapping down as I told ya yesterday before close. Its in free fall mode. Next stop in single digits. It will happen fast
Interesting $CCL didn't use the earnings call and ER as an opportunity to push the sailing dates out like $NCLH. That's material information and they would be required to make public ~72 hrs after confirmed. Does CCL believe they will be able to sail prior to October?
"At their current market cap and stock price, the new dilution of 62.5mil shares at $8 brings their stock price to $8.80 (technically where it ended today before AH) if all the shares are purchased. Until the shares are completely purchased (giving it til April 6th) the stock price will likely drop several points maybe to 4 before going back up to the current price"
"Although the vaccine is good news, CCL stock price isn't going back to pre-covid levels anytime soon.CCL is going to miss out on an entire years worth of revenue, they issued billions in debt at 8.5%+ interest which will be paid back via future profits, they diluted shares with an offering at $7.50 and sold a few ships. On top of that, the vaccine will take almost a year to distribute to the masses meaning CCL might miss out on two years of revenue.Be smart, don't let your FOMO cost you money!"
"Just for info:- I own 100 shares for on board credit purposes. I also have 3 cruises booked in the next year. I love cruising and will go back to it, but still feel this stock goes lower. Honest opinion."
Multiple reports that the Travel Sector will recover and surpass 2019 by Fall 2021!

Vaccine will be approved tomorrow. I will buy more.
BREAKING NEWS: Gilead Life sciences just failed first trial of a vaccine for coronavirus. Looks like it is more complicated to make a vaccine than expected.
"I imagine the cruise industry leadership was waiting for the judge to rule on lifting the CSO, now fully vaccinated cruises will pressure Desantis to allow those type cruises in FL, and CCL appears to be going the non-vaccinated route (didn't want to alienate half their customer base and they want to maximize profits). I believe the CDC has given them an assurance about allowing restart in July; otherwise, they wouldn't be using the capital to prepare the ships and recall staff. It's looking good for the LONGS!"
"I'm going to do a quick post to my fellow retail investors, that are not shills for some hedge group or bots, but just average folks trying to set up a potion. What I've noticed for over a month $NCLH, $CCL, and $RCL, really, all Covid-19 impacted stocks, airlines, casinos, etc, but specifically the cruise stocks have been on a down trend. For the last month, especially the last few weeks, they have been trading on very low volume. $NCLH, whcih I have been watching very carefully, has been acting like it has found strong support around 13 a share, and appears to be re-coupled mostly with the market. Why does it matter?I suspect we're seeing a bottom for these stocks, or somewhere near it, and we're going to see a trend change soon, and it will be on full daily volume. Why? I suspect the downward sell pressure in these stocks are weak retail longs selling off, and not institutional investors. Why are they weak and retail? ...because the drop has been painful, but the pain is short term, and it's mostly retail as institutions still hold close to 90% of these stocks. Why short term? Because Covid-19 cannot physically last forever, based on the data. Why do I say that? ...because I've been watching the numbers. The numbers of cases growing, some of the hotspot states, like Florida, California, even Arizona, appear, to be leveling off. I really don't understand why, if it's legitimate or manipulation, and why it isn't being more talked about in the media. Yes, the overall numbers of cases is bad, it's ...really bad. But it's not ""as bad"" as it was a week ago, or two weeks ago, or three weeks ago in some of the states that are supposed to be out of control. As investors, we trend to recognize these trends. If you don't believe me, just google it for yourself. It's like unemployment, it's bad, but, arguably, it's less bad than it was the week prior, and the week before that. When the cases went down before, we saw a HUGE upsurge in these stocks Covid-19 impacted stocks. Then the cases went up and these stocks started to drop...but now, they are going down again. Again, check yourself, let the numbers convince you. This time, we will have both declining cases and vaccines around the corner, no less than five promising candidates in Phase III human trials with results due Oct/Nov. There's also ENORMOUS political pressure to leak positive vaccine results to the markets before the US election, for obvious reasons. I'm not telling you what to do with you money, and I'm not saying this isn't all ""baked"" in. I don't think it is, as new agencies are just now starting to pick it up. You make your own call. I reposition more heavily in some of these Covid-19 stocks myself. I'm only typing this as it's fun to chat about stocks, but also just in case, it gives some investor out there like me another puzzle piece to add to their own strategy. Hope this helps. Here's a site to start with:https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/16/816707182/map-tracking-the-spread-of-the-coronavirus-in-the-u-s"

Appears Pfizer's & BioNtech's vaccine may the first and only to be FDA approved and fielded by end of the year. Recovery is inevitable. Do you know what else is inevitable? CCL's stock value skyrocketing when the news of a vaccine is announced.
"UNITED $UAL is now preparing for a recovery with vaccine distribution picking up.“And as the end of the pandemic nears and vaccines continue to roll out, today’s fleet announcement helps position us to meet the demand we expect to see in 2022 and 2023 and puts us on a path toward more opportunities for our employees in the future,” wrote Nocella.Boeing and United’s shares were each up close to 4% in morning trading during a broad market rally.$LUV $AAL $CCL $GE"
The possible closure of US Ports to cruise ships is beginning to be factored into all of the cruise line stocks. The entire industry will just need to take a few months off. Try to save the Alaska season. :-)

"I am neither long, nor short, CCL. But I am interested in investor psychology and why people buy and sell stocks (although for some reason, most never sell until it's WAY too late). Regardless, here's an excellent article that actually will teach you something if you care to 'study up':https://finance.yahoo.com/news/suckers-stock-market-rally-122402728.html"
Only the cruises that repositioned from highly infected areas had the virus which was passed on though nearly all crew members.There were 21 cases of COV19 and only 2 were infected passengers.

"Nice and steady, Bouncing off support nicely every time."
CCL will have better revenue as they added new ships.....as well as pent up demand once they start. More WFH would lead to more cruising.
Low $11s buy- sell $13..
"I don't think that stock price will move that much tomorrow, everything is known already: burning cash waiting for better days, that will come anyway."
Going up this week. Strong buy!
"UP TO 100 day. Depending on a couple other factors, it could be as early as May!"
I got in at $14 and now regret I should've sold it at $20 a few weeks back. Sold today at $17 in the morning. I highly doubt this will go up from $17 after today's news. The price till last week was based on the assumption that CCL will start cruises but they have paused it by 1 quarter more. I highly doubt it now. It doesn't justify price of $17 right now. It will fall back to $10-$11 and stabilize before any new positive announcement comes up.

"no way cruise lines, CCL in particular, will go to BK. They can stop all the operations, fire all the stuff, etc. but they have more than enough liquidity. This turmoil with Covid will be over in 2 months and then it will take several months more to start a business recovering. CCL stock will recover much earlier. On a separate notice: Covid is a flu and until 20-25% of population passes through it it won't be over. It is a law. Hype will be over long before an actual cases stop. do you know how many people currently have a regular seasonal A flu though a pick of season already away? Believe me much more than those tested positive in Corona."
Mr. No on this board needs to GO!!!! Thumbs UP if you agree!!!
"Carnival needs a new CEO. He goes on CNBC a few weeks ago and talks up their future. A few weeks later after the stock rises to around $22-23 he unloads a few million dollars worth. Now the stock is down and will continue to go down until they get a CEO who puts his money where his mouth is.he estimated Net Worth of Arnold W Donald is worth at least $61.3 Million dollars as of January 14th 2021. Mr. Donald owns over 62,639 units of Carnival plc stock worth over $3,053,048 and over the last 17 years he sold CUK stock worth over $47,114,808. In addition, he makes $11,149,500 as President, Chief Executive. The rich get richer!"
New cancellation policy announced by Princess last night. They Finally have figured out this is their Tylenol Moment........Too bad it took them this long to help out their loyal customers. Looks like I will be getting a 100% cruise credit. That’s nice. :-)
26-27 is a Rock-bottom for this stock. And it won't be that cheap for more than a few hours. Great buying opportunity
Watch out. MMs are playing games. No way CCL should be up right now.
"Today it?s probably another red day for the whole market. Every single article I?ve seen this morning is about the cruise industry?s woes with the CDC, about how airlines won?t survive, about how bad Apple is and that they have sold their soul to the Chinese, about the chip shortage, about growth being paralyzed because interest rates are going to be so high. OMG, the sky is falling kind of articles. It?s not, and I?m not selling #$%$ ?"
"Florida Sues CDC, Demanding Cruise Ships Be Allowed To Sail"

CCL ships in Galveston will be ready to resume immediately after the injunction (May/June)! cruises)!"
Who cares. $60 is my exit point. Everything else is just chatter.

would investors lose everything if CCL files for bankruptcy? I have never invested in a company that went bankrupt just wondering about the consequences to investors just in case. Any thoughts?
"Ppl keep talking and no one has really thought about this. Trump said he would help! yet in stimulus one he did not, then stock is released at 8 in which alot of ppl bought including heads in carnival. Have you guys stopped to think those that say bankrupt why would they buy. I have an answer for you. Bc its not going to go bankrupt and in stimulus 2 help will come not that they need it bc they raised enough funds until next year. You realize the btm was hit and this will not go back down."
Anybody have an idea as to where the stock price will have to hit to trigger a dividend halt?

Another public offering. Honestly it’s getting to the point where I think this company is becoming worthless between all their high interest debt and share dilution the past year. It could take 10 years before they fix the balance sheet. I’d say forget about a dividend until 2030 and maybe beyond
"Let's try this one. You and your family are in the process of boarding. One (or more), in your group tests positive. Who is denied boarding? Just the one(s), who test positive? Is a refund offered? And this group just flew in from Iowa. LOTS to be worked out here before guests feel comfortable cruising again!!!"
Florida governor is helping the cruise industry. They will make this happen before November 1st. Buying more on monday. The cdc has a lot of pressure on them.

Carnival Cruise Line is issuing $1.25 billion of stock and taking on nearly $5 billion of additional debt. Why is the stock up? Just doesn't add up
Who cares what the earnings are? All I care about is opening up the cruise industry. Profits will come then. Daaa!!!

Shorts biting their nails waiting for Power Hour..
"Basically we know that once, they are not bankrupt, they are worth something. Then ... if something is worth 50 in 2 years, or 3 ... it's worth 35 or 40 now. They are in a business that has huge barriers to entry ... .We just had a pandemic ... and people were sick ... or died .. and the solution is comming. They have the cash to survive and to sail again. So the market is playing that ... and readjusting the value. Some do not believe in the solution, others are still with the head in the bag ... because they see sickness progressing. As people will emerge from that ... they will start changing their mind. This is what we witness here.CCL NCLH .... airliners as well. These people are not dead. it's called the going concern."
"My CCL strategy is still working- bought @ 10, then 8. Sold half @15, then set a limit-down sell @15. Then buy back some ~13 to 14.. Now it's back to limit sell @15. I'm playing on house, or rather boat money now.. I'll eventually use it for a nice cruise, a stern cabin with a panoramic view..%^ )"

hear that CARNIVAL is bringing two of their ships to Galveston in preparation for the ok from CDC. to GALVESTON
"20's in May...steady , gradual opening up of the world. 30's in June..."
Up $1.50 and only 24 mil traded.....More buyers than sellers....Very good sign
"SERIOUSLY, why are the SHORTS so quite today? Do they see all the positive catalysts for summer sailing and feel hopeless!"
"Who does this sound like?The Presence of Stock Bashers in Online ForumsStock bashing often occurs in online investing platforms, and as such bashers can be difficult to identify and eradicate due to anonymity tactics on the internet.As the internet has made participation in the stock market more accessible to more people, new investors emerging in the market are especially vulnerable to the tactics of stock bashers, and many investor boards exist to attempt to track perpetrators.Though notoriously difficult to track, some bashers have been identified and prosecuted, and from time to time confessional essays about the tactics of bashers emerge online, although these essays are typically also either anonymous or pseudonymous.Many investors speculate that the behavior of bashers tends to follow certain patterns, including a tendency for bashers to only bash stocks which are generally trending upwards and showing potential."
I bought some stocks at $14.65 . Considering cruise won’t run for next 2 month. What do you guys suggest . Should I keep it or sell it . What should be my price target buy n sell .
"The bonds issued today had a coupon of 12.5%, may be better than the common stock."
"2 levels of resistance, one here at $26.54 (hence the drop EOD yesterday)The next above this is $27.64. So maybe not expect this to go higher than £27.64 today unless we see huge volume, which has been missing this week. But need to break this resistance here first.Good luck longs."
Simple wallstreet say this stock worth 9$ why anyone would buy this stock? Cruising haven't been starting yet and it's trading over priced.
when stock price going up sharply and the company loosing money usually there are consequences
The technical chats are ON !!!!
"Carnival hasn't even begun to sell the 90,000,000 shares...OMG"
THERE IS NO WAY THE NO-SAIL ORDER WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL NOV.1. NO WAY!!80% OF THE U.S. WILL BE VACCINATED BY JUNE. NO WAY! WE WILL BE SAILING AGAIN IN JULY WITH VACCINATED PEOPLE.
"CCL loss $2Billion and we go up 3 %....had we lost$7 Bil ,we would have gone up 10%?I can't do this math! lol"
"Very tempted to load up on some additional July call contracts! It's about to BLAST OFF TO $40 once CDC gives green light to sailing (Royal CEO expects it very soon) and they are getting major PRESSURE TOO since airlines, casinos, arena's, etc.. are open! Many Singapore and Mediterranean cruises have proven cruising can be safely done even without a vaccine! If the CDC doesn't approve soon, the Cruise Lines will have no other choice but to file lawsuits (then the CDC's hypocrisy can be shown to all)!"
Where will the price be in 5 years?
"So, they are not sailing until at least September and probably longer. Let's play with the numbers a bit.At todays close of $17.83, the market cap is $13.943 B(billion).If they are loosing $650M per month, that is the equivalent of .65/13.943 of the $17.83 share per month. That works out to a loss of about 83 cents per share per month.So, by late September, 3 months out, expect stock at $15.35.If not sailing another 3 months to the end of the year...brings it to $12.85.Things go up and down, but the trend of loosing $650 million per month, month after month, should be clear in respect to the stock price. No matter how much someone ""loves cruising"" will not change that.The opinions are my own."

yield has come down as the price of CCL shares has gone up. undervalued still.
Barker investors have been advised to buy. Supply and demand for cruising in the 12 to 36 months will steadly climb to pre pandemic numbers. Pent up demand and roll out of vaccinations has given the industry a boost.
Why invest Long in any of these right now? https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/12/stock-markets-bounce-back-cruise-ship-stocks-2020/What's the urgency $NCLH $CCL $RCL? None of them will have moving ships any time in the near future.
Not buying till it drop under $20/share. Q1 and Q2 reports are likely huge loss.
"Looking at this chart, I really think there is some potential in carnival.https://wallmine.com/nyse/ccl/charts"
"Lot's of short term views here. CCL will be over $50 in 2-3 years. Pent up demand will drive profits higher than ever before. Sure, sell now and get back in lower, maybe, or hold and triple your return with patience."
I don’t mean to be the troll. But COVID has been rising everywhere in the world. No way in hell these cruise liners will be back in business. I will be buying the stock at 15$ once you guys all run for the hills as cruise ships go down till next spring
CCL finishing green today...and shorty knows it!
The chart pattern is closer to symmetrical or ascending triangle rather than the divergence

"Travelers are looking for 'safe, outdoor, open spaces' when planning their next vacation: SimilarWeb's Alisha Kapur.You should watch this video on yahoo finance. You can skip to 5:13 where they discuss cruising and Carnival in specific.

"On pace to have above average volume! CCL ACCUMULATION by Pension Funds, Mutual Funds, etc.."

Up $.60+ cents today $2.65 in a week $1.04 in a month $6.96 three months $14.02 one year Let that sink in!!!!!
"It is so ironic when some CCL share holders brag about any analyst's upgrades, while at the same time downplay & discredit any analysts downgrades or reduction in shares' target price. You cannot have it both ways!"

"Just checked carnivals website. All June and July sailing are removed, can’t book them anymore. Probably see announcement soon about postponing cruising out again"

There is no FUTURE without either a vaccine or a miracle. And the time IS running out.
Airlines and cruise lines are going to skyrocket. Inevitable. People are going to travel. Business will travel. Might sell off some of my slow burn tech stocks to get on this and $CL know we will see $aal at $45-50 by mid 2021 and $CCL same story.We all knew travel would be the last to rise from the grave.Double down folks
"Joe is gettin it done! Sleeves rolled up and vaccines in arms! Hold on folks, CDC has granted test voyages, CSO will lift in the weeks ahead!CCL = Strong Buy!"
"Be a smart long term CCL investor. Ignore shorts yapping those old stories here: debts, bankruptcy, dilution, etc. Focus on the bright future of CCL!"
"$20 a share, with no cruises in nearly a year, Loads of debt, no revenue and burning through 500m a month.Easy $100+ per share when they get going again. Rest easy Longs. :)"
"After the Dr Fauci interview yesterday where he discussed the substantial percentage of covid carriers with no symptoms and their ability to infect others, it should be clear that cruising will not really be safe until a vaccine is available and taken by a large percentage of the population. Screening the cruise ship departure point for people with symptoms will not catch asymptomatic passengers and crew. Once the ships sail, the more extensive cleaning will slow but not stop the spread and we'll once again have infected ships with no port to go to. Thus, a realistic investor should adjust his ""resume sailing"" expectations to a point where vaccine is likely available. Probably not before next year. Til then, the companies will be burning through borrowed cash.That's how I see it. The sailing fanboys aren't going anywhere for quite a while."
"I have a Buy Order in at $24.50 to protect the bottom. If I start buying “Pumpty Dumpty” again, I am selling more at highs."
good time to buy more under $60
"The problem with CDC is all they care about is infection #'s and vaccinations. I guarantee that the demand is there to cruise right now. We need to open everything up and let people make informed decisions. We've been doing this for almost a year. Lockdowns don't work. Let's keep vaccinating, wearing masks, whatever you need to do, but we have to open up now!"
Sorry but the CDC once again did not approve sailing and instead issues many more procedures just to get to another phase of still not sailing . Do you people read the news???
All Aboard the CCL MONEY TRAIN!!!!Strong BUY!!!
Johnson & Johnson will resume vaccinations. Sailing sooner then later.
Next week SHORTS......
Everyone I know is cancelling their cruises. Anyone else hearing the same?
Hey Shorts.........CCL Gone GREEN!!CCL = STRONG BUY!!!
"when will wallst realize cruise industry is not the same as airline travel, and will not bounce back like the airlines do?"
Ccl has like 500mil in free cash. for your health
Are we holding on selling before the Earnings on 4.07.2021???
"Bottoms in. Will never see $10 again. Typical jp Morgan trick, funny how they added to their CCL position on the day they reduced price target. Just waiting for the catalyst now that sees this flies into the $20 range in a few days."
Who is actually looking out 2-3 years on this thing. gonna be a cash cow on the dividend
Buy now or Tomorrow? Do yall think we have hit the bottom?
"This stock will keep drifting down. The hype of sailing resuming is over. Now it's about the size of debt and how long it will take Carnival to recover. The math is very simple here. X amount of ships times the amount of cruises per year times the number of max passengers. The results is about 12 years to recover - if nothing goes wrong. This is not a tech or pharma company that produce new products, so there is no hope to accelerate the recovery. At best they can buy another ship but that comes with a high price and years to pay off. Smart money began exiting yesterday and will continue to exit. Better stocks out there instead of parking their money for endless years with this one."
"I used to go on one or two cruises a year for the past 30 years. Probably won't be going on another cruise for a long while. Not worth the risk, especially when people are not going to vaccinate. Time to go tour the National Parks instead like the rest of America."
What time is earnings before or after ?
The CEO of Carnival just sold half his shares. That’s not a good sign. Get out before it’s too late.
"Do we know if CCL even has the capacity to be viable, if there is a booking crush? Sold ships, won’t sail full immediately, ??Longs may see a real world, math driven, plateau. Somewhere South of expectations."
CCL climbing higher today folks! Great buying opportunity!!!
Here we go...... CCL coming in to Florida port https://youtu.be/u5gVn7124Lk
Be Careful here
soon CCL will be trading negative like oil. Why are people focusing on non essential business like cruise lines doomed for failure in the next 2 years. Many better businesses are on sale.
and what happened with earnings call ? lol will drop

I bought CCL at $11.60 and plan to hold it long term. I also day trade the stock and sold it yesterday for $14.35 missing out on the premarket gains. Plan to buy back in at $15.15 and ride it till it hits around for $16.
Year sure all of the cruise lines are going to go out of business. These bears and shorts are funny at best today. The lower it goes for these companies is just a better opportunity to own. Best to not give them away to these clowns that want them at a lower price is all.
Remember chipotle incident? It took a year to recover from that. It takes long to regain the trust and safety from customers.
CCL is again outperforming Royal & NCLH! It appears they are much more engaged with CDC on restart plans!
"Anyone selling here is betting that people won't cruise after the virus crisis.While it is your right to believe it, don't come whining on this board in 6 months when stock trades at $26Remember my post !"
With a lot of our navy ships coming down with COVID I just wonder if they’ll have a do not sail order ( very seriously doubt it)
"The UK is ""past the peak"" of the current wave of the pandemic but infection rates are still high, England's chief medical officer says.Prof Chris Whitty said the number of cases, hospitalizations and deaths were on a ""downward slope"" but that did not mean there would not be another peak.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55924149"
"Folks I'm short CCL near term. I will start covering soon. My concern is what the long term effect on both the economy and business in general. I have heard several double digit forecasts for unemployment rates. I have read all of your posts and many here seem to think that once the virus has passed it will business as usual. Many companies are maxing out their credit lines to weather the crashing shut downs they now face. I never read any thoughts about job destruction, recession, depression or a mistrust in the Carnival/Cruise business due to the unfortunate virus news. I owned business in a quaint, trendy part of my city. We experienced heaving flooding for 4 weeks when the river levee broke. I was able to clean up and reopen in 3 weeks, what I did not anticipate was the public's perception that the streets just washed everything away. Business slowly returned at about 40% for the next 6 months then 80 to 90% at the end of the 1st year. This is the reality of human nature. Europe is getting pounded also. Many here need to lower their projections a notch or two."

Congrats to the shorts who got in over $30.
Thumbs up for another positive day tomorrow
"After hours green is just some dead cat bounce. Make no mistake about it this is horrible for this industry. I live in Miami and I passed by the bridge to South Beach at around 5:30 PM yesterday when the ships leave and they looked half empty or less.1. A huge portion of the people that go on cruises are older than 55.2. They will have to cut dividends.3. There's fear of getting the virus4. There's fear of not getting the virus but losing several days in case of quarantine5. There are travel restrictions in place already.6. Not a lot of cash in hand7. Big debt8. Who knows how bad earnings will be and most likely a horrific forecast.For those of you saying that more people have died this year from the flu, that's very irresponsible. Sure more people have died but also common flu viruses have been all over the world for years. This thing has killed +3400 worldwide (that we know of) and it wasn't even outside of a city two months ago. Young and healthy people most of the time barely have cold like symptoms but for the elderly that's a whole different story. The 2% dead rate is a lot higher when those older than 65 get it. That's reason enough for many people to avoid going on a cruise. My mother who goes on two a year, already decided not to go.Lower oil prices cannot cover for ships not even getting 800 reservations."
"I just don't see this stock going much lower. Theatre stocks are booming right now. I suspect cruising is a little behind going to movies in terms of people's comfort level. With that being said, CCL is a good company and a money machine. They'll recover eventually... As to when, who knows."
"vaccinated, booked two CCL cruises, both cancelled will wait til 2022 to see if schedules hold and won't be cancelled because of Covit"
AIDA to resume cruises in November to canaries and Mediterranean. The good news keeps coming think we see $20-$30 next few weeks. Already up nearly 3% pre-market. So could see easily another 5-10% day. Market depending of course. Good luck.
Here comes the power hour.
I thought about starting a position in travel/leisure stocks but I'm not convinced prepandemic travel will recover in anything less than a decade.
"$CCL $RCL $NCLH CNBC “cases are dropping significantly“ ”we could be below 5,000 cases a day next week” “That’s not only here in the US, that’s worldwide.” "
"CCL Earnings DateEarnings announcement* for CCL: Jan 08, 2021Carnival Corporation is estimated to report earnings on 01/08/2021. The upcoming earnings date is derived from an algorithm based on a company's historical reporting dates. Our vendor, Zacks Investment Research, might revise this date in the future, once the company announces the actual earnings date. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 6 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $-1.79. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $0.62."
Yeah they are starting to resume cruises BUT....The issue is that $CCLand $RCL will still be bleeding money. Ladened with loads of debt. Coupled with negative cash flow for another year. The valuation just isn’t very attractive. This run up was a gift for longs. Earnings will pop the rally as all good news is already priced in. Short 2500 @ 28.35 $CCL $PT 22
"If you sold today ,that's how you look tomorrow."
"What is so amazing is that they will likely have lost 10 billion plus when it is all said and done. In addition, they will have taken on 10 billion in debt and issued additional equity. The shareholder equity in the assets have been cut in half from 37 to 19. It will likely take 4 to 5 years to make it back."
Its done. Carnival will likely order 2 million tests per year from Abbot Labs. CDC has no choice but to lift NO SAIL order. We be Sailing!
"CDC is saying, if they allow cruises to sail in July/August. Each passenger will have to show they tested negative for COVID19 24hrs prior to the cruise. These new rules are ridiculous. Everyone has to wear mask. If any of these rules are broken you're removed from the ship, at your expense."
"Too many countries fully depend on the revenue from these ships,,they aren’t going anywhere but up"
Entire market red until Feds release at 3pm est. they raise rates market will correct 20% Carnival has a lot of debt and the CEO doesn’t know if the company will ever be profitable again. Sold 20% of the boats.
Holding for the inevitable breakout that’s on the horizon. You’ll never see these prices again.
Enjoy this time. Will go touch 35 buck in this week.
"Longs, think about it. What matters more: the fact that the mortality rate remains relatively low (thank God it does)? OR, the fact that nobody is going to want to go on a 3 week vacay they didn’t plan for with 2000 of their best friends cooped up at sea?"
Green by close!
"COVID vaccines are now everywhere, just like flu vaccines. The epidemic is over."
Should be another ruff week for Ccl sell on open and short it
A $20 stock selling for $28....and it was just diluted. What did you expect???? The Ships are sinking slowly.

David made the right call to short it but then saw the pre-market and switched to long. hehehehehe David David David. For once that you had a good call you had to f it up.

"Hey Shorts? Including @Harry Bawls What happened to all the CCL is definately going bankrupt talk? We have not been blessed with that for over a month. @Harry Bawls gave up the @Issay and @Bill alias's and poof just like you don't hear much about Coronavirus now that the election is over you don't hear much about the imminent ""guaranteed bankruptcy""."
"Shorts see the pre market... You better cover before your Brokage gives you a ""call""...."
The US state department is to advise Americans to avoid 80% of countries worldwide because of the coronavirus pandemic.Not good news for cruise lines.
"If the US is serious about containing the Coronavirus......cruising is one of the no-brainer areas to consider. None of the cruise lines can screen out Coronavirus Positive passengers who have no symptoms, but who still might be contagious. This is a real Pickle. People who live in port cities should be very concerned."

"Cautiously optimistic now that the first vaccine doses were given to health care workers today. I’m ready to cruise, are you?"
"CCL is not going BK. Theme parks are reopening, so will cruises. The market recognizes this and is moving toward a post-crisis reset of CCL price. That reset is clearly in the $25-30 range. We take out $20 this week."
"Everyone knows cruise ships are the cleanest place to social gather. He made a great point that it's everyone that's suffering not just the cruise lines. As for being last to Open, I fully agree with him, if the countries are fine excepting cruises to dock, id feel much safer on a cruise than going to any other social gathering. Cruises should be one of the first allowed to start Up.If the countries and ports allow cruises then they should be able to go. At the end of the day the people that had co vid didn't get it on board it was from people getting on from the mainland. They should be congratulated that more people didn't succumb to this due to there high hygiene protocol."

"Somehow no one posted this yesterday.CDC Cruise Rules May Be Just Days Away; Volunteer Sailings Next?February 22, 2021""We're just literally waiting,"" said Michael Bayley, president and CEO of Royal Caribbean International, of technical regulations expected from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that will provide a clear path for cruise lines to operate again in the U.S.Having issued the Framework for Conditional Sailing Order for Cruise Ships in late October, the CDC has yet to release referenced technical regulations which will define a return to service.Those regulations now may just around the corner, according to Bayley, who said it could be coming in days, speaking on Royal Caribbean's year-end and fourth quarter business update call on Monday morning. The next step is then trial sailings with volunteers cruising, Bayley noted, adding the company had seen some 250,000 volunteer sign ups. Bayley noted the communication and dialogue between the industry and the CDC has been productive, and it has been a relatively open process."
"IMHO: Just to state the obvious .... a continual increase in debt will make this company unprofitable for years. Yes, the increased debt may keep them in business (I hope it does), but it has to be paid back in coming years. Otherwise, bankruptcy. Unlike airlines, there is no government entity to bail them out. As the shutdown continues to be extended with no reliable indication of a end date for cruise lines (previous reopening plans have proven to be unreliable), it will require even more debt to be issued at increasingly unfavorable rates. With all these obvious facts ... how is there any support level the this stock, and for that matter, all other cruise line stocks? Maybe it is a good play for day traders ... but for long term investment, the stock price needs to drop even more to reflect the actual risk involved."
"wow can't believe this price action, happy fot it, but be shocked if doesn't pull back under 18 sometime"
Looking at several of posters past posts on this board it looks like all they do is trash CCL. Shorts do nothing but tell lies.
"RECOVERY IS IMMINENT!!! RETURN TO NORMALCY IS WITHIN WEEKS, AND THAT'S WHY THE CDC IS NOT RESPONDING TO THE CRUISE LINE INDUSTRY. THEY ARE LETTING STATE GOVT'S DICTATE THE RETURN TO NORMALCY ON THEIR OWN. RECOVERY IS IMMINENT! IMMINENT!! JUNE 1ST."
The rally was priced in big investors know the financials aren’t going to be good for years to come they will drain the swamp and bring this down while everyone will run we can see Ccl trading below 24 if the charts are right

"Earnings rapport whil not bring te price down , maybe 1 $ haha.From now end next summer only we is up .Maybe a couple op days little bid red but .Only positiv news is coming next months ."
"Everyone knows this is a risky stock. High risk high reward just like most oil plays right now. It's still has sever3 months before anything big happens. But in about 2 months when phase 3 results come in for vaccine, it'll be make or break I think. Until then, I would hold. Bullish for now."
I for one never understood all the popularity for going on cruises. I do know this. The people that do like them can not wait to get back on one. COVID or not.
"According to TSA, 1.4 million people flew yesterday. People are starting to move about. Lockdownrestrictions are being eased. Vaccinations are heading towards 25% of adult population.Pressure to allow cruises builds. This little trickle will become a dam burst with warmer weather."
"I think yahoo’s 1 year target estimate sums it up.No sailings, bleeding money.Will recover in years to come.But will drop more short term."
"On top of the $518 million in cash it already had on hand, Carnival tapped its entire $3 billion credit facility, and it is trying to raise over $6 billion in stock and debt. However, Carnival said it needs about $1 billion a month to keep operating, according to an April 3 securities filing."
"Will close in green today, pullback is over. We're on the way back to 30"
"Solid day, Finished exactly on that resistance I mentioned a while ago. Charts look promising. Gap up tomorrow could be nice, but options expire tomorrow and this price here is kind of a sweet for most of them expiring worthless. So might not see much tomorrow unless news etc."
this will back to $20 since vaccination can not protect you 100% from virus.
In the future you won’t hear about coronavirus on a ship… You’ll just hear a splash around 3 AM￼
"Once we return to work, people will start booking cruises like mad.My parents are in Florida and just waiting to take their transatlantic cruise.Lots of folks are starving for some adventure and an outing!"
Next year will be a lot better. Happy new year everyone.
CCL Rocket Launch soon!
well. I did think this was massively overvalued when they diluted 1 billion dollars worth of shares @ $25.10 and then thereafter they delayed more cruises which almost guaranteed the 1 billion dollars that they raised would be burned through as well. So dilution plus guaranteed cash burn.. I'm not surprsied at all if this drops much further to discount the risk and dilution
"Interesting day ahead, Something is brewing here, looking super bullish on everything I look at. Only real major resistance (check chart back to 2010) is in the $29 range. Interesting to see how this plays out. Volume would be great to see to confirm this bullish breakout. Not financial advice but my spidey senses are tingling. (they aren't always 100% correct either) lol. Good luck today whichever way you choose to trade."
"Graph looks perfect ,will shot up to 32.7$ next level."
I actually think that a contained environment would be the safest way to travel IF everybody was tested prior to boarding. Your safer on a ship of 500 people who have a negative result and no fever ... than you are at the grocery store
Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover) : 1.8;Short Percent of Float: 28.41 %CCL is prime for a strong short squeeze. Buy and hold. Enjoy a free ride of this massive short squeeze to $25 next week.
Barrons article on cruiselines was interesting and eye opening for me.....CUK has more than doubled there debt during the pandemic while increasing there share count about 50%....anyupside is limited from here and clearly more downside risk remains.
How do people invest in cruise ships and doubt the airlines? lmao i don't get it. Airlines are essential businesses people need hence why airlines are still operating and increasing their flights and cruises are still banned.
Here is my take: This is a great long story and it will recover and go back to its previous covid stock price. This is a short term market and after many years of reviewing analyst ratings and their analyst I have found that Morgan Stanley has been shorting this stock since the beginning of this year and is negative on this industry this year. They downgrade stocks for their own interest and are trying to recover their position. Good luck to all.
"I shorted Thursday but got chicken and took a small token in profit. Now I see about 80% profit in a couple days, had I stayed short. I was 3 times margin, so 2.3 times, 3.4 or so times my original stash. Bad move. Stops are sacred if you use them instead of creating a big panic and not being able to think straight. There was a reason I shorted it in the first place. I was thinking it would likely made it down toward 12 and it did. Live and learn."
"someone just bought 50,000 shares at 11.70."
"For those with comprehension issues, development and production of vaccines specially against the new variants of the coronavirus means that we now have to wait a few months for a new vaccine (also called ""booster"") and then begin a new vaccination campaign which will take months to complete. In other more simple words, we are back to square one before even completing square one. This cycle of vaccination campaign followed by a ""booster"" could repeat itself for months and years."
"UBS Upgrades Carnival to Buy, Raises Price Target to $42UBS analyst Robin M. Farley upgrades Carnival (NYSE:CCL) from Neutral to Buy and raises the price target from $20 to $42.· 03/18/2021 06:32"
"Bookings are up all over and the cdc is in the works of updating cruise guidelines to get the industry going per the miami dade mayor. Time to cruise, baby!"
"More explanation as why CCL is going higher.Carnival has a solid balance sheet The good news is that Carnival is well equipped to survive in a low-revenue environment until restrictions are lifted. That's because the company has a respectable pile of cash on its balance sheet and has drastically reduced its expenses. Carnival raised a combined $6.4 billion in debt and equity financing to help shore up its liquidity. On top of that, the company has announced a combination of layoffs, reduced workweeks, and salary reductions that are expected to save hundreds of millions of dollars annually. According to CEO Arnold Donald, Carnival has enough liquidity to meet all its obligations in a zero-revenue environment for the rest of 2020, which would be a worst-case scenario. Arnold further states that 2021 cruise bookings are strong. And competitor Norwegian Cruise Lines reports that 2021 bookings are within historical ranges despite higher prices. This is important because the cruise industry will probably need to sail at reduced capacity to ensure safety onboard, which could lead to a situation where demand outstrips supply, giving the industry better pricing power.Carnival also plans to stagger fleet reentry to optimize its operations based on demand and doesn't expect any demand issues in the start-up period of operations."
"SHORTS beware, CCL can easily hit $30+ in 2-3 trading days! All the pieces are coming together for CCL to begin the cruise restart this summer and making $$$$$$! Also, most of the CDC rules will be lifted because by July, it's very likely we'll have herd immunity! Come November, the USA will no longer have a pandemic! Easy sailing Longs!"
"Shorts, buy and cover. Great economic data and strong travel data. This is a $60 gem. Hold for this massive short squeeze! Shorts try hard to convince you to sell, taking profit whatever. Old cliche. Just ignore them and hold this $60 gem."
easily 50 by end of the year
"If you look at the half full glass, longs can have some comfort knowing that they bought shares from top management. It might be worth some money when they go belly up. ""For sale 8,950 memorabilia shares dumped by the CEO himself. Best offer. Other shares from top insiders are available. For more info call or text. Ask for David""."
Shorts looking to cover...CCL is closing over $28
I told you all today would be down. Tomorrow will be down more. Be prepared. Have your funds ready.
"When America becomes normal this summer, it looks ridiculous that the cdc maintain the no sail order until November. They will be under tremendous pressure to let cruises sail."
4% inflation by 3rd week of April! CCL better off reorganize & start fresh!
People are already making vacation plans. I think the stock will do really well in the coming months.
I come on here to read Christopher's posts since he is the only one that knows what he is talking about.
Looks like someone just bought more CCL...
WE TOLD YOU !
Cruise stocks are about to take off Monday. I’m guessing 5-8% gains on Monday alone. $CCL $RCL $NCLH
"Homegamers....These Cruise line stocks are the ultimate Virus/Vaccine plays. That's why I MUSTBe in these, and Airline (LUV) stocks. MY BEST Trade EVER was on a 35K share NCLH Trade AMonth or so ago.. Bought @17.55. Sold a few days later (really) for 22.11. Approx 160K Trade.These stocks, and the Airlines Will ROCKET on Vaccine Type News. The Cruise Line stocks ALL have HUGE Short Positions... The Short Covering ADDS ROCKET Fuel to a Rise. We saw some of that,earlier today....."
Disclaimer - I am trading long-term call options on $CCL.
"What is the 40 cent bump, is this from the orange man saying in the news yesterday that we may have a vaccine much sooner than the end of the year?"
Also as a disclaimer. I own stock. I am also an avid cruiser. I also know people are defiantly ready to cruise when this us over. Prices are already rising for next year due to demand. Once this is over this business will be better then ever. Maybe merges/takeovers. But carnival will defiantly survive and see a stock price relative to where it was in years to come.Again good luck with whatever you choose todo with this stock.
"Let’s go. This is how the Brits do it! ..CLIA and UK Chamber of Shipping response to this morning's Global Travel Taskforce report...‘We welcome today’s announcement to restart international cruises alongside the wider resumption of international travel, in line with the “traffic light” system. ‘This announcement is the culmination of extensive collaboration between industry, government, health authorities and ports during the last 12 months to further strengthen health measures, which now go beyond any other travel sector. The industry’s protocols have already been tried and tested as almost 400,000 people have sailed on cruises since last summer elsewhere around the globe. ‘Today’s decision sends a signal of confidence in the industry and is a welcome boost to the thousands of people employed in the sector or whose livelihoods depend upon cruise, including travel agencies, hotels, tour guides, port operators and many other service providers up and down the country.’"
You heard it boys and girls! James Hardiman recap: “THEY WILL BE JUST FINE”CCL = $$$$$BUY BUY BUY
Come on CCL prove me wrong... BREAK $30 with volume!
Take a look at Carnivals website. They are now just registering new stock for future sale along with debt securities etc. that can be placed or offered down the road......not a good sign. I just received this via email.Here is the link.......hope Yahoo doesn't delete it ....if they do go to the Carnival website and look for Form S3......https://www.carnivalcorp.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/s-3asr/0001104659-21-007650Good luck......
Ccl won’t file for chapter 11. The company has cash in hand and can dilute its stock for more cash. Of course dilution can’t go on forever but luckily Pfizer vaccine will be approved next month. Fear of chapter 11 is unfounded.
"In trying to value CCL, one has to ask: How much is a company worth if it has negative profits, and their assets have zero value because no one would want to buy them?"
"I'm definitly not calling a bottom here, but cruise stocks are priced as though earnings will be zero for the next year or two. you really can't lose long term here unless every major player in the cruise industry goes bankrupt......seems outlandish to me"
By Dec this should go above $20.
"We have so many optimistic ""Experts"" on this board, that know more than J P Morgan & others who downgraded the stock. The ""Experts"" still believe the stock will rise to $50 or $60 within a year, despite all the debt, share dilution & ships that will sail at 1/2 to 2/3 capacity, at best."

Running out of Steam! GO UP CCL! GO UP!
This CCL stock is like skipping a slick rock across the water. it sure is fun and so predictable.
"""Trump may try to push through a vaccine before the November election to score a win in the eyes of voters, spurring concerns about safety and effectiveness. 'I think we’re coming up with some great answers,' Trump said in reference to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments on Wednesday afternoon. 'I think you’re going to have a big surprise, a beautiful surprise sooner than anybody would think.'"""
Large short sell off to knock price down since it was about to rocket. Now they can buy them back slowly and cheaper. Don’t sell longs it’s time to buy
The price action of CCL & NCLH is very disappointing.
"NEWS ALERT!Hicktown, South DakotaGMT: 9:07 AMHarry Bawls, AKA as Issay has #Shavedhisbawls.Now clean as a whistle and bought CCL long term."
"this should be trading under 20 but new investors will not know. only see chart for first time and buy in on this because ""recovery"" stock. i think if people really are not paying attention to fudnamentals of this stock then it will go up to 32 and carnival will do another 1 billion common share offering at around $30-32. They will time it so that it doesn't make share price volatile. You guys are going to be used as Carnivals atm machine. people will be unaware of additional float of common shares and people will forget eventually. plenty of new suckers enter the market everyday and this post will be gone with the wind."
"I did buy a few shares, very few based on the possibility of July sailings but have most of my money on the possibility of Chapter 11"
This stock is driven by fake news and pumpers
"@Wolf of Wall Street who will know is David. The former says he is long and ""David"" announced that he is short. Win win situation. Get a life David."
No volume...
shorters is giving a good discount price for CCL.
"Impressed how strong this is holding up considering the CDC said “impending doom” was upon us. It’s all theater at this point and nobody cares anymore. COVID cases were at 66,000 yesterday. Not the big surge the CDC was looking for."
Interesting announcement by the CDC about those who have been fully vaccinated and won’t need to be quarantined if exposed to covid. Could be a game changer for cruises.
"Perhaps, I am looking at things a little different than the typical investor. I dedicate my investments in dedicated buckets... I am considering investing into CCL as a substitute for a timeshare... My wife & I separately will buy enough share each to cover the cost of a two person cruise thru dividend payments. Basically we a prepaying an annual trip for life without being locked into a contract or fees...Additionally each of us would get a $250 on board credit for use with one of our kids...I realize there is a short risk of suspended dividends but I am a long term investor...Thoughts?"
"I am neither short nor long but this is a black swan event for the cruise industry, much like 2008 was for the financial industry, except there is not going to be a government bailout. Stay out, don't try to be a hero, don't try to catch the bottom. With ships docked idle and burning cash, bankruptcy is a real possibility if this situation drags on."
Think the analyst who downgraded was short?
"64m shares traded, and they can't bring it down during lunchtime. Interesting couple hours ahead..."
"The credits will out weight the debts of these leveraged companies. Stay positive the economy will have to jump start soon. Realistic people have had enough of the lock down bad decisions by fear factor government agencies. We want to live and have meaningful vacations, enjoy the world."

HAS ANYONE LOOKEDNAT PUTS CONTRACT FOR CCL? THERE'S ALMOST NON AVAILABLE! HEDGE FUNDS ARE GOING TO DRIVE CCL TO THE GROUND BEFORE JUNE. WRITE TO ME THEN AND TELL ME DIFFERENTLY..."
@Harry Bawlz - looks like a good call on those puts. Enjoy reading your posts.
CCL is still in the top 25 of WSB! Just imagine when it moves into the top 5 buy on list! ROCKET LAUNCH TIME!
alright this looks good. im in.
I heard about CCL the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"The company is expecting results from two other ongoing studies soon, one of which includes 2,400 coronavirus patients with ""severe disease"" from 152 different clinical trials sites around the world, and another including 1,600 patients with ""moderate disease"" at 169 clinical trial sites around the world.."
"CCL needs to go UP! Go UP! Somebody go over to WSB on reddit and tell them TARDs that CCL is an awesome buying opportunity! CCL is way better than GME! GME's business model is dead; whereas, once CCL is actually allowed to resume its business, their business is growing significantly in popularity (even CCL gift cards are at Krogers)!"

Back to March 26 high by tomorrow?
"The market cap is back to Dec 2019 levels and CCL has billions more in debt.Goldman Sachs has 40 million shares to sell and Carnival agreed to receive $25/share, so there is sell volume above $25.How high do you expect the market cap to go above pre-pandemic? And why?"
Hold CCL since $13
Things are looking real sunny for CCL.

"BIG NEWS! As I said in my last post.Shipyard workers preparing new Royal Caribbean ship Odyssey of the Seas test positive for COVID-19Morgan Hines, USA TODAYMon, March 8, 2021, 8:37 AMSix people who have been preparing Royal Caribbean's newest ship, Odyssey of the Seas, for sea trials have tested positive for COVID-19, Jonathon Fishman, spokesperson for Royal Caribbean Group, confirmed to USA TODAY on Monday.The ship is currently under construction in the Meyer Werft Shipyard in Papenburg, Germany. The team working there is preparing the ship for sea trials, according to Fishman. Sea trials are shakedown or test cruises, completed without paying passengers onboard, with the purpose of ensuring that everything is operating properly on a new vessel before it makes its official maiden voyage.""As part of the stringent protocols put in place by the shipyard, all shipyard workers and crew members must receive a negative PCR test result before boarding,"" Fishman said. ""Once on board, the ship conducts daily testing. This process allowed Meyer Werft to detect any possible COVID-19 cases and take the necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus.""Royal Caribbean's Odyssey of the Seas pictured in January 2021 outside of the Meyer Werft shipyard in Germany.Six shipyard workers tested positive and were quarantined on land ""immediately."" As of Monday, there were no positive cases onboard Odyssey of the Seas, Fishman said.Odyssey of the Seas is set to make its debut in May with departures from Israel with all passengers and crew over age 16 vaccinated, the ""first cruise that will offer ""fully vaccinated"" sailings, according to the cruise line.Originally supposed to sail in Rome before heading to Florida in November, the ship's launch in Israel marks the first time the cruise line will have sailings departing from that country, according to Royal Caribbean"
Great day. Up 10% Lets see what tomorrow brings.
"lol CCL is such an amazing day trade, just short the top and buy if it's close to red"
"Cruise Lines Under Pressure to Significantly Raise Ticket PricesMarch 06, 2021Cruise ships docked in NassauCruise companies may be eyeing a significant increase to ticket prices in the near future as demand surges and sailings sell out in record time.“Wall Street is not happy,” said one source familiar with the situation. “If cruises are flying off the shelves, the message from big investors has been to raise prices if inventory is selling too quickly … the companies are leaving too much money on the table.”Cruise lines have widely reported strong pent-up demand and record sales volumes in media announcements, leading to a backlash from the investment community.Carnival said sales were solid due to pent up demand in late February, and a few weeks earlier, Oceania saw its world cruise sell out in a single day.Victory Cruise Lines and American Queen Steamboat said that January and February 2021 bookings are over 35 percent higher than November and December 2020 bookings, according to a press release.The story is also good at Royal Caribbean Group, with bookings up 30 percent. $RCL $NCLH"
Impressive CEO. Handled the tough questions eloquently. Good until the end of 2020 and beyond. :-)
"Bears: Your thesis has been baked in. CCL down from 50s, for Petes sake. We are at that low point. No new terrible news. CCL will have plenty of money. Could be new bailout legislation to include cruise lines."
Patience my fellow longs.....CCL is going green! More vaccines in the arms of good’ol Americans spells SAILING TO BEGIN SOON!
Super rough the first hour today.. stomach turning. But did not sell..They shook the tree today and many folded. But just try to see long term. 2-3 years this will easily be $30 stock
I would bet with the Billions they received recently their buying back the stock knowing in a month or so we will be back around $20 to $25! NICE!
"it will rally tomorrow because people have no idea how government works. There is zero chance of preventing a BK for the cruise companies. They will seek protection and shut down for 6 months, then return and hopefully once this has passed. No amount of hand holding or Trump tweets will prevent that because the House will never pass a bill that hands them cash."
"Ok, I have changed sides. I am now going long. I see great value here. We should now see clear way to 35 as vaccinations seem to be working and the economy opens."
Predictions for tomorrow? I think it could go either way unless we get some positive new. Hoping for the best though!
"Should You Buy Carnival Corporation Stock Now?This is a question of time... and money.Rich SmithRich Smith(TMFDitty)Jan 8, 2021 at 8:24AMAuthor Bio2020 was a crazy year for Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL)(NYSE:CUK) beginning with an 80% plunge, and ending up with a loss of ""only"" 57%. But there's a silver lining for investors today: Buy Carnival stock now, and if the share price just goes back to where it was before the coronavirus crisis hit, you've got yourself a clean double.Or so the thinking goes.And that may be thinking right.Cruise ship at seaIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Let's run a thought experiment, shall we? Right now, after its big dip and its partial recovery, Carnival Corporation stock carries a market capitalization of $22.9 billion. Over the five years preceding the pandemic, Carnival averaged profits of about $2.7 billion per year, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. So if you assume that at some point in the future things will get ""back to normal"" for Carnival (and I do), then the stock currently costs a low 8.5 times normalized earnings.That's less than half the 18.7 P/E ratio the stock has averaged over the last decade. And it suggests that there really is a case to be made for Carnival stock doubling once things get back to normal.The bigger question is how long it will take to return to normal, and whether Carnival Corporation has enough cash to survive until cruising resumes and customer interest returns, so that it can get back to making the kind of profit used to make.But there's good news on that front, too. After running the numbers on Carnival, I estimate the company has something on the order of $14.2 billion in cash available to it right now. Even at a monthly cash burn rate of $530 million, this implies that Carnival has sufficient cash to keep itself afloat through about March 2023 without needing to sell any more stock or take out any more loans.Will that be long enough? The best estimates I've seen suggest cruising in the U.S. won't start up again before April or May -- and even those cruises will be of limited duration and with limited passengers on board. We can't expect a full return to normal, I suspect, until vaccines have been widely distributed across the U.S., and experts aren't expecting that to happen before summer. Still, even if cruising isn't back to normal before the end of this year -- or even next year -- it will return to normal eventually, and surely before Carnival runs out of money in early 2023. If you can afford to be patient, I see a real opportunity to earn a double on Carnival stock within the next three years.this was posted 1/08/21 motley Fool Though Im not a big fan of Motley I was exited about the significant cash available to wait..."
you guys telling me the CDC is going to lift restrictions just for Florida... that is some powerful drugs you guys are on.. CDC are democrat puppets and you think CDC going to give special privileges to Florida.. markets are going to correct because recovery and tech stocks are overvalued. dont even invest in value plays because overall market correction will just bring down value stocks as well. Goldman sachs said a crash is not coming. That is like THE best indicator that a crash is coming and they sold 10.5 billion of stocks recently in block trade spree. If no crash is coming why they selling. Best play is NOT to play and I made a #$%$ ton of money on Carnival already so I'm just going to sit pretty. You guys should've got in on this February and March. You guys are LATE.

CCL = strong buy $$$$$
At $22 this was already overpriced and you guys think that it's worth $30? They pumped this sector to the max. The dump will come and it will be a painful one.
Looks like cdc making more problems so glad I’m short should test 20
didn't you wonder why Biden is announcing the news 30 minutes AFTER market is closed? can't be good news
"Please tell me, what is the best platform for trading?"
"if you are about to choose one cruise stock to buy, which one will you choose? I am thinking about which one will be more likely to survive, what you guys like?"
Let’s hope those gains hold today gang! Good luck.. 40% drop on COVID cases.
20+ next week
"PFE (2 Billion doses in 2021), Sanofi licenced to make 700 million does, Moderna making 1 billion doses, JNJ making 1 billion doses, AstraZeneca 700million doses and Novavax 1 billion does for 2021 with 2 billion in 2022 ... plus whomever is coming up in the next few months. Once you see the US under a 1000 deaths a day, these cruise, airline, airbnb, uber style stocks will rocket (...as great timing for Spring/Summer). I know first place I'm heading is Vegas."
I'll buy more at 8 through 10
NO WAY WE WON'T' SAIL BY JULY WHEN THE CDC OK'D SENDING TEACHERS AND STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL AS SOON AS NEXT WEEK!!
Congrats to all longs. The vaccine is here. CCL called me today and asked if I will be on the cruise that leaves port 7am sharp tomorrow.
CDC says no masks if you have your shots - they should turn the cruise industry loose now
"For those who under the impression that the CDC will give the green light to cruising any moment now, I suggest to read the ""Frequently Asked Questions about COVID-19 Vaccination"" section on the CDC site. Reading their answers, it's clear that they have no clue when and if we will ever go back to normal life. Put simply, they have no idea if the vaccine will be effective or not, or for how long it will be effective for. They view the vaccine as better that than nothing. According to the CDC, they will begin the process of collecting data after the vaccination campaign reaches the herd immunity target. That means that in 4-5 months from now they will begin collecting data. Obviously, this process will last a few months. So, between the time it will take to vaccinate enough people and the time it will take to collect and analyze the data we are looking at about a year from now before the CDC will even consider to allow sailing. That's if everything goes well.... Don't believe? Read for yourself:https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html"
"If there is any inkling that CCL can start sending ships out within a year (they have enough cash to survive at least that long), the share price won’t drop much (if any) from here. CCL is currently making money on deposits for 2020 & 2021. Signs/rumors are pointing to cure(s) and vaccine(s) sooner rather than later. Most of all, at today’s $16.60’s, this stock has been beaten down about 76% from two years ago. The effects of the virus are already considered in the stock price."
"Princess Cruises has become the latest line to scrap plans for international sailing from the UK over the summer.The Carnival-owned line has cancelled sailings from Southampton on Sky Princess, Regal Princess and Island Princess through to September 25th.The news follows a similar decision from sister company P&O Cruises yesterday"
i love how stuff started crashing after i started buying...just shows gotta buy when its going up not down bc now i am scaredh kat
"We are ready for break out, CCL!"

Who wants to make a bet? Will this hit $30 before close or post-market?

Looking to buy CCL in the $25's this week. Hold on shareholders . . .
"I like trawling through my old posts.@dumb and @dumber ""bet you wish your investments were hot like me""Keith 25 days ago$CCL conversationNext weeks playout. If we can see this breaking the $22-$23 Range. Then their is clear skies ahead to $29 and then to fill the gap at around $40. obviously isn't doing this all next week, but within a couple months we could be seeing the $40 mark.Keith 26 days ago$CCL conversationInteresting day ahead, Something is brewing here, looking super bullish on everything I look at. Only real major resistance (check chart back to 2010) is in the $29 range. Interesting to see how this plays out. Volume would be great to see to confirm this bullish breakout. Not financial advice but my spidey senses are tingling. (they aren't always 100% correct either) lol. Good luck today whichever way you choose to trade."
What percentage of CCLs operating expenses are fuel? If they are buying it now that should help to provide a tailwind coming out of this.
ACCURATE INFO: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/CCL/insider-trades/
Arnold will also mention this during CCL conference call. All Bullish. :)
This will be 48+ in a year
"Just a reminder that Blind Optimism has been wrong about CCL every.single.day since $11. He's also been bearish on PINS since $16. It's at $21.50. CCL isn't going bankrupt. Period. Look at the CDS spreads on CCL compared to AAL. Of course we can drop from here, we're up 35% in the last 10 days, but you're wrong about CCL long-term and you're desperately trying to justify you're short."
I was in NCLH got out and put my money in CCL if it goes down to 10-11 imma load up!
A lot of people are cheer-leading for ccl to tank. They must have shorted the stock or missed the boat when shares were cheaper. One year from now the conversation will be when do we get dividends.
"So, everyone who thinks Carnival or many of the other cruise lines are all going to shut down completely and the United States will no longer offer cruises as a means of vacationing....even in the future??"
Get ready for a great week ahead! All the shorts are here because they think spamming a yahoo board will stop CCL from going up! There was hundreds of millions of dollars worth of shares traded Friday and nobody here is spending anywhere near that but they are losing lots of money now that people’s panic about COVID has wore off and their short position on $CCL is losing them tons of money daily!
"3/2/21. Uh ohhhhhh...Newly reported coronavirus cases rose to 58,812 on Monday from 51,204 a day earlier, and the seven-day average has ticked higher, according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. Daily deaths, meanwhile, increased to 1,566 from 1,097 on Sunday.“I remain deeply concerned about a potential shift in the trajectory of the pandemic,” Dr. Walensky said Monday. “The latest CDC data continue to suggest that recent declines in cases have leveled off at a very high number.”"
"Princess cruises announces, “ it'll be UK holidays that will restart first before the gradual return of international travel. With this in mind, we're introducing a series of new short UK breaks aboard our stunning Royal Class ships; Regal Princess and Sky Princess. Cruises on sale in the coming weeks of March.” These are the ships redeployed from the Mediterranean and Fjords to give certainty to guests whilst ensuring revenue. Great news."
Green day! :-)

Absolutely time to buy. The DOW is down 425 of course the stock is down but there are blox of buy orders what does that tell you?
I cant believe they are wasting money on tv ads now.....nobody would go on a cruise now

No more masks indoors in Colorado. Woohoo.
(10 a.m. GMT) -- P&O Cruises has cancelled all its planned cruises until the beginning of September and those on Britannia and flagship Iona -- which has not even sailed with passengers yet -- until the beginning of October.https://www.cruisecritic.com/news/5923/
Do you shorts see what is happening from a technical perspective. CCL is making higher lows and establishing higher resistance. Going green today.
What’s 100 days (or less)? Then you will see this stock take off.
"This coming week will be very interesting. I think we will see some uptrend action. Every last week of the month we have been exploding (3/24 - 3/26) and (4/27 - 4/30). I would not be surprised to see the same action and hitting around $16 - $19 this coming week (5/26 - 5/28). On 3/27 and 5/1, It has been dropping so 5/29 could be a descending day. (Yes, Friday are sell day). If that doesn't happen, we could see the moves in the first week of June. (6/1 - 6/4)I could definitely be wrong, but it has been a trend. Overall, a very unpredictable market. But we are hearing and seeing some good news about booking, opening in August, vaccine, sates opening phase 2, and etc. Have a good Memorial weekend everyone."
"I know many are saying people will sell, going to go down between $5.00-$9.00. But it isn't happening? Maybe people want to hold on to it for the future??"
Upgrade by J P Morgan from 23 to 33!! Just in!
"hi. can somebody please help me understand how there's only upside in this company? I know everyone said the delay and earnings were already baked in, but im not sure how the only way is up from here, because it doesn't like it will go up until the end of the year? can someone explain?"
"Dr. Fauci believes we will be back to normal by 5/2021 and that is being conservative about it. Rising covid cases and rising deaths for the next few weeks are factored in to the stock price. The national guard is helping to assist in vaccinating people in many states now. The Johnson and Johnson one dose vaccine will likely be approved in February and will be a game changer. 6 month outlook is only getting better and as you all know, the stock market is based on future expectations. I will continue to accumulate shares at this price as momentum will continue and the price is only going up."
"This is a new kind of vaccine - instead of injecting the genetic material for the spike protein, this is the protein itself. Not the whole virus - it is just the protein which is injected, and it's got very very good results.It is 89% effective in the data that's coming forward this evening. And what's more, it worked really well in the people that it needs to work in - 27% of the people on the trial were over 65 and significantly, it worked against the new variants circulating here in the UK - there it was 86% effective.In South Africa where there was another trial, again, a very worrying variant there - perhaps more worrying than the one here - but it was 60% effective there.So it does seem to be an extremely robust vaccine.Now it's a matter of getting it through the gates.So you'd expect it to take about a month to get through the medical regulation, and then we can see 60 million doses coming our way."
@David have you seen those 15k blocks in Level II?
"Seriously shorts, there's more and more vaccines and it's obvious that a mandatory jab before boarding is coming. Face it, you had your chance with those variants but it's over."
Florida only added 1700 new covid cases today. It's nearly gone!
"Rumors the RCL are about to announce their cruises are cancelled, thoughts?Personally I think there is no way the 4000 are going to travel to 4 different countries a week in 3 months time. People will literally die."
"FYI - 19 out of 20 usernames that post on the CCL message board is the same person using 19 differnt names and posts on both sides, long and short.Don't fall for the scam."
Going long picked up 500 shares last weds gonna double down next dip. Sit and forget
"@David, I'm up 15c. Do I take it or be greedy"
It’s all about momentum at this point read it and weep Chucky Unfortunately there will be no bankruptcy
Tom Hanks has it.Now we are going to see actual celebrities and politicians testing positive.This one will go to $15 before $30
"Carnival called us this week to see if we were planning a cruise, I told him show me the money, I have cruised with them for several years and never got any kind of loyalty gift, now they can take care of me if they want me cruising."
CCL is on fire! Negative sound bite from CEO and it still spikes! CDC sailing approval must be imminent?
Lol
Jan 2022 call of 40
don't watch the stock and look at it again in the middle of May and you'll be surprised it's up as high as it will be
I hold and sale several times in the last 12 months. Always succesfuly. It is a trade option to me unless you go really long. So far so good
"Canada just announced that any large size cruise ship cannot dock in any Canadian port until July in which at that time, it will be re-evaluated. Stock is rebounding after huge sell-off yesterday, but things will get worse.. a lot worse before it gets better.. I don't hold any long or short position at the moment, and I am speaking from neutral position, but I do plan to add some position on this stock likely months later"
"I got an E-mail from Princess last night about my upcoming cruise. It basically said that if I had any contact with anyone who had been in China 14 days before embarking, that I could not sail, but to get a full refund, I must prove that I had this contact......and that I could be prosecuted for lying. I think lawyers must have written it. :-)"
"This may or may not help investors out. Yes, corona virus is plaguing the cruise ship industry, but how long could a person live in a bubble? Sooner or later people are going to get bored with being confined and will want to go out and experience."
"A while back I told y’all that 28 was the wrong time to buy. I said y’all are possibly jumping in too soon. I was right, I will buy on this dip."
CCL is about to blast off!! I have a feeling great news is coming SOON! All longs will be be truly rewarded. Jg
How high will this go overnight? $16 maybe?
Not worried about coronavirus. Ready to sail
"Dr. Anthony Fauci to seniors: “above all, do not get on a cruise ship.”"
Who else is holding this stock till it gets back to $30+ ?
In at $25.32 on 130 shares not including the 25 I have holding from $8.94!!
When are earnings???
"Shorty here. Losing money today.The market cap of CCL is HIGHER than pre-pandemic and has billions more debt. Is there anyone here interested in holding for 5+ years at this price? Why?Enjoy today's gains, longs!"
"I can't believe people are selling this, must be the shorts LOL, this will be the first cruise line to fill up fast due to families booking with kids"
why aren't we at $30+? lol
You buy when there is blood on the street. Buying opportunity! COVID will be over by summer.
"With the way COVID numbers are trending, the CDC should really consider allowing cruises in July with all the precautions cruise lines have promised. Let’s open up our economy and get back to normal! Enough with the scare tactics. You can guarantee with all the pent up demand, people will be willing to pay a premium to take a cruise. No discounts needed! "
"Where else will you find a company of this calibre, with shares still “on sale” because of the COVID market drop? Anything under pre COVID price per share is a blessing as $CCL in the coming months and years will leave the struggles of COVID in the dust."
Good morning to the shorts that decided to hold their positions over the weekend! Sorry about your luck...https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/12/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-clinical-trials-resume-in-uk-after-pause-over-safety-concerns.html
"If RCL is pushing a re-start out until end of Sept, then CCL might be in big trouble too. Their entire debt restructuring plan hinged around cruising at the end of June."
"Just use common sense. Any vaccine (when ready) will go to 1st responders, the elderly, nursing home people and those with know health conditions. Then the average citizen can get their shots. The average types that might be taking a cruise with be getting a shot till probably March, April or maybe even June. That's another 1-2 qtrs of losses for cruise ships. Keep some dry powder for the real bottom."
Here is a CLASSIC for all the SHORTY McSHORTIES! CCL is a BUY!
To all those that have held from the beginning......
U.S. regulators on Monday authorized emergency use of the first experimental antibody drug for COVID-19 in patients who are not hospitalized but are at risk of serious illness because of their age or other conditions. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Eli Lilly & Co’s bamlanivimab based on trial data showing that a one-time infusion of the treatment reduced the need for hospitalization or emergency room visits in high-risk COVID-19 patients.
Honest question I’m new to all this I’m in 230 shares at 8.86 do I cut my losses now or do I hold out and take the risk?
go figure 7.00 to now...why why not
Why do some of you make up things to post? Are you children?
KNOCK KNOCK!WHO IS THERE?SHORTY McSHORTERtens NEEDS TO COVER!
Another gem of mine.. Keith last month Replied to a reactionCarnival Corporation & plcI'll bet all 14 of my houses that this see's $30 before $15. $15 never gonna happen unless unforeseen circumstances that tank everything. If that's your play then good luck..
BREAKING NEWS: Second wave of coronavirus is expected to come in the fall therefore cruises will be canceled by the CDC the rest of the year and resume possibly in March 2021! YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST!
Just in Cruise ships are booking faster than ever
"Virus update for Diamond Princess 691 infected Deaths so far 4, new deaths in last 24hrs +1, total recovered 10, in serious condition 35Given the age of cruise passengers there are a high % of serious cases and unfortunately the death toll will rise. I hope the use of plasma from recovered patients helps outNot sure how this would cause the share price to rise????"
"They need to run a vaccine special, if you can prove you have been vaccinated you get a discount for April and May, a lot of seniors want to get out and this would be perfect."
"Norwegian Cruise Line extends suspension of cruises again, this time for 2 months."
Price target drop to $12 by Bank of America analysts lol

SHORTY: 5% swing is nothing compared to the HUGE 44% I’m UP ....CCL = STRONG BUY!!!
Funny how these shorts work overtime to somehow bring the price down. Doesn't seem to be working haha
"next week the headlines will read cruise line and air line stocks crash because of lockdowns again.. They keep putting out pumping headlines that mean nothing and the sheep keep buying in just to lose their money again. There is no revenue here folks, none....for a long time....they are so desperate to get bookings they are offering $1000 on board credits just to get a deposit.....ships aren't sailing for a long long time"
"Just thinking outloud here. I wonder how Carnival will come out after all this chaos ends? Here are the facts, they have limited amount of cash ($518M as of end of 2019) with huge expenses which can eat up their cash in matter of few months, cruises not going to get a bailout as their ships are all registered in islands to avoid paying taxes to US, they will not be able to sail for 100 days at least, ...etc. I just don't see much positive news for cruise lines in general. I hope they all find a way to survive. I like cruises."
"Hey, I heard that aliens abducted all the CCL's management. I think they will go BK like tomorrow. Sell all your shares. Don't believe that they have 10B+ cash. We won't have a vaccine. Everyone on the planet will die like tomorrow but make sure to sell all your shares and I am not a shortie I am super long but I lost my faith and sold all my 3B worth of shares. And I don't contradict myself."
"Last time it took 6 days to get from 23 to 30, how many days will it take this time?"
$CCL $RCL they sold 20% of the ships to pay off debt during the pandemic. CEO said they may never recover this weekend. crazy how many people were pumping this diluted #$%$
"A) Rcl reports earnings it will impact positivelyB) there is conference call on 15th, that will be the time it will go +30.There is no more bad news to say by the company, than whatever it is already there."
$40 soon very soon!
@issay @Hairless Bawls @Ken
"lmao buy and check back in a year. stop worrying about these small losses, enjoy the rollercoaster, at the end of the day this will be a 100 percent return stock."
So the stock starts DUMPING around 230pm. Why ? Only to find out after hours 1B in offering is coming. Can not tell me there is no insider trading still going on in the market retail is always last to know hmmmm 
"18,50 today?"
It's a small miracle that this stock is trading below 30. Golden opportunity to load up.
Good luck all. Made $50k but getting out now. Characters looking bearish and i think we may retest $8-$9. I'll buy back in if it does. Will deff pop on good news but acting weak recently.Happy cruising and trading.
"Look at CCL this way - You lost your job and you can't get another. After 18 months you've emptied your savings, maxed out you credit cards, and sold many home items to pay your expenses. Finally, things improve and you get your job back. Unfortunately, you're still heavily in debt with a much greater percentage of your salary going to service that debt as before. It's going to be a good while before your standard of living gets back to where it was before. That's fairly much the description of CCL. The CCL of 2019 no longer exists, but that's what many today think they are buying the stock of."
"Bit of a confusing day today...according to the CDC letter, the no sail order is already over. The letters says""... shall remain in effect until the earliest of...... (3) 30th September"". The letter DID NOT say 11.59 on the 30th or until the end of the 30th. Legally speaking the no sail order has expired."
14 months and still trying to hold. Very hard though with the way its been going this week! Sad face.....
"-7,468,000(TTM) Free Cash Flow. I'm definitely buying as many shares as I can."
the Bullish pennant will fly to 38+ soon.
Only booking for Ccl is busy with customers
Nice I hit my target after hrs 26.10 I’m very happy
"TODAY UBS upgrade to buy raising price target to $40, earlier this month another upgrade was done. Why aren't we moving up on the news. Coupled with good COVID outlook due to vaccines and a pending opening of the cruise lines awaiting CDC guidelines, I don't see why CCL is not slowly running up to $40.The only negatives are fuel prices and possible Europe covid resurgence where CCL has a solid business in Germany and Italy.Once US CDC green lights cruises is the ""shot in the arm"" CCL needs, apologize for pun."
sticking with this long term! people have been waiting to go on cruises and this will go up alot over time
They can always open a ship to people who already tested positive! Well I'm glad I got out earlier in the week. I don't see how there van be any certainty that September will be a safe month to sail. COVID cases are spiraling out of control. I'll buy back when it drops to $12.
Sufficient liquidity! Read thishttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/16/is-carnival-stock-a-buy/
sell to buy new
Up .24% after hours! Nice!
overpriced but you guys can keep buying because i know their will be tons of rug pulls on this.
"Not a bad week, Lost $1.50 on the back of a 40% rise. Hit some nice supports and bounced nicely. Looking at all cruise stocks today it looked very option related too. Have a good weekend Longs. Will check charts and see what might happen next week."
Another 6% in the back pocket.Good job longs.
"CCL on sale, hurry up, it won't last long!"
Good buying opportunity for $BA $UAL $AAL $CCL.
Who said this gonna go bk?!
I’ll tell you who’s doing the pumping and that’s the shorts because they’re scared. The stock is supposed to be at 10 according to them. Trading sideways is always a good thing we have built a lot of support over the last week or so. They try to scare you out of your shares so you’ll sell. They have one goal and that is to drive the price down.
"CCL acting crazy today. But, whatever happens today, I just want you all to know that I love you and want you all to succeed and be happy. Cheers!"
"why do the trolls here don't do a research before spewing BS Carnival is a global company just because they aren't sailing in the US doesn't mean anything or you are those idiots who think the US is the only country in the world, Carnival has 9 brands which one is already sailing in Europe and the other 7 will start next month.Research the company before commenting"
Ready to set SAIL!!!!! Load the BOAT
"CCL cash on hand is very delusional & misleading as it was made by issuing a lot more stocks, which causes stock dilution (EPS). The cash was also made by borrowing money, with interest, which will also affect the EPS."
"oh my! carnival, norwegian and Royal Caribbean all going out of the atmosphere in post market action. amazing action today. got 1/3 in each."
"I don't understand why people are not grasping the impact of this on the industry. No cruises for 60 days. Unfortunately that is only part of the issue. They will suffer massive losses after those 60 days if that is all they are closed for, as it takes people years to feel comfortable booking these type of vacations again.Ships will be going out half full at most or they just won't be using their entire fleet. There are costs to having them sit idle as well."
"I know a lot of people are asking about how to unmute someone because they regret muting me. Unfortunately there is no way to unmute me, i ask those people that still haven't muted me to forward my posts to the people that cannot read it....Thanks in advance greatly appreciated by me and those that are desperate for my posts because they miss me"
"Hmmmmm. Cousin works for Royal Caribbean at Port of Miami. Told me his stay at home vacation may be ending soon. I don't want to read too much into this but perhaps good news coming after Memorial Day????????? He has not clue either but supposed to receive some notification soon. Good for me - bad for him but hey, he had the last 18 months off. LOL"
Look at the CCL price chart. What could make this stock go up? Nothing in the foreseeable future.... SELL before you lose alot more...
Any premature vaccine news to manipulate stocks today... anyone ?
"Carnival ----Take a step back to see the bigger picture----The vaccine is undoubtedly fantastic news for the entire travel industry. However, the recent rebound in Carnival’s share price may be unjustified.Originally, the suspension of cruises was supposed to be lifted in January 2021. That didn’t happen. Instead, the cruise line operator extended the pause on most trips until March. But some for America and Asia will remain suspended until November.It doesn’t look to me like the business will return to its standard operating capacity until early 2022. And until then, Carnival still needs to pay its bills (maintenance costs, port fees, salaries, debt interest) without a reliable income source."
SHORTY McFLY....the Party is over... CCL GOING GREEN!!!
"SELL SELL SELL, JUST ANNOUNCED, 50 PEOPLE AND 20 CREW MEMBERS TEST POSITIVE ON THE NEW PRINCESS DISASTER. PENCE IS SUSPENDING ALL CRUISES."
Feeling good about $28 break through.
"If virus is a comeback story every year, then time to get us bear trackers on nasdaq again….ALL JOBS GONEMass deflation, Apple , Amazon can make 20 billion losses in trumpdepressionCCL is already hit hard prefer Nasdaq shortwww.deathcanary.com"
Trump pushing for new stimulus package that will include offshore cruise co's that do a lot of business in US and employ large numbers of US citizens. Deal with Pelosi on the horizon.
"First, Carnival is not going to release bad news on Christmas Eve day. Second, repeat the first."
Wake up in 3 years and triple your money. $$$ Long play here -HOLD
The ship blocking the canal is partially free. Like carnival and Norwegian et al. Someone needs to start a “free Willy”’ type campaign to get these cruise companies moving again. The ships have never been cleaner or better prepared to deal with disaster. Glta.
"Christophe, look you migth be right. CCL bankruptsy soon ? Any better shares to earn some money with ? Coinbase maybe ?"
"For all you stock noobs today was friday, on friday options expire and you need to ignore the market most of these days."
What is your predictions?
"Serious question to the 'longs'..... Is a 'long' someone who buys a stock at, say $20 or $30 a share, and then holds on to it for, well, forever? And who hope that they will have made a profit when/if they finally HAVE to sell it?The reason I ask is that I'm assuming a lot of you bought this stock during this last bull market when the price was between 25 and 55 (roughly). And also assuming you had made some profit on this, or were at least even, at the beginning of the year.So here's my question: once you saw how bad this virus was, and how people were getting stuck on cruise ships getting infected, did it never occur to you how badly this stock was going to get hit? Seriously?Or if you DID foresee this (which took very little thinking to do), did you actually decide to just ride it down and then (hopefully) back up again? Because you hadn't been in the market for 40 years as I have and learned that, in spite of what they've been telling you for the last decade or so, it's NOT always a good idea to 'buy the dips.'Or, I'm assuming there were at least a FEW 'longs' who were pretty darn sure what this pandemic was going to do to the share price of cruise lines, sold early on, and now have the cash to buy four or five times as many shares for the same amount of money when you decide to re-buy CCL?Because as you may, or may not know, if a stock loses 50% of its value, it requires it to go back up 100% to get back to where you started? (this is basic math so do it yourself if you don't believe me).I'm really curious about investor psychology, which is why I'm asking this question and would appreciate serious replies."
and then he said....it may be time to cover? bahahahaaaa Second best joke by shorty.....but the best joke of the year is by Jamie Rollo $18.00 valuation.....
With Vaccines rolling out people will be singing...
"Here we are simply watching the computers trade. And. we have no clue what program they are executing today - not in competition with us. - with other shop's machines. Does Powell even know what they are doing? He doesn't need a press conference, he could just txt GS"
"This stock isn't going back up anytime soon, until covid is actually over, no boats are leaving the dock. If you bought yesterday, just pray that they don't go bankrupt lol"
1 moment of silence for the shorts who got trapped in the morning profit booking
"CCL massive dumping, 4x average volume. Funds have dumped this not just retail."
Hedge funds selling must be a sign that earnings are in play now
Great news also from MSC Cruises. The ship docked tonight after a week long cruise around the med. Caught people who had covid before they boarded and werent allowed to cruise. Sent home a family who strayed during an onshore excursion. And came back and tested all passengers whilst they left the ship without a single case being reported. What with this therapeutic announcement tonight. We could see a great week ahead.
Airlines are hitting all time high. Carnival trading $27 today. Will reach above $60 with a year. Hold and buy on dip. Double your money within a year.
CDC announces ships can sail!!!!!
CDC giving Cruises OK to resume by July! $70+ this week!! https://www.thestreet.com/investing/norwegian-carnival-royal-caribbean-cdc-approval-sailing
Im not sure why reopening stocks are up when things aren't going to reopen. Ontario Canada is in full lockdown and they will be questioned for leaving home.
"It's funny how Andy and a host of others, mostly ones that made their screen name today, are screaming bankruptcy. Let me say two things:1. No one care about your prediction of BK based on pretty much nothing but what you pulled out of your but. 2. Saying the same thing every minute will not make it go down because you've shorted it. No one with any sense bases their investing decisions on a yahoo message board."
Will doubleCDC to approve sailings July 4Gotta be in it to win it 
CDC says its ok to cruise. Is this the news to see us break out of this range!!! Good luck longs 
$20 a share when the US and UK are at there worse. I'm a buyer.Not expecting any earnings or Major sailings before June. But we all know this and here we are.Happy Christmas one and all.

"How come no one posted this? Jul. 6, 2020 9:07 AM ET|About: Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL)|By: Clark Schultz, SA News Editor Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) plans to start sailing again on September 16 assuming that it has the clearance of health authorities. The company's timetable to restart cruises is two weeks ahead of the September 30 date set by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE:NCLH).The cruise line industry has been largely closed down since March. In premarket action, Royal Caribbean is up 2.20% and Carnival is 2.52% higher. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings is showing a 2.44% early gain. For the year, Royal has fallen off less than its two rivals."
I muted issay and will continue to mute negative. About to hit my year anniversary as a long with CCL. In at $9 and change. I can sell in a few weeks but I will not. Hold till we at least get passed $40. Patience everyone. We will eventually sail to the Horizon :).
This stock is under $10 and looks good too https://lussosnews.com/this-stock-under-10-has-wall-streets-full-attention/
So to get things up and running they have to do a bunch of dry runs before they can allow any passengers whatsoever on that many ships it's going to really supercharge the cash burn that this company incurs. They will need to raise more capital since no one will buy bonds from them anymore we must assume dilution is coming very soon
"Covered at $20.06 @Issay. $20 is holding, for now. I went long With cheap calls."
"Carnival is one of the biggest cruise lines in the world. It might take awhile but they will survive and go back to their normal family cruises in the future. As bad as things get, people forget and if there is a good deal, they will travel!"
"Let me get this right. When you are bragging about shorting, isn't the stock supposed to go down?"
Here we go up up and away!!!!! Bullish!!!!!
Looks like news may have been leaked!!!!
Tax selling...all those who have a loss in this stock have to sell today to offset any of their gains. Also portfolio managers don't want to show they are holding this stock since its been down for the quarter / year so window dressing by money managers also in play. I do believe this will be a good play next year.
"I'm confused, we already knew about the November 1st sale date weeks ago. Now they are just reaffirming the the sale date is still a go... It's not really new news. I am not bashing, I am just asking."
Start adding slowly. In the coming weeks there will be a bottom for this stock whether it be 5$ or 8$ this is a great buy right now.
I heard about CCL the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
To make it simple.... Let's say will no profit for next 3 months... Definitely coronavirus panic will disappear after 3 months regardless consequences..... Then company will be back to 40sPlease don't sell here.. If yoy sold at 40...thia was great but selling at 30 is crazyMatters of weeka
I'm out.
Us shorts will get paid big today all indicators 25.75
"Thoughts on tomorrow, higher or lower?"
Looks like a bunch of nothing. There isn't any negative news. Hopefully not too many people panic sold.
"Here’s my issue with all the shorties on this board. When you sell short, your goal is to buy back at a lower price, which in my opinion, is stealing money out of someone else’s pocket. You profit on other people’s losses. You hope companies file for bankruptcy and people lose life savings, not to mention all of the jobs (livelihoods) that are lost. I believe in the high road of going long. No one loses money when stocks go up (except those betting on bankruptcy). When a company flourishes, more people are hired, the economy strengthens and things naturally improve for all involved. Shorts are the kind of people that get that “Grinch” smile at someone else’s bad fortune. I’ve never been a fan of sadism and those people should seek professional help. Bring on the half-dozen thumbs down."
"Wow! Just WOW! I am new to this concept...Are you telling me there are boats as big as hotels that you can stay on with thousands of other people? Count me in. I cant believe this stock is so cheap! What? It’s a company riddled with debt, no customers, and massive stock dilution? I’ll take it!!!"
The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
"Don’t be shocked if ships are only partially full, if they ever sail"
this page is full of crying bears... tell me how broke are you?
"Massive pent-up demand to cruise will load CCL ships very soon. Owning CCL, as I have since 2020, is something that requires a minimum of thought and/or research.."
Everyone contact your senators and house members. It’s crazy that they won’t let cruises restart if they only let people on who are vaccinated. Time to reopen cruises before they all go bankrupt
$23.00We will close Tomorrow
CCL soon $42 easy money!CCL =$$$$$
Here's two things to think about this company. 1)Saudi Arabia wealth fund owns 43 million shares of stock (10%) 2) if you own at least 100 shares you get $250 on board credit on your next cruise.
Can’t hold this baby down!! $CCL $RCL $NCLH
Feel like this is hot potato. So many shares being bought with the thought the market will keep driving this higher. Until it doesn't and then someone will be caught holding the bag.
CDC easing travel restrictions for travel. Coming on CNBC in 5-10 min. 
This should be down (like pretty much every stock in the market right now) the market is clearly blind to negative news and isn’t accepting it right now... what a joke
"I don’t know what the short term direction of this stock is but this is an industry that makes a healthy profit in normal times and has hefty assets. It’s market cap is now like 20% of a company like Uber that has nothing but losses to its portfolio. I believe we don’t need a vaccine to fix this problem, we just need an instant test that confirms a persons health. The virus will contain itself if we can achieve this goal and this stock will skyrocket. People are eager to get back to having fun. I will buy into new lows and wait for better days"
"CCL director that bought 10 million in shares a couple weeks ago has now doubled his money, and then some. $23,000,000, not bad."
Hold tight fellas...CCL going green in a big way by end of day! CCL = $$$
"Sorry shorts! If covid was here in NOV 2019 as discovered by this Dr., that would increase exposure to > 90% of the population (98% of which are asymptomatic), and lethality (mostly in nursing homes as it is) to lower than the flu by a large margin!

"Big price drop this week, investors are not want to have their money sit for 2 years and do nothing"
Im bullish obviously for 14 months. It aint phased by the ER. Get that priced into stock price. Im so confused lol
Following on. Expect P&O to announce something along the same lines too soon. Reposition a few other ships and we could see 25% of the fleet sailing by end of november. Great news and good luck.
no income but that means very little operating expenses as well. they borrowed enough money to last two years or more without income. they will not be going bankrupt.
"You guys should know this month and next month going forward wont be the same. The Feds won't save the stock market like they did in April. The market is feeling the effects of the shutdowns, unemployment and recession now. It will be an ugly summer, those like me and Warren Buffett that haven't invested in the stock market yet are waiting for the perfect opportunity. Because we know the markets don't go up forever even those they get pumped by the feds. The best time to invest is after next Quarter when all the companies report they horrible earnings from April-June and see the effect of the shutdowns. whole month ot April shutdown half of May optimistically and say they start to pick it up in June. How horrible do you think the earning reports will be? well ladies and gentlemen that's when to pull the trigger and buy all the stocks you have on your watchlist as a discount price of at least 30%. Be wise with your money my friends"
"The CDC reaffirmed their punishment of Florida, and CCL went up. This stock has a mind of its own, no technical foundation beyond the, Heel Clicking, followed by profit taking. Rinse Repeat."
And we’re off! MSC Virtuosa sets sail today from the UK. Have a great cruise you lucky people!
"DOW already + 4%, big jump today"
"Great news today! Now if the FDA would approve Covi-Stix, the 15 minute covid test that does NOT REQUIRE LAB EQUIPMENT (SRNE), CCL shares will explode!"
"RunShorty Run, to the bank to coverCCL = STRONG BUY!"
"When you book a trip on CCL, do you keep moving up, and, down, in the ship."
Sell the news get out while you can
Good morning @Bawls. Didn’t I tell you there would be VERY VERY VERY VERY big news and that it would be really funny! Just be lucky it’s a down market or it would be up 10% more. But great news don’t you think? Like I said it’s a real “dipsydoodle” chart with an inverted belly button.
Could not help myself - bought small (500 shares) at 10.20 right near the close
What happened this morning that caused all stocks across the board to take I dive right around 9:45? Some big bank fishy business it looks like to me.
Folks it doesn’t get any better than this... CCL bookings surge 600% !!! And upgraded to Buy form hold by HSBC !!! Time to add more and squeeze the shorts.
everyone decided to sell today and they also agreed not tonchase to cover
I’m new here. Is this brr person the board expert?
"Nowadays, bad news is good news. Market prospers on bad news.(Bloomberg) -- Applications for U.S. state unemployment benefits surged last week by the most since late March, pointing to persistent labor-market pain as coronavirus infections continue to soar and potentially adding to momentum for a larger federal stimulus plan."
"It is said the market drop is due to Dr, Fauci said it is more likely the drug would be used by the end of year, not next month."
Would you guys be comfortable sending your parents on a cruise ships knowing there is no vaccine and the virus hasn't disappeared yet? Serious question
Either today or next week get ready to see this stock go red. No revenue no passengers until March 2021. Ouchh!! Vaccine must be given twice a month apart and only until the second dose is given that is when immunity starts developing in coming weeks.. that means atleast two months so if possible maybe April some people will be able to go on board SOME!!
"SWEET, UP 4%!!!!!!!!!!!!"
And yes my other eleven screen names have also went long. Let's get this to 35
CCL is setting up for a massive LAUNCH to the mid $30's very soon!
Looks like insiders are jumping ship. I'm a holder.
This one was so easy. I knew it from the beginning that we are going to go +30 in a short period of time. Feeling super bullish at the moment.
"CCL may drop some more, but it will be WAY higher come summer. I have no problem waiting until then. Easy money."
"I’m willing to bet $33 dollars this will be down next week. Cheap puts, we will see"
I say torpedo all the cruise ships. No one is ever ever ever going to take a cruise again. Ever ever ever.
"Cruise ship stocks rose on Wednesday after the White House said the U.S. would have enough coronavirus vaccines available to inoculate every adult in the country two months earlier than anticipated. As of 1:05 p.m. EST, shares of Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL), Carnival (NYSE: CCL) (NYSE: CUK), and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH) were up 4%, 6%, and 8%, respectively. The White House's announcement came after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted emergency use authorization to Johnson & Johnson for its single-shot COVID-19 vaccine."

My travel agent phoned Princess today to see if they would let me rebook or get a credit......because my wife is afraid to sail and I have COPD. Nothing. 100% cancellation penalty. Very sad to hear this. We still may go......and hope for the best....but odds are it will be our last CCL Cruise.
CCL reaches a 28 year low at 7.82
Time to cover shorts. Going to gap up open higher tomorrow. Don't getcaught holding the bag.
"Fair value is about 2bucks, they are broke. Covid not going anywhere for the next 3-5 years. They had better sell the fleet and use the iron for something usefull."

Bears getting desperate this morning Hahahaha
"Sailing soon in August could work either way, a hit or a nightmare. If they make a mistake, the price is very big"
Taiwan starting cruises in July. Alaska has ferry service which is the same as a cruise. I watched the first sailing from Bellingham and there were 50% retirees on board.CCL will sail soon and the comments will be why didn't I get in while it was under. I am extremely happy with my 10.25 buy in back in March.
"Cruise lines will test each boarding passenger ( 15 minute test) restoring confidence in those who LOVE to cruise. Airlines, buses and trains will too. All aboard!"
BREAKING NEWS: Canada has banned cruises until end of November and most like will be banned for rest of the year. Keep in mind US will follow the same steps. I have warned you guys but keep dreaming cruises will be back next month lol.
"$CCL $RCL $NCLH I held a ton of stock and sold recently after the CDC released new guidelines and guidance for early Fall, which will turn the ship into a floating prison for a week. In addition, earning is coming up. Revenue 33M 99.31% Net income -2.22B 625.3% Diluted EPS -2.41 495.08% Net profit margin -6,733.33% >9999.99% Operating income -1.56B 423.28%I’ll buy again when these stock drop 40-60%. Still 6 months away from when the CDC is recommending that they can start mock trials with limited passengers and tons of requirements like, mask 24/7, $300 Covid testing 24 hours before sailing. Vaccine card. 70% of Republicans said they aren’t getting the vaccine. Think about this."
"CCL is very interesting investment at these prices .. I believe CCL will come out of their financial crisis just fine , long term .. But there is no immediate need to invest in CCL. Personally, i am going to wait for this stock and the market as a whole to settle for at least 3-4 weeks .. I do not believe CCL’s stock price will appreciate much from the 8.00 level in that time frame .. I might get lucky and be able to buy in at a lower cost. CCL will survive. I have no doubts about that .. Carnival offers a great experience for their passengers. Carnival also attracts a younger age group compared to other cruise lines .. Anyone on this board investing in CCL is making a great decision. Again , i am going to wait a few weeks before i pull the trigger .. But this company is a very good investment at these current values .. Good luck to all of the investors who believe in this company the same as i do .."
Negative news released?
Isn't it funny when one short (Won't name names) posts they all post in succession but when that (one) doesn't none of them do?
"amazing that this board is dead,, i think when great companies are cheap no one talks about it ,, so i think ccl has a 4.5 % dividend and yearly high in the 60's ,, nice to get paid while you wait ... with oil prices down cost of fuel is cheap .. looks like a buy to me .. wake up board .."
6 billion in revenue.plus reduced expenses. Carnivals is good till next year.no problem.without making a penny. There’s no better time to buy

How is this even going up?

"$CCL $RCL $NCLH - just a heads up to my fellow shareholders. I’m out today because of the CNBC piece today. On CNBC today: 40Bn total lost in 2020. If things return and the CDC clears the cruise industry, there will be; No self serve buffet. Covid testing. Temperature checks. Mock voyages in late summer/fall with no passengers to prove safety. Limited passengers when they allow passengers. Mask. Huge changes. Reiterating: No self-serve buffet? Im out. Sorry, this is insane. I’ve been in for a while, I’ll take a cruise in a year or two, but this is way too sketchy now. HUGE CHANGES EVEN AFTER THEY OPEN."
FDA approved Pfizer vaccine today. Ccl survives.
Short squeeze coming in afternoon and extended hours. Maybe 3% up by end of day. More on Friday. Adding more to my long position.
Investing in the cruise lines is the ultimate test of patience.
"Looky, Looky, the big boys are buying CCL before it launches to $40! The insiders KNOW WHAT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN! Shorty McSHORTERtons better cover!"
Slow and Steady!!
"New investor in CCL today, looking forward to getting to know this board - 500 shares."
"Wait until ships start boarding people again, this will be in the 30s-"
"This stock is priced high, it will take years to recover. There are other stocks worth investing in tourism industry"
The smart will hold. This a great long stock and will have good returns soon with the positive covid news that will start coming up. Just the hint of vaccine made this stock go up so much in the past month. Just wait and see how it reacts to the next vaccine good news.
"The coronavirus news just keeps getting worse in a steady march of information. Eventually they'll get a vaccine, the travel industry will recover and the world will be a happy joyful place again. Until that happens, CCL will have lower highs on up days and lower lows on down days. The trend is your friend."

Remember that stock markets is a game where the impatients give money to the patients "
Don’t worry longs....we’re going higher!CCL = Strong Buy!!!

So much manipulated .. easy 30 by mid April
"Travel+LeisureAlaska Senators Introduce New Legislation to Bypass Canada’s Cruise Ship BanMon, March 8, 2021, 8:05 AM6238024659001Alaska senators are working to get the state's cruise season off the ground with new legislation following Canada's cruise ship ban.Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan introduced the Alaska Tourism Recovery Act on Friday that, if passed, would allow cruise ships to travel between the state of Washington and Alaska without stopping in Canada. Currently, the Passenger Vessel Service Act — passed in 1886 — requires large foreign-flagged ships to stop in Canada before heading north to the state, which wouldn't be possible this year as Canada extended its cruise ship ban through February 2022.""Canada's recent decision to prohibit Alaska-bound cruise ships from operating in Canadian waters creates legal hurdles that will hamstring the Alaska cruise season, creating additional economic strain on Alaska's entire economy, especially in our Southeast communities,"" Murkowski said in a statement. ""Alaskan communities are already facing severe economic hardship and uncertainty from missing one tourism season as a result of COVID-19… Missing another cruise season would only compound the economic fallout that has been devastating for so many families.""Since Canada extended its ban, cruise lines have been forced to cancel Alaska itineraries while some have pivoted to land-based journeys. The introduction of the bill comes weeks after Alaska leaders pledged to find a workaround.Sullivan said Canada's decision has ""dire implications"" for Alaska, adding the state ""simply can't afford to weather another season without the tremendous economic activity that cruise ships provide to our coastal communities.""While Alaska sailings remain in jeopardy, visitors can still head to The Last Frontier to spot wildlife, explore the state's expansive national parks (including the popular Denali National Park), and listen to the deafening crack of calving glaciers.Travelers to Alaska are no longer required to complete a COVID-19 test prior to arrival, but can choose to get tested at the airport."
"Carnival Extends U.S. Sailing Pause Through May on Flagship Line, Cancels Certain Princess Sailings in 2021"
buy and thanks me next month
"For all the buyers of cruise line stocks, including short covering shorts, at $26 per share, NCLH's total enterprise value (market cap plus total debts) have reached the highs before the covid-19 pandemic. It will take at least two years for cruise lines to be able to operate at full capacity before CDC's restrictions are lifted, in the main time, cruise lines, such as $NCLH, $CCL, $RCL, will continue to increase their debt loads and share counts as negative cashflows persists because of 50% capacity restrictions. It's your money and my posts is not investment advice, but for pure entertainment only. But, it seems obvious that cruise lines at best offer fully priced investments that yields low single digit annual returns, at worst will go belly up and shareholders' capital will disappear in a bankruptcy filing. You can say bye bye to your returns especially when you include inflation."
How can CCL just not report earnings? Or evrn give a date when ?
Cruises stop a number of ports of call depending on the length of the cruise. New screening procedures aren't going to be effective to detect exposures to passengers who disembark and reembark.
@david ready for good news.100 $28.50 CALLS at $60.100 $29.00 CALLs at 40.Good luck!
We’re attracting some pretty large bids favoring call options (shareholders) this month. We’re still going higher.
Reddit about cruise .Strong buy .Great gain sure .
"why can""t ccl report quarterly earnings? They keep delaying it? They may lose $2.25 to $3 billion this quarter which is 10% of market cap. Qualified opinion coming or no accounting opinion? No US cruise till Nov, and Europe shutting down again. Is this a going concern? The accounting opinion may tell."
LMAO ALERT! (Also posted earlier) Paul Golding has a whopping 2 stars out of 5. He got most of his ratings wrong (information available at Tipranks). Charles Yu of Macquarie has no ratings at all at Tipranks - probably his first ratings.
just fyi. earnings call is on Friday. Due your DD not saying anything else but be careful.
"Pandemic almost over, millions vaccinated every day. Great stock to be invested in."
Ok so let's think about this. we have been closed for almost 5 months. they r postponing sailing till February of next year so another 6 to 7 months. They are getting deeper and deeper in debt. delay on the new ships and dry dock. And point 3 percent that is 0.30 of the insiders own this company at the moment. law suits up the ying yang. you dont think those ppl stuck on the ships are getting any money. ya right. And you guys think after they reopen it's going to be a quick turnaround. 2 to 5 years min. for them to be in safe waters. They are going to have to borrow a bunch to stay afloat. which they probably will. but deeper in debt. Can you really justify $15.00 as a buy point? Just saying do your DD before hand.
Dow Futures down -550 points... Yikes.. this is going to open really low this morning
Sailing soon...CCL = $$$$$
I believe we will be around 17-18 by the end of September and 20-23 end of November after that CCL will fluctuate between 25-35s. I don't think it will fully recover until mid-2022. But their growth potential increased even further because of BKs. I think their market cap will be around 65-70B by 2026. That means 36.5% yearly growth. Considering safety margin I'd say CCL is far better investment than any other FAANGs except FB and AMZN. It applies to all major players in this sector like $RCL $CCL $NCLH
"Brazil’s COVID crisis is a warning to the whole world, scientists say.“You can vaccinate your whole population and control the problem only for a short period if, in another place in the world, a new variant appears,” she said. “It will get there one day.”https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/brazils-covid-crisis-is-a-warning-to-the-whole-world-scientists-say/articleshow/81314848.cms"
"Funny how everyone that post negative news about this company act like they don't own any stock in it. If you don't, why waste your time posting on something that doesn't concern you?"
"$CCL play will move up more based on near term revenue, both potential and actualized. Profit performance is already baked in but may affect stock performance relative performance to other cruise lines. Consider new ship environmental technologies, LNG fuels and how they could resonate with regulators around the world and preferential access to ports. Anticipate a short term (2- 3 year) boom in cruise activity as risk continues to moderate and hosted travel becomes the desired mode for vaccinated retirees looking to make up for lost time. Just a bit of forward looking investment market analysis... I am expecting 80 - 90% recovery in most impacted stocks in 2021 with potential advances beyond due to COVID driven cost reduction drivers and business travel reductions from video conferencing implementations which are likely to keep airlines challenged for some time."
"See Ya SHORTIES!No trial voyages for highly vaccinated cruises As previously reported, ships may forgo trial voyages if 98% of crew are fully vaccinated and lines submti a 'clear and specific vaccination plan and time line to limit cruise ship sailings to 95 percent of passengers who have been verified by the cruise ship operator as fully vaccinated prior to sailing.'"
Bazillionaire 8hours agoGood morning @Bawls. Didn’t I tell you there would be VERY VERY VERY VERY big news and that it would be really funny! Just be lucky it’s a down market or it would be up 10% more.But great news don’t you think? Like I said it’s a real “dipsydoodle” chart with an inverted belly button.
"Now that ccl will sail this summer, share price will reach $40 soon."
Any legitimate theory as to why this is rising today?
Shorts are covering going on in the market going into the close....Just hold on to your shares
"Dear longs, it is obvious that Carnival very soon will surpass 30. We can’t be sure as always what will be in a month or two from now but if for the last two months this has risen regardless the difficulties, surely with all more good news than negative going forward the stock will continue upward. Of course there will be pullbacks and whoever is smart and lucky will take advantage. Reports for this stock will start matter after they start sailing, until then just read the news and make sure you are on the right side. Shorts i wish you are also on profit and playing it smart, at the end of the day ideal world is everyone to be happy but overall direction is upwards. If this was this go bankrupt it would have been announced, soon incomes are coming and debt will be slowly paid.Good luck everyone"
"The Case For Carnival Cruises As of writing, Carnival’s stock has dropped over 80% since the COVID-19 outbreak. Dipping well below 2008 levels. But is this justified?Business has stopped completely but the same sort of happened in 2008. With less consumer spending the hospitality industry was slammed. Yet at Carnival the dividends were still being paid, and the ships were operating. And no bailout talks were being held. Ultimately, 2008 proved to be an incredible time to invest with Carnival’s stock dropping at a low of $24. Now the price is at the same level as 1993! With net income being nearly the same as market cap and book value of 4x the current price, a gain of 20% or more is certainly possible.Sources*MarketBeatYahoo FinanceSimply Wall St.Thanks for reading"
"CCL has one ship in quarantine with 174 people infected, and another ship that has tried to dock at 5 ports and has been turned away. there are 20 new case of virus yesterday and 65 new one the day before. People still buy the stock like corona virus is not an issue for the cruise industry. Who is booking a cruise with that back drop?"
What shorts don't realize is that this stock will never ever again will go below 25
Shorts be like
Holding the down Trend should be a big payday tom on shorts
Cruises are going to be booked full for years...this is a no brainer buy
"Allow me to assist the ignorant. First, CCL comments about ""increased demand"" is BS. This is nothing more then made up numbers based on HYPOTHETICAL positioning. The real facts are, they are selling off assets...ships...the very things that make them money. Like a chef selling off his kitchen appliances. Obviously this will impact revenue permanently. There is still no cruising AND the summer is about gone. So, go ahead and pay 8% more today then yesterday. smh."
"Come on Governor DeSantis get the cruise lines going in Florida, fight the CDC take the CDC to court. No reason ships aren't sailing here in US. Cruise lines putting only COVID negative workers and customers on the ships, what is the worry?Keeping the cruise lines shutdown to promote the ridiculous ""COVID Permit"" requirements is wrong!"
Wow!Another $2.5B bond debt!I'm glad I got out when I did.
"Well, the CDC just F'd the Cruise Industry again! Their new guidance adds even more step and rules to the process to resail! The CDC truly wants to destroy the Cruise Industry! There is no way CCL cruises this summer or this year with the current CDC requirements! The cruise lines have already said that the rules are undoable and unfeasible! The only option to possibly allow cruising this year is a legal challenge!"
"$65??? you do not understand what's going on. This is a $100 stock and will get there before summer. The attractive dividend makes it a great stock to hold. Vegas is losing 3 million tourist a year. Where are these vacationers going to go? Casino, Fancy dining, dance clubs, pools and shows. Do not under estamate this stock. Buy and enjoy the ride. Buy it for your children."
Wanted to buy CCL though not convince it would recover within the next 6 months atleastAt the current price i think it can still go down.Anyone here can justify the $12.5 buy?
company director buys 10 million dollar worth of stock on Friday...does he know something we don't?
"Savings rates have been pushing 30% for months. Americans are saving more and spending less. What do you think will happen when Covid is gone? The pent up demand for leisure activities is through the roof. People will want to go to movies, vacations, live events and of course cruise!"
"Just like the military requires immunizations before a family moves, the cruise industry will need to implement something similar. At the very least, until a vaccine is developed, there will need to be a certificate of health issued after a standard test is run within 48 hrs prior to departure for all passengers AND crew. A quick visit to a Quest to have it done. Easy Peasy. The CDC's questionnaire is pretty worthless, I can tell you having completed one. Did you notice that the ship is going to a ""non-commercial"" port? That means Military. The protocols are pretty strict there. They know how to do it."
CCL has doubled its dividend in 2 years. Wow!
"There is no dumbing of share right now. Dumping is not the reason for the decline in price. If some of you have noticed there are certain group of stocks that go up in price even though the S&P and Dow are down. And visa versa, when the Markets are up these curtain stocks are down. CCL, MGM, BA and a few other are in this group. If you remember back in March 18-19 thru mid April there was a huge surge of buying cheap stocks. Well, it's been one full year and that 15% tax rate looks pretty good about now. The sellers hold a bit for themselves and re- buy more without falling into the ""whitewash"" because the differential was a profit. That's why CCL is fluctuating without a major down turn. And because we all know full sailing is much closer now and $44 CCL is right around the corner. I can even see a price tag of $70 next year. The dividend is two years out possibly three years until the full $0.50 per quarter per share is ok'ed. Buying now at $26 means the payoff of 7.7% annual return PLUS a double in principle by mid next year to $52 and a triple in principle a year after that at $72."
CCL ONLY HAS 550 MILLION IN CASH/ 11 BILLION DEBT
Oh no. My overall gain on CCL dropped from 74% to 71%. What shall I ever do.
"Reminder- CCL is still WELL below it's average 5 year blended P/E of 19.7. It currently sits just above 15P/E. Price to operational cash flow, P/OCF is only 8.1! With an A financial rating, only 20% debt to cap, this ship is sturdy as ever, plenty of room for divies, div increases and buybacks."
short positions and puts going to be smoked once vaccine approval in the US. Holding my $10.5 avg I picked up in march all the way to tendie town
big run up here
EARNING is out... big big LOSS
so glad I never listen to Christopher!
"National Guard activated, let's book a cruise."
"$RCL reports much smaller loss today, CDC removes no-sail ban, no changes to Fed actions in foreseeable future$70+ by July is my guess, anyone think it can go even higher than that? The sky is the limit now! CONGRATS to all Longs!"
CEO said this weekend the company may never recover from the pandemic and people still buying... people here are saying they’re selling and people still buying. Does retail study fundamentals and listen to the CEO?
"Just buy 2,000 shares @ $12. Last week this time around $14 and 2 weeks ago this time $18."
"Go buy mrk, Covid-19 has not gone away, vaccines not 100% effectiveness, nobody is willing to take risk to go traveling, mountains of debt will sink ccl"
"Common Shorties!!As the CEO, Arnold W. Donald answered @ CNN, CCL understands the psychology behind the market in a short term.Please be aware that we have here a market leader, an undervalued dividend pearl, highly innovative company with lots of patents wrt. digitalization, a company who knows how to make good PR (cf. todays news from Trump himself!), still money in the pocket and many ways to decrease the operating costs, and most in my opinion most important a BOARD MEMBER who is owning over 17% of the shares, MIKE ARISON, talking to our president, trying to fight for his company, for the shareholders, making the company great again as before Corona crisis. Looking at the shareholder structure, the balance sheets, the market share of CCL, and the current value, that among us, if WE ARE PATIENT AND LOYAL, will be the sun waiting after the storm (with no Iceberg in between :) )."
"What the Feds are preparing to do is provide loan guarantees to the airlines who are in significant financial stress that they will default on Debt payments. Airlines have had significant profits in recent years. Don't see any of the majors requiring such assistance, although it will be available to them. During the 2008 financial crisis, those loan assistance were extended to GM, Chrysler and Ford at the time. Ford declined."
What is important is that short interest is 33% of float and this adds volatility to price movement including short squeezes like we experienced recently.
I know the shorts will love this but ... I'm getting worried. Thinking about selling. 1200 shares @11.50 basis. I've made my money and can't see any reasonable positive catalyst in the near future. I'll catch this thing again below $12...because it looks like that's where we're headed.
"“In our haste to keep guests and travel agents informed, we posted some information that was not finalized. As we have said previously, guests should expect mask, testing, distancing and other protocols. We intend to provide more details over the coming weeks as we work to resume operations.”Yeah sure. ""we posted some information that was not finalized"". If it was not ""finalized"" then why did you posted it? The only reason you removed it from your website was after realizing that no one (except Robert, of course) will go cruising with these restrictions. Now you can take your time (""weeks"") to finalize them and hope that people forget by then."
"Even if cruise season comes back. The stock is already priced to perfection. There is too much debt (28B debt only 9B cash), added share dilution (recent $1B share offering); and too high of forward p/e (33). PT $22"
David became an author. Each post is a chapter long.
Cruises Resume Sailing in July According to CDC!! $70+ by July on this stock at the minimum!https://www.wsj.com/articles/cruise-lines-could-start-u-s-sailings-by-mid-july-cdc-says-11619670325
"28 today, the pullback was short-lived"
i dont think you guys know how much of a bull i was on this.. i bought this WAYYYYY lower and more bears on this board at the time than right now.. Carnival is in worse shape than when I bought in at. They raised money but to the detriment of the company. People said carnival cant raise money in the beginning. People said bankruptcy. Dilution. Guess who bought it then. I did. I made a lot on this but this is going to be a rollercoaster and the falls are absolutely frightening.
earnings ?
"Full disclosure; I am an unhappy long in CCL. I got excited around the time of the vaccine news and wanted another post covid play and went with the strongest cruiseliner since I already had some Boeing, and was nicely rewarded for it. Since making the purchase, I have been looking for an out because there is just too much uncertainty and frankly my money can be making me money elsewhere in the market instead of either staying the same, or long down further in the short term.All this notwithstanding, there is something weird going on with this stock. I would normally have expected the latest highs in this stock to be dead cat bounces and for us to test the lows again but that hasn’t been the case and it’s been propped up somewhere around the $20 mark. That might - and I say might because there is no real way for me to know - be a signal of movements upwards to come, and not necessarily because of any particular reason, just because there is demand for the stock. It might, on the other hand, be retail investors like yours truly propping this thing up, and if that’s the case then I assume that this part is coming to an end soon - just a matter of when the money dries up. As a pessimist, generally, I tend to always be more bearish than bullish and so I’m expecting a drop in the near term and a retesting of some type of low. What do you guys think?"
the bull flag is break out. CCL is flying to the moon.
RCL cancelled cruises that we to leave from Bermuda
CCL SELLOFF take profits and buy later on the dip
"if it's true that only 3% of vacations are spent on cruise ships, this stock is gonna double by the time they get their 9 LNG ships delivered. Don't forget about the 5% dividend while you wait."
crusie lines are.no brainers...people gonna be buying up to firatbsailing
Buying this is worth the risk
Oh Yeah! On our way to $65!
"The current downturn in the cruise business is unprecedented, but CCL is well equipped to survive it, with access to capital through asset sales or mortgages. Add to this a very loyal and growing hoard of customers that really, really loves the cruise experience, despite the increasingly obvious drawbacks. Actual FCF is much greater than it appears as regular spend on new ships are not just replacements but are generally growth initiatives. Running with limited capital spend the FCF would be immense, around $2B per year on $5B in EBITDA (normalised). MIM puts fair value for CCL close to $40 at 9.4x EBITDA and 14x FCF."""
Flying up $30 today
Are the cruise lines going to go up to their value before Covid with no cruises? And then where do they go?
Food for thought Remember that the Saudi wealth fund bought an 8.2% stake in Carnival Cruise Line. They know that CCL is a great investment.
people are loading for this next move up. Upgrade at 33  Stonk cruises 
Wonderful prices today! Great day!
"Carnival has not formally confirmed its next earnings publication date, but the company's estimated earnings date is Thursday, June 18th, 2020 based off prior year's report dates."
CDC no sail pump dump 26.40
Worlds opening up. Carnival has a $50-100% upside to retrace to pre-pandemic.
"Today I'm buying 7000 shares of CCL. I hope I made a good investment in 1-2 years, otherwise I'll have to say goodbye to my money..."
"Carnival will launch a cruise between Central African republic and Paraguay in 2031, this is a strong buy stock"
"I would wait to buy this stock. The US may close all ports to cruise ships, and......if the Grand Princess turns out to be infected, God help CCL. They had better have a boatload of liability insurance. Crews will begin walking off the ships."
"15 minutes ago I write what will happen, look at the trend, it’s not rocket science, buy and hold, it’s very simple."
"I got out today, but why the drop AH?"
David are you buying some of those senior notes too?
CCL now owns 2 more ships Mardi Gras since Friday and today Costa firenze 2021 it's time to sail
Guys how long till this stock doubles in price you think? asking for a friend
"@David @Kaith @Dean, please explain why would they extend the pause of their UK-based cruise vacations if everyone will be vaccinated by end this month, or next month? Does it make sense to you? How about that maybe, just maybe, they ran out of money AGAIN and thus can't even resume cruising? No money to restart. hehehehehe. You know what's coming next????? That's right, diluting your shares. hehehehehe. I knew this will be a great trade. Target remains $22."
Vaccination will begin in the next few weeks. COVID 19 will soon become a bad memory.
no fundamentals. pure emotions. prove me otherwise. keep buying. i love the smell of smoked bacon.
Probably the last chance to load up around 28
$13 tomorrow! No worse news can really come out. Things starting to turn. Carnival should gain momentum from here on out.
"With almost 40 million shares shorted here, the jump could be tremendous. Oh boy, remember that Saudi's money backs this."
"Under the Framework for Conditional Sailing Order, cruise lines would need to verify that 98% of crew members and 95% of passengers are fully vaccinated in order to bypass test cruises, The Wall Street Journal said."
Been calling it out since I sold at 30. Carnival will not open this year. You investors are the bag holders. The famous pump and dump. How much are you willing to lose?
"stop spamming gifs and images, dilutes the conversation and is childish"
"This is getting to be more logical, I'm still targeting 15/16$ due to dilution, income, and debt. but I'm open to start buying small chucks around 19$"
"Higher lows 23,24,25 Now we need to get to 31 or higher and stay above at least 30s for more than a day. I know long way to go but this can move quickly."
We are human being and we forget so quickly. We will travel and we will cruise even more.
Again wiped out 5 days losses in one day. buy the dips its easy money.
Will start sailing very soon. Carnival is hiring ASAP gotta say something
17 dollars by the end of the month...
Anyone interested in joining you know how to contact me if you have bee.......

"dollar cost average into your favorite recovery stocks....block out all this noise.....when the economy is fully open maybe end of 21 or early 22...its going to be a huge huge party like we have never seen, we cant be locked down forever, use common sense and hold on tight"
Type “1” if you took profits today. (You won) Type “L” if you want to see profits fall again tomorrow.
Give them test cruises by sailing out of non American ports!
more big buying coming
"i couldn't resist, i shorted in AH, hope i was right."
"This is all option related. This is the last week of the $27-$28 calls. Hardly any options for a week Friday, then after that there are loads in the $30+This is pure MM's keeping it at the price they want, and has been like this for a few weeks now, Also a lot of resistance in the mid $27's. So all looking good, don't forget we ran 40% last month. You can see there are no sellers as such, so sit back and when it runs, it will run...It will run again next week."
Rule #1 of fight club: Don't talk about fight clubRule #1 of investing: Don't panic sell
"Thanks god, i sold 2 days before. Blood bath today"
CCL current booked customers can still keep their booking for different days if they are not cancel....but the cost will go higher once they wait
"The filing of a shelf registration statement is often met with derision, and considered a bad omen that shareholder dilution is around the corner. ... Filing of an S-3 shelf registration signals to the market that a financing is forthcoming, thus creating an overhang on the stock, depressing its performance."
Did the judge rule???? 
Last chance to buy so cheap. Will be trading over 28 tomorrow
How is it possible this is up 15%?
"Surely there must be at least one or two astute, brilliant posters here today that bought 10,000 shares @$16.66 and sold @ $19.06? Just saying...."
"Covered position from $21.30, PUTS are making a killing.I love “Inverted Hammers”.Good Luck!"
Glad I sold 125 shares at peak of $27.22!! Now just holding 30 shares 25 @ $8 & some change and different portfolio 5 at $26
"WHOOMP, THERE IT IS! UP 4%!"
Thank you gregory for your concern for us all who are long.... the stock is down 70% or more from the high’s and you wont be satisfied until it goes to zero based on your comments.Cruise industry will return and much sooner than you think.Bridge loans will be available per Trump which will provide financial cushion should it be needed.If you day trade then yes tomorrow the stock might be lower but if you buy down here with a 6-12 month time horizon you stand to make a fantastic profit.
I like this boy.https://youtu.be/zvu3RdCWBlM
22 Billion loss to travel industries. Not sure how anyone is buying at least not till this virus is contained and after earnings
CDC just loosened the mask rules for cruise ships... look out!
"My attempt at being a chartist today. CCL has strong support at about $12. RCL has support in the $34 to $35 range. If NCLH gets back to $11 (the 42 million share offering price), and CCL and RCL hold above their support then it will be a long grind for the shorts to push the cruise stocks lower in a sidways market.I think there has been a rotation out of the bottom feeding stocks with the new money now flowing to the frothy tech stocks where they are late to the party (and will get burned). So for the cruise stocks it is the shorts against the charts for now. With any good news on the COVID-19 front resulting in the next pop up."
Hanging tough CCL!
Here come the GIFS...All aboard!
"You can never fully trust a Chinese executive, but this one claims 56,000 Chinese citizens were given Sinopharm's vaccine before traveling out of China and not a single one came down with COVID.Hopefully our government agencies and scientist will become a little more pragmatic now that the elections are over. Or on the other hand, they could just give the virus another year to mutate unchecked, then they can pat themselves on the back for knowing with certainty that today's vaccine won't work on next year's virus...https://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1206008.shtml"
"Maybe some folks ought to look at the daily update on the virus . I am not say panic, I am saying prepare. Slow youre travel plans, try and help stop this thing. Everyone slow down and consider the trendhttps://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"

UBS upgrades Carnival to buy....raises price target to $42. 
"CCL will continue a nice upward trend going forward! Stay LONG and enjoy a rare opportunity like this to make money !! The cruise industry, very soon, will begin rebuilding its financial reserves. A bright future awaits! Jg"
"NCLH suspends cruising until end of June. What happened to talk of June being a ""red line"" for cruise companies to restart operations? And RCL's comment that CDC rules were ""any day now"". Cruise stocks still higher than when I thought they should be sold - but that is the market - I would be surprised if CDC allowed for full cruising even by July 4 as the CDC /Biden specially targeting ""small gatherings"" by then and CDC still advises against all non-essential travel. Cruise stocks burn a lot of cash every month when not cruising. Future is unpredictable, but I am willing to bet that if CDC still not allowing go-ahead for cruising come July 4 cruise stocks will be lower than they are today."
Running out of time to get out.
The virus tests coming later today WILL confirm an epidemic aboard this second ship. For the cruise industry this will be MUCH worse than the second plane crash was for Boeing.
Qtrly report came with negative -6.07/Share. Its just 3 months ended May 31. Negative EPS is good or bad for shareholders? http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/Q/summary2/?id=8119776
Looks like sailing to begin this summer is a GO!CCL = Strong Buy!!!
"hey guys, there is no need to sell ccl at such a low price, just hold it and ride it to 50"
"The real question is whether this makes a good investment based on the significant change in the capital structure. In other words, even if sailings and revenue were go back to last year's numbers, stockholder have been diluted, will have further dilution based on the the convertible and the company now has additional debt with substantially higher interest cost. To get back to previous ""normal"" value, all of the following has to happen:1. Revenue must go back to previous levels; AND2. The company must buy back the 30% of shares it has/will issue3. The company must pay down all the new debt and/or refinance the debt so interest payments are equal to the previous amounts"
"@Issay.. did you see @David joined us..@David “@Keith I have 6000 shares I shorted just before close for tomorrow only with limited downside risk.

"As Carnival sinking slowly beyond the horizon, we'll hear less chatter on this board."
This is a good start to a nice day..... and end the week with a real upswing$CCL
"An article today at Seeking Alpha of Carnival Corp. Says this in one of the points:A lookback valuation suggests Carnival was significantly undervalued prior to the pandemic, and an updated earnings model suggests the stock is modestly undervalued now."
Are you really betting against recovery? 15 minute COVID19 Tests coming your wayyyy....https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-what-to-know-about-abbotts-15-minute-covid-19-test-11598982464
"The Bottom Line on CCL StockIn a research note, Wells Fargo analyst Timothy Conder noted that Carnival will need to raise $4 billion to $5 billion. To raise such money, Carnival will have to dilute the value of its stock. Keep in mind that its market cap is only about $9.5 billion. As a result, Conder took his price target on the shares from $55 to $6."
why there is a sudden drop?

HOW ABOUT THAT!!!! Take that to the bank SHORTY!!"
Man this really wants to go green even on a big down day.
Hey guys should I buy from these levels or wait a little longer? Considering the price I think it's really good position to start accumulating
Wow today it wouldn’t matter which cruise line you went with it was a good day for all
TIME TO LOAD UP ON CCL WITH STIMULUS MOOLAH! SUPER DEAL FOR 10X IN 3 MONTHS!
"I own 12,000 shares at $24 per share and I am bullish on this stock, but lately I have been having doubts as to how long it could take to get back up to $24. Since we don’t have a handle on Covid and the ships are docked, they are burning through their cash. Even if a cure was discovered tomorrow, it would be several months before everyone is immunized and feel comfortable cruising. My gut tells me to hang tight, but I don’t want to be holding these shares, if they run out of money and have to restructure. I don’t know why the stock price increased this week, since the short-term looks bleak. I can’t afford to lose this investment. Constructive advice would be appreciated."
"I don’t think so but my bets are on the very profitable Grow Generation. Oh, Tilray too."
Insiders bailing since beginning of year 
"Mortality rate dropping and the recovery rate is accelerating despite rising cases and no vaccine.. Do we even need a vaccine anymore at this point?.. Left media been using the ""rising cases"" card but they can't backtrack and say well there was more testing done because that would point out Trump actually did more testing.. This whole coronavirus is a witch hunt and the media NEEDS to be held accountable."
"@issay Are you there? Are you seeing this? I can post the screen shot here but would rather have you own up to it.Why don't you own up to it right here and right now and tell the good people here that you said ""You have never closed your position on CCL"" and that @issay is @Bill"
Waiting on CDC's decision!
I just looked at Carnival and Royal Caribbean cruise deals and they haven't changed pricing that much. You can get a somewhat decent deal in April but it's not not that much of a discount. That should tell you plenty of people are cruising and demand isn't as bad as you might think.
CRUISING RESUMING IN JULY!! BOOKINGS UP 200%!! WE WILL SAIL PAST $30 REAL SOON SO THIS IS A GREAT BUYING OPPORTUNITY...ALL ABOARD!!! :))
Staying above $12.20 is key to trend today. New Director added to Board should help.
"GREAT NEWS from CDC, restrictions Finally being lifted. Cruise lines are gathering personnel and cruising should begin in July!!! CCL stock is ready to take off!! jg"
Shopping day today
Massive short squeeze is here! It can be squeezed up to $23 today! Hold on. Do NOT sell to shorts!
CCL could open anytime soon from now on based on people who already did vaccine shots!!!
Will the 1:30 PM algo boys try to push for $29.50 or will they sell off to $27.I bought $29 PUTS.. Let see!
"The 2019 US annual intelligence report: "" “Although the international community has made tenuous improvements to global health security, these gains may be inadequate to address the challenge of what we anticipate will be more frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases because of rapid unplanned urbanization, prolonged humanitarian crises, human incursion into previously unsettled land, expansion of international travel and trade, and regional climate change,”What was Trump's action to prevent this? "" In May 2018, Trump’s aides dismissed the National Security Council’s global health security staff and moved to cut its budget. The White House also cut the budgets of the Centers for Disease Control and the Department of Health and Human Services, and closed the federal government’s $30 million Complex Crises Fund."" From https://time.com/5799765/intelligence-report-pandemic-dangers/"
Oh no! It looks like the bearish party is over. I’m glad they had their fun while it lasted. Closing around $29.50 range is my guess.
"Nice day. Market sideways and we are up 4.5%. Bodes well for tomorrow, some follow through."
"Thanks for the cheap shares pre-market, I'll sell them back to you higher when you are forced to cover."
Let me tell you the 4 step plan!!-Lift sale order (check)-Trump 2020-Stimulus-VaccineThe other three will fall into place next week!Buy now!!! This will sky rocket!
IRS moves tax deadline to mid May in the US.
"Dont know why so many people are in my ear telling me to sell my cruise line stocks. Well if you were an INVESTOR you'd know that post pandemic this will be back in the 50+ range. Yes, it may take some time but thats what you do as an investor!"
My condolences to those who thought this was a short opportunity today
I’m hoping we drop to at least 25$ a share again so I can load up!!! I don’t expect to see 20$ a share again.
"I hope the Biden Administration brings in the expertise of VP Kamala to get things straightened out with the CDC. On top of that, the cruise lines need to bring in Hunter and Kamala's niece as advisors or something, then my PT would jump significantly for CCL."
Lol thanks for the free calls going into vaccine news hahahaha
Cases in US are back on the decline. This will go up.
Just my opinion only. Once the ships start sailing the passengers will be spending more money onboard than ever before.Its been a while for the frequent cruisers.
FYI I bought in at 17.81 and I will be very comfortably holding until 25$ Minimum. $CCL In my opinion is one of the last stocks “on sale” because of COVID-19. As in I doubt anyone will be buying a company of this calibre specifically $CCL this cheap again anytime soon unless god forbid another pandemic hits. Operations are resuming very very soon on September 6th and their earnings reports will look better and better through the coming months and years.
"the earnings warning from CCL is only a starting position . They only estimate the effect of asian routes until April . The earnings are going to see further impact ......This is What CCL says ""Carnival Corp. issued updated earnings guidance on Wednesday, speculating on the impact of suspending its cruise operations in Asia until the end of April due to the coronavirus, or Covid-19.It said such measures would affect its 2020 financial performance by $0.55 to $0.65 per share, an estimate which includes what it would have to pay in guest compensation.The company added: “The impact on global bookings will further affect the company’s financial performance. The company is currently evaluating contingency plans to mitigate the impact and will provide an update with its first quarter 2020 earnings release in late March.”It is going to tank 2020 and 2021"
"Didn’t I say 1 billion is peanuts? This is only going up , they got cash and back in business soon good luck"
All the ships almost are ducked in US ports. They can use them for hospitals if necessary. We have them in Florida Miami Texas Seattle etc. I dont wish to anyone this can happen but that cud be great security investing in the company. Either way is win win situation. Any thoughts?
best stock I have in my portfolio right now
&&&& Gave you all a warning 3 days ago to sell. The stock is going to slump all the way past 20$. So overvalued right now. They people who invested early are gonna sell and take their gains and leave you all hang
looks like we are going to follow the 5min candle to the RSI line and bounce back from $15.81 support. My predication at closing will be $16.19 today. lets see if i'm close
"Not enough volume to launch this lol, it’s going to take US cruising news to get this to $30 or above"
How are these pumpers disagreeing with the CEO. Carn CEO doesn’t see a recovery anytime soon. Why are buyers disagreeing with the CEO? Definitely odd.https://thehill.com/homenews/news/543162-carnival-ceo-cruise-industry-wont-be-back-to-normal-until-2023
"Looks like we hit support yesterday! Watch out SHORTY McSHORTERS, CCL will be back to $29 shortly!"
"Director Randall weisenburger sells 538,762 shares at an average price of 27.50$ available share count will prob drive price down?"
So many cruise ships heading to LA to get the crew members Vaccinated!!!
This stock is now officially in the hands of day traders
"So far looking good. If it repeats yesterday's trend, we should close at $20.35 today."
What is the price that people want to buy......at a realistic price?
"Only upbeat news will be coming out of earnings conference call, get in early as this will break $30 this week."
MMs shaking the tree as they want in cheaper after massive upgrades 
how long till dividend cut? next week??
"LMAO! go through David's old posts (I don't have to, I already know) and see how many time he tells longs to mute shorts. HAHAHAHA. Now he admits he went short this afternoon. So ""honest"" David, you urge longs to stay long or buy more without telling them that you are planning to go short.....What a nice guy you are."
"To all longs here. Please share with us why do you think people will go cruising with these new restrictions? Please tell us why would someone pay money to go on vacation on a ship, to be locked in their cabin most of the time? Unable to use the pool, or wait long lines? Please explain why this would be a great vacation."
"I've bought at 12.7$ and I'm here for long term, I'm waiting for this company to recover and yeild me me some dividents, all the day traders here doing a lot of noise, let's meet in 2 years and see who made more money."
Back to $30 we go. Will be at least $33 by Friday.
Extremely frustrating stock to own over the past three months.

OMG! Take advantage of these free trade ideas. Just go to (http://buystox.net)
lots of nervous nellies out there
Don’t say I didn’t warn you guys we should be heading below 25
A few short days ago CCL was under $9/share. Then Trump promised a handout to everyone and specifically mentioned Cruise lines by name. CCL almost doubled its stock price on that news.Then the bailout package was revealed and Cruise lines were pointedly red-lined out of the budget for help.CCL is headed back down below $9. I will be a buyer at $9 and below. But understand a couple things:1. Time horizon is 18 months out 2. The Dividend will be stopped. Not maybe. not cut a bit...but completely stopped. It will be about 18 months before the dividend can be reinstated. Good luck all.
I have a question. I also have tech. Why is it when travel is up tech is down and vice versa?
CCL starts its journey to $21 in mid December and $30-$32 in June 2021Mark my estimates*****
"Carnival's Junk Credit Rating Could Become Even Junkier.The credit rating on cruise ship operator Carnival (NYSE: CCL)(NYSE: CUK) is already considered junk, but after a new review by ratings agency Moody's, it could fall even further into junk territory.https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/carnivals-junk-credit-rating-could-become-even-junkier-2021-02-10"
"Six equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, twelve have issued a hold rating and four have given a buy rating to the company's stock. The stock presently has a consensus rating of ""Hold"" and a consensus target price of $17.16.https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-ccl-consensus-analyst-rating-2021-01/"
"Wow, it is 4:50 ET in the morning, and CCL is trading at $18.36! I sure hope this is an indication of how the day will shape up going forward! I can't try to cover until 7:00 AM anyway, but what a NICE thing to wake up to first thing in the morning!"
Carnival has scheduled a conference call with analysts this Friday so they can help analysts understand the financial health of their company.
Nice close at the high of the day. I say we see 30+ next week . GLTA. @ Christopher not a bad call of 26.60 didn't quite make it but close. Hope u covered. Good luck all
"The numbers and data don’t lie, now that they are restricting travel by plane and boat this stock will be going way down, be smart and wait to buy it when it gets cheap around $15-$18, patience is a virtue, rest assure this is dropping first thing in the morning."
"Let me ask you this question, do you think CCL will not survive through this?If so, sell or short all you want. Otherwise, buy, so simple.I have a position in this, and strongly believe that the end of the tunnel is approaching."
The world is testing our fearless leader. Any voter remorse out there?
Hope everyone has there shorts orders in the run up was to fast
In with 100 $28.50 PUT at $40.Good Luck Shorts.

I think what happened to Tesla shorthers will happen to CCL shorters. So we might see 30-40s in the short term. It’s a good risk we have so little room to go down while huge upside
"NEWS FROM THE CEOThe most notable news today was from Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, who said he thinks ""most, if not all"" of its fleet will be in operation by the end of 2021. At worst, he thinks early 2022 will see the full fleet active. A huge uncertainty for cruise lines has been when they'll be able to return to action. The longer the pandemic keeps people off cruises, the more companies need to keep their businesses afloat and the more uncertainty when any payback will come to shareholders. If Donald is seeing a quick recovery by the end of 2021, that's extremely bullish for the industry. It's not clear exactly what a recovery will look like for cruise lines. Vaccines are expected to be widely available in the U.S. by summer, and some companies are considering vaccine passes that would allow for more open movement than current restrictions. That could also be possible on cruise lines, where passenger safety will not only be a priority for operators, it'll be key to getting customers to board ships."
"COVID19 MASKS, VIRUS SPREADING ETC. IS SUUUCH OLD NEWS!!! THE NEXT BATCH OF NEWS IS RE-OPENING ECONOMIC BOOM IN THE U.S. OF A! AND PEOPLE FLEEING THEIR COOPS TO VACATION INTO CRUISES WILL BE THE NEW NEWS!"
Any company that goes through tough times would become more leaner.Expect the profit margins to be very healthy.
And who is the wise guy that said CCL will close at $30 yesterday???? :-)
Shorts....are ya kind of bumming......just a little.....go ahead admit your short comings. CCL = $$$$$
"After covid, they made sure they come back stronger woth high preformance fleet, all the old ships they deleted"
"""One reason to be bearish on Carnival is the company’s balance sheet. Back in November 2019, CCL had total debt of $11.5 billion. Now, debt has swelled to $28.4 billion as of November 2020"""
can this hit 15 by friday?
New CCL itinerary just announced:5 - Day Miami Cruise. You board at the Port Of Miami. We separate 500 ft from the dock and we just float there for 5 days. Book your trip now.
What the!......it’s up a dollar thirty after hours!! How come?
"Market pressure plus a 40% rise without many major pullbacks. Glad it rebounded at support levels and from 1pm rose into the close. Rising as it has with the markets we are having bodes well. May correct a couple more bucks at worse, but certainly would be adding if it does. Time will tell. Good luck longs."
No Bailout for Vacation cruise ship companies. There non essential.
"29 today, over 30 tomorrow"
When is the next stimulus check coming? I think I lost it all on those Mar 16 $30 Calls .
"CCL will shut down soon.....perhaps a 2 month holiday. It will give CCL management time to think about how they have treated their customers who have canceled because of the Coronavirus......reach out to them, and issue credits for a future cruise. There is still time to make this right. :-)"
Steven i have a question for you. How much money have you made with stocks so far since the crash in March?
But waiting until July to sail is costly.new shares???
"well that was an easy 6% gain, I'm out  cant be strong recovery with their debt. Yet In wrong more times than I'm right according to the Mrs"
"CCL is expected to post a quarterly loss of $1.78 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -369.7%.Revenues are expected to be $1.30 billion, down 73.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 329.06% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Those are the official predictions. Absolutely terrible numbers. But the actual result WILL be WORSE, big MISSES on EPS and Revenue estimates. The company is BLEEDING money, 105 ghost cruise ships incurring hundreds of millions of dollars in costs every single day as they sit doing nothing, day after day, for months, with no endgame in sight. The true nightmare comes with looking forward. The company can CHARGE money to book future cruises, but every single PENNY has to be refunded if the ship does not sail. It doesn't matter if the refund is cash, or just a credit for a FUTURE DATE cruise. Doesn't matter because it is still a 100% revenue LOSS for the cancelled cruise. Therefore you CANNOT believe any revenue numbers that are projected going forward, as it is impossible for anyone to know when even a SINGLE ship, much less all 105, will be allowed to sail. So, this next earnings report will deliver absolutely terrible numbers, we KNOW that for SURE. We also know for sure that the NEXT quarter will also deliver terrible numbers, because we already have many days of ZERO sailings that HAVE passed, AND we know there is literally zero chance of any sailings happening before August. We also know for SURE that ANY Guidance that might be provided at this next ER would be absolutely worthless, pure speculation, and a shameless attempt by the company to prop up share price. Because it is IMPOSSIBLE for the company to know when or if they will be able to set sail with any ship, much less all of their ships. We also know, those of us who regularly do Pure Earnings plays, that many stocks will run up in price in the days before an ER, based upon positive speculation and irrational exuberance. But my bet is that we have already seen the run-up on Friday, because of the existing extreme over-valuation that I perceive, based upon the financials I outline above. The current AND future financial outlook going forward. So, I am VERY happy to be Short a lot of shares, and feeling confident this will sell off in a serious way on Monday. In at $19,97, I will be looking to Cover at the $18.00 level."
"FYI I have no position in this stock or any other stock, long or short. I might consider RCL or CCL at half of what they’re currently trading in, nothing higher. Encourage you all to read some 10K’s and educate yourselves instead of blindly following hope."
climbed before earnings report? IT CRASHES ON EARNINGS REPORT THEN
"Heck Yeah, ""BIG GAINS""!Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) It’s hard to imagine a worse scenario for the cruise line industry than the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, these stocks were battered and bruised in 2020 while cruise ships stayed docked. However, what’s intriguing about a company like Carnival Corp right now is that there is likely a ton of pent-up demand for cruise vacations. Just look at the fact that Carnival reported advance bookings in Q1 that were up 90% from the prior quarter. The company also saw FY22 bookings running ahead of the strong pre-pandemic levels seen in FY19, confirming that there are still plenty of people ready to hit the open seas.The recent mask update from the CDC is also fantastic news for cruise lines, and investors should view Carnival as a stock with significant upside given that it's still trading well below its pre-pandemic price levels. While this is a company that will report losses this year and still faces a lot of rough waters ahead, there’s a good chance that investors are underestimating just how quickly passenger counts and trips will rise as we continue to receive positive news out of the CDC. Once we have more details about a conditional sailing order and cruises actually start happening again, Carnival stock could be in for big gains."
28.80 finish
$8.70 entry point... I’m tempted to sell but doubt I will ever get it again at 8.70
Champiin must be a SHORTY SHORTERON! Seems likely the GIFs really TRIGGER shorties on CCL Rocket ship days!
"I really admire the tenacity and the conviction of the bulls here, and whoever was involved in that 1 million upward share volume move. I cannot for a single moment, figure out how life would return back to normal, how airlines can fly people safely at a profit. If they sell less seats, they'll have to jack up the price for overhead, but we WILL be staring at a depressed economy, so how are they going to fill those planes? If people don't fly as much, then how are these customers going to get to the cruise ships? Sailors will have to buy expensive air plane tickets, and possibly more expensive cruise ship tickets as the cruise lines struggle to break even...I also don't get how the SP 500 dips only 15% after the ENTIRE WORLD stops operating for a good chunk of the year. A hold at this position, is saying, ""This company will at the very least operate at a break even, so that the money the borrowed to last until the end of the year, will hold"". I used to spend money, like my money lasted forever, now, I spend money like I'll never be employed again. I cannot imagine this having little to no impact at all. Unemployment numbers are going up, companies are filing for bankruptcy, companies are asking employees to forcing employees to ""volunteer"" quit, so they can still hold onto to that stimulus money. Governors are botching the COVID response. Trump wants to declare another trade war.What I DO get is Warren Buffet selling all his airlines shares, and how he's largely holding cash right now. Mr. Buy when everyone is freaking out, is selling... and hold cash. Mr. Buy and Hold forever... is holding cash.Against all this, somehow, the bulls found the conviction to hold, and amongst all this, they found a reason to buy, that's amazing. Tell you boys what, you flip this around, you can keep my money, consider it kudos money for your tenacity, perseverance, and optimism. You guys are seeing something that I definitely don't. I don't mind you guys telling me just THAT it is. Even if you're long, this is clearly not going to be the bottom, so... why?""Successful investing is about more than just buying winners. It's also about having the discipline to sell as information changes and the humility to know when you've made a mistake.""

"Here we are at $25.77 (down 6.22%) and still falling. Looks like we may hit $21 this week, IMHO."
"As a result of CCL'S COVID Testing of ALL Customers TWICE before boarding ship, CRUISING WILL BE SAFER THAN FLYING OR GOING TO GROCERY STORE & CCL LONGS WILL BE REWARDED!!!!! $35 BY 1/2021!"
Fauci announced jNJ approval in 2 weeks...Cruises sooner than expected
Its a scary thought thinking how bad this could get when the no sail order is extended until October (which it will as a minimum) and the earnings report is released based on having $0 income for the last quarter. Wooow
"I need to keep my mouth shut, That's all there is to it."
Reddit crowd into carnival and american airlines today. enjoy the ride!!!!
The RobinRookies got fried...again. Picked up some cheap shares today.
Interesting that Yahoo will not let me post the link about the CDC lift. I have tried 3 times and it keeps getting deleted. kind of like a positive trump article.
$CCL signed deals with $PFE to deliver vaccine by cruise ships to various ports and then drivers renting cars from $CAR will pick them up and distribute. That's why you see both $CCL and $CAR are shooting up. LOL
New daily high
All I keep hearing is how great this stock is but it is just dropping!
"From Bloomberg today-“Quite a turnaround,” tweeted medical researcher and author Eric Topol. “Who would ever have thought that the same country that couldn’t even get a COVID test working and scalable for two months could vaccinate more than 4 million people in a day?”More than 100 million Americans have gotten at least one dose, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, close to a third of the population. The daily rates are expected to rise further as vaccine-makers deliver a promised 700 million doses by the end of July.Americans are ready to travel. Now they are healthy enough to do so.CDC Director......... ""Let my People Go!"""
I am an inexperienced investor I will admit but I would have to think this is a safe investment. In 2 years people will be cruising again and this stock will be $45
"It's not looking good for a resumption of cruises this year. The spike in infections is probably going to cause the CDC to further restrict cruising. Also, the cruise ports are going to ban cruise ships so the ships will have nowhere to stop other than perhaps their private islands."
"Break through this $28 with a nice close, should see us to $33, Then through that to $40. Good Luck Longs."
My broker said Carnival is reporting tomorrow pre market. Does anyone have anything definitive?
"This 'analyst' Ader is completely out of his mind when calling cruise lines 'floating Petri dishes'. It's a matter of time before people understand that boats are the only place on earth where you finally can safely travel without people coming and leaving. I'd sign right now for an available non-stop cruise with testing before going aboard, and I'm not a cruise fan at all in normal time."
"Had puts, sold at 24.92, think ccl should close above 25..maybe high 24sI believe it'll be worth buying after the quarterly earnings. maybe.."
"Where are all the Shorts today? On a down day, they normally post all the doom and gloom! Maybe they have thrown in the towel?"
"CCL owned Aida cruises is starting sailing from Greece in May, big German market, great news!"
"Solid day, People stepping in buying every dip. Onwards and Upwards.... :)"

"Food for thought...Anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with covid 19?......What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the all clear?..... (My opinion...the election. Trump wins, it goes away to a reasonable approach which includes OPENING the Country. Biden wins, endless lockdowns to destroy small businesses)......Is it zero cases?......The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting. Which in my opinion is what we probably should do. Enough of this testing already...A huge number of people apparently aren't smart enough to understand positive testing doesn't equal to deaths... so the only way to calm the doom and gloom side of America down may be to simply quit testing.... OR get rid of the corrupt main stream media. How many of you got tested for the swine flu?, or get tested for tuberculosis or the common flu on a regular basis?.......So very convenient for a particular political party that Covid just happened to come about the very year of a critical election. Humm........Is a vaccine even going to end covid?....no.............It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed.......The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977........We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 30,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications EVERY year.......We already have a growing number of anti vaxxers refusing proven, tested, well known vaccines that have been administered for decades but aren?t necessarily safe!.......Do you really think people will flock to get a fast tracked, quickly tested vaccine, whose long term side effects and overall efficacy are anyone's best guess? ......How long are we going to cancel and postpone and reconsider?......You aren't doing in person school until second quarter?...third quarter? EVER?? And this is with a virus that has basically zero effect on people under 25!!.......When do we decide quality of life outweighs the less than 1% risks?.......We all understand that Covid can be deadly or dangerous for SOME people...VERY FEW PEOPLE actually...but so are strawberries and shellfish.......We take risks multiple times a day without a second thought.......When and how did we so quickly lose our free will and give up our liberty? I'll tell you how ...election season... and fraudulent fear mongering left-wing media and allowing corrupt governors and mayors to take over your lives for power grabbing,..that's how..........I understand that there is a minuscule possibility I could die, actually its far less than 1%, and that's IF I actually contract the virus......but if i do, I will most likely just end up feeling like #$%$ for a few days........I also understand I could possibly pass it to someone else, but I can pass on any virus onto someone else, like the flu or other issues like tuberculosis or any number of other complications we humans face on a regular basis........Where or how does this end?......We either get busy living or we stay occupied with worrying about dying. You have a better chance of getting hit by lightning if you're under 65 than dying by covid. Do all of you stay indoors in fear of being hit by lightning??.....When God above decides it's your time brother, you don't get any mulligans, so I would rather spend my time enjoying life with my family than worrying about a virus with a 99.9% survival rate....Just saying...."
"CCL continues to look VERY weak as we approach the open, and so does the entire market. I am happy to stay Short for now and I expect the stock to bounce around in price right at the open and for the first 15 minutes. Even if we get a bounce up to the $19 level, which is possible, I do NOT plan to Cover. Such a bounce might well be a DCB: Dead Cat Bounce, and I prefer to ride it out, expecting it to collapse and the stock to make lower lows. But of course there is always a risk with every trade and taking good profit when you have it, is a smart thing to do. :-)"
I don’t see how ccl can be below $30 when it starts to sail again. The demand for cruises is huge.
Which is a better buy ccl or ncl I hold both looking to add more shares
"Two ports in the United States are helping get cruise ship crew members vaccinated to facilitate the cruise industry getting back to service faster.On Friday, Port Canaveral became the first U.S. port to offer crew members a Covid-19 vaccine.Port Canaveral's option to give crew members the vaccine came a day after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees approved an expansion to vaccine eligibility in Florida to include individuals who are in the state for purpose of providing good or services for the benefit of residents and visitors of Florida"
"The media has spun $RCL's recent earnings report which was a total disaster and this craziness won't end well for the people chasing $RCL, $CCL, and $NCLH stocks. At the end of the day, a company is always valued by a stream of earnings and payments discounted by some required rate of return. If that wasn't the case, how could anyone compare a company's intrinsic value to its market value to determine if the stock price is under or overvalued? No matter what the media says, this concept will never ever change. There are so many companies that are undiscovered involved in industry changing technology like $ERIC that will turn a modest investments into ten of thousands of dollars. That's how you get rich folks. Why will $ERIC work as an investment? Because all carriers will upgrade their networks to 5G and eventually to 6G if they want to remain as going concerns. Like or hate the POTUS, he has ensured $ERIC will take away global business from Huawei and $ERIC will become the de facto global standard going forward."

CCL is receiving more and more chatter on Reddit so it seems not only will this be a momentum trade but also a solid bet on the impending recovery as states ramp up vaccinations. We saw this early on with PENN. Now it’s Carnival’s time.
"it's not a rally, it's a recovery they're still down 50% ytd their financials are more than stable now from everything they did to stay afloat and they're about to start sailing again, so it's share price is recovering. no news needed!"

"Cruise line operators Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. But the three companies aren't getting any help from Washington, D.C., as of now.Shares of all three stocks plunged between 12% and 20% Friday after the Senate and House passed a more than $2 trillion coronavirus aid package that did not include any money for them.The reason? The cruise lines all have headquarters in Miami, but none of them is legally based in the United States — which allows them to pay fewer taxes. Carnival is incorporated in Panama, while Royal Caribbean is headquartered in Liberia. Norwegian is incorporated in Bermuda.Republican US Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri noted that fact in a tweet earlier this week, urging them to move to America in order to qualify for aid.President Trump said in a news briefing Thursday that “it’s very hard to make a loan to a company when they’re based in a different country."""

The liberal CDC is punishing Florida and will stand in the way as long as possible. Screw them... open the ports and let the ships sail.... If you don't want to cruise then stay locked in your house with a mask on forever for all I care.
back to 15 soon

"Carnival's monthly average cash burn rate for the fourth quarter 2020 was $500 million, which was slightly better than expected due to the timing of capital expenditures. The company expects the monthly average cash burn rate for the first quarter 2021 to be approximately $600 million/per month. As well as Q2 2021 an additional loss of $600 million a month till start of Q3. Carnival's has 973 Million shares outstanding. In order to support a 600 million dollar a month burn rate they will have to issue an additional 350 million new shares at $24 at share. Look for this to happen soon. The shares will have to be diluted to support this debt. Or easy math multiply EPS (TTM) -13.21 times 973 million= (-12,853,330,000) That is a 12 Billion dollar loss. If you part out the remaining 19 ships and sell them for scrap the intrinsic value of the company is $12.43 per share before they issue new shares. https://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/24452-big-cruise-lines-are-still-burning-cash-here-s-how-much.html#:~:text=Carnival%20Corporation,-Carnival's%20monthly%20average&text=The%20company%20expects%20the%20monthly,to%20be%20approximately%20%24600%20million."
The reopening trades are absolutely ripping. Cruises specifically. It’s clear that the silent majority are long CCL and RCL. Very bullish trend and the vaccine news will only get better.
Carnival is trying to raise more cash prior to reporting dismal quarterly earnings (losses) and having to announce a delay in cruising until Sept. 2021 at the earliest. Good for Carnival that the stock price is at least 25% higher than a more practical evaluation would give.
It flashed red for 5 mins where’s Mr. blindly optimistic telling us he knew it was going down?
"Another solid day, Can't keep this old girl down, Hope anyone wanting to add/invest bought the dip. More meat to the announcement has seen people realize nothing has changed. So no reason for the sell off.Good luck longs.."
UBS upgraded Carnival to buy from neutral.
Wait till the American markets open this will drop even more
This should drop after earnings
When exactly the earnings has to be?
She’ll be coming around $13 she’ll be coming around $13
$29.54 premarket. Good morning shorts
It's time to board the ship now folks. By early spring a lot will be vaccinated and be back to sailing the high seas. The 1 year chart is pointing upwards now. It will be close to $50 in 1 year.
"The United States administered COVID-19 vaccinations to around 600,000 children ages 12 to 15 last week after regulators cleared Pfizer Inc’s (PFE.N) and BioNTech’s shots for use in that age group, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said in a media call on Tuesday."
We are days away from CDC lifting CSO.! HOP aboard the bus to the ports folks!!! CCL = STRONG BUY!!!
They just cut the value of Norwegian stock in half with the stock offering. That means getting back to the old highs is only 25.00. LOL. They are continuing to devalue the cruise liners. Not investable right now.
That’s all great news. This and CCL and many others were the buy of the century when the dow dipped to 18k. I bought $65k worth of CCL and $25k of RCL. Its already sitting at almost a double. Not even thinking of selling for 5 years
The widespread rioting in US cities is a clear example that people are done hiding at home with social distancing and health concerns. The same people will be cruising on Carnival this fall. All aboard!
Over 40% up since 2/1/21
"If you go to the CCL website, the company is buying back 100,000 shares of stock almost every business daysince the beginning of July. Obviously, CCL thinks it's shares are undervalued..... I was watching Cramer the other night and he was asked his opinion on CCL and Cramer said Buy! Buy! Buy!"
$13 tomorrow!
Dreams dreams dreams but the reality is this company is not profitable for the past year no revenue whatsoever and the dilution is unreal 15$ by next Monday.
Everyone here posting bullish comments but none buying in premarket today....hmmmmm. if 28.60 was undervalued then surely 27.48 is a better deal right? Bunch of pumpers..
which analyst said recently to wait for CCL for single digit?
Oh yeah....CCL = $$$BUY BUY BUY!
"i think we are seeing rotation in the market today. around 60% of the SP500 calculation is made from the 10 biggest companies (example AMZN). SP was down and followed the giants. the smaller tickers (like CCL, ITRI, ADM, NCR and WH) had a fairly good day. therefore, rotation; people are leaving safety since the price has been inflated and looking for value in smaller cap that's been left behind. people are not as fearful as they were a month ago (i do think we've already seenbthe bottom) . i hope you caught it."
Cruise lines and airlines down on an up day. Did everyone invest their vacation money in crude oil hoping to upgrade from interior to suite! (lol)
Do I buy more shares? I'm here for the long termI've bought already at 10.1 and 13.85
"One day soon you will wake up, turn on your phone and see ""CCL declares Bankruptcy""The stock will be down -96% on it's way to $0.00 and you will await the announcement of de-listing date.You will stay awake every night thinking ""Why did I invest in the worst company on the Stock Market that has $26 Billion debt and no way to make profit for over 10 years?""You will search for any crumbs of good news... There's isn't any.You log onto Yahoo Finance, You will see me here. My message will simply read ""I told you so""It could even be days away... Good Luck"
"Yes Cruiselines have added lot of debt. Yes it will take time to get back people happily cruising. But what will all those people do post pandemic after being miserable and confined at home? Out there traveling, eating out and cruising. So this will double in a year (at least) because going under is no longer a possibility."
I decided to add at $57.45. I like that price long term.
Why going down yesterday and today?
Now ccl tends to go up because there is no reason it should go down except being dragged down by the market.
"Betting against recovery, and every major pharmaceutical company and government in the world working to create a vaccine is foolish. The reality is that a vaccine is within weeks if not days from being fielded, and Carnival is and remains stronger than it's peers in the industry. As Thomas Yeung wrote in his article ""Carnival Stock Is a 200% Return Opportunity"" he points out ""Carnival Cruise lines is trading at just 0.6 times book value (compared to its long-term average of 1.9 times), and that even growth investors would be foolish to ignore this opportunity."" About CCL's worth and debt: Of the three major cruise lines, Carnival holds the least debt. Even now, its 1.1 times debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is far lower than RCL’s 2.2 and Norwegian’s 2.4. (It’s also true when you include second lien debt) Carnival is also the most consistently profitable. It earned the highest return on assets (ROA) in 2019 coming at 6.8%. Today, Carnival trades for the cheapest on tangible book coming in at 0.6x, and 7.5x on the price to cyclically adjusted PE (CAPE) ratios. About CCL's value: Using consensus estimates of a 2023 return to normalcy and factoring the company’s B1 bond rating (implying a 24.8% chance of bankruptcy), a two-stage DCF model shows a fair value of $46, almost a 200% upside. That would mean a 16.5 times CAPE ratio.Yeong ends his article with a bubble busting reality-check pointing out that in the short term ""It’s going to be a slow recovery for Carnival: generating $2 billion of free cash flow still means taking 4-5 years to fix its balance sheet. But for those foreseeing a quick coronavirus recovery, it’s essential to pull the trigger now.""as bargain pricing like this will not be around for long. I agree with Yeong's $46. TP by 2023. My position is bullish with a TP of $26 by Q2-2021 once cruising begins, and a vaccine is fielded around the world."

"Berenberg lowers Carnival to 'sell'Analysts at Berenberg lowered cruise operator Carnival from 'hold' to 'sell' on Friday, citing significant headwinds for the industry not yet factored into the group's current share price.The German bank price target for Carnival is $13.79https://www.sharecast.com/news/broker-recommendations/berenberg-on-carnival--7812187.html"
Anyone see what happened to Applied UV inc today after it announced its UV systems can kill airborne pathogens such as the covid virus....... its shares soared almost four fold. This could be a real game changer on board the ships. Watch this space!!
"European countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Latvia and Lithuania all resume their roll out of the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine after EU regulators confirm that vaccine is safe and effective."
Just booked 3 Day Bahamas cruise for Sep 7.
"I honestly wish Carnival pulls out of this and thatvwill come back to once it was but, as I spent years with CCl, there are things that they need to address and change.1. In all this armageddon from last year, CEO's hardly felt it on their compensations and yet all of them are literally competing to shell shares. For example HAL CEO sold shares almost same as he receivwd them in last 10 years. Same with AIDA CEO.2. Once you get up in hirerarchy in Company it is literally responsibility free ride:- huge money was invested in scrubbers - lost money for years to come, nobody responsible- LNG ships - apart from price in getting those ships, infrastructure vacuum, it is actually not green as it is advertised. Look where other shippers are looking, hydrogen mostly, - new markets opening, as for example Carnival Asia, nothing there for years to come as well. Why MSC does not go same root, they have years of experience from containers business, contacts etc. Because they know how chinese markets are working!- Cashflow management - Company was earning billions pre crisis and how much they kept in cash for rainy days? Barely 1 month of no operations. Even if they kept only 6 months worth of cash blow would be much softer. -Ted built this Company from nothing, making it swift, agressive, hungry and what we have now? We have 10-15CEO'S who are just sucking money and playing of try and fail games... -Lines overlapping: Princess/Hal for example. What is major differentiation in customer focus for example. Do we need them both? CUK/Cunard similar. I tried to ask those questions on earning calls but never reach somebody to address them, sadly.... But lets hope will be better...."
Another one on board :)Analyst Actions: Citigroup Starts Carnival at Buy With $30 Price Target
looks like insider selling
"As I write this, cruise is a little down pre-market, likely due to AstraZeneca pausing it's vaccine trails (temporarily, and out of an abundance of caution) because one participant had an adverse reaction. It's unclear what happened, it may not even have been the vaccine, they will pause until they can investigate, these pauses are a normal part of the process. This is not impacting the timeline of a vaccine, as the two front runners, Moderna and Pfizer, use a different technology and delivery system, and both are up pre-market. AstraZennaca is down less pre-market than some cruise companies$RCL $CCL $NCLH, if that gives an idea at the level of worry. Feel free to invest as you will, of course, but I suspect any momentary dips in cruise will be short lived. Vaccines are still likely landing late November, maybe even October, nothing has changed there. The 15 minute Covid-19 test likely to help restart cruise, and the real game changer, is totally unaffected. If you are long or investing long with the idea that vaccines, testing, and therapeutics will help restart the cruising industry sooner than expected, this pause with one company does not impact or change that strategy, or even hurt it's timeline."
Fuel prices expected to be double by this summer. Oil and gas prices rising will hurt and squeeze profits for the cruise lines. A smaller sized ship like Norwegians Spirit costs $80 grand per day on fuel. A larger ship like Freedom of the Seas can cost up to 2 million per day to fuel ?
Here comes
$25 by the end of NEXT WEEK. Guaranteed
"Hold on to ankles shorties, this has potential tomorrow to be up 10%+ could easy see $25 this week on follow through."
"David is now ""Bazillionaire""? Still the same David. Anyway, back to shorting CCL."
"I just have sent an email to CCL, that they should inform (with press releases) about there plans to guarantee secure sails (I know... but... like Nike.. just do it)E.g.:- Only vaccinated guests will be able to sail with us (from mm-tt-2021)- We have preordered nn'nnn vaccine doses at ??? and changed our processes in advance of a sail- Before boarding, our staff further will do an (actual) test to secure, that only negative guests can go aboardIf they are able to inform this way, this stock will fly!or similar..."
"CCL bookings are through the roof, and employees being called back by the thousands! Get ready longs, we are about to take off in July!CCL = Strong Buy!!!"
"With the current situation, nobody wants to go on cruises for at least 6 months. Schools are closed, people just work from home ... shopping malls are nearly empty"
Who wants to be stuck on ship with RONA spreading like wild fire. I love this stock in 2 to 3 years....but wait and buy below 10 again. This thing plummets if cruises resume before August and people are quarantined at sea. Ask my mom and dad how much fun that was...they are elite cruise members with over 70 cruises and have vowed to not take a trip for at least a year.
BAM THE SHORTS HAVE TO COVER.. TO THE MOON!!!
Shorts are like bunny in the headlight now. CCL starts to depart the port. Get on board and hold until $60 next year!
Well that didn’t last long. Bye bye shorts$CCL $RCL $NCLH
At some point from today and the elections we will have the vaccine news and this stock will rocket up for a week. Easily doubling to $32. This is going to be easy money. 
Did some surfing last night and found 4 Carnival and 2 Holland ships for sale.
Negative comments in here working overtime guess some are scared?
Isn't it interesting the stock sold off on high volume pre-market this morning and prior to the earnings announcement. However I'm sure this will never be investigated....
Why does yahoo say that there’s an earnings announcement today when they just announced earnings on 18th
"Cruise stocks rose Friday after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention replaced its nearly 8-month No-Sail Order with a less restrictive “Conditional Sailing Order.”The No-Sail Order expires on Saturday.Shares of the largest cruise company in the world, Carnival Corp., soared more than 11% on the news in afternoon trading Friday. Shares of Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line both traded more than 6% higher."
The shorts I don't think have the @Harry Bawls to short again tomorrow. They took a massive beating on a bad DOW day. Tomorrow the DOW may be up taking along CCL with it. To big of a gamble for them.
Quick quiz:1) How many shares do you think insiders sold this week?2) Which of the insiders you think sold the most shares this week?3) How many Carnival monopoly game boards do you think were sold so far?4) When do you think Carnival will raise money again?5) How much money do you think does Carnival burns each day/week/month/year?6) Can Carnival use the monopoly money to stay afloat when they won't be able to raise anymore money?
We will be sailing soon! 40's here we come!
$18 by Friday!
"3rd cruise booked tonight with the first in October 2021 and all came with the bonus of shareholder, military and cabin on board credits, totalling $2100 (now that beats my missing dividends this year). Not many cabins left on any of the cruise ships!! It’s obvious that there is massive demand....bookings for vacations are up over 600% in the UK. People just can’t wait to go on vacation that’s for sure."
"Separately, Israeli authorities on Saturday said the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 99% effective at preventing deaths from the virus."
"OK and please stop with this new hope that GameStop madness will take place here. For God's sake, do you even know why GameStop was a target? I told you this morning (pre-market) to sell this graveyard stock and go make some money with GME. Instead, you prefer to pray and hope."
out at $20. not loosing my profits here. Hope I can buy back in but I'm happy with over 100% gains. GL
Wow nice movement after hours
"Come people, I thought you were going to short CCL. Well. I guess you just really wanted to cover ! See ya at 30."
Get out safe while you can or you can hold for at least a year to bounce back to this level.
We haven’t even been told in Florida is allowed to open ports!!! Y’all are jumping in too quick I think.
Can't wait for the blood bath this week

"I would have been one of those poor people standing at the Long Beach Cruise Port right now if we hadn’t cancelled. Over........Talk about a nightmare. CCL just has no luck at all. 2,500 have just missed their flights home because ONE crew member MAY have the Coronavirus. You can’t cruise in this type of political environment. :-)"
stocks move on good news and bad news unfortunately as much as I like this stock the Democrats are going to keep the bad news out there as much as possible until after the election so I'm selling on the rips and buying on a dips from here on out
"Carnival is desperate for more money so that to pay off upcoming maturities of previous loans. They will then borrow more money at even higher interest rate to pay off these new loans. If they don't go belly up first, it will take them 15-20 years to pay off these loans. Keep buying, life is beautiful."

"Some of travel stocks have a lot to gain if they can survive. Within the cruise industry, Carnival (NYSE:CCL) comes to mind. As travel starts to open up again, shares trading over 70% lower than where they started 2020 could be in for a big bound higher."
"The worlds opening up. Record low Covid cases and everyone’s getting vaccinated. Cruises sold out for this summer, 2022 and half of 2023. Everyone’s waiting to go on vacation. Stand in the way and get..."

did anyone have the Guy burger + fries on a Carnival cruise ship? I love them burgers and fries! That is what makes me coming back to Carnival.
Monday will be green again. Be prepared.
rare gem under $30...
Canada said no ships to October 31th. And will keep extending if covid-19 is still around. See you back to $7.

Still not a bad day.....expect lots of cut and pastes from shorts!
"It’s going down today, and it will keep going in the next days..... fake green everyday...."
Time is ticking. With almost 2 billion in interest payments due over the next year plus maintenance and support costs their going to run thru their current 7 billion in cash pretty fast. Morgan Stanley’s reiterated price target of $10 looks about right
"By November, CCL will be running on all cylinders (including all their brands), making MUCHO DINERO for their investors!"
"This has been a good stock for short trading running between 24.85-30.60 will be down to 24.85 soon if someone has lot of money to play with buying, selling and buying, until there is news about COVID deaths and new infections this stock won't go past $30.60"
"I’ve been following this board since i bought in at 8 bucks a share. Here’s the reality.. This virus has been with us and circulating like wildfire.... since December of 2019. The only reason we are seeing a spike in cases is because we have more tests being conducted on a daily basis. Played golf the other day with a buddy who had Covid.. said it was like having the flu but he’s back to hitting 330 yard drives, he’s fully recovered. Sound like the end of the world? Right, because its not. Highly likely half the country has had Covid but didn’t know. In the end, it doesn’t matter with Chuck or anyone else has to say about cruising or what it will be like. If people are healthy, going on a cruise is just as risky as any other time (see above example of healthy individual hitting bombs again). I’m 44 and healthy. My chance of death is 4 in 1,000. Guess who all 4 people are in that segment? Guys my age with cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular issues etc. Healthy people are NOT dying at rate sufficient to close the economy again. Zero chance the government will KILL the cruising industry with one hand while also letting people run amuck with the other. Just a little common sense for the tweekers on this board. Cheers to all and enjoy a Casamigos with water and lime this weekend."
I bought this at 12:60 and it went down. I waited and now we are here

"J.P. Morgan analyst Brandt Montour said Royal Caribbean Chief Financial Officer “sounded upbeat” about progress in talks with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding the CDC’s latest no-sail order. In mid-July, the CDC extended its no-sail order to Sept. 30 from July 24, amid concerns over a new surge in COVID-19 cases.Read more: Cruise stocks fall as CDC extension of no-sail order could be just the beginning.In a presentation at J.P. Morgan’s gaming, lodging, restaurant and leisure management forum, Montour said Royal described its talks with the CDC as “incredibly constructive” and said the CDC was “highly responsive,” enough to make the company cautiously optimistic that the green light to start sailing could come sooner rather than later.“Regarding timeline, in the coming week the comments collection process will close, and then the CDC is expected to more formally evaluate protocols,” Montour wrote in a note to clients. “[Royal’s] current lay-up position should allow it to restart ‘relatively quickly’ but with moderately slow/measured capacity ramp from there.”"
This is a $60 stock. It will go back to this price by next year or sooner. Carnival has sold out till 2023. People can't wait for the boats to start sailing. It's a moneymaker. Now is the perfect time to take your position.
I think lots of people sold and made their profits today
Buy the dips.
"Buy more now, this the last that we are all going to see CCL trade at deep discount."
"Would you personally take you family on a cruise this summer, if you answer yes buy CCL, if not to risky to short and go buy some Tech stocks."
Not that I mind but why is this up 10% today? I dont really see any news except for the GILD this morning. 10% seems like a lot in one day based on the overall market and no news. Hope this isnt a bubble that pops next week.
Just need the announcement from Carnival that they will be buying 2 million tests from Abbot and this is off to the 30's.
It seems ccl is going back up.
I feel bad for who ever didn’t get out Ccl
Slow rise
sailing from US in July confirmed
CCL is certainly a .......BUY BUY BUY!!!
Let’s go CCL!!!!
"Can someone please tell me why I should not buy CCL and buy CUK instead, which is cheaper. Carnival is dual-listed but I find it confusing to understand why more investors are not buying CUK. I am in search of an answer to my question. Carnival in general is still a good buy, because consumers going on cruises is not going away. Thank you.SW"
Start shorting
"We are all Bill. We are a cabal who is ideologically bent on driving the price of CCL equity to the fair value of its future dividends. We buy dozens of puts at a time, and we are not effective."
"Typical cruise requires 85% to 90% occupancy just to break even. With COVID19 restrictions, cruise ships have to reduce occupancy rate so in no way they can break even let alone profitable. Granted, energy price is currently low so that helps. So I see continue nose bleed in 2021. Prove me wrong"
"No accommodations from Princess. No future credits, no rebooking for a later date. 100% penalty for cancellations. I think this is a mistake. I won’t cruise with CCL again. I’ll be looking for a class action to join. Princess’s screening process does not catch Coronavirus positive passengers who have no symptoms......IMO. :-)"
Very nice set up for shorts tomorrow about to get paid

"Just spoke with a higher up in investor relations. Carnival Corp has over 100 ships in it's brand fleets. Ships with exposure to China-- 4. And China isn't letting anyone travel. This is a buy opportunity to capitalize on sheer panic. Shorties will bring it down a little, but the fundamentals will only let them go so far. So, in essence, thank your local short seller. They're doing you a huge favor by risking their fortunes to discount this little gem for you :)"
Looks like I’m about to cash in on my 14 dollar call
"Shorts are going to have to start covering as a new SEC rule kicks in on Thursday where they cannot short on margin. The broker MUST have cash on hand to cover, which the broker will push to the investor. NO MORE MARGIN SHORTING!!!"
Double bottom? Sweet!
"I liked CCL a lot. But things are not the same as in January. The situation has changed. People are talking about CCL stock rebounding to pré corona levels when the pandamic is solved. The things those people don't seem to notice is that the fundamentals have changed. First CCL debts have almost doubled from 9.6b to 18.9b. Yes they also have more Cash on hand to pay the debts, but the conditions of the loans are terrible. Secondly the outstanding shares have also increased when the company issues new stock at $8.00. More shares outstanding means less value per share. Even if CCL returns to normal sailing conditions (we still don't know when that will be) the years it might take to return to normal profitably is to uncertain in my opinion to call this a stable investment. I think Carnival is a good company which did too many buybacks in the last years. the working capital was terrible even before 2020. I can no longer justify they price, so that's why I sold my shares today."
Will be under 20.00 in coming weeks.... on sidelines waiting....
Come on “PowerHour” take this baby to $42 or those UBS analysts are lost...
The blind optimist commands that his stock move higher.
"Buy and hold, this is a gold mine, these prices won’t last much longer, it’s on everyone’s radar, big investors buying this shares at this low price, it’s an opportunity of a lifetime."
Fortunately these cruise lines are so well loved they’ll make a fast comeback.

New 52 week low. Don’t see it going much lower than that.
GRWG just received 5 upgrades since earnings two days ago. It’s still undervalued today. It’s an easy double while interest rates remain low.

"Carnival should have regular cruises and have the passengers sign a waiver like at the Trump rally. Something like :""I understand that I might die during the trip. I hereby give permission to Carnival Cruise Lines to throw my body overboard. Carnival will not be liable for my death. In case I do not die I understand that I will have to pay for all expenses incurred by Carnival to get me off the ship. I give Carnival permission to put me in a raft and send me adrift if necessary. I also give Carnival permission to charge my credit card for the cost of the raft"""

"hey guys, I'm going to do something out there and extreme- some are going to call me stupid and thats fine I understand where you're coming from. I have been a long time holder of CCL 2500 shares since March got in around $9ish. I have made some money and cash out and did the whole AAPL & TSLA thing and cashed out earlier in the week with large profits. Now, I'm gong to take some serious money (for me) and buy around 6,000 shares of CCL. i still have around 3000 left over from previous purchase. I have researched for months and months looking through time lines and charts until i blue in the face. However, now is the time if there ever was a time for this stock IMO. I'm looking for short term 6 weeks. what I think or hope is going to happen. First, rapid testing. Second, no more delays for cruising. Thus, i'm looking for this stock to hit its last high resistance of $26ish area which was in June within that time frame (however, Id be happy at low 20's as well). My problem is that I make profit and then sell out of a gain. I have a problem with keeping it in there and riding it to new highs. Thus, I day trade this stock and make ok money but not letting it ride money. I need to stick with my original plan and if I've done that already id be quite richer already with CCL. Just wanted to tell my CCL peeps my story and my thoughts and maybe send positive energy my way thats all. I'll keep you posted if anyone is interested how it goes. thanks for reading my post."
Cruise lines will never go Bankrupt.... They have seen many pandemics... in past check the history...Just invest and forget the money for 6-12 months you will get good reward.NO PANIC and PATIENCE is the key. Ignore the paid scammers..I am in since $9 Long and Strong...Good Luck to you all
They will have no problem with filling their liners! Older people feel they may be gone tomorrow and they want to do something. Plus the liners should reassure them they have proper medicines on board if there is a issue!
"This is a good read if you’re considering on taking a position. Even though the company is leaning towards making it through, you need to understand the debt they issued and how It affects your current shares (dilution).https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/article/4337636-dont-be-fooled-carnival-will-crash-again"
"When comparing the yearly performance of all stocks, we notice that CCL is one of the better performing stocks in the market, outperforming 77% of all stocks. We also observe that the gains produced by CCL over the past year are nicely spread over this period."
"Sold $29 PUT today at $3.15, just a littlie over 100% return in 3 days. Financials matter, longs!kevin3 days agoReplied to a reaction$CCL conversationAlso riding the short train for tomorrow, bought $29 PUT at $1,55 few minutes before close today."
"It's time to add more shares, this will be a profit making stock come June 2021 buying it at this price."
"Shares of Carnival Corp. CCL, -11.17% turned lower in premarket trading Tuesday, after the cruise operator said it commenced a public offering of $1.25 billion worth of its common stock. Based on Monday's stock closing price of $12.80, the offering could represent about 97.66 million shares, or about 18.5% of the shares outstanding. The company also said it commenced private offerings of $3 billion shares of senior secured notes due 2023 and $1.75 billion in senior convertible notes due 2023. The stock fell 1.6%, after being up as much as 11% earlier in the premarket, and after plunging 28% over the past two sessions. Earlier, the company said it was suspending its dividend and share repurchases, cutting expenses and pursuing additional financing to improve liquidity. The stock has plummeted 61.8% over the past month through Monday, while the S&P 500 SPX, +3.35% has shed 11.1%."
I feel sorry for the people that didn't jump on the boat at $8 but its not too late
Just a little something for the bulls who took a beating. The futures were up after the market the last two days and by morning time they were way down both days. Now tonight they are down after the market and the Fed just did his little pep rally so by tomorrow the futures could rally overnight. If not you will have a good buying opportunity tomorrow for a nice trade.
Look at the one month chart...makes it own case. Short game over
"Can you imagine CCL once the CDC lifts the NSO, which will most likely be very SOON!"
"Dow is way RED, but CCL has made a huge reversal and is about to turn Green! Something is brewing, like the imminent lifting of the CSO by the CDC?"
What a close! I’m so glad I added more shares at $28.50 yesterday. Who is laughing now? I can’t wait to use my profits on a cruise in the near future 
When it's the best time to buy nobody's buying
A 5th grader could have seen this coming!
Good morning folks. Need advise selling my 1000 shares. Do I sell pre market or wait. Thank you.
Under estimate CCL did ya.....CCL = Strong Buy!!!$45 soon!!!

"Big day tomorrow. If they keep cruises shut down this thing could really drop. If they open, I expect a pop. Any thoughts?"
Don’t know why people are asking about Earning last date. They have no revenue and no earnings. Only another $5 billion loss to report. See you at $8 after they report and then 50 cents on bankruptcy announcement shortly after.
"Place a buy order at 22 till cancel and see CCL keep going up every day and when its at 40 you can tell us you were waiting for 22 to happen that never did happen. With a 10% correction were looking at 23+. I don't think 22 is going to happen, but I do know this stock long term is high 40's. One thing to think about is, The rest of the year might be tough for cruise line earnings and it wouldn't be surprising to see earnings sink if companies aren't able to raise prices, however a combination of lower fuel costs and higher prices or more travelers on cruises would be a boom to their businesses."
"Why any investor in their right mind would own this stock baffles me. I bought it early in the Pandemic at 12 and got out fortunately in June for $20. This stock is dead money, look at all the other companies you could of bought in 2020. 2021 and beyond are going to be very difficult for this industry. Get out when you can and put the money to work somewhere else."
"Every month or so, the cruise companies extend the sailing time further out, just far enough for the shareholders & customers to have that hope of returning to business. Just far enough to stay hooked on the cruise nectar. And while they are waiting, more shares are sold, to dilute the current shares even further. When they say ships are booked 100%, it means 100% of available vacancies at the reduced capacity, which the CDC & others will enforce. Lets see how that can be profitable while trying to pay back a debt that's more than what some countries owe. They will say they have adequate cash till the end of the year, but again, as occurred last month, they will sell more shares to feed the CA$H furnace..."
"Now is the time to buy, buy when others fear. This will go up, it’s all a matter of time, but there is no doubt about it."
Did they really say they are doing an offering to raise $1Billion ? wow

Never been ill on tons of cruises so i have faith the ships will be fine. Have a great ling weekend you americans and Canadians. See you all Tuesday. Dont forget futures are open for a while on monday. Shoukd show any goid/bad news over the weekend. Good luck."

Lol. You think society is going to reopen. If that were true then they wouldn't be making people where a mask after vaccination. And if it were true then the CDC wouldn't be telling Michigan to shutdown again.
Another bad day for shorts. Did it not go up even though it was way up? How many shorts covered to see it slide in the end. . Lol I been buying on 3-5 percent gains since March . Another great day Nd holding just 3500 shares. This stock will sky rocket and today’s taste up a buck pre market should put shorts on the edge as when she is announced 5-10 up day in minutes. What luck I could not believe as prices fell so I kept buying. Will see how we make out tomorrow
$60 in a year
updated CDC breaking news: fully vaxd passengers don't need to mask!
you guys got trapped hard today. been trading ccl for a loooooooong time. new investors they had a 1 billion dollar dilution @ $25.10. They also delayed more cruises which guarantees the 1 billion dollars will get burned through. They estimate 530 million cash burn a month. That 1 billion will be gone in more or less 2 months. No guarantee cruises will be open by summer. You new shareholders better get some diamond hands ready.
Carnival announced advanced booking. It is rocking the boat.

Waiting for this to drop to mid $13. again. Buy another 10K and wait for next Vaccine manufacturer (Moderna?) to announce their success story. CCL jumps up to high teens again........I dump the 10K shares again :)
my $banxa chart is ressembling more and more to my $ccl chart LOL
0.5 million after hours traded in ten minutes and big chunks! That's great news.
Light at end of tunnel!
All people 50 plus have been vaccinated now. The crazy dems can't continue their plans of covid lockup. They are already getting slammed with such negativity from poor decisions they know they have to change their crazy course. It's too late for them they are toast but it will open now.
Getting closer to the CDC dropping CSO......Cruising is very VERY near!

If it continues for two years or so, this stock is toast. Don't put all your eggs in one basket on this one but good for a gamble. I am considering buying more if it goes down a bit more, maybe in the sub $13 price range. Good luck to all."
Just... be patient...!
Carnival good news coming out
"The cruising industry and related businesses are huge in Florida, Alaska, main, Louisiana,Ny, California,Texas and so many coastal states,The hell with wallensky, who the hell is she to destroy so many hard working men and women,"
"Time to short again. On a day like this with markets skyrocketing, this stock can't even cross last week's high."
"Up .60+ cents in pre market on ANOTHER day with fully red exchanges. Like I said, $CCL is not going anywhere and the next GREEN day we have we will be really soaring"
"Once vaccine comes and cases fall, CCL will surge...adding on all dips below $14...will enjoy a nice cruise on my gains (at least I hope)"
"There is much to learn from the Diamond Princess and the Westerdam: 1) governments can imprison you on on a ship for as long as they want, and there is nothing you can do about it; 2) closing ports can force you to wander the seas for an indeterminate period of time, and there is nothing you can do about it; and most importantly, 3) SARS-CoV-2 appears ideally suited for the cruise ship environment. Despite efforts to keep the virus from spreading onboard, it ran thoroughly through the ship. You should not have any expectation that you would not get it on an affected ship, despite any precautions you may attempt. There is nothing you can do."
"According to CNBC and many others, their is going to be a correction in the stock market. Not sure exactly when it will happen. I think CCL will fall back to $15 and below, when it does happen. Currently CCL has been falling gradually from $23 and today it is having a difficult time trying to get to $20.20."
oh why did I short at 28.34 premarket.....

"To Pure Earnings Seller: I think that your posts are fantastic. They are a breath of fresh air on these boards. I used to be bullish on CCL when it was very low but I think that a bearish perspective is more warranted now. Regardless, I try to be as conservative as possible because this market is crazy. One of my biggest concerns is the impact of the Robinhood traders. They can create irrational moves on different stocks (duo,htz etc.). I think it is harder to create such a situation for a stock like CCL but not necessarily impossible. Are you concerned about that - from your writings about zero commission you must be with Robinhood too, so please understand that I meant no offense."
News outlets are good at reiterating old news to #$%$ people out of shares.

"In this morning: Carnival Plc To Cancel Planned Short Trips With AIDAperla, AIDAmar With Departure Dates Between Aug. 5 & 12.AIDA Cruises StatementROSTOCK, Germany, August 3, 2020 – The concepts and certifications for therestart of our cruise operation have been successfully developed and confirmedwith the responsible authorities. Contrary to our expectations, the finalformal approval for the start of the short trips from August 5, 2020 by ourflag state Italy is still pending.Unfortunately, we therefore have to cancel the planned short trips withAIDAperla and AIDAmar with departure dates between August 5 and 12, 2020.After intensive preparations with the support of many national andinternational authorities and health experts, we have developed comprehensiveconcepts for the restart and implemented all increased hygiene standards andmeasures to protect against COVID-19 on board our ships. We very much regret this delay. We would have loved to welcome our guests backon board from August 5, 2020.We assume that we will receive the last formal approval by the flag stateItaly in a timely manner.All guests whose trip cannot take place as originally scheduled will beinformed immediately.AIDA very much wants guests to enjoy their AIDA holidays at a later date. Tothis end, we offer our guests the opportunity to rebook to a different cruisefrom our wide range of travel offers. AIDA appreciates guests for theirconfidence by offering them an on-board credit of 50% of the actual travelprice.We will automatically reimburse the travel price already paid and all servicesalready booked on MyAIDA, according to the payment method made."
Princess has now offered 100% cruise credits for anyone who wishes to cancel. Good for them. They’re using their Noodle. :-)
SHORTS will now pull the SILVER from their teeth to cover....just buy already!!!
Shorts have maybe a couple bucks to play with on this stock. But longs have $40-$50 of upside. Long term where would you rather be.
They may simply take 3 CCL ships to Nassau and run them out of there for the summer until CDC can get their act together.

"Every single stock (~60) in my list is red today. But I have lots of cash to add to my existing holdings and will continue to drip any dividends in the stocks I hold. Worked in 2008, will do the same now."
last 2 days this is going up with heavy volume. tomorrow they have an earnings call. I know the stock is not good but if they will announce something optimistic this thing will move fast. thumps up for buying before closing thumps down for selling
"by the way, any Board Member including Mike Arison, did not sell any shares.Guys, thats loyality. That is optimism in its own company and trust in the fundamentals and the future.Company went to so many bad times...It aint hard to tell that the board members are behind their company, do whatever it takes to let the company staying alive and the shareholders happy!!"
"Turbulent uncertain times is the best time to make money. Regardless. When stock movements are less volatile, it is more difficult to predict their swings based upon emotion. We still have several weeks of this volatility in an extreme manner and it has NOTHING to do with CCL surviving 1 year from now or if passengers come back to the cruises quickly. Right now, the odds are in your favor of buying shares when the PPS hits a low cycle, and shorting when the stock hits a peak in the up cycle. Very simple to do."
Does anyone believe a recession is coming or are you guys blindly optimistic to that fact as well?
Short squeeze & FOMO will take it to 35 in no time. CCL is one of the best long plays on the market right now!
"Carnival Has Plenty of Liquidity to Last Until Cruising Begins3/8/2021 2:05pm ESTBy Mark R. Hake, CFACarnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL) raised $1 billion in net equity proceeds at $25.10, in its most recent capital raise on Feb. 24. This is the fourth time the company has skillfully raised equity, all at increasingly higher prices of CCL stock. I believe that the company now has enough liquidity to last until its cruising operations begin in the summer."
Simple day/swing trader profit taking today! Low volume! Healthy consolidation before the blast off!
"""It a surprise that Carnival just suspended cruises further as there has been some recent hope that cruising could resume"". Minister for Trade, Tourism, and Investment Dan Tehan told Australia’s 9Now Today Show.This is a HUGE red flag! It seems that Carnival suspended cruises further for no reason. Unless the Minister for Trade, Tourism, and Investment Dan Tehan is not informed of the fact that there will be no sailing this year? That instead of sailing they are selling you hopes? Hopes are free and people love it."
"Bought at $29, glad to see it finally turning around. Holding until Christmas."
Bookings through the roof! You will hear for yourself on Thursday.
"Keep in mind that CCL operates internationally, it doesn't matter that they are banned in one country, and a few months doesn't matter as well, you need to get a little perspective and be patient. CCL will go up for sure, every company is getting stronger during crisis."
Excited for tomorrow morning! Cruising is back 
Can someone help me out. How long is CDC going to restrict sailing again and how much cash burn does carnival have a month? Also do you know if the bulk of the cruises happen during the summer and if it dies off thereafter? Thanks for your help.
"Earnings beat, but flat guidance going forward. I read the quarterly report and noted that CCL hasbought back 3% of the outstanding shares in the past year. Buying back shares is an excellent use of excess free cash flow. The dividend is coming in like clockwork, and aging demographicswill be working in CCL'S favor. Divvy_sniffer"
And BOOM WE ARE BACK!Mid-summer resumptionThe agency said it is committed to working with the cruise industry and port partners to resume cruising following the conditional sailing order's phased approach.
Been loading up every week all the way down from $27. Almost at my avg price now. Not selling for long time
"The fear and desperation from longs that bought CCL at a pre-covid price and can't get their money back, shows up here well."
"Very smart of mgmt to be blunt and honest with the reality of recovery from Covid. This is true for all travel and entertainment sectors. Now that we we got the negative news out of of way......if you look at airlines, Movies Studios and restaurants, their stocks are hitting fresh 52 week highs. Cruise stocks is no different. we will see $40s before Summer season begins!"
"Dec 20th 2019, Dec 20th 2018, Dec 19th 2017, Dec 20th 2016.... These are the days CCL reported Q4 earnings. Why the delay this quarter? It’s not like they are busy."
"Carnival, the world’s largest cruise ship operator, is expected to report a loss for the third consecutive time in the fourth quarter. The Miami, Florida-based company’s revenue will plunge nearly 100% to $142.09 million from $4.78 billion posted in the same period a year ago. Carnival is expected to report a loss of $1.84 per share, worse compared to a profit of 62 cents per share registered in the same quarter last year."
Does everyone realize that their is a break even point to business and if a restaurant or cruise is only doing so many tables or room bookings than is better to close restaurant or cancel cruise . WE ARE AT THAT POINT ... where cruise trips are being cancelled to save additional costs...The cruise industry is going to crumble for 2020.

This is awesome news!!!!!
"Carnival doesn't pay US taxes. 18 of the ships fly the Panama flag, six that of the Bahamas and two that of Malta. Profits from those ships are tax exempt. So... no bailout for CCL."
Cruise lines are starting to switch ports to other areas. Example you will fly to Bahamas and just sail out of there. Looks like they are not going to let the United States CDC tell them what to do. We will be back to full sailing soon you may just have to fly a little farther. https://thepointsguy.com/news/royal-caribbean-unveils-yet-another-first-ever-home-port-as-it-ramps-up-comeback-plans/

"I must say, all joking aside, I am tempted to book a cruise. Norwegian has a fantastic all inclusive plan right now, I was looking at a 7 day cruise that starts in Puerto Rico and hits Aruba, Bonaire, St. Lucia and St. Kitts. Not your everyday itinerary. Seems cheap at $2200 including all fees and gratuities for two, balcony cabin, open bar, specialty dining and a $50 discount on excursions. Kids free too, but that isn't for me. Normally the drink package alone would cost $1400...However, I have been watching YouTube videos of the Norwegian Epic and it looks ok at best, but really can't hold a candle to the Royal Caribbean Oasis class, let alone the newer Quantum class ships. Decisions..."
"Carnival starting before we thought. June 1. Could be sooner. Carnival Cruise Line pushed it restart from May to June, but could now have 16 ships sailing in June"
"Nice to see from some posts that @dumb and @dumber are still around and totally getting it all wrong.

Bought at 19 in February. So glad so many people follow the pump. Lol I was worried buying in at that price. Sold at 29. If your still invested your about to be stuck in a long hold. Definitely dropping to the low 20’s. If not back to the teens

"@Wolf of Wall Street. Yup. Last November it was cruising is back in a month or two. Came December, again the same story of cruising will be back in a month or two. Same thing in January and now the same in February. Next month you will tell me that cruising will back in a month or two.....Forget about cruising coming back this year, won't happen. Still many months before enough people get vaccinated and then 4-5 months to collect data and make sure pandemic is under control. Any new mutation/variant and back to square one."
SHORTS having a conversation...CCL = STRONG BUY!
"Somebody can check my math, but, I believe there are 200,000,000 (200Million) new shares available to be sold as of the opening bell this morning. Convertible just vested. Two billion dollar investment gave investors the right to buy 100 shares for every $1000.00 invested.They are now selling those shares at a six to seven dollar profit per share. The float is effectively 25% greater than it was yesterday. Those new shares will flood the market over the next few weeks."

"CCL is holding up much better than its competitors, NCLH is down over 6%! We are near the bottom of the range, CCL will do its usual 5-6% up per day until we are easily are over $30! Other pensions like Ohio's, are going to be heavily buying at these bargain prices! Once there is actual clarity about the restart (not CDC's shell game), CCL is going to rocket higher, which will be late May or for sure June! No matter what, the Pandemic will be over this summer and the CDC' CSO will be lifted as a result! I think CCL believes their is a excellent chance that the JUDGE will rule in their favor, they wouldn't have moved the ships to Galveston otherwise!"
Yep... we’re cruising now!!!Buy now before it hits $58 this summer!Still time to load up on CASH!!!!!
The Corona Virus is predicted to devastate the Airline and Cruise Industries It was estimated this week that the airlines alone could lose up to 115 Billion.

Top Bullish Charts for October 2020: Week 4  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"Bears... Carnival not going to go bankrupt just stop... IE Boeing.. They can raise more capital in the debt markets.. They have more than enough assets in case of bankruptcy to cover for the debt.. They also have enough cash liquidity to cover until next year. If you believe their will be a cure and coronavirus is overblown then you invest. I'm on that camp and the numbers for mortality rate is dropping EVERYDAY and thats why I believe so. News saying words like cases have ""spiked"" ""surged"" is all semantics. That doesn't mean what you bears have to say doesn't have merit. It also depends on how fast people get over their fear of the virus but you can't convince the masses that quickly."
This debt for equity could be very successful. The fact that these institutions are buying CCL debt in exchange for the future value of this stock? Good.

"This is a solid buy even at this PPS. Cruse lines are going nowhere, and as soon as COVID19 is dealt with they will be sailing again. 75 percent off for long term investing? Don't mind if I do.I bought 100 shares at 8.00, 50 shares at 12.00, and looking to add more in the future."
My prediction came true! For the last 3 months I was predicting every day that it will rain the next day. What do you know....It rained today. I'm so good at predicting. I told you it will rain. Go to sleep Uziel.

"Almost no downside from here. In the worst case scenario it will trade sideways in the 28-30s for a month, and than head higher. Buy now at 29.50 or buy later at 35, 40, 45, 50. The choice is yours"
@keith Biggest dog I have at the moment is APPL Go figure.
Fasten your seatbelts. We're green! Back to 29 in five days
Bounce on 4% with a 33 price point by JP Morgan today. 
"Had the drop ,,,, now the pop"
Good business. Cruisers aren’t afraid of anything. Great value vacation for post coronavirus consumers.
"It's just a matter of time before CCL prices go back to the glory days. The question is when? Since we don't know that answer, do you buy now or wait to buy after it goes up? Easy decision for me, that's why I bought a month ago. Patience will prevail."
"For all the posters who say people won't feel safe sailing on a cruise ship, I couldn't disagree with you more!! I teach 6th grade and I feel very safe in the school. When people are following the rules, it is safe! I have to believe that when people get on the boat they will all get tested and at that point, the boat is the safest place on Earth to be!!!! I would gladly to a week long cruise with all the days being out to sea!!!! Those are the best days anyway...imo!"
next stop 20 or lower lol
"European countries are about to lift their lockdowns, good sign for future."
"It isn't about which company is stronger or better or worse. Both companies are doing fine for now. It's about doing your homework about a company you are invested in and buying low and selling higher. If you no NCL and make a good profit during a curtain up swing window that great, keep going. I will do the same with CCL. Both people win."
"When all is said and done Carnival Corp. will still be making millions upon millions, pay a great dividend, buyback shares and grow. I’m buying. Carnival Corp. is on sale so load up the.. boat!"
Charts:- cup and handle forming on the 4hr volume indicator. If breaks out this should run to $16.Happened not long back and ran from $12 to $18.50 on not as strong of an indicator. Good luck.
it's rising faster than @christopher can delete his poor predictions!
Longs are having a blast seeing their stock sinking. Go figure.
"it's a different Christopher, guys. need to click on their profile, not the same lol"
Looks like the payroll report may do us in. Shorts will tell you it's because of CCL going bankrupt and we will never sail. Do your own due dilligence.
countries around the world are starting to shutdown again due to corona virus cases increasing.
Whole market is red and CCL is green. What’s your next price prediction Christopher? Just asking so I know to expect the polar opposite
Only 73 mil shares traded. Certainly not the panic we’ve seen previously.

"Don’t pay attention to the noise around this stock, time makes wealth not timing, just hold for the long term and you will be rewarded. This could reach $50-$60 easy by end of Q1 2022. Booking for next fall is filling up like crazy. And this company has enough cash to survive 0 operation until 2023."
"Someone keeps dumping 300k shares... don't believe me, just look at the 15minute. 300k dumps, like clockwork."
"Another added cost to the bill! Medical additions and safety upgrades. This poor company can not get a break. 42M unemployed Americans, Restricted ports all over the world, Possible half capacity restrictions cutting profits in half for 2021 and possibly 2022 even with high bookings, they are on already discounted fares. Added a ton of debt to cover a huge timeframe with ZERO, $0 a day income, while adding this debt obligations / Debts to pay in 2021, with a new forcast of half capacity ships, running discounted fares, to take the people that DO have jobs, to the few ports that are not restricted, all while on their new heavily costing medical ships. This is insane now. The fundamentals have this as a $13 AT BEST stock. $CCL and $RCL will have the same issues. It's going to pull back so hard in the next few weeks, watch."
"People are still playing this as a ""survive/bankrupt"" play. After you get past ""survive"" and say thats gonna happen, you need to weigh the industry. Does the industry say that IF this survives, its worth $12 against expected business?"

"I’d love to go on a cruise and I would gladly overpay. However, I’m not going unless there’s no mask or vaccine requirement."
"Unbelievable, that Yahoo ist not able to prevent all the shortie spam in all forums here. Further to send ""look like spam"" seems to interest nobody @yahoo and also muting seems not to work (I'm sure I have muted some users multiple times and their comments are showed like evergreens every day)!"

Thank goodness my order from Thursday were partially filled so I got only 100 shares. Now I got a chance to get in lower and I think the selling was overdone. CCL should recover some.

"Don’t feel discouraged, this stock will not go lower than $8. And this stocks I’ll be up in 3 months time once the corona virus pandemic subsides. Don’t panic, if you anxious don’t look, and if you can’t handle it then don’t invest, this is all part of a crisis, but rest assure this stock is a strong buy and hold at this price."
When we all meet up on that first cruise we'll talk about your financials and how I may be of some help to you.

Just got a call from 6 of my Filipino siblings and they are heading back to Florida tomorrow. They were crying they are so happy!
"i'm sure you guys are aware now that cruise lines are going to lose another summer of cruising. it's going to become harder for carnival to borrow money soon if treasury yields rise and guess where they are going to look for money once 7-8 months pass by for them to stay afloat and you guys maybe sheepishly bought more carnival stock because you guys are thinking ""recovery"". they will do another offering to stay afloat and you guys put your hard earned money into carnivals atm machine for them to withdraw your cash and then you have the uncertainty of how people will enjoy the new cruise experience."
"PUTS are looking good, not sure what your fuzz is all about.I actually got a few more this morning. This is madness with those stimulus checks..Good Luck!"
Too many people day trading CCL
and I guarantee you.. This is going to get REAL low now but people are going to test this drop because they think bargain sale. it's not.
or even worse @issay AKA @Harry Bawls AKA @NatureBoy and Dominique. That would make headlines!
"Literally the worst place in the world you could be during a quarantine is in a confined space stuck at sea. Yet leave it to Americans to rely on historic price levels to make prediction on future. Now that vaccines are out it all comes down to actual valuation, not speculation."

"Shorts still haven't covered...ost likely they doubled down...that's good news hers why.Fact: A vaccine has been achieved. It may not be available yet but IT IS COMING.This company is in no danger of bankruptcy and the only way to make money is to get in EARLY.Unlike a speculative start-up, we KNOW what this company makes in good times which now are insight.We know because this IS NOT a speculative start-up but a PROVEN company.Soooo...it make take a while but this IS going back to its old highs sooner or later which makes it a SURE THING if you have the time to wait,Might not hit $60 for a while but the idea that this isn't $30 near term is LUNACY."
"How can you stubborn shorts understand that price won't go under $20 anymore with vaccines ???? It doesn't matter anymore when they sail again, any window under $20 is a buy opportunity that I never miss with complete confidence."
Buying 100 share blocks in premarket. Maybe 2K shares in all.
"Short sellers haven’t learned anything from GameStop. May they Rest In Peace, the poor things will go bust."
SELL NOW! Nothing wrong with taking some profits. Buy it again when it drops below 20. You know I am right.
Strangest market reaction i have ever seen to dilution at a time like this..

It was just on the local news here in Dallas that CCL will be sailing out of Galveston on July 3rd.
"Right now, every single flight and cruise represent the potential back breaker for these companies. A single outbreak that results in a mandatory quarantine, and the entire industry goes on lock down again. The only questions now are do they have enough liquidity to last until COVID-19 is done and, if not, how much more will they have to dilute shareholders through stock offerings to have sufficient liquidity?Anyone that is looking at these companies thinking that they represent ""good value"" because the share prices are somewhat historically low is not fully digesting the entire situation. Look at all the additional, high-interest, debt the companies have taken on to survive. Look at the amount of dilution has occurred. Look at how much their margins will drop due to lower occupancies on each cruise. Look at the risk of exposure lawsuits. When all of this is factored in, the prior share prices are pretty much pie-in-the-sky dream prices that will likely never be attained again. Have fun Robinhood gamblers...this will be a good initiation into the realities and importance of fundamentals and valuations!$CCL $NCLH $RCL"
@brr If you read posts a while back from brr he was long and positive. Somewhere along the way he became rogue and went short. Obviously losing his #$%$ along the way.
Don’t look now but CCL is going green!CCL = $$$
"Pfizer is producing 2B vaccines in 2021. Do the math.65 years old and up no question asked.CCL to be $40 by year end,Load up the boat"
"Carnival: -7.45%Norwegian: -13.5%Royal Car.: -16.22%American airline: -7.2%obviously despite shorties trash talk here, great perormance from ccl"
The vaccine news is already more than priced into the share price. Everyone knows the vaccine will eventually be released. It's not like a positive surprise that no one knows about. It will be a sell on news story. Reality will set in that it will take years to fully recover. The current share price is overvalued based on fundamentals and is trading at higher than analysts 12 month consensus target price. Domestic air travel is not expected to recover until 2023 and international air travel in 2024. Cruise companies could take as long or longer to recover.
This is when I bought in before and I became a bagholder and then bought in again on the next dip and then another and then I became the master of bagcoins
A 20% dividend is hard to pass up if they pay. Buyer at 7.50.
Wow this kid Christopher was so right looks like 25 in coming
"All the memes are great if that's your thing .... However, the truth is if u watched the bid ask all day as I did. We got crushed. The only way this goes up is with the CDC giving the ok for ""test"" cruises. Trust me I want this to roll higher. Bit til then we'll see a roller coaster."
It’s rejecting 27.81 but we will make another run at it. Come on.
"pray the markets to open red, the smart money is waiting to get back in."
"Good afternoon CCL Investors,In my opinion it would be expected that tomorrow there would be profit taking after a nice day run. (if today remains)However, for many new people on this board who may not be too familiar with all the people, I would like to make you aware what may happen on this board. If the profit taking occurs, you will find @Bill AKA @Harry Bawls and one or two others come back out from the depths and use the down day (If it happens) to bad mouth CCL again and again and post negative partial information from cut and paste articles or their own spewing of misinformation.Again, I encourage everyone to use their own best judgement and do your own due diligence and not let these people influence your investment thinking in any way. Just ""MUTE"" them if you feel it is justified."
"look at recent posts from James and Ryan, shorting every dip! If you want to be a trader wait until a big pump to short, not sell the bottom after stock has dropped 10% in the last day and is down 80% from ATH!"

CCL PR has issued a statement confirming the material impact if the Corona virus on the company's profitability and slashing the year's EPS by wapping 65 cent.The writing is on the wall and you must be blind if you don't see it. Today I sold my entire position of CCL at a loss to avoid upcoming catastrophic outcome..Adios CCL. Will be back in at around $35 a share and hopefully less.
Seriously everybody tests before sailing so simple .... is this a political issue .
"backed up the truck at 25.50, by september this will be 45"
"The 3 major cruise line CEOs should get together and talk about what’s best for the entire industry. Just an idea. I think a 3 month shut down might actually be the best avenue. Take the hit, scrub down their ships, and come back stronger than ever. The headline risk the entire industry will be facing over the next couple of months will be enormous.......as more and more ships get turned away from wherever they happen to be going. :-)"
Shorts have to have their day of fun every once in awhile. It’s funny that they are being really quiet today!
CCL is certainly STAYING ALIVE!!!CCL = Strong BUY!
"Sold all my CCL a few days back at 50.75, bought back at $44.00. Love trading this stock!"
Make no mistake about it. The PANDEMIC has become politicized. The mainstream media will do everything it can to spread gloom and doom/second wave fears because they believe it will help win the election.The truth is this economy is going to bounce back at lightning speed leaving cautious investors behind and short homeless.

"The United States will achieve herd immunity in its fight against COVID-19 by April, much sooner than most health officials want to admit, Dr. Marty Makary, a Johns Hopkins University health policy expert and surgeon, argues in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal and in an interview Friday.According to @bill's way of thinking. IT'S OVER!!!!"
"I told you guys before that CCL's party is over! The good & bad new have already been factored in. While you waste your time & money watching the price hover within the same range for months, you are missing out on so many good stocks that have been appreciating during that time. Eventually, the $30 BILLION debt will have to be paid back, plus interest, with a smile, either by diluting more shares or killing their EPS for years."
"after you have vaccin shot it does not mean you are 100% protect from virus. if one pasenger have covid then the whole ship is in trouble then stock price will drop hard , you better think twice if you buy cruise stock. good luck you all"
You know when people without any medical background are blindly optimistic when they think they know more than a professional medical doctor with over 30 years of experience. lol
"People believe the world will just go back to normal. It won't. People are going to for the first time begin to live like they've never lived before. Just got back from Hawaii, and it was packed. Went to a bar small jazz bar/restaurant last night. It was packed -- people were dancing again! -- DANCING. I believe cruises are going to experience a herd of bookings similar to baby births after the war. You want to own CCL."
Why so many negative bears
just come back in a month or two. it'll be below 20. no cruises happening this summer. people confused because yahoo finance app popped a bunch of alerts and stimmys game in the bank account. euphoria will be gone very quick
"I would be willing to scoop up some shares if CCL drops below $5. I'm keeping CCL and AAL (American Airlines) on my watchlist. At some point, these transportation and cruise stocks will be too cheap to ignore. A fire sale will be happening soon!"
"When the company starts to make $$$ again they will issue buy back shares so if you shorts, you should remember this. May 9, 2020 - Carnival Cruise Bookings Surge 600% After Announcing August Relaunch"
"I am long, but entry points are important to me. I’m looking to reenter at 14.77 today for a small bite, but we have to fill that gap and will load heavy at 13.25ish. Likely early next week. Be patient. Entry points important. Then hold thru the first sailing minimum. Next two months should be very profitable. Good luck!"
Open ended: I see only two things that could happen. Either this pops and any buy under $15 will be handsomely rewarded or it goes bk and you lose everything. It’s going back to 30-50 or 0. Hmmmm
You guys think CCL will be down next week ?

"So many think that once CCL's ships start cruising again the debt that has been accumulated for the past 18 months will miraculously dissappear. The reality is CCL's stock price will at best be hovering in the $20s for years to come. I no longer believe CCL is likely to go CH. 11, but only a fool thinks it's the same company as pre-pandemic."

What Warren Buffett said about airlines is even more relevant to cruise lines because planes are much more important to a modern economy than cruise ships.

"Two German cruise lines, that were intended to be prototypes for the reopening of U.S. based Carnival Corporation and its rival Royal Caribbean Cruises, have encountered controversy. Sources have reported that crew members employed by both AIDA Cruises and Mein Schiff, operated by TUI Cruises, tested positive for COVID-19 upon reporting for duty.Another major German cruise line, Mein Schiff, was intending to sail one of its ships, the Mein Schiff 1, on a cruise from Germany on July 31, but suspended the cruise last week. This was supposed to be one of the test cruises for Royal Caribbean which has a 50:50 joint venture with TUI of Germany which manages the Mein Schiff ships.Mein Schiff claimed that it cancelled the cruise because it was unable to fill a re-start team in time for the cruise. However, according to Mein Schiff crew members who we communicated with, the real reason for the cancellation was that seven crew members reportedly tested positive for COVID-19.https://www.cruiselawnews.com/2020/07/articles/uncategorized/without-covid-19-testing-new-protocols-for-german-cruise-lines-are-doomed-to-fail/"
"After some debate, I decided to sell my entire holding of CCL @ $20.10 for a 34% profit. with all this extra debt and still no actual sign of the fleet getting back to work, I think they'll be feeling the side effects of this shutdown longer than I would like. Hopefully, for the longs, they don't dilute the shares too much can get back to normal operations soon. But, I'm predicting no significant gains in the next few months at least. Good luck everyone"
"US cruises could start mid July with 95% vaccinated passengers, says CDC. Bye bye shorts. "
"This stock was over $50 before coronavirus in the greatest economy the world has ever saw before. If they don't sail for a full year they will have spent 7.2 BILLION dollars over a year. Have taken out massive debt loads. And most importantly, have no where near the same economy they had before corona. All while taking in 0 revs. Yeah tell me again how this is worth MORE than it was BEFORE corona. If you have that very very basic thought process, and still think this is going to $60, you deserve whats coming"
"This stock made me wait 7 months last year and I saw at a point in time -65k P&L..luckily I got my neck out. Yet, I have done a lot of homework back then to study this baby! anyone who is expecting a price over 35 is dreaming hard! Pandemic had an immense impact on the financials. Debts are historically high, fleet is downsized (not even talking about early retired ships) and pre pandemic balance sheet in the best scenario can be reached not before 2025. So my friends, considering the growing concerns on the virus and its mutations as well, I would stay away from CCL unless it hits 20-."
look at her daily chart ... talk about double bottom forming? if she gets back up this will be picture-perfect double bottom..salute
Where is Cramer? He was pumping this stock relentlessly when it was at all time highs a couple of years ago. The cruise ship industry was the best ever according to him!
"Cruising optimism very good, but really looking great for early spring going forward. CCL stock is ready to show continued nice and steady upward climb. WEEEERRRR back!! jg"

New security checks will apply cruises when they resumes their voyages
FDA Panel has already endorsed the J & J Vaccine. Done deal today.
"I'd say that if DeSantis hasn't sued the CDC by the middle of next week (since the Cruise Lines need 90 Days to prep, they need a green light NOW), there must be some major progress towards the NSO being lifted soon!"
So what will be the reaction to postponing cruises even more?What if cruises postponed until next year?
"The buyers today are linking the vaccine -> current price->a year ago price and think that CCL will push the button and share price will be the same.Look the new debt, burn rate during last 8 months and the dilution.forget the range of $40-50 share price."

"1.. the book value of CCL is 38usd2. the market cap of CCL is 8.38billion now 3. how much money does Saudi Funds have? 320bilion4.what is the main cost of CCL? fuel. what does Saudi have ? 5. how long do you think the pandemic will stay?you are quarantined now, you could not sail , if a boat which normally sells at 38k, now sells at 12k, and you have spendable money in your account? will you buy or not ? if you will buy , why wouldnot Saudi funds?Bankruptcy, how could that be possible ? Saudi funds could but out the company, what a good chance to own this no. 1 cruise company at such a price"
"Cristopher, wrong yet again. What happened to the $23 price floor you know the one that you said after it had a healthy pull back? Nice."
"What a month!!! 40% increase with apparently nothing but bad news. Expecting at least 40% in march as further ""bad news"" comes out. Charts still super bullish even in a down market. Congrats longs, have a great weekend with the J&J news and possibly CDC movement. Dont forget more vaccinations and closer to sailing. "
The Center for Destroying Cruises (CDC) are POWER Hungry leftist Bureaucrats that are trying to milk this scamdemic for all it's worth! CCL better move their ships to friendlier waters!
"Institutions will try to scare people into selling so they can buy cheaper, it’s a classic game."
"Still more problems ahead but I'd like hear your thoughts on these:- Downgrades? Will we see some later today and tomorrow? Stock to go down another 5% on those?- The ""Healthy Sail"" panel consists of 6 doctors and only 3 cruise ship executives. Yikes. Given that basic fact I don't think they will vote in favor reopening cruises soon. In particular, the ongoing 40k new cases per day in the US is a problem and those doctors will naturally need to be conservative. They must protect their jobs/careers. Giving a ""yes"" vote, and possibly being wrong by Dec/Jan, could be a career ending mistake. - After the Nov election, if Democrats win, those same 6 doctors (and the CDC mind you) will still vote ""no"" to protect their positions/careers until the new administration comes. In essence, CCL shareholders need a Trump win to get these cruise ships going again. - The real kicker: There is always crowding on elevators in cruise ships, and certainly crowds at the elevator lobby areas if they only allow 1-2 elevator passengers at a time, so it can't work. It's a physically impossible distancing problem there. They simply can't get the necessary protocol of social distancing there. - Once all the other protocols are in place the cruises won't even be desired (no shows to avoid crowds, no bar crowds, no gambling crowds, no packed pool areas, only very limited people in restaurants, etc.) The whole point of a cruise, or at least most of it, is the social activity ....so it simply doesn't work."
Why CCL good news stock down today
ccl is recalling employees regardless. cruise will resume on june with or without us ports. that simple
"I live in a state that had one of the big recent covid waves. The infection rate, deaths, and hospitalizations are dropping like a rock and that is before the vaccine is making a difference. I believe the last chance to catch the pop to $35 is right now."

"I'm amazed how many people on here think this no sail decision will be made by the CDC based on covid figures.Trust me , this is a political decision. Pence already overuled Redfield once as he wanted to extend until Feb.Trump / Pence will be looking at early voting numbers right now, lots of Latino's work in the cruise industry, and he might see that as an opportunity for more votes.

"because I keep seeing the same posts about protocols. Here is off the CCL Website and is the first cruise COSTA to resume. here are a few new protocols for the whole story go there and read. ""For the last few weeks, we’ve been working together with the authorities on implementation of the new health procedures that will allow our guests to make the most of their cruise experience while ensuring maximum safety. Meanwhile, we're continuously monitoring the situation with a view to gradually reintroducing cruising on more ships from October, with itineraries extended also to include guests from our other European markets.""The ship has set sail under a strict new set of health and safety guidelines, in accordance with the procedures set out in the Costa Safety Protocol, a document developed by the company together with a panel of scientific experts, containing new operational measures in response to the COVID-19 situation.These include staggered taggered entrance times; online check-in and at the terminal -- a temperature scan, health questionnaire and antigen rapid swab test.Passengers will not be cleared for boarding unless and until they have tested negative, and or any suspected case of COVID-19 it will be possible to perform an additional test with a molecular swab test.Prior to embarking, crew members have also been tested with molecular swab at intervals and been quarantined for 14 days. In addition, each member of crew will have a monthly swab test.Onboard, passengers can expect the following enhanced health protocols:Social distancing signageRepeat performances of the live shows for smaller audiences;a switch from buffet restaurants to seated dining in the restaurants;the seating capacity in theaters, show lounges, bars and restaurants has been revised respect minimum distance;"
Carnival is down 6.14% to 26.22
Can we buy stock in Bureau Veritas ? They just were contracted tonight to get CCL fleet ready to sail
Glad I took profits last week.. WB is out from airlines this can’t be positive for ccl imo.
If you’re thinking about buying more better do it today as tomorrow they pass the stimulus and this won’t be below $30 again
We will regret for not buying ccl at this price when a vaccine is approved next month.

Why can people cram into planes but not cruise! This makes no sense ... cdc needs to start letting people cruise.
Im still laughing about the people who went into society reopening stocks. India will get worse and it will spread locking down the world again. See because power corrupts and absolute power has corrupted absolutely.
"Here’s some food for thought. When German cruises begin, they are essentially test runs that can be reviewed by the CDC for their effectiveness. If multiple cruises occur with little to no transmission, the CDC may approve their guidelines set forth on the German cruises."

Reduced to nothing but salvage scrap.............sell on spot market
"Good morning CCL Investors,While reading this message board you will notice that there are a few people that are short position players. They may even have other aliases and will post using them all. Although everyone is entitled to their own opinions, these specific people will do anything in their power to provide this board with only negative information about CCL. They will talk about imminent bankruptcy, bloodbaths, never again to sail and quite a bit of other negative information. Some will post cut and paste articles all day long and not post complete articles and only post sections that are negative in those articles. In addition, those articles are never dated, and many are old and repeated articles. Other bashers will flip flop occasionally to make you think they are on your side and then switch positions and they always turn rude when they have taken a short position.You will also find that on days CCL is green they are usually nowhere to be found but on negative days they will come out in full force with their garbage and taunting posts.Unfortunately, they have driven away many real investors away from this board that were helpful and provided real information and knowledge.I urge you to not take their information as fact. Do your own due diligence and make your own decisions. Please feel free mute them to keep the integrity of this board intact in you find them to be too much."

"I don't think anyone believes the cruise line industry will disappear; however, when you look at other opportunities on the market that won't be held back waiting for a vaccine you come to realize companies like CCL will continue to trend down. Antibody testing isn't the answer for the cruise lines. Wait until they release Q2 and 3. Debt is a problem."

Obviously could be shorter on news.On the downside it could go to $22 support there. $18 has huge support. (both great times to add to positions)That's how I see it today...
Can you just imagine the push we will get when the CDC says something positive about cruising and then again when they allow it?
"On top of the millions that already lost their jobs, more people in the retail, restaurants, entertainment, hospitality & small businesses will be losing their jobs after Christmas, which will have a ripple effect on other businesses.

I love this rotation out of tech stocks that has been fighting inflation in dinosaurs. These are all companies its with massive overhead that were killed during the pandemic. People think everyone is going to rush on vacations and cruises after there wallets and businesses have been beaten down I think you will have short spike then it will be less traffic then before. These giant have been suffering heavy losses unless they find a way to increase revenue most of that capital will be used to pay off interest on debt. These recovery stocks will use you guys like a money mart to pay off loans.
How much of a pop are we looking at today?
Postponing cruising to June... Than August.. Than November than December.. Until no more cruise industry shutting down good luck holding the company debt while manipulator take all ya gains
"For those of you that would like the entire article not just the one paragraph the lady @Issay posts as she only posts the negative part. Here is the whole article. J.P. Morgan has lowered its price target for Carnival Corporation stock to $23 from $25, while maintaining a neutral rating.""We’re lowering our (2021) estimates to capture the latest updates to ongoing global cruising suspensions,"" the bank said, in a note to investors.""There’s been no official guidance out of the CDC since the conditional sailing order was put in place on October 30th, 2020, and as of now it’s unlikely revenue-sailings can start in the U.S. before June.""The note said that the bank expected the Alaska season to be ""largely cancelled"" following Canada's cruise ban.""As for a silver lining, this ban should further build on what is likely already substantial pent-up cruise demand for ’22. Cruise stocks were unfazed by the announcement, which to us, supports the view that the market is continuing to look through to 2022 fundamentals, focusing on demand longer-term and broader virus/vaccination data nearer-term."""
Shorts if you bet against CCL or any travel today I feel for you. If the MRNA news is correct it may never again see under $13.80 for a very long time. Bulls we may see $19 today if it can break $14.30 today
"""Blind optimism leads to failure"" Warren Buffett"
People are going nuts to go on vacation and cruising is their TOP CHOICE! CCL = $$$$$Easy $52 by year end! BUY BUY BUY!!!
Wow! And April was supposed to be the redemption month? Where is all the sailing optimism?
Dang I’m glad my name isn’t Christopher lol definitely a good stock to own!!!!!
Barclays doesn’t give signals for day traders. So... just buy would be my advice.
"Cruise ships will need special protocalls. And as much as 1/3 of people not getting vaccinated so there goes that pool of customers. Also, Canadians are like 10% of customers and they have strict travel restrictions likely to at least for few more months (Canadian land border remains closed except commercial traffic and returning Canadians). You are always gonna get Covid incidences amonsgt a ship of thousands so protocalls always needed. not sure they will allow buffets - unlikely. They will still need emergency services (that means space lost, and more costs). Cruise stocks bad risk-reward."
"Well....i am thinking that whenever Carny announces the pricing on its share offering, its gotta be down around $10 a share.....so...thinking its a good deal to short this at these levels now...."
Managements To-Do-List for Today:1. Find programmers to fix website to sell Alaska in 2021.2. Offer rock bottom fares to get reservations before sail dates.3. Sell 45 million more shares while the price is above $25.4. Bribe CCD to allow more unvaccinated passengers to spread virus on the ships.
"IMHO, HRB heading to $25 per share this most recent dip.    Only 8 X 2021 EPS and   5.5 times 2022 EPS  where as $GME is trading at close to 200X 2021 EPS probably   300X 2022 EPS,  $TSLA is at least 120X 2021 EPS,   $CCL is trading burning cash to the   tune of $7 billion in 2021! and perhaps another $2 billions will be burned in 2022.  People just buying $CCL on the hope that it will be recovery that is going to take a lot longer than expected.   Just pure madness.  "
"shot myself in the foot selling at 15 a share on a fake drop. didn't buy back in because i thought it would swing lower, but it just kept going up"

"How come the gorgeous @Issay never posts articles like this?Costa Restarts Cruises With New Program From March 27 With Costa Smeralda And From May 2 With Costa LuminosaWed, February 17, 2021, 1:10 AMGENOA, Italy, Feb. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The cruise ships of Costa Cruises, the Italian company of Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK), are ready to set sail again and offer guests holidays filled with leisure and relaxation, along with enhanced health and safety protocols.The restart begins with the departure of the flagship Costa Smeralda, scheduled for March 27 with an unchanged itinerary, sailing guests to beautiful Italian locations, with 3- and 4-day mini-cruises or alternatively a 7-day cruise, calling at Savona, La Spezia, Civitavecchia, Naples, Messina and Cagliari.From May 1, Costa Smeralda will return to sailing one-week cruises in the western Mediterranean, with visits to Italy (Savona, Civitavecchia and Palermo), France (Marseille) and Spain (Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca).A second ship, Costa Luminosa, will also be back in service, departing from Trieste from May 2, and the following day from Bari, confirming its program of one-week cruises in Greece and Croatia.Costa is working with national and local authorities of the countries included in the itineraries of its ships outside Italy to define the details of the restart of cruise operations, with enhanced health and safety measures through the implementation of the Costa Safety Protocol.The protocol contains operational measures related to all aspects of the cruise experience, both on board and ashore, which were implemented in the past months of cruise operations. Such measures include limited capacity, swab tests for all guests and crew, temperature checks when disembarking and re-embarking the ship, protected shore excursions, physical distancing on board and at the cruise terminals, new ways of using on-board services, enhanced sanitation and medical services, and use of protective face masks when necessary.Details of the itineraries, with related booking options, will soon be available on the website www.costacruises.eu and at travel agencies."
Who has a reservation currently? They have a lot of “customer deposits” on their books so it would be helpful to know what refunds (if any) are looking like...
Here is another SHORTY getting burned. BUY CCL ITS HEADING TO $55
"WHY DOES CCL KEEP CANCELING EARNINGS CALL ? HUMM, BAD NEWS MAYBE!"
Great buying opportunity
"As an investor it's important to be able to understand the financial statements of the company you invest in. Looking at CCL's balance sheet, they have significantly more current liabilities than current assets. They have more risk during down times. In other words, they will need to somehow raise money to pay current bills, when their revenue declines. I wouldn't be surprised to see them issue more stock to raise capital at an even greater discount (to attract would be investors) which would further dilute the stock value. If you don't know what I'm talking about, simply click on Financials and then click on the Balance Sheet. It will show you the total current assets and total current liabilities as of 11-30-2019. Keep in mind most companies have more current assets than current liabilities. CCL has 4 1/2 times more Current Liabilities than Current Assets."

"The majority of the CCL holders on this board are a bunch of cheerleaders, not true investors. Keep cheering, as the more you cheer, the lower their 30 BILLION dollar debt will be and all the mess you guys refuse to open your eyes and see, will be swept under the carpet."
"Staying Short on CCL until about 3:50 ET, waiting for the afternoon sell-off. After this one, gonna do KR to the Long side. Very safe play with almost no downside risk, and good 3-6% upside potential heading into earnings release. Supermarket sector has been and will continue to thrive as the Coronavirus stifles the restaurant sector. Why risk eating out, or even getting take-out from a restaurant, when you can get food from the supermarket with much less risk of contamination? KR should be a winner to the upside."
"I have owned $NCLH $CCL $RCL for nearly a year. They currently represent 12% of my portfolio. I continue to hold for the inevitable recovery. Once most people are vaccinated and life returns to normal, these stocks will benefit. All these companies are well run and have managed to remain solvent. Lenders continue to lend to them. Smart $$$ bought in a long time ago (Saudis @ $8 in $CCL). While holding these stocks can try anyone's patience, I can't complain, being up 50%-100% on them already. It is hard to block out the successes that are being had in other stocks, but I'm sticking to my game plan."
Like I have mentioned here before about CCL is always and will be at around $40 in very few short months
CCL only going up from here despite bad news coming out about bankruptcies and unemployment. Temporary problems through summer. Should be $16 by end of week. Buy and hold all leisure stocks IMHO.
"SHORTY has found out CDC is opening ports for test sails, after that FULL STEAM AHEAD!"
"long position at 12.28, if it goes down whatever, I'll just add to it"
"4/14 ALL-IN Journal: Some definite mistakes lately despite some profit. Sold way too early on Cprx after being unsure about the last PR, and of course Bernie dropped out soon after. However, made a nice amount speculating on CCL to make up for it. Lots of people rationally thought these would be red weeks while I held alot of cash, but alas, most things went up up up! So it’s borderline times and may need caution. I’m planning to ride the optimism for now, and bought back into CCL as well as a new somewhat chasing position in MGM. It’s a definite risk, but these sectors were hard hit and can rebound well if conditions continue improving or simply as a several month hold. Light in CPRX currently which I don’t like, so in the event of pullback will buy back in there heavy. CPRX avg. buy in price: $4.32CCL buy in price: $12.38MGM buy in price: $14.86 YTD trading +\-: $1,473.46 gain Current total account worth: $151,473.46"
The real reason....not because of the mumbo jumbo scare tactics put out by the shorts. The economy is starting to open up and investors fear of tax and inflation increases...simple.“ Stocks fell sharply Thursday and Treasury yields hit a one-year high as fears of higher inflation resurfaced despite Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplaying the risks of increasing price pressures.”
Shorts are in deep trouble.
"CCL has been rated a 45% of bankruptcy, unless cruising fully returns before the end of 2021. I don't feel very confident right now"
"CCL vs NCL...less people affected by percent of passengers traveled or by flat number? No way NCL beats CCL by percent affected by total people traveled. NCL has 17 vessels with 2.7million passengers per year. CCL has 26 vessels with 13million passengers per year. If the average cruise is seven(7) days then there are 52 cruises per ship per year. Average passengers per ship for NCL is 3,000 and average passengers for CCL is over 9,000. Three times the capacity and ten times the vulnerability for CCL than NCL. So, in real life numbers CCL did a great job considering how large it is and how many people they carry compared to tiny NCL.."
so analyst came out and said $16 per share - did she miss out on buying or something?
Fact check 30 million unemployment now not 26 million shoutout to John for correcting the numbers
CFRA maintains SELL rating on CCL !
"If you don't think this is heading back under 15, then you need help learning about reality and fundamentals."

"Once we see a slowdown in tech stocks. I believe that will be the first indication that a transition from mega cap to value stocks is happening. Once that happens all these high quality stocks that got hit hard from the sell off will start going back up. Almost impossible to find a bottom, but we gotta be close. Get in before this stock rockets. People love cruises and people are eager to get out of the house and vacation. The only thing stopping us is the border shutdown. Remember markets price events roughly 6 months in advance. Good luck! :D"
"These poor cruise  line companies will not be able to cruise until April of next year. They have be losing millions of dollars every month. They have been a whole year without cruising practically. These companies have taken so much debt an issue new stock that they have been weakened incredibly, I do not understand why they have moved up so fast. In my opinion carnival should be trading between $8.50 - $10.00 dollars at the most. It’s kind of crazy to be buying them at these high levels. Right now these are speculative companies and it’s very scary to buy a position of these prices. I’m pretty sure a lot of people are really shaking."
"Bazzillionaire is making false accusations about myself and other users and is breaking Yahoo guidelines. Everyone, use the Report Abuse function to report him to yahoo. Let's getting him and his account kicked!"
A couple a weeks ago they said the stock was going down to $10. Now they are saying it will go down to $20. Desperate shorts keep moving the goal posts.
How this stock got stuck on 'cruise control' is unbelievable because nothing's 'driving' it.
How can this company even stay in business racking up this kind of debt. Bankrupcy has to be on the table at the board meetings
Today is a day that we not seen a bounce to take profits. Interesting. I am usually making 3-7 percent a day. Bought again at around 7 percent drops in cruise lines. Let them fall as I will keep buying with these dips. Vaccine is a sure bet . No panic everyone it’s coming and for selling at a huge loss is what they want. It usually drops 3-4 percent then buy but today it kept dropping so I waited. Down I few pennies . But overall up 140 percent. Vaccine on its way .
thumbs up for my puts to make money. thumbs down for my puts to lose money. comment if you think it'll be neutral.

downtrend continues
We are literally one press release away from watching this jump to $25. The moment Carnival declares all passengers will be tested prior to board this stock will explode. The test kit maker Sorrento is manufacturing the 30 minute saliva test now. All Carnival has to do is say yes and boom the $15 Test Kit fee will be passed to the customer. Done deal.
good time to buy?? or add more?
buy the dips
"@Koch Brother they would have to increase sales and profit massively to get to $90, are they going to double their fleet? Also wait for the recession this year or next and then sideways economy or slightly down for a decade. Cruises have invested massively, they will have all these empty rooms and be fighting to pay you to a take one. I was on celebrity summit last year, not exactly new, the traditional dining was the best of the ""worst"" so to speak, vs the buffet, crowded with larger people stuffing their faces with fried chicken and potatoes. While most of the fine dining dishes were trying to be something they clearly were not, it was good and at times very good but certainly not memorable. the service in the restaurant was excellent and the wine steward outstanding lady from Ukraine. If you know about food and restaurants, you can see where they are cutting corners. It is institutuinal catering after all. The beef was the most disappointing. From youtube it looks like the steakhouses on the american lines like carnival and RC are better, but the speciality restos are way overpriced for the little difference in food quality with the main restaurant. In fact, the food is almost the same or exactly the same, not surprisingly. Some of the pluses were the outdoor spa restaurant with helathier options, the 24h excellent pizza, the eggs benedict station with hollandaise on tap and small grill stations behind the buffet. And the maginificent outdoor bar deck at the rear with 270 degree ocean views for meals outside overlooking the water 7 stories up was the highlight. Fortunately, the buffet folks never discovered this hidden gem at the back of the ship and they ate in the glass enclosed cafeteria areas. Anyways, overcapacity, slowing demand and food costs are always risks for these companies. And they can't keep cutting on quality and start charging extras for everything. So it's a catch 22. Airlines are usually bad investments over time, cruise ship market is still rising but as capacity gets fully built out, it will become a fine game of cost control and profit maximisation for any of them to make money next 5 years"
"I go on 3 or 4 cruises a year and Princess give me the best value over 25 years. Around that time, I bought 100 shares for $24+ so I have been kicking myself for not buying 1000 shares and let the dividend ride. The upside is I have gotten 200 to 500 dollars cruise credits a year. I am looking to buy again but now for an investment."

"I am verry bullish about CCL .If you want to make money buy now around 10 a 13 $ , otherwise you wil e sorry over 2 months.The company financiel is good en the have good investers whit lot of money."
Going to 33ish over the next week
Broke all resistance should settle at 25
"Rick Munarriz from the Motley fool sure pays homage to his company name...... what a DUMMY! Where does he get the idea the loans CCL took out have adjustable interest rates that would fluctuate with interest rates rising or going lower? It is mind-boggling how these people write articles with so little insight. Did he forget CCL is one of the only few company's that didn't seek any government financial assistance? BTW CCL's ""loans"" are $4 billion in senior secured notes due in 2023 that carry an 11.5% interest rate. The company also sold $1.75 billion in convertible notes due in 2023 that pay a lower 5.75% interest rate but can be converted into Carnival Corp. stock. a WHOOPING $5.75B THAT IS HARDLY EQUIVALENT TO THE QUARTERLY EXPENSES CCL INCURRED DURING THE PANDEMIC. That would be comparable to someone taking a loan for 3 months salary, payable in 2 years. Hardly a budget-breaking number. What a DUMMY."

"Norwegian Cancels Sailings Until June 1 — Will Others Follow?Norwegian Cruise Line has announced that it has extended its suspension of sailings through June 1, 2021.https://cruiseradio.net/norwegian-cancels-sailings-until-june-1-will-others-follow/"
CCL can't borrow no more. They are out of credit. There will be more share dilution when they run out of money.
I truly believe that pent up demand is tremendous. I have asked many people I know whether they would book if giving the opportunity and no one yet has said they would hesitate. Quite a few said they are waiting to book as soon as they open up. No doubt my informal queries are unscientific but it gives me a positive feeling about the future.

With the new CDC guidelines it opens up more and more cruising opportunities.
Carnival might sail ships at reduced capacity https://seekingalpha.com/news/3561132
Cap is 29.97B and the enterprise is 39.86B (super undervalued). I'm thinking of buying if it reaches $40 a share. I'll be keeping a very close eye on this one.

Abbot laboratories made the first rapid test in USA that give you results of the virus in less than 15 minutes today was approved by the FDA
congrats to the longs who kept all the way through. we needed some positive news and this is it. keep your stomach and HOLD this will only go up. People are going to flock to the industry and this sector. If your going to take profits as you ride up go for it but remember the big news is the vaccine announcement that will give this stock 20-30% push. anyways happy for everyone who kept with it. Im sure glad to see my 3000 shares rebound.
"Maybe the cruise lines can make the ships apartments for the next 3 months, charge $300 a month per room."
"I am mostly cash now. Waiting to see what happens with this ""wave"" of new cases. If we go into lock down again I will be buying the same bargains I bought last time."
@David I think they have over the counter meds for obsession. Check with your nearest pharmacy.
"CCL will start soon. Five minutes test all passengers at the door. Negative result, you in"
With the extension of the closure until Nov - now the ship lines will have to further dilute the float by issuing more shares to stay afloat. Your dreams of $75 in 3 years cannot happen because there will be 4 times as many shares....

I picked up 100 measly shares at 7.83. If their dividend ever comes back it'll be paid for in 5 years plus any upside on the stock. Seems to be a pretty good opportunity.
"From CCL:“There may be additional risks that we consider immaterial or which are unknown. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: • COVID-19 has had, and is expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our financial condition and operations, which impacts our ability to obtain acceptable financing to fund resulting reductions in cash from operations. The current, and uncertain future, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, including its effect on the ability or desire of people to travel (including on cruises), is expected to continue to impact our results, operations, outlooks, plans, goals, reputation, litigation, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price; • As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, we may be out of compliance with a maintenance covenant in certain of our debt facilities, for which we have waivers for the period through November 30, 2021 with the next testing date of February 28, 2022; • World events impacting the ability or desire of people to travel may lead to a decline in demand for cruises; • Incidents concerning our ships, guests or the cruise vacation industry as well as adverse weather conditions and other natural disasters may impact the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage; • Changes in and non-compliance with laws and regulations under which we operate, such as those relating to health, environment, safety and security, data privacy and protection, anti-corruption, economic sanctions, trade protection and tax may lead to litigation, enforcement actions, fines, penalties and reputational damage; • Breaches in data security and lapses in data privacy as well as disruptions and other damages to our principal offices, information technology operations and system networks, including the recent ransomware incident, and failure to keep pace with developments in technology may adversely impact our business operations, the satisfaction of our guests and crew and lead to reputational damage; • Ability to recruit, develop and retain qualified shipboard personnel who live away from home for extended periods of time may adversely impact our business operations, guest services and satisfaction; • Increases in fuel prices, changes in the types of fuel consumed and availability of fuel supply may adversely impact our scheduled itineraries and costs; • Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial results; • Overcapacity and competition in the cruise and land-based vacation industry may lead to a decline in our cruise sales, pricing and destination options; • Geographic regions in which we try to expand our business may be slow to develop or ultimately not develop how we expect; and • Inability to implement our shipbuilding programs and ship repairs, maintenance and refurbishments may adversely impact our business operations and the satisfaction of our guests.”"
@jeff this is the last comment I’m gonna make about you before I mute you. Earlier you said that the restarting of cruising is already priced in. You know this was a $70 stock? It is the farthest thing away from being priced in And the potential upside is huge. Easy mute.
All cruise in USA suspendiert thru may ...And then a 60 period of test cruises...And then the CDC will select a date...Probably January 1..
How does anyone realistically see earnings being positive news tomorrow?
See after hours going up
"Great short at $20.80 AH where it is trading now- Some uneducated investors eye the $50 back from beginning of the year (implied Enterprise Value of $45bn)- Right now the implied EV is $40bn, based on 1,042m shares and $18bn net debt at the end of Q4- Cash burn for this quarter should be higher than management indicated with the sailing halt in Europe- Many lines have suspended sailing for Q1 (P&O today, Princess last week ...)- Cash burn is estimated to be another 2$/share in Q1, which will bring an EV of $42bn That is 7% of where it was trading before Covid.With no ships on the sea now, probably slow recovery to sustainable demand until the population gets a vaccine (probably in 6 months time)Does it sound attractive to hold CCL shares ? Clearly no"

Where is David? Anyone saw David? Probably on the phone trying to get a refund of his deposit to the canceled cruises.
"There is just way too much optimism in the cruise stocks now, to the point people are out of touch with reality. Just one cheerful announcement from CCL CEO (that's their job), does not change the facts on the ground & the financial analysts' downgrades & reduction in in shares target price to $14. Yes, they will sail, eventually, but when and at what capacity? On top of the massive debt they have & diluted shares, cruse companies will eventually sail at a much lower capacity with fewer ships. On top of that, they will have to increase their Covid preparedness cost, drastically reduce their fare prices & spend a lot of advertisement money, to lure people back onboard & gain their confidence. It will take years & years to start earning what they used pre Covid. My notes are based on solid facts on the ground, and not on feelings."
Expecting a big green day tm. Markets are closed on Good Friday. Much more likely to have good news this weekend than bad.
Why are people piling on airlines and Cruises when you got undervalued profitable tech stocks out there??
"Seniors and families will still cruise, best bang for the buck!"
"I'm not really worried at these price levels, I firmly believe that this is an excellent opportunity six months from now. Patience is a virtue and those who really know the markets know that both airlines and cruise companies will be a great investment. good luck and breathe easy. Covid-free cruises."
"Keith, you are very correct. If a green day tomorrow we will be up big!"
Loving after hours tom will be get for us shorts
"At these levels, CCL is a bargain. 52-week high was in the low $70s. This will rebound like Rodman. And this pays a $2.00 dividend, although we will have to see if they yank it for the foreseeable future."
$30 Wednesday

"For those of you that want to know where the cruise ships are right now, there's a website called PTZtv that gives you live web cams of the ship's locations. I ran across this years ago and there is NO charge/fee to use the website. And no, I'm in no way affiliated with the site. I just thought some of you cruise hounds that weren't aware of the site might find it interesting. Everyone stay healthy."
let me get this straight it's burned more cash and diluted more shares and cruises won't resume considerably until next summer.... hmmm..
"The big hedge funds shook Carnival this morning, thanks to Norweigan. I became an investor for the first time during the free fall. Just like clockwork these same firms that sold the stock, repurchased again in the $23 range. Do not panic and sell. Take advantage of dips in the stock to $ cost down if your buy in price is higher. I think by the end of the year you could see $35-40 Carnival."

Projecting to see CCL is at $45 by the end of Jun or maybe sooner when any news from CDC or Homeport moving
Things are looking up !

"There's going to be a point where we have vaccinated everyone in the country that wants to be. if we find out 20% of the population doesn't want it, and that's their own personal choice if they don't, are they going to be refused services or banned from places? is this going to be like modern day segregation where the CDC tells us who can go where and what they can do? because I'll be damned if the CDC tell us we can't cruise because we made the choice for ourselves to not get vaccinated. now if they want to require vaccinations on a short term basis until everyone has had that opportunity, fine. but that should be happening and done by July 1st, if not by June 1st."

LIFTING OF CDC RESTRICTIONS IS IMMINENT. FULLY VACCINATED PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TO WEAR A MASK IN PUBLIC!!!!! LIFTING OF CDC RESTRICTIONS IS IMMINENT. DAYS IF NOT HOURS AWAY. NEWS WILL COME AT NIGHT WHILE SHORTY IS SLEEPING.
THE NEW TRADING RANGE BEGINS NEXT WEEK: $30-$40 RANGE! NICE!
Not sure why everyone is jubilant about recent CDC guidance - it added nothing new and all cumbersome (undoable as per cruise companies admission) protocols are still in place - there wont be any cruising at least through 2022 and for companies lime ccl who are burning 500 million a month (rcl in much better financial position..) that spells disaster...

"In addition, auditors made several significant findings. An engineer aboard the Holland America vessel Westerdam allegedly falsified records on equipment testing and cleaning, and the same vessel allegedly discharged thousands of gallons of gray water into Glacier Bay National Park, a protected area where this practice is prohibited by concession agreements. Separately, another monitoring report alleged that the crew of Carnival Elation discharged plastic trash over the side during an audit in December, a violation of MARPOL."

"We were scheduled to depart on the Grand Princess on March 7th and this wasn’t our first cruise but it was with Princess.Here is my take on CCL:1. CCL and Princess showed tremendous level of greed by putting their crew, passengers, and public at risk.2. We have traveled with Carnival ships previously and was our first one with Princess and had 3 celebrations planned on this cruise. Princess is considered more premium so you pay more but it’s freighting to see that Princess has more issues than even smaller cruise lines or considered cheaper. This tells me Princess has management problems as it seems there is sheer incompetence and greed in the top + mid management there and they all need to go! You can’t possibly tell me that you couldn’t afford to give a shit about health and well being because you don’t make enough? Give me a break! That too after the nightmare they created and single handedly spread COVID-19 to so many people???? After that fiasco the incompetent management didn’t think they should pay attention a little more closely at CCL level? Shows poor corporate governance and culture of patting each other on the back and laughing all the way to the bank. No different than Boeing, Wells Fargo, Enron, and others! At the end of the day, companies are made of people as are cultures so there are some serious issues at CCL that needs to be overhauled.3. We called Princess a few days before our scheduled trip, asking to defer and they very strongly kept denying it. They could have easily shown flexibility and allowed passengers to defer their plans but no, the corporate greed wouldn’t let them which is so deeply rooted in their processes. The lower level employers are told to “tow the line” or be discarded and while the employees themselves felt bad, they couldn’t do it.Mind you, we would have been happy with Princess if they had just allowed us to defer and not even seek refund, giving is a positive experience that would have given them so much good will but no, corporate greed rained supreme. Low and behold, now not only did they have to cancel the voyage but also refund us fully and issue another full credit to convince us to sail with them again. THAT corporate greed cost them more than if they would have done the right thing to begin with and would have gained a customer for life, willing to support them and give them a 2nd chance.But, not at this point. I seriously hope they go bankrupt at this point as we could care less about their credit because no amount of money in this world can make up for their jeopardizing the health of our family, the general public, and their crew that work so hard.These people are amazing and every ship we have been ever on, it’s the crew that make the experience of the guests, not management and for them to put their lives at stake knowingly so that they can save a few bucks to stiff their pockets, is disgusting!I hope CCL stock dives, tanks, and crashes and burns as such incompetence and greed can not be rewarded!"
"$CLL $RCL 3/15/21 Carnival CEO Donald noted Carnival's entire remaining fleet of cruise ships may be operational again by 2021's end, but coaxing passengers on board again in previous numbers may take time. He also pointed out *** the company's fleet is 17.75% smaller, with 19 ships sold off or otherwise taken permanently out of service during the pandemic, likewise probably slowing the normalization of revenue.***** "

Now we’re off   
Volume !!!!
On this board we are getting predictions for the future of CCL across the spectrum - everything from Ch. 7 bankruptcy to untold riches once the miracle vaccine arrives. Here's my prediction: Someone is going to guess right; that someone will be hailed as a genius. (100% guarantee on this forecast.)
"For shorts the game is over, we're on the way to a new 52 week high"

"This stock is a ""shorters Paradise"". The poor saps who bought into the fake Pfizer success story were blind to the CEO of Pfizer dumping all his stock. LOL"
Carnival booked out to 2022 and 65% booked for 2023. Love this stock.
Who laughing now
"There has been nothing but “negative” news with the cruise lines lately. And yet, the dips are weak, and investors are full speed ahead with vaccine distribution looming, and the fact that there is still so much room for the price of these stocks to grow relative to last year."
"@bazillionaire you were right about Harry Bawls multiple accounts. Add Alana, Bree, Rico, and Sally to his list of accounts. It’s funny these comments were posted within 5 minutes of each other and have a descending number of likes "
"Buy the panic drop, experts say vaccine just as effective against new covid strain. Good Luck!"
There is no reason any more to keep cruises docked. Open the up for anyone who is fully vaccinated. Immediately.
Shorties cover on the opening dip!!!!
Christopher is getting desperate!!! I love it!!!!
"Now it will go back to 29, boring..."
"UBS analyst Robin Farley recently ran the numbers, showing that Royal Caribbean has only increased its share count by 24%, even including this month's ATM raise, whereas Carnival (NYSE:CCL) increased its share count by 67%, including convertible notes, and Norwegian Cruises (NYSE:NCLH) increased its share count by a whopping 104%."
"Florida Gov. Has to sue the Gestapo. Wow , how sadd"
Sell call must seek now trust me 27.20
"So, On Friday, CCL tells us they are doing OK & cruses will start sooner than initially thought . They also said in the past they have adequate amount of cash for the rest of the year, even without sailing. Obviously, the share price went up on Friday & Monday, after the latest announcement & just in time so they can sell yet another Billion dollars worth of shares, right when when it spiked!! if the stock holders don't feel they were stabbed in the back, then I don't know what else to say..."
"Something to think about: Lets say there is there is a vaccine/ COVID-19 is eradicated.Do we really think people will want to board a cruise ship immediately following?Or, could there be permanent social distancing engrained in our system. Personally, I think many people will be far more conscious about proximity to others; especially in a housing style scenario like a cruise ship, or close quarter resorts."
Analyst upgrades are pouring in. 30 today & 31 on Monday
All stocks seen there lows 2 weeks ago now phase 1 kicks in gradually everyone goes back. Fall a vaccine from Gilead bookings for 21 are heavy booked CEO said makes sence this stock was 60 by next year it will be back people are fed up staying inside watch what happens
"The best chance of Summer Cruising is most likely a legal challenge against CDC (DeSantis needs to sue today)! CDC will REJECT NCL's request to sail on July 4, 2021, and the cruise line stocks are going to tank again. I'm thinking about closing my positions today and buy back later!"
CDC lifting CSO!Sailing to resume July 1st!Heading to $55CCL = STRONG BUY!!!
"lol, CCL just won't sink, like an old Boston Whaler.. with the huge float short squeezes always providing ballast... I've been having fun with a few shares bought originally @$10, then a few more @$8. When it first hit $15 going up, I limit sold half the shares for at least a 50% gain. Then past $15, set a down limit sell again @15. Then added a few @$13.x. My shares now are at no cost, so it's like a runabout on the lake...no worries, all profit. When the Covid is over, I think I'll get a balcony room in the stern with a view.."
You got to look at the volume on these down days. Hardly a stampede to sell the stock. Just people shorting that will have to cover at the next up day. They are paying a 8.5% premium to borrow the shares so are actually losing money at these levels. Not enough downside here to make a profit shorting. Good luck
CCL head up to break over 28.24 and reach to 29-30 to build the cup
"Hornswoggled again! I bought at $29.95, it went down so I held when I should have increased my position. I saw green yesterday morning for a fleeting moment, then back to red. Harsh hit today, but if we get back to $26.00, This time I will buy that dip and average down. CCL is a long term play and will turnaround along with the industry within the next six months. People are dying the get out and return to normal. Cruise Lines are going to do really well long term. I do hope we can overcome that $30.00 barrier soon. So much resistance there."
"By July 2021 and still no sail, under $20By December 2021 and still no sail, under $10Mark this down......."
Well that walk down was fun. Now we can run this sector up again.
I think people are going to be surprised just how long it takes people to want to start mingling with other people again. Millions of people have been mentally scarred by this social distancing. Travel and leisure will take decades to return to prepandemic.
"For passengers on a Holland America Line cruise ship, a fun-filled voyage on the luxury liner is quickly turning into a nightmare with deteriorating conditions on board and fears of a full-blown coronavirus outbreak after four travelers died and two others were infected.“We are stuck on this death ship,” said Yadira Garza, who is on board with her newly-wed husband. “We are freaked out and terrified that we will be infected too. It’s just a matter of time if we stay on the ship.”Passengers on the Zaandam, currently off the coast of Panama, say they are desperate to get off the liner after Chile wouldn’t allow the vessel to dock. The company also said all ports on the ship’s route have also refused entry. Guests and their family members have taken to Twitter to plead for help.Then came some good news on Saturday: the ship’s captain announced Holland America is moving some passengers to a sister ship, the Rotterdam, because so many crew members have gotten sick, said Garza.

"Shorties are talking all the time about a bubble and pump and dump, but this run up is just a start. With current vaccination speed it's pretty obvious that cruising will inevitably restart by July 1 and by the end of the 3rd quarter cruise lines will be operating at 100% capacity all over the world, from U.S. ports or not"
"Question: If it is highly probable that professional sporting events will be held without fans, with reduced stadium capacity, or not held at all - how is anyone expecting cruises to be allowed during the same period of time?If you’re not allowed to be exposed to a crowd at a 3 hour event, how will you be allowed to sail with thousands of people for a week?Also, if cruises are allowed at reduced capacity and discounted prices, how will the company make any money? It’s similar to the airline industry where the break even capacity is 60-80% full (depending on the airline) before the flight makes a profit."

I don’t own any shares and I’m looking to get in but even with the CDC announcement of delaying cruises UP TO 100 DAYS I don’t think this news will affect the stock much because most people weren’t expecting cruises to start by May 11

"Cruise stocks have negative risk-reward. They are burning gobs of cash every month with no end in sight. The Bulls want to keep pumping of ""cruises to start any day"", now seemingly months on end now. The cruiselines taking a few ships for vaccinated cruises in the Caribbean - those are not going to be that profitable. Neither the Dems or Republicans are in favor of vaccine passports, so why so much enthusiasm that vaccinated cruises will be allowed in U.S. CDC still argues for no essential travel and Covid is not under control. Coloardao hospitalizations are surging despite vaccines (because a large percentage of people chose not to et vaccinated). Some new variants have shown to be more resistant to vaccines. India daily cases surged to 300,000 causing the U.K., Canada and Singapore to ban flights from India. Japan wants to call a new state of emergence with its virus surge. Ontario province seeing record hospitalizations which are being over-run. But the Bulls think sunny skies are just around the corner for cruises?"

"Port Everglades Moving ForwardJanuary 21, 2021Celebrity Apex at Port Everglades“We are talking with the cruise lines on a consistent basis, there are weekly teleconferences. We are talking about what we are doing with our terminals and understanding what the obligations and criteria will be moving forward,” said Jonathan Daniels, who took over as the new CEO and port director at Port Everglades over the summer.The 2020-2021 season for Port Everglades was poised to be a good one – the new Enchanted Princess was slated to call the port home, along with the Celebrity Apex and Odyssey of the Seas.Looking at the new Celebrity Apex outside his office window, Daniels said he was working closely with the Royal Caribbean Group to understand what the terminal experience will look like.“The difficult part will ultimately be determining where the line of demarcation is for accountability and responsibility,” Daniels said.Guests will have staggered check in times, basically appointments to board, and the terminals will need to be re-flowed a bit, meaning various zones for testing, isolation and more.“Laboratories, testing, how does that translate into space in the terminal?” Daniels asked. “What happens if there is a positive case?”Asking those questions is part of an unknown, without answers or guidance yet from the CDC.Head StartThe port’s ferry service to the Bahamas launched for a two-week period in July, as it was not affected by the CDC’s “No Sail” order with a ship under 250 passengers aboard.That meant Port Everglades had a trial run of sorts, installing plexiglass barriers, signage and hand sanitizer distribution stations in a terminal.“We’ve been moving beyond that and integrating that into other terminals in anticipation of a restart of cruising,” Daniels said.50,000Pre COVID, a weekend in the winter could see upwards of 50,000 people move through Port Everglades on a single day with ships at all the port’s cruise berths.With the business mounting a comeback in 2021, Daniels said potential for growth beyond that would be in increasing the utilization of cruise terminals, especially for itineraries leaving mid-week, along with building up more summer business.With a pivot toward closer-to-home and shorter cruises, the port is well positioned in Florida to take advantage of that."

"I think it is time for all of you to look at at the recent FACTUAL financial facts before you listen to me ot the paid pumper on this site. CCL like many companies in recent weeks have maxed out their credit lines. The unknown factor is the length of time in which the decline in Virus case/deaths makes it safe to open a respective business. There are only projections (June?) No one knows the bottom. Please do not caught up in 6% stock moves. We are witnessing 25% upside moves on individual stocks only to have them fall 30% within the next few days. Buy when you are comfortable, I am short many positions today because of the continuing shutdowns of the worlds businesses. A quote from one of the chief officers of The Best Western Hotel chain describing market conditions "" Total Destruction"" you can apply that to the cruise line industry or not, but the hotels have not had to look their doors to contain guests because of the virus. I'm guessing it will take up to 2 years for the cruise line industry to reach 75% to 80% of f past booking numbers? Have you forgotten the crushing blow from the 2009 financial crisis. The press has been playing the contaminated ""Death Ship"" story day after day where no country will allow them to dock. I'm a buyer around 5.50 to 5.75. Say safe and make money."

"My comments are about the latest 600 Million & 1 Billion sales of shares, all within a week. Besides the obvious share dilution & reduction in future earnings per share: A) If they stated in the past that they have adequate cash till the end of the year, even without any sailing, then why would they need more cash this early in the year? It is not even springtime yet. Would they need more in the summer, fall & winter?B) They sold 1 Billion worth of shares at roughly $25/share. If they expect the share price to keep going up & up, as many shareholders are hoping, then why couldn’t they wait till later on this year, when the 1 Billion dollar shares sales would cause less dilution by selling less shares for the same amount of money??To me, this implies that they need more cash than they initially stated & that they do not expect the share price to keep going up."
"So, a company loads more debt on top of what they have, extends the ""No sail"" date further out & gets downgraded by one analysts & its share price target reduced by another analyst and the share price goes up?? This is not sustainable."
Yikes!!!!! good luck longs!

"According to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Global Passenger Report (2017-2019), the median age was between 60 and 69-year-olds, with only 19% of cruisers falling under this demographic.- From; “How Old is the Average Cruise Passenger?” By Darcy Alexander, August 22, 2019. Cruise Holidays, News.People over 60 are especially afraid to cruise in a petri dish of sickness, even after a vaccine is distributed in 12 to 18 months from now (conservative estimate from Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease during a press conference in WA D.C.).Many of the people over 60 will be too old or too afraid to ever cruise again. Who’s left? There is a small number of cruisers falling under this demographic and the rest of the population are not cruisers.Cruising might become an antiquated form of travel and entertainment following the global Covid-19 pandemic. I don’t think cruise line stock prices will ever return to, or come close to, the current 52-week high."
"LONGS, let's give a special thanks to BARCLAYS! They have triggered the sleeping GIANT that is CCL! Again THANK YOU BARCLAYS! YOU ROCK!"
"What is happening now can be easily explained. It is nothing more than a game. Friday the stock was 20% accelerated (initially almost 40%), the short positions were taken and this morning downgrade to bring it down, cover, buy and them push it up. I'm following this pattern along with those the WS crooks. Easy money. This pattern will be lasted for some time, may be the stock will be dropped to 7-8 again, may be not. Actually CCL is the most reliable and well funded among its peers. A chance of BK is less than for all others. No doubt it will come back to 30-40s within next 6-12 months."
"People who are freaking out here are the day traders. Whoever is in for a long term .i.e. at least 1-2 years, this stock will def rise back up 40s or 50s. If you bought your shares for around the price that is currently running, HOLD IT! No need to sell right now, if it drops to $14 or $12 may be buy some more to bring your overall average down."

"Congrats again for those that sold and took their profits. Smart move it's definitely not a good time to invest because of the economic uncertainty that we are facing. Its better to wait and see what happens and how low stocks will go down before we invest. The recession just started and we know the average recession takes years to recover and it takes stocks an average 12-24 months to his the bottom. So definitely stocks will go down as this is just the beginning of a recession. More deaths and unemployment being reported everyday, feds pumping the stock market to make it seem like everything is ok. But everything will catch up eventually and we will all see the light. May will be the beginning of the decline of the stock market as well as housing market and will continue for a long time."
"I have worked for this wonderful company for over 10 years aboard many ships, and I know it will do everything possible to stay in business.

"CNN finally got it right and now predicts spring and summer of 2022 when things might slowly get back to normal. Carnival has allegedly enough cash until end of 2021. In this case, they will need to raise some 4-5 billion dollars more, and at a very high interest rate this time around. This will add to the mountain of debt that they already have. The loans and interest will be too much to carry. It will take them a decade to pay it off. And that`s if there aren't any hiccups. No question in my mind that chapter 11 is coming. They will apologize to shareholders, telling them that they did their best but chapter 11 is unfortunately the only solution left."
A nice chunk up but not enough for me
The Massive # of Vaccinations & Herd Immunity by the end of the month will FORCE the CDC to begrudgingly lift the NSO! Or the impending lawsuits!

"The CDC, the new administration and Lord Fauci is NOT your friend....."
I don't think ccl is a good short now. too much support and momentum .
this is why its not worth investing bc theyre going to make it so the stock prices never goes back up
"Will shoot above 30 on Monday after another upgrade. 20% of U.S. population is fully vaccinated already, cruises in U.S. will certainly restart earlier than expected"
"Now, I'm no stable genius, but I can do basic math. CCL, as of the end of May, had a little under $7b in liquidity. They're burning $650m per month. That's $2b per quarter. So, by the end of August they'll have roughly $4.5b. By end of November, they'll have a little over $2b left. By end of February, they'll be bk. My question is this: At what point in the next three quarters will investors start heading for the exits? Will they wait until November? At what point will CCL declare bk? Do you think they'll wait until February to declare bk? At what point does bk become inevitable? Even if there is a vaccine, it won't be widely distributed by February. The timelines for vaccine and CCL sailing do not match up. Best case, CCL will need at least one quarter more of liquidity ($2b) and, more realistically, they'll need three more quarters of liquidity ($6b). That amount of debt and/stock dilution makes this stock worth $15 in three or four years. If it survives. Which it obviously won't."

"Question for all the bulls here. How cruise lines can possible prevent asymptomatic passengers/crew from sailing on the ship and making sure they aren't going to infect others on board.""Using data from China -- where the COVID-19 outbreak originated -- epidemiologists developed a mathematical model of infectious disease spread. The model estimates nearly 80 percent of confirmed cases of the disease originated from so-called ""undocumented"" cases, or those who experienced mild, limited or no symptoms and went undiagnosed as a result.""Just for reference:https://www.the-sun.com/news/657783/video-cough-can-spread-cloud-coronavirus-across-supermarket-lingers/https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2004973?query=featured_homehttps://www.upi.com/Health_News/2020/03/16/80-of-COVID-19-spreads-from-people-who-dont-know-they-are-sick/7771584372104/?ds=5"
"Nothing is ""priced in"" you're all autists that use this phrase to describe price action that you don't understand. the stock drop from 60 to 8 is easy because its pretty simple to guesstimate earnings are 0 and the risk of bk is high. The stock rally from 8 to 25 was based on optimism of economy and cruise to reopen/resume.This will drop again due to the delay in sailing and this is a big canidate for bankruptcy, the counter argument ppl give is ""yeah but then nobody will be able to sail"".. no dummies they'll still be carnival just restructured through chapter 11 and you'll lose all your money. There will be numerous bk throughout the travel industry. I don't hold buffet on a pedestal like an investment god, but there's a reason he'd rather get something for his investment rather than nothing. You can say I'm wrong, but you can't deny the uncertainty surrounding the industry, which begs the question why the hell do ppl invest here when there are 100s of other possibilities in the market with far better return / risk??"
$29 or $30 tomorrow?
Take into consideration how large groups of people are behaving such as what happened in Florida's spring break and you would like to take a cruise with such large group ?
The eco marxist commies sure do love to delete. CCL strong buy!
"J&J’s vaccine is only 77% effective against Covid. That’s another blow when we are struggling to get supply now from Moderna and Pfizer. Oh well, I guess cruising will be again delayed further."
Corona is over ....couple of cali doctors have analyzed actual data no more harmful than regular flu
Hold and gather.Time is upcoming and CCL wont disappoint us.Hold and gather further more.
This will sail...All aboard...

Fire up the engines boys...Vaccination cruises are on the way...!
Can someone explain what is going on? I mean this is great that is going up. But what’s the news?
"96mil volume, up 14.5%. Huge. Read the news please. CCL not qualified for aid but lawmakers basically guarantee they WILL fix the legislation to get them some sort of relief. THAT is why you saw buying continue!"
"The market is not paying attention to reality, it's moving on the hype of the economy reopening and cruising in the not too distant future!!!"
"Dangerous move shorting recovery stocks with the current vaccine rollout and progress the world is making. Oh well, we will see who comes out on top. I think it’s pretty obvious who will though at this point."
Greece just approved opening up 6+ cruise ports starting Aug 1st. Woot! Great news finally!
"Carnival has resumed to buy back shares again. They buy back 100,000 a day when they buy. With over a $billion of cash in the coffers, at the price of $43 a share, CCL could buy back 25 million shares if the price stays at $43.Fewer shares means more profits for the remaining shareholders. Why increase the dividend now? Buying back shares is a better use of excess cash at this time."
Everyone’s vacationing in 1-3 months. Pent-up demand. Record number of vaccinations and the positivity ratio dropping like a stone. The world is opening up. Get out of the way or...
"While no specific date for resumption was given by the CDC, the public agency repeated how COVID-19 vaccination efforts will be critical in the safe resumption of passenger operations.See Also: Mind The Gap To Enter Norwegian Cruise Line StockThe CDC said as more people are fully vaccinated, a phased approach allows the CDC to incorporate advancements into planning for resumption of cruise ship travel when it is safe to do so. The public agency recommends that all eligible port personnel and travelers get a COVID-19 vaccine when one is available to them.Carnival is also scheduled to report earnings Wednesday. Wall Street expects Carnival is expected to report a quarterly loss at $1.54 per share on revenue of $197.34 million."
"I'm no expert at all in stocks, am a 'newbie' kind of investor... but to me, common sense says that buying this stock at this time is only a WINNER!!: If nothing else, as Covid cases drop and preventative measures start to take hold, people are going to be looking for 'escapes' from the enclosed lives they've been living the past few months, and cruises will provide that... I'm betting that any industry providing 'fantasy experiences' would be great to look into for a nice return in the distant future..."
"Bashers create misinformation campaigns, often claiming to have information on specific stocks or making hyperbolic claims about future performance of a stock. .In most cases, the stock basher will directly benefit by spreading highly negative rumors, hoping that investors will believe the false claims and sell their stock before it fails.This allows the bashers to purchase the stock and reap greater gains. While this seems to be the primary motivation for most stock bashing, some analysts also speculate that some bashers are simply former employees or stakeholders in a company pursuing revenge."

Will resume in 2050February 04, 2021The Outer Space Government on Thursday issued a new order which will prohibit cruise vessels sailing to Mars, Saturn, and Pluto until February 28, 2050. The ruling effectively kills the solar atmospheres season for foreign-flagged ships as well as other cruise seasons until the year 2050 for ships under foreign flag.Only a handful of smaller ships that fly a U.S. flag will be able to sail 14 days Pluto voyages with a maximum capacity of 10 people."

"CCL is such an interesting company. They are masters at converting cruises into profit. The day will come when they sail again with amazing ships. And the public will embrace the chance to “get away.” When calculating future returns remember they pay no US income taxes, have supply networks, booking relationships with customers and nice routes. All that counts for something."
Where my haters looks like uncle Chris was right down trend will continue the bottom should be 24.10 if we break that we are heading much lower good luck
"We need investors to move out of the mega cap stocks ( way overpriced) and into value stocks. Once that happens, cruise lines and travel stocks will go up. Hang in there :D"

"RCL earnings were horrible, but that was expected. I guess the positive from their Report is that bookings for 2021 are within the historical range and prices actually up mid-single digits over 2020."
Money flow is now positive by 2 million USD. Very strong trend for now.
Looking into the crystal ball... I see a bottom of $15 and a dividend reduction to $.60...I don’t foresee an elimination of dividends because of requires of some investments funds...$.60 would equate to a 4% yield on a $15 stock...

if doge coin can go up.. ccl can go up as well. if this is how people invest.. i'm going to say the market is goign to crash.. and that WILL happen.. if everyone treats it like a ponzi scheme
i like how they try to explain why cruise lines went up today.
I love this stock

"State Department says US citizens ""should not travel by cruise ship"" $CCL $RCL $NCLH will nose dive Monday"
CCL is showing signs of bullish run with about 3-4 indictor patterns confirmed. You have a falling wedge 6 points confirmed. divergence played out. low and lower low less negative momentum tested at ema. volume increases with double above average. 2 time levels of indictors confirmed. This is how you get an edge on the market with the price action upside. CCL def has areas of value now. I have been waiting for months for this to turn around and I think we are there guys. do you own research of coarse but to me this is hopeful now for nice run up.
"Has CCL suspended their dividend? I'm looking for information, and am unable to confirm. I hope not, but can't verify."
Trump announces plasma therapuatic approach to treat covid. Which I’m sure you all know by now. Great news for the travel industry and CCL.

What’s your thoughts Investors ??

CDC guidelines for fully vaccinated people. US is opening. With the current positivity % everything should be open in a month.
"why NCLH is better than CCL by survery done by CDC, NCLH has less people infected by covid than competitor like ccl, RCl, less outstanding shares than peers , hence less dilution.plenty of cash surviving with no revenue than peers"

Let ask ourselves few questions:1. Do you get covid test when you enter grocery stores. No2. Do you get covid test when you enter restaurant. No3. Do you get covid test when you go visit your friends/relatives. No4. Do you get covid test when you fly. No5. Do you get covid test when board a train or bus. No6. Do you get covid test when board the cruise ship. Yes
Setting up great for tomorrow!!!! Don’t be left behind!!!

Cruise Ships Cleared by CDC to Plan Return to U.S. Waters
Oh no!!!! Jobless claims higher than expected. The thing everyone forgets about within 2 hours of market open each time!!!!
Reddit traders are right. Stocks are highly manipulated which is why retail needs to fight back. It’s time to buy carnival and Norwegian.
Will Carnival buy fuel futures?....hmmmm
"I work as an equity analyst and I gotta say, some of you retail guys are even more bearish then the crazy ones lol. “Corona apocalypse”. It’s a terrible disease but it’s really only been fatal to older people, people with compromised systems and newborns in third world countries so far. But I too wonder about this bottom. CCL is a really attractive name but it’s cyclical and corona probably brought the trough early and the the extreme. I’d like to monitor this call and see if management sees signs of a bottom."
CNBC said $CCL $RCL $NCLH are reporting completely booked cruises for 2022 and 2023.
reddit is bearish on ccl though. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvwqan/my_bear_case_for_ccl_carnival_cruise_lines/
Should see a nice bump on Monday with JNJ vaccine approval!!
"What a run, just imagine when they can get ships back in the water in 3-4 months?"
$5-$8 by Friday? I remember reading a few shorts expecting that this week. Just curious if you still are?
"Looks like today could be another excellent buying opportunity! With herd immunity, June sailings, and record cruise bookings, CCL is going to easily sky rocket above pre-covid levels!"
"Charts:- Still in Accumulation and trading range. Resistance @$30, will trade like this till broken. No potential huge downside here as always gets bought back up, just struggling to find anything to break the $30 price. Will trade on news for the foreseeable. Good Luck longs :)"
"The Q3 $3B loss and $1B dilution are already baked in the price of the stock as of 2 weeks ago. Any sell-off from this point on is purely emotional. The stock should go back to the $17-$18 range once a vaccine is announced. With regards to future earnings and getting back to the pre-COVID 19 earning range, even if one cuts earnings in half that puts this stock at the $25 dollar tp for next year. am I missing something here?"
Talking with one of my customers yesterday who owns a travel agency. He stated they are issuing credits rather than refunds. They are not giving money back but saying once we start sailing again book it and go. Saves a LOT of money and almost guarentee full ships once this is all over. My buisness has taken a major hit but I am essential. My sales were down 45% last month alone BUT with major reduced payroll spend and cost of operations it is all RELATIVE!! I still hit my profit goal for the month with 45% less sales just by saved operating costs. I believe CCL is in the same position. It's not good but its definitely not the end. Just a pause. If I'm a bank I'm not letting this much assets default.
"If CCL does not fall below $20 today, it would be a bullish sign I guess may look at it eod"
I just re-bought !! :-)Huge potential once they will re-open the cruises
CCL was at $60 plus in late 2019 and it is now heading back to pre-pandemic level in July
I'm in at 14 with 30k in profits. I can sit until this pops. CCL has enough cash on hand for the next year. Could be 30 by eoy when the vaccine is released.
"imagine those who bought at over 21 today at spike, ugh."
The government says America will be back to normal by July 4. I don’t think ccl will have to wait until November to sail.
Maybe today was the VERY VERY VERY VERY big news @Bill was talking about two weeks ago that never materialized.
"I’ve hedge the minuscule dips in cruise stocks with PYPL and AAPL. It doesn’t hurt for me to wait for this baby to run to $42. All it will take is any kind of slightly positive news from the CDC. COVID cases are down to 52k per day, from the all time high in January of 260k. I’ll happily hold CCL and be patient."
Electrifying = CCL = BUY!
Travel stock buyers haven't figured out yet that the World Economic Forum was serious when it said there will be no return to normal. Lol you little people.
"This is not the first time that London closes positive and CCL ends negative in the US market. I repeat, not the first time. Ask Keith. He knows how many time he wrong to count on the London close."
This stock is an easy buy buy buy
"SHORTY: as of 2 1/2 months ago we are up 28%. As of 5 months ago we’re up 44%. I see why you are upset, us longs are banking HUGE! Join the CCL Brainer club and make money instead of constantly covering. Take a guess where we will be in another 2 1/2 months shorty....."
Light upLet's cruise 
let' go cruising!
"Moody's places Carnival's ratings on review for downgrade, rates new notes B210 Feb 2021New York, February 10, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service, (""Moody's"") placed the ratings of Carnival Corporation (along with Carnival plc ""Carnival"") on review for downgrade including its B1 corporate family rating, B1-PD probability of default rating, Ba2 first lien senior secured rating, B1 second lien secured rating, and existing B2 senior unsecured rating. At the same time, Moody's assigned a B2 to the company's planned $2 billion senior unsecured note issuance. Carnival's speculative grade liquidity rating of SGL-2 is unchanged."
Longs can see that this is not a convincing bounce and thus are silent. Let`s see the closing.
Millions of jobless Americans defaulting on their mortgage cannot wait to book a cruise to get the Brazilian strain. This ship is poised to go through the roof despite zero revenue and $bambillion of debt. There is no way it wouldn't.
"UPGRADE TODAY !!!! TARGET $30Today will close $28 PLUS!!! Huge accumulationhas been taking the last few days.Carnival Corp. & PLC (NYSE: CCL) was started at Citigroup with a Buy rating and a $30 price target. The consensus target for the cruise line operator is $23.26, and the stock closed Wednesday at $26.54."
"Carnival Corp. said it is seeking to raise about $1.26 billion in debt to fund its operations as it has canceled some sailings into 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The cruise operator said it has priced private offerings of $775 million in 10.5% second-priority senior secured notes due 2026 and 425 million euros ( $485 million ) in 10.125% second-priority senior secured notes due 2026. The notes, whose offering is expected to close July 20 , will be backed by the company's vessels and intellectual property.The dollar and euro notes will pay semi-annual interest on Feb. 1 and Aug. 1 each year at 10.5% and 10.125% per year, respectively, the company said.Carnival last week said it was shrinking its fleet by 13 ships, a move that will downsize the world's largest cruise company's operations.Sailings in Europe are set to restart earlier, with Carnival's AIDA Cruises resuming three cruises from Germany in August. But it is also redeploying vessels as it faces delays in ship deliveries due to the pandemic, causing sailing cancellations through as late as May 2021 ."
As I said trapped! Don't think we will hear much from them today until something changes and the nasty comes out.
Once they start booking cruises they are going to be sold out because lets be honest people who go on cruises dont care about their health
"Excuse me Keith but I'm the the bearer of bad news. Your job is to update us if CCL is up in London (I'll update if it's down). That being clarified, more bad news from the cruise industry. P&O have cancelled cruises till September. Only a matter of time before other cruise line will announce the same."
"You know how the stock market works. For those who think that the markets will be waiting until positive trend became obvious for ordinary person I can state - you are too late to the pie. It will be eaten well before. The market always look not at trend but rather at changing a speed of trend or at acceleration. How it works? Let's say a pandemic (new cases and death toll) is still increasing but the market watch a speed of pandemic growth and if this speed is started to stabilize it is a direct signal for getting bull. Mass media at the same time will continue terrify people. We had an initial huge drop of almost all stocks, then some kind of selection started to take place. CCL lost 80% almost from 2 months ago numbers. It is a record drop ever. Can it go lower? Definitely it can. How low depends on rather not from reality but rather on intention of major players. We can expect a double or triple bottom, we can see even lower digits, say $7 but in a final analysis CCL will return to 40-50 again. Those who are buying now will make 400-500% profit. How long it takes? nobody knows. JMHO: from 5-6 months to 1-1.5 years. Forget about 3 years, may be to restore all the business and profitability level you will need 3 years but the market will bake it in all in advance."

the USA has 90 reported cases of Corona virus but very few tests have been performed. Look for that number to jump in the next few days as tests become available
Oh I see someone is trying to copy me again! Who could that possibly be?
Trump may announce tonight
Are the initial cruises hopefully in July be limited to 50% capacity?
"CCL might be the perfect candidate for a short squeeze stamped run by robin hooders. Look what happened today to Jwn , m, game shop and many others with high short interests.Careful shorties"
2 Shorties heading to bank to cover more losses!Hop aboard the CCL Money Train!!!
Why are we still dropping?
"So you know shorts won’t let it stay above $27 for long, until they get permission to officially cruise this stock is controlled by the shorts"
Waiting for a drop to buy so the wife can take advantage of the discount on drinks and food if you own 100 shares. Not fan of them bouncing back this year with the amount of cancellations going on.
"Just remember this, most of the people that cruise are elderly. So when the vaccine comes out, they will be one of the first groups that will be receiving it. At that point, like me, I’ll be booking more cruises."
"Anyone thinking that this is having a hard time breaking 12 because of the calls expiring tomorrow? Im holding long, but curious what yall think."
What a nice run for the leisure stocks including CCL this is making me lots of money
Moderna ready for the vaccine
Dilution @ 25.10. Dilution @ $29 or $30 I'm guessing. People might just buy this stock on pure recovery. More delays announced today until June 30th. Dilution will come but you guys can jack it up to like $32 or $33 and they'll dilute you guys at that range when they need another 1 billion to run for 2 more months. In my opinion this is less than 20 dollars
REMINDER:JEFF IS ALSO CHRISTOPHER
Issay told you so...........
Public offering needed to stay afloat. This thing not making money right now for share holder
@Harry Bawls Ambulance needed?
Reality setting in that this company will not be profitable for a very very long time. Only recourse is Chapter 11 and wipe out debt and shareholders. People paying this ridiculous price for this stock deserve to lose their money. You should know better
OF COURSE nclh did a public offering.. knew it was goign to happen. no guarantees for summer reopening as well but they hype is sure goign to be strong to bring this up and then another offering because 6 months til summer from now is an awfully short time to prepare everything to reopen for cruises.
A year ago this Friday CCL closed at $27.15. We may be days away from a 52 week high.
"NCLH hints at bankruptcy, it has the least amount of ships, look at that burn rate. CCL has the most amount of ships, and those 8 ships sailing aren't going to cover the cost. I'm skeptical they'd sail at all given the rise in COVID cases in Texas and Florida. I do think the COVID cases will ultimately suppress demand, which they'd try to offset with price drops, this could mean that overall, on a per month basis, they'll be operating at a loss.https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-travel-industry-will-bounce-back-norwegian-cruise-line-says-but-for-now-its-burning-cash-51588086284"
SHORTY: It obvious that CCL FELL extremely LOW during PEAK of Covid-19. As people are vaccinated CCL goes back UP! CDC WILL be lifting the CSO and this stock is GOLD!
"This report was initially supposed to come out in early December I think they've been looking for financing they're shopping for money I can't imagine anyone wanting to loan the money at any interest rate with the uncertainty that they face and a debt level that is in excess 25 billion. Before the crisis they had profits, yearly profits of 2.1 billion dollars. Even with those profits they had 10 billion in debt. Even if they went back to the margins and the bottom line that they had before the pandemic they're looking at 12 years just to pay off the debt. This thing is a total scam I can't imagine their entire net worth of assets even comes close to the amount of debt they have especially when you consider most of those ships are good for nothing but scrap"
"There is 0 reason for it to go up. Sell now and get back in later1. More COVID cases than ever2. False vaccines hope, no vaccine will be widely available until late 20213. No sail order, all cruises cancelled4. Share offering, insane dilution5. 0 Revenue, cash burning, they are selling 20% of their fleets as well"
It’s going to take ONE simple tweet from the Big man and this stock will DOUBLE in 10 minutes...watch
"(Note: I'm a different ""Robert"" than the frequent poster here) My wife and I have reservations for two upcoming Princess cruises (Nov. and Jan.) and I expect they'll be sailing by then. Many large companies have run at a loss for years (e.g. Amazon); Carnival is not the only one. This pandemic is not Carnival's fault; but the cruise industry has been unfairly discriminated against by the CDC (airlines should have been subjected to the same stringent guidelines). And as far as ""95% of passengers will be vaccinated,"" I'd rather it be 100%! If the ""no-vaxxers"" want to cruise, I suspect they'll have to change their tune very soon. I actually can't wait to see how Carnival and the other lines deal with the many people who won't comply. I suspect that many of these anti-vaxxers will soon be hustling to get doctor's notes."
It’s time to buy. This is the week CDC will release a date that cruise can start operating again!!!!!!
insiders loaded up on ccl this week ???makes my 88k shares at 8.08 feel greaaaat !!!!!!salute

1.6M Americans were vaccinated today.
This tiny pullback is a great buying opportunity. Less than 5% downside and 50-100% upside at this level
Next time it will jump over 30 we'll never see 20s again. Resistance at 30 will be broken very soon...
Where is that guy @Harry Bawls? Hows the puts this morning?
"Name Names? Goofy Goober's, LOL!BEWARE!16 of 19 Posts and replies today have been from the same person using multiple usernames."
"How is CCL planning on servicing their $10 B debt and paying their shipbuilders (17 ships under construction), and paying ship storage and dock fees, and keeping and paying their employees, if they have zero revenue for 6 months?

"I've said this many times on here. There's reason why you look up previous trend. Not saying they are 100% correct but you can see when it will start to pull back. I hope no one is stuck in that after hour push. 6/18 is the earnings. They have burned millions of dollars with no income coming in. Going to be brutal. The trend is, making new highs but it made new lows too. We do have a lot of support to break but I would not surprise to see it does easily. It could fill the gaps below and the bottom one's are mid $13s. I've puts on CCL expiring 6/19 and 6/26. Good luck all"
"Do your own research and do what is right. Don't listen to people who are telling you to buy, hold right now. That's saying you should become a bag holder or buy high and sell low.

"No profits until AT THE EARLIEST 2022 they said but that would be optimistic.... The upside is much lower now due to a 12% smaller company from selling 18 ships, gotta pay back the loans at a high 12% interest rate in the coming years, they diluted the stock to the tune of another half a billion in April, and these are just the top 3 issues they face, there’s plenty plenty more..."

"$2B went to the garbage in the recent quarter, and we are 15 months in the pandemic."
Shorted again this morning and covered for a quick round
Pretty clear Goldman was holding up the stock at $18.05 so they could get the high offering price and make more commission. Shareholders will have none of this.
Bears be like...but it was supposed to go down to $22
$35 is coming.....buy NOW!
Oh Carnival... more pauses and dilutions to come.. I bet you it's goingn to go under 20 dollars. reality is going to eventually sink in and people are going ot realize they need to do another offering. who wanna bet me?
The people bashing this stock saying it will be $2 or bankruptcy LITERALLY HAVE BEEN WRONG SINCE LAST MARCH 2020!!!! The charts tell the real story...do yourselves all a favor and stop reading this board
can someone tell me when cruises are restarting again? i heard it wont start at least until November. is this true? this is concerning. thank you for your help
Once it drops below 27.60 the plummet will be swift
This company won’t be ready to sail for a long time! If you are a long shareholder you will make money in 2021 but if your here to day trade and for a fast buck look elsewhere!
People wont be doing much traveling as inflation starts ripping higher.
"Watch...All CCL has to do is to offer ""Vaccination Cruses"".....Perfect"
"This will pop then come back down, then pop come back down, etc .. etc..If you don't chase you can swing trade the hell out of this.Eventually when they start sailing it will consolidate but be warned, Bankruptcy will be on the horizon for several years. As long as you keep your eye on it should be fine, easy money."
next few days shorts will be forced to covered. All the negative news are out. Nothing but good news from here out. $40 here we come....easily by end Sept 2021
"Solid liquidity: without any revenue, CCL can support itself for at least one year. This is a $60 stock next year. Buy and hold!"

It will go up. What do you think. No ships will ever sail. No vaccine ever will be produced. Now it’s time to buy. You’ll all regret in a few months whenever stock is at 30 something
Sellers won today. Not a good sign.Hope for uptrend to continue back to $40 soon.
"John, you were RIGHT! CCL "
What was that one minute spike all about?
"no one's gonna get the vaccine. the cdc is gonna keep unfairly lagging. people at the top don't want cruising to happen (probably someone they hate is just holding cruise stocks). if there was hope for cruising you would have seen it manifest by now (there is literally no debate if everyone is vaccinated, yet you see debate so prolonged and fishy that I am convinced there is a conspiracy to hurt cruising). as far as the share prices go, everything is made up. 18 is no different than 26 is no different than 28. The relative PE ratios are made up by the people ruining cruising who pump natural marketry out of the markets. there is really no limit to what they can do."
"Looking great, Close around here would be perfect (or higher) might see some late activity before earnings."
CDC has lifted the mask mandate for those whom has already gotten vaccine.Now soon there is going to be some changes for all Cruises.

"I sure hope Carnival's CEO announces some surprise plan during their earnings call, maybe a Plan B to make some new home ports in the Caribbean if the CDC continues to ban domestic cruising, try to make some revenue! Seems like CCL is being out maneuvered by their competitors; however, I'd assume that since they are the budget/economy cruise line co., a majority of their customers won't pay to fly to a foreign port to cruise and most Royal Cruisers/Snobs wouldn't be caught on a carnival ship! Catch 22."

"So true story here. I talked to a friend of mine today who's husband is a physician. I asked how she was doing and she said they were leaving for a cruise vacation tommorrow. When I asked about the virus she said her husband was completely unworried, stating that the flu is more dangerous and most of the fear surrounding this is media hype and unfamiliarity. Further more they are taking his 80 year old parents with him. Granted they are doing the western Carribean and not Asia, but I think this is a valid proffesional opinion that needs to be heard. I would say pick up the cheap stock (and maybe a cheap cruise too) while you can."
Earnings outlook actually helped Norwegian share price.

@HumbleInvestor I would add to your comment that1/ the drastic cost-cutting has made CCL a much more profitable business once it's back to normal so margins will be higher2/ Cash flow return will mean that they will lower their current high cost of financing3/ Gradual sailing over all geographies (starting with Aida and Costa) will stop the cash burn as early as this month. CEO has mentioned how huge the bookings were for Aida when it opened. I expect enthusiam all over the place

"Most of you do not care about facts, however, for those of you who actually think, here are a few facts concerning vaccines in the Philippines, which happens to be were Carnival gets most of its employees. From Market Watch, March 22: ""That brings the total number of doses the Philippines has secured from Moderna to 20 million, including the previously announced supply agreement of 13 million doses, in which deliveries would begin in mid-2021. Moderna said its vaccine is currently not approved for use in the Philippines, so will work with regulators to pursue approvals before the doses are distributed.""Please notice that Moderna's vaccine is not currently approved in the Philippines, and vaccines will likely start in mid-2021 (June). The population of the Philippines is about 110 million. So, possibly the Philippines can have about 20% of the population vaccinated with Moderna's vaccine by August or September. When will cruises start? Maybe by September or October at the earliest. How will this effect Carnival's financials. Likely more share dilution since Carnival will spend an additional $3.6 billion before September. Or possibly, Carnival can keep selling junk bonds with rates above 10%."
Expect bankruptcy protection announcements galore next week. Thanks.

"The most notable news today was from Carnival CEO Arnold Donald, who said he thinks ""most, if not all"" of its fleet will be in operation by the end of 2021. At worst, he thinks early 2022 will see the full fleet active. A huge uncertainty for cruise lines has been when they'll be able to return to action. The longer the pandemic keeps people off cruises, the more companies need to keep their businesses afloat and the more uncertainty when any payback will come to shareholders. If Donald is seeing a quick recovery by the end of 2021, that's extremely bullish for the industry. It's not clear exactly what a recovery will look like for cruise lines. Vaccines are expected to be widely available in the U.S. by summer, and some companies are considering vaccine passes that would allow for more open movement than current restrictions. That could also be possible on cruise lines, where passenger safety will not only be a priority for operators, it'll be key to getting customers to board ships."
"More and more on this board u see the frustration and reality setting in. A lot of younger and inexperienced folks saw this as a big opportunity, along with a LOT of other stocks, back in March/April when everything tanked. They thought things would be going back to normal by now, or hoped for that. They picked the wrong industry. Unfortunately, cruise stocks it’s clear we’re about the worst thing to invest in. Even more than the fact that there’s no cruises happening and Covid is not going away, is the massive dilution from stock offerings and the loans/debt this company and the cruise lines have undertaken. Even in a best case scenario it will not get back near previous highs, I think more and more the folks on here are realizing that, finally. It would take several years of good profits to pay off this debt and buy back shares, etc...to eliminate this massive hole they’ve had to dig for the company. It’s sad really. It wasn’t their fault. But, the dilution and debt is so great and the fact that there’s no foreseeable turn of events that can get this company anywhere near profitability in the future is the reality of things, let alone the 5 or 10 years of big profitability that it would take to solve the debt problem..."
Forecast for CCL: SQUEEZE IMMINENT
"Short squeeze coming tomorrow:)Trump states , that he definetly will support the cruise industry."
11.5 billion in liquidity translates into debt and highly diluted stock
momentum trade might be over. what are the downside support levels to watch?
I have so many people muted on here it's refreshing to only see sensible posts now.
The US vaccinated over 4.5 million people yesterday.
(Sarcasm) Wow. Recently CCL sold additional shares to raise money. Now RCL and NCL announced today they are too. According to the wolfpack on this board and their fearless leader. We should not have any more major cruise lines because they said they will all go bankrupt for diluting more shares.
My prediction is that we punch on through the mystical thirty dollah wall and begin a new upward trendline next week.
"ROLL THE DICE! The stocks trajectory is completely dependent on the CDC's (Communist Disease Conspirator's) allowing sailings in June, and that decision must be made within the next two weeks so cruise lines can begin preparing (takes 90 days) to sail! If cruise lines cancel the summer, CCL will go back to the low teens! Based on the head of the CDC's responses to the Alaskan Senator about sailing, the CDC could care less about the cruise industry, that's whats causing CCL to plunge (time is running out). Time for the cruise lines and AG's from AK, TX, FL, & LA to file lawsuits!!!!!!!!!!"
"CDC Lifts COVID-19 Testing Requirement for Vaccinated Cruise PassengersAlison FoxTue, May 18, 2021, 10:40 AM PDTCarnival Cruise shipCarnival Cruise shipBrittany Murray/MediaNews Group/Long Beach Press-Telegram via Getty ImagesCruise lines are not required to test fully vaccinated passengers before embarking on a trip or upon returning to port, according to updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The new guidance, the latest easing of coronavirus-era protocols for vaccinated travelers, applies to simulated and restricted sailings under the agency's Framework for Conditional Sailing Order. Travelers who got the jab as well as those who contracted COVID-19 within the past 90 days and recovered also don't need to get tested onboard if they come into contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 as long as they are asymptomatic.Conversely, travelers who are not vaccinated have to get tested before boarding a ship on the day of embarkation, on the day they disembark, and between all back-to-back sailings. If they come into contact with a confirmed case of the virus, they also need to get tested and potentially quarantine for 14 days.All passengers must get tested if they show signs or symptoms of COVID-19.When it comes to testing, both PCR and rapid antigen tests are allowed, but PCR tests are preferred on cruise ships, according to the agency.The new rules come just days after the CDC said vaccinated cruise passengers can go maskless in certain outdoor settings and explore ports on their own without having to book an excursion through the cruise line. It's also in line with the agency's recommendation that fully vaccinated people can safely go without masks in outdoor situations and many indoor situations.The CDC has recommended both passengers and crew get vaccinated before sailing and has waived the need for test sailings for ships with all vaccinated people. Last month, the agency said fully vaccinated people could travel freely with low risk to themselves.Several cruise lines have implemented vaccination policies for their guests and require tests before boarding or before disembarking.Cruising in the United States remains on pause, but the CDC has said test sailings can begin soon with the goal of resuming in mid-summer.Alison Fox is a contributing writer for Travel Leisure.

Weekends have become scary for traders in that so much can change so fast in these times.
"The scariest prospect here, in terms of valuation, is how long it will take for any of the cruise lines to return to their former glory. Analysts see Carnival earning $2.25 a share come 2024. One way to look at this is that the stock is currently trading for 10 times what it will earn four years from now, but the more sober approach is that even in 2024, it will be barely half as profitable on a per-share basis as it was in 2019. A big reason for the drop in bottom-line forecasts is that the players have taken on a lot of water this year in the form of new shares and fresh debt. Carnival's full-diluted share count has gone from 688 million to 775 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2020. More shares mean lower earnings on a per-share basis. Long-term debt in the same nine months has gone from $9.7 billion to $18.9 billion, and those interest payments will eat into earnings, period. As a riskier investment, it's also having to pay more for borrowed money. Its interest expense for its latest quarter is a sixfold increase from where it was nine months earlier."

CCL is starting to look like the Titanic going down
"I see the shorts are trying to shake us out, NOT happening, cruises will always be around, they will recover, bookings are off the charts"
I was just reading over my post where the company is looking to raise 7 billion... i totally missed that it says the company is weighing issuing 1.5 Billion in CONVERTIBLE notes AND $1-2 billion in COMMON equity... that is a double dilutive scenario. Ok based on my math to raise 2 billion in common equity at $14.50 a share would mean 137 MILLION in new shares diluting current shareholders.... then the 1.5 billion in convertibles mean they can convert to common at a certain price/ time frame so could easily add another 100 million shares to dilute current shareholders!Anyone long needs to think about how the stock price will react to that level of dilution!!
"Brazil’s rampant coronavirus outbreak has become a global threat that risks spawning new and even more lethal variants, one of the South American country’s top scientists has warned as it suffered its deadliest day of the pandemic.The alert came as Brazil hurtled into the most deadly chapter of its year-long Covid crisis, with hospitals around the country collapsing or on the verge of collapse and the average weekly death toll hitting new heights. A record 1,726 fatalities were reported on Tuesday, the highest number since the pandemic began."
CCL is up today because of the perceived benefit of securing funds. CCL will have trouble getting investors. This will drive up the cost of raising funds which will end up putting even more pressure on the stock. There's really nothing else management can do to avoid bankruptcy. I see the stock continuing it's plunge down to single digits.
"Mexico's last island penal colony may now host cruise shipsFILE - In this March 17, 2019 file photo, a mural of Nelson Mandela, who spent many of his imprisoned years in an island prison in South Africa, adorns a gate in front of the dock where prison staff and inmates arrive in Navy boats to the now closed Islas Maria penal colony located off Mexico's Pacific coast. Mexican officials said on Saturday, March 13, 2021, that ferries and cruise ships may soon be visiting the former prison, after the last island penal colony in the Americas was closed and turned into an environmental education center in 2019. (AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File)MoreSun, March 14, 2021, 9:40 AMMEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexican officials said ferries and cruise ships may soon be visiting the former Isla Marias prison, after the last island penal colony in the Americas was closed and turned into an environmental education center in 2019.The education camp hasn’t gone very well — only 40 youths have been trained on the island — and the administration of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador is now trying a different tack, because the island hasn't been offsetting the costs associated with keeping it open.Officials said Saturday they are planning to build a dock for larger ships on the Isla Madre main island, the only one of the four Marias islands that is inhabited. Visitors will be able to tour the remote island jail, but not stay overnight. Tourism Secretary Miguel Torruco described future tours.“The experience begins with the cruise ship or ferry arriving from Mazatalán or San Blas, to Isla Madre, and on the voyage the passengers can admire the beauty of the ocean,"" Torruco said. It would be quite a long ride; the four islands are located 70 miles (110 kilometers) off the Pacific coast of Nayarit state.- ADVERTISEMENT -“Visitors will have their first contact with the former island prison which for 100 years sheltered numerous criminals,” Torruco said. Officials compared it to the now-closed U.S. prison at Alcatraz, and said tourist visits could start within three months.The penal colony, founded in 1905, passed through some periods of infamous brutality, and as recently as 2013, the Islas Marias held 8,000 inmates.The hemisphere was once dotted with remote island jails like the one depicted in the movie “Papillon,” but they all gradually closed. When Panama closed its Isla Coiba penal colony in 2004, Isla Marias became the last one remaining in the Americas.But far from the bloody reputation of places like Devil’s Island — the French Guiana penal colony shuttered in 1946 — toward the end, the Islas Marias harbored many lower-risk or well-behaved inmates and the colony was viewed as a step toward release or rehabilitation.While the prison kept mass tourism at bay, the islands suffered severe environmental degradation from over a century of use as a penal colony.Island penal colonies were used around the world starting in the 1700s as remote, escape-proof places to “rehabilitate” inmates through hard labor. Often known as “prisons without bars,” with the ocean serving as the most effective barrier to escape, the penal colonies were also known for being at least in part self-supporting and a way to settle remote islands.But in the end, the Islas Marias wound up costing Mexico far more per prisoner than did mainland jails.Chile closed its Santa Maria prison island in the late 1980s, Costa Rica’s Isla San Lucas penal colony closed in 1991 and Brazil’s Isla Grande in 1994. Peru dramatically ended its El Fronton island prison in 1986: Gunboats blew up most of the buildings to put down a riot, killing more than 100 inmates."

"Stock may have some more ""reopen"" pump left in it but realistically CCL and the other cruise lines are not a good buy here given that CCL alone lost 10Billion last year and will lose probably another 5+Billion this year. Even if you fully book cruises the massive debt payments and insane stock dilution alone mean it will take a decade of great bookings to truly get back to similar financial levels of before the CCP created virus took off.Most retail buyers are ignorant of these financial facts and simply buy CCL, $NCLH or $RCL based on the headlines of ""reopenings"" without understanding how many years it will take to crawl out of their deep holes. Just be ready to dump all before the other retail longs figure this out."

"Down she comes... with a steep spiral. Covid-19 cases still climbing, in US new infection records daily. Hard to see how the economy would open for CCL before 2022. More dilutions, more expensive loans, more shops sold... what becomes of the once so great cruise liner?"
"I was hoping to see it drop below $10 to get in  never did. I believe on it long term, but right now it should be dropping. To me, it doesn't make sense why it is moving up if ships are halted. Can someone please explain?"
$CCL $NCLH $RCL cruising is already working safely!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVFQ7aIZl0&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR2zH6G7Y212fIn5QN4hUz3LPgyZbSmhyrli9iAyPrpLNCC94-08Od1Thdg
NO WAY THE NO-SAIL ORDER WILL REMAIN THE SAME. NO WAY WHEN 80% OF THE US POPULATION WILL BE VACCINATED BY SUMMER!!
"A note of caution, CCL has gone down sharply twice in June 2018 once on the 5th and next on the 25th in heavy volumes. The last sell off was in volumes 4+ times the normal daily average. Whenever people sell (heavily) at lower prices, there is a good reason known to those in related business/ insiders. Superficially it is due to the strong dollar and high fuel costs but these were already in the main stream for the average investors. Other factors to consider are that the dividend yield at 2.8% is not exceptional and can quickly go down in a'Cyclical Consumer' stock especially when it is covered twice by expected earnings. This is more so when additional capacity is coming in over the next few years. Bond yields are signalling a possible recession on the horizon according to several leading experts. So it may well be an (buying) opportunity but for the long term."
"Carnival expects coronavirus-induced crisis to affect its operations and global bookings. The company also believes that this pandemic is likely to cause delay in ship deliveries as the shipyards have been impacted as well. Moreover, management stated that cumulative advanced bookings for the remainder of 2020 and first-half 2021 are meaningfully lower than the prior year on a comparable basis, reflecting the negative effect of COVID-19. In the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year and next year has been revised downward by 80.3% and 50% to 89 cents and $2.43, respectively. Carnival has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)For some reason this stock moves up and down by ~10% but keeps within resistance. Talk about knee jerk reaction to any and all news. Its like a penny stock. Earnings not bankrupting banks....lets go up 10% who cares if our earnings are 0 right now and will be for a long time."
CCL = Cash Machine = put some in get more out... need I say more....
Looky Looky SHORTY McSHORTERTENS! Two more days like this and we'll be at $31.16!
"MORE Developments: Congresswoman Salazar is promoting a bill in the house to override CDC CSO! Come on Texas reps, let's get going Abbott, Cruz, & Cornyn! I guess they have more pressing issues like being INVADED by Millions of Illegal Aliens that are covid positive, will eventually be voting for commie dems, and will bankrupt our country!"
The way I read it was the cruise lines association was simply making it's case for July sailing ...a stating the CDC s protocol was merely outdated since those guidelines were made in October 2020. Obviously there is some sort of negotiations underway. Just my opinion. GLTA
Holding until the port again in Tampa FL. Then me and my 3 old daughter are going to play arcade games and swim on the ship like RockStars!! ️️️
"Time to load up, this is not going any lower than that"
"If Cruise Lines are open, it marks the end of the plandemic. The Bharris admin doesn’t want an end. Therefore CCL is a sell"
AAL great trade right here
"Old calculations $53 fair value. With the new shares and loans, and a break even profit for the upcoming 3 years combined. My calculations came up with a fair value of $34. Buying up to 23$, gives me a decent margin of safety."

Yahoo keeps deleting the post but today Princess cruises will (when resuming) have onboard sports betting on their larger class ships. First time ever a cruise line has been awarded the licences to do this.Just check CCL news for info.
Time to set sail to more MOOLAH!
How did shorts get this so wrong?
"SANTA CLARITA, Calif., March 3, 2021 -- As Princess Cruises continues to review and assess its operations following the recent UK Government announcement on the roadmap to ease lockdown and related international travel restrictions, the company is extending the pause of its UK-based cruise vacations, sailing roundtrip from Southampton, through September 25, 2021 on Sky Princess, Regal Princess and Island Princess."
"LMAO!!!!! David thinks that every person that is negative on this stock must be the same person posting under different names. News flash for you David. Look at the market, then look at the volume and stock price of Carnival and that will give you an idea how many people are negative on this stock."
"Those of you thinking that Trump will ""help"" the cruises think about this.It hadnt been 24 since the State Department (which obeys the President) told everyone to avoid cruises. So how do you ""help"" an industry when one of your arms is actively taking it down in order to protect the citizens.Bush and Obama did the bailout while but the State Department was not telling you to avoid buying cars and avoid putting money in the bank.And we are not even at 1000 infected yet but just wait.So how do you ""help"" the cruises. Telling people hey dont use their services but I'm gonna use your money to help them?"
I'm trading Carnival on LSE. NSE is up over 10% BE so will this directly impact LSE stock or will the reddit activity not impact it?
"I use to love going on cruises, but I ain't getting on a big ship any time soon. Sad, but a sane decision..."
"$CCL $RCL $NCLH Looks like Carnival is sailing first, but I’m bullish these 3 stocks. They’re rebounding to pre-pandemic value. "
Bottom 26.10 then head lower
Tradewinds updated their article today to add more context. They should be sued!
People are lying calling for a break out of this stock. It's impossible. The stock cannot and will not break out while all of the ships are docked and not sailing. It will not break out until those ships break out and it appears that is not happening until 2021 and by that time this company will be in serious threat of having to file for bankruptcy having burned through all of it's cash reserve. It's way too early and too much uncertainty to break out. You need to respect the trading range between 11-19 or you're going to lose. With the virus coming back strong in the fall especially strong because of these protests there is no way they will be allowed to sail again before they burn through all of their cash. Even if they could sail they won't be profitable for many years. Just because Carnival isn't going out of business that doesn't mean they won't file bankruptcy and emerge out of bankruptcy. But this stock will be worthless.
I’ve had a sell in at $17 all day...HOD is $17.05...I wasn’t filled....strange
why does CCL keep postponing earrings? Can't they get an accounting opinion? A qualified opinion? Are they still a going concern? They probably lost between $2.25 and $3 billion in the quarter with the additional interest expense. No cruises till Nov. Ccl was supposed to report 3/21

"I bought an oil stocks 5 yrs ago, RIG, at $16. I thought it was bottom because the peak price was more than $100. But, I was totally wrong, The price kept going down, and one day, the oil price went up a lot including RIG. The price went up above $16, but I didn't sell it because I thought oil price would go back up to at least $80. But I was totally wrong again. I kept buying more and more to lower my cost basis but no more. Today, the price is about $1. I lose a lot of money on paper!! And the oil price is about $20. I don't think I can get my money back. I will sell them at loss eventually. My point is don't try to catch a falling knife. You don't know if $8 range is already bottom or not. The company might go bankrupt."

No hope as coronavirus cases are going up again! Chapter 11 is the only option left.
Good news from CDC and the stocks go crazy down? #$%$ is going on people?
Continuation of a multi years rally. DOW will see 50k in the next 2 years. Carnival will see $80-$100+ in the next 2 years. Makes no sense but this is the reality we are facibg after covid dissapears and countries open up and people spend on travel and leisure like theyve never done before. Super bullish on CCL.Carry on cruising 
"Those who bought at $8, made money already . Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty.$8: uncertainty of bankruptcy $10: uncertainty of high fear of sail$12: uncertainty of when start sail ...$16: uncertainty of how far can sailUncertainty , the nature of a stock. Smart money profit from uncertainty. All answer is clear but takes time to proof. Isn’t it the nature of a recovering stock ? Seat tight and watch it go up !"
Seems like we're getting volume today

"Question for the bulls - let's assume we identify asymptomatic passengers through tests. Generally, passengers get down everyday and come back to the cruise in the evening.

How can cruises control this?"

"Baron Rothschild, an 18th-century British nobleman and member of the Rothschild banking family, is credited with saying that ""the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets."" He should know. Rothschild made a fortune buying in the panic that followed the Battle of Waterloo against Napoleon.Bad Times Make for Good BuysContrarian investors have historically made their best investments during times of market turmoil. During the crash of 1987 (also known as ""Black Monday""), the Dow dropped 22% in one day in the U.S.In the 1973–74 bear market, the market lost 45% in about 22 months. The attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, also resulted in a sizable market drop. The list goes on and on, but those are times when contrarians found their best investments.After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the world stopped flying for a while. Suppose that at this time, you had made an investment in Boeing (BA), one of the world's largest builders of commercial aircraft. Boeing's stock didn't bottom until about a year after Sept. 11, but from there, it rose more than four times in value over the next five years. Clearly, although Sept. 11th soured market sentiment about the airline industry for quite some time, those who did their research and were willing to bet that Boeing would survive were well rewarded."

I remember when this was $11.. wow time flies but I always listened to people on here. Made money shorting the stock but regret giving in to the fear of everyday investors have. I am a better investor because of the experience of reading what people say about a company and doing the complete opposite of what they say. Good luck everyone

"Two things should happen in the next ten months: 1) I will be sipping a pina colada from my balcony suite on my Carnival cruise to Cabo, and 2) this stock will be at $30+. Just say'n."

I am going to document this on here bc I don’t know where else to go. I went on a cruise through a port in Florida that has 3 coronavirus cases and my group and I have been experiencing flu like symptoms. We called DHEC trying to get a test...
"Just my opinion of course, but Carnival aren't scrapping the flagship of their fleet, but the older, smaller, less profitable ships. They're selling the ships they were planning to sell off anyway. Which means that the company no longer needs to pay to keep them operating indefinitely. They would need to be replaced of course, but not until the company is in a viable position to fully accommodate said ships. Therefore Carnival would currently be running a somewhat streamlined and more cost effective operation which would certainly assist in the regrowth of the business."
Looks like the company is going to wait until AH to announce when their cruises will start again....would not be good for stock if they say end of April!
"Oh Yeah! CCL inching upward. You see, it’s inevitable that CCL will explode to $65! Pandemic is getting under control a lot sooner then anyone thought. This spells CSO Liftoff! Buy as much CCL as you can folks!"

"Since CCL & Royal are going w/un-vaccinated route, are they rolling the dice that they can do test sailings and be approved by the CDC by July or has the CDC given them assurances for sure allowing July restart?"

"New Carnival and Royal Caribbean Ships Are Heading to FloridaMay 18, 2021Mardi Gras (top) and Odyssey (bottom)Two brand new cruise ships that have yet to see paying guests are now confirmed to be heading to Florida, and both to Port Canaveral, in what may be a signal of impending restart news.Royal Caribbean International was forced to cancel its Israel season aboard the Odyssey of the Seas due to the conflict in the Middle East, and the new Quantum-Ultra class ship is now heading to Florida, where she is expected to arrive later this month.Carnival Cruise Line is making a similar move, opting to sail a trans-Atlantic crossing on the new Mardi Gras from Barcelona to Florida, arriving in Port Canaveral June 4.The ship moves also follow news from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week, as the agency has lifted some of its more complex requirements surrounding the Conditional Sail Order, with more changes expected to follow."
"A lot of people believe that once cruises crank back up, CCL will simply pick up where it left off in 2019. Folks, that corporation no longer exists. I order to survive, CCL has dug itself a financial hole that will take years to climb out of."
"Great long term investment at still discounted price, would be adding to my portfolio."
"https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/16/will-the-coronavirus-bankrupt-carnival-corp.aspx2020 has been a rough year for CarnivalCarnival has been especially hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, particularly its Princess Cruises line. The nightmare started with the Diamond Princess, which saw over 700 of its passengers and crew contracting COVID-19 during a tour of East Asia. Later, the Grand Princess, Coral Princess, and Ruby Princess all had major outbreaks onboard.On March 12, Princess President Jan Swartz announced a pause of ship operations on the Princess line. This move, along with overall market weakness due to government-mandated travel restrictions, has led Carnival to impair the carrying value of ships in both its NAA segment (which represents North American and Australia) and its EA segment (which represents Europe and Asia). In total, the company recorded $731 million in goodwill impairment charges for these reporting units in the first quarter.Carnival's fiscal-first-quarter revenue (which represents the three months ended Feb. 29) did not show notable coronavirus impact. Revenue was up around 2.5% from $4.67 billion to $4.79 billion year-over-year. But the goodwill impairment charge was a major factor in Carnival's bottom line deteriorating from a profit of $336 million to a loss of $781 million.Management taps debt and equity marketsThe cruise industry is notably excluded from the White House's $2 trillion economic stimulus plan, and it will not be receiving a bailout. This means Carnival has had to tap the debt and equity markets.Carnival has undertaken a public offering of 62.5 million common shares for $8 each, along with what's known as a greenshoe option that allows the underwriters of the deal to purchase an additional 9.375 million shares if they want. The dilutive capital raise is joined by a debt raise of $4 billion worth of 11.5% senior secured notes and $1.75 billion in 5.75% senior convertible notes -- both due in 2023.When all is said and done, Carnival will have around $7.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet (adding the $500 million from stock sales and the $5.75 billion in debt raised to the $1.35 billion in cash the company reported in the first quarter). The new capital should help Carnival through a near-term slowdown, but it won't be smooth sailing because of the company's significant cash outflows. Can Carnival fight off bankruptcy?Carnival burned through around $12.9 billion in operating costs and expenses in fiscal 2019. The company will quickly run out of money if it faces similar cash outflows in 2020.The good news is that at least $5 billion of these outflows (food, fuel, tours, and onboard) seem to be variable, while $5.17 billion (payroll and ship operating costs) seem to be fixed. That means Carnival will have to pay these outflows whether or not it runs cruises. Carnival's $2.72 billion in commissions, transportation, and other outflows seem to fall somewhere in between variable and fixed cash outflows.With around $7.6 billion in cash on its balance sheet, Carnival should be able to sustain an estimated $5.17 billion in cash outflows for payroll and ship operating costs. And it should also be able to pay the $1.8 billion in debt maturing in 2020. The only other major challenge will come from new ship deliveries. As of the most recent annual report, the company has up to 17 additional ships scheduled to be delivered by 2025, with six new ships entering service in 2020."
No chance cruises are going to be resuming operations in 30 days. None. You guys watch happen the continued delaying of the date of resumption of cruises. They will one day but the questions is will this equity survive or will the current debt/creditors own the company?

"really sorry for all those who sold recently. with the news that cdc is allowing summer cruises, you missed out on tomorrow's big pay off you were waiting so long for..."
Time to buy more! These sub-30 prices won't last long
If you guys dont feel 100% comfortable being on a cruise ships or sending your parents on a cruise ships befor there is a vaccine or the virus goes away. So what makes you guys feel 100% comfortable to investing in cruise ships right now? Warren Buffett says only invest in companies you are 100% comfortable with. Serious question

CCL is setteing up for a huge price reduction and the catalyst will be its earnings report. If your still buying or holding shares you deserve to lose your money.

"Soon the cruises will begin , IMHO , and the lame bashing will end. Too many jobs at stake and Florida is a battleground state . The pressure is building in Miami ."
"I work in the casino industry, similar to cruise lines in the large gatherings. What I see is the younger people don't seem to worry. They flock to the casino and some get upset if you tell them to put their mask on. I also notice a decline in older guests. I think the cruise lines will be similar when they set sail. For investors, it's good to know the younger ones are much more free spending. For that reason I believe the cruise lines will return to profitability."
this is only the beginning
i'm not even in disbelief and I know it's going to go down even further because I rode this rollercoaster and I made a lot of money until recently but oh boy... this ain't a easy ride..
THis is a buy and hold business!!!
"The travel industry, especially the cruise industry , will have to pick up the Covid-19 coverage that Air Canada added today . You can beat they will pick up on the idea and then the CCL stock will soar"

"Shorties are panicking, AstraZeneca and other vaccines are here in two weeks. Cruising will start by February 28,the rest is history"

Buy before it is too late!
"Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has revealed she’s “deeply concerned” after the decline Covid-19 cases and deaths stalled amid new variants spreading through the United States.“I remain deeply concerned about a potential shift in the trajectory of the pandemic,” she said during a White House coronavirus briefing on Monday."
"Is anyone going to hold into the earnings coming up in a few weeks? Just curious what this stock is going to do ahead of earnings that is going to be horrendous. If this stock rises ahead of earnings it will not get a pass for the horrendous earning report and the market will crush it, on the other hand if it crawls back into the lower end of it's trading range no damage is done. I suggest sell and wait until after earnings. Jun 18, 2020Earnings announcement* for CCL: Jun 18, 2020The upcoming earnings date is derived from an algorithm based on a company's historical reporting dates. Our vendor, Zacks Investment Research, might revise this date in the future, once the company announces the actual earnings date."
only 2% jump in premarket. Looks like people don't realise how big the vaccine deal is. If what Dr. Fauci say is true everyone will be vaccinated by December. From fundamentals CCL's balance sheet is quite strong. They were able to raise another 6B capital and they erased 1.5B debt last week. Also the management says they expect revenue growth to be 15-25% yearly due to decreased competition. I think CCL will be trading around 35s in 2021 summer and 60s by 2023.
cruising without vaccine equals to suiciding. Its almost like a coffin floating in the sea. go cruising.
CCL kinda looking like this......up....up....and away$$$

"Let's put carnival Cruise lines to work! We should have CCL go ahead and make port in Brownsville Texas, and take on all the illegal immigrants that they can. They can now take this large group of potential new Americans straight up to New York, right past the Statue of Liberty and into the port of New York. This will give Governor Cuomo a brand new base of very supportive followers, and move them out of the area in Texas that is causing such pain and public shame due to the partially built wall. They will then be able to take advantage of the $23,000 grants that the state of New York is giving to undocumented workers. I see this as a win-win for the current presidential leadership. In the meantime CCL will get you charged exorbitant transportation cost, and charge it to the United States government. What a country"
"But in an emailed response to questions, the CDC said the so-called Framework for Conditional Sailing Order, or CSO, remains in effect.“Returning to passenger cruising is a phased approach to mitigate the risk of spreading Covid-19,” the CDC said. “Details for the next phase of the CSO are currently under interagency review.”The cruise industry can get back to business under the current framework, but the companies said Wednesday that it has set back their return and “unfairly” singles out the industry from other tourism and hospitality sectors."
"Macquarie Upgrades Carnival to Outperform3/2/21, 8:57 AMMarch 2, 2021 11:57 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsMacquarie analyst Paul Golding upgrades Carnival (NYSE:CCL) from Neutral to Outperform."
CCL has a 200% increase from this time last year in bookings for August already
Can somebody please tell me as to why NCLH share price is higher than CCL? I'm comparing numbers here and can see no visible reason for this.
"All you vaccine experts. Yes, you. You who keep predicting an early sailing thanks to massive vaccination that is taking place. So far not even one of you here said that he/she took the vaccine. There are about 30 regular posters here and not one took the vaccine?? Are you all part of the 40% that say they will not take the vaccine? Or do you belong to the group who are ""somewhat likely"" to take it but only after others take it first? J&J can come out with a billion doses. You need 75-90% of the population to take it in order to achieve herd immunity. So, which one of you cheerleaders will be first to lie and claim that he/she took the vaccine and that it was so delicious that they can`t wait to get the second dose?"
"I didn't catch that CCL issued an additional 15 Million shares with the description ""Securities offered to employees pursuant to employee benefit plans"" with a proposed maximum offering price of $8.15 per share.That feels a little flipping shady enriching their management during a crisis..."
Got in between 8s and 11s and sold in the 13s - Hope it holds these levels glad to see its still going up for everyone else! I'm afraid to get back in with how fast its moving up
Cruising higher today??? Better and faster tests guarantee safe journey. 
shorts wili have to cover by end of day...CCL and NCLH and all the othrs are going strong with bookings increasing for the spring and summer all over the world.
CDC will be updating travel guidelines at 11 EST this morning.
"Over the short term the stock price is going to crash below $10. It is virtually certain due to the stock offering. Intraday short covering is just noise.I am a buyer under $9 and I can see a path to $5-$6 for a near term dip.One thing is assured, more RED ahead."
"Leak, CDC lifting guideline for all Cruise ship companies who met CDC guideline.With 50% of the cost for keeping passengers safe is adding to the booking price."
Don't let the negative posters and media trying to create fear. CCL has enough cash to survive and we will be cruising by the end of the year. This a buy and hold for at least a year. Easy money for the patient. Don't give into the fear and remember why you bought in the first place. Happy sailings!
"You think humans are going to stay at home when a vaccine comes out? people are hungry to get out and have some fun in these leisure industries. From the looks of it this virus is going to be around forever just like the flu, humans will need to adapt to it. $CCL $SPR $CZR $PLAY $CAKE"
From here on out I think positive news will start to replace the negative news. Might make a few dips south but the trend is our friend and it is UP.
Honest opinions for Monday?
Just made another 8K on this .93 cent jump......Can't wait till $40
Down about 8% on higher-than-average volume while the rest of the market is green. Not a good sign.
"I am looking to take a long position in CCL. The recent impact of the coronavirus has yet to be fully priced into the stock. Also, a looming market correction may magnify additional stock price collapse.I am thinking max pain on the stock price won't occur for 4-12 more weeks. The key here is to be patient. I'm thinking of taking a large long term position with averaging in starting below $40 a share.What are others thoughts on this?My goal is to take a large position at an extremely attractive value. Hold for long time selling covered calls and collecting dividends."
People with vaccine card will he allowed to cruise. It's official
"It's hard to decide whether I should let this winner run, or take my profit and wait for another opportunity"
MC analyst downgrade with $6 price target. wow
Just read article stating cruise bookings have increased in 2021. Long CCL!
wowza...up >100% now in two months... a 30year T-Bill held to maturity couldn't do half of that!
"The CCL Longs come May 1, 2021!"
Jeff/Christopher said on Tuesday $25.70 by the end of the week!!! Lol
"This is really the bottom, buy as much as you can! Big gains ahead."
"CCL $42 BY MAY 1, 2021!"
What do we think of earnings?
CCL only to come RAGING back.....this is a $60 stock.....easy money....hold steady!
Jared told me it wouldn’t go green today.
"booking looking excellent, now the government just needs to allow travel in all aboard can prove vaccinated! With new CDC guidance, very soon now!"
I'll be a Jim Dandy...................................NOTHING GOING ON HERE !!!
How can it go to $7 if the offering is $8?
I told you guys the puts were cheap last week.....
"Christopher was right, I better get out while the getting is good!"
I expect it to keep dropping in price ranging from $25-$29 then hitting 40 & eventually 60 at one point. However the Price quotations mean nothing to me. This is a great business to invest in regardless of the current situation & If cruise businesses go bankrupt then we’d have an even bigger issue. Will they recover yes but it’ll take them some time. The more capital they get from their stock the faster they’ll recover.
CDC meansCruises Don't Count
"Glad I took profit yesterday, no BRAINER. I'll buy back under $12"
Another CCL subsidiary halts operationshttps://www.cruiseindustrynews.com/cruise-news/22596-costa-to-pause-all-cruises-until-april.html
Cruise lines must prove covid protocols before being able to sail. Sounds reasonable to me.
"Has anyone got hurt by securing your profits in your pocket? At this point, pure gamble if you're holding and still thinking it will go up much higher even though the earnings report is on 6/18."
"If this was going under it would be toast already. Truth is, it’s holding steady and going to be in the mid 30’s in April. This is EASY MONEY!"
"Resistance here on the longer time frames, lets see if we can get past it.Good luck longs :)"
People keep saying DOWN 50% by FRIDAY!! Yo. We are all aware of the financial condition of these companies during the pandemic. This price should largely be baked in. Might see some drop but nothing so drastic.
Nearly $29! Pretty Good!
"$8 billion in cash, and whole company is selling for $13b.Part ownership in ships alone is worth more than double that, then add systems, brand, real estate, licenses, ports, etc etc.This is a steal for anyone with patience. Covid was scary at begining of year, but now its clear this is not end of world event.HUGE oppt for those that are patient here.In 2008 this recovered like a rocket, same will happen now"
It appears johnny worked for CCLAnd has been sidelined and brokeDon't worry johnny. You'll be cleaning toilets again. Real soon. Mopboy. 
"We have some BRILLIANT CCL holders that are more knowledgeable & have more insight than Carnival's CEO himself, who announced that Carnival will be facing few tough years & will take couple of years to recover."
gap 27.2 must be closed before the stock resumes a rally. That is why I sold out at 30 all the position patiently waiting for 27-27.2 to get filled again.
"I like how nobody wants to say it. Nobody wants to bring it up. Everybody clinging to the dream. Ok. I'll say it. EARNINGS. Yup, I said it. Gonna be a bad week for shareholders. But have no fear. You'll see a decent ROI. In about 5 years. Buy on the dip below $20 this week. You can thank me later."
"if you look at the airlines they are already close to pre pandemic levels. This little guy will get there too. Just hold, she'll be riding closer to 50 than 30 before long. Summer isn't here yet."
JP Morgan set a price target for NCLH at $18 a share it is currently trading at $10.92 a shareThat is over 60% increase at its current price. Carnival cruise line is in a better situation which means it could potentially increase at least 60%￼ or better than $20.43 a share

"Carnival has 10bn in cash reserves. It doesn’t need anything until the CDC lifts restrictions. If Covid positivity rates keep dropping and vaccinations continue at this pace, that could by April/May"
"Would anyone go on a cruise at this point. Not making light of this situation, and I have no long/short position at this moment...but you could not pay me to get on a cruise at the moment. Meaning I would not take the fare as revenue to get on a cruise ship. Would anyone?"
"Sorry, but I'm over the CDC trying to continue controlling our lives and country. From todays hearing...""U.S. government lawyers countered that Florida has no standing to sue, and that the CDC, not the state, has the power to regulate cruise ships sailing from American ports."""

"don't think you'll see a return to peak profitability in the cruise industry until 2030,” says Ader. “And that's just not a function of demand coming back, because I do think the cruise industry will see people want to go on cruises. But the prices will be a challenge. People aren't going to pay a premium for it right away.”"
"Here is a very good article that speaks about how long it will take the cruise industry to recover.https://www.cruisehive.com/why-2021-might-be-a-difficult-year-for-cruises/44811From the article: ""Ships sailing at reduced capacity, 100% testing, social distancing, mask-wearing, and electronic surveillance of passengers onboard will exist for the foreseeable future"". ""Making predictions about when the cruise industry will have recovered is incredibly difficult while the ships are not sailing yet. However, that it will take years before we see a recovery to pro-covid times seems to be about right"".""Passenger numbers in 2020 were expected to exceed the 29 million passengers that sailed in 2019 by several million. For now, projections made by Statista show that passenger numbers will likely not exceed 17 million passengers""."
Who is holding into earnings?
"just got back from a cruise. the fantasy is 30 years old and quite frankly doesnt have a whole lot of things to do. however, we had a blast and loved the staff. I will say that I wish carnival would just up the price of the cruise to pay their staff more as opposed to throwing in secret gratuities charges on the drink package and the cruise. the staff was amazing enough that we tipped them well with cash anyways."
Won't even think about selling till it gets in the $30s - $40s. This is just getting started.
Oh wait why is this going up?
You know what's up SHORTY McSHORTERTONS?CCL IS WHAT'S UP!!!!!!
CCL CLOSER TO SAILING!CLIA pushing the CDC to lift CSO.....with the vaccinations doses now over 215 million we are mere weeks away from sailing. Buy as much CCL as possible.....it’s on its way to $55 !
"I laugh at those soothsayers who predict CCL is heading down. WRONG.Now we have positive headwinds, vaccines, pent up demand for cruising.Just really good signs that CCL will do well. Some ups and downs but this stock , now in an increasing positive environment will not see a price below 19.00 again. Jg"
"BEARS/SHORTS are going to be absolutely DESTROYED when CCL begins sailing on June 27, 2020! CCL was due for some profit taking, and the move toward $25 will resume next week! Much greater chance of hitting $20 vs. $10. Texas, as well as many other states are reopening today and by the end of July (over two months), Cruisers will be cruising! For July cruises, they are only going to be at 50-75% capacity as a precaution. Cruises starting back in July is HUGE, and will catapult CCL above $20."
news out part of ccl is starting to cruise in August. This is a start first trial to see if people catch it again on the ship if it's clear we will sail more
Pent up demand? Last cruise (#27) was in February 2020. The wife and I have 10 booked Carnival cruises from August 2021-April 2023. I do own 100 Shares for the $ On Board Credits. Our Crew friends are getting notifications to travel and support the return to cruising in the USA. Both of us are vaccinated and ready to cruise! Wishing everyone the best of luck in the future with their investments.
"Come on Green, nearly there!"

Can we see $29 today?
What do you guys recommend? Buy more or hold what I have @$16. I think I can still make more profit even if I buy more.
Macquarie upgraded Carnival from Neutral to Outperform
Pre-market just opened up +5.40% is looking pretty positive. I was expecting a lot worse.
"We've waited this long, let's view it as 2022 to begin sailings. Any earlier would be a bonus. Vaccinations are occurring each day, we'll get there."
"when will more CDC guidance come? "" never predict regulatory timing """
Must be stupid to sell at this level. Buy here and hold.
Another good day for CCL!
Maybe it would break out soon.
"Carnival Corporation (NYSE: CCL) (NYSE: CUK) stock jumped 5% as of 12:30 p.m. EST Wednesday after the cruise operator announced that at least a couple of its cruise ships could soon be cruising again -- at least in Europe. Specifically, the cruise company said that the Costa Smeralda, flagship of Carnival's Italian subsidiary Costa Cruises, will begin making ""3- and 4-day mini-cruises"" and also ""a 7-day cruise, calling at Savona, La Spezia, Civitavecchia, Naples, Messina and Cagliari"" in Italy beginning March 27. On May 1, it will begin week-long cruises in the western Mediterranean, visiting Savona, Civitavecchia and Palermo in Italy, Marseille in France, and Barcelona and Palma de Mallorca in Spain."
"As per an NBC article posted at 4:41 PM today that I just viewed on Yahoo states in the last paragraph ...""The legislation also provides $100 billion to hospitals, $350 billion to small businesses , $500 billion to corporations including airlines AND CRUISE LINES, and about $150 billion for state and local stimulus funds"" I guess it doesn't get any plainer then that. Don't try to read anything into it."
"""Health officials say the #GrandPrincess cruise ship, which is currently being held for #Coronavirus testing in San Francisco, would not be able to dock in #SantaBarbara unless all passengers had been tested and cleared from a two-week incubation period."""
This is frustrating. Markets are at a record high and CCL is resumed their normal operations. Companies like DIS resumed operations and the stock jumped 20% over the course of a month when Florida claimed thousands of new COVID cases. This should've been at $25 by now.
what if Saudis drop the 350 million shares they bought for a quick profit?
I know it's still early and things can change but like I said in my post earlier today. I have them blocked so can someone let me know if @Harry Bawls or @Bill are shooting off their mouths today? Or are they nowhere to be found again on a green day.

It could also expire earlier, if the Secretary of Health and Human Services no longer declares the pandemic to be a public health emergency, or later, if the national public health institute modifies the order based on public health considerations."

"Thinking more about it, it also makes sense prices going down, I guess ""simulated cruises"" fell very low in expectation, that means Simulated sailings will drag and eat more time when cruise companies can't do REAL SAILS. My expectation was for REAL SAILS not ""simulated"" SAILS, those already happened time ago and failed, WHAT'S NEW on this CDC order?"
CCL is a bargain today! Won't see this low price again! The rocket ship is refueling today for the next LAUNCH!
"There are two kinds of traders: Those who are always looking to grab profit whenever they have it, and those who are patient and prefer to stay in a play that they think they are on the right side on, in order to maximize profit. Neither strategy is necessarily better than the other, just a different mindset. Personally, most of the time, I choose the route of patience. Sometimes it pays off, other times not. Right here, I choose patience and I am looking for CCL to break down further as the day progresses."

Make sure your out b4 the fed speaks 2pm

"This stock was over 70 pre-pandemic. Current price already reflects all the negative stuff. 25-26 is the bottom, for it to go lower a new pandemic of a new virus is needed, and history shows such pandemics are once a century event. Are you prepared to wait 100 years to cover your short? 50% capacity measure will certainly be temporary and will stop to be applied after most of the population is fully vaccinated. Also they can solve reduced capacity problem by raising prices. Nothing will stop this company to return to full profitability early next year and to start again making 5 billion a year in profits"
"Does it seem strange that everyone is saying the same thing: ""We view 2021 as a key inflection point for our industry as vaccine distribution accelerates and we work together across government and industry to help enable a robust recovery.""? Can you say ""Bubble""?"
Great recovery in the UK. Was initially expecting to be down 2% today after yesterday’s 5% gain especially with our budget announcement tomorrow. Upgrading and long term outlook is definitely giving investors a lot of confidence.

Then their is clear skies ahead to $29 and then to fill the gap at around $40. obviously isn't doing this all next week, but within a couple months we could be seeing the $40 mark. Things defiantly looking better around the world, so only matter of time I can get back cruising and enjoy a nice round the world cruise with my profits :)"
They won’t lose the lawsuit. Read the article. They did the best they could. How could the cruise line industry take the fall because they knew the virus was bad? Other non essential businesses stayed open as well. It’s not fair to blame only them. Even though they are a big corporation. They have bills to pay and mouths to feed. I will be shocked if they lose. The procedures they did while on the cruise when the virus broke out was correctly done to protocol standards.
Standing in long line at USPS. so many getting passports & talking about going on cruise
Buying opportunity coming!
"Guys, forgive me! I love the deep for i have been loading up since this morning. I will be waiting tomorrow should there is another dip. Ou ahhhhh lol"
"here comes the volume, sit back and watch...."
Airline bookings decelerate on COVID-19 concernsBut keep dreaming that people want to go cruising.
Bill is a shorter
1 year from now....”remember when the world had that pandemic and cruise lines had to shut down for 2 months and we bought those stocks for $8-10. Now they are back to there highs! Should we retire early or buy a lake house? “
This is how everyone on the tread is
if you got vaccine card then you should be allowed to get on boat..what else you gonna do..the let drunks on cruises..and they bigger problem
"Hi everyone, I am not de ramping her but I sold my holding today as Carnival contacted me earlier today and cancelled my cruise that I have booked with them in July and has pushed it back to September next year, due to travel restrictions. I still think this has a long bull run coming but I think it may take a hit in the short term. Please don't hate, I just thought it was worth sharing with you."

"Given the situation with the latest ships, it's obvious to any neutal observer that no ship will sail until a treatment or vaccine is available. They just can't do it."
Is it true that CCL stands for Covid Container Ltd?

"Carnival’s business may be hit the the short term but I’m looking at the technicals and they look good. P/E of 4xDividend yield of 13% (annual)The beta I would say is a bit high but it shouldn’t affect the long term stock price too much. Yes, the dividend may be at risk of being cut or eliminated due to the fact that business was hit quite hard but with Carnival’s payout ratio of 46% it’s dividend is well covered by earnings.And Carnival’s historical earnings growth is 16% which outperforms the industry and market average.With this in mind the stock seems to be undervalued. Sources*Simply Wall St.MarketWatchYahoo Finance Thanks for reading!"
"Carnival will not go bankrupt. I cruise all the time. I just received an offer yesterday for a discounted cruise. Carnival has a loyalty program. Also if you own 100 shares or more you get $100 on board credit each time you sail 6 days or longer. If you paid $10 per share for 100 shares and took 10 cruises you basically have got your shares for free. It’s a win, win situation."
"CCL will never see another profitable quarter. Ever. Cruise ships, like movie theaters and theme parks, are designed for guest density. How many people can they fit into a confined space was the question pre-pandemic. Post-pandemic safety will eat every dollar of their margin. One bad cruise this summer that generates headlines could destroy the entire industry.Debt service will be too overwhelming if margins aren’t high. 500mil burn rate each month."
There is a solid support at $12. Chance to load the shares. No BK concerns at all. Liquidity is fine. Balance sheet indicates the stock price is under value.
"Solid day and looking strong after hours, Thinking this might fly this week as FOMO sets in. Market wasn't even strong today. Well done Longs, Hope you have a nice sleepless night shorties :)Well done David on locking profits :) house money always fun to play with."

"Other than liquidity and wanting a quick buck in some other stock, why would someone not invest in CCl? Terrific future here."
"I've been holding this for almost a year, lets go!"
$32.50 is the equivalent of the pre-covid market cap. Only 20% below that. Still some room to run but it would be a bit irrational to run beyond that anytime soon.
"There goes the Motley Fool again on the same old valuation angle. Citing extra stock and some borrowings pointing to a valuation equal to CCL's historic value. Look, many Airlines (AAL, SAVE, United, LUV, and others and restaurants such as EAT, PLAY, CAKE, some gaming suchas MGM, PENN, BOYD are all issued extra stock and those stocks (except maybe AAL) are all well above (Usually at least 50%) above their historic highs. So why is CCL any different? Make you investments in CCL now and enjoy some great returns."
Wow I’m not gonna lie I just got hit shorting today
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday issued new guidance for domestic travel, saying people who are fully immunized against COVID-19 can travel in the U.S. and do not need to get tested or quarantine. Game Changer for Summer Cruising approval!"

Locked and loaded for the JNJ news. Good luck tomorrow gang!
Seems to just be a reaction NCLH offering. Just like all past offerings from every other offering from cruise lines.
It went up a little
DEEP RED SEA
Looks like some selling this am
I have been daytrading this since $11. Getting it right mostly and taking profits.But after the NCLH news and it dropping to $13 at end of the day I finally went long ..

Next months trading range in the 30's will be AWESOME! CCL to $42 by 6/1/21!
Trading halted. Just saw they cancelled all cruises for next 60 days.
Shorts ....... You feeling the HEAT?CCL = STRONG BUY!
Keep selling im buying
As I said.... It was already baked in.
The notes will be offered only to qualified institutional buyers outside the United States. The offering is expected to close on Feb. 16.**This raises the question why only to buyers outside the United States? Is it because no institution in the United States will risk more of their money on Carnival? It also raises the question what will happen if they fail to raise the money.....? Chapter 11...??
"Alright, guys. What's the deal with CCL. Is this a buy or not? I'm reading that the value of the company is about 5 times larger than what it's currently priced at. Grossly undervalued. Vaccines are rolling out yet this languishes. Also reading that BK is a possibility if they can't set sail by end of 2021, and YET... the stock remains at $20.00, which is not low. This probably should be around $12 right now."
is the shorting over now?
Expecting a big short squeeze today. Up over 5% today......
Amazing how this holds with all the pause extensions
Should see a nice pull back today
Just accumulate and be patient. Buy on dips. 12+ months from now you will see the results. Buy and relax

"Breaking NEWS: TEXAS just joined lawsuit against CDC! The lawsuit hearing is next week, 5/12/21. The CDC's test sailing guidance was a joke/unworkable & they won't give Royal or NCLH guidance on beginning the fully vaccine sailing option, they are dragging their feet! The CDC appears to be trying to inflict as much financial damage to industry as possible! The only hope is the judge!"
What a reversal! Payday tomorrow. 50k open interest of $30 calls..Very Bullish! Let’s see what happens tomorrow.Good Luck!

80% of the US population should be vaccinated by the middle of June. So why wouldn't the CDC allow cruise ships to sail in JULY? Especially if the Cruise Ship industry requires customers to be vaccinated? ah? ah?

Good NEWS .From UK and the test of the world cruise .In UK Ccl +8% .The adventure continued .
Lol who drove this up at the open? And based on what?...a vaccine that is still a year away from distribution at best...
hey i have a question if anyone could answer. i Bought shares in CCl when it was 14.15 i want to buy more shares now that it is up. do you think i should or stick to what i have?
"Institutions are accumulating since the legal outcome will most likely favor CCL! A Judge will find that the Facts & Science show cruise restart will be safe. The judge will see the evidence that the UK's, Europe's & Singapore's Health Agencies all approved the Cruise Line safety protocols and they are allowing cruises! Over 100,000 people have cruised on Royal during the pandemic and they only had 10 cases of covid on the ship! That is without the vaccine! Lift the CSO CDC!!!"

"Cruise lines not mentioned in 'CARES' Act, says Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley analyst Jamie Rollo said he found ""air carriers"" mentioned 50 times in the text of the ""Coronavirus Aid, Relief,and Economic Security Act"" or ""CARES"" Act that was just passed by the Senate, but he does not see a specific mention for the cruise industry, though there are provisions for other ""distressed sectors"" of the economy which may apply to cruise lines. However, Rollo also notes that the Act specifically defines aid as being for U.S. businesses and the cruise lines are incorporated abroad, with Carnival (CCL) incorporated in Panama, Royal Caribbean (RCL) in Liberia, Norwegian (NCLH) in Bermuda.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3060679"
They loss 4 billion and stocks are gaining. Does not make any sense. Complete speculative market
"I have cruised before and I’m cheap. Always bargain hunting when it comes to vacation/travel. I’m also not personally worried about contracting the virus as I’m young and fairly healthy.However, there is no way I’d be booking a cruise anytime soon, even if they were allowed and severely discounted. As I said, I’m not concerned about the virus’s impact on my own health. What I’d be extremely frightened of is the possibility of being quarantined in a 8x8 room for weeks. Being quarantined in my own home is bad enough. It would be a nightmare being quarantined on a cruise ship."
"I'm not very happy today, but still happy....."

"Went down with HUGE volume 12.2M in 30 minutes, NOT a good sign in short term."
"Some Noob goes on CNBC saying cruise lines fully booked in 2022. And another Noob saying that given fully booked he demands they raise prices. Those repeating this on this chat board are just lemmings. It is a UNTRUE! And do not take my word on it. Go to any Carnival ship - So go any sailing in 2022 - I 100% guarantee there is plenty of availability. This is easy to prove or disprove. I just went on site - a smorgasboard of availability for 2022. So obvious commentators spewing ""fully booked"" B.S. are just trying to pump the stock."
errrrr what?
Serious question here but if the new offered shares are at 8 on Monday why or how is this above that? Please no clown responses. Thanks
When can a person book a cruise with carnival??
"ouch, been trading it well and might have got caught today"
"I love the dividend don't get me wrong, but I do hope they cut it as a measure of staying afloat (pun totally intended) through this pandemic. I know CCL is sitting on a lot of cash so hopefully that will help them too. I'm not planning on selling my shares but I am going to wait awhile before buying more just in case this isn't the bottom."
"This season CDC estimates that, as of mid-March, between 29,000 and 59,000 have died due to influenza illnesses. Why are we shutting the world down for 1000 deaths??"

Get the facts and work out the math, It isn't hard.Keithlast month$CCL conversationfor you charts people, if you look 20.80 is a perfect gap fill, $22.42-$22.54.Could be reached very quickly, extremely bullish on strong opening today could see us move back to $25.Keith22 days ago$CCL conversationAnyone shorting this stock now shouldn't be trading. Potentially very little downside on this stock now, except for unforeseen circumstances, Its obvious now they will be cruising second half of this year, day trade all you want but don't open any shorts without very tight stop losses as any morning you could wake up to massive losses. $20.64 this crosses the 50 dma, which is a huge buy signal, I think we go past that tomorrow. I'm fully loaded with shares, and will add on any weak days. Good luck all, the worse is behind us."
The direction is up from here. Shorts who shorted around 30 will make a few pennies if they cover soon. The stock is not going to stay below 30 for long. Upgrades and good news will continue to come in.

"Carnival cannot cruise...but they can take on passengers in port and simulate a cruise. Carnival should approach the Governor about a temporary permit to have gambling on board. This is not unheard off and likely would save the local economies. If Hotels can stay open the Cruise ship should also. The boat would not cruise but would take on passengers who could, eat, sleep and gamble."
Anyone care to give their opinion as to why RCL was able to access capital at substantially better rates than CCL? Bashers and Pumpers need not answer!

Doing these dry runs for the next few months should dramatically increase their cash burn and cost of operations. Even once they do get running sailing with one quarter the normal passengers doesn't sound like a profitable situation if Biden wins you can stick a knife in them.
"Guys some of you compare CCL with airlines. Their business model is completely different. In cruises, there are casinos, restaurants even fitness centers.

My Fortune 50 company just ordered everyone back to the offices. Travel schedules resume in May. Travel budgets are being evaluated and likely bolstered in June. The world is rapidly returning to normal.
CCL was in financial trouble pre-covid. They have mountains of debt to deal with for the next 10 years or more. It's worth no more than $20 right now. The hype around resuming sailing is what keeping it from dipping to $20. Lots of navies will end up losing money here. You are dreaming about $30 and $40 when you should pray they don't announce chapter 11 at one point before year end.

"With the vaccination process on the move, we will see cruising at probably 60% of a ship’s maximum capacity. Every month let’s hope they increase the percent of of people on board. If so, we should see a burst of excitement in the stock that will run it up but then it will fall and stay steady for sometime because the debt carnival has accrued will weigh down the stock. This is my forecast."

i dont sell a single stock even if no cruises this year....
Take it from an ex top PVP. CCL is ready to go all hands on deck. As soon as the CDC gives clearance to cruise.... SHIPS will be sold out in days! PVP = personal vacation planner.10 years of sales I know how CCL does it.I am going all in.
@Issay Why do you keep posting the same thing over and over again?
Close over 29 is unavoidable today. R.I.P. all the shorts and their dreams...
Great news

Has anyone seen the crowds at the beaches in Florida ? People are ready to get out and travel. Social distancing isn’t even happening in most places. They appear to have taken the red pill 
"Wow of all chat boards I frequent, this one is the most polarized."
2030 sounds crazy for a return to normal for cruise lines. We have known them to be petri dishes for decades... (Norovirus anyone?) I bought Jan '23 calls a few months ago. I figure either bankrupt or back to normal in a few years so I levered up with calls instead of stock. I dont see this company going bankrupt. By the time they plan on cruising normally the vaccine will have made huge differences in the case count anyway. I was surprised it didnt spike to 30 yet but I have no plans on selling my calls. May add if we see 17 or 18.
Big .money long shares and long puts. Renaissance Capital et al
Insiders have been selling a lot of shares recently. Stock is currently overpriced. Many cruises have been cancelled and stock is way overpriced right now.
Think a little longer than 1 trading day. This stock will go up.
Better Cover ! Shorts

$36 next week!!Wait and see CCL = $$$Buy Buy and Buy!
Should go further tomorrow if the CEO Bloomberg interview gets reported (and it will).
Scroll down and take note of all the liars on this board who claimed that the CDC came out and said no sailing until Nov. 1. That is patently untrue. The CDC simply made a quick note over email that the Conditional Sailing Order remains in effect and the next phases are under review. I'm betting .5M that we are sailing much sooner than 11/1. Let's see who is right.
"Nasdaq is up 283 points (2.15%) and this one is down. Longs, please feel free to explain."
"Lets not forget part of their money for deposits is 2.2 billion. As we get deeper into the year and look towards 2022 demand for future bookings will grow. People make deposits on future bookings anywhere from 6-18 months in advance. Therefore, the deeper we get into the year and people place deposits they can operate and the need for refunds diminshes the further we get into 2021-2022 bookings."
"T - 20 MINUTES! $30, $30, $30....."
Ships could start sailing in April as opposed to a May 1 if the positivity numbers continue dropping. 
The CDC will literally be letting people DIE across the world to re-start cruising this year. do you seriously think they will let that happen?
"Carnival Corporation & Plc CCL was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rises more than 7% on the day. The move came on solid volume with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This reverses the recent trend for the company—as the stock is down roughly 76% in the past one-month time frame.The company has seen four negative estimate revisions in the past few weeks, while its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has also moved lower over the past few weeks, suggesting there may be trouble down the road. So make sure to keep an eye on this stock going forward, to see if this recent move higher can last.Carnival currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while its Earnings ESP is negative.Still on the sidelines. Think this goes much lower short term. Long term great buy at these levels. People will cruise again no doubt. Stay safe."
My friends I told you to sell let’s check in around 330
But Jeremy said I should buy it!!!
under 25 tomorrow...by Friday under 20....smart people are dumping this as bankruptcy grows stronger
"The CDC is asking us all to get vaccinated - and presumably when we hit ""herd immunity"" we are ""good to go"" (assuming no new variants). So, if everyone on a ship is vaccinated... what's the issue? How can it get any better? Likely, we will never achieve 100% vaccination in our communities... so being aboard a ship with everyone vaccinated may be the safest from COVID that we will ever be."
Do we see $30 today?
Dilution has not ended. They continue to release more shares. Company will be saved years from now at the expense of the shareholders. Only way it can be done

The scary thing about CCL is their debt load which is skyrocketing. If this continues and cruises aren't happening they could possibly turn to bankruptcy for help and to reorganize. Heaven Forbid! Something to keep in mind however.
25 on Friday. That's what I'm hoping for.
Next year in April CCL stock price is 45 $ minimal.So much money goes around this company. Never let them bankrupt

"Mom, how did grandpa make all his money?Well son, back in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, grandpa bought shares of carnival cruise line for $8 a share; even when everyone was telling him it would go bankrupt."
Back to 21 by March earnings!
It honestly makes me laugh that people post here that Carnival and airlines are going to go bankrupt over this 
CDC announcement will push the Judge to side with Cruise lines now

"What I like about Carnival is it's the wave of the future that has already come and you will see many many many millions of people riding the ships at very affordable prices so they can take a cruise now and then. We love everything about Carnival and other cruise lines as well. As a matter of fact I continue accumulating shares and then I do a write on calls, literally renting out my underlying shares for much higher prices than I paid and I'm making beaucoup rental income. for sure the pandemic has allowed me to accumulate a heck of a lot more shares at lower prices and my average cost is well below the shares originally bought. Frequent call-writes make us more than enough money to pay for cruises."
"will be loading to the ship on the way down, we will see short term decline but long term it will rise"
Added 200 shares on the dip 27.55

Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis already demanding the CDC lift the no-sail order for the US Cruise Ship Industry. Requests began being made back in October of last year. White House will also not allow the industry to be side-lined over red-tape.
Just read fully vaccinated can travel
Target price $42! Speed up to buy for low price
Cruise industry will suffer for some time. Lack of Confidence to customer safety will be a big issue for at least 6 months!
"I think some pivotal points here are 1st that Pfizer is already distributing a vaccine that is supposedly 95% effective. Second, there are 2 things that people are dying to resume, congregating & partying! A cruise ship is the epitome of this. Although the shares have been diluted, don't forget that the stock was undervalued before COVID. I'm in for 1100 shares."

The aggregate amount of shares of common stock to be issued in the offering was decreased to approximately $500 million from the previously announced $1.25 billion. The offering is expected to close on April 6, 2020, subject to customary closing conditions. The Corporation has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 9,375,000 of additional shares, which option must be exercised on or before May 1, 2020.

Is the CCL earnings report still coming out tomorrow?
Back in business soon!
I wouldn’t want to be short right now. The other morning it went up $1.50 on no news.Close above $30 easily. Wait until WSB gang hears about it.Good Luck today

Fast chance to get out sell sell sell
"Rep. Doris Matsui of California is one of 2 representatives trying to block cruise sailings. Fun fact, she's on the clean energy board. So this is a personal issue to her and all the cruise ship haters that financially support her. This has NOTHING to do with COVID.$CCL $RCL $NCLH"
bankruptcy is just about guaranteed...but keep paying $28 or higher for a $2 stock soon to be worthless in bankruptcy and wipe out all shareholders who will be left with nothing....
I didn’t own much but decided that this may go gown a lot more sharply than it is currently in premarket trading. I am out with a 2.5% for the day. The 1 billion stock dilution is about 7% of it’s current market cap. The loss of more assets and the miss on the overall operating loss is going to make today and the rest of the week very bad in my opinion. I would like to see the counter argument on this because I just can’t see how this is not terrible for CCL short term? I am considering a short now?
Hello Daniel did you educate yourself how the economic machine works and the stock market?
i heard the new age carnival investors are democrats and i thought only repbulicans invested in reopening plays.. sheesh. talk about being conservative and wise with your investment

"this time to break the bull flag bring to 34+, CCL"
There's a reason why I said it was expensive when they diluted 1 billion dollars worth at 25.10 and delayed all summer cruises. This thing goes down hard and people will come to the realization maybe after earnings report and see what they are actually holding.
this doesn't look like it will go up till after a vaccine announcement and possibly early 2021. but I think it will!
Which cruise line is larger...Carnival or Royal?
"Bought More....had to , I have that feeling that 60-70 is very strong possibility in the next 6 months!"

"Carnival upgraded to Buy from Hold at Argus sees 'strong' pent-up cruise demandArgus analyst John Staszak upgraded Carnival to Buy from Hold with a $33 price target. The analyst is citing the company's Q1 earnings guidance and a 90% sequential growth in advance bookings metric earlier this week, stating that the increase reflects strong pent-up demand for cruise vacations as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out and the impact of the pandemic diminishes. Staszak adds that Carnival should also benefit from the sale of 19 less fuel-efficient ships later this year."
Somebody gotta explain to me how this is happening lol. I’m short I’ll admit it and I’ll take a loss if need be but this is the most unreal thing I’ve seen in a while.
Christopher is wrong again 
Lookout! Michigan Governor released they need 60% vaccinated and the entire state will open. She stated this could be as early as NEXT WEEK!CDC will be FORCED TO LOST CSO!Load up on CCL...she heading to $65!
"The big risk here was the virus not being contained for 1+ year, and killing off 10% of population.However data shows that quarantines do work, and its containing the virus, (virus coming to a halt globally).We will be back to normal in few weeks. In few months you will remember at this golden days where could buy airlines and cruises for 80 % discount.Incredible."
"Do The Math:60 days ago 37M people had 1 dose at a rate of 700k a day. Today, 120M has 1 dose at a rate of over 4M a day. In 60 days the ENTIRE USA will be vaccinated. People are pent up and are booking cruises people. CCL is a GOLDMINE!!!Buy Buy Buy!"
this thing looks like all the growth stocks that just fell from the sky except its even worse....theres no growth!! and still no sailing. how is this going up and based on what?
"Futures turning red. Harry, this might be the luck you were asking for earlier."
"All news on street. Reported 1,3 b loss and selling 1b stock. If today shows strength after this ( don’t go down more than 4 pct) We can say we are out of the wood and short covering will be brutal in the next weeks..."

When the crash happens this will sink to the bottom fast
"DeSantis doesn't play around, the CDC will comply! $42 by May 1, 2021!"
they took on a lot of debt not sure what its worth but def some momentum coming into this now that we are actually vaccinated...sail orders are probably in striking distance
So glad I added more this morning!
Is it worth investing now?
"Welcome to the world's worst moderated forum. I definitely would not sell in the pre-market. The very prestigious Lancet journal is publishing the peer reviewed data from the AstraZeneca Phase 1 study on Monday. And congress has invited 5 Vaccine makers to a sub-committee on Tuesday to give a status report on their development, validation and production plans.If these two events don't result in some form of a short squeeze, then I would think about selling."
CCL is buying 3 million of the 15 minutes test kit ...
"A further good sign for Carnival.... I have a cruise booked with them in July and we had to call to sort out our cabin and packages, it took us 2 days to get through and the two people we spoke to said their phones are off the hook, they cant fill the ships quick enough bookings all the way to 2022 and they are working around the clock to bring the boats back into service...... Plus zero discounts on anything, which can only mean a good future for the share price. The recent jump has already covered the cost of my Cruise and this has plenty more room to run."
A vaccine will be approved In the next few weeks. Get on board now
Carnival returning trip costs and purchases and then hotel room and airfare home for everyone. Net is a triple loss of revenue.

"I usually do the opposite as these true fools suggest.""As June Cruise Cancellations Begin, Carnival Risks Losing This $390 Million Business""Rich DupreyMar 17, 2021 at 11:41AMAs cruise ship operators begin canceling their June voyages, Carnival (NYSE:CCL)(NYSE:CUK) risks losing a particularly lucrative piece of business. It announced its voyages to Alaska on ships from its Holland America and Princess brands that were scheduled through the end of June have now been canceled.The Alaska cruise season runs from May through September, but July and August are considered its peak. And though that particular itinerary is only a small part of Carnival's total revenue, generating just $390 million in 2019 through its Holland America hotel and transportation business, it and the rest of the industry are on the cusp of missing out on a crucial near-term revenue source."""
CDC.... Cruises to start back this July. 
Ccl could use the newly approved saliva test .. test outside boarding as you arrive .. and sail ... same test pro sport is going to use .. $4 test .. ccl should be over $20 by oct ...
"Settle down everyone. We all know that top number of covid-19 cases will only climb as long as there is testing. You have to work the numbers. Everyone seems to be a stock expert but only a few can manage the virus numbers. We only have 4.9 million currently infected in the US. That number is 0.015% of the population. Death rate is 0.019% of those infected. If you really want to be blown away - do some research as to what the chances are for developing cancer, Heart Disease, Stroke, MS, Alzheimer's, listeria, botulism. Now those are some scary numbers. Relax, have faith, practice common sense. We will get through this."
Down trend will continue for the next few weeks I’m really think in we can break 24

"Buy and hold, buy when others fear, the stock market isn’t meant for everyone, patience is a virtue."
"So let me get this straight... Analysts have ccl losing money all through 2021, carnival sold $1.5b of shares around 20, and chairman just sold I believe $100,000,000 of shares and cruising just got pushed back another month. Yet today is the day you choose to rally, No, due to stimulus talks Market is rallying as a whole, and to investors that haven't been keeping up they still see CCL as an undervalued stock, but it's not anymore, even with 2021 factored in its overvalued, look at eps estimates. Vaccine not rolling out till spring/summer for the avg person, people acting like we are all getting immunized in 2 weeks.Yes, in 2-3 years you'll probably see a return. But there as so many stocks that are better investments if that's your strategy.Ccl has been in business since the 70s, they more than doubled debt in less than 1 year, while losing ships. Not to mention less leverage due to lower stock price and higher than their usual interest rates.And less time I checked cruises aren't an essential service, airlines will probably do much better with stimulus/bailout."
$30 right now but while you can do cheap
Like I said this is going to be cut in half
"A penny Stock selling at 19, sell short"
July 4 resumption of sailings are looking highly likely! $42 by May!
Excellent buying opportunity and healthy consolidation today! It's preparing for the RIP higher to $35! CDC test sailing approval imminent! SHORTS better cover!
"It must be nice that whenever a cruise company needs cash, they just print more money by selling stocks based on hopes & dreams of sailing, while they're actually sinking! I wish I can do the same to support my family...."
Cramer and other analysts unanimously say to sell Cruise line stocks.... buy Amazon instead if u want to make money... if you like the stock for other than monetary reasons than buy CCL from those who are selling it...
Sell all and come back later

"Ouch. Good chance the ""no-sail"" order is put back in place (per USA Today posted Friday):Members of Congress are calling for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reinstate its ""no-sail"" order, which expired at the end of October and was replaced by a ""Conditional Sailing Order"" that allows a phased-in return to cruising.""The CDC is putting American lives at risk, not to mention the potential for enhancing the spread worldwide,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, told USA TODAY Friday.Blumenthal and Rep. Doris Matsui, a Democrat from California, who are co-sponsors of the proposed Cruise Passenger Protection Act, made the request for reinstatement in a letter to CDC Director Robert Redfield.The letter came after a cluster of COVID-19 cases emerged on SeaDream Yacht Club's SeaDream I, which is currently docked in Barbados after having to cut its first Caribbean voyage short due to the outbreak. “These multiple cases are only the first sign of a looming public health disaster,"" Blumenthal said.“In light of these disturbing reports, we feel strongly that you should reverse course on the recent decision by the (CDC) to take a phased approach to restarting cruise line operations in the United States,” Blumenthal and Matsui wrote. “Instead, we implore you to extend the prior no-sail order until a time when the health and safety of passengers and crew can be assured.”They pointed out in the letter that in spite of the cruise line's efforts to sail safely, including aggressive testing, social distancing, mask wearing requirements and more, the precautions weren't enough to stop the coronavirus from infecting at least seven passengers on board the SeaDream.""According to the CDC’s own no-sail order, '[c]ruise ships continue to be an unsafe environment with close quarters where the disease spreads easily and is not readily detected,'"" the letter continues. ""In fact, cruise ships were breeding grounds for the virus at the epicenter of the initial COVID-19 outbreak. With the images of passengers and crew stranded aboard the Grand Princess still fresh in our minds, it is imperative that we learn from the past and take immediate action to prevent history from repeating itself.""The Grand Princess was one of two Princess Cruises ships that experienced an early outbreak of COVID-19, forcing passengers to quarantine during the pandemic's onset in the beginning of March.The letter Blumenthal and Matsui sent to the CDC Friday isn't the only one the agency has received from Congress.In September, before extending its order until Oct. 31, the CDC requested that the ""no-sail"" order be extended to Feb. 15, 2021, but compromised with the White House Task Force to extend it only until Oct. 31, four days before the Nov. 3 election, a person familiar with the situation but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY at the time.As a result, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, a Democrat from New York who chairs the House subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, has made an official request for records from the CDC. The request came amid circulating allegations that President Donald Trump's administration intervened when the CDC proposed that its ""no-sail"" order, banning cruise ships carrying more than 250 passengers from sailing in U.S. waters be extended into February amid coronavirus pandemic uncertainty.Blumenthal and Matsui acknowledged that the ""Conditional Sailing Order"" listed out a ""seemingly robust and phased approach to restarting cruise line operations"" but said they have concerns that cruising is ""simply unsafe during a global pandemic,"" especially as cases continue to rise across the country, which had seen more than 10.6 million cases and nearly 243,000 deaths by Friday afternoon according to Johns Hopkins data.The conditional order ""lacks efficient specificity and rigor,"" Blumenthal said, noting that in order for cruising to restart, he believes there needs to be ""a much reduced incidence of the disease,"" ""very stiff guidelines and restrictions on the number of people on board"" and ""routine testing."" But most of all, he said, the pandemic ""as we know it now"" must end before cruise ships can safely sail.The cruise industry made the call earlier this month to extend its own voluntary pause on operations until 2021. By pushing sailing off until the new year, they will have more time to prepare and align industry protocols with standards in the CDC's new order, which includes test sailings, among other requirements to be completed, before passenger cruises can resume.In the letter, Blumenthal and Matsui requested a response from Redfield no later than Nov. 27.""We’ll see massive outbreaks on cruise ships, which will become floating hot spots with major casualties."

not a bad price to load.
the low is in..great day
I'm betting on CCL again. Please don't do me wrong. Still think tech sector is going to take a hit again...
"@ all the people saying “sell before 2pm announcement” “it’s gonna drop”. So you’re saying, sell your WHOLE position for a *possible* short term dip that could happen from an announcement about a new tax plan that takes place NEXT year. Smart. Emotional investing to the max"
How long can shorts keep the price below $30? They are not wise going against the tide.
warren buffett confirmed he is purchasing 30million of share this week

"Double bottom for today is in. Now let's enjoy the ride back to 27, 28, 29 and beyond. ""Be greedy when others are fearful""."

"US SUMMER CRUISING is ON!""Royal Caribbean said that the reason for the cancellations was due to the likelihood of cruises resuming from U.S. ports this summer. U.S. travelers are showing a preference for more direct access to ports of departure."""
same period sales up 200% compared to last yr.....we'll be back over $20 per share this week....or higher. major short squeeze coming
1000 shares short at $26.75.
"I bought 5k shares @ 16.50 this is the best investment I’ve made in a long time, why you ask. Well not because of facts or truths. Nope, I bought because people on here said it would go up and my feeling of course."
I smell GREEN as low volume picks up.Always do the opposite of Seeking Alpha.
Everyone sell now buy back next week all charts indicate that this will go down too 25 -24.20
CCL is a great company I have been using their cruises for years and I love every experience I ve had with them. They have enough cash and now that cruises have started again I think it will gradually get back to 30+ and then 60+. Also there will be less competition for them now that most of the small cruise companies went BK sadly. I have almost 50k worth of shares I'll make it 100k once I am convinced that the vaccine will be ready this year. I hope it won't increase much until that time.
"Guess there is no way at all it goes back to 12, right?"
"Cruise lines would only get loans, no equity stake like the airlines.They would only get loans.Emergency loans could equate to more than $4 trillion in lending power through the leverage of the Federal Reserve, administration officials have said. Because airlines are the only businesses to get direct payments, as a result of their dire financial situation, those payments come with conditions including warrant provisions."
"This stock had zero reason to rally yesterday. We're going to see a pull back correction today. Let's also be realistic in the fact that cruises aren't happening this year. People don't want to be stuck in a dirty COVID ship or hotel, because you're forced to quarantine in both if either have cases. An airline you can still get off. I'm sitting at $29 a share and sold enough to pay for my initial investment at $50. May liquidate soon and buy low again. $RCL $CCL very bearish this year. These are just emotional stock rallies, no logic."
Buy and hold.
It doesn’t do a 8% swing down on no news or good news folks
CCL IS HEADED TO $35!
I sense that most Americans do not understand how fast vaccines will ramp up. Moderna will be adding 50% more doses per vial. Pfizer output increasing to $14m per week (that's 2m doses per day and we are currently only jabbing 1.5M per day with Pfizer and Moderna combined). By the end of April at least 24m Americans will be fully vaccinated by the JnJ vaccine. That alone is 10% of our population over 18. Despite the Government's conservative timelines you can expect to have at least your first shot within the next two months. No problem cruising by late spring/early summer.
I loved all the people saying timber yesterday at the close! Who knew trees fall upward 
Advice to my short friends: cover now and go long.
Great day today.
bought on monday when the pfizer vaccine news came out. Now staring at losses. Should i hold or sell ? is ccl a good stock for long term or will it sink in debt ?
Well finally bit the bullet and got out with a minor loss decided better to book a loss of under 5% and reinvest it in something with better long term options. I honestly don’t see major uplift here for a long time. Assuming a vaccine arrives next month actually how many will take it and it be a while before it given to general population. Also with Christmas just around the corner going to be huge party season and early to mid January the virus going to come back worse than ever. I don’t know if carnival can survive into early part of next year hence why I jumped ship now excuse the pun. Better options out there. Sometimes u gotta know when to hold them and more importantly when to fold them anyway just my thoughts not advice
I think Carnival should take their ships to Panama and tell the CDC to pound sand.
Buy this next week after the earnings. Will be cheaper.
"keep talking taxes, let the economy tank and let the midterms decide"
The cdc has no choice but allowing ccl to sail this summer. My state will vaccinate everybody next month.
"have you noticed every time CCL gets a little boost, there comes another stock offering?"
Carnival is looking for some of that corporate welfare because the U.S. will not let them off loadpeople with the covid anymore.

Airline guy on cnbc saying he doesn't expect full capacity in airlines until late 2021. I wonder if the same will be for cruises.
Worse than expected revenue and earnings report and CCL is...up? Help me understand why please.
"Can someone tell me how this corporation can survive with virtually no cash flow? It will be at the least, another year before passenger confidence is restored. I have shares in CCL and am pleased (and shocked) with the recent uptick."
ready to sail cdc start the count
CCL will take off on Monday!! J/J helped make a game changer for re-setting cruise dates back to May 2021. We will see cruise stocks continue an upward move along with other travel stocks. The bumpy ride is about OVER! jg
"In a couple of weeks when a vaccine is approved, ccl will be above $20."
"The next Leg Up for CCL ($30-40 Range) begins next week! The CDC folded due to pressure and will allow cruising! CCL will begin making MUCHO $$$$$ this SUMMER! BOOKINGS up 200%! CCL is going to have the competitive advantage, they won't require vaccines like Royal & NCLH. They will begin test sailing next month, and cruising this summer with children and adults!"
"folks, Oprah is not helping the company, she's hurting the company."

Looks like we are clearing the sub $29 resistance. Barring unforeseen cash burn in the report tomorrow we should see smooth sailing to $35.
In Italy already sailing.....In Spain also ready to start again cruising...
"Shorts, Hedge your Bets with those $30 April 16 Calls. The cdc announcement @David keeps referring to could cause the FOMO to jump both feet.Be careful shorts!Stay frosty"
Bear Trap... Too much $$$$ on those $30 calls to not try to get close to strike price.Ohh.. @David @Aka Bazzilonaire can suck it.Good Luck!
$23 at closing today. See you!
Serious stuff now. If this holds at $8 it could go to $10. The resistance is at about $14 where it failed at last time 21 day moving average. If it closes below $8 in the next few days you will see this going lower. $8 Is a pivotal point of this stock.Good luck with whatever you chose. 
"sell it now, booking means nothing.... booking doesn't give your money"
I am averaging down because I know the road ahead is clear for #$%$ will sail this summer and make a lot of money.
"Batches Covid19 vaccine breakthroughs changed investor mindsets, market heading back to 6/8/20 peak, All aboard!"
CCL is down almost 3% now in the London exchange
do you guys really think this thing is gonna survive even with the vaccine we are still going to have to wait till everyone is vaccinated who knows how long that would be even if thay are aloud to operate you still gotta worry about outbreaks on the ship i think covid still has another 6 months to go ccl is done the same money you expect to make money here in any way it should be in PUTS
Merger any day now. Way undervalued.
At 4.5M doses a day there will be 270M more vaccines distributed in 60 days setting up July for the entire USA to be vaccinated! Use this forecast and BUY BUY BUY.... Those who can see what is about to happen with CCL will be SWIMMING IN CASH!
"I repeat, ""the pandemic has no end in sight."""

"Today was a taste of what's to come for the next 6-8 months. There will be some ups and downs while people make some quick cash for a few months but overall, plan on a steady downward trend until there is a vaccine. Plain and simple."

Shares being bought are from shorts getting ready to drop this huge and keep it down through selling shares etc etc Don’t fall for it
Loading up more in the $10s
Why is this down pre market?
"well, that didn't last long!"
"This is my opinion.. I am long on this stock but I didn't like that they offered $1 billion in common stock. Of course this will hurt the share price as more common stock is poured into the market. It's not a good feeling knowing that it went up near $17 to drop back down to $15.31. I do like that they are working towards a nominal cash burn rate and they have started cruising in Europe further lowering the cash burn. I know CDC and Trump administration is probably at odds with each other about the coronavirus guidelines and everybody does not know how to go about deregulating the restrictions. CDC wants to probably maintain strict guidelines while the Trump administration wants them to lift them. CDC doesn't want to take responsibility if there are any deaths associated with lifting the restriction and Trump would be more keen to lifting the restrictions because he doesn't mind getting attacked by the media. CDC would probably be willing to lift the order if the Trump administration took full responsibility for lifting the restriction but also they probably feel it would be irresponsible just to take their hands off when it could lead to death. I personally don't think the CDC gives a hoot but they have to ""care"" or they will get crucified. Government workers are lazy I know because I work with them on a daily basis. I have seen the worldometer data and I truly believe the virus poses no threat. This is why I invest in Carnival. However, depending on who you talk to they will have different opinions. The difficult part is having people feel comfortable with the virus. Especially with all the fear mongering going on in the media and when you deal with death it gets extremely sensitive. Even when it impacts just a small portion of our population because everyone knows someone who is elderly and has a comorbidity. CDC also reported only 6% of people actually only died from just the coronavirus while 94% infected with covid had comorbidities and died. I am wondering of those 94% with comorbidities if they had other symptoms that could have elevated their co-morbidities like stress, depression, flu, etc. Anyways cost cruises returned to Genoa today and that is welcome news for Carnival. Any sailing news is welcome news as it will help keep lowering to a nominal cash burn rate. I'll continue to stay long but just that $1billion common stock news really really sucked because we were on an upwards trajectory til then. I hope their is no more borrowing and more common stock issuance."
This is going to continue to drop. But long term I am buying in over the drop. This will recover 2-5 years out nicely. Collect those DIVS while I wait.
I thought this would come down more but I was wrong. I will get it in the morning.
I told you Shorty....Hurry and BUY before it hits $65
the cruise lines are doomed. There is no end to be seen on the pandemic. No one wants to die and be quarantined on-board.

"From InvestorPlace 2 days ago...........I think this just about sums it up.....""The easiest way to see this at Carnival is to look at the company’s bond offerings. Regardless of what the stock market is doing from day-to-day, a company’s credit tends to be more steady. Generally, you have institutions as the primary buyers for corporate debt, and they are pickier in terms of the things they are willing to back.Carnival’s improving financial outlook can be seen by comparing its various bond offerings. Back in April, Carnival had to pay an exorbitant 12% interest rate on its new bond issuance to get access to much-needed cash. In July, Carnival raised another big chunk of money at a slightly less punitive 11% interest rate.This past week, Carnival announced another bond offering, which seeks to bring in roughly $2 billion. Analysts see the deal getting done at an 8% interest rate. That’s way better than the levels Carnival raised its debt at earlier this year, and it also beats the 9% range that folks had expected from this latest offering. With demand for this latest offering come in strong, however, Carnival will be able to issue more bonds than initially expected and at better interest rates as well. That’s good news all around.Carnival Stock VerdictThis speaks to the broader point: Carnival is no longer at high risk of failure. Now investors are just assessing how long it will take for things to start getting back to normal. The latest spike in virus cases and subsequent CDC warning are a short-term negative. However, the worst-case scenarios are off the table thanks to the company’s successful fundraising efforts.Importantly, Carnival has been much more successful in its efforts than some of the other listed cruise lines. As a result, Carnival should be able to do alright even if cruises are prohibited again in the short-term."""
"As long as Bree has not reached her brokerage margin limits for buying shares, Carnival will float slowly down the river, but once she reaches her buying limit, then Carnival will go over a waterfall. All of you should be thanking Bree for being so generous with her credit."
276 Covid deaths reported yesterday. That's the lowest since the start of the pandemic a year ago. There is reason for optimism. When the CDC sees how much the virus has been suppressed now that most of the at risk population is immune they will adjust regulations. If the trend continues the CDC will make an announcement this week.
bought a 17.5 dollar put on friday. and I'm negative today can someone explain this?
last day to load up before the boat set sail to the moon!
"Wowwwww Trading volume 27M in one hour, with an upside! 35 this week."
"Simple explanation. People still not comfortable buying around the $28-$30 region. Again being bought up from the 50 DMA as it always is, which is a great trading range to buy/sell. No abundance of sellers as yesterday told us, bad market day and again didn't do daily average volume. We just need a reason for people to step up and buy within the $28-$30 range. Until then we will keep seeing this pattern. Good Luck Longs :)"
"Passengers on Cruise ShipsU.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship. CDC notes increased risk of infection of COVID-19 in a cruise ship environment. In order to curb the spread of COVID-19, many countries have implemented strict screening procedures that have denied port entry rights to ships and prevented passengers from disembarking. In some cases, local authorities have permitted disembarkation but subjected passengers to local quarantine procedures. While the U.S. government has evacuated some cruise ship passengers in recent weeks, repatriation flights should not be relied upon as an option for U.S. citizens under the potential risk of quarantine by local authorities. This is a fluid situation. CDC notes that older adults and travelers with underlying health issues should avoid situations that put them at increased risk for more severe disease. This entails avoiding crowded places, avoiding non-essential travel such as long plane trips, and especially avoiding embarking on cruise ships. Passengers with plans to travel by cruise ship should contact their cruise line companies directly for further information and continue to monitor the Travel.state.gov website and see the latest information from the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/cruise/index.html."
"Looks like someone posted old CDC protocol guideline to scare and crash the CCL stock, but the CDC basically saying that, there was the October 2020 guidance still intact, and is in review, observing the Covid 19 situation. It will take few more days/weeks to get updated guideline. We have better chance to get some good news, since CLIA is requesting for sailing permission by July, maybe with vaccinated customers only condition."
Up nearly 5% after hours. This might explode tomorrow. Still need to break that ema line at $13.61

"Looks like everyone forgot how many times CCL issued new shares and loaded with debt. I just sold all shares, waiting for pullback to jump back in"
"I've watched CCL since it hit $8. When Saudi Arabia backed it, it hasnt gone below $12 since the end of April. I think 13.50 to 13.75 would be a good entry point right now. Selling 12.50 to $13 puts is enticing as well. I've made about $6k selling options on CCL (woulda, should, coulda made more) and have made mistakes along the way and let emotions get the best of me. If you are a short-term trader, this one pops on any positive covid news, labor market upticks, etc. In my personal opinion, CCL was only this low 20+ years ago. At least, it's been a very long long time. People love cruises and I've had really good memorable experiences with Carnival. I think 20-25 is a good price target within 6 to 18 months 30 to 35 in 2 to 4 years. Hopefully, they can start paying dividends again at some point."
To the Blind Optimism Analyst: You say the increase is baked/priced in. What are you going to tell the buyers when this is going to pop tomorrow morning? Don't pop because it is baked/priced in and I have a long term bear plan? You are following logic but market does not necessarily do that and you walk a very thin line between seeing your bear plan come to fruition or this stock never looking back. I don't understand why you resist the trend?
"Well, with the market up pretty good, and CCL down, it appears folks are finally looking at the realities of this stock for the rest of this year at least..."
We’ve seen this before. It always bounces back in the afternoon and the following day. I’m not letting go of anything until CCL is in the $42 range.

CCL is sailing in 2021!215 million doses given to date. By June 1st ENTIRE USA will be ready for cruising. CDC can’t hold CSO for much longer. CCL IS A STRONG BUY!!!!!
So there are going to be new screening protocols for the cruise lines. So I wonder how that is going to work when the ships come into ports during the cruises?

This will happen sooner than you may imagine."
WOW! LOOK AT ALL THE ANGRY SHORT POST TODAY! MAYBE I SHOULD ADD!SLEEP GOOD TONIGHT. LOL.
Poor ole sleepy joe. His own media made him look like a fool today with those questions.
I thought this thing was going to hit $28 today but we seem to have hit a wall. Any thoughts? Is this as high as it gets today or will it go to the moon?
Can’t wait until this meme stocks ( amc/gme/etc) war ends. It’s bashing so many good stocks.
"this was from hrs ago7:49 am: Ten passengers on Princess Cruises test positive""We were notified that amongst the samples that have completed testing, 10 people have tested positive for Coronavirus,"" Princess Cruises said in a Tuesday statement after the first phase of health screening for guests and crew onboard the Diamond Princess.There are more than 3,700 people onboard, and about half of the 2,666 guests are from Japan, the cruise liner said."
"So if the FDA approved Abbott rapid test, the goverment will approve companies like cruise lines/ airlines and more to use rapid test and back to normal with sailing and flying?"
"Just for fun, let's assume that the U.S. as of tomorrow will allow Carnival to cruise to Alaska this summer.""On May 12, it was reported that Carnival had canceled nearly all of its Carnival Cruise Line voyages through July 30.""How long will it take Carnival to assemble a crew and get a ship ready to sail? How will CCL find passengers on a short notice of 60 days or less? Possibly, Carnival could sail to Alaska from Mid-August to Mid-Sept. Likely, not worth the cost. Carnival will skip Alaska for this summer. However, the politicians from Washington and California will win some brownie points for passing the legislation."
Whats the point selling now? It will be back over 29 in a couple of days
"If volume goes up and price goes a cent down, the Rip Cord. I’m just waiting for a new buy point."
Pure opportunity! Carnival has enough liquidity runway to last until the end of 2021 under a no-revenue scenario.
If CCL closes in the $18s its s win for longs.
"Well past time cruising should have started back up in the US. Covid's numbers are pumped up, people in car accidents and such being labeled as covid...about like the last election, a complete sham."
One thing is for certain. When this BS is over - people are going to go on LOTS of vacations. Cruises will be a booming market in a very short period of time.
"........new Carnival filing just received concerning earnings, goodwill impairment charges and 1st quarter 2021 bookings which look pretty good to me.......sure could have been a lot worse......https://www.carnivalcorp.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0000815097-20-000007"
Y'all can't be surprised by the pullback. Cruise and airlines took on massive debt that needs to be repaid and plays into fair market valuations.
"Between closed ports and passenger fear, cruise books will be down even more than CCL is anticipating. Then there are the short traders... this stock is gonna drop"
The industry has some unexpected gains while the airline industry has been going the wrong way lately. I expected the airlines to go up before cruises because no line is allowed to sail yet and the daily number of flight passengers is steadily increasing each day. That’s a very good sign. We may have seen the last of the bottom.
1 year from now this will be a distant memory... maybe 1-3 quarters will be affected.. short term problems bring opportunities for long term investor's
"I can understand a government bailout of airlines as they would still be necessary for travel, but cruise companies? Cruises are a luxury and serve no purpose besides entertainment.What's next, govt bailout for casinos and movie theaters?"
Enjoy your little laugh shorty! CCL will be $65 2021 guaranteed!
Good news. And it’s also time to put a halt to the share price manipulation.
I tried to save the longs. Hate to see people lose money. Go elsewhere. Watch this settle down below 10 in the short term then around 5ish for months. Best case
Cost basis for most investors was dramatically reduced in the last few days. Yesterday alone half the outstanding shares traded at a little over $8. This is why it was most likely a low and maybe a double bottom. Time will tell but for anyone that is still bearish where do the new sellers come from when the stock ended basically flat to the open when 255 million shares were sold? I am long as of yesterday and looking for a substantial pop in price as I believe anyone wanting to sell did it the last 3 days. I have a stop under $7.50 but don’t think we will get there.
no profits for the next 3 years....debt will crush it
Seems like all of Harry Bawls hard work didn’t get the results he was looking for. 10 accounts dedicated to trying to create the big short and it just keeps going up. I’m so sorry.
@Ralph.....Let us know when you get that $1300.00 check. :-)
"@Andy....In case you missed this same message I put on one of your earlier posts....I'll make you a bet. You said CCL will hit $8 on Monday. I'll bet you that it doesn't. Here's the deal. If the share price hits $8 on Monday (Monday 10/26/2020) I'll quit posting on this board. If it doesn't hit $8 than, you quit posting on this board. Oh, and by the way, neither one of us can come back to this board under a different I.D. How about Andy, do we have a bet?"
Cruise stocks are continuing to climb! CCL looking at 25 soon.
Sold my shares at 30. Still believe we go way higher but I have a load of April 30 long calls so let's March this to 35 before next Friday.
"But...but...but...last month or so, during earnings call, they said they have plenty of cash to stay afloat for at least a year. And then...and then...and then....they borrowed another $600 million....$600 million.... $600 million....last week. So...so....so... why do they need more money?

"Thx to Doug @ Jayne from CCL's recent report:""The Corporation also believes the effects of COVID-19 on the shipyards where its ships are under construction, will RESULT IN A DELAY IN SHIP DELIVERIES""Moreover:""This included $3.0 billion of immediate liquidity plus $2.8 billion fromfour committed export credit facilities that are available to fund the originally planned ship deliveries for the remainder of this year and $5.9 billion fromcommitted export credit facilities that are available to fund ship deliveries originally planned in 2021 and beyond.""It aint hard to tell that CCL is aiming to use >$5 billions from preliminary orders to get over crisis..If netto loss of 1st quarter is $0.78 billion, CCL can surive w/o any help from government approximately 6.4 quarters, almost 1.5 years....LONG"
"Confronting these challenges has been difficult, forcing cruise operators to go numerous times to the well of debt and equity sales to stay afloat. Carnival just announced its fifth bond sale in the past year, this one for $600 million. It last raised about $2 billion in November.**Think about it. Less than 3 months ago they raised about $2 billion. Last month they assured everyone that they have enough money to stay afloat for a whole year. Why do they need $600 million if they have enough money to stay afloat for a whole year? Do they have enough money to stay afloat or not?"
"So where are all of those that said they were going to buy at $5,4,3,2. And the ones that said Bk?? Did they stay on the side of the road waiting or did they jump on the wagon? If ur not on the train is leaving!!!!!"
Kiss the Dividend goodbyeBest case scenario cut 50%
A quick pump and dump. It is shying away from $30. See you at $23 at closing.
@Harry Bawls How are you feeling this morning?
It won't be a good day. Australia CCL ships cancelled through May&June. US CCL ships disappeared from their booking engine at midnight. I am a Carnival cruiser and can't wait for the return to cruising. It's just going to need a little more time.

"A company does not file bankruptcy when their cash hits zero. It files several months in advance of that. This is because they must have significant cash on hand to continue basic maintenance ops through the bankruptcy process, pay all the banks, pay legal firms, etc. My estimate is a CCL bankruptcy in Dec or Jan. It really is a ticking timebomb though and could happen at any time."
"Read an article on TD Ameritrade today that the prime minister of Canada was "" bullish"" on vaccines. That by June 1 everyone would have at least one vaccine shot. Do not be surprised if he succumbs to pressure from Alaskan Officials and US Officials that he allows cruise lines to stop and refuel without passengers disembarking. It seems to cruise to Alaska it's a rule/ procedure to stop to refuel along the way."

Most people that ride on Carnival are from poor Red states that believes Covid is a hoax. This stock will have a full recovery
One big thing that keeps me long on CCL is my friend who loves cruises was upset when they cancelled his cruise last month. He said he didn’t care about the dangers. (This was after people had started dying.) (Most) cruisers will ALWAYS cruise. My guess is that the people posting negative posts either didn’t like a cruise they took or have never been on one.
CCL seems definitely rebound.Today I will buy futher more.
CCL will be there for you =$$$ STRONG BUY!
"Carnival Option Alert: Jan, 2022 $75 Calls/ That would be 6x where were at! Dream Big and Live Large! Life is to short!"
Feels like mm's are swapping positions. Once over expect this to sail much higher.
"Funny to read all the doom and gloom comments from the shorts: Carnival has 9 billion in available liquidity, there is no need to do another stock offering right now and there's no risk of bankruptcy. They'll be fully operational at the end of the 3rd quarter and profitable in the 4th quarter. Do you think investors will wait until then to buy the stock? No, it will reach 40 before the end of the year, and today will be the last day you see it below 26"
We should see Ccl trading lower Tom I would say 25.20
"If the CDC lifts the CSO, CCL will have a MAJOR advantage over Royal & NCLH. Desantis won't allow companies in FL to mandate a vaccine and Royal & NCLH are, CCL is not! BOOM!"

"""When a company’s management knows it must report bad news, delaying the report can give the company more time to give management time to spin the lackluster numbers and/or prepare a plan for the future that might help mitigate the market damage. Delaying an earnings report can also give the company a few more weeks to collect data to potentially find some signs the current quarter is off to a better start than the previous one"".Carnival keeps delaying earnings. It seems that they can`t find anything to sweeten the bad news so they keep delaying...."
"I'd say it is good news if the CDC doesn't respond to NCL's resail request today; it would mean they are actually reviewing it and considering it! Previously, they have immediately shot down any resail request! I don't see how the CDC can reject NCL's plan, it is solid and cruising would be the safest leisure activity available (listen to their CEO on Mad Money, great plan)! If NCL's plan is approved, CCL should temporarily copy it, even if non-vaccinated are excluded, they need REVENUE!"
Can you buy mow for $11.85? I know after hours show higher but if I make an attempt to buy it says $11.85. Thanks whoever has information.
Come on Carnival $30 today! We are to travel!
I own 8500 shares of CCL - I'm not selling a single one.

I just joined and I bought 1K. This is the deepest price you can get. The entire market is down but next week this will fly over 15.
Hard to believe this was at $51 on Jan 17 ! Things will turn around! Just be patient !
lots of pain tomorrow
A dollar here or a dollar there does not matte this will recover. The main thing is to be invested for the long run
"I have been more involved with NCLH lately, but what do you guys think is $14 cheap enough to buy back in on CCL? I am on the fence, but thinking I will wait a few more days just thinking in terms of the overall market may take a break and pull back a little bit. If it does I will take on a new CCL position before the weekend..."
"$BA $UAL $AAL $CCL are the stocks that will continue to tick up until it reach pre-pandemic price level, mark my word."
If you were thinking of investing then i certainly would be taking advantage of this dip. You've seen what this share does with good news. I dont personally see alot more downside from here. I would be buying some here then adding on either up and down moves. The article was only guidance and we could still see July as a start. Good luck longs.
$50 stock by september
P&O opened up their new UK sailings today and their website has crashed due to unprecedented demands. In their own words..bookings have gone through the roof!
"Cruise Planners, a company that books cruises on the world’s largest cruise ship line, said bookings shot up by 600% when they announced that cruises would begin August 1. The spike is a 200% increase over the same time period last year."
"Anyone seeing anything positive right now in $UAL $AAL $CCL $NCLH $RCL has to be looking at things through Rose-Colored Glasses. Just because a stock's share price is historically low, it doesn't mean that the stock is ""cheap"" or a ""good value"". After these stocks dumped hugely in March, they rebounded quickly because they were viewed as ""cheap"". Now, several months later, things are MUCH WORSE than was ever anticipated when they tanked in March to establish those lows. INCREASED DILUTION, INCREASED DAILY CASH BURN, NO POSITIVE GUIDANCE OR OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE NEAR FUTURE!Wake up people!"
Just got in on 150 shares. This has a nice safe divy and I foresee smooth consumer spending and no recession in US for the next 3 years. Euro and Asia might be a little soft next year but will recover as geopolitical issues will get resolved. Oil prices are my biggest concern although demand is stepping down 1-3years out from now.Will certainly add if CCL keeps dropping
"U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has just raised the warning level on the health risk of cruise travel to Level 4 -- the most strident one possible -- indicating a ""very high level of COVID-19"" risk for cruisers.""....It is now the official advice of the CDC that vacationers do not take cruises, and the agency in fact ""recommends that all people avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, worldwide, because the risk of COVID-19 on cruise ships is very high."""
"I just want to thank the board for all the actions that they’ve been taking. Hiring Jeffrey Gearhart was smart. The fact that he is intertwined with Ozark bank, makes him extremely valuable. Further I’m happy with Saudi Arabia jumping in to prop up a fantastic company. And last but not least, the CFO making purchases of stock showing confidence. My 25th wedding anniversary is Labor Day weekend. I just booked Saturday, and I’m going as long as that ship sails. It’s going to be a great ride! NO FEAR!"

"Oh man. If this happens @Issay...Oh I mean @Bill ....Dang it I mean @Hairless BawlsAKA @Kevin if this happens this lady is going to go into heart failure. However, she is the Canadian expert and resident know it all.Congress urges Canada to reevaluate banning cruises until 2022Morgan Hines, USA TODAYSun, February 28, 2021, 8:36 AMA U.S. congressional committee has asked Canada to reevaluate its ban on cruises, which prohibits ships from sailing in Canadian waters until March 2022.On Wednesday, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure sent a letter to Canadian ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman, hoping to ""encourage"" the Canadian government to work with the U.S. government and the cruise industry to find a ""mutually agreeable solution.""In the letter, the committee expressed its ""concern regarding the potential economic impact on local businesses and communities,"" saying that ""by closing Canadian ports to passenger vessels for another year, the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Americans and Canadians are at risk from more job losses and further economic devastation.""Canada's ban not only impacts ships in Canadian waters, it also puts a roadblock in the way of cruises in Alaska, New England, Washington state or the Great Lakes. Ocean cruise ships have not sailed in U.S. waters since last March.- ADVERTISEMENT -U.S. maritime law requires international stops on ships flagged in foreign countries, which includes many major cruise lines' ships.Because of this, many of the cruises scheduled to sail in U.S. waters in areas such as Alaska would need to stop at a port in Canada, which is not permitted by the country's ban. Many cruise lines, including Holland America and Princess Cruises, have already canceled their Alaska seasons as a result.To address the situation, the committee suggested allowing stops at Canadian ports without passengers disembarking, noting that could minimize COVID-19 risk Canada is concerned about.The letter is signed by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who is chair of the committee; ranking member Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo.; Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., who is the chair of the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation; ranking member Rep. Bob Gibbs, R-Ohio, who is also on the Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation; and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska..Cruise Lines International Association, the leading cruise industry organization, thanked committee members for facilitating dialogue with the Canadian government, in a statement provided by Bari Golin-Blaugrund, vice president of strategic communications for CLIA.""CLIA looks forward to working with the Canadian and U.S. authorities on a solution that addresses the public health needs of Americans and Canadians alike, while responsibly restarting a critical economic driver for the Pacific Northwest and Alaska,"" CLIA said.This isn't the first initiative taken by members of Congress in the face of the ban. Shortly after it was issued, Young and Alaska Republican Reps. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan issued a joint statement explaining that the ban was ""unexpected"" and ""unacceptable"" since it came without warning.""We expect more from our Canadian allies,"" the statement said. “Upon hearing the announcement, we immediately reached out to Canadian and American agencies to try to understand the rationale behind this decision – particularly the duration of the ban. We are exploring all potential avenues, including changing existing laws, to ensure the cruise industry in Alaska resumes operations as soon as it is safe. We will fight to find a path forward.”"
Surprise test.Question #1Which ship will Carnival scrap next in order to stay afloat?Question #2A cruise line burns some 550 million dollars every month. They have billions of dollars of debt. They also invested billions on new ships. This cruise line had close to zero income last year and is expected to have the same zero income this year. How long would you estimate before this cruise line files for bankruptcy?
Is it going back up soon?
CCL is on the way UP!CCL = STRONG BUY

"'Every reason to be optimistic': Carnival Corp. CEO expects to resume US sailing before year endMorgan Hines, USA TODAYThu, October 8, 2020, 10:12 AM PDTArnold Donald, the CEO of Carnival Corp., expects that the company's cruise lines will be sailing by the end of the year in U.S. waters after a more-than-seven-month pause in operations.""At this time we have every reason to be optimistic that we will be sailing in the U.S. before year end,"" Donald said on an earnings call Thursday. He added later that because of the success of initial sailings in Europe, the company believes it has a ""way to go forward"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic that continues to impact countries worldwide, including the United States which has seen more than 210,000 people die from the disease.Carnival Corp. lines, which is parent to Carnival Cruise Line, Holland America, Princess Cruises, P&O Cruises, among others, are taking a staggered approach to resuming operations as previously promised by the cruise company. One has already resumed operations: Costa Cruises, which resumed sailing two of its ships in Italy, made its first comeback voyage on Sept. 6. A second, AIDA Cruises is scheduled to follow suit in Italy beginning Oct. 17.Costa Cruises has not seen a single case of COVID-19 on board its ships in the more than a month-long period that it has been sailing, Roger Frizzell, spokesperson for Carnival Corp., told USA TODAY Thursday.""Our company is uniquely positioned for phased resumption given multiple national brands, which can each be restarted independently,"" Donald said.The restart of Costa has proven valuable as other Carnival Corp. lines plan for their return to U.S. waters: ""We plan to leverage the experience and learnings from both Costa Cruises and AIDA, as well as ongoing input from our science and medical experts as part of the process,"" Frizzell told USA TODAY.For instance, AIDA will adapt Costa's new dining room plans, converting self-service dining areas to full-service restaurants. Costa's contactless process allows passengers to choose a table and review their food choices on a menu that is conveniently available on their mobile device using a QR code. Then, a waiter wearing a face mask takes their order and delivers it to the table.When will Carnival cruise ships return to the US?While both the CDC's ""no-sail"" order and Cruise Lines International Association's (CLIA) voluntary suspension are scheduled to end on Oct. 31, two of Carnival's Corp's biggest lines have canceled cruises beyond that date.Last week, its flagship Carnival canceled all remaining 2020 cruises except those departing out of its home ports in Miami and Port Canaveral, Florida – and acknowledged those might not even happen. Meanwhile, Princess has extended its operational pause through Dec. 15.When cruising comes back, will the buffet return with it? Here's what the cruise lines sayHow US cruising on a Carnival Corp. line might look when it returnsAll Carnival Corp. cruise lines that are subject to the CDC's ""no-sail"" order, or ships that have capacity for more than 250 passengers, are also subject to a set of new CLIA protocols, which include requirements for face masks, testing and physical distancing.But many of the details, Donald said, for example, the kind of testing they will employ for all passengers, are still being worked out.New, mandatory COVID-19 precautions for cruise lines: Testing, masks, ventilationLooking ahead, Carnival Corp. has seen demand for bookings in the second half of 2021.""While the company believes bookings in the first half of 2021 reflect expectations of the phased resumption of its guest cruise operations and anticipated itinerary changes, as of September 20, 2020, cumulative advanced bookings for the second half of 2021 capacity currently available for sale are at the higher end of the historical range,"" Carnival Corp. said in its third quarter business update.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Carnival Corp. expects to cruise in US in 2020: 'A way to go forward'"

"No wonder why institutional investors, as well as other top investors are not buying any stocks right now. They know a second wave is coming and this is not the right time to invest. Next earning will be horrible, second wave will start right after that around fall and cruises will be canceled the rest of the year to avoid the spread of the virus. We have already seen spikes of cases since the long weekend and this is just the beginning not getting any better unfortunately. INVEST WISELY SAVE YOUR MONEY. NOW IS NOT THE BEST TIME...FOLLOW WHAT THE BIG INVESTORS ARE DOING. Not random people on Yahoo boards who are excited to double their 1200 stimulus check or those that say we are millionaires like Steven or Ralph lmao "
"Who was that guy that was so sure that ""CCL will be above$20 eod"". It was Uziel of course. So far all his predictions were wrong. He never got one call right. Nothing, zero."
"Social distancing is irrelevant for vaccinated people, and for cases when members of the same household are travelling together. Criselines will be sailing at 100% capacity as easy as September and Carnival will start again making at least 1 billion in profits per quarter. All the additional pandemic-related costs will easy be covered by higher profits from higher ticket prices. Shorts got it terribly wrong"
When is the earning date? Yahoo keeps changing every week.
Yesterday’s news on Fox. Cruises are restarting https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.foxnews.com/travel/carnival-costa-cruises-europe-coronavirus.amp

Hopefully the Democrat controlled CDC will have something positive to say this week and stop with their scare tactics or “we don’t know”. They haven’t given people much incentive to take the vaccine by saying we still need to wear masks afterwards and hide in our homes. The future of our businesses are at the hands of the CDC and so far they have done a terrible job leading us!
Bought some this morning up a % already!

"For emotional investors, the market is all about hope. People’s investments match their dreams. Electric cars, vaccines, travel.

In 2021, all people will think about is travel and travel is what they will invest in."

They upgraded the stocks from Neutral."
Regarding the new $1B placement........When Carnival starts sailing again and has achieved a better stock market profile.......I expect them to REFINANCE all of this expensive debt down to much lower interest rates. Would also expect them to then buy back some of these stock offerings at the same time and reverse the dilution..........I am not seeing that discussed anywhere on the board..........does anyone else have an opinion about this??Thanks in advance.........
More good news out today. Costa cruises from italy and more germany cruises to start in september. Small steps but looks like things are getting much better.

Cruises will be soaring in summer 2020 and the entire 2021. The old people aren’t being forced to go on the cruise
Positive news! CCL is moving the Vista and Breeze to Galveston which are expected to arrive this Sunday! You wouldn't think CCL would spend the money for this unless they are aware they'll sail soon!
Somebody please give me the bull case on how CCLs ships will be operating in a month. I don’t have one but I’m definitely open to other people’s thoughts.
Well belay my last message a little while ago. Glad i didnt sell when i hit my year anniversary 2 months ago. To the moooooooooooooooon.
I see $13.23 coming
CCL is setting up to break through $30 this week! Today's accumulation at above average volume it extremely BULLISH!
"Here is a clever comment, ""Short make sense where there is juice left. Already 60 bucks stock selling for 13 bucks due to shorts. Remember the funds which sold millions of shares short will buy beforehand leaving retail shorts to burn badly."""
"The way the Longs are praising CCL while its stock retreats reminds me with the musicians playing music on board of the Titanic, while it was sinking....."
Just so you know this won’t close above $27 tomorrow and 100% won’t close above $28...shorts have a lot of covered calls at those prices and will do everything to make sure the close tomorrow worthless
Futures up and CCL down pre-market. Interesting day ahead with no new news out there for the cruise lines. Still think they are accumulating shares for a push upwards in the near future. Charts still bullish near term. Above 20 and 50 day EMA on daily charts which hasn't been seen for a long time. Will check back nearer opening bell.
"UK regulator approves 20-second coronavirus test which could be used in airports and sports venues In the latest technological step forward, a COVID-19 test that takes just seconds has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The Virolens test, made by British start-up iAbra and TT Electronics, uses swabs of saliva and trials have shown it is highly accurate. Trials indicated the test has 98.1% sensitivity, meaning it returns few false negatives, and 99.7% specificity, meaning few false positives.It was trialled at Heathrow Airport and will now be launching with immediate effect, rolling out further in the coming months."
"CCL will drop even lower than the price seen at the end of 2008 financial crisis. During 2008-2009, they could issue discount and promotion to get people to cruise. Now even if they offer discount it will be useless because people will not cruise if they may have to risk being quarantined for 14 days, getting entry denied by foreign countries, and ships getting suspended and canceled."
"Abandon ship, this ship is sinking faster than the titanic"
$30 by tomorrow. $40 by May 1.
Quarantine free flight is now open to Italy...CCL will progress very nicely upward.
"With Covid cases increasing, CCL might was well wait till mid-next year to set first sail when vaccine is estimated to be widely available and distributed to the public. By then they would lose a few more billions in debt. Very to hard to sustain such debt with high interest."
If you hold for a year the only way you realistically lose money is if CCL goes bankrupt. Just live a little and buy.
Expecting this to easily pass $30 tomorrow and move close to $31 on Friday. Shorts will be sh!ting their pants.
$CCL $RCL No cruising. Sold 20% of their boats. 1Bn a month debt. These companies are going bankrupt. What is going on!
i bought at 14.15. should i buy more shares or keep what i have?
$CCL retrace to 10 by Monday/Tuesday. They’re bankrupt and need to dilute.
I bought 700 shares at 26 and I thought that was bottom.... Stilll holding till Christmas
"The price is not above 40 right now only because of exaggerated selloff in the spring 2020. Many people thought no effective vaccine will be found and Carnival will go bankrupt, and price dived to a sub 10 level. Now the stock looks expensive after quadrupling in value, but don't be fooled by this: it's still incredibly cheap and one of the best investment opportunities on the market right now. It surely will double in value in the next 2-3 years"

"Seriously, shorts: It's a matter of days before a vaccine maker, perhaps BioNtech first, announce that they included the last variants in their formulas. What if it happens a weekend, when market is closed ? It will have the same effect on CCL's share price as what happened Nov9. You really should think about covering. Luck don't last forever, especially when you know the outcome."
All excellent news that people are willing to bet on the bonds. Carnivals debt has already been reduced over 50% with no colorectal. People are betting on the future due to vaccines leaving carnival to refinance and survive with minimal cost. Those 12.5% secured notes are now down to 5% and will decrease further. All blue seas ahead.Carry on sailing 
time to buy is after a major downgrade -which typically comes at the bottom i.e. after the price has already come down. so it is no surprise insiders scooping up shares here ..glta
"HEALTH AND SAILING UPDATEThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Framework for Conditional Sailing Order that introduces a phased approach for the safe and responsible resumption of passenger cruises. Carnival Cruise Line will continue to work with the CDC on an eventual return to guest cruise operations. We are evaluating the CDC’s new order that sets out the conditions under which cruising can resume, but there are a significant number of requirements that must be evaluated in the context of our plans to resume operations. We ask our guests, travel advisors and community and destination partners for their patience as we complete our review. We are committed to communicating more details as soon as possible.https://www.carnival.com/health-and-sailing-updates.aspx"
CCL will be first to recover given it caters to younger crowd who are most likely the first to return to cruising in late March when we hit 100 million vaccinated
There is no hope for cruise lines so why to invest in risky and future chapter 11 companies!
Where is Jerome R? He told me CCL would be at $10 last week.
-9 billion cash flow............scary.....
I’m a long CCL guy. It doesn’t look like they will be sailing in July. But that’s ok. This company can weather the storm and so can I. I will continue to increase my position.

"Hello...everyone. I'm new here, moving from vaccine sector. I'm long for the curiser sector as this industry will definitely recover from the Pandemic very soon. I believe the business remains here and once the business recovered, the cash machine will move on. Yeah, it would be 2H21 at the earliest. But the market will give good estimation ahead of that time. I bought some at 17 and sold half at 22. I'm going to put most of my portfolio in CCL next week (this week it looks horrible). Any suggestions, Dude?"
"As your mom will attest, it's not the size of your ship. It's where you get to park it that matters."

"Another announcement from CCL today that they will yet again, postpone sailing date till mid May. They will never admit there will be almost no sailing for the entire 2021 but rather keep extending the sailing date around every couple of months, so the reality won't hit customers or shareholders."
Some misinformed think people are not looking to book cruises. The link below shows differently. This is CCLs data and it shows the webpage traffic for the month of March. https://www.similarweb.com/website/carnival.com#overview
Bloomberg reports that CA is removing restrictions and stocks rally after CDC announces that cruises can resume mid summer!!
@David how much money did you make today in CCL?
"Super sketch what's going on with the earnings delay. They are trying to get more cash to stay afloat I expect. Even if they are able to secure more high interest debt they stand almost no chance at ever paying it off. The industry will be depressed for the next five years or more, costs will be substantially higher, more uncertainty, ports closing, breakouts of the virus, etc. They will never be able to achieve any meaningful earnings or pay off that debt. The only logical reason for the delay is that they are frantically trying to avoid telling the investors the inevitable, which is they are running out of money, out of time and out of options. This could be the first big bankruptcy of 2021. This ship is sinking."
"Earnings coming this Friday, which way will this go?"
"You guys still trading assets that can go belly up, you need to trade NFT..."
everyone's talking about CCL's debt. they will just refinance in a year or two when they are sailing again and looking better financially.
"Stop the f up guys, too much noise in here. If you don’t have the stomach for the market volatility don’t trade stocks, put your money in the bank and get some tiny interest and shut up. This the biggest and best Cruise company in the world and it will survive this pandemic and get out of it stronger..this stock price going to be in The $70-80 range by summer 2022.the demand will start skyrocketing by June-July 2021, and this company has the fleet to take the biggest share of the market. Do not listen to day and short term traders."
I've noticed a change in David's recent posts? We're all pleased he's found someone in his shelter to assist with composition.
"With the signing of the executive order, expect market to go up on Monday. Add to that decrease in virus cases and vaccine progress, sure looks like $NCLH $CCL and $RCL are headed higher."
We have decided to go ahead with our Mexico cruise in March. We will take extra drugs and have loaded up on extra medical insurance and repatriation insurance. Looks like the boat will be full. Only a few cabins are being shown as available. We’re Brave! :-)
"By the middle of next week, there will be 2,000 suspected cases of Coronavirus on the West Coast alone. All cruise lines will just need to shut down for a few months. CCL has no way to screen for Coronavirus. Nobody does."
What shorts say
"For those who think that this stock will recover and make them rich, this article will burst your bubble. Here are some highlights:""...so unless Carnival has some tricks up its sleeve, I have to imagine the ending to this one won’t be very good for shareholder value, either"".""Vaccine is priced in, weakness is not"".""The other thing that I think investors are ignoring is that Carnival wasn’t in good shape before the crisis"".""EBIT margins had been declining steadily for several quarters, having falling from nearly 20% of revenue in 2017 to just 15% the last quarter before COVID hit. Imagine what the company’s margins will look like coming out of the crisis: increased operating expenses due to enhanced cleaning measures, fewer people on board due to either lack of demand, limited capacity, or both, and the potential for lack of pricing power as there are far more cruise ships available today than are needed"".""Long-term debt continues to soar because Carnival has essentially no revenue, but has massive fixed expenses it must continue to pay. This results in cash burn, and as of Q3, was still $770 million per month. The company guided for “only” $530 million per month in Q4, so there’s that"".""With that sort of burn rate, Carnival has to borrow enormous amounts of money just to keep the lights on"".""TTM interest expense is now up to $596 million. It will be in the ~$900 million area by the time Q4 results are reported, at least, and that is simply more money Carnival doesn’t have"".""Keep in mind this interest expense doesn’t suddenly disappear once COVID goes away; this is a permanent impairment of the company’s balance sheet, and by extension, its income statement"".""The bottom line is that we have a stock with very little control over its own destiny, an impaired business model, an extraordinary amount of debt, and higher operating expenses. Couple all of that with a full valuation on 2023 earnings and you’ve got a ridiculously expensive stock"". https://seekingalpha.com/article/4397081-carnival-market-blinders-on"
"Carnival price target raised to $35 from $30 at StifelStifel analyst Steven Wieczynski raised the firm's price target on Carnival to $35 from $30 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares, telling investors that he thinks it seems that the resumption of cruising, especially in North America, is ""becoming more of a reality."" If cruise operations can commence in North America, even in some limited capacity, by the start of Q3, Wieczynski believes the risk of additional dilutive equity or debt raises becomes less likely and that investors should become more comfortable around cash burn assumptions and liquidity"
I can see this trading below 23 in the next few day or weeks short it very easy money to be made
All indicators making a sell call we should correct to 25.68

"I have one piece of advice for all traders, ask yourself what the catalyst will be for a big move up. I always do that when buying a stock. Is there a chance the news flow will turn positive in 3 months and stop the bleeding. With CCL, I don't see anything unless there is a treatment or vaccine. That would cause an explosive move up, but short of that, it will grind down as people abandon the dead stocks and move on to something with a more positive news flow. Boats sitting at the dock with no passengers don't offer anything to move the stock."

"CDC is working with cruise industry to make CSO workable which will allow summer sailings? It now makes since that CCL is moving the ships to Galveston (these are the 1st domestic cruise ships to port and prepare for resail)! No way CCL would move ships and staff the ships in Galveston without a commitment by CDC! Option B: Texas is giving the CDC the bird, and will allow them to sail from the reborn country, THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS (plausible)!"
"This is a no brainer.Many Americans plan to ‘splurge’ on travel this year, survey findsStephanie Asymkos·ReporterMon, March 1, 2021, 8:35 AMAs COVID-19 vaccines roll out, signaling the return to pre-pandemic life is on the horizon, many Americans are making big travel plans, according to new survey data from Expedia Group.More than 2 out 5 people said they’re ready to take more trips in 2021 compared with 2020, and they’re prepared to spend an average of roughly $3,500, the survey of 2,200 Americans conducted in December found.“People have really been saving up for travel since the beginning of the pandemic,” Anni Murphy, Expedia corporate communications manager, told Yahoo Money, referencing canceled weddings, reunions, and untapped loyalty points or airline miles. “For those who can travel who do have that opportunity and who haven't had employment disrupted, those are the folks who are really looking to splurge more on travel and kind of reward themselves.”More than 2 out 5 people said they’re ready to take more trips in 2021 compared with 2020, and they’re prepared to spend an average of roughly $3,500. (Photo: Getty)The optimism can be pinpointed to the vaccine — with 42% of respondents saying the vaccine news made them hopeful about travel or prompted them to book a trip.Travelers plan to spend an average of $3,444, while millennials are ready to drop more — $5,462 on each trip. Many Americans intend on getting away for longer, with 1 in 3 travelers planning a trip that lasts a week or longer.“People are planning to travel more this year than they did even pre-pandemic,” Murphy said, “which is a very encouraging insight and a good signal for travel recovery.”Considering Cancun and London rank among the top destinations where Americans have begun booking trips, according to the survey, maintaining global health is a shared priority for passengers and countries, Murphy said."
"I believe that most in the world are bidding on the times when either a vaccine is available or this becomes another accepted virus like the flu. In either case, just like social distancing has proven, time gets to people and when they want their life to go on they will go on. So as soon as cruise lines are able you know they will be booked to the max."
At Corona cruises you receive a complimentary 14 day extension at your local FEMA camp.
This sell-off will be over once a vaccine is out. Flu is much worse than Corona virus in term of death rate. Difference is flu has vaccine.
Ok? So we now have a vaccine out next Tuesday and shares are falling. As a newbie....can someone explain what’s going on. Genuinely interested.
It's always a good sign when companies increase their dividends. So I don't understand why CCL is sitting near its 52 week low?
The fact that the crews are getting vacinated is a clear sign that the cruise lines are adhering to the CDCs requirements. In addition to the restart of Alaskan cruises is telling as it relates to the CDC lifting the CSO. I'd hate to be short at this point. JMHO.
What up CDC? Get off the pot and approve sailings so we can move on up to $42!
Looks like Harry Bawls is always on the wrong side of the trade  sorry bud
"It will take a year, but Carnival will come back strong. Cruisers love to cruise!In a year from now Carnival will be giving 50% discounts to its loyal customers and two years out they will be booking 100% capacity on all of their cruise lines. Cruisers love to cruise!"
Wow was 5 cents away on my call
Let's return this first ship back with no COVID cases and sky's the limit!!
Coronavirus is a mild virus. Since the newest antibody studies the actual mortality rate is a fraction of a percent. Way overblown. Back to cruising in late July or August.
"The market is full of great value, as of right now. I personally recommend Carnival Corporation to the majority of my clients. One rare benefit I look for in stocks is their ability to stay on the top, when it comes to competition. Carnival is a prime example; it is nearly impossible for a competitor to build the same amount of assets, within the near the future. I'm a senior partner at Goldman Sachs and I'm willing to help give some financial advice during these rough times.

"CDC Lightens Up On Cruise Face Mask and Shore Ex RulesMay 12, 2021Cruise ships in MiamiThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has seemingly lightened up on its complex cruise regulations, releasing an update to its COVID-19 operation guidelines for cruise lines wanting to operate from U.S. ports under the agency's Conditional Sail Order.While the CDC stressed its mask order remains in effect, it said that ""cruise ship operators, at their discretion, may advise passengers and crew that—if they are fully vaccinated—they may gather or conduct activities outdoors, including engaging in extended meal service or beverage consumption, without wearing a mask except in crowded settings.""The CDC also noted that cruise lines may allow fully vaccinated passengers to go ashore on their own, instead of having to participate in organized group tours.""Cruise ship operators, at their discretion, may advise passengers and crew that—if they are fully vaccinated—they may engage in self-guided or independent exploration during port stops, if they wear a mask while indoors. The cruise ship operator is additionally advised that foreign jurisdictions may have their own requirements,"" said the guidelines. More news is expected to follow on Wednesday afternoon."
"The stock lies in the middle of a very wide and strong rising trend in the short term and a further rise within the trend is signaled. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 46.13% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $35.61 and $44.73 at the end of this 3-month period."

It’s also canceling cruises in and out of Japan through June 25, 2021.The Carnival Corp.-owned cruise line said the extended pause was necessary to meet preparations required under the conditional sailing order rules set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC.) The CDC’s framework requires cruise ship operators to plan for testing, quarantining, social distancing and other health precautions amid the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19."
"A leading Carnival fan page on Facebook, the Carnival Cruisers Opinion Page, has drawn hundreds of negative comments after learning of the new restrictions. “What’s the point in cruising if we can’t get off the ship in port?” wrote one of the page’s members, summing up a sentiment expressed by many."
I'm starting to like Monday mornings after all. New high for this year!

"There is no 100days rule etc etc. Yes, it was guided 100 days worst scenario. As soon as the economy is open and the airlines are running. Within a week, the cruise will be open. Comon guys, stop being pessimistic. Look at the history, the CCL has been in business for the past 30 years or even longer. This will die once the whole economy dies. Yes, the price will be volatile, ups and downs all the way until it is stable. But, looking beyond September and based on the economic situation, the Cruise sector should do well. As a matter of fact, they will be more aggressive in the future and try to preserve cash for the long run."

I would bail now if I was u. What happens when cruises do go back and there is cases onboard and negative press
Every coin has two sides you know
"""The pandemic shows no signs of slowing, and we, like everyone, are eager for more tools to help stop it. At the same time, it is premature to get into the specifics of the supply of our vaccine candidate, as we do not yet have Phase 3 data, nor have we filed for or been granted Emergency Use Authorization,"" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement Wednesday."
"CCL is a pure gamble, and will likely go down - if people took time to read their financials, they do not look good. Reasons are as followed:1) company owes close to 2.5 billion by 2020 ( this is factoring that new ships are covered by their existing credit facility) - all remaining debts will likely be covered with the 6billion of financing. Which is fine. (They can survive for 10months - yippee)2) let’s say for the grace of god that Covid 19 dies out by June, and they are able to start sailing by late June (unlikely) - people keep forgetting that it will take time for the economy to slowly start running up again (at least 6-9months) and with the higher unemployment rate and the lingering fears of Covid 19 - do you believe people will likely vacation on a cruise for the rest of 2020?? It took 6 years for the airlines to recover from historic highs after 911!! Pretty sure covid 19 has surpassed that event (pretty sure “most” people will be hesitant stepping on a cruise) However, even if 2021, 2022 and 2023 goes back to normal (just to be an optimist let’s say their revenues are back at around 20billion) and go back to around 2019 levels! we have to factor that they owe roughly 5.75billion by 2023 (might be less if convertible holders decide to exercise their right to own equity) but we need to factor their existing debt before covid 19 -which is another whopping 7billion ( this is not even including the ships they promised to pay - which I’m not even factoring) ...so let’s recap, we have 5.75 billion + 7billion = 12.75billion due by 2023. And we are assuming sales for 2021, 2022, and 2023 are back at 20billion “sales”. Here’s the fun part- let’s say they are able to have a new profit margin of 10% (which is still highly unlikely due to the 11.5% borrowing on interest, and they have already cut fare tickets for for 2021 and 2022 to attract customers!) that gives the net profit for the 3 years around 6 billion (2 billion each year). As you can see, there is still a shortfall - they still cant pay the 12.75 billion they owe by 2023. Now what can the company do? Either try and refinance by 2023 - but the management even is unclear and is doubtful they will be able to attain refinancing. Or they can sell ships (but who will honestly buy cruise ships!? ...other cruise companies of course...oh wait, RCL and Norwegian are in worse financial shape that CCL (so unlikely they will sale to competitors) so maybe scrap metal - which will put the value of these ships at a good 70% discount from the balance sheet figures.End of the day, I highly doubt CCl will weather the storm in the next 3 years - I thinkequity investors will get wiped out, and the bond holders will continue to own the company. The company will still be around, just not with the original shareholders. I hope I’m wrong, but the numbers don’t look promising."
"If the market was doing better as a whole, this would be up $3."

"What is the CDC going to do, approve or disapprove NCLH's plan? Cruise lines are going to SURGE or CRASH on their decision!"
"it's not like they stop at the gas station to fill up these ships. They buy futures contracts for their oil, it's not a month to month deal. They know what they are paying for their oil all the way into 2021 no matter what happens to the price of crude. This is a real phoney excuse. The CEO is a chatleton..."

WOW!! AMC...320 million shares traded in the first 10 minutes
"Sorry Shorts, but within the next month, the CDC will be forced to approve sailings (AG's in FL, TX, LA & the cruise lines will sue, just read the article in WSJ). Since cruise ships won't be ready to sail for 90 days and by then, at least half the US will be fully vaccinated and the cruise lines could initially require all passengers to be vaccinated. CDC has no excuse, or they have another agenda! Better cover your shorts!"
Ive been holding on for a little bit longer since hitting my year mark 2 months ago. Bullish but with the scraping of sailing pushed back again hard not to hit the sell button for me personally.
Increased volume early in the day mostly up. Might have legs to move higher.
So the government may bail out cruise lines. They will have to restructure much like autos. How long will the physical effects last? Who is gonna rush to book cruise after this?
"Most cruise lines don't pay federal income tax — just one of the reasons they aren't getting a bailoutSome of the country’s largest publicly traded cruise lines are incorporated offshore. Carnival Corporation, which owns the Princess cruise line, is incorporated in Panama. Royal Caribbean is incorporated in Liberia, and Norwegian Cruise Lines is incorporated in Bermuda.https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/most-cruise-lines-don-t-pay-taxes-u-s-just-n1172496"

CCL HEADING TO $60CSO to be lifted by July 2021!!!CCL = STRONG BUY!
Chuck why is it going up? Asking for a friend.
"Why should this really come as any surprise? All one has to do is consider all of the facts. Over the past year has Carnival sold, reduced the number of ships in their fleet? Will it be necessary to increase operating expenses to provide required sanitary conditions onboard? Has Carnival taken on billions of dollars of additional debt, debt that required them to pay higher then current normal interest rates? Has Carnival issued 100's of millions of new shares just to maintain some liquidity on their balance sheet. When Carnival does start sailing again, while they are saying bookings are close to pre-pandemic levels, what percentage of those bookings are being made with previously issued vouchers and substantially reduced rates? Lastly, did even Carnival's CEO recently state that the next two years were going to be tough?"
"I'm a pro-science, COVID believer, mask believer, vaccine believer, (crazy, I know) and even I can see that at this point the cruise industry is being treated unfairly. It is time to take active steps to get people sailing once again. You will see cases and deaths fall off a cliff in the coming weeks. The CDC needs to plan ahead for that with respect to cruises. Go get vaccinated, help the cases fall, don't spread coved to kids, don't spread it to younger people who end up hospitalized and many of whom suffer psychological issues from COVID. Let's all grow up and do our civic duty. And cruise!"
