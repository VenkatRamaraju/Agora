Since most people are still telecommuting then explain why auto insurance rates have not plunged? Do insurance companies need help from our useless Congress?

What happened to the PGR company? big oversold on RSI.
Arguably the most undervalued stock in the whole market. Under $10 P/E ratio?! Banana land  let’s go to the moon folks
seriously no dividend?
Progressive figured out they could make a lot more money if they sold insurance cheaper and then just screwed their policy holders any time there was a claim. They will short the claim by an amount that they know you will not sue them for due to the time and money required to recover the difference. Anybody who buys Progressive insurance is an idiot.

Will the stockholders be rewarded for putting their money into PGR? A good quarter should prod the board into raising the dividend. We deserve it.
why does yahoo show earnings 12/10 .. seems too early. is this a mistake
"Hey Barnacle B, where ya at Bra? Been a little quiet lately."
If it drops today after earnings...as always...buy and hold for 8 points in 2 weeks. as constant as sun rises.
"I have been watching the final 20 minutes of trading. The volume perked up as the last minutes of buying or selling selling before earnings are reported. I expected this flurry of activity but, I expected the price to rise. But the sellers have been active and I don't think that bodes well for the earnings report."
PGR is down 6.06% to 64.14
'ghostbusters' rated one of the WORST insurance ads everFlo just keeps on burning up that Cleveland cash.LOL

Under 95 is a discount
"Combined ratio increased by 12.6% to 96......Combined ratio is single largest factor on earnings.This would partly be explained by return to normal miles driven.Regardless, I see the drop as an over-reaction, and have taken advantage of the sale price.PGR frequently does this after earnings. If it's like the typical overreaction we will just smile in a few days.If you don't understand what Combined ratio is you need to look it up...."

"This stock is cheap at this levels if you want to be long.It was in the 60s on January of 2016 while their revenue was half and their earnings per share were three times less what they are now. Great balance sheet. Increasing revenue, increasing profit margins. Markets are a bit beaten down due to the uncertainty of the election for for next year this will correct itself to above 110."
"At first glance April results look grim with $316m in GAAP earnings, down 67% y/y. But PGR received $200m in cash premiums not reported on income statement and didn’t pay out $700m in losses reported, which means FCF was $900m higher than reported earnings. Not so grim? Also policies sold up double digits across the board— seems to me to have been a great month"
PGR is down 5.80% to 75.85
Flo and Box where are the Harvey reserves ? You bundle dolts !
pgr record earnings. buy and make a fortune by next summer.

"Beats on earnings goes down, misses on earnings goes down, goes up when some want it to"
PGR is up 5.01% to 75.88
What is wrong with this stock? Why so hated?

"Never buy insurance from a company that throws millions upon millions of dollars down the drain on on STUPID, IDIOTIC, LUNATIC commercials...."
Over 5 Million in volume today - wow
PGR is up 4.90% to 77.25
Almost all the real insurance companies have a criminally low P/E. Meanwhile LMND hemorrhages money and is going vertical from Motley Fool articles. PGR literally prints money.
Progressive reached a 52 Week high at 85.43
PGR is up 4.90% to $73.20
target for the end of the week?? someone knows????
Looks like a good beat. My 2 coppers worth believes PGR stock value will pull at least 3%+ and may accelerate if shorts get squeezed enough to snowball.
"I've been waiting for a decline in Insurance stocks and the one-two punch of Hurricanes ""Harvey"" and ""Irma"" have provided that buying opportunity. Up until this year, I would have been on the doorstep of Travelers as I (was) a customer of theirs, but after being a Travelers customer for most of this decade, I tired of their uncompetitive rate hikes for unblemished multi-policy holders, like myself. After much research and comparisons, I chose to make my insurance needs (Home & Auto) commitment, and now investment commitment with Progressive. Bought in with my initial position at yesterday's close. I think the price weakens is near the end as much of Harvey and Irma has been taken out of the stock price already. Should there be any more pullbacks, I'll just treat them as buying opportunities for my cash."
"Adam, I don't think many heard about the $2.25 dividend. And, the quarter had lots of positive results. They just need to control non-claim expenses. Dividend will be paid to all stockholders as of January 7. Good opportunity!!!"
I have been in PGR for 40+ years and thru many splits. The last 3 years it has gone up but since has hit its high point and now just fluctuates between 70-80. The only way to make money now is to buy the dips and sell higher. It sucks to watch every week it go up then down consistently.
Maybe something to do with employee pay raises
"Flo and Box better find a big fat check book to pay tons of Texas claims on flooded cars, destroyed RVs and wrecked boats.Bundle baby !!"
good luck longs
"Just found this stock. Is this too good to be true? 11 p/e 4.5% payout ratio, and a 5% dividend, 14yoy growth? Good lord is this a joke?"
I'm getting seasick!!
Great earnings report!
Can you spell double jeopardy ? Double jeopardy occurs when you spends billions of dollars over 15 years building an advertising campaign so that you can attract the last marginal online customers and then lose billions of dollars on their claims from Harvey and Irma. Flo and box are just plain genius !
Yahoo's previous earnings date for the stock was for December 12th... it was not that date. beware Yahoo finance sucks for accuracy.
Do you guys think the earnings report will be positive

"Consistent money maker, increasing profits, increasing policies,.....when us this a takeover target?"
Progressive reached an all time high at 99.01
Progressive is down 4.92% to 100.77
The company will return One Billion Dollars to policy holders due to fewer claims than expected. who are these stock traders who are driving the stock price down? Manipulaters? My logic only shouts bigger profits for PGR.
PGR is up 4.97% to 80.25
a raising stock. I need an airplane to fly
This stock rocks!!! Long PGR
bundle
When are earnings? Today or Jan 28th?
They are paying out a $4.46 a share div. and the stock price is down $4.50 robbing Peter to pay Paul.
A friend of mine got in a minor accident with no injuries and < $5000 of damage. PGR doubled her rate to almost $600 for 6 months.
"Road rage, text distracted drivers, negative interest rates, and hundreds of millions wasted on FLO advertising. LOL"
Dropped Progressive insurance today. Get into politics Reap what happens progressive.
Here we go again!
"38,000 fatal car crashes a year in the US. 4.4M additional injury crashes in the US each year. Average Auto Insurance claim is $17k. 87% drivers insured. PGR has 11% market share. Urban areas are seeing reduction in crashes somewhere between 50-75% during Covid shutdown. Imagine the savings over 2 months..."
Why is this stock so volatile?
"This analyst says get out while you still can:""In our view, Progressive Insurance (NYSE:PGR) appears to be fully valued based on its current stock multiple. Our analysis of this data indicates that loss cost trends are plateauing, pricing is flat to down and repair costs are going up — partially offset by declining bodily injury costs. We might be at the peak of this cycle and results might be flattish from here. Hence, we would consider lightening up on personal-auto-predominant stocks based on valuation.""https://www.twst.com/interview/commercial-lines-among-the-most-favorable-insurance-subsectors"

PGR is down 4.90% to 73.21

All I can think of is a big investor selling.
"9 days till earnings. My plan is to dump this dog just before, or just after the earnings. See ya, I'm blowing the disaster."
Up $2. What does that say about earnings tommorrow? Give me another dollar and you can have my shares today.
"Florida is going to pound Flo and box with big time Irma claims. This is an incredibly stupid organization. Just think, billions spent on Flo and box just to see the newly acquired clients with RVs, boats, motorycles, and cars face massive storm damages."
extremely overvalued
I hope this company goes belly-up and takes their STUPID commercials with them. Hello Jaimie??? Are you listening? What kind of company does a parody of an employee calling themselves about their band and singing? Has NOTHING to do with insurance. REAL DUMB!
