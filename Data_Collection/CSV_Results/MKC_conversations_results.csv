"Spicy Samuel? Spicy Steve? Do you all think that we could get this spice raft to go all the way up to the $170s? I do. I use McKormick spices all day long, at work, at home, at church events, at the local VFW, I even bring several of my favorite spices in the car, just in case I am traveling and need spices. This company is pushing all boundaries of spice infusion into the broader marketplace. I even think they might get into the pot space, by offering spicy versions of hemp processed into cbd spices and flavorings. Any thoughts? Should be trading at 40-50x FCF, not just 30x. These aren't just spices, they are necesseties of daily life in the 21st c. Rule the world with spice."
what is the split date?
Buy this stock? Maybe?
MKC CEO STEP IN BUY BACK SHARES WHILE CHEAP
Kudos to all who held and bought after last ER. MKC is a solid play mid and long term.
SHORTED HAHAHHAHA
How does this company have so little cash?
MKC-V reached a 52 Week low at 134.28
CHEAP PRICE
Should recover into low $30's by early next week...selloff overdone....this stock is defensive and with the markets being volatile expect people to buy in for safety...especially after this big drop.
"Just went Long 240 shares at $156.27. I expect an Earnings beat tomorrow morning, with positive guidance going forward, to propel the stock price past the $160.00 level. Putting a $166.00 Limit Sell to lock in profit if she pops up big in the early morning. They beat the consensus last earnings and guided higher, I expect the same tomorrow morning. This sector is a safe harbor from political and economic turmoil, which is why I think even a modest beat will be rewarded by a nice pop up in the stock price."
"Mkc is 87% owned by institutions. Hence, daily trading of broadly owned stock is limited to a small % of the shares. This makes for unusual movement at times."
Great few days.

"I saw someone inquire in a reply about the French's purchase and what products it entailed. They bought out the ""RB Foods"" group from Reckitt and Benckiser, which is an Anglo-Dutch group (like Unilever) that has/had consumer product goods, food, cleaners, etc. This group included all of French's (mustard, ketchup, the onion toppers, etc)., all of Frank's Red Hot (sauces, mixes, etc.), and Cattleman's barbecue sauces. It is a significant suite of products and brand names that has considerably increased the size of McCormick's revenues, profits, margins, distribution channels, and overall consumer market and mind share. They have some nice slides in their investor relations publications that show the suite of products acquired, as well as the new product offerings that they have already designed for release (and those which are on their way)."
"Nearly 90% of mkc is owned by institutions. That makes a lot of sense because mkc sells products that are always wanted, performs consistently, has evolved in an evolving world, and has proven it can make good decisions. That’s a safe and sound investment that’s very likely to grow. It’s not high-tech:high risk/reward, and instead it’s solid, steady, low-risk and regularly growing. That equals a very good investment, and the knowledgeable professional investors recognize it. Me too!"

MKC is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
"It doesn't say much for Baltimore teachers when they tell students to boo Melania. Heres a woman, with a Be Best agenda of trying to keep kids off drugs, and be the best they can be. And teachers who get paid an average of 60,000 a year, care more about their job, than forming positives attitudes for children. This is why we need school choice. To help keep disrespectful teachers from having any contact with our children. These teachers are also instilling other bad behaviors on our innocents. McCormick is going to have trouble finding good workers with area public schools having a bad influence on them when they are young."
MKC reached a new All Time High at 119.36
"The market has a lot more respect for this stock now. The short % is a tad over 2%, but several months ago it was 6+%. Q2 earnings will likely be decent but lower than last year considering the CV quarantining. Q3 will edge up as restaurants reopen, but not as good as last year because the restaurants aren’t going to be nearly as bustling as last year. Nonetheless, we should see reliable and predictable performance out of MKC that’s good considering the circumstances, and that should reassure the market that MKC is what we think it is—a steady, focused, capable company that meets its challenges and provides products that consumers like and value."
"Not looking too good for KHC today. I hope MKC can continue its appeal with customers to prevent us from having to share that same fate. We had a hiccup quarter and stock decline, but nothing like what they are going through over there."
McCormick reached an all time high at 194.32

Malee—did you buy in or are you still out and waiting?
"Are you shareholders buying more, waiting, or just staying put with your holdings until the corona effect is over?"
I think we see 192 before end of day ? Ceo on mad money

"In Jan 2019, the stock dropped from 150 to 120's range. any one knows what the sharp drop?"
This is the article—https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-financial-trends-mccormick-apos-215700226.html
"Looking for news/info why the drop and seeming weakness in stock price. Haven’t found any. Based on reports, business is solid and management is effective. I wonder—is it the small market cap? Is it the solid, sound, but not hyper upside potential that makes the stock performance weaker?"
"just before dividends are paid this happens every 1/4 then goes down a small amount after look at the 5 year history ,I have been long on this for 10 years"
This stock has not moved for like 6 months!!! Pretty much been stagnant since the split. I’ll continue to buy whenever there is money
We were looking good last week. But here it goes again. Probably headed back to $190

"Out MKC at $166.00 for a very nice gain of $2,330.00 in less than 24 hours. :-) I think she will go up more today, and good luck to all the Longs, but I am off on a new Earnings Adventure for this afternoon..."
Seems like $160 is the ceiling for this stock.
just keeps on going up!
McCormick is down 5.03% to 143.07
Looking really attractive. People still like seasoning on their food even at home.
"Earnings out tomorrow morning. Good luck everyone! Hopefully the Street will react favorably, but you can never tell (especially following a day like today with the enormous reversal on the S&P from Friday)-Dan"
A little bit more of a drop then a big bounce is coming
MKC-V reached a new All Time High at 119.32
MKC reached a new All Time High at 108.95
"Wow! MKC completed it's acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's food division today. That's got to be one the fasted acquisition closing's ever for a deal of that size. About one month from announced date is pretty amazing and shows MKC was prepared for this. Still think it was pricey, but congrats to MKC for getting what they wanted. I'll be rooting for you and reinvesting those dividends in the meantime."
"MKC got a big boost from the 2020 shutdowns, with many more people cooking at home. With the arrival of effective vaccines, the virus panic will finally come to an end next year and things will get back to normal. Retail sales of spices and condiments will fall as a result. This will be partially offset by sales to reopening restaurants, but those sales represent only 20% of MKC sales. The other 80% is retail. I predict the stock price will drop 20-30% by the end of 2021 as a result."
MKC is up 6.51% to 140.90
"I assume the stock price movement is because of two things: one-earnings are about to be released, and two-lots of investors have gains because the stock has done so well over the past several months, and they want to cash in on those before the earnings release.I continue to believe that one should look at this investment with a long term point of view, not just how the stock price will move from one day to another or one week to another. I believe the company is solid, the management is good, and the prospects are good. Therefore, I am going to hold And I expect that the price will rise nicely over the long-term. I have been in the stock for over two years, and have been rewarded nicely for that. Good luck to all."
MKC is up 4.92% to 111.14
"Rotation, rotation going on. I have always wanted to own this name. So bought today at $168"
"I can't fade this company anymore I put 50,000 into it because it was increasing steadily and the second I buy it, it goes to #$%$. I would not recommend this company to anyone it is an absolute piece of pooper"
good stock holders meeting today
JPMorgan stinks.....I'll load up on more shares with their gift though.
let's get spicy! we light this cinnamon stick on fire and take spices to outer space! $205 is my target. no reason why spices won't become more valuable than the silver...more valuable than Litecoin...more resilient than the US dollar...we take this up from here and crush the market
Looks cheap. Buy 98
Beat coming this afternoon?
See the following article that views the company in a similar manner as I described.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-mccormick-shareholders-happy-week-041500699.html
"Boom Boom, MKC smashes through $167! I'm already out, but love to see traders and investors riding a bull up. Would be extra cool if she managed to break her 52 week high of $171.10, today. A bit of a stretch IMO, but not beyond the realm of reasonable possibility. Fatten those wallets, you longs! :-)"
Earnings $0.79 per share. $0.10 worse than the consensus prediction.
MKC reached an all time high at 167.18
"Ex Pinnacle Foods/ ConAgra shareholder, now a MKC shareholder.I owned Pinnacle shares for about 6 years & they performed incredibly well. Unfortunately they were swallowed up by ConAgra about 1.5 months ago. My 'new' ConAgra shares were already down over 16.00% as of today. The only good thing is that a large portion of the deal was cash.Earlier today, I sold the CAG shares & invested the proceeds in MKC.Hopefully, over time, that turns out to be a smart move."
"KRAFT HEINZ needs to sell several billion in assets. Is there an acquisition opportunity there for MKC? I don’t know, but it would be nice if the answer were yes."
Couple of comments:1) the stock is still up over 20% from its price at the end of 2017.2) my wife and I have been in this stock for more than 20 yrs. It was our biggest holding until today but it will be again.3) I bought 5 June $120 call options today. I think thisselloff is an over reaction although the stock was selling at a fairly high multiple.We will continue to hold and hopefully flip the options at a profit.
"Re acquisitions—I assume management has a sharp focus on strategic opportunities if there are any that are open to or in need of a transaction. The company has a good thing going as things stand now and that good thing has to be cared for with the utmost TLC. Company leadership seems to check that box well. But then there’s also the natural confidence that they can do more and add to the good thing they’re already doing that can lead to expansion in various ways, including through acquisitions. I would think that in these challenging times, there would be opportunities out there. The decision making, however, would be a balancing act between keeping the good thing we already have in tact and not hurting it vs possibly growing even stronger by taking on something new."

"Recent drops and jumps in price have not been based on the company’s performer, but rather by traders and supposed pundits. If you’re in the stock because you like the company and it’s performance, then you have to take deep breaths or let out yells when the short term volatility erupts and remember that it’s short term and you’re long term ....and in the long term the stock price will be a function of the company’s performance."
MKC paying ten times sales for a hot sauce company. This market is nuts.

“Pre-market”
MKC NEEDS BUY BACK SHARES
"Stock price movement the last few days--up and sometimes down a $2-$3 per day is odd because there isn't any significant news. Anyone have ideas?Separately, I hope that management is searching for more synergistic acquisitions since they pulled the last one off so well. Recall that the market criticized them the last time, saying that they'd overpaid. What that showed us shareholders is that management new exactly what they were doing . . . which is what you'd hope and expect from good executives--CEO, CFO, COO, maybe others. Also, I would think that MKC is an attractive target for larger food distribution companies because the brand is solid, the relationships are solid, and there could be great synergy in merging MKC into another good company. However, this may be a less likely scenario in light of the high comp levels of several key execs at MKC. Overall, being in this stock seems like a sensible place to be."
"I think of this investment is a reliable place to put fairly conservative portion of my investment portfolio. The products they sell, spices and relate, have been in demand for thousands of years, and the McCormick brand has long been recognized as a tried and true leader. I'm not aware of any reason why that would change for the worse in the foreseeable future. Management as steered this ship in a solid and steady fashion, it seems. All that equates to a nice place to put conservative investment dollars and hope/expect them to grow at a decent rate (if not better) on a long term basis."
"That premarket uptick of +13.22 appears to be a glitch. I am seeing +0.22 on other exchanges. Perhaps a fat finger happened but in any event, it doesn't look like a thing."
Acting horrendous the last 2 weeks. Now below when they announced stock split.
"Just curious - when MKC bought the French's brand, did they just get the French's mustard or did they also get the other French's products like the French's ketchup, toppings, etc?"
I guess sometimes the per hour price doesn’t mean anything. Can’t get in at 185 even though it shows 2 times this morning.
"Spicy PEOPLE! This stock is going straight to $200 without stopping for more pepper. Take spices with you everywhere! Eat spices on your food, or in your beverage and you will not only be healthier, but richer for owning spicy shares of MKC! This is how the spice road was built folks, hard work and spices and lots of money! We got this saffron injection! Yeah!"

"Spicy people, pick a stock that is a real loser in your portfolio, cash out, BUY this stock!! MKC is just dipping here. No way it goes below 153.80$. Zero chance this stock will slip even a little. BUY BUY! Long live MKC LONGS! More spices please. More money please!"
"Stock has moved a lot this year, but largely justified by excellent performance and solidness of the improvements. Business is solid and safe. Management performance in guiding the core business and making strategic acquisitions has been demonstrably successful. Stock is reliable and, medium to long term, a safe investment. Low trading volume and high institutional ownership support strength in stock price, and also encourage more growth to increase enterprise value."
does this stock get effected by trade war?

I buy McCormick products on Amazon. I don't think Amazon is a threat.
Back within 5$ of its 52-week high already. Amazing
When is the stock split or did i miss it?
"NO PEPPER FOR YOU!! I have been in the market for 55 years and this has been the craziest period I have ever seen and that includes Black Monday, the 2000 Internet crash, 2008-9 disaster and now this. Why is MKC down 10% in a generally positive market (at this minute anyway)? Why is MCD up a bunch and MKC down? The decline in commercial sales should be offset by sales to retail. Any thoughts? MKC was pretty richly priced but that should have been bled out by now."
Going down after this news?? I'll just add more but this market is such a damn joke in 2020 it's ridiculous.
Old Bay hot sauce is selling out in Annapolis. Where can I get some?

"Point of concern--- added interest expense hindering net income growth post-acquisition. Okay, running through numbers on the SEC filing for pro forma 2016 and first 6 months of 2017 on the combined entity shows some incredible strength in the acquire company/assets. R&B Food Company is showing a return on equity of 32.45% for 2016 which is higher than MKC. Good prospects on added revenue growth and net income growth as well, coupled with the anticipated and forecasted cost synergies by 2020 (I'm guessing R&B back office people are going to be targeted to retain as much on the commodity sourcing, IT, sales support, etc. at MKC HQ). Cost of goods should also drop as they will be able to leverage the significant increase in bulk purchasing/sourcing of raw goods for the combined company (I'm thinking capsicums, mustard seed, tomato products, vinegar, onions, garlic, salt, etc). The main complaint and negative that I can find comes down to the increased interest expense on the debt and their use of variable rate term loans for roughly $1.5 billion of the financing split evenly between 3 and 5 year structures. The remaining financing ($2.5 billion) comes through fixed-rate notes offered in 5, 7, 10, and 30 year issues. These will become fixed expenses for the duration and are predictable. I am baffled over the use of the variable rate term loans for the first portion especially in this environment where it is nearly guaranteed that rates will head higher if not in the next year then certainly in the next 3-5. This posses a serious handicap on future earnings as any benefit from increased volume/mix/margins could actually be moving in lockstep with increasing rates and higher interest payments. Granted, the full year 2017 results might come through at higher run rates and mute the impact somewhat. Further, under MKC leadership the added brands will have significantly expanded sales channels to global customers (though this adds back increased FX headwinds). If MKC can get enough traction and drive sales growth on this new asset, they could get the entire company back onto the higher growth trajectory. This would provide enough free cash to pay off the term loans and reduce their interest expense drag by potentially $46 million for full pay-off at the starting interest rates (750 at 2.9% and 750 at 3.25%).The numbers still make sense. The added EPS growth will come from them shifting excess cash from buybacks (which they have already announced) and toward the repayment of these term loans. Added back $46million to the bottom line on 133.3 million shares out following the secondary adds $0.34 to EPS ($8.16 to the share price at 24x)."
"I don’t understand why price has declined last several days. Perhaps it’s because price is strong already, so short term players aren’t playing. If a long term player who buys a lot wants to get in because they see it as a long term win prospect, then they’ll be glad to buy in at this price."
I don't know what time is earning today . I saw it went down now it's where it was from yesterday closed ?
By noon it will go back to 190.
a good one to be in as many are cooking from home and learning... but over-priced (IMHO) at +33 PE.I'll take SYY under $20 PE with upside as things come back or they start looking to new supply opportunity
Any chance of a split as we get over $200?
had this since it was $35 been living on dividends for a few years now very comfortable too
UL getting bought out. More consolidation in this space. I think MKC would be a better fit for KFT IMHO
Can’t be sure til next week but Thursday was a possible bull trap. VP exercised options too so possibly thinking that it was near enough to a top. Careful out there peeps. Protect your investment. Take profits or cover if you must!

Did they talk about it on CNBC I missed it ?
Samuel I’m sorry but you can’t justify buying this when it was 30+ P/E at the top. You say we “can’t say for sure” but fundamentals give us highly educated guess as that is what hedges and institutions look for as well. If you can’t decipher an company through it’s reporting and figure fair value and know when buying high is too high and when you’re just joining a trend then you are gambling not investing.
The shorts are now down to 1.80% compared to 6%+ earlier this year. What does that say about the market’s view of MKC?

"There is a battle for spices in the South China Sea and deep in the mountains beyond China, in Western Tibet. Not many know about it, but McCormick is actually a subsidiary of the CIA, and the spice trade is actually a front for drug and weapons transactions that keep the world safe and full of cheap, plentiful spices. This company is actually a gray market whale worth 4.7x more than its market cap belies...think about it....spices are the most powerful item on earth"
"Earnings Tomorrow. Good luck everyone. Start to see some news on how the French's/Frank's integration is panning out alongside the new products they released over the past quarter. Most important as well is to see the effect of the lower tax rates on their domestic business considering the heft of US sales from French's/Franks/ Cattleman's and several other small brands picked up over the past few quarters: Stubb's especially, but also the industrial side operations. If tax reform gives them a cashflow tailwind, they might be able to pay down the debt load a little faster or get enough extra cash to grab a few smaller bolt-on's a few quarters earlier than anticipated. E-commerce is the one sticking point to make sure we are getting along with Amazon still. Management was quick to point out the profitable relationship with Amazon after the Whole Foods acquisition. Hopefully this has continued to blossom and we will see some opportunities for increased shelf-space in those locations. I still see this company as one of the few grocery/food names that has longevity considering the low-sodium, healthy, cost-efficiency nature of their products, in addition to their ability to produce ingredients when eating outside the home as well as for bringing home to your local pantry. Hopefully they will continue to have positive things to say-- I can't imagine the past few months of increasingly strong consumer sentiment counting against them during the holidays. Best! -Dan"
"It’s like COST. Open lower after earnings report. Then a day later, shoot up 10 dollars. If it does not get to 195 today. Hold on long, it will be $200!by Friday."
"Anybody else up early waiting for the 6:30 AM ET earnings release?? I am, looking to cash out with minimum 1K gain on my 240 shares later today, and then going long either SFIX or UNFI, both of which are reporting earnings after the close today, and I expect both of them to beat the consensus with positive guidance...Trying to decide which is the better play...I like the volatility of SFIX, but UNFI should have outstanding revenue growth. Maybe I'll split my capital and do a long play on both. But in the meantime, MKC to $166.00/shr, please. :-)"
MKC-V reached an all time high at 188.84
"For those who focus on P/E Multiple, my thoughts are these: PE is a classic measure and it's certainly relevant, but it's one of several metrics that are just as important or sometimes more important, but most importantly many metrics have to be looked at together . . . AND!!!! the strength and performance of management, historical performance, consistency, predicability/reliability in terms of performance, long term prospects, opportunities that the company has, and other factors are important to consider in making an investment decision. If PE was the end-all and be-all, we would see a market crash across the board, especially in the tech and younger/smaller-companies sectors. MKC is valued based on all of the above considerations, and obviously the market believes it scores well in many of them and hence a strong positive sentiment and hence a higher P/E."
"This morning’s drop — not-smart trade is my guess. I’m guessing that one holder of a large amount, like 50,000 shares or so, decided to cash out (probably because of big gains) simply unloaded instead of exiting methodically. MKC has been a great performing company. The stock trades in a relatively low volume, so any big market trade, whether a buy or sell, is going to impact the price immediately. A more thoughtful, patient seller would not have moved the market by 2% with a one time dump. That said, my guess is that the price will move back to its steadier level in a fairly short time. If that’s closer to $170, some buyers will be in for a gift."
Up or down for earnings?
Exdividend next week. Buy now
McCormick reached an all time high at 201.36
Headed for $150 folks as stay at home stocks will now head into a bear market
"MKC: Strong sales & profits - Upbeat earnings in Q2 - Beats Q2 forecast....all really good things, and guess what? The stock plummets at the opening, this morning. WHY???? This is why the market sometimes really frustrates me. Its like you do your home work and everything right and you still lose."
And so it begins...
McCormick is up 4.95% to 151.16
New to MKC but concerned about the debt . From what I’ve put together they had enough earning power that the debt isn’t a concern . Can someone correct me here ?
Lower expectations are easier to beat.
Look out below! Bozo the stock clown just recommended buying!
MKC reached a new All Time High at $134.50
Nobody is worried about the drop premarket on earnings ? I was never in this but bought this morning ???I didn't expect such a big drop !!!
I'm waiting could use a little cash but not bad enough to sell at this price point even though I bought mine when it was way cheaper
this is a buy for the split
"Sell? Why? Spices are essential and highly profitable commodity in these uncertain times. Could you imagine how much money powdered Tumeric, or Cayenne pepper, or Salt will be worth when China goes to war with India in the South China Sea? MKC stock is possibly worth more than Rent a Center, Sketchers, and Ollies combined! Might one day be worth as much as Coke! Yeah sell to me! Dummies. Trust me, you'll wish you were buying as much shares as me, the big boys, and the McKormic Company themselves. Price gonna be too expensive for your grubby, spiceless hands when it moves over $225 region."
52 wk high in this current climate....I love it.
"Came here because Cramer mentioned it. Its could be a really great buy soon... Ill keep it on my watch, i dont usually choose his stocks but it's not bad at all."
Tomorrow we get 2-1

some of these sales happen because government makes you sell if it's part of 401k the older you get the more they make you sell every year .reason 1 so you don't leave it to someone. reason 2 so they can take taxes on it
"Are there buried positive secrets in these string, impressive numbers?Two things: (a) commercial-restaurant business is down only 4% compared to prior year quarter that ended in Feb 2020...pre-pandemic, and (b) very big growth in Asia sales. Only 4% down from PRE-pandemic with restaurants closed or reduced dramatically....that seems like a very small decrease in relation to the decline in restaurant business in the quarter ended Feb 2021 compared to Feb 2020. And Asia growth potential ....need we say more to get the point across????Is MKC management being ultra careful or conservative in not underscoring these, even though they’ve given us the Asia growth % (but without underscoring what it may portend)? And how did they keep the restaurant and commercial business at only down 4%? Like all of you, I’m an outsider, so I don’t know the answers to these questions. It would be nice to know."

Does the company own the Kohinoor brand? It had paid more than $100M to acquire this company. The founders of Kohnioor continue to use this brand and have products competing with Mccormick.
"Market response to MKC baffles me! Blowout quarter, positive guidance, pre-market stock up 4%, and within 2-3 days the stock is down. I’m scratching my head!"
"Strong price movement. One thing I’m able to see that is different is that the short % has dropped a lot, which means the shirts have had to cover —-and since the short % was a lot higher than it is now, that would have meant a fair amount of buying. Besides that, I haven’t seen anything else out of the ordinary, except of course the pandemic....could that be the reason for the movement?"
"? as purchase includes stock, does this negate the goodwill tax write off deduction here? I had always heard that to write off goodwill in a purchase it had to be all cash or no Boot (stock). if they get the tax write off, it should be a good deal for them. Does anybody know the answer here/ ?"

MKC is up 4.90% to 105.00
McCormick reached an all time high at 206.31
why going down?
"MKC is a solid, well run, smart company. They appear to understand their customers and the markets in which they operate. Management has delivered solid and impressive performance, making good decisions at several levels. Stock price is consistent with performance—it’s a good price in the sense that it’s a strong number because it’s a string company that’s delivering strong performance. Stock price should hold and grow steadily, but not at the rate seen so far this year. Another surge in price, similar to the one that’s been experienced in 2018, would only be justified by an unusual event, like another strategic acquisition or a takeover bid by a larger company. The possibility of more smart acquisitions by management seems reasonable, as they have demonstrated excellence in this regard. I’m a hold and enjoy the solid ride."
"This company, guided by its stable leadership team, keeps on delivering and delivering. It is a great example of what focus, effort and intelligence can accomplish. Congratulations from a very satisfied and experienced shareholder."

MKC-V is up 9.42% to 116.46
"Excellent acquisition target!! Not only does this give them more market share in the space (and more mind share of the consumer), it also gives them: a new platform for flavor expansion/integration with other product offerings, and increased purchasing power for their input ingredients to keep cost of goods sold in check. This gives then increased buying power for peppers, vinegar, and glass bottles from their suppliers. Very, very curious to see what their next target might be going forward. They now have multiple product offerings in the bbq sauce space (Cattleman's and Stubbs), multiple hot sauce offerings, plus ketchup and mustard on top of their existing spice/herb/pepper offerings. Mizkan Group would be an incredible acquisition target, and likely something on the scale and breadth of the Reckitt acquisition-- vinegars, cooking wines, pasta sauces and more. All things that provide recognized flavor brands, the potential for both consumer and commercial sales, the ability to lever purchasing power for input ingredients, and more methods of cross-pollinating product lines and delivering new flavor profiles."
very expensive
"Come on folks, it's time to wake up to the good news, MKC is taking off, don't miss the rocket to @166... :-)"

The market does not like this acquisition...
Jim Cramer kiss of death sting buy for 2020 on his show
What are some other spice companies other than McCormick?
Missed the boat on this one.
"The more the restaurants open, the better for mkc business, I suspect. I wonder, however, what the net change will be during this winter due to (a) more restaurant openings (maybe), but (b) colder weather that will keep more people from dining out?"
"At recent price levels, MKC is a great buy, likely a steal!Think about it—the economy is reopening and that trend is going to accelerate in the next few months. Restaurants are reopening and that will accelerate with the pandemic easing and warmer weather coming. MKC products will sell much higher this spring and summer vs 2020!!!And, over the past year, more people have come to use and enjoy MKC products at home. It doesn’t take much to see what lies ahead. All of this, on top of a management team that has a great track record. Not to sound too pedantic, but duhhhh."
220 today? I feel something good coming
"Potential acquisition for MKC.... Armanino Foods of Distinction, Inc. (AMNF)? Constructive thoughts?"
Nice watching MKC today.
"I have been following this company for years. I have been an investor for years.This has been, and still is, a solid and reliable company. They keep up with the times, they don’t just rely on their historical performance, they add new products, they update their systems, they remain modern. They also make smart, insightful acquisitions, with a successful history of integration and growth.The investor market has recognized that by rewarding the company with a high multiple on earnings. However, the company has lived up to those expectations, and therefore the market has continued to see the company in that light. If you look at the stock trading history, you see that from time to time the price moves down for no reason, like today – except that an individual at UBS decided to say the price is too high end and then the stock price returns to where the market believes it should be, which is at the levels of the past few weeks endin the $170 price level, approximately.Institutional investors like this company, and today is an excellent opportunity to increase their holdings. I already have a lot, it is my highest holding in a thoughtful portfolio, and I am happy and comfortable with my holdings.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"

"Hm, what’s going on?"
"wow....spices? Who'd a thought this would be so lucrative??? I mean.....I grow my own herbs in my backyard rather they paying for store spices....but yes, I do still buy some store spices....but its not like I go through them in a week or anything like that.....anyway....enjoy the ride...."
Pleased that the stock has recovered. The $500 million equity portion of the deal was disclosed when the deal was announced. That would seem to have informed Mr. Market that there would be dilution to existing shareholders but when the offering was announced yesterday some trading programs suddenly swung into action. The longer I am in the market (over half a century) the dumber it looks. If only someone could harness the stupidity we would all be rich. The deal is expensive but as a long term investor I am inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to management.

"Nothing wrong with MKC look at their 10 and 20 yr charts. This company for the most part beats earnings and its a consumer product everyone buys and has in their kitchens. so don't fret buy on dips. Buy, Buy Buy!"
Really bad looking balance sheet. Negative net tangible assets. Lots of Goodwill and tons of debt. The earnings are not high enough to justify the debt load. Lots of these big brands are going to recognize that the debt is not always worth the small pickups in earnings. Look at Kraft Heinz trading for a third of what it did a couple years ago. Here we have a spice company trading at 4X Revenue NOT earnings. Will go much lower.
"MKC is a very well run company, but it doesn't deserve the multiple it's currently trading at. The forward P/E is between 22-25 depending on where you look. The tepid outlook is bringing this down to more reasonable levels, but it's not a buy until it's back down near 52 week lows of right around $100 per share in my opinion."

doing its slow and steady thing
Got in at 185 finally. It will turn around the rest of the day. Maybe at 193 again by the end of the day.
McCormick reached a 52 Week low at 137.01
"I plan on holding MKC for the long term, but if there was ever a stock that made sense for Buffet's Berkshire portfolio, it's MKC. With that said, the deal would likely be pursued by Kraft Heinz which Buffett owns close to 30% of. I hope it doesn't happen, but I think it could at some point. I wouldn't mind Buffett purchasing outright, but have no interest being under the Kraft Heinz (KHC) umbrella."
Anyone here? This is a good stock and interesting company.
McCormick is down 8.51% to 123.51
"BUY SPICES!!! More valuable than wheat, soy bean, cotton, and rubber combined! This is how money is made folks. Uncorrelated risk in the spice markets. Economic troubles in the broad markets means spices are worth more money every day. It appreciates in value as you appreciate its remarkable flavor. We can't underestimate the value here in MKC. This company can easily be worth $300 in 2020...lots of upside and spicy trades in future."

"It’s interesting and nice to see how mkc has held up at the price level of $155-$160+ for a good deal of time. It makes sense, considering that it’s stable, consistent and forward-looking. The company should perform well with steady increases, so it will grow into its multiple. However, I suspect it’s people’s hope and even exportation that the company will do some acquisitive work to boost-accelerate an otherwise smooth and steady growth. Let’s see!"

So from June 2018 until Nov 2018 MKC sold 50% more #$%$ and that's why the price rose by 50%? In six months they managed to increase their numbers by 50%. Really?!!! Overinflated and waaay overbought.

McCormick reached a 52 Week low at 129.13
"Shorts are down to 1.85%. They used to be 6%+. Given the consistency of performance, advancements of the company, and continuity of management—this is not a good short play. The earlier shorts discovered that the hard way. The current shorts are either computers that don’t reason or gamblers playing with other peoples $$$."
"Dividend raised to $2.08. Just shy of the $2.09 at the high-end of the range I pointed out 4 months back. Looking good so far. Just need to get some solid EPS results into the historical data to bring down the P/E a bit. Notice this is trading sort of rough, but showing solid consolidation around the $100 level while other food stocks (CPB for one) disappoint. It gets hit when people sell off food and/or defensive consumer names. But it is not collapsing. P/E staying high (and should come down a bit as the EPS rises). Looking against the out year predictions of $5+ EPS and you get a P/E in the 20 range vs. historic average in the mid-20's.Looking out to other acquisitions or business expansions... I would really like to see them move more into Indian products for US market to stay in line with demographic changes. They already have Asian, Hispanic, and most European cuisines covered. Indian and other Pacific cuisine additions would be interesting... as well as African to bring something home from Ethiopian restaurants and others. I would really like to see future acquisitions focus on USD denominated sales to mitigate their growing FX headwind that has hit them in the past. Domestic sales combined with any type of new tax package will help propel the profitability to all new heights."

"Mkc is a great long term, safe position. Excellent for institutions and smart, thoughtful investors. The company has good, well-positioned and sustainable products, a strong track record, and effective, proven management. What more could a long term or even short term conservative investor reasonably ask for? The results of my strategy for mkc has resulted in my holdings of this position being disproportionately high in my portfolio. We should all have such problems!"
MKC-V reached a new All Time High at 109.33
"How to trade this stock: buy and hold it!!! If you’re interested in stable long term growth, this is a good choice. If you’re a trader and trying to make a quick score, look elsewhere. I’m interested in where this stock will be a year from now, not just this afternoon. I’ve been in this stock for about four years, increasingly so, and the results have been excellent. Stay safe in health and investments."
MKC is the perfect acquisition for Kraft Heinz. Dont know what they are waiting for.
HUGE upside as home cooking takes off and will continue through next year until herd immunity sets in which may take another year and a half.
"***Speculation Alert**Hain Celestial breaking off protein division ahead of potential sale of company. I hope they break off Celestial Seasonings-- that would be an incredible fit for MKC. They already source and sell most of the same herbal ingredients. They could buy in greater volume at lower prices and have two aisles to sell herbs and spices!They mentioned Unilever as potential buyer of the company, but they have Lipton. I don't think anti-trust would allow them to control two of the largest tea brands in the U.S."

"The shorts in this stock are gamblers, of which there are plenty in the overall market. This company is a longer term investment, and it seems odd that short players would be interested...must be players on the spectrum. They’d have to be meticulous in their timing, which is unlikely given the unpredictability of the short term movements in stocks generally. It’s sounder to okay long term, which for this company is the right position."
Anyone here? This stock has been a great performer.

McCormick is down 4.97% to 179.29
"Surprising that the short ratio in MKC is higher than I would have thought. Institutional ownership is high, almost 90%, and the business seems reliable and on a good track. I don’t understand why there would be higher short positions."

"If you want to be in the market in this rough time and what you want is a good company in which to invest, this is a good choice. 2020 will be a strange one for the history books for most companies, some much more than others. This one will be in the less affected."
