Recent headlines and conversations for INTC
why is this so cheap
Buy baby buy
"marketwatch has story ""Micron drops memory tech that Intel gave up on two years ago"". I wonder what that means for Intel's Optane plans..."
Intels antique FABs broken 10nm and now broken 7nm?
Whats the trading pattern from here? Small bounce and then the inevitable 2nd and 3rd test of the Friday bottom? My guess is it will eventually trade in the 40s before serious buyers come back in. Just dont know how big the bounce will be in the next week or so.
INTC goes down 15% on record earnings AGAIN.....meanwhile BB (Blackberry) is soaring on no business......
$55 today anyone?
Lemon head active with FUD today. Ryzen castrating him.
$61 today... even CSCO has PE of 18 after years of sales down.
Congratulations Longs!
Told you to take your profit and run for the hills. You gave up most of your gain now.
Great Read this weekend for all intelligent Investors to consider going from $INTC to $AMD - the price for AMD will never be this low after AMD earning Tuesday. Good Luck to All! John / OsulinFOOL / braccrapus - you can keep trying to be positive but Intel is just too far behind AMD and it’ll take 3-4 years to compete while AMD takes market share and is in hyper growth mode! Enjoy the weekend I know I will :)https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/intel-vs-amd-ces-2019/
"Your company literally just had to doctor/forge the benchmarks on it's ""new"" CPU to even compete with an offering from a competitor that is literally a tenth of it's size."
"No reason for pre market movement other than it is generally hedge funds trying to ""prime the pump"" and manipulate the stock higher into the regular trading day."
Told you longs $59 by Friday!!

"One Week Notice! Read between lines Mr. Murthy Renduchintala is leaving on Aug. 3 with just 1-week notice.If you work in the US, you know the minimum industrial standard is “two weeks’ notice”. Especially a huge company prepare some kind of package just to show generosity/good faith, and confidentiality agreement, etc. Mr. Renduchintala’s sudden departure is not a good sign if it is not fire Inside Intel. He only worked for Intel for 4 yrs. It is easy to blame product development delay on him, but 10nm and 14nm delay happened without him before he got Inside Intel. We will see massive layoff from this company. Will you be able to focus on your work remotely if you work for them? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-chief-engineering-officer-leaving-210841041.html"

This thing is sinking faster than Mango Mussolini's casino investments.
"Bernstein Stick to Their Sell Rating for IntelDec 21, 2020 09:00AM ET Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon maintained a Sell rating on Intel on Monday, setting a price target of $40, which is approximately 15.72% below the present share price of $47.46.Ouch---losing big time are you Stacey?"
"How big will 5g, apple modems, integrated gigabit wifi, optane and china fpga datacenter be over the next year. All amazing stuff AMD does not have. In fact, Intel has their own wafer processing, while AMD has to pay for it. How much is that worth to Intel customers?"
New CEO is the OLD CEO -> How innovative Intel is...No one wants the job I guess.New kid on the block has arrived...and it's AMD & you can't just brush aside AMD as in the past...

"No straight line up in semis. Doesn't work that way. INTC's 10nm however is no joke. They likely will sell more than expected, especially with Asia now entering recovery."

"wonder if Dan Loeb, Third Point, is unloading his INTC stake? These hedge fund managers can move markets and they usually set themselves up to do so - buy a bunch of stock and a ton of out of the money calls.....write some in the money puts and then BOOM say you want a ""strategic review"" and the stock price pops...gives the volume to unload and make a handsome $10's of millions of dollars. It is a great business is it!!!"
See if this CEO is willing to innovate and not be complacent. Lost its crown in 3 years by some company that wasn’t even close.
"You can pump all you like. But I feel like that the AH market has rendered its judgement on INTC for the next quarter -- hesitation (or wait to see the stock market tomorrow). This does not looks encouraging, to say the least.."
"You Republicans always believe Fox news correct ?100% Fair and Objective right ?Now read this and tell me what you think..Patches, in order to mitigate the vulnerability, can slow things down. That’s because the fix in effect, plugs the vulnerable processes that would otherwise boost performance.Though many processor-intensive operations are not noticeably affected based on testing so far, that's not always the case. PC World saw a few cases of disk slowdowns on a Microsoft Surface Book after patches were installed. For one operation, storage drive performance dropped off as much as 26 percent and 42 percent for another.Tests done by Techspot on Jan. 7 saw a five to eight percent reduction in some disk operations while other so-called 4K disk writes saw a 20 percent hit after patches were installed. And a 512K write test logged a 41 percent performance hit.Meanwhile, Microsoft has stated in a blog post that a “variant” of the fix – which patches both the operating system and the processor’s microcode – results in performance degradation.Older systems appear to take the biggest hit. http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/01/19/to-fix-spectre-meltdown-threat-it-isnt-always-pretty.html"

"So as we look at 2019, across both client and data center space, we feel very good about the product competitiveness of our 14-nanometer program. And that, to some degree, is factoring into our timing of 10-nanometer and launching 10-nanometer at a point in time where we believe the yields are at a level that make it prime for volume production. So 14-nanometer, I think through the rest of this year and through 2019, continues we believe to drive product leadership across all our portfolios in clients and server."
"Intel's gains are very temporary. It isn't worth a $250+ billion value because they can't handle what's coming. If you're holding Intel bugchip stock over the weekend, it won't be good for your finances. Market conditions are about to get a lot worse. $amd $nvda"
"AMD has 100% more upside guys, beleive me I'm a pumper. Joking of course, Intel is clearly the better buy with more upside now. Let's say you have a chocolate bar and it's intrinsic worth is 1$, buying AMD is like paying 150 times the intrinsic price and buying Intel is like paying 1.5$ for the chocolate bar. This only matters when the hype market stops and the people are wondering why they paid so much for a company that's not worth that price. Intrinsic value is MOST important when the correction hits Intel has clearly got more upside. Buy Inteeeeeeeel!"
Confirmed breakout??? What do you think?
If you guys are smart AMD is a good buy instead of intel. AMD is taking over the market and will soon make intel drop. More opportunity for your own growth.
Intel Chip supply shortage is going to ease sooner than expected IMO. Without this Apple 5G modem supply to worry about. Also there are still lots of smartphone makers aside from Apple looking to have 5G modems by next year. Intel can start slowly as a first timer.
Even GM is 52 already.. you people are to harsh on INTC
Lenovo's web site has a page to tell consumers which CHIP to buy in their laptop AMD or INTELYou would expect since lenovo sells far more Intel chips than AMD they would steer customers to INTEL but guess again..That tell you something as intel is 20 times the size of INTC and this is not related to the Meltdown issue that only affects intel chips..LOOK IF YOU DARE !
"Dragging the whole semiconductor/chip market down. Better times ahead, despite their outsourcing needs and decreasing cloud revenue. Surprised they aren’t partnering with an EV company as MSFT and NVDA have already done so.."

"20% revenue growth and a PE around 10? For comparison purposes, AAPL is expected to post negative revenue growth and sports a PE near 30. big boys gonna take it up tomorrow, plus its options expiration so lots of $$$ at stake. I like it for a bounce to $58 at least especially if market bounces hard tomorrow. no way they let this hold the DOW back, remember Trump watches the DOW he will give the order to buy it up to turn the market green!"
$63 now and still going north!
Merry Christmas! Happy holidays!
While Intel is farting AMD is rocketing nibbling aggressively at its data center market share.
$INTC Rocket Lake Hottest Single Core Performance Ever ... Yet another 14nm part - How Exciting is that? $INTC should do a roadmap of Single Core CPUs - forget about multi core CPUs - who needs Multicore. All the better games performs best in single core - right...intel? Next intel CPU - 5% better in single thread and the one after ... may be 3% better single thread and cost an arm and a leg!Give me Ryzens - thank you AMD for making X86 CPUs exciting again!
Im amazed.. it is going to keep dropping. The street REALLY hates this stock.. wow 56.12
"Again we see big FUTURE intel cpu launches 2020 using 14 nano ! $intc If 10 nano was working why would you launch a ***10th** generation 14 nano NEXT YEAR ?I am waiting for answers from intel investors...Here’s What We Know of Intel’s 10th Gen Comet Lake-S Processor So FarThe Coffee Lake-Refresh series successor would be the Comet Lake-S lineup which would feature 2 core, 4 core, 6 core, 8 core, and 10 core SKUs. All of these processors are based on the same 14nm architecture which we have seen since Skylake so not much to change there except the improved process node which should deliver better clocks.The Comet Lake-S family is scheduled for a consumer launch in Q1 2020<—-2020 still on 14 nm? and a commercial launch in Q2 2020. The Comet Lake-S family would be featuring higher TDPs than current Coffee Lake CPU family and would feature higher clocks too over their predecessors so expect clocks range around the 5 GHz mark. The 10th Gen family will be branded with the Core i*-10*** series nomenclature and will be featuring support on the new 400 series motherboards. We should get a taste of some early motherboard concepts at Computex 2019.https://wccftech.com/intel-comet-lake-s-10-core-cpu-400-series-motherboards-new-lga-socket/amp/"
TSM is almost 600B market cap.. INTC is traded at 240B... so undervalued.
Intel should increase the prices for their chips. They have a virtual monopoly.
"I'm now wondering if Loeb's motive here is nuanced. He sent a similar letter to Disney and then got credit for their turnaround, which another poster admonished me he had nothing to do with. Maybe he see's a turnaround in the offing for INTC already and he is piling in, later to claim some credit along with his profits."
"Intel introduces new six core I9 processor for laptops. Speeds could exceed 5GHz. These are targeted for content creators, video editors and gamers. In testing the core I9 showed a Geekbench 4 score of 25,915, the highest the testers had ever seen on a notebook. The I9 is designed for a 45 Watt TDP. This product shows how difficult it is for Apple to move away from Intel CPUs for MACs. Most people I know that use MACs are content creators or video editors. Apple would do itself servere harm if its premium MAC lineup is less powerful than widely available and more affordable PCs with Intel CPUs. Further, Apple has to know that instruction emulation would generate a meaninfgul hit on delivered performance for any alternative CPU. And lastly, Apple's video editing software Final Cut Pro used lock video editors to MAC purchases years ago but not any more. Competing offerings that run on Windows are far more attractive today."

"Are you Intel fans aware Intel is going to lose their #$%$ due to the lawsuits brought on by Netlist (NLST) IP being infringed upon by INTC? Among others who have also lost ALL their court appeals in this ten year old court battle are: google, sk hynix, micron.The smart ones among you INTC fans will dump INTC and buy the winner in this market. You want to be on the right side. NLST stock will be a historically HUGE settlement Intel, google, micron, sk hynix are thieves and their misdeeds are now going to be made public and soon NLST will be traded on NASDAQ. The overseas market is now learning about this and are hopping on board.The smart money is about to surge the stock price.google: Intel, google, micron, sk hynix are now in the PENALTY PHASE of a ten year long court battle with NLST.Funny you can google Google to learn google are thieves. lol"
"Jim Cramer just came out with his expert analysis on AMD's earnings.......""WOW....I guess I was wrong.....AMD is really just a ""pimple"" on INTC's behind."""
"Missed on data-center which is supposed to be the great growth engine. Adds credibility to the story that AMD is going to take a big bite out of future revenue along with Nvidea. Even though guidance is strong, Intel doesn’t have great credibility due to it basically lying about when 10nm will be ready, if ever.If you’re a holder, work out for yourself when 10nm will be ready (not before 1h2020 for sure) and make your investment decisions accordingly."
"Got to give it to the shorties, they trying hard. LOL"
At what point will Intel and AMD's share price meet? At $35.00? At $40.00? By mid-August? By November? Any guesses?

"Have a good weekend everybody, we'll continue ascending next week. Volume was 50% above daily average. Compare with $IBM at 7x daily average with a 10% drop - very significant and catastrophic to go lower next week, or $intc at 2X daily average volume, 10% down - has more downturn to go next week too, as volume is meaningful, AMD goes up nice and steady to break $100 after the ER next week. Imagine the analysts upgrades in contrast to IBM, Intel and other semis outlook for the year. ... !"

"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will consider whether to declare unconstitutional a system that technology companies, including Apple Inc. and Google Inc., have used to invalidate hundreds of patents and head off litigation.In an argument at the intersection of intellectual property and the separation of powers, the justices on Monday will consider a challenge to a congressionally-created board that critics have dubbed a “death squad” because of its tendency to toss out patents.The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has invalidated more than 2,000 patents since it began work in 2012. Apple says it alone has used the board to successfully attack almost 200 patents, many held by entities interested only in filing lawsuits and extracting royalties. Congress set up the board, known as PTAB, in 2011 as a faster and cheaper alternative to litigation.But some smaller inventors see a chance to undercut the board, saying it’s become an anticompetitive tool for large companies.The case “has the potential to shut down the PTAB, if only for a moment until Congress can do something to get it back on course,” said Jim Carmichael, a former PTAB judge and now managing director of Carmichael IP. “For many inventors and patent owners, that’s a very exciting prospect.”At issue is whether more than 250 PTAB judges are serving in violation of the Constitution. The federal appeals court that handles most patent disputes said the judges have important enough powers that they need to be appointed directly by the president.Should the Supreme Court agree, it could go as far as barring the board from continuing to review and invalidate patents. The justices could also issue a more limited ruling that would strip the judges of their job protections but leave the board’s powers intact. Either way, a decision against the board could mean that hundreds of cases would have to be reconsidered."

"There is no doubt that AMD is going to hurt Intel in 2019. But, will the hurt on Intel necessarily translate into higher earnings for AMD? No, I think not.AMD, IBM, Qualcomm, Google, Apple, NVidia, Huawei, Microsoft, Micron and yes even Intel are dependent on a company called TSMC.TSMC has grown to be the only viable supplier of advanced node semiconductors to the information industry. Many of the companies I mentioned above with the possible exception of Intel, have viewed moving to more advanced nodes as the easy way of gaining a competitive advantage in the market place. This makes TSMC a monopoly.Now, this monopoly is nothing like the past monopoly’s we have read about in the past, the likes of Standard Oil Co or U.S. Steel Co. It is different principally, in its cost structure. Past monopoly businesses were good at obtaining exclusive access to what everybody wanted at low cost; TSMC has exclusive access to what everybody wants (computing power) by pushing the limits of physics at very high cost.In the third quarter of 2018, a total of 18 percent of TSMC production was on the 10nm and 7nm node. This is before TSMC getting into the very messy business of producing EUV chips. It is the place no foundries in its right mind would want to go to. It is the place where yields are low, costs are high and most importantly, the place where most customers of TSMC, will be content with, for a very short time.This brings me back to my starting point. If AMD is able to gain any traction in Intel’s markets, it will have to share the bounty with a company that is its only viable supplier. A supplier, that has earned its place at a very high cost. TSMC is no position to give discounts to AMD, just to see it take out Intel.Given the slowing demand for semiconductors by the likes of Apple and Nvidia, and the shortened lead times at TSMC; AMD may not have to wait for long for its chip supplies, but it better pray that the demand for the likes of the iPhone’s don’t pick up any time soon."
still long WFC.Still long EWY and EWJ.add AAPL shorts for hedge.

"To understand the importance of POWER management not just for laptops, but especially for BIG MULTI CHIPLETS EPYC, check hiring position AMD has posted bellow. Remember a core in a multi core EPYC may be waiting on outside events. So its power budget isn't used fully and could be reallocated to a core that needs highest single thread performance! Do you understand how big this is for 7nm+ and 5nm EPYC and Ryzen? POWER WILL LIMIT THE CORES PERFORMANCE! SmartShift kills Intel and nVidia! Remember this post as $intc and $nvda will bust when this obviously patented technology is understood better.

"eweek has positive article on Swan ""2020 and CEO Bob Swan's Impressive Year at Intel """
"I expect Intel to warn this quarter ie lower guidance they are already selling off parts of the business like Wind River systems and they are paying the salaries for their 12.5 Billion dollar acquisition of MobileEye that is doing nothing but draining money from earnings. Now the CPU business is the big one and because of the meltdown flaw that is unique to Intel CPUS and the fact it will not be repaired for several quarters I can see a significant percentage of customers delaying their purchase of Intel XEON servers and even regular mobile CPUS until this flaw is corrected in the hardware.How many of you would buy an intel cpu before it is repaired late in the year.So remember INTEL was 33 before this big run up almost as if funds have run it up so they can get out at the highest prices before the warning. And remember AMD is agressively taking market share from Intel they started at the workstation and grew market share from 8 to 12% in the last quarter alone in February launched mobile processors to compete with Intels high margin notebook business and they are making big inroads in the server area where their chips have the highest levels of performance and lowest cost and are not subject to the performance robbing meltdown that is workload dependent and much more likely to have severe performance problems in the cloud and virtual server environment where there is a lot of data io, system calls and context switching. In addition AMD is a launching a complete refresh Ryzen CPUS on April 19th on 12 nano with up to 18% improvements in performance and intel has nothing to compete with them as I explained.So don't be surprised to see Intel warn and this stock take a real hit when they report earnings in a few weeks.I suggest you buy some AMD to balance out your risk most won't listen but AMD is 10.04 now while intel is 50.47 lets see where they are in a few weeks and months.."

"Even though the Spectre/Meltdown exploits are not a result of design flaws, the remedy could have some performance cost depending on one's workload. Although most PC users won't notice the difference it is likely that the Spectre-Meltdown will encourage owners of PCs older than three years to upgrade those systems ahead of schedule producing a revenue lift for 2018. In laptops and 2-1s the case is particularly compelling because of the 30% overall performance gain of the new quad-core Kaby Lake CPUs. In desktops moving from a quad-core to a six-core i8700K easily compensates for any performance hits related to Spectre & Meltdown remedies. Although different from the enormous sales spike of the late 90's Millenium bug Spectre-Meltdown is likely to also produce some accelerated buying this year. Analysts seem really slow to understand the effect this event will affect PC replacement behavior, particular for older machines."
$54 closing.. Here we go.. Investors realize that All that AMD hot air getting no where.
"MSFT game console needs more parts from $AMD, according to techradar article ""Microsoft has asked AMD for help in combating Xbox Series X stock shortages"". All AMD has to do is tell TSMC what they need and then wait for TSMC to ask Apple if they can have some of their wafer starts."

this seems like a great time to migrate to the winner of the sector. AMD.
"Yeah manWhy is everyone leaving Cali, Illinois, and NY?Great all dem governments.Joe is heading us to recession."
Despite being in the almighty Dow propped index intel is red pre market. This indicates disappointment with its 9th generation of a seriously security flawed 14 mm cpu that implies more trouble with 10 nm production. Amd is cranking out tens of millions security hardened 7nm cpus. These can by a simple startup configuration parameter completely encrypt all data within the cpu a feature not available in any intel cpu and surely a requirement of the 10 billion dolllar Jedi contract to be announced shortly. My bet is on msft because it’s a Dow stock and because the pres does not like Amazon’s ceo.. I’m any event any 10 nm cpus intel manages to produce will be desktop and notebook only leaving the 5.1 billion dollar  per quarter high margin datacenter server business fully available to a company that had a total revenue of only 1.4 billion enabling a 200% or 300% year over year revenue gain easily attainable... this is why i encouraged intel investors to reduce their risk by buying Amd stock to ensure they have the entire x86 cpu market covered and even intel’s former ceo  tried to warn them and lost his job for saying Amd likely to gain 25% of the datacenter server market..$intc

"March 23rd os when $intc dives after announcing a long painful and costly road to turn around its major failures. Look at IBM going through the same path and still not done. Fabs will be sold, taking a hit lose on capital investment. IBM had to ""sell"" its failed fabs too, actually paying for Global Foundries to agree to take them! Intel's fabs are in a bigger mess. So much behind TSMC and Samsung even Global Foundries that it's pointless to keep pouring billions in a hopeless attempt to just catch up. You do not want to hold Intel's shares ahead of this.

stock up on this now
TSM stocks already priced in INTC using its chips.. Look at all news media pumping like no tomorrow
$INTC has huge legal and reputation risk that will likely put the brakes on their product channels. $AMD opportunity of a lifetime.
Listen intel longs don’t fall in love with a company or the stock. AMD is a real threat and is releasing 7nm chips next week. This will take market share away from intel. At best intel stock goes to $51 this year while AMD will pop to $50. More money will be made on AMD stock. So sell intel buy AMD now.

Holy carp! The volume on Nokia is over 600 million. Let’s hope the feds and MM’s can out pump the Reddits. Glad to see Intel survive and strive today... but there’s a big hand grenade about to go off. Let’s avoid being collateral damage
Intel trade $46 while AMD trades at $95 and NVDA at $534 and yet Intel’s net income is twice of the combined AMD & NVDA. This is foolishness... Intel will be at $75 soon.
"Dear 7nmMaybe you are right that Intel stock will be a good short play into jan but I doubt it.First, this quarter--Intel did not miss the estimates. We know this because Intel would have already warned by now if it were going to miss. We are entering the silent period before the end of the quarter and no warning has come from Intel.Now about your saying the China trade war would hurt Intel. That would be true if China had another alternative other that the two American CPU makers but it does not. It will keep buying from Intel and AMD. Now about AMD. Yes AMD has taken some market share but it is short term and by mid year 2020, Intel will be taking that share back. 10nm chips are being shipped in volume by Intel and by late 2020 Intel will ship .7nam chips.Your opinions of big bad China is far over rated. China is a good market for Intel chips but it will not be competitive in CPUs."
INTC is a huge bargain here. Shhh.... buy shares here and keep it quiet! ;-)

"Party has just started. From the press release:With today’s CEO announcement, Intel also said that fourth-quarter revenue and profits will exceed prior guidance, and the company said it has “made strong progress” on its 7 nm process technology. The company will report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 21"
"Should have never gone under $50. This is way oversold. Going back over $50.00 in the next few trading days, then $55.00 by end of August"
"The market is aching for Intc to go up. Some potential more lighter fluid coming next week. Intc ATH and a double from there. God bless Ameica, Gold bless Asian Americans."
Amd and nvidia will crush intc. The low pe ratio shows how this company lost the edge. This will be gone in a few years.

"What got lost today in the CEO news, is the fact that Intel put the bears on notice. Get out of the way. We will be reporting much better numbers."
Does anyone know what's the latest on 10nm? What was said about it in the earnings?
"Samsung and Taiwan Semi are great companies, but they are not USA companies. We don't want to go to the extreme of being completely dependent on foreign companies, that in times of crisis may not be totally reliable. Intel is making the correct decisions (new CEO & doubling down on fabrication & manufacturing) with USA security in focus, plus their own future. There is nothing wrong with limited outsourcing, but ultimately the knowledge, capacity and techniques must stay in the USA with a USA company. Intel has good competition, which forces them to be more innovative. At these prices, and at a low PE, Intel's future (both PPS & product mix) is very bright."
"While you pumpers are CEO-less and hanging onto broken record news of expanded 10 nm production, AMD just signed a huge gaming platform deal with Microsoft. You don't get paid for loyalty guys.. had a chance to make good money if you woke up and still have a chance."
$intc could see the $40s and quite soon the $30s especially after AMD's ER next week. The opposite with AMD to see $70+ after the ER and going higher from that.
"Yin and all your disciples who awaits the new born king AMD, let me ask you another question, again from someone not invested in either AMD or Intel but who as an electrical engineer with nearly four decades of experience in multiple industries to include building brownfield and greenfield plants. So let's say you do come up with the next big deal instead of the usual kinda big deal, you do realize that it has taken Intel nearly fifty years to actually build enough capacity to meet their overall demand. AMD is incapable of supplying even a fraction of the Intel end user demand even if they wanted it. So continue to believe the analysts who are walking you down the plank to the slaughter house, but why not ask that question of them. So we do now have the product that will supplant Intel from its leadership role, how do we actually build enough of that product to reach these lofty sales goals. It takes years and billions of dollars to build foundries, so you think they will be able to capitalize on this great, new product in time before Intel comes up with their alternative. I didn't want to bore you with the details Yin, but what you are saying is no different than what was said in the mid 90's, AMD did actually have products that were very competitive, but they lacked the manufacturing capacity to supply the demand, it is no different today. Maybe you should look to China to produce them? Then that would be the end of your great, new product, a Chinese chip supplier would have the same component available in six months at half the price. Good luck to you, not sure if you truly understand the dilemma that AMD has and will always have. While technically Intel is not a monopoly, the ability to create/maintain the manufacturing capacity to supply the customer demand of your product essentially creates its own form of a monopoly, it also creates that barrier to entry to keep new entrants from trying to enter the market. AMD has been just surviving now for over fifty years, they provide ""competition"" to Intel but only on the fringes, never on the mainstream."
"Blue fin said Intel is making great progress on 10nm, that was actually due in 2016. Is this what they meant by great progress?"

"There will never be a general purpose CPU design that is imprevious to all attacks present and future. Expecting such a thing from Intel, AMD or any other CPU maker is unrealistic. There is no 'fundamental design flaw', there is no bug, there is simply a new attack vector CPU makers need to consider for future designs. Every IT professional routinely patches their systems for security fixes already. This is what they do. The news media hysteria is way out of proportion on this. There wasn't even a single documented attack using these exploits. The performance cost from the fix is also a non-issue for 99% of PC users. The new eighth generation quad-core Kaby Lake processor being offered in new 2-1's deliver 30% more performance at the same price as last year's dual-core mobile processors. If you're getting 30% greater overall performance why would you have a panic attack over the loss of maybe 4-5%? Really people, get a grip.And by the way, the new Dell and HP 15"" 2-1's with Kaby Lake CPUs and integral Vega graphics are just phenomenal. Kudos all around."

These AMD fanboys have fear in their hearts. How else would one explain their incessant hate for INTC?
"Intel dominated chip manufacturing for 30 years. At its peak it was a well oiled machine - innovate and replicate - across 19 manufacturing facilities. The brightest engineers (in their 20s and 30s) became overlords. Very little fresh blood was hired. Now those brightest engineers are in their 50s and 60s. Rich and comfortable. With past-CEO Andy Grove long retired, Paranoia also retired. One word - complacency From here, Miracles can happen. But those bright engineers are not gonna go back to 90 hour work-weeks. INTC will still be tradeable with occasional spikes when management changes are announced and big words are spoken. But likely downhill from here. But don't make the mistake of buying AMD instead!"
INTC should be price at 120 if not 180

Crossing to green any moment now after hours $50 on amazon AWS cloud huge growth powered by amd. Not $intc not $nvda.
This is a value TRAP. Insider buying is not a canary in a coal mine. INTC goes the way of margins and has never gone higher than $55 for too long. It will take a year for them to turn this ship organically making chips. They are very far behind.
"theVerge has article ,""Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 will reportedly include both AMD and Intel configurations"", showing TGL chips in Surface Laptop 4."
"Looks like by the time Intel is onto 7nm ... if their timeline prediction holds ... TSM will be already at 3nm. Risk runs at half the power consumption of X86 with same capacity, probably better. MSFT, Adobe, etc ... are all pushing for Risk. Imagine what Apple will be able to do with the next evolution of the M1 dye if it is willing to cool it for desktops? How long before Dell announces it will support Risk in the laptop environment?Given the M1 dye performance from Apple my guess is that Intel's Apple business will be dead way faster than many believe.Yes, the PC business saw a lot of demand due to covid, that should trail off soon with Covid vaccine."
Intel needs more coordinated articles to pump inferior products and broken 10nm?
New technical CEO sends INTC to 120.. and still cheap...
Let me repeat. the new leader undervalued AMD $88.84 vs NVDA $516.71..................... or you can buy Intel with antique products.
"Isn’t it interesting that everyone is talking about revenues, profits, EPS, this year compared to last year, growth in this, declines in that, but no one is talking about the 7nm chip that was so much the focus of concern for analysts all last year! Intel crashed from this level last year because of a delay in the 7nm chip, but now everyone is acting like that was yesterday’s news. Yesterday, all my problems seemed so far away,… Go figure."
Don't worry collecting dividendswhile waiting for the GOOD TIMES Coming!!!
who paid $60 a share
Ok let's blow past the fact that INTC just destroyed consensus estimates lol.
"I would sell this. U think the new ceo at intel will deliver a new chip overnight?? I don’t get it, rather sell intel and buy amd! It’s too far to catch-up now"
Another Flaw found that is different from the other 2!!
"I wonder if Dan Loeb, Third Point, is unloading his INTC stake? These hedge fund managers can move markets and they usually set themselves up to do so - buy a bunch of stock and a ton of out of the money calls.....write some in the money puts and then BOOM say you want a ""strategic review"" and the stock price pops...gives the volume to unload and make a handsome $10's of millions of dollars. It is a great business is it!!!"
People are not looking for $INTC revenue or profits tomorrow. All eyes are set on only 2 things .... 10nm plan and datacenter growth (which AMD has been taking from last year). It doesn't matter if Intel made extra $5B by selling secrets or cellphones ...If the above 2 things are not clarified AMD is gonna rise even more ...

Su revealed the real-world power of the next generation of AMD EPYC by demonstrating a step-function increase in datacenter processor performance using the scientific application NAMD, which simulates large bio-molecular systems. The demonstration compared a single pre-production EPYC “Rome” processor to two high-end Intel Xeon Platinum 8180 processors, and the single next-generation EPYC processor delivered approximately 15% higher performance. By using EPYC-based systems, AMD is helping scientists to advance their research and get closer to finding the next big solutions.The AMD EPYC “Rome” processor is on track to start shipping in mid-2019."

Any new CEO would not give a webcast update if he/she had bad news to tell to investors/analysts. I think the new INTC CEO will give a very positive update on a 7 nm chip manufacturing process. Hoping to see $70 soon....

"Yield issues at TSMC are coming to roost. Making smaller and smaller chips is tough. In nanometer race, slow and steady will win the race. AMD chips are supposed to be running on chip technology two generations ahead. Yet their chips are just barely ahead of Intel chips. And TSMC customers are facing shortages. Despite Apple sales slowing, AMD can’t get chips for Xbox, nVidia chips are never on stock. Reality of TSMC 7will soon show up in the open. I hope Intel will not be foolish and start giving chip orders to TSMC before their own factories hit 100% capacity."
"Intel, TSMC supply agreement? Nah...It will be an explosive multi-layered partnership, that will be announced."
"Until Intel gets its act together, yes they can outsource until they build more factories to get their chips ready to be sold. This #$%$ that they need to depend on themselves has been going on for the last two years and where has that taken them. They are way behind AMD, Nvida and other chip companies."

"Intel will not be forced to reduce prices. Not as long as AMD and Nvidia have supply issues.While Apple has the most favored customer status at TSMC, no such luck with other customers. All efforts to pull away from the Intel sphere of influence by Intel deserters will be hampered by the lack of supplies elsewhere. The treat of pulling away from Intel will be far less effective in negotiating pricing terms with Intel. TSMC will need Intel's help in staying on the good side of the American and the Israeli governments. Staying on the good side is good for doing business in China. Intel will be a high priority TSMC customer, perhaps at the expense of AMD and Nvidia."
"Intel 30% yield ! $intc“AMD Zen 2: Production yields for Ryzen 3000 Dies at 70 percent “by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 04/22/2019 08:08 AM | source: bitsandchips | AMD Zen 2: Production yields for Ryzen 3000 Dies at 70 percentWhenever you fab a wafer with CPU/GPU dies (or whatever they are fabbing), there are always defects. So if a wafer has 200 CPUs dies and 50 are functional, your yield is 25%. Well, the yield of the Zen 2-cores should be good, roughly 70 percent of the chips are fully functional. When AMD started original ZEN at 14nm, that was number was 80%, so they are not that far off in this early stage of fabrication. in a report from bitsandchips that number is 70 percent, which is not perfect, but good. The site relies on ""unspecified sources"" though, but has been proven reliable in the past.The small die size of the Zen 2-core is estimated to be 88 mm² and seems to be the helping factor opposed to designing big monolithic chips. For example, Intel's XCC-Die with 28 cores, according to chatter, for a fully functional chip shows only 35 percent in yields. If you keep that thought in mind, the upcoming Threadripper also would yield at 70% as it uses the same CPU dies added together in a chiplet design. So that's twice the yield of Intel.Unfortunately, there's no official word on clock frequencies and prices just yet, we can't wait to hear the official announcements, which are expected at the AMD keynote starting at Computex late in May."

This is a fraud stock. Buy AMD and thank me later.
Why doesn't INTC venture and buy an exemplary cybersecurity company? They could scoop up FEYE for example for less than $50 a share. Or buy up a RF company. Lot of synergy companies and you are actually buying trained tech employees who could continue to keep you as a leader in the chip industry.

"Sold this morning at 59.60. bought in December at $47. Planned to hold for long term, but I made in one day what I thought would take years to get to with Intel. Might be room to run, but I see a pull back in the near term. Coming up too high too fast."
It will crash so bad AH

"MW UPDATE: Intel's Meltdown fix has bugs of its own Jan 12, 2018 04:17:00 (ET)By Robert McMillan Chip giant warns some to hold off installing chip patches after it finds 3 problems Intel is quietly advising some customers to hold off installing patches that address new security flaws affecting virtually all of its processors. It turns out the patches had bugs of their own. The glitch underscores the complexity of Intel's challenge as it scrambles to fix the unprecedented vulnerabilities (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-says-significant-progress-made-to-protect-chips-vulnerable-to-exploits-2018-01-04), which were disclosed more than a week ago. In a confidential document shared with some customers Wednesday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Intel (INTC) said it identified three issues in updates released over the past week for ""microcode,"" or firmware -- software that is installed directly on the processor. The updates are separate from patches produced by operating system companies such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Read:What can you do to protect your PC against Meltdown and Spectre chip flaws?

""Intel will provide frequent updates."" The document is being shared with computer makers and large cloud providers after a few reports that the updates appeared to cause some computers to reboot, said Stephen Smith, general manager of Intel's data-center group.

"Look at Intel's 6 month chart. It has been sliding since June 4th. They had no choice but to issue a smoke and mirrors press release where they failed to mention that all they have is archaic 10 nanometer technology while AMD has the cutting edge, state of the art, 7 nanometer technology."

"Zen 2 will be very power efficient. Money is in efficiency and ROI. We don't need more single-core performance than the i9900K which in itself was another lie/scam by $intc just to sell more CPUs. No shortage of lies from intel over past few years. Single-core performance is a self-imposed bottleneck which can be alleviated with HSA and Vulkan both of which Ryzen 3000 will be addressing, this was specifically hinted by Dr. Lisa Su herself. Nvidia benefits from single-core bottlenecks more than AMD's GCN given that GCN benefits more from bandwidth (which is why AMD developed HBM and generally has more onboard memory). Still Ryzen 3000 could likely have the highest single-core performance anyways. AMD can easily strike down Nvidia, there's literally no rocket science in Nvidia's tech as clearly demonstrated by Tesla. Intel was the bigger threat which is already taken care of. From now on it's market-share market-share market-share."

New CEO? There is very little speculation in the financial press about who the new man will be. It is almost like folks have forgotten the company is being run by an interim CEO. There does not seem to be much urgency. We are pushing five months now! I don't recall any major company in recent years having their top position open for so long.

INTC looks to go over $60 soon.
Ready for takeoff 
the best way to make money is to stay away from the stock market. So many cut throats active in the market.
"Someone needs to contact Intel Investor Relations and ask 2 simple questions:Is work on 10nm continuing? How long will you fund 10nm development in 2018?And try to get explicit answers, not misdirection and fuzzy statements. Concrete answers should be easy, if they want to answer."

Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Repeat Mantra.
GM is catching up too.But I think INTC will run pass 72 first...

"I've been waiting a LOOOONG time for this moment. The All-AMD supercomputer that powers Cray's designs. 1.5 exaflops is something neither $nvda nor $intc are capable of reaching. That's pure fact. They just don't have the scaling efficiencies to reach that number. If anything this should be casting a dark cloud on Mellanox because this is also Mellanox's turf. Omipath can't scale up either, Intel needs 10nm anyways. This is not just about Epyc Rome and Radeon, it's about Infinity Fabric and interconnect technologies with Software provided by AMD. Until competition can claim something better, as it stands today, AMD is the HPC performance leader. This same tech also applies to Data Center. If there a deal in town, you can bet that AMD will be there to eat your lunch."

"""Over the past three quarters, AMD share of processor-only instances has increased from 6.5% to 9.4% to 9.8%,"" Lipacis said. ""Intel share, while still dominant, has declined from 90.3% to 88% to 87.9%."""
The one tech stock I kept.I sold Apple yesterday (should have sold much sooner).
"Good financial result for Intel - it appears that they are still able to raise their prices and demand for the product is relatively inelastic. A few of the more recently acquired businesses appear to be adding meaningfully to the bottom line.However, there is something very troubling about the result - just look at page 10 of the press releasehttps://s21.q4cdn.com/600692695/files/doc_financials/2019/Q3/Q3-2019-Earnings-Release.pdfNotice how the unit volumes are down year on year and year to date!!?? Significantly down between 6-11%However, the average asking prices are up!A couple of points,1. When you have a competitor breathing down your neck with superior and cheaper products, you’re not going to be able to continually increase your asking prices without literally driving market share to your competitor.2. Independent research company Mercury research shows unit shipments of Desktop/Notebook and Datacenter increasing 5-10% year on year............if Intels unit sales are falling 6-11% year on year, that’s really not good......see point 1.So great financial result but looks like a lot of storm clouds ahead."
AMD #1 in CPU’s. Low price but actually AMD holds about 50\50 with Intel in the top 15. If only AMD could raise their ASP’s. Intel dominates on price.$amd $intchttps://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189

"I think Intel has been so purposefully opaque about the ""Enhanced version of Superfin"". This secrecy combined with large insider buying is very intriguing.Pat may announce as soon as Feb 15th, that the ""Enhanced"" version of Superfin may represent another leap in performance equal to another generation node advance. If what I suspect, is true, then Intel 10nm ESF in full production in 3 Intel Fabs, will match or exceed the performance of TSMC''s 5nm. Since as far as I know, Intel 10nm is still not EUV, then it should have a major cost and capacity advantage to TSMC 5nm EUV."
"OK, here's why Intel's struggles don't matter in the short term (less than 3 years). It is a MONOPOLY in PC's and Data Center Servers. Intel has had 95% of the data center market and will continue to have 95% of the data center market for the forseeable future. In PC's Intel has had 80-90% of the market forever and will continue to have 80-90% of the market.The above is true for the past 10 years and will continue to be true for the next 10.Bottom line. Wall St Hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets."
"INTC is seventh most profitable Fortune 500 company.

If you bought Intel in February 2020 you would have lost money. If you bought AMD you would be enjoying your profits on a beach in the warm weather
Cloud is the future and Intel will soon loose most of the consumers market in near future. Intel has lost the edge. Soon China will send in chips like potato  chip. Cause of recent restrictions on China they’re soon coming up with state of the art fabs so they don’t have to depend on mercy of tariffs n restrictions. There’s going to be interesting turns in 2 to 5 years. Intel will be like GE.

"It's not often that I'm right about anything in my life, but I did tell you a week ago that Intel needed to close the gap at 53-54 dollars and then that would be a good time to take a small position. And for those who dismiss technical analysis all I can say is look at today's price. Peace and Profit."
The war between modern superior secure products vs Antique inferior products. The herd can be manipulated with promises and misleading articles with so called paid experts........
"Apple boots $intc from iPhones, now Samsung uses graphics tech AMD in their smartphones"
"Loeb was wrong re INTC since day 1. Having fabs is a strategic approach in case Chinese make the move and try to cause trouble for Taiwan. Economic or military. Both would have serious consequences. No Nvidia, AMD nor Intel chips. Fabs in US are safer bet that fabs in Taiwan regardless of how much advanced they are."
This is stock that every institution owns for their clients mutual funds and etf’s.Will go back to $65 next week buy all you can!!
"First impressions of new intel CEO were extremely positive IMO. Welcome back nerdy engineer!!! Not sure why it’s tanking but don’t care, people are blind what a bargain and that call all things considered was great."

So much for so many upgrades with Intel the past few months not to mention one right before the earning to list Intel as the top pick plus the huge earning beat.
Intel is still #1 in Valuelines Divy Portfolio
"Yesterday morning I called for a change on INTC culpit in order to turn around the company's reality. I was attacked by a @JOHN Doe who in the afternoon was celebrating the 5% jump because of someone else asking the same thing i did. Way to go @JOHN, you are definitely unimpeachable :)"
Don't listen to the negatives. Based on Intel history and position within this sector this is a temporary dip. It was s inevitable that there will be a china deal. All of this can be taken many ways. Patience will pay for longs and this a free opportunity to get in at the low point. GLTA
INTC has not yet been rewarded for it's great fundamentals & earnings making it very undervalued compared to its peers IMO.
Intc might have bought back 20 million share on the cheap today.?
Going RED Again !
$80 coming...watch out!
Big tech is back....INTC better not mess it up.
Seems it cant break thru 53.80-54 ?Maybe new support at 53.60 Thought there was suppose to be a update on product Mid Jan ?

"Intel's business is hard to explain. Hard to understand. Hard to promote, and hard to rally behind. It's therefore hard to love and hard to believe in. This is also why it is so undervalued.Management, can't even begin to hope to explain it. No one in management can claim to understand it all. Very much like a people, who have lost faith in their own country. You don't explain the progress a country makes to its people. People just either feel it or they don't.In the case of a country, you bring in a charismatic leader, often a dictator, like Reza Shah, who at the very least looks like he knows what he is doing and restores faith. In the case of a company that person is the CEO.I mean you can beat on revenue and earnings, have the best chip packaging, have ample capacity, have nearly exclusive access to 3dxpoint revolutionary memory architecture designed by some acentric engineer like Nickolas Tesla, have best in class approach to autonomous driving, AI, .....and still, be not loved by the markets. I hope this new leader at Intel has the charisma to restore faith. If faith is restored, the market will take care of the stock price."

Can you imagine the upgrades coming? The combination of this new CEO and blockbuster earnings will vault us well into the $60s if not $70s.
"Lisa SuIf she were Intel ceo, would NOT sell the fabs would she.“Real men have fabs.” AMD founder Jerry Sanders made the point—in blunt, politically incorrect fashion—that maintaining control over IC manufacturing was crucial for a top-tier semiconductor company.Nov 17, 2010"
"Reported today by MacWorld that Apple is refreshing its MacBook Pro lineup with Intel's 8th gen Coffe lake CPUs. This isn't surprising as the top rated laptops already available from Dell, MSI, HP and others all use Intel's six core processors. It is nice to see Apple finally get onboard. This should be a stellar year for Intel's laptop business segment."

"So INTC beats raises the guidance and stocks up, that is good news for AMD.So INTC didn't beat and stocks down, that is good news for AMD.AMD has nothing to lose, anyway. So why you AMD pumpers/(INTC bashers) even bother spending you friking life here.That is beyond me.. Go home..The reality is that INTC still the cheapest semi-stock. and blue chip stocks.INTC deserves traded at 150 now, considering the world still running with more cores and more data."

"For centuries military ships carried no anti-aircraft guns. Were all those ships flawed? No, because the ship builders of the day had no reason to expect threats from the sky. Hundreds of years later during the birth of aviation a bi-plane became powerful enough to carry a bomb into the sky and drop it on a vessel. Suddenly the military vessels of every nation had a new vulnerability to be concerned about but that doesn't mean all the existing ships had design flaws. The ships were performing fine and exactly like they were supposed to. Armed with the knowledge of a new type of threat ship builders all around the world added new defenses. So it is with processor design and new threats. The industry will respond as needed."

AMD lost marketshare last Q and will continue to lose marketshare as Intel ramps up its production.But Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Especially those Indian Analysts.
"Pump articles don't win market share, Intel new CEO next week when he start, he knows Intel don't have credibility. 10nm for 2018, 7nm for 2019, 5G for 2020, TSMC will make 3nm while lobbying the US government tax payer $$.

what's the (good)news???
"$NVDA $AMD $INTCI just don't see how the tariff trade war will have a negative impact on the CPU/GPU companies, on the contrary, I think it should have positive impact. Let me explain.Nvdia, AMD and Intel are all American companies, so obviously U.S. is not going to hurt them. China is not stupid enough to target and hurt them either, because there is no other non-US replacement, unless they want to go back to use abacus (computer is a glorified calculator).Sure, China can impose tariff on US tech products, say Apple iPhone because they have Huawei or even Korea's Samsung for their consumers. China can also target PC makers like HP and Dell, because they have Lenovo but it has Intel/AMD/Nvidia inside. China can even target PC components like memory (Micron), disk drive/SSD (Western Digital, Seagate) because they can get memory from Samsung/SK Hinix, or disk from Hitachi, Toshiba. However, there is just no other way around for CPU/GPU.Since CPU/GPU are critically needed anyway and I can't imagine the Chinese wants to slow down to build out their data center, cloud infrastructure, super computer/HPC, AI, Smart City and etc, they can pledge to increase the purchase of ""American's"" goods, GPU/CPU, to reduce the trade imbalance and appease Trump. That is the positive impact.Don't let the pundit's ""generalization"" of tariff on tech companies/gadgets scares you. Dig deeper, CPU and GPU are irreplaceable American crown jewels."
Has anyone else heard that Intel was outsourcing to UMC?
Shorty messages increasing in entertainment value.
Goldman call to short INTC in shambles. Ouch.

I’m a buyer at $28
Got to be buying now.
"This dinosaur of high-tech company Intel at this critical juncture needs fresh-blood, bold innovators at the helm. Recycling a old Intel ""has-been"" like Pat Gelsinger and rehiring a old antique Intel chip designer like Glenn Hilton won't work.And picking a fight with a ""active investor"" like Dan Loeb won't help either.If history is a guide, having a ""active investor"" on your back, telling you what to do and not to do in every turn seldom ends up well for the shareholders.."
This was a very smart move from Intel. While other companies are going to invest heavily on mobile 5G chips with lots of competition. Intel focusing on 5G infrastructure for servers (which they already have a product). With China being banned from several countries for 5G infrastructure. Intel is going to bloom in this area. I am sure they announce this to higher their revenue guidance just a week before earning. See you at $70 next week.
I told you..
"I think all the negative talkers must be the shortsters, Intel is a good company and will rise to the challenge, they have some real smart people in R&D, they have more than just CPUs"
"If I were you I would be buying into Intel right now. Not that I really care, but these prices are about to become a thing of the past. 57.43"
Everyone on this board should look into AMD - I'm not here to bash Intel Stock - I decreased my position 75% at $54 - and still own 250 shares... AMD has great upside and I don't see this company going anywhere soon - I'm not telling you what to do - but you should do your own due diligence and look into it. I hope the stock increases though as I still have 250 shares. Good Luck to ALL
DON't sell!if it goes down I will buy more!!!
AAPL gets Qualcomm IP license and settle dispute. I told you don't get GE with Intel. Qualcomm has better 5g tech.....
"“'A Headline Negative': Intel Analysts React To Chipmaker's Exit From 5G Modems”Wayne DugganMizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said the Apple-Qualcomm deal is a modest negative for Intel.“We believe this is a headline negative for INTC as it takes out $1 billion of annual revenue in C2020 but mostly at breakeven OM, as INTC also announced its exit from the 5G modem segment,” Rakesh said in a Wednesday note. Qualcomm now has a clear runway..Raymond James analyst Chris Caso said the decision to drop the modem business leaves Intel with some difficult questions to answer.“While Intel's decision is likely to benefit costs in the near term, it opens the question about what happens to Intel's client business in the longer term, since we think all client devices will have 5G modems in the long term,” the analyst said.Intel must also soon decide whether it intends to continue its memory business as well, according to Raymond James. Ratings And Price TargetsMizuho has a Buy rating and $56 target.KeyBanc has a Sector Weight rating.Raymond James has an Underperform rating."
Sell this boomer stock before it drops again after earnings like always does and buy $GME instead.. that is where the real tendies are
Broke yet shorts!?
I bet $1 it will close GREEN
INTC = EXTREMELY STRONG BUY IMO
I bought yesturday. Intel is very underrated imho. the only stock from tech field in my account now. strongly bullish
Intel to launch massive 28 core desktop processor that will run at 5GHz in Q4. Phenomenal!
Cramer is bullish on INTC now. The man is rarely wrong. Smartest guy on the Street.
Check out the EV Sector !! Electric Vehicle industry is the new internet boom !! Click my name to see the boards. 10+yr growth sector !! there are interesting stocks symbols you never heard of and doing over 100% for this year alone.
"Beats for the quarter, raises outlook and raises dividend and down 9%. What am I missing. I think this is a good long term hold."
"Here's a classic example why financial based analysts cannot make it big in technology ahead of the time and where own deep DD understanding of the technology can beat Wallstreet. AMD obviously is an example as longs here know but the near future is more amazing for AMD yet still a miss for Wallstreet who doesn't really understand deep technology. Recent analyst research note:“In our view, 2020 appears to be a major recovery year for the semiconductor market,” analyst Harsh Kumar wrote on Wednesday. “Inventory levels are low across the board, and with a soothing trade narrative, we expect a strong pick-up in demand.”True. But then he picks the wrong winners including $nvda failing to understand how AMD's leading in CPUs over $intc will cut nVidia out as I've posted. Wait for the ER after which analysts will upgrade AMD to Buy with very high price targets. Yes including last remaining bear, Citi!By the way other articles stated this analyst is from Citi, it's wrong -showing you how sloppy those publications are. Almost tempted to short nVidia or buy puts.. lol But I'm a pure long.https://www.barrons.com/articles/3-chip-stocks-poised-to-gain-in-2020-51579119878"
Intel manufacturing is a national asset and is the BEST.
"let's see $intc, pay more for a slow CPU (xeon) or pay less for extremely fast CPU (epyc)"
INTC back to 1999 level. Just Amazing took almost 20 years.
"What analysts are saying. Basically, that Intel is a behemoth. It took over a year to find a new CEO and will take even longer to turn the ship around. But overall, they seem to welcome the change, but at the same time they are saying don’t expect to see too much change in the short term except maybe in terms of a better corporate mood."
"After dividend, this stock will go down sharply"
Intc will be from $80.00 to $100.00 per share price range within the next 34 months. Mark My Words..
"Bought at 50usd, i’m preatty confident"
"SELL, before it goes back to $46 again, You might want to￼￼ do yourselves a favor sincerely ?!￼"
I am very happy. Pat Gelsinger used to head my division when I was at Intel many many years back! He is a good guy.
Feels like something BIG is brewing for Intel.
So TSMC going to make chip for INTC in 2022..give $120 target price now.
Merry Xmas to all! 
Still not too late to buy

Intel 14nm RocketLake chips the FASTEST chips on the planet. Leaves AMD in the dust.
"an honest to goodness undervalued, high value company right here. what an opportunity. doesn't happen often. I'm riding to the $60s."
"If the shorts drop this to $53, buy more."
I wish that stocks are based on fundamentals. Life is a box of chocolate.
"don't forget, Intel has several billion dollar Fab plants that can crank out enormous numbers of chips. why is that important? Because even if they're stuck with 10 nanometer capabilities right now, they've already been involved for a while with the risc-5 architecture which is approximately 100 times more efficient in speed and reduction inpower draw then their existing x86 architecture. can you imagine the potential of flooding the world with millions of inexpensive chips with the latest processor architecture that is royalty free and can be made by Intel literally pennies on the dollar due to their existing infrastructure?what a massive turnaround that would be. Google ""risc5"".."
Only reason this pops higher (without news) is scared shorts.
"The fact is that Intel is a commodity company that responds to the market demand rather well, and while we have been in an up cycle, its not going to last forever. There have been many efforts to diversify to reduce the impact of the semi cycle, but it is still their core business. All the hype about AI and other new ventures talk about impacts to revenues in the future. They did manage to buy a fairly mature company in autonomous driving, in Mobile Eye, as they had an established product and customer base, but its a small percentage of their business. Meanwhile the hype about competitive products destrying the Intel market share continue to be touted as a threat, while thos of us who have invested over the long haul recognize it for what it is... noise that simply drones on. Andy once said if we are not making the worlds most powerful semiconductor, we are dead. That defines Intel. Invest for the long haul and collect a nice a dividend, and sleep well knowing its not as volatile as some, but don't expect it to trade like a growth stock... Its not. But when you do bid it up like it is one, I will short it because I know better."
What Intel does cannot be done by anyone else... there is a huge competitive advantage that doesn’t seem to be priced in
"No opposition to AMD, but valuations and expectations in AMD are sky-high. I believe guys who invest in AMD now will be hardly disappointed on the long run. Intel is the safest gem in tech space currently imho."
So glad I bought this stock. I'm up 20% in a short amount of time. It pays a great dividend and is a giant.
All $AMD has to do is stand back and let $INTC do it to itself.
"Given that consoles are lower than average margins, but big volume, while Q1 46% margins are without consoles but with old 12nm mobile inventory still, the only big balancing margins are datacenters GPUs and CPUs! These must be growing way more than 30%, Lisa Su said at the ER, but really a lot to balance consoles large $ revenues with lower margins! It means way more than double given the market share by mid year is 10%. So big ramping in 2H. Remember $intc has flat this year and admitted challenge in 2H! $nvda won't guide great next month either. Net... most important datacenters business is big growth revenues for amd. Huge news!"
"New CEO coming next week, Intl will be over 62."
Choo Choo that's the sound of the pain train on the way for intc. They literally don't have a properly functioning CPU to sell people and it would be nearly impossible to get one out the door in 2018. This won't blow over in a week this is a years long problem. What the value of a company with no product to sell?
Intel or TSM?
We got soming guns and new CEO...the run has begun..
"Intel shares haven't dropped as much as future earnings would indicate they should have.They're being propped up by Intel buying back shares spending overseas repatriated tax dollars (instead of spending on research).When that repatriated money runs out, and stockholders look at profit vs share price, the bottom will drop out of share price."
next stop63.50
"If you read this, note it down: Intel, VMware, RedHat (IBM, yeah I know...), #5G, #CNF. Now, think also about some huge political changes that possible to enforce buying hardware designed and built mainly in USA, EU, Canada, Australia etc... Think before you still keep on AMD, Nvidia and think deep about the global commercial changes, interdiction of certain companies to exist in top developed countries and really think where all will it be in 2,3,5,7 or 10 years from today? Now come back to the initial companies I've mentioned, think again..."

We could suspend/cut dividends, suspend/cut buybacks, and use that cash to instead recreate ASML's assets, and make the equipment ourselves! We wouldn't even have to cut down on R&D. This is a no brainer: Intel should control more of the production stream. They need to do the exact opposite of everyone else and capitalize of their short sightedness.

That, I was not expecting. So, what happened? What I think may have happened is that some investors were expecting Intel to explode in piece like GME, AMC and NOK. The reason I say that is because on the Reddit board some people were trying to build excitement and momentum into making Intel the next stick-it-to-the-man stock. When the trading session began, Intel’s price rocketed, but the volume was lackluster. Not the kind volume needed to sustain a social movement. Realizing no one was following in their lead, these pumpers bailed on Intel causing its price to give up part of its gain. Intel still might be a target of these Reddit gamers sometime in the future, but probably not until things cool down. Just my take on things"
"Intel's 10nm offers higher transistor density than TSMC's 7nm. 10nm is now being manufactured at 3 plants at full speed. ...Esfarjani also went on to explain: “10nm progress is coming along quite well. We have three high-volume manufacturing operations that are going full steam ahead to see how we can do more, better and faster, and continue to support our customers.”..."
"Again, 10nm from Intel vs 7nm from TSMC. ... Intel reports a density of 100.76MTr/mm2 (mega-transistor per squared millimetre) for its 10nm process, while TSMC's 7nm process is said to land a little behind at 91.2MTr/mm2 (via Wikichip)...."

"After Intel Corp. shares dropped nearly 19% in the past month, the chip maker announced Wednesday that it plans to spend $10 billion on its own stock by the end of the year. Shares gained nearly 4% in after-hours trading after the announcement. Intel said it would enter into accelerated share repurchase agreements as part of a plan announced in October to buy back $20 billion in stock, with one such deal guaranteeing the return of 166 million shares and the rest aiming to be complete by the end of 2020. ""While the macro-economic environment remains uncertain, Intel shares are currently trading well below our intrinsic valuation, and we believe these repurchases are prudent at this time,"" Chief Executive Bob Swan said in Wednesday's announcement. Intel has struggled with its engineering process on new chips as rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has flourished and taken market share and Nvidia Corp. has surpassed Intel's market capitalization. After closing with a 0.7% decline at $48.33, shares topped $50 in after-hours trading Wednesday."

"AMD reminds me of how Samsung became king of TVs. When Samsung first introduced its line of TVs, Sony was and has been king of this market and charged a premium for their products kinda like how $INTC has been doing for years. Then Samsung introduced products that were similar to Sony at a much cheaper price but was not quite at Sony level. This is similar to when Ryzen and Epyc first gen products came out and people and companies started taking notice and purchasing.The new 7nm products are going to be the pivotal moment like Samsung did to Sony by releasing products that are not only better, but at a much cheaper price. You guys who are over 30-40 years old know what happened and how Sony TVs got dethroned and never came back to capture or innovate the market from Samsung even till this day. Everyone here is very excited that after many years of waiting, we are invested in a company that is going to literally crush the competition. LONG FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME!!!!"

"In 1996 I correctly predicted that $INTC would fall from $75 to $50 and sold all my $INTC within $3 of a top. While waiting for $INTC to fall, I bought a high flyer, USRX, at the very top and bought more as it continued to fall. By 1999 I had lost a fortune and sold half at the very bottom. It was the most miserable 3 years of investing I ever had. I literally had panic attacks. Meanwhile, $INTC hit $50 and slowly but surely went up, splitting once or twice and the PE expanded from 10 to 50!!!This recent plunge of $INTC reminds me of those good old miserable days. Although I am hanging onto my high high flyers (I own a boatload of $NIO at $4), I have commenced accumulating $INTC below $50. I learned my lesson. Slow but sure beats high but dry."
"Going with ""Relatively Unpopular Large Companies"" is presented in the book Intelligent Investor.Sometimes the stockmarket undervalues big companies which seem to be it in this case.Investing in INTC right now is a conservative and promising move.The earnings are good but the speculation of the future is bringing them down.And as Benjamin Graham says those type of companies have the resources in capital and in brain power to carry them through it."

"Intel has been in a long term down trend, on the daily charts since January of last year. And that is before the start of the virus. Intel broke above the downward sloping trendline 8 days ago with a huge gap up. Price continued to climb upward for another 5 day before retreating to where it was before the gap up. In other words, it closed the gap exactly like I said it would. (Check my post from a few days ago if you have doubt). I said it last year, I said it a few days ago and I’ll say it again, GAPS GET FILLED! Intel’s gap essentially got filled. Now what! No one knows of course, but Intel is currently resting on an upward sloping trending from Dec. 21 until today. Unless it breaks below that trendline, it’s still a buy and hold."

Anyone here remember apple back in 2003? Everyone was ready to stick a fork in them. Could be a similar situation here.
My thought about the process competition: There must be a good reason why gap created between AMD and Intel on this. Maybe there might be reliability issues over time with 7nm that company like Intel with iconic brand cannot afford to compromise while AMD had almost nothing to lose. So may we expect this year to start seeing customers dumpong thier AMD chips and go back to Intel?

"**Special alert to help intel retailers to understand the facts ****Intel open letter says that 10 nm supposedly ready by end of 2019 but what they did not say but said in July is that it is only going to be for CLIENT ie desktoo Mobile cpus and not for Intels crown jewel the DATACENTER SERVER CPU. This is very unusual because server always gets the newest and fastest cpu. This is why AMD EPYC 7nm is going to come out for server first in early 2019.The answer to this is that the client cpus will still be the old  meltdown and other security ridden architecture if it comes out at all because intel knows it can’t deliver this old architecture to the datacenter server. Instead it is trying to buy time while former AMD Ryzen architect Jim Keller designs, develops, tests, validates, betas, vets, and finally volume produces a new mcm architecture similar to AMD’s which will take 2 to 3 years and will have to risk AMD lawsuits over patents and intellectual property rights.So think in combination witg the intel only hyperthreading foreshadow security issue that lowers Xeon performance by 30% what this means for intel datacenter sales in 2019 and 2020..“On Thursday, during the company's second-quarter conference call, Intel executives said that they would deliver 10nm during the second half, later clarifying that they would ship consumer PC systems in time for the holidays. Xeon chips manufactured on the 10nm process will soon follow, they said.”<——Server to SOON FOLLOW ? Like 2021 ?“Intel says it will finally have 10nm PC processors by holiday 2019“"

The growing demand for PC gaming is driving hardware updates."
Needham & Co reissued a BUY rating on Intel with a $57 PT.
this is going down from here. Target price 45-50.
Expanding the p/e multiple on a non growing dog getting destroyed by the competition. A dog that pays a terrible dividend to it's investors. You people are going to pay dearly again. 44.00 and lower is around the corner again believe me.
Good old stable stock no matter what market goes up or down... not for investing for money... good for dividends

Come back below 50
Intel 14nm = AMD's 7nm. Rocket lake chip from Intel proves that.AMD has to go to 5nm to beat Intel's 14nm.
exceeded Oct revenue guidance by 2.6B and eps by 42 cents
"YOU Guys should've sold at $63,and came to AMD to be sincere, you still have a choice, and a chance￼ !!"
"Over last 4 years, Apple's cumulative revenue gain was little more than 20% while profit went up by ~40%. Intel's revenue went up by more than 40% and profit by 100%. And yet Intel's PE is one fourth of Apple. In a market where 2000 PE is no stranger and semi average PE is more than 40, I simply do not understand why every one hates Intel so much.Every quarter they beat and provide upward guidance and yet its stock simply can't go up! Today they beat by 40 cents and more than $2B in revenue and yet it can't hold onto its gain.In contrast NFLX missed both profit and revenue - nonetheless it went up 15% afterwards. Can anyone explain this?"
Without trying undervalued AMD is in Tesla 2021 model S. The car industry is salivating to have modern superior secure 7nm AMD inside. While hedge fund desperately coordinating misleading articles to keep undervalued AMD down.................
youtube interview with intel tomorrow on tgl-h35The Tom’s Hardware Show 2/11: A LIVE Chat With Intel
"IT, Will Diminish Further.So, just BE PATIENT !"
Will Intel management use the manufacturing splitting as an excuse for further 10nm delay?
"Thought about articulating my thoughts in Intel GPUs about to be released next year, Xe-LP GPU in particular.First, an overview of mobile gaming market:Mobile Gaming is fastest (+24% in 2020) growing segment in gaming industry and expected to show similar growth in 2021 (as per marketwatch, link below).A big reason why mobile game revenue is expected to widen its already large lead over console- and PC-based games in 2020 is a matter of economics. Mobile phones, which serve as the primary online connection for billions of people world-wide, can be cheap — or free with a usage plan — unlike dedicated gaming consoles such as Sony’s PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s new Xbox line and Nintendo Co.’s 7974, -0.05% NTDOY, -0.47% Switch, which can run from $300 to $500 before supply-constrained markups.In addition, 5G will be a major boost for mobile gaming not just because of bandwidth (upto 1Gbps) but mainly because the latency of 5G networks is much lower (at around 25ms) which is very important for gaming. Mobile gaming's biggest market is China, Tencent and Netease hold 50% market share there. In general mobile gaming is (and will be ) more widespread in Asia (Korea, JP) which also happen to be having best 5G coverage to enable that. And of course, Google, Apple and others also have their mobile gaming service.How is Intel positioned to capture this growing market? Intel's H3C XG310 Server Graphics cards are very promising as their TCO is lower than nVIDIA's solution.From the WCCftech article:One particular use case that truly showcases the power of using multiple GPUs on a single card is cloud gaming. One Intel Server GPU (H3C XG310) can stream up to 60 resource-intensive android games (or up to 90 light-weight ones) at 720p 30 fps. Up to the theoretical limit of 4 cards, this becomes a maximum of 240 android games being streamed per configuration - which is a very impressive total and according to Intel, constitutes a lower TCO (total cost of ownership) than NVIDIA-based solutions - primarily due to the synergy between Intel Xeon and Intel Server GP.And the customer is Tencent right now, biggest player in China (same article).I will post the links in the replies.Also, Intel's monster HPC/Server GPU currently (sampled in labs right NOW!) is capable of 42TFLOPs of FP32 as opposed to nVIDIA's 21 for Ampere (their most powerful) and AMD's around 22 TFLOPs.In summary, Intel is well poised to exploit GPU market for booming mobile gaming and its higher end GPUs will leave AMD and nVIDIA behind by a wide margin once released.Wish you all a happy new year!!>> https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990?siteid=yhoof2>> https://wccftech.com/intel-server-gpu-h3c-xg310"
easy $100 stock
"INTC will crush again earnings' estimates, for most will choose INTC inside in perpetuity. They always have, they always will. Buy."
Looks like INTC is buying back more of their stock. Don’t know why anyone else who want to buy this tech dinosaur
PE is less than 10... gosh... that is cheaper than almost all SPY stocks.
I'm Expecting 3 announcements from Intel coming soon.1) $10 billion buyback was completed in 2020 so I don't think they are currently buying back shares. I expect them to announce a new buyback program pretty soon.2) Manufacturing partnership3) Update on 7 NM progress once new CEO takes over. All are near term catalyst for a stock that should be trading easily above $60.
"I own Intel, NVidia and AMD but don’t like any of these companies but I do like to make money from my investments in them."
"Meh, green by open. No real reason for it to drop tbh"
"According to a report on Tuesday from The Information, Apple is in talks with Intel to buy that company’s German modem unit, which is described as being “a key part” of Intel’s smartphone modem business."
INTC should be at $120..
"Product! Product! Product! Product!....not...Quarterly! Quarterly! Quarterly! Quarterly!My question, what took the Intel board so long? (in getting a technologist on top)Better late than never."
Intel is on 14mm technology
"irrational market or irrational investors??? INTC's balance sheet is still very strong, but it's share price got hammered."
nice run today
I doubt $TSMC would throw AMD under the bus by reducing their production and growth requirements in favor of $INTC
"bobbyJoe, Booyah John :I believe, this poor stock is a very STRONG SELL !!!!OF course, AMD is +4%,and Trading at $98.44 putting me at $900,000, what's in your wallet rider !!?? LOL￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
$INTC Consensus Price Target: $63.19 as of Today upgrade / downgrades after 9 revisions
Just installed the windows 10 fix that Microsoft release. Am not noticing any 'performance' issues. Overblown reaction in my opinion fuelled by the AMD longs. Nothing is going to change and we will be back heading towards 50 soon.
"TSMC response to Intel request, we don't have antique FABs to fabricate your antique products?"
"if you sell inteL and buy AMD you will not get two for one. good things may come to those who wait, but not to those who wait too late ..."
"Q1 forecast -12%, this pig is going to need more heavy makeup in the form of more charlatan articles?"
One large fund clearly wants to sell. Trying to bully intel into changing business model so they can do just that. Dont fall for it. At $55 they'll be out.
"AMD has stronger chips with better price. As someone who is a big pc builder and nerd, intel is strong, but AMD is just as strong and is more compatible with more things and stays cooler better etc. I think intel could make you some money but AMD is the better option for the next couple of months/years."
I brought in for Intel's earning report! Now I'm going back to AMD's earning report. Both these stocks make me happy. Green is my favorite color every earnings report!!!!
"As advised, AMD moving north at a significant rate, dragging $MU along.Prior counsel regarding $INTC solidified with new CFO. Solid. $SNAP and $TSLA my all star speculative picks. Extra ketchup today at the Costco with my little d.Ring a Ding Ding!!"
"Repostimg this from over 2 months ago:Going with ""Relatively Unpopular Large Companies"" is presented in the book Intelligent Investor.Sometimes the stockmarket undervalues big companies which seem to be it in this case.Investing in INTC right now is a conservative and promising move.The earnings are good but the speculation of the future is bringing them down.And as Benjamin Graham says those type of companies have the resources in capital and in brain power to carry them through it."
$INTC screvving up is not news... :)they have been screvving up for the last decade...there was just no AMD around as a better alternative like today...
They just announced a chipDeal between Qualcomm and Apple. RIP intels modem business they paid $10B for. All that cash and all they got was more Cap X and a little extra revenue
UBS raises Intel PT from $62 to $71.
"Anyone here with any insight to Nvidia's roadmap? Mellanox was a mistake imo. It will cost Nvidia time, money and opportunity once infiniband becomes commodity. We'll soon be seeing 400GE and even 800GE being rolled out with merchant silicon together with flexible open standards low-latency and reliability. CUDA is already a dying proprietary ecosystem, margins are shrinking, partnerships are being lost, and this one-trick pony still has no road-map to show. At least $amd and $intc have roadmaps for products and technologies. Nvidia used to always brag about the future back when they had kepler, maxwell, pascal and turing and now it's just snake-oil for the last 1.5 years"
INTC lost 20.5 today. The could have used that to buy AMD.
INTC is gaining shares and has a new CEO...Beat estimates by 40%
I've been an Intel supporter for years and I've switched to AMD. Just giving my honest opinion... where there is smoke there is fire...
This 50% sale will end soon.
"Will history view AMD's, Dr. Lisa Su, like Adolph Hitler? Picking too many fights, on too many fronts at the same time? First Intel, then Nvidia, and now FPGA's.We all know what happened to Germany."
One thing is clear. Intel is clawing back market share from AMD.
Added INTC short position today.
It is nice to FINALLY see some positive activity with INTC -- Now I wonder why? Rumors about splitting up the company perhaps?
Is time that Intel finally starts moving? Been waiting six months now...
"""Michael"" is back feeling good about his 20 shares of AMD......only $10 to breakeven. Even though he's a complete tool let's cheer him on.....""Go Mikey!"

AMAT already 120...
This will slowly drop for 1-2 years. I’m out...
Intel making a long term bottom here...this is retest of recent rally on ceo news and it’s up and to the right for INTC price from here...stock is simply way too cheap if anything gets better imho
MobileEye Spin off will get 100B easily.so INTC should be at 120 if not 150..
The short covering takes Intel past 60 this week.Get a clue Intel bashers. Intel has been able to sell every chip at a higher than normal price due to a shortage. Intel did NOT warn. It will beat the earning expectation of the analysts.Massive profits this year.
"Sold my last 2500 shares at $48.40, I am posting this because john follows my every post. Some warning signs are popping up as several companies are coming out with warnings.

Let's start a deep look at this technology - investment is for the hope of the future. Is this a significant business for launching parties and thus for AMD? Cheers !
Don't worry Intel fanboys. Intel will drop another 10% when AMD reports ER with taking market share from Intel. Moment of truth will be revealed next week
INTC sale grows 8% this qtr. It is as good as AAPL.. This truth and nothing but truth..Data center segment grows 20%...
still traded at one third of semi stock valuation.. go looking around to see if I said is true.
I want all my $3.79 back from RH today for starters before EAH
Too bad this could not hold high 50's. May take time moving forward like GM did.
"I am somewhat surprised by the tepid rise of 4% given how INTC was at a 52 week low going into earnings, all of WS believed AMD was taking their business away. INTC get, raised guidance, dispelled all the myths and more.I get the challenging environment in markets right now but I would have thought a bette short covering bounce and general buying.AMD was at an insane valuation ahead of earnings and rose 300% in a few quarters times but dropped 30% on earnings. That INTC isn't up 10% is amusing."
BPMP is green today if anyone is looking for a bomb shelter
Yahoo bringing down the positive article on Intel ?? Why do they do that ?
"If you had shorted where I recommended about 36 hours ago, you would be in the money by about $1.10 a share. Just think about it. Intel hasn't broken $60 a share in decades."
"contrary to the bears, I think Intel is going to have a good week. broke some resistance lines on Friday in the bearish channel it was in and will certainly have more levels to break, but is ready to rally here I think"
It is OK..
"We've seen Google and IBM cloud will use EPYC Rome already and others. Here's the technical reasons why.

The street duuds walk in lock step supporting inteL till a few break ranks and run. It will happen soon. They are clearing their personal portfolios now. $INTC fall will be spectacular
"BofA doesn't have a very good track record. They miss many, many stocks."

"Intel needs to restart their ""Intel foundry"" biz so other companies can produce their chips in Intel fabs. They started something like that 5 years ago, but couldn't get it done."
Everyone here should be very long TSM and UMC and short INTC or sell out of INTC. It will take 6 months for INTC to turn and the stock is at a historical peak price-wise.
Pulled a quick 400 in 5 minutes this morning...I'm happy
"Most of tech stock (Except few quality stock like $INTC, $CSCO, $IBM) trading at very high multiple and when market realize that While global economy might recover, Technology might enter recession, They can go 1/3rd on valuation alone.What that will do to Nasdaq , it go to 5000 easily.What it can do to S&P 500 , I think financial might save some but still it looking go to 2000."

Have some patience and buy Intel if it drops below 50. This just my opinion though.
INTC got Covid and is in intensive care.
Won’t even hold 3%.
does this still look like the stock to own?
If the 10nm problem is really serious; why is guidance up and price target up? Or is it a problem in 2019?

INTC will make a run soon. Major investors are just waiting to hear from the new CEO and get a feel for the level of his enthusiasm. We are starting to see the ice break.
to sell and finally break over 63 or hold and let it dip again
Intel up graded by two firms. One upgrade Intel from $55 to $60. The other from $55 to $68.
"It’s tough being Intel.Record revenue this year, 5% growth and its shareholders hate the company..."
So you think the PCs and laptops segments are bog for $intc and $nvda right? Why I focus on upcoming cloud games streaming? It makes many of those expensive PCs and laptops obsolete. It's all in the cloud which AMD is in focus for. In 10 days we'll see this transformation. Cheers
Still holding MU from $26.. Bought and sold MU many times before 26 ( first at $5)
"Beware - All the $intc next generation leaks and sky's the limit benchmarks ... they are running on fumes - more 14nm #$%$ - with each desperate tweak of an obsolete technology - a higher Clock and a higher TDP and a reliability risk/hazard. You my recall that they refused to warrantee certain high Clock parts. Those next Gen parts that were supposed to double the performance of the previous gen selling only in China - in limited quantities - well - pretty suspicious - could it have limited life due to rel issues?No need to sweat anything that comes out of $intc 's PR machine - just more thrash! No matter how good their next part really is - IT WILL BE OVERPRICED AND UNDER DELIVERED! SO IT""S IRRELEVANT!"
"I have been following INTC for a while, then Spetrino said buy under $55; I finally bought today at $46. Looking forward to the ride."

Hello IBM longs. I don't own ibm's shares but i wanted to post here about a possible big play for ibm in hybrid cloud at both enterprise and shared cloud infrastructure. Leveraging unique ibm's position in the enterprise that actually runs IT operation for big enterprises. It's nothing integrated as anyone else has with Microsoft and Amazon clouds. Ibm's $34B Redhat buy play well into this as well as AI Watson Cognitive analytics deap learning etc.This has to do with $amd GPUs and CPUs integrated in a way $nvda and $intc cannot achieve. Ibm's Power processors aren't going to make it because nvidia wasn't a good partner for ibm ripping off the price. Hence ibm has not won the supercomputer bid with Pathfinder DOE initiative. Cray has with AMD Frontier win. Intel won by default because 1. They were late in previous phase cancelling Knights GPUs and 2. DOE needs 2 wins of which ibm could make it. So I've posted a number of posts related to ibm and amd. Including ibm's general manager of cloud infrastructure saying in a video last Sep in Rome the advantages of using amd's EPYC processors including for AI and machine learning. Also recent moves of key ibm's Power processors technical and executive leadership to AMD putting in charge of amd's GPUs re to machine learning and tight CPUs and GPUs integration. Cannot happen without ibm's agreement as these people have ibm's confidential info on processors and AI related to ibm's IP. So ibm said in Sep they will reveal details of cloud computing with AMD EPYC this Q. If so i think big impact to push ibm and amd higher shares price! Please do comment if you're familiar with ibm's plans etc! Thanks.

"Happy for today's run up. But does it change anything at Intel? Will it change anything at Intel? Swan can argue that Intel is making a ton of money. Afterall, Isn't that what a company suppose to do? How can any board member be unhappy with that? Intel is a big ship. It will take a lot of push to turn her around even if that's what the board members what to do. Today's uptick was nice, but is one big investor complaining enough to make a difference.? Will be fun to watch as events unfold. Hope everyone is having a great Christmas and a happy holiday."

And could say/do what will spike share price in the near term to meet certain bonuses. I'm not saying this was intentional, but a bit curious."

"Yikes! here come the law suits. Before its done there's likely to be 3 dozen or more similar suits with contingencies for litigation in the 10s of billions. Sorry to see it, but, Brian brought this on himself and INTC. They did the same thing with the FPU bug back in 1995. Intel will eventually have to replace every chip that customers demand without the flaw. They tried to ignore the FPU issue and eventually replaced every one that customers, including me, demanded. What I couldn't understand is why they demanded my credit card and billed me $900 until I mailed them the old chip. They thought it would create a secondary market with the old FPU chips. I'm sure they're thinking the same thing; however, it will be over a year before they have a replacement chip. The cost will be enormous. This will require special charges in the billions, not counting the special charges for litigation. I suspect they'll have to eliminate the dividend for the next couple years to pay for it, otherwise, they'll drain all the cash with these charges. OMG, they can borrow, but, that will make things even worse, credit downgrades will destroy the bondholders. Da Bear Cares [CGDGE] Folks, this is not a good time to hold this stock, as long term INTC holders already know. I think this stock may settle under $20 before all these issues are resolved. I wouldn't suggest running to AMD either, as the entire chip sector will take a hit, not just INTC. One thing is clear, BRIAN MUST GO, IMMEDIATELY IF NOT SOONER! When Brian announces his departure expect a 5% pop in the price. That's an opportunity to get out, not get in on the cheap."
Blowout numbers.
"techpowerup has article, ""Intel Reportedly Signs Deal with TSMC To Outsource 3 nm Production"", repeating recent rumor of an already done deal with tsmc for 3nm production and 2nm development.Maybe the new ceo will tell us all about these type of plans. I don't think anyone really cares if Intel builds parts at both places, as they already do, and as the new ceo has already said will continue ... based on the progress in Intel 7nm."
"Intel is a pure value play. At this level the biggest bargain in nasdaq index. Target is 75 usd at first, later 100 usd."
It hurt my eyes to see AMD this way. Intel alwase my chip!

"AMD CPU+GPU, 7 nm node. INTC still dwell on old stuff. Disturbing"
$120? Possibly true. I would bet on $70's in the next month. INTL is and has been so undervalued for too long. Now it will be heading north of the 52 week highs.
"""Separately, at an investor conference today, Intel chief engineering officer Murthy reiterated that 5nm is well into development and on track for 2023. He also said that Intel intends to introduce a “full portfolio” of 7nm products within a year of its lead product. More closely, he stated that Tiger Lake would launch ""in the early part"" of next year.""https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-process-roadmap-shows-14nm-in-2029-two-year-cadence"
No worries folks the ones saying down want your shares. Holding strong and knowing we week end north of $60 easily. Patience and don't let your emotions decide for you to sell or the negatives with useless comments. It always has dips and some manipulation to feed your emotion. patience it is a buy.....

"Today is the last day to buy INTC to get the next dividend. But that's not the only reason to buy INTC. AMD's margins have been under pressure, and is very overvalued. I'd say AMD's best days are behind them. On the other hand, the best is yet to come for INTC, and it won't be long before INTC once again becomes the preeminent player in the space."

INTC IS A $210B DOLLAR COMPANY AND AMD IS A MEASLY $12B. INTC COULD BUY AMD 17X OVER. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT....ITS CALLED POWER.
It’s an internal issue in Intel that has made them complacent with their position in the market. They blinked and AMD simply beat them in innovation. Recovering may be a long road but AMD will continue to chip away at market share. Any huge leaps in market share for AMD will but intel on their heels if they aren’t already there.

"TSMC has to use multi-patterning to achieve 7nm feature size. It’s like using a house painter’s large paint roller, to apply nail polish to your nails. As difficult as this sounds, its child’s play, compared to doing EUV.If TSMC or Samsung want to achieve true density advantage over Intel, they must take the plunge first towards EUV. The tools for EUV and not ready yet. No fab is yet ready to do EUV economically and efficiently. Yields are going to be dismal. Production is going to be constrained.So the unfortunate reality for AMD is the fact that it will have to fight Intel with one hand, and Apple and Nvidia for the very limited supplies of EUV produced chips at TSMC with the other hand.Perhaps, you die hard AMD fans are counting on the fact that Dr. Su is also from Taiwan, and she may be able to get preferential treatment in Taiwan at TSMC!"

""TSMC to Kick off Mass Production of Intel CPUs in 2H21 as Intel Shifts its CPU Manufacturing Strategies, Says TrendForce"" article today talking about Intel using 5nm at tsm in 2H 2021 on coreI3 parts.

"Microsoft ARM Dollars and SenseGartner estimated Surface sales of about 600K per qtr - say 2.5M a year. 1. Say Surface ARM is wildly successful (NOT) and reach 1M units a year in 3 years at $500 each (Surface RT $500) ie Surface ARM revenue of $500M a year for a company doing more than $150B sales by that time! Say it's very profitable at 20% net margin ie net profits of $100M for a company that's today doing $45B of net income from operations. Does it make sense for them to embark on a MAJOR Chip R&D effort for a measly additional annual revenue of $500M and a measly 0.2% contribution to the bottom line IF IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL - which is very doubtful.2. Surface ARM will have great battery life. At the time Surface ARM RT was introduced it had about 2X the typical X86 battery life BUT IT FLOPPED .... ""Microsoft's original Surface model was a $400 ARM-based Windows RT product, flanked by a more conventional, low-voltage x86 Surface Pro model that the company compared to Apple's MacBooks. Surface RT flopped dramatically across four years of trying because it didn't do what Windows customers expected of a Windows device: run most Windows software. That left Microsoft to focus on Surface Pro as its mobile, x86 PC tablet designed to be used with a keyboard and stylus. "" Today a typical Ryzen 4000 notebook runs 8 hrs routinely if the manufacturer doesn't skim on the battery size. OK Surface ARP Pro X runs upto 15 hrs - isn't this similar scenario to RT days - at 8hrs it's less compelling to need 15hrs! for me.3. Microsoft ARM today addresses the performance and compatibility issue or at least the compatibility issues..by creating a 64Bit emulation and an ARM variant Microsoft ARM SQ1 which is ""more suited for computer based applications than CP"" - with it comes a larger power draw than CP ARM. ""THE KEY HERE IS MICROSOFT'S NEW SQ1 CHIP BASED ON THE ""ARM"" ARCHITECTURE. These chips are often made for mobile devices like smartphones, but the SQ1 chip has been engineered to provide computer-like performance rather that smartphone performance. "" - ""As a result, an ARM-based laptop designed for computer performance isn't going to get the same battery life as a smartphone.""""While the SQ1 chip in the Surface Pro X is designed for computer performance, IT WON'T BE POWERFUL ENOUGH FOR HEAVY DUTY TASKS LIKE GAMING OR VIDEO EDITING. But for everything else, like web browsers and productivity apps like Microsoft Office, it's likely all anyone would ever need.""4. Here's the TKO punch .... ""The key here is Microsoft's so-called ""SQ1"" chip, a processor made by Qualcomm that's based on the ""ARM"" architecture. "" SO MICROSOFT IS NOT GOING INTO THE CHIP BUSINESS! AMD OR ANYONE ELSE CAN LICENSE THE SQ1 MOST LIKELY FOR FREE AND DO IT!!5. NOW - GO BACK AND READ #4 - NOT FOR VIDEO GAMING OR EDITING OR ANY POWERFUL APPS! IF THERE'S ONLY ONE COMPANY IN THE WORLD THAT CAN ENABLE THIS IN ARM - IT'S AMD!!! So in time we'll see an AMD version with all its glory - BIG LOSER $INTC AGAIN!"

When it went up to 60 I had a lot of doubts... why now? lost out in manufacturing.. new ceo wont be there until 2022.. so 2021 would be a lost year?

Intel's Open-Source Embree Ray-Tracing Library Wins An Academy AwardWritten by Michael Larabel in Intel on 3 February 2021 at 12:00
"I tried to warn you guys last week SELL that Intel and buy AMD, it’s going to skyrocket literally. Remember this in four months"
MU could double again in 2018. So many will be replacing intel CPUs. They need new ram for the new computers. AMD sales will also skyrocket. MOBO makers could also see better sales. All the market cap that intc bleeds off in 2018 will just move to other companies. The market as a whole wont shrink just INTC.
"Four Intel facts that make this selloff a buying opportunity::1. INTC reported a beat & raise quarter.2. INTC trades at 11 times low end of 2018 earnings of $4.15.3. INTC data center grew 27% y/y off of a large dominant base..4. Lower gross margins going forward are the result of an expected surge in modems sold to Apple in 2H of year, and increased capex . Nothing to see here folks. However bears who have been wrong for years will cling to this."
No way to put a positive spin on an earnings miss that bad.
Guys... this class action grouping will take Intel’s Bank before it’s over.This one is real. Even Apple feels it’s been hung with the slowdown correction issues from Intel.Expect a suit from Apple when the train hits the rails.

Intel's stock is STILL ridiculously undervalued. PE of 12!
Will earnings crash everything down again?
It is extremely short-sighted in pushing INTC to outsource all chip manufacturing. It is really one of remaining three capable of advanced chip manufacturing. China would do the opposite. INTC should be able to catch up.
I predict that MSFT is going to try to buy INTC and then AAPL is going to also make a bid.
"break out already.... if you have not bought, you should put more"
The good news is that INTC still so undervalued that you can make a good profit

Intel originally predicted the chips could be ready by 2015.The compares to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (2330.TW) expecting 7nm chips to contribute more than 20 percent to its revenue next year.But costs of the 10nm chips are also expected to put pressure on margins, company executives said. Another challenge to margin growth is an expected increase in sales of Intel’s less-profitable modems that help mobile phones connect to wireless data networksSeveral analysts on Intel’s earnings call expressed concern that its gross margin growth might slow in the fourth quarter, when Apple ships most of its iPhones"

"To quote Josh Enomoto ""I’m going to arouse a lot of anger with people emotionally vested in AMD, so let me just explain: the AMD stock earnings disclosure was exactly what you needed to see, and then some. It was impressive, and nothing can take away from that.Except, perhaps, the executive sentiment itself. None of the insiders — and I do mean none — are buying into their own growth story. The last insider to purchase AMD shares was Dr. Su, and that was back in November 2012."""
my calls are up 150%
AMD is launching 7 nm in 3 months and Intel still did not even begin to build a 7 nm fab... That will take 2 years to build and equip..
"The headlines of AAPL and MSFT building their own chips and AMD and NVDA eating INTC lunch is what management needed to hear and not ignore. INTC has no choice but to speed up and capitalize on new chips and some overdue acquisitions. INTC needs to be innovative again to compete and continue its profitability and relevance in the chip market! I believe management is about to announce some good news soon. If they continue down a stale path for much longer it will be too hard to catch up to the many companies that are taking market share. Note to management ""wake up and catch up""!"
"I'm new to INTC....bought some calls (with one reason being the hope for a boost from new ceo) So just throwing this out there as a newbie.... Is it possible that intc has some value to unlock in the form of strategies more conducive to a cfo e.g. consolidation, spinoffs, other m&a, margin focus etc etc. Was any of that stuff seen as problematic for intc before? Just looking for a silver lining. Thx."

"What does this mean? - Intel Corp.

The chip maker released information on a ""high"" severity rating vulnerability called an ""L1 Terminal Fault"" where a computer's cache data may be accessed by an attacker. Intel identified three variants of the attack that could ""potentially allow unauthorized disclosure of information residing in the L1 data cache, a small pool of memory within each processor core designed to store information about what the processor core is most likely to do next."" Intel said the exploits are ""highly sophisticated"" and that it is not aware of any real-world attacks."

Intel spent $Billions to create chips for the mobile phone market. We can agree that Intel's revenue will be $0 in this market.AMD spent $0 to create chips for the mobile phone market. We can agree that AMD's revenue will be $Billions in this market.Funny yes.
"Imagine selling/shorting a stock like INTC that just blew away estimates and raises its dividend 5%. What has investing become, trading baseball cards lol? Its decision to double down on its manufacturing prowess adds to our future success. Shipping it to Taiwan would be a colossal mistake. Buy."
Hands up. If you compare AMD's Q3 vs Q4 results>Q3 CG revenue 22% Q/QQ4 CG revenue 18% Q/QQ3 EESC rev. 101% Q/QQ4 EESC rev. 13% Q/QI do not know how they can even more grow if they are short of chips from TSMC.
$INTC is the clear winner in sheer number of different processors made in a single node @ 14++++++++++. There's hundreds and hundreds of different models at the same 14nm. Quite an accomplishment
"Google Cloud Helps Bring Optane, Cascade Lake to MarketNavin Shenoy, general manager of Intel’s Data Center Group, touted the growing ecosystem emerging around Optane, including more than 50 OEMs, ISVs and cloud service providers. Among them is Google, the recipient of the first production Optane persistent memory modules last year. Since then, Google Cloud has been beta testing the technology.https://www.hpcwire.com/2019/04/03/google-cloud-unveils-roadmap-for-intel-optane/"
here we go... based on all the SPY's average PE.INTC upside still 120%
Intel is not bad just AMD is better
"$46.00-$47.00 would be a nice entryMy expectation for 2021: Intel will cooperate more with TSMC, Intel is going to get some market share on the GPU front, new product lines and new image is going to help boost B2C sales, network might be down compared to last year, if Intel gets more exclusive rights, Intel will be better positioned. Intel is the main provider for server for Alibaba currently; and also provides notebooks to a lot of Chinese businesses."
Ouch...just look at the 6 month chart.....the decline is clearly not over.
"Just 29 people viewing on this board . It means that we arrived ahead of many institutions + retail investors. My friends, enjoy the safe ride to $60"

This will be a huge turning point for Intel and it’s stock price. Let’s go 100!
huge short squeeze happening
"uhhhoooo .... $43 was temporally BREACHED ... Can anyone think of ANY positive news that will OUTWEIGH the swamp of news about meltdown & the performance issues for the NEXT FEW WEEKS? If so, lets hear them ...

Solid inexpensive growth stocks.. INTC is definitely one..
"Facts: AMD ships 7 nm when intel ships 10 nm. Nvidia’s GPU’s and Xilinx’s FPGA’ beats Intel’s GPU’s in many many tasks like machine learning and AI. Intel is a big supplier to Apple and Apple is in a world of hurt right now. Then there is Intel’s wierd NAND-push. Not to mention there is no CEO and flat guidance for 2019. Sell Intel. Buy AMD, Nvidia, Xilinx."
"The most important take away from the ROME presentation is that 3rd GEN EPYC design is complete!!!! They are going to test and manufacture soon for sampling early next year and launch 2nd half of 2020. Right around when $INTC will be releasing their 10nm server chips. They better hope that their 10nm is better than our 7nm server chips. But looking at the performance gain they are projecting, highly unlikely. we went from 14nm to 7nm so double the performance. they are going from 14nm to 10nm so they are reported as saying 40-50% gain. which still is 40-50% slower than ROME. MILAN is going to squash the 10nm by a long shot and hopefully keep the 100% performance edge that we are enjoying right now."
BK former Intel CEO dumped it shares because he knew 10nm was broken needed to be discarded and antique 14nm belongs in the 20 century.........BK loaded undervalued AMD? you know he did very well with undervalued AMD........
"I have just completed accumulating INTC. Those last few shares were difficult to buy as the stock has been making higher lows this past week. I expect INTC to be $200 within 4 years for 3 reasons.1. It is grossly undervalued. A company growing at 20% a year should have a PE of 20, not 10.2. CV19 has accelerated the internet economy. More people will be working, shopping and getting educated from home than ever before. This means more servers, which INTC has a near monopoly. 3. Self driving cars, trucks and delivery vehicles (AMZN) are a huge growth market and Intel owns MobileEye. Not only will MobileEye increase INTC’s earnings 30% in 4 years, but The PE should expand to 30."

"I'm a retired IT guy and have owned INTC,MSFT,AAPL, and other IT stock since the nineties. I'm thrilled w/ INTC quarterly results. I did not listen to the latest conference call. However, INTC has had a string of missteps and outright blunders. They're still struggling w/ the transition to 10nm meanwhile AMD has been shipping 7nm CPUs for almost 2years. 7nmCPUs run cooler and deliver more power. I believe Apple and Samsung are using 7nmCPUs. INTC dropped the ball w/ other technologies as well. Also, they have lost some key staff to competitors. Comments?"

I don't think Third Point will be able to have any influence in nudging INTC to look at strategic alternatives?? - what alternatives? - sell assets?? Either INTC gets innovative and creates better and products than its competition or they become like CSCO - very mature, sleepy."

Take your profit and run.
Intc is a big bubble now
"If AMD beats, they are clearly taking market share and Intel falls. If AMD misses, chip sector decline reaffirmed and Intel falls. Gonna sell and look at Intel again later in the week."
Charts say that $INTC will head towards mid fifties and that $NVDA will bounce back to 200s. They can't be more wrong about it. The only growth story for 2019 is AMD and that's because of marketshare and 100% portfolio update to 7nm withing 6-7 months.
Next stop49.00
Stable in turbulent times!
I cashed out of AMD. I'm seriously considering putting that cash here. Earnings look good and the stock is ridiculously undervalued.
Is John still saying this will be $46 this week??
"I don't know how anyone can feel safe in this inflated market. companies that make little to no profit grow with insane valuations while solid profit making institutions lag behind. When reality kicks back into gear, alot of speculators will suffer while fundamental investors who hold stocks like Intel will look back at this bull market era and laugh to themselves."
Strong finish.

here we go....
"Heres the options I see for Intel.1. Raise prices 20% on all chips,2. Take the company private.3. Break up the company.4. Kiss Wall St RING nice and smooth.I am sure Intel will do none of the above, instead they'll just rot at $50."
Everything in this thread is talking about Intel's past. The current and future of Intel is in decline. They're not breaking new ground and other companies are figuring out how to design their own chips and let TSMC fab it for them. Intel's business model is stagnant and eventually there will be some major moves like Apple leaving X86 or even Microsoft leaving Intel that will cause a major exit away from Intel. Game consoles will be next. When AMD reveal their future ARM based processors they will be next in line to be beneficiary of their advances.
"Next generation Rocket Lake CPUs are coming to town. Boom, the rocket of Intel will fire."
"I've seen rumors about Alder Lake Gracemont cores being a different process, which would imply some sort of multi-chiplet design. A youtube video ""Intel's Alder Lake Processors Could use Foveros 3D Stacking and Feature 16 Cores"" reports a rumor that it is a 3D chiplet design. I haven't heard this from Intel presentations, but not too surprising since it is presented as a high performance hybrid successor to the 3D Lakefield chip in some roadmaps. Also, Xe-HPC having 41 chiplets indicates Intel has advanced greatly in their 3D manufacturing since Lakefield."
"A tomshardware article, Dec 3,2020, mentioned Intel already having built Atom chips at TSMC. Why should we be surprised if Intel builds some low end corei3 chips there on 5nm? Seems like the Gracemont cores would be a good candidate for a low cost laptop.see tomshardware, ""Intel to Outsource 'Atom & Xeon Based SoCs' to TSMC"""

"I'm with everyone here. The management change was a changing of the guard and you are going to have a lot of institutional traders close our their long amd/nvda/tsmc short intc trade. That is a catalyst for buying. Then you have the share buybacks continuing. They got another 9 billion coming down the hopper. Then you have some traders who might pounce on this and flip that same tute trade of long amd short intc, and short amd and going long intc or just go long intc. These sort of structural pair trades are interesting because the firms don't make bets that AMD is going to rise and INTC is going to fall. What they are outperformance trades.From August to beginning of January you made one of the most perfect and symmetrical diamond-bottom patterns I have ever seen. We can very easily close the gap back to 54 (it would be healthy) and we could even touch the edge of the diamond but there is where you are going to see a lot of people getting structurally long the stock and we aren't talking about for a couple of weeks, we are talking years.Days like today are trader days, short pounces. These sell-offs follow the basic 3-day principle. You wait 3 days before buying."

Short INTC and Buy AMD
Intel is way undervalued. Buy and hold!
"INTC on its path for 10nm++, 7nm, 5,... 1.4nm in 2029 . In the mean time, use of laptops and desktops are entrenched in Intel devices."
"wccftech has article ""Exclusive: Here Is Intel’s First 7nm GPU Xe HPC Diagram With Correct Annotations""that labels the tiles on the Ponte Vecchio chip. It also labels where they were built. The compute tiles are labeled as being built on Intel 7nm, while the Xe-Link IO tiles say TSMC 7nm."
I've lost 20K on Intel the past 2 days but I'm not worried. Number of shares and dividend is the only thing I care about for now. Holding atleast 3 years.
Just WOW!!
INTC going much higher folks Imo Very Strong Buy
Remember a few weeks ago BOBBYJOE I told you to “C’mon take the money  and run “ m and giga also you are learning something I think..I suggested to everyone on the intel board to buy AMD to reduce your risk and own the entire x86 cpu market because AMD 7nm was coming remember Graham ?$AMD
Just bought 40k more. It's breakout time once the tech space has another up day which I suspect is tomorrow.
"Third Point also discussed Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) new CEO after the activist pushed for changes at the company and said CEO Pat Gelsinger has the opportunity to add ""enormous"" shareholder value for the chipmaker."
Hare's a proof that wall street doesn't like Intel as much of other tech stocks. The stock is up +$3.5 but articles are out that stock is falling.
"Well, well, well. Secret Stock VII is up 17% today. No matter. As a former grade 10 engineer who was smart enough to leave InDell, I have been harassed, called a liar, a disgruntled employee, a quitter, etc.Now, I am sitting on a 400% gain with Secret Stock VII. What to do? I'm going for 800%. This company is going places and helps people. No, not InDell."
"I will wait until 2022 when the company release chip 7mm, even 5mm. Then stock price surely will be hundreds. Easy and stable"
"This is what happens when the CEO is being paid to BOP the hired help versus taking care of business ""Company"" While the other CEO is a workaholic and saw an opening and exploited it. There is no one to blame but intel management. They dropped the ball and now the shareholders are paying for it."
that a new CEO comes in and destroys the stock with his comments and then is no where to be found is amazing....I hope someone is putting gum on his chair at least....
How is that 46 price target working Stacey?Ouch
Buying a long term large solid company in a growing industry with this low of PE is an opportunity that cannot be past up. Period!
AMD eating up INTC
So quiet here... No fun at all... Let's go to AMD board to socialize.
Intel Consumer 2 chip solution coming in mid 2019 code name Comet Lake Intel have a better version of what AMD call infinity fabric Big thank you to AMD for awakening the sleeping giant
So ceo comments on domestic production plan disappointed investors since it adds more uncertainty of making money. Don't confuse a patriot with an investor. A capitalist investor only cares about the final outcome of how much more to gain. Don't care where and how.

Argus Intel undervalued target $62
Gelsinger said he didn't want the job 3 years ago when Krazachic was fired. Now he wants it after Bob Swan has fixed the company.
In the event that undervalued AMD quintuple production of new chip still will sold out.
New CEO .. everything but the Kitchen sink will be charged off this Quarter ...
There is one thing... AMD hit the roof with supply capacity = not much space to grow and lowee margins. Intc has higher cap. and exclusive fabs.
"""Tiger Lake is just a taste of what Intel can do with its 10nm SuperFin process node. There is no doubt that the new 10nm chips represent a tremendous uplift in both processing and graphical performance over Ice Lake. It's not like Intel ever lost the mobile device market, but with Tiger Lake, the chipmaker could take back some of AMD's gains that the Red Team made with its Ryzen 4000-series (codename Renoir) processors. More importantly, the powerful mixture of Willow Cove cores and Xe LP graphics has the potential to make iGPU gaming on an Intel processor a reality."""

Pure manipulation.
Intel share holders retail and institutional have missed out on 100% gains year after year. Nvidia and AMD up 700% past few years. This is sad
See you at 60
So Intel got VMWare CEO and now VMWare appoint the Financial guy to run as CEO. That sound familiar :)
itnel had only one single thread performance leg to stand on. AMD cut that leg off.
"Delusionary. Games up for INTC. Market know sees the beginning of the reversal to come. Question now is when will share price intersect with AMD as it goes up and INTC goes down. Very happy to see arrogant INTC pumpers who treated AMD as some annoying gnat, take on the chin. Dont believe?....just wait."
"Pat Gelsinger sounds like the perfect choice for Intel. With his experience with Intel he should be able to bring manufacturing on track, with this success in VMWare he should execute well into platform centric transformation. Long Intel."

They have no chip to replace the meltdown issues chips which are all Intel Chips !So if you agree that upside of 8 is not going to occur why would you hold this stock when it has the potential for HUGE downside over the next several weeks ?

-7%?? Nonsense
"after 72 taken out, 120 coming year end."
Intel making new lows and ignoring every move in the Nasdaq100 and Dow. It only goes down.
"This drop presents a unexpected opportunity for people to load up. It will take time for Intel to catch up with TMSC in process technology. As such, there is no doubt that Intel will be using TMSC to manufacture its latest chips while re-vamping its own process technology. The launch of new products in discrete GPU and server chips with neural engines will pose a huge competition in relevant markets. NVDA and AMD should be very concerned!"
INTC could be on reddit list. Shorters beware.
"Market red, INTC greeeeen."
How do you know this CEO won't be worse? The CNBC TV analysts said Intel's problems are deep and much more than the CEO. I think you are all setting yourselves up for big losses again. Expectations are high after running up prior to earnings and those expectations always come up short.

So this is a so so story. Gently on positive side, but I just do not see much PPS growth."
I know if you look their PE compare to industry seems cheap. But the real thing to look at is how poorly data group/cloud and margin are doing. And their is a chips shortage (you expect big margin and sales going up in that scenario).
here we goo!
Intc will start flying once the New CEO arrives next week. Price target 62 and beyond.
Hey look Amd didn’t leak
"For gods sake, PE of 9, stock buyback, traded at 40% of peer stock valuation..buy it anyway."
Beat estimates by wopping 40%..stock goes up 80% from now.
Going in strong into earnings.. let’s goo!
They want get a dine. INTC will tie this up for years.
"Tiger Lake-H comparison shows up in wccftech article, ""$AMD Ryzen 5 5600H ‘Cezanne-H Zen 3’ & Intel Core i5-11300H ‘Tiger Lake-H’ CPU Benchmarks Leak Out, Intel Leads In Single-Core & AMD Leads In Multi-Core Tests"". Looks like TGL-H wins single core. They compare 4 core TGL-H with 6 core zen3 chip, so not a really interesting multi-core result. Perhaps Intel will roll out the avx512 benchmark suite again for the TGL-H launch."
"AMD has to depend on TSMC for their chips. If TSMC tells AMD ""no chips"", AMD is EFFED."
"Similarities of Intel with GE, Sears, Kodak consumers moving away from antique products with patches, investors moving away from Intel equity ?"
"Wow, you can still get over $40 a share for Intel. What an opportunity!How long will it last? How long before everyone figures out that Intel is over."
"Just wait until AMD releases earning. Intel's excuse will be revealed to be a lie. Intel claims their data center business is shrinking while big cloud businesses like Amzn, facebook, Microsoft, Cisco, and IBM all say their cloud business is growing rapidly. This is very obvious that Intel is losing huge market shares to AMD."
oh wow they decided to stay committed to manufacturing !! They need to convert like TSMC !! Custom make for customers !! do what customer wants !
AMD and nVDA investors should take money and put into INTC..
$40 closing..
And to think some people sold yesterday cause they thought it would tank 
"The way some people on this board are bashing this great American company that provides thousands of jobs when unemployment is at historic highs, really makes me wonder..."
Good going INTC. few days ago 3 analysts downgraded the stock to SELL...and that's when I bought it. LOL! I like to be a contrarian !
Did Swan/Intel IR ever come in last 48 hours and commented on all these rumors? Cannot find anything down those lines....
Im speculating that Intel will spin Mobileye off soon.
INTEL is a $54 stock. Currently Undervalued. Only Chip sector stock to beat on top and bottom line and raise guidance. Buy the winners.
Intel may revise down its 2019 revenue projections due to the cancellation of 5G contract with Apple.

"look at the chart, it is falling again! sell before it goes under $45.Pps can not go up as intel is losing market shares. Everyody know $AMD has now the best CPUs for data centers and computers"
Stacy has been losing big on Intel short play.Not too bright.I thought people paid you to be ahead of the game?
"AMD has done a wonderful job turning around their business, but they must realize that they work for TSMC. TSMC calls the shots, it tells AMD what node will be used, how much product will be produced, and what capacity expansion can be expected in the future. Regardless of what AMD can design, TSMC calls the shots on everything else. In fact, the better AMD is at design, the higher the market price of the finished product, so the more money TSMC can charge for fab services. That's why I say that AMD is working for TSMC.Matters would be different if industry capacity was not fab limited. Integrated circuits are present in just about everything, and demand is increasing. I saw a report that VW produced 100,000 fewer vehicles than were planned because of a chip shortage. This is not soon to change, and it gives Intel an advantage."
"The market has been very happy with the announcement of the new CEO. Investor reactions to the news was swift and decisive with a huge jump in price. Since then, other analysts have come out with their, Yeah, but wait a minute… Now they are saying, hold your horses. A new CEO, they say, won’t change Intel’s many manufacturing challenges and when change does come, it will be years away. A change in CEO is exactly what the analysts wanted. Now they got it, it’s not enough. I always found it odd that so many other companies are given a free pass when it comes to proving their worth, but Intel must have all its ducks in a row before it’s given the respect it deserves. Has Tesla ever made a profit off the sale of their cars? Intel probably makes more money in a month than Tesla makes in a year yet look at their respective valuations. Talk about a rigged system. I know it is what it is, but what it is needs to be changed, because what I see is a stock market that has been change into a casino where the house wins big and the customer wins small, if at all. That’s my current view on Intel this Friday evening. S.L."
farming out TSMC so maybe will get sub 7 mm chips but margin squeeze ...
"Intel is the most reliable, production-able automotive chip manufacturer out there. If you are an automaker with production lines halted because of no chips, you are going to think long and hard before passing on Intel. In fact, it is the only automotive chip manufacturer with fabs. The lines at TSMC and Samsung Electronics are not getting any shorter."
"Chip shortage Huh?!So much fake news. There is no chip shortage at all. Plenty 14nm ""high quality"", hacker friendly chips from $intc. In fact there is a huge over supply of these chips and it's selling like buy-one-get-three-free."
Market correction is coming. I do not know how big this will be.
here we go.. second wave push to 65..
"For all the Intel stockholders who just refuse to listen to reason and got blindsided by this news, here are some more likely eventsIntel 10nm chips will be produced only in a token volume as the process node will never have acceptable yields.7nm chips will be delayed for volume production beyond 2021, maybe a limited quantity of GPU chips will be released but no CPU’s until new chiplet architecture is perfected.AMD will release 5nm CPU before Intel is on 7nm.Intel will have 3yrs to fight vastly superior AMD tech with price and dirty tricks as their only option......sales will crater as will margins and the dividend will disappear.Do you still want to hold Intel?"
Morning Mantra.. Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets.

30k In a week and I’m 15 sorry teachers
"The company INTC offers microprocessors, and system-on-chip and multi-chip packaging products.. I think their benchmarks give positive in future in multi-chip as from present chips. Its really excited for @intc. what u say about that remark @intc?"
Some dump people ask why intc go up and amd go down . Isn’t it obvious intel is undervalue and amd is over value . It’s not about their performance. Duh
Report abuse! Particularly lemon fellow.

Pete Najarian went from raging bull to bear after this small move. Now he went short he's pumping his position. What a joke. As soon as it pulls back he will buy and be a bull again. Don't be fooled by these celebrity TRADERS.
Remember ME ? I suggested you to Buy AMD to REDUCE or Balance your RISK by owning both of the 2 companies that can produce X86 CPU's because I could see AMD coming to Crush you..Did anyone listen ?Graham did you ?What do you think now ?
Not sure who is buying intel... based on low volume intel buying or pumping its own... keep doing until runout of $$$
BIDEN thinks INTC market cap should be higher than TSM.
Bought more AMD and shorted INTEL... making money..... thanks Intel...
INTEL to change its name to LACKOFINTEL.
Swan refused to go with lies and more lies?
hey everybody! who has amd CPU?
is anyone on the call? have they said anything about outsourcing yet?
Awesome report! Will go much higher tomorrow.
I’ve never seen a more unloved company generate so much cash flow. Every analyst apparently has a tech crystal ball and thinks INTC can’t pivot even with their warchests. This is just insane.
$75 tomorrow
INTC is a $37 stock trading at 62. Wow! American Greed has no end...
Retail investors will hold the Intel empty bag?
Overhyped NVDA $548.44 vs Undervalued AMD $82.37 or INTC ?
"The only good news about intel cc, was Intel still has 2.1B for buybacks for Q1........... harry sell sell sell about $40s."
Finally selling all my AMD stock to shift to INTC. This convinced me https://www.anandtech.com/show/16438/new-intel-ceo-making-waves-rehiring-retired-cpu-architectsGelsinger + Hinton = Great CPU.

"This company has seemingly limitless growth potential, despite its size, given its moat and the pace, at which the need for data centers and cloud computing grows with increased automation. There is no reason to believe that this will not be a trillion dollar company trading at a reasonable multiple, in the next 5-10 years."
Intel's foundry business will make many of the chips that Microsoft and Amazon are designing.
Intel owns “mobile eye” better technology then Tesla driverless tech.
"Intel set a trap for other foundries. TSMC and Samsung had to walk into the trap. They bought the stated Intel Tick-Tock, business plan that the way forward was a regular and predictable process shrinkage. So they adopted the plan and shelled out billions to update to the so called 7nm, and started to offer 7nm despite the high defect rates and manufacturing difficulties. Manufacturing at 7nm, is like manufacturing in a world upside down. They will pay the price in lost profitability and customer confidence."
Yes I know it's just the premarket and means little as can change during regular trading but even for premarket it's very rare to see $intc in the red while AMD green and other semis and markets green don't you think this is a sign to grow bigger after the 11AM EDT EPYC Milan launching today ?
"The street is waking up to realized Undervalued AMD is the new leader in two industries. Modern superior secure 7nm for the new future demands for datacenters, cloud, new servers etc. Undervalued AMD is the future for new digitization."

"Dell can have $INTC, AMD has HP!"
Pat gelsinger is a big deal. Highly respected engineer and CEO. Intel will get back on the right track over the competition and will take the crown back.
already hit -7.5% LOL.
$65 closing..
Will I build a desktop computer with AMD maybe yes. Will I buy a 10K-20K server with AMD ? No. Why ? Because I want proven performance and reliability.
The chances for a successful quantum chip being brought to fruition just increased tenfold with this news today. Buy.

Here we go... $65.20 closing.
Don't you get it longs. It will take at least 2 years for INTC to catch up AMD.
Dumping hard on Bearish outlook! Sell now while you can before it goes back to mid 40s!
INTC............probably the heaviest hitter in this type of market. The SP will be back in short order.
Should test $65 tomorrow. $120-$150 in 2022. Welcome back Gelsinger! The return of Intel to the days of glory begins today.
INTC breaks out..... 120 year end.
"So, amd is using 7.5T for 7nm cores, according to this ... and Intc 10nm is denser. Maybe explains why Intel and AMD are avoiding the head to head comparison on initial launch of the 7nm and 10nm cores, with intel going for laptops and amd for the desktops.""In fact, Intel’s 10nm process is actually denser than TSMC’s 7nm process – Intel's 10nm (6T) process is 100 mega-transistors per square millimeter (MTr/mm2), while TSMC's 7nm (7.5T) weighs in at 66 MTr/mm2.""https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-ryzen-3000-everything-we-know,38233.html"
"Although the brutal competition between Intel, AMD, and Nvidia may seem tiresome, it's great for the industry. These companies continue to turn out new products that increase performance per dollar. That makes them more useful for consumers, and thus increases demand and the size of the total market. One could hardly go wrong buying one of the three. Better yet, split your investment three ways."

Currently, 27 percent of enterprises use AMD, compared to 17 percent of mid-size companies and 11 percent of small businesses,"" Spiceworks says.None of this is surprising, now that we have had time to see how the market would react to Zen. Looking at AMD's full processor product stack, it has gained market share from Intel for five consecutive quarters. In addition, AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su recently said that AMD had its strongest datacenter quarter ever during the fourth quarter of last year.The trick for AMD is to both ride and build upon this momentum. Intel is not standing pat, either. It's true that Intel has stumbled a bit with getting Cannon Lake out the door, it has other 10-nanometer products in the pipeline, an interesting Sunny Cove platform, and a discrete graphics play in the works."
"intel shipping MRAMhttps://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1334066""Intel (Santa Clara, California) described the key features of spin-transfer torque (STT)-MRAM–based non-volatile memory into its 22FFL process, calling it “the first FinFET-based MRAM technology.” Describing the technology as “production-ready,” Intel did not name any foundry customers for the process, but multiple sources said that it is already being used in products now shipping."""
Intel with inferior products raised dividend to slow the stampede?
"The price of a stock is not just earnings and beating revenue, is also about how shareholders and investors percieve its environment. If intel is currently seen as an old dog in a place full of cubs with amazing potential what do you want?The fact is that intel is a great company, to invest in dividends.like cocacola. If you have to invest 1000 dolars you will put it in intel to recieve 10% ? A lot of newbies are atracted to the main companies like tesla, amd, nvidia, nio... Why you would invest in intel having such a great companies. Just if you have money for the dividend. My portfolio is less than 20k. But i started 6 months ago with 1k. That would have taken me like 10 years to do it with intel. And people have realized this. This will tank today of course maybe to 57 maybe to 55 to 50, who cares... people invested in this company are here because of the dividend."

This in response to the challenge given his Senior Fellows of Where Intel would be in ten years, during a Microcomputer Research Lab Open House Panel discussion. I was there and he made it quite clear what direction the company was headed. Pat just hired back one of those Senior Fellows.

TSM is a better buy
There will be a buying frenzy today... but .. NO SELLING given huge new price target upgrades and outlook...! Not only institutions will try add to their AMD positions but new institutions dumping $intc will try get a position too! On top the shorts will desperately try covering. ..breaking the $100 mark is devestating for them as they hopped after the ER to cover as the pps drop..asbin past ERs. .not this time! Huge action coming. ..why sell under $100? Nope.. very few will sell at $80.mmpps jumping higher.. wait for Lisa Su at 9.15AM on CNBC to fuel the frenzy further ahead of trading opening. ..WOW !
it's gonna test $56 soon.
I expect $INTC to be $65 post Q1 ER tomorrow. $AMD will be up significantly too.
So when $INTC and $NVDA say China is the reason for lagging data center revenue they actually mean $AMD.

Disabling hyperthreading in Intel processors can kill Intel. Long time into 2H 2019 before new processors without Spectre and meltdown exploits. No one would buy Intel where AMD offers better products. Impact single core and processor total benchmarks performance and throuput in most cases. AMD 7nm processors are clean and are out in 2H.

"I feel recent intel labs' silicon photonics achieving 1000x faster interconnect will be more impactful than process technology improvement's in future:I don't have much working experience on CPU side, but I will tell you,what i have seen on FPGA. Though on paper Xilinx has marginally higher supported clock compared to Intel FPGA, we are able achieve higher clock speed with newer altera fpgas than Xilinx. This is possible due to Intels inter connect technology, which is much superior than Xilinx. Because of those technics Intel is one generation ahead of Xilinx.In same way, as we know further reduction in transistor size might result in only marginally higher clocking, but silicon photonics will create hugh impact.do anybody have data on how much overhead interconnects create in normal client/server CPUs of today?"

Intel stated at CES in Jan that Cascade Lake started shipping late 2018. Can someone here tell me where to find the benchmarks as it is clearly out in the world according to Intel. Thankyou.
Hiring a software guy to run a hardware company means many heads will roll..

Do some people know something?
$NVDA and $INTC should be investigated by SEC for lying the past quarters about their earnings. Because of them they also drag $AMD down which gave more realistic and conservative guidance.
"Everyone says Intel is dead. Fabs increased production by 100% in last 3 years, running at full capacity and then some. $80billion in revenue! Let me spell that out:$80,000,000,000 Around $18,000,000,000 in net profit! Apple and Microsoft hurt, but total they make up about 5% of revenue. The deals that Apple and Microsoft had with Intel, based on them being Apple and Microsoft, were low profit margin areas that will quickly be replaced by higher margin customers. The demand is tremendous. Intel’s moving to AI chips, MobileEye, cloud and that will keep revenue growing. I believe this will be one of the gems that people,in 3-5 years, are going to be very happy they purchased."
$80 next week and still too cheap.
"Repeating history in July, dropping from $60 to $48 within week."
This stock is a gold mine. Just hold and + 30% in a month
"To me, the measure of Intel is how the company is quietly operationalizing its ""R&D efforts"" by having productive collaborations in the industry! In order to collaborate, you need to have a positive image in the industry! Intel does have that! So when Intel brings out a ""Glass"" with virtual reality, the chances of wide spread adoption exists! The company, I am guessing will quietly work with partners! The under appreciated value of intel is its R&D. The company is not afraid to experiment and that is a legacy of the great Andy Grove!"
I do IT for a community college District in California and we have a contract with HPE. EPYC is already replacing many of our XEON servers.
I am stuck with another terrible management team with awesome military manufacturing CPI Aerostructures/CVU...finally brought in some INTELLIGENCE and not LIGENCE so hopefully they will get it together but there is no LIGENCE her at INTEL... I took more at 56 as I figured that would bring in buyers at that price but with NO CEOP LIGENCE INTELL JUST COLLAPSES... Boolean
"Intel has closed the gap from the July sell off. I said it a million times, ""GAPS GET CLOSED"". Congrats to everyone who endured and had faith."
"The PPS of $AMD and $INTC will meet soon, that's for sure. The question is will they meet at $35, $40, or $45?"
"This is just the beginning. First of all congratulations to all the longs who held on to their positions, especially last couple of months. To be honest, I was considering closing my position, or at least a part of it.Lion's share of my holdings are in Intel!A personal thanks to JayN for keeping the morale high all along!I believe this is just the beginning, here is why:DCG: Intel still holds more than 90% share in servers and WILL continue to hold that share. Ice Lake is due shortly and competition is stuck in supply issues. Intel will make a decision on Fab one way or other and future products like sapphire rapids with pcie5 and Optane will be extremely competitive. As per EEtimes (and other reports), Cloud Capex is going to stratosphere. Intel held 98% market share in servers in Dec 2020!PC: Tiger lake is already doing very well as also evident from the fact that Intel did better than forecast last quarter. Also, with upcoming Alder lake promising massive architecture improvement (on 10nm), things will only get better. It should also be kept in mind that supply constraints of competition will not abate till 2021 and Intel will be on much stronger footing by then.Fab: There is a good reason to believe they have improved 10nm yield significantly as per latest statement and also 7nm will be as per last announced schedule. dGPUs: Intel is supposed to be using TSMC enhanced 7nm for its GPUs which is going to give a run for money to its competitors. Intel is going to expand its revenue in this area in 2021 onwards. The dGPUs are already in lab and at 42TFLOPs of FP16, most powerful as of today. Gradually, Intel will also capture market for lower end/integrated GPUs (Iris Xe Max). The GPU SoC for android gaming employed by Chinese H3C and Tencent (biggest player in android games in China) show 50% reduction in TCO (total cost of ownership) with respect to nVIDIA Ampere as per Anandtech. This will be a huge market once games move to cloud with 5G.ADAS: Mobileye, which provided technology to tesla initially, has announced plans for robotaxis in 2022 and consumer grade ADAS by 2025. That's a HUGE market and even at a model of $15 monthly charge (like NIO is offering in China), this alone could rake in tens of billions of dollars. 8 out ten cars approved by European agency for ADAS use Mobileye solution including BMW, VW, Audi, Volvo, Nissan.With the arsenal of Optane, PCIE5 first mover advantage, Photonics, FPGA solutions for 5G, Intel is very well poised to ride the wave.The new CEO, an extremely competent ex-Intel engineer will put things in order fast and help Intel maintain lead. Good luck to all!https://www.eetimes.com/cloud-capex-is-stratospheric/"

I'll bet all you AMD er's would by more AMD if the price fell below $20 So that's what's happening here with INTC So if any of you INTC er's don't look at this as a buying opp then maybe this stock isn't for you .

"Researchers from MIT have developed a new method for creating 3D holograms for VR, 3D printing, medical imaging, and more that can be run on a smartphone using deep learning.When it comes to 3D scene visualization, virtual reality (VR) is one of the most common technologies.But after years of hype, VR headsets have yet to become a must-have device for watching video on a TV or computer screen.One big reason is that VR can be uncomfortable for users.While the user is actually looking at a 2D display, VR creates the illusion of 3D viewing, which can lead to visual fatigue and nausea.A better solution to 3D visualization may lie in a technology that has been around for 60 years: holograms.Holograms do a great job of showing the world in 3D, and they do it beautifully.Holograms offer varying perspectives depending on the viewer's position and allow the eye to adjust the depth of focus to alternately focus on foreground and background. $INTC $WIMI $GOOG"

CEO out. Did they also raise previous guidance for July report?
My prediction for two imminent events at Intel as Pat Gelsinger takes office on the 15th:1. Some sort of expanded partnership with both TSMC and Samsung. Poof! There goes AMD process advantage.2. The sale of Mobileye to Apple. Selling Mobileye to Apple makes sense:1. Apple has far fewer autonomous hours logged than competitors. It also needs high-resolution maps.2. It will ease Apple back into the fold of Intel chip customers.3. Mobileye is weak in the driver and occupant monitoring. Apple's strong point is human interaction.4. Apple Car is the next big thing. Apple will want to own your time and attention in your car.5. Intel and Apple continue to have many interactions. A catalyst for a meeting of the minds at the board rooms.

"Intel is going to have to go back to the drawing board for comet lake and 10nm...“AMD addresses Spoiler vulnerability: Ryzen users are safe from this one”The researchers also tested AMD and ARM-based processors, but found that they were not susceptible in the same way Intel's processors are. This makes Spoiler a problem unique to Intel, and it's already found itself reeling after the frenzy that was Spectre and Meltdown. And just like those two flaws, there's no viable software-only mitigation; microarchitecure level changes could help, but it'd come at the cost of performance.No doubt relieved, AMD has confirmed Spoiler does not impact Ryzen processors.While AMD did have to issue some mitigations for Spectre, they seem to have dodged a bullet here. The same can't be said for Intel, unfortunately, who will have to continue to analyze their CPU design at the silicon level for improved security in the future..."

So you take 6 billion profit last quarter and average of 58 dollars a share and subract the 2.18 billion not counting royalties brings it to around 36 to 38 dollars a share. Am I correct?
AMD will NEVER hit 100.Goes close and then crashes back.Likely to see 80 soon.
Market's and Loeb's disdain for INTC's success will only invigorate management to double down on its determination to continue knocking the cover off the ball. Buy.
I like that Intel puts Arizonans to work. Go USA!

"Jerry Sanders said it and it is so true.""Real men own Fabs."""
This makes the investment in AMD even more appealing! Chips are needed no question about it and amd has value not like hype bubble $nvda and $intc not to mention $ibm and $tsla. ..
"It costs AMD ONE THIRD to fab it's datacenters EPYC Rome chips vs $intc ! S they can cut prices to HALF and still have amazing HIGHER MARGINS vs Intel! This is because the chiplets design that has high yields earlier - already 70% vs Intel's 30% for its monolithic single chip processors. But because 7nm is higher density than Intel's 14nm, in addition to gain from yields there is gain from making way MORE CHIPS PER WAFER! in other words, even if Intel's yield would have been 70% in 14nm with their single big chip, AMD's 7nm produces many more chips per wafer! If Intel could have shrunk their big chip to 7nm in addition to having 70 yield, the smaller area chips now made out of the same area wafer in 7nm double the chips numbers! So AMD's can afford cutting Intel's prices in half and still making way higher profits! Intel cannot cut prices due to big chip and yields. If they try compete with AMD on price they operate at a loss! They do this for limited number of chips in 10nm just to show off with products performance worse than 14nm chips. It's a big meds. New CEO cannot declare AMD will take 25% market share as the previous CEO has stated and was fired! But Intel has nothing for the next few years that will take to make new chiplets design and new 7nm fab as the 10nm fab cannot be fixed. The net is AMD may take way more than 25% market share within a year limited only by 7nm fab capacity ! Hence Samsung 7nm will be used next year too. Infliction point!"
non of this really matters with the chief in thief and the silence of the write. ( did you catch the play on words?) the market is in for a great time (for shorters)
Also $INTC is in bed with these Hedge Funds. They have been caught numerous times paying money to other parties to write favoring articles or buy their products.

"It was not too long ago this stock was trading below 47 dollars. Everyone said then it was going lower and they would wait to buy back when it did. Since then it has gained over 2 dollars. and the same people are saying they will wait to buy back in when it gets lower. Been there, done that, on many occasions, only to watch the stock go higher and higher. Don't know where a good buy-in price is. I picked one earlier and am now in the money. Can it go lower? Sure, it can! It can also go higher! I look at the daily chart and see the big gap down of 7/24 and I know it will get filled, as all gaps do. That is my hope, desire and motivation for buying this stock plus the company's history and huge profits. You all have your reasons for buying or not buying, and that’s fine, but those are mine. If you need any motivation for buying remember this, GAPS GET FILLED! Best to everyone"

The market does not care since no income investor would ever buy this stock. Too risky.Removing the dividend is always risky, But if they just cut the dividend to zero and used all the money and more to buy back stock immediately, the price action would be positive after the 1-2 day negative overreaction."
"Dumping just as I thought, get ready to see mid 40s again."

Hey PATTY BOY GELSINGER....any other good ideas on how to tank this some more....just wondering as your first attempt was great...dropped it real hard.
Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Usually the big tank comes after earnings report.
INTC chart is looking steady. GL to all hopefully it can break over 57 with momentum!
Our ROKU long is paying off in spades and the INTC short will too.
"I am an ex-NASA engineer who last worked on the COBE mission.If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them.

"7 straight down days smh, and with stimulus negotiations ending without a deal this weekend Monday will almost surely be a big market down day which would make 8 straight down days for Intel. I personally think a major contributing factor is that brokers now like Robinhood and Etrade sell their order book to hedge funds, institutions, whoever else will pay a nice price for them. and those order books show a huge amount of buying of Intel on the drop, those same hedge funds and institutions collude to push the stock down more and more knowing they will cause margin calls at the bottom as brokers change their margin requirements due to the continual stock drop. I think the games will end a day before the ex dividend date on 8/6."

3 Chip Stocks That Could Benefit From a Crypto Mining Boom
AMD was so OVERBOUGHT thru HYPE and AMD has been corrected and sold off ...INTC stock price should be rising from here as it is so OVERSOLD and UNDERPRICED.It is a right time to accumulate more shares.

Another big jump after the ER with amazing 2020 guidance. Writing is on the wall. Sell Intel's shares ASAP buy AMD.

"Intel have up on memory, they are not good enough. Soon they'll throw the Rowell on ICS. Intel is a second IBM in the makeing"
"Just a reminder... don't be fooled. .. ! We're waiting for upgrades from analysts especially Hans. Many such upgrades were issued ahead of ERs before. If Hans waits for AFTER the ER, I think it means he could go for $100 PT but needs as a DD to hear confirmation of outlook on 3Q and other results before being the first to break the $100. However given $intc failure to have 10nm servers and desktop chips this year as expected and pushing the 7nm to 2022 2023, he may want to wait for after the ER because it's clear cloud datacenters won't keep buying 14nm Intel's servers chips for another year. Plus Zen3 7nm+ EUV EPYC Milan coming out this year when even EPYC Rome can kill ALL market share as Intel has nothing. So from a humble 10% cloud datacenters market share to what? 80%+ is a huge jump for small AMD...with profound implications on its PT 12 months forward. The rest, including enterprises datacenters and desktop OEMs will move to AMD too. Zen3 desktop cannot be ignored and kept restrained with an Intel's 14nm++++++ chip for another year. Impossible. So I'm looking for big PT upgrades out of this."
"I was buying Intel when in was in the teens. I also loaded up in the 20's.Have held my shares up until now and was going to hold on longer, however,I thought that this PR issue about chip flow would limit any type of strong gains. Still hold some options though, leaps to be exact, just in case given their strong earnings numbers.But what I look forward to more with excitement is Micron. One of the cheapest ways to makemoney from the many new memory hungry technologies out there that have already gained strong momentum.What's nice about Micron now is that even with the strong gains which I have made and in many cases locked in such as option sales, I still see huge upside mostly because of the ridiculously low PE of around 6 and a forward PE that is in the 4's. And much much better growth numbers than most of the other major techs if not all of them. I'm still grateful though in making my huge gains from Intel, but I don't think it can be my number one holding anymore.I still believe in the companies future also in its technological advancements. Just this negative exposure is going to takea while to overcome in my opinion."

Great time to get in. Intel is saving some good news for the new CEO to announce next month. They have to give him a good start that is why they will wait for the outsource announcement.
Biggest news is yet another delay and now looking at possibly 2023. Intel said it would delay the release of its next-generation 7-nanometer chips and said the company could outsource manufacturing
The day after release of Q4 will be digital: 10 USD up or 10 USD down.
"nVDA cloud chips are mostly for companies that want shared A.I computing cloud.INTC cloud computing still used by the rest of cloud computing applications.INTC pe is about 12-13, it is way below tech stock average. I still think INTC is way way under value.I want to say this again, if the cloud growth is real. It should be good for INTC and AMD (despite that you people think that one has to go down for the other to go up...)At current price, INTC is under value."

So TSMC’s 7nm is not denser than Intel’s pending, oft-delayed, 10nm node. In fact, Intel’s 10nm process is actually denser than TSMC’s 7nm process – Intel's 10nm (6T) process is 100 mega-transistors per square millimeter (MTr/mm2), while TSMC's 7nm (7.5T) weighs in at 66 MTr/mm2."""

It looks like the new CEO is DOA. What a way to start a job. 
Many people hating on Intel... Makes you think.. Are they afraid? I'm in Long!!
"The way things are looking is Intel has another 2 quarters before the size of the disaster it is facing sinks in and revenue starts to dive. It’s best to install a new CEO after the disaster has materialized rather than before or they will get blamed for the disaster and carry that with them throughout their tenure.Ideally, you’d have a ‘fall-guy’ CEO that can be blamed and fired/retired when the disaster ER’s arrive. BK was this guy and I think BS will take the rap too."

$INTC Reiterated by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 68 » USD 70
Congratulations INTC investors. INTC gave the best earnings report compared to the past three quarters and this stock is down today. I don't own this stock but when I saw this I have to say something. INTC should have been rewarded for the report they gave yesterday after market closed instead of being hammered.
"Earnings beat expectation, but are flat from a year ago? Did I read this right? If so then Intel hasn’t grown which is what analysts feared would happen as AMD and Nvidia take a bigger piece of the pie. The numbers are good but not sure they will add fuel to the fire. Intel’s new president needs to present a solid plan to drive this further."
More Insider Selling at INTC...Bryant the EVP GM and McBride the VP of Finance and Controller. Both at $57ish. That's 15 insider sales this week. Time to lighten up as we go into the very quiet period for the market and a typical down period for the market.

why doesn't Intel just do the right thing and sell out to AMD
Customers cannot wait till $INTC is ready in 2 years with 7 nm. By then they would go on to 3nm provided by $AMD. $INTC will then always be playing catchup and $AMD will keep moving the cheese!!
INTC will be $80 before October.
Moved all my money to AMD. Gaming and server market is gone to Amd and NVDA. Pc market is slipping from Intc. With the new chips 2-3 years away! Intel is dead. Unfortunately!
Intel stops 10 NM. Lets see how the spin zone twists this!!! This company is going through a lot of changes. Keeping it fair n balanced!!
"I just went in heavy. I've been waiting for a lower price but INTC has just never pulled back enough. Added heavy here. Will buy options on any pullback to prior support.

INTC will have the mother of all rallies as soon as the hedge funds/shorts quit trying to manipulate it imo
Nice job guys! Limonta has officially got lost
Going to be at least 18 months for Intel to put out a quality product. Market share loses are going to be significant during that time.
What caused the bump all of a sudden?
Short SqueezeINTC = Very Strong Buy Imo.
"A decent 2% plus dividend, a new veteran CEO with the technical background necessary for INTC top job and the huge demand for all things chip related is the reason I have money in INTC now. I did handsomely well with NVDA, AMD and QCOM and stayed away until quite recently with INTC. Now, I see a huge opportunity for INTC to regain its leadership role in the next couple of years. IMHO. God Bless and stay well."
"Lots of 'fluff' in the stock price, Intel's products are inferior compared to AMD's and Invidia's.On the other hand manufacturing is in disarray and massive flight of engineering talent is accelerating.Next earning report is going to be dismal with tepid forecast.INTC will test the low 40's while AMD will trade above 100."
Earning report is good. But don’t know it will jump high or low . Stocks are unexpected nowadays.
Sold half my INTC. Stock has moved up because of this hedge fund knucklehead and the CEO resigning. Nothing to do with the more pressing issues affecting the company which are their major customers designing their own chips as well as TSMC and UMC possibly leapfrogging the company. I’ll take the stock pop and say thanks Sean but it’s a sell opportunity

To think of it, why would anybody with a brain buy any $intc CPU products - they are totally diseased - inflicted with waves after waves of viruses. If it were a tree, it would have been burned. If it were a mammal, it would have been incinerated. Why is anybody even considering getting close to one, let alone owning such a terminal infectious thing!"
Stimulus will boom pc and laptop sales. Buy.
Hey guys AMD is down much more than Intel. They were down over 5% at one point. I think they bit off more than they can chew buying Xilinx and it's going to hurt their business. Intel is oversold and going to spring back fast.
"#$%$, I thought that Intel should be able to hold the $49-$50 plus level. What is the reason why the stock is going the opposite of the Market today? Almost too hard to believe that a stock a company with great numbers is going in the opposite way of the market. The outlook is good, but the manipulations appears to be on."

you didn't buy at 43 but you'll buy at 61.. ok
Makes no sense why they keep buying back stock. They are doing financial engineering. The debt keeps on growing while market share and revenues keep on decreasing. This is a recipe for disaster. If this trend continues you could see market cap drop dramatically.
INTC syncing with NASDAQ is throwing investors a bone. Jump on it imo.

INTC is so undervalued that just one single news will send it sky high
INTC is a ghost. It won’t be recovering lost ground to AMD anytime soon. Get out while you can.
I like Intel. +70$ soon!
"A rule, a law or just plain observation, price always returns to its 10-day moving average. Currently Intel’s price is $57.20, while Intel’s 10 day moving average (On the daily chart) is $52.11. Either price will drop down to meet the moving average or the moving average will eventually move up to meet price, or a combination of the two. Either way, for those hoping to get in on a retracement, Intel has probably found a new low around $52.00."
"I buy companies When they are on huge discounts, As warren says you don't know what the share price will do Tomorrow or in a year or so. Their will always be problems facing the company but if a you invest in a company who can afford a few missteps over the long term they will fix the problem and you will make money, Intel is a company who can afford few missteps and for that reason the problems will be fixed in few years and then Intel will be a trillion $ company with the T. Just watch."
"Will probably buy more if we hit arround 55, let's see what happends in the next 3 days. Probably coming back to at least 60$ in 2-4 weeks"
Any stock that rockets like this might sell off just as quick. But in the long run it just doesn't matter. INTEL IS BACK!!!
we goHIGHER.................

It will be funny to see Intel gets to $100 before AMD

"AMD green now and won't look back tomorrow. To the bashes of #AMD, fk off!"
This is officially the #2 board. Pun intended.
"On Jan the 26th, what will be easy to measure is the success AMD will undoubtedly have with the chips it sold.What will be harder to measure will be the number of chips it did not sell because of capacity shortages at TSMC, and the damage it will do to AMD's credibility as a technology partner.What entities will really invest in AMD, other than a show project, that is meant increasingly unlikely, to gain leverage against Intel in price negotiations?Who will make the large investments on AMD"
This dip is no big deal. Happens and was expected after a run up.
Value stock will be up 10% this week..I believe INTC will be up 15%.. if not 20%
Intel 2019 earnings were 3x more than AMD sales! I rest my case!!!
Good session.
I can see $60 very soon. I told everyone about a month ago to keep. The faith. It’s still THE iconic name in the chip world. It will be # 1 again soon. EV car production will increase and out of supply and demand INTC will be a player
"With multiple upgrades, ETF funds start reloading INTC.."

"Once AMD releases 7nm chips, it will be like releasing an automated, full electric, hyper sports car. Once $INTC finally releases 10nm chips after over 5 years of delays, they will show up with a hybrid Prius. Too late to the party. And you brought a pencil to a gun fight."
$amd in $intc out of Microsoft’s partner list in Microsoft keynote at Computex Taipei for AIOT/edge workloads.
The proof is in the benchmarks guys. Only trust product reviews like those from Gamers Nexus and Jay. The IPC and fps is truly higher than anything on the market. AMD has done an excellent job with their Ryzen line and benchmarka like cinebwnch and multithreaded multicore performance is excellent bang for buck but Intel's 9700k and higher are being purchased by a large portion of consumers. If you livestream and play you may enjoy a 3900x or higher since it uses more resources. The other thing to keep in mind is that the IMC of the 10900k supports DDR4 ram above 4000 which means that you can open up a lot of performance with the newest line. As a consumer it's why I own both brands plus a 2080ti due to cpu bound scenarios at 1080p low settings where I need at least 240fps to even come close to winning a competition purse. From an investor's point of view we should understand this customer base that is price insensitive and needs IPC so this is one of the reasons why Intel has a strong consumer base in 2020-2022. The patents on their architecture are strong and entering the PCI GPU market which they will shortly will increase revenue and take some market share from Nvidia and AMD.
Do ya'll think INTEL will drop after the Earnings like it did the last quarter?
"Judging from recent MU earning report, the PC and data center are doing well. So expect INTC earning to beat. Will sell calls if earning beats, otherwise will sell puts to acquire more shares. So either way, I'll be ok with it. Good luck longs and shorts. I am long INTC shares, hold shares and selling puts for strike $50 and $55."
I expect the new CEO Pat announcing within a month that 7nm manufacturing is being brought forward and possibly manufacturing start in '22 rather than '23.

"AMD EPYC was already in Microsoft cloud but won Oracle cloud and AMAZON AWS Cloud and is impacting Intel Datacenter business EXACTLY as the former CEO said it would he was worried about AMD getting 20% datacenter remember ?“Intel's Data Center Group, which includes chips for cloud providers, did $6.07 billion in revenue, below the $6.35 billion FactSet analyst estimate, while Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group revenue totaled $1.11 billion, just under the $1.12 billion estimate. Within the Data Center Group, ****growth from cloud fell sequentially from 50 percent to 24 percent.”*** < this is AMD EPYC RAMP up 14 NM IMO and in 4 months they will have 7 NM upgrade with just CPU chip swap.."

"For all the doom and gloom and frightening predictions by so called semi analysts, amid the AMD euphoria, INTC seems to have put in a bottom and is rebounding nicely. A little boost from dividend re-investments will add to the upside. I wouldn't hesitate to add in the 46ish range. No predictions on future price, but at the very least its shaping up to be a good core long term holding for those wanting dividend income (and reduced tax rates on gains). I for one am surprised at the realtive strength the stock is showing based of course on fundamentals. Boy I miss the days of Wall Street Week (the original) and the sound advice of the regulars which often included a recommendation of Intel."
"Pullback to the 50.50 USD level had to happen, markets were getting a bit too hot.It could dip just below 49.44 USD, but below that there will be high demand.1 year target for this stock is around 80 USD level.There can be a broad market pullback for weeks."

"New intc CEO says 7nm problems “fixed”. This is something we all heard before when former CEO brian krzanich said the same thing about 10nm back in 2017. Yeah, keep shareholders happy with b***s*** claims again.https://www.bit-tech.net/news/tech/cpus/intel-ceo-blames-aggression-for-10nm-missteps/1/"
So much for manufacturing problems. Intel has seemed to put a kabash to that at CES today. We open at $55.
it would be nice to break 60 today
I hate 10 years treasury ...it really cut off the momentum
"Big squeeze going into the close causing shorts to cover and some longs were happy about that. I am neutral going into the weekend, sold my Intel at $48 and change, I missed some upside. I still like the story and will wait to hopefully buy back in. This weekend is big IMO, we can wake up Monday and futures could be up or down 500 points based in trade talks. that makes being long or short a gamble going into the weekend. Just my opinion folks."
.93 EPS !!!!!!!! YES!
My advice was and still is to buy Amd yo balance your risk with intel
Intel Rocket Lake CPU pre-orders could go live early to make the most of AMD Ryzen stock woes (notebook check.net)
"$INTC $NFLX $WIMI $BA most of the tech stocks sitting on strong support level and they have strong earnings coming up. Chart is also setting up very nicely, wouldn't be surprise to see strong price action upwards for the next few weeks."
I invite all intel longs once again to join us in AMD..You now know AMD is crushing intel and intel on the ropes.AMD market cap 30 BillionIntel 210 Billion you cant see AMD with 50 Billion market cap in 6 months To be 25% of inteks size ?Think and you will see I am right and know what I am talking about...
Morning Mantra... Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Say this 5 times daily and be happy.
Open $65 tomorrow.
TSMC is valued at $500B just for its Manufacturing Semiconductors. Intel's fabs should be valued the same because they superior to TSMC (Intel 14nm = TSMC 7nm).But Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets.
"If Intel hired Lisa Su , INTC stock would trade over $100/share by now. The problem is Pat Gelsinger has been out of hardware design for too longer; he's way outdated, and if you simply look at those architects he's hiring today, they're outdated, too.I'm pretty sure that Intel will seek for other CEO replacement within 5 years."
"$INTC $WIMI $CSCO this can go forever, it’ll stop at some point, but it’s taking the stock back to months and months, it will take forever to recover."
"BK former Intel CEO dumped all its Intel shares while working. He knew 10nm was broken and antique 14nm belongs to the 20 century....... time for you guys to sell intel and run for the mark hills named AMD. Do your own homework and win big in 2021. Wait five years for intc new products with no guaranties for success, Remember undervalued AMD moves are fast and lethal for competition.......... 5nm, 3nm, 2nm"
"i thought AMD's earnings report would lead to some of the AMD boosters to be a little more circumspect on the Intel thread. so much for that idea. from where they are currently bidding in the pre-market, AMD is 9% lower pps than INTC. So much for AMD passing INTC ""any second now"" as some of the AMD uber-bulls would have you believe. Perhaps next fall. Surely ""sometime this year."" Although that refrain is getting a bit old in the tooth. Bullish on both ~ but that 2-plus % Intel dividend is a nice little extra gift every quarter."
"Well once again we have a Goldman Sachs analyst (Toshiya Hari ) putting a SELL rating on a quality company like Intel, referencing AMD as potentially taking market share from Intel's server business. Yesterday it was Mark Delaney, from Goldman Sachs, putting a SELL rating on Seagate Technologies, a company that recently beat above and below the line estimates and raised guidance for the rest of the year.Now Goldman is recommending to SELL Intel and buy AMD, even though they missed recommending AMD months ago before the rapid rise in the price of AMD stock (Way to go).If one looks at the financial statistics for both companies, Intel is clearly the long-term winner based on the following: 1) A comparison of valuation metrics shows Intel's current and forward P/E ratio (which is well below market multiples) is 17.6 and 11.4, vs. AMD's P/E ratio of 66.1 and 30.3. 2) Intel's Price/Book ratio is 3.2 vs. AMD's 21.2. 3) Intel's revenue is 10 times that of AMD at $66.2B vs. $6.4B. 4) Intel's net income is 2 times AMD's total revenue!, and 5) Intel has a broader range of products (e.g., processors, memory, networking, WiFi, storage, and programmable logic (Altera's FPGA business), to name a few, vs. AMD's processor and graphics chip lines of business (which I might add AMD's graphics are a far second to Nvidia).As a reminder, Intel just took the Apple iPhone modem chip business from QualComm and is active in AI chips for deep learning as well as SSD memory modules; all lines of business AMD is not directly in.Once again it appears that Goldman Sachs may have their own agenda for putting a SELL rating on a quality company like Intel, perhaps to drive the company stock down short term to the benefit of Goldman and their clients.I find it amazing that both Mark Delaney and Toshiya Hari, Goldman analysts covering tech and semiconductors, neither have any technical nor advanced degrees, either a BA in business or a BS in economics. Perhaps Goldman ought to consider hiring analysts that have some technical background so they can more fully understand the technology and the associated companies they are assessing.At the end of the day 7nm vs. 10nm vs.14nm feature sizes on silicon are not going to be the primary drivers of success in the semiconductor world. Chip architectures and yield from the manufacturing process are what will drive future profits and success!"
"7nm amd chip was compared with 8th generation corei9 ... 6 core... in Lisa Su's presentation. funny.,. https://ark.intel.com/products/134903/Intel-Core-i9-8950HK-Processor-12M-Cache-up-to-4-80-GHz-"
"Intel's problem is they installed cheap equipment in the fabs. The solution is to hire a crane, pop the top off the fab, jack out all the equipment and start over."
"AMD is like a lion whose paws can't reach beyond the bars of a capacity shortage cage.Yes, TSMC is working hard to increase capacity. But Demand and therefore the shortage is increasing at a faster rate.The lion still looks quite intimidating to the kids visiting the circus, but it may soon have to make do with the few bits of popcorn that Intel may throw at it.Capacity. Yes, capacity is the Achilles heel to Dr. Sue's well taught out and meticulous plan. Her error could have been foreseen and the problem could have been avoided. Apple foresaw and did avoid the problem. She should have done better.Intel will be buying up any excess capacity at advanced nodes, and TSMC and Samsung will be willing sellers.Intel used to buy customers, now it will buy suppliers as well."
"Since Apple is behind on autonomous, and since it needs to catch up fast, I think it may want to buy Mobileye from Intel."
"Nvidia has ~85-90 pe ratio, amd has ~125 pe ration, intel has only 11 currently. I clearly see that it might be 5-10x time higher with the proper vision and plan executed."
Intel using buyback dollars to early to keep the stock about $50s?
Market is shaking. It will stabilize after Jay Powell speeches. Hold tight and don’t forget we are investing on one of the best company unfairly valued.
All in
"I’m impressed by their quick response. Although, it must mean that this is serious for them to have an emergency press conference the same day the stock tanks."
Would buy a lot of Intel at $35 if market keeps selling off. Would be very happy with Intel at 35 
So when Riots wrecked our cities it was freedom of speech but now it is offensive is it? Go ahead and take away the election and do a coup and what did they expect?

Looks like this is a sinking ship for years to come. AMD gobbling up market share big time.Good luck!
I assume the big boys have known about this for several weeks which explains recent action. Lawsuits will sort it out.
It's being reported that car plants are shutting down as chip supplies run short. Any idea what chips and which companies are they talking about?S.L.
Huge cup and handle forming
Intel 7nm chips delayed even further according to Apple insider
"Booooom!MediaTek and Intel Advance Partnership to Bring 5G to Next Generation of PCsMediaTek T700 modem successfully performs 5G standalone callsNEWS PROVIDED BYMediaTek Inc. Aug 06, 2020, 06:00 ETThe first laptops enabled by the MediaTek and Intel 5G modem solution are expected in early 2021."
AMD lost marketshares to Intel is graphics. Oh MY!!
"INTC reports after the bell, and they are going to get question about the massive chip flaw."
Not your daddy's INTC no more. Today's INTC dominates everything. Buy.
"INTL, what a joke"
"Looks like the stock rally continues and more specifically, Intel is going to rally.Major upside to the stock this year as Intel moves into new areas in volume. Memory chips, phone chips, chips for cars, are such areas. Needless to say all new areas will be supported by servers and cloud farms where Intel will continue to dominate. The stock of course goes over 50 before earnings and mid 50s are likely for this move. 60 before Christmas is for sure possible and if the economy stays hot even likely."
Is it a breakout or a fakeout?
"I said multiple times yesterday when stock was flat after hours. Clou/data center is supposed to provide growth for intel and they are down double digits YOY. + guidance for next quarter is down double digits yoy. When you buy a stock is for future cash flow, not past. (GE is not worth as much because cash flow is going down)"
Conference call not very encouraging.
"Intel is the best, in building chips on old, antique technology with flaws and patches????"
"Dr. Ann Kelleher, says in the Intel Newsroom video (Dec 23, 2020) that we have been running factories at full boar last year. They have been knotted at 100%-110% capacity last year. In the same video Three 10nm high volume manufacturing operations running at full steam.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMr8rqenl4oThey are converting office space, lab space, and gown room space to manufacturing space. In this video, you get a sense of urgency to produce enough. The demand is explosive. Not an environment conducive to price competition with AMD or squeezing margins.This massive step up in the demand curve could be a result of Data explosion, AI adoption, or covid.Another positive is the fact that they have managed to stay in the game as evidenced by the explosive demand, using the far less expensive to produce 14nm.14nm is a far more mature process technology and I would expect far better yields.Yes, AMD can challenge Intel using 7nm. Neck and neck, but I wonder how much more it will cost AMD to buy 7nm from TSMC vs. Intel making its own 14nm."
"We can expect bad news about earnings @ 20jan2021. Afterwards, all bad news will be priced in. The next news will be better - new, significantly improved CPUs - AMDs roadmap for 2021 is quite empty. Good graphic card and progress in 7nm fab. If 14 nm Intel SuperFin can ouperform AMD, what can happen with 7nm ? Overcrowded TSMC and attempts of China to destabilize Taiwan will be benefit for 100% Made in USA Intel. Also, support of US chipmakers by goverment will be an aid."
Sell INTC ....Buy AMD......... or MU
"Why is AMD exploding higher ?“AMD Commences 2019 With Latest Ryzen Processors and GPUs”“We believe that the emergence of high-end cloud computing, thinner laptops, and demand for fast processing is expected to bode well for the newly introduced CPUs and graphics card. This in turn will help AMD increase market share further, going forward.”"
Sold all QCOM today. added INTC again.
One of the goals of long time share holders was a SP of $60. You may not get there with us but as an x86 company AMD will get there. I have been to the mountain top and looked over to the other company (AMD) at SP = $60.
Incoming CEO basically begged for subsidization from the government.
"INTC and AMD, why not buy both? Why just buy one and think the other one is or would be inferior? Just my thought. I am going to buy some from today's dip."
"Intel was one of the first stocks I ever bought. Around 1993. They literally had a license to print money. Quarterly earnings were sometimes as much as $4.00. I can only guess that I sold it sometime in the late 90s. It did very well for me. How times have changed. I've been buying it on dips the last 3 years in my IRA & HSA. It's certainly not a sexy stock anymore, but tremendously profitable, & the perfect fit for someone like me only wanting to outdo the Fidelity cash reserve yield of 0.01% For anyone who's bad at math, that's 1/100th of 1.00%."
"On the Windows front, commercial products and cloud services saw revenue jump 18 percent Vs $INTC enterprise and government revenue saw the steepest decline for the quarter at 21%---> what is going on, WinTel is no longer talking the same language"
"The hit is way more significant than the baseband income and all the chip set around it (Qualcomm is selling a complete solution). It means intel lost prestige or “lost face” as a company “which deliver” - next time Google or Microsoft will look for custom chip, they will prefer other company."
Just above the 50 DMA. It is important that we hold at these levels going into the close. If nothing else we have to close above $45.89. Making a higher high than the most recent rather modest high on 10/18.
Almost 100 million volume by lunch. I'm feeling the love today.
INTC's shady practice at it again; paying third parties to downplay AMD. LOL.
62 come to papa today.
"Credit Swiss asked specifically about cloud GPUs NEW announcements that aren't gaming:""Is it fair to say some of the GPU data center announcements this year go beyond just the cloud gaming market?""Lisa Su answered on the ER call:""Yes. I think you should expect that we will have additional sort of customer announcements outside of cloud gaming.""This is more than just Amazon and Microsoft cloud instances offerering as such aren't NRE already offered!It must be $ibm cloud using datacenters amd's new 7nm+ GPUs for machine learning and AI analytics as ibm's general manager of cloud infrastructure has revealed last Sep in Rome using epyc for such. IBM is to announce in Q1. This is more than just instances. It's hybrid cloud with enterprises. This explains why ibm's key technical leadership on such moved to AMD and are in charge of stuff related to the GPUs! Impact to $nvda and $intc is clear. Because of the tight integration between CPUs and GPUs amd is creating, enterprise customers will move to amd for both. Just like why cray Frontier supercomputer uses both GPUs and CPUs as I've posted Lisa Su explained because of such integration. This could benefit ibm too of course as ibm runs a lot of IT at big enterprises, it's at a position to replace legacy intel and nVidia servers with new amd's design in addition to the ibm's cloud side! It's a huge play where the $34B Redhat purchase can clearly help with developing the Linux operating system for clients of ibm's hybrid cloud and smooth transition. Intel's is behind servers CPUs per their own guidance this year. Tight GPUs integration with epyc is key and ibm's will facilitate a huge play here for both companies!"
And once again Intel sells off in the afternoon while Market makes new session highs. Same story for the last 3 days. Before earnings you dont buy!! 49 is the top!

This rocket has been launched - first stop is 65 - then much higher.
Selling a division of the company for SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than they have invested into it is NOT good news!They have cut out a massive piece of TAM by stepping out of the modem business.They have removed the modem business potential and all TAM involved. They have LOST PC market share. This is NOT positive news.Don't let Intel deceive you again. We have been deceived for 10 years now...
A few days ago I offers you guys 2 amd shares in return for one Intel. Should have taken that.
"Broad well-off in the market, AMD, nVDA deep in red and Intel up by more than 1%? Almost unbelievable!On a serious note, INTC being a value stock seems to be benefitted from shifting of money from speculative stocks to ones with solid financials and cash flow. I bet big money is flowing into Intel as of now."
QCOM CEO steps down.. He may be looking for INTC job..We will see..
No more stimulus.Teach a man to catch fish and he can feed himself and his family...Give a man a fish and tomorrow he needs another one.Stimulus is slavery.
"i am still shorting the stock but to be honest as a result of the afternoon's sudden burst upward, i may have to change positions since its changed the technical info incredibly."
"Just for your information Frontier, El Capitan supercomputers will have new modern superior secure undervalued AMD CPUs & GPU at 7nm."
AMD will tank big time after its earnings.
$60 here we come
"Trying to compare INTC to amd is like trying to compare a Mercedes Benz to an Edsel,the Edsel being amd of course.IMO"
"why is it down when the reports sound so sweet, lying intel"
"This is a repeat of what happens every couple of years. AMD surpasses Intel for several months, then has some technical problems, and then Intel puts them back in their place for several years and AMD stock tanks. Over and over again."
isn't it the quiet period for $INTC ?
sell INTC buy AMD. it's not too late.
did i miss the bottom?
"While a chip shorage is a problem for manufacturers of cars and game consoles, its a boom for chip makers like Intel which are running at full capacity. Can't do better than running at full capacity. We should see record profits every quarter for the next year. But of course talking heads will find some reason to bash Intel as it continues to make billions."
Oh those shorts gotta be hurting lol
Dear intel management. I am a big share holder. May I ask you when do you plan to announce the new CEO?
If there was ever a time to own Intel this year will be it!https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/biden-rushes-address-global-computer-100258233.html
"InDell longs always talk about the, ""huge amount of insider buying."" OMG, that one again. All they are doing is purchasing repriced options so that they can pay a long term capital gain instead of a short term gain.You people fall for this every year."
Profit taking ...I like the results
"Intel marketing is so strong, the “Intel Inside” labels make buyers more comfortable. AMD does not have labels. Amd should have “AMD Inside” to be able to compete with Intel."
Why the spike now?
"INTC poised for huge gain. New AI chips, denser 10nm then so called GF/TSMC/AMD 7 mm, 3d xpoint memory, 3D NAND, IOT, auto industry, programmable array. Intel is firing on all cylinders. $65 easily by July.$90-$100 by year end."
"Intel needs to start making Mining GPUs. 1) This will allow them to profit off of the fluctuations of crypto demand 2) They can get TSMC to make it for them, bring further difficulties to AMDs ability to have their products made."
it's heading ~$50.
amd/NVDA = Extremely Strong SellINTC = Extremely Strong Buy IMO.
why sudden spike?did some big PE firm take a position?
MobileEye is worth 50B if not 100B by iteself
$1.08 nice.
"oh, I see now. $AMD thinks Intel's cc means Intel's plans are to not use tsmc volume.However, Intel also said it would be increasing use of external foundries for disaggregated designs, which will use standard industry processes, tools, flows, methods. Read between the lines ... that implies TSMC. See the motley fool q4 earnings call transcript.Intel has built Atom chips at TSM, and is already building Mobileye, Habana and eASIC 5G chips there. Those could be responsible for a big volume shift to TSM in 2021, with eyeq5 ramping, the Habana Gaudi chip going into Amazon and the eASIC chips ramping up for 5G expansion."
My stop loss is 59.50. I would hate to have it triggered but I’m not gonna ride back down to the $40’s.
$55 this week. 
Intel is getting into EV. Jk! Congrats for all the Intel holders!
"THIS, is the last thing I'll say about the stock, if people stay off the AMD board, with anything but positive.This, has nothing to do with Intel's ￼￼ Record-setting $79 billion, or whatever in terms of gross earnings.This has EVERYTHING, to do with the fact that, investors he will never be the recipient of anything, but a very tiny gain at 16% , or loss year over year, and that's the unfortunate bottom line, & and end of story￼￼."
Unbelievable for a stock that was trading pre market high and surging to over 4% from open and drop down to less than open with a huge after hours tax. Love intel one minute; hate intel another minute; funny.

"Despite the drop, INTC is holding up pretty well. Not all, apparently, view what's going on as awful. The new CEO has inherited a seriously profitable enterprise on the cusp of reasserting its leadership. One can only imagine what happens when it completes its quantum chip design."
"Intel beat on earnings and revenue, and guidance was above expectations. Undeserved punishment after hour."
This is overdone. Buy the dip because the analyst target is around 60. It will bounce back quick today
A Tech CEO like Lisa Su would propel INTC big time. The current guy was the CFO and is not equipped to head a high tech company.
"Going forward, I would not be surprised to see Intel concentrate more effort on chip production than design. There are only two other companies that have fab technology comparable to Intel; whereas, it has several competitors in cpu and related chip design. Prospects for controlling the market through design are small, but the opportunities to control the market in fab are great. So many semiconductor companies have abandoned fabrication of their own chips, and the demand for microprocessors is so large, that much greater investment in fabrication can boost Intel revenue by 30% to 50% annually."
55 tomorrow
IDM model looking pretty good right now. Can control your own supply. One of the reasons Intel had such hard comps for gross and op margin was its supply issue in 2019. They focused on producing high margin products. So 2020 came and their supply caught up to demand their margins got hit.

This isn't a stock question. Would you rather have an Intel or amd cpu running your devices? Just a general survey
Looks like there are more short sellers and AMD investors here than Intel. The other day when Intel was downgraded on none-sense analysis. I told they don't understand numbers and when the market recover it will reach 60 by Feb and I got too Many down votes now I am saying 65. You could still down vote and say 42 but who cares when I make money.
Wow intel down 1 whole dollar? any other company would be down huge especially AMD. No manipulation here. I would start selling now before the big guys start dumping. Datacenter is going to get hit hard and AMD will be picking up the market share.

Intel's former CEO predicted the future of Intel before he bolted. He is quite the prophet. Intel will lose 20% server share to AMD soon.
I think INTC will be exiting some of the high end cpu business and will focus on storage and switches. this will hand $AMD the future of cpu business.

"Yes. The shorts won this week and that is for sure against Intel.90% of the selloff was because a very poor earnings call. The net profit of 5 billion dollars was spectacular but stocks are about future and intel did not sell its future during the call.The shrink delay to 10nm is all that came out and no answers were heard. Thus, the stock is down on record profits and a great outlook. You see, the street does not believe the future.No CEONo 10nmEnd of story for now.Yet, Intel could continue to sell chips at record rates and this would devastate the shorts. The short cover panic could take Intel past 70 by Christmas. Then we have Intel benchmarks. Funny thing is the top end chips even at 14Nm outperform others bu huge amounts. Google and Amazon buy them.Then we have the possibility of a surprise appearance of Intel 10nm chips q2 2019. Rumor.Apple all in with Intel modems.Being short Intel long term is a bad play."

The competition is running circles around Intel.Will he do to Intel what Satya Nadela did to Microsoft ?You be the judge."
Intel had a whole quarter to communicate their product delay. Why last minute and wipe out all the loyal investors. The Institutional Investors should make sure this doesn’t happen again. CEO knew this beforehand and must be made accountable.

Now is not the time to antagonize your suppliers, when you can't get enough chips else where. It may try to strongarm Intel into better pricing, but I doubt it will be successful enough to justify its spending on the project.Microsoft can't simply copy Apple, because Apple has special allocation agreements at TSMC, as a result of investments it made in TSMC's fabs. No other company enjoys such special treatment at TSMC."

Mubadala warrants buy timing the new wafers agreement with Global foundaries and the 7nm products launching in June are ALL RELATED IN MY VIEW! Please allow me to explain. First consider inventory build. Please search for script of last AMD ER call talking about the additional amount for such included in the results and the analyst questions when all this inventory will go on sell making revenues. Consider TSMC has allocated a certain number of 7nm to AMD to start. Higher allocation follows later but for now AMD MUST BUILD UP INVENTORY EVEN IF NAVI AND ZEN 2 CHIPS ARE WORKING TODAY! Why? You cannot launch such an important line of products that AMD knows will get a lot of revenues as per lisa su forecast for 2019 without having enough chips to supply the demand. This takes months to accumulate the chips from TSMC 7nm wafers allocated to AMD AND TAKES MONEY TO PAY FOR MORE THAN THE NORMAL HIGH INVENTORY. Here is why mubadala bought the shares out of their warrants now as they had time to buy them in 2020. Why mubadala helps AMD? Because in every Ryzen 3000 and Rome epyc 2 they have 14nm chips acting as memory and ziO controllers pushing PCIe 4.0! 7nm is NOT GOOD at pushing high currents needed to drive memory modules and PCIe. Though 7nm library has different transistor sizes with different current pushing specs 14nm is better suited for that hence the genius of lisa su chiplet design! Now mubadala gets additional 14nm chips orders too keeping their fab at Global foundaries busy. Wafer agreement makes sense and warrant money to AMD funds inventory including additional 14nm chips connected with the 7nm chips and 12nm chipset controllers etc for motherboards! Mubadala takes profits but doesn't sell all investments in AMD as Softbank sold theirs in $nvda ! 75m shares at $100 pps is $7.5B ! A respectable investment to leave riding after making money on their initial AMD investment and using part to pay for warrants. 75m shares are free to mubadala without additional funds. AMD gets inventory funding without adding to debt or adding diluted stock as mubadala warrants are already committed. So $intc faces a concentrated tsunami in 2H from Rome in datacenters and Ryzen 3000 in desktop and laptop as $nvda will with navi and VII. I hope my views are helpful to my AMD's friends on this MB. Cheers
North Korea Peace dealMarkets of course go higher.Am I wrong?

Remember me 73 to 84 sell your Intel Buy AMD you’ll get your money back..Still time going to 93 real soon.
some were willing to forgive $INTC for missing the 10nm delivery targets so many times but none is willing to forgive $INTC for missing 7nm target. Their brand is destroyed. $AMD will benefit from this.
Just imagine what you guys will feel tomorrow night. You will be in the mid 30s easy.
"All chip manufacturers will find that going to a smaller feature size will be increasingly difficult. Moore's law, which is not actually a natural law but a trend, falls apart as we approach 1 nm. Additional gains in density and power efficiency will have to come from other sources. AMD is at a loss to compete under the new rules. It can control many features of its cpu's, but advantages that arise from 3D arrangement are under the control of TSMC. Therefor, many opportunities for innovation are simply unavailable to AMD.INTC, on the other hand, controls all features of each chip that are performance related. That's why they need to continue to build their own high-performance product. INTC now has a PE ratio of 12. On the other hand, the S&P PE is 38. This is completely ridiculous. If the market gave INTC the same valuation as the average of all S&P stocks, the price would be $183."

HP & Lenovo executives: Intel’s CPU shortage to continue for 6 more months$intc $amdhttps://www.ultragamerz.com/hp-lenovo-executives-intels-cpu-shortage-to-continue-for-6-more-months/
Net profit surprise 40%. PC sales surges 30%..Better than AAPL..
I just bought 30 calls - INTC Apr 16 2021 60 Call $3.70/contract
Chip shortages outside Intel just got way worst. TSMC needs huge amounts of water for its ASML 3400C EUV systems at 300W initial source power. Over 2000 liters per minute per machine just for cooling. Taiwan is unfortunately in a drought. They have had to truck water into the fabs. This can't be good for the smooth flow of chips.
"All the people #$%$ting negative things about the buybacks are short sellers. A real shareholders loves buy backs, especially when the underlying business has 20 billion in free cash flow. This isn't India, we are not dumb, we can tell you spamming #$%$ don't own shares and have never bothered to study the fundamentals."
Intel will gain marketshare because they handle their own production. Car companies like GM have reduced sales forecast by billions due to chip shortage. AMD is screwed alongside all the other overvalued competitors. Look for Intel P/E to climb to 20 as they claw back marketshare.
Intel will compete no doubt. They have the technology and the engineering talent. Their GPU will possibly be inline with what AMD is developing post-GCN architecture. With AMD now in their sights $intc are not lost anymore and know better how to develop a competing strategy. Dr. Su knows this and she's counting on it. It's still be a tough battle as AMD will be causing all sorts of trouble for Intel. INTC will likely drop to $30s
"$intc strategy till 2022 when their 7nm fab will run is to increase 14nm servers performance in the meantime. How? By coming with chips including hardware patches for the many security exploits which use software patches today decreasing performance by 30% or more - Intel asks NDA signature before giving the patches not to publish any degradation of performance from these! So now as Intel has a few yeas anyway they redesign chips to close the exploits in hardware. That will eliminate software solutions today and appear the new 14nm chips are faster! But they just got back t square one as by then the comparison with AMD will use new 7nm Zen 2 products not 14nm old chips! From Intel's customers they will see gains on existing chips they use but compared with AMD the gap will increase drastically leaving Intel behind. This is all Intel can do only very few cloud customers will buy this. Hence even Dell had to upgrade its AMD's products to 10 from 3 as its customers refuse to buy Intel based products and would go to Dell's competition to get AMD's! Revenues increasing this year eminent! Cisco already stated ladt year their high density new offering was AMD's EPYC only no Intel. Citing if customers ask for Intel they could make such - politely saying no customers asked for it. See this?""Leach said there’s no reason Cisco could not or would not create an Intel-based server to fit the chassis, or even an Arm-powered machine if demand emerged, but that for now AMD does the best job of meeting Cisco's aim of density with low operating costs.""Clearly AMD wins big this year! Way higher revenue growth eminent! https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/31/cisco_ucs_uses_amd_for_first_time_in_c4200_platform/"

Intel will face a poor future if it doesn't seek and secure the most able people to advance its products. Favoring people who are less able than others to achieve diversity is a path to doom."

On Thursday, Intel reported adjusted second-quarter earnings per share of $1.06, above the 89-cent Wall Street consensus. Revenue of $16.5 billion beat expectations of $15.7 billion.The chip maker's 2019 guidance was also above full-year Wall Street expectations. Intel forecast 2019 sales of $ 69.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $4.40, versus the average analyst estimates of $68.5 billion and $4.23, respectively.What's new. Raymond James analyst Chris Caso on Thursday reaffirmed his Underperform rating for Intel ( INTC Loading...

"CEO In question -- Bob Swan and I worked closely together @EDS ... as both of us were very new the Company /Industry in Plano, TX ... we were both EVPs and out-of-towners who lived in Plano during the week and commuted back to our respective homes over the weekends. I was much more knowable about EDS, the industry and I was brought in to advance EDS's growth initiatives while Bob was brought in as the CFO/cost-controller. What we determined with Bob was that he had very high credibility and was a solid cost-controller. HOWEVER, he was very week in technology and customer-facing matters. Thus, we kept him far in the background. I did take him on a couple CEO/CEO trips to give him some exposure but we mutually agreed his time was better spent back in the headquarters. My background is in high Finance (wharton MBA) but also ran numerous ""growth consulting initiatives for customers since the late '80s so I understand both the tech and Finance spaces. Bob, is just 1-2 steps below what INTC really needs to put INTC back on a growth curve. He's more of a ""shop floor controller"" (as labelled at EDS). I really wish Bob well ... but he's not what INTC needs. In the meantime I will maintain my INTC short and long AMD position. I have held this ""barbell"" since Bob was hired as CEO."

It's not important for a PC the 10, 7, 5 and 3nm at this time, it is delivering more performance, and the horizontal scalability with multiple cores is not sorting out power usage. i3 gen 11 with 2 cores used about 40% less power than Ryzen 3 with 4 cores, and of course dissipates less heat, which is very important in a laptop. Non tech people do not understand, yet, that AMD is selling trash compared to last 3 generations from Intel... And more, AMD has no equivalent of vPro for the CPU's that offer hardware protection for environments like public sector, health, goverment, and corporations that put security first. AMD has 100% nothing to offer to the BIG guys with money. Not even in the server sector... Face it, Intel is monopol today in critical computing.

"The valley of death lies between AMD new 7nm invention, innovation or Intel old antique meltdown, foreshadow, spectre with patches?"
Lots of moving parts here.AMD’s 64-core 128-thread Rome CPU in 2019 will be the downfall for Intel and they had better have cleaned things up and something in the pipeline to counter AMD’s follow-up Milan CPU in 2020 for the data center space.AMD’s TSMC 7nm manufacturing is producing chips now while Intel’s comparative 10nm manufacturing capability will not be ready until the end of 2019.Manufacturing is only half the equation. A whole new CPU architecture is required to resolve all 15-20 SPECTRE vulnerabilities that causes a 5-30% performance hit for all current and future Intel CPUs being released through 2019. It usually takes 3-5 years for a top company to throughly test and bring a new CPU architecture to the market.Note that Intel also has no CEO to drive essential programs inside Intel to become competitive again.Also note that AMD Intel’s direct competitor is not sitting still through all of this.Note that Apple plans to drop all Intel CPUs for their MACs in favor of their ARM-based A14X FUSION CPUs.Note that Apple has notified Intel they will discontinue using Intel LTE modems in 2020.Overall not a good time to invest in Intel. The writing is on the wall.

In a 2018 presentation, researchers from Wayne State University and the University of Houston showed most workloads entirely unimpacted by Secure Encryption Virtualization (a subset of AMD's SME that allows whole-VM encryption, with a separate key used for each covered virtual machine), despite significant performance impacts with Intel's SGX.""Also AMD has an automatic feature requires no planning nor awareness of the programmers unlike Intel. Big advantage for AMD! Same technology is used for the GPUs so $nvda is way behind too.Clear choice? AMD!https://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/intel-promises-full-memory-encryption-in-upcoming-cpus/%3famp=1"

How much Bullshiat can AMD pumpers last when a real tech CEO shows up...
"Intels antique FAB delayed again broken 7nm, I personally in the last four years changed the name of Intels new antique products, I called new line of Waterloo chips."
"Just want to remind people here, up coming events will let Intel drop sharply, 1. AMD will sign contract with Samsung to increase their production volume by 50%, 2. New Intel CEO will announce their out source plan, there will be no core CPU products, just because if Core CPU product passed to TSM for manufacturing, the whole CPU will need to be redesign, 3. New CEO will confirm there will be 6 more months delay on 7nm, 4. Apple M1X announce on March, 5. Microsoft's Server CPU announcement.If you could take all the risk above, you could strong hold your Intel shares."
"Consumers (corporate or personal) choose INTC products, follow the money.."
"Better hang on folks, Intel announces $475M additional Investment in Intel Products Vietnam to enhance manufacturing of 5G products, Core Processors W/hybrid Technology and 10th Gen Core Processors.Also Digitimes writes that Intel Struck Deal with TSM.Stock should continue it's run north to $60 and beyond."
Love watching greedy shorts getting hosed Very Strong Buy
amd is actually down after earnings
"Mobilye itself is earning as AMD. Intel earns more than 10x over AMD, and will keep grow when process issues get fixed and TSMC allocation will go Intel too. AMD will stay with nothing and will back to where it was 2 years ago."
"No one ever mentions how Intel made tons of money during the last quarter even though they did not have a 7nm chip and while AMD has had the 7nm chip for over a year. Seems like profitability just does not matter in today's market. Like investors in Tesla’s stock, investors just want to fantasize about their company. Profitability is something that will automatically come for them in the future if you believe hard enough. Sad. PS, Intel is making money now, all without a 7nm chip. That's a fact.Full disclosure, I have a small amount of Intel at $49 and will dump it in a second when AMD starts making more money than Intel."
"Isn't it nice to see $intc red and AMD green? Look at the leaked spec and PRICES. AMD has RAISED THE PRICE PER CORE TO ALMOST DOUBLE THEN BEFORE at over $100 vs $50s and still it's much cheaper than Intel. Provides better value while this increase goes straight to the margins while adding revenues - double - as twice $$$ per chip sold vs before! Add market share gains as we'll see with new cloud customers and partners shown today, and you get the picture!"
Intel makes more GPUs than all other GPU manufactures combined.
"hellow i am a investor in amd. I am not here to bash intel only for relevant info about intel. Did you follow the interview with T.J Rogers on cnbc an hour ago. See if you can bring it up, very interesting. T.J Rogers is the founder of Cypress semi conductor and has no axe to grind. First he said that dan loeb is and investor and should have no say in the fate of intel. He has made 50million since his letter about intel. The board should have stepped in and they didnt and so they are to blame for the what is happening at intel. He also said that bob swan is a nice guy but has to go. He is a financial guy and the techies have to have a techie as there leader or they leave. T. j. Rogers said he never worked for a pay check as he would always be paid properly for his work. He only wanted to know what exciting projects they were working on. Amd were a nothing company until they hired lisa as there new ceo. She is an computer engineer and look how that worked out. T.J said top talent will follow the latest leaders and bob is a financial guy. He said that andy grove was a no nonsense guy that would not tolerate a miss in production. There is no doubt that Bobs days are numbered or this is going to turn out very bad for intel. Listen to people that are on the inside of the thinking of the teck sector like T.J Rogers. I dont wish anybody bad wishes as it is hard to make money in the market."

"The insight missing from your post is that gamers will greatly benefit from huge performances boost once drivers are updated for windows PCs. While the article states there was no time to benchmark games and it's for $nvda 1080 TI , we know the ratio fro 2080 Ti vs 1080 Ti as nvda Turing products have been out for a while with upgraded drivers. That means similarly to linux users and listed boost in performance gamers will rush to buy the VII in addition to crypto use which is 4x more cost performance better than 2080 Ti and workstation pro use at 10x FP64 vs 2080 Ti. Then $intc to face similar amazing differences between Rome epyc and whatever intel has as 14nm+++. 10nm if it can work in 2020 for large chips won't help. Not only we know Intel has failed multiple times with 10nm and could fail again in 2020 as obviously something is very wrong there but Intel lack the chiplet design and will take a while to redesign such products not for 2020. So the old school Intel dinosaur monolith single big server chip will be useless vs AMD's 7nm+ and 5nm in 2020 chiplet based.

Give me a break, like INTEL doesnt already know its options....Intel’s upcoming Core i7 processor could deliver stunning performance according to leaked benchmarksby Marcos Thadani ● Last updated on Dec 30, 2020This shows that the upcoming i7-11700K could deliver some pretty impressive single core performance. Actually, it’s almost 25 % ahead of the Core i9-10900K, and close to 8 % ahead of AMD’s current top-flight CPU (the Ryzen 9 5950X) in single core performance. The Ryzen 9 5950X admittedly outstrips the new Core i7 when it comes to multicore performance, although this is to be expected taking into account that the Ryzen 9 5950X is a 16-core processor, while the i7-11700K “only” sports 8 cores."

"I'm not a fanboy of any Intel or Amd, so fanboys don't read, this. As tests shows Amd is better now, but Intel prized it's new rocket lake good, and that's the reason why Intel can hold it's position if we consider to that, Amd's chip shortage, that would hold at least for a few more months. In server line rumours tell, that 10nm ice lake xeons are in mass production, with max. 40 core count, which is less than Amd's 64, but much more than 28. If Intel prizes that cpu good too, than market share loss can be slowed down. All in all, I won't bury intel yet. Considering it's lower valuation, and pe, it's still a good buy. My only bad, that I waited this cpu announcement for later, and missed a good jump in. But Ice Lake can be a good moment again, but don't know when.And there is one more point for Intel. As Intel is made in the US. China-Taiwan tensions have not much effect. If China goes crazy, Intel will be going much higher with Micron."

In AMD's case it is also coming down to decisions between supplying their big OEM partners and their end users... similar to Intel's capacity issues in 2019 and 2020 ... and having to cede consumer desktop segment and low end and educational pcs during that time. It is ironic that AMD seems to be faced with the same choices now and it is Intel's capacity expansion over the last three years, rather than the dimensions of its transistors, that enables Intel to respond to the increased demand."

(btw, eyeq5 is the 7nm chip built at tsmc, although I did not hear him make that statement today in the short piece I listened to.2.

"former Intel engineer complains about avx512 on laptop chips ... but:1. Intel did this as they moved to 10nm, with 2.7x improved density and greatly reduced power.2. Intel's Ice Lake chips with avx512 showed no problems with power efficiency, and in fact outperformed AMD chips for the comparable laptop designs in Surface last year.3. Intel has demonstrated scalable gains in AI processing with the avx512 designs, especially with the dlboost 8 bit inference processing and the bfloat16 training processing. You can't deny these have been a factor in sales, especially in the case of FB requirements for bfloat16 in their Zion platform, for example.4. Intel already developed small Tremont core solutions without AVX and with its 6 wide out of order decode, so if no avx is the answer, Intel has a chip.5. Intel is extending Tremont with AVX2 simd in next year's Gracemont cores. These appear to present Intel's answer to the more-small-hammers processing of AMD chips. 6. Tremont cores were a fourth the size of Sunny Cove. You already see up to 24 Tremont cores in the P5900 5G base station products. It isn't hard to imagine a 128 Gracemont processor, if that is a required solution.7. We already see Alder Lake desktop chips on the roadmap that will offer varying numbers of Gracemont cores. These will be an interesting competitor for AMD's many small core avx2 limited chips. 8. Usual hyper-thread performance adds about 30% to the performance of a core, while a Tremont small core added about 50%.9. Gracemont addition of performance while doing AVX2 operations should be close to 100%, which is an interesting thought for the benchmarks. Use of AVX with hyper-threading sometimes actually decreases performance.https://www.pcworld.com/article/3569182/whats-wrong-with-intel-and-how-to-fix-it-former-principal-engineer-unloads.html"

You are going to learn the lessons of your lives as AMD launches 7 NM EPYC - RYZEN - and NAVI ""AMD Rome Epyc 2 processor 64-Core (128 threads) spotted and benched in Sandra (2.2 GHz) ""by Hilbert Hagedoorn on: 04/01/2019 09:18 AM | source: | 22 comment(s)AMD Rome Epyc 2 processor 64-Core (128 threads) spotted and benched in Sandra (2.2 GHz)AMD is paving the 7nm road and the ZEN2 architecture hard and fast. In SiSoft Sandra now an entry can be spotted, this is an early engineering sample AMD Rome Epyc 2 processor running 64 cores and 128-threads (single CPU) at 2.2 GHz.The chip tested is the AMD ZS1406E2VJUG5_22 / 14_N which was planed into a Dell PowerEdge R7515 server. The proc is a qualification sample and perform close to the final performance aside from maybe the Turbo frequencies. Right now it is setup as 1.4 GHz Base with a boost to 2.2 GHz on all 64 cores. You can spot 64 x 512 KB L2 cache and 256 MB L3 cache. The second generation of Epyc chips is codenamed Rome and has a maximum of 64 cores and 128 threads by combining eight 8-core 7nm chips . ZEN2 will bring a higher ipc, smaller fabrication process and lower consumption.These processors are of course data-center products, but you know it, this architecture will end up in desktop processors. So far all it pretty interesting. AMD expects a 25% generational performance increase for the CPU cores. While that's not IPC, the theory is that one die package would be 25% faster. ZEN2 is not just a die-shink, it's a new architecture and based on chipsets. 7nm dies surrounding one 14nm IO chip in the center connected through AMD's Infinity fabric. The ""Zen 2"" high-performance x86 CPU processor core thus has a modular design methodology. An improved AMD Infinity Fabric interconnect links the separated pieces of silicon (""chiplets"") within a single processor package. This should solve some latency issues. The new processor also will support 8-channel DDR4 memory. Also, PCI-Express will be supported. Rome looks amazing, the dies are just so small.$INTC Https://www.guru3d.com/news-story/amd-rome-epyc-2-processor-64-core-(128-threads)-spotted-and-benched-in-sandra-(2-2-ghz).html"

"It is no brainier, $INTC should outsourcing $TSM. This has nothing to do with made in USA/patriotic/politics etc. It is about making more money. First $TSM business is to fabricate chips, Intel business is designing and fabricating its own chips. TSM is not interested in Intel design business and Intel can keep that to themselves to keep their business secrets but why Intel adding more cost to their chips by fabricating their own chips instead of outsourcing to TSM which can fabricate better and cost effectively. Intel should look at $AAPL and see why $AAPL outsourced their 5G chips to $TSM"
Lucky me pre-ordered to sell 1k shrs at 60. Filled. Ave price 45.34. Will buyback at 45.
Cowen rates AMD NVDA outperform. Intel not so much! Might be time to sell!
As expected early benchmarks of $intc look bad vs mobile Ryzen 7nm APUs. It's actually much worse because Intel's 45Watt spec is at min clock speed. At all cores turbo it's 150Watt !

Cramer absolutely trashed INTC this morning. I'm very worried. The man is rarely wrong.
I think the market has forgotten that INTC will have to yield to the activists. This stock will go up probably 25% - 35% by year end of Summer.
My invitation for donkey burgers got accepted by many.
"There are rumors I’m hearing AMD Advanced Micro Devices is a buyout target for $35 to $40 a share from Microsoft, and Intel. Apple is also interested. $40 billion deal would be 100% premium."
"Intel's big-money investors are frustrated by the management's inability to excite the retail investor.Intel's varied businesses are so complicated. No analyst, scientist, engineer, or economist can claim to understand them all.Hense we get under-reporting by management and oversimplification by analysts. I think since Intel has reported its initial delays in node transition, we have heard nothing but Nanometers. This is a massive and misguided simplification.As a whole, Intel is doing great. An excellent place to park your money for the long term. It will have explosive growth soon. It will share in Data Growth, AI growth, Autonomous growth, and Capacity shrinkage."

Intel has a better P/E ratio by a mile than any of these other Tech stocks The market has no rules right now. Be patient and be careful
"The amd fanboys come and they go.Always it is the same thing though. AMD is gonna this and is gonna that.Then Intel cuts price to hold on to market share and the AMD fanboys are shocked when AMD begins to post net losses again. Soon after, they start crying that the governments need to help AMD. Funny that when just a little earlier they were saying that AMD was going to crush Intel.Net loss after net loss will come to AMD again. Short AMD and ride it back to 2.00 dollars a share."
Money managers playing hot potato with INTC stock.
"So, intel is up 13% in the past 15 months and you guys think your stock is the best. AMD is up over 120% in that same time frame and doesn't produce preinstalled spyware."
"Intc makes 20 times more money than Amd. Releases a more stellar earnings report, and yet its stock is plummeting on a very good market day. Amd, however, with a PE of 185, is up nearly 3 percent after a fabulous previous day. Is there ever a logic to this market?"
INTC is going much higher folks.
a very inexpensive stock at these levels. my largest holding.
"Chip shortage for modern superior secure 7nm will continue until second haft of 2021, undervalued AMD in spite of doubling production for new products sold out in Q4......... helping Intel to sell its out date products for a big discount. If AMD quintuple production of new products for second 1/2 of 2021 I bet will be sold out too. Do your own DD and win at the end of 2021, it will take 3-5 years for Intel to have a new product to compete with fast moving target."
AMD has a forward PE of 62. Intel forward PE is 14. There is a reason for Intc to be at 54 and AMD at 10+ and change.
INTC has been beat down for a while. Think it’s ready to make a run..
Do any of you recall what P/E Mr Market had awarded INTC during 2015/16 when AMD was nearly went out of business? And therefore the future was just INTC at that time. Trying to make sense of the way the market is valuing INTC. Thank you.

Wasn't most of the earnings pre released when they announced new CEO.
"Special Alert Intel in Crisis***As I read this I see the end of an empire ! fear in the air !I see a company that is resigned  to lose major maket share to AMDthey say it right in this article in this statement...He’s got paranoia alright !

"Did anyone see the CNBC clip where one analyst said that intel is done, toast? My response is, really? How does a company the makes billion and often beats expectation, toast? Maybe he meant to say that Intel is French toast because that stuff is good eating, want more. When Intel’s quarterly profits start to decline quarter after quarter, then it’s time to worry. But so far, the opposite is happening. All I can say is, when in doubt, follow the money."
Good Morning. Intel is better than AMD.
"Intel is much more worth, everybody knows that.New CEO will push intel into new dimensions. It is one of the best companies worldwide."
"Funny thing about 14, 7, 5, 3nm is that the mass media and armchair experts are chiming in on this and I guarantee 95% of people HAVE NO IDEA how these things are built and the complexities involved. A convenient scalar like 14 vs 5 is easy and comfortable to form an opinion on. But I’ve heard nothing about ASML and TSMC’s adoption of extreme UV lithography (EUV), keeping in mind that intel was an early investor in ASML.As far as I can tell intel bet on multiple masks to squeeze spaces between logic gates/leads and got scr3wed by the nanometer shifts that happen between lithographic runs whereas TSMC/Samsung just decided to print the layer in one go with EUV. I’m speculating, but at least I know a bit about how these things are built. In this bubble market people have gone nuts speculating about stuff they don’t have a clue about."
"looks like just about everybody giving up on INTC...perhaps, light may be in the end of the tunnel.."
"What we can expect? 1-3 years reorganization, funding cut on certain departments, loss of talents. If you are a young talent, why intel if you can go to NV, AMD and TSM? CEO is not the root cause of the current situation, loss of ingenuity and politics is."
"AMD outperforming today! Up 31 cents! Reading hanging upside down, like an AMD batboy."

"Intel Ramps Up 14nm Production To Meet High Demand For Its Processors￼By Usman Pirzada12 hours agoIntel’s 10nm has been in the spotlight for quite some time now and we did a pretty thorough editorial designed to help readers cut through the marketing names and compare nodes on a purely technical basis. This recent update, however, is very interesting. Intel is facing so much demand for their 14nm processors right now that they simply cannot keep up.Intel ramps up 14nm production by assigning a Copy Exactly fab in Vietnam, customers can expect shipments as soon as October 8thThere was even speculation that the company had tapped TSMC to produce some of its chipsets – utter nonsense of course – but the truth wasn’t appetizing to some pundits either. As it turned out it had to fab a certain chipset at the 22 nm process – a step back from its current, insanely optimized, 14nm++ tech. There were also concerns that demand for Intel Xeon processors on the 14++ node is so high that ecosystems might actually move to EPYC if they are able to cater for them. HP was one such vendor that had sent out an advisory warning clients about shortages of Intel CPUs."

Lennon secured a huge 40 awards for marketing and digital marketing for AMD before leading their North American marketing for AMD's own Best Buy account which handled both Radeon and Ryzen products for the company. Heather will join Intel as the new Senior Manager, Digital Marketing for Graphics."""
Can't wait to get paid next week! Planning to add more shares on this stock!!!
Intel will never come back from what AMD have put out in the CPU market and if they do come back it wont be for a good 3 years. Intel is over priced and has no innovation in its roots. The reason Intel looked so good was AMD was not there to compete people were happy to pay the Intel premium including me. AMD have done more with less money and recovered. Yet Intel have considerably more $$$ and yet flopped 10nm flopped innovation. AMD may not have there own Fabs but at least there not stuck on 10nm transistor size
"Google should buy intel. Dump their cell phone business and power the internet. Now, they have software and hardware covered."
"Statistically speaking after a 15+% down day there will usually not be a second double digit drop.I just doubled down, I either loose all or I gain all. Goodluck everyone!"
Another big Issue for Intel Longs to Consider: ***INTEL DEBT position from Balance Sheet***Total Cash (mrq) 16.2B <----- this cash is 12 Billion LESS than Intels Debt before 5 Billion more for foundryTotal Cash Per Share (mrq) 3.48Total Debt (mrq) 28.61B <--- this is not counting 5 Billion more for new foundry that will take 3 years to build !AMD has almost as much cash as debt while Intel has rapidly increased debt which will greatly impact their earnings especially when their debt gets downgraded which is coming soon imo. Remember Intel must also Pay a dividend putting further strain on earnings per share and the debt limits Intels ability to buy technology or other companies or to DEFEND itself against COMPETITORS (AMD)..
Intel's fabs are running at full capacity. Thats why they are going outside for manufacturing.
"Back to40.0""s soon"
Wait till tonight they will lower guidance imohttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/04/intel-ceo-reportedly-sold-shares-after-the-company-already-knew-about-massive-security-flaws.htmlWatch and see
AMD is a pure bubble play and Nvidia isn’t doing better at all. Nvidia is more dependent on revenue from China than Intel is . Then we have that bust in bitcoin driven graphics usage . Then Intel ambitions in graphics space are going to make sure Nvidia goes dead. Qualcomm had been a good name but since it’s fight with Apple which accounted for most of its revenue I do not think it is a good play now unless they resolve their issue with Apple.
John Fortt nailed it on INTC manufacturing. Says that everybody wants in house chip manufacturing. using AAPL as an example. INTC is one that can and most likely will. He also says that the INTC chips are being unfairly compared to others. Also CNBC analyst praising Gelsinger. Wait til Gelsinger strategy is laid out next month. Do they need to be faster to compete? Yes. Will they get there? I will bet on it!

“AMD blasts Intel for 'taxing' its server CPU customers”Team Red has gone on a rather EPYC rantIn my opinion AMD is very confidant about their new EPYC server and is going on the offense To get some customers to consider what AMD has to offer..Smart move...Lack of competition has forced intel customers to pay high prices for servers with lots of complexity. AMD simple hardware setup and low price likely to result in a massive shift in business away from security ridden expensive and complex intel to AMD...AMD big customers already kicked the tires on AMD 14nm and will readily move to 7nm in July...
"Intel will be cranking out innovative chip changes in high volume at 14nm ... optane, emib multichip, integrated gigabit modems. emib fpga multichip.

"Tomorrow will be a disaster for INTC and the downdraft may create a buying opportunity for AMD. ""Professional"" money managers' algorithms link AMD&INTC."
Why is this stock getting crushed in premarket?
"Kind of humorous all of the bashing of INTC products relative to AMD. Firstly, the AMD 10 nm is approximately a half node better than INTC 14 nm and is roughly equivalent to INTC 14++ process technology. When both INTC 10 nm and AMD 7 nm products are out, the INTC product will still be more advanced due to the smaller transistor pitch. Also, for certain processes INTC appears to have more efficient algorithms for data centers. But, what I think will be the greatest advantage for INTC is their new Optane memory that will be available with Cascade Lake (14++ process) as well as 10 nm chips. Having speeds just below DRAM but with latency is a huge advance that AMD will not have available until they can incorporate MU's version of the technology on their boards."

"$INTC ouch... thats gonna hurt...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloud-companies-consider-intel-rivals-120000043.htmlSome of Intel Corp's data center customers, whose thousands of computers run cloud networks, are exploring using microchips from the market leader's rivals to build new infrastructure after the discovery of security flaws affecting most chips. Whether Intel sees a slew of defectors or is forced to offer discounts, the company could take a hit to one of its fastest growing business units. Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday the patches necessary to secure the threats could have a significant performance impact on servers."
INTC share holders keep up the good work... Stock up trend continues..
"Most under valued chip stock as lots of business depending on Intel to produce the chips, All the programmers and existing processes are Intel oriented. This is why Intel can command the supply of chips for lots of devices, IOT, 5G . servers etc. It is not easy to compete with Intel as plant investment is too hugh."
Who in their right mind is buying this right now? Wait until the news settles. This will be down from here. Sell on the news moment.
Intel just announced 4th quarter revenue to be above prior guidance
Tomorrow is your chance to sell no growth Intel.
Best of what Bob Swan's Swan Song had .. everything that he had held back (like all CEO's) over time was released... He is good for numbers !!!!

"Even Intel employee hate their stock. This was 44 , 2 months back which is crazy. Intel should innovate something, else they will struggle and AMD will take their market share."
"Consider carefully your investment in AMD. Do careful due diligence so you don't panic and throw out the jewel you have because of the ""market"". In a month at the ER we could hear a substential increase in revenues and margins out of the EPYC Rome. Don't be surprised seeing new all time highs. Remember this post. From all I read including competition from $nvda and $intc , it's clear that AMD is huge win this year."
"whole market with big gains today and intc,,, meh"
Hard to believe but guess what folks? We will be making new highs in this stock by Monday morning. One month from now we’ll will look back on the “trade war” fears and laugh. Book it.
"In the short term the market is a voting machine in the long term it’s a weighting machine. This is a valuable and profitable company, it’s industry is thriving and growing and it’s products will continue to be in high demand despite the hiccups. A true value play for investors and not hype speculators. Market is full of overhyped companies losing money hand over fist at insane valuations, bashers should go there instead. Long and strong"
Intel CEO dumps as many shares as he can then gets canned for something non business related. Not sketchy at all..... how long until we hear about his unfortunate helicopter accident?
Holding on thru the bad times will see you thru into good times... when a stock like INTC is down the way it’s been it just means I get it at a discount lol.
"Very disappointed AHs action. WTH does Wall Street want?!? Intel could not have done better - blowout revenue, earnings & forecast."

If you look at the latest posts on the AMD board you won’t like what you see. In one post you will see AMD Ryzen suroassed intel coffee lake cpu sales in July and in the other you will see that AMD has created a new high performance soc chip for a Chinese company that is producing game consoles as well as PCs in the biggest cpu market China...remember I told you to buy AMD to balance your risk in the x86 market ?
Wow! Glad I sold my long position in Nokia yesterday and held this one!
AMD fanboys will be shocked to see Intel rip AMD apart in the next 2 years.Same old story.AMD Roadkill
Got some $60 calls exp June. Lets goooo!
"Article in Benzinga Insights “5 value stocks “, and Intel was one of them . Just bought more today"
i honestly don't get intel bears. robust growth and healthy cash flow while maintaining high margins will help intel survive better than many of its comptitors. yesterday it's an old story but I say in this market a proven old story is worth 10x more than unproven growth stories.
when market corrects this thing goes to $40.
"So, could a reverse merger of Dell and VMware portend an exit for VMware CEO and former Intel exec Pat Gelsinger? Surely Michael Dell would want to lead the ""new"" company. That opens the door for Pat to come back to Intel as a possible replacement for BK. A very good thing IMO. But I'll keep my short position for now thank-you."
"Bob Swan at Intel was yelling and screaming expanding TAM for at least the past two years, maybe more. Some big-name analysts including Intel's sharpest critics have tried to explain for not seeing the explosion in demand as a pull forward related to Covid-19. Therefore unpredictable.But Intel had been and is still predicting an explosion in demand because of A.I. and 5G. They had been expanding capacity.If Intel's narrative proves to be true, this huge demand wave is not going to go away any time soon. Covid or no Covid.As the focus and the narative shifts from who has the best process technology, to who has the capacity to meet this explosive demand, I think the markets will rethink sentemant towards Intel, AMD, Nvidia and Qualcomm. Ithink ASML will also benifit."

"Activist a 'new stage in the Intel journey of decline,' says RosenblattRosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann believes the presence of activist Third Point is unlikely to change Intel's (INTC) competitive positioning for the better over the next few years. The hybrid manufacturing strategy is already expected by the Street, and if other strategic alternatives are on the table besides manufacturing, ""any customer engaged strategically with Intel today should be worried,"" says Mosesmann. The analyst calls the activist a ""new stage in the Intel journey of decline."" He keeps a Sell rating on the shares. Chip companies ""incrementally better off today"" looking to the next few years include AMD (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Nvidia (NVDA) and Xilinx (XLNX), says Mosesmann."
AMD is down on the news. Probably a better time to buy AMD than INTC
Intel will soon be in the $60’s.
"AMD chips are the new standard. Dr Su builds the whole data center with her CPU and GPU. Better performance, better price, lower power consumption."
"If they beat the street which I highly doubt they will sell on the news after running up 35% off the lows, if they don't beat this stock it's going to get crushed after running up ahead of earnings. In either case you're a bag holder. There is nothing good going to come out of buying or holding here. Earnings 1/21/21. You don't have to heed my warning I will be back to laugh at you bag holders crying in your beer. They didn't dump the CEO because a big beat the street is coming."

"I owned Intel back in the glory days 1993-2000. I left some on the table because I bought & sold it too many times, instead of holding it. But I made enough money to build the foundation for a taxable brokerage account that grew large enough to allow me to retire very early (53) back in 2015.Presently, I own about 300 shares in both the taxable account & my IRA. Purchased these back in April 2013 & reinvested all dividends. I don't look at either account that often, but when Intel ‘missed’ earlier this week, I thought I should check on their performance, & see if it might be time to sell. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the total return was 122.34% & if you compare the 5 year return of Intel vs the S&P 500, it's no contest.100.00% vs 50.00% I'll take a stock that doubles the return of the S&P 500 every 5 years all day long!Maybe those of you that are down on Intel, are expecting too much, terrible at market timing, or just too impatient ?[URL=http://www.imagebam.com/image/ca06461110234684][IMG]http://thumbs2.imagebam.com/7b/a4/7e/ca06461110234684.jpg[/IMG][/URL]"

"Intc has zero credibility with WS. If they didn't have new CEO before earnings would have gone down a lot more. Problem for Intel is they are so so behind and outsourcing will be costly and complicated for a company that has never done that on any scale. Diseased stock with no impetus for it to move up for quite awhile. Also, if AMD on Tuesday shows growth in data centre the price will drop much further especially when Intc announced a 25% drop in data centre. Enjoy your 5% increase in dividends cause it sure ain't going no where but down."

"Next week on CES new Intel motherboards will debut for the upcoming Rocket Lake. And maybe more info comes out, from the speed.

Business in China slowed DRAMATICALLY according to Intel. Dont yall see what has happened??? China stole our technology and now they are making their own chips. I hope Im wrong but thats what it looks like.
"Intels, old antique flaw cloud computing with patches vs Undervalued AMD new superior 7nm cloud computing. AMD superior products gives better GM to companies, keeping shareholders happy."
"Buy and hold $amd till Zen 5 or till the industry hits a snag. The same formula used in buying $nvda when they announced Maxwell and sell $nvda when they released Turing. Buy $intc when they released Nehalem, and sell $intc when meltdown Spectre announced. Don't listen to the pumpers just study the products, company leadership, and market demand and competitive landscape. Smart folks bought $amd when Jim Keller first announced Zen. My plan is to hold till 5G saturates the markets which is probably 3-4 years which will allow enough time for AMD to transform. After that, don't hesitate to sell if you must. Right now ASICs and fpga are hot also, we will see jump to 400GE or even 800GE soon, and this exponential jump in interconnect speeds will require massive I/O. So ASICs will be playing a big role. Newer distributed Memory architectures are key."

$intc will trade in red today. Their data center revenue has peaked and AMD will be chipping away their lunch. Intel has no chaybut to sell their memory and manufacturing division to Samsung and/or TSMC and use the buyer to can their chips. This will happen after 2022.
"TODAY's￼ Loss is not all that bad sincerely, because when you subtract 6.46% from 9.29%,the net loss in the last 24 hours is only 2.83%￼.THIS, it's not a significant metric right now.So seriously,￼ going forward, and the imminent future of this company, and stock are the most compelling concerns, because this company is STUCK in 10NM !I mean, how competitive can INTEL,be in reality Now, or in two years from now￼￼ ?!THE bottom line is,,￼ in two years from now, AMD will be MANY ￼light years away.

Can someone explain me how Intel is going to increase their profits/revenue coming years with competitors gaining traction like ARM cpu chips and AMD chips expanding in laptops and server market. Although retaining revenue seems to be within possibility for Intel if they lower their prices for their consumer cpu's when lock down and covid is behind. I argue the only reason Intel retained their revenue and profits in 2020 is due to covid and market dominance in laptop segment.

Isn't this the same flaw that was discussed in the summer? Just that now a patch is coming out? Maybe time to buy Intel and short AMD and NVDA here. Makes little sense for NVDA to be up let alone AMD on the patch news

"All these pundits playing a broken record of ""The PC market is going to contract"" - Qtr after Qtr and it did not - the truth is AMD had made the PC markets exciting again - substantial increases in performance with each generation at a very affordable price, substantial changes in features and architecture and core counts etc.It makes us all want to keep upgrading with each new generation - it keeps us all tuned in to the next big thing with anticipation and excitement! All $intc did the past 10 years was dumb down the user, dumb down their expectations, dumb down performance improvements with each generation whilst charging an arm and a leg for miniscule improvements, growth was achieved by charging more for less - no wonder the PC market stagnated - no good reasons for people to spend for incremental improvements.GO AMD!"
Tomorrow upgrade to: BUY

"What is to happen in the next few days ahead of AMD's ER is massive $intc downgrades and AMD's upgrades. Intel's CEO REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE 7nm STATUS! WOW.. he doesn't want to lie and if he tells the horrible truth, Intel's pps drops to teens, in addition to CUSTOMERS MOVING TO AMD as Intel has NO ROADMAP. No 7nm no products and its 10nm is IFFY AT BEST after failing MULTIPLE TIMES REMEMBER? As usual analysts upgrades ahead of the AMD ER they waited for Intel's ER so next week expect the PPS to jump as PTs are set higher.REMEMBER AMD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED GROWTH GUIDANCE TO 32% revenues this year from 20% to 25% !! They CONFIRMED IT last Q ER. Now look at Intel's DECLINE OF REVENUES in datacenters AND PCs WOW!What else do you need to get this loud and clear?!Next month an A EVEN BIGGER BUBBLE SET TO BURST ... $nvda !!That coupled with coming EPYC Milan and cDNA Arcturus datacenters GPUs reveal will get AMD's PPS to OVER $150! the $100 mark should be passed next week after the ER. But nVidia's PPS collapse would be way worse than Intel's possible going back to $100ish and latter as they fail get approval to buy ARM even lower. Why? AMD EPYC will lock nVidia's GPUs out of datacenters ecosystem ! Now nVidia's Ampere uses EPYC Rome in the datacenters with PCIe gen 4. The coming cDNA Arcturus datacenters GPUs will have 50 teraflops double precision - see my previous posts - vs 10 teraflops with Ampere. But the main feature is COUPLING TIGHTLY BETWEEN EPYC MILAN Arcturus using Infinity Fabric WAY BETTER THAN PCIe gen 4! That nVidia's GPUs won't get!Look at a few IBM's key technical leads moving to AMD and their work there is described as INTEGRATION BETWEEN CPUs and GPUs! What else do you need?GPUs are essential to supercomputers and most heavily processing is done with GPUs. If nVidia's future GPUs had a competitive chance, nVidia WOULD HAVE WON AT LEAST ONE BID OF SUPERCOMPUTER THE DOE AWARDED! They got 0. Including the next year first exascale Frontier so this nVidia's bubble burst is very close otherwise nVidia's GPUs would have been in Frontier at least, for AI and high performance computing. That's it, I rest my case. I call to both nVidia's and Intel's longs to SELL NOW and BUY AMD ASAP!The writing on the wall is very clear.Don't be fooled !"
INTC will be up 10% today... just like TSM
The person who really needs to be canned more than Bob Is the INTC chair. This guy oversaw and allowed the company where it is today and he is still there making bad calls. Loeb needs to push for replacing the entire board and get some new talents into the company. That will really fix the problems once and for all.

So essentially the new CEO plans to have majority of Intel chips fabricated in-house. That's doubling down on node leadership. I like that. The projected cash flows will take care of capital needs and supply issues with TSMC will ensure competition will not be able to make much in roads into Intel's market.High risk and potentially high reward. I will be adding further to my position.
Not smart enough when listening to pat moorhead from moor tech. Talking about intel. Didnt give it a high recommendation but didnt call for large change either.

Intel is doomed until, they get rid of all the old obsolete talent and start looking for the next Lisa, they will remain 2 steps behind."
Intel is up $6 in the last month and AMD is pretty much flat. seems intel better buy.

But when you compare Intel with its peers you would think that is a company full of debt about to go bankrupt with such a low market cap."
"If Intel chips at 14nm are staying at a striking distance vs AMD 7nm chips, then it follows that the company pocketed huge savings by not having done the expensive, low yield, and complicated EUV.While in the long term, it may have cost Intel the experience needed with EUV, and the process lead, in the short term it means that Intel saved a lot and was forced to look for other ways to boost performance, like superfin."

"From a Reuters article on Yahoo: ""Intel on Monday said its ""Ice Lake"" server chips made on its 10-nanometer process would start ramping up production this quarter, though it did not give specific volumes."" Some of the unsourced leaks in the last month were that production would be delayed on 10nm server chips. Apparently that isn't true. AH short covering IMO."
"The class action suits are a waste of time and will amount to nothing. Intel has never guaranteed absolute performance levels for any processor. The company guarantees that the chip will operate the way it was designed. And they are doing exactly that. Neither the Meltdown nor Spectre exploit reveal a ""flaw"" or ""bug"" in Intel's processors. What those exploits reveal is an assumption in chip design that is no longer true. There is a good analogy to this issue in military history. For centuries industrialized nations built vast naval fleets to project their military and political power around the world. The prevailing assumption among military leaders was that the only threat to the naval fleet was from another naval fleet. Then in the early part of the 20th century when aviation was still young an aviator named Billy Mitchell theorized that an airplane could carry a bomb and sink a large naval vessel, and then he proved it could be done. Does this mean the ships were designed incorrectly because there was a new of attacking a ship from the air? Absolutely not, it simply means the prevailing assumptions about the nature of attacks had to expand and adapt and they did. But once again, there is NO flaw, NO bug and therefore No basis for a class action suit."

Swan needs to state his vision and plans to deal w competitors and market share.
Ironically.. Intel does not really need you to buy it's stock. It is a money making powerhouse. Starting to become a real contender as a dividend stock.
"In comparison with other stocks, INTC is under valued with a PE of only 15. Should be worth $55."
"Like the idea of Swan as the CEO. Intel cannot continue to try to grow organically into the hotly contested, huge markets. That has not worked for them. They must take leadership in these market by buying market share leaders with strong technology. There is no one better than a CFO to understand the most profitable way to do that. He has more than enough smart technical people who can advise him."
"Good news for AMD from Apple but Bloomberg reports aren't reliable. However, allow me to give you my insight.1. Clearly no exclusive $intc any longer for Macbooks. 2. Please READ the article! It's nothing close to x86 performance as tge compare with smartphones ARM chips isn't the right comparison !3. Note the Apple exploring software tool to allow existing applications written for x86 run on ARM. This is Software based EMULATION super slow. 4. Microsoft has tried that with windows RT and software emulation of x86. Too slow and failed. They still offer it but no bog advantage to use ARM. Especially AMD's chips are priced very attractive not like Intel's for what they do.

"Like INTC's prospect in 2018, has been a long time INTC holder. Own both stocks and call options. With the current business environment, I will think Apple will shift more orders to INTC, since they don't like QCOM and probability will not want to make AVGO too powerfully especially if the QCOM+AVGO merger goes through. The net neutrality got repealed by FCC yesterday will like be a boon for data center which is their bulk of revenue and profit sources. Also like that fact that they try to go into AI and automotive business for diversification. Good luck longs."

"Intel Amd takes intel Proctor Gamble“AMD Nails Its Epyc Server Targets For 2018”The second 5 percent chunk of server shipment market share for chip maker AMD is probably going to come easier than the first 5 percent share, which was attained as AMD exited the fourth quarter and, significantly, was a stake in the ground that chief executive officer Lisa Su drove into the ground in late 2016 as the “Naples” Epyc ramp got under way.Everybody has been watching to see if AMD would make its server share numbers, and as expected, big deals with the hyperscalers – mainly Amazon, Microsoft, and Tencent – helped bring home the market share bacon for the Naples Epyc generation.“Fourth quarter server unit shipments more than doubled sequentially based on growing demand for our highest end, 32-core Epyc processors with cloud, HPC, and virtualized enterprise customers,” Su explained on the call yesterday after the market close with Wall Street analysts. “As a result, we believe we achieved our goal of mid-single-digit server unit share exiting 2018. We had another strong quarter of cloud adoption, highlighted by industry leader Amazon announcing new versions of their most popular EC2 computing instances powered by Epyc processors. Businesses can easily migrate their AWS instances to AMD and save 10 percent or more based on the technology advantages of our platform. Microsoft Azure also announced general availability of their AMD based storage instance in the quarter, as well as a new HPC instance powered by Epyc processors that is 33 percent faster than competitive X86 offerings.”Su called out some HPC system wins, including clusters based on Epyc processors going into Procter and Gamble, the US Department of Energy (the NERSC-9 “Perlmutter” system), and the University of Stuttgart, and notably a system at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory that employs both Epyc processors and Radeon Instinct GPU accelerators that will be employed for data analytics and machine learning workloads. While there has been a fair amount of tire kicking and testing among enterprise customers and HPC centers said Su, it is the hyperscalers and cloud builders who are driving the shipments of Epyc processors at this point, and it is these same customers who will be at the front of the line for the Rome Epycs, which are socket compatible and which will provide a big bump in performance when they are launched in the middle of this year and ramp in the second half.“As we look into 2019, I would expect that the early Rome deployments will also be cloud based,” said Su. “It will be the first ones, but we have a strong set of enterprise platforms."

2018 was most profitable year for Intel.Reports are going to be solid and above the expected.
"Even if Intel gives back all its gains, it's still ten points higher than it was five days ago and not likely going back."
"If INTC's ER and CC were so bad and would benefit other chip makers why are they all down today with exception of a Measly gain for AMD. NVDA down $5, MU down$2, AMD up $1.66, TSM down $5, QCOM down $2. Stay the course because someones BUYING your shares."
INTC profit up over 40% two qtrs in a row. beating estimates over 24% two qtrs in a row..That is SUPER NOVA beat and it is as good as nVDA. better than MSFT and FANG stocks.

"Welcome George C Davis! The new CFO of Intel! The good ol boy network is alive and well... tens of millions in options and bonuses. FOR WHAT?! Davis will get a pay bump at Intel, SEC filings show. He’ll earn a salary of $900,000 per year, quarterly bonuses of roughly $21,000 each, and an annual cash bonus of $1.4 million. Starting next year, he’ll be eligible to earn $6.5 million in annual stock grants, and additional performance-based stock options.As a new employee, he’ll also get a $4 million sign-on bonus and a new hire equity grant of $10 million in stock, both payable over his first three years of employment."
Intel again with big reversal after failing just before 49.Until earnings 48-49.Then 50+ is possible if they beat and back to 44 when they miss.

Where is the new CEO? It has been 8 months now! What’s going on at Intel!?
Happy days are here again !Very Strong Buy Imo.
"The reason why Intel has a problematic 10nm node is that Intel chose to use DUV+SADP instead of EUV (what TSMC uses) to manufacture 10nm. EUV is a more advanced etching technology which allows the etching to become more precise. When Intel started at 10nm, EUV was not ready yet. So Intel had to come up with a clever workaround on DUV, namely Self Aligned Double Patterning, which allows them to apply the older technology to newer nodes (10nm). But the workaround is not perfect; etching the wafer multiple times simply causes the edge to blur and increases defects. TSMC started on 10nm later, and they went ahead with the newest technology at the time, I.e. EUV. Note that Intel has access to EUV now as well, and they've pledged to switch back to EUV for their 7nm and 5 nm node. EUV, combined with Intel’s experience on multi-patterning technology, will allow Intel to push much faster towards newer nodes (5nm and 3nm). That's why I bet that Intel will regain the process advantage going forward."

"I've been investing a long time but I have rarely seen such a large well-known company get whipped around by the professionals after hours. Reality is that the earnings call, the Q4 print, the Q1 guide were all rock solid and are being completely ignored! ""Sophisticated"" shorts are covering like mad pre-market taking advantage of panicking Robinhooders (""why's the stock down?"") sell their shares, allowing shorts to buy and cover. Wherever the stock eventually opens that will be the low for the day and potentially for rest of the the year. Stock will certainly finish north of $60 today and if the market rallies I wouldn't be surprised to see this stock finish up for the day. Great stock for the next 3-4 years in my view trading at 10X earnings and HSD FCF yield with a new management catalyst. Classic ""fat pitch"" value buy."
TSM is biting off more than they can chew. Too many customers across the globe demanding chips. Chinese wanting to keep Taiwan under their thumb and US wanting to liberate them. Something is going to change.. We need a US chip manufacturer that can be trusted. Our national security is a priority.
52 week low 35.74 very doable!
Good fundamentals always win out in the end GO INTC !
"Rider, Broke YET ?! LOL ?!"
"Seems a lot of folks like Intel, in a decent market we would be at $50 easy. Pick up some shares a bit at a time, this thing will rebound big in a short time."

He can't answer 10nm ETA honestly. Wordplay.
INTC was in the mid to low 40's just 6 months ago. I expect the mid to low 40's will be the settling point over the next month. Should be an opportunity at that level.
"Don't listen to all the noise, INTC is extremely well positioned for future growth Imo Very Strong Buy"
"I'll definitely pick up more INTC shares here around $46, year end tax selling is a good time to add. I think INTC is a cheap way to enter the automotive self-driving or assisted-driving technologies through its Mobileye division."
Intel 14nm = TSMC 7nm. Thats a fact. Rocketlake chip proves it.
looks like we are going into a narrow trade within narrow bands....and then later today UP WE GO. Narrow bands must always be resolved UP or DOWN but selling is washed out and 3 days have passed and we should be fine. Also keep on old school csco. Boolean
100 before AMD.
If you sold you sold way too early. Much larger gains coming as INTC is way undervalued and the industry awoke the sleeping giant. INTC is now back in the game making changes and they have a fat wallet. Put a higher tech valuation on this and you will see 80 sooner than later!
I expect Intel to LOWER guidance for next quarter.. I expected them to do it last quarter and was wrong so my track record is not good but I think I am going to be right this time..
ZACK rating this morning: INTC strong buy.
"Wall Street just wants to use every chance to pressure intel to manufacture chips overseas to save cost. Yes, Intel’s foundry is part of national security. But does Wall Street care? Our last president wants to keep manufacturing and jobs in USA. See what happened? Wall Street and corporations got him out because he is an obstacle to their wealth."
"i think Intel should build more complete solutions like NUC. unlike NUC laptop they should directly go to customer. If apple, microsoft can make their own processeor, intel too can make own laptop/ desktop. already intel works closely with OEMs in all aspects of design, this why we get better designed laptops from same manufacturers come with Intel cpu in it."
"the announement of using external fabs/processes is a threat to both amd and nvda. Intel is supposed to spike on this news, not amd and nvda."

"AMD eating $INTC market share.""The business segment that generates the most revenue for Intel, the Client Computing Group, hit $9.82 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter, up 10 percent but below the $10.01 billion consensus estimate among analysts polled by FactSet."""
"Seriously, Intel has tons of security vulnerabilities, noone in their right mind will choose their chips because it will turn out as a disaster in the end. AMD and TSMC will have to produce chips on full steam to meet the growing demand. Nobody will want to be left behind. If I were $AMD I would auction chips to the highest bidder :D"

Works both ways when hedge fund long manipulation to destroy hedge funds shorts..............I'm not complaining. Its works until retail investor sells to take profits.
So intel is buying 166M shares tomorrow at $60 If I am reading the SEC filing correctly. Roughly 5% of outstanding shares. Short interest remains at ~16%. If those shares are traded upon open we are looking at a huge pop. Hopefully I am correct in what I interpret it.
I think it is good news the CEO resigned. We need some change in intel.
I'm dumping if and when it gets to 48. I might get back in when this looks like it might be back on track. Honestly don't think that will happen until this time next year In the mean time I need my money to work for me and know it will not be AMD I'm looking to add to my FDC if anyone cares to check it out
"INTC Earnings: We should have 7nm in 2023?!!! This alone is enough to drop it >10%. Three years from now, can you imagine what the competition has done while INTC plays catch up? They keep delaying the release of the next-generation 7-nanometer chips, down big Friday I predict."
will go to 40s soon
Chips and software are the way to play the EV market. Everybody will be making EV but Mobileye will be in all the cars. and Intel chips will be in all of Mobileye. Load the truck till this hits $100.
Apple's copying trumps negotiating tactics for a lower price on intel's cpu's.
"Can/should MSFT seek to acquire INTC? I know it's a big chunk to swallow, but INTC is currently cheap, it has its own fabs (but hasn't been using them to maximum benefit). With the resurgence of AMD and NVIDIA (not to mention AAPL making chip designs in-house), I don't think that there would be antitrust issues. If MSFT acquired AMD, what would the impact be on INTC?"

This just shows how much Intel is oversold! lookout shorts!
The big funds already left and went to AMD and made it rise. Now they will drop it and take the profit and go back to INTC. 25% upside to $60 coming.
"Gents, It took NVDA a long time to establish the multiples. They needed to show sustainable growth and profitability. AMD is on the same trajectory. Look at the price/share for $NVDA compared to Revenue. Compare to AMD the last year, as products leadership and flawless execution kept rolling. $INTC is a great company, that is 2-3 years behind.

Huawei giving up their 7nm TSMC's allocation is a lot of capacity now available for AMD just matching additional demand way more than planned before and ised for revenues outlook this year because of the corona new demand! This is high margins datacenters chips but 7nm laptops have way higher margins and prices than the 12nm past generation. Net is substantial revenues increase due to higher prices amd gets including latest EPYC Rome chips with high clock speeds $intc cannot match and coming datacenters cDNA GPUs. $10b revenues updated for this year at the ER raising pps to $100 latter in the year as more products are announced including Zen3 killing $intc and big Navi killing $nvda !Very soon after the ER we jump to $70... clearly. So option calls for 2022 are best to play this coming jump and enjoy even higher in 2021 as Zen4 5nm is coming out! Maybe capturing $200 pps ! Think of a 10x gain with options. You pay $15 for $50 option in 2022 pps is $200 that's $150 higher than $50 so your $15 got you $150 profits.. 10X !

"Intel will release its first discrete graphics chips in 2020 to compete against NVDA and AMD. The discrete graphics market will become a three-way race and Intel's role as a leader in the industry will no doubt allow it to capture meaningful marketshare, just like Intel did with its embedded graphics for business applications. Intel does not even have to deliver the highest performing graphics chips to enter the market, rather it can aim at the volume segment of the market and work its way up. Whether Intel chooses to do this remains to be seen but it is a proven strategy for a company entering a new product space."
Intel to file for bankruptcy during the Q&A portion of the earnings call?
i held this stock for close to 6 months but sold at $57 a week ago. the last earnings call it went from $54 all the way down to $44 the night of earnings it dropped $10 and continued to bleed for weeks.
This is gonna be a about imbedded AI systems and mobile eye
"No matter how you look at INTC, it's very cheap at these prices. Once the company turns around, it will double in a matter of 6 months."
"I initially laughed at M1 made by Apple. What?? Apple making CPUs now? But, it turned out that the chip is AMAZING. And this is only the start. It made me wonder what Intel has been doing so far? It is slowly losing competition on PC market due to AMD. Ok it's alright, Intel has the control over the servers. All the clouding companies still need chips from Intel. But what? Microsoft and Amazon are seeking to develop their own chips?? Wonder if Intel has any secret weapon to overcome these challenges..."
Sweet time to short again!
Options expiring tomorrow: Today's close: $44.99
2.5 b above estimate. Quarterly rev
"anandtech has article, intel-teases-ponte-vecchio-xehpc-power-on-posts-photo-of-server-chip ,Has a picture of a Xe-HPC (Ponte Vecchio). Maybe 7nm is working after all..."
Intel chips make classy shirt buttons.
I will not be surprised that ETF starting to add INTC back... because they see it rising.
TSMC 3 nm = INTC 10nm (SuperFin). TSMC is way behind.
"LMAO, beat estimates, yet everything is down YoY... go figure. Just wait until that sinks in!"
Did anything else happened beside new CEO?
$INTC keeps getting roasted on twitter for their spin marketing tweets. AMD feedback on Twitter has jumped significantly!
"Staying for the dividend yield! I wanted to buy AMD but they don't pay me a dividend with their $8bn revenue a year :( It's too small, but Intel can with $70bn. It's a beautiful thing!"
"Don't under estimate Lisa Su. She is one smart CEO. PHD, Scientist, Engineer and workaholic. She is coming after Intel with both barrels blazing"
Morning fellas. Intel is better than AMD. Deal with it AMD trolls. Thank you.
Boom!
Earnings date April 26 so there is plenty of room to run up before then.
Way to go Dan! Easy way to boost your performance for year end and try and beat the general market return. Write an activist letter and leak it! These fund managers should be reined in!
"What kind of CEO does INTC have?First statement: ""The reports of the security flaw are not true""[quickly turned out to be a lie]Second Statement: "" Yes, it's true, but not our problem, all CPUs have this problem""[AMD and ARM both stated they DO NOT have this security flaw, only Intel does]Third Statement (I am speculating, this hasn't happened yet): ""My selling all my Intel shares possible is NOT related to this security flaw. It's for 'personal reasons' ""[ha ha ha .... 'personal reasons' is right...]Fourth Statement (I am speculating, this hasn't happened yet): ""Hey Lisa, how much do you want for licensing ZEN ?"""
"Great time to buy. Dividend, low PE, growing and demand is there. one of only tech companies that pay you to make money. Great dividend."
"Wow. I had no idea Intel was sitting on 29 Billion in debt, and that's without retooling their 10nm foundry."
INTC: could go to 60$ by fridayThis time correction should be REAL HARD bcz All indexs are all time HIGH
"AMD trolls ~ get real. In the past year, AMD HAS gone from $14.08 to $15.26. INTC has risen from $34.07 to $49.66. Do the math."

why intc needs to replace CEO before the earning? are they doing bad on this earning quarter? hmmmm...
The stock is good to buy but i will go lower until 21 of January
"￼￼LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:From $68.09, to $46, Then to$59.50 ?!NOW, the stock is still 20% LOWER, ￼from its all time high￼,And you tell me artificial, paid journalists, are going to motivate, ￼Investors￼this to allocate money to a stock that is still 20% off, of its all time high ?This, which has not worked WELL yet￼, as INTC it's still only $57.58.SO, the point is,despite all the positivity, all the positive paid articles,￼￼ The compelling, and unprecedented change in the CEO, WHO is supposed to perform miracles￼, AMD is STILL, $29.50 HIGHER then Intel, & ready to climb again.INTEL, who happens to be ￼(it's OWN￼ BEST Customer), because of billions in SPENT on buybacks is still 20% lower than its all time high ! LOL￼￼￼￼￼￼THE bottom line is,""the artificial allocations, still have NOT have worked, & are failing miserably￼."
We love the stock..
"AMD has been taking back share in recent times, as we’ve seen in several reports, but not in Q4 according to Mercury Research, where it slipped to 19%, compared to 20.2% the previous quarter."
"Sad! I really don't know what's Intel's new strategy for manufacture. Intel could continue to perfect 7nm process. Meanwhile, Intel should use TSMC's 5nm or even 3nm to compete against AMD, Nvidia, and Apple. Why will Intel just stay at 7nm for most of manufacture until 2023? It doesn't make any sense totally."
INTC management is watching their stock drop after recommitting to in house manufacturing. I would think Gelsinger will try to reverse course when he details their plan in 2 weeks. Look for a pop after he addresses shareholders mid Feb. Still a cash generating machine. They have to execute or get left behind but still a value at this price!
The new CEO will unlock the value of INTC..
Facts still facts.. INTC still grows a lot better than people give its credit...Should have been 200 already
"INTC bears run out of reason to bash INTC..AMD running out of pumpers ( the short selling is like to nothing) , you are on your own to buy overpriced stocks."
"At the Height of the Dotcom bubble, Intel was selling for $75 and some change. Think about it, today is a more solid company with even higher revenues! What does that tell you? This should be trading at $75-$85 easy! The smart ones will buy now for their retirement"
Loeb gonna jack us up. Buy all dips under $70.
This drop is crazy... goes against what analysts are saying. There have been 13 price target raises today and this share price falls ~8%. Market narrative is all messed up.
Intel has powered down the 10nm tools.....only ones up and running still are in Oregon at their R&D site.............do you still need more evidence?https://semiaccurate.com/forums/showthread.php?9182-Intel-kills-off-the-10nm-process
"I am NOT selling @60. My target is $70, in part, thanks to 5G. It might take one more year...INTC's AI is becoming a driver for INTC."
Don't worry boys. Some people bought Tesla for $900
over 8 class action lawsuits are filed against intel..look it up .which means the company will take a big financial hit
"Yesterday I said, ""I'm a bit concerned that we might be entering a bull trap."" I was about to buy in when price went above $50, but volume was weak, down volume was greater than buy volume, so I held off. For now it's just a waiting game to see who is going to control the markets, the bulls or the bears."
"AMD will lose market shares this Q again, as Intel slashes prices on its 10th gen chips to make way for 11th gen tiger lake chips."
"Intel shares drop, three-year outlook seen lagging rivals:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-launch-7nm-chip-products-194524969.htmlIntel Corp shares declined 2.5 percent on Wednesday after executives forecast modest profit growth over the next three years, signaling it is likely to lag big rivals as the once-dominant chipmaker catches up in technology.Kinngai Chan, a Summit Insights Group analyst, said Intel's forecast means it might grow more slowly than other large chipmakers, especially in terms of profit.Intel ""is admitting to gross margin pressures in the next 2.5 years and that earnings will only keep pace with topline growth,"" Chan said. Chan said Intel's peers were likely to report 5 percent revenue growth in coming years, but with profits growing faster than revenue rather than along with it as Intel has forecast.Swan gave the long-term outlook less than two weeks after Intel cut its 2019 sales forecast, citing weak data center sales in China.“We let you down. We let ourselves down,” Swan said of the quarterly results last month."

Looks like Pat is picking up where Bob has left off. More pain...
17m and 22m shorted on Thursday and Friday respectively. I hope Intel announce something big and squeeze them hard.
"Why is Intel’s 80% of the chip market worth only $59.00 per share, while AMD’s 20% of the market worth $91.00 per share? Would that mean if AMD owned 100% of the chip market its share price would be $75.00 per share, the average of the two? And what about Nvidia? Would their share price be a fraction of what it is today if it owned 80% of the market? One wonders!"
rising tide lifts all boats. That is the case with $intc today.But tomorrow Intel will lose again and $AMD will rise again.
Will be deep red by tomorrow
I added 5000 shares..
I believe Intel will rule the self driving market same as they did with PC back in the day.

Stay above $50 is consider a good day.
Wells Fargo upgrade AMD and raise price target? they downgraded Intel and raised Intel price target... they can only upgrade AMD and lower AMD price target as it really us binary.$AMD $INTC
Last place
You can either buy NVDA and AMD at a combined $438B for $6B in free cash flow or INTC at $256B for $35B in free cash flow. I know where I'm putting my money...
WOOOW! MONEY MONEY MONEY <3
"In the third quarter of 2018, 41.3 million iPhones were sold worldwide. so intc made all them chips and all the other chip and sold all the chips that they can produce and many here are down grading them. Good luck to all you that believe intc is not a good company.Guess your right there not good there great."
Now analysts have to revise the estimates and raise the price target...
The high target is now 82.. how convenient.
Intel is still at near 52 wk highs while AMD that I currently own is near 52 week lows. Yes sad isn’t it?
"2021 will be way better than 2020, I can put all my money on this"

Intel CPU can achieve 5.3GHz on 14nm. AMD goes up to 4.37GHz on 7nm. Do your homework and try to predict what's coming.
Buy Buy Buy INTC ! Imo.
Barclays upgrades AMD and downgrades INTC
""" Intel needs an activist shareholder to step in ""This is my post this morning around 11:30.... :)"
Why INTC is up?
"intel WAS a superior chip than amd. That's why I was a very long time 20+ year shareholder.AMD IS a far superior chip than intc NOW. I am not shorting INTC, yet."
Under 50 sounds good
"Judging by the volume of 15.5M, Intel has spent roughly 730M on share buyback. They might not have allotted enough funds for the buy backs"
Good entry price for INTC. Shorted AMD on Friday and made money. May do again on Monday. Been around long enough to recognize this same old pattern and profit from it. Recommend a long position on INTC.
Monday its back to $55. This happens every earnings report.
Only problem with INTC is they are buying themselves into IRRELEVANCE. Another $10B buy back will likely be announced this year.
breakup could come soon.
Get ready for the bounce back incoming. Just bought more shares. Fantastic earnings the future is bright!
How far is it going to drop after hours? Give everything back?

"Intel has designed and manufactured the bulk of its most important products in-house, a strategy that helped it dominate U.S. chipmaking for nearly 50 years. For 2020. It was posting record annual sales of $77.9 billion in 2020 with no end in sight, up from $72 billion in 2019. It could be just the beginning as it will expand its production with multiple streams and possibly partners to meet the insatisable demands."

"I just bought some INTC. I am long on INTC. It has a solid roadmap, a wide range of products, a solid distribution channel and it does not depend on a foundry owned by Taiwan or Abu Dhabi to make its products. INTC controls it's own destiny.

"""Real men have fabs"" said Jerry Sanders, ex-AMD CEO ironically.There is a reason he said so. Here is what Qualcomm CEO said today:“If we could make more, we could sell it,” Qualcomm CEO Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in an interview.Intel is poised to ride on its ability to ramp-up as and when needed as it owns its fabs. There is no end to supply woes till AT LEAST 2H21. Intel will sell WHATEVER it can manufacture with handsome margins.It should be recalled that servers/cloud infrastructure is bound for a massive upgrade this year owing to slack in 2021. FB has allocated 23bn for infrastructure, Google/AMZN all reported handsome results. Samsung/SK Hynix and Micron have already pointed to huge upswing in memory sales in servers as well as PCs.Intel's Xeons are already being sampled and no one will even consider AMD as they can't even ensure supply.Intel is going to report stellar sales again. And the decision to keep fabs by Gelsinger will pay massive dividends to Intel shareholders in long run when world realizes they can not bank ONLY on TSMC."
Test
Intel has alreay announced it will beat expectations for the 4th quarter. It has also announced a new CEO. What then can Intel do at the the next ER meeting to keep the positive momentum going forward?S.L.
The numbers won’t lie. Wait till next earnings??? No chance against AMD
Anyone know if intel could benefit from or are already considering in a big way from acquiring $NNDM or purchasing their Dragonfly product for 3D printing
Intel is a 85 usd Stock....we will see in 3 months. New ceo will satisfy the stockholders interst.For me the biggest bargain at WALLSTREET.
The entire intel board should be fired. They lack the vision of a tech co board. Why didn’t they announce like $20B buyback? 5% div increase? You kidding? Why not look into hiring someone from TSMC or equivalent company for CEO? Why such a lower cap like VMW? We would have been $70 today had they collaborated with TSMC...period.
Dr. Su has AMD and arguably the chip sector on the correct trajectory. $INTC still value on its own and $MU being dragged along for as long as there is energy.$SNAP defies odds with a tremendous year and $TSLA remains as one of my top speculative picks.On record and to the point as always. Due your own due diligence.
AMD upgraded again for about the 10th time AMD is the #1 highest stock gainer in the s&p this year..Since only AMD and intel can make x86 cpus what does this imply about Intels future revenue and earnings ?

The fact that intel has made a ninth generation of 14 nano today is a testament to their fear of AMD 7nm launch and failure of 10 nm. They just released headlines on launch but the stock only up 1 penny.....Hmmmmmmm
"When 10nm ramps up in the second half of the year, looks like it will be used for a new generation of FPGAs, as well as be available for some 3GHz A75 ARM chips. That should bring some interesting announcements.http://www.storagereview.com/intel_shows_off_new_tech_ships_1st_64layer_3d_nand_for_data_center""Intel gave an update on its “Falcon Mesa” technology, a coming generation of FPGAs using the 10nm process technology and foundry platform. The new FPGA was claimed to be able to offer new levels of performance to support the growing bandwidth demands of data center, enterprise and networking environments.""""The company announced that its agreement with ARM and Intel Custom Foundry is proceeding. The agreement centered around accelerating the development and implementation of ARM SoCs on Intel's 10nm process. Intel showed the first results of this agreement in a 10nm wafer containing ARM Cortex-A75 CPU cores implemented with industry standard design flows enabling performance in excess of 3 GHz."""
"I've never seen a board like this, where i have to mute more than 1/2 the posters."
I have always loved this company with all my heart. Worked for it for 13 years. Love it.

INTC' goal is to accelerate 10nm production 2020 and 2021. We will see a wave of upgrades..5G stations will continue to grow..
INTC and AMD Will meet at 36. Thank your highly paid management!
"One day there is a chip shortage, next day there isn’t. Market has schizophrenia"
As the details become more clear about who has the big problem and who does not AMD becomes the clear winner imohttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/amd-is-big-winner-from-chip-flaw-fiasco.html
Intel collapsing before earnings! Insider know guidance for 2019 will be abysmal!
Intel GPU? niceeee move now :)
.89 vs .87 expected. It’s a beat but stock prices is not always about earnings. It’s why people are in it for the long run
"INTL PE is 9.5. AMD PE is 125. INTL earnings dwarf AMDs total revenue. I'm not invested in either, but these numbers are glaring, regardless of current circumstances."
"l think intc can reach $62 per share in short-term, because it's EARNINGS very good, it's front view bright, it's products sales will strong growth next year,"
I’m a buyer at $19
When will they release earnings tonight?
Why intel is up?
where is the AAPL effect in chip stocks after hours?? why INTC slipping?
Sincere chance of seeing $100 in next 3 years?? I like slow steady growth with great Dividend.
INTC isn't going out of business... First off this is a wake up call. 2nd Lisa Su already put the play book out there and I'm sure INTC was watching. In any event AMD has made a run but at the same time they must deliver. INTC should know about that and what not delivering does. I am now watching to see how INTC comes back. It's not a question if they will come back it's rather a question of with what? I'm sure that INTC will be in the battle so I doubt this was taken lightly.
I can't wait to hear the Intel earnings call when they admit they are losing market share to AMD and that is the reason for lowered guidance.Brian Krzanich confirmed this before he resigned.$AMD $INTC
GE used to buyback shares to keep artificially the stock up at new highs until they needed cash to paid big debt. GE reminds me of Intel with big debt and buybacks................
Seems to me that short covering could take this stock much higher.The new CEO will take Intel to a split in 18 months. Massive profit growth is in the cards.

Still above 50? Amazing.
So many AMD lovers here today. Welcome kids :)
New CEO is exceptionally good.
futures are down. INTC is looking to open substantially lower. Pumpers will call it a buying opportunity. Looks like they will have many buying opportunities over the next 5 years.
Brand new tone to INTC knowing that Loeb didn't sell. Buy.
Mantra.. Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Repeat this 5 times daily and be happy.

Intel blames everything else except its own execution. Whats the real truth about 10nm?? It will never be fixed.

"So I signed out to see what the trolls I've muted have to offer and the first troll I see is Snoopy posting an 18 month old article talking about azure. Maybe you didn't know this, but Microsoft grew their azure cloud 73% in the past year and Amazon grew their cloud also, contradicting your intel stock. Maybe you haven't heard that they both use AMD and increased their AMD instances and are committed to security. There is no security in any intel chip. Did you also hear about Google using AMD for their Gaming Cloud, not to mention the many other fortune 100 and 500 companies turning to AMD. It seems none of AMD'S customers projected a slowdown due to China and nor did AMD. 2018 Microsoft blamed intel for not having very stellar results because intel couldn't produce the chips. I told everyone they wouldn't allow that to happen 2 quarters in a row, guess what? they didn't allow it to happen and the way they prevented it was buying AMD chips. China was a convenient excuse for intel, but no one else is using China for an excuse, just intel. By the way, you wonder why AMD people post on intel board, you and bobbysue, drool, jayn and the rest coming here to post your drivel, is the reason we return the favor. The difference between the two companies though is; we are actually projecting growth and producing the products, unlike until; that projects slower growth due to China and until delaying product after product and only producing photo-shopped pictures of what they dream about producing. Oh yes, they do have 14nm+++++++++, which pretty soon will have to be labeled using exponents soon. $INTC will end the year lower than they started the year."

All companies have setbacks. Remember Apple almost went belly up. Intel is a best of breed that stumbled. Great buying opportunity now. AMD great company but WAY over valued at current share price.
Might turn red by end of day. All other chip stocks soaring. The truth of the demise is starting to get traction.
"Does INTC have a future beyond X86? Isn’t the Nvidia/Arm combo a huge long-term threat? The valuation is extremely compelling here, but what will Intel look like in 10+ years? What say y’all?"

All the news and competition around the semi space has woken up the sleeping Giant! INTC has the balance sheet and now I believe the motivation to be innovative and a leader once again. If you kick the dog enough he will bite!
The 50's will be long behind us and alot of you will kick yourself for dumping it when you did. This is a strong Buy at these levels with what is coming very soon.
Just bought 20k. Can you feel the take off
Still red AHs. We were maybe green for like 30 mins tops. Been red AHs most of the time. #$%$
The brokerages/analysts should be eviscerated for selling the public a pack of lies about INTC imo.

"Intel published some post-patch benchmark results on best-case PCs like this on its blog. The tests showed an average performance loss of between 2 and 7 percent in the SYSMark 2014 SE benchmark, which simulates productivity tasks and media creation. Its responsiveness score—which measures “‘pain points’ in the user experience when performing common activities”—plummeted by a whopping 14 percent, though. In web applications that use heavy amounts of JavaScript, Intel saw a 7 to 10 percent performance loss post-patch. These tests were performed on SSD-equipped systems; Intel reports the performance loss is less noticeable if you’re using a traditional hard drive."
$57 closing.
The new leader of GPUs & CPUs undervalued AMD $91.53 or NVDA $554.70...............You can run with coordinated charlatan articles?
"Everything AMD announced at computex we already knew. But many people needed that to jump-start confidence. We longs have dissected everything on this board already. there's more behind the scenes that we do not yet know and we should be hearing about those soon I hope or at least hints here and there. Likely there will be some significant projects fueled by increased revenues that will be announced in due time. AMD is a growth story, it's always been that since Dr. Su formed the A-Team, and the direction and lucrativeness of this growth is what AMD leadership is all about going forward from this point. With TSMC taking lead and AMD's solid designs all the way to Zen 5, there's absolutely negative chance Intel can catch up now, especially after the recent security issues. Intel won't die or anything but decline will be slow and painful over next few years as Intel continues to experiment and fail repeatedly. Intel's GPU project is also fairly high risk. Keep an ey on AMD's APU strategy because the timing of this final nail on Intel's Whiskey lake coffin is crucial for a TKO. I'd abandon $intc asap. Also, Nvidia has never ever faced a fully ressurected and strong AMD before, so it will be an incredible challenge for $nvda to carve out their moat. There's plenty in store for AMD, this HPC market is bigger than most believed because superpowers are now scrambling for dominancy and not just global corporations."

Intel is not the company it was where innovation was important. Now its more important to have other social goals. In this cut throat industry even a small delay is terminal. I believe it will eventually get back what they miss but when and at what cost. They gave away the cell phone chip - throwing in the towel on memory. Trying to keep the CPU and not doing a great job. they do have a great product but it has not advanced for a while letting others to catch up. Surely they can see what the problem is and fix it?? I would rate it a hold. (which means sell soon and buy back lower. )
Shorts caught with pants down. Gotta love it.
"New CEO comes in, just giving it a little push.. INTC will be 200.. like nVDA pe."
Congrats AMD holders. AMD is a few cents up from a year ago. Hope you make a truck of money off of that
"haha, i love this board. The Level of Self-destruction is just beyond ..... :-) this is your chance to sell.Intel will loose more before they can compete against AMD. Sell on this news and buy again arround 45. Believe me, wait for the Earnings..."
"With all that internet stocks surges over 100% because of work from home?Don't you think INTC deserves to surge over 100% this year because of the same thing..With that, PE still below semi stock average and of course cheaper than most cloud stock valuation."
"I would so sell and buy AMD, double your shares."
Par Gelsinger was not going to go down in history as the one who gave up on Intel’s own fabs. But in reality there was no way that TSMC could have the capacity to take over all Intel needs and I feel that they were not also ready to help Intel momentarily and allow them to come back. Intel execution will improve under Pat there is no question about it but the competition is not the same and is executing like a Swiss clock.Intel is a value play but investors will have to get the confidence that things are on track to be able to push the stock much further. I found a bit strange that Pat committed already to the 7Nm roadmap. He could have taken his time and the market would have allowed him to do so.

Changing CEO doesn't change the fact the company is losing to TSM
Better sell now before it drops to $20.
INTC 10nm in volume production. Yes ( that is equivalent to 8.6nm)
Wait until 5G system starts... more data and CPU power will be needed..
Investors are looking past this ER plain and simple. We know things are not stellar but we also know the potential that INTC has when it gets tapped.
"did anyone see any postive revision on earning estimate by any analyst? or do anyone have access IDC reports and let us know if Intel gained back market share? i want to correlate this opposite trend among market, intc and amd"

Do they begin to replace their chips and infrastructure or just shrug their shoulders and carry on as if everything is OK?Is there a class action lawsuit here against Intel if there is no fix?https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenkam/2019/03/05/new-intel-cpu-vulnerability-bodes-well-for-amd/#447873a57961
NVDA/amd = Wildly OvervaluedINTC = Very Strong Buy IMO
"To some, Swan comes off as someone who is lost in space. Someone who is out of touch with the reality of Intel's current situation. Could be! Or maybe he is someone who knows more about his space than what he is willing to tell others. Something about his presentations that give me the impression that he knows something we don't know and is not able or willing to share at this time. Just one of my many useless mussing on this New Years Eve. Have a great one my fellow Intel-ers. Peace, Love and Pray for a better 2021!"

Sixty nixty! Aww AMD taking away more market share!
From Intel and Morgan Stanley fireside chat:* 10nm Ice Lake SP to ramp Q1 2020! *Only 6 months behind AMD 7nm ROME. Not one year or two years as most people expected.
Yowzah Yowzah INTC !
Geez - this is going up for what reason? Any new fake product announced?
"This is down because they don’t want to outsource a foreign company to make their chips ? What nonsense. The reason America is losing intellectual property and methodology is because of outsourcing. Anything can be leaked, reversed engineered and copied once tell them how to."
$55 closing
"Yes, John, Intel is great. So far it’s minus 3.38% more great than yesterday."
"Today we will see green territory...mark my words.Intel ist a 80 usd Stock Minimum, ridicolous valuation.Pensions funds have bought and activist investors as well.We are ahead of a big rise."
"The news today was welcomed by many. The gap up is nice but will probably be filled sooner than later. RSI shows Intel as being over bought. DMI looks great. While strangely the Chaikin Money Flow shows money flowing out of the stock since December. (Daily Charts). So far, price is holding up well above $57.00"
"Get used to it, one trick turd amd will always play 2nd fiddle to the INTC juggernaut."
After announcing earnings after close todayeven if it goes down....I'm not selling!!!
"INTC moving up AH, something brewing IMO."
"Intel P1276Intel's 7-nanometer process, P1276, will enter risk production at the end of 2020 and ramp in 2021. On February 8 2017 Intel announced a $7B investment in Arizona's Fab 42 which will eventually produce chips on a 7 nm process.Intel has not disclosed the details of the process but the company's current CEO claims it will feature a density that is 2x that of Intel's 10-nanometer node. Intel's prior CEO, Brian Krzanich, mentioned that 7-nanometer will have ""2.4x the compaction ratio"" of 10 nm. This puts the 7-nanometer node at around 202-250 million transistors per square millimetre."
The chart says it all! Don't listen to the noise. great long term hold.
"Let me share some FACTS:Their long time CEO sold all his shares and when asked why? answered ""for personal reasons"" Right before all the security problems and even more delays in 10nm. And left the company a few months later. Out of $AMD, $NVDA, $INTC, only Intel has claimed China as the problem for lower revenue."
"So many AMD investors bashing. A quick reminder, AMD is not in the same league. INTC R&D is larger than entire AMD."

"Best news on INTC in ages. Swan was a disaster, BK sucked, Otellini was a bean-counter, and Barrett was a good guy but had zero vision. Last good CEO was Andy. I've been begging for Gelsinger to be the CEO for years, he's got the vision and the cred with the engineering staff to take INTC back to glory days. Trivia - Pat was a tech in my group when I joined in '81. He used Intel's generous education support to get his BSEE and the rest is history. I cannot wait for this to happen."

Fact: AMD Cpu > Intel CpuFor the next 2 years minimum.
"We got an absolute proof that AMD Q1 will BEAT and Q2 and the year will be REVISED UP from Micron's ER yesterday! But we can defuct more!1. Smartphones down - MORE 7nm capacity for AMD -> earlier products including 5nm used by smartphones already -> higher revenues 2. Higher video memory revenues than expected -> not $nvda benefits, it's AMD based on Mindfactory showing 5700x taking market share from nVidia! 3. Higher laptop and datacenters memory revenues -> that's higher orders for AMD NEW 7nm mobile APUs that were raised as tetsilers increase AMD based laptops orders selling out of old AMD models -> higher revenues recorded already in Q1 higher Q2 and yearly than anticipated. 4. Higher datacenters memory revenues -> higher AMD Rome revenues NOT $intc that HAS WARNED ALREADY OF LOWER FINANCIALS this year telling investors of risk and stopping buybacks! The net is huge pps jump next month after amd's ER and LOSES for Intel's. nVidia's ER a month later in May will make it very clear AMD's GPUs selling in datacenters - see news on Amazon EPYC Rome with MI25 GPUs launching - and laptops usung mobile AMD GPUs not nVidia's, to use PowerShift! Don't be fooled!"
I love it how short are screaming right now. Music to my ears. This really is the beginning of a new year 
Intel is gonna pull the rug on you soon. It's only up because it's riding the dow wave. Take your profits and run. Intel is a mess.
Second wave to 64... finish 65.20
did you guys see the market cap of nvidia ? it was almost double intel's market cap. now it's almost the same
"10nm will be mass production in 2019. That is good news. if 14nm is already very good for INTC, next year will be even brighter...5G and more high band width applications.. Nice."

"If it drops more on Monday I am loading big. Intel consistently makes 1/2 of what apple does, but is priced at just 1/10. This is incredible opportunity. Once the tide turns, and it always does, this is easy 100-200 stock."
"Once they announce new production plan and roadmap. It will pop. We will see new price target, short squeeze and right valuation for this company. So hold and stay patient. Good luck for all longs."
Many analysts are useless. Today 6 analysts on INTC were from buy to Sell and from $ 40.00- $ 70.00 . Go figure!
"Easy double from here. Only Intel has the scale to design & produce chips across all user markets. Selling at a ridiculously low relative PE, as if they were on the brink of bankruptcy."
"The only thing that Wall St will like is probably Intel opening up its manufacturing to other companies.Intel foundry was a good idea, but they couldn't get it done."

Fact: Every long that purchased Intel in the last 4 months is a bagholder.
"Mobileye CTO has an hour presentation Tuesday at CES 2019.""The first silicon of the 7nm EyeQ5H SoC is set to be produced in August 2018, with series production from March 2020 and four OEMs launching with it from 2020 onwards.""https://www.zdnet.com/article/ces-2018-mobileye-claims-autonomous-driving-solution-more-efficient-than-nvidia/"
"Here's what $intc CFO stated on datacenters sales in Q4 and expected in 2020:""Chief Financial Officer George Davis said in an interview that sales to cloud computing providers were up 48% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, a trend expected to continue this year.""So 50% growth they say in datacenters. Except that AMD stated a modest 10% market share by Q2 this year. However this will obviously be more leading to triple beats.Intel also saying there is ""progress better than expected"" in 10nm fab. We've heard about this ""progress"" since 2015 every year. Butnotice nothing about commitment the large scale production to start in say Q2 or so. Just smoke and mirrors ""progress"" so let's look at this in 2021 shall we?Read the rest. AMD is the real thing coming next week. Intel has a mix of other chips such as storage i.e. SSD Optane now a combined sub unit in Intel's recent reorganization to hide the net fall in CPUs sales. Storage is doing well and Intel is selling that as is Micron, Samsung, WD etc. But the highest margins are the CPUs not commodity storage chips. As you've noted, Intel's gross margins dropped significantly because in their mix the CPUs revenues are down even as lower margins storage revenues were up. Same with 2020. So the net is overall growth is flat with lower margins. Horrible guidance! I'm very sure $intc will dive even if it takes a few days to see way higher revenues and margins outlook from amd's ER next week. Even as amd has consoles chips at lower margins than datacenters chips, everything is up including margins for consoles plus bigger market share in datacenters. Let's see... watch the VOLUME for both Intel and AMD.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-intel-results/intel-signals-2020-will-be-a-turnaround-year-for-chip-industry-leader-idUSKBN1ZM30P"

"Important after IBM's ER today, AMD jumping as IBM will announce historic partnership with AMD for cloud and using EPYC-Powered datacenter and AMD's GPUs for Azi. This dumps $nvda and $intc.

Cannot stay with Intel and nVidia as I've explained. Power processors gain too from AMD's new GPUs. Remember hedge your portfolio.

I'm not here to bash INTC but time is changing and companies like Intel are run by people who should not be in charge."

Just some insight from the gaming industry. All competitive and fps gamers are buying the Intel 10900k for raw fps. That's a 14nm thermal optimized cpu that gets about 20-40fps higher than any CPU on the market at 1080p. That is the gaming sqeet spot since 240hz monitors are used everywhere in esports and 360hz monitors are just being released over the next few years. Even games make better use of multiple cores seem to benefit from the IPC of the 10900k. 5.3oc! P.s. I really hope that AMD releases an IPC neck n neck competitor asap even at a higher cost and gross margin so that consumers win from the competition
AMD admitted they cant meet demand for at least 1H 2021. This benefits Intel in so many ways. INTC ridiculously undervalued here at single forward PE.

"more volitility= investors leaving, compared to other similar stocks"
"Currently, in terms of speed, Bob Swan may have something up his sleeve.He may have been able to pack a huge amount of memory close to the cores using the chip packaging technology that he likes to boast about. If that's the case the news will certainly help the stock in the short term. That coupled with good sales numbers that accompany the demand for anything silicone and the shortage for anything silicone. Intel has a key advantage of having built up capacity.Building up capacity in advanced nodes is not as easy as committing several billion for fabs. There is a shortage of machines needed in the fabs. Intel has partial ownership of machine makers for the fabs.So looking past the ""Who is fastest, cheaply?"", I think the more important question is ""Who showed up at the party?"".Will you commit your IT department to a chip that you can not be sure that you can buy?Intel still has the last card to play here."
"Not sure if Intel basic issue will be solved by management change. It can not be compared to AMD due to scale of the two companies. Intel issue is basic: It's a giant and it's business is being snatched from many angles by a very competent undertakers such as Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, nVidia, Qualcomm and AMD. Apple and AMD effect are already started showing. CPU/ business can not be centralized. Every big company will be pushed to do their own CPU their own way. That means Intel business shrink in inevitable. Once in downward spiral, it is hard to turn it around for a giant until it hits the ground. Bounce back can take decade if not decades.

While I think Intel is a great company I do not believe they will return to growth in the near future. For the many steps forward they have made they just cannot seem to stay ahead of their nimble competition. It was a perfect storm for the chip industry this past year and Intel was pretty much stagnant. It appears the market share losses they have suffered cannot be regained until at least 2023 and that is only if their competition stumbles. If the PC and data center business starts to weaken I believe Intel will suffer the most. The only question that remains is valuation.

I will buy in dip and sell but will never be long in AMD."
"$intc last ER and CC shows the old timer ""new"" CEO takes care of his buddies working on the fabs so he won't write the fabs off but keep sinking billions to try save them. Hope for leadership won't happen in 2023 with 7nm fabs even if they make it work, they will be so behind Samsung and TSMC even Global Foundries that it makes no sense. At best 10 years to catch up and inferior products until then. The architecture of the chips is yet another problem on top of the fabs.So the new Intel's CEO is trying old ideas that he remembered from his far long ago Intel's past. His recent job, at VMWare has nothing to do with chips, he's not up to date and thus cannot lead properly. Look at IBM's 10+ years ""transformation"" promises. Look at HP before the HPQ split. Intel is heading to the same destiny. Dead money sinking."

"""Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Stock Is Back in a Big Way"" And this is not counting EPYC server !!!SmarterAnalyst Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has consistently gained CPU share since the launch of Ryzen series CPUs, and indications from various sell-side checks suggests that AMD has gained market share versus Intel in laptops, and Chromebooks. However, GPU revenue might take a while to recover until the full roll-out of Vega series GPUs with Turing capable features like Ray-tracing, and AI similar to the RTX line-up for Nvidia series cards. Despite the choppy indications when pertaining to financial results, AMD is recovering from a really low base of revenues when compared to peers, and with a steady slate of products anticipated to launch in the next two-quarters, the sentiment tied to the stock could still improve from here.Despite the mixed-implications for market share gains for AMD in Q1’19, there were a number of notable positives from a report released by Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland: ""AMD takes share in notebooks and Chromebooks as Intel shortages likely accelerate share gains. AMD laptop share was up +3.9% quarter-on-quarter to 11.7% in Q1’19! In Chromebooks, AMD goes from almost zero market share to 8% as we believe Intel fails to supply the low-end of the market. AMD desktop share remains flat in the quarter at 15% as we wait for 7nm in 2H19. Positive AMD, negative INTC. GPU attach rate in desktops now 33% as gaming desktops increased in Q1’19. The Q1’19 GPU desktop attach rate was 33%, up +4% quarter-on-quarter, as gaming desktops increased during the quarter. Gaming desktops now make up 25% of PCs in our study (up from 20% in Q4’18). Nvidia benefited modestly from share gains in these gaming desktops (now has 76% share). Positives for NVDA and AMD.""It seems like AMD is gaining the bulk of its CPU share in the notebook market, whereas desktop comparisons for market share remained flat between AMD and Intel. AMD’s positioning in graphics have improved modestly, as there were more gaming PCs purchased in Q1’19 than in the prior quarter..."

The upshot of this is that in the event of a trade war where USA bans x86CPU’s from export to China, China will say no problem and use their own....and AMD gets the entire market. Actually, I think that’ll happen with or without a trade war.Just FYI. For the full story and details, see Toms Hardware article."

"If we consider Intel’s sequential revenue trend, we can see that its third and fourth quarters are seasonally strong. This could be the first time in more than three years that Intel reports a sequential decline in the fourth quarter—simply because it didn’t have sufficient capacity to meet demand.The company’s 1%—or $190 million—sequential revenue fall is expected to come from a 15% sequential decline in its IoTG (Internet of Things Group) revenue, as it has prioritized data center and PC chips over IoTG chips.

Face the facts people AMD is taking away market share from intel and will show more and more now and into the second half
Fake premarket red wil close green... just look at the specs of new high clock frequency EPYC Rome. .. the 16 cores 256MBytes cache is outstanding beast for single thread performance. It shows the tip of the possibilities AMD's products can address leading $intc and $nvda by an impossible to close gap. Two weeks for the ER! The best is yet to come remember Lisa Su's promise!
Listen to the analyst in CNBCthey suggest if you see it in the mid 50s BUYBetter be in AMDthat is what they said.
"INTC has the cash and the crazy low interest rates to add and build a better manufacturing operation right here in the US. Samsung and TSM want to build facilities in Arizona. The US Gov is all about security. My guess is that will favor INTC and even if competitors ramp up manufacturing, it will give INTC more options. INTC will be a leader in chips again. The rub is how long will take to get it right? Stick and stay and make it pay."
2021 INTC server will grow double digits.Raise price target to 180
$MU $AMAT $INTC MU's Analyst Day is on Monday. No company will gather the analysts to report a bad news. MU will soar with bullish outlook.
Intc is way under valued. Great company without ceo now. It will be a fantastic company with a great new ceo in January. See you @ the 60’s.

I sold all of my intc and got into AMD. It was a good choice.....
Will never see $60 again
I wish Yahoo would denut the lousy spambot that infests the boards ASAPGo INTC !
I bet sellers will regret selling this billion dollars company's share not after this year but right after the january ends...it will be at 55 $ IA...Bright future...consider it as a dip 
Intel will soon surprise with good news and this thing will go up like a rocket  to $65 - $75.

"Intel announcement is imminent. It will be partnering with Samsung, as well as TSMC. Further exacerbating supply constraints across the industry. This is why you have AMD and Nvidia breaking sales records, yet 10% or more, off of all-time highs. The smart money is getting out of Dodge. The supply issue is just going to get worse as Enterprise spending is picking up in the first half. Either you will have your own fab, or you will stand in line just like everybody else."

"Intel is losing market share to AMD. That’s a fact now. It means sell some intel stock and buy AMD stock. AMD has built a better product with more cores, cheaper and more scalable. Intel stock won’t go higher but AMD stock will. The idea is to make money. Look at AMD stock move up again today on more but upgrades. Sell intel buy AMD."

Get ready to see the comments swarmed by angry shorts
$nvda has been just downgraded because of the Corona virus the analyst views as high for them. While at the same time he is impressed with AMD. Also he had negative sentiment on $intc ! It looks like AMD pps is so low now from over $59+ that a bigger upgrade is due while nVidia and Intel are way too expensive. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nvidias-coronavirus-risk-prompts-downgrade-at-instinet-2020-02-25?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo

"Think about it.What happened the last time Intel had to fight to hold onto market share? Oh yeah, AMD was flying high but then the price war came. AMD posted massive net losses and almost died. The AMD stock went under 2."
So now INTC is lumped in with over-priced dot coms? Buy all dips below $70.
Why did INTC drop like that?
"This company has been, RED for two straight weeks, and THERE is no GREEN, insight !￼"
Mantra never to be forgotten.. Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets.
"Article about Gelsinger’s early hiring of Sunil Shenoy:“Shenoy was an executive at SiFive, a startup that’s trying to commercialize chip designs based on a technology called RISC-V, a rival to Intel’s X86 and Arm Ltd.’s dominant instruction sets.”Uhhhhhh the nerd sweats are coming on."

will intel stop at nothing to try to lump amd in with the gravity of its chip flaws... the truth is that AMD is significantly safer than intel! meltdown is more significant and harder to fix than spectre and intel also has spectre not just meltdown... misguided articles everywhere trying to lump in amd with meltdown... a lawsuit about them not saying they were impacted by both variants of spectre when nothing they have said to date claimed they were not. the original statement was that they were impacted by spectre and not meltdown... that is still true. the second report them came out to provide more info on spectre and that is where the claim came from but its not true because they alwasy said spectre impacted them in full.intel is pulling their strings to kobosh the obvious increased quality and security of AMD chips. they really should get all the business now because they obviously pay more attention to what is important to consumers especially in servers.
Go INTEL GO!
"Credit where credit is due. I do not agree with Deepinstinct and I think we all know that. However, he did promise that if Intel did not warn, then he would come on this board and publicly apologize. Yesterday, Intel did not give a warning in it's guidance about revenue, in fact it increased forecast. Deepinstinct, even though we disagree, I have to say, is at least man enough to come on and do what he promised, so for that, I take my hat off to you"

Just think if INTC didn’t replace their CEO and they announced no significant changes to their manufacturing strategies.. Im sure it would have been a bloodbath for sure. Intc knew this was going to happen so they preannounced the CEO change prior to earnings call to test the water sort of speak. Smart call on their part.

As more and more Spectre varians (cannot be patched by software) come up, older chips will become slower and slower, and because INTL won't have new chips until 2021, nobody will buy their datacenter CPU's. No datacenter owner will want to be left behind on performance/cost etc. RIP $INTC. You tried so hard."

"There was an interesting comment on the GOOG earnings call.

My intuition tells me today is the day that Amd stock gains outpace Intel’s at least 8 out of 10 days and will eclipse intel’s stock price by fall of this year at about 45... I was wrong predicting April 6 months ago because I thought epyc would launch around January 1st. The date has moved forward and so shall the price eclipse... $intc
"So the demand was so high and INTC was in supply constraints, AMD, (the little tiny little) got to sell its chip near costs ( why is AMD margin so low?) to beg people to buy..THAT IS NOT GAINING SHARE, OK?INTCs sale on all business unit are up and up a lot."

"$nvda as is $intc , has shown clear evidence that AMD had a significant impact on their yearly earnings and revenues. nVidia's FY2020 had a 7% revenues decline vs FY19 even though FY19 had the crypto bubble reducing revenues. But more importantly was the EPS declining way more at amazing 32% lower EPS GAAP in FY20 vs FY19. Non GAAP was still down 13%.Why earnings were lower much more than revenues? This shows a fundamental problem with nVidia going forward! In 4Q of FY19, nVidia refused to provide the whole year ouylook for FY20. They didn't provide such outlook for the FY21 yesterday. It's in declining revenues AND EPS which is more alarming.In contrast you would think high price high margins datacenters GPUs showed an increase so the percentage of drop in EPS shouldn't be way bigger than the revenues drop. But this is EXACTLY what AMD forced nVidia to do. Cut prices accross the board not just midrange gaming GPUs we've seen but the datacenter crown jewels! This is BEFORE AMD is launching new high end nVidia's killer gaming GPUs and new Arcturus datacenter GPUs. Also before the INTEGRATED GPU CPU design with Zen3 EPYC Millan that will take control over the datacenter GPUs leveraging EPYC 7nm+ Zen3 Millan leadership over Intel to pull the GPUs into such.So i see VERY BAD outlook for nVidia in sharp contrast with AMD's outlook for the year. nVidia's spinning of even lower revenues for their current quarter guidance blaming on the Corona virus is a hint of what's coming this year. Intel in contrast at least mentioned competition pressure for their ER. Not mentioning AMD but it's obvious. nVidia's lowering analysts expectations to then ""beat"" while overall they decline revenues and earnings is criminal I think.Remember last year nVidia has issued a warning lowering their previous guidance for the quarter ? Then analysts lowered their expectations to end with a ""beat"". This is how Jensen operates. But yearly revenues and earnings cannot lie. It's down and will be further down this year not just the first quarter especially as amd's new products are launching. I suggest you consider selling nVidia and buying AMD. Numbers don't lie. It's worse than Intel's outlook that was flat for the year. It's declining this year as last. Remember this post don't be fooled by herd manipulation ponzy schemes."

"Does anyone else get the impression that Intel’s CEO’s are not taking this seriously? That’s the problem with people who don’t really need to work for a living. It’s all a game to them. It doesn’t matter if they win or lose because they have a safety net to protect them if things go wrong. Win or lose, they win! Then they move on to the next game. Rich people are not hungry for success. They already have it. How about we get a CEO in there and tell them you have one year to make the company grow by 10 % or you are fired. And until that happens, you will work for minimum wage with no golden parachute. There are consequences for our actions when we fail to do our jobs, but not the same consequences for people who are already rich and only work for power or prestige. CEOs need to be held accountable for their performance, just like the rest of us. They either need to step up or step out."

"“Intel Spoiler Chip Vulnerability: The Facts”Intel Spoiler vulnerability facts, including who discovered the flaw, what it means and how Intel is responding.by DH Kass • Mar 7, 2019Spoiler Vulnerability: Is There A Software Patch or Fix?Right now, no mitigation exists. Because it’s not a Spectre attack, none of Intel’s mitigations work on it. And, there may not be a software fix, Moghimi told the Register. “My personal opinion is that when it comes to the memory subsystem, it’s very hard to make any changes and it’s not something you can patch easily with a microcode without losing tremendous performance,” he said. “So I don’t think we will see a patch for this type of attack in the next five years and that could be a reason why they haven’t issued a [common vulnerabilities and exposures].”Intel’s response:“Intel received notice of this research, and we expect that software can be protected against such issues by employing side channel safe development practices. This includes avoiding control flows that are dependent on the data of interest. We likewise expect that DRAM modules mitigated against Rowhammer style attacks remain protected. Protecting our customers and their data continues to be a critical priority for us and we appreciate the efforts of the security community for their ongoing research.”"

"What a steal for $56, intc and I ibm crashed dow on Friday! Intc will paint the dow green today!"
Yes.100 is more than possible. It is likely. I in fact look forward to 120 and then a split in two years or less.The growth Intel now has will support a much higher PE.
Its not the CEO or anything that Intel says or does. This stock is doomed because.....Wall St hates INTC and will take it down everychance it gets. Repeat this 5 times daily.

"Let's refresh: AMD is running on 0.15 ""positive"" EPS and rumors of 7 nm. Since 7 nm could easily fail, they've jacked up the prices on pre-existing products. Meanwhile, Intel revenue for Q2 was $17B and its handing out dividends."

"The ""sell the fabs"" people does not have a good vision about where the semiconductor industry is heading. Intel should rather double down on their fabs and revamp the custom foundry. There was an interesting article recently that proposed Intel acquires Global Foundries to boost its capacity and make way into the foundry business. Intel has that kind of money, and regulators should not have problem with that because EVRYONE wants chip manufacturing capability in the US rather than depending heavily on Taiwan/Asia."

"If RTX was a success, we wouldn't have a 1660 GPU. This means that we will see an Ampere sooner because Nvidia needs to correct their misstep asap. Nvidia's growth story basically was purchased for $7B. But is it really growth? In-house interconnect doesn't really benefit all that much compared to commodity. Mellanox was smart with timing their exit strategy benefitting all their shareholders. Microsoft would have benefitted far more. Nvidia got punked. There's still a silver lining but this acquisition is no different than Dell acquiring Force10 to interconnect their servers but still it.makes sense for Dell although it didn't really add much compared to the overhead involved because Force10 became commodity fast. Same with Extreme Networks, Cisco catalyst, brocade, Nortel etc. Arista has been holding on but not for long. Nvidia really needed a CPU design team, not a networking switching company. Imo this puts $AMD and $INTC in a more favorable position over next 2 years. Paying $7B for a tech that will be generic 'made in china' in less than two years is a gamble. But Nvidia had no choice, there was no other option for this one-trick pony. Laptops do not need 4K. 1440p will become an APU affair in a few months. 4K gaming and VR is AMD territory with Navi and consoles. Intel's GPU is also joining the opencompute anti-cuda forces. Nvidia's architecture is not suitable for 7nm just yet for high-end. AI, ML, DL is the only avenue for growth and a Mellanox won't exactly cut the mustard. The future is grim but let's see."
Who leaked the Q4?
"Gelsinger pulled in his horns about outsourcing after TSMC said no, we do not fab for our competitors. Gelsinger now pounds his chest and says ""We can do it!"" After five years intel still cannot compete. Most intel chips are 14nm. Most AMD chips are 7nm. Intel is using a decade old manufacture."

Swan obviously did not help INTC grow and improve. The last several years have been a struggle just to maintain. Intel need someone with a vision. Hopefully this move will help.
NVDA $479.05 vs Intel with inferior products or Undervalued AMD?
Intel is in bad shape. Not even going to be a chipmaker anymore. 2020 revenue mostly driven by the WFH demand for consumer laptops and PCs due to the pandemic. Not seeing anything to justify a 30% run-up over the past month.

"For all the people on this board that are monofocused on AMD vs NVIDIA vs Intel and transistor size in chips, realize that this industry is much, much broader than that. Intel's current market is far broader than AMD's or NVIDIA's. Their R&D addresses a swath of technologies related to modern computer and communication infrastructure: AI, Internet of things, self driving cars, servers, cloud, networks, GPU, CPU, Memory and Storage, 5G, integrated photonics, non-silicon transistors, Quantum computing... No other semi company has such a diverse collection of expertise other than perhaps Samsung. TSMC and their clients: AMD, NVIDIA, Apple, Huawei...and others are doing great, but the rapidly growing chip/network market has more than enough room for multiple players to grow as we saw this year. Everyone grew in 2020. But speaking more specifically of the chip market, Intel is in a unique position that rivals who outsourced are not. Namely: control over their supply. As one of only 3 companies in the world with their own cutting edge fab technology (TSMC, Samsung, and Intel)...this is where the real competition is. And Intel is the only remaining Western company that has their own cutting edge semi research and fabs and produces chips in house. This gives them a unique cost and supply advantage. For one, the US government will likely preferentially invest in and buy from them for supply security reasons. So may other governments that want to have redundancy of supply. The market needs more than one player for innovation to thrive. The fact that rivals outsource gives them access to TSMCs semi technology, but dramatically lowers their margins and makes them dependent on TSMC succeeding to continue to stay ahead. Demand for TSMC fab space is so high that they are already raising how much they charge by about 20% after accepting Apple as a new customer, raising the costs for producers that outsource fab technology. TSMC is currently trying to ramp up new fab space to meet the demand, but that takes time and meanwhile the world is in a CPU shortage, something that will benefit Intel who has invested to double their fab capacity since 2017 and whose chips are more than adequate and affordable for most clients. This is why Intel keeps selling their chips as quickly as they can make them. You don't need to be the world leader to have good sales, what you need is to be able to produce large amounts of chips that offer competitive performance at affordable prices, and here Intel really has the cost advantage. What other US rival can afford to offer the pricing Intel does on the low end for PC and Notebook if there is a cost war? Certainly not NVIDIA or AMD who outsource fab research and pay for it per chip. What matters for overall profitability is not that you have the most advanced microstructure, but that you can produce a lot of something that works well at an affordable price. Yield matters. It doesn't matter if you have an advanced chip if you can't produce enough of it at a price that will meet demand. Intel's current advantage isn't that they lead in process node, but that they have independent supply and a lower cost basis than other US rivals. On the high-end technical side of transistor density and latest gen chip architecture: Intel clearly stated in their cc that they are committed to keeping up their own semi R&D and trying to reclaim leadership. It is very common in this industry for a roadmap to be delayed or a new node to be flawed with low yields. It has happened in the past to all the major players at various times: TSMC, Samsung, and Intel have all experienced it and been leaders at various times. It happened to Intel most recently, but it will likely happen again for the other major players as well. How do you think that will affect Intel's rivals who all try to use TSMC if they have a delay, a yield issue, or supply problems as they have had in the past? Even if TSMC stays in the lead, the fact that everyone wants to partner with them will raise costs, meaning Intel will have uniquely profitable margins on the chips they do sell. Also keep in mind that node improvements from a transistor size standpoint are stagnating as we approach atomic limits. Most of the improvement isn't coming from increases in transistor density, but through parallelization (increasing corecount), AI optimizations, and clever structure/material breakthroughs that lower the mounting resistance issues as junctions get tinier. This is why Intel's chips have been able to stay competitive and why customers are still placing massive orders year after year...Intel excels on optimizing 3D chip architecture. Also, keep in mind that the the process names (10,7,5,3nm) are marketing. It is roughly tied to the thinnest dimension of the fundamental transistor, but better metrics that customers look at is transistor density in the wafer and power requirements. Intel is not far behind at all in transistor density."

"Under the new CEO, INTC is starting a brand new chapter. Intel will regain its leadership in process (fab) technology in 3 years. In the short term, however, it will be wise for Intel to outsource the manufacturing of new chips to TSMC to launch a powerful offense against AMD and Nvidia. If things move quickly, by the end of 2021, Intel may regain its market share in desktop CPU, grab market share in discrete GPU from AMD and Nvidia, and ramp up the revenue from Autonomous Driving, IoT, and AI SoCs. There are very few companies who have Intel's technology depth. INTC should be worth 10 times of NVDA market cap. INTC is seriously undervalued now. I would not be surprised if INTC rises over $100 by the end of 2021. Hold you INTC shares tight for the next 5~10 years for a fantastic ride."

"Once we have Alderlake, it will become apparent that the M series of chips from Apple, will be nothing more than Apple's strongARM tactic to get better terms from Intel.Apple has reserved capacity at TSMC, but I think that capacity will be best usedup on iPhones and iPads.TSMC has made commitments to Apple in the past when things were slower. Can Apple push TSMC to forgo billions in profits, and divert so many resources to Apple's as yet unproven ""M"" push into Intel's territory?I don't think Apple is a high-margin customer for TSMC. Apple is known for squeezing suppliers. Intel dropped Apple's modem business exactly for this reason.I am sure TSMC will honor commitments made in the past to Apple. But given the expensive and risky capacity Capex at TSMC, I just don't think they would be willing to make new commitments to a such a hard bargain customer. Commitments that Apple so desperately needs to have before making a push into ""M"" series of processors."
"If Geslinger is as beloved and legendary within Intel as he is being made out to be, Intel should pay WHATEVER IT TAKES to reverse the brain-drain and 'get the band back together'.

"Intel is facing a lot of headwinds. The great news for Intel is that Microsoft and Apple make up less than 5% of Intel’s $80 billion per year revenue which has grown the last few years. Does it hurt, sure it hurts. But from a profitability stand point, the deal that Apple and Microsoft have with Intel will be quickly replaced with higher margin customers. Demand in this space is tremendous now and over the next 10 years.Over the last 2-3 years Intel had increased its fab capacity by 100% and they are running at full capacity and then some.Intel’s investment in Cloud, AI, and autonomous driving will keep Intel growing revenue and profits.Intel’s 2020 revenue is expected to be close to $80 Billion with a “B”!!!! Net profit of almost $18-$19 Billion!To put that in perspective, If you add up AMD’s, Nvidia’s, and Amazon’s net Profit for the year, you get close to Intel’s! Think about that for a moment.Facts are, you can’t deposit market sentiment in the bank, you can only deposit $$!In the next 3-5 years, I think investors that bought at these levels will be very happy with their investment.

"I sold. It isn't as if I didn't make a tidy profit, but gees - I expected more from intc management. This ""flaw"" wasn't just discovered, they've known for a while, now. If their management were deserving of their incredible salaries, they'd of announced it and explained both the problem and their plan to address it when they FIRST became aware. Maybe they want to buy back and see this as an opportunity. Who knows? It doesn't speak well of management, no matter how you slice it."

Intel chips are stale 14nm leftovers.
"Interesting war of words between INTC and AMD in their respective press releases on new chips. Clearly both have made improvements, so it will be interesting to see how the manufacturers and consumers respond - i.e., who is the real deal."
Just thinking Analysts do not understand these new technologies if the did the target would move higher
Down slightly on huge volume AH (3.5 mil) while AMD and NVDA up. Wonder why?
"I think Dan Loeb has already paid colossal amounts of money to smart and in the know people, to answer this question:What kind of pricing will Intel get on 3nm and how fat will the margins be after TSMC, Foveros combination at Intel?Or maybe not... he may have simply looked at Bob Swan's aggressive insider buying."

Why last Friday Intel dropped but Amd soar?
"Besides becoming wealthier, best part of the upgrade from Morgan Stanley this morning is that they are one of the more bearish of the Wall Street firms on the current rally. Mike Wilson, their Chief U.S. Equity Strategist is pretty good and is still cautious on the rally. The third best thing about the upgrade and rally will be it may shut the AMD fanboys up for a few seconds."
"AMD, NVDA, AVGO, ON and other chip stocks all up in pre market except, except....Intc. The scam is over."
Is anyone else surprised Intel has a beta under 1.00? Means it’s less volatile than the broader market. I’d think a major chip maker in tech sector would be over 1.Kraft is supposed to be more defensive (and less volatile) but it’s over 1.Strange...

"***Some observations:***1. I think we are likely to see a big bounce tomorrow because intel just lowered its long term forecasts at an investor meeting today..2. A big market drop may blunt some of the gains hopefully not3. The size of intel and its Dow index position may be part of the cause for futures 4. This is excellent news for AMD investors5. Did you notice all the articles trying to coerce investors to buy intel stock in the last few days I told you this was a very crooked business..6. you also saw a lot of strength today in AMD..7. Even if intel sinking and market tanking in sympathy hurts AMD’s gains, astute investors should buy and hold all they can now intel basically rolled over and admitted AMD is eating their lunch while AMD is only 1/7th it’s size in terms of market cap or about 14%. When AMD is 25% of Intels size in several months the stock price will be About 50..8.

"I'm long here, Intel is a great company with strong fundamentals and nice products. I'm sure will rise in the next months."
Intel is loosening business to AMD. numbers don't lie.
"Put your pride away and follow the dream. Think of it this way. Instead of shorting INTC all the way down to $40, just invest in AMD for the next two years and make money. When intel hits $40, sell AND and ride Intel's next ride back up to $60. Of course by them AND will be over $100. Seems simple to me."
All the smart money is leaving AMD (overvalued) and coming back to Intel and Nvidia.
Bought 44.5 calls today am. Looking good now.
TIME TO BREAK UP THIS MEGATRON and also send the CEO off to charm school. Boolean
Raise the price target to $200. now.. it is confirmed.. INTC should be traded at the same PE of MSFT
ALL CHIP STOCKS GOING UP AFTERHOURS EXCEPT INTC.....WOW

"Netlist (NLST) is ""largely overlooked"" Who’s/What’s Netlist?Netlist holds several patents in server, storage, and hybrid memory, as well as rank multiplication and load reduction.What’s goin on here (the main course anyways)?Netlist has been in litigation with Googs since 2009 over allegations that Googs infringed upon Netlist’s seminal 912 hardware patent. Netlist alleges that Googs infringed the patent by building servers using the 912 patent technology. Netlist sued Googs on December 2009 in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The judge in the case ordered a random cross section of servers to be examined which showed that Googs indeed was using technology described in the 912 patent. Googs then asserted that the patent was invalid. In 2010 Googs requested an Inter Partes Reexamination of the 912 patent by the USPTO’s (United States Patent and Trademark Office) PTAB (Patent Trial and Appeal Board). While the reexamination was going on the Northern District Court granted a joint request made by both companies to stay the 912 patent infringement lawsuit until the USPTO made its findings. On January 2019 the PTAB upheld the validity of Netlist’s 912 patent. In April 2019 Googs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In June 2020 the US Court of Appeals upheld the PTAB’s decision on the validity of the 912 patent. Because of the Covid-19 pandemic Googs was granted a 6 month extension to decide if it wanted to appeal this decision to the United States Supreme Court. Googs did not choose to appeal. On February 16, 2021 Netlist moved to lift the stay in the Northern District of California so the patent infringement lawsuit could continue. The Court granted the request and ordered that both Netlist and Googs shall appear for a telephone Case Management Conference on March 11, 2021.So, what’s the big deal?Netlist has a seminal patent. A seminal patent is defined as a patent that describes an invention so impactful that it creates or shifts the technology space. Netlist believes that the teachings of the 912 patent can be found in various DDR3 and DDR4 server DIMMs (Dual Inline Memory Module) as well as future products that will be produced under the DDR5 server DIMM standards currently being established by the industry. Furthermore, Netlist asserts that the 912 patent enabled Googs to build servers with high capacity and rapid memory that allowed servers to store an entire Oracle database in memory which allowed lightning fast search results. The 912 patent played a large part in Googs dominance in search engine capability. Right now, it is not a question whether Googs infringed the 912 patent. That has already been established. Now, Googs is at the stage where it can settle with Netlist or go to a jury trial to determine damages.What are the damages? Are they substantial?Damages will take into account both the product itself (internal factors) and the environment (external factors) in determining pricing. In this case Netlist will argue that the 912 patent established Googs dominance in regards to their search engine, which allowed monopolist profits that funded Goog’s entire ecosystem. While at the same time, Goog’s infringement of the patent prevented Netlist from establishing itself in the server memory marketplace. Netlist will most likely seek billions in damages. Also, the prospect of treble damages is in play as Netlist will allege willful infringement on Goog’s part. The most likely scenario is Googs will settle the case rather than risk going in front of a jury. A settlement would include a large lump sum plus licensing of the patent going forward.Anything else going on?Yeah you bet! Netlist also sued Inphi for infringement of the 912 patent in the US District Court for the Central District of California. That case was also stayed pending the Court of Appeals decision, and now that the 912 patent was upheld it is expected Netlist will resume court proceedings once it is finished with the Googs case.Also, on March 2020 Netlist filed a patent infringement lawsuit against SK Hynix in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas based on the infringement of Netlist’s 218, 523, and 595 patents in SK Hynix’s RDIMM and LRDIMM server memory products. SK Hynix petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) to change the venue from Texas to California. This petition was denied and the case will be tried in Texas. The Markman hearing was set for March 4, 2021 with Jury trial set for July 6, 2021. The Western District of Texas is notorious for being very pro-patent holder friendly.$AMD $MU $QCOM"

But let's just say revenues guidance will be higher for the Q and the year with higher margins this year than expected. I save you the details I've addressed some in my previous posts for example comparing competition offerings. But this is the bottom line. Do your own due diligence and if you're not technology informed find someone who is and you trust to advise you. No other way. Longs of Intel and nVidia should be very careful about this as their shares could collapse this year. Especially nVidia's that lacking the ecosystem and tight integration with x86.

Dedicated hardware such as NVENC or QuickSync remains far more efficient than CPU cores for encoding. CPU based encoding is akin to using hair clippers on a lawn.

People are upset that INTC has taken a dive to levels not seen since last week.Outside the last eight days, INTC is higher than it's been since the great plunge of July last year.I'm starting to believe the way to treat INTC is to buy a couple days after quarterly ER, short it the day of ER, cover the short a day or two after ER, and go long again until the day before the next ER. Hold it through the dividend dates."
CNBC had some engineer guy give his thoughts. The guy said INTC need to clean house. The CEO he said is not technical. Has only a finance degree. The competitor CEO r technical. Example he said AMD. Other things he said too. He gave lots of insight. Very interesting. I heard on my XM radio. CNBC station. Driving.

"I have no ill feelings towards Swan. He helped Intel make a ton of money. It's not his fault investors were chasing other golden gooses like Tesla. His job was to make money for intel, and on that front, he did his job well. Unfortunately, on other fronts like PR, his efforts were poor. Intel was always profitable, a leader of the pack. He knew that but, wasn't effective in conveying that knowledge convincingly to others. Intel's price suffered as a result. Say what you will about Swan, but one thing we can all agree on was he knew how to make money for Intel, just not for intel’s investors."

what is wrong????
AMD has also claimed that the Ryzen 9 5900X is faster than the Core i9-10900K in gaming. This is pretty huge news for AMD fans who and for general PC enthusiasts. This now means that the top AMD CPUs beat the top Intel CPUs in both gaming and multi-core applications.

On Amazon, its still an Intel.I build systems, and looking at what you get and what you pay (including motherboard) its a no-brai ner, AMD is by far the better choice. Eventually, the non-computer people will also learn this. Just a matter of time. And time is NOT on Intel's side. They can only sandbag for so long before they collapse."

2021 Q1 and FY2021 estimates will blow analyst projections away. Ice Lake 2021 shipments look great & much better than expected. Shorts have a few days to cover. Stock will be $70+ by end of January.
Look back at the last 3yrs of INTC charts....notice one thing...it ALWAYS drops 8-10% after earnings announcement....so you know you HAVE to sell at the close before the announcement and then buy back a week later at the low.
"Why is that board members continually pit one compan(AMD) against the other(INTC)? Don't they realize this is NOT a zero sum gain and that both can and will survive and thrive!

"It’s like AMD is selling a top end Ferrari for the price of a basic Honda Civic.......and Intel are selling a basic Honda Civic (with better rims, lowered suspension and Xeon lights underneath) for the price of a Ferrari !"
No matter how bad it is in an hour and a half it is only going to get much much worse the rest of the year as people realise there is no fix for meltdown. Intel has exactly ZERO working chips to sell and doubtful they can get one out until 2019 at the earliest. What a disaster.
"I have two suggestions for Intel new product names, that closely reflex reality; For the broken 10nm should be called Kodak Lake and for antique 14nm should be called Fuji Lake. Free of charge, Marketing doesn't has to send me a check....."
And why did Amazon chose AMD chips ???
in one year this stock could easily get back to all time classic $20
You saw intel go red yesterday. That was the Real reaction. Then the big money decided to make  lemons into lemonade and buy it to make most investors think this terrible loss of revenues and earnings was a good thing...Let’s see where intel is in December 2019 it is 58.43 today April 16 as I write this..
Loeb trapped. Will have to cover his short. Up soon above $60. Mark this post.

"One year ago this week Mobileye said it shipped 17.4 million systems 2019, which means 17.4 million customers bought cars with Mobileye's cameras, chips, and software. That number is growing as Road Assist is gaining popularity in the auto industry. Maybe the way to look at INTC is you get Mobileye for the $50 per share price and the rest of INTC is a bonus. That makes INTC seem really undervalued."
All the AMD pumpers on this board convinced me to buy more Intel shares.
"In my opinion this is a fantastic buying opportunity. I use both intel and AMD, and while i think amd is great, intel is by far a more premium product. So even if i have to wait half a year for this to go back up, it 100% will go back up :)"
INTC's 10nm is already in production (a lot of cost saving). So hitting $100 (if not 120) is a matter of time.
Does INTEL have a CEO yet? Who is the new guy? I can’t seem to find anyone in charge.

Wow. Blowout numbers and forecast. We open at $80!
"Now coming to the market share results, in September, AMD’s market share at Mindfactory climbed close to 65% while Intel’s share fell to around 35%. This is a major change compared to previous months where both rivals were neck-to-neck in terms of CPU market share. Similarly, AMD CPU sales hit as high as 3000 units sold in a single week in the month of September while at one point, Intel’s weekly sales in the month of September fell below 1000 units. This was due to the price hikes which saw Intel CPUs sell at an average of 50% higher compared to their reference prices a month earlier."

"I have said this a few times. For every chip sales, INTC gets the profit from IP/engineering and manufacturing side. For fab-less chip companies, they have to share some margin with foundry such as TSMC.Not that INTC can't have TSMC make its chips (In fact, INTC has done some of that).Having your own manufacturing fab can work really well. Especially, there are fewer foundries around the globe. Economy of scale really becomes key."
"$intc failure seeing its PPS dropping Fri after the ER is the beginning. Analysts took a day to digest the colossal implications. Intel cannot even sell its fabs because no one will buy a fab built on a process that doesn't work! That means $10s of billions of capital investment needs to be written off as loses. Even if Intel funds other fabs to make its chips their own capital investment in fabs won't return revenues making its chips. Intel will pay full price to other. Accounting perspective means not just to forget about the dividend but to expect negative EPS. ..yes losses based on accounting rules and writing off capital. In addition to this their huge debt of $10s of billions will now be downgraded to junk level. This is more than just catching a falling knife thinking it's oversold. It's going to low $20s at best, possibly lower.Analysts will now issue sells downgrades with way lower PTs. It wasn't yet out Fri but will be for Monday bringing another sell wave. Institutions cannot hold with massive analysts downgrades forcing to sell. Implications and panic of the US losing fabs manufacturing leadership as attached analyst comments, will fuel retail selloff shares. It's worse than ibm's paying global Foundries to take its fab in return for commitment to make ibm's processors. Ibm's fab was working no disaster failure like Intel's. No one will buy Intel's fabs other than for scrap salvage of equipment. Playingwith fabs is very dangerous. Next to be exposed as hurting is $nvda ! Its move and failure to go to Samsung for 7nm isn't over yet. Ampere leaks are real and nVidia's won't be competition with amd's big Navi. TSMC's doesn't have the capacity for nVidia now hence its first launching would be with Samsung old 10nm+ marked as 8nm for hype purpose. It's not 7nm EUV even close as big Navi will use. So I'm expecting a sharp drop in nVidia's pps. ..Out of all this AMD emerges as the only choice and clear winner. Even before fab issues for both Intel's and nVidia's products, for which AMD assumed competition straight on with such. With fab issues it's not a competition anymore . Remember combined market cap of Intel’s and nVidia's is $500B vs AMD's $80B. Doubling AMD's is in aSHORT ORDER. Leading to breaking $100 PPS very quickly. nVidia's ER in less than a month...Just read the following analyst's writing. Similar will show from all othrrs with big downgrades. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-25/intel-stunning-failure-heralds-end-of-era-for-u-s-chip-sector"
"Mobileye was profitable last year for Intel, look at their 10-K. This is for those who say it’s years away, no its not. This year might be break even due to Covid, but it’ll only be a bump in the road."
"The servethehome article, ""Intel Xe HPC Ponte Vecchio Shows Next-Gen Packaging Direction"", has interesting comments relating the Ponte Vecchio packaging to Intel's plans for Client 2.0, which servethehome refers to as ""purpose build client"". The ""Final Words"" section also acknowledges that Intel is two or three steps ahead of AMD and NVDA in their multi-process, multi-die advanced packaging technology."
"Take a look at Intel Capital! Try telling me, this is not the best position tech company to disrupt the WORLD!"
Nice cup and handle = breakout
"Ace, Intels old antique processors with patches vs Undervalued AMD new 12nm, 7nm processors that gives much better GM to companies and shareholders; Win, win, win situation for AMD.Investors don't get GE by Intel 10nm,& 80 pounds cooler hidden under the table??????????"
"ON July 26th Intc reported earnings, beat on top and bottom line and raised guidance. Beat consensus by 8%. INTC also has a 2.9% dividend yield. The street rewarded the company by giving it a 15% unjust haircut in the last 6 weeks. All the other noise is just that, NOISE. This stock is way oversold."
"Coordinated charlatan articles has no credibility, but the managed to sell you yesterday antique Intel for over $60s.?"
It's all about the conference call that will determine the price.
"The trend of large scale foundry (and their advantages) can't be reversed and hard to compete even intel try to hold on to manufacturing, partially due to the need of national security pushed by US government.Maybe the middle ground is like AMD did: split out to fabless designer INTC and foundry business that will take INTC and external business as well (with partial US incentive supports) . INTC can keep high margin. Share holder might be happier.Time to retry that strategy."
So I guess INTC can have PE of 18 like AAPL or PE of 90 like AMD..AMD sales down 22% and profit down to 50%.. so next quarter up is ok? I guess INTC can have PE of 90 after next qtr too.
20x this year's estimated earnings puts us at $95. Any questions?
Yes it isBobbyjoe but you can call me BobbyNEW CEO takes it to 100 this year.

Imagine your most important documents are in guessable URL! I’d the leak was there to be viewed and not “hacked” as they claimed! What a crooked intentions to whomever they favor. Obviously the big institutions since the volume picks up towards the end of the trading day! What a SHAM.
Swan bought huge Intel stock.He won
45 is coming soon
"Intel interim CEO has made 2 open market purchases in recent couple weeks. You shorts have been warned, $50 is coming fast."
Eps and rev are good yes. But guidance + cloud/data group disappointment imo
Fire Swan! get a tech guy in there
heading lower
"I have a newbie question, why doesn't Intel just buy AMD? There should be no antitrust issues with plenty of chip makers in the market..."
"Intc has dominant position in silicon photonics, which is the way to go for data center and Lidar. Its low pe has much more upside when mobileye and si photonics explodes. Did i mention they pay nice dividend too? In a turmoil like we are in, put money in Intel is much safer than other high pe companies or sit cash on the sideline. Intel has the vision to acquire mobileye and si-photonics proved they can execute. Both are technology wonder that represents 20 years of work. Now the pay day is just around the corner. I have over 3k shares at 57 plus 90call options for Jan. 2023."
"here we go, $65 closing"

"On 14nm, Intel can achieve 5.3GHz, AMD on 7nm only 4.37GHz. Say no more. I know who's the winner here. Just give it some time. 7nm from Intel is 5nm from TSMC. Check on Wikichip website."
Should be $29

"2 weeks ago I sad Loeb and Cathie W being wrong about Intel. Google for yourself. ""Cathie Wood’s Flagship ETF Is on Brink of Erasing All 2021 Gains"""
"I don't like Loeb, but maybe this will be the catalyst INTC needs to get back on track."
"Option volatility has dried up, barely at 30%. Money cannot be made playing options. Will revisit Intel in 2021, once it crosses 50!!"
Now Underwood quits - what is left here? So sad.
Short selling a company with strong fundamentals and connections can be unlimited losses. Cover up and invest instead.
Buy the dips in Technology. INTC's business is extremely strong and their valuations is exceptional.
So INTC upside is 900% by out sourcing... WOW.. what a deal
"Bottoms in. Oversold for a small delay. Let's be honest, market share won't get taken from AMD. Intel is too big to fail now and has a competitive advantage. Slow climb from now on to $70 to reach intrinsic value."
"Both AMD and #Intc got hit on MSFT Arm news but look at the difference on Friday and today in volume. Intc Friday did 3X their 3 month average, AMD did just a tick over their 3 month average. Look at today and Intc over their 3 month average while AMD 2/3 of their 3 month average. Obvious the market not bailing out at all on AMD while they are on Intc."
P/E only $11. AMD $124. I don’t get it.
Mantra... Wall St Hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Keep that in mind when buying this stock.
Funny all the trolls/traders scurrying around like so many cockroaches on a hot stove Very Strong Buy Imo
I expect INTC to announce that going forward there will be no questions allowed on the cc!

**ALERT*Because INTEL is a MEGA STOCK with a market cap of over 200 BILLIONS and Because it is on the DOW index the large institutions and stakeholders buy it to make people think the news is not that BAD so that the stock does not collapse in selling but IMHO this is very bad news and those that sell ASAP will be glad they did as the big holders only have so much of peoples 401K money to prop the stock and then it will drop much more !Current price is 45.00 ah on jan 3 2018 which is near 52 week highs people that do not lock in their gains and get out relatively unscathed will greatly regret it imo...I will reference this post in a few days to prove to you I know what I am talking about !
"Please don't bother writing here anything what makes sense. It's 1 Jan'21 and I'm still drunk. I hope, you're drunk too ;)"
"don't understand why keep saying that AMD is better bla bla bla... as far as I understand I can own both companies!!! :). we all know that technology is growing a lot, no matter what..."
INTC beat estimates by 40%. TSM only beats by 8%
"Intel will probably have a good day tomorrow due to the recent earnings from the technology sector, which has been reflected in after hours and futures."
"Morgan Stanley, Cowen & Co, BMO upgraded intel to buy with price of $70-75."
Buy INTC! Support American manufacturing 
Intel investors have two options to unload at the highs and move to NVDA $554.70 or Undervalued AMD $91.53........... Coordinated charlatan articles won't work this time for Intel like the last two weeks........

"For Intel to deliver 5GHz with an off-the-shelf processor shows just how good its 14nm++ process is. This is an industry first and it's done at Intel's very refined 14nm++, not 10nm or 7nm. This underscores the point that there's a lot more to the quality of a processor than pitch-distance. This is consistent with business reality because customers buy for performance and overall value and very few care about internal design nuances. I assure you, if any of us had one of the new 28 core 5GHz Intel CPUs we'd be focused on its performance and value and little else."
Intc rerate coming soon. With the same PE as MSFT at 32 means a SP of 160 in the coming years. Would Intc become the next MSFT which went from 32 to 232 under a new leadership? Only time will tell. But the near term trajectory is at least a 20 PE from here in 6 months.
highly undervalued below 70

"So the current administration has made it more difficult to obtain H1b visas (the application for which opens today)... a tool that was used successfully for decades to undercut the wages of American workers at companies like Intel... So now, in the most recent cost cutting effort by the bean counter CEO, Robert Swan, they are simply outsourcing American jobs in IT to Infosys, an Indian company. These layoffs are just a sign of the times and have been coming for a decades now. The first Infosys contract that laid the groundwork for all this was obtained in 2009... Just goes to show you that Intel is confirming its position as a GLOBAL company, despite the fact that they receive subsidies for being based in the USA. And the investment in Israel is just another nail in the coffin of the American workers. Enough is enough!"
#1 in Valuelines dividend portfolio. Doesn’t seem to act like a numero uno
"Swan might not be a stalwart, but he was capable. Kudos for keeping the ship straight while the company looks for a ""technical"" CEO."

"I sold all my shares of INTC and bought AMD shares. AMD is a lot cheaper, more room for an upside and their products portfolio are very good!"
"""Intel has been pushing hard to get its own discrete graphics group up and running. Part of that push has been hiring some of the best executives from competitors around the industry. Intel has already hired a former AMD marketing director Chris Hook and former AMD executive Raja Koduri for its discrete GPU team. Intel has added another former AMD name to its roster with the hiring of Darren McPhee."" "
Intel is going to have to work through a bottleneck of excess supply. Manufacturing increased last 2 quarters to hedge against additional tariffs that were supposed to go into effect on January 1st. The government shutdown will add to a slight drag on forward guidance. Enterprise IT spending is beginning to slowdown as companies look to cut cost in a decelerating earnings year. Slow down in the smart phone handset market will add to pressures. Too much downside risk for 2019. Stock doesn't breakout after earnings. Buy puts if you want to profit.
Easy double from here.Chips are in high demand.
stop selling people!! i need to wait for intel to reach $71 to break even. not good!
"Intel has a huge gap down, while Amd has a gap up. Gaps always get filled which means Amd is coming down and Intel is going up. Just a matter of time."
51.21+1.46 (+2.93%)As of 10:24AM EST. Market open.A VERY GOOD QUARTER
"INTC is officially going to be outperforming AAPL, GOOG, etc this decade."
Buy and HOLD NOW
"OK, here's what I think. When Intel starts manufacturing chips in 7nm which as we know has more transistors per sq/mm than 5nm from TSMC then potentially, AMD could approach Intel and ask to spare some capacity to get some chips manufactured for them. I know it sounds crazy but... TSMC plant in Arizona and 600+ Taiwanese staff won't be ready to manufacture anything for the next 3 or 4 years. Meantime, China could get a strong economic or military grip on Taiwan and then... AMD, NVIDIA and Apple will be left in the dust or... can ask Intel to step in and help. Crazy? I don't think so. The US gov is planning to support with extra $$$ and tax rebates local companies and Intel seems to have the most advanced fabs on US soil so far. China took back Tibet and HK and as we also know, they're not the ones to be trusted. Anything can happen."
So AMD's single digit growth is not taking share from INTC..https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20190730PD207.html
Lol posting a pre meltdown graph. Lol this is getting destroyed in 2018.

"tomshardware article ""Intel's Tiger Lake-H Family Leaks: Five 8-Core and 6-Core Models""has a chart showing 5 GHz boost on the top Tiger Lake H45 chip.Looks like Intel's 10SF process is slightly ahead of the 4.9 GHz max boost clock of the most recent zen3 parts on tsm 7nm. It's a notable recovery for Intel's 10nm processing. We have been told that 10ESF is higher performance, so it will be interesting to see what Alder Lake-S achieves. Recent leaks confirm that it supports PCIE5 and DDR5, so we know that at least the IO data rate has been updated."
great forecasts way above estimates
"Intel's current redness is an ominous sign, especially once AMD announces amazing earnings."
Dead cat bounce. Earnings will make you realize.

intel is a great company and they will be back but your looking at at least 2023 ? and it ran up because of all the new investors like robin hooders it was just to expensive for now so its come down its that simple when it comes down to a more reasonable price a share like 43 to 45 a share I will buy more
This little run Intel is going on is only because they are switching up management. Which means even the company knew it was failing. Why would anyone still be involved with Intel when Lisa Su is doing a way better job over at AMD!! Intel stock price jumped in the short term but will fall in the long term as AMD continues to crush Intel
"The reason why Intel is so undervalued now is because of the lack of confidence in its roadmap 3,5 years from now. The new CEO helped gaining back the confidence hence the stock price is up. It's that simple.I don't see why with booming of computing platforms (data center, dGPU, AI, ADAS, 5G, etc.) Intel can not be priced similar to the industry. With PE of only 20 Intel's valuation should be tripled in 3-5 years, given income growth of just 10% per year."
BOOYAHHH INTC !
$AMD earnings report...whos jumping on board!!
Intel at $50.00?............ When was the last time?

"I read the Spectre white paper and, wow, complete disbelief at how this performance feature ever made it into the core design is beyond belief. Going back to the 386, so much time and effort was put into segregation between user level and kernel privilege and then the BTB and speculative execution changed all that. Like it or not, you cannot make accesses to kernel memory visible in a cache. Speculative execution could have its own cache and swap in lines in the event that a speculative execution becomes valid, but in the case that the execution path is invalid, the data should never get outside the pipeline."
"One thing I regularly used to hear in Silicon Valley was that you partner with Apple once. The company brand and revenue is attractive, but it is allegedly so abusive to suppliers that, given a choice, many would prefer to have avoided the experience. Like a bad marriage, or just hitting your head against the wall, getting out may seem painful but far less destructive than staying in. Intel and the industry are best served by Apple going its own way, allowing Intel to better focus on the rest of its OEMs and increasing the health of the market. Apple may regret this move, because while they were an Intel partner, Intel was neutral in the Mac vs. PC battle, that’s about to change, and Apple may not have factored in the resulting unanticipated collateral damage as Intel pivots from partner to competitor. Rob Enderle"
Why I don't have good feeling about the direction INTC is heading? Technical chart points to 44 but I am not selling... I am going to die with INTC because I made so much since long time ago :(
"$intc is a dividend stock and Intel has control over the share prices with buybacks and what not. Intel is a strong company with 95% market share in DC. Whatever bad news Intel has today will materialize in 2 years which is plenty of time to readjust. One thing Intel does not have control over is marketshare, if AMD releases a 2x more powerful CPU next month, Intel will lose marketshare and once that starts happening it's not easy to stop, and that's something which will start to affect the stock price because it will force Intel to report lower earnings, or lower margins, or higher product costs to offset but that will only hurt marketshare further. It's only easier to increase product costs to offset if you are in monopoly, but with a competitor selling a superior product the consequences are severe. Intel may be down after their ER but it's hard to say because they increased their Cascade Lake price by 10% as is reported when they sell this to OEMs, but the OEMs in turn sell it to customers for 60% discounts. These discounts are not being shown as negative earnings but as marketing operational costs which are probably offset by firing, cost_cutting and laying off US workers. This schinanigan can only go on for so long. Eventually the tower will fall hard."
"ANOTHER INTEL MANAGEMENT MISSTEP. Investing 1 billion dollars to ramp up production in an inferior product. Why did they not foresee and ramp up in advance. It will take months and quarters to build, expand, hire, produce and ship. This is not an instant fix for the supply demand issue."
"Have to give it to Swan, 4 quarter will beat expectations. No bad news coming on that front as speculated by others."
New CEO!
I will buy below $30
This is unreal
"Just doupled in on Intel. going from 5k to 10k .... Now..The way I read it and In my opinion:the 10% drop is a minority group of ((activist investors)) who are trying to assert their point that: a company should yield profit TODAY. Not in 3-5 years ... and as an investor I care about my bottom line Today... not the strategic positioning of a critical competitive edge. The other camp (and the CEO), in my personal opinion, believe in the long term / strategic positioning of the silicon manufacturer as the industry unequivocal leader as an irreplaceable contributer to the overall competitive advantage, and therfore, long term profitability and viability of the firm...Whichever way this strategic pivot goes is anyone's guess... but either way my money is on intel emerging in a stronger possition.J.B.Sc. in Computer Science, MQM, MBA, PMP, PgMP."

Most undervalued stock. Buy!
It is about time for INTC to announce a dividend increase as profits continue to rise
BK did not risk insider trading to bail at 44 to save a few % drop. He bailed at 44 to avoid the MASSIVE loss in share price that heading their way. What do they have to sell? Optane? Because its not working CPUs. 50% drop in 2018 is likely. Expect a bump in 2019 when they get a working CPU out until its learned just how far behind AMD they are in performance when they cant put everyone at risk to get better benchmarks.
Crashed last July. Recovered and crashed again in October. Recovered again and above last July's price point? Does the market think Intel's troubles are solved already? So Pat is Jesus? He can turn 14nm chips into 7nm chips with a wave of his hand lol. INTC poised to dump again next week. This time the market will finally learn its lesson and its all downhill from here!
CRAMER says INTC has more upside here.................big changes coming with new CEO

"(""Investors should also recognize that INTC has a P/B ratio of 3.17. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 5.48. Over the past year, INTC's P/B has been as high as 3.57 and as low as 2.42, with a median of 2.89.Finally, our model also underscores that INTC has a P/CF ratio of 7.87. This metric takes into account a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find stocks that are undervalued based on their solid cash outlook. INTC's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 12.03. Over the past year, INTC's P/CF has been as high as 8.16 and as low #$%$44, with a median of 6.86.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Intel's great Value grade.

"Swan was CEO for two years. During that time, the company value dropped by 10 percent, Microsoft and Apple dropped Intel as a supplier, the company failed on 7nm, talent left the company, and AMD ran circles around Intel.Why was Swan being paid $66 million a year? As a comparison, Jensen Wang gets paid $11 million a year. I hope the activist investors put a ""no higher than Jensen"" clause in the CEO pay. Meaning, the total stock and salary compenstation can be no higher than what Jensen gets. You shouldn't be allowed to tank a company and get paid 6X the rate of the best CEO in the business."
Intel is dominating the news today.

Sure intel is a massive company, with massive sales, but they show no urgency to stem innovation shortfall and loss of market share.They also need to scrap the dividend and re-invest every spare penny to get back to the pinnacle that they once occupied.Scrapping the dividend and allowing the new CEO to operate with free reign would signal to the market that they're serious about becoming top dog again!"
2 months ago I posted (look it up) that we’d be at the mid $50’s by Feb 1st. Feb 4th is here. Dividend day and we are at $57.68! There may be some profit taking after you get paid. People sell. Time to buy on a pull back. I can see $53/$54 before the rise to $60. It will hit a new 52 week high by the end of the year. I see $68/$69 by Christmas.

Why on earth would you increase dividends when you're getting killed on the innovation front. If they cut the dividend or suspended it for a couple of quarters then this thing would have blown up.

The data center group, IoT, non-volatile memory solutions and programmable solutions businesses account for 46 percent of total revenue, up from 44 percent one year ago. Intel boasts multiple drivers of growth, including a new line of industry-leading processors for cloud computing and others. A continued focus on data centers and cloud processing is contributing to increasing profitability and market share gains. A potential supply contract loss with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) in 2020 will ""not be material at that time."" The company's acquisition of Mobileye makes it better positioned to further penetrate the automotive market. The balance sheet and free cash flow are sufficient to not only fund growth and R&D, but to enhance shareholder return."

"Analysts are disappointed at Intel's plan and they're going to dump shares tomorrow.""The lack of a strong embrace of outsourcing from new CEO Pat Gelsinger drove shares down 4.7% after hours. Shares rose 6.5% during regular trade, when the results were released ahead of the close. The company said it was investigating “non-authorized” access to some of the results, with the Financial Times quoting its chief financial officer as saying the microchip maker had been hacked.""“We didn’t get our answer on which foundries and when,” said Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy. “They pushed the can down the road.”Keeping manufacturing in-house means higher investments. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon questioned whether Gelsinger, currently the chief executive of VMware Inc who previously spent 30 years at Intel and announced his intention to return just last week, has had sufficient time to dig into the issue.“It was pretty obvious they were trying to borrow his credibility” when Gelsinger endorsed Intel’s delayed 7-nanometer technology, Rasgon said."

"This time tomorrow, Intel will either be basking in the glory of a well-deserved comeback or it will be wallowing in the misery of another gap down. No one knows, but that does not mean we can’t have fun and try to make our own prediction. So, given the options; it will go up, go down or move sideways, spin the wheel and choose one. For me, I say Intel will go up by 60 cents in tomorrow’s trading and will be flat after the ER. Go ahead, spin the wheel. Let us know what you think."

"Intel's server market safe from competition? So much fuss was made a few weeks back about Microsoft designing its own ""server"" chips presumably to be used in cloud.96% of ALL the IT spending is on-prem, meaning it's on customer's premises not in cloud.IT spending (and cloud) are both going to boom in coming years for various reasons.So we are talking about a minute chance MSFT (or others) may have in displacing INTC in that 4% market. And that too in years to come at the very minimum. granted cloud share will increase but I see no imminent threat to INTC in server market.And AMD? Can they even meet customer demand, seriously, given their supply constraints?Big overreaction in my opinion!Link will be provided in replies (if allowed, else search ""AWS Decommoditizing Compute With Re:Invent 2020 EC2 Announcements""https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2020/12/15/aws-decommoditizing-compute-with-reinvent-2020-announcements/?sh=646a21657827"

When a new kid takes the top spot on the podium, the former winner always thinks it was an impossibility, but now that it’s happening, it seems to surprise Intel investors much more than it is surprising the AMD crowd. We’ve seen this coming for a couple years. And amazing to see actually happening. AMD is on fire folks. Embrace it to save your portfolio."

"AMD investor here. Listened in with particular focus on the 10nm progress - have to say, it sounded like a bunch of double talk. Some reports a month ago were saying 10nm yields were improving and the time frame for shipments had been moved up. But it's clear now that was BS. Now they are sounds like they ""might"" be shipping 10nm by holidays 2019, but it sure wasn't stated with a lot of confidence. Then there was all the wishy washy talk about how they are allocating capital across 14nm, 10nm and 7nm - which also had low confidence. Bottom line - there will not be any substantial 10nm products in 2019, and it's not even clear when in 2020 they will show up. Looks like AMD is going to have at LEAST a one year lead on new process tech. I think Charlie D. nailed it again with regards to the Intel 10nm disaster. Long AMD."

"What is wrong with this picture. News of sale of a unit move the share price? For a tech co, it is important for product development at cutting edge. This news to move share up indicates INTC is no longer a top player in the sector and merely a co with assets to sell and cash to distribute as dividend."
Beating by a penny isn't going to cut it. There will be a huge sell off on the news after running up ahead of earnings. The only time stocks gain after they report is when the stock didn't run up ahead of earnings and they beat the street big time. Not going to happen here. Any news that the company said they would beat is also #$%$ because it's illegal to disclose that.
"So, Loeb was wrong re Intel fabs and now Cathie Wood seems to be also wrong about INTC going down to $40. The amount of money leaving Ark Investment has tripled in the last days. Will she ever admit she was wrong? Nope. She wanted to buy more INTC and that's why she was telling all bad news. Remember, don't listen to ANALyCYSTS. They don't work for you. Do the opposite and give it 3 months."
"never mind the 10nm, the 14nm is excellent! That is their answer"

Intel is back to pre Pandemic sales and this is on the current 14 and 10 nm platforms.

Record year and earnings for Intel. Let the day traders sell it off and buy more at a better price. Congrats Intel!!!
$75 this Friday.. and still too cheap.
"Why did they do share buybacks (at higher prices), raising dividends and now trying to recapitalize at lower share offering prices???Intel (INTC) on Friday filed a registration statement covering the potential sale of an indeterminate amount of securities.The securities, which may be offered from time to time, include debt securities, common shares, preferred shares, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts, guarantees, and units, according to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission."
"What! How does a hacker get financially sensitive information out of a company like Intel? More than likely, the hacker was an Intel insider."
"Jason Grebe at CITI conference.""On the PC side of the house, we're improving our output. We're continuing to invest in 14 nanometer technology at the same time as 10 nanometer technology. We have a steady nice beat on our Q2 guidance from a PC perspective ...""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4289655-intels-intc-management-citi-global-tech-conference-transcript?page=9"
"Imagine what would have happened to Intel if they did not beat earnings and/or guided higher. Wall street investors are not fooled by the fact that $INTC beat was due to very low guidance last couple of quarters. The fact that they pulled in an extra billion dollars for selling 5g helped, or maybe they would not have even beat expectations. They can try to fool the masses and rookie investors but everyone with half a brain can read between the lines (and lies). The one solid fact was that they lost a ton of data center business. Which as everyone knows went to AMD. Hence you see today's movement where Intel lost all their gains and AMD actually went up. AMD might not beat earnings for 2Q but I truly believe that does not matter as 3Q and beyond will be incredible. All the earnings have to confirm is that AMD data center revenue is growing significantly and we shall see the same movement today for both AMD and Intel but at a much bigger scale. LONG FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME!!!"
"option $60 put 80 contracts, exp jan 29th"
Best performance of DOW in 2021 will be INTC>
"The new leader on CPUs & GPUs undervalued AMD, will benefit big times from Samsung, TSMC new FAB in the great USA................ Are they building those new FABs for modern superior secure AMD 5nm, 3nm? undervalued AMD the King of 7nm..........."
so all of the sudden Intel is fine despite of the 10nm delays and the serious chip shortage from insufficient production???

"The stock has a long way to go because the pumpers who follow stocks are not here. Look, even the amd board has 20 or so people reading but here it is dead most of the time. Lots of room for the pumpers to jump in to Intel. Bet you never saw this coming did you Stacey Rasgon. Your 30 price target is comical.Will you move it to 31 now?"
$intc at $50 for AMD's 50th Anniversary?
why would this stock fall after crushing their earnings? smh
"Remember 1999,Back 2 the future.Long and Strong 20 plus."
Intel needs to move their earnings report to a Monday. Most selling occurs on Friday so why release earnings Thursday night?

"It tells you the so called expert manipulators don't know About modern superior secure 7nm vs antique products at 14nm. Misleading articles always have a short live, Do you own DD and win."
"WOW just read what Intel CEO stated ... this is huge!! It's for 2H ! Here it is... well $20 pps is just a pessimistic bottom number... 20% market after all were holding upgrades is multi billion revenues in 2H. But why just servers...?INTEL LOSING 20% MARKET SHARE TO AMD ON EVERYTHING! IN 2H!!here is the quote:""Mr. Krzanich was very matter-of-fact in saying that Intel would lose server share to AMD in the second half of the year. This wasn't new news, but we thought it was interesting that Mr. Krzanich did not draw a firm line in the sand as it relates to AMD's potential gains in servers; he only indicated that it was Intel's job to not let AMD capture 15-20% market share""Intel has nothing to stop AMD not just taking 20% but more of everything...Wait for amd 2Q ER and big guidance on Q3... upgrades across the board from all analysts are eminent!"
"first question...duel path manufacturing....cap ex spend? exhausted effort..7nm tech 2023 road map we will leverage IDM advantage also flexibility to look outside. still control supply chain. spending will increase for 7nm. Pat will decide on product road map. more spend on AI. Pat likes progress on 7 NM. Will also increase outside foundry business. 2 question. Gross Margins 10 nm ramp up. Q1 atypical seasonality impacted mix and tremendous PC demand. should exist in fist half of 2021. some higher cost, but savings on 10nm cost. Higher 10 NM and client mix....small core...10 nm coming in. Tailwinds strong keep margins strong. said 59% 2020. finished 57.5. much higher volume. demand for 10 nm products led to a little smaller margin. high pc sales also lower margin, but more income. better mix in 2021 given exits. Q3...progress on 7nm. 2023 on track. Product road map should be hit.Q4...2023 competitive foundry still ahead...what does Intel need to do to leapfrog competition? 2 things...belief on leadership products....process and packaging and multitude of architectures. 6 pillars of technology to deliver. Second will invest in process technology. Will continue to invest in next generation. Will increase outside foundry business, but will also resume leadership"

"Hoe can Intel compete with foundries that spread costs across Apple, AMD, Nvidia, QCOM?"
Too pricy still
"Whenever I see so much negative comments, especially from people who do not own INTC, I know, something good is going to happen. So much time and effort to bring the price down? They must have a good reason for it and I bet, they're going to spend more time here for the next 3 weeks. Wait for Intel ER and CES in Jan'21. Congrats longs and a Happy New Year!"
"Judging by the cold reception the new CEO got from the investors, he knows that he will have to share a lot more details about Intel in his next appearance in Febuary. He will need his investors to rally around him for support for any initiative that he may have in mind. He will need to push the price to 100 at least to get any momentum in confidence."
"luckily i sold a lot the last 3 weeks. CEO very optimistic as usual, and 3 top analysts congrats them for their results. The main problem for us they report in ASC606 vs Non-Gaap etc, but I could not find any negative comment, focus on Q&A transcript. What i don't like is patent licensing being flat trough 2023 (note that is the MAIN reason why RMBS is so much behind other chip companies!!!!). Their growth accelerated in Silicon IP and they can grow with $AMD and $INTC no matter which. They don't fear new competition from Asia. Unfortunately the Intel Cascade Lake buffer chip will impact ONLY End of year =Q1 2022, i don't like that. Their 2019 acquisitions contributed to IP and they look for further acquisitions. lastly, they continue to consider share buyback a business, instead of improving their revenue base. I am mixed on that. As i sold ASP above $20.40 i will nevertheless buy back some shares sold and sell any rally above 19.50"

"AMD , Isn't just going to take 20% of the market share that's just for the moment.AMD, will ultimately put INTEL out of business with better ,and Higher quality products at a slightly better price.AMD, will ultimately take 35% of market share away from Intel by years end !!!!!!!!!!!!"
It will be $52 tomorrow..
"The last time Apple tried to make their own chips, they almost went bankrupt. This is just a tactic to renegotiate with Intel. It would cost Apple billions to get their own chips made plus hire the right employees that have the expertise in the field and keep the R&D department up and running. Apple makes consumer products and they will never manage the chip business at all. Heck, Apple could have already brought out their own version of LCD and LED television, they talked about it years ago. They already have enough die hard fans who would have jumped on the opportunity to buy the televisions, but guess what, they still have not managed to bring out the product. This just tells that Apple does not have the right management who can manage different divisions within the company. Thus, the rumor of Apple no using Intel chips are really just rumors. This is a buy stock at this levels."
Stop comparing Intel to AMD. That's like comparing a sports car to a tricycle.
there is a big unfixable security flaw in its chips and its CEO dumped all his shares but what else can go wrong... time to buy? :)
"About time to get a technologist back in the helm. Gelsinger might be a little rusty on his fab knowledge (VMWare isn't hardware, but Gelsinger, a former Intel technologist, has had some time to think about Intel from a distance, and as a consumer of Intel product.), but he can contribute far more than some finance guy or gal."

"A bit OT: Dont you happen to know wat happened to CSCO (recent 15% drop)? Together with T , these stocks are interesting to me. Economically stable, decent dividends, growth in the future is possible, no hype price."
This market is going to have a 20% correction as soon as conflict starts between China and USA over taiwan..maybe more. You have to be ready for this stuff cause China is not going to give up on this..they walked into Hong Kong and Taiwan TSMC is next.
Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets. Stay away from this stock.
"Horribly run company and culture. The only reason the stock has performed well the past few years is 1). data server/cloud computing growing leaps and bounds and 2). Near zero competition in the high-end. Its not because Intel has become better. Both 1) and 2) could be changing direction very soon, however."

"Raising guidance, signaling the all clear!"
"medium has article ""Optimizing DLRM by using PyTorch with oneCCL Backend"" describing Intel's oneCCL backend performance with pytorch vs MPI for DLRM systems.I get the impression that the pendulum is swinging back towards CPU processing for these sparse models that are implemented by embedded database tables.The article also describes 2x communication time reduction for distributed bfloat16 training vs fp32, provided by Cooper Lake Xeons. This can potentially provide a big gain for distributed processing, since, as shown in their Fig 7, communication time can be as large as compute time."
Anyone else thinking this “rebellion” in GME and AMC has funds selling stocks like INTC to cover their losses?And won’t running up GME set up the greatest short sale opportunity ever once the run up inevitably reverses?
"I would sell. Yes u can buy intel untill it comes with new chip by which, amd will b ahead by two generations. In tc is done on gaming PCs and server market! Sorry!"
"Intel CEO is a finance guy. Focusing on share buy back, cost and dividend. He is not an engineer to resolve current issues, strategy for R&D and future growth.

"So basically intel is failing at every turn stuck on 14 nano and can’t even make theseIn enough quantity...how is this good news ? “Intel has worked for years to build up its wireless business. It plowed millions of dollars into developing smartphone chips under previous CEO Brian Krzanich, who touted 5G and mobile technology as a big new revenue stream for a company that has long dominated the computer-processor market.The company won a deal to supply modems for some of the iPhones Apple started selling in 2017. It became Apple’s sole supplier of modem chips.But Intel got a late start when it came to 5G and hasn’t been able to keep pace with rivals like Qualcomm. Mr. Krzanich’s abrupt departure last June for violating company policy by having a relationship with an employee left the future of the modem initiative uncertain.Intel had expected to start sending sample 5G modem chips to customers in the second half of this year and put them into production next year before dropping those plans on Tuesday. Qualcomm, by contrast, is already working on its second-generation 5G modem.”"

"Intel didn't have a plan to release a 7nm CPU in 2021. Both these scheduled chips were and are still 10nm. They did have a plan for a 7nm Ponte Vecchio GPU, but apparently the 7nm portions of that are being built at TSM, per the previously posted slides from tsm.The most positive announcements today were the successful power-on of the petaflop GPU and the info that they expect to be sampling Sapphire Rapids Xeon this year. Also that Ice Lake Server 10nm wafers are in full production. Sapphire Rapids has DDR5 and PCIE5/CXL before it has even appeared on the $AMD roadmap, plus AMX matrix operations on bfloat16.Also there was mention of a technology day ... but without giving the date.Intel does have the hotchips 2020 presentations on Ice Lake Server, Tiger Lake, Agilex, Tofino 2 and Xe GPUs coming up in mid August. AMD seems to have no presentation of zen3 scheduled."" In the second half of 2021, Intel expects to deliver a new line of client CPU’s (code-named “Alder Lake”), which will include its first 10nm-based desktop CPU, and a new 10nm-based server CPU (code-named “Sapphire Rapids”).

What a swan song !!!!
"Swan does not see Intel like investors see intel. Swan has a long term view of the company. Investors want to make money now, or they will go elsewhere. As there are many other stocks you can invest in to make money, intel's stock has been left behind. When Intel has righted the ship and investors don't have to worry about lagging productions and missteps, intel will rise again. Investors will be proud to own it once again."

"Seems like a knee jerk reaction of computer trading, just because $Qcom popped doesn't mean that intc should go up. On a normal day sure, but in this case it's a major loss to Intel.

"Futures are very jumpy. Jumping between red and green, very quickly. I wouldn't expect a trade deal just yet, but from what Bloomberg was saying this morning, it sounds like China underestimated us and are backed into a corner, so I would expect a deal soon. Maybe even over the weekend or tomorrow. Anything is possible. But I doubt it will help $INTC any, like many of them hope. What intel fanboys fail to recognize is, China was just a convenient tale to tell. Now the CEO sees that the China wasn't an excuse for anyone else, they needed to come clean, but they still only told a half truth."
"All this time I was looking to buy the AMD 5950x chip which is virtually impossible to buy right now, but now that I saw the leaked benchmark for the Intel Core i7-11700K, ummm, I think I'll wait and see how the Intel one performs as early tests shows it is faster."
"In my opinion, we all got to stumble once in a while. I strongly believe that out sourcing is a good way to go and will get things back on track. Intel’s fabs will still be utilized without the strain. Oversold!! We will be back in the $60’s very soon."

I can't see how Intel employees are going to keep their confidence in their CEO after he sold the bulk of his shares with this Meltdown/Spector knowledge. It's time for AMD to post job openings for top Intel design engineers.
Sometimes it’s hard to understand what investors expect from Intel. This should be at $80 with good future with new CEO. Even when AMD is ahead this stock should be way higher based on fundamentals.

The market expect real products not articles next year- 2023 we'll have the best products, bla, bla, bla. The competition has double production of new products and still sold out its modern superior secure 7nm........ I called win, win, win situation for Intel competition."
I'm sorry for the ppl that jump on Intel after just seeing eps beat
"Well $nvda fanboys as I've posted many times. ..now analysts downgrade.

""Nvidia downgraded to Hold at Craig-Hallum As previously reported, Craig-Hallum analyst Richard Shannon downgraded Nvidia to Hold from Buy with a price target of $300, down from $325. The analyst cited a more balanced risk/reward and lowered his Gaming estimates in 2021 to account for impacts from COVID-19 as well as a potential delay in next-generation GPU, somewhat offset by likely better Switch sales. Shannon is not changing his Datacenter estimates, as he sees a balance of strong demand and uncertain supply chain dynamics"""
INTC going to $300 in next 24 months!
"Intel is down in AH, but is not crashing. Probably just profit taking."
INTC should announce another $10 billion share buyback. They did great with the last one.
"Why do you guys hate AMD so much? This company is half the size and has done tremendously. Here is a quote from a leading website on technology. Now, with the upcoming Zen 4 CPUs set to shrink further to 5nm, AMD could leave Intel’s processors in the dust once and for all."
"After the new CEO takes over next week, this under $60 price of INTC will just be memories and you wish you bought more. Your hate can't make you rich. Positivity can make you rich!!!"
You heard it. TSM is going to make chip for INTC...Now $120 price target.
Free money - buy intc. The people at Intel are intelligent. They know producing in-house gives them more margin. Patience. Hold on to your stock.In the end investors need the company to make money. That’s what Intel is doing every quarter.
it's about time intels scamming lieing ways finally caught up
Intel Shorts will be wiped out.Just a fact.The new CEO will destroy the shorts.
"As far as us investors go, some of the selection committee of the Intel Board should be replaced too for appointing Swan."
AMD upgraded but Bank of America sees 30% more upside new price target 20.00
comedy of errors
Here we go.. 49.50 is possible.
Look at the 6 month charts for Intel vs AMD.. lmao...
INTC blows off bearish analysts by 20% again... 5 qtrs in a row...Time to raise the target to $100
"Thanks to the experts in this forum, who said Intel was no longer an one hit wonder. I took the hint and bought some shares. Intel casts a wide net in technology. It will ex-dividend in two days."

Intel has been in a downward trend since Jan. 2020 as viewed on the weekly chart. Intel blew right through that downward slopping trend line this week.
"Remember gaps get filled. Which is what happened today when intel surpassed it’s July 23 low of $59.98. Now we have another gap that needs to be filled. Today’s gap up! Filling the gap down was fun. Having to fill the gap up, not so much. Like pulling off a Band-Aid, better we do it now and get it over with quickly. Won’t be fun to watch, but it will give everyone another chance to pick up more shares at a bargain price."

"Let’s be honest! Some investors may want to wait longer for positive operating results, but that is like trying to time the market, which usually is a “no, no”. Intel has a great “base” with minimal downsize risk at their PE. Why not invest some now, because it is a good value, and invest more later, after they prove this was a good move! I have owned and bought and sold Intel for 25 years. It has been very good to me. I look forward to this change at this time!"
"Why would outgoing CEO Bob Swan buy $1.5 Million dollars worth of Intel stock on his way out the door. What does he know that makes him so upbeat about the company?

"Intel has licenses to do business with Huawei revoked - ReutersJan. 18, 2021 4:48 AMIntel Corporation (INTC)By: Yoel Minkoff, SA News EditorThe Trump administration has notified Huawei suppliers, including chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), that it is revoking certain licenses to sell to the telecom equipment supplier, sources told Reuters. The administration also intends to reject dozens of other applications to supply the Chinese company, escalating tensions with Beijing during its final days in office.Backdrop: The U.S. put Huawei on a Commerce Department ""entity list"" in May 2019, restricting suppliers from selling American goods and technology to the firm. Some sales like semiconducters required licenses as Washington intensified its crackdown on the company, which it labeled a national security threat.The latest action is likely to be the last against Huawei under President Trump, with Joe Biden taking the oath of office on Wednesday. It will also play out in the early days of the Biden administration (unless he decides to cancel the order).Companies that received the ""intent to deny"" notices about supplying Huawei have 20 days to respond, and the Commerce Department has 45 days to advise them of any change in a decision or it becomes final. Companies would then have another 45 days to appeal.Last week, the Trump administration added smartphone maker Xiaomi to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, restricting American investors from buying the company's shares or related securities."
Afternoon Mantra.. Wall St hates INTC and will take it down every chance it gets.
"There are many here who have studied Intel's fundamentals. How many have bought AMD in the last year, two years, 3 or 4 years? If you had bought some at one point you would probably have done so again and again. Keep studying."

I'm down 30k from previous bad investments and have been struggling living pay cheque to pay cheque for the past 9 months and just bought May 4 $55 calls yesterday as a last attempt to make something back. this might be a life changer for me can't wait until tomorrow!! thank you Intel!!

"Keep the faith intc’ers, as long as Vanguard and Blackrock hold their shares! INTC promised 7nm in 3 years. Something’s not right for a projection that’s been delayed about 5 years now and needed another 3 years! Good luck guys..."
"Just a reminder as I wouldn't be surprised if this occurs prior to the Capital Markets day scheduled for March 18th. $MSFT & $INTC aren't stupid and the muted stock price following the WSB garbage, positive earnings, and downplayed CEO comments indicate that this deal could be in the final stages. (New CEO & CFO to transition as well) MSFT trades at 12X annual revenue which the additional $27B from Nokia would translate to $324B. Even if this dropped MSFT to 10X annual revenue, that's a $270B valuation so buying Nokia for $50B to $70B makes a lot of sense."

"stocks surge, INTC down, why?"
So markets are down. Selling. What to do with the money? Treasuries very high...interest rate and return down on them. AMD is great investment especially after ovesold. ER outlook and many upgrades after are positive compared with $intc and $nvda. It will be green today. Volume is way down. Those momentum buying ahead of the ER or shorting will cover and move on. New money coming taking long position.
"Yes, very impressive,New ceo,is great and market will reward this.Intel is a 85-100 usd stock. I am in and sleep well.I am very bullish ...it is a bargain. Given the same valuation like amd or the average chip,sector, intel would be 200 Usd. Consider this."

However, AMD is aggresively enterng that market with the Radeon VEGA 7 nm. Even the older product is already giving $NVDA fierce competition. Look at the revenue trend from $NVDA Q2FY19 ER and you will see that. Their data center GPU revenue has been growing steadily at about $100M/qtr but it was only $59M last quarter. As an investor, if you are looking for growth, it's AMD and not $INTC nor $NVDA. I think what has been happening in the recent weeks is that the $INTC and $NVDA investors are leaving for AMD.

"What Intel really needs to do to re-ignite its growth engine is to buy this fast-growing semi-conductor company that has products with high demand made by cutting-edge technologies and with its stock trading at dirt cheap level, making it a steal and great fit for Intel (and a great contribution to the U.S.). Even if Intel just got 25% ownership of the company, it already has the right to get a couple seats in the board and participate in daily operations to see these world leading technologies and top-notch manufacturing process in their own eyes and have a say in this company's major moves in the future. It would be similar to American companies' and institutions' ownership in ASML, one of the most important semiconductor company in the world.Rumor is that some big suitors are already getting their hands on this global high-tech gem.

"consistent earnings beats, profitable, temporary delay in 7nm release, after another delay, management admits it needs to shake things up. data centers are driving most profits and this market is growing. still offers a decent dividend. meh, I wouldn't listen to the bears on this one. buy in in the discount but plan on holding for at least a year. you'll see profit by the time they release the 7nm"
"BREAKING - sorry but $nvda results are very bad if you dig down eliminating their usual understatement of guidance to get artificial ""beats"". Compare 2020 with 2019! Actually nvda had LESS REVENUES and earnings than the previous year! They don't grow! This has to crush the pps after a few days as the painful truth is revealed. Even $intc had a growth last year vs the previous year though guided this year at flat 2% revenues growth. AMD of course had an amazing yearly growth vs previous year and guided 30% growth this year! nVidia is standing still doesn't deserve it's inflated pps. Last year it crushed from near $300 to $150. This will happen again in a few days. Last year took a few days after the ER too as at first it jumped. Jensen gets his ""beats"" by analysts downplaying expectations but the annual results tell the story. AMD needs jump very high now as it's clearly leading nVidia and Intel on growth. Maybe will start gradual rise till March 5 Analysts day with jump after. Remember this post! nVidia did NOT do well last year as a whole! Quote ""For fiscal 2020, revenue was $10.92 billion, down 7 percent from $11.72 billion a year earlier. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $4.52, down 32 percent from $6.63 a year earlier.

Intel said 10nm desktop in 2015 and now it is 2021 and still no 10nm desktop. They expect me to believe them when they say 7nm in 2023 after another delay? I think they are just toying with investors.

"I'm still trying to guess what will be the use of the PCIE5 lanes rumored to be on the Alder Lake chip. The Dec 16, 2020 blocksandfiles article, ""Intel launches three new Optane drives. One is world’s fastest data centre SSD"", states that the coming Crow Pass Optane PMEM is used with Sapphire Rapids and supports PCIE5. I thought PMEM support implies through a 2LM memory controller, so the reference to PCIE5 is puzzling.I wonder if Alder Lake adds support to access Crow Pass PMEM via PCIE5. That would be an interesting feature if the accesses to PMEM are redirected transparently by the memory controller."

According to the Asia news I was reading there is a severe shortage of semiconductors (chips) around the world and this shortage is expected to continue. Intel is well established and a matter of picking up a phone and get new clients across the globe

Loop Capital found themselves on the wrong side. INTC target raised to $80 by i believe Morgan Stanley. I was scared going into the earnings because i had way too big a swing trade long going. Sold 75% in the post-market euphoria last night . Added back in at 66.10 in the pre-market this morning. The Godzilla haters from the AMD thread are still sputtering their driveling nonsense. I am long both stocks but they got some immature techie thirty-somethings on the thread who think they know everything. They know a lot about chips ~ pretty much zero about reading charts & trading.
"I joined this board lat year after the July gap down. I said it then and I say it now, sooner or later, most GAPS GET FILLED. It took a while, but that massive gap down got filled. Now we have another gap to deal with, a gap up! That too will get filled one day which means Intel's price will drop into the 53-54 dollar range sooner or later. No prediction when that will happen. Might happen on its own or with an overal market correction. Unless something unexpected happens, picking up a few extra shares at 54 might be a good move."

"a nextplatoform article from 2018, ""The End Of Xeon Phi – It’s Xeon And Maybe GPUs From Here"", described a NERSC-9 supercomputer architecture with Fat cores and Thin cores, with thin cores acting as accelerators. It would be interesting if Intel's Alder Lake morphs into this as an HPC design. It is actually kind of like Intel's Aurora nodes, if you substitute the GPUs for the thin cores.If Intel adds in CXL connections and the biased coherency for Gracemont accelerators in place of the Xe-HPC GPUs on the Aurora nodes ... it might look just like this design."

"Sell all your shares of INTC now, it will drop below 50."
Couple of weeks back every one was saying this is going to mid 30s. Glad I did not sell it. I only have a very small profit currently though
Knowing INTC any good news on the earnings will be negated by the general market corrections or other things and the stock dives anyway like it always done in the past. I hope I’m wrong...
watch third waves up
With a chip shortage this stock should be over $100....
Friday Intel filed for potential sale of shares. Probably why stock dropping here. May be a great entry point. I really like the new CEO and his professional abilities. I am looking to add to my position on any further drop here

If the stock does not surge into earnings it will surge post earnings. However, if we are above $57 the day they release earnings I would expect a pullback based on the old 'sell the news' theory. Long term it's all noise this stock will trade higher but if you're a trader you should place your bets accordingly."

Intel Rolls Out Patch to Fix ZombieLoad Exploit5/14/19, 3:37 PM03:37 PM EDT, 05/14/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Intel (INTC) has released a patch for the ZombieLoad vulnerability, which affects almost every computer powered by one of the company's chips as far back as 2011, according to media reports on Tuesday.If exploited, ZombieLoad will allow hackers to steal sensitive information directly from processors. Intel said ZombieLoad is made up of four bugs, which security researchers reported to the company last month.The microcode that Intel has released patches vulnerable processors, including Intel Xeon, Intel Broadwell, Sandy Bridge, Skylake and Haswell chips, Intel Kaby Lake, Coffee Lake, Whiskey Lake and Cascade Lake chips, and all Atom and Knights processors.A spokesperson for Intel told TechCrunch that after installing the patch, devices will see performance reduced by as much as 3%, and data centers by as much as 9%.

"On the daily charts, Intel is in a 15 day downtrend starting from its most recent high of $52.62. The 10 day moving average is $49.69. The 50 day moving average is $50.58 and the 150 day moving average is at $55.53. So the 10 day average is below the 50 and the 50 is below the 150. A clear downtrend. The DJI average is also in a 15 day dowmtrend. They are both moving in tandem. On the DOW, the 10 day and the 50 day moving averages are at the same point in time with the 10 day average about to go under the 50 day average if this trend continues. The DJI is 700 points below its 10 moving average, and since price always returns to its 10 moving average, we could see a nice jump in the DOW in the near future. But even if the DJI returns to its 10 day moving average, it will still be in its downtrend on the daily charts. If it does jump up 700 points and returns to its 10 day moving average, it will no doubt take Intel along for the ride which would make for a nice trade."
