Recent headlines and conversations for CI
NEED to Reverse
@cigna walk it’s customers through via Delarosa when they file claims hoping they will eventually give up. @cigna is one of most hated companies both by customers (one of the 10 most hated companies in America) and employees (read Glassdoor reviews) and exactly like Comcast it’s dommed to crash. Anyone thinking on buying it’s stock must be aware of these daily confirmed facts.
I have a dumb question. How did I get CI in my portfolio? 26 shares that I never bought. Who spun it off? Thanks and don’t hate me.
Cigna will go down. Any company which torture its customers and employees doomed to go down. Just like Comcast
Strong close would be a plus for upside.
Cigna & others are going to be under tremendous pressure until the CV crisis passes . Avoid .
in at 171.55
GS downgraded CIGNA as well.
New 52 week lows everyday. SILENCE from the leaders of this horrid company !
being around breakeven on a down day is not too bad... i guess...
I will loads another batch at 164 if I can.
I’ll have to say it . It’s Friday after the close and Cigna is now my favorite trading stock . Just WOW !!
"how low can it go,"
Down almost $70.00 a share from the 52 week high. Heads should be rolling !!!!!! The BOD is spineless as they hide under their desk.
Business rationalization or lack there of. I think some investors were expecting to hear consolidation outline and they didn't get it. Start with the duplicate Accounting and HR departments and then the low hanging fruit of numerous office space spread out around the country as easy first steps. I guess a promise or two was made but it will have to be done sooner rather than later.
Last thought before market - guess I’ll have to hope that they’ve decided to start buybacks this morning lol
Thanks OC!
This stock used to be in the 200s before they bought express scripts. Too bad Carl Icahn couldn’t stop the transaction. And now the fear of Medicare for all. This stock has truly taken a turn for the worse and may never recover for a few years
Cigna stinks it up EVERYDAY!!!!!!
47 K shares out of the gate was good for + 5 points
"If revenue is supposed to be up 200% from last year, why isn't share price up from last year? Elizabeth ain't gonna win."
Buying more today.
Have to admit the trading is anemic - low volume - like watching paint dry . No one is interested in the stock or the sector presently .

UNH beats and raises and it did not help.Does anyone really think we are going to a Medicare for all system with an entrenched red Senate??
"Just read a report on HealthCare stocks to buy .It stated Cigna’s Price to Cash Flow was 9.92x as of 04–16-21 or $ 25.47 . Humana’s at 12.39x at $35.13 . Cigna dividend $4.00 or 1.59% . Humana at $2.80 or 0.636% . The article made Humana sound more compelling than Cigna based on these numbers . There’s NO question by cash flow , earnings and dividend Cigna has Humana beat by a Texas mile when you consider how much you have to pay to buy a share of each . Cigna is also knocking on the front door in the growth comparison now too ."
It’s pathetic.... embarrassing and the CEO needs to stand up before stockholders and this shredding of equity and his plans to address it !!!!!!!!!!
$120 worst case IMO
Excuse my while I cry
"Bought at $145ish, hoping for a pop and have a cushion for some downside. No way national healthcare will pass. Insurance and medical lobbies too strong. Doesn't matter if the people want it or not. Besides, someone has to service all the customers before the bill gets paid by the Gov't. Buy on fear is a win for me."
I expect to see CI up around 195 by 6:30 tomorrow morning. CI is better than ANTM because CI has ESPX.
retest of $146 before more growth? I'm calling fall to 146 and intense bounceback after that
Wonder why CI underperform today? Earning is similar to peers like ANTM and UNH.
will we get shares of express scripts?
WOW-------Excellent EARNING and even stellar outlook and whole 2018.Stock is a Strong Buy from here.We will see upgrades from analysts and lifting estimates and price targets.
Ridiculous sell-off after solid earnings report. Buying more at $156.
PE of 15? This stock should be trading at $190 already... Ridiculous
Should have sold at 195+. Lessons learned !
"The volume isn't even that high, that's what is interesting. we have been down this road before. I am just going to turn off the computer and go away for a couple of days."
"It is easy money for CI LONGS, because CI's peers have good earnings, UNH, HUM, ANTM, so CI should not disappoint us, particularly the CI's CEO already gave us the hint that CI has strong quarter, plus don't forget CI's Express Script revenue will push the revenue this quarter more than 100% higher than last year."
"CEO already gave us the clue that CI will have a great quarter, so I just buy more options. GOOG does not guarantee that the tech sector will be great. I think health care should be safer and solid."
"keep going down, unbelievable SMH"
"buy buy. Any policy changes required 2-3 years even to replace current system. Also, are we just giving the Democrats control of Congress and White House? Election not until 18 months away people wake up and don't give up to machine and shorts"
"RESISTANCE ABOVE +5.5% at 175.7 ± 1.93 type single, strength 1+8.7% at 181 ± 1.99 type double, strength 6+11.5% at 185.8 ± 2.04 type double, strength 10"
So here we are - the day before long awaited ER . Looking over the ER that Humana just released .... it’s pretty clear to me that Cigna is running neck to neck with Humana’s results but up to now does not have nearly the same lofty PE ratio . All other things being equal Humana is either highly overpriced or Cigna is greatly underpriced . No matter how tomorrow turns out - this is how I clearly see it.
people cant keep paying theese high premuims. insane how much they are charging for nothing. somebody has to step in and stop this
losing momentum？
"Next resistance level is a long way off RESISTANCE ABOVE +7.6% at 179.8 ± 1.98 type double, strength 4 +11.2% at 185.8 ± 2.04 type double, strength 10 +15.4% at 192.7 ± 2.12 type double, strength 4"
"Healthcare stocks went up due to victory of Biden but I think Biden may have physical ability, memory and lack of energy. As time goes by you can see that Democrat Party will soon find another one to replace him before the Presidential election. That’s what I see."
Dead money. Amazon here to stay
Big gainer today WOW !
"fear too much, added more"
"Thanks to all the sellers, I bought lot more than my original holdings, this kind of sell off happens only in US. Markets are rigged to the core. CI will see at least $170 soon. Sentiment: Strong Buy"
I love my company. Easy rise to $245 by Q2 end
Riding the wave to $245 before Biden’s take over in house.
There should be no pullback today since earnings fromTSLA MSFT FB AAPL BA after hours and AMZN tomorrow. Check on dead stocks rebound due to coronavirus like DB CCL MGM DAL UAL....
"Does Cigna know that two of its directors sit on the six-member U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors? Does it know that they are helping Trump to impede voting by mail as a means to steal the 2020 presidential election? Does the company understand the risk that this poses to its reputation? Is it time for investors to sell, for consumers to switch?"
Beat!!
"MCO HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE 2015CVS HAS ""HALVED"""
Time for a bounce?
"Just trying to analyze, any thoughts on how the new drug price executive order (if hoes in to effect) can impact health insurance providers?"
"i hope the crooks get cancer, that's all I can say"
Chewy- Healthcare moving up this week in tandem I’m feeling better about Cigna’s chances of popping on earnings ( one direction or the other lol )
CI Slowly going back up as expected.
I am in. This is no brainer.
"just bought 1,000 shares. Hopefully, it reaches all times highs by earning date."
"a while back cramer said at 176 it was a steal to buy,,,,interesting how thats the top"
Like I said . I’ve turned very bearish .
Almost a $20 price swing between the morning low ( dumping on news ) and the afternoon recovery . Wow .
"hmmmmmmmmm at 186 cramer said this was an absolute buy,,,so why is he recommending stocks when they say he does not....well its still down 9 since his big buy rating"
POS
Cigna is an evil company and evil companies always go down. Always.
HEY LENNYdaDRIPCHIT-LOSER---check out how CI responded to the FACT that TRUMP CLEARED THE PBMSCI UP $5.00#$%$LOSER cvS/HIT is up 18 centsand WBA is UP .47hey CHITBOY- you are the posterchild of LOSER
"Critical time, but I have to step in when CI is in red."
Bill Clinton calls Obamacare 'the craziest thing in the world'. Does this help Cigna and other health care providers?
"Did they say 67 ""million"" or ""billion""? Is that a typo?"
"This stock can’t catch a break, good news just sends it down"
"Now I have to believe that the market makers can move the mountain. They move CI over 5 points with only 600,000 shares."
Cigna is up 9.93% to 208.04
this stock going up today too
This has become the laggard among the hmo stocksJust not today but every day. It’s down more on down days and up much less on up daysDoes Cigna only insure old people ? And ANTM only insure young people ?
CI is down 4.90% to $183.82
Next catalyst is the late July ER . I can’t think of any reason why it won’t be a tremendously positive report .
Generally agree on the health care sector—but take a look at the growth of UNH & especially Humana since last quarter —-Humana sp has crushed it about +25%. There’s no reason in my mind CIGNA can’t do the same. IMO CIGNA’s PBM side (Evernorth) has the best clinical products to contain client cost than any other. Barring an unforeseen Black Swan event (which is saying a lot these days) I would not be surprised to see 260’s by 3Q
in a divided govt ( assuming republican at least retains senate) Healthcare is status quo no matter who is president. Very bullish for managed care cos that can keep jacking prices.
sell the rally
"Value stock like CI is hard to find, low PE only 9, revenue growth is over 60% and 18% next year, earnings this quarter will be higher than last year more than 30%. I think it is the best value stock at this moment."
My goodness this company is complete garbage.
Seem like someone is buyiny up in the last few minutes with big vol.
$CI Maintains BMO Capital Markets Outperform USD 300 » USD 315 Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 264 » USD 290
CI holding up well
"don't look good , CI get stuck"
"IMO, nearing the bottom of the recent trading range"
Democratic win might affect these companies that offer private health insurance
$16.09 a share is what a $6B sale to New York Life will contribute to cash to pay down debt / buy back shares as Cigna has indicated it wants to do
A down day today will be it for me.
"I just buy a truck load of CI because I think MEDICAL FOR ALL is the BS that will not happen in the next 4 years. CI will report earnings Feb 6, the whisper number is very impressive. PE is around 11, so I think it is so cheap."
Is it a bargain below 190?
I think we end this week at $209-$211 let’s see if I’m spot on or full of wishful thinking
Curiously in the market recovery today Cigna was the strongest gainer out of the big 3 I follow which also includes UNH and HUM .
Another new high !
Cigna is down 4.94% to 169.48
Bernie does it again!!
Warren and Bernie are out there to destroy America.
"TRAIN IS LEAVING FROM THE STATION. IF ANYBODY DOES NOT CATCH THIS RIDE, WILL BE SORRY. IT IS A GOOD RISK OFF BET FOR THIS MONTH. ALL THE BIG BOYS GAING UP THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR AND MAKE TONS OF MONEY."
#$%$?!? Where is the bottom on this thing? Down $700 mln in mkt cap just today ? let alone the billions since announcement.
"MOH was up 8+ points, HUM is up 18+ points this morning. I hope CI will move up over 180 by tomorrow morning."
"whats funny is Cranmer said on CNBC that at 176+ it was a BUY all the way,,,himmmm 169 now"
"Horrid company, horrid investment horrid management. Someone needs to be in a prison. They are in every way a pathetic joke."
Today kind of tells me that political uncertainty is in fact holding this stock back . Some profit taking is to be expected but today is substantial given the recent ER .
@cigna is forcing its customers to go through via Delarosa when they file claims hoping they will eventually gI’ve up. I had several conversations with representatives and they told me it’s the policy of the company. No wonder @cigna is one of most hated companies both by customers and employees and that means that it’s doomed. This is Comcast all over again.
Down &30.00 a share in a couple of weeks. Wish I had my Express Scripts shares back. This company is GARBAGE !!!!!!!
Cigna is up 6.04% to 174.19
Do I hear $190-$195 this week ?
"only Gods in this stock market are the FANG and Tesla, everything else is dog$hit. Its simple as that. Every day value stocks lose more value."
"bounce into the end of the week, $170 at least"
Strong sell
"Why don't nobody makes a move on CI. Is it not cheap enough or still too early.? I don't wait, I buy now."
CI is expensive. check IMUX breaking big after upgrade by analyst
Going to go high tomorrow
CI should buy Fitbit.
"lol, this #$%$ will never get thru congress....just more grandstanding and option exp and end of month"
it's on the jump area
somebody of some stature needs to come in and say yea we just bought 1mil shares at $165.
going up to 220 soon
Some serious day trading going on here today.
"When the $165 support level holds, uptrend movement will start later today or tomorrow."
"CIGNA EARNINGS WERE UP 11%, NOT THE FAKE RESULTS POSTED!! CORDANI AND HIS EXECS TOOK OUT HUGE SHORT POSITIONS LAST WEEK, NOT REALIZING THAT BARRON'S WAS GOING TO PUBLISH AN ARTICLE SAYING CIGNA WAS WORTH 156 A SHARE AND 4 ANALYSTS UPGRADES CAUSED A WAVE OF BUYING PRESSURE ON CIGNA AND ALL THE HEALTHCARE STOCKS. BY THE WAY, J.P.MORGAN 'S TOP ANALYSTS SAYS BUY THESE HEALTHCARE STOCKS AND SELL CONSUMER STAPLES. ANYWAYS CIGNA HIT 148.99 A SHARE LAST WEEK, AND CORDANI PANICKED, BECAUSE HE HAD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LOSSES ALONG WITH OTHER EXECS, SO THE DID EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO CAUSE CIGNA TO FALL, LIKE WE ARE GOING TO BACK OUT OF ANTHEM MERGER, PAY 1.2 BILLION FINE, INSTEAD OF COLLECT 1.8 BILLION IN CASH FROM ANTHEM. NO CEO DOES THIS! NONE. THEN HE SAYS WE ARE GOING INTO CHICAGO WHERE ALL OUR COMPETITOR'S ARE PULLING OUT OF... TO SELL POLICIES THAT WILL LOSE MONEY. THEN TODAY ANNOUNCED FAKE EARNINGS, CIGNA IS A STROING BUY , AND ANTM KNOWS THEY WOULD BE A GREAT FIT. WE JUST NEED TO OUST CORDANI AFTER SELLING CIGNA OUT. WHERE'S THE HUGE STOCK BUYBACK FROM CIGNA, WHY DOESNT CIGNA RAISE THEIR DIVIDEND TO SOMETHING RESPECTABLE. THIS COMPANY HAS SALES OF 35 BILLION A YEAR . THIS IS A GIFT TO BUY CIGNA AT THESE PRICES.ANTM WILL PREVAIL IN LAWSUIT"
I’m looking at jumping in on CI. After some research I can’t tell What is bringing the stock price down. Any insight?
"Shame on Cigna management. You don’t invite the devil in, no excuse https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.benefitspro.com/2020/04/07/the-amazon-trap/%3famp=1"
terrible that this is even in a big green day. Value is so dead right now its not even funny. Average target is over $200 and this couldn't stay above $180 to save its life.

Support seen at $140's...
Yea !!! Cleaned up this morning with $187.50 calls !!
its hanging around flatline in a down day... just waiting for a value rally
"I think CI should be the winner after Medical For All dried down since last Dem. debate. The revenue is up this year over 70% because of ESPX. Bottom line is over 30%, and high teens next year. I can't not believe that CI still not fly even PE is around only 9."
"Any clues why CI's stock went down, rather than up? The earnings call is nothing but positive, nothing about it that shouldn't send the stock way up. Their short interest was 1.44%, not particularly high. What's going on with the constant downward pressure on a stock that could be > 200 with all that's going on in that company?"
Just read a piece on the general lack of movement post earnings for many stocks in this earnings season due to numbers being all over the place . Hopefully we get the pop I have expected with Cigna - I have no doubt at all it’ll be a great quarter with excellent guidance . It’s under priced assuming the  doesn’t switch to Medicare for all in 2021 .
Whats going on?
CI reached a 52 Week high at 218.99
"Here we go again, up to high to 169 and change coming, I'll feel slightly optimistic then it will return to 165"
Change the bloody name from OSCAR to something more appealing
"@TJ— Spring is in the air, with a coating of green pollen so thick when you hit it with the leaf blower it looks like a green sandstorm"
Bernie is !
CI should have the great quarter but I don't know that CI will have the same pattern like UNH or not. UNH beats both top and bottom line but going down.
"If Bernie stays on this dumb ""Medicare for All"" track, he's going to make it more easy for Trump to be re-elected. Ha Ha. What a clown this Bernie is. Can't be stupider than this Bernie nut."
Like watching paint dry today . This will move big when the market moves big . That’s pretty much where we are at .
CI is fundamentally cheap. I am a big bull on this name. This is one of just a handful of stocks out there right now that trade on fundamentals. I believe this company will continue its rise over the long haul.
Cigna reached a 52 Week high at 227.25
Kinda excited :)
This is so crazy to me. This is reacting as if Medicare for all has an 80 percent chance of happening. 1 percent chance this happens.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cigna-1q-earnings-snapshot-101337369.html
the merger won't approved.
"someone selling puts to buy calls, bullish spread...just saw the news. Buying out to July"
big buy
CI is up 4.97% to $186.85
Hard not to buy below $200
Trading view shows after hours up 10 and yahoo shows down 5 ?
locked in a bit of profit today... CS price target remains 260 but not sure if thats too optimistic
can we close above 172 today? dollar a day for the next week wouldn't be to bad
should be down 5% or so by morning
Where is the insider buying?
Another awesome day !My favorite trading stock strikes again !
"Well, then!"
F Cigna. Woke gonna wild #$%$
Great time to start or add to position
Hello is anyone out there?
"After Cordani tanked the Anthem deal, I didn't think he could take the company down any lower. Boy, was I wrong! Boy wonder turns to Boy Blunder......"
170 come on
Today marks the third time I’ve caught a big run up on a Friday - big dollars  all three times I’ve missed a few other run ups on Mondays tho
Just when it looked safe to dip your toes .....
Lol @ the joke of a dividend
CI is up 5.28% to 218.87
only a day like 7-11 clean up this mess
Why does this stock even have a divy? Too funny that a stock that trades over $100 has a few penny divy.
This deal is not going to go through.
"From Credit Suisse..........4Q a Penny Ahead of Cons: 4Q18 adjusted EPS of $2.46 came in a pennyahead of consensus. With the company now switching to a new segmentreporting structure, the company’s 4Q18 earnings and guidance foroperational metrics are not necessarily comparable to our estimates andconsensus. 4Q18 revenues (excluding the impact of transitioning clients)grew 29.3% Y/Y to $13.75 bln, reflecting a partial contribution from the ESRXdeal. Integrated Medical segment MLR at 80.9% improved 260 bps Y/Y.Integrated Medical EBIT was up 24% Y/Y to $643 mln. DCPs in IntegratedMedical were 40.7 days, down 2.9 days sequentially, and up 0.6 days Y/Y.■ 2019 EPS Outlook Tracks Expectations, with Potential for Upside asYear Progresses. CI expects its 2019 adjusted revenues to be $131.5-133.5bln. CI’s 2019 EPS outlook of $16.00-$16.50 bracketed our EPS estimate of$16.45. While the guidance was slightly below cons of $16.53, it did notinclude prior year development and was in-line with broader investorexpectations. In-line with its historical practice, Cigna’s 2019 outlook not onlyexcludes PYD but also any future capital deployment. In January 2019, CIrepurchased 1.1 mln shares of common stock for approximately $209 million."
Close at 169 would be nice.
"CI has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. Yo you should really check out https://winningpicks1.blogspot.com/, they seem on point with their stocks."
"I believe that the market makers are working on CI today. Every thing seems to suppress health care sector since they crushed UNH last week. For the long term investors they should have good time to pick the cherry this week. It depends on whether Fed chairman Jay Powell will cut the interest rate by how much. At the high season of the high tech earnings report, if they all come OK, I believe that the health care sector should reverse the trend."
Extreme high volume traded this morning. Something will sure happen today.
Going back up again. Hope lots of shorts were getting in today and holding so they push it back up fast when they have to cover.
Hair cut !!
Down well over $20.00 a share in less than a month. $180 and I am out.
I just pick some calsl for next week this morning. I just can't believe that CI is that cheap. I let you know that CI will beat the estimate by a mile.
Loaded some up at 168.21
This is the video the DNC doesn't want you to see. The DNC has been pressuring YHOO to remove it:The two faces of Obama on Hillary.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVS8-1KwS2c
WHat value does express scripts add.
Update : watching the market I’m seeing energy & healthcare sectors falling out of favor . Internet seems to have stolen the new year . While I still believe Cigna will see an earnings pop - I’m lowering the after ER range to $230-$250
"lets remember that loser Cramer said at 176 this was an absolute buy,,, its 164 now,,,,cramer hosed all you that believe in him"
"Hi Cigna holders! Congrats on being shareholders in one of the hottest stocks over the past five years. I wonder if any of you lucky dogs know WHY your stock has been on fire for so long. Well, I'll tell you. When Obama-care came into being, they allowed the insurance companies to dictate the terms. What ensued was one of the bigger screw-jobs ever implemented on the American public. We all started paying a lot more for a lot less coverage, and WHAT A TRIUMPH FOR CIGNA, UNITED HEALTH CARE AND AETNA! Go ahead and check United and Aetna stock charts. Yep, same thing as Cigna - TO DA MOON! Enjoy the blood money while America gets it in the rectum."
No hope or blind faith as I'm mostly a pessimist but I just have this strange feeling that this is going to take off to 182 to 187 range in next 3 weeks
"The market makers start to accumulate CI again, look at the volatile price of CI goes from positive and then negative. CI should go even higher today. I bet you that there are some big boys put big order for CI, that makes the market makers to short CI in order to get the weak hands to let go the stock."
Holding up reasonably well the last 2 days considering the rest of the healthcare pack .
CI going back up just like I said. technicals were hurting it.
As I said .... it’ll ride up strongly with the general market NOT on its own .
CI may finally run bigly on earnings this week!
"Big move on health care sector. UNH is close to buying point again. I like CI the most because it is so cheap under 180. Don't forget CI's high is 220, so CI has a long run way for tomorrow."
Humana gets the golden goose award today . I should have been on that train instead of MA though I did ok
All insurance companies were down today except CI. I wonder why?Maybe the good earnings is finally sinking in?
Crickets here
This is going back to 200$ slowly. No question about it.
Any news on why Cigna is up 5% today on heavy volume?
"I jumped in today a little while at around $153.45-$153.55, trying to take a quick day trade ride. No way this will stay THIS far down - gonna bounce a little. Even a dead cat bounces."

Hoping this latest venture to $202 is a wall of support.
We need more Lobbyist kickbacks. What is wrong with these guys? Don't they know how Wall Street and Washington work?
rang the register at 202.7.... can't stand the election news anymore... may come back in if drops further or if market corrects.

"MOH and CNC are the most exposed, HUM could benefit The most impactful provisions from repeal would be the repeal of the individual exchanges, and Medicaid expansion. The companies most exposed to those provisions would be MOH (47% of EPS) and CNC at (40%). WCG (8%) and ANTM (6%) also have exposure. Finally, CVS’s Aetna subsidiary, CI, and UNH have limited exposure to the repeal of the ACA, with less than 2% of their earnings derived from ACA-related enrollment. Of note, these numbers are gross exposures, as there would be some offset from the repeal of the Health Insurer Fee (HIF)- 2% on average for diversified names. In fact, after factoring in the offset from the HIF, in our view diversified names would largely have a minimal impact and HUM may actually benefit from a repeal of the ACA given it has minimal ACA revenue and would benefit from a repeal of the HIF.

"I hold this one , $PTN more than any other and nothing in the hand, sold $CI it went to 200's, sold $AXSM went to 100's ."
Market up over 300 points and CI down. No confidence in Executive team by Wall Street. No shareholder value with terrible dividend. Too much operational redundancy between CI and Express Scripts. Very unfortunate.Am I missing anything?
Sold stock and bought puts.....went up way too fast. No way this continues up from $160 to $220? In ONLY 8 DAYS? Not gonna hang here for very long before it goes back down to test.
managed care is getting smoked... why?
getting 6+B in cash! Nice !
"good report ,still down for two days"
Dropping quickly from the morning high. No end to pathetic !!
This will be back in the 180s within a few weeks. It’s at the bottom of the channel it’s been in lately. After that who knows when it will retest 200s.
"Some big boys want to buy CI real cheap. The market makers is doing the work, keep suppressing CI down even though there is no news on CI. I just keep an eye on it, let's see CNC reports earnings tomorrow first. I think it is a good stock to bet on this year. PE is under 12, which I think it is too cheap."
here we go through that magic 170 mark... next step will be can it close above 170.
"I have to admit, today hurts"
CI reached a 52 Week high at 209.44
"Look this is a no brained, with express scripts it can’t lose."
Who can buy CI this morning when it was down 6 points? I am so lucky to pick some at that price. CI will double the revenue Y/Y and earnings will surge because of ESPX. I have no doubt CI will beat the estimate.
"all the big phar, are up"
Are you ready for the roll over? Lock in profits
"Serious question . . . is Cigna run by complete morons, or just half #$%$ morons? It's down nearly 25% since it's 1/22 high."
Earnings beat and raised full year guidance. Very cheap stock - forward PE under 10. Seems this one has a lot more upside.
@cigna walk it’s customers through via Delarosa when they file claims hoping they will eventually give up. @cigna is one of most hated companies both by customers and employees and exactly like Comcast it’s dommed to crash. There is limit to customers’ patience.
With Walmart/Humana speculation (and news articles) Watch...CI.SP rise on Monday to $170K and on it's way to fill the gap to $190. With Amazon vulcherizing Retail...EBITDA is becoming scarce in the vertical and Healthcare in big retail makes total sense...draws customers in and makes them come back in an vertical Amazon can't ship in a box!
Should of sold in the $190’s and moved on. This stock trades with no rhyme or reason. Could be up $5 tomorrow or down $5.
"With the earnings growth over 18 % and dividends 4 bucks, the pig will fly high over 250. Don't believe me, OK? Let wait until this Thursday when UNH reports earnings in early morning, it should pop another 10-15 points, leads the whole sector to another new high. After that, ANTM will confirm at the end of the month. It is the done deal that CI will get the chance to go even higher."
"OK, who let the air out of the balloon?"
Caught the wave Friday and again today .
Opened positions today near the low. Expect a small bounce tomorrow
double top... don't look good technically especially if yhe whole market takes a dump
How will Kamala Harris pick affect CI and UNH...?
"I can only smile, not ones twice a drop in a glory day"
broke support... not good
This should be up a LOT more than it is - and I’m not sure why it is fading as day goes along.
"170... haven't seen that in a few weeks. negative news today. earnings in 3 weeks, hope it's institution in the know early buys"
Well. this is certainly a revolting development.
And again !! 
why did this stock drop so hard today?
"If CI gets a multiple comparable to UNH, ANTM, HUM, stock price is over $230."
"I have an unrivaled disdain for Zacks, but did find something interesting in their release this morning: “CIGNA intends to serve 50% of Medicare eligibles by 2025”.This would be through their ever expanding Medicare Advantage Med D initiatives.Incredible opportunity to boost revenue"
"JUST HOLD YOUR BREATHE, this stock will hit 175-178 by tomorrow when ANTM reports earnings tomorrow morning. On Oct 31, 6:00 am. CI will light up July 4th , FIREWORK. I see 185-195."
"Good job, Cordani! Keep it up......"
Tanking huge this morning - why???
"For whatever reason this went down below 200 after earnings before fighting its way back up. The earnings were good. then on bloody friday it only loses .55 cents.. Im in and the selloff on fear about Amazon, Berkshire and Chase looking into healthcare is overblown. This will be back to 220+ where it was in less than 2 weeks.."
"Cigna is one of the 10th most hated companies in America. Still think it’s a good investment? =========""[T]he most evil corporation on earth""?That might be a *tad* hyperbolic.America's Most Hated Companies (USA Today, 2/1/18)1) Equifax2) Fox Ent.3) NFL4) Univ. of Phoenix5) EA6) Foxconn7) Sprint8) Vice Media9) Spirit Airlines10) Cigna11) Wells Fargo12) Trump Org."
"JESUS! Even if Warren is up in the polls, no way they do it without private carriers...this makes no sense."
Fools selling when this can go to $220 easily. Hold on longs
dis we see the low at 160?
And yet it falls again........nothing short of a 
"When this stops dropping, I’m going to back up the truck!"
No end to embarrassing when it comes to this pathetic company. CEO is a joke and the Board is weak. Joke of Wall Street !!
Trump admin plan to force healthcare professionals and insurers to disclose contracted rates. Insurance companies’ stocks go up? Seems counterintuitive but the money manager obviously like it lol
What the hey happened in the last half hour of trading—-?
Cigna’s results and guidance were better than Humana’s ( which were arguably great too) but we’ve yet to see these two stocks react fully to the guidance .
Boy Howdy!
its about the pbm its a criminal enterprise
Nice move up today !! This stock is still greatly undervalued !!
"Just buy undervalue stock like CI. It is not smart to buy high valuation stock at this environment, and CI is the best candidate because ESPX will lift CI higher next week."
"@cigna is forcing its customers to go through via Delarosa when they file claims hoping they will eventually give up. I had several conversations with representatives and they told me it’s the policy of the company. No wonder @cigna is one of most hated companies by both customers and employees and doomed to go down, just like Comcast"
"Go baby, go!"
And the fall continues.
"Decent set of results, easily beating estimates"
"Amazon entering into the PBM space is causing this knee-jerk price reversal. If you read the fine print, CIGNA is administering the “pharmacist available 24/7” part of the program, and should snap back green once someone realizes this"
Buy WTW IS GOING UP
Who's buying now.
"Man upside of 15%, 200 target... Easy money. Buy Buy Buy"
Bernie blabbering as usual
Pathetic DOG continues !!!!
180 by the end of week
Carl wants CI investors to stop their long term growth plans for the combing of CI and ESRX so that he might take a short term gain on his newly acquired CI holding. This is really pathetic.
Who thinks Cigna $CI is fair value right now? https://simplywall.st/NYSE:CI/cigna
"And just like that, for no particular reason, the company was worth 30% less than it was on Monday."
It is trading at only 12 times estimated 2018 earningsIt can run up to $200 per share in the next few months I am buyer
Had to get in at this level. Can’t see much more of a downside with the latest earnings report as well as the P/E ratio.
Dow up 400 pts. This dog DOWN again. No end to pathetic !!!!
Cigna has now backfilled Monday’s gap up - consolidated base - ready to run again !!
Free fall...wheres the bottom? RSI is 19!
"Just found out Oscar Health, who Cigna just tied up with, just raised 225m. Total dumb move not buying them before."
"Medicare for all????? Who is gonna pay for it? No one, and that is why it is toast. Back to $200 soon"
CI reached a new All Time High at 220.31
No China here...and no acts of Congress either! Where you at??
CI is trading on its own and don't followed the overall markets because it is in oversold condition.
Hang on and add more if you can afford. Only reason for this drop is fear. Nothing company related.
next stop 170+
It just recovered most of its losses from last week non-sense drop!
looks like breaking out !
Accidentally deleted my post of last night while re reading it . Egg on face time . Will see what CC sounds like .
Well this is the only hmo that’s breaking out. Weird since this stock isn’t anything special
"Stuck between 170 and 220 for past 3 years, ridiculous"
"First time user in this web site. Did the Cigna and Express Scripts merger payout to existing ESI shareholders? The IRS reported a 1099-B from Cigna with income. But, I don't know any ESI stock. Thanks!"
So 20K shares this morning takes the sp down $3.00What’s that about?
No end to the disgrace when it comes to this pathetic company. CEO and Board should be in a prison cell. The CEO should be shown the door immediately for the massive amount of shareholder destruction!!
"Ok , the bottom is is. Up from here."
Down 4 points on 74K shares... that makes sense—not.
Will buy back on a bad day! Glta
"Mostly the machine works today, this is the reason CI is down 5 %, health care sector is dumped with the tech. Buy I still believe that health care sector is the best, get impact from the virus very little.We will see how low CI can go this week. I believe it is set up work by some hedge funds that want to buy CI at discount price."
"Unbelievable for CI this morning, It can not move up over 200, even though its peers going up like crazy. UNH, ANTM, and HUM keep going up even though the index is down. I will not let go if CI don't touch 205."
the waiting is the hardest part https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ruling-anthem-cigna-merger-won-213000768.html
"Thanks all the market makers today to pull down CI over 1.70 points this morning, let me make some bucks."
"Beware of the LTD LIfe Insurance transaction with New York Life. Its small but they need the cash for stock repurchase. I am a seasoned executive of 20 plus years. After 2 years of LTD coverage by Cigna for brain trauma from a vehicle accident, my claim was denied in December 2019. My claim has documents from top neurologists, Neuro Ophthalmologists, A Cigna ordered IME in 2019 that fully supported my claim. SSA assessment fully supporting my claim. A brain MRI measuring the damage. A claim manager systematically removed all medical documents through multiple fraudulent activities. Then stated that Cigna didn't understand my condition so I am denied. (can't make this stuff up) I sent a letter to the ethics team and to the CEO. I received a response that they would investigate and get back to me by Feb. 10th. Didn't happen. I have been working on the appeal and have worked through 1200 pages of documents. What I found: Dr. Teitel found no impairments of cognition, sight, hearing. This Cigna Doctor had a Neuro Ophthalmology report showing visual processing damage from the Mayo Clinic in his hands. The date of the document: December 2019. My case is valued at approximately $1.5 million if I don't recover. The denial: December 2019. The assessed value for the transaction with New York Life: December 2019. The implications could be huge. I am just one claimant. How many other high value claims were denied using various methods that are at best, not aligned with Insurance Law and the Regulatory Settlement? The way my file was handled makes Jeffrey Skilling look like a good honest businessman. I cannot say if there is debt hidden for the upcoming transaction, I will say that statistically, if I am the only claimant of high value that was denied using an evaluation by a clerk of my medical records, it would be an anomaly that will rank in the top 10 all time. I know most here are looking to buy or sell Cigna stock and hopefully watch the stock price climb. I wish you the best. I use United Health Care for all other medical. They operate with integrity, have never attempted to fraudulently deny a procedure, and never overcharge. UHC crushes Cigna in revenue, profit and flow through. Cigna is no threat to them. My projection is that Cigna will collapse without leaders who value integrity. A solid audit of Cigna's projections, debt, processes, etc has the possibility of bringing the company to its knees at any time. My stock purchase money would go to United Health Care. Without question, better leaders, better support team, better training. They have the power to eliminate Cigna or buy them for 1 times revenues after Cigna leadership destroys value. like New York Life just did with the LTD group. One final note: In the last two months Cigna has made the World News for fraudulent or questionable decisions. Making the world news once in a 10 year run for this type of activity is bad. Two stories in two weeks regarding Cigna should be enough to scare any investor away. If there are other LTD claimants out there with similar stories, please share with potential investors."
Who would want to owner of an insurance co. That covers a single payers system. All risk and little upside. Our government will attempt to screw up health insurance once again.
Trade the Amazon Healthcare overreaction and play the reversal. https://medium.com/@easystreetfinance/trade-the-amazon-healthcare-overreaction-522c4f576c8e
"Just few weeks ago CI was trading in $134+We should get back to $145 levels, there is lot of demand for the shares, don't sell at these ridiculous levels folks.Sentiment: Ultra Strong Buy"
"The short term chart looks favorable for CI. It is triangle, around 200+, which I think it should hit the bull eyes by earnings report date. The great part of CI is great growth rate for the next three years with low PE around 10. Health care and biopharma. sector are the only two sector that has bright future. So i think CI is the best candidate, low PE, best growth rate even better than UNH. ROE is among the best. I think CI is the low risk bet in the health care sector."
"A quick sanity check on the “Medicare for All” overhang and why it’s overdone Industry Overview Equity | 01 March 2019 10 reasons why MFA has little chance of passing On Tuesday, Congress released a “Medicare for All” proposal that would completely replace the current managed care model by moving everyone to the traditional Medicare program. Although this has hurt multiples for the managed care sector, we essentially see this as an issue of headline risk with very little chance of implementation. We do expect Democrats to work towards coverage expansion, but a more likely scenario is shoring up the ACA (a clear positive for healthcare). Although we have been highlighting headline risk as the biggest risk for Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) this year, in our view valuations are overly discounting a very low likelihood event (CI is trading at 8.5x 2021 guide). Below we highlight 10 points on the “Medicare for All” (MFA) bill and why we see little chance of the bill being passed in the next 5 years. 1. There are 107 co-sponsors of this bill, underscoring the importance of the issue. However, this is below the 124 people who co-sponsored a similar bill last year. 2. There are few details on how this would work and no details on how it will be funded. Cost has sunk every such provision in the past and we think is likely the biggest roadblock this time. 3. The current Medicare program is expected to go bankrupt in 7 years. This program would cover more things than Medicare – vision, dental, hearing, LT care, have no premiums, copays or deductible and all providers will be in-network. 4. We estimate paying hospitals Medicare rates would bankrupt the industry. The Center for American Progress estimates that hospitals need to be paid 20% more than the Medicare rate and doctors need to be paid 10% more to make those businesses viable – which would make it even more difficult to finance. 5. Few (if any) industries are likely to support this proposal – beyond eliminating MCOs, it would eliminate all for-profit HC providers (hospitals, nursing homes, etc) and Medicare would negotiate drug pricing. We expect significant lobbying against this bill. 6. Simplistic view is that Dems say we don’t need managed care. Factual evidence indicates the government can’t manage utilization and MCOs must play a role. 7. Medicaid MCOs manage 51% of Medicaid spending (vs 26% 10 yrs ago) and save states 10-15% and improve quality. Dem and Republican states have moved to MCOs. 8. Medicare Advantage (MA) covers 35% of seniors (up from 25% 10 yrs ago despite rate cuts) as it is able to provide better benefits than Medicare for the same price. 9. The stars have to align. We think Dems would need to win the Presidency and the Senate (likely a large majority) to pass the bill. The President would need to make “Medicare for All” the key initiative for the agenda. 10. But even that is no guarantee - Trump failed to repeal the ACA despite controlling the House (large majority) and the Senate (52 seats). Obama almost failed to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (a much less aggressive plan) despite controlling the House (large majority) and the Senate (60 seats). What gets the group working? Beats and raises We forecast average annual EPS growth of 14% across the large cap MCOs over the next 3 years, and we see upside for all of them. We expect strong Q1 beats and raises, positive tone at Investor Days and regulatory clarity in May on the rebate rule (likely including a delayed implementation) which should help multiples. CI (top pick), trades at only 8.5x 2021 guidance, despite what we see as multiple levers to drive upside.

"Has any of these talking heads and bloggers really looked at the deal with ExpressScripts? It's not that bad, I think folks are concentrating on the debt - which is actually ""book debt"" and is not owed real money (yet). I think folks have forgotten that Trump had a meeting with these guys last spring. ""Nothing"" came out of that meeting, but shortly thereafter you began to see a flurry of M&A deals, and companies repositioning under a new model. Don't kid yourself folks - last year they got a glimpse of what is coming, and they are all switching to the new model. I suspect that Gaul was divided into three parts, and Cigna is grabbing the third piece. And it will probably be good. Cigna is certainly a bit later to the party, but not the last one. Once the new health care stuff is revealed by the administration, folks will see how smart a move this was - not only for Cigna, but UHC, Amazon, etc."
Great short squeeze article here about CI https://news.squeezereport.com/short-squeeze/cigna-corporation-nyse-ci-short-squeeze/
"If the ANTM + CI deal goes through, Cigna will be trading around $190+, an easy $50 gain per share."
Last thought on CI today: Their earnings are up 8% ttm and there's about 5% less shares in existence than there were a year ago. Mid-February last year their shares were going for around $220. I feel good about where Cigna is right now and my investment.
glad I sold the other day @195. I will buy back if it breaks below $180. Bought last time when it crashed to $172.This is a good company but at this time it is going to get attacked by both sides. Probably starting tonight with the stat of the union speech. Let it drop then jump back in after all the noise goes away like it always does.
"shh don't say anything, they will bring it lower"
pop monday
"Wow simply amazing. Very strong earnings beat, raises outlook and the stock getting creamed. There must be some underlying bad news which I have not heard of at all."
This stock is tanking as if it is going bankrupt! Hard to watch!
What am I missing? To me this earnings report was great and the only reason it is dropping is because it barely missed analysts' predictions. $11.45 net income before reporting the buybacks is a great quarter and almost half the year's earnings. I see this as nothing but a positive but I'm here to listen to opposing perspectives.
Cigna moving higher into new territory . Looking strong .
Praying for 180.00 so I can wash my hands of this DOG !!
Cigna is joining the woke mob. They will come back to destroy this company whose only principle is to enrich itself. Sell the stock before Bernie and AOC nationalize this scam.
Good buy because UNH is still up there.
Rah Rah Rah !!! Go Cigna Go !!Still room To run To $230’s range
"Unconsious Bias ? Inclusive ? Hey Cigna, look at your management. Its 8 white guys, one black, and 1 white woman, and 1 black. Women are over 50% of the country. There are twice as many Latinos as Blacks. DOn't lecture people about bias when your management has 3 out of 11 non white non males, and no Latinos. YOU START WITH THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT, THEN YOU GET YOUR EMPLOYEES IN LINE."
"I have to give them the hand for the market makers that can control the price of CI this morning, because I don't believe that CI will go down to toilet like this in the first 20 minutes. The one that should go down this morning should be AAPL which will have bad earnings for this quarter and next quarter."
thank you Carl
Cramer says its a buy at these levels. So do you Buy 
I love to buy CI when it is in deep red.
Congrats Longs ! You deserved this !
I believe this is the bottom now. Just needs one good push up to break through 167.60 and it will start to retrace it’s losses.
CI reached a 52 Week low at 140.35
Cigna is down 4.95% to 190.99
Such a disappointment
Cigna is down 5.00% to 203.45
Go baby go !!
I wonder if Express Scripts is even worth $6B. LMAO!!!! Bunch of imbeciles.
The are playing and dancing to the limbo song---how low can you go! To low for the investors.
Wow! I didnt think CI would be affected by this (http://webstock.today)
Floor?
Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on CI? if you guys have questions you should ask awesomeSTO-CKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
Told you folks $185 by thanksgiving. This is my most confident recent long purchase. Flawless financials. And WARREN doesn’t have a CHANCE.
i got in and looking for a 180+ breakput within the next week. march 22
This dog continues its downward track....... praying for $180 so I can wash my hands of this horrid company !
Hello
Cigna is down 6.14% to 175.74
"Wow, that bounce did not take long....keep it going and pull ESRX with CI"
When the company gets TOO BIG IT MUST FALL -
I told you 2 days ago
AOC hates this company....until she is gone Cigna it's in  tank
"Mark this post. If you buy CI today you will be very handsomely rewarded. This is truly a over kill. There is noway Medicare for all is going to pass then all these insurance stocks will run. This is truly blood in the streets for these stocks. All had good earnings and good forward guidance. I am not saying it will start a run in the next week, but if you buy this today and put it away in a IRA you make better than 50% in the next couple years."
"Time to buy CI when it is red. Just keep an eye on earnings report of UNH on Jan 15, if UNH has positive report as usual, UNH will lead the whole health care sector up. Then you can double down on CI."
Entered at 158 a month ago; should have sold at 185; pathetic stock
why the sell off?
Board and CEO remains silent as the stock craters.
Looks like resistance @ 165 now.
"Higher highs and higher lows, bottoming phase"
CI is down -6.15% to 182.31
"CI should go up to 177 this morning, which makes me confuse that how they can manage the buy ticket from 177. The volume is huge, let's see a few more hours."
CI would have had an $11 EPS the previous quarter if not for the buybacks. The next quarter their predicted to report an $4.50 EPS. Cigna has not stopped making money this quarter. One thing they did stop was the buybacks. Sooooo.....
Cigna is up 4.94% to 183.47
"cant stay green for one day, this is ridiculous"
"Let me tell you the call 185 option July 19, is worth $ .75, What is going on?"
"Each CI share would be worth at least $180 after the merger, so buying now will fetch you a gain of at least $45 to $50 per share."
"CI is very cheap and undervalue, Express Script and Medco that CI bought it last year are the biggest PBM in the US. PE is under 10 with dividends, I don't know why CI is so cheap. Is that possible that some one may make a move to consolidate by buying CI."
Nothing like owning stock in a company trading at 52 week lows........ and it’s still falling. PATHETIC !!!!!!!
Screaming buy as it dips to $196 and change once again.
"Near support level, time to go UP again"
"Lower lows, lower highs, outperforms the market on down days and under performs the market on up days.Heads should be rolling."
Interesting little spike this morning....
"Hey Jeff Saik, y’all out there?"
Warren doesn’t have a CHANCE of winning. Ridiculous price here.
$180.00 by Nov.
Waiting on a day where this hold is not EMBARRASSING !!!!
"@Chewdog : I think you once said - what a difference a week makes . Boy doesn’t it ! Looking at the other two big players that I watch ( Humana & United Health ) to gain some context - the sector now appears to be moving higher -together - with 2 of the 3 hitting fresh 52 week highs for the week , Humana trailing by only a small handful of points .Cigna has reached my initial target of $260 however fundamentals have turned more positive as well as the overall market .Guessing here that the entire sector moves 10% higher in the short term if the market stays green . That puts Cigna at $280-$290 . My revised target price is $300-$320 . Cigna has more ground to cover than the other two I watch as it’s stock price has been depressed . Could Cigna do a stock split ? A thought . The last one was in 2007 . But splits aren’t as popular now with BOD’s . I do think it would help the stock price if one were declared - but let’s not hold our breath waiting for it .Given the above .... I purchased a tranche of Cigna $262.50 calls before the close on Friday . It’s a simple gamble on Cigna as well as the rest of the group - moving 5-10% higher in the short term ."
A Screaming buy .
This is the worst stock to own that has great earnings. UNREAL!
TJ you done broke the spell...
donde estoy los dividendos?
The market makers put the birth control on CI. How the premarket 177 cut down to 172 in less than hour and half.
"Best buy among the health care providers, I love to buy CI today because I know it will have the best earnings among the peers. It is help by Express Script."
back in the green. Let's go!
How can ci go up and down so much in one day? wow! is every thing corrupt.
So frustrating
CI is up 4.90% to 191.91
Bounced off the low so I’m hopeful
Jump in while the train moving slower.
Cigna is up 5.73% to 192.00
When will people realize that employer provider insurance is better than government involvement?
Now Cigna deal will go through easily as Aetna terminated Humana acquisition merger deal. With Cigna and Anthem merger we will still have 4 health care providers.
they're going to be sorry they bought that pbm
Everything else being equal - this presently has a current PE of around 9 . That’s low making this cheap by way of earnings .
Health care employees are getting infected. What is going on?
Cigna is up 4.91% to 175.17
Green or red today?
"Embarrassing, CEO should be kicked to the curb !!"
Calm before the storm?
Well here we are . Again . Will this break out to new 52 week highs tomorrow or crash like a meteor ? Or not move at all on ER . Very hard to tell with this stocks ER history and with the market currently shrugging off some blockbuster results with a yawn .
Cigna is down 5.06% to 187.76
I said $185 by EOY only 1 month ago! Might have to revise that upward. I’m back to even and ready for MORE GREEN. Drop was all driven by Warren and socialism fear. Now the street is realizing she has NO SHOT against our prez. #KAGA
I'm getting dizzy
"CI is still undervalue at this price. Net earnings for this year is around $16 and up. ESPX helps CI big time for PBM, It is the biggest PBM in the world. Let's see when CI starts to cut the debt down next year after putting ESPX in line and run EXPX in the medical advantage. CI puts money in CHINA too which i believe it should work great for the next two years. I invest to see instant success not HOPE."
when will shorts start covering in at 170 and can't even average out anymore fml
Up 5 bucks on 19K shares—-this is looking good going into earnings
talking
Ci partnering with Veterans Administration.
CI is down 6.14% to 175.74
where are the short sellers on this stock!
Cigna is no less evil than Modesto or Comcast. The CEO knows everyone is checking if he’s buying and generating an hype.
"I think if it drops enough,it’s going to be one of the best buying opportunities ever. This is just an opportunity."
"Unbelievable for me that CI drops like a rock in the morning. At this moment, health care sector is the best sector and undervalue. Holy cow that CI has EXPX just last year and revenue will double this quarter can be trashed like this. I will keep buying UNH, CI, and CNC when they are in deep red."
CI can easily afford to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.01 to $0.40.
"Icahn didn’t want the merger to go through so Cigna would get bought out by Amazon and his share in Amazon would increase. Cigna is now likely too difficult to buy out so Amazon is building ground up with Pill Pack and other vertical integrations into healthcare. Cigna will drive more revenue with Express Scripts but they could have bought it for less with more patience. Cordani panicked because he didn’t want to be the next healthcare giant CEO bought out. Swedish was going to can him immediately if the Anthem merger went through, and he wasn’t waiting for another CEO to take his lunch."
Is it time to buy now?
this stock
"I add some more of call Nov1, call 175, because I have confidence that CI will beat the estimate. I guess Jay Powell will cut the rate in order to hold the business to keep cranking."
Earnings due out on 2/6 will blow the top off this thing.IMO $220 is not out of the question
here comes the tank... never fails this thing as zero momentum.
"This would be funny if it wasn't so sad. First, CI is a pretty well company, look at the chart's history. Pretty steady rise. You may think Cordani is a fool and arrogant, but the chart speaks for itself. Prolly the same guys that call Trump a fool too. I don't care, he getting results. The nay-sayers say the stock price dropped because they announced the ESRX deal. Now they're saying it drops because the deal is going to be reviewed and may be shot down. You can't have it both ways! Whose the fool here?The reality is the ESRX deal is a must going forward. It's the new model. Yes, CI is late to the game - but the deal is not that bad. It can be good even. Cordani doesn't just throw a deal now - this deal has been studied, analyzed, and the numbers ran every which way. In the end, not Cordani, but the board wants to move forward after looking at the risk/reward. I don't think EVERYBODY on the board, all the accountants, lawyers, etc. are stupid. They know some we don't - prolly a lot. And remember they had private meetings with the WH that nobody knws what was said or agreed to. You have to believe they know something that makes this deal attractive.That being said, for whatevbThe nayserW"
>Bernie Sanders is boiling mad over health care insurance companies that he wants to eliminate as just another middlemen cost.
"Don't let the market makers scare you, CI should be a big winner by Aug 1."
Can I get a yeee-ha! Worth the wait!
The shorts are running for the exit. Tomorrow morning by 6:30 am. CI will open the champagne for every body. I see CI over 195 because the LONGs particularly LEON WILL SQUEEZE THE SHORTS early in the morning.
It’s was only going down because of technicals vs result. A reversal up is going to happen soon.
$66.00 off the 52 week high. Pathetic.... embarrassing !!
"Market makers on this stock suck big dooky, Talk about manipulation. wow"
Cigna just needs the market to nudge up 10-20-% to be back in the $220’s . The Company is doing everything right
Folks you are looking at a gift here. Do not pass it up!
Wow...thanks for the gift today. I'm jumping in tomorrow after market reacts to the 8:30 jobs report. Only one price target cut from what I could tell. From $228 to $210 at CFRA. Great one year upside from here.
Healthcare is still struggling imo
Anyone have an explanation for this?
"this is stupid, just pathetic"
"Rather than #$%$ and moaning, One should recognize a buying opportunity or an adding shares opportunity when it arises. Right here right now."
"Some big boys bought over 1 million shares at the close, pushing the price up over 2 points."
$5 swing range today. A savvy day trader could have made 6-7% on CI today.
Who sold @ $186? It's a $200 stock....
"If Joe Biden wins and I hope and pray he gets no where near the White House, managed care firms will benefit. I own Cigna , but in my wildest dreams never would vote for the demented man in the basement, so I guess I will be a winner when Trump wins and offset any loss in Cigna by being grateful Americans were smart enough to not elect this pitiful basement dweller who hides out because he makes so many gaffes and even liberal reporters with canned questions and ear plugs with messages cannot help him."
Somebody knows something!
Wow what a joke. Manipulation ar its best.
"if it hits the pre-market high in regular trading today, I will sell half my position and pocket a nice chunk of change at $10 a share. Will cover half of my new boat. :)"
looks like breaking out
"Why do they even bother with a dividend... really, one fith of one tenth of a point... I got in this from ESRX, did well on that, but a profit margin of less than 2%..."
Well not today
"To any former ESRX shareholders: have you received your funds and new CI shares yet? If so, when did you receive the. Thanks."
TEVA rebounding from 52wk low today. Breaking into 14’s now! Get in while you can!
"Watch CI to go up over 180 tomorrow morning because of the earnings beat the estimate. I don't need to be Einstein, CI gets help with the tax rate reduction, and help from ESPX to bring the revenue and windfall profit in. CI will be the health care stock that is cheap in ESP and revenue growth double."
"It really gets me how this is such a big deal for Cigna and ESRX. but the media is saying ""What it means for Amazon. I am sick of hearing Amazon crammed down the throats of people every single day. Amazon is a cancer."
Warren and Sanders are going after the health insurance profits.
2020 PE range of 8 to 9 . Cheap .
The ER and guidance is outstanding . As a business Cigna is running on all cylinders . Forward PE is around 7x earnings . Fully valued this should be well over $200 no question about it . Buy & hold a good bet here .Trading it is much tougher .
"Cigna needs a plan to consolidate resources with Express Scripts. Unfortunately, the two companies still operate as independent entities. Until this happens the stock price with continue to flounder."
This “CI” stinks.
"could it be, finally a rebound... will it be sustained? I hope so. this is easily worth 180"
"Why is CI so undervalued comparing to UNH, HUM or ANTM?"
CI is down 7.66% to 131.21
At $208 a forward PE of 10.4 and a dividend yield of 1.92% .
I am almost gonna trade stocks without options. This is plain manipulation of options
Thank the Dems and Bernie Sanders. Think managed care is on hold till this shakes out. If Dems nominate a radical liberal then it gets ugly IMO.
this is dead meat
TO THE NON-BELIEVERS. CI will hit 180 and beyond on the Oct 31. ESPX has really great year which makes CI look like the great stock of the year in health care sector.
Kill this deal
this thing is trading like a dog with fleas... US market is pretty f-ked up only FAANGs and EV makers go up these days... every value rally dies in 2 trading days max.
Please exercise great caution with Cigna as it has dropped under the range it’s traded in for over a month . Operationally it’s going great but the stock is not following suit .
CI is down -5.57% to 211.43
"lol, this is going back above $176 quickly...is cramer really pumping it? If so, then it is good for a few dollars up to like $176"
Ouch
"I like CI at this price, I don't know what happens to the health care providers sale off. UNH will report the earnings on Wednesday morning which I expect UNH will beat the estimate as usual. I think it is the cheapest among DOW at this price."
about
Only Cigna can go from a 5 day high to a 5 day low in less than 24 hours .
I would now surmise that we will see no more meaningful moves here until ER
"IRS Form 8937 related to the ""Cigna - Express Scripts Transaction"" is available on the Cigna website under, Investor Relations, Financial Releases and Filings. Link: https://www.cigna.com/about-us/investors/"
What about the opportunity cost? I took some loss and invested in banking and airline stocks a couple weeks ago.
good fn earnings report don't matter anymore
I saw this I 164 and knew just knew I even had the 11/3 167.5 call in September ended up selling for good profit but I checked that td the same contract is going for almost 500% more than what I bought it at #sadtraderhours
"$167.5 is resistance....single, if we get through that then we are in the clear."
What’s going on with this? I can’t even find any news.. that maybe contributing to this
who the heck is selling today?
At least there short squeeze on BA ZM MNRA today :)
"Holy Jumping, you know who!Blew right past 206 !"
"wait for the upside analyst upgrades, could be in the $260 share price target easily"
"start the bull run at July, always"
Cigna is bad investment from really simple reason: its customers - me included- hate it (read US Today “Most Hated Companies In US 2019”) As well it’s employees who has also their management and especially their CEO who paid millions while they struggle for each penny.
what happened?!!!!!!
Yay! Nice Xmas present trade. $4-$5 share on 1500 shares. Ho Ho Ho.
Cigna is down 7.43% to 181.00
cigna loses 1.8b fee bid from anthem... Delaware Supreme Court... probably not a surprise. may move the stock
If we see Humana turn out a strong beat on its ER Nov 6 I’d think it’ll lift the entire sector 5-8% . It’s way undervalued and oversold . Upgrades galore .
"Look at the bright side. The stock is now down 23% in 40 days, who could ask for more from a CEO."
"@cigna is an evil company, hated by both customers and employees and it’s all documented: check US Today recent “Most hated companies in America@ survey and Glassdoor employees opinions on the CEO (who takes millions of dollars while they get pennies) and the company. Doesn’t sound like a good investment."
"last ER bought this and lost bunch of money, so be careful"
Esrx earns 5 billion a year which is twice what Cigna earns. Doesn’t this make sense for Cigna shareholders to vote yes? Or am I wrong?
FWIW-Earnings blowout coming here to Cigna holders in a week . Locked and loaded .
"MDLIVE—-brilliant move: congrats guys & girls. Could be in response to several things: multiple clients/patients asking about it, maybe a State added the tele-MD as a requirement to conduct business in the particular state, or in response to a very large RFP."
Crazy action today. Day traders making a killing
"Looking for 175-185 on Oct 31. PE is around 10 right now. The EARNINGS IS AROUND $17 for 2019. I believe that US economy will slow down next year because of the slow down global economy. We will have to find the bunker because the index nears new high. You miss estimate, they drag you out and shoot, no question ask. The health care providers are still around 20% of the high, that i have to scratch my head."
this has got to be the worst stock to hold from an investor's perspective. No leadership at all......
Worst experience so far.. I don’t know why this can’t get up with all the solid credentials under the belt
does anyone know why ci is dropping today
Every time I add to my position goes down not adding anymore so it’s safe to buy
Very confident in this one. $185ish by end of year. Trump impeachment ain’t happening FOOLS and he will be re-elected bigly
"Big money is now pushing the stock. Level 2 is zooming, we are at twice the volume of yesterday at this time and moving up...very good sign."
I sold mine @185.30 and good luck to all. Bought @176.CI is good!!!
"Funny thing the reason why all the health care providers tank today because ABMD's disappoint earnings which has nothing to do with the big health care providers like UNH, ANTM and CI at all. I just don't believe all the news come out."
"earnings growth is 25%, PE is only 10. I think when the market gets better today, CI will move up higher."
$CI RBC boosts target to $304www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/rbc-capital-raises-the-target-on-cigna-corporationcinye-to-304-from-265/
"Sorry but Cordani is a self driven fool that the BOD has followed and negated its responsibilities to the shareholders letting this fool dictate the direction of the company. He personally drove away the ANTM deal because he would lose power. He's all in here as he will be the CEO of the combined entity. Express loses 30% of its business in 2020 from ANTM yet this fool is paying a 36% premium for it and assumes 15B in debt! He claims immediate accretion at a time when PBM's are being assailed for their pricing practices and are being targeted by state attorney generals. Faber hit it on the head, telling Cordani the market doesn't agree with his thesis that the combined company will be accretive as the stock at the time was down 6% which is now 10%. Cordani response, I don't care about the stock price I know it will be accretive. In other words screw the shareholders I'm the king. His assertion that in 18 - 24 months the company will have eliminated most of the debt is at best absurd. We'll see what Moody has to say when the process their review of the company debt and their subsequent rating which will impact borrowing costs. When CVS bought AET their stock dropped a whopping 4.5% and their current debt load is huge compared to CI's even after the purchase which goes to show what the market really thinks about this deal. I own 1k shares of this company and I'm not a happy camper with Cordani and I don't like seeing my investment falling 23% from the high while the idiot at the top is seeing his salary and options increasing for steering the company recklessly."
"Just buy the health care stocks that has low PE like CNC which has EPG under 1.00, The candidate for next week will be CI, which has EPG under 1.00. ESPX will help CI fly to 200. The revenue growth is over 100 %, and the earnings growth will decimate the PE down under 10. So I think it is the best stock that I like to bet for next week. I will get the tail wind from the Fed Jay Powell, who may have to do something in order to stop the slow down economy in the second half of this year."
206 is the number we have to overcome. It is the price at the time of the ESRX acquisition. Any price below 206 doesn’t show the tremendous value Express brought to Cigna
@Chewdog - Really cleaned up today . $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
So which hedge fund is trying to manipulate the stock today. Any guesses
CI is down 7.44% to 143.55
Why won't my messages show?
"Big Gaining NASDAQ, NYSE, & OTCMarket Alerts ---> www.PennyStock101.org"
CI is down 7.43% to 181.00
"I keep buying morE CI and ANTM because I bet that ANTM will beat estimate earnings. Don't forget ANTM number TWO after UNH, and CI is number Three in rank, but CI just bought ESPX last Dec, ESPX help CI beat the earnings last quarter, and CEO came out to explain his plan, one of them CI put health care in China. It will be great for this quarter for sure because CEO both UNH and CI came out to push the stock since July."
Looks like $150's soon...
Cigna is up 6.13% to 195.16
Zacks—-please go away!
$160's soon
CI is down 4.97% to 206.39
Dang what a run !
Selling off prior to earnings ??? Ummmmmm
deep cleaning made for stop lost's
"Cigna is a great company, if you are a long - do not sell at least until end of 2022"
"QUESTION: WHY DOES CVS CONTINUE TO UNDER-PERFORM ITS PEERS WHENEVER THERE IS APPLICABLE, POSITIVE NEWS: Yesterday, three entities were the prime beneficiaries of the rebate juxtaposition- UNH, CI and CVS CVS WAS WORSTToday, look for UNH and CI to move up some more based on RSI BUT CVS TO BEGIN IT'S FOUR YEAR PATTERN OF ""GIVING ALL IT GAINED BACK, MORE AND FASTER."""
"More and more unpredictable, so many more better places to invest..."
Carl Icahn is no saint but he is a sharp businessman and he has this deal pegged right. Don’t think that Cigna can deliver additional volume to pharmaceutical companies and this will not give better prices to the hospitals and other facilities. Cigna will loose customers as their competitors would switch as soon as they can ( Carl is right). I ran a Group Purchasing organization so I understand where he is coming from. The new kid on the block in this business ( Amazon) must be happy at the foolishness of Cigna.
"So as a small investor in CI, am I hoping for the merger to go through or does it benefit CI if it falls through. I sold ESRX @ $82"
I just keep buying CI when UNH and ANTM are in green.

Bottom to this free fall...
Dang what a snap back today !
Lawsuit is dead with the Obama appointed judge taking over while the Bush appointed judge takes the Aetna case. Had he decided the reverse the lawsuit would have prevailed. ANTH might as well pack up and go home fight another day.
We could easily see $205-$210 tomorrow with a blowout ER .
This stock is still undervalued however it’s definitely taking a pause .
Toxic...
LOUSY EARNINGS - SELL!
yes we didcan't understand this sucker
now
let's go $$200 plusss
Now this is an interesting development. Should I buy in again and take the ride once more?
Cigna is down 6.17% to 190.88
CI is down 16.40% to 150.37
"Great strategy continuing to expand into Medicare Advantage markets. Big money there if you price the plans correctly. Cigna will draw from the huge Express Scripts talent pool for excellent client service and i dare say, excluding a black swan event we could be looking at $260 next quarter."
"If there’s anyway Cigna expect to add more gains, it is precisely making an acquisition like this. Vertical integration is the only way to grow now. Especially in healthcare/insurance sector."
Good time to buy CI when it is red. I can't believe that CI will be in red before earnings report. The mutual funds all gang up in health care sector for the last two weeks.
CI is up 4.91% to 203.88
down on a value rotation rally day... its tough to be a value investor.
I bought a few shares at $173 and have set a limit sell at $220. Should I keep the limit sell price or wait for it to keep going up?
"Yesterday after the earnings perfect chance to buy first time, I am very happy to be on this board!"
since June this underperformed UNH and HUM by 20%... wondering why...
I am all in today @176 - love to see CI does like AMZN and TSLA today
Way too cheap bought a lot
Great buying opportunity. Joe Biden will be the Dem nominee and he is NOT doing Medicare 4 All.
People are crazy or robots trading but the DOJ is not the US supreme court. Until 9 justices take on ACA then can rule constitutional or not. DOJ is part of executive branch not judicial

"I heard CNBC's bozos talking about relocate to the value stocks, I don't know CI that has PE 10 is the value stock or not. The other one, ABBV low PE and dividends over 6%."
Nice move by CIGNA—-putting the pedal to the metal in areas where there are significant opportunities for growth in the MA field. There’s big money (honest money ) to be made in government plans.
I think this is is probably stuck in trading range of 204 to 220 (with 210 median) next catalyst either way is the senate GA run offs. A rep win in either being positive and a Democratic win in both resulting in senate majority would be negative.
When is this gonna take off?
Go go GO baby !!!
$CI Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Buy USD 253 » USD 280 Target Raised by Piper Sandler Overweight USD 234 » USD 236
Cigna is an evil company. The employees hates it. The customers hates it. Do the math.
CI is up 7.17% to 161.49
CI is up 7.99% to 158.96
A good day here . It didn’t escape my notice that we saw a new 52 week high . This May inch up as we approach ER . I think it flies with ER this time .
"From the PR News: for MA plan participants CIGNA will provide free transportation to vaccination sites up to 60 miles each way for 4 visits. Includes an extra adult for those who need help. Another example of CIGNA’s commitment to lower costs and improve clinical outcomes for their MA population. Should be very helpful in your State, eh Jeff?"
This will get hammered once they lose the DOJ investigation for Medicare Advantage fraud.
"I loaded at $116.70, and will add more if it drops further."
"someone sold 1.5 million dollars in put options to buy call options? That is some big monies and that means they are willing to take 500,000 shares of stock if the price goes down. This is obviously a large fund/hedge because that comes out to a 75 million dollar trade and they have to have the monies in the account to be able to make that trade."
"Hey J Saik, what do think about a sale of CGI ?"
"Some big boys drop almost half a billion dollars to load up two million shares of Cigna at the close. They are very aggressive, otherwise the front runners don't push the stock up to 7 points at the close."
Pathetic !!!!!
Expect bigger growth next 2 years.
"lots of news this week. Iowa caucuses followed by an acquitall on wednesday. will this affect earnings. Will bernies momentum rattle the health care sector? Or will trump's acquitall bring new life to the market? Chinas market will finally open tomorrow and they are pumping their market with a boatload of yen. Scary week ahead, nothings for sure"
getting completely wacked... for what?

Leon Cooperman is one of the most respected investors on Wall Street. Only two weeks ago he had CI as one of his top seven value stock holdings. And that's when CI was 227. So even with the miss CI is still a good stock to hold. It's more likely to see 225 then 185.
TIme to step up to the plate. Bought @ $172.22. Over reaction.
"Day 41th of my claim wth @cigna: it took 20+ days to respond to the claim, 8 hours on the phone, multiple email and they claim they got what they need. That was 15 days, the claim is not listed on the website. If you feeling comfortable you’re insured with them, you shouldn’t."

Some are saying that a big investor wants the ESRX deal called off.
JUST BUY IT.
Help me! I’m falling.........
Two year low = way oversold.
sell at this price. democrats will announce new drug price restriction proposal as soon as this week.
"Fake BS Medicare for all is why they are telling people healthcare is down. Bunch of lies. Look at Target prices, some lousy bankers are buying today bet your bottom dollar."
CI has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. have you guys heard of https://myawesomestocks.blogspot.com/. i started receiving their allerts and so far i am happy.
"Don't know a thing about Cigna. Got sucked in when they took over my Express Scripts for cash and stock. So far Fed and NJ tax cost me $20K on the cash and I am down about 20% on the new Cigna stock. Boy, did I get screwed!!!! For followers of this dog is there any legit. support level on the way down?"
same thing happened with anthem. took a few hours before it took off
"Obviously a poor decision and a despicable PR move by not having advised the thought process to the shareholders as to the benefits of the purchase thus resulting in today’s “crash” while insiders recently selling there “butts” off, how about an announcement or investigation? What is the SEC’s position?"
I’m really struggling with trying to fully understand why Cigna is so much more impacted by the weakness in this sector than the other names . Yes the Pharmacy business issues are part of the answer but the Co is none the less outperforming all the rest % wise with revenue and earnings and trading at a much lower PE .
I hope they burn in hell
CI is up 4.93% to 206.57
"CHEAP, UNDERVALUE, and NO-BRAINER STOCK, at this moment. CI with ESPX under the wing, can be second only UNH, which is the top dog in the health care sector. I guess CI which has PE around 11-12 and EPG less than 1, should go higher when it reports earnings on Aug 1."
what's happening to CI? can we sue weiss for the investigation that cause CI/ESRX to drop today?
"upward potential of 219.36. buy everyone, upwards is the only way to go"
2020 can be not a good years for stocks if you look at Bush and Clinton on their second term....
CI is up 6.04% to 174.19
Like I said @ $148. Flawless financials. and Elizabeth Warren WILL NOT be president. Happy I added a few down there. $185 by thanksgiving. We are already halfway there!
Would seem to me that Cigna is dead in the water for now .
this stuff trades like dogsh!t in a hot summer day...
Shorts and day traders will control this stock for a while.
"Just as I thought! ""The CNBC report also said Icahn’s stake was likely less than three million shares or an ownership of one percent or less."" So the multiple media reports about ""sizable stake"" was nothing more than fake news."
Buy Buy Buy !!!
Cigna is up 6.61% to 214.79
CI is down 4.95% to 190.99
I still can't find the news why CI goes up this much.
Amazing how the stock continues to flounder yet no comments from the management. Management and board need to be changed. They've had the heads in the sand long enough.
"Centene is going to pull us down today, but we’ll be back tomorrow"
"By Abinaya Vijayaraghavan(Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) is close to buying pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The terms of the potential deal were not known, but a deal could be announced as soon as Thursday, the newspaper said. http://on.wsj.com/2IdidFs"
CI is down 5.06% to 187.76
"180 is the resistance for this Thursday, if we can break out, we will see 190 as another resistance. By the way the support is 170.I will buy it up to 190 call , Jan 31."
Heading to above 170 today.
Cigna Shares Spike Lower After Axios Publishes Report Titled 'Cigna hit with federal lawsuit alleging Medicare Advantage fraud'
I bought yesterday @176 and hope to see $240
This company is a pathetic disgrace. CEO should be in a prison cell !!!!!!
"Wonder when they flip the switch and the BOT'S start buying? I thought it was around this level...when it bounced, but then it went back down."
"130 by this Friday and $150 by earnings report time. Looks UNH and learn folks, UNH is almost $10 up. CI PE ratio is lower than UNH UnitedHealth Group Incorporated.Don't sell Cigna at these low levels, buy as much as you can, don't miss this blue light sale. Anything below $135 is a steal."
CI should have gone up today. There is no reason/negative news for it to be down. I picked up 2000 shares this morning at $170.62.
"I'm not sure why this is dropping 30% on the release of the merger. Expected drop, sure - but 30% seems a bit excessive. I can find NO combination of math, debt load, earnings, etc. on the negative side that supports THIS MUCH of a drop. Look at the historical chart, I see no real level of support - but I also see more than a year of steady growth. While I think they are overpaying for ExpressScripts, there is some advantage to the debt. Trust me, that will never be paid, they will write it off and reorganize - that is typical what is done. Continued growth in this sector is vertical integration, everyone sees that - that's why all the players have moved, or are moving, to that model. Even if this a poorly negotiated deal, it's not 30% bad. The only supporting math on this indicates more like a maximum of 20% (and that's iffy) after the dust settles. Me thinks the price is being manipulated by institutions."
Smart money are going into beat up stocks.
Do you really think this continues? I bought Puts and will see where this is after the New Year
"Think about this: The market cap at the close of business was $61 billion. Cigna paid $67 billion for Express Scripts. Not only has Cordani lost $6 billion from the merger, he lost all of the market cap from the old Cigna, which was close to $40 billion! Heck of a job David and board. When do the law suits start?"
I loaded up at 209-210. Wish I could undo it.
There's my bounce!
forward pe is around 7... am I missing something?
"I just bot ESRX at $62 in November, and sold it yesterday morning at $85. Can't believe CI is paying such a price for a questionable asset. They talk about cutting prices for the consumer, but that is near impossible when you pay so much on the front end."
Sell sell. Gaps get filled.
And along came Zacks—IMO—-the kiss of death for any stock
Is this company the next GE?
Looks like big gain coming....
CI reached a 52 Week low at 149.00
"It seems the market makers shorts CI for some big boys today. This scene I did see it so many times, at the end of the day, CI will pop back."
How’s the Express Scripts deal looking now ?? Sad
Every body is waiting for Fed. I believe the market is still going up.
Down $18 per share in a couple of weeks. Time to stop these shenanigans!!!
"Ker ap. Now we’ve got Zacks & Motley Fool on our backs. Never a good sign IMO when either one shows up, even with a positive spin"
Who can catch the fish today? CI round trip is over 5 points. It is very fluctuate this morning. I probably have to wait until Fed cuts the rate.
Why going down?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-insiders-pull-trigger-3-202218495.htmlThis insider bought in at $168 . I agree we are squarely in bargain territory here but no idea how long the wait will be for value to be evident .

great healthcare stock to own
IMO this is ready to pop to $190 - just waiting on the move
Hugely undervalued stock here Forward PE of just 8.5
this thing is like a old Ford pickup clunker stuck in the mud... can't even rally when the market pops.
Cigna is down 4.90% to 208.67
why is the price kept diving?
Why call option 185 July 19 premium is so expensive. the market makers asks for $0.45. It is just another two days which I guess it is really hard to go up another 4 points.
:-) Go CI !!
"Use Logic and Common sense that ABMD has nothing to do to the health care providers at all. ABMD has only 8 billion dollars sales. It is an ant compare to the big UNH, ANTM, CI. I HOPE YOU ARE NOT MISLED BY THE MARKET MAKERS."
It's over. This thing could settle in the 80's.
Tomorrow is the moment of truth !
I gave in and sold for profits today. Too big to pass up in a short 2 months of owning it. I’ll look for a pull pack back to jump back in. Good news for all you holders. Usually when I try that it back fires and the price just keeps going up. Lol
why????↧
Has anybody heard of these government subsidies for health insurers?
will this stock ever be worth holding?
JUST BUY IT!. I have no doubt that CI will beat the estimate both top line and bottom line.
This will be the lowest you can purchase (167) it before it starts going back up. Making money the rest of the week on CI. Cheers.
cant catch a break
short this pig till 120!!
Good Move Today
a run to $200 in the cards?
CI is up 4.97% to 159.12
"come on baby, keep up the consistent climbing. little bit each day"
"no feet, keeps falling like its going bankrupt. just stupid"

Wow !!!! If it wasn’t so painful it would be funny.
Even CVS and Walgreens didn’t want Express Scripts. That tells u something.
what's wrong with this stock
does anyone know what would be break out fee for this merger?
i hate universal care
"can anyone tell me , what's wrong with this stock???"
"Well CI coulda, shouda, gone up but it didn't. The only stock I own in the red today. I bought 1K shares in 7/15 and checking my acct it has gone up 13.7% a whopping 4.6% annual gain. Checking the report on ESRX earning:For 2018, adjusted earnings are estimated in the band of $9 to $9.14, significantly below the previous range of $9.27-$9.47 per share. This is because of suspension of share-repurchase program. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently peged at $9.32, which lies significantly above the guidance."
Big ouch . Absolutely got my head handed to me .
Cigna stock price target raised to $250 from $230 at SunTrust RH https://research.tdameritrade.com/grid/public/markets/news/story.asp?docKey=1-SN20191118005160&cid=1-SN20191118005160-MIP
Cigna announces a quarterly dividend . $ 4.00 annually . Didn’t see that coming .
Uninspiring trading today
CI beats estimates good buy
"Earnings didn't matter, it's all about policy risk, a different word for man made disaster..."
Tip-Toe Thru the Tulips—-trader Jeff knows exactly what I’m talking about 
"CI is way over sold. Medicare for ALL is simply not an easy thing to pass and neither is it a viable preferred option from the people who demand quality and reliability in the medical care. Not wait for days, months to get approval on critical procedures and a bureaucratic medicare for all system. Bernie is a nutcase."
I cannot understand how this stock works
2000 more july 165 puts just bought. I guess this thing isn't going rebound anytime soon.
"I was there when Ed Hanway led the stock down to $7 per share, after selling of the pension business to Prudential and using the $7 billion to buy back stock at $55 per share. He basically gave the Pension business away. This dwarfs this by far. Where do they get these guys? Cordani's ego wrote checks his company couldn't cash. Shareholders pay the price. Next year, if the stock goes back to $180, he and his management losers will pat themselves on the back and take stock grants as a reward for having a great year. I live in Vermont and hate Bernie, but maybe he is right, for once....."
QQQ tech section is pulling down the whole market with it. Be patient.
komol i do agree that it is a good time to buy CI. let's make some money!!
"The market makers did the best job to prevent CI running up. I have to give them the big hands today. I see CI up over 2 points premarket, then tank."
CI is up 8.30% to 174.68
Pathetic
for a rare co that reaffirms 2020 guidance this thing is trading so poorly its not even funny... while Nikola haven't made a truck yet has a $20B market cap... #$%$..
"UNH is trading around $145 and CI is trading at $123+, we have an easy $20 gain in next few weeks. Earnings coming out in Nov and CI is going to beat the estimates like UNH or even better. Anything below $135 is a steal imo."
184 coming
One of the most hated companies by customers and more important- by its own employees!!! And the CEO is taking huge check for nothing. It will fall like any other evil company
"Today’s press release on “integrated care” is the perfect storm. It’s been what I have been touting as the benefit from buying Express Scripts:When you have ONE view of the COMPLETE patient; rx’s filled or sometimes more importantly, maintenance meds for high blood pressure etc late to be refilled, or not filled at all, and the complete medical history of the patient, there is no one else better to assess the current condition of the patient. Traditional pharmacies only see pharmacy claims. Doctors only see what THEY ALONE prescribed. CIGNA’s integrated care model brings all this data under one roof, in one place, where sophisticated algorithms and teams of pharmacists and nurses identify patients most likely to have an adverse medical event. These patients or their prescribers are contacted to try and avoid that ‘upcoming adverse event’. Avoiding the cost of even one visit to the ER or even a fall leading to an ER visit with a hip fracture and orthopedic surgery and a protracted recovery in a rehab center is incredible is directly measurable in dollars saved. Take for example, the patient above who falls, goes to ER, hip replacement, extended stay in rehab center (think Covid now)—-> how do you measure the psychological toll this takes on the patient and their families ?This happening to a grandparent can directly impact easily 100 members of their families with worry, days taken off from work, transportation, etc. The psychological costs can never be measured. How do you place a $ value on grief?Disclaimer: I do not work for CIGNA, but do own the stock."
"The hit to managed care stocks based on Democratic plans for 2021 and beyond seems premature.While Democrats are currently favored to win the White House, they'd also have to take control of the Senate to have any hope of passing universal health care. Currently, the PredictIt betting market gives Democrats about 40% odds of winning the Senate. A full-fledged government takeover of health care would surely require at least 60 Senate votes."
Healthcare system worldwide will be in trouble due to costly to treat number of infected patients with coronavirus. Initial cost can be more than $2000 each on the first day of treatment in the hospital
"I lost a bunch after last ER with the hope, I don't have a position now. This stock was my biggest mistake when entering and when exiting."
"after holding this thing for like a month a finally sold for modest gain at 174.23. of course after selling, it's off to the races... good luck all it's probably a great buy now that I'm out"
So much manipulation.

"What’s up with the dividend? I mean, that payout ratio is pathetic."
It will be back up over 170 tomorrow
What a disgrace. The market has spoken and this deal needs to be killed. Cordani will do anything to protect himself and his job.
This has sold off a bit today . I think it’s still due for a nice pop - the timing of which is the question ....
Up $4 today but if we look back over the last week it’s the same range .
"CI is a good bet for next week, the revenue doubles Y/Y, The PE will be under 10 this year. The panic is screaming JUST BUY IT."
"Big mutual finds keep buying CI because it's PE is so low under 10. CI just completes EXPX acquisition on Dec 2018. The number of the revenue and earnings growth already shines since last quarter. It will be even higher this quarter, because ESPX dominates the medicare advantage plan. I am looking for CI going higher 175-180 by November. It is one of the best risk off stock, low PE under 10, Earnings is over $17 this year and revenue growth is over70%."
"I tried to buy after-hours @ $165, so happy it didn't fill."
"Obama spent last three years on Obama care and still didn't do proper homework. Imagine the loss this country had to go through, leave alone the side effects and flaws of Obama care. Obama screwed it big time. On the other hand Obama supported Hillary just to make sure Obamacare is not repealed. Obama didn't even think that Bernie Sanders was much better than Hillary and Trump. Obama was and is more cruel than any other president."
Down on low volume no big deal
Government program membership declined?! What is sales doing?!
If we can’t control the Chinese virus the healthcare sector will collapse so the banking sector
Hope it's going back up to $180 when the news of this bad proposal fades
Such an undervalued stock
"CI is the company up and coming after acquired ESPX. CI has big gun in ESPX which is the biggest PBM last year. When I compare CI to ANTM which has great management but small PBM, so CI has advantage over its competitor and eventually passes ANTM to the second place behind UNH. Ci has better value and low PE which makes it more impress to own the stock in longer term. It is the time for the health care sector to consolidate which I think CI will grow even bigger. The preys are all over such as CNC, WCG, UHS. I think CI will report good earnings numbers as usual. Plus the market makers expect that CI will surprise the market that is why the premium is so expensive, kind of risky. I still bet on CI to beat estimate of Aug 1."
This is really set up to pop big time . Last ER the stock didn’t react with an upward move due to sporadic other news - this time will be different .Huge move Thursday + $10 IMO
"Unless this goes back down, then that was a test of the $164 level for a 2nd time. Bounce on large volume=good, back down is hopefully not gonna happen."
Not another nickel from me scvmbags...hope ur BK in 6 months.
what happened today?
Lets go into the close strong. !
"I buy more call on Oct 31, 170 call because ANTM moves up and down like YO-YO but still up more than 7 points. CI is even better than ANTM in this case."
No end to PATHETIC !!!!!
No end to pathetic !!! Total silence out of the leaders of this company.
Go Cigna go !!
"bullish with a low volume day , is it break out here or not?"
Cigna is down 16.40% to 150.37
Cigna is down 9.19% to 189.80
why this thing trades so poorly compared to other insurers...
CI is ridiculously cheap on many metrics. The entire sector has been down I think due to an expected Dem sweep. Get out and VOTE people. Keep America Great. We must also maintain Senate majority.
"Another good day to buy CI on the dips — they acqusition will be accretive... and more importantly, this co will not be in the cross hairs of any trade war."
"#$%$ stock just so maybe people would listen and you can stop losing money??. Buy some shares in stocks, your just gonna keep on losing your money losers lol"
"CI will beat the estimate by a mile. ESPX will carry CI making at least over $ 4 this quarter. The annual earnings is around $16-17 this year, make itself to be risk-off stock in this sector."
ESRX deal will likely go through and might not be the negative many investors think. CI earnings VERY strong and absence the deal the stock would be $210-225. CI expects ESRX to lead to faster EPS growth not slower. Market worried effort to lower drug costs will hurt ESRX long term. Stock is too cheap relative to other health insurers like AET. Stock should trend up toward 210 over the next few weeks.
Still well below 20% of Credit Swiss target of $215.! Up up again.

I was getting really sick of the market always taking my money so I went out and found a service that gives me one solid stock pick every week. So far they have been awesome. Just go to https://winningstockalertsonline.blogspot.in/ to join. .
Was there ER today !?
"CI has lower PE than AET, Faster growth, lower P/B, etc. No reason it shouldn't sell at parity at worst, which would be $225."
"Cigna is an evil company, hated by both its employees (check Glassdoor) and customers (check US Today, most hated companies in America). Think about for a second"
Always pathetic !!!!!!!!
"It is no brainer stock at this moment. PE is under 10, top line will be 60-80% jump from last year and bottom line is over 30% higher this quarter. I keep buying still at this price."
Who the heck is selling? What more should this company do?
"Well, today is a start."
Touched $180..... now headed back to $160. No end to pathetic!!
Why is this falling when it had a great financial quarter? New business segments growing over 20% and crazily undervalued and away from the their lowest price targets. Doesn't make sense to sell... The upside here is huge.
Two days straight now - can’t cross $265 - even briefly
Not worried about this one. 158 average. Will buy more if she dips to $145. I am in the hole but she will climb out. Flawless financials. And there is zero chance Elizabeth warren will be our prez. Zero point zero. #kaga
esrx a dog with fleas tell your board to rescind
This market mover started a position today! 10 shares!
Bought some today near the low just before close. Hoping for a pop tomorrow
Cigna is one of the 10 most hated companies in America. Think it won’t have impact on its revenue and income ? Go ahead and Invest in it.
NO idea why Cigna is so extraordinary weak today
a bit disappointing but could be a lot worse given market is flat... still hoping for a value rotation...

In the state of the Union address tonight I’m sure he will talk about rebates and drug prices and make it sound terrible for pbms but you have to remember express scripts is no longer around it is CIGNA and they will be eligible for rebates. Just like the rebates and discounts that they get from hospitals. insurance companies will now be able to get those from drug companies as well.
Sell off here is not making any sense. Is this just algos?
7 fold earning
CI is up 8.77% to 141.46
Don’t touch this till it’s below $160
CI is up 11.95% to 179.69
Are there any roadshows planned to make convincing case for this merger or we are in for a perpetual #$%$ stock performance until it is rejected or proven by actual performance?
CI is the cheapest stock in health care sector at this moment. PE at this moment approximate around 10 for this year and will be around 7 next year.
Broke below its trading range . Bodes poorly for the stock and the market .
I hope so !!!!!!
Sold all my positions a month ago around $160 and moved into HUM with a nice profit already. I advise you all to do the same
So trade war news hold after Friday close. What goes up Monday morning?
CI is down -4.94% to 164.28
Doing research on new stocks is getting so hard. That’s why I joined up with this free service that sends one solid stock pick every single week. So far the picks have been great. Just go to the*stock-dork to learn more. .
I think Cigna buys Humana with that cash.
Nice volume
$211 by end of the coming week IMO
CI is up 5.73% to 192.00
Like you said Bill. Could be up or down $5 tomorrow
Any CI bulls out there? We report shortly as whisper numbers for the quarter are looking for an EPS of 3.40 and $11.03 billion in revenue. CEO was bullish on his Cigna’s dealings so far in getting the express scripts deal so far due to close in late 2018 as looking for a top and bottom line beat today shortly. Cigna stock was hammered and now sits near 52 week lows despite earnings growth from a year ago and acquisition growth to occur in 2019. Cigna also raises outlook for FY 2018 last quarter as I expect solid numbers I believe due in less that’s one hour. Go Cigna!!

"Got another example yesterday of corruption in our government, when the Wall Street Journal reported that Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s political action committee donated nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe--the wife of an FBI official who helped oversee the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of state, Hillary lies to the FBI on her servers, she deletes 33,000 emails after she receives a subpoena, a State department senior offical tries to bribe the FBI to declassify some of Hillary's emails, her IT staff takes the 5th amendment rather than tesitfy to Congress on erasing the servers, the pay for play Clinton Foundation, the rigged Deomcratic primaries, and now the FBI has reopened the email investigation. It just goes on and on with the corruption in this election. Sadly today, being politically correct ""trumps"" corruption, fraud and lying with many, especially for those under 40.Here's another example of the hypocrisy of the Press, the Neoliberals and the Democrats. Bubba Clinton stating in 1996 that Americans are rightfully disturbed by the illegal number of Aliens. Why hasn't the Press called this out?FYI, the reason Hillary wants open borders is that aliens typically vote Democratic.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PK-SK0h9o"

"ETF/Index ownership | PositiveETF activity is positive. Over the last month, ETFs holding CI are favorable, with net inflows of $8.49 billion. Additionally, the rate of inflows is increasing."
Obama Care should go self insured or create one entity to compete with insurance companies nationally.
"Momentum wise Cigna is currently weak despite hitting a new 52 week high Thursday .That being said , management has instituted a solid $4.00 dividend and committed to buying back stock & reducing debt to match its peer group .Further , they have the earnings , cash flow and recent $6B cash divesture funds to do exactly that . If there was ever a stock primed to run .... this one is . Political risk and market risk not withstanding ."

$200 easily for sure
Where are the earnings?
Reminder . This stock has been up over $6.00 a share the first two days of the week not surprising to see some folks take a bit off the table as we approach earnings .
"I don't get it. A company making REAL money year after year ($20/sh) and people can't dump it fast enough. Meanwhile, make-believe stocks of companies that earn comparatively a pittance in the ""tech"" sector go up 10-15-20% and more day after day. Frustrating..."
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/health-insurer-cigna-posts-rise-104558144.html
Cigna the most undervalued Health Care stock going into earnings IMO . The late July ER should be worth 20 points up from here at a minimum
Trump may be re-elected because the economy is doing so well - but investors don't care!
C’mon boys let’s see some positive revisions for 5/7 earnings
No one is going to the dentist = no one is using their dental insurance = greater profits
Bernie and his haters really got into this ! When  burger needs medical I hope CI denies his claim
Hope everyone had a good Christmas ! The biggest reason that I believe that Cigna is just starting it’s real move is because of forward earnings . If the Company earns $22 a share in 2020 and holds onto its current P/E ratio it would suggest a stock price well in excess of $300 all other things being equal . Political risk is really the only unknown quantity here and that is arguably a lot smaller than it’s been made out to be .
"Stock is broken now, time to bail out."
That was one heck of a sell off by close!
And .... I’m in .
"I bet you that some news hit the wire this morning, that is the reason why CI pops up. We probably know after the market close. Only thing I know, CI has forward PE under 10, EPG under 1, and revenue growth over 100% this year. CI is undervalue, no question. CI only needs to beat earnings by5 cents, CI will shoot up at least 10 points by Thursday."

"is this thing dead until the next earnings report? Well, i'm ok as long as it stays above 200."
"LOL so far 6 trips below $164, short are keep attacking."
ouch! Hope we don't drop all the way back to $146
How many of you Cramer sheep got lead to slaughter @ $176? Now as usual he will find a way to spin it where he doesn't look so bad.
"so much disappointment, why it is still down, after such a great earnings."
Hoping this goes to 240 before June 19.
"Yes, it’s personal but if it happened to me, a guy who goes by the book it indicates something on Cigna - Cigna is fxxxing it’s customers and fxxxing it’s employees. It’s called “Evil” and the outcome is clear just like Modesto and Comcast- it will fall and fall strong."
CI is up 8.11% to 169.54
I thinks the shorts felt its time to covers before close. The three down days is about to end. Actually today movement isn't that given with overall markets.
Cigna forecasts slow revenue growth for 2019.That is not the headlines you want to see and expect the stock to go up soon. I am not here to bash. I will let you know when I get back in. Last time it was at $172.03
Cashed out today at the very top . I’d love to claim it was skill but it was more divine providence - some might call it dumb luck - extremely happy non the less .
Sam: how come only you and I know this? The sp should be 240
Who upgrade CI today? There is no reason that CI is up over one point in less than 5 minutes. Any company wants CI so badd.

"If Ci does not pop up to 177-180, I expect the market will come down again today..HUM popped up over 18 points yesterday. Let's see how the market makers will line up the buyer's price. I guess the volume will be over 3 million shares today."
"CI has new high every day, but it's PE is still around 11, that means CI is still undervalued among its peers. When HUM reports earnings tomorrow, beat the estimates, it should take the whole sector go higher. CI should in the 190s by Dec."
I cannot see a reason why this company is bleeding value regularly. Nonsense! We should be at 200+
"Thank God the merger included CASH!!! WTH is with this company? This continued push for medicare for all is only going to create a wider divide if some knut tries to implement it. Those of us who can afford it are going to get our own, one way or another."

y the rise tdy tho.
Things have reversed . Cigna & healthcare are now massive buying opps once again .
What a PATHETIC dog !!!!!!!!!!!!!
"20% down in a month, something is wrong here... sad"
Seems like someone is buying them up with high vol. CI has been hitting the wall of 169 too many times. It will shoot above on Monday if not today. IMO.
CI should be the best candidate to break out this time around. ESPX will help CI break all the top and bottom line. Earnings for the whole year will be over $ 15. I think it is cheap and safe in the uncertain situation.
"With earnings on 7/31, this should be flying. IMO earnings will be spectacular and we should touch 210"
Why CI is up so much? Merger is almost dead. It can't be a good thing. Why up after the news?
A lot of Cigna employees will get the shaft in the form of PINK slips if management continues to fight the court for approval with Anthem. Management don't give a damn. They just want their cash payout. A lot of Cigna employees should be worried as your jobs are about to be disappeared.
Anyone -Why did this go down $7.28 today ???
"If we can maintain 220+going into earnings, we’re golden."
"This is one of the very few stocks in my portfolio that truly scares me. Bidencare is unfortunately right around the corner, and the sp should be going up, not down"
My comment on the ER - solid results - management is being very conservative with the estimates on 2021 EPS with their statement about the same . This is poised to hit $300-$320 this year .
This is a great time to jump in Cigna. I did.
"I expect Warren B to start scooping up some shares of this loser. If the price targets are anywhere accurate, there is about a $30 upside coming. May not be for several months, but it will come. WB would make a few billion off purchases down in this area at support (using Dana support post). Shares may not start rising until next week after options expiration. I see at the most $5 by Friday, but would not be surprised to see it stay at $164.xx to close out Friday's puts under $165. Otherwise, it will be near $169 by Friday. Hopefully, it is not $159. Need Dana's $164 support to hold."
Where is the benefit to the shareholders
$169 is a steal. Avg analyst is saying $210. At $175 there is still 20% upside remaining. Buy on dips and buy all the way up to at least $175. Cramer said buy buy when it was around $175 also(even though he is not always correct) but this time we do have a good buy. It will spring back up fast when shorts start covering today.
who wants a stock with a .02% dividend yield this is just stupid
bought in at 176 . Is there still downside ?
"Medicare for all is liberals socialist idea that will never happen, keep buying those brutally beaten stocks. You will be rewarded with hefty gains next year. I am still buying UNH, CI, AMGN, WBA, CVS and others. There is no way you can lose money on healthcare. Those drops are gifts for us."
The market looks very weak. Cashing out of everything today
Today looked like profit taking however after seeing the daily volume pick up I’m not so sure that we may have hit an intermediate high Monday at $205.30 .
