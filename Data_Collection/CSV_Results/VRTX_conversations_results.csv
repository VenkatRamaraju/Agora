Recent headlines and conversations for VRTX
"conservative but confusing guidanceOrkambi sales in the French early access programs are running at an approximate $130 million annual run rate exiting 2016, but are not recognized as sales. Are sales in France included in VRTX sales forecast for 2017? What are the expected sales numbers for Europe?I am afraid the market will react negative on VRTX guidance. Leiden will have a lot to explain."
Tomorrow will be 20% back
As we worry about price drop..some one in ARK is sharpening his sword for the kill. Not a single analyst seem to understand anything of their true value..all dumb questions..
Excellent report explains recent upgrade
this is a rock solid stock
"Beat on earnings, revenue, and raised guidance. Trifecta!"
Beat the street and up the guidance. Will fly tomorrow....
Mr. Buffet...where are you?

the limbo rock--how low can you go?
I hold this and GILD and will continue to do so but just bought a few Novacyte. Authorised hospital testing in France this morning. GLTA
Howdy folks1 anyone got any idea why Vertex is popping today? Cant seem to find any new blockbuster news r anything. Thanks yall
I just bought more Vrtx. I am like George Costanza. I am going down with the ship!
Don't know much about this stock but I've been looking at the charts and clearly this hasn't been this low since around the March crash. Are these levels a good entry point? I need to do some more DD.
Trade and invest VRTX since 1998 until today. This stock is a rare gem. Added 500 more shares and will ride this over $180.
VX 787 to treat influenza A close to FDA approval based on announcement from JNJ today. Will likely be a big seller worldwide since it has significant improvements compared to tamiflu (shows benefit even if started after 48 hrs from onset of symptoms with good safety profile). Milestone and licensing/royalty payments from JNJ to VRTX likely next year if not sooner.
"Just popping in to say Yippee!!! 10 long years, but blessed ones! Dear son is 10.5, started Symdeko just 2.5 months ago, still >100% FEV and no bad bugs. Can't wait to get the triple approved for 6-11 and start on that. Thanks to those longs here who kept me informed and hope-filled over the years!!Fondly, Verity"

"VRTX has about 1.5 years before ARWR destroys them, Mark this post.."
Had my doubts after earnings but i.was wrong.... Go Vertex!!!!
Is this stock a buy at the moment? They have a great balance-sheet!
"these analysts guesses might bring the sp above $200:Jefferies’ Michael Yee has noted the new drug could contribute at least $6 billion in peak sales as it taps into a new population of patients. Evan Seigerman at Credit Suisse noted today:We estimate that Trikafta will allow Vertex to treat an incremental 8,500+ patients across all age groups in the United States (5,000+ immediately addressable ages 12+), contributing >$750M in unadjusted sales in 2020…."

"From Reuters: The outbreak has prompted drugmakers including Pfizer Inc , Eli Lilly and Co and Bristol Myers Squibb to suspend several trials, which could hurt future revenues and limit patient access to experimental treatments.Time to sell."
"Wow, Q2 earnings of $2.61 per share, $0.53 better than consensus of $2.08; revenues rose 62.0% year/year to $1.52 bln vs the $1.39 bln consensus."
Opened position @ 212$ and still not clear why price is so low? Did I buy with 30% discout? How is possible wall street valuate it so low? What is the catch?
"For vertex AATD drug; Liver enzymes levels were up 4x normal limit in the vertex patients and the drug didn't go where it was supposed to. Vertex has a different drug, VX-864, that treats the same disorder but is structurally different than what got axed. JPMorgan analyst says ""the market may discount this next shot on goal; however, 864 is structurally distinct from '814 and many times more potent, potentially offering a more optimal therapeutic window."" Read out for that data in early 2021. Down far enough to start a position imo. 223 is the Fibonacci level of support."

"VRTX owns over 10% of shares of CRISPR Therapuetics. SEC filing 12/21/18 by VRTX confirms additional share purchases by Vertex since original investment in CRSP several years ago. IMO, VRTX doubling it's investment in CRSP, confirms the confidence by VRTX execs in the eventual success of it's gene editing partnership to treat SCA and beta thallasemia with phase 1 clinical trials likely to produce positive proof of concept results later in 2019. At the upcoming JP Morgan health care conference presentation by VRTX in early January, we should learn the timeline for expected results next year."
"Does anyone on this board truly understand what the pending triple means for cf patients and Vertex? This isn’t Kalydeco, Orkambi or Symdeco. Bernie has no chance to be elected yet science does have a chance to finally deliver and the markets will respond."
This is down 10$ in last 2 days! Any thoughts on why?
"New discovery that ATR inhibitors like VX-970 or VX-803 can kill tumor cells by itselfThis is not new to Vertex researchers because they found them expirically, but it is new to learn why these drugs can kill tumor cells.Both the SCIENCE magazine and NATURE REVIEWS CANCER reported yesterday that ATR is the very checkpoint to the gateway leading to the G2 phase (followed by mitosis). So, by inhibiting the checkpoint with VX-970, tumor cells can enter the G2 phase without completing the DNA replication. This has catastrophic consequence because daughter cells would not have a complete set of chromosomes. http://science.sciencemag.org/content/361/6404/806?utm_campaign=toc_sci-mag_2018-08-23&et_rid=16759399&et_cid=2306314When ATR and DRPK inhibitors were licensed to Merck-Germany last year it was thought that they were merely inhibitors of DNA repair inhibitors. Therefore, it was thought that they had to be given with chemo drugs which disrupt DNA synthesis.https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/merck-kgaa-darmstadt-germany-licenses-four-oncology-research-and?ReleaseID=1007605It is true that disrupted DNA synthesis followed by ATR inhibition would accentuate the demise of tumor cells. But the chemo drug may not be necessary if ATR inhibitors were given for a long time."
"Sooooo, peeps. Is this still a good long term hold? Digesting the report, I think we’re good."
"VRTX for big fat guys who pursue 5-10% return each year;For your growth investors, stay away from it!"
waiting for $330. hope to get there before this month ends!
"Kalydeco is an amazing drug. My wife's CF doc was sharing a srory of his 41 yr old patient who recently had to go back to work as his wife had an unexpected pregnancy. For those not familiar, CF can ""gum up the works"" making one impotent. Kalydeco freed up his swimmers, allowing him to become fertile! Oops, I mean congratulations! What a miracle!"
Im in the UK. My niece has CF the Vertex drug has been a game changer!
Thanh God VRTX did not follow the S&P 500 and Nasdaq's movement today. Let's hope it will establish its own trend based on its excellent pipeline and revenue.

Biologics and rational drug design is the future of biotech..... one day Vertex and Regeneron will be the giants of the pharmaceutical industry ~ Ralph said it first

A good day to add more shares prior to the earnings release.
Good news!!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-approves-kalydeco-ivacaftor-first-192900129.html
great swing trading stock?
Ideas about earnings? Anyone?
time to buy.... we will be $300 ....
"My personal opinion is that, if I am correct I do not see any significant news coming from management in the near future. I think investors simply do not anticipate a catalyst to the upside and may be just cashing out for the fear that it may keep going down. The Trump drug price control publicity also is not helping.As I have said before, The BOD should initiate an up to a 10 million share buyback in open markets. Buy backs do not pose any legal issues for the company as long as they stop the buyback when material information becomes available to the company. Examples are new revenue stream agreements, new drug efficacy results, offers to take over the company etc. Also an open market repurchase announcement need not be completed if the PPS becomes too expensive based on below:""1. Open market stock buybackA company buys back its shares directly from the market. The transactions are executed via the company’s brokers. The buyback of shares generally happens over a long period of time as a large number of shares must be bought. At the same time, unlike other methods, stock buybacks via open market do not impose any legal obligations on a company to complete the buyback program.Thus, a company enjoys the flexibility to cancel the stock buyback program at any time. The primary advantage of the open market stock buyback is its cost-effectiveness because a company buys back its shares at the current market price and doesn’t need to pay a premium.""https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/stock-buyback-methods/So no new development pending, and the pps getting hammered most days lately, it seems to me an open market buyback send a message to investors that the BOD and the management have confidence in the company."
Perhaps CRSP should buyout VRTX. Don’t laugh...
One of the top five biotechs in this recession
Earnings leak? Up AH.
on this ahead of earnings? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-approves-kalydeco-ivacaftor-first-123000470.html
Another huge day on the Nasdaq and VRTX lags once again.
200 USD I think is a nice level for a technical entry.. havent read into the fundamentals yet.
I told ya......you idiots just won't listen
"Been a turd, but I think still the best deal in bio. 100 Bln mkt cap in 3 years"
What happened?? No news. Bad earnings leak for tomorrow?? Drug trial failure??
"Down almost 30% from its one year high. I think Leiden and Reshma are too occupied with their so called ""Transformative"" #$%$ and not paying attention to shareholders who are bleeding."
"NACF presentations show sustained long term benefit of both Orkambi and Ivacaftor in treatment groups:Investor conference this evening likely to highlight the clinically significant slowing in loss of lung function especially in 508dd CF Patients ages 12 and older taking orkambi for 2 years compared to those not taking it. Clearly a strong motivator for patients not yet on Orkambi to get started and stick with it until next gen treatments prove to be more effective. Should boost compliance and persistence on treatment as well as motivate new starts in the 2000 US patients who have not yet started treatment. Should also improve pricing negotiation outcomes ongoing in the EU Canada and Australia where approvals for Orkambi payment are ongoing or about to get started. Benefit of Orkambi in 508dd pediatric patients ages 6-11 also reported today in Phase 3 trial results with little initial respiratory adverse effects reported and positive efficacy should promote rapid uptake in the US over the next 2 quarters and Orkambi approval in this younger population in the EU next year. /The significance of this data will likely be highlighted in tonight's conference call, along with the news from yesterday's announcement of the initiation of triple therapy phase 2 clinical trials using second gen correctors in combination with 661 (tezacaftor) and Ivacaftor, offering hope for effective treatment of the underlying cause of CF in the largest remaining and most challenging CF subpopulation (het-min group) still awaiting this kind of treatment."
Wow
"Zacks focus again is on triple combination:""The triple combination regimens represent huge upside potential.""that certainly is true, but again, the short term potential has even more potential:currently about 9.000 patients are treated with Kalydeco or Orkambi29.000 are qualified for treatment with these drugs, label expansion and VX-661 will result in 44.000 patients eligible for VRTX CF products,so the additional short term potential to be added is 35.000 patients (44k minus 9k), or about 4 time the amount of patients currently treated.The triple combination will ""only"" add another 24 k patients.Once the market starts to realize the true potential (not to mention the non-CF-candidates) we will all enjoy a Happy New Year"
Looking forward to ASH annual meeting first week in December when VRTX/CRSP jointly present early Phase 2 clinical trial results demonstrating first patients treated with CTX 001 have a potential cure for Beta Thal and SCA respectively providing proof of concept with both safety and efficacy.

"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.: Reaction to competitor PTI data overdone; triple combination data published in NEJM10/19/2018 4:05 AMCompetitor PTI provided updates from doublet regimen in homozygous F508del patients; we believe reaction to VRTX is overdone. While 8% of FEV1 improvement appears competitive, we note small number of patients and a high bar set by VRTX's triple combo. VRTX's Phase 2 data of triple combinations were published in the NEJM and was regarded as a ""breakthrough"" in the Editorial."
shouldn't this be up more?

Incoming CEO gave upbeat and confident presentation about entire VRTX pipeline at the Credit Suisse investor conference yesterday. Worth listening to replay. New CFO also spoke and sounded equally knowledable about the company's launch of Trikafta and the company's acquistions over the past year and stated more are in the works. Also stated an agreement with France to pay for CF drugs may be coming soon. Company appears to have outstanding executive leadership and the growth potential is huge. No wonder the stock is once again hitting all time highs this week.
Long vrtx 170 calls at 3.75. this should fly after earnings
Looks like the market is anticipating bad unemployment numbers tomorrow.
How many companies out there can match such an outstanding performance??
We need news on non-CF pipeline.
The price drop today doesn't make sense for a company reporting earnings.
"CRSP stock soars on gene editing drug...oh yes, Partner VRTX down after hours. Where’s the love."
52 weeks of VRTX is $143.45. VRTX is considerably cheep still at $99 level. We will establish $99 this week and be ready for $100. Be patient.
Not a bad prediction on Saturday eh...+3-5% ?...I think I give up my day job :)
It is down after hours as well as for the past several days/week due to phase 3 trial in people with one copy of F508del and one copy of a gating mutation did not meet its primary endpoint of absolute change in forced expiratory volume in one second from baseline through 8 weeks.
"vertex always does this, it doesn't matter what they do earnings wise, it always goes down ,will form a base and then go up from there, it always happens"
VRTX reached a new All Time High at 174.11
"Excited about the Suntrust upgrade. The analyst is a medical doctor. The Car - T program, as she noted, has not been priced into the stock. Her $140 target is low. Crsp, per Ceo, uses healthy donor cells, then does the edits to those cells using Crispr/ Cas9. The cancer treatments are then available “off the shelf” to be delivered to patients. This is critical for those with illness who need instant treatment. $CRSP wholly owns the Car-t program. $VRTX is partnered on most of the other developmental programs, including DMD. At any rate, the analyst from Suntrust is giving a price target, that when hit will be raised. I think the other analysts will be raising price targets soon too."
"FROM THE CONFERENCE CALL:""We've actually been working on what's next after CF, which is one part of your question, for quite high now, for a couple of years, and we sort of view it as a 2-part approach. First of all, what's beyond CF in terms of trends to find disease areas really is, we think, consistent with what we've learned in CF. That is we're really only interested in transformative medicines in serious diseases that we can sell into these specialty areas with relatively low SG&A, which will then allow us to recycle most of our OpEx back into R&D. That's the model, and we're going to stick to that model as we move beyond CF. And then we view internal research and BD as essentially complementary, often even looking at the same diseases using some internal programs and some external programs. And so for instance, we've talked about sickle cell disease as a program that we're interested in because it does fit that profile. We have an internal small molecule program or several of them actually in sickle cell disease. We have our collaboration with CRISPR in sickle cell disease, and we may even look at additional outside programs. So this hybrid combination of inside investment and outside investment is the way we're going to go at this for the majority of diseases."""
Option prices are frozen. Somebody is asleep at the helm.
I wouldn't be surprised if some large trades are occurring due to executive options trading. Whatever is going on it's creating a long term buying opportunity
"Earning Likely to Double: Based in Boston, Vertex is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in treatments for cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic disease that causes persistent lung infections and – over time – limits the ability to breathe. More than 30,000 people in the U.S. are living with cystic fibrosis, more than 70,000 worldwide. Those who survive into adulthood generally don’t live past the age of 38. Among drug companies, Vertex is an anomaly. While it has plans to treat other rare diseases like sickle cell and genetic liver conditions, its pipeline is almost solely cystic fibrosis drugs. The company currently treats 31,000 patients worldwide with its two cystic fibrosis drugs: Kalydeco and Orkambi. Those two drugs – alone or in combination with a drug known as lumacaftor – serve the vast majority of those receiving treatment. Vertex expects to soon get approval of a third treatment that combines its two drugs with the drug tezacaftor. Beyond that, it wants to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients who don’t respond to existing medications.In adults who already have lung damage, the new combination improves lung function within two weeks. But the company’s goal is to also prevent infants with the genetic disorder from ever developing the disease.We’ll see the next earnings report here January 31. I expect Vertex earned $1.97 a share for 2017 – and those earnings are likely to double this year."
How different is vx 864 from vx 814? Gotta be doubts about that drug too now.
CRSP is working on a cure through gene editing for Cystic fibrosis. This explains also Vertex buying CRSP for $250+ a share
Ark bought 60 k shares yesterday
"April 9, 2021 07:11 AM EDTUpdated 08:17 AM PharmaRegulatoryCBO: Congressional action on drug prices will make R&D spending less attractiveZachary BrennanSenior EditorThe greed of pharmaceutical companies has long been one of the reasons Congress has sought to reign in the industry’s high price tags for new drugs.But a new report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Thursday pours cold water on the idea that large pharma companies are pumping all their profits into share buybacks, marketing, and CEO salaries. In fact, the CBO notes that pharma spending on drug R&D ramped up by nearly 50% between 2015 and 2019, and now outpaces what other similar industries, like software and semiconductor companies, spend on R&D.Smaller companies are also shouldering some of that increase in R&D spending in recent years. Companies with annual revenues of less than $500 million now account for more than 70% of the nearly 3,000 drugs in Phase III clinical trials, the CBO says.“The share of R&D funded directly by revenues has declined in recent years because an increasing amount of R&D is now conducted by research-oriented drug companies with few or no products on the market,” the report notes. “Over the past decade, small or emerging drug companies have developed a rising share of new drugs. Those companies have relatively little revenue (some have none at all), and most of them must seek outside financing, such as venture capital, and collaborative agreements with larger drug companies.”"
Buying the 230 calls cheap!!!
Perfect time for a big pharma to come in and swoop up this beaten down piece of #$%$ As most of us recall the company told us they were not in favor of selling a significant amount of shares to a company who wanted about to buy at $210 a share . Well here is their chance to gain some control and buy lower than $210. Leiden needs to get off his duff and either buy something or sell this company.
This stock is being a brat today but I picked up more shares

Any idea why this stock is tanking?
Nice upgrades. Not that I believe most analysts now in this market dynamic.
"Below, you will find the first of Q&A in the earning's conf. call. VX-864 is the key for the share price recovery to 300 area. Cory Kasimov -- J.P. Morgan -- AnalystHey, good afternoon, guys and thank you for taking my questions. Two of them for you. On the AAT program, has the IDMC been taking regular looks at the 864 safety database and would you characterize this is a situation where no news is good news on the safety front or is that still premature where you are in enrollment? And then also in this program, I think, what's the -- in terms of relative levels of functional serum AAT, what would give you conviction that you're on to something here and provide added confidence going into the next stage of development? Thank you.Reshma Kewalramani -- Chief Executive Officer and PresidentHey, Cory, this is Reshma. Let me take both of those questions for you. The AATD program is indeed followed very carefully as we do all of our programs honestly from a safety perspective, and that is just part of what we do. So that is ongoing. With regard to levels and maybe broadly speaking, what are we really looking for from this VX-864 Phase 2 proof-of-concept study really three things, the first is safety. This is the first time that VX-864 is going to patients with AATD. The second is PK and exposure and the third is increases in functional AAT levels. I'm also going to be looking to see if there is a dose effect relationship. The key here remember is that, this is our first time to close the loop on cracking the biology.That's to say, if we see levels of functional AAT increase in this study, we see a dose effect. What that tells us, is that the mechanism that we projected to be the mechanism that could target both lung and liver raise AAT level, we got it. And as I always say we divide drug development, Vertex into two parts, cracking the biology, pouring on the chemistry."
A share buyback would mean a lot. The management should know this is a cheap price for Vertex and there is cash to be deployed
"T news is huge, getting stronger all day, 44 likely by the bell, level 2 shows mm's setting up for the push through 40! They finally have made the plans, and performed the actions to best verizon."
Don't sell your shares here. You will lose the chance to double your money. In a few years the share price will be 300 - 500 area.
disappointed nothing new in the news. sitting on a balance sheet with no prospects is not what the markets are looking for . do not have much for shares but . . . . may have to dump them and go shopping . .. cannot see this increasing by may. IMO
In 2 weeks the stock has lost 75$ 
this is oversold......I added at 215.55.....to lower my cost avg.....bargain!
"Contrary to the past when VRTX was only concentrating on CF, it is important to note that it is diversifying its pipeline:""While Vertex is mainly focused on developing and strengthening its CF franchise, the company also has a early-stage portfolio in other specialty disease areas like pain, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia and APOL1-mediated kidney diseases. Vertex’s non-CF pipeline is also progressing rapidly with data in multiple diseases expected in 2020."""
Why is this up?
"Potential buyout here?? This stock is acting like it's being looked at heavily by another pharmaceutical company. Steadily up making new highs repeatedly. Looks eerily similar to chart patterns of others that rise quickly for a prolonged period. Would be better to have it go alone long-term, but a tie-up with a bigger company would be interesting. Just a thought."
CRSP is primed for the taking...let's buy them before too late! Already aware of the potential for the future. Buy buy buy!
Market cap of $40B is ridiculous. Cystic Fibrosis market is not that big to justify this. Company basically has nothing to offer in the pipeline. Real value $80 per share max.

(VRTX) on Wednesday reported third-quarter net income of $128.7 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.On a per-share basis, the Boston-based company said it had net income of 50 cents. Earnings, adjusted for stock option expense and non-recurring costs, were $1.09 per share.The results beat Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of $1 per share.The drugmaker posted revenue of $784.5 million in the period, also beating Street forecasts.

"Excellent buy by VRTX. Bought over 3M shares of Kymers at $6.53 per share. Kymera is now trading at around $30.""In May 2019, Vertex entered into a collaboration agreement with Kymera (amended on August 27, 2020 as to terms not material to this description, the “Collaboration Agreement”). As initial consideration for the collaboration, Vertex paid Kymera $70 million upfront, which included a non-refundable upfront payment of $50 million and an equity investment in Kymera through the purchase by Vertex of 3,059,695 shares of Kymera Series B-1 preferred stock at a purchase price of $6.5366 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $20 million. In connection with its equity investment, Vertex holds certain rights to invest, in its sole discretion, in future private placements or public securities offerings by Kymera on a pro rata basis, subject to certain conditions. The Series B-1 preferred stock held by Vertex converted to Shares of common stock at the IPO Closing.Under the Collaboration Agreement, the parties established a joint advisory committee that will, among other responsibilities, review and oversee certain strategic activities performed under the Collaboration Agreement, including reviewing the research plan and budget for the research activities and reviewing the research activities performed by each party.The initial research term of the collaboration is four years, extendable for an additional one-year period upon mutual agreement by the parties and payment by Vertex of certain per-target fees.The Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by Vertex either in its entirety or on a target-by-target basis upon prior written notice to Kymera. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement upon the other party’s material breach, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or winding up of the other party. Kymera also has the right to terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to a certain target upon 30 days’ prior written notice in the event that Vertex ceases all research, development and commercialization activities related to such target for a certain period of time, provided that the cessation is not the result of events outside of Vertex’s control.In March 2020, Vertex purchased 887,311 shares of Kymera’s Series C preferred stock at a price of $6.5366 per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.8 million.

In 2014, Janssen entered into an exclusive license agreement with Vertex Pharmaceuticals to develop the compound, which has a different mechanism of action from existing antiviral drugs. Since then, a series of clinical trials has shown that the treatment, especially when used in conjunction with another commonly used antiviral, can help cut the viral load—that is, the amount of virus that's present—in patients who've contracted a strain called influenza A, which is the type most often associated with large flu epidemics.Two Phase 3 studies of the compound are currently underway, with results of the trial, which is being supported by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, expected next year."

"it appears Yahoo news is not working. Here is the content of the news which I think is causing vrtx to go down. However, the new drug if it is successful is a complementary drug to VRTX and not a competing drug. I think lost of investor are just reacting to headline and not reading the text, if at all.California-based Synedgen has spun out its experimental cystic fibrosis treatments into a new biotech to be based in the Boston area, with an eye toward complementing existing drugs for the lung disease.The new company, called Synspira, launched on Thursday with $8 million in financing from an anonymous investor and an exclusive license to privately-held Synedgen’s preclinical program for cystic fibrosis. Synspira is operating virtually — the CEO, Synedgen chief operating officer Shenda Baker, is its only current full-time employee — but the company is looking for physical office space in the Boston area. The best-selling drugs for cystic fibrosis, made by Boston-based VertexPharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: VRTX), target the underlying cause of the disease — a wide range of genetic mutations. Synspira, by contrast, is developing treatments that target the buildup of mucus and bacteria in the lungs. Doing so could boost the effectiveness of antibiotics and improve lung function, the company believes.The drugs are made of modified sugar molecules, which are designed to loosen mucus and prevent the buildup of bacteria on the surface of the lungs — a condition that can act as a shield to antibiotics. Synspira's most advanced drug is expected to enter a Phase 1 study in 2018, Baker said in an interview.“There are dozens of different (genetic) defects, and it's hard to target them all,” she said. “As Vertex’s drugs and others’ move forward, our drug will be able to assist in pulmonary decline, by clearing out and removing infections that make lungs function less effectively.”Among local firms, Norwood-based Corbus Pharmaceuticals is also developing a cystic fibrosis drug that is designed to manage the potentially deadly inflammation caused by the disease. That treatment is in mid-stage studies."
"Vertex Pharmaceuticals : Announces FDA Fast Track Designation and Initiation of a Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial for VX-880, a Novel Investigational Cell Therapy for the Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes !!!"
Honestly yesterday's price movement was total manipulation. I don't see any of the institutions sold single share of their holdings yesterday. Thus I don't think it will be usual 3-5 days selling due to margin calls because there would be no margin calls. It could have been one day sold off and quick bounce back to $250 and go sideways till earnings report. I'm almost certain they will beat the estimate handily and gap up to $270 ~280. I'm in at $214 and expecting 25 ~ 30 % return in 2 weeks.

"Holding tough, boded well!"
"So the FDA required additional testing of VX 561. and VRTX has decided to move with Kalydeco instead so there wont be any delays. Those who are unloading or shorting do not understand that VRTX is following the second option:""Because our goal has always been to get the best regimen to patients as quickly as possible, we decided to move forward with VX-445 with Kalydeco because that's the quickest route and we didn't want to take a delay. Having said that, I also think that the decision was probably a bit influenced by the fact that Kalydeco has been so well studied in so many thousands of patients and, frankly, it set a very, very high bar, both in terms of efficacy and safety. And so [FDA regulators] have a lot of comfort with it, and that made it, I think, easier to enable us to move forward more quickly with that regimen."""

"Galapagos advances its CF-portfolio:Galapagos and AbbVie are developing a portfolio of candidates addressing three complementary components for a potential combination therapy. Novel C2 corrector GLPG2737 is the first of multiple C2 correctors being developed and is the final component needed to complete a first triple combination; this drug initiating a Phase 1 safety study marks a significant step in the progress of the companies' cystic fibrosis triple combination portfolio development. Potentiators GLPG1837 and GLPG2451 and C1 corrector GLPG2222 are already being tested in the clinic.Triple combinations of CF compounds in the portfolio have consistently shown restoration of healthy activity levels in in vitro assays with human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells of patients with the F508del mutation. These combinations result in an increase in chloride transport compared to Orkambi[1] in HBE cells with the homozygous F508del mutation.

"An update on VRTX Parion partnership that dates back to 2015 to explore use of Enac inhibitors in the treatment of CF.In January this year, VRTX sold back the rights to develop the Parion Enac inhibitors in the treatment of CF and PCD (because of lack of sufficient efficacy). Maybe ARWR Enac inhibitors will work better in CF? Maybe not..... Trikafta sets a very high bar.... Parion Sciences Reacquires Rights to Epithelial Sodium Channel InhibitorsDurham, NC (January 23, 2020) – Parion Sciences, a company dedicated to the development ofnovel treatments for pulmonary diseases, announced today that it has reached an agreementwith Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to reacquire the pulmonary rights to epithelial sodiumchannel (ENaC) inhibitors developed under a collaboration announced between the parties in2015. Under this agreement, Vertex is eligible to receive future undisclosed royalties basedupon commercial success.During their collaboration, the companies evaluated P-1037/VX-371 in multiple Phase 2 clinicalstudies as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia patients. Inclinical studies, P-1037/VX-371 was generally well tolerated.“Parion appreciates Vertex’s support over the course of our collaboration by progressing P1037 into multiple patient populations.” said Paul Boucher, President, Parion Sciences. “At thistime, Parion is evaluating scenarios for P-1037’s continued development as a potential therapytreating those patients who suffer from diseases as a result of mucus obstruction.”About ENaC Inhibitors and P-1037Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) inhibitors are designed to block the sodium channels on theairway surfaces. In pulmonary diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cysticfibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, where there is a build-up of excessively concentratedmucus, preclinical models have demonstrated that blocking ENaC hydrates the mucus on thelung surface. Hydration of airway mucus restores airway clearance and improves lung function.P-1037 is a novel, long acting ENaC Inhibitor that was well tolerated at the doses tested inmultiple clinical trials in healthy volunteers and patients with either cystic fibrosis or primaryciliary dyskinesia.About Parion SciencesParion Sciences is a development stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to research,development and commercialization of treatments to improve and extend the lives of patientswith innate mucosal surface defense deficiencies of the airways. Parion has a diverse pipelineof pre-clinical and clinical candidates for the treatment of these diseases via distinctivemechanisms of action and approaches. Parion is at the forefront of ENaC development and isleveraging our scientific expertise in epithelial biology to expand our platforms and novelchemical compounds into new indications to treat mucosal defects. Parion has receivedsupport and grant funding from the National Institutes of Health and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc. For more information, please see our website atwww.Parion.com."

"3rd qtr conference call gave a lot of new information. Pain meds e.g. VX 150, and additional Na1.8 inhibitors likely to be marketed by a small VRTX sales force directly to specialty markets for some acute pain indications. To treat chronic pain due to OA/chronic back pain, they plan on partnering it to a larger pharma with a large primary care sales force for that indication. (This would be a cost effective way to maximize profitability from this treatment by limiting size of needed sales force while still profiting from partnering the drug for sales to primary care market for chronic pain indications.) Crisper cas 9 data for SCA and thalassemia apparently going to be available in 2019 (not 2020 as originally projected). Likewise AAT clinical trials starting at the end of year will have data likely available in 2019. Positive data from these early clinical trials will open the door to rapid enrollment in mid-stage trials and add huge potential value to VRTX. FSG patients will also likely have treatments entering clinical trials to treat this terrible chronic kidney disease in 2019. In the meantime, triple drug CF Phase 3 trials will be reporting starting the end of this year into first quarter 2019 with NDA filing for at least one triple CF treatment to be filed with the FDA no later than mid-2019 to treat potentially 90% of all CF patients affording them potentially normal life expectancy with normal lives if treatment is started early enough. Competition from GLPG and PTI did not seem to be a concern to VRTX management, who cited competitors needing to surpass the 'high bar' established by VRTX triple drugs, soon to be approved, and the time it will take for competitors to develop viable proven drugs with long term data to demonstrate both safety and efficacy. (Not just 2 weeks of interim data in a handful of patients recently reported). Long term investors in VRTX should feel confident in this company's pipeline and record of success. Current decline in VRTX share price is a real buying opportunity for this company's stock, which IMO will turn around once the November election is behind us if not sooner."

"PDUFA date for tezacaftor/ivacaftor announced today Feb 28, 2017, but given the safety and efficacy record and the priority the FDA has made to giving earlier approvals for meds offering substantial improvement in treatment of serious disease I would not be surprised to hear about FDA approval coming before year end like they did the expedited approval of Kalydeco in the residual function mutations."
"Latest in gene editing to treat beta-thalassemia and sickle cell anemiahttps://www.statnews.com/2018/08/31/human-trial-of-crispr-for-blood-disorder-launches/?utm_source=STAT+Newsletters&utm_campaign=528a3e70f4-Daily_Recap&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_8cab1d7961-528a3e70f4-150187573[[ .... Rather than correcting the disease-causing mutation in gene directly, the therapy targets a region of DNA that acts like a brake on production of a form of hemoglobin that the body usually stops making after the first months of life, called fetal hemoglobin. In the rare cases when a genetic variant keeps production turned on well into childhood and even adulthood, even people with β-thalassemia (or sickle cell) have enough healthy hemoglobin to avoid the worst symptoms of those sometimes-fatal diseases.The CRISPR therapy being tested is called ex vivo, meaning that blood cells are taken from a patient and altered in the lab (much like CAR-T cancer therapy) and then returned to the patient. In this case, CRISPR molecules are introduced to the blood cells via electroporation, and the genome editor alters the fetal hemoglobin “brake.” If all goes well, the CRISPR’d cells will then produce red blood cells that contain fetal hemoglobin.“This is one important step of many toward bringing the promise of this new technology to patients with serious diseases like sickle cell and beta thalassemia, and we are thrilled to be at the forefront of what we believe may be a fundamental change in the treatment of disease,” Vertex spokesperson Heather Nichols said.In May, CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex announced that the Food and Drug Administration had placed a “clinical hold” on the companies’ application to test CTX001 in sickle cell in a U.S. study, but that the planned Phase 1/2 trial in Europe in adults with β-thalassemia was on track. That is the trial that is now recruiting patients. ...]]"
"I think we have lead program beta thalassemia and sickle cell. We’re enrolling patients. I’ll talk more about this program and we’re partnered with Vertex Pharmaceuticals on this program 50-50, and we’re jointly advancing this program in what could be the best-in-class medicine for these patients suffering from thalassemia and sickle cell.A few words on hemoglobinopathies, these diseases are devastating blood diseases, both sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia results in significant co-morbidities and early death. In the case of sickle cell disease, where you have as a root cause is a mutation in the beta-globin gene. In the case of thalassemia, there is a mutation in many parts of the gene, which could result in a deficiency of beta-globin, which is a subunit of adult hemoglobin and in both these cases, you have significant morbidity and mortality, but not only that, there is a very heavy burden on patient care,, the cost of managing severe sickle-cell patient in the US is over $300,000 per year as shown by recent publications release from CMS.In these indications, what we’re doing is recapitulating nature. There have been a number of studies across populations around the world, which showed that if patients or people I should say have high fetal hemoglobin even if they have the genetics of sickle-cell thalassemia they’re asymptomatic or their symptoms go down the higher the fetal hemoglobin. Now what’s happening here?We have two copies or two forms of the hemoglobin. One is adult hemoglobin and the second is fetal hemoglobin. We’re all born with fetal hemoglobin and within six months of being born, our body has a rail tree mechanism where the fetal hemoglobin is down regulated and the adult hemoglobin takes over. In some people because of their existing mutation are some other editorial elements, their fetal hemoglobin is never turned off and they have higher levels of fetal hemoglobin and even if you have the genetics of thalassemia or sickle-cell, they can overcome that with the high levels of fetal hemoglobin.These studies of patient populations, led us do this approach where we actually use CRISPR Cas9 to recreate the same mutation seen in nature to elevate fetal hemoglobin and overcome the deficiency or defectiveness of betaglobin gene. This was all supported by a number of preclinical studies that went into our R&D the CTA filings and then we started these two trials CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 trials and these were the pioneering Crisper trials where we’ve dosed more than 20 patients across both of these indications. The trials are designed in a way where while their Phase 1, 2, they could be registration trials for patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. We’ve started these trials in patients of age 12 to 35 but we’ve indicated that we’ve expanded this our chronic status into pediatric populations as well as we see efficacy and safety in the early patients that we’ve treated.I’ll talk more about the patients in each of these, but essentially, we showed data first in November of 2019 and then subsequently at [indiscernible] Nash Conference last year and this data on Slide eight showed data from TDT transfusion-dependent thalassemia and what you’re seeing in these data are that within a couple of months of being treated with CTX001 you’re seeing significant elevation of HVF which is fetal hemoglobin and while you’re seeing this chart is a dark blue is HBA. This is adult hemoglobin from the transfuse blood that these patients have and that decays over time, but then the fetal hemoglobin takes over and becomes the majority of that compartment and what you’re seeing are very high levels of fetal hemoglobin expression in these patients that render them transfusion independent.So you have patients coming in and it’s the first patient that was treated was a 19-year old female at the time who came in with requiring more than one transfusion a month significant burden on quality of life, significant anemia, all the risks of organ damage from severe thalassemia and after that patient has been treated, they have normal hemoglobin levels on account of the elevated fetal hemoglobin and that’s gone out now over 18 months. So this is a very durable therapy as well."
"Barrons had a good article on p53 and gene-editing:https://www.barrons.com/articles/gene-editing-selloff-is-overdone-1529107202[[... The two papers in Nature Medicine showed that scientists could boost the efficiency of CRISPR gene correction by turning off a gene called p53, which is part of a cell’s natural safeguard against genetic damage. Because about half of all cancers involve an impairment of p53’s function, the Karolinska team warned that CRISPR developers should be careful not to gain efficiency in gene correction by crimping p53. The companion paper, by researchers at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., said that gene-edited cells should be tested to ensure they’ve got functional p53. Novartis told Barron’s it plans to pursue therapies based on CRISPR, “while thoroughly investigating safety.”The CRISPR companies each said last week they hadn’t found p53 to be a hindrance. Editas spokeswoman Cristi Barnett told Barron’s that p53 activity is vital to keeping cells from accumulating unwanted mutations and shouldn’t be inhibited to enhance a CRISPR treatment. In its preclinical work, Editas hasn’t had to inhibit it. “We can now achieve much higher targeted integration rates and gene correction without suppressing p53,” she said. Intellia CEO John Leonard said his company is beyond the laboratory stage of CRISPR described in the science studies. He also noted the Nature Medicine studies used special types of cells unlike those targeted by Intellia and its peers.Crispr Therapeutics peaked near $74 last month after the company and partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals(VRTX) filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the country’s first clinical trial of CRISPR. At the end of May, the FDA placed the study on hold while the companies answered “certain questions” the agency had."

"If earnings revenue and guidance surpass expectations on Wednesday, stock should breakout to new highs.Only overhang on the stock is political rhetoric about pharmaceuticals in general coming into an election year. If any of the non CF pipeline starts getting value factored in by analysts, the stock will really start to move. The non CF assets that are expected to deliver positive clinical trial results soon are the CRSP VRTX collaboration treating beta thal and SCA. The upbeat reports from CRSP today moved that stock without any new data on CTX 001 but the announcement that enrollment is ongoing for both diseases is very optimistic that the initial patients treated for both conditions are doing well. VRTX should benefit when the data is released in December. This week is North American CF meeting. Now that triple therapy is approved it should be the focus of analysts calculating the incremental growth of sales and earnings, along with the reimbursement starting to come in from NHS in UK Scotland Australia and Spain for recent approvals for payment of Orkambi and Symkevi/Symdeko. Pain meds will hopefully finally be advanced to pivotal trials next year and initial readouts on treatments for AAT and FSGS later in 2020 to demonstrate initial proof of safety and clinical efficacy."

An announcement of such a plan based on market conditions will send a message to short hedge funds as well those who manipulate PPS.

"Why Wainwright Analysts were wrongMy comments on issues they listed in their downgrade:•No change in underwhelming view on Orkambi.They are not specific. If they are thinking about the underperforming sales, this has to do with compliance and safety. VX-661/Kal combo will rectify this issue somewhat, and a future triple combo will improve the treatment for heterozygous as well as homozygous 508 CF if it is safe.•The 661/Kalydeco double is also not likely to perform better than Orkambi.The duo of 661/Kal will be safer and more effective than Orkambi. If this were not the case, Vertex must have chosen a triple containing Lumacaftor not 661 for treatment of 508 CF.Furthermore, this duo can be used for the certain heterozygous 508 mutations. A 70% of gating and residual function mutations has 508 mutation in the other allele. This means that 661/Kal duo will be more effective than Kal alone for these mutations because 661 acts on 508 allele and Kal will work on gating and residual mutation allele.•Ongoing final stage program of 661 is not likely to yield any commercial upside.This is absurd because a better drug will have a better commercial value. •The expected triple combo continued to be far way.Nobody knows how far away.•Even if triple combo is successful, it could only be a replacement and not complement Orkambi.This is also an absurd statement. A triple combo can be effective for all heterozygous 508 CF mutations as well as for the homozygous mutation. Orkambi is not effective against most heterozygous 508.•The previous M&A thesis is at its lowest point of any likelihood.Who needs M&A! This stock can double from here if the triple is safe."

More upward revisions bode nicely for VRTX!!
-20% just because this? LOL! This is a great opportunity to buy more. See you after earnings...
"Come on, show me a Bid."
"Early FDA approval of VRTX triple therapy for CF just announced a few minutes ago.

"VRTX New collaboration with Arbor Biotech announced today, in combination with it's increased investment in CRSP confirms that David Altshuler VRTX CSO is committing the company to a focus on gene editing as its emphasis in R&D of new treataments for genetic based diseases.

We will likely hear more about these investments by VRTX next Monday at JP Morgan."
"PTI yep agree, $VRTX would basically have a MONOPOLY throughout the WORLD if they acquired PTI... PTI has the WORLD's 2nd highest ppFEV1 (not too far off from VRTX), with $ABBV the WORLD's 3rd highest...."
Have we had a GREEN day since VRTX crushed earnings? What is going on here?
"Wainwright Analysts are wrongVX-661/Kalydeco combo will be better than Okambi both in safety and efficacy. This combo will replace Kalydeco in treating CF gating and residual function mutations, and perform better than with Kalydeco alone. Triple combo would be revolutionary in treating CF because it can for the first time can treat heterozygous 508 mutation.The analysts don't understand a high school genetics."
Ignore that last new release because PTI(VRTX competition) is about to dethrone VTRX in #1 CF treatment

"From Benzinga today:""Shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) traded higher on a report from Betaville that Roche (OTC: RHHBY) might have an interest in acquiring the Boston-based marketer of Kalydeco and Orkambi. Vertex replied to Benzinga, ""We do not comment on market rumors or speculation. Vertex's Board of Directors and management are focused on continuing to create significant value for our shareholders by executing our long-term strategy of delivering transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.""The part that says ""Vertex's Board of Directors and management are focused on continuing to create significant value for our shareholders...."" must be a joke. They have been at it with Boger and a while ago, Laden, at the helm since 1989 and have failed miserably. They only have enriched themselves including free options to themselves and their cronies on the board. It is high time to be willing to sell the company so that its many scientists' efforts could be properly used to bring a diversified list of drugs to the market."
"Shorts will need to cover soon as FDA approval expected this week for kalydeco label expansion in approved mutations for patients as young as one year of age. Then phase 2 clinical trial results for pain drug VX 150 in neuralgia and VX 210 in acute spinal cord injury should be released in the next month or two since final clinical data collection was completed in June according to clinical trial. gov web site for each study. If positive, analysts will raise estimates for revenue and earnings factoring in growth from the non-CF drugs in development. Phase 3 trial in influenza drug should be announced soon by JNJ and with approval will provide licensing revenue to raise estimates to VRTX from the licensing and milestone payments, possibly in time for the coming flu season this winter. Lastly completion of enrollment of Phase 3 clinical trials in CF using the two triple drug combos should be announced this quarter, likely accelerating VRTX timeline to be able to treat up to 90% of all CF patients as early as next year. All should be catalysts to higher valuations of VRTX stock."

I got into Vrtx @ 271. I believed in all the hype about their great balance sheet. I still own it but thinking of selling . Take the loss and cancel out my capital gains.

"OK, so VX-814 which was an investigational phase 2 trial was discontinued . So this drug was responsible for 0% of VRTX revenues and profits. And the waste of money into its research has now been stopped. Good news for VRTX, unless one would want them spending money on a drug that most likely won't result in success. Yes, its one of about 15 drugs in phase 1/2 trials, so it is unlikely to have much impact fundamentally on the Co. These super pharma's spend money on R and D. That's what they do. They don't expect every drug to be a blockbuster success. I'd be more focused on upcoming earnings and revenues. That in addition to the current phase 4 trails on 4 drugs that are promising. This will rebound very fast. Buy it cheap while you can. Analysts looking for $2.32 a share this quarter verses $1.23 last year. On the revenue side they expect 1.5 bil vs 950 mil. Gimme a break.

I am planning not to make the same mistake again.If VRTX management and board who are sitting on billions of dollars of cash with more billions of dollars of cash coming in every year, where billions have been sitting in VRTX cash accounts and even after paying annual expenses still large sums are being added to the cash hoard, do not want to support the present shareholders investment, I may have to look elsewhere to invest my money. Right now I sitting on a big big loss and I am not happy with VRTX management and BOD.BTW, I know I will be receiving negative reactions to this post. But I do not care. I am fed up with the management and the BOD. So feel free to give me as many thumb downs as you want!"

"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX, $189.81) is a leader in the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The company's three cystic fibrosis drugs - Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko - treat different genetic variations of the disease.What's compelling about Vertex is that these drugs are throwing off huge amounts of cash, enabling Vertex to invest in R&D and maintain its lead in cystic fibrosis, while diversifying its portfolio into new diseases. These include sickle-cell disease, kidney diseases, antitrypsin deficiency (which can lead to liver and kidney disease) and acute pain. Since 2015, Vertex has grown its cash hoard from $1.0 billion to $3.2 billion, or 47% annually.Vertex also has been able to achieve financial success with a relatively low penetration of its existing market in the U.S., Europe and Australia. Currently, just 18,000 patients are on Vertex cystic fibrosis medicines against 37,000 who are eligible.Further, the company believes it can expand the eligibility pool in two ways. First, by ""expanding the label,"" Vertex can treat younger patients and increase the eligibility pool to about 44,000 patients. Second, by combining its formulas into a triple-combination therapy, VRTX estimates it can increase the pool of eligible patients to approximately 66,000.Vertex said it plans to file its New Drug Application (NDA) for its combo treatment by mid-year."

"The diabetes 'cure' Vertex acquired in its 2019 Semma buyout? It's headed to the clinicMax GelmanAssociate EditorThe stem cell-derived therapy at the center of Vertex’s $950 million buyout of Semma Therapeutics in 2019, one that features prominently in the company’s overall cell and gene therapy push, is one step closer to reaching the clinic.Vertex is expected to launch a Phase I/II trial in the first half of this year after the type 1 diabetes treatment received IND clearance from the FDA on Thursday, the company announced. The program, dubbed VX-880, will be evaluated in type 1 diabetes patients with severe hypoglycemia and those who struggle to perceive the onset of hypoglycemia, like young children.Researchers will try to determine the safety and proper dosage in the study, which will be single-arm and open-label. Vertex plans to enroll about 17 patients. VX-880 itself uses stem-cell derived pancreatic islet cells to try to restore the body’s ability to produce glucose in combination with immunosuppressive therapy to protect the cells.The program has been described as a potential “cure” for type 1 diabetes and comes from research done by Harvard’s Doug Melton. In 2014, Melton published a study showing the potential for using stem cells to create insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, inserted in bulk into mice, that were successfully protected from an immune response.That led him to launch Semma the next year with a $44 million Series A round, followed by a $114 million Series B in 2017 after his team figured out how to upscale the technology for humans. It involved creating an implantable, credit card-sized device containing the beta cells that function like a healthy pancreas.Melton said at the time that it proved challenging to develop such a membrane with pores large enough for molecules to pass through, but small enough to be protected from immune cells. He compared the membrane to a tea bag that couldn’t be overloaded, given that they would need some 150 million cells in order to provide the natural insulin.All that work led up to two studies that presented promising results in June 2019. In the first study, Semma’s stem cell-derived islets performed as hoped for, producing insulin, in a study involving non-human primates whose immune systems had been flattened to prevent a rejection. Then in a study in two pigs, a package of engineered islets contained in one of the implantable membranes successfully generated insulin without needing an immunosuppressant.About two months later, Vertex swooped in with their buyout offer to gamble on the curative potential on the treatment. It came as part of a string of flashy deals, one that saw the big cap biotech snap up Exonics’ gene editing approach to Duchenne and Ribometrix’s RNA drugging capabilities in 2019 collaborations.Stacked on top of a longtime partnership with CRISPR Therapeutics, Vertex’s dealmaking continued into 2020, leading to a pact with Skyhawk Therapeutics last month. The former had demonstrated landmark data in its sickle cell disease program, while the latter is another RNA drugging outfit."

"We have certainly talked about this a lot but I continue to side eye $VRTX as to their approach on not only an approvable end point but how they propose to get there. Below is a comment from Reshma Kewalramani on the last CC""'Ive said a number of times previously, the companies that make augmentation therapy. About 5 of them have gotten their approvals in the U.S. based on levels of AAT. And so we need to go through that. Separately, we are very interested in, and I'm sure others might be interested in understanding the impact of our small molecule correctors on lung function measured by imaging or something like a pulmonary function test, and those are all considerations that we continue to talk and think about. But the framework for our package really is functional AAT levels, antigenic AAT levels and the clearance of the polymers from the liver"".1) As mentioned augmentation therapy already exists. 2) If they were going to attempt to go the augmentation approval endpoint route, FDA would need to see clear benefit of the corrector over that SOC. Personal opinion, I don't see it showing substantiating improvement....why? the corrector by design has to perform multiple biologic complexity's just to turn the protein into what Augmentation therapy already is, a functional protein. Then is it safely correcting enough to be clinically significant. Sure augmentation therapy does nothing for the liver disease, but RNAi does with superb result at this point in time. I am by no means out to trash VRTX here just pointing out it appears their approach to this target is not only not competitive but I am viewing it as a lack of resources and a character flaw to their organization for continuing down this rabbit hole....for what?"

"May 11, 2020 09:33 AM EDT R&DRegulatoryDerailed by the pandemic, FDA offers CRISPR, Vertex drug program VIP status for its comeback playJohn CarrollEditor & FounderCRISPR Therapeutics may have run into a hurdle for its clinical program to advance CTX001 in severe hemoglobinopathies, but the FDA is on record that it will do everything it can to get the drug back on track and headed to the finish line.CRISPR and its partners at Vertex announced Monday morning that the FDA had awarded them the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy — RMAT — designation for their program to treat severe sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. And that should give them an open door as they hustle through the clinical program.The move comes a little more than 5 months after researchers offered a snapshot look at positive results for the first patient in each of those 2 programs. And it follows close on the heels of an SEC filing noting that researchers here had to stop enrolling new patients due to the Covid-19 outbreak.advertisementIn the program, researchers extract hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from patients and then re-engineer them using CRISPR/Cas9 tech. Those cells are then infused back into patients.At the time, Vertex executive chairman Jeff Leiden heralded the snapshot results as evidence of its “potential to be a curative CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing therapy.”"

Back to 200
"now that TezIva is approved VRTX is expected to release sales forecast for 2018. 28 k patients are eligible for Orkambi, but only 12.5 k patients have initiated treatment, most of the deficit is due to problems with Orkambi, TezIva will fill most of this gap, plus expand pool of eligible patients to 44k. Against this background I expect VRTX sales in 2018 to be > 3 billions, should lift the sp to higher levels."

"Time for Vertex to either exclusively license Proteostasis therapeutics (PTI) CF drugs in development or buy the company outright. (Similar situation was the deal Vertex did with Concert Pharma). Need this to insure CF franchise from competitive threat of another larger pharma acquiring PTI first and risking another competitive threat like in hepatitis C when GILD bought pharmasset, eventually causing VRTX to stop sales of telavprevir. While VRTX CF drugs are likely to be competitive to PTI's, VRTX business plan includes acquisition of novel new or compliementary add on treatments to it's own CF drugs. This is the time to execute on this plan while PTI's market cap is relatively low. Even if their drugs don't pan out, the control of their development is well worth the price to insure CVRTX leadership position in CF."

"Is it legal to trade stocks while writing legislation favoring the stock? Any case we may have a biopharma friend at HHS.WSJ: TOM PRICE TRADED $300,000 IN HEALTH CARE STOCKS SINCE 2012 — President-elect Donald Trump's pick to run HHS has traded shares in about 40 health care companies in the past four years, according to a Wall Street Journal review of Price's filings with Congress. Price sponsored or co-sponsored dozens of health-related bills in the House during this time.. .It's legal for members of Congress to trade stocks — but it also introduces legal risks and thorny ethical conundrums, especially if the legislator is writing laws that can influence the sector. “Good judgment would be to stay out of health care stocks if you are on a health-care related committee,” Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer with the George W. Bush administration and now with the University of Minnesota Law School, tells CQ Roll Call.… The Trump transition team said that, if confirmed, Price would comply with ethics laws that require him to sell his shares in companies that are regulated by HHS or recuse himself from relevant decision-making.Among the stocks that Price has traded: Aetna, Amgen, athenaHealth, Eli Lilly and Pfizer.… The Journal focuses on Price's August 2016 purchase of up to $100,000 in shares of an Australian biomedical firm, Innate Immunotherapeutics Inc. The company's majority shareholder is Rep. Chris Collins, a member of Trump's transition team. The House this year passed the 21st Century Cures bill, a wide-ranging packet of biomedical-related legislation that could benefit firms like Innate. The company's stock price has doubled since Price bought his shares, giving him an on-paper gain of between $50,000 and $100,000.… The issue of lawmakers playing the stock market isn't new, but ethics experts tell PULSE that some trades remain unseemly, especially when legislators are perceived to be profiting through a combination of specialized knowledge and lawmaking ability. One 2004 study found that U.S. senators outperformed the 1990s stock market boom by an average of 12 percentage points. Ethics experts also predicted that Price's stock trades would be scrutinized at his confirmation hearings next year."

"From VRTX Schedule 14A filing:Non-CF Pipeline Over the last decade, we have demonstrated an ability to serially discover and develop multiple groundbreaking medicines in different diseases. In 2017, we and our collaborators continued our serial innovation, advancing promising non-CF programs for important diseases, including pain, sickle cell disease, alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency, polycystic kidney disease and influenza. Specifically, since the beginning of 2017, we have: Obtained the first clinical proof-of-concept from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating a selective NaV1.8 inhibitor as a potential treatment for chronic pain in January 2017 (VX-150 is our lead non-opioid NaV1.8 inhibitor) Obtained clinical proof-of-concept from a second Phase 2 clinical trial of VX-150 as a potential treatment for acute pain in February 2018 Initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial of VX-128, a second non-opioid sodium channel inhibitor, in December 2017 Executed a co-development and co-commercialization agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics AG for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease Advanced through pre-clinical development CTX001 for beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease pursuant to our collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics AG. We expect to initiate Phase 1/2 clinical trials in 2018 to evaluate CTX001, which will be the first, or one of the first, clinical trials to evaluate a potential CRISPR/Cas9 drug candidate. Advanced our research program for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency into late-stage pre-clinical development Janssen Pharmaceuticals, our collaborator, initiated Phase 3 development of pimodivir as a potential treatment for influenza Successfully outlicensed our oncology programs to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany"

missed on Q4 EPS (Wall Street expecting $2.59)and 2021 revenue forecast weak -- only 10% growth!
"That gives them the opportunity to move faster than gene therapies, with a simpler manufacturing approach that should avoid the CMC snafus that have bedeviled the leaders in gene therapy. Any stumble that may occur will have to play out in the spotlight — but the finish line is looming into view. And Jefferies’ Michael Yee sees big potential returns for Vertex:VRTX looks like it has a pot’l blockbuster in due course and a pot’l “curative” type gene editing drug which could be $1B type potential in the future (sickle cell has 10x more pts than beta thal). This program doesn’t get sufficient attention from VRTX holders mostly because Street is more enamored with the AAT Phase II, but this CRSP partnership should get more attention now."
Buying opportunity
"For what it’s worth, I called my broker yesterday and told him I wanted to sell my BMY stock and buy something else in the healthcare field. He got back in touch with me this morning and told me he really likes VRTX so I ended up buying 50 shares today."
There is an absolute concrete floor at the $263 level. VRTX has bounced off it 5 times in the last 2 months. This one is destined to go higher!!
Trading pattern changed=Bullish
"Reasons To Sell: Trikafta Launch May Cannibalize Sales of Other Drugs: On third/fourth quarter conference call, management said that a large proportion of patients currently on Kalydeco, Orkambi or Symdeko will switch to Trikafta over time. We expect that once Trikafta is fully launched in the United States and EU and gains necessarily reimbursement approvals in EU, there will be a rapid erosion of existing combinations.Also, even if Trikafta is eventually approved in EU in 2020, Vertex would need to seek government reimbursement on a country-by-country basis, in most European markets, which is a time consuming process and may limit ex-U.S. revenues of the drug.Competing Therapies in Development: Several companies like AbbVie, Eloxx Pharmaceuticals, Translate Bio and Proteostasis Therapeutics are developing medicines to treat CF. Even though Vertex enjoys a strong position in this market, the entry of additional competition would cut into revenues.Banking on CF Franchise: Although we are positive on Vertex’s decision to focus on the CF franchise, we remain concerned about the company’s dependence on just this franchise for growth. While the company does have other pipeline candidates targeting other therapeutic areas, it is too early to get excited about them.Pipeline/Regulatory Setbacks: Vertex has several studies ongoing with its CF product candidates and any negative development on the pipeline/regulatory front will have an adverse impact on shares. In October 2017, Vertex announced that it will not file regulatory applications for VX-661 - ivacaftor combination in CF patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a gating mutation, as a phase III study evaluating VX-661 — ivacaftor use in such patients failed to meet the primary endpoint.In October 2018, Vertex discontinued development of VX-210 (acute cervical spinal cord injuries) due to futility."
wonder why the pain indication (VX-150) was not mentioned in the call
Any specific evidence for fall except overall market pullback?

"Positive Phase 3 Study Results for TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) in People Ages 12 and Older With Cystic Fibrosis Who Have One Copy of the F508del Mutation and One Gating or Residual Function MutationBUSINESS WIRE 9:00 AM ET 7/20/2020 Symbol Last Price Change VRTX 294.53 0 (0%) QUOTES AS OF 04:00:00 PM ET 07/17/2020 -Phase 3 study met primary endpoint and all secondary endpoints- -Study is a U.S. post-marketing commitment and will be submitted to FDA- -Data also will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency to support indication expansion of the EU label following triple combination approval- BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated(VRTX) today announced results of a global Phase 3 study of TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) ages 12 years and older who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one gating mutation (F/G) or one copy of the F508del mutation and one residual function mutation (F/RF). The study met its primary endpoint of mean absolute within-group change in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV1) from baseline through 8 weeks of treatment, demonstrating a statistically significant 3.7 percentage point (p<0.0001)improvement in ppFEV1 in patients treated with TRIKAFTA compared to their baseline after a 4-week run-in of treatment on ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The study met all secondary endpoints, including a statistically significant mean within-group reduction of 22.3 mmol/L from baseline in sweat chloride (p<0.0001). The regimen was generally well-tolerated, and safety data were consistent with those observed in previous Phase 3 studies with TRIKAFTA. The study is a post-marketing commitment in the U.S. and the results will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In the U.S., TRIKAFTA is already approved for use in people with CF ages 12 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation, which includes the populations evaluated in this study. In June, Vertex received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for the initial triple combination regimen application for people with CF ages 12 years and older with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation (F/MF) or two F508del mutations (F/F). Data announced today from this study will be submitted to the European Medicines Agency to support a potential indication expansion of the EU label, once European Commission approval has been granted for the initial triple combination application. Full study results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting and/or publication. “The results of this study demonstrate that the triple combination provides significant additional benefit compared to existing CFTR modulator therapy for F/G and F/RF patients and adds to the robust body of evidence supporting the benefit of this medicine for patients with at least one F508del mutation,” said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “We look forward to submitting these data to the EMA in support of a potential indication expansion of the EU label following initial approval.” About the 445-104 Study The data announced today are from a global Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TRIKAFTA in people with CF ages 12 years and older who have one copy of the F508del mutation and one gating mutation (F/G), or one copy of the F508del mutation and one residual function mutation (F/RF). All participants had a 4-week run-in period of either ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Following the run-in, patients were randomized to receive TRIKAFTA or to remain on their prior regimen of ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor for 8 weeks. Baseline was measured at the end of the run-in period, prior to the start of the 8-week treatment period. A total of 132 participants received TRIKAFTA and 126 patients were in the control group that received either ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. The primary endpoint of the study, the mean absolute within-group improvement from baseline in ppFEV1 through 8 weeks of treatment with TRIKAFTA, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement of +3.7 percentage points in ppFEV1 (p<0.0001). The study met all secondary endpoints, including, in the order of statistical testing hierarchy, statistically significant mean absolute within-group change in sweat chloride of -22.3 mmol/L (p<0.0001) from baseline through 8 weeks in patients treated with TRIKAFTA, and between-group mean changes of +3.5 percentage points in ppFEV1 (p<0.0001) and -23.1 mmol/L in sweat chloride (p<0.0001) in patients treated with TRIKAFTA compared to the control group of those who received ivacaftor or tezacaftor/ivacaftor. Overall, safety data were similar to those obs"

"Third quarter conference call highlights:Q&A were most informative on the progress of the CF franchise pipeline and the business plan for expanding the use of already approved Orkambi and Ivacaftor and hopeful approval of 661 (tezacaftor) next year.Triple therapy clinical trials starting this quarter and in 2017 (and potential quad therapy with EnAc inhibitors from Pharion) discussed in response to analyst questions. Clearly next generation correctors 440 and 152 entering phase 2 clinical trials this quarter in combination with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in het min and 508dd mutatations confirm management's optimism about extending Vertex CF treatments to 90% of all CF patients. Concerns about teratogenicity or nausea in 440 and 152 respectively, prompted management to advance a third next gen corrector, 659 into phase 1 clinical trials as well this quarter, with it being only six months behind 440 and 152 in it's development as an alternative drug for triple therapy should the first two next gen correctors have any significant problems in safety or efficacy. Vertex is obviously intent on not losing the CF market to competitors like what happened in hep C. No mention of non CF pipeline progress except the broad comments by Ian Smith about the long term growth of the company including new breakthrough drugs being developed for serious diseases. I expect some detail about the non CF pipeline at JP Morgan investor conference in early January. Investor conference this Thursday at NACF should give more details about the long term efficacy of Orkambi and Kalydeco in the approved CF populations, bolstering it's use by prescribers among CF patients still not yet on treatment specifically. the 2000 508dd CF patients in the US who have still not yet been started on Orkambi, and the ex-US 508dd population awaiting EU Canadian and Australian NHS payment authorization in patients 12 and older. Rapid uptake of Orkambi in 508dd CF children ages 6-11 will be likely in the next two quarters in the US and eventually in the EU after approval likely in 2017. Long term efficacy data to be presented at NACF meeting this week will bolster adherence and refill compliance rates once the word is out that after the initial first one or two months of chest tightness/adverse effects from Orkambi, the majority of patients should get improved quality of life and exercise tolerance, reduced incidence of hospitalizations and incidence of serious pulmonary infections, and hopefully will be proven to slow loss of lung function over time extending life expectancy. I suspect 661/tezacaftor with Ivacaftor will have even better results than Orkambi in terms of both efficacy and initial pulmonary side effects.Phase 2 clinical trial triple therapy in the Het min patients due out second half of 2017 will become the next major catalyst for Vertex. Any positive non CF drug Phase 2 clinical trial results in cancer, spinal cord injury, influenza, or Alzheimers from Vertex would generate even greater valuation from analysts next year."

"Bluebird BIo just got EU approval to use it's lentihemoglobin gene transfer technology to 'cure' less severe cases of beta thal. Does anyone know if VRTX with it's partnership with CRSPR therapeutics is targeting the most difficult to treat group of beta thal that Bluebird Bio is not seeking approval for? The first treated patient by CRSPR/VRTX (infused at the end of 2018) should have initial read out on efficacy and side effects in the second half of this year. It will be interesting to find out pricing that Bluebird gets for it's treatment, making it possible for analyst to start to estimate value of VRTX/CRSPR treatment if it gets approval as well, assuming similar if not superior efficicacy in the harder to treat population."

"Leiden said Vertex is focused intensely on its business, not on positioning the company as takeover bait for Big Pharma. But he acknowledged the company would have to entertain serious offers. In the end, Leiden said, “shareholders make the decision.” This is the last paragraph of a Boston Globe report on Vertex. This was written before the triple combo news.Leiden could sell the company now that visibility for triple combos' outcome is reasonably clear.http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2017/06/05/vertex-goes-all-its-effort-conquer-cystic-fibrosis/sIUBpbtItPoiyKDsyGcxRP/story.html"

"VRTX kind of moves with biotech indexes, although a bit worse. Today the biotech index IBB was down 3.84%. So VRTX being down 5.02 % is kind of the norm. Unfortunately, it does not help when Leiden and others running this company give themselves lots of options on top of their high salaries and their concentration on CF and not much else do not help the pps any. In addition their announcement of CF drug side effect and patients not taking the drug on regular basis did not help. Unfortunately the stock is now too low to unload, at least for me."

What the heck is with that AP article? VRTX reported a LOSS?? Do they not know how to read?
"Thanks to Reykus 1. As you know, Vertex claims to have a 'small' setback: the FDA wants to see Phase 1 and Phase 2 monotherapy with the main component VX-561 from their CF-triple, once a day. VX-561 is the deuterated version of ivacaftor (brand name Kalydeco). Some commentators from the biotech world see this as an indication that at least an equally large delay will occur in the clinical trials of competitors of Vertex, in particular Galapagos. The FDA will also have to be so strict for others. 2. The Falcon study conducted exclusively by Galapagos in Europe is explicitly mentioned in this context. In this trial potentiator GLPG2451, C1-corrector GLPG2222 and C2-corrector GLPG2737 are tested. Given the limited size of the cohorts, this should never be the prelude to the necessarily much larger phase 3 trial. The FDA should not grant permission for this, no matter what the results may be, due to lack of statistical relevance. Also previous CF trials of Galapagos would include too few patients. 3. Vertex purchased the CFTR-potentiator CTP-656 in 2017 through an 'asset purchase agreement' from Concert Pharmaceuticals and renamed VTX-561. The deuterated molecule would be slowly metabolized in the liver and therefore ideally suited for once-daily administration, where ivacaftor itself must be administered twice a day. Concert reported on the properties: In a Phase 1 cross-over comparison of CTP-656 and Kalydeco, CTP-656 demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared to Kalydeco including a reduced rate of clearance, longer half-life, substantially increased exposure and greater plasma levels at 24 hours. 4. Vertex had previously made the necessary attempts to find a superior potentiometer to be dosed once a day, but did not succeed sufficiently. This is evident simply from the fact that one has chosen - through the purchase of VTX-659 - for the 'quasi conversion' of ivacaftor, a molecule that undoubtedly has obvious, useful clinical properties, but has such a short half-life that twice a day dosing is inevitable. Vertex did not carry out any phase 1 and / or phase 2 research with VX-561 on a stand-alone basis. However, phase 2 studies have been done. This involved an investigation in combination with VX-659 and tezacaftor and one with VX-445 and tezacaftor. 5. Vertex may have hoped that FDA would not require a 'classic' PK / PD and dosing study for the deuterated molecule, but that a simple translation of the ivacaftor data would suffice. In my opinion, that was hoping against better knowledge. I take it for granted that the FDA regards VX-561 as a new chemical entity and wants to know what this molecule performs in a monotherapy and especially how it should be dosed. This requires extensive PK / PD research. Mind you, to my best knowledge, a never-deuterated molecule has been admitted to the market. Logical that the FDA does not want to go ice overnight. Some draw the far-reaching conclusion that competitors of Vertex can not just bring triples to phase 3 without extensive phase 1/2 monotherapy research. Among other things, it is explicitly suggested that the individual components of the Galapagos triple combination therapy have not been adequately studied. 6. In my opinion, two things are mixed up here. Firstly, Vertex's VX-561 is seen by the FDA as an NCE (New Chemical Entity) and must be treated as such, ie in any case phase 1 and (possibly limited) phase 2 research. Secondly: Galapagos has never had any reason or reason to treat their CF molecules as if they were not NCEs."
"For the last 6 months, this has traded at around the same price"
Take a look at the shareholder value this stock has NOT produced the last year. While the rest of the market the last 12 months has been up significantly Vertex has lost value. No dividend a weak pipeline and now they announce a acquisition could be in the future. Leiden turned over the ship in turbulent times and shame on him for doing so !!

It will be Leiden's last presentation as CEO, and Iexpect it will be an inspiring presentation of the successful business he has helped build during his tenure as CEO, and a positive note to bid adieu to the investors at the conference regarding the confidence he has in his replacement, and the path forward for continued growth and success in the VRTX R&D pipeline. Vertex will be providing clinical trial results in for three or four new promising innovative treatments that will provide new hope for patients with serious diseases with limited existing treatment options. The market continues to see VRTX as one of the most innovative and successful growth stories in biotech. (See Michael Yee's comments from the recent Marketwatch article published this past weekend.) Longs should continue to enjoy the ride. Happy Holiays to all."

Wrong information on my previous post. @David thanks for the catch. The headline is displayed in think or swim mobile app under VRTX; Morgan Stanley DID NOT downgrade VRTX
"Here is what I think. I think Leiden and Boger (the original CEO who is still on the Board) should change the the name of this company from Vertex Pharmaceutical to VERTEX UNIVERSITY. That would more properly reflect what Vertex has done throughout its existence. Did lots of research for the sake of research, and other than its initial quick success to co-develop an HIV drug, has taken many years to develop drugs for CF at the expense of bringing other drugs to the market and become profitable. With all the hype about its CF drugs it is still burning cash and there is no telling when it is going to become profitable. It is no wonder analysts and investors are abandoning the stock. Meanwhile, the management keeps giving itself lucrative options, high salaries and are not buying any shares even at these low prices."
"Happy Thanksgiving to all the old timers on this board who have patiently kept their investment in this company and have realized the amazing success it has achieved for patients along the way. CF patients and their families have the most to celebrate of all. What a journey, and CF is only the beginning. The possibilities in gene based therapy, stem cell treatments, in addition to small molecule drug design that VRTX is generating within as well as acquiring from outside the company, will certainly keep this company an engine of innovation and future growth for many years and give hope to countless patients offering transformative or potentially curative treatments for serious diseases with limited treatment options. A lot to give thanks about tomorrow."
We are waiting for the triple combo any moment to be approved.
"Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARWR) today presented preclinical data at the 2019 North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) on ARO-ENaC, an inhaled RNAi therapeutic being developed as a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a rare disease caused by genetic mutations that lead to mucus buildup in the lungs and pancreas. Arrowhead is currently conducting IND/CTA-enabling studies to support regulatory filings in the first half of 2020 for first-in-human studies.Bruce Given, M.D., chief operating officer and head of R&D at Arrowhead, said: “We view the epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, as an exciting target in the treatment of CF and one that is well suited to an RNAi-based intervention. Based on its mechanism of action, ARO-ENaC has the potential to provide clinical benefit to all patients with CF, regardless of genotype, and may prove useful in combination with existing or new CFTR-targeted therapies. The data presented today show that ARO-ENaC can accelerate mucociliary clearance in normal sheep and also preserve airway physiology in a sheep disease model of impaired mucociliary clearance. In addition, animal models indicate that ARO-ENaC can reduce ENaC activity in the lung but avoid impact in the kidney, which has historically been a key safety liability for prior investigational small molecule ENaC inhibitors.”ARO-ENaC is designed to reduce production of the epithelial sodium channel alpha subunit (αENaC) in the airways of the lung. In patients with CF, increased ENaC activity contributes to airway dehydration and reduced mucociliary transport. In CF lung disease, patients can have difficulty breathing and experience frequent and persistent lung infections. Various human genetic studies have validated ENaC as a potential therapeutic target for CF, but the development of inhaled small molecule ENaC inhibitors has been limited by on-target renal toxicity and short duration of action in the lung.Key points presented at NACFC 2019 include the following:Arrowhead's pulmonary epithelial TRiM-enabled delivery platform increased potency of RNAi trigger-mediated silencing of αENaC mRNA, and durably reduced whole lung gene expression in rodentsIn normal sheep, inhaled ARO-ENaC produced dose-dependent acceleration of mucociliary clearance, which is a lung physiology endpoint linked to pulmonary function in patients with CFInhaled ARO-ENaC preserves lung clearance in a sheep disease model of mucostasisARO-ENaC may offer a new renal-sparing, genotype-agnostic therapy for all patients with CF, and exhibiting the potential for an extended duration of action that should minimize treatment burdenArrowhead is also expanding its pulmonary delivery platform to address additional lung disease targets, particularly those that are inaccessible to traditional small molecule or antibody approachesA copy of the poster presentation can be accessed on the Events and Presentations page under the Investors section of the Arrowhead website."

The goal of PRIME is to help patients benefit as early as possible from innovative new therapies that have demonstrated the potential to significantly address an unmet medical need. PRIME designation was granted based on clinical data from CRISPR and Vertex’s ongoing Phase 1/2 trial of CTX001 in patients with severe SCD.About CTX001CTX001 is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients suffering from transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia (TDT) or severe SCD, in which a patient’s hematopoietic stem cells are engineered to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is a form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present at birth, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin. The elevation of HbF by CTX001 has the potential to alleviate transfusion requirements for TDT patients and reduce painful and debilitating sickle crises for SCD patients.Based on progress in this program to date, CTX001 has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, and Orphan Drug designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, for both TDT and SCD.CTX001 is being developed under a co-development and co-commercialization agreement between CRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) and Vertex. CTX001 is the most advanced gene-editing approach in development for TDT and SCD.About CLIMB-111The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-Thal-111, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with TDT. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-121The ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label trial, CLIMB-SCD-121, is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of CTX001 in patients ages 12 to 35 with severe SCD. The trial will enroll up to 45 patients and follow patients for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, CTX001, will then be infused back into the patient as part of a stem cell transplant, a process which involves, among other things, a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing stem cell transplants may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of CTX001. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of CTX001 on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the CRISPR-Vertex CollaborationCRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) and Vertex entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. CTX001 represents the first treatment to emerge from the joint research program. CRISPR Therapeutics ( CRSP ) and Vertex will jointly develop and commercialize CTX001 and equally share all research and development costs and profits worldwide."

"No posts for 19 days so I throw in my 2 cents worth.The problem with VRTX management and thus with VRTX pps could be attributed to investors including hedge funds that are reading in between the lines of VRTX reports and conference call which leave the impression that Leiden is more interested in scientific accomplishments than making VRTX a major profitable company with shareholders' interest first in mind. I was reading the 4 principle metricts that he stated in the Jan earnings report. The third one was:""Third, we're only interested in discovering and developing transformative medicines for serious specialty diseases. Taken together, we believe this will allow us to identify rapid paths for clinical trials and registration just as we have in CF.""One wonders if such a concentration (in transformative medicines for specialty diseases) at the expense of highly used drugs for some of the common diseases that work better than the present ones would not be something VRTX should be aiming at. We must remember that VRTX claims it has the most advanced technology and the best scientists in the world!!"

"""And now two insiders have arguably demonstrated their confidence in the application by making large stock purchases.

Meanwhile chief commercial officer Stuart Arbuckle upped his holding by $330,578 to over $5.7 million.And these insiders aren’t the only financial experts demonstrating bullish sentiment right now.

That’s with an average price target of $217 (25% upside potential).“Vertex put up another very strong quarter (top- / bottom-line beats) with all three cystic fibrosis assets topping expectations” enthused JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov on August 1. “With strong ongoing execution on the CF front, focus continues to turn to the pipeline for the next potential leg of the story. We are finding current stock levels increasingly attractive as 2020 is setting up to be a year of major growth potential both in terms of financial (via early 2020 triple approval) and clinical performance” the analyst told investors."""

Look at the charts. VRTX and REGN are hugely profitable but stock price have been in decline since July 2020. Why is this?
"Importance of VX-561(=CTP-656) in developing one-a-day triple combo tabletsPK for this deuterated ivacaftor is more favorable than Kalydeco; the molecule is slower to move and tumble in the body, and slower in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. This d-Ivacaftor is being tested with VX-445 (+Tez) and VX-659 (+Tex) in triple combos. It is noteworthy that the dosage used for d-Iva is only 50 mg while Kalydeco used in the same trials is 150 mg of Iva. This indicates that Vertex developers are confident that 50 mg of d-Iva (=VX-561) is at least as good as 150 mg of Iva (=Kalydeco) in efficacy and safety. I would say VX-561 is a second generation Kalydeco. It will be certainly safer than Kalydeco."

The same from Orkambi is ~150 K.~6200 effective 508 CFers receive Orkambi and ~2930 receive Kalydeco right now. 240K X 2930 + 150K X 6200 = 703M + 930M = 1.633 B, which is the current rate of revenue from the two drugs.One can extrapolate this to predict what the revenue stream would be like one year after (2019) the launch of Tezacaftor (VX-661).240K X 6000 + 180K X 8000 = 2.9 BAn FDA approval of Kalydeco or Kalydeco/Tez for the residual function and other CFers nearly doubled the Kalydeco taking CFers. The revenue from Tez/Iva also increases from the higher price (180K) of the combo and increase of 508 CFer staying on the drug (safer and 20% higher in the 1st year of launch). The expenditure will be about 1.5 B. 10% of the remaining 1.4 B would go to the CF Foundation. The earning per share is 1400 M X 0.9 / 260 M = $4.85, assuming the share number increases to 260 M. Because the development of 2nd gen correctors, one can give a P/E of 35. Then you get the share price of $170 three years from now. However, I suspect that the averaged rev from Tez/Iva would be much higher than 180K assumed above.If VX-440 is safe and effective as predicted from in vitro measurement and Phase 1, then the triple would be approved five years from now. A revenue of greater than 4 B is possible and share price much greater than 200 is likely."

"I am just wondering what the heck is wrong with VRTX that it has kept going down and down. Are the institutions dumping it and why? Is it because there seems to be no extraordinary catalyst in the near future? Is is because VRTX has concentrated its past efforts mostly on CF and not other products in phase 2 or 3. Frankly, as a long term holder I am losing my patience with VRTX.. I know that some of VRTX diehards may lambast my comments, but that will be ok with me."

It says that it remains blinded to the data.VRTX should be rebounding sharply tomorrow if analysts opine that the above announcement suggests PTI's triple drug CF treatment in Phase 1 clinical trial is likely to show inferiority to VRTX' two triple CF treatments completing Phase 3 clinical trials (and ready for one or them to be submitted for NDA in the first half of 2019) with the potential to treat 90% of CF patients worldwide, with a drug that would likely to improve FEV1 (lung function) three or four times better than existing treatment."

The studies involved found that patients using the Vertex drug combination experienced significant improvement in lung function with mostly mild side effects.Shares were up 21% in early trading Wednesday morning and have now more than doubled so far this year.The ferocious rally will surely tempt some investors to exit. After all, nobody went broke booking a gain, particularly such large ones.

"Here is the big to do about the quarterly report in which apparently investors found negative to unload VRTX:""Today, we are also reporting the initial results for the once-daily potentiator, VX-561, when dosed as part of a triple combination regimen with VX-659 or VX-445 and tezacaftor in people with one minimal function mutation. In these Phase II studies, mean absolute improvements in ppFEV1 of 11.7 and 12.2 percentage points from baseline through week 4 of treatment were observed for the VX-445 and VX-659 triple combination regimens, respectively.The once-daily triple combination regimens were generally well tolerated, and the safety results were consistent with what we have observed in triple combination studies that included ivacaftor. While we believe that the results clearly support the hypothesis that VX-561 has a role in future once-daily triple combinations, the FDA has requested additional dose ranging for VX-561 including potential evaluations of monotherapy before allowing evaluation of VX-561 in late-stage development. We look forward to updating you on our progress with our triple combination regimens as we advance these programs.""So they have done phase 2 with VX-561 and the results are great. However, the FDA is considering 561as a new molecule, even though it is a slightly modified version of Kalydeco and they want a mono trial for its safety which should not take too long to do. Once that is done they move to phase III. I am not sure if this would cause a delay in the start of phase Sot"

"Seeing good movement in price, which bodes well for the rest of the year. New markets will be opening up soon, which will push VRTX over $350 by year's end."

And if they dont complete one of the phases.the stock will drop in half
This could easily pop 20 points. Shorts sitting in a volcano.
They try to hold it down as they accumulate. ..sneaky thieves
There is always a delayed reaction to VRTX beating the numbers. We may get a modest rise tomorrow tempered by option expiration day and next week we will see the buyers coming in so long as the market is not crashing. VRTX never behaves like a FANG stock in a predictable way.

"Wondering what longs, like me, think VRTX share price will be after “the triple” gets approved? $250+/share seems reasonable simply based upon the increase in patients using the new combo vs Kalydeco, Orkambi or Symdeko."
Any thoughts from this board's old timers on the significance of Leiden's retirement announcement and the promotion of the CMO to CEO starting April 2020? IMO the fact he is staying on as executive chairman reflects he is not interested in the day to day operations and it's probably better to have a younger motivated excecutive who has proven her skills at the company to run the complex operations of a rapidly growing company.

In a note out Thursday evening, Citi Research analyst Mohit Bansal put his money on Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the up-and-comer that analysts can’t say enough good things about.“VRTX could be the next entry in the $100B market cap club,” Bansal wrote. “VRTX appears miles ahead of others given its growth profile and reasonable valuation despite growth.”"

"H.C. Wainwright raises their VRTX tgt to $295 from $270. Analyst Andrew Fein said, ""With continued Trikafta launch in the U.S. for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients ages 12 and older that have at least one F508del mutation, we note the company estimates the majority of the approximately 18,000 currently eligible patients in the U.S. have initiated therapy. While management points out this includes new initiations as well as those patients transitioning from other Vertex therapies, we believe such transitions are not detrimental to the platform's overall commercial momentum. Most importantly, we point out this traction has occurred despite the larger context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, with management emphasizing an absence of impact on supply chain continuity. While we further discuss pipeline impact below, including paused screening and enrollment, we note key expansion opportunities in CF continue forward, specifically including: (1) ongoing review for triple combination approval in the EU for patients age 12 and older with at least one F508del mutation; (2) planned triple combination sNDA submission to the FDA in 2H20 for children ages 6-11 years old with at least one F508del mutation, pending readout from the fully enrolled Phase 3 trial, which we note could potentially address earlier stages of disease development; and (3) recent Kalydeco submissions for approval in infants ages 4 to less than 6 months old in both the U.S. and Europe, which we note would build upon its current approval in infants age 6 months."""
"Despite beating EPS and rev estimates, VRTX stock price will likely remain stable. I expect the stock to trade sideways in the short term as it did for the past 3 months. The data form vrtx 864 phase II trial against Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) Deficiency, wich will be released later this quarter, will have a strong impact on the stock price. The general sentiment for this trial to succeed seems quite pessimistic. The stock might have a lot of negative news priced in already. Investors should also keep an eye on milestones of potential competitor drugs for VRTX´s Cystic Fibrosis assests such as Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals ARO-ENaC (currently in phase I/II) and Roches TMEM16A potentiator (pre-clinical)."

"VX-984, a DNA-PK inhibitor, licensed back from MerckThis compound will be useful in accurate CRSPR gene-editing because VX-984 stops the repair by NHEJ (non-homologous end-joining) double-strand DNA breaks created by CRSPR/Cas9. The NHEJ is an error-prone repair mechanism.About one year ago, Merck KGaA paid Vertex $230 million upfront for the rights to four cancer programs. One of the compounds was VX-984. Now, Vertex needs this compound to gene-edit DNAs of patients with SCD, beta-thalassemia, and CF,"

"Next VRTX investor presentation Wed Sept 28 at Leerink with Geoff Porges hosting should be almost as confrontational as the highly anticipated upcoming first presidential debate between HRC and Trump. Given the opinions Porges published yesterday and quoted in Barrons. I think he is pushing for a company like GILD to make a bid for Vertex, and using management missteps to generate interest by 'frustrated' investors for a sale of the company. What price per share would it take to get VRTX investors to accept VRTX an unsolicited buyout?"

"Deutche Bank analyst once again raising speculation about M&A possiblities for VRTX next year with a larger pharma needing an advanced pipeline with both immediate as well as long term growth potential. VRTX is clearly the most profitable target with this kind of pipeline. Given the advancement of both CF and non CF pipeline candidates it's amazing to me the company has not yet had a serious offer. $205/share seems cheap relative to the projected revenue from CF plus all the rest of the VRTX pipeline. DB analyst gave the probability of a VRTX M&A in 2018 at 20%. In my opinion, if the tax reform bill passes, the probability of a takeover offer are much higher. JP Morgan may be the timing for such a proposal the week of Jan 8. Should be a very exciting 2018 for VRTX investors whether an M&A offer materializes or not."

"Mean absolute improvement in ppFEV1 of 14.3 percentage points from baseline through week 24 of treatment compared to placebo (p<0.0001) in patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation--Statistically significant improvements observed in all key secondary endpoints in patients with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation, including a 63% reduction in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations compared to placebo (p<0.0001)--Submission of a New Drug Application in the U.S. planned for the third quarter of 2019 followed by a Marketing Authorization Application in the EU in the fourth quarter of 2019-Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX) today announced that it has selected the triple combination of the next-generation corrector VX-445 (elexacaftor), tezacaftor and ivacaftor to submit for potential global regulatory approvals for people ages 12 and older with cystic fibrosis (CF). Final data announced today from a 24-week Phase 3 study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and from a 4-week Phase 3 study in people with two F508del mutations will form the basis of these submissions. Vertex previously announced that both of these Phase 3 studies met their primary endpoints, and the company today announced the final results of these studies, including results for key secondary endpoints and safety data.In each study, treatment with the VX-445 triple combination regimen resulted in statistically significant improvements in all key secondary endpoints. Data from the 24-week study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation showed a mean absolute improvement in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) of 14.3 percentage points from baseline (p<0.0001) and a 63% reduction in the annualized rate of pulmonary exacerbations (p<0.0001) through week 24 in patients who received the VX-445 triple combination regimen compared to those who received triple placebo. The VX-445 triple combination regimen was generally well tolerated across the two Phase 3 studies. In the study in people with one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation, 2 and 0 patients, respectively, who received the VX-445 triple combination or triple placebo discontinued treatment due to adverse events. There were no discontinuations for adverse events in either arm of the study in people with two F508del mutations.Vertex plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the third quarter of 2019 and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the fourth quarter of 2019 based on these data in people with CF ages 12 years and older who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation and in people with two F508del mutations.“The substantial improvements in lung function and other measures of CF seen in these Phase 3 studies are unprecedented and represent a defining moment in the journey to provide medicines that treat the underlying cause of CF to the vast majority of people with CF,” said Steven M. Rowe, M.D., M.S.P.H., Director of the Gregory Fleming James Cystic Fibrosis Research Center, University of Alabama at Birmingham and co-chair of Vertex's Triple Combination Steering Committee.“People with CF who have one F508del mutation and one minimal function mutation are the largest remaining group of CF patients without a treatment option for the underlying cause of their disease. The final Phase 3 data announced today represent a significant step toward bringing a disease modifying medicine to these patients, as well as toward providing significantly enhanced benefits to patients with two F508del mutations,” said Reshma Kewalramani, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex. “We could not have achieved this important milestone without the support of the entire CF community, and we are particularly grateful to those who participated in the triple combination clinical trials. We now look forward to completing our regulatory submissions with the aim of bringing the VX-445 triple combination regimen to as many patients as possible.”"

Vertex's revenue and earnings continue to soar on the strength of its three approved CF drugs. It has an even bigger winner on the way with its triple drug combo.

"Vertex has some nice stuff, but the reality is that if they want to be a major player in the future, the company should purchase one of the gene editors sooner rather than later.

An approximate revenue is the algebraic product of CF drug prices and number of people taking them; 193 K X 75 K X 0.9 X 0.5 = 6,514 MM.The drug price 193 K was calculated from the averaged current revenue from all three CF drugs assuming that the triple combo will be priced at the average price of current drugs. The 2018 Q4 revenue from CF drugs was 868 MM and the number of people taking the drugs was 18 K. So, the average revenue per person was: 868 MM X 4 / 18 K = 193 K. This is a good averaged effective price for the drugs; the prices in the US would be higher than other regions.The number of people taking them is computed by multiplying potential CFers 75 K X 90% times the fraction of people actually taking the drugs 50%. This figure 50% would be conservative considering the enthusiasm for the triples and Kalydeco.To compute the approximate earnings and share price, we need to estimate the expenditure. The current cost for R&D + SG&A is 1.97 B, but the annual increase for the cost is 0.15 B. I would say that the cost three years from now would be 2.4 B. We have to subtract the 10% royalty to the CF Foundation and the income tax which I would conservatively assume a 30%. (6.51 B – 2.4 B) X 0.9 X 0.7 = 2.59 BSo, the earnings per share would be assuming the share number increases to 270 MM: 2.59 B / 270 MM = $ 9.6If the pain medication and AAT programs go successfully, we may have to give a P/E of 50 or greater. Then, we may see a price near 500. This estimate does not take into account a possible success of gene-editing programs."

"https://www.barrons.com/articles/drug-price-legislation-2020-election-trump-senate-house-pelosi-51569417617?mod=hp_LEAD_2[[ With the 2020 election ticking closer and an impeachment process likely to suck up the remaining oxygen in Washington in the coming months, experts say time may have run out for drug-price legislation.Worries about federal government efforts to place limits on drug prices have depressed biotech and pharmaceutical stocks in recent months, as President Donald Trump and the Democrats have been in rare accord in supporting limits on drug prices.Despite a handful of proposals on the table, though, the time to get a bill through before the 2020 election may have passed.“There is a lot of industry spin around this right now, but that notwithstanding, it is very unlikely were are going to see major legislation go through” in the near term, said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, a health-care consulting firm, and a former official in the Office of Management and Budget during the Clinton administration.In a note out Wednesday morning, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams also wrote that significant near-term policy changes seem unlikely, citing an interview with an unnamed health-care policy expert.“Too little, too late, for federal [government] action,” Abrahams wrote. “With the general election little more than a year away and other items on politicians’ agendas, [our expert] expects parties to focus more on optics than on effecting real changes.”Various proposals to limit drug prices have been put forward in recent months, including one from the Senate Finance Committee and one from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. President Trump has also pushed the issue. The S&P 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotech & Life Sciences industry group is down 6.1% over the past 12 months, while the broader S&P 500 is up 2.4%. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (ticker: IBB) is down 15% over the same period, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 1.8%.Drug companies have been fighting the pricing legislation, as The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, with industry trade groups spending millions on ads opposing various legislative and regulatory efforts.Their efforts may be working. In his note, Abrahams wrote that significant policy changes were unlikely in the near term.Of the Senate Finance Committee bill, which Abrahams characterizes as “moderate,” he said that Senate Republicans oppose some aspects. “As such, short of a push by President Trump...it appears unlikely that Sen. Majority Leader McConnell would risk the potential embarrassment of bringing a bill, which would require substantial fleshing out and revision anyway, to a vote.”The Pelosi bill, Abrahams said, will likely pass the House, but fail to pass the Republican-controlled Senate. And while Trump has pressed the drug-price issue, Abrahams said the president is unlikely to place it “at the top of his agenda.”“While our [expert] felt given his predilection for negotiations President Trump may actually be inclined to support Pelosi’s House bill, given the optics around cooperation—especially now, in our view, with an impeachment investigation initiated—we believe this potentially highest-risk scenario for drugmakers is very unrealistic,” Abrahams wrote.Mendelson said that Democrats likely don’t want the drug-price issue resolved before the election. “I think that given the differences in the views of the [Democratic] caucus right now...I don’t see them coming to a full consensus on a bill.”He said some minor near-term changes were possible, such as a restructuring of Medicare Part D that would lower copays—a measure supported by drug companies. “That would be less about drug pricing and more about affordability for seniors,” he said.With near-term pressure relieved, the focus will turn to the postelection outlook. Members of both parties, in debates and policy discussions, highlight the issue as urgent, and many of the candidates would likely push for legislation if elected.”The central issue is affordability,” Mendelson said. “And they are not going to solve that before the 2020 election.”]]"

"Updates by QdelfanA superb analysis of current status by Qdelfan. It was hidden in this new Yahoo board ""replies"". I take the liberty to bring it up. Glad to connect again with the 'old' VRTX chat board regulars despite what Yahoo has done to it's old discussion board format. I agree the data readout has been so slow, stoking concern by some investors voiced at the Leerink investor conference that the delay implied some kind of problem with second generation corrector candidates in Phase 1 clinical trials. Ian Smith's answer which was basically, ""We'll let you know in a press release when we have finished analysis of the data""(for the two candidates being tested over the past year in phase one trials to use in combination with VX 661 and Ivacaftor for possible treatment of the most difficult to treat CF mutations in a triple drug treatment regimen). I speculate that the fact there are two candidates to choose from creates a challenge for management to choose which of the two should be advanced to phase 2 trials to keep R&D costs down. ie they need to pick wisely in terms of likelihood of clinical efficacy and safety (The challenge being if the data is not that much different between the two choices slight theoretical difference need to be discerned based on the clinical and in vitro trials and then make one's best educated choice between the two and that is a time consuming process). I believe it's likely that we will hear about their final choice and the initiation of 3 drug clinical trials by the end of the month at either the 3rd quarter conference call or at an investor conference at the NACF meeting occurring the same week.I am hopeful that the phase 3 trial data for 661 and ivacaftor will yield superior results to Orkambi, allowing those patients not tolerating or benefiting sufficiently from Orkambi, a better alternative. Hopefully the non-CF drug candidates will get some announcements about their clinical trial progress as well, and a timeline as to when we can expect to hear about their prospects for advancing them into pivotal clinical trials which will likely add value to the company's stock price in the eyes of the analysts. My other observation that I speculate is hopeful, is that except for Josh Boger, there has been very little insider selling of stock options throughout the year as the biotech stocks have been taken down because of the political rhetoric of the presidential election. To me that suggests confidence by insiders about the growth prospects for Vertex. I suspect the fears over pricing are overblown for breakthrough drugs treating orphan diseases, and after the election the inherent value of the drugs will continue to be the predominant mechanism to establish prices for new drugs, and only price raises for older established and generic drugs that have already recouped their R&D investment by pharmaceutical companies will be the focus of any attempts at price controls (and a republican house majority will likely even slow that process). Here's to hoping for a better 2017, and I hope to hear your assessment of the data after the clinical trial data release I expect at the end of this month. Q"

why is this stock in complete downtrend ?
"[[Vertex Pharmaceuticals, which specializes in cystic fibrosis drugs, recently traded 29.5% below its mean target price. Long an investor darling, Vertex stock fell last October, when the company announced that a drug meant to treat a lung-and-liver disorder known as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency had failed in a trial, and would be discontinued. Investors had seen the drug as key to Vertex’s growth, and have yet to return.Yet, analysts see promise in Vertex. Not only is its cystic-fibrosis franchise strong, with patent protections lasting into the 2030s, but it has a compelling pipeline—including another alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency drug now in Phase 2 trials.Cowen analyst Phil Nadeau has called Vertex a top large cap pick for 2021. “We expect Vertex to recover in 2021 and would use the recent weakness to build a position in this premier biotech,” he wrote in an early March note.]]https://www.barrons.com/articles/here-are-5-undervalued-biopharma-stocks-51615996139"

"Get lost, punk!"
"You may be wondering how a new triple can beneficially treat 90% of all CF patients. Vertex uses the number 68K for the target population. 68K is indeed 90% of 75K which are all CF patients in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia (if you include Latin America, more than 75K).CF is a recessive disease. By that, both alleles (remember that there are a pair of chromosomes) of CFTR gene must have mutation to have CF symptoms. All CF patients who have 508 mutation at least in one allele of CFTR gene (and another mutation in the other allele) constitute 70% of all in the major markets excluding Latin America. So, the chance that a CF patient has a 508 mutation in one allele of CFTR is 0.70. Then, the chance of a CFer to have 508 mutation in both alleles (= homozygous 508 CF) is 0.7 X 0.7 = 0.49. This means that the homozygous 508 patients constitute 49% of all CFers. They can benefit from Orkambi, Tez/Iva, or by any of triples.The chance of a CFer to have a heterozygous 508 mutation (508 in one allele, but another mutation on the other allele) is 2 X 0.7 X (1 - 0.7) = 2 X 0.7 X 0.3 = 0.42. ""2"" in front comes from the fact that there are two alleles; allele 1 can have 508 and the other has another, and allele 2 has 508 and the allele 1 has the other mutation. This means that 42% of all CF patients have heterozygous 508 mutation. Therefore, 49% + 42% = 91% of all CF patients are either homozygous or heterozygous 508 patients. All of them can benefit from a tripleHowever, not all of them NEED a triple. More than 10% of CF patients can get by with Ivacafter or with Tez/Iva. Nonetheless, the other 32% are so-called Het-min patients who can only benefit from a triple."

Up 5% after hours!!! Something is brewing!
VRTX has been on my watchlist for a while now. I have been waiting for a sell off like today to start building a position. Financials are solid. Company is debt free and well run. These setbacks are expected in the drug discovery business and guides future successes. I started a position at $215.
Why is there so much insider selling? 1382 insider sales since 2003. And zero insider buying. Is it the remuneration structure?
I suggest the shorts to cover their position shoring between $165 to $167 today and go long.

Best acquisition Vertex can make in all of biotech.CRSP is a prized co who already has cure for Sickle cell disease.
"It is just amazing.""The therapy works by editing genes found inside blood stem cells that affect the production of hemoglobin made by newborn babies. The natural process is good for most people, allowing the body to start making adult hemoglobin. For patients with beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease, however, their adult hemoglobin is flawed.Doctors extract the patients’ stem cells and send them to a manufacturing facility where they are edited. The patients are given chemotherapy to wipe out their immune systems and make room for the transformed cells. The edited cells are then infused back into the patients."""

I don't understand what Mr Market is doing with this stock. Great product. Market leader in CF. Highly profitable with a more diversified pipeline of drugs. Working closely with CRSPR. There's no reason why this stock is not having any momentum. Wallstreet bets should YOLO $VRTX and crush the shorts
VRTX is down -4.94% to 158.02
I guess we are going to stick around this support level until the earnings.
"Sellers and shorts seem to be in charge. Maybe VRTX should consider buying its own share for as cheap as they are with its cash hoard and the $2B credit facility rather than doing nothing as it is doing.

"het antwoord op vragen van de Vertex aanhangere Geof Porges: So regarding the first part of your question, the thromboembolic event rates with baracitinib, the most recent data that we have shown was a presentation at ACR late last year by Mark Genovese, which is an oral presentation. Now this is just from the DARWIN 1, 2, and 3 extension studies, where we have about 1,700 patient years of exposure, but that rate was very low, only one patient in that presentation who had both a DVT and a PE. So the rate actually in that presentation was 0.06 per 100 patient years. But, Geoff, so far we've got thousands of patients in Phase 3. We've got a relatively small data set in terms of exposure, but that's what we have said so far. We continue to collect all of that information. The other point to raise about this was the discussion recently at the Advisory Committee and whether this is slightly or partly related to JAK-2. As you know, filgotinib is very selective for JAK-1. And in terms of JAK-2 specificity, we don't have that at all. So we don't see any changes in hemoglobin. When we see positive changes in hemoglobin, we don't see any increase in platelets. In fact, we see a small decrease in platelets. Whether or not that's related to thromboembolic phenomena, we don't know. And then I believe our fledgling programs that are now developing in full force in inflammation, with filgotinib in multiple diseases are becoming differentiated, exciting, and heading in the right direction, particularly with things such as the Verily collaboration."

"Here is Michael Yee's take on today's data from VRTX ( IMO, If PTI's early triple data disappoints, VRTX will exceed $200/share before year end)Subject: Vertex (VRTX, BUY): Phase III Triple at High-end of Expectations and is Important De-risking EventReply-To: ""Michael J. Yee"" Vertex (VRTX): Phase III Triple at High-end of Expectations and is Important De-risking EventRating BUYPrice Target $210.00Price $167.40Bloomberg NASDAQ: VRTXKey TakeawayPhase III triple data looks strong on efficacy and we expect the stock to bounce back up as the de-risking event removes a downside risk scenario.VRTX stock has been down recently along with the broader market as people trimmed going into the Phase III readout which had high expectations. To be clear, the study was generally already expected to be positive and in the current market environment investors felt there was a high bar to impress. Today, VRTX met or exceeded that high bar and matched the high-end of efficacy expectations, and since the stock has been down in front of it, we think it will bounce back, setting the course and pace to perhaps triple or quadruple earnings power over the next five years. VRTX is the only big growth story in large-cap biotech, making it a scarce equity and a name we recommend investors own in the current environment, given no major generic or biosimilar risks like some of its peers.Phase III in the all-important het-min (heterozygous) study showed positive stat sig (p<0.0001) FEV1 improvement of +14% vs pbo (+13% drug vs -1% pbo). This is the high end of the efficacy range of results that were shown in Phase II (e.g. 9%-14% amongst the various triples). No safety details were disclosed as the study remains ongoing for longer-term follow-up, but we believe results are likely clean enough in the big picture and are not concerned about this. '659 was also the one that had a relatively clean and pristine safety/tolerability profile in Phase II versus '445 triplet which had a billirubin case and more ALT increases. Phase III results for '445 will read out in Q1:19, and the study has completed enrollment and is yet another shot on goal that will likely have similar efficacy and perhaps relatively similar safety profile. Note today's '659 data appear to have a cleaner safety profile with similar efficacy and slightly better sweat chloride data than '445, so we predict this is probably the one they take forward - if we had to guess.In homozygous which is a market already well penetrated by Orkambi and Symdeko, this triple of '659 is meant to significantly improve FEV efficacy from a current +4% to +14%, which is a huge improvement and benefit for patients and will eventually replace Orkambi/Symdeko over time and creates a huge barrier to entry given the overall efficacy/safety profile of '659 in this population. The Phase III data today showed +10% added efficacy over the doublet alone (Symdeko). Thus, this yields a total +14% for the overall triple in homozygous patients. Note other competitors such as PTI are trying to show some triple data in homozygous patients, and the bar is fairly high, given VRTX is significantly years ahead in development and shows pristine safety profile and high +14% efficacy.The bear case is today's positive data was generally expected (but it is a de-risking event) and PTI (small market cap of $270M) will have preliminary data in Q4 on their proprietary triple using a slightly different mechanism of an amplifier. That company filed a shelf this week as well. Again, we think the bar is pretty high for PTI although investors point to +6% efficacy (+8% vs pbo) with their doublet in a small number of patients, which is modestly better than Orkambi/ Symdeko but arguably not clinically meaningful and the bar is very high for the triple to ultimately get to +14%"

At an investor presentation this past Tuesday, Kewalramani said that Vertex intended sometime this year to begin a Phase 3 trial of what she called a “next gen” cystic fibrosis drug, which could be more effective than its current products.

"Is Vertex a perfect fit for Gilead? Porges says 'yes'. Barrons' article is here.We haven't heard much about Gilead Sciences (GILD) recently, as the biotech company fell out of favor with investors. But with Gilead shares on the move recently--they've gained 9.2% so far in June--analysts are once again asking what it will take to get a sustained move going.Illustration: Getty Images/iStockphotoThe arrow is stopping on M&A. With its hepatitis-C business slowing, Gilead ""needs a transformational acquisition soon to prop up its falling revenue and growth outlook,"" claim Leerink's Geoffrey Porges and Bradley Canino. They explain why Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) makes the perfect target for Gilead: In our view, VRTX’s rare-disease portfolio and robust pipeline would satisfy all the critical attributes for a meaningful acquisition for Gilead - Shortage, Size, Security and Synergy. Gilead currently has ~$32bn in cash and a leverage ratio of ~1.2x, suggesting that the company has the potential to comfortably make a transformative acquisition such as Vertex. Our preliminary merger analysis indicates that an acquisition of VRTX in the range of typical premia of 20-40% ($153-178/share) would prove to be meaningfully accretive to Gilead in the long run with an internal rate of return of ~8-10% for Gilead’s shareholders.Shares of Gilead Sciences are little changed at $70.85 at 9:33 a.m. this morning, while Vertex Pharmaceuticals has gained 1.9% to $129.61.

"Vertex made the final payment to Concert Pharma to own VX-561(deuterated Kalydeco). With this purchase it is possible to dose almost 90% of CF patients with an once-a-day pill. A deuterated Kalydeco metabolizes more slowly compared to a kalydeco pill, and it maintains therapeutic exposure for a longer time. So, the CFers don't have to take Kalydeco twice a day. VX-121/Tezacaftor/VX-561 will be a once-a-day pill."

Her success in these activities, rather than in clinical development, will determine whether Vertex has another phase of growth in its future….Vertex suggested to us that Dr Kewalramani has built strong relationships inside the company during her relatively short tenure at the company, and she brings to the position the physician-scientist profile that the company was seeking during its search for Leiden’s successor. We certainly believe that profile has the highest probability of future success of the other standard industry CEO prototypes (commercial, legal, financial, operational), but the experience of leading and executing large clinical trials is not necessarily evidence of preparedness for the complexity of leading a large public company."

$SRPT vs $VRTX - Rough ComparisonJust some observations and admittedly not an apples to apples comparison but I see a lot of similarities between Sarepta and Vertex. Just some food for thought:VRTX:Kalydeco launched in the beginning of 2012 (US 1st then EU approval in July)Has a roughly ~4000 patient pool (per 10/16 investor presentation and I'm assuming that's worldwide)CF incidence is estimated at around 1/25002012 rev: $171m2013 rev: $371.3m2014 rev: $463.8m2014 MC (as of 12/30/14): $29.7b (2014 was the 1st year that almost ALL revs were derived from Kalydeco)It's hard to assess VRTX MC before 2014 because it still included considerable revs from Incivek and I really wanted to focus on Kalydeco vs EteplirsenNOV 2015 (EU) and SEP (2016) Approval of OrkambiOrkambi dramatically increased the patient pool adding an additional ~25k patientsNext-gen correctors entered clinic in Nov '16 and just recently (July) released positive dataSRPT:Exondys 51 launched end of 2016 (US only)Has a potential ~1000 to ~1200 patient pool?

While CF has roughly 2x the patient population as DMD I feel like SRPT pipeline is much more advanced at this point in time than VRTX was even 3 years into the launch of Kalydeco. I feel like it's only a matter of time before the MC accurately reflects SRPT current (and future) position Reply · Report Post

"My opinion about 200+ COVID-19 stocks. There can be only 1-3 big winners in that space. $PFE is developing a vaccine with Oxford university and according to experts it seems to have the best potential. They have done the monkey testing by the book (haven't skipped it like all others) and they have now started the human testing. In monkey tests $PFE COVID vaccine prevented virus from entering to the lungs, it could save people from the most serious form of COVID. Although it didn't prevent virus entering the throat. Not a perfect solution. This shows how complicated it is to develop an effective COVID vaccine. That's one reason why i am not invested in direct COVID plays like $INO $VRTX etc. When some of the big players get they vaccines ready, other smaller COVID stocks will drop like a rock.

trading at quite a premium here.
"Some of these comments by shorts are hilarious. It's as if they have never looked at a 6 month or one year chart, which show how powerfully this stock has performed. Who would dare to short this stock? Short it if you want, but you will be badly burned."
Can some wise folk tell me why this stock doing so well is down on earning beat???
"new here. First thing I see to do is MUTE a few names that just post useless info. and fill up the board to hear themselves speak. Good looking numbers with all that cash, and very high ebitda versus revenue. All good. Of course, investors know this and now expensive based on PE ratio and PEG. Still....very nice company. Safe. Would rather be in a bit bigger company with more diversified portfolio of drugs paying a dividend.....and/or a cheaper stock with just one product that has more potential to move the needle...even though very risky. so for now am in both kinds.....AMGN and AMRN. But thinking of adding some here right between the two. Very safe."
Looks like pti might be takeing vrtx's place
"CRAZY MARKETS. UP, DOWN. UP DOWN. UP DOWN."
Just another clown analyst is trying to bring the price down so his clients will cover their shorts and go long before the blow out!
Not much life in it this morning despite the European approval. May be nervous for tomorrow's data!
"I can, knowing that there is good news and we will start buying more, the big boys come out and bet on a decline, then they profit and we lose"
"I give up with VRTX, I'm out. This trades like a tech stock for some reason on down days and doesn't benefit from the upside on rallies."

What's nextJP Morgan presentation the week of Jan 7 will lay out guideline for when to expect clinical trial results in both CF and non CF assets and NDA filings for triple CF regimen selected for submission.Conservative revenue and eps guidance for the year likely to be announced at the same time.Initiation of AAT and FSG clinical trials will likely be announced broadening the clinical pipeline to provide breakthrough treatments for other serious diseases without effective treatments for underlying cause of the disease. Fourth quarter earnings conf call end of Jan likely to beat analyst estimates with rapid adoption of symdeko

"https://www.barrons.com/articles/mrna-is-the-next-frontier-in-treating-disease-but-will-it-work-51567205845?mod=hp_HEROThis weekend's Barrons Cover Story presents current status of mRNA therapy pursued by Vertex/Moderna collaboration and a serious competitor Translate Bio. For people who do not subscribe Barrons I quote a few passages from the Cover Story.[[Last year, one gene-therapy pioneer resigned from the scientific advisory board of a company over concerns about the risks posed by high doses of the virus used to deliver gene therapies. Other scientists have debated whether that virus could inadvertently integrate its own DNA into a patient’s chromosome, causing cancer.Some experts say these fears leave mRNA looking like a safer option. If a gene therapy goes wrong, there is no turning it off; mRNA, on the other hand, is dosed like a normal drug, so it can be stopped if it causes side effects. Plus, mRNA stays out of the nucleus, reducing the risk of accidental integration.“It is transient, which should clearly be safer,” said Philip Santangelo, a professor in the department of biomedical engineering at Georgia Tech who has received research grants from two of the mRNA companies. “It is easier to deliver than DNA, in many respects, because it only has to get to the cytosol,” or main body of the cell, and not into the nucleus itself.]]...[[ The Translate drug now in multiple-dose trials treats cystic fibrosis, a debilitating genetic lung disease. In late July, the company released data on the single-dose portion of the same trial. Analysts said the results were promising, but the stock fell 11% on the day of the release.]]The data showed a poor dose-response at best. Open the link below and read FEV1 changes at 24 mg dose vs. 8 mg dose.https://investors.translate.bio/news-releases/news-release-details/translate-bio-announces-interim-results-phase-12-clinical-trial[[“It is encouraging, but early,” said Josh Schimmer, an analyst who covers the stock for Evercore ISI. “Ultimately, more data are going to be required to discern how much of this was signal, how much of this was noise.” Translate said it will release results from the multidose portion of the trial next year, and will present some additional safety data on the single ascending dose portion of the trial at a cystic fibrosis conference that starts in late October.One of the reasons that investors like the mRNA companies is that the biological mechanisms they are targeting are generally well understood. The question around Translate’s cystic fibrosis drug, for example, isn’t whether it is instructing lung cells to make the correct protein, but rather whether it can make enough of the protein, and if it can do so safely.That thinking is key to Moderna’s strategy. If the science shows that what the drugs are trying to do should work, then maybe all it takes to get a result is to try it again and again.“There are so many shots on goal,” said Edward Tenthoff, an analyst who covers the stock for Piper Jaffray.Moderna is taking those shots from a factory in Norwood, Mass., where, in December 1994, Polaroid built its 150 millionth instant camera. Today, the facility is the showpiece of Moderna, which raised $604 million from its initial public offering late last year. Moderna’s framing of the outlook for mRNA therapies is binary: It is going to be huge, or it is going to be nothing.Company executives, needless to say, are banking on the former.“There’s no scientifically plausible way where this entire technology will only yield one drug or one vaccine,” said Tal Zaks, the company’s Israel-born chief medical officer, sitting in his small office in Cambridge, Mass. “It just doesn’t make sense. If it works for an application like a vaccine, it should work for more than one. That was what got all of us who joined here really excited.”In 2016, the health-care news organization STAT reported that a “caustic work environment” at Moderna had “driven away top talent.” The company’s CEO, Stéphane Bancel, had built a “culture of recrimination,” and a large number of senior executives had left, according to the report.At the time, Bancel acknowledged that the company had been an “intense place,” but said he had worked to address the criticisms of his leadership. Moderna now said that its turnover over the past 12 months is below the industry average, citing external data.Those concerns didn’t keep the company from attaining a market value of $6.1 billon after its first day as a public company, in December 2018. After a selloff, the company now has a market capitalization of $5 billion, with cash and investments worth a total of $1.4 billion. Moderna reported quarterly revenue of $13.1 million in early August, and a net loss for the quarter of $135.1 million.Without earnings, its valuation is difficult to measure, but Wall Street analysts have set an average price target of $30.25 on the stock, according to FactSet, ...]]"

Would think bar is high on future discussions between VRTX and the FDA even if VX-864 is moderately positive, since ARO-AAT (Arrowhead / Takeda siRNA drug) is now showing it can reverse fibrosis (see liver biopsy results in their open label study that parallels Sequioa)."

"Outside of CF, we have clinical development efforts ongoing across five different diseases and expect important clinical data readouts from multiple programs in 2020. In our AAT program, we have completed evaluation of single and multiple ascending doses of our first small molecule corrector, VX-814 in healthy volunteers.Based on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data from the study, we have decided to advance VX-814 into a Phase II dose-ranging study in AAT patients who have 2 Z mutations. We expect to obtain clinical data from our AAT program in people with two Z mutations in 2020.And consistent with our approach of developing a portfolio of multiple potential medicines in each of our programs, we have also recently advanced a second AAT corrector, VX-864 into Phase I development; both VX-814 and VX-864 have received Fast-Track Designation from the FDA.In pain, we have established proof-of-concept for NaV1.8 inhibition in multiple Phase II studies in acute, neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain conditions. We have identified a number of selective NaV1.8 inhibitors and our plan is to obtain clinical data from multiple compounds in order to choose the best molecule or molecules to advance into late-stage developments. We announced today that we are initiating a Phase I study of a novel NaV1.8 inhibitor, VX-961.In sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, we've now dose two patients in our hemoglobinopathies program with our partner, CRISPR Therapeutics, using the novel gene-editing therapy, CTX001. The first sickle cell patient was dosed in the middle of this year which follows the first patient with beta-thalassemia who was dosed in the first quarter of the year."

"I am long this stock however when does a CEO come out and announce he or she wants to make a transformative acquisition in the near future ?? When she is desperate to hold onto share holders , that's when. I should have sold in April when Leiden promoted her to CEO.

Measure her performance since April 2020 in terms of shareholder value and then you decide on your own if you want to own this company."

Pretty positive data announcement with CRSP. Huge.
Vertex is partner with CRSP which won a Nobel prize for chemistry for Gene editing. VRTX and CRSp are partners on Sickle cell disease gene editing drug which is a 10 Billion dollar drug. Vertex will buy CRSP in my opinion for stock and cash for $250 a share.It will more than make up for HAE drug.
VRTX is flashing a strong bullish signal today. Trending up in a strong bearish headwind.
Still an opp to get in. It went down due to the health sector gains and some Trump announcement that doesn’t affect VRTX much!
Time to load up more at this price. Holding the risk
Please compare vrtx to pti in cystic fibrosis care.how close are they
"Two weeks ago the New England Journal of Medicine published two papers which describes results of TEZ/IVA trials, EXPAND and EVOLVE.

This was taken down by institutions and hedge funds so that they could buy the stock cheaply. Earnings are out soon and this will be heading back up. It is unbelievable that the SEC does not see through this.
"""During the most recent 90-day period, previous to the date of this filing, there have been 67 insider transactions reported to the SEC for Vertex Pharmaceuticals ( VRTX Loading...Loading...). These transactions came from the activities of 12 separate insiders that resulted in a net acquisition of 163,919 company shares. Relative to the preceding 90-day window of time, there were 9 transactions from 5 insiders which resulted in the net acquisition of 14,822 shares.This represents a higher level of transactions than the peer group average for the 324-company Bio Therapeutic Drugs peer group over the last 90-day period. Activity in the peer group averaged 59.3 transactions per company, with company insiders acquiring on average 36,166 shares."""
"Congratulations to longs for their patience. Teza/Ivacaftor submissiion probably coming soon along with rest of pending triple combo clinical trial data, vx 371/orkambi trial and eventually non-cf pipeline clinical trial data in pain oncology cervical spine injury and phase 3 influenza trial results. With each trial that shows positive results, or additional government regulatory approvals for payment the stock has room to run even higher"

Holy cow VRTX is taking a pounding. Looks like its rapidly heading below $200.
First major support at 200.00 USD; this is like Frodo throwing a ring in mordor.
I hope price go up fellas
Look for a rebound of mjr indices day of Vrtx earnings and short term pop in share price
Why is this going down?
"looks like ARWR rejected VRTX offer and decided to partner with MRNA. they want it cheap $75m to start for the last 10% of patients? ""The three-year research collaboration initially will focus on the discovery and optimization of novel LNPs and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to cells in the lungs, enabling functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein to be produced."" why would they think by enabling the CFTR proteins to be active in these non active patients would allow them to use their CFTR drugs? Perhaps CFTR proteins is not even the main cause of these CF patients problem but ENAC is? ARWR broad based agnostic treatment may even make VRTX treatment obsolete!"
Looks like short ratio was 3.94 as of oct 14... who is sick enough to short a company trying to develop drugs meant to treat CF? I'm long here... ER was pretty good plus new drug/s seems to be well tolerated. Hopefully the company will develop outstanding med to crush CF and make shareholders good money. GLTA Longs!!!
"This company is helping to keep my wife alive. Her lungs are clearer now than they were 10 years ago. In the CF world that is remarkable. I bought stock as a Thank You as much as for an investment. Not bad as an investment, either."
"Interesting. I think PLX's (PRX-110) DNase will have significantly better results, and it's sitting around $1.25 a share. Should be a fun couple of weeks!"
"Even if had you bought VRTX before today around $260~$270, do not worry , it will not only go back up all the way and a lot more after the earnings report in a couple of weeks.VRTX has always been solely valued on CF. Any other pipelines would only add values to it. Today and possibly next few days really represents a huge opportunity for fund managers as well as for us to initiate new positions or add more to the portfolio.Good luck to everyone!"
Single-cut CRISPR/Cas9 can restore the reading-frame of dystrophin protein (which was disrupted by a deletion mutation).

CRSP is going after cystic fibrosis franchise which probably means since they are partners already in other diseases then 40 billion VRTX willl acquire 3 billion CRSP in gene editing. CRSP is also Car-T company all of which have already been acquired except CRSP

"Jeffries analyst bullish on VRTX:Jefferies believe that Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX) presents a lucrative buying opportunity at the current level, and investors looking to get in the industry should purchase the stock. The analyst believes that the concerns that bog the stock down are temporary and will vanish in a not-so-distance future. Analyst Brian Abrahams believes that the current stock price has more than 20% upside potential in the near term and the long term growth outlook of the company is even more impressive. The concerns that are tying the stock down below $80 are not likely to linger around for much longer and are mostly due to weakened profiles of the next-gen correctors. These next gen correctors are likely to be the key for the company in order to expand itself and create opportunities in the Cystic Fibrosis treatment segment. The concerns regarding these regulators are mostly overblown. They will not cause any material impact on the products prospects.The product pipelines of Vertex pharmaceuticals remains as strong as ever and the correctors are highly likely to earn FDA’s approval. The analyst spoke with a large number of experts in the field and discussed the concerns that currently plague the stock’s price. The results were highly in favor of the company and the concerns are for the most part immaterial"
This thing seems to have been dinged for a while. Will probably go down after the earnings!.
"Excerpt from Motley Fool article:""Vertex dominates the CF market. There aren't any other approved drugs that address the underlying cause of the disease...Impressive growth should continue for years to come. Wall Street analysts project that Vertex's earnings will increase by an average of nearly 28% annually over the next five years. That rate of growth should be attainable with Vertex lining up new reimbursement deals for its drugs in key markets and especially with the prospects of Trikafta soon winning European regulatory approval...The company has a big cash stockpile (over $3.8 billion at the end of 2019)...Vertex has already put its cash to use, establishing several collaborations with other drugmakers and acquiring Semma Therapeutics last year. Semma has a promising preclinical program focused on curing type 1 diabetes....Vertex doesn't face any notable headwinds over the next few years...I look for Vertex to continue reigning as a juggernaut in CF and achieve success in other indications over the next 10 years."""
Don't miss investing VRTX at the great bargain price today. Life time great opportunity to make big profit by investing this great company.
Not a good sign when every other pharmaceutical company is steadily climbing today and we're steadily going lower. Maybe it's the fact that VRTX just hit a 52-week high? Hoping to add to my Jan 2022 $240 options!

"From the FDA:""Your application for tezacaftor/ivacaftor was not referred to an FDA advisory committee becausethe application did not raise significant public health questions on the role of the drug/biologic inthe diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of a disease""I am wondering if FDA is going to require an ADCOMM for the approval of the Triple combo that was recently submitted."
"With GLPG2222, 2737 and 2451, for example, regular phase 1 research in healthy volunteers was done separately and in combination, followed by follow-up research in patients. For example, the annoying metabolite of GLPG2451 (half-life one month) was discovered, which of course led to extra research. The C1-corrector GLPG2222 has meanwhile been investigated as monotherapy (in homozygous Class II F508del CF patients) • With the C2-corrector GLPG2737 has been tested in combination with Orkambi (also in homozygous CF patients). GLPG2451 is being investigated in the recently started Falcon study in part 1 in combination with C1-corrector GLPG2222, before being used as the basic component of the triple in part 2. Finally, a complete phase 2 study is performed with all three components. The two-step approach makes it possible to determine the merits of the C2 corrector by comparing part 1 with part 2. 7. Of course, critical followers are free to doubt the statistical evidence of the studies of Galapagos, especially where the quality of the 'dose ranging' part. The doubt mainly focuses on the Falcon study with the combination GLPG2451 / 2222/2737. Precisely because it is a combination of three active substances, finding the optimal effective doses with the most favorable side effects profile is not an easy task. In theory, a large number of options must be investigated. Fortunately, the state of clinical statistical research has progressed so far that 'dose ranging' has become almost a separate field of science. The number of options can therefore be greatly reduced. And besides, why would the Galapagos medical statisticians set up a rickety study with the near-certainty of capital destruction. Vertex, on the other hand, has been baffled by the FDA because it has not done any (published) research with the deuterated molecule. Allowing such a (controversial!) Variant to enter the market creates a strong precedent, also in view of the patent-law aspects. The FDA is well aware of that, it seems to me. 8. Meanwhile, we know that Galapagos wants to conduct its Phase 3 research entirely in Europe, thereby circumventing potential problems with the FDA and other major stakeholders in the United States. We do not know what these problems are. One has, among other things, obtained scientific advice in England. Furthermore, no permission is required from EMA - other than from FDA - to initiate phase 3 investigations. National committees in Europe only assess the ethical aspects of the study design. However, the advice of questions and consultations with UK and EMA authorities clearly required a great deal of time. 9. Of course, the USA market is one and a half times as big as the European CF market (mainly due to higher prices in relation to Europe). But a quick admission by EMA / European Commission in combination with the high price sensitivity of the national markets in Europe offers the Galapagos with its triple (s) unprecedented opportunities, now that Vertex is facing a serious delay. In the event of competitive pricing, just about three quarters of the market can be conquered within a few years. Success in Europe will undoubtedly put the FDA under light pressure to decide on quick admission. Perhaps the misunderstanding between the top of Galapagos and AbbVie can be traced back to various insights at the time about the strategy to be pursued: all R & D efforts on the AbbVie home market (and Vertex!) Or the efforts to focus first on the European Union with are more price-sensitive markets of the Member States. 10. I realize that here on the forum all attention goes to the molecules GLPG1690 (IPF) and GLPG1972 (OA). Galapagos itself has also shifted attention and emphasis on both experimental means. However, I was and is of the opinion that progress in the area of CF triples is much more appealing to the imagination among the institutional US investors in particular. The CF market is a well-known, large market with a single monopolist, whose value is well above $ 40 billion. As soon as you get the impression that Vertex is vulnerable, that will give great attention to the Galapagos share. Then the hateful undervaluation of the price may disappear as snow for the spring sun ...."

"UK's NHS and VRTX execs met again Thursday 3/21/19 after Leiden's meeting with Secretary of State Hancock the prior week and it seems to suggest some progress in working out an acceptable payment for Orkambi (and possibly future CF drugs from VRTX) which would of course discredit the downgrade by GP, the Leerink Analyst, who recently caused pressure on VRTX stock price, citing the failure of making a deal with the UK's NHS for VRTX CF drugs as a reason to lower earnings expectation for the company over the intermediate term.From PM live web site 3/21/19""A breakthrough in the long-running dispute over Vertex’s cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi could be within sight, as the company meets again today with NHS England and NICE.It has been three years since Orkambi was approved in Europe, but for much of that time Vertex has been at loggerheads with England’s cost effectiveness watchdog NICE and NHS England about the price of the drug.Orkambi’s clinical trials show the drug can improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with the life-shortening condition, and could be appropriate for around 50% of sufferers, many of whom are children.Both sides have blamed the other for inflexibility on the cost and value of the drug, which has a list price of £104,000 ($136,000) per patient per year.NHS England went public last summer with its own five-year £500m pricing deal for Orkambi and Vertex’s other CF treatments Kalydeco and Symkevi, the latest addition to its portfolio.Vertex said it simply could not accept this offer, but said it had offered its own confidential deal, which it claims is the best deal anywhere in the world.This standoff led to an eight month period with no progress, but was broken when the Commons health select committee called both sides to an inquiry two weeks ago to explain the impasse.This was followed by a meeting between Vertex CEO Jeff Leiden and UK health secretary Matt Hancock, who described the talks as ‘constructive’.This in turn led to the pharma company restarting talks with NICE and NHS England, with a second meeting scheduled for today in Manchester.The long running row has seen patient campaigners take to the streets and social media to protest, putting pressure on both sides to come to an agreement. Laurence Powell is one such campaigner, calling for access on behalf of his son.LPNick Medhurst, policy manager for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust says the charity and the many CF campaigners feel a renewed sense of optimism about access to what they are sure is a transformative medicine for people with cystic fibrosis.“The news that the parties are sitting down again, and with pronouncements from both the company and the secretary of state that talks have been constructive, makes us optimistic,” he said. “But unfortunately we've been optimistic before, so we won’t count our chickens just yet.”The CF Trust believes that some sort of outcomes-based deal, drawing on its own registry of CF patients, could help unlock a deal. There is extra pressure on NHS England to arrive at a solution after Vertex recently reached agreement with Scotland for access to Orkambi and Symkevi."""
Vrtx is a gift at today's prices. I loaded up as much as I could.
"Analysts very quiet following 4th qtr CC, Shares of VRTX moving up today, likely before upgrade from analysts finally acknowledging growth potential of VRTX, and it's value if it were to be acquired. JNJ's 30 billion acquisition of a small swiss biotech certainly could make VRTX a possible target from a larger company like GILD needing a deep pipeline of drugs with a lot of growth potential to bolster its growth"
"WOWs&p -.69%nasdaq -.79%xbi -.93%ibb -1.12%bib -2.06%vrtx -3.59%I guess investors did not like Leiden bagging over $19M while shares also having gone down, down and down. That is on top of over $4M annual salary."
This morning Morgan Stanley lifts VRTX price target to $207
Another red day
"Vertex has been forming a base for the last 6 months. The base has been averaging about $212.I do think it will get it's mojo back in a short period of time. Unlike many Bio stocks, it has a great balance sheet and it makes money.It's worth watching. I have owned it for the last 6 months."
"This morning all the big bio boys are down 1.5-3%, BIIB, AMGN etc, VRTX is by no means a disaster today."

As CEO stated, if any two of five areas (above three + CTX-001, VX-150) succeed, Vertex will be in good shape. If you can wait several years (=5~7 yr) without selling the shares you hold, you could triple your money invested at the current price."

Projected timelines for full accrual, and submissions of regulatory documents will undoubtedly be increased."

Wow is I’ll I have to say!!!!!!!
excellent quarterly report. VRTX should be 250's by mid-summer.
Both VRTX and GLPG are down. GLPG is down 3.33%. No news on either stock.
the insiders have baled out . The drop in price of more than $4.00 indicates the fix is in. More leaks in this company than the whitehouse.!!!!
Man I bought way too early! Rookie mistake not waiting until the downfall settled!
"There’s not many companies that can say they have a monopoly on a treatment, have a lot of cash and very little debt. I just hope they buy someone fairly big."
"The breakout MIGHT finally happen, although this stock has disappointed over and over again. I exited so it's more likely than ever because well... my activity seems to control the action. So much for ""efficient"" markets, in this environment this stock should be doing much better. If this thing hits $230 this week I'll take it as my final piece of evidence that retail trader based manipulation by market makers is all too real (which there is already plenty of evidence and books about this) to ever play this game again. Close the accounts and use the money to buy dirt. I hope you all get the results I expected but couldn't watch any longer. HODL?"
Wow...........great news! $200/sh not out of sight.

Also the possibility of initiation of clinical trials using stem cells to cure type 1 DM later this year. Maybe an update on starting late stage clinical trials for non opiate pain drugs as well."
We are on our way up. We held the 262-263 line
VRTX appears to suggest upside opportunity given the EPS growth estimate next 5 Years at 66.96%. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awesome-STOCKS.
VRTX has 11 buy ratings and 9 strong buy ratings. This sleeping giant finally woke up from its long sleep. Ready to blast off from here.

"(currently on the sidelines, close to pulling the trigger). The stock seems a little too good to be true. its PROFITABLE. EPS is over 10, PE ratio is 20.... arguably the leader in treatments for CF.... what gives? market cap should be almost double! or at least 85B.... honestly I am asking, what's the catch with this one? has the market really just overlooked it???? is there some anticipated bad news/data that's expected soon thats caked in???? somebody help me out here, I cant find anything to justify the discount."
"Someone help me understand. This stock is about 33% of its all-time high, dropped about 25% recently with the news on the one trial discontinuance, this morning had an analyst start coverage with a $287 price target and then they report great earnings. The result, the stock is down after hours. What gives?"
"""In March, Proteostasis announced disappointing data from a dose-selecting phase I program on its triple combination candidates in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data showed that a statistically significant improvement in percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1), measurement of lung function, at day 14 was achieved in the study cohort with a higher dose of the company’s CFTR corrector. However, the uptrend was much lower than what was attained by the triple combinations of Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX in late-stage clinical analyses of the treatment of CF."""

[[ ... Am B can also be toxic to human cells, as it extracts cholesterol, the human sterol, from cell membranes. But at low concentrations, complexes of Am B and sterol take on a second role, forming pores that embed themselves in the cell membranes. Could the Am B–sterol complex also form pores in lung epithelial cells, helping cystic fibrosis patients’ lungs release bicarbonate?To find out, Burke and his colleagues tested Am B on lung tissue donated by cystic fibrosis patients who had a variety of mutations of the CFTR gene, including mutations that produce no CFTR. In epithelial cells grown in a lab dish, Am B produced pores, which released bicarbonate. The researchers also treated pigs with cystic fibrosis, using a version of Am B formulated for delivery to the lungs.

"Politicians are trying to to pay for infrastructure costs by annihilating drug companies which stops innovation for treating rare diseases and reduces investments in drug companies.""Their basic finding is that cutting prices by 40 to 50 percent in the United States will lead to between 30 and 60 percent fewer R and D projects being undertaken in the early stage of developing a new drug. Relatively modest price changes, such #$%$ or 10 percent, are estimated to have relatively little impact on the incentives for product development - perhaps a negative 5 percent.For the pharmaceutical industry, one economic problem is that only 3 out of every 10 of their products generate after-tax returns (measured in present value terms) in excess of average, after-tax R and D costs. The scientific process is heavily regulated, and involves significant technical risk. Only one in several thousand compounds investigated ever makes it through the full development process to gain approval of the Food and Drug Administration. The vast majority of R and D projects fail for reasons related to safety, efficacy, or commercial viability, the authors note. For compounds that do gain FDA approval and are taken to market, the entire process from discovery to launch takes on average about 15 years.'"

"Dear Vertex Shareowners,Cystic Fibrosis patients have greatly benefited from Vertex’s commitment to beating this terrible disease.

"Bernie needs more than a Fox news town hall meeting to enact Medicare for all legislation. Disrupting the entire health care industry would cause massive layoffs and unemployment. It would end drug innovation in the pharmaceutical industry with the risk of drug development costs not being worth the uncertain payoff if drug price controls thwart profits needed to fund the research and pay off those taking the financial risk. Providing health insurance for the uninsured does not require destroying the progress made in medical advances that require an adequate profit to take the financial risk to develop new medical breakthroughs. The success of the medical and pharmaceutical industry provides large numbers of high paying jobs that provide huge tax revenue for states and the federal government. Who is going to make up that tax revenue if many of those jobs disappear with socialized medicine? The overall cost of medicare for all would not be made up for by eliminating the health insurance industry. Medicare for all would then have to become rationed healthcare for all since the budgetary shortfalls would have to be made up for by restricting healthcare. As an example, check out restrictions on treatments in countries like the UK with NHS refusing to pay for most of VRTX CF drugs as an example, even if discounted more than 50%. CF Children's lives in the UK will not be valued more than an additional 10 thousand dollars a year to pay for breakthrough VRTX CFTR corrector drugs based on the NHS most recent offer. Is this the system we are heading for in the US?Never mind it's cost over 6 billion for VRTX to develop these drugs and the UK has not helped much to pay for any of these development costs yet than have more than 10% of the world's CF population. Is this the direction the US intends to go for healthcare?"
