DVA is up 5.43% to 52.44
Someone knows something that's not public. DVA rarely makes a 2% move on volume without market moving news. Why should I be surprised? Because it's DVA which is as exciting as watching paint dry.
I think the company has money for open market stock purchases. Nice opportunity under 55.

THE DAVITA FRAUD IS VERY REAL PEOPLE: THE NAJARIAN BROTHERS AND THE COMPANY ...DAVITA...... HAVE COMMITTED A CALL FRAUD IN DECEMBER THAT DAVITA $66.00 CALL BY JANUARY 2019 THIS IS THE SECOND TIME THE COMPANY COMMITTED...FRAUD....
stay long friends...
"expensive with questionable and agressive forward guidance. Also huge debt, low fcf"
A buy today under 60(59.42 up 1.44 as I type) and write the Jan 2021 60's at 9.50/10.20 for a guarantee of over 15% in 15 months. Or if there is a dip in the stock maybe buy them back lower for a nice return.Absolute worst case is DVA takes a dive and is below 60 on OE and you have just lowered your 60.00 cost basis by roughly 10.00 which still looks good.No choice on getting Dialysis and it's basically still a duopoly.
Heading to $40 before June

No to prop 23 should give a boost.
I'm going up buy more... stay long
DVA Chanos short today closed 59.75 down 1.55 2.53% but some serious options trades!In the ones that expire tomorrow 9/20In the ones that expire on Oct 18And the January 2020'sOverall as usual calls way more than puts.The rest of the OE days not as popular today
Oops - dang AMTD - I was buying when I thought I was selling!Couple days ago I thought I wrote Jan 65's for 3.50 and AMTD does this weird thing after I choose Sell-to-open then you do the lookup on the options change it CHANGES it to BUY-to-open!I have been bitten by this before!So today I noticed my error and sold for 3.70 - basically a wash.I will likely attempt to rewrote Jan 65's for 4.00 soon.
So let me get this straight at $113 PETER tells us to buy that it will be a BARN BURNER and will make new highs...at $104 he tells us to BUY AGAIN but makes no mention of his previous advice in which ppl would be down almost $10 !!! DVA is heading to $90 and Peter will tell us let's not buy now ....LOL
"DVA has had a history of fraud, and Chanos announced his short in September. Hard to believe DVA was able to significantly beat estimates without some of Chanos' concerns being true. This move up today is overplayed."
DVA reached a 52 Week low at 47.02
Shorted 2000
this should break 71 in a week
"This #$%$ is so OVERBOUGHT, i see a phony spike to 115 and then back to $90 where it belongs, FMS is cheaper and could rally to $45 !"

FMS has climbed over $3 since i posted and DVA is going nowhere but a slow trickle back down to the $90's and perhaps lower. There's a huge lawsuit against DVA and the dollar is getting stronger which benefits FMS !
"WALL STREET ON NOTICE,,,,,,,DAVITA, NAJARIAN BROTHER FRAUD"
Finally broke thru 60 today after bouncing off of it several times. To the point that I sold some common just under 60 but kept Jan calls and other common.Someone was really holding it under 60 - it was almost like an OE Friday and the MM was playing with the price.Can't see how a fed cut that everyone is expecting will directly help DVA. If it had a dividend(and why doesn't it - I think of it like a Utility) that may cause a bump.
So painful to own this stock for a few years.
"I like this company for an earnings play, am going long in a few minutes, expecting an earnings beat and positive guidance going forward. Only going to do 100 shares, because I see risks and headwinds going forward that might reduce the likelihood of a serious pop up even on a good earnings report. CVS looks much better as an earnings play, but this one is good enough for me to put 100 shares at risk to the long side."
Get in on this one. Lots of achievements for a 9 month old cyber security co. LDSR
"Sold a bunch yesterday in after election bump at 75.55, bough back 1/3 today at 69.75. Will keep buying back in thirds if it continues to fall.Hated to sell but was a very large pop.Buffet's guys are still in here I'd think or the price would really be punished as they pulled out.The competitor had news a few weeks ago.Still few choices if a person needs Dialysis. Buffett's 2 guys still have large holdings, there are worse investments."
Just on CNBC Jim Chanos(sp?) shorting DVA for Years and questions Berkshire being involved - they still have 24%.A couple comments. Berkshire doesn't ALWAYS make the best moves. Look at the first time that I know of that they bought a Company with another investor(who is slash n loot) from Brazil with Kraft Heinz. You can see what a mis-step that was.And actually it was Warren's 2 new hires that both had bought DVA that they had to file 10% ownership not long after they had started.Now DVA is at 24% and I believe have a standstill agreement. Which is why I questioned DVA announced a significant buyback not long ago which would increase Berkshire's % ad if that would cause any issues.I am long DVA(common and I had sold some common and bought deep in the money calls that are now up 59%.It will be interesting to hear why it is shorted. We already know that all profits come from the little sliver of private pay for Davita and Frenesius.Capital intensive but a necessary service. And since to me it has a lot of characteristics of a Utility I have always thought they should have a dividend.Let the games begin. I have made decent money trading DVA over Years. Virtually all the common and calls I own are with the House's money.I had wanted this to be one of my 4 largest holdings but it just can't seem to get there!2 folks with WAY more money and information that I will lever have. Time to grab the popcorn and decide if there is an opportunity to make money here.And I have been long BRKB's for a very long time. Although I sold a bunch when their split was announced and shortly after that split.Chenos to be on CNBC shortly but I have to leave so I won't see it.
everyone has left
Hit my set sale price so I am out. Good luck kids. Boolean
Going to be down huge tomorrow lol jk. Its moving less than on a er miss than a regular day.

"$64.00 - Perfect time to back up the truck. CMS put out a press release today: ""CMS examines inappropriate steering of people eligible for Medicare or Medicaid into Marketplace plans"". Dumb money will be selling; DaVita will be buying/probably seek to accelerate the buyback. And, if you follow Warren Buffett, you can be damn sure that his deputy Mr. Weschler is evaluating a takeover bid for the whole company, or he too will be increasing his stake. Gotta love the engineering take down of the shares, allowing insiders to load the boat. Don't be fooled! DVA has at least 50% upside to present value based strong and growing free cash flow, with intrinsic value compounding higher from there."
FMS still up on the DAY...YAY ME BOO Buffet and cowards pete and rob

WE WILL KNOW IF THE NAJARIANS COMMIT FRAUD DAVITA HAS TILL JANUARY16 OPTION CALLS TO GO TO $67.00.
CVS - Anyone have an idea of what they are proposing with in home dialysis through Coram?
Sold a few trading shares yesterday at 56.45 from an outstanding order.Wasn't worth writing covered calls.If we get close to 60 I'll write some calls.If DVA dips closer to 50 I'll buy more trading shares.Not flashy but still not many alternatives. FMS and small players. No choice on whether to have dialysis or not.
"DAVITA,,, FRAUD...... THE NAJARIAN BROTHERS CALL JAM 16TH 2019 TO $66.00 IS ANOTHER SECOND ATTEMPT FRAUD WITH DAVITA...... DAVITA FRAUD"
Bought more. NECESSARY Healthcare in this environment. Can't go wrong!
Wrote 1 JAN 202 65 call for 3.50 this morning while the stock was just under 57.00. That is a return of 20% if they get called away. And if they get called away all the common I have will be doing very well....Just like last time when I wrote 60's for 4.00 and bought back at 2.00 I may do the same with these as that's what I usually do. But I'm leaning towards never calling these back.I will likely continue to write some calls at different strikes given the chance up to 1/4 of my DVA holdings.For some reason a few hours later this post isn't showing. Luckily I had made a copy of it(because Yahoo is so reliable...)Now DVA has backed off some but still green on the day. Entire market doing well today.
Any thoughts on taking over KERX ..? One drug AURYXIA ...2 indications

FMS exploding over $40 and on its way to$50....Dear Buffet and cowards pete and rob....you bought the wrong dialysis company ...DVA will now be in pergatory stock hell for 5 years $90 to $115 LOL
sirf bites
the bs sirf eport is ridiculous and insignificant... people still need dialysis no matter what they say.
Manipulation manipulation next week hit the 30dollar bellows
"BTW Peter the Wrong...i have also bought the much cheaper and better company in this space at $34.89 see my posts...60,000 im hedging it against this expensive shady management elusive answers on earnings calls..if you look at the chart on this pig it is showing a lower high from January and an H chart pattern both extremely BEARISH but you wouldn't know that because your a sheep and i'm a lion."
"don't know why this stock has ticked up. dialysis is an incredibly invasive procedure and the science and technology is advancing fast enough so that people with kidney disease will have less invasive, home care options. in the near future. davita is brick and mortar with older technology. I also believe the repeal of Obamacare will have a significant impact on davita profits. a new Healthcare bill could easily cap costs of dialysis treatment. not a smart buy at this valuation."
"800,000 SEA OF RED DUMP,,,,,,,,,DAVITA FRAUD"

DVA is down 6.88% to 76.21
Glad I sold. Management at this company is so corrupt
DaVita is doing just fine.
My speculation is that the price is down cause the Investment banker may buy it before the offer from Warren Buffettt in buying the whole DVA
Great buying opportunity in DVA stock currently trading at a discount on the sell off from all time highs!!

"$7 away from setting a new all time high,once deal is done with United Health this is an excellent takeover private equity target.$90 a share or so."
"THE DAVITA FRAUD IS VERY REAL,,,, AND THE NAJARIAN BROTHERS ARE IN ON IT."
I see no news on AMTD or here and average volume but up 2.48 to 72.12 and 3.55% today - kind of bizarre.Perhaps we will find out later.Simple chart shows to me - and I'm ahrdly a chart expert - that it should go up or down soon as it's into the middle of the > and I'm not a big enough chart guy to know which way it may go.I still know that Dialysis isn't much of a choice and some big name shorts are in here and Berkshire Hathaway is long like 10% of shares.So based on fundamentals I'm holding all my shares but thinking about cashing in on some trading shares.Can't believe that I see n news. Can't be all about a potential trade war especially with no dividend.
The only stock in my portfolio thats up...
"up....$60,000 so far will layer out 10,000 shares at a time every $6 to $8 all the way down to $90's which is still expensive but"
"PEG of 0.6 indicates the growth of DVA will be impressive. Its current metrics of forward P/E under 9.x is very attractive, and its price per book of 2.1 is lower than the peers at 4.4 , and price per sales is only 0.7. Bargain"
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.....did you PETER followers buy it at $110 just now ????SUCKERS !!!
DVA reached a 52 Week high at 72.33
POS DVA
"Lots of stock movement (mostly down) for a large Company and yet no MB activity?I realize that these MB's have been ""improved"" over the past few years to teh point they have little value but really - this inactive?I realize a lot is institutional.I realize Frenesius has issues and trying to complete the acquisition of NXTM(which I also owned until the buyout was announced).Tax loss selling will likely keep DVA down thru end of Year. I'll likely be buying back the 1/3 left after my recent sale, I already bought 2 chunks back.And I'm likely to add fresh shares. Was looking at calls yesterday too."

"I've bought back almost all common sold much higher this Year, now 2 options buys as wellYesterday some Jan 60's for 2.50today I piggy backed on the Jan 67.50's at .65The 67.50's the other day just after I had bought back more common one of the pony tail brothers saw the same activity as I had noticed in options at Jan 67.50 and he piggy backed the trade.I had raised cash thus Year especially over the summer and was up to like 20% cash. Being a crazy market I have been buying calls into the new Year more than common as a way to limit risk.Time will tell about the market, and this ""risk less"" but more like gambling(mostly due to time limitation) than true investing to me.I still have a little over 12% cash left.DVA like several stocks I own and follow I have to believe tax loss selling is a large part of the slide. Folks figuring DVA certainly isn't going to go out of Business so it's being oversold for accounting purposes and likely to be bought back.As long as Berkshire isn't selling (the 2 new guys are who bought DVA) and folks need Dialysis I can't see DVA going anywhere.If DVA paid a dividend(and why don't they - as to me almost a utility stock) it wouldn't have gotten beaten up this bad. IMO.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!"

DVA is up 5.77% to 74.25
Any thoughts on why down so much today = ANY due to Powell Q&A?By that I mean after the hike was announced things weren't so bad and I had to leave for the day.Tax loss selling is taking it's toll on DVA.But how much is interest rate related? I cna't believe that .25% would cause DVA to be down another 3% basically twice the loss of the market.I'll likely be adding to common and/or calls by the end of the Year.No rush.
DVA is up 4.95% to 86.85

Dva dropping to 200 day at 94 maybe lower. Berkshire buying means nothing. Mark my words

"Thinking of writing some Jan 2020'sFor 1/4 of my holdings - and I'm currently overall underwater with shares currently held.At 54.00 looks like JAN 2020's at strike of 60 can be sold for 5.40 which would be 21% return if called away.Writing the JAN 2020 65's at 4.00 would be 27% return in a Year if called away.And the other 3/4 of my holdings would benefit from the stock price runup very nicely if the stock trades up thru the strike price.So collect a premium and if the stock gets called away a return of 20%+ in a Year on those shares. If it doesn't get called away I've just reduced my cost basis. Often when I do this if I can buy the calls back at half the price I collected I buy them back and close out the trade, usually has to do with how much time is left.But 20% in a Year or a lowered cost basis is looking pretty good.Also look at a simple chart for the past Year. Between 65 and 69 that's getting kinda close to the recent high's and I'd likely be selling some of my trading shares in that range anyways.Good luck folks!"

"Buffett's 'Big Mistake' Is Finally Looking Up - realmoney/thestreet/click bait - who wrote headline?If I recall the 2 new guys EACH bought DVA and that is how Berkshire had enough shares that they had to file.

"Wonder if Berkshire is adding even more? Both ""new"" guys are who bought DVA shares not WEB himself.I believe they were up to 23% ownership?If THEY liquidate it will be really ugly.In the end I figure DVA will be somewhere between a utility and a tobacco company. They will let them make enough profit to stay in business. Thru taxing(like Tobacco) or in this case Gov't reimbursement of procedures.In the end the service both these big dialysis company's provide is life saving or life extending, the money will be found to pay for it."

"Bought 1 lone Jan 2021 37.50 on 7/9/19 for 18.00Sold today for 21.50 - 25% in 3 days!Artificially low due to concerns about Wed Trump comments re dialysis, then the news wasn't' so bad - or more accurately no changes in the very short term.Certainly makes me with I had purchased more of those calls. I still own some purchased earlier as stock replacement that I had purchased so that could sell some common next bump which is what I did.Trying to keep some cash on hand in this crazy market with Trump, China, N Korea, fed rates.And it would only take one successful terrorist event in the US to tank the market for a while.

"COVID Risk?Is there a risk to DVA business model because of COVID? dialysis patients are in tight proximity in dialysis centers with 20-30 other patients for 4 hours per session three (3) days per week. The medical staff work at multiple clinics and could potentially transmit disease. Most clinics are in metropolitan areas. End stage renal disease patients requiring dialysis are mostly over 65 years of age and have underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, immunosuppression and are often overweight. Similar profile for those at greatest risk of serious COVID infections.The map of dialysis locations nation wide looks a lot like the map of confirmed COVID cases https://www.optum.com/solutions/population-health/clinical-management/medical-benefit-management/kidney-solutions.htmlWhat is DaVita doing to protect their fragile patients? What is the rate of COVID positive care givers in dialysis clinics? Does DaVita provide infection rate information to their patients? Do the air handling systems in the dialysis clinics have HEPA filters?"

"Someone called into Cramer tonight about DVA. He said bye.Didn't say anything abotu recent run, or the Berkshire stake.Actually his comments I think made it sound like a growth stock. Or more growth than I am expecting.Nothing about low margins, or that all the profit comes from the sliver of Insurance Money because the gov't reimbursement isn't much.I'm still long, have sold some trading shares along the way. And have one lone Jan 2021 37.50 call is up 75% that I bought with proceeds of selling profitable common lower than where we are now.All the common I still hold is green.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap"""

Just have too much AWK and still think dialysis (including home dialysis) is only going to grow."

"Still potential tax loss selling by individuals but I added some yesterday and todayI don't see a compelling reason to be in a hurry. It may run into yearend as folks may have sold or be selling and needing to wait their 30 days.DVA has been disappointing. Not like folks have a choice about getting Dialysis. I owned some stock in a company their competitor recently purchased that specialized in at home dialysis.And both of the guys WEB gave money to run to see who may replace him bought DVA independently or each other and that was why Berkshire had to start to file about DVA becasue their ownership was so great. I believe there is some kind of standstill in place though isn't there?Anyways may be time to start to nibble..""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap"""

"How many shares do you think DVA has already bought back at these levels from weak holders, given the company's $1.500 billion buyback authorization (12% of the market cap)?"
long DVA anyways
Have you seen all the TV ads about kidney dialysis patients getting infected and killed at clinics? DVA is killing people. lawsuits en masse to come.
Why is this down big today? Cant find any news
Super low volume pullback. Weak hands selling or just a little reasonable profit taking. No worries $120 in next few months regardless of economy.
DVA is currently trading in the “extreme value discount” level!
Nice Beat!Going up and up!
"By this morning I have purchased back most of the DVA I sold earlier, and added a little more SQ.Watching SPY, KLIC, JPM to add.Got lucky with DVA in one account it's been excellent trading especially considering that I really view DVA as a long term hold.5/19/18 bought small lot 64.7511/7/18 sold 4 lots 75.5511/8/18 bought lot 69.7511/13/18 bought lot 65.4612/10/18 bought lot 57.53(10% lower than last buy)In another account I have similar1/11/18 sold 4 lots 78.68bought lot 5/3/18 63.53so I may have more buying to do to finish replacement. Been looking at calls alsoTax loss selling HAS to be an issue as this market continues to deteriorate rapidly.3rd account a couple of lots from March 2017 avg 68 I added a lot 11/20 59.53.I'm now at about 10% of my Portfolio and overall the shares I hold are down 8%. Now I have booked decent profits though this doesn't reflect.In the end I always wondered why DVA doesn't pay a dividend. Huge cash flow, almost a utility. No choice but to have Dialysis and basically it's a duopoly. WEB's new guys both loved DVA and I sold some when Berkshire had to file how much DVA they owned and other folks jumped in.Basically Tarif's won't effect DVA. Taxes won't negatively effect DVA.No choice but to have Dialysis if you need it.Tax loss selling has to be a major factor IMO right now.""Scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks!"
"I covered 20,000 shares at $123.39 shorted at $129.22....that's how it's done cowards Robbie and Petey"
We are now at December 2013 price levels. My only guess why we are down 25% from the high is the imminent election of Hillary and the possible damage she might do to the healthcare/pharma sector.
JUST HOW BIG COULD THE FRAUD BE DAVITA
"Like everyone else, I'm finding countless articles about CVS buying Davita for $4.9B sometime next year. Has anyone found anything more concrete? How much that works out to per share? Roughly when next year is the acquisition going thru?"
"Added some at 54.53 in very rare for em pre-market buy on news about at-home DialysisRemember that Frenesius(sp?) just was allowed to complete their purchase of NXTM that has to my knowledge still the only small at home unit for Dialysis including overnight.I used to own NXTM - a decent amount until I saw the moves mgmt was making to continue their personal gravy train at the expense of stock holders. By the time the buyout came I didn't own many shares. Infact one of the worst moved NXTM had made was giving away too much of the company and a board seat to the fella they bought the tubing set business off of and is what they had to sell off to have the buyout be allowed.If DVA continues to slide I'll hope to buy back my Jan 65 calls that I wrote for half price and likely will still add some common.There are always stories and sometimes referendum's abotu Dialysis. But there still arent' many altrernatives to Dialysis or the 2 large Company's in this space.Good luck folks!""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""I may flip today's pre-market shares for a couple bucks more today given the chance."
