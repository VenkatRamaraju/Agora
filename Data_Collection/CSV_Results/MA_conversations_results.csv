Why is MA trading down. I do not think expectations were as baked in as their excellent earnings. Is there something from the call that may be negative?
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4378541-mastercard-double-digit-growth-for-over-decade-priceless
"Buying Opportunity, MA and Visa will power higher over time."
MA will be surging up tmr!
Can we hit $500 this year?
MA IS POSITIVE!!!
Strong finish forMa!!
Earnings and revenue smoked estimates today! Earnings=2.15 on revenue of 4.5 billion. Cha-Ching!
MA and V going out of business or something?
ATH for $PYPL $MA $V what a lovely end of the week
Load time
Maybe if they beat earnings next quarter we'll get to $150?
"why oh why didn't you all buy Ma and V at their ipo?....w/a 10 for 1 split, Ma cost basis is $4. ($40 ipo price)V also had a 4 for 1 split"
This is not about tariffs. This is a manufactured crisis brought on by the big boys to start fear in the marketplace!
The Fastest growing segment in the digital Payment arena and which has the biggest potential growth is B to B of which Mastercard is king. The ER and the follow up CC should be outstanding. IMHO
It’s a great time to go bargain hunting in MA & V!- The day trading argument is bogus from a well known “short trader” on this mssg Board!- This an excellent opportunity to add on the dynamic duo — who will spearhead the Economic recovery that’s already began in the U. S. — with more Econ- stimulus on the way in a matter of weeks!
Heres your entryInto fud in a retest . Will be 400’in a week
Hey Scott <3 Hope we hit 280 today that would be tighttttttttt
A very good stock plummets just before the ER. My guess is that means it will be a positive report. I’ve seen that before.
the whole world on lockdown I would not buy now on anything
Black Friday not going well. Bad for mastercard. Also economy in general getting weaker and weaker.
MA is an excellent company!!!
Solid q3 results
Best stock buy any dip
MA looks like it is trending down in the last 30 minutes.
Is tomorrow going to be green? We got to get this thing going forward now! Way undersold.
This is beginning of the MasterCard end .
@Sonja - MA is not worth owing unless it falls below $130.
"MA revenues up, guidance references that travel and spending is back as COVID gets behind us. BUT the BIG BUT is MA said they see expenses will go up 30% due to ne products and programs. The crazy thing is MA did not say what added revenue these new products would contribute. MA may see a few days of drops but once profit takers settle out and weak hands sell.....expect MA above $400 again."
"What's your ""short trader"" definition of ""tanking"", pal???"
"Ulrich, where's your money?"
OH come on! Ridiculous to drop this stock today. Economy will come back but if you listen to CNBC pundits we are at the edge of the abyss. Self fulfilling prophecy.
MA is rallying again!!! Consumer spending was up big in January!!! GO MA GO!!!
As the clock moves inexorably towards the opening bell *** The “short !squeeze” could be an intense affair!
Can the board owner get rid of the trash that seems to have taken over
Why is this down so much today?
"MA on a nice early bounce off its lows, and there is still a very long runway on its path back to recent established highs and beyond — especially when the bullish story of the current economic recovery is written!"
This is being orchestrated by big investment houses. There is no reason for this kind of alarm.
SELLING THIS JUNK. I'M GOING ALL IN ON JC PENNY AND MACYS!
MA will rock the rest of today!!!
so happy to have bought that dip.
"Wow! nearly 5% loss, quite unusual. How are we feeling about this?"
Looking forward to Wednesday report!
Any good things from the call?
"Good news today on getting into China,surprised MA and V aren't up more"
VISA did great so MA is down AH !!! Give me a break !!!
clearing out the stops goes back up after lunch
MA is extremely overvalued. Great businesses do not make great investments if you overpay for them.
"Technology was the worst sector today. MA,V, PYPL are all moving I to the lagging to underperform sectors."
MA hanging tough. Lot of good news been coming our way.
I short MA now wish me luck
To the mooooooooooooon
MA will easily beat their projected 4th quarter revenue and earnings estimates. MA stock will rise in to their earnings!!!
MA is down 14.45% to 231.00
"Market is crazy right now. If you want safe money invest in spacs, they usually trade around 10.5$ and if they merge they double.I recommend to invest in BFT they are going to merge with Paysafe (kind of Square and Paypal) and they are trading at 13.8$$BFT $SQ $PYPL $V $MA"
Another high today!
Goldman Sachs says you need to be in Tech even with the run up and lists its favorites including MasterCard. :))
MA will rise in to their 2nd Quarter earnings in July!!! What a great stock to own!!!
Exceptional buying opportunity below $370 for the MA juggernaut!
Macquarie initiated coverage of Mastercard with an outperform rating and $365 price target.
Who uses mastercard
MA & Visa are the best companies to invest in. Long term outlook remains strong. Buy and hold forever.
crash
Sub 200 by June 10th. Some says 175.
It should be a a huge rebound day for MA stock today.
time to buy
tomorrow morning will be its highest.... according to history.... just playing the game... odds
Get ready for yet another fun and profitable day amigos. Get used to it :))
"down on very low volume, and a short trading day. Computers running things, MM off enjoying long weekend after they set their formulas. This will open Monday higher when realize MA and others are bargains."
Bought 100 more shares. We shall see what happens.
Going nowhere until a COVID vaccine is prevalent and people are back to travelling. If you're looking for short term gains I'd be a seller and come back mid 2021.
Just like Visa this will BOOM in the coming years. Get aboard this money train. Less and less people using cash before covid let alone during/after. Long long and long.. thank me later

Time to short MA AMZN GOOL HD SPY
$270.00 Today mark my word. I went into the future and came back.
Brilliant Green program from Mastercard. Today if you don’t have an environment friendly strategy the college grads won’t work for you and Millenniums won’t buy your stocks nor will a growing number of Fund Managers.Anecdotally speaking I won’t buy an oil company stock (neither tobacco). This coming from someone who at one time had an overwhelming number of oil and oil service company stocks. Things change. And those that don’t respond to it will be left behind. IMHO
"Market does seem to be getting frothy. The price I paid for MA and V was about 27 times current earnings. They are trading at a valuation much higher than that. I do like them both long-term, but buying at today's prices would be calling for trouble."
"Awesome MA late sesson recovery from the bowels of the gallows!- What an amazing MA recovery -- I wonder how many retail investors survived today's wild ride, or; had the courage of their conviction, to buy MA stok in the depths of the valley of dispair."
"The Potato is making the Stock Market Great Again. Raising taxes, Green ""New"" Deal, and buying foreign oil are a great way to help people's investments."
the stock floats like crazy before earnings every quarter
"if you can hold it to next month, it will take off again. it is not time yet. just be patient."
There was all this excitement about MA getting into China and now somebody posts that China already has Unionpay which is bigger and better than mastercard so they don't really give a toss about mastercard because they have their own thang.Nobody was saying this last week.
Green Futures!
Sold my ma and v this morning. Need the money plus valuations are too high
Bought Visa for around 20$ per share and now we are rapidly closing on the MA price range.Soon we shall over take and humble you.
It’s been moving like a powerful machine and gaining momentum. A must own stock for next 5 years. We are only scratching the service of this juggernaut
U buy here not sell
Stock hit major support into capitulation its ma peopleBuyIts been a pandemic aheesh
MA is down 4.91% to 308.73
Mastercard is up 4.94% to 367.73
I was waiting 30% drop so I I can truck load up more instead it keeping going up
Moving much higher after earnings.
Today is nothing but a great buying opportunity.
Big worries on how to pay for Thanksgiving and Christmas expenses let alone other bills. Delinquencies will rise.
MA reached an all time high at 261.46
Raymond James set Target to $244. BUY signal.
Master Card Dont leave home with out it
The streak of continuous gains looks to be coming to an end. That’s okay. Can’t go up everyday. I think there will be a nice bounce back tomorrow. MA to new highs.
first entry into this today.
Wondering if it’ll hit $300 before the new year?
Bought at 308.5 earlier. Long term it’s gold
BIOA going up
I’m down huge. I thought Cramer said going to 200
if we have a correction in the market tomorrow or next week it will test 200MA thats when i am going to buy
Look up in the sky it's super money. 
This or paypal?
What’s going on with MA?
Raymond James raised its PT to $428
MA struggling now for sure. I think $380 will be resting place for a while.
Starting to show signs of life.
MA will close at $ 215 today!!!
"I will be adding more at $182, which was the low back in October when dropped."
If the market goes down So does MAStand your ground and you will be rewarded
"I first bought MA in the 140’s, and sold in the 170’s. Bad move on my part. I’ve been waiting for a dip to re-enter, but that dip never came. I bought back in yesterday with an average price of 191.68. I have to admit, the valuation is pretty rich, I’m almost hoping it’ll drop so I can add some more. 15x revenue is a pretty high multiple, I think that’s even higher than NVDA.Regardless, I need to learn to never sell MA or V. They keep crushing it, and I see no reason for that to change."
I dont know but I want some at 270
Unfortunately it still has another dollar to drop before support level is reached.
Buying opportunity
pump is almost over. almost entirely institution owned. take some off the table or you'll be sorry
That's the craziest thing I've seen in a while. Down $10 for what?
Mastercard declares $0.40 dividend (which is 21.2% increase from prior dividend of $0.33!)https://seekingalpha.com/news/3523502-mastercard-declares-0_40-dividend?dr=1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha#email_link
"If Chipotle stock is over $1000, why can't MA be there. Seems like MA can generate more revenue than burritos."
Bought more today. I started buying at 100. This is a no brainer. Just money in the bank.
187 I'd start to nibble
All time high. Shorted 1000 shares at 364.MA is definitely overvalued when it has higher PE multiples than FB. LOL
I bought in and hopping a BIG DEAL comes throughs.
Anyone foresee something exciting coming from the shareholders meeting tomorrow?
wow I wanted 315 to buy back after selling for profit there we go. maybe we can get it lower
MA beats on revenues and earnings!!! Another excellent quarter for MA!!! GO MA GO!!!

huge gains before earnings is usually a bad sign. probably going to tank 15%
MA trading at a “ginormous bargain” — similar to the “false panic” back in January!
I have had multiple comments removed on the MA Board.... I am removing Verizion Fios as my internnet provider and switching my phone service.... Verizion owns Yahoo and supports the Left ..... Bye Bye Verizion !

Motley Fool has MasterCard as their top pick to buy now. Onwards to $250 amigos.
Once again sellers are selling into strength on MA. Good thing the market is up over 300 or we be red lol
So I am down 30K in two days. I think this is known as a crash. Good buying opportunity.If I hadn't loaded up last week. Nothing left to invest.
Keep on buying this has nothing to do with CHINA . It’s a US CARD
"Will load once it touches 200.Long term bullish, short term pain."
no worries...people will buy online if they stay indoors... even use their cc more
Officially took out the pre-pandemic high today. What a monster run since March. The best is yet to come MA longs and the opposite for MA shorts. Long MA and V forever.
"I am afraid it has just started. 50,000 people in my city Richmond were told today we are closed for business. Including county employees."
"Reuters) - Mastercard Inc said on Wednesday it was planning to offer support for some cryptocurrencies on its network this year, joining a string of big-ticket firms that have pledged similar support.The credit-card giant's announcement comes days after Elon Musk's Tesla Inc revealed it had purchased $1.5 billion of bitcoin and would soon accept it as a form of payment.Asset manager BlackRock Inc and payments companies Square and PayPal have also recently backed cryptocurrencies.Mastercard already offers customers cards that allow people to transact using their cryptocurrencies, although without going through its network.""Doing this work will create a lot more possibilities for shoppers and merchants, allowing them to transact in an entirely new form of payment. This change may open merchants up to new customers who are already flocking to digital assets,"" Mastercard said. (https://mstr.cd/3tLaPZM)Mastercard specified that not all cryptocurrencies will be supported on its network, adding that many of the hundreds of digital assets in circulation still need to tighten their compliance measures.Many cryptocurrencies have struggled to win the trust of mainstream investors and the general public due to their speculative nature and potential for money laundering.(Reporting by Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.)"
Run people run. This is only the beginning run take your money and run
"got 3/4 of IRA in MA.... a 3 to 5 yr. money cow.1/4 in WA...TRASH...THEY make 70% of their money on renting dumpsters to businesses. 10% easy money. keep 50,000 cash in fidelity making 1.96% money market. enough to live on for 2 yrs. if the wheels fall off."
V & MA are now trading in the extreme bargain zone — for two of the best and most profitable global businesses of our time!
MA IS ACTING VERY BULLISH!!! POWELL IS SUGGESTING A RATE CUT AT THE FED MEETING!!!
bought in at $172 Wed.
"No worries, all safe & sound. I never once even began to worry about MA, V or PYPL. Super safe companies. Easy to ride with the cashless contactless payment trend."
MMs manipulated this stock before their earnings
It's only off 8 1/2% from ATH!
What’s with yahoo premarket. Is the stock up or down?
Jump on this folks. This is pure kneejerk stupidity selling.
im still holding. New records high in the way. forever stock
Huge buying opportunity!!!
XLF seriously depends on JACKSON'S HOLE. I guess JANET YELLEN will come out and say something which is positive to the market. Don't forget that Fed always side with the market. They don't want to shake the fragile market. They just want the market to run smooth in orderly. Bank sector is coming back so they will pamper the financial sector in order to make country back from 2008.
"Man, this board goes dead when we're in the red."
Ouch!
"You should gobble up MA on sale, before it rockets up again next week"
You can all thank Trump for Mastercard getting into China. His tough China trade stance did it. He got alot of slack from Dems but it's paying off. No word on Visa but I assume it's a foregone conclusion that they will be getting in soon as part of the trade deal.
"If a stock like Mastercard is sold, you know the big money wants to get out of the market and that the economy faces a serious slowdown.Its one of the best companies in the world, so every weakness you see here is a really bad sign for the stock market in general."
"This is ridiculous to be down $25 (8%) today.....I fear after Visa reports MA may drop further if Visa says anything negative. The charts show we are around support, if breaks into $280's we can repeat March trend dip.This needs to turn around, the worries about more Covid shutdowns is killing my MA position."
Another great earnings report from Mastercard! 
Having a hard time maintaining upward momentum....

"What a joke.....I had a very fair post that just disappeared for no good reason, obviously someone does not understand so I will repost. Try reading the whole post vs taking one word and report it to take it down."
I'm still afloat is the good thing
Look like Sell off at the end.
MA is resilient! 
short squeeze
$200 Next for me 
Big trouble
"MA hits high today in high VIX. I believe MA will BREAK OUT right away, because XLF is keeping higher high."
Why it’s in red when market is in green
"We were in the $340s early this year. When. The economy turns around next year, we will fly."
Institutions of trying to force a down market. Down 600 one day up 500 next day down 400 next day. Makes absolutely no sense at all other than they're trying to create panic in the market. It does not bother me because I am all in. MA is worth a fortune long term. It is a steal under $200.
ATH today!
Buy Algorithms beginning to kick in the final 45 minutes of the trading session!
The markets are rocking!!!
Same as it ever was. Great day today!
$FTOC $FTOCW Mastercard $MA joins forces with Payoneer for Cross Border Payments (with eye on Business Payments). Business Payments is a 20 Trillion dollar industry.
Why V up big and MA drop?Don't make sense
"PE ratio of 42 or so, which is where we are now, appears to be an upper limit for MA. It's not nearly the same multiple of SQ or Paypal, but it's on the high end of its historic range. Which makes me think we won't see a significant move upward until earnings growth starts to push the ratio down at this price OR we get some additional news - dividend increase, increased buyback, etc. and those are extremely unlikely right now.Bummer - MA has been on a great run and I've been overweight for many many years on it and it's hard to see it sit still while AAPL and the other tech stocks continue to rip higher."
Bought more shares today 
MA ready for pullback.
"This is going to get worse. Buy the dip. but you know this isn't the dip of the dip. Be patient folks, more opportunities to come....."
Long term yes. You can buy now at discount prices and hold around all this volatility.
I hope this has the same reaction as Google's earnings release
anyone know why MA is down almost $5 today?
The big guys sell. Then the small guys panic sell. Then the big guys buy your small guys shares back cheap! I’m holding my shares. MA is a money maker.
Start a position at $200 this week
Do you think these ding dongs know what a ponzi scheme is?
$MA and $V will thrive in the post corona world .. both will double in 5-10 years
Beast stock!
Mastercard is Masterbeting
...just sold some...so it should boom the remainder of the day for the rest of you :-)
Congats to the investors here! Nothing but net!
Better than expected = Love those words!
So frustrating..you hear so many good things about MA but upward momentum seems to be stalled. Pops 8-9 bucks one day followed by three days that take it all away. It's becoming a pattern.
Hey folks... Will the price of the share go up to 300-400 later
MasterCard will open over $210 tomorrow morning.
"Once Powell stops talking about how terrible the economy, market should go back up. He is killing any sort of rally today"
Selling time
Not today!!!!!!
I ask the same question.Why drop?MA is much better than Visa.Hopefully MA will add another $10 dollars tomorrow when market open
there will be a lot of visa and MasterCard default payment which the bank is claiming which means there will be a lot of cards out of commission. and the lockdown will hurt both MasterCard and visa earning. it will retest the lows.
Fingers crossed.
Very weak stock. Better sell now and put your money in something better performing
going up Monday?
HMNY has left the train station..They just lowered their prices for MoviePass!!! WOW!!!!
Pricy even at $300
Nut case shorts are scared!
"Visa beat estimates late Tuesday, as payment volumes topped pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Mastercard reports early Thursday.*** Awesome news for the “dynamic duo” , and MA stock could top and surpass the $400 barrier by Friday!!!"
$90 stock the most.
SANTA SELL OFF!!!
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE this is fun.
MA is up 4.93% to $196.99

"Market looks really rough. Was hoping for $260 or $270 to make big profits on June 2019 $240 calls, but not sure if this will hit that before expiration."

Affirm has been around since 2012. Just sayin'.
Can’t seem to maintain forward momentum
MasterCard will go up! Do not worry. It will skyrocket.
Now MA TIME TO SHINE!
Ya Thur! All time high baby!
stock is flat in AM....?? why? earning went well as far i understand.....
Gosh another down day
buy buy buy buy buy
Is it Europe/Asia? Noticed that MA commonly jumps in the morning and fades in the afternoon. Does Europe/Asia like it more than the US?
We have had some good days since ER. This little dip is no big deal. Christmas sales have already started.
buy any dip when possible. go Ma
Just a reminder that buying point $305
Mastercard reached an all time high at 355.84
People would have begged for a one day 8% crash a month ago. Take it
Just have to sit back and wait! As always with a recession or fall back you have to wait and be patient. It’s going to take months for this to come back but it’s a long term stock! Stay the course and gains will come back!
this stock is overbought here and should see some selling after earnings.
If the DOJ cant get trump out the Fed will
Fear - - > buy
Great stock ... any chance of a SPLIT coming?
hot 209...
Nice. Needed some bad news. Was looking for a better entry point. All companies are going to be affected by China. Hopefully we will get a chance to buy under $300

The folks in this board only want to hear good news. That is a dangerous way to invest.

"@FAANG_BUBBLE - You sound angry. Everyone is free to trade any stock they want.. If you think those stocks are bubbles, you can short them. But please back off with the angry comments."
Why are we running so counter to the market these days?
Thank God I'm finally about to break even after an entire year!
MA is holding up very well on such a horrible day. 11 point bounce already.
This is really getting hit super hard. Not looking good into earnings at all. They may know something that we don’t.
Yea! hit 300. only 41 off where I bought in.
I'm really frustrated how market is behaving with ma and v. these are companies that is free from almost all the risks we are currently discussing. these companies have huge space to grow. every day economies are moving from cash to plastic money. and you cannot survive without spending! people what do you want?! I know what you want. master card need to say all its share holders need not to repay credit card bills.. ever. does that work people?!
Look at MA rally!!! GO MA GO!!!
Trending down like V. Looks like a double top that failed to overtake the last high. Not a good sign.
Pump and dump. Stock overvalued.
just got 25 shares. will add 20 more to avrg down if necessary.

predictions how long to recover?
"MA financial numbers justifies, Tesla is priced from a dream."
NICE
All the analysts putting the $375 consensus PT on MA have known about Affirm for a long time.
Anybody have a thought why Visa and MasterCard are down today?
Today’s positive U.S. Economic data is a bullish confirmation that MA will be firing on all cylinders as the Economy starts opening up into the rest of FY 2021 and beyond!
The MA rebound could take off as early as tomorrow’s opening bell .*** It will sure make those who had the courage and conviction to buy into today’s “opportunistic dip”.
"Buy @ $210 if holds above that price. Buy more if ‘Guidance’ is positive, end of Jan."
800 shares of this and I’m getting rocked. My gosh.
Ok this stock is just pathetic. Literally the entire market is going up and MA continues to trend down. It’s just sad to see.

"I am adding on this awesome bargain — MA will report a great Q4 earnings in the pre-Market opening tomorrow, and MA will be off to a “mother of a rally” that could take the stock to new highs.*** So, the current unloading of weakest hands is setting the stage for a powerful rebound rally to new high and beyond —for one of the great businesses of our time."
Australia refusing to use MasterCard and Visa. It’s only beginning. Strong Sell.
15 more minutes before goofball takes charge
This year with everything slowly going back to normal This should be 430 at years end
This one going down. If your betting on cards VIsa is better. We have a recession coming up and this guy is going to get burned. (Just look how MA does during precious ones )
"Bounced off 200. If it goes under, look out below..."
290 is possible this week ofcourse but yeah... 28.000 people recovered. That’s a lot and that number will grow and the fear will go away. Ebola was worse.
MA is down 8.84% to 245.91
Do you expect a climb when this hit 200 MA at $318?
ma $200 dollars

"rotation still on on payment stocks. I believe this should pass soon the same way the rotation passed for the cloud stocks after a few months. big guys were too loaded on some of the main payment names so it takes time to unwind. this will get oversold eventually. adding at this levels. also adding on $V, $MA, $SQ, $STNE gradually"
Why down down down lately?

Best Stock in my Portfolio 
Cramer made some comments about MA and the credit card stocks this evening. He had recommended buying MA weeks ago as a recovery play. To paraphrase he said the bank stocks having caught fire has drawn money away from MA/V as money managers who must have exposure to financials have moved to lower p/e stocks that will benefit from the rising yield curve. Stocks like PYPL have also caused some $ to come out of MA/V. FWIW.
"SELL, SELL, SELL!!! The money velocity is decreasing."
The Dow is up 239 and the NASDAQ is up 72
This sell off is crazy. Just because visa has a probe doesn’t mean MA should drop this much!!
"@Tom - Why do you think the market ""should"" be moving higher? We are in the middle of a trade war with the world's second largest economy, interest rates are increasing, which is raising the cost of capital for companies and individuals, and the year-over-year growth benefit of Trump's tax cuts will end next year. What is happening in the markers is justified. You just don't know enough to understand."
I am really starting to wish I hadn't loaded up last week for 341. Seems if I had waited I could have bought twice as many shares for half the price soon.
Look at MA rally. YES!!!
When are the Marxist democrats now in power going to start blowing up the economy and stock market?

This is strange to sell off so close to earnings
Listening to CNBC this morning.........they made it sound like MA and V's decline could just be about valuation.
"Currently sitting right on the 20 day EMA. Nice support, MA doesn't spend a lot of time under the 20 day. Should see some positive movement soon."
Mastercard also owns maestro which one of the biggest debit card brands

Ridiculous credit card service $V $MA payment service $PYPL all extremely overbought!!! Biggest bubble in the world!

MA getting rocked right now.
The entire American automobile industry has just shut down. I don't believe anyone is going to be buying anything.
MA will rock today. I expect stronger earnings for MA than what V reported yesterday!!!
The dow is going to open this morning down 350 points. Most of this is because the democrats will control of the house. Most investors agree with the democrats in control they going to destroy the economy the trump has built.
Why is this on the downside with most cities and states opened up? Most other stocks are at 52 week highs or making new ones. Any input or facts would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

"The $19 Billion class action lawsuit in the UK  declined to a $43,420,000 fine for MA — as a to their part of 5 firms in the class action lawsuit!*** This settlement could be seen as a “victory” for MA... given the magnitude of the $19 billion sum and the headlines and attention it garnered!"
"It is manipulated again for MA today. Call 135 is a factor for depressing pattern. I will watch it closely, because it plays out different from V. The new high/new low ratio points out that the market will move higher."
Buy opportunity
Can't touch this! Great day again.
MA reached an all time high at 251.05

"This is what I was talking about. This is the dip I was looking for,but didn't wait for. Great buying opportunity,now and for the next while. Except I spent all my money when it was at the top. Oh well. Buy low Sell high. I never learn."
With how great retail stocks are doing MA should be at $110+. I added a bit more. Largest holding now. One of the best stocks to own long term.
More down than up for this stock for over a year. Dead morning at 100%. I would sell abs put into something else 100%. Dividend is weak as well.
going down to 269 today...will stop at 269
"MA and V are perfect stocks. They are one of the few companies that blend safety with growth. One of them (or both!) should be in everyone’s long term portfolio. Massive MOAT in a duopoly, no credit risk, moving towards a cashless society. What is not to like about MA? COVID may (will probably) only increase the speed towards a cashless society.Buy and DCA it forever."
buy buy buy upside next day
And this board goes silent. Lol
will drop to 190
Was reading all yours reply yesterday. My verdict: Strong BUY on any pullback.
We are getting really close to that magic number!

Looking like a nice pop at the opening.
this stock is really starting to cook today I'm really excited I think it's going to easily hit the 155 by next week ... certainly the 160 or 162 even by about December 12th. Meanwhile pay no attention to the pump and dumpsters who make their little advertisements. They should be banned.

"WOW- Lots of 'Chicken Littles' on here today, with multiple personalities, spewing the same message- The sky is falling"

"MA stock is working back up the ladder to it’s “fair price” value in the range of: $342 - $350.- The stock is emerging from an “Extreme oversold” bargain bin level.***Hopefully, the upcoming “investor conference” would be an opportunity to gauge MA’s Mgmt sentiment prior to a frenetic Holiday Season."
"This is a buying opportunity in MA!- The stock crossed into grossly oversold territory! - The current Qtr is usually the strongest of its fiscal year— considering it’s the holiday season.- It’s time to buy MA when everyone is selling.***MA should be bought with both hands at this “bargain bin” price below $300 - $320.***You can hang your hat on the “silver linings” in their Qtr report: ((( purchase volume was; $1.24 Trillion — blew away expectations, and; Gross volume was; $1.65 Trillion again blew out expectations by a statistically significant margin. )))- I see a strong bounce back when investors come to their senses, and begin to focus on the details within MA’s Qtr report!- Savvy investors should make the most of this “mis-pricing to pounce on this bargain!"
MA is very bullish today. We will see $ 210 by next Monday!
Market down 350. MA up a buck!
"MA and V will benefit from very favorable “year over year” revenues comparison tailwinds from the magnitude of the current economic rebound, versus last year’s contraction and shutdown of the U.S. and global Economy, due to COVID-19 in FY-2020!- The tailwinds will retrace the challenging Economic times on the opposite side with a “V-shape” Economic boom over the next 18 to 36 months!*** MA & V are currently trading at a HUGE discount given the overwhelmingly positive impact of the forward U.S and global economic outlook!"
I hate when they run it up like this right before earnings. I just hope it doesn’t sell off.
"It's not too late to hope on the MA train. Buy at market open!This'll end up at 300, and should be straight green for the next few days."
Do not worry about AXP. They are NOT the leader. Their revenues have not grown in 5 years. MA is the gold mine.
any news on why it spike down.
MA is down 7.67% to 265.00
Why isn’t this jumping 5% today?
Visa will act the same way
Targeting a buy at 180. will sell at 250 if it gets there fast. otherwise long hold.

"I am long MA.....yet, would like to comment on the gross manipulation by big institutions on it's share price. The big instituions were dumping MA shares to drive it as low as they can. Then they state that it's earnings were not good, since the incentives were too high a percentage to revenue. Now, the big institutions are buying back in ......I wish the SEC would investigate the games insitutions play.Tomorrow, all the talking heads on CNBC will come out and say, the world is beuatiful again, go and buy shares.......the bull market is back.This is just a big game of manipulation."
Happy Earnings Day! Here’s to a blowout quarter!
"well that was nice. bought yesterday. made $800.00Today just lost $10,000."
Hard to move higher.
I reckon MA will dip slightly so that we can BUY more before Earning and then SKY ROCKET to 200 near future!
Bought another 150 shares at $337.30. Will hope for a nice end to the day rally plus positive Monday and start to the next week!
We had back so much last week. Hopefully gain them back soon.
"This is what my boys and I call a ""firesale"" just as I bought sub 200 two years ago when it dropped, I'll buy sub 300 on a drop and look back at another 100$ gain"
Looks like everyone is taking there profit from Mastercard to cover their margin accounts caused from Google and Amazon. Fools
"MA has been working on using biometrics. ie:finger, thumb. palm to replace its outdated cards for more than a decade. The problem comes from the merchant's end. The merchants want MA to finance the biometric systems in their facilities. MA has proposed a joint effort. This is where blick chain will come into the authentication process. The savings will be huge for all."
All time high today. Strong holiday sales. Stock buybacks. $300+ soon.
Stock does NOT like $150 smh
"If I hadn't bought at 341 I would wait until summer,of maybe next year. buy 10000 shares at a dollar a share. would be rich."

Quick question...is this dipping due to ex dividend tomorrow or due to red market day?

Morons bought the high ahahah
"The fact that WTI went to -$40/barrel today should be taken into account by some folks here. Shows just how much demand destruction has occurred in just a few weeks of shut down and MA (and V) depend on spend. Some governors believe they'll just keep these lockdowns in place for months, even though report after report coming out shows that greater than 50% of people who ""tested positive"" had no signs or symptoms at all. I.e. it may be contagious, but unless you're in a nursing home or have underlying comorbidities it doesn't matter. The damage to the economy (which is just an academic way of saying you, me, and everyone else) is real though."
Double top
Sell off at the end?
The Master of all cards up nicely again. Glad I dumped all my Visa shares in my Master Card shares a while back. There is only one Master and it’s MA. :))
Sure would hate to have all these sellers as battle buddies in a combat zone... don't think they could handle any pressure at all!!
Buying the dip. A steal below 300. And much of the selling today is aggravated by the virus concerns. Shorts would do well to cover here. MA gives so little to shorts and so much to longs. Even here I still have enormous gains.
Great buying opportunity
FYI PAYS ... take a look at early growth company

"Selling before holiday shopping? Holding MA, V and PYPL very long term. Should see excellent results from Holiday season."
Riddle me this:- MA and V had excellent earnings- states that have been shutdown (like NY and Cal) are seriously looking at re-opening their economies- vaccines are rolling out and new vaccines are still coming from likes of JNJ- BxxxxN is going to push through a $1.9 trillion stimulus plan to bump economy- What am I missing? All these points should bode well for our economy (whether you agree with them or not). Is this simply manipulation OR concerns of virus resurgence OR worries about fintech competition?MA/V should make new highs not be stuck down here.NOW TELL ME WHAT WAS THE REASON THIS WAS REMOVED>>>BxxxxN?
Too bad MA isn't on the DOW. The #$%$ American Express is dragging her down today.
This will stabilize in the afternoon. Mastercard will be green at the end of the day.
Man! I see this thing dipping back to 202 soon. I'll be a buyer then

There she goes. Going down faster than to start this day.
MA will reach $ 302.00 today and $ 310 by next Friday!!!
"MA, since its IPO in May 2006, has produced $5.958/share in dividends. The IPO was at $3.90. (All numbers split adjusted). Add in the $270/share price, and that's a pretty nice annualized return. :)"
ATH! coming soon
My only problem is I can't buy more
What do we see first $370 or $330? Looks like a Downtrend may appear. Could we see another breakout though?
Great buying opportunity in my opinion! This should be back to $370 here before long. GLTA!
Holding up well after the recent run up and the propensity to sell stocks that have run up before ER when they do report even with a strong report. Regardless the fabulous ER will carry the day over the following weeks and months. IMHO

Who is buying in this selloff across the board.. Not just buyback by individual companies. $V $MA $AXP
"Sure Australia, so the credit card companies should maintain their systems, issue cards, protect people from fraud and then you want to bypass their systems because merchants are whining about paying a couple of pennies. Believe me, credit card and other charges are already figured into their pricing. It's just greed. What is it that the government doesn't get?"
This behemoth will stop at nothing. The best B2B fintech company for its value. Get in while it is on the come up
Why is V heavily under-performing MA today?
It’s just a matter of time for MA to break out before the closing  bell!*** V received similar upgrades to MA today and is currently soaring on those positives!- ‘Tis time to buy ahead of the the crowd of enterprising investors!
"The 34 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Mastercard Inc have a median target of 375.00, with a high estimate of 440.00 and a low estimate of 318.00. The median estimate represents a +16 % increase from today's price of 323,26"

such a bs stock I sold 2 months back at 311 and its still in that range while the rest of the market has moved much higher.. I think the run for $V and $MA is over
Good run for both V and MA. Now a healthy consolidation is in order to march higher slowly and steadily...
"This will blow past 365, easily."
Thanks guys in at $320.32
MA will benefit from increased consumer spending in the third and fourth quarters. This stock will reach $ 220 by the end of the year!!!
Going to $400 by end of the month
MA will turn into GREEN today.
What a complete failure. Tanking huge after yesterdays short squeeze. Going red back to 185.
Why it down 5$ AF? Any news
"The bull market ended in January. The new highs in October were very weak while the rest of the world was already in bear markets.Now even the most crowded stocks are getting nuked. Mastercard, Nvidia, Netflix, Amazon etc. Wherever you look tech is getting crushed while value stocks keep rising. Look at verizon, KO, MCDonalds, JNJ.Recession is coming in 2019. And maybe even a total blowout like in 2008."
$230 by Christmas
Stock way undervalued. The assault on $400 continues.
Gary01 Hi idiot.
"get ready tomorrow Oct 20, call 130, I think to buy it when MA drops over 3 points."
People treating every stock like its gonna be covid for eternity
"1000 point drop in 20 minutes. So much for the protective trigger. You would think they would shut it down. So everyone could cool off. But no, let's keep grinding away at it."
Big beat!
"Well i thought i was smart buying on the dip at 219, then more at 218, and again at 217... was too early on the trigger."
$bought at $78. Long term hold
"all the ""fintech"" cos. seem to be moving together (SQ, PYPL, V, MA). No news probably just mutual funds, etfs moving $$$ around/rebalancing trying to catch the latest hot stocks."
"Everybody is only talking about $PYPL beats expectations and related to $SQ. But another bullish sign is that $MA beats also and said:"" an increase in contactless payments could help support current quarter transactions following a stronger-than-expected second quarter earnings report."""
Deutsche Bank raised it's price target to $380 
MA is almost at their 52 week high. I think they may reach $ 196 by the close today!!!! GO MA GO!!!

Fast money due said it going down. That is part of the deal. Then higher.Visa also. happy investing to all..
Buying opportunities!
100% going to miss on earnings. Will be another rough quarter with 2021 outlook rough. No recovery until 2022 at the earliest.
"V and MA, 2 amazing companies that keep beating and raising earnings expectations. Two of the better investments I've made so far. Hopefully these gravy trains continue doing well in the future."
When is the earning times
As MasterCard continues to get bigger it’s financials get stronger. Self fulfilling prophecy.
Next week I think MA goes up past $360 a share.
Visa better
Goes up fast and then next several days just continues to go down. How does that make sense.
Sinking faster than a boat

"It would be pretty foolish to short stocks like $MA and $V right now. Normalcy will return and their profits will continue to go up, especially when transaction fees are raised next April. These two also stand to make more when inflation comes along because of these static fees. People with expendable income are only getting wealthier as the pandemic gets longer. Job vacancies will come again. I missed the boat back in 2016 before these behemoths took off. They'll be profiting for decades to come. To add on, companies like amazon and apple heavily rely on these two to complete transactions."
CYBER MONDAY = $$$$$ FOR MASTERCARD
Artificial inflation. Not going to make it Monday.
New coverage with buy rating and $133 target price.
MA reached an all time high at 269.58
Thoughts on if MA will split soon? last 10-1 split was at 330/share back in 2014...probably another one coming at $400...similar price-split action to Apple? 4-1 ??
It will recover soon after the market UNCERTAINTY are cleared.
"I bought eight June 2019 $240 calls at an average premium of about $9. Breakeven share price at expiration is $249. Hoping this stock continues to go to the moon so that I can make big money.

You always get a buying opportunity in MA. It's up to you if you want to take advantage of it.
MA is down 4.94% to 266.71
Nice article this morning on Seeking Alpha about Mastercard predicting 15 to 18 percent growth.
MA raising dividend and another 4 B $ of repurchase of stock ...go MA
Let's get green!
low oil prices will drag on all stocks for at least another trading session or two.
"some repositioning and now feeding the Algos , a self propheting situation ...non sense"
V IS BETTER THAN MA FOR A BUY AND HOLD
Cash is out. Cards are in. I never use cash for anything anymore. Go MA!
Short
MA is up 6.25% to 216.01
Anyone joining on the conference call?
"@Kris - No it was real money and a lot of it. I am a value investor, Kris. I wait patiently and buy dollar bills for 50 cents. Read the ""Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham, and you'll understand what I do. In the meantime, stop being a hater just because you overpaid for MA. You are the only one to blame."
Stay long MA
What the drop is for ?
"Down 5% without any rationale is incredible, please tell me what fundamentals has changed with MA from a few weeks ago....NOTHING! The only thing I see is the acquisition announcement,all else still in place; strong consumer, retails did ok, China Trade deal on a positive path, ER coming soon. I DO NOT GET IT, DO YOU?"
really difficult to hold thru earnings. I'm selling upside calls
get the dividend....
Nice run into close.
This is ridiculous!!
MA is up 7.61% to 255.07
Dog #$%$ here. Just poop
let push MA back to 320 now.it so insane
Is it too late for me to get on board now?
All you MA fan girls are going to get hit hard when the recession kicks in
Worst stock.
A stock that can quadruple in the next 5 years IMHO
"Dare Bioscience, Inc. (DARE)going upto 5 USD soon."
Thumbs up if you have a Visa or MasterCard in your wallet right now.
It's nice that people are doing more shopping from home and using credit cards but it's not making up for billions and billions of dollars of business and personal travel spending lost.. I'm bullish long term but I don't know how any of the cc companies can make up for the loss in the next year.
"why is MA so strong today? usually MA makes a upward move will immediately tank. today firmly going up to higher high. simply due to technical breakout? if so, it could have had breakout 2 weeks ago, so why breakout today in a weak market day?"
"All time high! Yea thireeee, :))"
MA to acquire SessionM.
Get ready for a run to $250. We’re poised to take off.
"Indulge my ignorance...but I don't understand something...the increasing tariffs eventually will result higher prices and thus higher flow of money, which should generate higher profits to companies such as Mastercard and Visa ..so why are these shares dropping ??"
Buy long free money
"Everyone on all these forums are asking ""Whats going on?"" Here is the simple answer: Big Blocks owned by Big Investors are selling to lock in profits before the ""Destroyer"" raises Capital Gains Tax to 50%, then they watch small investors panic and sell off, then they come in again and buy back at much lower prices."
V broke strongly into positive territory— MA is headed there on great mid-session positive rally!
Awesome buying opportunity at these MA oversold levels!
"Predictions for when we hit $400? I’m thinking just before next earnings, in late April."
"After today’s run, I’d expect a red day tomorrow...not a sign of bad earnings, just people taking profits with the hope of dip buying. If this goes red a few points tomorrow, don’t read anything into it. Profit taking and buying the dip are just good strategies."
Anyone with a history of shorting MA stock is now living in a cardboard box.
"Analysts at RBC upgraded V, to a target price of $244 today — MA, along with Fintech, received honorable mention on the bullish analyst comments!!- They were projected as one of the top sectors in financial to outperform in 2021, when the Economy emerges in the post COVID-19 environment!"
She’s gone...
MA WILL BE POSITIVE BY THE CLOSE!!!
Incredible finish for the Master of all credit cards! Simply irresistible! :))
Held up beautifully on a down day. Were you expecting anything different? Hehe. THE place to be and stock to own in this space. Have a lovely weekend fellow LONGS.... and get that MasterCard out! :))
Investors should look at how MA price behaved after the 2008 financial crisis. It slowly but steadily itself out of the hole.
what's with today's drop? earnings?
Good entry point now.
one of my best picks in last 5 yrs.
buddy it's going to be alot more then$230 it be 230 by next earning .July
Buy buy buy
GO MA GO!
Nows the time to buy!
"Analyst Actions: Deutsche Bank Adjusts Mastercard PT to $420 From $383, Maintains Buy Rating"
"If the chart does not lie, MA will break out and test 140. The market right now is oversold on Tech sector. Bank sector is the safe harbor in case of the Vix changing abruptly."
Not today. Stock overvalued.
buy any weakness!
Thank You President Trump !
250$ today ?
MA is on sale at this trading level!- When you out 12 months this stock could be trading in the range of $395 - $425!
Looking really good today 290.00 after 10am
"The market will get the good news from GDP tomorrow. MA should move higher to hit high and BREAK OUT right away. Don't forget tax bill, can move the whole market even higher."
$ 200 is coming ! What a day !
$290! Fantastic for the Rolls Royce of Fintech
210 AFTER ER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great day here! I suspect a new all time high coming up soon here.
No one is selling MasterCard. No reason to sell. Holiday spending will break records this year.
laughin at the bankrupt bagholders here haha
why is this so flooded with spam?
Bought this cash cow back in ‘06 as a buy and hold at $6.60 in my Roth. Enough said
Not making money in SQ and PYPL today but at least making nice gains in MA and V. Soon this selling will be exhausted and fintech will fire as a single unit.
"MA is trading in Huge “gift territory”, and as that classic saying goes — you never look a gift  horse in the mouth, you simple buy while you can, and give thanks to Providence for the opportunity."
When should I get in?
DO NOT SELL ANY SHARES. WILL CONTINUE TO GO UP!! Keep taking in the extra gains!! May the longs be with you!!
Why does MA stock always dive at the end of the day?
Next stop is $500
New high by end of year
"unfortunatly, this is a dyeing company... bit coin"
I am out guys good luck to all
The only stock I own keeping my portfolio from looking like a complete disaster today
No reason MA wont close the year at $450. Love their vision and potential. Im long my 200 shs least 5 years

MA is bullish!!! GO MA GO!!!
Why do MA and V trade like exactly the same every day. No two companies should trade the same. They are all in the business to make money and compete with each other. I never got why they traded like exactly the same day in and day out.
"MA is close to a 52 week high. Once it breaks through $ 194.72, this stock will climb to a new high of $ 200."
I am still waiting for the All Times high!
is that a short squeeze comeback? will it tank on Monday again?
U S holiday retail sales rise 3% Mastercard report'shttps://youtu.be/jCioCeVk7vU
I think an improved economy and great holiday retail sales will push MA and V up at least another 5% and to new highs . Very Soon .
Will take at least all of 2021 to get this stock going forward. Wait on the sidelines before you purchase.
"I think q4 will be a negative surprise. It will be strong, but not as strong as the street expects. And when you miss by a penny in this market, you will get trashed.So i would stay on the side lines"
Business stabilizing and will be going up from now on. Resistance @268. GOod luck all longs!
"stock is a monster, enjoying the ride"
Profit taking or buy more for today?
"""push up operation"" just starts. We will see MA testing 135 this week."
"i don't know how this crazy market will react, but earnings are good"
I see $265
I was thinking of getting in but isn't anyone worried about the high level of debt in the current context? It's higher than the cash balance and their revenue is taking an enormous impact from the coronavirus - how are they going to service that debt?
"Yeah; I bought MA, the day after the IPO in May 2006."
Visa and Mastercard are dirt cheap. This is the perfect time to enter if you have no position. Both of these stocks are how investors have gotten rich over the past several years. As others have said I can't own enough of either.
Bought more shares last week. Using MA and V as a recovery play. Mastercard will take off once travel resumes and this COVID nightmare is behind us.
This will be around 203 by earnings so get in now!
Mastercard is a beast but Coronavirus is a monster! We will see lower unfortunately so just patient to add your positions. Don't chase a day like today. We were down 9% yesterday and up 9% today so that leaves us in the same place we started. You get the point.
this was an easy choice 
up we go...
"Bought at $199, I think this is a good long hold"
Market up 1000 points and MA trading even or down. How does that work?

$400 by Earnings.........what do you think?
Absolutely should be a buy here
MA has one horrible looking chart.
Right on time. 300 for a new year. Hard to believe 3 years ago MA was a hundred bucks a share.
Mastercard with partners to plant 100 million trees in 5 years 
"when the S&P drops to 2000, I'm going back in. sitting in cash waiting."
Wow time to buy some now
"Visa and mastercard, 2 clear winners."
Great day MA. Well done! On to $300!
"once the tariff ""joke"" is over we'll be back in the race again.... so much uncertainty.... end it....it's killing the economy. bought 91 extra shares riding Amazon up then sold it all and bought back MA. 2914 SHARES I'm all in !."
MA is breaking out!!! Here comes $ 282.00!!!
Just waiting for it to tank again in March. No point chasing it up. Been there. Done that.
MA reboun is on!-- Put on your rally caps!!!
MA will close at $ 285 today!!! GO MA GO!!!
Ma 
Don't miss the opportunity to own Mastercard before they enter China's $27 trillion market!
How many more greens days in a row are we going to have??
Try this again! SEC some enormous hedge fund is manipulating this stock! Bernie Madoff type dishonesty! Please shut them down and prosecute them! This company is extremely successful and shouldn't have dropped to this level today! It did because of these dishonest hedge funds They are screwing the mom and pop investor! SEC please make it into a unrigged stock market!
MasterCard - Square - Visa!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
MA longs should be comfortable on nibbling at these “gift horse” sale price levels!
-3%? Who cares about 3% .. MA will never crash. How about losing 20% last night? Thats my life with Facebook. It will take 1 year for me to recover.... you guys it will take 1 week.
And we say. ‘Bye bye’ 
"So the stock went down because the ""Analysts"" did not think that travel spending would be down with a world wide pandemic? Sounds more like an ""Analyst"" problem not a business problem to me.Fortunately I bought in 2017 so a 10% drop is no biggie"

Best Stock in my Portfolio.....
"$MA Reports tomorrow before open, supposibly it's going to be a great q. But if it won't. That's another win for Square ?"
Same pattern all the time...Jumps at the open and fades...
MA is headed to the $375 - $400 range on strong upcoming Q4 earnings repoet! Play the rebound now!!!
I love this stock! I have been an owner since the split several years ago. I buy on the dips and that has not failed me yet.
GREAT ENTRY POINT
"Don't let this be another 2008. I urge you all to still sell while you can. MA still up for the year.You don't get many more chances to sell. When it goes down, it will be a bloodbath you've never seen before."
Back to business as usual for MA one of the three best stocks you can own. Onto $300!
"The computers sell when things are weak hurting them more. Take advantage of V, MA, VNTV, PYPL weakness. Earnings are accelerating and retail stocks are up 5% today. No problems in purchase land. Some may be afraid of Apple introducing some new kind of payment system. Applepay uses MA and V. You still need banks to handle credit. The weak dollar hurts earnings but that has habit of reversing itself. V is under 20x earnings or close to market multiple and the same price it was in November of 2015. BUY BUY BUY."
"I'm not sure investors see MA as a growth stock anymore. Not saying I agree with them, but with a P/E of 40, it's a bit pricey. Could trade horizontally for a long time."

Arguably the most consistent business publicly traded. In the last 10 years it’s missed earnings estimates once and met them twice. Every other quarter they’ve beat estimates and for a decade have put up 13.5% yoy growth which they did once again this quarter. The fact this is down early today means nothing in the grand scheme of things because this business is so consistent with their growth.
POS

Seems resistance is around $360 be careful but this stock will go up be patient
"Been onboard MA since May 5, 2006. Yeah, that be the IPO date. My online broker says I'm up 2,897.28 %. Wish I would have bought more. Also own a bunch of V, but did not buy V on the IPO date so I'm not up nearly as much. I guess, I'm in for the long term on both of these equities. Hell, I don't want to even think about Capital Gains !!!"

Down this morning... At the the bottom of my portfolio....What gives?
Nasdaq creeping up ever so slightly while Mastercard continues to drift lower and lower.
Hope they find a cure soon. glta.
The Rolls Royce of Fintech powers on. Like a powerful machine and just getting started with all the drivers it has going its way. Own it/Buy it/Add to it...... and then forget it. Not brain surgery here amigos. :))
The economy is doomed. Tech stocks are rolling over. Mastercard will drop big over the next weeks and months.
"When world opens up, Visa, AMEX, MA soar, Affirm’s biggest client sells less of everything"
Yahoo is deleting my posts because I complaint about my wife being white and Mastercard is only willing to help women of color. Why is Yahoo deleting my posts.
Have over 650 shares. Will keep adding at every chance that presents itself. Won’t go below $220. Count on that 100%.
Trying to figure out who is selling MA and V right now and why? Strong dollar?
"It always amazes me how foolish investors take their cues from price action rather than tangible business fundamentals. This is why we will always have over- and under-valued stocks, and disciplined investors will always make a fortune by being patient and only buying when the stock is undervalued. It has been statically proven that overvalued stocks underperform over the following 10 years, and undervalued stocks outperform over the following 10 years. Yet foolish investors lack discipline and can't help but follow the crowd and buy when everyone else is buying. Then they wonder why their stocks do so poorly over the long-term. You are buying businesses, and the price you pay today dictates what you still earn in the future."
Visa or MasterCard?
in this market people shoot first and ask questions later. or maybe the machines shoot first and ask questions later.
opportunity to buy? priceless...
Let's blast through $370!!
So much for the downgrade.
"The heck happened with MA today? I’m not in, but I thought it would bounce today"
the ones who bought at 293 with a renewed tartet of 310 are sitting ducks
"Much better beat for MA than V. As has been for awhile, looks like MA remains the higher growth company than V."
"Visa reports tomorrow (Oct. 24) and will easily surpass expectations as will Mastercard on Oct.29. Load the boat on Mastercard shares. Tomorrow Mastercard will move upwards on good results from Visa, then the big run up for Mastercard as we approach Oct. 29.Mastercard is a buy and hold stock. Buy the dips and you will be pleasantly reward in the future. The reason Mastercard has fallen in price is due to ETF's cashing out of their positions, taking Mastercard lower, kinda like, dump everything that is within the ETF.Load the boat, Mastercard will be at it's all time highs sooner than you think."
people will feel so sick when they look at their books they will call in from work
200 was pandemic low in March. A ways to go.
Don't panic-sell. Hang on. It will likely tip back up.

Not going anywhere lately. Rises $10 and then goes down a couple of bucks for the next few days.
Incredible. One of the three best stocks on the market to own bar none. It’s been an honor to own it these past years. Muchas gracias MA!

crazy mood swings every day. great chance to day trade your way to a fortune.
I was right on - stock traded so suspicious coming into earnings. I should have shorted MA lol looking for $290 but may buy some more now
Go MA! 
Hold onto your MA to enjoy HUGE gains over the next month!!!
this is happening at the same time we were expecting a pull back ... coming up
What are your thoughts about MA? Does it reach $310 or slide to $270ish first? Thanks for any input.

"End of the year profit taking, rebalancing."
MA is still extremely overvalued even after the sell off. Those getting excited over dead cat bounces are fools.
The last hour will see a strong run up.....get on board.
Relax. Sooner or later will be there
MasterCard is overvalued.
falling star
Time to test it's low again. There will be no V recovery.
Great idea
"ER very soon, Visa is set for 7/28 and MA usually follows soon after. MA has been trying to break through $310 resistance for a while and seems to fail back to under $300..........if we can hold $310 this time and break out to $315-$320 by EOW, will be a good sign for approaching old high hit in March around $346."
Just have to hold tight and wait! Every single company is being affected with this virus and it#$%$ every mart of the market. Hold and sit tight. Will all rebound. Will drop another $20 I?m sure but buy on the dips and load up. This company is going anywhere just because a virus. This is what happens every time health issue comes into play! Go long and you?ll never even remember this event occurred!!
Volume up today clearing out profit takers then we're ready for the next leg up.
"is it man or machine, or both."
"U.S. retail sales climbed 4.6% in February, according to data from Mastercard's SpendingPulse tool, after adjusting for the fact that 2020 was a leap year. Without seasonal adjustments, the total retail sales increase would have been 1%. Grocery spending rose 12.4% on a year-over-year basis for the month of February,"
The pandemic coronavirus is coming from Europe to America. The stock market will collapse 100%. You will see!
Huge double top
Yea over $$200 dollars tomorrow
"What the heck, is #45 doing?"
"Mastercard’s sales growth is a negative 9% for the current quarter, only explanation why it's down"
is not only the virus... p\e 40... c'mon
gets affected drastically by negative market conditions ...but just jumps a few dollars ..on positive reports
Disagree with reaction for pandemic it was good
The mm will take this under $330 by Friday
"MasterCard has a partnership with Grab, the fastest growing company in Southeast Asia which has a population more than double the USA. MasterCard continues to be the best placed Fintech for growth outside the USA which is where the growth potential is for Fintechs. Fantastic stock to own. Onto $300 amigos."
MA will best on both the top and bottom lines!! What a heck of a earnings!! You heard it here first.
Huge resistance on the way to $300
"21% dividend increase, 8 billion share repurchase!  Happy holidays from Mastercard! "
Fantastic ER. Well done Ajay! Amazing how a behemoth like MA can continue to grow like this. Interested to hear the CC and breaking out its International growth particularly in India.
This economy is as hot as never before. Believe it!
"When JPMorgan Chase said this week that travel spending had dried up, it got Jeff Cantwell thinking. The Guggenheim analyst realized that travel-related revenue comprised a third of Mastercard’s top line last year—so he downgraded the payments company stock on Thursday to Neutral.“We think Covid-19 is a ‘paradigm changing event’ for payments,” Cantwell wrote, “particularly for cross-border.”Before the pandemic arrived, the company’s stock had been a powerhouse, quadrupling over the past five years to near $350. In early trading Thursday, the shares (ticker: MA) were down 0.6% at $255.60. The S&P 500 was up 0.2%.In a Tuesday conference call, JPMorgan (JPM) said its customers’ debit and credit-card transactions at restaurants had plunged 60%, while travel spending had nearly disappeared. That bodes poorly for Mastercard, Cantwell said in his note. Cross-border spending brought in a big chunk of Mastercard revenue and a bigger piece of profit, because of additional fees generated by international charges."
Going to be a 3%+ down day.
I think MA is due for a pullback. What are your thoughts? google aawesomestocks - they offer pretty good trade alerrts. you dont have to trade their tickers but it definetly helps you recognize possible patterns for stocks you're trading.
$5 away from ATH! Look'in Good!
BUY STONKZ
Mastercard & Visa should be a part of everyone’s portfolio
now if we can only get the Chinese to allow MA and V to operate in China as they agreed to in 2012 with the world trade organization
"the bottom is 35-36 times earnings, mastercard has never broke below that valuation. it was ran up as a safe haven from china , 44-45 times earnings. healthy correction 18% eps growth = roughly 36 times earnings, fair value $268.40 (12/31/19)"
Yes bring her down down down. MA 200.00
Going to retest $330
What's up with starting up and then sinking an hour into trading?
"There is a direct correlation with affirm being up 20% and MasterCard, Visa, Green Dot, (traditional creditors) etc being down! People will not stop using credit cards to use solely affirm, money will return here shortly after the hype dies, this is a buying opportunity"
Visa and MasterCard are ESSENTIAL for everyday life.
Should go up starting now
Soon as the market gets enough confidence to come up 500 points. Someone is pulling the trigger to knock it down to minus 1000 again. Three days in a row. This is not how the market works.
up 7000% since IPO
V reports tomorrow ditto results.
The market is not an investment vehicle anymore. It's more like a casino. Yesterday they were all selling. But today looks like they are all buying. zpre market up 600 plus.
"OK. Lets take a poll, does MA cross over and close above $345 tomorrow (Friday) and get back to $360 next week. Or does MA trend back to lower end of channel?THUMBS UP............if YES and the momentum is with us and will continue to test new highsTHUMBS DOWN....if NO and we do not break out at this time and remain in a channel $315--$365I voted first.....THUMB UP"
MA is one of those stocks you know is going to go up finally but today it seems like it just can't stop going down. It could easily close at 370 or 380 no way to predict.
MA is looking bullish!!!
Very choppy trading for MA — as investors await FED head announcement and news conference!*** Nice buy point for a potential rally into the closing  bell!
"Will we break $400 in 2020? My bet is yes, with some rockiness along the way."
BIG BOYS ARE COMING TO PICK CHERRY NOW. INDEX WIPES OUT THE LOSS THIS MORNING.
"Excuse me MA, are you going to pop  today ? Please help "
Too cheap here. Buying more.
"Whats wrong with this, holiday buying is up 5% so MA and V are down.."
LOOK AT MA RALLY!!!
If you missed yesterday’s opportunity... today is the day!
Like I said that pullback was a gift. Early Xmas present. We can now resume our assault on $300. Carry on. :))
ma is going to $200 Next week! you people will see.
"... Additionally, B Of A downgraded Air, Food, Water, The Internet, and Sex, claiming: ""The Markets are flooded with these commodities, demand is flat, and we see no further upside"". This downgrade would be the craziest call for maybe the last 50 years... but crazy like a fox! EVERYONE knows that earns. are going to blow-out. Biggest 4th qtr. on record. Start buying NOW!!. Don't bother waiting for price to break and surpass previous highs. The bad news isn't pushing the Mkts down anymore. Profess. Siegel at Wharton said the bottom is in, and he is right! We are up from here, and its about time! ;)"
"A few months ago I warned everyone on this board that MA was extremely overvalued. Yes, it is a great company, but great companies don't make great investments when they are overvalued. I owned MA for eight consecutive years before selling earlier this year when I locked in an eight bagger. Yes, I made eight times my money by buying MA when it was undervalued and selling it when it became overvalued. Those jumping on the bandwagon this year were overpaying. No asset deserves an unlimited valuation."
Strong finish for MA!!!
I'm predicting $242 after earnings with a slow and steady rise thereafter.
"MA reports earnings in the pre-Market — before the opening bell!- It would be prudent to consider nibbling, or adding before earnings because MA might catapult to well over $400 in the pre-Market, and perhaps never look back at sub $400 level!- Just a few points to ponder as we close in on the final 2 hours of trading."

PLEASE
Bearish reversal?
Story just keeps getting better ^
"MasterCard price target raised to $400 from $350 at Wells FargoWells Fargo analyst Donald Fandetti raised the firm's price target on MasterCard to $400 from $350 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes the hand off of the baton to the U.S. consumer from forbearance/stimulus nation will be relatively smooth. He also expects significant pent up travel and entertainment demand to drive spend in the U.S. in mid-to-late 2021 and global travel late 2021/early 2022. This set-up makes the card issuer shares more attractive near-term and the networks slow grinders then better H2 stocks, Fandetti contends."
Geez...what's wrong with this stock today? All the financials are going up and this has been falling.
..it peaks 10 - 20 dollars once every 3 months..stays there for three days...and then drops 40 dollars
"If MA cannot brake 335, short it"
It drives me nuts to see the stock (and V) get crushed for no reason I can find. Is the business model in trouble or is this a buying opportunity?
If u sold today please stop trading
"The issue...imo, people are selling MA to free up cash for stocks like Apple, Tesla etc etc etc. I get it. why hang out in a stock (MA) that has not dome much for several months when other stocks are flying. I am fortunate enough to own MA as well as the other two mentioned. Loving this MA card dip and adding."
not selling. keeping it for 20 years
"Tomorrow wait for the index drops three digits and get in to pick up cherry again. Little Kim did it again with the short range missile. WS will be panic again for the fourth week in a row. Pentagon knew since Saturday, and Trump did not say any thing, so it is non issue again, unless the market makers want to stir some action."
Long now or REGRET.
MA is killing it this week!!
"Terrible day for the whole markets, let’s stay positive with tomorrow’s record earning. I don’t see a reason why such a stock continue to underperform. Soon to bounce back."
"Hey mastercard, do you know how much business you are losing because of Microsoft. On an almost daily basis, Microsoft is loading unwanted, junk apps on our computers. And while this happens, we can't go to amazon, or any net site, and buy anything. WHy don't you tell Microsoft how they are hurting your business, before we all take our computers, and our credit cards, and flush them down the toilet. Microsoft is the worst source of malware on the planet."
"The ""profit takers"" sold already! Those that held MA stock will be rewarded ""big"" by next week!!! GO MA GO!!!"
I've owned MA since IPO and I've never seen this stock go down this much. Normally one or two days being down and then it bounces back but this has been like 7 straight days of decline
Solid.
GO AMZN GO!!! Big earnings next week!!!

"If they didn’t cut forecast, this would be up 6.00."
"40 cent per share dividend per quarter. I am long MA, but seriously have to ask, why even bother with such a poor dividend. MA should just hold the money for future growth."
"Tons and tons of liquidity has been added to the economy by the fed and Congress, the government would almost have to fail before this stock would fail and at that point no one would be thinking much about money."
"anyone know what is going on? ma and v are two of the most stable stocks, but they're getting crushed this year"
"MA & V remain on sale just days before Qtr earnings release next week.- Q4 is historically the dynamic duo’s top revenue and profit Qtr — given the fact of higher consumer spending and higher seasonal travel during Halloween , Thanksgiving and the holiday season!*** It’s time to buy into these discount level prices for significant gains going forward!"
what's going on here
"Good time to buy. Looking at the chart, we are under our 50 day simple moving average, with RSI of 43 which shows this is oversold. Good luck all!"
If you love $MA just like I do I created a video over on YouTube showing you the exact moments to buy with the highest returns and the least amount of risk.I can’t post a link so just search for my channel “Daniel Bragg” video titles “Don’t buy MasterCard stock until you watch this video....”Let me know what you think!!
Profit taking today. Relax!
70% ROE? Now that’s something you don’t see everyday..
We will be taking out the old high soon. The company/stock in great shape and position. MA is a keeper. Hold it and forget it. No over analyzing on this one.

"There ya go. Was wondering why this stock keeps climbing,without giving me a chance to buy back in on a dip. So I bought back in. Sold the farm. Now it dips. You're welcome."
apple card is gonna be processed by MA y'all!
"I've owned the MVP trifecta for years and I must say that MA and V are getting left out in the cold right now. Neither is still anywhere near their respective highs prior to the March crash. Meanwhile, I've done great with Paypal but Square is really the place to be. Perhaps after a prolonged run, it might be time to rotate out of V and MA and into something else. The dividends are virtually non-existent anyway."
MA 52-week high is $ 214.28.
I bought more at $147.30
Very low $300’s on the way. Here we come
"Barring any disruption, V and MA will be the next 2 companies to get to $500B in market cap. Wouldn't surprise me if they get to $1T over the next 7 years."
No upward momentum
"Like the saying, says ""buy on rumor, sell on news""And the news isn't going to be good for the next 2 quarters...."
"As a 19 year old UK investor, this is one of the best stocks I have found. I bought in at $195 and will be holding long term. Looking to buy Visa soon too but wary of a correction. Great stock"
Just read the ER. Fantastic numbers and the stock up about 4%. Contrast that with the Visa. That’s why I said on here many times why I dumped all my Visa into MasterCard. I owned them both and year over year MA always outpaced Visa. Finally had enough of that and put it all into MA.... and haven’t looked back since.
$0.33 a share quarterly dividends is nicely divisible by 3. Previous split was 10 for 1 at $800 giving $80 shares. I'd bet that a 3 for 1 split happens in april.
We are poised to break out. We all time high by Easter.
"Well, in a bad Friday selloff MA survived the hit quite well. I got out of Microsoft and AMD but track my portfolio. My losses were around $2500 on MA, but still in the green for $800.00 for one week. AMD I would be down $15000 today and Microsoft down $5000. so all in all. I don't feel too bad."
Here is how you make money in the market 1. think about the way the market should move then choose the other direction lol
I think it will go lower because there are millions of transactions miss just with air travel and cruises and with all the sports cancellation.
Target raised to $370 from $320 at Susquehanna.
will this stock go down tomorrow when fed cut is out??
This should be $260+ after earnings. I can see this popping 10% after a fantastic earnings.
MA & V are among the greatest global businesses on the planet!*** This embrace of cryptocurrency processing on their platforms will be pure gold — by opening the door to trillions of facilitated transactions from merchants and consumers on all continents — for the dynamic duo!

Still waiting for MA and V to have there massive upside day! The day will come soon! Stay long and strong. Continue to add to the portfolio. Will pay off in the long run!!
Why has this been down of late? You would have thought with banks killing it MA would be at new highs the last few days!
MA too good of a stock to sell off 3 days in a row. This will rally later today
"10 bucks in 10 days, unbelieveable."
is it gonna be ok?
Nice sell off.
Markets up but it doesn't matter. Everyone is jumping ship.
Hi (((ma))) anyone going into earning?
MA to $380 by EOW............dilemna will be do I take some off the table!
Regeneron news out tonite the data looks fabulous
I don't think the market makers will repeat the long squeeze pattern again today. I think they can not do it with Jackson Hole. Wait a few hours then see what will happen to the market. I guess index today will go up triple digits.
I hope you didn’t short this over the weekend.
"Can somebody Please turn off the sell programs, just for like 3 days in a row. Thanks"
Tomorrow Amex report.

Economy is in deep trouble. Visa and Mastercard are telling you so.
In at $317.8531 a share......Road to wealth ...anyone can trade MA and V.
"Wow! What a bargain here under $300. I don't think it will remain under $300 for too much longer, so load up while you can. Good luck all!"
Buy pullback in MA for huge gains!Mute the noise and buy the bargains!
MA is rocking today!!! Yeah!!!
How can this stock not be at $160+ right now? Makes no sense. Is it fully valued here?
just recently upgraded from 285 high price to $310. I just bought 600 at the 277 level. Will hold and ride. to earnings.
Time to take profit.
buy order in 225... cant wait.. hated to have to sell it when it hit my 320 target early in the year...
What happened here -AH it went up 4%
I bought this during its early November dip glad I did.
Going back to $300 by end of next week
"BUY, BUY, BUY...…………..WEEEEEEEEEEEE"
I find it incredible that every stock I own dropped big at exactly 2:04pm. I won 12 diversified stocks and everyone one dropped at that moment in time.Does anyone else see this in their portfolio?

"Load up now before it gets to $500 in a few years. Reminds me of $MA during its early IPO days. Wasn't following the market 12 years ago, so missed on that monster. Got in on the ground floor for $SQ as to not make the same mistake again."

Beating revised down lowered estimates is not a big deal. The high price of the stock says its already baked in. I say it goes down or stays flat at best.
I think a bunch of Green Day’s ahead. Strong finish to the month of May. Keep longs going.
Steve last time MA split was a 10 for 1 split at 800

MA is up 7.08% to 253.86
Looks like I’m going to be right. Not going under $200 again! Only up from here. Shout outs to the ones who bought around low!!!! Onward and upward from here! Kill it MA!!
Buy USMJ before march
lot of folks pumping on here. I would sell half now and take some profits.

buy on the dip
Good report from Visa sends this higher.
time to reup :)
Ah-- worries about foreign currency hit. That has a habit of reversing itself so the good fundamentals will win out. Buying opportunity.
On to $300. Big move upwards now to New Years.
Which is better MA or V
"Earlier in the year I was in and out of MA @ $220 with about a 12%+ gain in 60 days. However, MA strength surprised me and I went back in for 300 shares 7 days later after it had moved up to $230! Granted not a large holding, but MA has been on a tear since January 2019 when I started watching it / buying into it.. Since then I sold some calls trying to protect my gain and lower my cost basis but covering the first call at $260, added about $5 to my cost basis to get to the June 2020 $285's that were sporting a hefty $23 premium. I could not resist. My cost basis is now @ $220 but given how strong MA has since the beginning of Mar, perhaps I will have to roll them up again even though my break even point is now ~$310. Looking for some perspective from y'all who have been in MA for some time.. It looks like MA pressure is increasing to sustain this kind of momentum. I have loved the ""short 6 mo ride up but fearful about the bottom falling out. Whisper numbers indicates a very small surprise upside from the forecasted $1.82 and a forecast PT of $310 so my thought was that there was a great deal of upside to MA already built in and I was there already with my call for the top end and bottom side protection to ~$255. Thoughts?"
Down $7? Good I love a buying opportunity.
usually 8-8:30 earnings call at 9am
Then it's better to get Bankruptcy in earning as it's going down in such a good earning results .
Anyone knows? Any update? Any guess? EPS?
Over $300!!!!!
Am I the only 1 loading up @ these levels. Hold & Buy on big dips.Accumulated over 500 shares now.
"V is embracing crypto, it's beyond debate that MA will follow suit."
Santa clause is coming to toooooooown
Bellow 50MA WHATS NEXT???
Look what I said weeks ago and last week. Who said it was going under $220??? Looks like no chance of hitting those prices again! Here we go longs!! Short squeeze and back up to $280 by end of the week. Onslaught and up!! Yeeee hawww!
It got over bought on the vaccine news and is now giving some back on concerns over the huge second wave and how it will impact spending and employment. Put an order in @ $315-320.
Awesome breakout  MA was about time!
"This may hit around 350 by end of December. This stock is one of the best for long-term hold, but at the moment it’s heavily struggling. Even to come back to its pre-COVID price, 330, it will take it a few months."
"Just a blip on the radar brahs, move along..."
MA reached an all time high at 235.13
What’s the price target on this now? 350?
Reading through the ER these are fantastic numbers and growth. We’ll see what the CC says but first blush this is a blockbuster ER. Congrats ASB !

Great company just wish it was cheaper that’s why I’ve been buying $V but definitely willing to buy this company at 280

This is such #$%$! How could the stock keep dropping this much
The market response to earnings is bearish to say the least.
Remember that 3 days ago American Express Q1 2020 earnings beat estimates...https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/american-express-axp-q1-earnings-122512259.html

Bought a thousand V this week @ $190.23. Valuation is great so run Visa run!You gots to love forrest . . . .
Up 3.8% after hours. Maybe this will carry over into tomorrow.
Another buying opportunity is at hand in two of the great businesses of our time— that’s MA and V!
I got in on the IPO at 7
Any thoughts on competition from Google credit and Facebook credit affecting future profits here?
where is support...203 ?
And i sold my MA shares like a doofus to buy Visa
"Both MA and V are down a bit today vs getting back to past highs. With the economy coming back, people out and about spending again, on line sales rising and overall stock markets up.....there should be no reason MA and V is not way up. MA should easily be over $335 and Visa should be over $215, as it makes new high soon after.Lets stop holding these stocks down."
"I have to share that this stock has certainly been a welcome surprise to me...dunno what took me so long, however. My net cost basis after a $285 June 2020 covered call currently in force is $223 in March of 2019 written in July 2019. I thought that would be adequate to provide some down side protection yet give enough headroom for appreciation. As we all know, it blew right through my downside protection so I will roll this call up to the Jan 2021 $320's providing my prediction of a 5% stock price uplift occurs due to the earnings release on 1/29/2020. As of today, that makes for a ~30% annualized gain not counting the dividend yield at my cost basis and that was just bumped to 41 cents. What a winner MA has been in just 9 mos of holding.I am late to the MA party, but glad to be here...this one is a winner for my portfolio, long term..."
A Death Cross has occurred to MA on 12/26.
A new 52 week low coming tomorrow. Jump off this boat and sell!!
"just added more MC and Visa this morning, happy about it and keeping it long. pretty much the only stocks im not worried to keep, all the rest i sold and waiting for a better time to buy"
"man, I bought this to not see 5% swings"
When is the best time to take profit?
Why red premarket?! I
Sun trust target price lifted
Does anyone of you things this investment is in danger if a digital Euro or other digital currencies will be released?
resistance at 232.Can MA break to new high?
Was this upgraded?
why going down?
so insane this is MA not V
My order is in @ $380. This is a case of high expectations exceeding very good results. Is cross border Rev going to make a comeback? Yes. So buy it.
"Why MA depends on V movement.Don't get it.Resistance 335, MA has to break it before going higher"
I should have sold this morning
Will test $280 level. Excellent buying opportunity at that level. Wait for those levels and buy back in! Long term gold this stock. Will re warded long term! Fin tech mogul here.
Is after hours showing down .87?
Any comments on this new payment system Europe is putting together that they hope to have in place in 2025? Obviously could have a huge affect on MA and V
"Fact: Coronavirus is a scary event. Fact: Coronavirus will pass, like SARS, Avian flu and other Fact: Use of credit cards is increasing, while use of cash is decreasingFact: Chinese middle class will reach 600 MILLION by 2025Fact: Mastercard recently received the approval to operate in ChinaShould I keep going ?"
Valuation ALWAYS matters! Those who bought MA without considering valuation are fools.
LOL.. Every working human being in this planet has a mc or v in their wallet.. go long
"Easy way to get rich. Buy MA, V. Wait a few years. Poof! Retire early."
"Expected $1.87, whisper is $1.89 for .02 beat."
I am buying another 200 shares on this slight drop. Good luck to all longs!!! GO MA GO!!!
Wake me up when we at least get to January 2019 price level of $190￼
MASTERCARD =$$$$
Pat Couldn’t agree more with your analysis of MA & Visa... should definitely be in everyones portfolio if they constantly wanna make &!! Everyone around the world uses these cards!!
the three-month daily chart suggests MA needs to go up to about $278 before it starts a downturn. I bought January calls for 270 strike yesterday afternoon just before closing.
Red again :(
MA==garbage!
Lily.... are you an employee of Stock Dork or what?Give us a break will you!!!
PE of 41 is still way too expensive.
cryptos/blockchain are going to do good as payment processors and it is an existential threat to all traditional processors. Even if MA and V launch their own crypto currencies the margins will be way lower then what they are now.
Added!
Does someone know something? mind telling me?
It's going downnnnnn
Go MasterCard!
Selling pressure at the end.
"Got in heavy MA & V last month, not best timing but long and look for both to outperform"
Just bought MA on Friday. Blame me
Why the pump! Crypto news was out at 1 pm yearsdday
"Worried about inflation? Buy MA and V. They collect af fee on the transaction value. If inflation raised prices 10%, they would have 10% more earnings growth. Add the grow of cards and penetration world wide and you have the perfect stock. Any threats from alternative payment methods are not significant. The transactions must be financed by the banks as 85% of charges are paid on installment. The perfect equity investment."
I predict by this time next bitcoin will be known as the biggest Pyramid scheme in history
"People selling their ETF-s. MA is good, keep holding."
"you know, it did go down just recently to 260 and it was back up to 280.00 within 15 days. Dont know what all the worrying is about. I'm sure everyone said the same thing then, what happened, OMG."
Just got into this. Long term holder
It's really becoming a very strange market. Friday we sell off a 1000 points nobody wants Mastercard. Monday market goes up 1200 points everybody wants Mastercard. Tuesday comes market sells off a 1000 points nobody wants master card. Does does not make a bit of sense. You either buy or sell it but you can't do both at the same time.
Santa Rally!
$390 are in MA’s ūber-Bulls crosshairs into the closing bell !!!
It’s all good amigos. We’ve had a fantastic run and we didn’t give anything back after the ER. Look at FB getting crushed on their ER. Now it’s all smooth sailing for the next three months and the great ER will carry the day. IMHO
"Was finally able to grab a few shares on the pull-back...great company, great stock."
The FED will destroy this market
"Article mentions both V and MA will be $1 trillion dollars companies by 2023, joining AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, MSFT.Last month, there was an article said about TSLA to be $1 trillion company. Since then, TSLA is on fire.MA and V will follow."
"MA reported that sales momentum held up from Q4 holiday season into January:“U.S. retail sales, riding momentum seen last holiday season, rose 9.2 percent in January, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse.Online sales alone rose 62.1 percent online, Mastercard reported Thursday.”*** Give MA stock 2 to 4 weeks!- It’s still relatively cheap at these levels given the caliber of the business and the ongoing climb towards herd immunity— MA & V are currently wedded to that growing curve!!!"
MA reached an all time high at 330.66
Hard to beat market when all indexes on positive territory.
The Yahoo Finance's data is incorrect. The MA trades on Nasdaq After Hours look just normal.
I predict $410+ tomorrow after earnings call.
I told you. It’s going back to $300
Mastercard stock price target raised to $193 from $172 at CFRA
STOP the MADNESS !!!!
It goes down $2.50 an hour ...$10 in 4 hours ...Algos selling !!!
Wonder why we're down on a day that both the Dow and Nasdaq are way up?
Going back around $350. Wait to buy
"Just taking a breather today/profit taking. Don't get comfortable shorts, there's more pain ahead."
Does anyone actually buy this anymore? Look at the 1 year chart. Been doing nothing.

@Kris - perma-bear??? I owned MA from 2011 to 2018 and made eight times my investment. The fact that I know how to value a business does not make me a perma-bear.
MA reached an all time high at 310.23
ORDERS DOWN HITTIng itgobbled up some coins seem solid
"Glad I loaded up with GNPX weeks ago, less pain. LolShe will run over 10 soon fellow longs."
should be higher!
I dont think you know how the Fintechs make their money.......
"I sure wish I had more money to take advantage of this dip, and buy some more Mastercard now! I bought half my position at $361 in August, and the other half at $318 this past Monday. My cost basis is now at $330 a share average. I guess I'll just sell some covered calls, and wait for it to rebound which I'm confident it will. Good luck all! Except you shorts. You're just depressing."
Where will be by end of the week is the ?Plus 300 or below 300
"Just don't understand the talk about competing with V and MA. Read SQ's 10K or read along... SQ is basically at mercy of Payment Network operators like V and MA. SQ does not and will not compete directly with these two stalwarts. That's how their business is structured. SQ has to obey rules set by these Payment Networks. Period. Secondly, their 10k clearly states Visa was and is an early investor in SQ. 10% Preferred stock owner. Go figure. $Bullish $SQ $PYPL $V $MA $BABA"
Going to 280$
"the COVID lock-down has pushed a lot of cash players out of the market and on recovery there will be record transaction volume from here forward. don't be confused about all the ""competition"" in the payments space as it's all going though Mastercard and Visa. It's basically impossible to create a new payments network. The last to do it was Discover and they planned on losing $50 million a year for a decade to make it work and it's still on the traditional network infrastructure."
"Mastercard is upwards and onwards......thank goodness we all own shares is this wondeful growth stock:) Even with this pandemic, Mastercard has demonstrated how well positioned it is for the upcoming reopening of the economies throughout the world.The train has officially left the $324 station, a breif stop, so get on board, sit back, relax and put your feet up, cocktails and caviar will be served shorty. I pity those who do not own shares of Mastercard, and simply sit on the deck watching the ""Mastercard Party Train"" leave without them.""All Aboard""......"
Is $MA going to be the payments leader with block chain?
What an absolute steal at this price
Remember MA is not cranking do to Corona. But with the vaccines. Look at the 5 year chartUp it will go
MA is winner in the long run
$300 hard to break. Stock overvalued!
PayPal is moving higher
Visa and MasterCard are both rock stars and cash cows. Great to skim bucks on every transaction Buy and Hold. Home run.
MA is up 4.91% to 304.50
Dividend yield is now over 33%... for those of us who bought at IPO.
Down over $6.00 today. I wonder why????????
"As inflation kicks in for goods, services, food and travel, MA and V will benefit because instead of making $2.00 on a $100 transaction, they will make $2.10 on the $105 transaction."
retail doing well and China still has not let ma into their country except for cross border paymentsma should continue to shine
"Going to prove Ulrich wrong on Friday,uptrend will start, on our way, buy small portions and start a position,relax and enjoy"
Great buying opportunity same with V. If your in for the long haul these are the stocks to own for the next 10-20 years.
MA reached an all time high at 315.10
"{{{{ NOW THAT'S HOW YOU BUY A DIP........MA...... and AABB.... "" newschain asia broadband ""..@^@...}}}"
"In theory MA n V should be green by tomorrow, or sometime this week."
"MA and V tend to run into some rough volatility from time to time!- The best course of action is to ride it out, and better; to nibble on these temporary dips, if you have the wherewithal to do so!"
diversify between The Big Three! Master Card - Square - Visa! $$$$$$$$$
How much do you guys think MA will shoot up after Visa earnings?
Huge beat!
I agree with Dear John. there is no positive catalysts inside for the stock market. at least not in the near future. I like MasterCard and Visa. but not at the current valuations. I will choose my entry point patiently when they reach RSI 30
Mastercard is an animal They are doing all the right dealsVisa wont be able to compete anymore(My opinion)
Big governments like EU and UK and USA will use Wuhan virus to deepen attack on cash. So they can track you better and turn off your life with click of the mouse! Hillary behind this.
Just buy MA on a weekly basis. Don’t worry about price. Time will fix everything.
Oh wow I can’t believe this it’s making me more money. Thanks keep selling you bunch of morons
"See ya later 360$, September 2021 400$"
I sold @250.00 and I am paying the price
"So no one that held this stock had any stones to withstand a non-issue as minor as the coronavirus in its actual phase? One thing is clear, this will be a HUGE buying opportunity. Looking to add to my position soon even though I wasn’t planning to do so financially"
Business as usual :))
"Wait once past $198.45, then see $200 in no time"
MA now down $11 -- I see no news that would drive the stock lower. V down 2.5% PYPL down 3.3% and Sq down 4% Retail slowdown?
Earnings will be up load up on the dip now
should i buy now or...?
Aren't people using credit cards instead of cash during the pandemic?
I imagine that they will continue to miss revenues because this COVID scam is just revamping and will continue to ravage the economy
"Be taking out $300 soon. One of the three best stocks in the whole market. Hold/Add/ Keep ....till you retire,"
surprised that there are so many non-believers in MA and V.
"The ""immediate gratification"" crowd is complaining again."
sell on the news....going down
All time coming today. This stock is an unstoppable force.
"The media is using coronavirus to drive the market down. They enjoy the plunge. It's just a bunch of anarchist journalists screwing the markets up just to screw with Trump. The flu would be worse to have than coronavirus! Don't believe the media hype. They're just trying to push us into recession so Trump can't get re-elected. It's as a clear as day, don't you see it??"
Split 2 for 1 discussion is going on
$MA $JAGX bears losing strength
vs paypal..long term?
ARE YOU DONE TAKING PROFIT?! It’s going up shortly!
What was the news today causing drop?
It was recovering well throughout the day and now it’s taking a dump again.
Mastercard Q1 beats in earnings and revenue....Mastercard reports contactless payments up 40%...
MA to $ 282.00!!!
Every now and then you can catch MasterCard at a nasty dip and make some quick cash on it
$340 next stop?
Next stop 330
What. A. Great. Investment.
"MA and V are on sale 3 days before the dynamic duo will release blowout Q4 earnings!- These current trading prices will appear real cheap by this weekend —because, MA will be on pace to top $400."
Master Card holders just relax. Stock floating side ways.
I see $180
MA stock price is up 38 % this year.
"Today was the biggest drop in my portfolio for every stock I own. When the market rebounds (if it ever does), MA will lead the way higher. As they say, ""Misery loves company"". Not selling any of the stocks I own,as I am an investor, not a trader."
Great long term stock. Already going up from the lows of today!! Should get above $390 a share today. Looking for some crazy good growth over the next few months!!
MA is rallying into the close!!!
"I am long MA for several years. Seldom does MA spike on a good report, especially if they made a run up to the ER. Do not be surprised to see it go lower, in a couple of weeks it will be much higher. Just a pattern that is frustrating."
I sold it $250 .00
Red in-spite of recent upgrades. Is it because of Affirm and PayPal’s buy now pay later offering ?
"When you look at the financials of MA, there is a lot to like. Greater than 50 percent gross margins and nearly enough cash to cover all their debt. What's not to like here?"
"Why is earning report beating estimates by over 5%, but MA has grown by only 1% today?"
"Mastercard has a lot to go on the way down. It held up nicely even in the last weeks. But eventually the selling has to happen. Big funds are unloading their positions and prepare for the big economic downturn that already started. The trump-administration will be completely shocked when they see the recession next year but hey, you can always blame the FED!!"
Tanking
Time to go lomg
You telling me people don’t spend money with China US argument?
Boy. It is struggling.
Do I hear $400?
YTD it is 10% ahead of VISA.
MA is biggest holdings in my portfolio MSFT is second AMZN is thirdAAPL is fourth
Is MA going bankrupt? What's this about? Consumer spending down or something?
"Covid has reduced purchasing around the world. People are holding off buying big ticket items, the EU banks are getting together to create an alternative to American credit card companies, crypto currency is eager to replace money in general. These factors are holding MA and V back from their usual growth. What competitive advantages are going to keep them growing over the next decade?"
Every day MA dropping around 2%.........NONSENSE!!!!!
Let’s see if MA can hold gains today and stay in the green
MA will be at 230 by yr end. MA and V are must have for any long term portfolio
Everyday the same. Up in the morning and down afternoon.
MA is ready to reach a 52 week high!!! GO MA GO!!!
"Fraud on my card. Get a new card, fraud a month later. Order another card, fraud reported BEFORE THE CARD WAS EVEN MAILED!!! Can one of you morons explain to me why they are updating the card # with merchants WHO WERE AMONG THE FRAUDULENT CHARGES?!?"
You’re brain dead
Same result
nice to see $300 again
Wait under 280
Blowout ER and a Fed Cut should see MA rocket. On to $300.
Dips are buying opportunity don't miss it.
"Malls are full, Target, Walmart, Costco parking lots full. People are buying. MA $355 next week."
this isnt normal its those damn hedges shorting all the funds because they cant buy gme to get their #$%$ out of fire.
other than the new peaks it jumps up to for no known reason
"MA and V stocks selling off while PYPL and SQ gain doesn't make much sense. I could see if MA/V only made money via travel, dining at restaurants, etc. but they receive a processing fee on the majority of all online purchases as well. Way oversold."

Awesome for those MA longs who had the courage and conviction to add on the recent “inflection dips” in MA & V!
Entered today at 272.5
"I never said MA had run its course. I said MA was too risky to own at currently valuations. You need to understand the difference if you want to make money in the market and not give it all back. There is a famous saying on Wall Street: ""Worry about the downside. The upside will take care of itself."" We are currently in a raging bull market, but it won't last forever. Do you really believe you'll be able to predict when consumer spending will slow and get out of MA right before the crash? You are a fool if you believe that. We cannot predict the future, but we can sell stocks when they become overvalued. Of course, selling overvalued stocks requires going against the crowd, which is exactly what I did when I loaded up on MA for less than $25 a share in 2011. For those of you who want to follow the crowd, I wish you good luck. You're going to need it."
my best horse. another record high soon.
Can’t understand why the div is so low on such a strong stock!!
I think we test the $320s next week. It’s going to be months until we touch 340s again.
$325 was temporary top price!
Looks really good in Yahoo 'chart' view. Keeps rising.
"I give up with MasterCard!I had Visa tasc card for years through my company, they switched to Payflex by mastercard, Matercard want verification of every medical transaction for the year, Visa cards were smart enough to know charges were legitimate. I will only deal with Visa from now on as they are clearly superior. I will keep only my V stock and get rid of Ma based on this."
A lot of insider selling of late in MA. I'm hoping to add around $124
Buy on any small dips of 1-2 percent like this. There's no stopping this MA train! Covid cases going down. Vaccine and recovery soon. People are starting to spend more and more every day. Every card swipe is like printing money. Who uses cash anymore? I sure don't use it for anything. GLTA!
"I think MA will bounce back. Investors are on Standby Mode - uncertain of the new president and his policies. Let's hope he has good economic policies going forward. Based on what I've seen so far, I'm worried too. Let the Bulls Out!"
Going under $300 by weeks end 100%% legit. Wait to buy.
Credit Suisse raises target price to $380 from $340
looks like I can get in at september prices soon. which is when I sold. before I bought last week.

What are people's thoughts about Amazon dipping their toe into the payments world?
And we get an hour later down $12.50 ...We need human to take over the machines !!!
The PE was high. When you have a high PE you must continue to beat expectations or you’ll get slaughtered! I’m going to wait. Might go lower and become a good time to buy. Travel has hurt MA and I don’t see that changing anytime soon thanks to Covid
Market is reacting to Bernie's loss on Super Tuesday. Communism is bad for the stock market. And now investors can relax knowing Bernie is finished. One more bump on the road to Trump's reelection.
Buyer at $100
Mmmmm dividends :)
We’re talking stock Royalty here. Bow and curtsy when you are in the presence of MasterCard.
"$V $MA IMO what’s happening is because some investors are re distributing their wealth into other undervalued companies affected with trade war as it started to ease to gain quick profit plus the slight increase in US borrowing rate and China manufacturing deflation rate in August .Thats why despite huge sell off the index is not impacted with same magnitude( they are shuffling) .finally ,This is a great buying opportunity for longs"
We read recently that Mastercard was going to stop using its name on Credit cards and just go with the logo because it's so well-known. Haven't seen any change yet!
good luck all longs tomorrow morning
Very weak stock.
33x multiple will be slashed to 29

The question now is: does one hold on to the FAANG stocks or will there be a better alternative sector going forward? And if so, which 5 stocks within that sector would you invest in? My answer to all of the above is, I believe the below five stocks will be the top performers of the S&P for the next six months (I refer to the picks as BPMCS):BLACKROCK $BLKPAYPAL $PYPLMASTERCARD $MACME GROUP $CMECHARLES SCHWAB $SCHWBPMCS stocks might have performed 15% YTD vs 40% of the FAANG stocks, BPMCS has however, half the forward P/E multiple than FAANG and almost double the ROE.Again, I’m not predicting that FAANG will do poorly from now on, all I’m prognosticating is that BPMCS will be the top 5 performing stocks in the S&P from now till the end of the year.AP"
150---This will be 150 in two weeks if not sooner. If the entire world is shutdown and no money is being spent then how does anyone think MasterCard can make money. This is justblike the airlines or cruise linesTIMBER
What makes me laugh. Now you will hear all about up grades
"Guyd wake up the growth stocks are in correction mode the next 6months---DOCU is a great company --will be fine i first bought at $86 ,...but this will consolidate between $170 and $200 ..."
Do earnings come out pre or post?
Let’s go MA!! Keep the sunshine coming!! Bought the dip today!! I think MA will have some good news in next few months
Simply the best out there. Glad I dumped all my Visa into MasterCard a couple of years ago. And we are just getting started amigos.
These guys are profitable you must buy
"Don't get it, great retail numbers and we are fading on MA. #$%$"
Yep look at that....up almost 3%
"By earning date, MA will be $325-$330"
If Amazon has a great month of sales where do you think they paid for it with MASTER CARD. Why are we not over 330.00. Lets get up there already.
"Get in now, good luck guys, market will turn green soon"
Buy at $305 !!!!!
what is mastercrad doing with blockchain ?
Needs to trade sideline for awhile.
GO MA GO!!! THE BULLS ARE HERE!!!
Accumulate MA on this “opportunistic pullback on the heels of strong earnings.
Bought more shares
6 hours later and were green! Great day today.
Are you crazy? Just relax and enjoy your investment. Don’t look it every day.
Profit taking!
"This is MasterCard, it did okay even in the shutdown, but now with shops open in the US and around the world, this stock should be popping! MasterCard gets business both at home and internationally. I'm a bit surprised it not back near it's highs."
No follow up buying after yesterdays squeeze. Weak hands in this one only.
One analyst thinks that MA is best stock to buy from buffets portfolio. How much more bullish can you get!! I feel a huge week coming ahead for the fintech juggernaut
What a great investment this has been. It’s only the beginning too
MA is down 6.74% to 316.81
democrats have to stop the republicans socialism for the wealthy
"Looking for an earnings pop to at least fill the gap on the ""Cramer fade"" we say today...could surprise big tomorrow."
"Visa back to all-time highs this morning. MA should follow and make new highs soon as well. Less than 1% away at this point. If you bought MA at the lows in 2008, you'd have about 18-times your investment now. Wow! Good luck MA longs..."
"Record cyber sales means record cc charges means record transaction fees for MA and V. Translation BUY, as I said earlier MC down is NONSENSE!"
Given the recent cratering of FB and NFLX a small dip isn't so bad.
RUN SHORTIES RUN...…..
"Visa and Mastercard are the two best investments I have ever made. The better retail sales do, especially online, the better V & Ma do.The better Apple does, the better V & MA do.The better Amazon does, the better V & Ma do.The more houses bein built, the better V & Ma do (furniture buying as well as contractors buying construction materials.The more cars added to the roads, the more gas needed, thus, the better V & Ma do.The cell phones sold, the better V & Ma do.The more hotels, airbnb, uber rides, the better V & Ma do.The more airline travel, trian, buses, the better V & Ma do.More and more retailers and restaurants are going cashless, the better V & Ma do.Want to take an online course, the better V & Ma do.Schools are going cashless (pizza and milk orders for the kids, the better V & Ma do.As the population throughout the world increases, more and more people using, you guessed it, Visa and Mastercard.I can go on and on and on. Yet, regardless, all roads lead back to Visa and Mastercard.An just think, 85% of all transactions throughout the world as still with cash. Visa and Mastercard are just getting strated.No wonder each has increased over 800% over the last 10 years.....in 25 years, had they never split, they would be worth $20,000 per share.......buy and hold, these two stocks will continue going up for decades to come."
Tomorrow is going to be at 278.00.
"Bought MA at the IPO !!! Have held since then. Yeah; I'm up over 3000 % !!! Can't sell now, The Freekin IRS will take me to the cleaners !!!"
"Chart looks bearish, hope earnings are good"
Move to visa
"Rough day means add more, just added 100 at 211"
"MA and V are both dropping which is absolutely crazy and I'll be adding more if MA gets down to its 200 Day Moving Average around $345 or so!Bottom line: States are opening up (even Blue States), consumers pent up demand high, people are flush with cash, travel especially business travel starting up, summer vacation season upon us, inflation means higher prices=higher revenue on fees and so on.MA just reported a 10% increase in spend from pre-covid levels from 2019.In Short, sell-off on MA and V is absolutely STUPID!"
feel good for owning V & MA
"Just curious, with everything going on with the market dropping everyday BIG what was that imbecile NAVARRO thinking about saying anything let alone adding doubt to the China negotiations. No need to say this today, could wait until more time to negotiate. Market dropping with YE rebalancing etc this was not the time to do this............IDIOTS! Maybe it is TRUMP and his stupid so called experts that is killing the economy."
"Just pick up 200 more shares at a steal of a price. Thanks to all "" The sky is falling "" people out there."
My guess is MA and the others were down because of WMT's announcement of a fintech startup.
Trading at $330 in the premarket. This is a buy and hold stock forever!
"All we need is another 2 days of some good news, lower new cases or some pharma break through etc and MA will get to $280 over the next few days. Then back to $300 going into ER! We will not see the old highs until the CoronaVirus is completely done for this season, and a vaccine is inevitable."
Why is it going down after good earnings?
"Congrats to all the longs. It's been a tough year, watching so many stocks rip upward while MA treaded water. But this is a long-term play for me and even if we never get the meteoric rise of the meme or FAANG stocks, I'll be content if we continue to outperform the broader market over the long haul."
Ma will not reach a new high until cross border trade and travel get back closer to normal. That's where the money is for both MA and V
It could go back under 300$
This stock is no good goes down every day
On to $290 as the MasterCard Machine moves on.
"MANIPULATION is very clear today for MA stock. Only thing I want to know why SEC does not investigate this one. i believe it is manipulation for sure. I hope that the media will take serious about this one. Yahoo should investigate why the index is up but MA is down, while the other financial stocks do not move in the same direction of MA>."
How are we down today??
MA reached a new All Time High at 156.23
BITCF and SING bitcoin
"I only have a small amount, want to buy more but should I wait for a pull back?"
Cratering into oblivion. Garbage stock
whatever we supposed to gain today evaporated yesterday
"Dean, we are going to hit a price target of $300 before October. The wives and kids will be stoked about our new yacht. People that don't own MA either have problems or do not understand the demand of their position in the market."
MA cannot go higher due to VWhy MA depends too much on V.I don't get it
Here comes $ 215.00!!!
MA & V headed to green paydirt at the closing bell!!!
Inflation on the rise. Prices going up. MA makes money based on transaction fees. Higher prices means a higher fee. Everything tells me MA should be going UP not DOWN.
"wow, even MA has discount on sale before holiday, anyone buying?"
This stock keeps moving like a powerful machine. Awesome
"I guess some profit taking is almost done for MA this morning. I try to figure it out the geopolitic is still on or not. It has no issue with N KOREA, but local political issue just starts. Tax issue may be the one which Wall Street may pay attention the most, and I guess it is no issue because big corp. always contribute big amount of money to both parties."
"Earnings can't be just good, they're going to have to be great in order to get the bad taste out of everyone's mouth with all the previous days of selling"
Stock is going towards $315
Europe CV mortality rate is 10%. US about 2%. Why such a large difference. CV is not showing any signs of slowing down.
"Good time to BUY, MA may see 175$ today or tommorrow.Market is due for a GOOD BOUNCE"
Strong Green by the end of the day!
Im new to MA but I think is always a good stock to have. Whats the entrance price you would recommend me? I think this is going up but its always appreciated to have some other points of view. Thanks
"did i get ucky, or is more bad news sending this Market even lower; yesterday converted 300 shares of MA held in traditional IRA, into Roth IRA... the silver lining in this pullback is Tax Avoidance"" going forward when virus allow pent-up demand to launch economy back as it might do in Asia, South Korea... plus, with this $trillion Stimulus it highly probable governments will be forced to later raise ALL Tax rates to offset cost of Stimulus, losses business and the unemployed."
can it touch 215let do it
trash of the century's. not expecting a green but at least not down so much in a few days... this should be a very good stock
I’m sure it’ll hit new 52 week lows with the way markets are going! But point is it’ll bounce back and get new highs! Just have to be patient and calm!
If this breaks 265Can happen very quickly
MA & V are in full breakout mode!- The dynamic duo are strengthening their businesses for sustained growth over the long haul!
my comments keep disappearing...it was a bit long..but i need to understand if i feel the same or others are observing as well
"This is a gift down here, MA and other indicators stated Holiday sales was very strong. Should bode well for ER this quarter. I think we run up to $210 into ER."
Will reach all time high soon.....
Te germaphobes afraid to touch cash and with the coin shortage should fuel earnings
Calls or puts?
"Where is Greg, fully negative minded"
"Before yesterday, this was down YOY. Not good for a supposed. Blue chipper."
"MA...a dream for longs, a short's worst nightmare. 400 will be here soon and I would sure as hell not want to be caught with my pants down betting against it."
190 AFTER ER??? WHAT DO U GUYS THINK?
Let's take out the 52 week high and blast through $400 by earnings!! Congrats Longs!
Thought we would see a better reaction from a great earnings report. Is this downturn coming from the rate decrease tomorrow?
These prices are a gift...loaded the boat today to compliment my shares at my $170 cost basis. Once the dust settles MA is gonna take out 400. MA shorts have a death wish. They will bleed from every orifice once the rally starts back up.
$300 today
Here we go amigos. India the next Fintech frontier owned by MasterCard.
"Every use Master and Visa in traction, it is gold opportunity . Load more share MA and V"
Going up to fast
"More and more people prefer to use digital payment now. Can $V or $MA still be popular in the future? From Finstead website, it indicates that Quarterly Revenue Growth of $V and $ MA are 25.8% and 13.3%, respectively. I also find that of $PYPL is about 18.3%, which is lower than that of $V, but higher than that of $MA. I think $V and $MA is losing market."
Another rough day for MA and V.
Looks like scary ppl sold their shares
Starting to feel like Dec 2018 all over again
Company reports 9% profit growth and the stock goes down? The financial institutions or forcing MA a down so they can make a big grab for if that a good price.
great company but overvalued.
200 AFTER ER??? WHAT DO U GUYS THINK?
280 and next new high
MA terrible performance/sell up go to paypal
just sold all shares. the earning is way lower than I expected and it will follow the current trend of V in the coming days.
Yellen just sweet talks to the market. The market responds by shooting up triple digits.
"Today MA should be on cloud 9, I am waiting for MA hit 135, then again I will hit with Sept 15, call 137"
Stellar report...congrats to all!
this is in sale Monday morning if not right here at 270. Jan or later calls look good imo
Going red
"This is way overdone for MA............we are on the verge of getting through this shutdown, and MA (all credit cards) will be more required for the post-virus world like on-line buying, plastic vs dirty money, and needing credit for bills while households get back to earning; to name a few.MA should get back to $275 and see it topping around $300 once there are signs of parts of the country opening up."
Wish I had bought more on those dips.
On the call they warned about the European Commission Fees that could be couple of Billions.
last time earnings beat revenue beat & guidance was positive & the stock went down for a whole week. let's see how it goes this time.
Going nowhere as the market bounces back. We've gone from darlings of Wall Street to being doubted by Wall Street.
MA needs to start having some Green Day’s!! Just too much red in a row and no uptrend!! Let’s get some positive news and move this sucker up!!
This is a good buy point for MA. MA will reach $ 205 in the next hour!!!
Looks like another buying opportunity in the works!
SO why is MasterCard crashing with all the good news coming out about MasterCard?
Cool
Time to load up MA.
sky's the limit
Stock overvalued and overbought!!!
Down down don’t stop let’s keep it going. Sell sell sell. I’m making so much money 
BOOM goes the dynamite!
Top and Bottom line beat. Awaiting guidance
"MA back on track guys, congrats ! ;-)"
Looking at 644
How rich is it that executive pay is tied in part to the environment considering their only product is made of plastic and they use a ton of electricity to produce their product. Corporate America has lost its freaking mind chasing the stupid woke item of the moment.
temperature drops too
Almost recovered all the drop for the day. Setting up to open at $259 tomorrow morning and touch $265. That's almost $20 from today's close
Mastercard is now banning people for being conservatives. Welcome to the new world of coorperate SJW'ism. Terrifying times ahead.
Expect excellent 2nd Quarter earnings for MA!! Consumers are spending!!
Who uses Mastercard. Open your wallet or purse. EVERYONE
"If ma reports bad ER, market is going to tank along with Faang, doesn’t look good, everything is red"
WHAT'S GOING ON ? WHY THE DROP????
"As is said. 3% drop is minimum target for today, 4% is more likely and 5% isn't that far off either."
"To quote Chauncey Gardner, flowers die in the Winter and bloom in Spring:)"
Don’t understand MA and V. Where is all of the upward movement. All other stocks keep flying and these are moving sideways at best. What’s the info about these two companies?
MA is rocking today!!! GO MA GO!!!
Tremendous stock - on a dollar basis rather volatile when trading options - if you are on the right side at the right time WHOA !! If not OUCH .
New all time highs comingFolks better get aboard $ma rates are rising $spy

look at pre market...hihi
Up 4% today @ $334.74.
I would buy it if it’s pe goes down... not saying price should go down... maybe earnings go up? That’ll be better
"The action on MA and V is absolutely crazy, I understand a drop from its highs becaue of the world is shutting down for 15 days or so and people are self isolating. But todays drop is 30% gloom and doom pundits and 70% our idiot congress who cant get their act together to pass something.Even the loss of wealth and destruction of the people they serve does not motivate them to act quickly. If I had a choice I would vote them all out into the streets."
When it drops as the open I'm going all in.
Visa is a better buy
"have had ma for 10 months ,just about break even may as well take your money to vegas.this is a fools game"
All time high soon
Looking to buy into a MA position. Any advice or important considerations for next 10 years? Seems like one of the best stocks to own and seems on sale

Earnings release after market close tomorrow?
Beats estimates and still negative? What gives?
Why didn’t this go up on the American Express earnings report?
"Buying more V and MA this morning. They are well off the highs, had good quarters, and I think these recent downgrades focus on the short term, not the long term. I own SQ and PYPL as well. Those 4 are digital payments, which are the future. AXP I’m not as bullish on."
yes my best horse so far in covid19
This is good for MA... https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-participate-upcoming-investor-conference-141700069.html
How low is she going to go?
"seems like a great buy at these prices, anyone disagree?"
Why is it going down??
What a steal here
MA is down 5.24% to $179.37
Will see what happens tomorrow with the stock. Bet it goes down another 2/3% minimum
Is this a solid stock to hold for the long term in my portfolio?
So if I buy now will everyone thank me for tanking it?
MA has been very neutral since highs of 380. Let’s hope today is the start to a new path forward
THE Master of all credit cards. The de facto stock you want to own. Own it and forget it. Onwards to $300 amigos. :))
"Think...The BIG Short. Long way down from here. These will fall in half as people stop paying their bills. Second to housing, personal debt is is in the Trillions, AND it will not be bailed out when it goes bad. Some stores have already stopped accepting these cards because of their fees, and the trend will continue. Bitcoin is alive and well. Zero fees. V, MA, AXP, etc. all in BIG trouble."
why is mastercards gm% so much lower than visa?
285 on the road
Concerned about MA's p/e ratio and a lack of stimulus. We need to beat in 2 weeks by a considerable margin
"Seems like Smart Money $BRK.A Berkshire Hathaway and Fisher Assets Management are in the $AXP (American Express)Buffet, will never sell $KO and $AXPProblem with American Express, some small vendors, do not want to take it, or charge extra $1 Recently I wanted to to buy coffee at small doughnuts shop, they would charge $1 extra . American Express, does not have volume, tentamont to $V - Visa and $MA- Master Card. And another low volume low circulations Discover card. American Express, charges higher processing fees, so vendors do not like it.$SQ will take over as a fintech. As soon as it gets Bank charter, it will take biz from all credit cards processing companies. I conjecture, American Express is a dieying breed."
Best money I've ever made in my life with investing.
Does MasterCard give loans?
The VIX is is at 40. Never seen that high before so hang on. It's gonna be rough.
"Here is my theory. $PYPL, $SQ, $MA and $V are all reporting this week or by the end of month. The big boys are pushing the price down because they anticipate bad reports for the payment sector. When the report gets released, retail investors and algos will sell at the already reduced price, pushing price even lower. Thats when the big boys can scoop up all the shares at a low price."
Doesn’t look good going into earnings.
"Tech section is on right now, which I disagree anyway particularly FB."
"No job,no problem!use your credit card, don’t wanna carry cash? Use your credit card! Wanna but that fancy face mask online? Use your credit card! Don’t wanna go in the gas station because of germs? Use your credit card. Get the idea? This stock is a power house that will rise like fresh baked bread!"
"Morgan Stanley AKA BigShort wants everyone to sell everything. Relax, don't give in."
I'm a little bullisch
when can we see 370?
I bought some this morning thinking it will go up but didn’t know it was fake
"easy money both V and MA....downside on MA is $193 upside is $225....do the math. It is SAD that the Fed is killing the market. They are not looking at all the factors in the economy, it looks to me they set the interest rate hikes and will not deviate. They just keep hiking regardless of recent issues both macro and micro, its the path to get to a certain rate."
Double tops everywhere $cat $ma
"I like this company a lot , but the pe ratio is making me shy atm."
"@Kevin H - There is a valid reason for MA's decline. It is still extremely overvalued. Remember, great companies make terrible investments when you overpay."
Downgrade means strong Sell!!!
Visa misses and Mastercard drops? Why?
Will find out big news against MA tomorrow in court. See what happens.
Look at MA rock!!!
"I wish I had more $ to buy now. Got some at 322, then kept going down!"
"Benjo, you must be paid by the post you are on a lot of boards spreading doom and gloom. seems like a pretty pathetic life"
Great day for MasterCard the Rolls Royce of FinTech and within 1$ of all time high. Great company to be in and did I mention the China need. Hehe. On to $500.
Incredible day! Big day mañana !
"stock is a dog, goes nowhere"
"Mastercard has an ROCE (return on capital employed), of 38%. In absolute terms is a outstanding return and it's even better than the IT industry average of 10%.!!!*** MA & V will be the point businesses — leading the U.S., and global Economy back to normalcy — as we emerge from the Pandemic!"
Looks like $300 by Christmas 
"Stripe is the new big deal competing with Paypal. It will have no affect on V or MA as they work with both. It is not a bypass proticol for credit cards. It is also tiny compared to Paypal which is the online market leader by far. They have double digit eps growth and only a 22x PE vs 17x for the SPX. If V and MA are getting hurt by Stripe, it is amisconception. V is only selling at a 15% PE premium to the SPX and is growing at 16% vs 7% for the SPX. Go figure."
W
"Looking to see another rally in the upper 280s or very low 290s. MA usually hits a resistance and falls for 2-3 days then rallies again on trade news. Over sold and Over bought, would have almost thought it was a extremely reliable pump and dump."
What’s going on with MA? Stock is just getting beat up and killed. What is the legit bottom going to be? This and visa and been pretty pounded compared to the sector and rest of tech stocks. Crazy.
U guys are clueless by raising swipe fees $ma $v u will drive busineses to crypto $sq $pypl
MA really struggling quickly here. Lost over $30 a share in a span of a few days. Not the trend we’re looking for! Need some positive news here.
MA is sitting at a relatively good price on the eve of the launch into earnings season!*** Investors are actually looking at a MA stock that could soar way beyond current level over the next year with a U.S Economy that’s poised to boom- Today offers a great opportunity to get ahead of the crowd of buyers on the sidelines who will be chasing the MA & V surge for the rest of this year and beyond
It can’t hit the 390 I think it will never happen (lol)
i got back in at $260 :( are we in trouble already
230 next level with lockdown
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-incorporated-host-conference-call-201000039.html
"I'm a long term share holder of Mastercard shares. I orginally got into Visa a few weeks after it's IPO (March 2008) then in 2014 decided to sell my Visa shares and buy Mastercard shares. If you look at the long term chart, Mastercard just keeps going up and up. On average $120 a year, excluding this past year due to the pandemic. Mastercards posted strong numbers this morning despite world economies bieng in a lockdown for almost a year now. Mastercard is always a buy whenever it dips in share price. With a 6 Billion dollar share buy back program underway, on top of the previous 6 Billion share buybask program, Mastercard will continue to propel upwards.Next year (January 2022) Mastercard will be approx. $445/share, give or take a few dollars up or down.Online shopping has accelerated due to Covid, and with the world still using approx. 85% cash transactions, the wind is in the sails of Mastercard (and Visa) for many decades more."
New 52 week high today. With AXP earnings beating that should bold well for MA moving forward.
How is MA not up on the vaccine news? Nuts
"11:05 AM, 1 million shares purchased."
bought MA 315.45 Price is temptation and MasterCard earning most of the time is good
Why this is red?
$225 B
I'm still in puts. Down about 10 cents/contract. I'm waiting for MA to decisively pick a direction.
This selloff is absolutely overdone.
We seem to be hitting some resistance
MA trading in oversold territory!
pure manipulation look at all other credit cards
7 days left. Rumor is CC sales are down 50% in the last two months. Better hang on tight. It's not looking good.
What a buy under 200
BUY BUY!
"OWNING MASTERCARD MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I AM SITTING AT THE TABLE OF THE TRILATERAL COMMISSION AND NOW I HAVE THE 30000 FEET VIEW OF ALL THE ACTION, HOW MUCH MORE POWER CAN WE ASK FOR FROM OUR PORTFOLIO?"
Stock trading in huge premium. Should temporarily be paused.
MA go go go
Back up Monday...better cover
MA bought @ ipo was just a fantastic stock....a small ($2K) investment now worth over $100K
Was fun while it lasted. Bull market 2009-2018.
Wall Street gotta love them lol. MA down over $5 .... Meanwhile there are bidding up TGT and other retailers will no growth. No thank you. I will add again to my MA holdings.
The toilet continues
"Just like the energizer bunny... it just keeps on going & going... up ,that is!! Love this stock!"

would love to see them take out square. Would be a dream team. Two very innovative companies
"Same pattern as last week, someones try to suppress MA again, exactly like last week. Last week MA was suppressed down more than 1 points, I think 1.03, then came back lost less than .10 at the close. I think MA will push back at the close and move to hit high this week."
265 or 262.50 close?
Ofc there will always be those who don't see it coming. Don't listen to those fools. This is the end. And it will be ugly.
It seems we are starting a nice climb up. Beginning with a 2.28% gain so far today. I think this will be back to $360 plus here very soon. Good luck to all!
MA embraces crypto I warned investors on here it would happen soon after V. Congrats to those of you that bought the dip. 400 will be here soon! Crypto is rocket fuel for digital payment names.
MA upgraded to OUTPERFORM by Daiwa Capital.
$189 last year end ...? momentum rotation
"Opening up the economy, pent up demand, covid cases going away.....MA and V should be rocketing to new highs. This is all about political failures and the crushing of our country by incompetencies."

Now we wait and see what tomorrow morning brings for earnings!!
"As a counterpoint to you dour and depressive forward outlook:- I present mine—I The FED is backstopping the U.S. Economy during the Pandemic!*** Rule 1 has been temporarily revised to: dDon’t Fight The FED during this COVID-19 Pandemic!- Plus, if History can serve as a “rhyme” — the aftermath of the “Spanish Flu” Pandemic of 100 years ago was an Economic  explosive boom known as the “Roaring 1920’s”!!"
MA reached an all time high at 346.66
"Question for the board what is the best online broker to use? As far as user friendly, cheap, no strings attached."

MA breaking out today people!
Most amazing stock I have ever owned. No where but up.
"This will keep going up,good mgmnt team with good ideas on how to make $"
The whole Market is in correction so it has a lot more room to move up after the elections. All part of the game.
"This drop across the board, turning all the up indices now in the red is BECAUSE the head of the Philly Fed needed to get on CNBC and hint at what Powell will say tomorrow. The drop came to the minute of this CNBC segment. The most concerning comment for me is that ""we are moving back to normal growth of 2%....."".

The new target for Mastercard is $365.
Just bought in some but still have more cash for Monday
"UP, UP, and AWAY!!!"
Time to buy more shares !!
Hoping for MA to hit 200$ to load up the truck!
Back to $250's soon. This stock has had such a run and is trading at loft historic levels. Market considerations will push this down further and give us another great buying opportunity. I will add in mid $240's.
price looking good  but cross border transactions still way off and that is where the biggest profits lie
I'm buying the dip. This price action is laughable.
"Greeting Long Term Mastercard Investors.I've been a shareholder of Mastercard for approx. 12 years. I was orginally invested in Visa yet decided to switch my portfolio to Mastercard as it is growing earnings at a slightly faster pace. Both companies are superior in my opinion. I am a retail investor like the rest of the crowd on this message board and I am a firm believer in both Visa & Mastercard long term growth prospects. I know there have been several other players in the payments space, yet, most rely on the infastructure and piggy back on MA & V network backbone. The barrier to entry is enormous, thus, no company has been able to penetrate what V & MA have created in terms of a worldwide processing network, which required billions of dollars of several decades. I have learned in my 12 years of owning both V & MA that they are a buy and hold on any dip in share price. Here are some things to ponder.1. 80% of the world still uses cash for transactions 2. Online Shopping is growing at an exponential rate.3. MA & V are just getting started, based on the #1 & #24. Both companies are shareholder freindly, buying back billions of dollars of shares on an annual basis. MA had 1.4 million a few years ago (afer a 10:1 slit) now share count id down significantly, which increases share price and EPS.5. If you look at historical figures going back over 30nyears, regardless of what the economy was performing on a yearly basis, MA & V always made a profit and grew eps. Even during the great recession (08/09) and Covid (20/21) both companies reported a profit and earnings growth. 6. MA and V have spent the last year consolidating (look at the one year graph), a huge basis was formed. Now that the economy is slowly recovering, fund managers and institutions have been buying back into both companies. Remeber 90% of share volume is by institutions, not retail investors. These institutions know, that once the economy is running on all 8 cylinders, Ma & V EPS will be exploding higher. This is why they have been buying shares and driving the share price up much higher, almost on a daily basis. 7. The more hotels rooms booker (airbnb) the better MA does, The more Apple phones are sold, the better MA does (most poeple pay with a credit card for a $1000 phone). The better Amazon does in online sales, the better MA does, the more houses sold (people buying furniture) the better MA does, the list goes on and on and on......etc......MA increase in value approx. 30-40% on yearly basis. Give or take a few points.Hold on to your shares and you will rewarded in the future.Peace & Cash to the Masses"
Is MA stronger than V? Seems to be lately.

let's hold 311 eod and we will fly. contactless payment is the trend !!!!
Buy Mastercard 
Should be by now 290.00 easy I don’t know what’s holding it back. It needs to get there today
Since when did MA become a wild roller-coaster?
Anyone thinking MA will split again? Last time was in 2014 when it hit $330 or so...maybe it follows Apple with a 4:1 split at $400? Thoughts??
good to be back in.
Haha Peter. Now what to you think?? Am I right again??
The last 5 minutes of today's trading action was pure #$%$! Up $2.50 this morning and down $4.68 at close on new that Apple has a credit card.
"I still don't understand why Mastercard and Visa are seen as ""Travel Stocks."" I never travel but use my credit cards all the time for everything."
"Mastercard reports earnings before the bell tomorrow (Oct. 29). Mastercard will blow away earnings, as did Visa and Paypal. Mastercard, as you are aware, is growing it's earnings and transactions at a faster pace than Visa, on a percentage basis. If you have not bought Mastercard shares, don't wait till the parade passes you by. Stellar earnings tomorrow along with positive market sentiment as of lately will propel Mastercard well over $290 per share......Mastercard will open up tomorrow around $278 per/share...and keep running."
V broke to the upside — MA should not be too far behind — from today’s mid-trading session to the closing bell (((  )))!
I'm ready to get back into MasterCard. Buying the Dip . What's a good buy-in?
China news alone should propel MA into orbit. Anticipating fantastic gains going forward. IMHO. :))
"Wallstreet has been on a low P/E kick for the last 3 months. Give them time, eventually they'll come back to the stalwart earners, they always do."
Just bought 500 shares
lts a set up! Follow the bouncing ball......
"Looks like it’s going to start the break and start heading over 300 by the EOD. I spent over 3,000 in my MC this holidays. I know this is going pass the 330.00 mark soon"
MA will emerge to lead an be a big winner in the global economic rebound!*** These inflection type pullback in the stock are mere buying opportunities for the prudent and forward looking investors!
This thing's going ballistic!
One of the best stock ...on sale now !!
Just set a new 52 week high!!
Why did it do so poorly today?
Buy Mastercard! 
buy the dip
The final hour before closing bell  belongs to MA & V!
Shorts are moving!
325 coming
"If I had to go back 13 years and had to chose 1 stock to buy and hold for the rest of my life, MA would be the one."
This stock has really been weak of late. Looks to be breaking down.Meanwhile DFS goes up lol
come on yahoo quit deleting
Come Monday next week...this will be between $270 to $275 as long as the market is not too shabby
"what a waste of energy from the majority here ,all the best for making a dollar"
"Solid long-term hold, but it's pretty much bearish for months ahead. It's struggling even to be around 300."
anyone know why the stock market is crashing? is Trump something to do with it?
"I love this stock - I've been in since 2007 or so and it's the biggest home run I'll ever hit. And I'm not going anywhere - holding for another 20 years unless the story changes. Pullbacks / recessions across the market are just an opportunity to add to my position.With that said, this feels really overbought. PE, PEG, most other multiples are much higher than they have been historically here. It will be interesting to see what happens after earnings - we'll need to see some monster growth to justify these prices in the short term.Like I said, long term, this is still my jam."
"Forget the crypto news, MasterCard send takes out PayPal?"
More pain and losses are coming. This clown has 3 years left to continue destroying our country.
Please get rid and block junk posts
what's wrong with MA?
"Visa released earnings and so can now resume repurchasing stock, would think they begin here at these levels should help us until next week"
Strong Sell. Profit taking today and continue tomorrow!
Is now a good time to jump in on MA?
Anyone who think this is the bottom has lost their minds this whole ordeal is just starting tighten your boot straps it’s going to get bumpy. Don’t get mad or @ me.
MA & V — the dynamic duopoly — are getting rousing votes of confidence as travel recovers and fears recede that they could be threatened by new technologies.*** Look for MA & V to lead a roaring global Economy back from the shackles imposed by the Pandemic!Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone
Never lose money. Do not fight the fed. Never doubt MA/V.
Lots of people are asking why the fall but no-one seems to know. Is there anyone who does?!
"Low volume profit-taking in MA & V in the very early trading session should give way to bargain hunting later!*** The protracted basing period in MA & V gave rise to yesterday’s solid breakout move, and there is much more follow through and legs to yesterday’s bounce from the dynamic’s duo extensive basing period."

On to $300 Amigos
what happened to my commentt where i mentioned MA is a manipulated stock...anybody????
Any clue as to why we're down today?
Buy the dips
These are the best times to add on these “inflection-type” pullbacks in the MA / V dynamic duo!- Simply ignore the “noisemakers and trash talkers” on the town-square and be rewarded with huge gains for having the conviction to embrace a selective contrarian investing attitude with the great global businesses of our time.
MA is bouncing!!! Big comeback for MA!!!
have you seen this technical analysis on ma stock http://prwire.press/2019/01/06/mastercard-ma-technical-analysis/

"I told you so. The big boys just laugh all the way to the bank. I already told you that MA is not Chinese internet stock, down 9 points in one day, that will happen when CEO of MA passes away, or gets legal problem."
This is bogus. Should be up $10.
Earnings pre market Friday????
Visa numbers bode well for MA. Should be a blowout number manana
Ridic overreaction whole market is gargage
Sad it can't break thru when everything else is on fire.
Love this stock in my portfolio...it has most of my confidence for a 20 year outlook ...never touching this one

Feeling good about my add at 259 yesterday. Let's see if it holds.
Downgrade today from Oppenheimer.
cut my lose @10% and doesn't see any end of bear market in sight.
I'll wait f or the dip before I buy.
"the dummies that are copy pasting their propaganda to protect your short positions are going to lose it all, we have months of healthy market trading left"
MA is still up maybe 10% for the year most of everything is in negative territory
MasterCard & Visa Will be big winners when Covid-19 is the past. No doubts. Buy now because people are scared about the future. It’s pretty cheap. You can buy Heineken with 54 multiple or Ma with 54. MA is better but we will drink. Thank you all and have a nice day
short sellers at work on this one
"Regarding Kroger vs. Visa, I thought V and MA charged the same amount for transaction fees. I guess this is not the case (anyone know?) Also, do V and MA negotiate transaction fees depending on size of vendor, e.g. Amazon might have negotiated a great deal with V and MA relative to Mom and Pop (smaller vendors). Anyone know? thanks"

"from the bbc...Bank notes 'may spread virus'British and US currencyPA MediaCopyright: PA MediaThe World Health Organization has warned that banknotes may be spreading coronavirus.A spokesman has advised consumers to use contactless payments to minimise any risks.“We know that money changes hands frequently and can pick up all sorts of bacteria and viruses,” a WHO spokesman said.“We would advise people to wash their hands after handling banknotes, and avoid touching their face.”Last month banks in China and Korea began disinfecting and isolating used banknotes as part of efforts to stem the spread of the deadly virus.However, a Bank of England spokesman told the Telegraph it had no plans to follow suit, adding ""the risk posed by handling a polymer note is no greater than touching any other common surface, such as handrails, doorknobs or credit cards”.It is not known how long the virus can survive outside the body, but experts believe the odds of contracting the virus via inanimate objects are low.Article share toolsShareView more share optionsShare this postCopy this linkhttps://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-51734185?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5e5f865f4958db067adf0b21%26Bank%20notes%20%27may%20spread%20virus%27%262020-03-04T10%3A46%3A28.551Z&ns_fee=0&pinned_post_locator=urn:asset:ff1d6cd1-f7a2-4e5a-879a-bf554759f5b1&pinned_post_asset_id=5e5f865f4958db067adf0b21&pinned_post_type=shareRead more about these links."
199...three trading days ago at 214 and change....buy buy buy.
unreal. my timing is just unbelievable. lose lose lose.
Huge spike up on 6/3/2019. Looks very bullish.
"I am long Mastercard and VISA, but what we are seeing here is disconnected from reality. It is simply FOMO, nothing more. I am not buying it for now."
Which is a better bet MA or V ? can hold for 8 10 years ?
Mastercard is a monster company. Stand behind while it continually beats expectations.
Down again.
"Long MA, V. Anyone know why MA up 1.85% today, V only up 0.32%? Plz share if you know of specific news item affecting one and not the other, or have theory or opinion. Thanks."
Today’s Barron’s has a lead story on MVP. MasterCard Visa and PayPal. The last 3 years the total return of MasterCard is 168% and Visa is 114%. PayPal is 189%. If you own Visa you need to switch to MA ASAP. You cannot afford to lose out on 54% returns every three years. IMHO
MA is reporting earnings before the market opens tomorrow. I expect phenomenal sales and earnings results. This is the last opportunity to acquire shares below $ 181. I expect that MA will reach $ 184 before 10:30 AM tomorrow.
Did you all note that it's down (thank you FB) on almost no volume but with any volume MA is up. If earnings are good in the am then this after market garbage will be erased quickly as long as FB doesn't create a fire sale market wide. Thoughts?
"Going to keep dipping.. Only Tuesday, Wait, and just nibble..... GLT"
"Earning report is due on the 27th, any predictions?"
MA is down 4.99% to $187.63
On fire again. Vamos!
Mastercard is down 5.29% to 300.33
MA reached an all time high at 292.40
All in at $225
V ricks in the AH with awesome earnings beat!!!
Lots of the 1.3 trillion will flow through MA and V through the remaining holiday period and deep into the first Qtr!
"This was a set up, as some big manipulators had bought PUT options, and they could have lose all if it goes up. By putting the price going down, they made money, and then it will go up/down....no problem to those suckers."
No stock split
Now it’s going down a bit more than it should be
PYPL is flying
"The idiot below, screaming at us, with a deranged mind (no doubt a liberal, leftist) is evidence enough for theWazoo Finance fascists to eliminate all conversations. A sad day for America."

if the stock goes up tomorrow .... sell.... buy back late Friday or monday.... look at the history of the last 2 yrs. on this announcement day.
How high it can go today? Any prediction
MasterCard is the poor mans Visa
"V starts to pull away from MA, let's see how MA will close the gap by the close today."
No doubt $MA is a great company and good bet long term .... it’s now trading at 60 x earnings which makes $V look like even better in my opinion. If Visa was trading at 60 x earnings it would imply a share price of $290 ... I probably wouldn’t advise to selling either $MA or $V but if I had to pick one to add to I think the choice is easily $V
All time high for MA. AmEx great ER and strong guidance bodes well for MA.
What just happen last half hour?
Only the 2nd time I’ve seen MA drop this much. In one day.
It's obviously not done selling. Stop wetting your pants every time you see a little green! You have gotten to used to the bull market! Things have changed right now. If the market is down to 2016 levels it can very well take another 3-4 years to get back to where it was. Once this market calms over the Coronavirus and numbers start to stall or few new cases if any. Then I would start to watch for an entry point once businesses start getting back to speed.
What the heck is happening today with MA....all I see is that the EU is slapping a huge $560m fine on MA. Is this the cause of the drop in last 2 days. Little volume so far today so hopefully this gets resolved and rebounds.
Do we know why it is not moving
"When stimulus checks are released, MA will be benefiting more than VISA."
"MA IS IN CORRECTION NOW. 293 TO 261, MORE THAN 10% DROP"
think this crosses $200 by end of week as earnings approach.
Strong Sell everybody! I places limit buy order. Good luck.
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mastercard-results-idUSKBN17Y1BQ
MA is up 5.92% to 249.60
big boys are probably selling to drive it down further so it will be a bigger pop after earnings
"pretty foolish to short one of the stocks at the center of a paradigm shift. Whether it's EV, ecommerce or online payments, the world is digitalizing. It's proven paper money is one of the biggest contributors you spread disease like covid. There may be people out there who don't believe the effects of covid but the majority is willing to adapt to contactless means of payment. I live in a major city (Vancouver) and most people, if not all, opt in for contactless payments. This practice will be brought forward into a post-pandemic era. It comes pretty close to reinventing the wheel.$PYPL $V $MA"
Here we go 315.00
"Amazon wanting to get into the payment business, should make every holder of MA BOYCOTT AMAZON. DON'T GIVE AMAZON ANY OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY"
Both Visa and MA are highly over valued.Their revenue isn’t increasing and debt is also high. Both these stocks need to fall 50% to become attractive again
same result. Selloff at the close.
Everything will recover but the wait hurts. That's the only problem with looking at your stocks everyday if your a long hold.
"Yes...payment I.e. digital processing is the future. I own V, MA, PayPal and have added SE, Stoneco, Meli, FB and WIX all really payment companies."
wow down over $5 today. Anyone adding?
$90 stock. will be there in a week.
V has broken out into serious green — MA shouldn’t be far behind into the closing bell ((( )))!
"Market is de-risking, it has happened to cloud stock now to financials. All the companies with high P/E are being sold off to a more reasonable P/E. MA’s P/E of 40 is ridiculous, Apple’s P/E is only 20, MSFT only 26, Google 25. MA’s P/E will drop to 30 which represents a 25% reduction in current share price and trending down to $200."
MA already $119.04 pre-market before earnings...... the earnings must be very very good and somebody knows?
V beats. Now the question is...................how will the market react? It's up $2 in the AH.........we'll see what happens tomorrow.
Nice add in the $250’s
Why MA down so much?

MA trying to figure out which direction it wants to go. I've still got the puts. Holding for now...I'm slightly down.
"MA will be fine. "" Never stand in front of an on coming train!"""
Once FX comes back IMO...revenues will double the 2019 number as so much has gone digital. Same for Visa.

Can someone explain the fundamentals why the credit card companies like MA and V are doing well in this market? Won’t falling interest rates reduce profits? Is it because of Apple’s new card? Any insight appreciated
We’re up 45% YTD and we just had a stellar ER beating on all fronts. We should be rejoicing our good fortunate. Have a little patience and enjoy the relentless ride up.

"@Paula - Did you read the article you posted? ""President Donald Trump: Total Actual plus Budgeted = $5.683 trillion, almost as much in one term as Obama accumulated in two.""

Ma stock overvalued!!!!
"MA is making a relentless climb towards $400+!***It’s a thing of beauty, and appears to be on a pace to get there just before next week’s Qtr earnings report!"
Don’t own any but looking to buy. Only worry is if we enter a recession people will be spending less. Thought?
I think the Apple Card will be a big winner in China. 
stock is poised but needs a little help from mgt and earnings outlook. China needs to cooperate.
just bought 110 shares. took advantage of this drop. Ma will make new highs.
Here we go boys 395 EOD
it may test in the low-to-mid 240s but don't forget we have earnings and dividend opportunities coming up end of July ... will continue higher as the overall trend is suggested and supported. thank you.

Hi I think you should sell it if it goes high tomorrow or Friday. if you see a pull back then buy it again.
"There seem to be some large sell-off in volume toward the market close. It certainly presents good buying opportunity if MA goes below $320...to add more. However, is the large volume sell-off indicative that funds are selling?"
This stock is golden! Love it!
Is this a good entry point or do you guys think this jittery market will push this down a touch further? Off like $40 from its high
Interesting factsA) steady insider sale by MA Foundation and officers everyday with increasing volumes.B) 2019 Q4 earnings surprise was barely 4%. C) tech chart looks very weakSo both don't look very good as of now. Let's hope MA surprise us with good results.
Any reason why bank stocks did great As did American ExpressBut yetMaster card and visa lag?

"Mastercard Inc. MA will be acquiring a minority stake in Airtel Mobile Commerce BV (AMC BV), the subsidiary of Airtel Africa.*** Extremely positive vibes for MA to be entrenched in what will be — one of the strongest economic growth areas of the planet  over the next 2 decades!"
Fantastic day and closing near its high. On to $300!
180. Target buy price
All time high today?
The transmission of germs through the use of paper currency has prompted some countries Treasury Depts to literally burn their money. Hence Paypal shares have taken off and Visa and Mastercard are not far behind.
disappointing earnings
You can thank me for this. Sold out a month ago at 260. been waiting for the correction which didn't seem to be coming. Looked at the long term chart and it just keeps climbing. so I bought on the dip to 270 Friday. You're welcome.
Congress went home: zero stimulus progress $jpm $gs
oh how the mighty have fallen
Two upgrades yesterday and we are poised to drop under $330........nonsense.
The market is not crashing. Anybody who cannot take corrections in the market should not be investing in stocks. MA is a quality company and should be a core holding in any portfolio. Anyone looking for an entry point should just go ahead and take a partial position on the stock and add to that over time. Anyone predicting price on MA in the short term is blowing smoke.
Market up 800 points and MA is trading about flat or up a few points at best. Going to be a slow run back to the top I’m sure.
Dead money and a double top i n play
wat time is er?
Lets Go Trump you got my vote I’m a democrat but voting on Trump. Great speech my friend. ￼
Wow
wow might have to buy in soon for a big long term!!!!!!
I said a close of $390 minimum. This bad boy will take off big time within the months to come!!
Let’s see if Ma can hold the $360 level. Just can’t break out from here. I’m hoping it can!
Going all the way up to new 52 week highs!! 100%%% the time for payment stocks is now!! May the longs be with you
What’s up with MA drop?
Would love a 20% correction in this for a good entry point.
What’s with the 70+ point drop after hours???
Analysts expect 42% earnings growth in 3 years from $MA https://simplywall.st/NYSE:MA/mastercard
I would like to see a 3-1 split
Biden voters will regret their decision when he kills the market.
$310 huge resistance.
"276.22 at 3:50. Hammered to 275.02 by 4:00 then 274.95 at 4:01. Well done. Happens every single Friday. Puts and calls at strike, worthless."
This will trade just like V did after earnings. Nice beat but a pullback is necessary first.
What do we think of MA as we approach earnings?
I added a little more on this dip. $150 by years end!
Falls more buying more
Look at the one and 5 year charts! Strong buy!
"@GoodForAll - I warned you months ago to sell MA, but you refused to listen."
Keeps treAding down and down each day.
Caught this on Apple board... Want a barometer. How about MA Mastercard. They just guided lower for the year after the close. Down another $10 after hours. “
"Should see ATH by next week, if not earlier."
MA already fully loaded.
"It is very disappointed because MA did not drop that much as yesterday. The volume over 200,000 shares though. I can see ' BUY THE DIP "" this morning. I just hope TRUMP does not tweet any thing stupid again."
Going right to $265 to knock out option profits?
"I was buying options today thinking MA announced after the bell lolShocked stock isn't moving much, it was a pretty good report.I guess I will hold them until week's end."
MasterCard always outperforms Visa. It’s a given. Owned both and finally last year got wise and dumped all my Visa into MasterCard and never looked back.
190 PLUS TOMMOROW!!!!!!
MA: predicting MA will move to 282-285 next week
wow this company is bigger than boeing in terms of market cap.
What the heck is going on with MA right now? Will we see $350 today?
The market makers tame down the spike this morning. I saw some big pop today which I guess it is the reason why MA does not move higher.
"Tech sector recovers from Fat Kim first,so I think the market does not react abruptly like the first time last month. Data and GDP will come out this week, it will show the strength of US economy. AND IPHONE 8 IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS."
"everyone is freaking out. Just hold, history shows the market bounces back rapidly once a global catastrophic event is over. These are all great, rare buying opportunities - whether you buy now or wait for bigger dips - all is well if you don't let your emotions get involved"
"Long since 270 and loving it! Remember, it’s never too late! Payments is still gonna be big, and MA lies between tech and recovery and is a good play :)"
Should we be concerned about this drop?
"Why isn't Cuomo not calling Schumer to ask ""what the heck is he thinking, and to get his nose off of Pelosi's heels""?"
Why are we down today? Visa is strong up?
Pretty much clear sailing until next ER. Should take out the old high by then.
wait for the peak ..293 ++++ and then sell ...and sit out ...it will fall 20 - 40 dollars ...my study ...prove me wrong mastercard ...
"It’s so good that MA unloaded a boatload of “weak hands” before the Holiday Season, so; there’ll be little resistance for a positive Christmas rally with legs heading into the mew year!- As a MA long, I recall MA displayed similar weakness during pre- holiday Season trading!"
Break 280 and fly soon
Beautiful upgrades today
Set back relax and enjoy the ride to $300 by 1/1/2020
"MA decline triggered computer buy programs late in today’s trading session, and should carry on into the close.The below $340 dip was the trigger price for the computerize buy signal."
Beat earnings report not by much but still good!
Waiting for a good entry price!
The markets are rallying!
MA’s price target from yesterday’s upgrade is $370. so it has lots of room to run up from here!
totally manipulatedshort both arms
Shorting continue.
Disappointed in earnings reaction.
Cryptocurrency exchange LVL is opening pre-orders for a Mastercard debit card that's linked to bitcoin and fiat accounts.
"It looks like big boys want more shares of MA, suppressing stock early in the morning and back up the truck to load MA before the close, I observed it from last week. MA should hit high and break out right away because the condition of the market for short term support financial stocks."
"Cash remains the most frequent method of payment in the U.S., representing roughly 31 percent of consumer transactions, more than electronic, credit, debit or checks. So plenty of runway for growth as they say."
Is it ok?
Good time to buy some or buy some I believe. I just bought more to lower my cost basis per share. Great value at this price we are at today. Good luck all!
why down so much?
"Yeah stock going great guns. However, options not moving much"
Going to $300 a share tomorrow. May the longs be with you!!
Great comeback by the Rolls Royce of Fintech. :))
And again for 2 days in a row the market looks like it's gonna open up down several 100 points. This is nothing but a big joke. I would not touch this market with a 10' Pole.
it appears people are pulling out of PayPal and going in MasterCard
WHY ARE WE DOWN???
Buy MA now. This is the easiest 2.5% you'll ever make.
Lovely stuff
does this stock ever go down?
Looks like good upside!!
$250 next week
MA reached a new All Time High at 158.98
Mastercard is up 4.91% to 309.90
"There is still a lot of mileage remaining in MA & V to recapture most of their lost ground during the recent correction -- the dynamic duo both reported excellent earning reports yeterday!- Add on any weakness today, because these stocks should be bought -- with vaccinarions increasing across the U.S, and the world's strongest Markets is uber-bullish forMA & V!"
I guess well have to hold on until the storm settles...
Bad retail numbers mean bad news for Mastercard. Sell.

Citi and JPMORGAN saw an increase in credit card activity 
Bought shares today. The coin shortage is really starting to hit hard. This decade will see the permanent shift away from cash...
Getting close to buying another 500 shares. Long term we go!!
Looking for a fast double my money from here! Who's with me!
Fantastic day closing at its high and bouncing $5 off the low for the Rolls Royce of FinTech. Very Bullish!

All time high for the Rolls Royce of FinTech. A must own for any serious balanced portfolio. IMHO. :))
"MA share price has grown an average of 5.49 times per year since 2006. 2020 revenue percentage change +12.9%. Profits percentage change +38.6%. Assets $29,236 M. Employees 18,000. Let these guys run the country!"
Down $6.. why?
MA will reach $ 216.00 by today's close!!!
MA & V are perhaps the top beneficiaries of today’s report of a huge spike in retail sales!
$350 will come 100%. Could possibly come today. Long term great but wait to buy
MA Upgrade: Jefferies upgtades MA from hold to Buy -- Adjusrs price target upward to $415 from $315!!!
"I've never seen a board with so many crybabies. Sell what you got ,buy more, hold until it bounces back or short it ...just quit whining."
No upward momentum. We keep getting upgrades but investors aren't buying in.
Mastercard is up 10.61% to 346.92
I’m bullish of MA but I think it’s gone up a little too much too fast do we shall see.
sold half of my shares. why. its a secret.
Selloff at the end
MA needed a good day and that’s exactly what they got! Hoping next week this really breaks out and gets towards the 52 week high! What do you all think?
You have to use this gift of a pullback as a buying opportunity. I know I am. This is the Rolls Royce stock of Fintech and opportunities like this don’t present themselves that often. MA is hitting in all cylinders with a huge runway in front of them. IMHO
Rocketing to the moon. If you buy here you won't be sorry. Reopening is going to propel MA and V to the moon. I full expect $400+ for MA by the midpoint of this year. Long and strong.
"Cash continues to go by the wayside. Mastercard (NYSE:MA) stands out as one of the best stocks to profit from this trend.The company, along with Visa, enjoys a duopoly in processing credit card payments. This gives Mastercard a strong revenue stream. It also gives the company a formidable moat. Those are two attributes that make for great long-term buy-and-hold stocks."
There we go MA. That’s what I’m talking about. Vamos!
"Both MA and V touched 52 week high today, seems to be strong resistance at MA ($257.75) and V ($165.75), if not for all the headwinds globally both would have broken out to settle closer to analysts estimates or $10 higher. Question is with summer approaching do we see the break through or a drop down under 50 day? Comments welcome, or Thumb Up for new high....Thumb Down for lower to 50 day."
I think we go $400 plus by end of March. Hopefully travel starts picking up and then there’s no limit to MA success.
You haven't seen anything yet!It's coming......
MA will rocket after earnings.
This is kind of strange.. very rarely do I see a stock knock it out the park rally for a huge gain and give basically ALL of it back.. usually the day traders will knock off maybe a few dollars but this thing pop over 6 and giving back almost all 6 of it.. weird..
thjsi stock is a fooken joke
HOW LOW WILL IT GO?
Some MLB teams announcing all stadium transactions will be cashless. More revenue coming in.
Premarket today shows 340
Will finish in the red
"MasterCard giveth, and MasterCard taketh away.....it's just so hard to maintain positive momentum. Too many people day trading this stock. Push it up, knock it down...that's the pattern."
"Where will MA be tomorrow when we wake up after the earnings report prior to market open. I am looking for $275 at open, and an eventual move to $300 over the next week. Opinions?"
"this is a great investment and will continue its rally higher soon. get in before it’s to late, unless you’re a short get back in the basement"
Year over year comps for V & MA should show increasing and awesome growth in the range of 9 to over 20 percent — as the U.S. and global economy gradually opens up throughout the remainder of FY-2021 thru 2022.*** The March to pre-pandemic revenue and profits level is inexorable!
It’s time to buy the dip in MA for awesome gains in 2021!
Master card or Visa?
Looks like coronavirus helping Visa and MasterCard. More people shopping from home.
"what's the deal with all these ""market correction imminent"" posts? the same post is all over fintech"
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=5pIMD1enwd4
"MA is looking like its ready to explode to the upside !!!!!!!!!!!!Should be a very interesting morning.If we get better than anticipated numbers,upside should be 4 to 8 dollars......on its way to 200."
Why do retail investors always buy at the top?
better to buy in eur or usd? does it even matter? :D
"MA has been spectacular stock....iipo'd @ $40....soared to $800....split 10 for 1.....now about $217. an initial investment of $2,000 is now worth over $100,000"
Lets go MA 290 tomorrow
$MA Target Raised by Truist Securities USD 415 » USD 450
Down on heavy volume.
"MA’s 10% raise in its dividend is a nice “holiday gift” to shareholders!- It’s expected resumption to rapid growth in the post COVID-19 environment, makes this stock, one of the top and very few business that truly exhibit: authentic growth and income!"
Hmmm odd this one is down this much. I wanted to add at $245 and may get my chance now.
MA will move at least $10 tomorrow and maybe even see $290. I am excited t wake up and watch MA finally move over $300 in a slow and steady manner. Holiday season will be a huge consumer boom and MA and V will find new support at $300 and $190 respectively.
"Getting back into the ""buy"" zone. As in I will be able to afford it soon....."
All of the payment stocks are green!
target $450 raised today!
"@Ulrich - Maybe, maybe not. MasterCard is one of the best companies in the world, but it is also extremely overvalued. This weakness could simply be a rotation out of overvalued stocks into undervalued stocks."
Based on a discounted cash flow $MA is reasonably priced right now https://simplywall.st/NYSE:MA/mastercard
Testing new lows again soon if the infection and mortality rates don't go down!
Going nowhere but down in rising markets after great earnings. Why???
Stay with the best of the bast global businesses and that’s MA & V!!!
"MA and V both have very impressive margins. Here's MAs: 100% gross margins, obviously due to zero COGS, EBITDA margin 63.95 percent, operating margin 53.15 percent, free cash flow margin 48.2 percent. So this company is a profit machine. Go home bears."
500Coming
Never in doubt baby. That card is swiped all day.
Millions will loose their jobs in the next few weeks. This is far from over.
294.50 support on it’s way back over 300
"It looks like MA is going to be next in China and join AXP. What is V doing, not even close?...."
"MA has crossed over into oversold, and is currently trading at favorable discount leading into next week’s Qtr Earnings report!"
Does this stock ever go up?/sAdded a bit to my position here. Will continue to do so if it goes down further.
"I got in @ 149 right in the morning, could wait and get in lower but I'm happy anyway"
"Love this stock, wish i owned more shares!"
"Damn wish I didn’t buy last week lol. This thing may be headers much lower, Good thing this is a long term hold!"
I use my card every day and that has not changed because of virus issues.
"1st quarter figures will be out around the 25th. Since the world has shut down. I would guess 40% reduction in transactions. Not good, stock will free fall."
Not now. Huge pullback
Waiting for $265
Will open high and experience pull back down to a loss today
MA upgrade initiated by Seaport Global Securities at buy with $370 price target.
Nice little 1 1/2 percent gain so far here today. I'll take it! Beginning the climb back up to $360 plus I hope. Good luck all!
I lile this stock. +400$ here we come!
Green at closing again? Hope so...
Add 38 shares to round up.
no pop
What's going on? I haven't seen this drop 10$ in one day in ages.
New 52 week high. Nice!
Why is MA dropping?
Just me.I thought for sure this would be at 380
A Beat for MA predicted.... https://ca.yahoo.com/news/higher-digital-spending-aid-mastercard-131001069.html
"The folks on this board are sheep. Every time MA is up, they think it is going higher. Why? Simply because it's up. Only a fool takes cues from price action."
Really think it's a bad decision to sell this stock before holiday shopping. Held my shares for many years and will continue to do so. Credit company stocks will excel for the holidays.
"We have bottomed out, I hope."
Terrible market on many levels. Hold tight and don't sell.
Strong Buy under $300
"Name me a better, more consistent growth stock?"
"380 is top for next few months...take your profits now, and run with tech stocks...you will make a lot more profit"
Sell while you can! Going down to 150$ to match PE 20!!!
"MA beats EPS 0,12$"
Alright what gives? Getting worried here now.
what do all these new fintechs use? $MA $V networks
MA is down 4.93% to 283.36
Wake up guys
"So what’s going on here? Yesterday, they post great earnings, market up and MA drops. Today they are flying up. Really don’t get this —I had expected them to be up about 10 yesterday given their recent drop (for no good reason) from about 220."
"Added to my position at 144.29. No valid reason for this sell off, so may buy more if it goes down further."
"An investment of $10,000 at Ipo would be worth almost $700,000 plus over $100,000 in dividends and growing. That’s the kind of investment that builds giant amounts of wealth. Only been in the market for a little over year and this has been my best performer by far, hope it continues."
We got $300 and now we need to close above.
Looks like online shopping has made up for some of the travel loss. Go MA!
"Just added to my position, thank you whoever sold"
Ma overvalued.
about time people realized selling MA down to $185 was stupid. Now lets get back to the $200's and make new high by EOY. Holidays are here and consumers happy to spend.
It keeps tanking and tanking. What kind of stock moves up 4% on one day and then collapses the next day after?So many week hands who bought in yesterdays short squeeze.Should go down over 4% today given what we have seen already in the first hour of trading.
Damn. could have got in at $313.00. Got a feeling I can get back in lower before summer.
"The fact that I just got MA at under 200 is absouluty amazing. By the end of the year with good earnings this will be sitting back around 215-220, and a year after that? 250-260 would not surprise me. What a golden oppurtunity to buy."
"Is it time to buy? or ,wait for after peak of spread ?"
40 P/E with 11% growth. insane
"It’s been stuck in this range forever, come over to $SQ"
"I Just read something about AMZN and payment system and am trying to understand better , so forgive my ignorance right now. To preface my question. let me say MA will go up and hit $290 based on this ER and overall strength of the economy, see my prior posts. Your opinion please on following question:""Does the announcement yesterday from AMZN about their emphasis on payments using Alexa and partnering with others companies to execute?""....it seems anytime AMZN sticks their nose in an industry it hurts the staples of that segment in response."
Bought more recently. $335 by the end of the year 2020
"MC need to announce something in crypto currency space, watch it go to 5K in no time"
Strong Sell. Pullback coming.
What I need is for this to do the same trick it did last December.
forever stock
"Briefly hit $400 early today most likely riding the Visa results to that new high, then dropped back down. With MA results tomorrow coming in, should get back and stay over $400."
ma is going to $200 by next week.
What a gift! These people print money...are you serious?
"What is the main important in business .. WIN .. this information won't affect this stock ! NTWKWatch fundamentals, earnings, Capitalization marketwatch all data, prospects, sales since 2014.Now it is the bottom chart ! $ 5 soon $ 9.95 ... Decade $ 1500 ! Comme in with the next winner.Time to joint the new mi$$$$$$cro$$$$$$soft software in the world, good luck an be happy, very happy"
V reports in AH today!- I added to my MA position and am now completing my additions on the other half of the dynamic duo before the close!- What a Bonanza to have caught these stocks at HUGE discounts!
"Market is too volatile and the Fed input were not that great yesterday, book profits and sit sideline."
Board gets very quiet on down days
Buy the opening dip on very small volume!
Nice move
How does this drop $10 in a day?
Hit pre-pandemic levels and Europe hasn't even opened up yet!
It fell because of Visa —being investigated by DOJ. Probably it was part of an ETF
"Ok, $155 by friday! Lol"
"I'll take a half percent gain everyday for the next 10 years. Kind of like I got with $ma for the last year. Slow, steady and strong brings the type of profits you can bank at leisure. Much better than trying to time flimsy growth spurts."
MasterCard overbought?
Final assault on $300 now underway. And sooner rather than later. Love this stock. Must own.
MA reached an all time high at 319.63
Everyone still bullish on this lol. PE ratio still awful. I sold at 300 a while ago and don’t plan to buy in until it goes to 200 .. yes 200 is happening with a recession on our hands
Horrible performance zero bids looks like 300 next
Visa is better choice for now.
Earnings are going to be a miss. First reported.
All this talk about bitcoin and it gets killed today. Look at the stead MA just do it’s work!! This is the play to be in! MA and V forever!!
MA will exceed expectations
Future proof!
"This is just a minor bump in the road. Don't sweat it, afterall this is Mastercard."
Caught the drip perfect. 241.14 and loaded up again. MC and V are the best I have ever owned.
About time it corrected. Long over due. Great stock and a life time hold but it has been up so much.
Buy & Hold Free Money
this is absolutely ridiculous!
It’s time to buy this MA dip because tomorrow might be too late for this awesome business that will rule — along with V in the post pandemic world!
"@Nope:How does your comment relate to MA & V’s “awesome fundamentals “?*** Is MA in the business of manufacturing plastic?- It appears that you need to get your “wokeness” together, bra’ — to dispel more than a few misconceptions!"
"This crazy stock has gone up 30% since I bought it. Questions: should I take short-term cap gains on it, or hold it? Will this collapse during market correction? Small dividend doesn't invite a long hold if it's not going to continue to rise, but it sure has done well the past few months!"
Overvalued
Where are earnings?
Overreaction. Their revenue was still 3.8 Billion Dollars for the quarter!
Former vp of $ma and $sq are part of $ftocNow! Fintech 10x here
Here comes $ 209!!!
Some big short somewhere is losing his BEHIND and posting everywhere!!! LOL!
"Oversold. Great buy here! Future looks bright. With vaccine coming out and increased travel, this will go up."
Why did Mastercard suffer more than Visa in the recent dip?
purchased at $78keep on going
Unsustainable
Anyone have a reading on what all these new players jumping into FinTech will ultimately mean for companies like MA and V?
does this market rally keep going?
kicked my self for not buying last week in the 260s. Now's time to buy back in
Like I mentioned in another post. People are still using credit cards. No doubt. People have credit card problems and always will especially in times of need liek now. When you don't have a savings you will always turn to the plastic.
High volume and down huge. Tomorrow another big down day.
MA reached an all time high at 239.50
"don't be afraid of MA - spent 89,000 in 2010, up 1,662,% today! Avg. cost $22.58 per share!%"
good earning from Amex should bode well for MA
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MA & VISA?????
I’ve been really disappointed in MA and V. Both have been stuck in mud for a while now. These two stocks should be way up for the year?
Buy at $225 by EOW
Reason for pop in MA & V is they are raising their transaction fees for merchants shortly..
Did I not say 400 by summer 
Could we get a little sunshine in here ?
"MA & V never stay down for long!- Today was a great chance to load up all the way to the closing bell !!!*** Look out for the rebound as early as Monday!- The U. S. Economy is totally primed to take off, and “the dynamic duo” will be leading the cavalry!- What an awesome opportunity to buy these great businesses at fabulous discount prices!— Today was a MA & V Bonanza!!! "
"RBI bars Amex, Diners Club from adding new customersMumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Friday restricted global card networks American Express Banking Corp. and Diners Club International Ltd from onboarding new customers, citing non-compliance of local payment data storage norms. “This order will not impact existing customers,"" the regulator said.*** Advantage to MA & V!"
"6.6 million more people loose their jobs this week. CarMax closed 40 stores 15,000 laid off. Market goes up? Like a puppet on a string."
Lol here we go again
Haha it’s still well overpriced with current economy. Will test the low 300s and even 290s. Wait to buy 100%
A buy here
just turned negative.....lost all days gain. Why?
"$151.49 to under $149 now. LOL. Wall St Crooks. Meanwhile they keep running up FB, APPL, BABA. Got to love it lol. SMH"
"Next stop, $350. All aboooooard!"
Wow the 200$ support just broke!!!! 
RBC up grade of MA: to $412 from $350: “based on travel / projected consumer spending — maintains outperform rating”.
$MA Target Raised by Deutsche Bank Buy USD 383 » USD 420
Incredible comeback today by the Rolls Royce of Fintech. Any glimpse of a pullback and the buyers come storming in. Fantastic stock to own that just keeps getting stronger. Enjoy! :))
Looks like strong support at 274. Hope it holds.
$PAGS suffering just like many other payment stocks. out of favor at the moment with the big guys. look at $V and $MA. two giants with unquestionable solid fundamentals and both basically flat in the last 3 months. market rotation at its bestI will continue to buy this dip
g ping higher
Hi I think it's goes $200.
"PE Ratio of MA is till very high. For those so sure we're going to 400 soon, beware."
It is back to the value from end of July. Awesome.
What's happening to MA after-hours? It's down 2.04% as of 3:17 p.m.?
We need a bit of a breather as does the entire market. Stocks are way over bought. MA will head back to $265-266 and then head to new highs again.
Looking for another buying opportunity soon. My guess is $138
V and MA are the best stocks to own for reliable long term gains.
This should be up 2-3%!
Kind of thankful for this virus it really shows what companies prepare for things like this and what companies don’t. $BA $WMT $MA $JPM $GM $TSLA. Quite laughable how these company’s don’t have security nets for pandemics and international emergencies you would think they would have some way of maintaining a stable sell to buy rate.
Buy and forget it safe invest
Huge impact with slowing economy will be oversee for MasterCard
any news went up 2.75 after hours
Huge buying opportunity
"Mastercard keeps going higher and higher every day. The 6 billion share buyback program is in full swing. I feel sorry for anyone who has not bought Mastercard shares. Sitting on th sidelines while watching Mastercard rocket upwards must be very, very difficult for those who do not own any shares.The train has officially left the $360 station, sit back and relax and enjoy a martini. Next stop is $370""All Aboard"""
SANTA RALLY!!!
Guy adami from CNBC said to sell MA!
I'm just looking at the dividend payout for Mastercard. To me it's not that appealing. What do you think?
down 3% on good news
https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ma/forecastSTRONG BUY
Stock is in breakout mode as predicted on here 9 days ago.
"In the interest of truth in advertising ,Mastercard and Visa should label their products 'debt cards'."
this stock is no good...people are excited at 277...we bought at 293 seeing the target at 310....?????
I keep reminding myself that I always sell puts on stocks im not afraid to own. I definitely will be owning some MasterCard come Friday. I just don’t like being in the hole as much as I’m gonna be. That’s ok it’s like real estate when you buy a house you always think man I overpaid and a few years later your sitting on tons of equity
More lockdowns and business closures = eroding economy and MA share price. Buyer at 280.
"That volume at 195 was huge, big buyers stepped in"
It seems $390 is being a stubborn level. Break it now! So we can get a run over $400 next week going into ER.
Not a good sign that every time we rise the sellers come in immediately.
Still waiting for $300? Enjoy time when you can buy below $300. Don’t rush to fast.
MA finishing of a power rebound day!!!
MA & V are both on sale in the teeth of this mostly “digital shopping” holiday season — where the dynamic duo will be the primary beneficiaries — because cash is nonexistent in online shopping!
It needs to get back to $800
SQ: $130 EOY!
Oooof. Look at this sell off after this dumpster fire of a rally
"For how long will the US Government continue to PUMP the US Stock Prices artificially? Everyone knows that the US Market is in the MEGA BUBBLE; it is even more overvalued than Tulip Mania Bubble! The US Stocks are INSANELY OVERVALUED and OVERBOUGHT! The Valuations are impossible to justify!For how long can the US Government run this fraudulent Stock BUBBLE, while Corporate revenues are tanking, Corporate and National Debt is Astronomical, the Valuations are beyond insanity, Political polarization is at max, there are ongoing and upcoming wars, the real resources are limited, Economy is Collapsing, Competition is intense, the Stock Dilutions are at record highs, everything is getting worse, China, Russia, and many other countries are set to ditch the US Dollar as an international reserve currency. Now there are 100,000s of companies worldwide competing for $1 revenue! The US Companies that barely generate revenue of $1-2 million are trading at $50-60 Billion Market values, while in Asia, the same companies with better fundamentals, 100 times more revenues, are trading at 99% less market value! The US Company valuations DO NOT MAKE Sense at all! Why would one invest in US Stock Tulip Mania while he/she can buy the 1000 times better company share for a 99% cheaper price? The US Stock Market is a MAJOR PONZI SCHEME designed to patch fraudulent pension systems in the US temporarily! There is NO PROPER Revenue Collection by the IRS since 2016. Taxes are extremely Low, and Nobody is paying custom duties! People want more free money without working, more free checks, more capital gains, more stock hypes every day! This fraudulent ""no need to work"" policy of the US Government will END TERRIBLY very soon!

"There's word on the street that a large group of consumer debtors may just stop paying their credit card bills for two or three months. How do you think this will impact MA and other financial institutions? I heard this was going to take place in the past, but it never materialized. I would appreciate any thoughts...."
Holding long! $PYPL $MA $FINX $V. LETS GO!!!
Is there any news on the DoJ investigation today? It's really bouncing.
Can someone explain why there is such strong selling going on? Is it the trade war fear?
There she goes. Going below $300 today
A small cap pays. Also good
I don't get it.MA is much better than VMA should be 350 by now.So insane an manipulative
"Tomorrow will hit $200 again, I will buy more"
"Don't let the profit-taking today bother you. What a great report ... the long term trend is all UP. Put your shares away, and forget about them."
"So here is the deal.........next week is a game changer week and the beginning of the rebound. Here is why my belief is bolstered that we are at the bottom and near the end of this crisis;1) next week we will have more testing which will increase the count BUT will significantly lower the death rate2) next week is the second week of the 15 day self quarantine, this will get lifted in many areas3) the congress will have passed immense spending/relief bills to help people and businesses4) money from MM's will begin to funnel back to stocks from their heavy cash positions5) other countries like France, Spain will start to use the new drugs and will show great improvements on virus6) Trump will push the drugs that are showing promise, these are proven drugs already in use for other issues7) announcements will be made on back to normal schedule8) Trump wants to be proven Right on this hopeful cureThen we get back to pre-virus levels. Good Luck!"
"JP Morgan credit card sales up 13 pct, bodes well for MA"
with unemployment down... wages up... the young folks are better educated...and Mom and Pop has always give them the best... SO CREDIT CARD USE WILL SOAR! Spend that money ... people.... spend that money!!!!!
"Thinking if the Republican s keep the Senate, the markets will go ballistic."
MA IS EXTREMELY BULLISH TODAY!!! GO MA GO!!!
Not today $300. Price overvalued.
Do people realize how stupid they sound when they say “this stock is manipulated because it hasn’t gone up in a straight line with no blips and outpaced it’s earnings/revenue growth”??
lets all trust trump and our govt get ahead of this virus and eliminate this threat
What a finish! Tremendous pent up demand for MasterCard. Upwards and onwards amigos!
"MA: Dollar been strong , could translate to POOR earning number for MA"
going down to 269...sell sell sell...buy back at 269 tomorrow
"The GRIM REAPER is talking about ""our dark winter is still here"" ""worse before we get better"", ""vaccine plans are dismal failure"" and the usual ""empty chair at the kitchen table"".No mention about modeling successful States like Fla, So Dakota, Texas etc. Just open the businesses and economy, let people work, let them earn and they will spend. That is the only thing we need to do and stop trying to have government borrow its way out.If we open up, people will spend again and all lives will be lifted..........and MA and V will rocket."
Closing $269.25
$v and $ma have low dividend yields and have a lot more room to grow. These are great long term stocks that are hardly talked about
Profit taking.
Did MA announce any buyback in the Conference call ?
buy more now
Its tanking hard now. Failed breakout at the downtrend causes technical selling.
not a Trump fan but been waiting for this since 2012 when the Chinese promised the World Trade organization to let MA and V into China.
Up or down tomorrow?
"Mastercard: Growth Unimpeded, Stock Is a Buy According to ""The Street"" today!!! I expect $ 280 or higher by today's close!!! GO MA GO!!!"
record high tomorrow
by the end of the week 265 plus minimum. my honest opinion. based on technical research naturally and fundamentals...
"Anybody think we will hit a new all time high after earnings tomorrow? That is entirely possible, in my opinion."
Great Day MA! Well done!
"I am confused by the decrease in MA price today. This stock will reach $ 220 by December 31, 2018!!!"
Great opportunity to add on today’s volatility in anticipation of decreasing selling volume from profit taking —. with the requisite MA rally to new highs off these lows!
"BEFORE COVID-19 unemployment was at a all time low, but now it is roughly 30%. It appears it will take a long time for those laid off to find another job quickly. Look at Hertz just filing for Bankruptcy! The stock market was extremely valued before COVID-19 hit globally. Now the US stock Mkt is just back to pre Covid levels, meaning overvalued again."
"Very, VERY “paltry volume” in the early trading leading the decline in V & MA!***Play the rebound in these stocks of two of the greatest businesses of our time."
cross border volume still an ongoing problem
"Tons of flights cancelled. City's #$%$ down, staying in there houses... This will get worse. No credit card transactions. This has lower to go. I'm looking for a good entry."
Drop like a rock
Poised for a possible breakout. Should see some catalyst from earnings coming up
MA is very strong it's going shortly to 300+
When will we hit $400 and then $500?
"All time high coming compadres. A must own stock for any balanced and diversified portfolio. We don’t care what you buy, where you buy it or how much you pay. Just buy it and whip out that those interlocking circles. :))"
Due to political destabilization in the country expect pullback.
Today will be next good day for MA ! Keep growing !
Going back to 52 week levels. Thinking around $220ish. Economy is in terrible shape. Down down we go.
V flying right now
Simply irresistible. :)).
Any one know of a logical reason MA is dropping today? Does not make sense to me with all the good news coming out about economy
$380 tomorrow plus dividend reinvestment!! Let’s go MA. Time to run wild!!
Keeps going down.
Look at MA rally!!!
I'd like to thank the shorts for holdin out a little longer ; )
good buy
One of the few stocks in my portfolio that are green today. Growth investing is taking a kicking
Friday market will go down. Buying opportunity!
$2.15 v $2.01 EPS.
great well managed company. nowhere to go but up with this stock. good luck to all MA investors!
MA is rallying!!! It is bullish!!!
I am STRONGLY BELIEVE IN MASTER.

BUY BUY BUY !!!

Is the earning price already baked in?
"MA is one of the great global busineses on the Planet, and is at the forefront -- along with V -- of the trend towards cashless transactions!- Investors should remember to focus on the awesome ""business of MA"" for great gains!"
The comments really die here when we drop
Up over 4% today at 12:30 PM. Another good day for MA.
Why MA will close positive today?
Classic ...some profit taking and goes green soon after ...LOVE MA !
Smart investors are buying up MA 
Better than expected earnings. $315 by the end of this week!
It's just a better reason to move your manufacturing back to the U.S.
Are my 3/13 245p garbage?
where can we get more info on puts for master card..help
Short MA now?
I like visa better
MA and V are must owns for any growth portfolio. They will continue to deliver big capital returns over time. I own both stocks at cheap levels and am still not finished counting the profits.
"309... if it closes the month below that, LOOK OUT BELOW, very big drop is coming"
Down $2.50. What gives?
Buy MA and GH.... GH is going to double soon.
Sell at high price! If $300 is roof sell now.
"very low volume and down $6 from today's high of $282. I see no reason other thanMA guiding this holiday season number of 3.1% vs 5.1% from last year, as there are less days this holiday season. I would believe MA had this number in their ER guidance. Tempted to by more here but in this crazy market I'll wait a few more days if MA drops $270 or so."
Morgan Stanley raised its price target on Mastercard to $444
lorrie I did buy MA at the IPO and still own it today
SHORT SQUEEZE just starts to force the bears run. It is amazing to see MA moves like rocket today.
"So. If I sell at 281 and then buy back in at 270 or something like and keep doing it, I can increase my holdings by 20 or so each trade. Eventually I can accumulate more shares instead of just holding onto the ones I bought high. Week by week. good idea? or bad idea?"
"oh boy, this was like the perfect storm. market sell-off + missed results. I will load more. bring it!!!"
Super strong and perspective stock. Will jump to 500 in few years and 1000 USD from 5 to 10 years. Mark it.
MA needs to split the stock. Don't bother telling me it doesn't change the value. Splitting the stock helps an individual to buy 100 shares of a great company. Splitting 3 for 1 would be nice. 4 for 1 would be better. Not many can afford 30k for 100 shares.
MA is down 6.23% to 213.74
MA has averaged a 45% return the last three years. That pencils out to a double every 1.6 years which is incredible for the 10th largest company in the USA. Lot more to come in coming years too. Just getting started. IMHO
Winnie 9am
keep going more than $200 dollars
Why down more than visa
Short here. Coronavirus coming to US.
"Terrible trade on my part from last Thursday when I bought puts against MA. From now on....when I say go long, go short. If I say go short, go long. This way, you should definitely make some $$$ LOL!!"
"Market up, $MA down, market down, $MA more down"
Nice steady climb. Onwards and upwards
You guys are so funny. It just goes with the market tides. The rest is #$%$
looks like a bit of insider trading with that 6 pt move on one day last week.
Hey not to get off topic but is your last name Juliano
Seeing as it will never get above $350. I want it to go back to $200 like last March. So I can get in on the repeat cycle back to $320.00
MA is great stock. But it’s already fully loaded for 2019 year.
Looking good pre today!
Going to drop around $300
$280 is so close I can taste it. No stopping this freight train. THE Fintech to own :))
"I personally would take profits here. $MA is a great company, but it’s overbought. Just my opinion. Nothing goes up forever."
"""Most of the major BNPL services are primarily linked to debit cards so they are generally good for Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), not bad,"" Lisa Ellis, analyst at MoffettNathanson, told Investor's Business Daily. ""If BNPL really takes off in a large scale, it is primarily bad for the credit card issuers — particularly credit card issuers that appeal to lower-FICO consumers."""
safe investment for people getting in ...maybe? those invested in ...no chances of a profit for next 12 months....overbought and oversold ...going the shopify and netflix way ....
Mastercard is down 4.95% to 342.86
"Been long MA and V, but man are they frustrating"
EUROTRASH STORY'S: Mastercard battles return of $19 billion UK class action.
MA is top holding in myportfolio & not really impressed with its performance last 4 months.
MA or V? which one is better?
"Mastercard EPS beats by $0.18, beats on revenueMastercard (NYSE:MA): Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.74 beats by $0.18; GAAP EPS of $1.83 beats by $0.25. • Revenue of $4.2B (+5.0% Y/Y) beats by $150M. • Gross dollar volume of $1.71T and purchase volume of $1.29T."
OK. I think I've got a handle on this. Just put in an order for one share with a limit price of 280.00. That should hold it.
Mute that clown Ulrich. This is just wall street's taper tantrum on selling growth names and rotating into value. There is no recession coming for another 5 years atleast. Buy and hold solid companies like V and MA and one will be rewarded in the long run.
The big winner from Apple’s presentation yesterday was (drumroll).... MasterCard! On to $300 amigos!
Keep Ma and V. No reason to sell
Rising bottoms for MA!!! GO BABY GO!!!
So with all the good news why are we so flat today?
"Holly C@!$, pre market down 18. After yesterdays landslide!"
MasterCard dying slowly.
Heard of ULTIMATSTOKCALERTS ? They have been killing it and just send me a huge winner .
"MA is trading in way, WAY oversold territory — in gift horse  zone!!!"
The big boys are pumping the market up-and-down on the worries of the tariffs and making a killing.
why down again?
"Fintech should breakout soon, it's been trading sideways for months now. Strong beats by MA, V and PYPL, should see money rotating back into the sector. Today's news of China allowing V and MA to enter might prove to be the catalyst."
Enjoy the low prices on this wonderful pulled back stock opportunity to buy an assload of stock shares or options going in the positive direction. These prices are dropping today for your benefit compliments of shorts bailing out. The recent article suggests prices will go up 1.1% over the coming year and that's just on top of the other appreciation factors that we've been experiencing these past 12 months on this awesome stock.
Stock has had a great run the last week. We need a healthy pullback here and then we will head toward $160.
"Truly awesome company to hold for long term. Great earnings and dividend growth, wish I knew about this name a decade ago. Well better late than never as they say."
Trump is a derelict!
Can’t go wrong with Mastercard...going up!!
"MA Qtr earnings will be released in 13 days.- MA’s revenues and profits will significantly beat Analyst expectations because of the strong holiday season spending, that saw above average consumer sales, and above avg travel over Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Yers holiday travel!*** That was the reason for the slew of analysts upgrades of MA to $375 - $400++ , and, for V’s upgrades to $225 - $250.*** MA and V are trading at odds with the strength of their business!- Buy and hold through these bargain basement prices for huge gains in a matter of weeks.- Play the rebound in these great businesses of our time — like Buffettology teaches."
"MA has been bouncing in a channel between 350-320 since September, looks like $350 is resistance as it was the level just prior to the March drop due to virus. MA will break out very soon, most likely in 2021. The vaccine is here and this new strain is simply noise and allows some profit taking going into YE.Adding on any move under support at 320 and will continue to average down to 285 next support level. MA and V will make you money, play the long term game and not short term trading in channel. This move down is YE trading and profit taking."
"If one has any doubt about this stock's performsnce, Just check out the 5-year and 10-year charts. A true ""buy and hold"" stock, if there ever was."
Hi MA/V Bears~
Go MA go!! This will hit $350 by end of July!! May the fireworks begin early and end super later.
"if this is a Telsa stock, we will be over $3000"
I’m expecting 4 years of market volatility with dementia Joe messing up the American economy
"Why does Dr Fauci keep fighting using Hydroxychloroquine, doesnt he read or realize his own charts about the level of deaths possible. These drugs are used for other diseases and have been around for decades. We cannot wait for years of trials, Fauci needs to get out of his training box and adjust to this pandemic.TRUMP needs to rule over him, he gave Fauci the 30 extra days, he needs to get this drug treatment asap."
"This morning's announcement from MA was great. It adds clarity to the short term impact of the crisis to MA's financials, which was a big scary unknown. It also points to revenue growth despite all the chaos - revenue growth, even small growth, in this environment is a great thing to see. As the world returns to normal, MA will be in great position."
Going to $375 by next week
"GDP 3.4, lowest unemployment in fifty years and we're tanking. Fed is making the recession happen. Get out while you can."
"The NFC Super Bowl winner Markets predictor has come into play in 2021.- NFC SB win predictor has a whopping 85% accuracy rating, (23 of 27 ) in its 55 years of existence!!!

"MasterCard price target raised to $420 from $383 at Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane raised the firm's price target on MasterCard to $420 from $383 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Real-time payments are ""rapidly evolving"" into new use cases and revenue opportunities, Keane tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees new revenue opportunities for the company."
Big tech earnings were outrageously phenomenal — FB and Apple were bonafide barn burners!*** Expect MA to keep pace with the best of its Big tech brethren!
Get ready to buy on another dip next week!
Bounce back day for the market and neither MA or V are reacting very positively. Should that be a concern?
Nice to see Ma dip this morning. I buy more shares on every dip. Mastercard is a growth stock that keeps going up and up and up.
https://www.mobilepaymentstoday.com/news/wex-mastercard-enter-uae-with-virtual-cards/
DO NOT buy MA until it reaches $128 a share. It is still extremely overvalued.
200 ER
"MA longs are in the drivers seat, and those who added on the huge “small volume” declines are actually feeling awesome going into this beautiful spring weekend!*** What a MA and V bonanza!"
This day will be Epic . I am long with MA and AMD
I see this going to 330.00 when eR comes in I love  love  this stock MA
This is some crazy action. I'm buying the dip!!
Had to mute that PokerMon dude. My first mute on this board. Hopefully my last.
"MA or V MSFT or GOOGT or VZI like MA, MSFT, & tie for T and VZ"
$MSFT $NVDA $MA $PEP 
Anyone know what is going on?
Yup this stock is about to boom and take off. Open business is good business! May the Longs be with you!
This is the kind of stock that makes you appreciate life.
"A “gap up” today. Nice start to the week, ."
MA reached a new All Time High at 197.32
ALL TIME HIGHS. $260 by end of April or May is very possible.
Going to $300 tomorrow. Take cover.
I'm starting to wish I had bought some of this a week ago. If theres another big drop in the markets I'll be all over this stock.
buying opportunity in this three days drop in a row.... buy buy buy
Why the sudden $5 drop?
I love my MasterCard. I have the world elite card and get points to buy groceries. I get at least $300 of free groceries every year.
"Level not seen since end of June , is it true ? What the heck ...Baby thrown with the water ..."
Gary01 is MA a buy into ER?
Mr Buffet selling MA and V?
Why down? We’re earnings that bad?
Step right up ladies and gents i have the deal of a lifetime......yes yes it is snake oil at its core but look past that and see all the riches.....yes you too could be left holding the bag but you could strike it rich?
How’s Monday looking?
All time high after earnings. Last quarter they missed and stock went to $290 range. Not anymore.
Why not buy SQ and get in the game instead of assembling an old line team for crypto?
Other then market drag no reason for us to be down...
WTH just happened? Closed in the red now. I guess we are headed back to $115
load up $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
back up the truck
Added more near $104 today.
Major bargain hunting time in MA & V before Qtr earnings release!
$340. This stock is amazing. I would love to hear some predictions of what it will be by the end of the year. This baby seems unstoppable!
I wish I knew to pile in at 185!!!
Looks like MA will go down from here
MA upgrade from neutral to BUY by Bank of America!!!- What a Bonanza!
"First Tesla, now MasterCard. The crypto tides are turning"
It’s estimated that 80 million Americans will travel over the holiday season.- This spike in travel will ensure that MA & V will finish this Qtr on huge positive upswing and great momentum into the New Year!
I'm going to pick up a small position when the downtrend starts reversing.
"I just saw MA was up 25 bucks after hours. So I went to my brokerage account, and it was indeed up 24 dollars and change. Then, when I went to rip some profit, poof it was gone. I was surprised to see it reflected in AH trading as tradable in my brokerage account. Thought it was a just weird buggy thing that happens to YF all the time."
"Last tuesday , two days ago we made a new high and we were all happy ...today we are at $208 and not happy ! Give me a break , don't be greedy and if you are invested in MA and not trading you are rich ! I add MA by blocks of 100 from time to time on the dips , all the way since it was at $120 ( not that long ago ) . MA is a super stock , it just run ahead of itself yesterday when the market was very strong ."
"A run up into EPS report is Usually not a good thing; it's usually MM trickery. So MA down a little AH today is a good thing. imoNow will it beat I can't say, but imo I think it will."
l am out. Sad to say but the writing is on the wall. Unloaded all my MA and V today. I did ok but will sit this one out until better days arrive.
anther day to buy buy buy
I don’t support company that putting millions of people into more DEBT
#$%$ how many spam posts about the market being a bubble do we have to get each day?
I believe near termA lot depends on visa earnings if visas does goodNew money will flow into MasterCard and push it higherMy 2 cents
I want to buy in on a dip. as in buy low. ever going to happen?
Why are MA and V being punished today?
Cramer said today there was huge insider buying today on cnbc.any one can find a link to that?
just sold last week at $305. You're welcome
"Sq vs Ma deadine 2022 , what do bet on and why"
MA is on sale at these trading levels -- Short traders are pruning the the weakest hands and skittish investirs with disinformation before MA's Q4 report!*** Today is bargain hunting time in MA & V!
why we up 15%?
Think we’re going to be flat for most of the December. Don’t think will be much movement.
This morning buy was stealing from the bank
Hoping for $220 in the coming week to add more. I think the market will give us another buying opportunity.
205 coming soon!
Wth do i sell or whatvi just bought and already down 1.50$
Wow short sellers pile up because of Barron's article
Sell off Monday because of multiplying Coronavirus cases and death toll? hmm
great stock
Why this is in red they beat ER no
"Beat!The payment-processing giant said earnings for the three months ended in September came in at $2.1 billion, or $2.07 a share, vs. $1.9 billion or $1.82 a share, in the comparable year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had been expecting earnings of $2.01 a share. Revenue rang in at $4.5 billion, up from $3.9 billion a year ago and above analysts' forecasts of $4.42 billion."
I should have bought more end of October. Forever stock
"It’s improbable that this stock will languish too long below $300.- MA is one of the top businesses of our time, and the sell off was way, WAY overdone, especially; on the eve of the holiday season — which is historically, MA’s strongest Qtr of its fiscal year.- I am convinced it’s time to back up the truck on both V and MA, ‘cause; you will be sniffing, and sipping the bubbly, ringing the Mew Year feeling like an investing genius, for bold actions you took today, to buy a weak, and beaten down — out of favor — MA stock, that was languishing in the bargain bin!"
"4x the drop of the market today, for virtually no reason. Hmmm..."
Looking for a triple sell off buy point. Maybe have a slight rebound tomorrow then fall again. MA is still a buy at any dip. Congrats on the big boy sale.
Almost $290! DOW @ ATH!
One has to be very cognizant while investing in MA and Visa as they do no provide any information in their income statement about the risk factors and how much they have lost because of fraudulent practices and credit risks. Secondly the don’t have forward looking approach for market expansion or penetration as their investments in research and development area is almost zero. Consequently any economic crisis which is likely to trigger before or prior US election these stocks will fall precipitously. So beware pls do not put your money not more than 2% in these stocks.
"The overvalued/ bubblelicious nonsense doesn’t apply to MA & V and here is the logical reason why :The argument that the Market is overvalued is flawed, because the Market trades — not at some set historical PE multiple — but; as a “mathematical derivative” related to the current FED interest rate, and current inflation rate.- The current historically low interest rates and the absence of inflation pressures — allows for Market PE expansion.*** As long as the FED remains accommodative, and the Gov and FED keep adding stimulus, Markets will remain the only game in town.- But we know the overvalued ruse is being pushed to distract and distort a flawed message to bolster “short trading positions in V & MA stocks — since the FED stepped in to back stop global markets, to successfully avoid a global Economic catastrophe!"
"After visa reports this afternoon, tommorw will be another up day for this stock!"
AMEX and V reported strong earnings based upon significant consumer spending in the 2nd Quarter. I expect that MA will do the same when they report their quarterly earnings!!! All three of these companies are extremely bullish right now!!!
"Cashless society ma benefits huge go all credit cards, follow the millennial you will benefit greatly like venmo me."
"Don’t worry, folks.MA will assert itself following its upcoming earnings report in a due for release in a few wKs.I am totally convinced, with the “highest of conviction”,; that MA will once again attain and trade at $1000 / share.- It won’t happen overnight, but within the next 2 to 3 years.So, I recommend going long and using a “periodic accumulation tactic / strategy."
Hope this heads to 200 so I can average down. Fantastic long term hold.
I see MA fields of green into today’s closing bell !!!
Why was Mastercard and quite a few other stocks up on Friday?
"I just do not get it. How can some people bet against MA/V, even if there is some distruption and distraction from recent Fintech IPOs and the disease?"
fintech rolling over. charts showing sell signals
The 5 day chart on this thing looks terrible - 6 month and YTD is very solid . Are we soon to see another single day 2 to 3% move up ?
Wuhan virus.... I do like that better!
MA to overlap $350 within 4 months .... like for yes ....
Which is a better stock... Visa or MasterCard?
what is the good entry price?
I see no news and we're down 16??? Anyone?
I can’t imagine that morons who got shook. Lol
Breakout. The Rolls Royce of Fintech. Full Stop!
Going down some more next week!
Will Mastercard and Visa merge?
TEVA rebounding from 52wk low today. Breaking into 14’s now! Get in while you can!
Abnormal after hour prices but volume is very light.
Headed back to all time high
BOOM goes the Dynamite!
WOW!!! Breakout!!
On the way to $300 amigos. No stopping this train. The Rolls Royce of Fintech :))
Anyone concerned that blockchain/Crypto currencies can cause real problems for the credit card issuers?
it's about for MA to hit 400
Good entry point is when stock RSI is around 30.
Good stock for quick gains on dips. Always recovers.
"Slowly closing in on pre pandemic highs...V, MA, SQ, and PYPL are the best payment stocks to own period. I have made serious money with all 4 and extremely bullish on their futures. Bought all on the pandemic floor in March and have big returns."
"MA TO $ 230 BY DECEMBER 31, 2018!!!"
Looks like we headed to a retest of $256 or so.
Anytime I’m bored I buy more Mastercard and it totally lifts my mood. :))
Next time it drops to $200.00 I am in.
U guys are completely clueless.All the bigBanks bny even ma getting into crypto will squeeze any advantage out of sq and the stock will collapse.Same as si. And pypl. All xtreme sales here $si $sq $ma $pypl
It was a great buy today under $266
MasterCard is outsider
"duh, they have to be against America, most of the customers are not in it."

$250 soon
In correction territory
MA is still trading at 36 times earnings. It needs to fall to $128 a share before I will consider buying.
Expanding into new markets continually.
"To consider coin shortage-everyone requesting credit. Also online purchasing online- all benefit Credit- full disclosure- im biased heavy in MA & V, my biggest holdings and will be thru 2021"
"DOJ has been given the secret word by the administration......""Find Me Money""!! I've seen this many times when govt overspends they start looking for revenue streams in the form of fines and settlements. Companies like tech, financials and any/or highly regulated or duopolies leaders are always target. Once they get their piece of flesh this too shall pass. V/MA are still long term buys...keep averaging through any downturn.(I Posted also on V forum)"
"any reactions to the Kroger, V concern? I sold @214, would like to get back in but am reluctant. Any intelligent would be appreciated"
MA could reach $ 270 per day! This stock is rocking!!!
MA & V are on serious rallies that will take them to new all time highs!- There is very little — if any —resistance to these upward moves because most of the weak hands were washed out on last week’s sell off!*** What a bonanza!!
Here we go again! We're hitting 350s soon.
MA and V ...... like shooting fish in a barrel!
"$AXP trades more like bank. Even though $AXP processes transaction swipes, it is also is a lending center and takes on the risk of defaults (similar to bank lending). Alternatively, $V & $MA don’t do lending, they only processes swipes, and the banks take on the risk of default."
"Never going to split again long term ...Adding a few more soon, I'll look back years from now wishing I could have bought more...Don't we all have those stories."
Prognostication about the future; good luck with that. This is a buy and hold and buy the dip company.
"Trade war insurance stocks, KO,PEP, MA."
MA and V are unloading weak hands in preparation for their cyclical Holiday Season rally.
any chance of a split in the near future?
What do we think of Ma going forward. Sideways or down trend for months I think. We shall see.
ya gotta really enjoy V and MA...what a ride...

"MA back to $400 at EOM after this earnings period. Pent up demand, positive retail results, covid ending, and summer months will drive consumer spend. Its time for MA and V to reach new highs."

"Mizuho adjust price target for MA to $430 from $400, and maintains BUY rating!"
Great stock to be in for the foreseeable future. MasterCard’s business to business is booming and is a larger addressable market than the retail consumer. On top of that is its foray into India which can be prolific. This is a company with a fantastic business plan.
"With all the hoarding folks are surely using their charge cards! Marinate with that for a bit, and you will see this as it is. A buying opportunity! Up and down prices for sure, but it is not necessary with a stock of this caliber to consume and panic about the lowest of lows. Get it within a decent range and your future will be golden. glt :)"
Looks like a cup and handle chart formation....I think we will be heading up here soon. My guess...$342 plus by the end of the week. GLTA!

Buy algorithms have remained consistently active throughout this trading session heading into the final 20 mins of trading!*** What a MA & V bonanza!
MA is down 6.19% to 223.15
going nowhere
Love MA but this market is frightening. Hitting highs in the midst of a pandemic? The economics aren’t making sense.
Morgan Stanley raised it's price target to $360.
Back on again
310 by this week!
MA beats and barely moves
"very sluggish, no momentum"
Beast Mode!!
I like the stock but I have t bought again. Don’t see how the stock can be making new highs when volumes transaction are down 40 percent from pre Cov 19. They have massive exposure to the airlines and travel industry. It is extremely expensive at this level.
MA & V are currently trading in the extremely oversold zone!- It's a bargain bin shopping opportnity for value hunters!!!
"For sure it is manipulate trades today for MA, because all its peers, V, AXP and bank stocks does not move irrational like MA this morning. Look like some body is pounding MA right now, which I think it will subside later in the late afternoon."
I just bought another 100k thanks MS
Who sold at $318 on the AH?
so weak
MA has now paid $50.82 in dividends per original $39 share.

"Since August, a $44 drop p/s. WTH?"
"Just grinds out gains year over year, then you look back 12 months and your up 50%."
This pullback is a head fake because the volume is very small to indicate any significant inflection type trend!
SPX just formed death cross. All longs that want to initiate a new position please be careful and patient.please wait for panic selling and then initiate new position. that way you do not lose money. good luck to everybody
A must-have for any portfolio
Mizuho Securities raised its PT to $430
Back above 300 in no time...long and strong. MA and V...two monsters that have made me a rich man and will only make me richer as time goes on.
Let’s take out the all time high in the coming weeks. We should top $300 by EOY for the Rolls Royce of Fintech. :))
RUN FOR HILLS SHORTIES RUN......….
love you MastercardWe need to make a plan to im peach the master because hes talking of another Massive Stimulus.VENEZUELA HERE WE COME!!
"Today, MA went up a mere 81 cents or .81%. However, if you invested in MA at the IPO, that was worth nearly 21% of your initial investment."
Keep a watch on those March lows. Covid 2.0 will be worse. The virus is everywhere.
"stocks go up quick in a bull mkt and fall very less, we have been in a bull market since the last 3 weeks."
Seeking Alfa article has MA begged @ $250/share fair value.
Beat expectations by $.02
Does this mean people have inside info that MA won't meet estimated earnings?
nothing like a pandemic to bring some buying opportunity!
**as like you I also bought at 293
This is terrible. Even with an earnings beat this will close down tomorrow. Where did 203 go????
just like last October..
"Should I wait for a dip in MA or buy when market opens? New to investing and really interested have 10 shares in Visa, 2 in PayPal and 3 in FB. Was thinking of investing in MA last week but didn’t."
Tomorrow we are going down! Deep down.
This thing just doesn't want to make new highs. Been in this $105-$110 trading range for some time. We should be at $115+ by now.
"Lots of ""Big Money"" chasing both ""MA"" and ""V"" which is great until they DON'T. Iam long both but a little concerned that both names are way ahead of themselves."
What's going on with MA?
"Sell now on the up for an eventual freefall before things get back to normal, or hold> That is the questions. My average is higher than most at $278."
"Here we go again, $178-$182 coming which is a joke courtesy from MM manipulating both MA and V. We just reported exceptional Holiday sales which should bode well for Credit Card Companies. People pay with plastic not cash, should not be down this much and suffering from such resistance at $189. Needs to break out to over $200 soon. Price action for a 2% drop is UNREASONABLE!!!!"
"Selling both visa and ma,"
The Bulls Are Out!!! US comes to agreement on trade talks with Canada on NAFTA!!!MA will close at $ 228 today!!!
My only green today...!!
why the pop?no news that I can see!
What a run this month!

RIP MasterCard
Here comes the push to $ 282.00!!! GO MA GO!!!
Buy buy buy...we use cash less less every year! No brainer to buy MA
What’s wrong with MA today?
"Starting to look like Enron. ""you can bet your life on this one"" . Still. Since 2012 it has gone up 700%"
can someone explain whey master fell today 11 dollars is disgraceful...looks like it is all manipulated now that earnings is next month
Good opportunity to buy more?
250.00 soon
I been in and out since 176.
I see a total break out of this
This is going to hit a new high Friday July 19 - BOOM !!
Down over $10 a share. WHY?????
"and here we are again, the usual EOD last 10 minute market slide. I guess the inevitable yet elusive $390 level will need to wait for Monday. We got within 12 cents.....MA will get there to start that climb above $400. TOO FUNNY!"
Why the drop?
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-ma-outpaces-stock-market-224510815.htmlMasterCard (MA) closed at $200.33 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.31% move from the prior day."
Which stock is better & why?MA or V
This board is dead when we drop....
"Guys, buy more now or wait? Ich wanted it to go to 245, but I don‘t think it will go that low."
Being reported that EU bank consortium is launching their own credit card system in 2022 / any concerns to V and MA ...?
"Amaizing discount, loaded up again !"
MA reached a new All Time High at 175.88
"Shorts are attacking all payment companies, Visa, Paypal, Master, and Square. It happens simply because these stocks rise too fast and someone wants to find a entry point. Once reach option strike day Friday, it will run again,"
Bears everywhere when most stocks are giving u amazjng chances to get back in. All the doomers are back which is
will cover at 310c'mon
MA reached an all time high at 286.20
$200 March low is your entry point. Ride it back up.
MA is in a channel 313-360 and has good moves frequently. Good play for option traders.
YOY numbers aren’t that great considering this time last year the country was shut down. Economy has been reopening why aren’t people using this mastercards!? Maybe take a quarter or two to catch up?
@Mucho I knew I could count on you to be here! Thanks for all your recommendations!
GO MA GO! The Rolls Royce of Fintech!
"Can someone explain to us why Cramer considers Mastercard a Tech company? Perhaps he considers Home Depot a tech co too? Or maybe Altria (MO). Just a while ago he was pumping Nvidia and AMD. How come these companies are not in his in his top 5? He is educated, intelligent, but also a fool with an ego bigger than Trump."
I just bought another 1000 share. It will run up to the all time high. 
"@Paula - MA was extremely overvalued at $200, and it is still overvalued at $180. Please study the ""intelligent investor"" and learn about valuation analysis. It's possible for MA to pop over $200 over the short-term like it did briefly last year, but it won't stay there simply because it is extremely overvalued. Remember great companies make terrible investments when you overpay for them."
"Guidance cut for 1st quarter revenue growth was notable. A 3% reduction in revenue growth is pretty big, considering that the coronavirus scare really just took hold in the last 4 weeks and that China doesn't use Mastercard directly domestically....they employ Unionpay for processing. What seems a bit more foreboding is that the reduction in growth rate comes from the cross border assessments and these are the highest profit center for Mastercard and Visa. So, a reduction in growth rates from the most profitable part of the business model could mean more limited profit growth this year than was originally expected.If cross border travel continues to be pressured, and cross border shopping falls as well, then this won't be the only downward revision from MA for the year ahead."
MA is up 7.23% to 258.97
buying back soon.
Blockchain? Can. Someone explain the real value. I heard blockchain transactions were very slow.
MA reached a 52 Week low at 222.77
MA at $400 then split 4:1 by EOM.
MA going the wrong way now! Several bad days in a row. May test the $350 level again.
$200 52 week low is your buy point.
"WOW! An Argentina Christmas is here everyone.....MA and V will make new highs very soon. MA over $125 and V over $151 by EOY.....My biggest holding will pay off big and hope a HUGE win for everyone, Merry Christmas ALL!"
"Idiot ""Judge"" on CNBC says MA and V to be hurt by proposals of maximim 15% cr card interest rates. The issuing banks might feel it..but not MA + V."
"listen to JPM cc with how strong Credit cards were.....no worries here people!! strong buy MA, V, SQ, COF, PYPL, AXP"
56 P/E ratio!! Wow. Not with a ten foot pole!!
Great time to nibble in the dynamic duo of MA & V during this early trading session.
"hopefully new high..Visa is back to new high, MA should be too!"
"Has to break 232 first, otherwise in trouble"
I TOLD YOU SO!
It never made any seance to me. As soon as they mention a rate hike this stock sells off and the banks go way up. Got to love Wall Street lol. MA long and strong.
"I don’t own MA but I am completely disgusted by the complete and total manipulation. Today‘s One day chart shows a perfect descending triangle, suggesting more downside. but as soon as someone tries to go short, they will bring this up, fraudulently scamming money from people. Only the rich and connected are making money in this market because they control it."
(GLNNF) Glance Tech. This is coming very big.
Let’s see if MA can hold $360
Very weak stock
"Play MA & V into this Holiday Season shopping blitz, this is their strongest Qtr of the year!‘Tis the most wonderful time of the year for the “dynamic duo”, ‘cause they are everywhere you are, and want to be — during the Holidays thru ringing in the New Year!"
Pump and dump. Stock overbought!
We’re going to the moon! Who’s all coming along?
"MA at buying range, see steady uptick thru Q4 then expect pullback before off to races, Will end 2020 at $342, end 2021 at $409"
mypillow lays off 150 employess because they're expanding into new business. Yeahhhhh........ Why is it that right wing nutters are incapable of telling the truth?https://www.bizjournals.com/twincities/news/2019/05/10/my-pillow-lays-off-150-workers-in-shakopee.html
Mastercard cant get into crypto quick enough its going to be a huge boost of momentum once its part of the network
You dummies thought smooth sailing in this crazy market. Welcome to the rabbit hole￼￼￼
Powerful stock ready to really take off.
"Mastercard (MA) is planning to boost its quarterly disbursement by 10% to 44 cents a share from 40 cents. The stock, which yields 0.5%, has returned about 10% this year. The company’s board also authorized the company to repurchase up to $6 billion of its class A common stock."
I think it goes to $190.
Chances of this going below $220 are finished. Only going up from here! Keep adding to the train. Steam rolling ahead!!
"Seriously, I am completely lost. How could a good ER bring down the stock price? What's going on? Is it there any political reason to manipulate the entire market down regardless?"
"I just put in sell stops on my holdings in AAPL, MA, and MSFT tonight. Considering the futures, I expect them all to get taken out. I am an investor, not a trader, but I don't intend to sit by and watch my portfolio crash before my eyes. I will buy them all back once the carnage subsides, and will end up with more shares by doing this. Selling is fairly new to me, but, I guess i have to do what I ghave to do. The problem is figuring when this slide will end. I will watch the VIX to help me make my decision, as I know very little about TA. Good luck to everyone, whatever you decide. I imagine I am not alone in this decision. Just wish I had done it a week ago. But, better late than never..."
"@Paula - Please educate yourself before posting nonsense on this board. Both Bush and Obama inherited recessions. Deficits naturally rise during recessions as the government's #1 source of income (income tax) declines as unemployment spikes. Yes, Bush wasted a lot money on war, but Obama saw tax revenue collapse as the economy fell into a severe recession that would have been a depression had Bernanke not printed money.Now we have Trump running HUGE deficits with the economy booming and unemployment at a 49 years low. It is unheard to run record deficits when the economy is booming. The prudent thing to do is to pay down debt when the economy is booming, but Trump is doing the opposite.These are the fact. Please educate yourself so that you understand how the economy works. For the record, I am a lifelong republican. But I cannot deny the facts, which show that Trump is destroying our economy."
what happened? why is MA down by 7% ?
MA will be a big part of the revolutionary boom! Believe Believe Believe I do............
"great quarter, fed cuts rates and the stock falls --- makes sense"
"Weekly report on jobless claims 3,300,000 in one week. Highest since 1982. They are figuring on 4,000,000 next week. Markets up 800. Please explain."
"Stay cool, the entire market is down, I remember the last crash, everyone was saying Apple was done, how’d that work out... too much money to be made at these prices for the big guys to hold back much longer."
Prime Day and new iPhones being released... this stock should be up a lot more than this! No one is using cash to make purchases!
Mastercard Engage platform expansion provides customers with fast and easy access to new set of qualified technology partners!*** Ūber-bullish for MA and V in light of the projections for the rising global economy — as the world moves in a positive direction towards opening up!
Hey Vermillion.... What's IMO stand for?
Yea thir! All time high amigos. :))
but history doesn't always repeat.......good luck ALL....
Easily going to $300 or lower. Wouldn’t touch it until that price for sure. 100%
This hurts!!! 194$...
Anticipate $250 by close of Monday
Last chance to play the rebound in MA for HUGE gains before they report record earnings and profits at 8:30AM before opening bell tomorrow!
Ma holding as market gets pummeled
Remember we had a pretty substantial run up leading into the ER so to go up again from here is impressive. They came through big time on that mouthwatering ER.
"Up to $302 in premarket today! Nice. I believe we’re beginning our climb back up. This should get back up to $330 plus by the end of this year, if not sooner I think. Good luck all!"
"133.50 by Monday, (chart) is pretty clear that MA can move 2% a week. If the chart does not lie. Fundamental is strong, technical supports BREAK OUT pattern."
BELIEVE!
Held over $300. Well Done!
Little question from a newbie.Visa or mastercard? Both? Good entry point in your opinion? Thanks for feedback
is this going to go below $300 again? I am getting the feeling it is becoming a $600 stock. Don't know if I should buy back in hoping for a pull back or is this it?
PayPal and Visa good earnings Mastercard next week 285
Long term yes. Short term play the ups and downs.We're not done yet. Not even close!
Five million more loose their jobs this week.
"Closed in the afterhours at 322.70. Thanks, AAPL! Good luck it the morning, gang, although I doubt we need it!"
New 52wk high....again! Up and up we go!
"This is a knee jerk reaction. Most of China's factories are running fine. It's a big country and the virus is in only a few areas. 85,000 died of the flu in the U.s. last year and the market was fine."
Right now is a good time to buy MA or place a call option.
It's crazy but not unusual. Wild expectations were disappointed. Over the next few days it will drift higher. If this was tesla or amazon it would be up $80 today.
How can Amazon be up and Visa and MasterCard be down?
$315 tomorrow
75.46% of the shares are held by institutional investors. No wonder there are only a few posts on this message board. That is a huge number.
Oversold here. Buy the dip. Buying V today as well.
Smart move on the part of Mgmt .Get the lower guidance out while market down 1k point .
Major put buying prior to close
tempted to take profits and rebuy later. your thoughts?
A great day here - $300 plus before you know it - boom !
"consumer sentiment way up and MA down, go figure. Time to buy more!!"
Dividend payout today!

"Down more in after hours, don't get it. American Express even reported that consumers spent more on their credit cards in the third quarter."
awesome MasterCard. The Rolls Royce of FinTech
285 tomorrow
we will see 144.75 by friday..........................
"This whole sell off is being manipulated. 40 to 50 million Americans get the flu each year. 20 000 to 80,000 die. Economy does fine. 15 people get a cold virus called Cordova and the world is coming to an end. Business will fail and the economy will collapse. Market sells off 3000 pointsmoff fear and a pipe dream."
"MA and V take pennies from every transaction. As the world moves to online, more transactions for MA and V. As the worlds turns away from cash..."
This should be up $5 today. It's barley green!
"VISA got upgraded today: Oppenheimer raised price target to $245, from $212, and maintains “Outperform rating!***That’s a 15% upside from today’s lows!!!- Since V & MA are joined by the hip, you’ll expect MA’s upgrade is in the works — given that the current Q4 is the “dynamic duos” strongest Qtr of their Fiscal Year — that being Holiday Season that flows from Thanksgiving , Black Friday thru New Year’s Eve ringing in 2021!!!"
"Down any more, and I gotta skee-daddy. Buying more when 'ugly news cycle slows down."
"Wow this moves kinda quick. Feels like a week ago, that my last add was @ 288."
Why is it down 5% in after hours?
Time has not come. Don't buy any credit card stocks. consumer and business bankruptcies would start from May - June and these stocks are expected to go down another 35 to 40 percent. Remember these stocks were $10 and $11 respectively in 2009. so minimise your loss. Be try to be rational and take decision based on economic conditions.
Great company
Added my first position 25 shares of $MA at $221 earlier today. Long term investment here. Bought $V at $141 too.
"no brainer to hold ma, got in since 2012 August...it was just $42 (420 before split)"
per earnings whispers ...eps $1.83 surprise +06.4%
Great report. But we already ran up into earnings. This may finish in the red. It will head to $300 soon!
This is like pouring fertilizer on rocket fuel.
"It is a bear trap this morning. I believe that MA, and V will be the winner no matter what outcome from Yellen's hole."
nice rally into the close
"buy any weakness, period!"
The trend is back and on its way back to 366 and onward to 400 and beyond. Added more today
two A Hole analysts ( CFRA & Thompson-Reuters) in last two days downgraded MA. No logical reason unless they have some 'insider' motives. These so called analysts should be in jail. One wrong word from one of these jerks and stock will plummet. Just crooked!
All I hear is up up up. All I see is down down down....
Goes to show when we turn the corner on this virus how much pent up demand there is for MasterCard.
In my opinion all three are poised for huge gains within the next few years! $$$$
Ma will lose legal case in UK.Big bucks.

Buy while below $300
"2 trillion gave us 5k points on the dow, another 2 trillion takes us back to 350 in 2 weeks, this is beyond rigged."
Consumer spending will be huge for the 2nd quarter!!! I expect MC and V to move higher when they report their 2nd quarter earnings!!!
Media talking heads will grow tired and be off to some other topic they can hype. MA will be back.
Adding before earnings!
"Must be a ton of day traders. Familiar pattern on MA, buy early, sell late."
What caused the spike at the close today?
"Awesome buying opportunity here right now. With the holiday season coming, this should start climbing up to $360 to $365 and beyond pretty soon in my opinion. Good luck to all!"

So stupid selloff! It gives me a chance to add in
"Stock will cool off together with the market. After that, buying opportunity will arise."
"If yesterday served as any indication, MA is one resilient stock that should be bought with both hands on any sign of weakness!*** Go long and stay strong — buy into inflection point dips, and just keep on keeping on.- Rinse wash and repeat for HUGE gains."

MA on sale. Buy.

MA is worse then V. At least for now.
What is everyone’s feelings about earnings? Going to crash or rebound nicely??
"@Paula - Blame Trump, not the Fed. The Treasury is flooding the market with bonds to fund Trump's deficits. This is causing bond prices to fall and interest rates to rise. In addition, Trump's tax cuts and spending are stimulating an economy with unemployment at a 49 year low. This is causing inflation, and the Fed has a mandate to raise rates when it sees a threat of inflation. Trump's tariffs are also causing inflation. If Trump did the responsible thing and cut spending and paid down debt, inflation would be lower and interest rates would be lower. This is all Trump's fault. The Fed is merely reacting to Trump's foolish fiscal stimulus when the economy is at full employment."

The market does not like the new nutball in office.
"And i sold at 211 back in October after that fear rally, i simply forgot to buy back for 172$ when i had the chance. Now im looking from the side lines and feel like #$%$"

"MA is the perfect stock to own in these variable uncertain times! Why? Credits are worst than casinos, they will make money, guaranteed no matter what the economy does. It doesn't matter what crazy #$%$ Trump does, it doesn't matter how trade talks will end up! They will be profitable! This is a well run company with employees who love coming to work everyday. Customers who use this brand of credit card love MA! while I can't predict the future, this stock should grow and be worth 320 dollars by year end. Do yourself a favor and add this stock! Your risk is zero! Buy before it reaches my target price of 320 at years end. Your welcome!"
MA might go above 180$ for Option expire tomorrow. I have seen MMs played it many times
"There were some on this board who said MA had run it's course in the 190s and sold out of their positions. Well guess what, MA as well as V will keep trending higher as long as consumers continue spending money."
"MA EPS = $1.01, compared to Q1 0.86c in 2016 !!Beat estimate of 0.94c"

Way oversold!
