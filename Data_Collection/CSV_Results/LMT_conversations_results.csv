"LMT seems to be a very slow moving stock.if I don't want to tie up capital fo more than 3 months, not worth investing despite the defense spending bill"
what goes up will come down.
This dump was because the board cheerleaders didn't show up. SIUYA.

"Turkey is officially kicked out of F35 program I believe. Could cause production and delivery delays; unless the plant in Mississipi (I believe it’s there) they were set to close picks up the radar portion. Either way, might still drop in price even with the possibility in a minor hiccup in production.."
ARK bought 50 thousand shares of LMT
"Once again, $400..."
"Long term trend indicators now beginning to take shape , 100 ema closing in on the 150"

wow..I wish I had some money. Tomorrow will gain it back.

Why ain't my last two comments ain't shown?
It looks kind of ridiculous today that some chronically dumb hedge funds and retail gamblers were unloading recently in the $33x range. Stop trying to time the stocks and get wealthy for a change.
Soooo tomorrows gonna be somethin
"Lockheed 'Steamroller' Martin... $340 will eventually look like $100, and so on, and so forth. LMT is a lucrative investment for the foreseeable future."
If share price is going to stay this low then LMT needs to take on debt and start buying its stock back.
Little down draft today?
I love the stock market and equities. I love LMT.
"One observation, it's down on a down day, but 1% compared to Tesla's 6%."
"LMT just won ""another"" $258M satellite communications contract. After a while these wins are going to add up to a boost in the company's revenue growth and stock valuation."
Does he really think like Bush with Iran starting a fake news war with Iran will win him the election?
Never have I seen a tighter range for defense stocks
stock needs to split. Not many individual investors can come up with 35k to buy 100 shares.
amazing gets to 400 market s—-ts the bed and goes down 10
"Well, boys and girls, should we stay in or get out ?"
What’s that aroma?
Bitcoin or Lockheed?
Although the stock has been flat this year which is ok. Lockheed has piled on new contracts to a massive backlog and is increasing revenues while still undervalued. Whatever happens as long as this stock is under 450 I’m buying more and more while this stock is flat and under the radar.
does LMT have Chinese supplier s or customer s?
Looks like the bottom is in the pre-market. Looking for a bounce soon.
Yahoo finance is a joke these days
where does it go after earnings??????
FYI--Credit Suisse just raised the price target from $400 to $409.
"Sharing this with you. This is why investing is difficult.There is a news story from MT Newswires that there was some ""significant"" selling of shares by insiders at LMT over the last 90 days. That's what's moving the stock lower today (4/26).Some things to consider:1. MT Newswires has a disclaimer that no news they report should be considered investment advice.2. MT Newswires is on many trader and retail traders news feeds (like mine).3. Company beat earnings estimates and raised earnings estimates for next quarter and full year.4. 2 Brokerage firms lifted the price target for LMT in the past week based on the ER.5. LMT still has a backlog of $148B.6. Insiders sell for lots of reasons ......many not tied to the company's future profitability.So there you have it....read the list and decide what you think you should do. I am holding."
more room to fall?
I will only buy if it is $180 and China forgive LMT and #$%$ trump
Off to the poor house we go !!!
Sure glad LMT knows what they are doing BA sure doesn’t
Will there be a LMT stock split in the near future ?
"Yep, obvious short this week. Suckers."
Out of favor now soon to be in favor
trump manipulation of lmt is the reason Manipulation
Morons out there dont even realizeBiden has a head defense committe member for years
Lands on an asteroid. Investors then short stock. U cant make this up
"The U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin successfully conducted the sixth ARRW Instrumented Measurement Vehicle (IMV) flight test from Edwards AFB, California. All objectives were accomplished, paving the way for booster vehicle testing."
Sikorsky firing on all cylinders. Igor is smiling! ;)
Up 10. Wow!. A light at the end of this dark tunnel?
the price here does not match my broker price. why???
CHINESE SANCTIONS! They deleted my last post. #$%$
Thinking about taking a position. Wondering why their price to book ratio is so high. Thoughts?
LMT - YOU IDIOTS ! The AF now knows you're scared about getting another follow-on contract. By telling them and the world about your doubts gives them leverage to drag out the negotiations. They'll want concessions to do the deal.
I figured we'd give back some of yesterday's gains but geez! I am in it for the long haul though.
Gradually Already accumulating more for bigger dividends in June! This is how you become wealthy folk!
"The pension transfer to Prudential is not good for retirees as they lose ERISA and PBGC protection. If Prudential fails, the only protection is from their state’s program and there is a lifetime cap on the resultant benefit whereas for PBGC it pays until death. This pension risk transfer benefits LMT and Prudential, but is a take away from the retirees and current employees pending retirement. Not fair to employees and there needs to be new regulations. At a minimum, reitirees should be given the option, and LMT should be required to purchased a third party insurance policy to replace the protection that was provided by PBGC. Continued erosion of overall employee benefits (this being just one element of change) is hurting the aerospace industry and is impacting current employee morale. Attrition rates have increased in the aerospace sector and with that, the loss of critical tacit knowledge. This knowledge loss is impacting program performance which is manifested in technical problems, schedule delays and cost overruns. Years ago, the aerospace sector was viewed as having the best benefits, and great technology and as such attracted top talent. Today, it is easy to find other companies with better benefits packages and higher technology and as such the top engineering talent is going elsewhere. It is also evident as the top management is driven by financial performance as opposed to what historically made the industry - the next great engineering design. Investors should look much deeper."
One article after another about how LMT won another contract. This think will explode when they release earnings.
Want the dividend? Got to own it by the end of day Friday.
LMT has been lacking behind NOC and GD even though business performance is fine. Hopefully it will catch up in coming weeks.
"LMT closed at 340.19 last Friday. I finally broke even at 347.26 after buying one more share at a time under 340 - lowering my initial PPS from 390. Yikes! If it closes in 2 hours at 347.27, I'll be happy."
Biden and company are licking their chops and ready to decimate defense industry.
"Its not just LM, its the whole group with LM underperforming everyone. Its a real dog right now. This is how far off their respective highs each stock isNo. Ticker 52W High1 BA -43.48%2 HII -41.16%3 RTX -26.79%4 LMT -25.69%5 NOC -23.43%6 LHX -23.22%7 GD -20.85%8 TDG -17.11%9 TXT -8.35%"
Looks like we are going up again... Those get in when share price was $20 are the luckiest individuals...
"How did she time her selling so perfectly?Chairman, Pres. & CEO of Lockheed Martin Corp (NYSE:LMT) Marillyn A Hewson sold 19,000 shares of LMT on 01/30/2018 at an average price of $346.74 a share. The total sale was $6.6 million."
does LMT have any Chinese supplier is?
Going down again !!!???
so how far back does everyone go? My initial purchase (and still holding) in LMT was March 2013 at 88.9/share. I've continued to add since then. Today is a beautiful day. :-)
"This seems like a good choice considering irrational exuberance in Tesla, Bitcoin, Solar, etc which don't justify astronomical increases in price. Sure, democrats would rather take money from defense funding and pay people $600 per week to stay unemployed, but once the COVID kum-ba-ya lord moment comes to an end (as tends to happen when external force threatens mankind), people will once again seek out war as usual, right?"
Say Goodbye....Bubble is Bursting!
Is there anybody here who can tell me why LMT is down even in the up market?
Did we get a boo-yah from Cramer? I think algo computers just booking some gains.
Good oportunity to add some shares here.
everybody is up except this one
increasing treasury yields will cause a rotation from overvalued tech and green energy stocks to value names paying reliable dividends
"Bought 2 Jan 21 2022 330 strike options contracts on LMT. It cost $7k, I’m thinking it can’t possibly get that much worse over a whole year and it’s likely to bounce up to around $400 at some point during that year. I can’t exercise the contract due to the massive cost (around $66k) so I plan on reselling it for around a 50-100% return. Thoughts?"
LMT & NOC
This thing was played like Pigary's email...
"@ Bob ...my mistake, It was back in late december of 2018."
"Can anyone comment or share their ideas as to why this stock trades near a 52 week low with all the good news out there on LMT. I do not own the stock but looking to get in. Is it the Kahshoggi issue, balance sheet debt, competitive issues with Boeing? What keeps it down? Only serious replies please. Thanks"
again a failure close to 400 ...over and over
LMT sell off cometh!
"We are acquiring Aerojet. Depending on how the deal is structured, this might be the reason they were monkeying with the SP.All in all, it is a huge positive, we are adding tons of equity for little expense.It might attract new investors."
"Seems like LMT gets a lot of news on Fridays. If can get either- #$%$ F35- F35 sales approval to UAE, Switz, others- #$%$itive Aerojet news- #$%$itive news on the hypersonic testing going on rite now- #$%$ news and a hook up w some other company on Taiclets 5g dreamWill be off to the races"
Here we go again !
"I’ve never seen LMT green just after earnings, so don’t get your hopes too high."
This has nothing to do with Sanders. Dem party has already dug his grave. He's a walking dead man.
Go study GE's chart real close if you want to know where LMT's stock is heading. It has been trading sideways for a while so it is either going up or heading down
Should fire all bottom LMT money managers!
"Buy,Buy, Buy tomorrow"
"OK......so they definitely did not ""exceed"" estimates. I would recommend that potential sellers of the stock go to LMT website and listen to the 1 hour CC. They did not have a ""bad"" quarter, but they certainly didn't knock it out of the park either. Future earnings and revenue growth are projected higher and free cash flow will be growing every year. I understand the selloff by traders (not investors). But I am willing to hold my position here, with my cost basis in the $340's."
it time to sell !
"Another $1.4B awarded to LMT for the ""growing"" Super Hercules program. Add it to the growing backlog. Can't wait to hear what that number has grown to. Earnings report in late January should be epic."
"LMT is safe money. Yes you could be making money in the market other ways but keep your $100k+ safe here and use a few G to gamble on the crazy market plays. When those valuations blow, what’s left of the money will run here to where it’s safe."
I guess LMT just needs to promote its electric jets and solar project so it canl get a crazy valuation as well.
I read Cathie Wood ARK invest bought shares

I want my 2 for 1 split.... Split Split
355 coming sorry guys
@Kevin... Thank you for your reply
About time this tide is stemmed!
Is this a good company to invest?
"Lockheed and utilities have been good to me long term, but always disappointing to see them red on an otherwise promising day."
"Some people are saying we are at ""peak"" defense spending . RTN, GD, NOC are all down. Thoughts??"
"Boys, that is huge move: I'm back!"
anyone know if LM is going after cyber weapons contracts?
Just want to thank that GS downgrade to buy some more just before the good news. I know they were buying as well lol
Any mutual funds with high dividend folks?
"'Peace' will never last long. It would be too good to be true. NK was only a recent threat, it came and went quickly."
This thing wants to go higher
lmt will never split. buy now!!!!!! great deal.
351 when it should be 400
"Too many sore losers on this board. You sold and lost money, now its time to move on."
"people loves to hold junk, they said they loved it and paid money. those old people have full house of junks. My guess LMT is the junk since China had sanction on the company. LMT can not make F35 anymore! How to deal with this problem?"
The volume for yesterday was a million shares shy of the overall shorts out earlier.
LM has made these moves before. in 2018 it declined 33% bottoming out on Christmas Eve. Earlier this year it went from 442 to 276 for a 36% decline. I personally think it bottoms around 322 for this correction. You can tell when it happens. Some bad news will come out that makes you think the stock will crater and it will go up.
I don't care a whole lot about the valuation at this point. I have no plans to sell. I purchased a thousand shares under $100 over a decade ago and I wouldn't let them go
pigs get eaten and Hogs get slaughtered
"Once again, eye watering delivery"
So Aunt Marilyn sold 7 millions dollars of shares. Does this mean that the corporation's insiders..er... I mean executives...will begin selling their shares too?
Closing red boys!!!!
LMT still cannot hold a candle to Boeing.
"was reading their 10k again, other than buying rocketdyne, I had read that they have plans for growth till 2070. If you are fighting a defense company that has half a century in plans, than ur probably eating crow and pumping gamestop. sidenote: hype af for the divvy, trying to cop more before the 28th!"
Aerojet shareholders mean nothing. Feds have to approve no anti trust. Frankly with all the hate towards us because of F 35 I am now 50/50
Continued downdraft from the Far East...
Biden is not anti military morons $rtx $lmt
I would highly recommend that you don't sell your LMT shares 1 week away from their earnings report. GLTA.
Surprisingly few comments. Spammers must have gone elsewhere. Election day and market goes on as usual.
"Well I really respect this company however with favorable tax rates, increases in domestic/foreign sales, F-35 dispute being resolved, beating earnings, raising most guidance...why not state cash flow will improve somewhat. Not a good statement given the conditions and ability to cover pension cost."
Yikes!
Any guesses on how much the divi goes up? I say they can probably do something in the double digits.
"Sold it today at $390. I didn't like the double top and will look to get back in under $380 again. In the meantime I still own NOC, RTX, LHX and GD. SO I'm still in the sector."
ays agoAt current levels do you continue to accumulate shares or is it time to hold and reallocate?
2/4/2021--From Fly -on the Wall.......LMT call volume higher than normal and directionally bullish.
Heading to $416
Probably soon join the list of junk stocks if LMT decide to not buy back their shares at this moment. The reported news were slightly negative while LMT stock has been flagged as dangerous to invest. It was out of my expectation to believe that LMT neglect its investors' profit.
417 a share.
"Huntsville, Ala. – Oct. 9, 2020 – Lockheed Martin [NYSE: LMT] today announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire a portion of Integration Innovation Inc. (i3), a software and systems engineering company based in Huntsville, Alabama. The portfolio alignment between i3 and Lockheed Martin provides the opportunity to design and deliver hypersonic-specific technology solutions that benefit the warfighter."
LMT is down 7.15% to 296.04
https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/defense-firms-don-t-competing-214309834.html
"Not digging the latest F-35 rhetoric, but believing it apparently."
"The after hours volume is very light, LMT will dip on the open, and end up green. Buy buy buy."
"It was a good report, beat on earnings , raised full year EPS estimate midpoint. Cash on the balance sheet increased etc..... But that doesn't mean that it's enough to move the stock."
Far East downdraft continues fueled by you know what.
"For those who don't think political commentary belongs on a stock board, can you think of anything else that would affect the whole market as severely as the wrong election result?Increase in corporate tax rate, slashing defence spending, increase in capital gains tax rate, taxation of unrealized gains, nationalization of health care, end to the coal, oil and gas industries, no airlines, levies on your IRAs and 401ks, taxation of ROTHs, end of cattle ranching and Beyond Meat is your compulsory diet, trap your fart in a bottle and dispose of it as hazardous waste, open the trade doors to China and the borders to Mexico, and all the other total nutjob proposals out there"
Do you folks hear about the Northern Trust bank? Is this a good bank to put money in savings?
that's some nice after hours
"Down $25 in a week, and you got folks cheerleading this stock? Sorry, but there's no reason to believe this will turn around this year. There are no major contracts in the offing, and nothing to push this back up. One thing I've been disappointed in is that the new CEO is not any kind of the cheerleader that Marillyn was. Maybe the new CEO wasn't the best choice for this company.....?"
Where is the bottom... 
This is why you shouldn’t be a kool-aid drinker and own your own company stock but instead be diversified.
where is the buyback
"Decline on light volume. 80% of shares held by institutions. We will likely never know why the big boy is selling, maybe not even related to LMT concerns, but to simply have funds to buy something else they like better right now. I am buckling up until the seller is done,"
Going Back UP!!!
Looking to add at $375
new technology is moving faster than the old dinosaurs they will be the new reality not a smart #$%$ or another investment scheme just another investor trying to help
12/29/2020....Pentagon----US State Department approves $4.2B arms sales to Kuwait. Add it to the list.
Road to 340s is clear for us fools
Stock is up because of the 7 billion free cash flow. Congrats
$150b backlog. Huge contracts. Great history. Steady increases in rev and income. Those who say there is no future are delusional.
when is the dividend check?? and how much is it?
How come Kevin doesn’t want to discuss the CEO selling near the peak? Was I right?
"With all the good news, this should be over 315 at least."
"Pentagon could secure the REEMF for the cost of 2 planes, current Market Cap34.622M, ...https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/REEMF/community?p=REEMF"
Most obvious short in the market this week....
Hey !! It went down yesterday. Why ??
2018 DOT&E report is out...and it aint pretty. There was no improving trend in F-35 fleet aircraft availability- Fleet-wide average availability is below program targetvalue of 60 percent and well below planned 80 percentneeded for efficient conduct of IOT&E.http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2018/pdf/dod/2018f35jsf.pdf
"There we go, acting like the ^DJU utility index again today."
"Told ya, down it goes.... sigh. I'd say something else involving a 4 letter word, but I'd probably get censored.... Drats."
"LMT going down, down, and down. Boeing, Northrop, Raytheon, going up, up, and up."
Time to BUY
Did they buy NNDM?
"Weekly score for those of you that compare the movement to the change of the S&P (which you should not do). This is close of Friday 3/12 to close of Friday 3/19.. This best part is we strongly held the $350 mark.S&P 500--- 3943 to 3913 = -30 points or (-0.76%)LMT --- $340.20 to $354.95 = $14.75 or (+ 4.34%)Not bad for this week, let's see what next week brings."
"If our NATO allies do increase their defense spending to 2% of their GDP, I would think that they would buy LMT weapon systems and etc. That certainly should boost LMT share price. More sales makes for more profits and increase earnings."
You expert investors please answer this question : how come people want to invest in the stocks don't pay dividend?
"human history has always been filled with war... just wait, someone will have an idea that someone else does not like and then another one will begin."
would like to see the dividend increase. 2.4% isn't cutting it. Would prefer to see around 4%
We need more Putin news

"Well the ""Tulip Mania"" and ""Market Crash Coming"" post are here so that means we are in the right stock. It's a GREAT contrary indicator."
This stock trading at 11 x 2020 earnings and 10x 2021 earnings. Dividend of $11 a share a year. Hello. Of course Cathie bought 50k shares worth 44 MILLION
Another Friday downdraft?
Current administration is wild could shutdown previous administrations projects
waiting for a 340+ close to confirm the uptrendafter hours does not count.
Why is Boeing featured in Barron’s headline article? LMT is the headline and the featured company of the article.Ridiculous
Going down! Going down! And down again. Yoo hoo!
Do you still doubt me Steven. Not there yet but getting closer.
KTOS appears nothing more than acquisition of a small/medium program not likely to impact LMT fundamentals anytime soon. Certainly not equivalent to a line of business and certainly not a business area a la the IS&GS RMT.
"LMT seems to be getting its mojo back. it closed really strong today.If we can get a close over 350 in the next week, this will have a fairly short path to the 380 area.i"
"People are stupid. In a world in which executive don’t show up to work because someone offered them five buck pay raise, you have the decent hard work dedicated management of Lockheed. The CFO resigned - the guy retire and he started a six month process on passing his responsibilities to another manger who worked for the company for ages."
what a wasteland
"Yo Tricky... Did you use the disco or crystal ball to make the predictions? If the drop in price occurs, I will be celebrated and buy more shares.... :)"
Let’s Imagine P/E of 18
If LMT is so GREAT...then why isn't their stock moving up?
"With a split, the dividend will be split too.... That's not good...."
LMT not doing to good today. May be time to dump it.

Sideways was good....
I think more than 50% of the people in this market have no idea what they are doing?
Way off 52 week high. Pathetic.
Fund manager Mike Cuggino was just on CNBC and LMT was one of his top picks going forward. Smart man....you should probably listen to him.
Bull Flag formed on daily chart. This 1 is set to run high if we clear $350 level
Bought 2 call contracts for Jan 21 2022 at 330 strike when LMT was around $330-$335. This will make lots of money thanks to Cathy Woods and LMT being a solid business

"Obviously, this company is now mature, like coca cola, and there is no more room for growth. You’ll have to be content with a roughly 6% annual return from now on. Space is a dead end because ULA is being rendered useless by SpaceX. And most developed countries are already building their own sixth gen fighters, leaving the f35 in the dust."
Welcome Jim!
"Good News/ New Contracts = Stock Decline. Might be a long term hold but I doubt a lot of us will live long enough. If the Robinhood crowd isn't into a non sexy stock it won't happen. Value doesn't seem to matter anymore. So frustrated with this stock. I know as soon as I sell this thing it will shoot up as I hold and watch it crumble . I know ,I know ,you all say sell."
You guys should get this beacuse trumps gonna buy war machines and stuff
Why LMT drops so much today ? Anyone ?
Why the outsized hit on A&D vs. broader large cap market?
As I said yesterday “ Lets Gooooooo!”
"Huge positive for LMT and shows increases in defense spending not the months long SP price deterioration the market was factoring in on imaginary decreases in spending on LMT products WASHINGTON -- The U.S. will bolster its conventional deterrence against China, establishing a network of precision-strike missiles along the so-called first island chain as part of $27.4 billion in spending to be considered for the Indo-Pacific theater over the next six years, Nikkei has learned.They form the core proposals of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative that the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command has submitted to Congress and Nikkei has reviewed.""The greatest danger to the future of the United States continues to be an erosion of conventional deterrence,"" the document said. ""Without a valid and convincing conventional deterrent, China is emboldened to take action in the region and globally to supplant U.S. interests. As the Indo-Pacific's military balance becomes more unfavorable, the U.S. accumulates additional risk that may embolden adversaries to unilaterally attempt to change the status quo."""
Are these people stupid? They should be buying this stock!!!!
I am going to start buying Lockheed Martin again
Sounds like:the kiss of death IMO
Hope the price will go up rocket high on Monday due to the North Korean and South Korean
We need a new CEO.....
"LMT isn’t a “sexy” tech stock and it’s not in a “sexy” industry. Don’t expect a massive gain in a short time span with this stock (especially right now). That being said, it’s a great company with a massive backlog that pays a nice dividend. In 5/10/15+ years this stock will probably be one of the few I currently own still in my long term portfolio and will be fine. Long LMT"
"Has anyone noticed that for the past few wwks, The stock initially each day recoups some of the previous days losses. Then by noon time the stock then losses those gains and losses anotehr 1 -3 percent. this stock has a lot of people and institutions selling their gains made the last several years and realizing that without the company buying back its own stock that this stock is destined for 220 by fiscal year end. then stock will be more attractive for company to buy back"
Hidden problems with F-35...https://www.defensenews.com/smr/hidden-troubles-f35/
"NATO countries along will buy how many F-35s during the next couple/few years? I will not be surprised F-35 will be the main NATO jet fighter force in a year or two. Although I agree that Turkey is not a country to sell to, especially they 'bot' the russian defense system... What a combination!Earning BEAT but stock down 10%+. What a joke!I am going to buy 100 shares for every 1% drop, first couple of orders are in at 319.XX and 318.XX, which may happen on Monday.I am sure pretty soon(something like a couple of weeks), I will have to laugh, perhaps all the way to the bank.Good long term investment too... Very good long term, IMO."
Soon to be $100B company or....exit stage left?
Will this be a good pick after November?
So many people manipulating this board. Don't waste your time even reading this junk
First the UAE and now Bahrain is normalizing relations with Israel. I wonder how many F35's Bahrain will buy?
Anytime a stock drops 35+ points in one week is an extreme cause for alarm no matter how optimistic anyone is.
anyone think it'll hit $419 by end of next week?
Wake up! This is Wall Street! It's all about greedy! About speculating! About gambling! Nothing to do with fundamentals!
This will close above 330 today ...Market will turn around after 2 pm ...lot of buying will come in
"I sold LMT today at $198 and bought The Defense sector ETF ITA. This lessens my exposure, but keeps me in the defense game, which I believe is still undervalued."

Why is this 'thing' going down again? I am really piqued and frustrated.
$260 for LMT share???? What... No way... People will lose money
"Once again, no bad news, only good news. The defense bill that will pass over a possible presidential veto has an extra $1B for additional F35’s for all three services. So tell me why the stock didn’t pop 2-4% this morning instead of falling. Someone, somehow is manipulating this stock."
LMT is better than BA. BA has big civilian business.
"Nice performance, only net declines at Space, but.... the devil is in the details if you caught that."
$LMT - Tutes are buying
I don't get it. What am I missing with LMT stock? Stock buyback and dividend increase. Submarine contract with Australia. Air force contract to build their GPS satellites. Sikorsky Helicopters to Alaska. All that and the stock is going lower.
My gut feeling is the that coming North Korea summit will never be. Someone or something will prevent it.
"this is inverse Gamestop insanity. but I will wait. i wanted to buy at 370, 350, 335, but it keeps gettng cheaper.but i am happy to take a worst case scenario of a 3% div that grows 10% every year.but if this gets to 300, i might take out a home equity loan."
"Shameless shorties are hammering the price even indexes are high. Good job not dumping today, will see tomorrow"
I have been in a DRIP with this stock since 1998. $300 a month until I stopped in 2018. I have no clue what my basis is but I am estimating it to be around $80. Should I sell thinking that this conflict will blow over or should I hold? I can offset most of the LTCG by selling all of that #$%$ GE stock I have bought over the years. Thanks for any advice.

Guys why its showing in red ?

Dividend due on 29 Nov
"Is there anyway to research why entities or bot purchases this stock. Some entities purchase for the long term string of dividends, some for short term gains others hold it for multi-year or decades for a larger payout. Maybe it is just high frequency trading. How do I research the patterns?"

"Recent insider sales, signal or financial logistics?"
LMT has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. Im not sure about you guys but awe.som_sto-cks has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
Unusual to see RTX crushed today but LMT crushing. I’ll take it though.
"Reports: Senate near two-year budget deal with higher defense spending https://seekingalpha.com/news/3328935?source=ansh $LMT, $KTOS, $TDG, $BA, $NOC, $HRS, $RTN, $UTX, $TXT, $LLL, $GD, $FLIR, $COL"
red red red haha. Not afraid to hold this long though
Its a great report and it went down? Seriously?
Why won't this thing go up higher?
"Loading the Boat. If LMT had the same earning/market cap as raytheon, it would be like $580 stock. Load the boat. Bidens a corporate sellout and more warmongering than trump, the military budget will not be touched."
Ripping to 400s
"The following are price targets dated today for Lockheed Martin from the following: Morgan Stanley $373.00, Stifel $400.00 and Standard and Poors (S & P) today has a price target of more than $400.00. Sorry, I didn't write down the S & P number and only recall that it is more than $400.00."
Could someone tell why this stock is down after earnings?
We BEAT! Let’s get this money!
Please drop the price to a lower price to make the share affordable for everyone...
"so when the program is cut back and our boys die in action, who will the republicans blame? obama!"
This stock could use a 4 for 1 split. We need more individuals getting interested in LMT. Right now ETF movements in industrials are more powerful than fundamentals. LMT dropped yesterday as people dump BA and RTX yesterday. Maybe if more individuals owned LMT versus ETFs the stock would move back to the highs. The action yesterday dropping almost $3 after receiving a $64b order was curious as best. I think it is a buy but the stock has acted “weird” since the $399 top of last week.
Looks like the spin-off deal was more than ten-times oversubscribed. Traders who bought LMT and tendered expecting a quick 10% profit will be stuck with 92% of their LMT not getting converted. Those shares will be dumped back on the market as things get sorted out. Anyone interested in buying LMT today may have decided to just wait until the price came down.
MARKET going up up up up up ....morning good negotiation with china and US good luck
sold some here hope it gets through 400
Beware the oncoming debt crunch onslaught.
looks like defense says trump is out
"Think it’s wise to partner with BA in FLRAA, that is, unless there was no other option..."

"LMT is going up just look at the historical graphs, don’t over analyze don’t look at anything else!"
Wow !!!!! Tanking everyday.

Jag you are correct my frien
"if ur not in LMT for the long term your a fool. thing is easily worth 500 if you want to give it a good projection based on P/E and EV/EBITDA. just an opinion, but I have a friend whos husband works for LMT, he cant have his phone on at work. thats some CIA type project shiz. also since we spend more on defense than I think the next ten countries combined, this 3.8bill deal from the gov is just a down payment for bigger projects."
"jack and his friends have more bad news working to ""not leave money on the table"" ConclusionPeople should plan their careers and their finances, enabling them to retire, or at the very least be financially independent, as early as possible. This will ensure they are able to enjoy a longer, happier and more leisurely retirement to age 80 and beyond.Don’t switch off and be idle when you retire. You can still do things that are of interest to you, or you can get involved in things that are of value to your community, all at a pace you feel comfortable with.The flip-side of the coin is that you may have to keep on working very hard and under stress, till age 65, before you retire. In that case and if the actuarial studies of some of the world’s largest Corporations hold true, then the chances are that you would probably die within a few years of retirement."
52 week low
Thought this was dropping back to 330 based on the charts. LOL.

The company has exposure to Department of Defense priority buckets, and consistently executes well. Even if the end market growth rate slows, we expect continued strong fundamentals, with compounding earnings and cash flows."""
The company management and BOD should be ashamed of the stock performance. The stock is DOWN 3% in the past 52 weeks.
Any news from the conference to make this stock go down this much?

"Hey Yahoo! Some of us are very interested in dividend investing. When I first bought LMT, they were yielding $6.60 and their price was well under $180. How about some dividend news? Split? Increase? Hank"
"Bad move by Lockheed Board of Directors. I don’t see what they’re going to get from buying a company whose technology is largely outdated. For me it doesn’t matter because I don’t buy stocks whose CEO is female. Look at their track record, they’re horrible CEOs. In this case both AJRD and LMT have female CEOs￼￼￼￼￼. For all you bleeding heart liberal‘s out there this is not a sexist thing it’s a financial thing. Once again check the performance of female CEOs. They are terrible. ￼￼￼"
There was an article stating that CEOs of major companies are / were buying back shares and then selling the shares. The article actually called it 'insider trading'.

"Redskin is the way Native Americans referred to themselves. They came up with it. They used it. They had no problem with it. Most Native Americans are tolerant and proud that an NFL team would use that name. Unfortunately, people on the left, the people of intolerance and hate, have found the 2 or 3 Native Americans in the country that don't like it, and have made a big issue out of it. Actually, more Natives are mad at Elizabeth Warren, for taking opportunities away from other Native Americans. All the wealth that Warren made due to her false claims, should be given to deserving Native Americans, as reparations."
Added to my LMT today. Will continue to add more if it keeps dropping.
"this is held down by a Biden win. but its so cheap I dont care.payout ratio <40%. I am just going keep the growing div and dont really care about the stock price.at some point, it will hit $500 but not til biden's been in for 2 year."
this company is getting so many contracts. but doesn't shoot up
LMT stock has been good to me over the years. I have no problem waiting and collecting the div.
what a day ... NATO going to increase defense spending. Congrats all. $$$$$$
"I, too, have been looking for at least a 3 for 1 stock split. In addition to the comment on the greater affordability for new investors, there is the added flexibility for selling partial ownership. Many investors have been conditioned to round lot trading, and it would be nice, having 300 shares and being able to sell 100 and still have a round lot. Hank"
"many trump bashers here... woweeeee!!....don't question price? are you stupid or blind?...these defense companies are soaking the public....their businesses are annuitized by you and me ..... overruns from 200 to 400 billion...see what happens if your project has that inefficiencies- or if your project has a customer who just says ok whatever it costs....either way...it is debatable if it's a business or a government entity...culture is similar...taxpayer funded....elite overpaid workforce w sweet pensions....thats what attracts stockholders here... government bloated contracts..... Trump bashers have alot to learn... don't you ever wonder where the money comes from or do you really believe the government( we the people) can pay any price without question for all your needs... it's about time we stop overpaying for the greedy, lazy and bureaucrat fat cats...this costs toooo much!"
"OK....add this one to the list , Switzerland takes in bids to renew their strategic air defenses. Boeing bids $7.6B to supply 40 F18's, LMT bids $6.6B to supply 40 F-35's. Guess who will win the contract??? That's right and you read it here first. GLTA"
Shanahan should be fired for conflict of interest.

Who is the clown that that just got stuck buying at 350
"I have posted here before, please look up my posts. This has happened before back in 2018 - 2019. Where the stock goes up in the morning and before You can say ok we are going to be ok, the stock loses all of its daily gains and posts a 1 - 2 % loss. the Institutions are taking You for a ride. to get rid of the recent gains by taking their profits for their investors and leaving you holding your breath on what to do. They will get back in after they ride the stock to approx 300. this will take approx 2-6 months. these are the institutions that helped the stock go from 275 to 440. You do the math. Lockheed is a good company and will once again return good dividends and approach 500 by 2022. good luck"
"LMT shares have officially ""broken out"" and they are on a tear, flashing on all computers equipped with screeners for breakout situations. It's attracting additional attention, and the algos picked up on it yesterday."
There is no information. Go back to the old format. I want to see who is getting government contracts etc. Analysis's options are not as clear as before. Return to the old format. It contained more information.
"Better close AJRD quickly as there is bipartisan support to tighten antitrust legislation as “lawmakers are looking at setting a higher bar for acquisitions by companies that dominate their markets....” That said, it may take them a few dozen fortnights to get anything at all accomplished besides the initial bickering."

Wrong when we are at 340 at next earnings we shareholders will have lost $14B in value for JT to announce “we returned $2.6 dollars x 277 million shares = thats .7B to our shareholders “ we are supposed to then cheer
Finally rotation!
Yes LMT
even after ARK fund started buying this stock it is still stuck at 300 level. waste stock
Does LMT ever go up? Every day is a red day? No bottom in sight
Earnings report 10/25
Damn... talk about a come back after dropped ER lmao
Trump wants a stealth Boeing F-18. Why?
Market worried about the midterms. Thinking that could really hamstring the useful idiot in the WH.

Hold on ! it will be quite a while before LMT gets back to its all time high. I give it two years. Lots of optimistic people in here.

This is such bull that Lockheed falls 13% in 5 days. There is nothing wrong with the earnings prospects.
"s it true the LMT workforce is largely in the retirement age?On average, seniors still in the workforce predict they won’t fully retire until 72 years old, with over 60% citing financial reasons, according to a recent study by Provision Living. The survey asked 1,032 people between the ages of 65 and 85 who currently work either full-time or part-time."
"yahoo shows the beta as .95, it seems more like -.95.this almost acts like a hedge"
"Has anyone any thoughts on why LMT stock is cratering? A great quarter, good forecast, increased dividends, some contract wins, backlog is increasing, etc. Yet, nothing but red! Losing 3 contracts to Boeing hurt especially when LMT’s Marilyn Hewson says it would of cost LM $5B if we had won while Boeing says it’s a possible $60B in sales. Somebody is rotating out of defense stocks but for what reason."
I remember when this was a $414 pps stock. (not that long ago)
Incredible!...just incredible!..does Marilyn know anything about this?..
Expect another 5-7 drop tomorrow. Those who did the buying on the way up want to take profit before it totally tanks.
"To answer someone who says because we are at peace with North Korea. I copied ut here:I think the house pound this stock is because the Germans and the France announced they are gonna build their own. This may make sense because, after all, F-35 has been about 20 years since the F21 and F22 between BA and LMT. On the other hand, can the Germans and the France really make better fighters? How much are they gonna invest? 10 billions? better multiply by 10 or 20.Back to N. Korea. One does not need advanced jet fighters to do the job in Korea, not even F-18. All one need is something such as C-47 that can throw something like cluster bombs... After all, it's the Koreans business on both side of the 38 parallel, not US."
did anyone exchange LMT for LDOS when they did the spinoff last year? if so have you ever received a dividend froim LDOS added to your account?
LMT reached a 52 Week low at 281.69
LMT is spring loaded with a cup and handle and full out base north of 440 next ten days
Glad I trimmed my position in February when LMT was at 440 a share. what a JOKE
Requiring a high bid today to get Friday's dividend?
LMT currently paying $10.40 per share annual dividend. Can't figure out how to search for companies paying higher dollar amounts per share.
This thing should have been up $30 today lol. Guess we still have room on the downside. I would love some at $240 or so
"LMT is one of the safest stocks out there. I made the mistake of selling mid last year at a nice profit. Bought back a few times including the last time at 320. Stock went down and I was second guessing myself. Well not even my last buy is profitable. Unfortunately, with the world we live in, defense stocks are good investments. Plus LMT pays a decent dividend."
"FM Jake, The CC clearly indicated this is not a ‘space’ company.

Nothing else. Guess thats correct??"

In what Universe should this stock not be at least 25 PE when you have technology companies with PEs in the 40s and 50s. Nevermind Tesla which right now just a mega bubble.
Wonder if the market thinks Biden will win and LMT will get hammered.

The algorithm effectively puts all the elements into a hat; it continually determines the next element by randomly drawing an element from the hat until no elements remain. The algorithm produces an unbiasedpermutation: every permutation is equally likely. The modern version of the algorithm is efficient: it takes time proportional to the number of items being shuffled and shuffles them in place CAPM 降低風險，增加回收率。找會做Baccarat App 的研究生,開發應用軟件。P3+P1+P2 +9% ; Then Banker.If < -9%; Then Player.Probability is the key.Worldwide Master Coach 全球總教練謙卑的心態。Holy Spirit.人生苦短，一季玩一次百家樂，邊賺錢邊遊憩，其樂無窮！好友：楊永樂、蒒維誠、馬英九、盧克修、李蔚華、林子安、汪大衛的故事。恩師：馬鶴淩、張宗良、史正鼎、李金嬋、Chris Chang/Morris Chang、林老弟兄、吳鶴予將軍、徐半仙的往事。活到老學到老的禪修靜音。Lesson and learned.天行建，君子以自強不息日新月異的時代！忘記背後努力面前，向著標竿直跑，為著得到主耶穌的獎賞。耶和華是我的牧者，我實在一無所缺！Amen.敢於挑戰極限的勇氣！發揮人性潛能最大的力量。死而無憾！三財百家樂高級班2017畢業生：Mr. Le in Boston.Ms. Liang in New York.不要忘了買進PME & MDSO.EB5 project is the key to get green card.

Lockheed Martin reached a 52 Week low at 289.00
The president can declare a state of war in which our constitution is under threat
"Retired USN RADM and current Pentagon Press Secretary and Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Spokesman John Kirby sure likes LMT! “The F-35 remains the premier air system of choice for three of the Armed Forces, seven international partners, six foreign military sales customers. It routinely demonstrates high-end capabilities at the hands of our joint and international warfighters, and it’s performing in combat operations from land and from the sea.”"
"Just bought another 100 shares.I will buy another hunder if it drop to -5% today, which is only -0.3% away. Hope it fill ans I will have no regret.It's a $400 stock! All you need is patience. That's all!"
Tension brewing will work out well for LMT and funds to support national security

BA has commercial and defense product. Taiwan bought 30 Apatch attack helicopters. It cost Taiwan more than 1 billion. Taiwan want more but US limits it being afraid to make China angry.
"Still not seeing a reason to start heading up, even with the small Navy contract. The only thing I see in the immediate future that may make this stock ""sexy"" again is if the government starts looking into a long term production contract for that new fighter. Still, hope I'm wrong, I'd really like this stock to be at about $400 by the end of the year (probably not going to happen.)"

However, the fund managers decide to cancel the fund ( in a legally way to steal the investors money)....1. can the fund managers cancel the fund? 2. If the fund would be canceled, can the investors get back their money? Thank you."
"Stay the course, start buying more!!! Don't be a dope and sell."
I honestly think $170 is a possibility
Many low ranking LMT money managers don't deserve high management fee: they should be more aggressive like FANGS stock fund managers.
Wars are good for business
The crash since Nov-30-2020 to current point was the market correction after LMT silently issued 1.78M additional shares to the market around the end of Oct-2020. After a dilution the market will usually correct that over time.
Looking for $358-$360 to add.
"Hmm, LM is tanking on an up day why?"

"@ Jack: You seem to know what you are talking about and in doing so, make sense. Tell me your opinions and knowledge on what holds for the future of LMT stock.

"On a red day, LMT goes down. On a green day, LMT goes down."
Looks like a base is developing. If it holds then we may see some nice gains going forward. People shouldn’t get wrapped up with +/- moves of a few bucks. What really counts is if this base holds that is developing
"CLNE Clean energy fuels is one of the leading provider of CNG and LNG fuels. It’s partners with chevron, Total and now BP. Clean Energy is contracted by the New York MTA, New York Sanitation, UPS, FedX and other companies in the United States and Canada."
totally a buying opportunity. Lockheed is not at all effected by tarrifa. even the steel and aluminium have no real effect because they got contracts in place with their vendors
The tide appears stronger than the news as LMT tracks only slightly better than S&P500

Listened to every word of our leadership at Citi conference. They are just going to play it nice and safe. Nothing to get excited about. Can’t really blame Taiclet I guess. Our company will put $100-200 M in his pocket the next 10 years just like Hewson for just stroking the status quo
Here we go- expect to see a bunch more #$%$ officers bail with the free shares we give them for doing a terrible job. When we shareholders have lost $12 B of value by next earnings we will have to listen to them tell us how they RETURNED $1B to the shareholders this quarter.

Israel approves F-35 jets for UAE. That's VERY good news.
If you wait to buy LMT until a war breaks out then you will miss the boat. Don’t try to predict events like this. Just buy the stock when you think it’s fairly valued.

Ok now that dumpster is out of the way the military can get back to ready ness ready for what Y’All say it’s climate change they been working on since the petroleum industry first wrote about it in the 1970’s!

"9.7% of LMT's revenue is from Asia Pacific Region which include major customers like Japan, S. Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, etc. LMT only has a joint venture with P.R. China on civilian helicopter marketing and services. LMT is not permitted to sell any military gears to China, hence zero revenue or profit from there. If one day China becomes an ally of the US, then one may see weapon sales to China. But by then, there will be no sanction whatsoever on LMT by China. So today's the stock movement of LMT is either an over reaction about China's sanction on LMT or pure ignorance and misunderstanding of LMT's global business."
"after it jumped from 380s to 425s, i thought it would fall back once it is realized war is not going to happen. glad there is no war and and LMT is stuck around lower 400s"

Lets hope this country comes to their senses and midterm elections block these traitors to our constitution and way of life from doing an more damage."
"The exchange offer has a set upper limit of 8.2136 shares of Leidos for each share of LMT. When the offer was made July 11, LMT's last close (July 8) was $251.90 and Leidos $50.59. Subtract $13.64 from Leidos because that's the special dividend to be paid before the merger closes. $251.90 / ($50.59-$13.64) = 6.8173, the number of new Leidos shares that 1 share of LMT was worth. Add the 10% sweetener, you'd get 1.11 x 6.8173 = 7.5672 shares of Leidos. Free money!Of course arbitragers will buy LMT to tender it for the 11% gain (10% discount). But need to be careful because of that 8.2136 share upper limit. Today's closing numbers were LMT $262.54 and Leidos $48.74 (minus $13.64 = $35.10).$262.54 / $35.10 = 7.4798, times 1.11 = 8.3026, which exceeds that upper limit. They'd still get a 9.8% advantage looking at today's prices. (8.2136 / 7.4798 = 1.098)That probably explains the recent very high volume numbers for both companies. Today's trades settle on August 16th (T+3), which is the offer expiration date. No clue how prices will move before then, or immediately afterwards. That's the risk. Tomorrow morning should bring more news on the final numbers. Another wild card is whether enough LMT shares were tendered to soak up all the new Leidos.If not, all LMT shareholders may find themselves with a free pro rata share of the leftovers. That's my understanding of the prospectus. I didn't elect to do anything with my shares."
Slow and steady up climb.
This stock being down this much is a joke. LMT do bigger buys of your own stock.
Seems like the $13.64 special dividend should have been paid to LMT shareholders who got screwed in the deal.
This stock makes no sense.
only 8% ^ until 400... %^)
"Again, low volume, no reason to rise."
LMT forming a base in mid 380s. Slow and steady up will win the race.

It will get better
Nooooo!
Did folks know that LMT is the top microgrid player out there???
added LMT and AMT. Too great dividend stocks at discounts.

Guess some on this thread don't realize the effect that news especially bad news have on stocks etc. Like helicopter that killed Kobe Bryant and 8 others was made by Lockheed Martin. Must add that reports are that it was an old helicopter made in 1990-91. Wonder about maintenance?

Yes!! Buying opportunity I have been waiting for. Thanks!
Finally people are waking up to the glorious opportunity this is. I sleep well every night knowing my dividends hit my account like clockwork
More contracts yet. Going to be an awesome year for making money.

"So, yesterday someone made an unkind comment about ""You mean UP we go? Are you #$%$ or just stupid?"" when I noted that LM was heading down again, on good news, and it remains a bit of a mystery.. So, market is up 400+, LM is down again, on good news. Hmm, guess the answer is ""Look in the mirror, LA""."
I added some down $5 this morning. We will be above $400 by Sept
"LMT, was undervalued for the longest time. People think a democratic president will spend less money on weapons? That never happened in the history of the US. EASILY 400$ per share"
It really deserves to go up to $380 at least.
"After Trump's 100 days honeymoon period is over and things settle down and that he comes to his senses, I think defense stocks will do well. How well ?, well that remains to be seen."

It won't hold above 360 today. Maybe next week....
Thank you morgan stanley
its incredible how much bad news is in the stock right now. Has to be deeply oversold. I would buy gradually as it goes down but in the short term stocks can drop irrationally for extended periods. Trying to recall all the bad news lately. 1. DOD does not approve full scale production of F35 2. LM came up short in F35 production due to Covid3. Sanctions put on by the Chinese government 4. The passing of the Aeronautics EVP5. The enormous deficits can impact defense spending 6. Purchase of rocket company although good strategically long term is an expensive acquisition and acquirers are usually penalized short term. There are more. The stock is a coiled spring ready to be released. Perhaps earnings release will change the sentiment
when will it reach 350

My first time on this board. I've watched this drop from mid 400s and it has peaked my interest. Have they even said a word about the virus slowing down anything that they do? They even just inked that $3+ billion deal with India. I'm thinking this literally could be one of the best bounce back stocks to own after the dust settles.
This should be 400. NO EXCUSES
make this stock fly just like F-35
Sentinel really
only 295 point to go.
what is the least proftable portion of LMT

Now I don’t care about the fundamentals and the lofty promises more than what I can see clearly. That personally for me, keeping money in this is lost opportunity to be in other shares. So selling it all. I bid adieu."
"Today was a day where the buyer started discriminating between the winners and the losers (oil, airlines, cruises). We are clearly on the winner side ...."
"Profit taking, especially as Trump implodes. Expect more pain, lots of gaps seeking backfill between here and 225."
The country needs a new weapon that will gently coddle those who try to fight with or play games with law enforcement. It needs to be soft and gently restraining as for an infant. It has to be safe for those even if they are significantly beyond the toxic dosage of any known drug. Can LMT make such a safe but confining yet non-dangerous law enforcement weapon?
Nikkei popped ~2% overnight. If LMT follows follows suit it’s $400 baby!
F... Man... Why didn't the price of the share drop in the past few days....
We can speculate all we want of why this stock isn't 350 or more. The truth is that this stock has reached its peak.
Making good coin in the options.
Anyone know whose feelings I hurt on my earlier post that got deleted due to lack of free speech in the USA?
Today is dividend payment day.
So NOC goes up after earnings. Are they trying to tell us something lol. I will stick with my LMT
"This is all about the election. if Republicans win more seats or keep as is, LMT will be 30 to 50 points higher from where it is now. if not we will go under 300. There is a full court press by all liberal media, trying to discredit the president because they know if they don't win this midterm and win it convincingly they are in HUGE trouble."
"Barron’s did an article this weekend about space stocks. LMT was among their favorites. With a PE of under 14 while the S&P fetches 22 times, we are talking about LMT trading at potentially a 40 percent discount to fair value. It may take awhile for the capital returns to materialize but that dividend pays me to wait for them. The idea that aerospace and defense will never go back to their heydays again is garbage as far as I’m concerned. Patience is how you make money in this market. Don’t invest in a stock unless you have a really strong conviction in it, and I happen to have that with LMT. It is a leader in its industry as it is. The space potential is just more whipped cream and cherries on the banana split."
DOT&E Report due out in the next 1-2 weeks. The never ending snags with the F-35 will get some bad press and create a dip. Not sure on the other LMT projects that Are reported on too.Trade accordingly.heres the news page for DOT&E. Scroll and see the release date to congress in past years.http://www.dote.osd.mil/news.html
If this goes to 400..then daddy gets a new pair of shoes!!
This stock feels super pinned right now.
"LMT had a really strong third quarter. Check out the charts on the company web site: https://investors.lockheedmartin.com/financial-information/quarterly-resultsBIG increase in EPS. Belgium buying the F-35 (rather than the Eurofighter) is huge. Can't be sure about any Saudi Arabia impact (Trump looks like he will protect SA military sales), but even if there is one, the backlog is large (now $109 billion)."
jack? tricky? where are you?
It seems many people were waiting to step out. Not me though.
To infinity and beyond!
"Getting more contracts everyday while the crazy world gets crazier at the same time. reference China and North Korea to name just a few. What will America do other than ramp up its defense initiatives? Of course this stock is going to be continuing its upward climb. Today is a good opportunity to buy on a low, during a continuously upward climb."
Buying opportunity. Lockheed is really cheap
I just unloaded RTX and put it I’ll in LMT.
Trump can’t think about war or weapons for awhile. BA LMT NOC are in the same boat
Yahoo is showing a PE of 47. Is this correct?
nice up happening today $320.00 today I bet.
Buy now!
Golden cross
Geeze what's the problem today now. Meanwhile NOC keeps going up
This rally has no legs.
Why every thing went down today?
"The F-35 program has a lot of support in congress, but we know that Trump doesn't like it due to the cost. I read an article that said it's cheaper now. How do you guys think this will affect the the future of LMT? http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/03/lockheed-to-announce-85-billion-f-35-order-on-friday-reuters.html"
"War Machine Stox rainin down like ordnance. What happenz when they land?? Boom or bounce...Maybe Cheney to the rescue, only this time Bolton, eh? HAL got a nice run, remember that?"
"I'm thinking it will drop another $5 today. As I've mentioned a number of times, the next resistance level is around $300. Wish I could have found *something* to be happy about in the call/numbers, but I didn't, and from what I've read, even the most fervent cheerleaders on this board didn't either. The ""but, the dividend!"" cry don't cut it. Think we need a new CEO, he's not inspiring *any* confidence with the big boys, and when they flee a stock, small time investors like us should take note."
Singapore decides to buy a few F35 for its next generation of fighter planes for testing
Did anyone here anticipated this 50 points drop that has occurred in the past two weeks? I certainly didn't.

The SEC should investigate and see if any of Trump's buddies bought massive puts or shorted massive calls on Friday.
CNBC Fast Money show one of the final trades was LMT. It was Guy Adami's pick. Says it's going higher.

"Sell in May and go away, or the new normal?"
Just ridin' the rollercoaster. X Date Nov. 30.
That was a quick sell off wow. I’m thinking of adding here!
is it safe yet?
The lull before what exactly? Anyone? Bueller?
"what do I do related the LMT exchange offer, I don't really understand the terms of the deal."
Any Idea of why the price is all over the place both up and down?
It will stay over 300 most likely. Earnings closer then ever
"I agree with Tiktaq. You have to believe that Cathy Woods and her ARK funds have a ""following"". They believe in her and will pour money into her space ETF. LMT does not need this catalyst at their current valuation and a 3% dividend. LMT is going much higher, heck even the analyst that downgraded it yesterday put a $400 price on the shares which was a 20% upside from the $342 price at the time."
"Fidelity via Marketwatch shows "" Lockheed Martin stock price target cut to $312 vs. $370 at JPMorgan"""
We will be going to war soon with China and North Korea. This stock will go up hard-core soon when people start realizing we are heading for another world war. I don't think there will be any nukes involved in this war i think the four major things that will be used in this war will be the following.1. drone strikes 2. satellite spying3.cyber hacking4. media smearing each otherHowever when we inevitably have to go against North Korea to defend South Korea I think it will be mainly missile strikes.China will attack Taiwan and possibly Japan. Russia will be taking land by force while everyone else is focusing there forces on others. I predict that wars will be declared before the end of the year. We are already seeing alliances being formed as we speak with countries around the world investing in missile defense and ramping up armies
who came up with the concept of using the very expensive F-35 for close air support--the LMT sales force? doesn't make a lick of sense.
"I could be wrong, but I think this is still in play and an issue: https://www.investors.com/news/lockheed-stock-f35-testing-delay-pushes-out-full-rate-production-decision/?src=A00220""We are not making progress on a joint simulation environment, integrating the F-35 into it,"" Pentagon acquisition chief Ellen Lord said at the time. Instead of a green light for December 2019, she said it may come in January 2021.The latest delay in full-rate production would weigh on Lockheed's earnings and revenue in 2021. Before the announcement, the stealthy jet's delivery rate was set to jump to more than 170 by 2022 from 121 in 2020.I have some LMT in one account and will be purchasing more soon; I think (hope) it will pop 1st qtr next year."

"With what happens in the world recently, this stock price should go up!"
What more would an investor want?
"Just so you know......this stock follows NOTHING in the market. It trends down then it trends up for a period but will be range bound until there is a significant piece of news ........then it will move $30 in a heartbeat, up or down depending on what the news is. So stop crying about how it's up or down vs the S&P. It's not the S&P."

Hi LMT investors.. I downloaded the 401K calculator to calculate the amount of money I would get in 35 years... The calculator mentioned about the annual savings return... Do I get any interest annually from the 401K contribution? And how do I find out the percentage of the interest? Thank you...
"It might be earnings has leaked, we might se trend reversal after earnings"
If you haven't gone to the LMT website and listened to the webcast of the Baird (virtual) conference you should. I did ......its good news for investors in this company.
400 after earnings?
NO WAY... EARLY MAN BROKE OUT OF GIANT EGG LAID BY WARIOR ANGRY DINOSAUR
"And down we go. Sigh. No amount of good news seems to work on this stock. Mystifies me. If TSLA made that kind of dividend/stock buyback announcement, it would be up 300% at the open......"
nobody wants it anymore
Ugly trading in defense contractors again. Over reaction due to North Korea talk?
LMT is going to test triple support level at about 350. Very likely to rebound from this level to the last resistance at about 377
Highs of the day always seem to be in by 11am my poor LMT. :(
Trump looks very very scared.

Look like this will finally break the 400 ice.
"Lets hope for a profitable and happy new year of 2019. I have written on here the past 5 mo. as I as well as others watched their wealth decline nearly 30 % year over year. I mentioned that it looked like the institutions were selling their profits from the past 5 years. Overall i am hoping for a stable year and maybe a rebound to 280 - 285 by years end, I still see some selling to about 220 over the 1st 5 months of the year. I hope i am wrong, but there are still some profits for the institutions that bought over 5 years ago. A good year will be that this time next year we are past 280 and up near 300. Wishing all my Lockheed brethren a happy new year to all"
Welcome to Trump's economy
What the heck is going on with this stock? Almost a 20% correction. Wouldnt be surprised if your CEO jumps ship

Unbelievable that LMT is up <2% and BA is up >6%....Boeing's financials are a disaster....it's a very strange market right now
Lots of work coming to Lockheed Martin. A hiring frenzy for engineers is in full swing which means a lot of future work is coming.
TRUMP TO PUSH WEAPON SALES FOR LOCKHEED TO ALLIES STARTING IN FEBRUARY. BULLISH. STOCK TO GAP UP 10% ON EARNINGS AND BULLISH FORECAST GOING FORWARD.
What a strong company. Even with negative news it’s still rallying. Long live Lockheed

Why is this POS down today? Why won't it go higher faster?
Is this down today in sympathy with RTX? Makes no sense. RTX is down because it is in the commercial jet business. LMT is pure defense.

Hope we don't lose too much today..... Latest Zack analysis was sobering. Still hoping for $360 by years end so I can get out. Only hope I see for this year is the Aerojet deal is allowed to go through.
What is a good price to buy?
Short now
Why did LMT go down today? I haven't seen any bad news about LMT... quite the opposite...

"This is one area where it's critical that the Federal govt. needs to keep up with our enemies (China and Russia). If it takes money to accomplish that, we need to spend it.

"Every major US international war (ex-Afghanistan, Iraq) has been started by a liberal.

"I'd love to jump for joy on this initial $9.50 pop, but I'll be happy to see it hang onto half of it..... Still, one of my models is saying that we may be ""bouncing"" off of the $350 support, and that we could eek our way up to $380 by the end of the year.... I'll ignore the one that says we can fall to about $300, that would be truly depressing. GLTL"
I love the new CEO! He did great things at AMT...glad to have him steering the ship
"So another defense rival was listening onto Trump's conversation with the Pentagon about the F-35s program. And this is another glaring example of Trump's incompetence, inexperience, and lack of diplomacy."
"To split or not to split, is that the question? A split would seem counterintuitive given management has been employing large amounts of cash to reduce the number of shares. In days of old I thought a primary reason supporting a split was to lower the per share price so the stock becomes more affordable/attractive to some investors. Present day and $300/share doesn't seem like a big deal at all.Thoughts?"
"OK here are my predictions for LMT tomorrow. The analyst have them at $6.41 EPS on $16.92B revenue. I have them at $6.68 EPS and $17.2B revenue. They will raise 2021 guidance. Dividend stays the same as it was just increased. Already added to the share buyback last quarter so the surprise could be adding even more to the buyback. What the stock will do is ""anyones guess""."
"This is just a long drawn out shakeout, it happens all the time with different stocks that have proven earnings. LMT chart analysis is coiling a spring and it’s almost loaded when all the selling stops the big investors come in and release the trigger. LMT IS A FAVORITE DIVIDENDS PLAY"
"No, back to sleep. I wished Ark would dump this already, I’m tired of my stock propping up their stupid fund"
"Apparently this thing just broke the 200 exponential moving average, whatever that is, and will gap down."
I think LMT will lose momentum due to general market conditions reflecting uncertainty on future US international trade mostly related with China and its allieds like Russia.

Same song and I forget how many verses. Stock goes up $3-$4 in the morning and falls negative in the afternoon. Just doesn’t make sense unless someone has figured out how to manipulate the price to their advantage and hurt all of us long term holders.
Headed to 400
Doesn’t take much now does it?
We will continue to see big drops and big increases for a long time (up and down or volatility). This will be the normal trend.The average person cannot afford to buy LMT shares at these high prices but the big guys (short termers and day traders) can and will. This stock needs to split so the average person can buy at a lower price and then we will see the share price go up to 350 - 400 range.

"I am not trolling the people on here, but I don't think LMT stock will go as high as we hope it will. It looks like the stock market is heading towards a bear market that it will also drag LMT stock down. I hope that I am wrong."
Another unwarranted drop.

In the short-term LMT does not seem to be like a good trade. Im not sure about you guys but awesome-STOCKS has provided me with some pretty good trade ideas. I messed up executing some of them but thats on me.
Same chart pattern day after day.
"New $1B contract win for precision fired rockets. When the contract awards have dollar amounts that begin with a ""B"" the markets take notice, and you should too. GLTA"
"WAIT FOR IT??? $300,000,000,00 deal coming.."
"Once again, large moves with absolutely no news anywhere."
Biden will cut the defense budget all the defense companies will be cut in half
"Slow, but lmt is on technical upward trend for sure. A solid q1 results could send it into $400s, where it should be for is comparatively certainty performance (like jnj)."
Where is the 3 to 1 split?
what is driving this spike?
Funny. Cat and BA missed by a mile and they are green. LMT closed red yesterday despite a very nice beat. The company provided conservative guidance for 2020 and we got hit. Cash flow @$7.2b and sales increasing 5 percent. People were modeling $7.6b in cash flow and sales increases by @6 percent. Personally think the quarter was amazing. Has this stock gone up too much and now it needs to consolidated @$370? I do not know but the action after earnings is disappointing. Hoping for a reversal today and some analyst support.
Yo Angelo. China tension doesn't help LMT. Doesn't help America GDP period.. Ya fool

"BETHESDA, Md., June 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) board of directors has authorized a third quarter 2018 dividend of $2.00 per share. The dividend is payable on Sept. 28, 2018, to holders of record as of the close of business on Sept. 4, 2018.Expect LMT to increase its dividend to $2.20 for Q4. Should announce his at the end of September."
is lochmar buying into cvu? someone is. up 12% on FIVE TIMES normal volume. at $8 a share it's a natural buyout for anyone building mil aircraft.

This guy Trump will cause mayhem throughout the business world and the republican leaders will attempt to have this guy impeach.

What a DOG this has been!!! ZERO profits for over a year and only DROPPING more! Lots of BAG HOLDERs on this one. LOL! What a joke. Only fools bought this over $300. Fair value closer to $200.
Y'all see that form 4? Attorney was given Phantom shares. This is the Second one. People are being rewarded Bigly for all these Contracts being Awarded. 
RBC adjust target from $405 to $415. Keeps neutral rating.
What is going on with Lockheed?? Did they get them mixed up again with Boeing??? Getting contracts left and right.
Another drop yesterday.I am getting tired of these so called experts saying this stock will go higher and etc.and etc.and etc. Two weeks ago it dropped 20 points in two days !!!
Sell Boeing buy Lockheed
Hope the price will drop to $250 per share
"Sold other stocks bought today more LMT 3,2% div , sleep at night and secured profit ! Does someone can found more secure stock ? Someone can found better company for 2020 in regards to Numbers ? Someone can found better company with secure orders for the next 2 years ? Someone can found a company with better clients ? Answer is NO !"
What are the catalysts on the way?
"LMT sure looks like a US govt bond proxy but with an actual yield. As such,seriously undervalued."
This POS stock is down again. It needs to go up. Not down.
"So, it looks like the problem is that any good news makes this stock go down...."
What is it that the big boys know that we don't?
LMT has good balance sheet. why doesn't the stock go beyond 400? It went in the year 2019 briefly. what is holding back this stock.
we lost trainer TX . 9.2 bil
Expect a YUGE order from the UAE in the coming weeks...
"Trump is ignorant, the total life cycle costs of replacing and maintaining 5 airframes used by US and Foreign services would have been 10x the cost of F35, this bird does it all at one 10th of the cost based on historical procurements. The only issue here is you are looking at one big number instead of five little numbers. Cheaper by the dozen works, Govt stalling on increased production quantities has doubled the cost to the tax payer. Fix the mismanagement at the Pentagon an get the 30% discount by quantity."
Ouch
Time for stock to split!!!!!!!
"If there would be a split 1 share becomes 3 shares, how long it will take for LMT gets to the dividend that we have right now?"
thumbs up if you hate bots.
Do we have enough LMT weapons to combat china? 2021.
"You guys had it good, the last 16 plus years. Bush and Cheney from Texas, and connected to LMT board. Obama just went with the flow of the f-35. Cutting funds for other projects, and giving it to lmt/f35. F35, Ive been saying it for years is not worth the money that we spent on this little one engine, no range, two bombs and two missle carrying money sucking vaccum aircraft. Enjoy your profits now. Lmt never pays late fines to the government. Boeing, gets fined for everything., Late one day on 767 tanker, bam 1 billion dollar fine. It is simply not fair. Tables are finally turning on lmt. Argue with the facts, complain, whatever, tables are turning. Lmt lobbyist will have o effect on the new administration."
"up today, tomorrow, the next day and the day after that"
LMT.....be the lead here. Bring your excellence to bear.
Decided to a add a little at $353.57.
"so far so good. No panic, however it is touch when you are an older investor. 10 Months ago stock at 345. 2 months later stock was at 260, loss of 25 % in just 8 weeks. that was a tough two months. However, we were rewarded if we stayed the course. for all that stayed the course, congratulations. at 370 last week, we have earned near 10 % growth and several dividends. Here is hoping for another 10 % gain over the next 10 months. that would put us at 405 by next memorial Day and several more dividends. Good luck to one and all."
I am not going to respond to this idiot anymore. everyone else should do the same.the idea he is against the military that fights for even someone as dumb as him and he cant even support them? what a total loserjoel22 minutes ago@kevin who is that really cares about our military personnel?
Wow down over $9 pre-market. Those earnings were a bit of a disappointment. How far do we pullback? $250
"sold for a minor loss, way too frustrating opportunities elsewhere"
Some AH buying going on.
This stock belongs above $400 enjoy the ride up !
This may be the best company and corresponding stock price in the market. Its holding up very well. Just hold this one and add if the market falls apart.
Maybe LMT not going up and over 400 is a good thing right now. Gives me time to get more shares cheap.
Loose hand shake out today
you know whats wonderful about that republican senate....alot of defense spending if Biden wants anything
"We need NK to start getting all sihtty again, it's killing sales in the area."

Our LMT troops hold well in this volatile markets. Tip my hat to those LMT money managers who fighted to last bullet yesterday!
"Bloomberg Business ranked Boeing’s Voluntary Investment Plan (VIP) second among large companies’ 401(k) plans in its new 401(k) rankings.According to Bloomberg, “401(k) plans have replaced pensions as the way most companies help employees save for retirement. Workers make before-tax contributions and pile up tax-deferred cash, and employers often match part of what they put in. But some plans are more generous than others.”Boeing provides a 75 percent match on the first 8 percent of base pay that most nonunion employees save in their VIP accounts. Only five companies on the list offer a higher matching contribution. New hires are automatically enrolled in the VIP at 4 percent of base pay. Unless they make a change or opt out, this rate automatically increases by 1 percent each April until they are saving 8 percent of base pay and receiving the full Boeing match.Bloomberg’s scoring was based on matching contributions, additional company contributions, investment features, vesting and automatic enrollment. The maximum potential match represented half of the score.The study looked at the 50 largest companies in the S&P 500 and used 2013 data, the most recent information publicly available.

Earnings will be great.
TIME TO BUY!!!
This is starting to look like Boeing stock after it hit 440.
lot of passive money will soon go here. 5% of space etf is lmt. This could be around 1billions inflow into LMT.
good point to buy
Looks like a down day.... sigh.
Has there been some love lost between the Donald and LMT?
"I would like to see LMT focus on developing serious defensive systems. How can we stop a missile headed our way - even better, can we stop it and turn it around toward its point of origin? In my view, the world now has so many nukes that it's just a question of time before we blow ourselves up. Why not focus on ways to stop that from happening? If LMT could come up with a way to make firing off a nuke a losing proposition, that would be a huge step forward for humanity."
this stock should be higher...much higher !

"What percent of my Federal tax dollars are spent at LMT? Trying to figure whether I spend more at Costco. Happily holding shares of both, perhaps equivalent in value to my share of the $28 trillion National Debt, which if distributed evenly over what the IRS says are 160 million US households, comes to $175,000 each. I suspect the ""fair share"" debt distribution would be more proportional to how much each of us pays in taxes, so my share is at least twice that much, given that half the households pay next to nothing."
"It’s easy to figure out the sentiment on 1-minute chart. Every pull up has much less volume than every drop, it means a way to dump at higher price than buying at lower price. Keep dropping, baby, I will hold you at $300"

$365 this week
Is there any hope for LMT? I bought the stock @$365. Rode it once to $340 and back above $400. I just do not understand this stock trading at $357. What is goi g to reverse the down trend? Do we need the large order to UAE? I fail to understand why people keep selling this stock relentlessly.
sounds like they need more missile defense systems in oil fields and other strategic areas.
Here we go..down the toilet bowl. I knew it. I knew it.
"The price action is ridiculous. Such a solid, inexpensive stock. All good news, almost everyday, including a sustainment contract today. Defence bill, etc. This should be trading at $400+. The shorts/hedge funds should be investigated."
The Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition is huge. Rocketdyne shareholders approved the acquisition 2 days ago. LMT share price doesn't have much longer to be at these levels. This stock is cheap and the dividend a nice source of income. The synergies created by this acquisition should be more than beneficial to helping the share price climb back to the highs.
I see LMT back to 180 in days! within 80 days

Sound like no war....Boo!.....stock down.

I was looking at LMT’s share buyback history and it doesn’t show a buyback yet as there should have been one at the close of 4Q20 December 30th. Did they not do a buy back for this quarter? Or will one be done this week?
Read article today in Breaking Defense on if you do not think F 35 was botched by LMT. There is much more info out there. Do your own research. Who is to blame but those in charge? Also check out annual LMT meeting last Thurs to see what we are paying our leadership.
"LMT seems to misunderstand human language. When most people here say ""Bull"", LMT spells ""bear"". I could not believe that LMT could hit this record low. Nice!"

What the heck is going on?
Don't be out of this stock when the SEC OK's Cathie Woods ARKX space ETF. The Reddit crowd is following her now and they are going to bid ARKX way up which means Cathie will have to buy a lot of LMT.
Nice move today.
We lost the $9.2B jet trainer contract and we lost the $2.4B helicopter contract. But we won the $1.4B satellite and the $3.5B army training & simulation deals. The jet trainer would be nice but it's pretty small next to F-35 which is ramping up nicely. With an announced stock repurchase of an additional $1B the EPS will increase. Still pretty positive.
All these spam posts about the stock being a bubble? LMT is very undervalued though. Been holding since $260.

Well 2 years ago it was BA or LMT.... Both had similar value and similiar dividends....Boeing's liability and relationship with commercial aircraft really burned them. Lockheed realized decades ago that workng governments carried far less liability and more profit.I purchased 500 at 56 about 16 years ago.Been riding the horse. Wish I' d purchased more.

Effective Jan. 1, 2021, FedEx Corp. will implement a new 401(k) plan for its U.S.-based employees that will have an up to 8% employer match across all of its operating companies. ..."
The industry is out of favor right now. Players in the space are looking at BA which right now is more of a defense play with a commercial option. LMT is a good long term play but there will be some trading range riding.
buy now and you will be happy that u did ...it will be back to 325+ today

"LMT kept dropping part of the reason was due to ""shorting"". Those do ""short selling"" actually borrowing your shares and sell them on the market which creating a tempporary dillution in outstandings volume, and price will drop. Short sellers profit from the loss of long sellers (buy and hold). You should avoid short sellers from borrowing your shares by set a high sell price for all of your shares so that brokers can't use your shares for lending."
1 month chart looking good. hopefully the tide has turned.
Good day. Ironic it was Boeing that propped up the market today.
"Oh I forgot...today is May 1st, the beginning of 'SELL IN MAY, GO AWAY' month. Well folks, this is not good news for LMT stock. I guess we will have to wait until October for it to go back up again, if it ever goes back up again."
Was stock buyback at $350/share a good use of cash flow? It was if your management incentive plan had a specific stock price target
Trump spending huge on military will take this stock to $400 by end of year
People like steven don't have a clue. He thinks LMT is only going to go down more. LMT has bottomed out for awhile. Also those who say the Aerojet Rocketdyne merger won't be approved and that it won't help the shares rise in price long term are also full of it. The shareholders wouldn't have approved the buyout if they thought it wasn't going to get approved. This will cut through the red tape easily. The time to be a bear on this name has passed. The economy is reopening. That should aid the aerospace and defense companies greatly. LMT is dirt cheap at these levels...those who say it will never go up again don't understand the business. This is a great company and with a great CEO and it will be rewarded for that over the long term. Those who say it is a value trap don't understand where the stock used to trade and the implications of a fully functioning economy. They also don't understand that when interest rates are going up and inflation happens that value stocks like LMT are the places you want to be. I don't have time to explain investing 101 to people who don't want to know about it and instead stick to their own dysfunctional thinking. You will regret not buying LMT at these levels later this year.
where the hell is the SEC?

I’m all in on LMT. I sold all my other holdings and only will hold LMT. Time and time again it beats earnings and is always undervalued. The dividend is a major plus to reinvest for more shares.
"Dont worry about the recent drops, it will resume its flight to above 400$ soon enough. meanwhile this is just a opportunity to buy more :D"

Trump's push back on the expensive 747 under construction for the white house. Trump has previously commented on LMT's F-35 program as being way to expensive. LMT could be Trump's next focus to give a beating on cost over runs. This project is truly out of control...

"Nearly 10,000 Workers Sue Chipotle for Wage TheftNearly 10,000 former and current workers at Chipotle (CMG) have banded together to sue the Mexican fast-food chain for unpaid wages they claim were accrued when they worked unpaid extra hours or ""off the clock."" According to CNNMoney, this practice is considered wage theft and it supposedly occurred at Chipotle locations throughout the United States.Chipotle denies the allegation, saying the case has no merit and that the chain pays its employees all owed wages.The lawsuit, known as Turner v. Chipotle, states that ""Chipotle routinely requires hourly restaurant employees to punch out, and then continue working until they are given permission to leave.""The lawsuit is named after a former Chipotle manager ""who claims she had to work without pay and was told to make workers under her do the same in order to meet budget goals,"" according to CNNMoney.The chain has been hit with similar lawsuits in the past, but this one is noteworthy because of the high number of plaintiffs. CNNMoney reported that as of last Friday, the lawsuit has attracted 9,961 current and former workers."
"I am not a stock market or finance expert, I know enough to get by, but my gut feeling is that LMT will not go up to its all time high for the next five years. And also, I feel that we are, indeed, heading for a recession very soon. Ever since the dawn of this century, America has been going downhill, but this is just my opinion. In fact, the years 2001 to 2010 has been called one of the worst decades in American history. By the way, I am a proud American."

"Hmmm, according to Investorplace, analysts expect LMT's earnings to be $12.87/share, and the company expects $12.25-$12.55. Now, given that they pay out dividends of $7.28/year, that would mean that analysts predict the company will pay 56.56% of earnings as dividends, whereas the company predicts from 59.47% - 58% payout of earnings. I believe the company has been paying out closer to 60% of their earnings, so I'd hedge my bet that they'll be closer to the $12.40/share earnings.In either case, $728/year in dividends (for 100 shares obviously) plus any stock appreciation seems worth it to me."
Hey....who makes the B61-12 ?
This is a long term investment. In 12 months there will be 500$
LMT is just so adorable for long-term investors... It is stable and the dividend is also decent.
I wonder if this is just shorts jumping in after the dividend￼
All of the spending is paying off as we hit mid-cycle for the sector and carries LMT through 2020.Trump's re-election should also provide a big boost.
"Boy, The more you read about F35 the angrier it makes you towards this companies leadership the last 5 years"
The biggest mistake was selection of F22 over F23. That led to a bigger mistake- F35.
Is Lockheed preparing to abandon California? Imagine what that could do for earnings by relocating one of the least friendly states to a more friendly state.I just read where 600 jobs are leaving the state.
"someone delete my post, I already lost 10 days about 2000$, only 100 shares. I do not believe who control this lmt price, I do not belive who has so rich, he/she can continue lost from 378/per shr drop to 200/per shr befor 09/2020."

"And there you have it. LMT, the best defense company in the world and the friendliest company to its shareholders."
"Great news , mkt is up and this is going down ??? doesn't make any sense other than manipulations"
LMT is the best free-fall stock in the world.
"If the stock market crash, but we still have the shares and company LMT still makes money from selling weapons, how do we lose monet?"
LMT is good.......but it ain't no Tesla. Boy I am raking it in!

"So, up today by $6, and the news is sorta bad (lost the 2.4 billion dollar helicopter contract), um, why? or Huh? Does that mean it will be down $20 tomorrow on really good news like the Pentagon wants 500 more F35's?"
"8b deal is just a part of the game, not final yet."

Is it true that LMT no longer has retirement for its employees?
"Sikorski firing on all cylinders with CH-53K, Marine One/VH-92A and CRH."

"anyone know why lockheed employees work until they are in their 70s? if not, they look for a new job when they are in their 60s rather then retire? Lockheed has the oldest workforce in the country, it is sad that people are not educated on a plan and work until they drop"
This stocks not down. It’s just leading from behind. America 1st is no more. Lol!
I communicated the news on LMT twice today. Deleted both times.
When people lie on here. Smh. It's stupid. Lol
I run out of the symbols... I have about 5 or 6 companies
I love the smell of money in the morning    
"FYI.....3/25 close of $161.14 is the highest close since December4, 2020. Trend is very good."

Key figures from LMT earnings http://alph.st/bb3d996c
Don’t get too excited smells like another close in 340s even 339s
LMT up considerably from when I first noted the cheapness of this name. This should only go higher over the long haul due to both space and aerospace demand. And the dividend is ample enough to put money in my pocket in addition to the capital gains rolling in. This is a fantastic company and a leader of its industry. The market always rewards great companies over the long haul.
"With the volume being what it is, someone big is rotating out of this stock."

I suspect recent announcements of withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan may have disproportionateeffect on A&D stocks
"Clicked Yahoo summary page for dozens of stocks and majority show ""overvalued"". Some say ""near fair value"". Lockheed and Bank of America are the only issues I've found that Yahoo rates as ""undervalued"". Random number generator?"
"Since recent earnings, LMT cash flow/ Ebitda fair value is around 410. It was 416 last q. Taiwan, Ukraine, and multiple smaller nations are feeling tense with big dawgs starting to show their ""manifest destiny"" hand in their respective geographic areas.It is a horrible situation these democracies are facing, Lockheed will definitely help to protect these nations. Hoping for the best for them to peacefully ease the situations.Either way, lockheed will need to produce their products to sustain these nations need for protection."
Can't help but notice Mr. Trumps personnel jet is powered by Rolls Royce engines. So is that making America great again and keeping jobs in the US of A?

I do not understand why defense stock drops so drastically. There is a an actual threat of a 'physical' war with China over tariffs and the sanctions with Russia. China and Russia are arming themselves with new weapons while we do nothing. Countries are increasing their defenses for possible war. I can understand why the Dow and S & P are dropping but not defense stock. What is going on with defense stock? I am really perplexed.
maybe a good time to buy LMT now the price has stabilized for 1 month

So much for MS downgrade BUY
"That's it for LMT for the foreseeable future. I figure this stock is destined to hit $200 before she settles in for a good while. The way ""THE DONALD"" is going he will be impeached before the end of his first term. This guy is out of control with his tweets. I am shocked that he is not been reigned in so far....and to think he isn't in the oval office yet. Unreal"

"A day does not go by that I think of my grandfather who passed away in 1969. He was an investor who experienced in his lifetime man's first flight and a man landing on the moon. Thinking space would present a future investment opportunity he bought 200 shares of Martin Marietta for $5,136. In 1995 Lockheed acquired MM becoming Lockheed Martin and back in 1995 the share price was $25. Over the 49 years since initially purchased, with splits and dividends reinvested into more stock the initial 200 shares have grown to over 4,100 with a value of nearly 1.2 million dollars. Thank you grandpa!"

"I gave up.... best of luck to the long term holders.... I do not understand it but it just go down every day, every week. No good news matters. FCF does not matter. Dividend does not matter. Buyback does not matter."

"S&P Global/CFRA Research —> STRONG BUY on $LMT —> Key Excerpts: << LMT plans to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne in H2 2021 for $4.4B. This firm supplies propulsion systems for many LMT aerospace products, and vertically integrating it will improve LMT efficiency, in our view. >> ... << Our Strong Buy opinion reflects a healthy outlook for LMT’s Defense businesses and an attractive valuation. As of early February, shares traded at 12x consensus 2022 EPS estimate, 33% below their 5-year forward P/E average, despite strong trailing and forward forecast EPS growth of 12% and 8%, respectively. This steep discount is being driven by fear of Defense spending cuts under new Democratic governance, in our view. But in fact, LMT grew earnings in 2009-11, after Democrats swept the 2008 elections amid surging Federal deficits; and did the same in 2012-2015, when bipartisan legislation reduced Defense spending by 4% annually. >>"
Thank you Rich at heart for your reply
"LMT is about as Wide Moat of a Stock that can exist. It simply has a current Monopoly on 5th Gen Aircraft, Hypersonic Tech, Certain helicopters. It will also be one of the dominant players in Space.

10% increase in dividend and another 2 billion in share buy back. Forget about splits if the are stll buying back shares. This is indicating a higher stock price is coming.
I really think that the comment 'the need for military might is too strong' has been misunderstood and taken out of context by a lot of people. I wish it was phrased in a different way. Ever since that comment came out this stock has taken a deep dive.

Manipulation is occuring at a severe rate and in my opinion it needs to be investigated very closely. We have a right to know why a stock goes down when everything is pointing up. Imagine this : an elite club coming into the market and leaving the market at the same time. Once this stock drops to 280 or so I think those elite investors will raise it all the way up to 380. It's clear something illegal is going on. The above is my best guess."
This stock should be sky rocketing to $350.00
"On May 14 2020, there were 20 large trades of between 390k and 500kshares of stock between the hours of 12:30 and 2:30. What was happening? Perhaps some large mutual fund was selling to another mutual fund?"
"Sell on the bad news, buy or panic on the horrible news.

"LMT is going to do well if Trump wins presidency in November; However, if Biden wins by mail in ballots (one method of cheating), locking down of businesses, schools and blaming on Trump for Covid-19 epidemics.

is yahoo finance reporting earnings incorrectly? I'm getting conflicting reports
Jeff Kilberg of KKM was asked on CNBC what stocks he liked. He likes LMT......says it's going higher. Nice to hear it from someone who is a Wall St veteran.
I see this has just become a place for methed out tds idiots to post lame spam
HEADING UP!
LMT is as safe as it gets in a pandemic. Biden or Trump victory doesn’t matter and you get paid a nice dividend
Must be Friday...
Will we use LMT weapons in China or Russia first?
will it hit 300?
HOUSE OF PAIN!
"b. Wondering why LMT down? November IHS rating dropped to ‘neutral’ from ‘positive’ due to creditworthiness, based on credit default swaps spiking to 10% (from 2%) early October. That’s when LMT started dropping from $350. (CDS is insurance against bond default – 10% rate means insurance costs $10 for each $100 in bonds). The bond market is talking, and equity market reacted. LMT debt and CDS rate not in line with competitors. Since Oct, default insurance rate rose to 20%!"
Idiots!!! It's just like the flu.
Obviously this earnings report has not changed market sentiment. However I still believe that FV on this is $450. Forward earnings guidance just reiterates the argument that the stock is undervalued￼!
D spending going great - obvious sell signal!

F18 Top Gun trailer has been released
Very solid quarter! Go to their website and read the report. Most significant is their increased guidance and increased backlog. Pension contribution of $2.0 billion was a drag on cash. This was predicted last quarter. Increased yearly guidance on cash from 3.0 to 3.3 billion is big. Will listen to the conference call for more nuance.
I love it... Great date 11/28/2017
I voted for Trump and I am invested in LMT. Trump has every intention to make this country strong again. He wants to be smart with the spending and budget to know what the country is getting based on what will be paid for. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I have absolutely no worry about the temporary push back of LMT stock price. Trump will make sure our defense department receive healthy budget so we will have the most high tech weapon technologies like we used to. America slows down with the growth for its weapon technologies for many years now. It will change as soon as Trump is in charge.
Boeing at 375pps still has Lockheed's number.
Now Qatar has requested the purchase of F-35's from LMT. The report did not say how many . Concerns that we would anger Saudi Arabia and Israel if allowed to go thru. We will see. Maybe they can find a work around.
And here comes the selling. Just when you think you were out of the woods lol

"LMT seems to be down due to reduced free cash flow (from super high levels) and a general downturn in defense stocks. Remember, the F-35 program is still on the front end of a steep growth curve (it will be HUGE) and LMT has increased its Q4 dividend by 10% or more for over 10 years. Be patient."

The sales only account for 2% of their total revenue. The media loves to blow smoke."

Good long term value investment?
"Absolutely no reason for the stock to be down as much as it is. As I’ve said before, somehow/someone is manipulating the stock down. And, doing a really good job of it. LMT management is doing nothing to promote the value of the company and put on a full court press to solve all the F35 issues so the plane can be certified for full production."
"SpaceX just sent an earthquake in to the space business. I wonder how many of SpaceX employees came from the likes of Boeing, Northrop, and Lockheed."

"Perserverance recently took off for Mars. And William Shatner was kind of like a spokesman, having a conference, and also having a long conversation with someone in the Space Station. Sadly, Bill kept talking about the fear, and the dangers involved. yet on his show decades ago, he put his life, crew and ship in danger, whenever they ran into something new. Hey Bill. There is danger. There will be accidents. Do we all stay off the interstate ? Do we all stop stepping into the bathtub ? IAnd are we not concerned what scientists plan to do, to make MArs more habitable ? We've almost ruined Earth, and now scientists want to pollute Mars with tons of CO2, to warm the planet. Thats what we should be talking about."
Close above $390. Come on baby!
LMT UNDERVALUED? lets see Boeing mkt cap 153.84 Billion. Boeing 2020 earnings -11.87 billion. LMT mkt cap 97.83 billion. LMT 2020 earnings 6.83 billion. Realizing the only way to screw brainless hedgefunds that short valuable LMT is to buy MORE LMT. = priceless

For all those who sold....I have no tears for you. will it go doqn tomorrow?.....Most likely but not by much.
I am a expecting a big drop today and afterwards due to the loss of the TX contract. Brace yourselves.
Why isn't this stock going through the roof? Great earnings and great news on every front. Now we've won the Belgium fighter jet order for the Eurofighter on price and a huge Sikorsky $717 million dollar order? This stock is being manipulated BIG TIME!
But why is it going down today?
lmt is not cheap get what you pay for great blue chip company.
"This #$%$ will negative by 2pm, same old song and dance"
"New orders for a fleet of jets by all allies. Meanwhile Joe woke up today and said, “who did we bomb”. Our national security and those of our allies requires Joe to sell the F35 so we can actively coordinate defense and aggressions agains those that mean us harm. Kamalatoe and Joe aren’t awake"
I think this looks very oversold. Solid company with good financials. Got a buy order in for Monday.
Looks pricey. Sell.
"1/5 2021---LMT gets another $5B new win from the DoD. Eventually Wall Street will notice, probably at the next earnings repot."
Let's hope the Senate sticks to its guns and doesn't allow the sale of $10m of F35s to Turkey. It mostly a Muslim country with a dictator and he's been buying military equipment from non-Nato Russia. Not exactly a good ally to sell military equipment too!
Anyone remember what happened when Reagan pushed star wars then Clinton got in office? Defense stocks cratered. It can happen again. Proceed with caution.

"I saw that (@LA) is upbeat and was able to buy 500 shares the other day. Must be nice to have 200K hanging around. Not sure why he wouldnt invest that in TESLA. I agree with GPSIIR that unless you got in at the price range of 200$ a while ago, there is no reason to sink 200K into this stock at this price. Good luck to all, We are in strange times. This stock will continue to have a range of 320 - 410 for the next 8 - 16 months, So unless a day trader, i do not see any gains in this stock unless a long holder and a dividend reinvestor,"
GO TRUMP!!!!!!!!!!
Lockheed Martin won't be affected by this new tariff plan.
I hope LMT is working on something terrific that will keep us way ahead of China and the Russians. Cyber is a real problem for the US.
China OWNS LMT.

Remember how Lockheed got a contract extension with Canada?
@ Stefanos... You must be a a long time investor in LMT

Question for all you long time LMT folks. I’ve been slowly buying since 370 on down. Any idea of what the bottom is. Every time I think we’ve bottomed out lmt goes lower. Thanks.
Good to have a little green in the sea of red
Low volume under 320 today.
"Boeing, Northrop, Raytheon, going down, down and down further."

Any predictions for Tuesday July 24th regarding LMT announcement?
Glad I got in a few week ago at $301 - $305 and SOLD @ $315. Feel bad for the suckers that bought @$325+ and are riding the slide down! I’d only buy back in @$250 now. There is a viewing nothing good on the horizon for Lockheed in the near-term future. These are just the facts

Buying today!
A split is better because the share price seems low but in the long run... Every one has more money in the share price and dividend return because every earning will be at least double....
$LMT to $NOC ratio seems low.. both great companies though and bullish on both.

I like this around $300 as an entry point right now.
t is time for us to REALIZE that China is no longer a North Korean like archaic entity that rose from the IXX Century but rather FORMIDABLE foe that is galloping into the XXI. LMT can't hold a candle to them.

Buy more LMT!
bouncing between 380 -390 now
"If lmt raises its guidance even just a bit in Q1 release, I think the stock has the momentum to move toward $450 before June. It has been a lagger in this overpriced market even though it delivered during covid."
This stock is starting to scare the blazing a out of me. Have contracts been bid too aggressively?
If Lockheed sees SpaceX as a threat then Lockheed needs to put a mirror in front of them and ask themselves why. SpaceX has recruited the best talent from all the aerospace companies. Could it be Lockheed fails to recognize their real talented employees? The silos of the good old boy network needs to be broken down.
Its up but no reason why

and they laughed at me when I said sell at $350.
$350 buy this week
"@ Jack - I hope that you are right that a base might be forming somewhere in the low 300s. And that is my gut feeling. I think it will go sideways for a while but I have no gut feeling when it will begin pushing upwards LOL. I respect all of your other comments. You seem to know what you are talking about, thus making sense."
400 ? Be careful what you wish for.
Wow why is this great stock down. Japan is about to sign a 8 billion dollar deal for the F-35 and we are down? Makes zero sense.

Have you guys ever seen any stock in history with an RSI this high on the Daily over this amount of time and not pullback? I'm very surprised this stock has yet to pull back to the $370 range yet. Next week will be its true test if there is no LMT or NOC news
"Thoughts, it seems way undervalued according to the Financials they have 144 billion on the books of future business and pay a big dividend. ￼Or is everyone just laser focused on Tech, and it’s quietly￼ a huge bargain. (Regardless of the so called news restriction announces this morning).I bought a couple weeks go...?"
Does anyone know when the actual stock swap will happen?
TSLA is the play of 2021. It's made people wealthy. LMT? zzzz......grandma stock
"Since LMT was $430 about 14 months ago, this 100B market cap company has generated roughy 8B in free cash flow to equity AND share count continues to go lower with buybacks. If, hypothetically, you could buy all the shares for its $100B market cap, you could generate you investment back in roughly 10 years AND you would still own all the shares of the company. Quite the undervalued stream of cash."
And the crowd goes wild
Strange stock reaction for a great quarter.

305 denied...
"Well, it worked last week, so here goes again, 5 bucks says we end up 5 bucks down! (I triple dog dare this market to prove me wrong!) ;-)"
So LMT jump 5 per cent per-market ! We will see how it is at the end of the day.

Interesting that we close below $340 the day UAE is buying 50 F35 and drones. What are we missing..... huge order.... down $2. This is not the exception but the rule lately. I keep thinking that we have reached a bottom but it just grinds lower despite good news again and again.
A lot of negative here so I'll come out and say I bought it @ $341.65. I was waiting for this entry point and will hold it long term.
No decisive moves until Nov?
Down in pre-market. Sad really.
I’m holding   
Boy I love owning this stock..... left too early last month and won't do that again! home again!
". . . a great business at a low price. Lockheed shares trade for just 13.6 times estimated 2021 earnings of $26.34 a share, a big discount to the market's 22.6 times multiple. If the stock can trade at a price/earnings ratio of 20, roughly in line with its recent discount to the S&P 500 valuation multiple, shares would fetch about $500, up more than 40% from recent levels. Lockheed has an attractive dividend yield, too, at about 3%. ""I'm getting paid to wait,"" adds Morgan. He's expecting good things."
Any reason this stock went from 410 to ~ 350 in just over a month?? That's a pretty steep drop ??

Not a great week for LMT despite a new conract announcement. BA did play a role in dragging the sector down. LMTdid show some life at the close today. Hoping for a better week ahead.

All that good news for Lockheed.

"if you think this isn't going to break 400 with all those missiles going off in the iron dome , well...you're wrong!"
Would love to see $300 today! I don't see why not
Know some people working for Lockheed. Great engineers and decent people. The company sale of F35 to Turkey will pass and maybe it will grab the fueling contact now it’s joining forces with Airbus
Gonna be a hard day at $UTX too I guess. F135 engine has fuel line durability issues it seems.
Broken stock. Free cash flow is too high against its relatively small market cap.
LMT will benefit from what is coming down the pike for the US. Proxies and Iran will make life difficult in many areas. Trump and his family will need to keep their head down.
Is Lockheed having any trouble getting raw materials? Hear MP stock is going up because of China’s restrictions on Raw Materials?
Thank you Bill for your reply... What you said is more sense... So as long as we own the shares and not selling... We will not lose anything... Just the values of the share will drop until it will go up
I believe LMT will land a big order from USA Defense Dept soon!
Screaming buy
Why does lockheed tank? All other corporate earnings rely on indentured serfs purchasing their products on big bank credit cards at usury rates. LMT relys on deficent spending and tax donkey
"Perhaps this is a way by Trump to create conflicts between competing corporations. He wants to make LMT squirm and uncomfortable and that this is an attempt by Trump to get LMT to lower the cost of the F-35s somehow. It will take years to make the F-18s stealthy and by the time the F-18s is stealthy, the Chinese and the Russians will be way ahead of us,"
"As of the company’s most recent reporting, it is shouldering an “elevated” level of financial leverage, Moody's reports, with its debt at 3.8 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). This is for a company and industry that has generally kept the figure below 3 times EBITDA.This relatively high level of debt can be attributed to the company’s pension deficit of around $12 billion and a mounting pile of funded debt, currently at about the $14 billion mark. That is largely as a result of its $9 billion acquisition of helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft in 2015."
OMG! I voted for Trump and now I'm so scared about my social security and healthcare.
Get ready for the big drop in 15 minutes.

great buy at $305
Why has LMT been going down and Boeing going up ? I am perplexed !!!
Every poster here is a white man over 45
Gridlock glorious Gridlock
"I am a long term holder of stock. LMT continues to drop for some reason, so the Corp continuing to buy back shares is, in my view, a good move - especially at these prices. I am reinvesting the substantial dividend $$ in more stock, which I think is a good move at these prices."
Isn’t Lockheed losing $10B F-35 revenue with Turkey due to their purchase of Russia’s missile defense system? And zero impact on Lockheed’s SP?!

"ALL BOW TO RISING CHINA.As America’s grasp on the world of supercomputing continues to slip, the Department of Energy is seeking to reinvigorate the nation’s capabilities.A new ranking shows that for the second year running, the world’s fastest supercomputer is TaihuLight, housed at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China. Capable of performing 93 quadrillion calculations per second, it’s almost three times faster than the second-place Tianhe-2. And in third spot this year is a newly upgraded device, called Piz Dain, at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre, which recently had its performance boosted by the addition of Nvidia GPUs.Sadly for America, the upgraded Piz Dain pushes the Department of Energy’s Titan supercomputer, which is housed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, into fourth spot. Able to make 17.6 quadrillion number crunches per second, Titan is just a fifth as fast as TaihuLight. In its defense, the U.S. still claims five of the top 10 spots, and it is home to 169 of the supercomputers that make up the fastest 500. China, meanwhile, can only claim 160.But the news nonetheless serves to highlight America's decline as a supercomputing heavyweight. This is the first time since 1996 that America hasn’t held one of the top three spots. It indicates that, while it certainly has significant supercomputing resources, it can’t tackle its biggest problems at anywhere near the speeds enjoyed by researchers in China.It may be tempting to suggest that the dawn of practical quantum computing, one of our 10 breakthrough technologies of 2017, would remove the need for supercomputers. But it will be several years before quantum computers can perform such large-scale calculations. Even then, while quantum devices promise to be able to solve some specific problems with incredible speed, it’s not clear whether they will be able to reliably solve all problems faster than regular supercomputers.That leaves many areas of research currently reliant on the results of huge computational effort—among them drug discovery, materials science, and climate modeling—still in need of fast supercomputers.The Department of Energy, whose Titan device was once the fastest in the world, is painfully aware of that fact. That’s exactly why it last week announced a $258 million funding injection into its exascale computing project. The money, which will be shared between AMD, IBM, Intel, Nvidia, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and Cray, is intended to fuel development of machines that are 50 times faster than Titan.The U.S. government reckons it will have a system capable of performing one quintillion operations per second—that’s 1,000 quadrillion, and 10 times the capacity of TaihuLight—by 2021.

$400 by tommorow. IMO 
It makes me feel better with couple stocks in green today. LMT will break $350 tomorrow. $400+ by the EOY!
Any investment house that downgrades a stock after it reached a 52 week low just shows you what their worth is. The stock is going up in 2019.
So Lockheed is transferring part of pension obligation to Prudential ($1.8 billion). What happens if Prudential fails? Who does retired employees get health insurance from?
"I just stumbled on to this stock, and to me it's a no brainer buy,buy,buy! it's Market cap isn't even twice it's annual revenue and it pays a dividend...what?!?! Plus government contract money. And after looking at 5 year charts my only regret is not finding it sooner"
No more pump n dumps today good lord please.
If you don’t long LMT Monday morning you are a total moron.
What a pop yesterday!!!......Why ?
During a wartime tech sector like $FB $NFLX $GOOG $SHOP $NOW will come down and redistribute to $RAD $LMT etc.
This stock is a great long term stock. Have had it for past 15 years and will keep buying the dips. My current base is $98 so I'm very happy. If you day trade this is not a stock for you
"Once again, good news with a big F16 contract and we bounce up $3+ and then fall negative. Can anyone else see this pattern of manipulation?"
"what I hate, is not knowing why its dropping. We look at the good fundamentals but its dropping for a reason which we don't know. Its not industry wide because GD and NOC are doing much better; they have more up days and their drops are not as significant."
Why the share price in all defense stocks are down today?
"Iran is a paper , so no war"
Pathetic !!!!!
"Why ain""t it going up ?"
What a buying opportunity!!!
One of my favorite stocks. Solid!

@Phuko...you are sounded really stuck up and elegant... How about you show me how to buy shares on London Stock Exchange? See if you can answer my question... Cocky man...
Beat expectations! 4.05 against 3.92 estimates 13.4B against 12.72 estimates Go LMT to the 
I heard a rumor from a friend who says he heard the younger folks are excited the stock price is coming down.
"Trump: We Cut Approximately $600 Million From F-35 (see Bloomberg Video ). Finally a real conservative running the country, not some NeoCon that makes up the career politicians, job for life, in Congress."
"In pharma industry, a company with a solid portfolio and secured earning growth of around 10% + good dividend can easily trade with pe of 20. If next week's earning news is positive, lmt should be able to reach $400 before Q2. $500 next year if it maintains steady positive performance."
"SEC has given the green light to Cathy Woods firm to open the ARKX fund (Aerospace & Defense). The new fund starts trading tomorrow 3/30/2021. LMT is a ""major holding"" of the fund. Many retail investors will be buying this fund tomorrow......pushing up ALL the defense & aerospace stocks. GLTA"
Do you know which companies make weapons for the infantry? Do they sell shares?
"are american dummy, holding a no rare earth company. it is under sanction, no more real f35 could be produced anymore! lmt should be 120 if not 0!"
even Ark invest is buying LMT...Something looming? I hope not.
Russian China Iran. North Korea. Looks ugly.We could die but at least we were prudent stock investors.
Sold all of mine last November for 393 . Waiting for the election dust to settle .It will go back up I think after new defense bill has passed I hope .

It will be going down today because of the senate vote.
Pre market tho?
"U.S. considering joining boycott of 2022 Beijing Olympics, State Department says.It is a certainty that the US Defense budget will increase. China is not an ally; far from it."
Trump crushed it.
@Eric.....to be sub $300 you would have had to pick up your shares pre Jan 2019 OR you had perfect timing and bought them in 5 trading days between March 16 and March 23 of 2020. I don't think you will be seeing $300 again anytime soon.
steven is a basher....only comments on lmt and only started in the last 4 weeks...prior posts is 20 weeks ago on another forum. rotating on his fake accounts or is just mad his puts are losing money. never reply to a basher that is how they make money mute them. overall trading above 50 day average with strong sales.
How much military systems are even sold to Turkey and who is covering the defaults
LM should buy GE for 70 Billion.
Analysts not happy
I just reinvest never sell... should I sell and then hold and buy back—or just keep reinvesting...?
Take that 200/50 DMA!
"We""ll see if it drops tomorrow because of Morgan Stanley."
I dumped this at $261. Price is ridiculous. More pain for longs I'm afraid.
400 by end of next week
"This is one of my top 3 fav stocks— dividend, PT and it always flies on conflict news. Tensions brewing w armed forces so I will keep adding, air spam a lot"
 strong beat ++++
Couple of peculiar volume spikes here.
"LMT will not be affected by tariffs. The rumblings of it will probably be a drag on share price for a bit but the 50dma has been bullet proof thus far. We're right at it now just as we were on Feb5. I'm long shares anbd long synthetically with forward month puts right til next Jan. This is like shooting fish in a barrel. Of course, all the knucklehead losers will come out in droves now to report it's imminent death and lose their few nickels and dimes."
Is the pension 100% funded?
One of the traders on Fast Money last night said Defense is back buy LMT. Stock has been getting stronger on the close; a good sign
The junk trapped me for so long
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lockheed-martin-omnispace-develop-space-130935440.html
@Craig & Steven........$400 coming up. Better cover if you are short.
Hewson got super rich watching it go south now this guy is going to try and BS all for 10 more years and get super rich off us
Doesn't this guy realized that he is endangering our national security with his tweets? Incredible!!!!
could LMT buy some of BA assets?
What does a Senate flip mean for LMT? Any thoughts?
The upside potential for LMT just got a whole lot more interesting. Not sure how awe-som_sto-cks finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
What is going on?
Well what do ya know
"The following are 12 month price targets made after earnings by the following companies. I point out that Standard & Poors has no brokerage business and therefore one can not suggest that S & P has a bias to pump any stock. In fact brokerage firms pay S & P to obtain S & P's research. Morgan Stanley price target: $373.00, Stifel price target $400.00, Standard and Poors price target $420.00 I suggest patience. I believe that all of these respected firms are not mistaken."
LMT chart is the most perfect chart I have ever seen.
I hear Guy Adami on Fast Money keep mentioning LMT as final trade lately repeatedly. What is the reason? Stock keep going down. May be this is his pump and dump scheme?
Nevermind the the political brooha. Why is this defense stock stuck?
See you all next week.
BA up over $8 and LMT up .80
"Now that the share price is at 300, maybe this is the beginning of a buying spree. Maybe 300 is the magic number."
OGE climbed to #4 in the Valueline Income and apptreciation Portfolio then in a short period of time LMT replaced it. I have noticed other missteps CHL was a strong buy at 50 then slipped to 42 43 range. I have learned stick with the Div Portfolio the rest stinks
this thing is bottomeless
HMNY........do your DD and make lots of $$$$$$$
From up 4 to down 4 in 1 hr- thats the pig we know and love
fast approaching a 3% dividend stock! very exciting.
Why Bitcoins goes up too much?
"Again, Far East leads the way."
"So, why is LMT giving up a week of gains this morning?"
Don’t believe the pre-market today... LMT going higher again.
Today looks interesting...
"With corp tax reduced to 21%, thought the div increase would be larger. Seems to be the trend."
"Alaska Air outsized large order. Ryanair same. Delta is next. China airlines too. NOW is the time to write off old fleet and replace with more fuel efficient aircraft. Let's also just ignore the 800B USD defense budget, to which $LMT and $BA are top beneficiaries. $LMT and $BA -- don't delay -- when it makes the move to 326.78, I will repost here for you lovely souls to enjoy. Until then, all the best, lover4virginia"
"LMT is confused. The market is up today, shouldn’t LMT be down?!?"
This is the stock you should be buying in these uncertain times. Tariffs won't hurt this stock.
@r_1901....you must be retired... Would you please show me how to use 401k to add more shares?
"Cynthia - as you can tell there are lots of opinions which way to go nd maybe one size doesn’t fit all. I view all debt as evil. Dave Ramsey would advocate retire debt free. Sure, looking hindsight is 20/20 but the market is not guaranteed. Also, if tapping 30K doesn’t rid yourself of the debt then what have you gained? You still have the same outgoing payments."
Somebody really intentionally and deliberately does not want to see this go up.

in order to get the dividend one has to hold the stock till feb 26?
"From Far East to Eastern European block, they certainly are busy today."
"CNBC just said ""LMT is trading AWFUL!"""
"But hey, the CEO got out near the peak"
"LMT cash balance cut in half a few years ago to 1.1B, and Sikorsky & Leidos acquisitions were funded with debt vs cash. Marillyn make think it’s smart, but market doesn’t like the leverage, nor the interest it has to pay to keep improving in the future. LM has continued to finance continuing operations and growth with debt; recent long-term bonds selling at 7.2%."
And entire week of action and...
is anyone else as excited as I am with the new CEO? I like the tech/ telecom background he has and think it'll help LMT usher in new futuristic aero/defense technology! Long with a +$500 PT
I can tell you firsthand that LMC is excellent at draining foreign government’s pockets of money. The Canadian Surface Combatant project’s estimate has basically doubled over the past 2.5 years.  Cash cow  
Serious support here. This is going to 475
"Panic not. It has only dropped back to where it was 2 weeks ago and up $55 a share from a year ago. I never understand why this happens, company reports strong, stock drops. The only thing I can figure is that big institutional investors try to close large positions to sweep up profits and start a short term sell off. The fundamentals are better than close yesterday."
Dividend Zombies are on the Attack ! May be a good buy next week !
nasty
How much higher you think this will go? Will it spike again after trump announces an attack?
"Does anyone know whatever happened to the water purification patent LMT has secured a few years ago. It was going to be a graphene based filter allowing only water molecules to pass. The idea was that you could take any source of water, including saltwater and make it fresh water. I have not heard a thing about it for a long time."
"I can't believe that Mnuchin trying to knee-cap the economy at a time when people are suffering. His moves could send the economy into a tailspin. Very unpatriotic. At some point, the market will wake up to what he's done."
"There is a double bottom at $300. Pushing below that, you have to look for the 200 dma, currently around $288. IMO, I don't see it breaking the double bottom support, but, my opinion is worth exactly what you just paid for it."
"The Orange Fool just pressured Powell to drop the funds rate to zero, and the premarkets didn't like that. No more bullets left for the economy. I miss Presidential leadership."
Looks like the war is on. There is no way Trump will go the diplomatic route. His ego will not let him.
$LMT Reiterated by Cowen Buy USD 410
it never stops
What’s cooking on the threat board?
Shorties... Try harder... You aren't going to get my shares....
Better add to my position. I fear the new country of Chaz.
This is being pushed down on good news again. Let's see a short squeeze.
Trump is a wartime President.
Markets appear sluggish across the board. Summer doldrums?
Kinda disappointed this one sold off like the tech sector today. So undervalued unlike a lot of them.
"I’m thinking of buying LMT and hold , any advice?"
The President can declare a state of war in which our constitution is under threat from domestic enemies thereby allowing him to arrest those that are enemies of the constitution.
CEO has sold 45000 shares since January. Wow.
Being down over 50k in three days may seem scary - until I look at the 5 year chart. In the grand schemes of things its not an issue - plenty of time to recover. If anything I will buy more.
Just blowing w the sector wind. Can’t get differentiated from it. Need news catalyst. Maybe Aerojet approval or finally some good news on F35. Otherwise wait for earnings and maybe Jim T shows some life. A very rare day we are out performing NOC- it aint over. Feels like it should close up .5% or so
"Today marks my 5th anniversary of buy LMT. Paid $88.90/share 3/5/2013. Needless to say, I'm pretty happy with this investment so far. Here's to the future!"
LM needs to break through resistance at 350. It looks like it wants to do it but its go to be on high volume. today up 6.22 on 2M shares. bullish for sure
Jack short
Always peeters out!
"i'm afraid this is going to stay a great value for another year. I will wait for the market to wise up. at this point next year, LMT will be higher than TSLA.(only because TSLA will drop to $400)"
LMT is up 5.12% to 327.33
F35 news ALL miserable thanks to our overpaid fatcats------------------------------------------------------------------------------I need someone to eloborate in more detail what this means...
"Just my lmt. It's been going down since mid Feb. At some point you have to just take the loss and move on. Hoping and wishing doesn't do it. I try to set a loss of approx. 8% as the sell point. If a stocks been dropping for 4 months, it's dropping for a reason. GLTA"
62 billion deal ? Will.it pop tommorow ?
Trickys boeing investment at 450 took a big hit today. May have to work until 70 like Jack's financially savvy friends
This downward trend is nothing more than an over reaction of fear Trump will stop sales of the F35 to the Saudis. Sales will be strong even if sales are canceled to Saudis. China is Americas biggest threat. Russia a little but not so much.
FANGS stock money managers know market better than others.
"My utility portfolio also declined today. Performance today looks limited to the financials like Goldman, JP Morgan, and Travelers. Caterpillar also popped up. Sudden profit taking in LMT. I'll continue to hold."
Lockheed is making a run at 400 again! Hopefully this is the breakthrough we need. Lockheed is having an amazing year despite all that has happened.
The younger generation loves it when the stock goes down
The new admin may not buy as much hardware the next 4 years.
Was the cash flow improved?
I can almost touch the 52week high!
"Highly oversold, reversal expected, but when?"
LMT does NOT like 400
LMT reached a new All Time High at 340.11
I don't like LMT price action anymore!Laggard stock!
"Revenues guidance is $59 billion, consensus is $58 billion !"
No news is good news. Actual news is bad news.
I say up it goes as earnings is just around the corner. There has been lots of news of many countries purchasing LMT hardware. 
"This will be back below $400 by next week, put"
"Lockheed Martin's ""HIMARS"" is in high demand....missile firing mobility in any situation. BUY BUY BUY"

LT loves Jim!
Read every word of call transcript twice. Taiclet is trying to paint F35 positively w gibberish. No honesty. Did not realize he has Ivy League graduate school on his resume. Are they going to make 140 F35s or not? Totally evasive
LMT will come back with some vengeance and on the positive I suspect there are many new investors over the past week. That said I own a good number of shares and I have never have seen a drop like this with such good financial news and several billion of orders closing in the win column. I will be patient and wait for the positive correction but my past 100% commitment over 20 years feeling LMT trends are reliable like clockwork are now in question.
"@Tricky if you're not trolling, why don't you respond to anyone or engage in discussion for that matter. If indeed your interest is truly piqued?"
"Can't help being optimistic. Democrats got us into WW1, WW2, and VietNam."
LMT should go up today.
Lets get this straight ..... LMT does no business with China and is actually limited to its interaction with the company.
why is this thing down every god dam day?
LMT reached a 52 Week high at 362.22
I don't get it. Weren’t the super Tuesday results supposed to pop the defense stocks at least 5%?
LMT reached a new All Time High at 357.88
China is a nothing compare to Saudi Arabia that's about to order a bunch of F-35 after the peace agreement with Israel
$17b in sales a slight beat. EPS at $6.38. Not exactly setting the world on fire. Well now we know why the stock kept going down.
Where’s GSPIIR to tell us how we’re not going to hold $370?
@GPSIIR.....$380 by the end of the year? At the end of the year $380 will be way back in the rear view mirror.
"Guys, I believe in this stock, but my gut makes me think that I can get in for under 300 a share. I do not know why it would ever drop that low, except it just feels like it is going there. This is a great company and should be the bedrock of every serious portfolio that tries to meet diversification standards. But for whatever reason... I just feel like I can get a better price than this, even though I have no way I can look at the finance sheet and say there is a path any way but up. :/"
"Oh right, September."
Crooked market. How your hell do we close red??
thank Ark for the rally
what % gain you think we will get if we beat ER?
Why did LMT stock drop yesterday ? Today's futures does not look good. What's going on?
Turkey knows this plane is a turkey. S400 has already made it obsolete. Australia and Canada are well aware of its deficiencies.
When was the last LMT split? hmmm : )
"“If a business does well, the stock eventually follows.”"
"So what am I missing here, down again today?"
Down again in pre-market. This pig is going down.

"Added a few shares @352 to start a position, have a limit order for more @350. Under FV here for sure, with a rock solid div with super DGR. Works for me %^ ).."

what's the payout date for this quarter's dividend?
They’re baaack. Ghost of Poltergeist.
THIS STOCK SUCKS !!!!
DOWN DOWN WE GO!!
"Schwab rates us a D, bottom 10% of stocks, underperform."
"@Joe....let me share a little something with you. Goldman Sachs took LMT from neutral to ""conviction buy"" yesterday and the stock goes down, GS went to ""conviction buy"" on Prudential Insurance 2 weeks ago at $104...it's now $93. Goldman Sachs took International Paper (IP) from neutral to sell 2 weeks ago after the stock was already down 30%.....today it jumped 10% on their earnings report. Moral of the story.....watch out for analyst and investmentment houses!! They have an agenda , and it's not the same as your agenda. GLTU"
No relief rally today for LMT. Probably trades sideways for next week.
This was a good day it allowed for discount purchase. I got 60 more shares equalling 569 @9.09 ave. I have $LMT and $ET and i love these stocks but $AMC is a passion. The HF have to be broken with   and the steel will of the 's
ZERO UPSIDE for the next entire year. Cry if you want. FACTS ARE FACTS.
Get prepared for Moon Mission 2024 with LMT+NOK ;-)
Lockheed kills earnings in every sector 
"We should rally these stocks that China put sanctions on, to stick it to China. Bullies. Stand up to their nonsense for lack of other words that would be censored."
how was the last quarter. was stock up or down?
Anyone like the new health care plan? The sock holders love you for pumping up the earnings with employee give backs. The CEO is going to make millions on your givebacks.
Time to buy LMT!
It has been quiet in here the past few days. I thought everybody died.
LMT long and strong
"According to Yahoo News, “One of the reasons the Air Force is reevaluating the F-35 program is a tacit acknowledgment that the flat budgets projected in the near future may not allow the service to buy all 1,763 F-35s in its program of record.”"
Always goes back up
Will see it most likely around 315 at the end of this week

"If I were Trump , I would have Schiff arrested on attempted coup , conspiracy to defraud America’s choice for President . Allow shift to defend the lies he has fabricated against President Trump .let the courts decide if Schiff is guilty of fabricated lies ."
"Wow, the CEO retired in the middle of the crisis? Smart...not"
What is the bad news?
"How can this be down? Killed the quarter, Increased guidance, etc., etc., etc."
"Was looking back on the chart to see any pattern that looks like what we are seeing now, and the last two times was on 2/10/2020 and 10/4/2018, there was a lot of down before heading up again. I'm not a big fan of using past charts to predict the future (I'm strictly a fundamentals guy), but I know someone who's very good at it (I call it ""watching the wiggles"") and I have a pretty good idea he would agree with my assessment.... Fortunately for me, I sold 90% plus of my shares (2550 or so) on the April 8th at $381, to transfer to a new retirement management fund (I believe it was ""Eric"" on the board that disparaged me from having so much in LMT... ;-) ) Hope for some major news, or expect a fair amount of drop before bouncing..... Too much of this company's earnings are riding on the F35, which isn't healthy...."
Kind of wallowing…
it is now down ytd
RTX sure is going up a lot for a company whose engines aren’t working.
smoke and mirrors. the military is the walking dead at best. a gambling stock like all others due to failed security.

So BA will soon become a ward of the state. In order to pay back that debt they may need to sell parts of the business. Could LMT pick up some of the drone tech as well as the new and improved F-15 fighter?
"In addition to the recent $15B IDIQ award, Lockheed Martin was awarded an $861.7M contract modification to a previously awarded contract. This modification exercises options to procure eight Lot 14 F-35A Lightning II repositioned aircraft and six Lot 14 F-35A aircraft for the Air Force."
$400 by EOW?
This is a $500+ stock when Trump gets re-elected. Long calls.
I love the stock market bubbles and working it. Scram spam
They say the market is efficient. Really?..........this stock is a coiled spring. It's a game the BIG BOYS play with their AI and ML algorithms. Well LMT reports in a week...........so times almost up boys. GL.
just bought 400 shares and sold 200 at end of the day . I will load 300 more on Monday.
Next entry point ... april.
See what tomorrow brings- do not see any catalysts to the up. Our fat cats are checking out. F35 news ALL miserable thanks to our overpaid fatcats. Our CEO talks in stupid circles- think the Dems on the hill would eat him alive- thats why he sent Ulmer to sound like a BSing fool last Thurs- he had no balls to do it himself. Our last CEO with the help of the board raped us. Obviously she was not watching over f35.
"I started adding some more Lockheed again, I was heavy into defense stock but I feel like Lockheed itself is a good buy, I see a big rebound coming"

This stock so low... that the “stock bubble” bots considering ceasing posting on this board .
See u at 375 again bye
Sold my 12/21 calls for 280% gain. Bullish on LMT just want to see it pull back to 338-340 before making the next jump to 360.
Such a sad stock. And this is supposed to be the crown jewel of the US defense?
"They were the alpha lions, the bullies on the block, they build nuclear weapons, they enslaves people, they invaded countries, they rigged election, overthrow foreign governments, they even assasinated foreign leaders, now their dominion are comming to an end. China and India alone will have a GDP of $150 trillion, more than NATO combined they will then build a military to match. And what would the former world power have to say, well here it goes. Don't abuse less powerful states, don't bully others, don't invade other, don't interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. But China and India are too smart to buy that nonsense, if might is right then you have to be very big and very powerful , then you have to use that to vanquished your enemies. How does an aging alpha male lion feels as he look on on the open plains and see two young male lions charging at him ?"

So I have a position at an average cost @$350. It is amazing to me that we bounce to $294 and now we are BACK to $378. I do not understand the huge volatility on LMT. I think it should be trading north of $400. Are we afraid of Biden?
Contract increases should be for a great quarter
LMT should be 340 now but don't know why the price has been depreciated
"I don't understand why some people get panic , just compare the fundamentals with other stocks. I ll load more baby . tomorrow is a rebound 345 is my target tomorrow you will see it"
to space and beyond!
Anyone hear anything about Skunk works fission project.
WE will see what the earning report brings . I think there will another dip . Hold on !
Talk to me goose. D announcement not viewed favorably?
Now LMT gets an upgrade... but the stock doesn't move ;)...
Nothing ventured nothing gained.
Why every defense stocks down even Korean made threats today
If they would split this stock I would be a buyer.
"Earnings of this company are solid. I like to buy companies on a large discount and this company is already in my buying range. The only reason I didn't buy it is because I CAN'T, both my bank and my other broker do not offer shares in LMT. If it drops to 300 and you're bullish keep adding. Just my opinion. I am very bullish (I hardly ever am). 12 month target: 430-450 USD."
why during crisis a lot of CEOS decide to step down? because they liquidate their shares maybe?
I’m thinking of adding 100 shares of this in my IRA. First time I’d own this. Any downside to having in an IRA? Price looks attractive based on what I’ve read on LMT.
Green every single day what the #$%$ - not that I am complaining lol
All time high! LMT was far away from Boeing stock.Now right on Boeing's heels!Good job Lockheed Martin!
Earnings not far away.
Down almost $5 after great earnings and they raised guidance too. We are $20 off the high. I really do not understand the selling here.... I added down $4.50 so I already looking at losses but I do not understand the selling.
Today may just be the capitulation buyers were looking for before getting back in.
Pop goes the weasel. What gives?
"No doubt in my mind that LMT, NOC, RTN, et al., have all been pulling back since the N Korea announcement and has little or none to do with tariffs. At 18-20 forward earnings for the sector, I don't see much downside potential. I'm long shares and long synthetically using short OTM puts. An announcement of a meet date I think would also weigh on the sector but I see this as a buying opportunity. Nothing fundamentally has changed. G.L."
312 level will make me buy. I only have Raytheon and GD now....but always wanted LMT.
Keeping dividend paying stocks. The 2Q dividend announced is excellent.
us older more seasoned investors who do not listen to Miley Cyrus prefer steady and consistant blue chippers.
"Its all about that cash, bout that cash"
Trump needs a war to fill out his resume. He can’t get on Mt Rushmore without it.
Hewson and other lmt executives should be investigated for inside trading.
"The F35 will be the next F16. Greece, Romania and Poland are next in line"
What is the problem with this stock?
"Win a Billion dollars in a week and the stock goes down, sellers have no clue what they are doing!!!"
Market maker/bookie did a masterful job this week pinning LMT at 340 to make the options—both calls an puts—expire with as little value as possible.
Low volume and she's moving up on air. one of the healthiest Charts I've seen in a long time. 50 EMA should be crossing the 100 next week that's good for a 20$ pop still waiting on the Golden Cross which is coming and could send this to 440
Anybody hear that Congress having a Big meeting with Bank CEO’S in May? Was in Yahoo Report.
LMT increased dividend Friday to $2.60 per share! This stock is a beast in this environment
This stock could use a 4 to 1 split.
"Looks like someone finally read the quarterly report and saw the projected earnings for 2019 & 2020. Could also be part of the window dressing that starts every year about this time. Or, could be sector rotation out of techs and into aerospace"
Nobody retires before 65 anyway...avg age is like 63
LMT and the defense industry will be fine. Will buy more if the stock sells off. http://seekingalpha.com/article/4032554-top-3-defense-stocks-2017
"Well, I'd say easy come easy go, but for this stock, it's a slow, horribly painful struggle for each nickel up, but can drop dollars in a heartbeat."
How about that yield though :|
Good news doesn't truly affect this stock. Should have known from the past 8-9 days. To much manipulation of share price keeping it down
"I liked this part of that Croatia deal article:Lockheed has also seen international interest for as many as 300 of its fourth-generation F-16 fighter jets on top of the current production backlog of 128 jets, Ulmer said.(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Dan Grebler and David Gregorio)Eventually these sales will really add up to bring LMT in the $400's quickly."
"LMT and BMY are now acting like market hedges. they go the opposite direction of the market.when money is scared, it runs to good value, high div stocks.I think the only thing that could send this higher is a market correction."
Why bother with t-bills when you can own LMT
"Markets have a positive day, positive news with Japan contract comes out and has a down day. Figures"
"Another day, another drop."
Make war...make money unfortunately!
"Think we beat and raise tomorrow early. Future price action based on Taiclet showing some life and vision- did we buy back last quarter- some excitement regarding future in various rumored segments. Like Satellite 5g, or hypersonics- any possibilities with non defense segments to become big revenue producersAny of this could continue the long upward trend we are experiencing"
Has anyone gotten their dividend yet?
sold my LMT at 350... will get back in around 250....
First time in awhile $LMT seems to be outperforming $NOC and $RTX.
Build it and they will come. LMT sure doing alot of building and keeping busy. :)
The culture at Boeing is astounding. First they wanted a bailout and then when the FEDs wanted equity in exchange they all at once said they didn’t need federal help. So effectively they were looking to take advantage of taxpayers with a handout that wasn’t really needed. Let’s hope future gov’t contract awards take this into consideration because their culture has not changed one bit. Boeing needs to become the poster child of corrupt corporate culture in aerospace.
War with Korea? I don't know but Trump was in Davos with Dr. Strangelove today.
Well..good bye to our expectations of lmt hitting 400. To 400 it was nice flirting with ya!
$321 was the low for the year .. sounds good to me .. liftoff!
"Another down day for LMT, see, they keep winning contracts, which is good for the company and bad for the stock (don't ask me to explain, I just observe.)"
"Especially at a time when both Russia and China are developing hypersonic missile delivery systems, ---------------------------------------------------LMT is our only savior."
Why is this going down right after a big spike it makes no sense
Did the 2018 benefits package demoralize the employees?
"Market is up 540 points, all my other stocks are up, but this one manages to go down on high volume? Maybe profit taking..... go figure."
stock is stuck in the mud with the rest of defense which goes down. could be a biden year
"Is this a new Yahoo summary page for LMT, indicating 40% undervalued? Or just an attempt to raise subscriptions to Yahoo's so-called research reports? I get my copyrighted reports from my various street account brokers. Consistently half-bullish, half-bearish, as to be expected in an efficient free market."
The company board will announce the dividend on Thursday...
$381 by closing Bell. RSI is over 83 now on the Daily. Has to come back down to Earth at some point
Boeing= Tom Brady. LMT= Dysfunctional Redskins
Still oversold imo. Space forces will inquire quite a cost to implement. Lockheed is positioned well for it.
"I, too, have been looking for at least a 3 for 1 stock split.I, too, have been looking for at least a 3 for 1 stock split.I, too, have been looking for at least a 3 for 1 stock split."
Trump is looking for a way out but there is none.
400 coming?
I am a supporter for peace  but i personally think we should do a preemptive strike on the Chinese.
Beats in revenues. Beats in EPS. Raises guidance. Raised the dividend last month. The stock down $5. I guess this is fear about Biden getting elected but this is getting silly. I think is a strong buy.
Why do aerospace companies covertly discriminate against older workers? Who are buyouts target ted against? How many older workers participate or given opportunities for career advancement? Why are most benefit changes impacting older workers the most? Why are raises higher for younger workers than older workers?
Dividend payment day this Friday. more shares than originally expected.
Appears to be a broad market trim
why this is going down ????
Hey guys I am not one for predictions and seldom do this but I am going to go out on a limb here and say that todays price of $333.32 is close if not THE low. With a week and a half to earnings I am doubling my position here.
Any thoughts why this stock is down $15 in 7 days? Especially curious with LMT receiving a new $64b order. What am I missing?
@ Jamie: Then why has LMT stock gone down 50 points since mid-february ?
What a JOKE! $90 Billion Market Value for a Chinese SCAM $NIO!!!! It was a $1 Billion company a few months ago! Now its market value is same as $LMT Lockheed Martin!The US Stock Market is a SCAM! Fraudulent companies are trading at Billions of Dollars Market Values!

You know what LMT holders? Cathie Wood's ARKQ picked LMT in their holdings yesterday. It will be bounced up in 2 months by at least 20%. Mark my word.
"It's keep going down, why???"
Time to BUY LMT!!!
This is easily going back to $200.
"So Boeing gets rewarded for killing innocent people, and LMT gets the shaft..."
Let's see what happens when the UAE deal goes thru.
interesting that ARK bought LMT. ARK seems to provide itself on innovative up-and-comers. I guess they just thought this value was too good to pass up.
Down today. What's the matter with this stock?
This stock is exceedingly stable at this price lol. It needs to go up a bit in my opion.
This makes no sense! Great QTR stock goes down!!! IDIOT'S must be selling!!!
I do not see this stock going up to 350 for the next 5 years.

"367, all time high, I guess jack and tricky (even though he sold all of his LMT at 308 to jump on BA at 450) are no longer whining about insider trading"
Take it to year highs soon!
"I wonder what the CEO will do to help the shareholders. Getting disappointed by the sham of news today. All good, and nothing else to say otherwise. What we get for internet ""freedom"""
I don't get it. BA is up and we beat too. why do we keep going down.
got back in at 321. loving it.
I'm tired of this #$%$
Boeing going to $0.00
"July 25 (Reuters) - U.S. weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp reported earnings on Wednesday that exceeded analysts' profit estimates, but frustrated investors betting on an even better quarter after rival Lockheed Martin Corp's strong results earlier this week.Northrop's shares fell 6.2 percent at the start of trading after reporting its first results to include its $7.8 billion acquisition of rocket-maker Orbital ATK.Northrop also raised its earnings forecast for 2018, which it expected to be led by sales of parts used in fighter jets as well as a lower tax rate.But analysts at Stifel said the fact the defense contractor ""largely reiterated 2018 guidance except for a lower tax rate assumption,"" could frustrate some investors expecting a bigger forecast lift following strong results from rival Lockheed Martin, including a boost to its sales forecast."
What’s happening this morning? No news yet falling like a rock.
I love the USA and the USA stock market
"Ah, Brexit. Can”t believe that was 40+ years ago. Just call me Dino"
This stock was once 400 and over.....
What's with LMT today 10-11-19
Democrats and the fake gestapo style media can be charged with high crimes against the US .
If LMT could Just get some news coverage that separates it from Boeing it could actually shine like the superior￼ company it truly is.
unbelievable! i remember that i regret so much to sell lmt @ 335 in early 2019. now i picked lmt around the same price. this company has hell a lot values. i am sure it will run to 400 shortly.
Easy double within 3 years
ARK Investments will soon be launching their Space ETF. I imagine that LMT will quickly become one of the top holdings.
love that dividend

The Lockheed dilemma: its going up due to our future war with NK. Yet when us shareholders are all ready to cash out we will be nuked.
"it seems even the best of defense stocks are not immune to the institutional bull****. of institutions. How unpatriotic. You buy defense stocks for the technology they represent ( you like TVS and stereos &/or FLIRS used by the fire department, the ability to be in NY or LA and go to Europe or vacation on a Pacific island or the Alps; and the the comforts of home ( beats living in a cave, eh? ) and the idea they help to keep you and your family safe from those want to kill or enslave you; and the better payout than a bank about 0.01% on ou hard earned money.........."
Tea leaves say more fire support purchases coming.
"People. LMT is a solid old-school stock. It’s not a TSLA, NIO, AAPL, or FB. It also has dividends which the others don’t. Just diversify."

These dips and daily gains are crazy for a stock that should be steady. I can see a small dip or gain here and there but $5 to $10 swings daily. wow
"Another trading day, another all time high. GOTTA LOVE IT"

At least CEO sold near peak

Unbelievabe! I cannot ibelieve it went down this much and fast.
LOLOL. i love it. Republicians - be careful what you wish for !!! HAHAHAHAHAHa
Why is it down if Quartal results were above expectations? Or have I misunderstood it?
I’m an idiot. Over here holding LMT for a messily 15% gain. Meanwhile others are getting rich off a stupid meme coin. Crazy times.
"It's certainly not performance driven. In fact performance is at a all time best, it does not matter. All of the Defense Company stocks are all taking a beating this year. They all peaked and they all are tumbling. Why, ""No global crisis going on.. North Korea has calmed down. Does not make the news any more."""
Literally zero wrong with this company
"All you say is correct other than underperforming on what was delivered on biggest sales item. Bloated, fat cat leadership is hard to overcome and the street sees this. Hoping Taiclet can turn around."

This company is sinking. You will see supply chain shock soon.

"LMT, the company, seems to be doing great. LMT, the stock, gets no respect.I feel like I am missing something and that is stopping me from totally loading up, but this should be $400, easy.what did I miss? I know the Dems control the govt but that has not hurt LMT in prev years."
When does the mass exodus begin? It’s coming but when?

This is a BUY!
why the drop I love Lockheed Martin
any predictions of what this will close at?
News doesn't affect this. Quite rediculous. One of these days.
Great company earnings and dividend and great products used around the world nothing to worry bout here not a dotcom with no earnings!
did y'all get your 2q dividend?
Anyone know why it fell off a cliff a little while ago? It's about $8 off the high.
This board isn't posting all messages. Even when it is right.
We are now in correction territory
This stock Boeing and Raytheon are all up at 300% over the last 8 -9 years longs prosper!
Dementia Joe doesn’t believe in defense....he’s a powder puff
LMT & BA. Defensive winners + dividends for the long term. Can't go wrong
It is the decrease in cash flow despite the increase in profits and earning. Not good news.
"Fortune ranks LMT as one of the worlds ""Most Admired Companies"", first in A&D. That and $6 should get you a venti mocha latte later on today."
Smart play here is to sell quickly and get back in in about 12 - 16 months. Mainly because of the worries about pandemic virus. this will be going on for at least that long. I see the stock dipping into the high 200's by end of year. might even have LMT split during this time as they will want stock to look attractive to new players. I am not saying the stock will split though. Hopefully the people wanting to get out at 400 did so and stuck to their plan and again enjoy the opportunity to get back in at around 275
My guess is trade deal stagnation and political uncertainty make for another sideways week at best.
"Kathy Wood is investing in $LMT. She must like the fact that $LMT is trading at a discount. I bet she also likes the fast rising dividend. Or, could it be that “Cold Fusion” has finally arrived? :)"
That ‘old geezer’ saved a lot of people in that church in Texas. Kudos to that ‘old geezer’. His experienced paid off handsomely! We need more heroes like him to help rid the evil in this world

Why buy and Hold LMT? You can just swing trade PLTR/Tesla with 100k and bring in like 5-6k a day.Thats like 2 years of dividends with 100k in LMT.

easily going to be over $396 by closing
Come on $Money Train$ and ride it! 460s in no time.
LMT is about to break out... not to mention pay out a fat dividend in the next few days. It doesn't make sense to sell right now. You can't keep this stock down for too long before stockholders realize that LMT should be part of each person's portfolio for a number of reasons. For those patient long-term holders... you will be rewarded handsomely in the next couple of months. Just watch.
Hmm Wondering why this stock is undervalued and keep falling? there is only positive news
Tsla=sexy. LMT looks and feels like my grandma's doilies.
People loading the boat now will be rewarded with a whiplash to $400
Both Lockheed and Northrup beat earning and revenues. Cowen upgrades LMT to a buy today.
How's that saying about May go again?
A 7 point drop yesterday ! What is going on here? And this AIN'T good. There will not be a blue wave in November and I am not a repulblican. That 'expert'will be wrong. The Dems thinks that they will cruise in November but I doubt that very much. I predict a huge voter turnout from both parties and the republicans will prevail.
What do you think about the rate cut?
Is LMT overvalued at current levels? if you guys have questions you should ask awesomeSTO-CKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.

I think the LMT and LHXsOf the world need to do a better job at showing who they are- real technology companies. As we all know many innovations came from NASA and Lockheed,etc for decades. Time for big defense to also find ways to make more commercial and consumer friendly tech prosper or the spacex and virgin galactics of the world will just take it themselves"
Don’t look good
"LMT won't stay down forever. I am accumulating, great discounts on the stock amd longer term hold. Always has been a solid stock. Once we see rotations out of technology, they'll come back into LMT."

"There goes my dream of a quick 15% return. Im still confident it can hit $500 som we waace time in 2022. It has the best military planes in the industry, with solid dividend. The Democrats may use defense budget cut to get GOP to agree to more social spending, but unlikely will cut it since the country needs more government spending to restart the economy. All major military projects run into glitches given their complexities and constant specs changes. F-35 will be in demand for at least until 2040."

"I keep looking at my portfolio looking for things to sell/reduce to free up cash because I'd like to have lots of cash available for purchase going forward and only want to hold the strongest of companies right now. I like Lockheed, their recent earnings report was very good but I don't know how much more upside it has. What say all of you? It's aerospace, but it's not Boeing. Lockheed appears to be hiring right now, not laying off workers. How does it fair in the new economy going forward?"

Readying for another attack on all time high.
Looking like $340...
why lmt is in bad shape?
"Well, that didn't work, it really *did* go down about 5 bucks. As I've stated before, this stock just isn't sexy compared to Tesla (which makes no sense whatsoever!). It doesn't seem to matter the company does, the stock just doesn't want to follow the market anywhere but down..... :-("

Why the drop today ?

"@ DON - 18 hrs ago - I am 100 per cent invested in LMT stock for m,y 401k. I got hit hard in 2008. An advisor told me that my 401k should be diversified. He said to diversify some of my plan into Treasuries. So i did. I lost money for about a week. I called him back and I ""Fired"" him. And got back into LMT stock completely. I have made more money on my own by not following this guy advice. Yes, I know it is very risky to be completely into one company stock but it has worked out well for me, so far."
I like the setup for tomorrow ..just a hunch 394-397
What are stock symbols of the names of companies that supply to the military? Thank you.

"If Dems take White House in 2020, this bloated pig is falling like a rock.."
Really hate to say this but looks like they ran it up a couple days now it’s dropping back to where it was at it’s low.
$17b in sakes. A slight beat. ePS of $6.38 is not good. I believe that is a 2 cents miss. Well now we now why the stock plunged and kept going down last 2 months. Someone knew. The good news it is so cheap it should not be a disaster.
Lol whoever sold due to emotions of the last couple days missed out on the bounce back that always happens. Stocks just don’t go straight up.
"How about $180, that will make LMT price closed to reality today! if the interests in the bank is 2%, LMT should be at $180 without consider China sanction on LMT..... so we see $180 in 90 days."
Looks like Boeing let MBAs make too many decisions they weren’t qualified to make. The chickens are coming home to roost
So Boeing gets a handout and Northrop and Raytheon get nothing. SO much for free markets
"LMT is a great stock as long as the US budget remains high. I suspect if Biden wins there will be legislation to eventually make defense cuts. Unfortunately, democrats are focused on socialistic ideals at the moment, increase corporate taxes will also hurt LMT. Its unfortunate but the country may end up less safe as the money goes to Green New Deals and getting rid of combustion engines:)"
"Time for a reality check, burping up a little on a lower than average volume day isn't time to start screaming that we are heading through the roof. This isn't showing strength, yet. Three months ago we were at $356. Six months ago we were at $395. We gave up half of what we gained today. If this were strength, we would haven't given that much. Not saying it isn't welcome, but you are foolin' yourself if you think the little bit of action we have seen says we are heading for $400, or that we couldn't give this all up and be back at $330 next week at this time. When we have a day on above average volume (say, 25% above), and the price at the end of the day is the high price of the day, that will be strength, and yeah, this stock may finally be out of the doldrums."
My Stock is held by Computer Sharethey say I need to go through my Brokrage and they hv to sign a paper for me to even touch or hv info on my account. Then they can’t tell me who the Broker is?

Undervalued. Buy now until the analysts finally read the COVID bill and realize that LMT will be funded by government contracts for the following years.
"Like usual, the established Wall St gamblers considering themselves cunning criminals are risking their jobs and health for a quick buck because they think this is a great value trap and democrats always cut defense spending. And like usual, they are wrong plus they end up trapped and having to cover when they least expect it.Meanwhile we get good bargains in this name!"
Going down from here...
"LMT increases the dividend by $0.20/share per quarter to $2.60/share ($10.40/yr). Now yields 2.69 %. But the better part is that they are adding $1.3B to their stock repurchase plan. You know.......when you increase your dividend and your buyback it's not because you think the future looks bad. This stock is going MUCH higher but you need to have a little patience to get thru the election ""mess"" that will likely happen. GLTA"
LMT is up 5.08% to 302.57
This stock should be @ $290. What's Up?

"This is priced same as it was on March 26, 2020, when the markets were deep in the pandemic crash. Really silly at this point for a large tech company flooded in good news."
I’m going to make the bold prediction that from this point LMT is going to rally to 330 where it will hit some resistance.
LMT reached an all time high at 399.00

Drop on good news.? Okay I guess. What happened to that short squeeze?
Dividend has been increased to $2.20/share for the fourth quarter per investor relations page on the LMT website.

What is WRONG with this stock???? Is it cost, is it debt, is it concerns over a lower defense budget, competition from Boeing? Can anyone shed some light on why this keeps going down, because it's NOT just the BEAR market we're in......LMT has been going down for a year. Thanks for the insights."

This stock is massively oversold. There are a lot of posts expressing concern about the dems winning both Ga senate seats. Even if that happens (which I think is unlikely) this stock can still do well. It doubled during the 8 years under Obama and if you want Tesla type returns you shouldn't be here anyway. You should be using this stock as a steady defensive investment that will pay a steady dividend and be more valuable 5years from now
Let?s be honest this will be $500+ one day and you?ll go #$%$ I should have bought or bought more... #$%$ it could even go to 600 in next 8
there will come a day when LMT doesnt lose 1% of its value. i just know it.
"LMT down again; down 1.25 ,,,,,how does it feel all you fat capitalist pigs? LOL"
Falling hard every day now...looks like pricing in a Biden Win with defense cuts which are not going to happen. BUY BUY BUY the dips.
What happened today?
What !? No war !
Rocket???? UP...
"congrats to jack aka as captain dumdum to your promotion to general dumdum. it was not easy and took some posting a lot of stupid ideas, stupid conspiracy theories, a lot of stupid ""what if"" scenarios, and a lot of anti-American posts but if anyone deserved the promotion you have shown it was well deserved"
THE DEFENSE STOCK RALLY IS OVER !!!!
"I am concerned about this ' irrational exuberance'. Be careful about what you're wishing for. And be cautious, there could be an 'irrational big' drop coming. When?.....I don't know. It could be tomorrow or sometime in the future. My take: LMT is going too well that it is scary."
@Tricky Sorry but where are you getting your info from. Stock is up like 50% for the year. There was no Plummet in February after previous stock sale and there will not be one this time either.
@Hajir....what is it that you don't understand about having an order backlog of $150B?
the market sure hates profitable companies that are increasing cash flow and dividends.
Marilyn - I am crying in my coffee this morning. Will you please tell us what is going on ? Why is this stock dropping like a rock ?
what a day up down up down up down.. finish super strong. I need a drink
so China sanction on LMT has no effects? how. it must be japanese steal Chinese rare earth..... hahaha. would come back when it is 5% return at $180.... would I see it this year?
LMT by a length over BA who has NOC right on em!
What's the opportunity cost of owning LMT?
Expect a hot day for LMT- could even gain 1 %!!!!!
"The day they ever pull plug on F35, see you at 200 easy.."
2% wee
we are a’ flying today lol
Fire all BLK and Vanguard money managers:You lag behind index and active money managers: bid up LMT fast so that you can catch up other active money managers>
"Already given up half of what it popped up with today. Sadly, typical."
This drop on good news doesn't make any sense. The amount of good news on this one.
"That concern may be unwarranted because Democratic and Republican administrations have supported enormous defense budgets over the years and the world is growing more dangerous, with potential nuclear threats from Iran, North Korea, and other players. Lockheed manufactures the world's top-selling defense systems, and it's hard to imagine the United States and allies forgoing purchases of that expensive equipment in coming years."
"LMT continue to have new business contracts and good news such as upgrades, on top of earning beat by a good margin, but the stock has been down by 50 points, something like -17% since earning beat announcement. This is totally ridiculous and absurd, to say the least!!!RTN did a little better, down by a little less than 15%,JUST A LITTLE BETTER!When small investors finally give up. The whole group are gonna fly for sure... The house always the do old trick, and the old trick almost always works. Amazing!..."
"as a Dividend investor I am interested but Valueline chose Boeing of which I have $864,000 position another $400k elsewhere. i want those approaching retirement consider div investing. $10k each qtr not touching your equity. 2 pensions a fat SS checm. Its a beautiful thing"

Bought at $412.80 hope I don’t regret it
"Oh, oh, the giant is awakening!"
Yes Eddie but no dividend.... Every one here interests in dividend.... You know any company that grows like LMT and pays well dividend... And the share price is cheap... Thank you.
"Some reasons I invested in Lockheed Martin today:- This is a stock that will grow dividends for years as they've done at the past (40% payout ratio)- The return on equity of this company is phenomenal- The outlook of the stock looks better after q2 earnings, they predict even better earnings than before for the year- Public spending post coronovirus will increase. There are many reason for this. US government has to do it with Boeing in order to keep them on business and Lockheed will take a huge advantage of this. - The more China grows the more the N.A.T.O will spend (read Ray Dalio's analysis on that and you'll find out some elements), as such Lockheed will take advantage of new orders that will come. Defense is a space where USA has a competitive advantage against China and will drive it for the next decade- The company is very well diversified and positioned for a space boom that might come this and the following decades- My conservative discounted cash flow for this stock shows that the fair value of the stock is 433$ with a beta of 1. However, I believe that the stock has a realistic beta of way below 1 (check Zack's historic beta) when market conditions are not that volatile which make the fair value of the stock a lot higher. P.G. Others pay for this analysis, I give it out for free."
"Just how bad LMT stock has performed:Coming into today, shares of the aerospace and defense company had lost 1.68% in the past month. In that same time, the Aerospace sector gained 9.08%, while the S&P 500 gained 2.71%."
Boeing is happy today.
I'm surprised the earnings weren't brought down by the Sikorsky acquisition. That plant is full of people getting paid very well to work 3 hours a day!
ARK may be adding today. Big volume.
Not a good day to sell

"If you read the latest Barrons article it talks about some concerns with Covid delays and technical issues around the F-35 simulator training schedule going out further. This is likely what is bothering the street. However the bigger point in the same article says ""When the F-35 eventually does get the full-rate green light, production is expected to ramp up to 170 by 2022 from 123 in 2020.""No problem.......I can wait for a 40% increase in F-35 production by 2022. The street will notice this in 2021."
LMT will touch 380 by 29 Jan. Best stock to buy during this time

Lockheed! And the dividend is great.

this stock is a buy!!it is cheap right now.its going higher and upgrade is coming.great company that will continue to grow.go long and make some cash
I told myself I would load the boat at $350. But honestly this thing can continue to tank...
"I don't know why this wasn't posted on Yahoo - I found it on the LMT website - as predicted:BETHESDA, Md., Sept. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Lockheed Martin Corporation [NYSE: LMT] board of directors has authorized a fourth quarter 2018 dividend of $2.20 per share, representing an increase of $0.20 per share over last quarter. The dividend is payable on Dec. 28, 2018, to holders of record as of the close of business on Dec. 3, 2018."

"With the easing of tensions with North Korea and the upcoming trade talks between USA and China, is ""peace"" breaking out ? The easing of tensions does not bode well for LMT. But I do see tensions rising between Israel and Iran but this should have little effect on LMT stock."
Would you guys suggest buying into this?
Look at Raytheon go... Sigh.
Paying out more in divy than they're earning. Sell.
"Dozen newest reactions here are spam. I report them as copyright violations, sure it doesn't matter. Wanted to see comments about today's LMT movement. My purchase 4 weeks ago looked like a bargain at the time. Finally in the black again. Could sell and wait for the next shoe to drop, or hold on long term for eventual new highs. Gotta be an optimist these days."
Does anyone have any clue what has caused the stock to drop so much in the last couple of days. Is this a delayed reaction to something in the Leidos/ISGS deal or is there something else going on?
Need a good earnings report out of this crew.
"Despite recent price volatility as is for other stocks, the long term outlook of LMT is excellent. I’m in it for the dividend growth mostly so I’m not worried about the price, but you can’t keep the price down while it’s constantly increasing its revenues and earnings."

"LMT is incredibly cheap here. P/E under 14, price to sales 1.45, EV/EBITDA 10.32, free cash flow yield 6.86%. Not to mention the dividend is very enticing and they have more than adequate cash flow per share to support a much bigger dividend. I bought LMT this morning and will buy if it goes down further. This stock trades significantly below fair value and the fundamentals support that. I expect this stock to trade in the 400-500 range over the next 3 to 5 years. Smart people are buying here."
Wish I knew why this stock is still dropping. Makes no sense.
When would be a good time to buy shares?
https://smallcapsdaily.com/lobe-sciences-a-hidden-gem-in-the-psychedelics-research-space/
Cheap. I might as well buy more right before the dividend
lands huge contract and it's down?
"Another $12.5B of ""potential"" F35 training and munitions approved for Finland and a buyout of hypersonic for an undisclosed sum from Integration Innovations (of Huntsville AL). Both good moves for LMT."
"Thoughts from a novice… IMHO I think this correction is normal, as in the earlier higher price probably includes the earnings. Therefore, it’s now like back to base/starting and it will continue to climb to $400+, as projected by some major analysts. I think I see the same pattern with some of the others e.g. MSFT, TSlA… their prices were moving up and up… til the announcements. If there’s some truth in my observation, then we might see a similar drop with AAPL. I just added a small amount of LMT and I think it could meet a resistance at around $380. Basically, there’s nothing seriously wrong with LMT. Also, the insider sell off is normal? Thanks."
mute Joel everyone do yourself a favor
Good to see a selloff in LMT. Buyer at 3% yield
This stock is being played like an old Fender!
Buy at $350
How can the average Joe buy LMT stock at these high prices? And the same goes for the other defense companies. Perhaps the defense companies are waiting for the other guy to do a split and then the others will follow.
Dump before earnings...sell on news people
This stock is still oversold and undervalued
I've got a sell order GTC+ext for $390. I think we will get there sooner rather than later.

"Sadly, expected the drop. I don't think that $320 was the bottom for the year.... Still thinking it's $300. Oh well, futz."
this thing is bear flagging hard
Still saying 330 on earnings at this rate.
This new Discussion Board sucks! Yahoo can you please revert to the old format?
"Lockheed wouldn't have a cash flow problem if they funded their pension every year 100%. Instead, funding of the pension was deferred to allow execs to get their management incentive plan which is tied to stock price. The two easiest ways to do this is stock buybacks and defer funding the pension. Guess what. Both tactics were used."
Seems like there are lot of unanswered questions surrounding the spin off.Leads me to believe disclosure may have been lacking.
another form 4 insider received 500 shares sold 200. Nice Bonus for the Hard work. I bet we see more contracts before Earnings
Only 6.5% ^ until $400... %^ )
how much you lose
Good luck tomorrow guys. Hoping this thing pops
Revenue beat and an earnings miss. Stock movement will depend on what is said in the CC at 11 am. I'm surprised (and wrong) on the EPS miss. I was close on the revenue beat. We'll see what happens after the open and the CC.
Buy the dip!
"And today the ""insider sales "" don't matter. See how this works???"
straight down with s and p up 20 handles. seems market thinks biden is going to win
"half time market update:If markets keep moving this way, market may be back to confirmed uptrend in IBD sense.In fact, ANET hit new high yesterday with defense stocks NOC/LMT stayed cool when market was in jittery, which seems to give active investors a strong buy signal well before robo-machines could tell.See you guys at 10000 meter sky!"
why dropping?
Do you know there is a replacement model for F-22? Which company will build this replacement?
investing in War can be very profitable as we all darn well know. i am bullish on War stocks.
"WOW! Typical ""kneejerk"" reaction! Now is the time to buy some more!"
Yes rumor is Lockie Martin has UFO technology reports will be released in June
Such a fraudulent Wall Street... What basis do they really select the stocks....??? TSLA at 1 trillion market cap and LMT at 90 B.... Lesser than or equal to no-name EV makers.... Ridiculous.... There should really be some investigation.....Doesn't make any logical sense.
Lockheed Martin is down 9.60% to 322.68
"FYI.....there is a ""Shareholder Rights Act"" on the ballot for LMT upcoming meeting. The same act won a 47% vote last year but didn't get the required 51% majority. This may be moving the stock. I plan to vote ""FOR"" the act. GL"
This pig is going down the tubes.

Who said like bonds?
....making up for not funding the pension are killing the financials
Funny Government does not regulate how Grocery Chains monopolize the market place? One chain owning several Stores under different names-but they guard their interests in Defense Industry? Why is this different?Please do tell.
"why the price dropped a lot even after upgrades, no logic at all"
LMT and Tesla are the same price. WHAT to make of this?
Helluva reversal
This bad boy Wants to go lower and lower. Anyone knows why?
LMT is down -4.91% to 341.00
Up nice but still no tesla. I feel like I am dating a women my mom wants me to date but i really want sexy tesla but i cant bring her home to meet the family.
There is a huge Lockheed Martin building tucked away where I live in a valley. I want to drive up there and see how fast they pull some guns on me. For that reason I am buying
I just accumulated my position and Lockheed Martin and Raytheon both are great by oversold just got out of Google and Amazon :-) have to play it safe :-)
Seems like there’s a never ending supply of shares that just keeps hitting the market day after day..
TRUMP committed to 750 billion defense budget.
"Hey, is there any way to find out how much steel is in each of the Lockheed fighters? Does anyone know how the trump steel tarrifa will affect lockheed? any help would be appreciated"
why on Robinhood its showing down ?
Hey why no recent comments??Just sound of Crickets??Pray everybody is holding up out there. I am in Southern California in the Inland Empire. The Virus is now just beginning to hit here. I thank God everyday-that I hv the Food-Shelter-and some funds to even worry about! There are so many out there that could hardly mk it from one payday to the other. Hope we all get over the Blaming Game and just concentrate on helping Our Country! I am not a Trumpster-not sure of any of these politicians! However if there is just a few things left in our Stockpile-we need to dust the stuff off and save our First Responders.!. We can and will Re-Build our Stockpiles after this.

Can’t believe I missed this one. Was looking at it yesterday morning but when I saw it had a dead cat bounce I forgot about it. The options were so freaking cheap yesterday. Damn damn damn.
You guys think LMT will nail their ER?
"Thank you Todd for the reply...after did some research, I learned that I can invest in the mutual fund... Which fund has a high yield percentage and provide dividend as well? Once again, thank you for your time and advice...."
ouch! my dividend today..
To the moon...
Wow such brilliant advice out today all coming from people who have been praying for a better price to get in!
Will this company give a split?
The drop is parallel to NOC. From over $360 high down to low $300. Iran and Israel should do something to help all defense stocks up.
"That’ll teach Lockheed to beat earnings and raise guidance! Take that, the markets yell!"
Spam go away. LMT is one of my favorite gems.
Nothing to defend against. Who needs this company?
To many VPs!
Hoping for a pullback so I can get in on this. War isn’t hell for everyone
Hopefully the stock drops another 45 percent tomorrow
FYI.....Goldman Sach upgraded LMT today 9/1/20 at 3;00 pm. Price target $501. That's good enough for me to add shares. It's on MT Newswires.
"Wow, another hefty age discrimination verdict - over $50M. This behavior has also spread to subsidiaries, notably ULA. Just a matter of time..."

"US military is only going downhill, and so is the crown jewel of defense stocks"
Surprised that no one here mentioned the news story on Monday about China sending 25 warplanes into Taiwan's air defense space. Better get those F-35's over there quickly.

"Lockheed Martin secures $558.84M Navy contract modificationMar. 12, 2021 6:06 PMLockheed Martin Corporation (LMT)By: Akanksha Bakshi, SA News EditorLockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) has been awarded a ~$558.84M fixed-price-incentive and cost-plus-incentive-fee modification to exercise options under previously awarded contract for Trident II (D5) missile production and deployed systems support.Work to be performed in multiple locations; and is expected to be completed Sept. 30, 2026"
Will LMT split soon?
"This is going to send LMT higher, than TSLA and all FANG-stocks together:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin_Compact_Fusion_Reactor"
will this rise to 420 in a few months?
"Hewson: ""military too strong"". Huh ? Egad ! that statement will hurt."
"Would love to see Lockheed expand its business model to include products defense systems used by other US defense companies like Boeing, Northrop -Grumman and Raytheon. Defense 'business' is where you find it. I would think everyone would benefit, from the US government, various military services, as well as Lockheed."
3.35% ^ to 400...%^ )
the price at this level is definitely a gift!grab it
"7/08/20 to 7/21/20 total 13 days, each day avg 5.0$, total drop $65.0.currently $350.0 - $65.0 = $285.0.after 7/22/20 LMT stock price will drop to $150.0 like BA drop to $90.0"
this will cross 360 tomorrow....so last chance to buy at this price today
Boeing dragged LMT way down
What's the deal with this stock? Receiving very large contracts on a daily basis but the stock continues on a downward trend. What's up with that?
"Hi Kate. Is this your first rodeo? People make lots of money INVESTING in good stocks, and buy on weakness. Just a reminder for others who listen to the pajama crowd, way too much."
Going down...going down!!!!
I posted (3 times) the reason why LMT went down on Friday and my post got deleted by YF all 3 times. Don't know what happened to free speech. I was just sharing the news about Saudi Arabia. How do you all feel when you know that your news is getting filtered as to what they want you to see and not see?
"All you ""Biden dippers"" should research defense spending and budget deficits during Dem pres terms, and while you're at it, perhaps civic dynamics."
What is going on with LMT? Thinking of adding to my position here. Why does it keep trending down?
Marietta Georgia workforce is going to strike. F-35 production going to be effected.
Any thoughts on why LMT is down so much after hours? I haven’t seen any news.
Has anyone seen what Biden’s plan is for defense spending?
"After witnessing all of the turmoil caused in the likes of GameStop and now potentially silver, Is a high share price, or previously high price, a good thing as insulation against speculative day traders?"

wth!!! how !why?
"Sorry longs, another tax cut means there’s no money for the defense budget."
down $3. WHAT A POS STOCK.
Shares outstanding:2017 - 284 million 2016 - 2892015 - 3062014 - 314The question becomes how much did buybacks contribute to earnings and what happens to earning if the buybacks are not sustained.

Why is this stock down so much lately?
A work force shortage is developing. Employees will soon be in the drivers seat. Companies are paying to get talent now in an effort to be staffed for the $75 BILLION coming down the pipeline in the next two year. This is in addition to the current funding.
Hottest defense aviation stock on the market. Now a space contract. LMT getting sexy!

Hello 350 nice to see you again it’s been too long.
Hewson and other lmt executives sold some of their shares. Is this a warning sign to get out? There may be a big drop today and into next week.
bout time!......I think cos Buffet hyped it.
"I believe with Democrats controlling the White House and both legislative branches, defense stocks will have a difficult two-year period at least until the next mid-term election. Hopefully, by then Republicans can take back one of the legislative branches. However, at current price levels, LMT, NOC, RTX, GD and the like are going to be attractive to long term investors and fund managers. These are good bets for your retirement accounts if you have 5 - 10 years to wait until you need to draw on the proceeds. This world is not a better place than a year ago. Russia is a constant threat; Iran is in the mix; China, above all, is the biggest threat because their military technology (some might have been stolen from the US) is quickly catching up to ours. I don't care who's in the White House or which party controls our government, it'd be foolish not to continue to invest in and upgrade our military. With the backlogs these guys have, I would not worry too much holding shares. Remember, the only stocks that performed well and appreciated during the great depression were defense stocks. If this COVID thing lingers and even if it doesn't and economy tanks because of it, these defense stocks will the sanctuary most sane and savvy investors will be looking for."
Started at position at $378.01 a couple weeks ago. Added at $375 Friday and $371 today. 150 shares each time so I am not big in LMT in case I need to buy more in the $360 range. What I am missing? Are people getting concerned about the election? I know manufacturing could slow down because of parts but the stock was at $419 not that long ago. It seems like a good value but keeps trading poorly. Thoughts?
nice move today......probably off of the goodbye bernie

"Excerpt from the Barrons article:Lockheed Martin ( LMT Loading...Loading...) might be the safest way to play space. It owns 50% of ULA, which has more than 130 successful missions under its belt. The company recently agreed to purchase rocket-parts maker Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings ( AJRD Loading...Loading...) for about $4.4 billion. Lockheed can make satellites, too, and is an investor in Rocket Lab. It may be one of the largest, most complete space franchises.Investors might think of Lockheed as ""old space,"" with only the government as a customer. But the convergence of government and commercial is happening, meaning that Lockheed will have the same opportunities as some of the hottest start-ups.That doesn't mean the stock will trade like a space stock. ""The Aerojet deal was nice,"" says Dan Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus. ""But Lockheed is still a defense franchise.""Defense stocks haven't gotten much love of late. Investors have been nervous about budget deficits and Democratic control of the executive and legislative branches, which could mean less military spending. Lockheed shares have dropped about 9% over the past six months, even as the S&P 500 has gained 18%.That fear may be overstated. ""Since World War II, there has been no relationship between military spending and [ budgetary] economics,"" Aboulafia tells Barron's. ""Defense is driven by threat and politics, that's all.""Morgan owns shares. He believes he's buying a great business at a low price. Lockheed shares trade for just 13.6 times estimated 2021 earnings of $26.34 a share, a big discount to the market's 22.6 times multiple. If the stock can trade at a price/earnings ratio of 20, roughly in line with its recent discount to the S&P 500 valuation multiple, shares would fetch about $500, up more than 40% from recent levels. Lockheed has an attractive dividend yield, too, at about 3%. ""I'm getting paid to wait,"" adds Morgan. He's expecting good things."
Waiting for the next sell off!!!
"LMT acquistion is great. Being a California (LA) company employing thousands. LMT purchased it so progressive house reps in the district/state will not vote for military cuts or they lose thousands of jobs.It's also a huge Space Play, which is the future not General dynamics 1940s navy ships."

"LMT could win a $10T contract and the price wouldnt budge.All mgmt can do is buy back stock and increase dividends, and just keep making money."
And we were at 358 on this day 3 years ago

Hi DD... Would you please pray for the price drop to less than $200 per share? Thank you
y'all better get some Kratos. KTOS
"Ok, why the 6 dollar drop after hours? That's way two bearish from even my perspective..."
"Because of a little disappointment in the earnings. the wimps get out. Aw, too bad."
Looks like the consolidation/correction and bottom are behinds us now.
"LMT buys Aerojet, a brilliant move by Lockhead. Skeptics now could not deny that LMT will rule the outer space, not Elon Mask, this will make LMT to fly..good price, good acquisition, right time and right price..https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/20/2148289/0/en/Aerojet-Rocketdyne-to-be-Acquired-by-Lockheed-Martin-in-5-0-Billion-All-Cash-Transaction.html https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/20/2148289/0/en/Aerojet-Rocketdyne-to-be-Acquired-by-Lockheed-Martin-in-5-0-Billion-All-Cash-Transaction.html"

"Holy Share Price, Batman!!!"
close to 2021 highs b4 Q1 earnings
I don't understand how any of the elements in play are effecting LMT's recent declines.
Things looking up...
Ark invest has now purchased this two days in a row. You got my attention!
Uh oh
"LMT makes stuff that kills people, children, elderly=y and ladies. All investors should completely abandon LMT. Secondly Biden is very old and fragile. He is a kinder man. Peace loving. He will cut the tail of LMT. For that matter Trump is also a peace loving ex president."
"Today 3/15 is one of those days where you ask yourself.....""Is this the turn""? Volume was higher than normal on very strong price performance . We needed to clear $346 and we did. Next resistance is $350, if we clear that .....there's a whole lot of technicals to say this is going higher. If we can't clear $350 in the next 5 trading days we go back into the $330's. GL"
If some of the commenters in here say that LMT is a great buy then why isn't the stock going up ?
Could it be Trump is going to go after defense spending to pay for his tax cuts for the top 5%?
Lmt was downgraded to neutral from buy by Baird this AM. Funny downgrade at these levels.... but they were bullish above $400?
"Good article on the F35http://www.todayonline.com/business/lockheed-f-35-jets-ace-exercises-us-readies-combat-use""Davis says the F-35s are doing far better in combat exercises than expected, achieving so-called ""kill ratios"" of 24 to zero, and surviving every sort of simulated enemy attack.""It is like watching a velociraptor going through. Everything in its path is killed,"" he told reporters.""Comments like this can't hurt future sales."
"think this way, LMT has orders from many but not able to deliver,because LMT has no rare earth from China. China is the only source for the rare earth. no any other place."
2021 guidance is $26 a share. That puts forward PE at 13... I’d buy more if I could. Longterm winner.
Not a big holing. But I bought 45 shares today at $333.50Will add 5 shares more every $5 drop till I get my 100 shares. This is a solid company and recession proof. Good luck to all.
"Has Lockheed learned a lesson from Boeing in how ‘bean counters’ can ruin a company? Bean counters add very little value to a company, producing little to nothing, and make poor decisions for which they aren’t qualified to make."
Somebody must know something we don't with this stock still going down. Makes no sense.
Just hope we had nothing to do with killing of Nuclear Scientists!!Just hv a funny feeling on that. Now another of our Defense Personal has resigned! Trump is up to something behind the scene.Stimulus I think I read will be for Small Businesses and more Corporate-they are trying to cut that Woping $1200 to everyone..How can they call it a Stimulus-when people just need to get food and pay bills. People are so under by now!! Just the Big Wigs are making big $$$ during Pandemic!Insider Trading etc... Poor Martha Stewart. She must be really #$%$to see our Government Officials knowing when to sell off and when to buy!!!???. #$%$ Show and how any of our Government can look at themselves in the mirror after seeing masses of cars in food lines is just barbaric!!Then be able to manipulate the Stock Market-so regular people can?t invest like normal and lose what we had!?. They do it so Bold and right in our Faces!!Ok... going to Decorate my Little Tree and be grateful I hv a roof over it. Pray that Food Lines get what they need. Pray are Barbaric Government get what they deserve.???????
with RTX solid numbers reported and strong backlog. That will feed the LMT fire today! Should be a nice Green Day and would like to see LMT start the next bull run to that price target of $450!
I love it... Keep dropping please.... So I buy more shares before the EX-Date for the dividend...
Red721... How much it would be if the dividend is 4%?
Dearth of pre earnings news releases.
Even a measly 5% up day will change this stock and cause the irrational shorts to re-evaluate their long-term gamble this blue chip.
are they not going to move it until after conference call?
"Wow, a 15 dollar pop! Haven't seen that from this stock in a looonnnnggg time! If we hang on to it, I'll be a tiny bit hopeful we hit $400 by the end of the year. (Now I've jinxed it! ;-)"
Start buying!!!
Belgium chooses F35 over Euro fighter. More deals ahead
"Buy +-325 USD, buy 290++ (low 300) USD was my plan. I can not see LMT at my broker.Anyone also has a broker that doesn't offer LMT shares? :-/ Goodluck my friends.It will go up in the next 12 to 18 months about 50%."
"The mayfly traders buy and sell LMT and other defense stocks based on the perceived ups and downs of NKorea, etc. It’s silly unless you’re a day trader."
why going on good news?
Has LMT performed well in the past 10 yrs? from 12/ 10 to now?anyone?
"Going down @ any market conditions, wow!"
The giant has just opened its eyes
"Another ""new"" contract for $2.8B for guided missiles . At some point this stuff has got to add up to some very strong revenue and profit growth."
Whoever doesn't buy today will miss out. When the next time it will be this low? Only one will tell. Earnings in 10 days.
Lockheed martin contract! $LMTSGLB only 8 million shares vs $DDD which has 120M shahresSGLB to 30+
This stock is so sick that never split.
I'm going to buy in LMT after the price get down $10
Why are we going down. What do we have to do with Boeing?
As the cat bounces....
Thoughts about that 16 billion pentagon deal? Looks doubtful it will be in debt even if LMT gets on it.
"These stocks jump up out of nowhere. Stay course, rotation alone will come around."
It looks like Wall Street is betting on Biden win?
Any Europeans or Germany here who bought this recently? My depot is at Lynx which runs on Interactive Brokers and my buy orders for LMT and RTN are currently getting denied because supposedly LMT used ammunition that is internationally frowned upon. I can't find any info on such a ban via Google. Very annoying. Greets from Germany.
"Yay, we are above $330! Oh, wait, we were above $350 two weeks ago, never mind...."
"Continued weakness since earnings call, what gives?"
Broad market vertigo
I am amazed that LMT still alive considering F35 having so many defects. I read somewhere years ago LMT should be bankrupted due to poorly designed F35. It is a shrink version of USA. printing more money to surive
"re: tender lmt for ldos at 10% discount. can someone explain? it looks like ldos shareholders as of aug 15 are getting a special dividend of $13.64. ex-dividend date is aug 17. this looks like about a 28% dividend. so won't the ldos stock price be reduced on aug 17 to reflect dividend? this is the same date as the lmt/ldos exchange. stockbroker tells me that the share price will be average of aug 13-15 and the exchange will take place on aug 17. so, doesn't that mean that the 10% discount is really a losing proposition since the share price will go down about 28% on aug 17."
stock is hitting it's stride from all of it's early cycle capexit should also benefit greatly from Trump's re-election.
These people that continue to sell must be very stupid!
Lockheeed (LMT) Outperforming Boeing (BA) today. I own BOTH. Cheers everyone! They’re both GREEN in my portfolio.
People must think this is a Boeing company
"I've noticed a sad trend with this stock (which I own too much of), Each time that they've had good or really good quarter (which is most of the time), they always follow up with ""but the future looks bleak"".... Which totally over shadows any gains that might have been had from the good earnings, and the stock drops. Tesla is just the opposite, they go, ""not as good as we hoped, but just wait until next year!"" and the stock goes bananas. Go figure."
Believe LMC
Lookout below!
Any of the recent contract awards a surprise? I think most were strongly anticipated since response to RFP.
of course when I finally buy...
LMT and NOC are the ones to watch for on the NATO issue. GD and BA less so. Why? What toys are they short of?

STOCK MANIPULATION SCAM - This stock should be close to $300.
"On LMT (Lockheed Martin) I would put a 12 month price target of 430+ USD.I am hardly ever bullish on stocks, especially dividend paying stocks, but this one is grossly undervalued still.It might make a dip below 300 if the market tanks, to my opinion that is just another opportunity.-- I can't buy this -- (broker and bank do not offer this stock) This is just my opinion, I am no financial advisor."
bouncing back and forth ...375-400
"@ Eric: I agree with you that LMT stock has peaked. My biggest regret was not selling, back in mid-February, when the share was $357. At that time, my gut feeling was telling me to sell. But I am staying in hoping that it gets back to $357, although I am extremely doubtful that it will."
Thank you Tennis Guy for your time... By any chance you folks know an Android app that estimate the return in the Roth IRA investment? Thank you.

"The great demand of F35 is going to drive this stock soaring high. Because the rising threat from China and Russia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and many country including US are in great demand of this cutting edge stealth joint fighter.

One week until earnings
"Goldman upgraded LMT today, but the stock went down big today. This is troubling. When analysts can not boost the stock price, it usually hides some negative forces. In other words, when analysts say ""buy"", you may consider ""sell"". This is a sad lesson."
The last of u muppets out sheesh
Boeing stock price is running laps around LMT. Enough said.
Time to buy!
Might be a good time to buy defense stocks. Trump made it clear to NOT threaten the USA again. Apparently Iran doesn’t understand English or can’t hear. I give it a 95% chance there will be an attack
can someone save LMT from China sanction?
"Continuous buying, waiting for that pop bound to happen to 400+."
Ho ho ho.... Looks like war is coming.. LMT Sky rocket soon
Why is this POS stock price falling?
Finally got rid of Ulmer- beautiful!! Had to kick him upstairs to get him out of the way. Lets see if the chick can straighten things out. Hope it’s not just a lib woke move and she’s got balls
Crazy this thing doesn't trade higher. Price target is like $430 with Morningstar. This thing is so powerful in America it damn near runs the government.
Sell this cow
Hopefully no afternoon beat down today.
I've posted several comments on here in the past few days but they are nowhere to be seen. What's up ?
"Defense budget cuts are looming as the coronavirus pandemic places pressure on the federal budget across various agencies.The Pentagon had already been expecting relatively flat budgets for the next few years due to economic constraints caused by the widening deficits in the country.But with the pandemic, the deficit is projected to explode after Congress passed trillions of dollars in coronavirus relief packages, with more aid bills expected. Defense budget analysts are predicting that will mean cuts to defense spending down the line."
"Lmt will self heal Q1 2019 and perpetuate through 2022, trailing PE is currently poor due to withheld payments Q3, Q4 2017. Forward PE is normalizing (14.25) in past interest environment of 6.6%, under funded pension was corrected with 25% tax savings and is no longer issue. New accounting rules for reporting profit will be favorable going forward with current Large sales. Helio business future production contracts will replace entire fleets in F-35 type single platform, Div will steadily increase. Good buy and hold with Div compounding thru 2022. Beyond that is dependent on Politics and Defense Spending. Current contracts ramp down 2022 thru 2024."
"More orders of F16 is coming from South America, Asia, and Africa..."
Cannot understand why it's going down?
5 bucks says we end up where we started today. Sigh.
Looks like rotations into Tech. Will come back to LMT. Not worried.
"Russia and China are spending very heavily on their military, we must keep up our spending as well or risk being surpassed by them."
"Yeah, I'm watching you...."
"I think this stock will pop at bit after the start of the year. Right now, money managers are selling their loser stocks to be able to book capital losses. They will sell their overvalued gainers after the start of the new tax year and then put that money into undervalued stocks like LMT."
Both about to rip $lmt $lhx
Real shame is- there is no foreseeable catalyst to the upside. Market shrugged the Ivy leaguer upgrades rite away
Today LMT reports quarterly results before opening bell.Lets see what they reports and how the market reacts.
What a POS stock. It's going to spiral down from here. I knew it. I knew it.
KH announced and bottom falls out of the day?!?!?
Buzz off spammer. I was so bummed to see the markets tank in 1Q March. So glad to buy more defense stocks LMT NOC and my Raytheon now RTX.
"REUTERS — Taiwan reports new incursion by Chinese jets into defence zone. In the latest incident, Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said four Chinese J-16 and four J-10 fighters were involved, as well as an early warning plane and anti-submarine aircraft, the latter of which flew to the south of Taiwan through the Bashi Channel that connects the Pacific to the South China Sea.$LMT $BA $RTX $GE"
"it doesn't look like jackB wants to discuss his dumb comments. what about the other stooge r-1901 weighing in about the ""Martha stewart SEC comparisons""?"
Epic fail. Unless this is brand ESG. This thing will melt down. Fundamentals be damned its almost entirly owned by institutions.
If Spacex starship does all it is intended then the SLS technology will go the way of the dodo. In the future only reusable rockets will be used. You cant afford to throw away $1-2B for each rocket.
The time to BUY is now. No more bashing. Price and time is right. Lets go LMT! Going Long.
Ex-div $2.00/share on Friday. Paid Sep 28. Increase next quarter to $2.20?
"I'm very positive on LMT both fundamentally and technically. With that said, resistance is at 341.35 the high from last Friday. RSI is still okay but looking a bit tired. HUGE gap between 315 and 333 that needs to be filled; should LMT start back filling I would buy all the way down to 315. I had been accumulating below 300; I've been waiting for a pull back in the low 300s which never happened but I'm sitting here happy. Just waiting for a pull back (maybe) to the 315 range. If not, I'm hanging on for a new 52 week high ... heck if war breaks out, all defense stocks are going to rocket up: LLL, NOC, RTN and maybe even BA!!"

Bulls Love AMR 
5 MIL G?!? idk #$%$ that is but is the future!!
"What's going on ? It""s coming down!"
Time to buy some more shares. LMT will continue to grow.
Stocks are like Vegas... and life... it is all a Gamble. Like it is no surprise that the Stock Market is really run by High Rollers that can manipulate very well.Hell I am still in shock that Boeing still has it’s doors open! So after Trump got in-think my shock radar blew a circuit!!
I’m a billionaire and I want those dividends coming up. I need to drive the price down now so I can buy millions of shares at a discount. I’ll send out an article praising LMT afterwards to drive the price back up after my purchase.
Stock analysts are #$%$. It is clear that the recent rise is due to dividend hunting. Hold on to your dividends and sell after dividend date.
Sick of hearing these bots whining about the “stock market bubble.” We’re in a perpetual zero interest rate environment. You can’t get 6% from a t-bill and money has to go somewhere for yield. Of course multiples are going to expand. Get used to it.
"From what I just read the Air Force is in the beginning stages of looking to replace it's older F-16s with a clean sheet advanced fourth generation + or fifth generation - fighter for the fiscal 2023 budget, something that would be cheaper to operate versus the older F-16s that maybe coming closer to the end of their service life. That could lead to opportunities for Lockheed Martin"
"""Flat defense budgets out to 2525"""
why does no one purchase options on Robin Hood for LMT? genuinely curious.
@ Jack: How long do you think LMT will be in bear market territory ?
Bought some more this morning and will continue to buy on this absurd dip! Nevermind LMT continues their buy back program stronger than ever.
"An obscene amount of the ""gadgetry"" (huge cost) in the F-35 is because gomer's on board. Tell me again why we need a ""manned"" machine to carry a couple of JDAMs or 8 or so SDBs internally (horrible payload ""stealthy"") when standoff weaponry can put FAR MODE ""stuff"" on target ? What a total fleecing on the US Taxpayer."
Got good contract but not gain in share price
"I have been very pessimistic about this LMT stock due to the big drop since mid-February. But I do see a big upward tick back to the 350s range in the future. The question is, WHEN does this upward tick begin."
Nice ULA launch of NROL-71 this morning. Beautiful weather here at Vandenberg.
"Major policy shift favoring LMT and others that produce ""MADE IN AMERICA "" products.And the company has been sold and shorted by idiots not understanding the democrats are pro local workers and unions with LMT being one of the largest domestic employers.Talk about gamblers getting it wrong!"
LMT==garbage now~
I purchased LMT back in 2008. I am not going to sell it no matter who is in the White House. A bunch of countries are buying LMT products. I love LMT. As the Bible says a war never stops.
Way oversold yet again
Whoever panic sold during the drops missed out on discounts to accumulate more LMT stock.
The defense stock bubble is starting to bust...starting with LMT. https://moneymaven.io/seanhyman/technical-analysis/lockheed-martin-s-decline-is-likely-the-start-of-the-popping-of-the-defense-stock-bubble-s3ksED68EUuXtGeMdYgU0A/
"Just a few weeks ago, there were quite a few optimistic people in here pushing for 400 a share. You don't hear them now. I think it will drop to 250. And it will go sideways for the next two years, then it will push towards 400. Winning all of these contracts and production will go into full swing during the next two years. After two years, the profits (sales) will begin to pour in. I am quite disappointed as many of you."
"Still absorbing the $4.4B purchase of Aerojet Rocketdyne. The new deal for $4.9B won't drop into their bank account all at once. Buy up now! The only trouble on the horizon that I see is the flailing ULA contract, of which LM has 50% share with Boeing. SpaceX is eating their lunch and it's only going to get worse. How long can the political handouts keep going after Starship starts flying around the moon?"
Interesting how YF does not report the recent headlines about LMT winning a supply deal with Isreal for multi Billions of dollars.
What happenned to the stock price suddenly? PS: The new yahoo message board sucks. Yahoo is an idiot company.

"As one commenter in here noticed several weeks ago that he felt that the last selloff was that he 'institutions' were selling which caused the last sellout of lmt. It may happen again, like now. I am watching closely."
"With talk of likely military action by the Trump administration in the Korean peninsula at some point in the next year will be good for LMT, may get in now as possible growth in the future"

"I feel like I got left holding the bag on this Reverse Morris Trust deal. While those who gave up their LMT stock might have come out okay, those of us who stayed loyal are presently down about $23 per share. (Don't tell me it's just temporary, because no one knows that for sure.) Meanwhile, I'd like to put in my two cents worth about what the company should do with that $1.8 B one-time special payment. The company has stated that it could be used for share buybacks, paying down debt, and/or dividends. While share buybacks might help the stats (and the CEO's bonus), it doesn't do squat for me except in the most theoretical sense. Paying down debt does't make much sense right now because debt is so cheap. Therefore, I'd like to see -- and think we deserve -- a special dividend to be divided among the shareholders at the time of execution of the deal. That would come to about $5,75 a share. Sure, I would have to pay taxes on that money, but that's a lot better than feeling like I got hosed."
Even Korean peninsula is quiet... That is not meant the middle east fronts quiet.... There will be a need for bombing missions at the terrorists cells.... Stock price will go up and always up.... Never worry about bankruptcy
Current share price is way below value right now. Good time to pick up as many shares as you can.
buy LMT with this new defense budget
What a DOG this has been all year! WOOF WOOF! SELL and wait for better price.
Got to be getting close to support levels! Buying this dip. Fundamentals are solid.
Earnings is in 2 weeks (Tuesday Oct 20). Just watch what happens in the next 2 weeks leading up to the ER.
Do i hear  $420
All those house democrats conspiring behind closed doors should be arrested for conspiring a coup with no due process to impeach the president . ... they should also be charged with high crimes against the U.S. the president has an obligation to defend the constitution against foreign and domestic enemies . Adam Schiff should be jailed immediately . How will he prove his innocence when he is found guilty of lying to the American people with intent to create a coup ?
"And if LMT is able to lower the cost, Trump will change his mind, 'Ok,let forget about the F-18s.'"
"Oh, well. Down we go. Not a disaster, but not a reason to party either. I think owning this for the dividend is an OK idea. I don't think it has near-term prospects for huge price appreciation. JMHO."
look at that another green day

Beat earnings with an EPS of $6.08. Nice!
"Trump: We Cut Approximately $600 Million From F-35 (see Bloomberg Video). Finally, we have a real conservative as POTUS, unlike those NeoCon GOP in Congress. Trump will get a better price for a better product for our nation."

I wish to have more cash to add more shares . The most secured investment .
FYI.....MS initiated LMT today with a rating of OVERWEIGHT and a price target of $509. It's on MT newswires.
"In the end - and not long now - this guy is right. The US is basically a paper tiger militarily and is a big pile of debt to boot. It also has thousands of miles of ocean either side of it making it impossible to fight a real war anywhere in the world without going nuclear.Suggest you spend your money making yourselves happy and not making other people miserable.I'll keep LMT for a while until I make a decent return on it, and all my other US stocks, and hope I can run for cover before the whole lot caves in on itself."
One word to describe LMT? Stodgy.
Why lmt is down
"As said, morning time to be the bull trap set up, repeated in last 5 days."
close to 2021 highs/ATH
LOCKHEED to get $3B middle contract. Reuters. Lockheed helicopter flies on Mars. CNBC. Stock is so golden!
"I see this heading to 400 within the next 2 years, secular uptrend in this industry. LMT is the best and the one to own. My opinion"
Layoff's are on the horizon people.
LMT is sanction by the commie China.
"Already outperforming some of my other holdings.... Sweet... Thanks everyone, great board here. Good info,"
$32 billion committed by NATO. This is a huge improvement with these NEW commitments
My guess LMT is the junk since China had sanction on the company. LMT can not make F35 anymore! How to deal with this problem?----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My guess is america needs to learn chinese and eat egg rolls.
Ark is keeping it down
LMT is the Dolly Parton of stocks. Not as sexy as it used to be but still has BIG cans.
"Lockheed Martin is huge, Boys. Buffet would be in this stock but for the fact that War makes Buffet squeamish."
That move today at 1:25 pm is due to the White House approving the sale of LMT F-35's to the UAE. Told you that was coming. The $40/share pull back over the past month will be made up quickly.
"A lot of good LMT news in the market today. Read the news feed, too much to list here. The UAE deal going thru is a BIG deal."
"we might actually see some good movement this week, should have happened at earnings but better late then never"
RSI is over 81 on Daily Chart. Should start seeing pullback this afternoon going into end of next week
"LMT, BA, NOC, RTN...all the big Defense players are down."
"If this gaps down at all, the dividend alone justifies keeping it. You don't know what the next four years are going to look like."
"LMT and NOC are no brainers. I also plan to ride out more gains from RTN until merger with UT is consolidated. I've owned LMT since 2013, and let's just say my gains are enough that I'm quite comfortable. Aerospace and defense industry has many companies ripe for gains and it is booming. Great defensive stocks too. I plan to hold for the long haul and agree with many that LMT is far from through in its stock price ascension."
TSLA is a rare jewel in the bi- polar stock world of automobiles.
"nice earnings, doesnt mean the stock will move, but it is a good value. I hold it just for the 10% divvy raise every year."
We need the F23!!!!!!
You are one of the smart ones ED: THis stock will be at near 280 before the end of January and might even hit 250$ by selling now you can claim your losses for year end and take your money and buy 1/4 more share than what you will have sold for. so if you sold 1000 shares at 350 and buy back in at 250. You can either buy more than a 1000 shares or take the 100G and invest somewhere else and still have 1000 sh aof LMT. You would have missed a divi payment. But overall You would have executed a good plan for your retiremnet. again congratulations on making a very smart move.
Down in Pre-Market..here it goes down the toilet bowl
some posters: next support at $300. also some posters: $343 still rounds down to $300no one knows where this is going but to claim so is ridiculous....same goes for those wacky price targets being published.

Here comes the downward spiral. Oh the humanity.
Purchased quite a bit of LMT (and NOC) when they dropped. I am green but a little disappointed they have not increased a little more. Here is hoping 2021 sees lots of growth.
Time to buy!!! This would be the stock you want when all hell breaks loose.

LMT will be a big winner from Trump's luniac demand for ally's sharing more burden of defense!
"There should be a big war,so Lockheed can sell more stuff"
one of the best stock as per montly.
why does LMT doen't go anywhere? balance sheet looks healthy. don't understand why it doesn't go up? It was above 400 briefly in the year 2019. but came back down after that. any one has insights?
Dear Yahoo please go back to the old format Sully

Down 6 on a poor market up 2 in a great market. Gonna take a long time to overcome that joke CC. Do we really have to pay Hewson a $900 k welfare check the next 2 years. She already cleaned our clock for $95M. Not an engineer just a politician.
There used to be one bastion of the market that remained fairly rational during volatile periods which was defense. And what makes even less sense than this historical point is the fact that production and efficiency is ramping up while the PPS craters with new orders and backlogs galore. Is Mr Market pounding sand again or am I missing something in the bigger picture?
"You bears are so silly. This “dividend aristocrat” gets you back your share price in 15 years or so. Then, you will still own that share, which will then be pumping out over $30 per share annually.. What do you think that share will be worth then? ROI is too high (and too quick) for this to go much lower and is a long term lock."
entire market green at open yet LMT down...Y
LMT cannot hold a candle to the GREAT Boeing! Boeing is more diversified. Boeing has good unions. Boeing has better health care plans. Even Boeing engineers have a union.

"Lockheed, Trump is at the helm now. You better be prepared to cut costs of this plane by at least 50 percent. If this plane cost doesn't come down to 20 million per plane the program is cut."

The friendlier t he North Koreans are the lower Lockheed stock goes.

FYI....a guest called into Mad Money and asked Cramer about LMT. He gave it a HOLD here but if it dips buy more. Next week after earnings when we jump $15/share he will claim that he was right. That's his job......to always look like he was right and has been predicting the outcome all along the way.
Any thoughts on Palantir?

What's going on with LMT stock today?Down almost 8 dollars per share.
All year gains plus have been lost. So sad.
"LMT CEO sold 19,500 shares at 369. may be a sign of things to come? I always have believed that shares given to an employee should be capped at selling 1000 sh per year that way there is no dilution of stock price. Hopefully this will not do that and we maintain a steady growth of 10% for the remainder of the year. IF she actually purchased these stocks then i apologize, You should be able to buy and sell shares at any denomination."

I only see 1.5 billion contract and building for Saudis Arabia.....whole markets down
Win many contract but stock price can not go high to 400. We better draw out our fund to buy TSLA or NIO or ARKW
I guess the market is so busy worrying LMT won’t be selling to China they entirety missed that Saudi Arabia is a big buyer.
3/16----Dow and S&P closed lower and LMT finished green. We will call that a win (for now).
Yahoo shows LMT down $2 after hours. Hope that's accounting the dividend.
How often the dividend increase?

I bought at $341.75 after selling position at $357. Hoping for better results
Meanwhile $LMT is up. No bueno

Trump just fired the secretary of defense. What a lunatic Trump is.
Market will rebound on Monday...so right time to buy and hold for good profit
Green by end of day. 400 by end of next week.
"This stonk is 100% rigged. In the morning, past 5 days, MM is using small amount to pull up the trend and dunk heavy volume at peak, and then repeat. It will help big brothers to escape with less loss. Plus those calls are decaying every day. So MM is winning again too."
"Several posts have expressed frustration with the stock performance which has been underperforming the market and defense sector. There is a prime driver for this and some lesser contributing factors. The good news is that, absent a major market meltdown, the stock should have put in a short term bottom in the 345-348 area. The Covid pandemic is the primary driver. There are hundreds if not thousand's of suppliers that that provide parts for the F35 fighter. For most of the year, analysts were expecting 141 delivered F35s but due to the pandemic, LM will only deliver 123. Wall Street had probably baked in a higher number notwithstanding the pandemic. The good news is that most of the bad news is in the stock and it should resume its upward movement since it put in the intermediate term low last week. I think once analysists believe the worst is over WRT to production, it should be moving again. Long term bullish, short term neutral but given how depressed this stock is, any good news on production and this stock could get back to the 390s fast."
Added $383.75. Thanks.
Seeking Alpha Fair Value 440.
"LMT has been going down now for a while, receives new contracts & it still continues to go down. Why?"
The chart for LMT is looking beautiful
LMT is a steal at this price. Easy money from here. Market is such a scam but a day like today is the time to take advantage of quality stocks like this.
The new sideways...
Good not great as margin erosion plagues two BAs

Don’t forget GD KTOS
Cold War coming versus the CCP :-/
Biden will not cut our Defense. He will be TOUGHER on China than Trump.
"Ok lockheed, stop dropping and go back up."
Dump now...will tank tomorrow...and big time after Biden win..
"Great company. New CEO sounds confident and I like his background, former Military officer! Sounds like he has some interesting ideas to bring to the table. Young investors wasting their money investing in airplanes and such. Companies like LMT are where you should be parking your money. My only regret is not investing in this company sooner. I wouldn’t be surprised if in another 5+ years the price is $500/share-$750/share range On it Biden wins-If the US cuts defensive spending while China and a Russia continue to increase theirs, it’ll be political suicide IMO. Even if so, LMT will still be fine long term. Just more opportunity to buy it at a lower price I guess if it dips!"
any potential splits in this stock?
Why every defense company goes down today?
Seems A&D issues are moving almost inversely to the broad market indexes recently. Probably just coincidental.
LMT is totally underrated. 3% up today ;)
I am torn between taking some profits and just riding this. Nice problem!
Yeah baby!!!    ️
expect profit taking today.
"If DEMS win the elections, does defense stocks like LMT and GD get effected ?How is L3 technoglies?"
For us long time holder this is a pig. Think some fools drive it up tomorrow more than the $2.60 Div- bail at end of day. Will likely be highest price for a long while. Any market correction- a we all know its coming and this pig retraces to 320- don’t think much lower.
Kathy Warden- were are you????? Compare her CC to our goof
Any guess on Monday? $329 or $349?
"That subtle or not so subtle really, signal eluded to earlier may be related to the Russian-based hack has penetrated deep into US national security infrastructure."

Market looking to increased chance of Biden election win and understanding he would gut our national defense and give that national defense budget to illegal aliens and ANTIFA thugs. All defense stocks dropping . . . . .
Time to buy!!
Maybe the company can demand employees give up more benefits to boost cash flow like they’ve done in the past
"Well Yahoo has officially given up. So much for the ""aint broke dont fix it"" mentality."

"Well folks, Trump will announce his decision on the Iran Deal. If he pulls out of the deal, LMT stock will go up. If he does not pull out of the deal, LMT stock will drop."
Sorry to say! Hearing many employees are infected!Shutdown next.
"You know, within the past year there sure were a lot of people whining about LM stock performance and how it had tanked (never mind that most of the Defense sector had done the same). People were crying about shadowy ""manipulation"" and speculating about other illicit activity on the part of the big brokerages.For some reason not hearing much out of those people now. Guess it's only a one-way street and those things (if they were ever happening in the first place) are OK as long as LM stock is up."
2.4 per quarter and a bump up in share repurchase of 1 billion. Not bad at all man. This is such a cash machine.
"The last time LMT did something like this it blew up. Yo you should really check out aw-esomeSTOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
LOCKHEED 'STEAMROLLER' MARTIN 
I'm believing we will have 4 more years of President Trump (I'm not sure Joe Biden's brain has 4 years left on the warranty) I have been holding LMT since I was sucking it up in the $70's. Defense spending remains strong.

"Funny in one corner are the “sky is falling” pundits, in the other, “$450 soon!” Most of the rest of the free world is silent, a dynamic found only in, yes, the rest of the free world.

I worry about the seemingly imminent market correction.... A lot of countries may cancel plane orders...and we have the DOTE report to 'avoid' in jan2019 as per usual.if this chart starts to form a head and shoulders....I may bail.

While their website is quite vague on their programs like ‘Kill Chain’ I do believe the recent Russian cyber attack has changed everything for the cyber security space. Lockheed is in a prime position to expand their role in this sector considering their current relationships with the US gov/pentagon along with an expected uptick in US cyber spending under Biden.

#$%$ just looks like Wall Street only Protects Brokers! Neat trick... Ugh!?. Bunch of Thugs in Suits!
Let's line up the facts (just to make a point). FYI.....I sat thru the CC.1. LMT beats on EPS2. LMT beats on Revenues3. LMT raises full year 2020 guidance4. LMT raises dividend 8%5. LMT increases stock buyback $1.3B6. LMT sees growth in 20217. LMT has highest backlog of orders in their history!! ($150B)8. There are some unknowns for 2021 but mostly to the upside.9. LMT current dividend yield 2.80%Stock goes down 3.00% ($11.50/share). These are the kinds of stock dislocations that investors need to look for and recognize. This has nothing to do with who will be in the white house. The stock will move up significantly when the BIG BOYS and their algorithms decide it should. In the meantime ......as a novice investor just buy it and hold it ........and wait until they press the button. GLTA

Anyone know where all that employee accumulated sick leave went that was replaced with PTO? Many people banked their sick leave for emergencies.

"Good ol Stupid American liberal press. Gotta get fear put out there and sell the news. Yes, CV is important, no it ain’t what the ignorant press wants you to believe. CV has killed approx. 2,800. Of those a large percent were age 70 and over. Last year in America alone, we had 80,000 flu deaths. Ok, there is a vaccine for the flu an not one for CV. Once temperatures rise, virus dies. Valuations were high so this was much needed. I’m fickle over the rate at which this has happened. Market now is looking at the elections. Bernie is now the clear front runner for the DNC. Obviously not good for business. These two issues mixed with CV set this sell-off. So what lies ahead? A quarter of results slowed by the CV. Then back to business as usual unless of course something not predictable falls out of the tree. Happy investing, gambling, or trading. Just a label. All about money making money. Have a great weekend"
Nuclear war threat is over... North Korean leader claimed he is not a type of person who will launch missiles at the US... We can sing happy songs and sleep good now... LMT will go bankruptcy... Stock will be $1 per share...

"Sell LMT, Buy Gold."
Headed down. Already priced in.
"click on the word help at the top right and complain. If you keep clicking on the things that pop up, it will give you a blank to post your opinion of this terrible ""improvement""."
Why’s has LMT been down since 8/28 - I know the $2 dividend came out today but it was $324 on 8/28 and now it’s trading at a low of $317 and change
"If I can't post, I'm just going to start reporting all."
"Simple really. Political uncertainty is a risk to orders/sales, pandemic restructuring and economic factors a risk to margins. Businesses are posturing whether or not it is being reported"
LMT getting back close to the all time high.
Gen Mark Milley announced new mission. I would call that an aggressive national security initiative
"Support at the 50dma has been bulletproof. The bigger threat to share price longer term is not higher tariffs but mid term elections. Democrats controlling even one chamber will make it more difficult to increase purchases of LMT products. Higher input costs of steel and aluminum will be miniscule and passed through in any event. At the end of the day LMT is providing products and services that can't be replaced at all is some cases and extremely hard to replace in most. Limited downside over the next 12 months IMO, with great upside potential."
"Hey Kevin, do you still want to debate about perfect timing of selling stock? I have seen it first hand and its called manage earnings."

Does the $100B Saudi Arabian arms deal even concern LMT?

People voted for Pence to become President by impeaching Trump. There was no other way they could have voted for Pence for Prez. I think Senate to respect peoples' mandate in 2016 and remove Trump.

"Lockheed going to 500. That's a guarantee, Boys. War is big business. This planet runs on armed conflict. Since Babylonian times."
Cramer called it here we come 300
"So, all of you folks that have did a thumbs down each time I've suggested that this stock has a real chance of dropping to $300 as the next support level still think that? Is anyone paying attention that we lost $20 bucks in essentially 2-3 days, on higher than normal volume on Friday? In the past, LMT might go down if the market dropped, but it was a nice hedge in that if the market dropped 2 or 3 percent, this stock dropped maybe 1%. If we are lucky, we may gain back $5 of that $20 this week, assuming we don't have another big hit to the market. Really wish Raytheon hadn't launched that challenge to the Aerojet deal. I'm amused how many folks cling to the ""but the dividend!"" mantra as to why this stock is a winner. Dividends don't matter nearly as much as they used to unless they are in the 6 to 10% range. If the new CEO doesn't figure out how to sell this stock/company soon to the large investors, expect more pain."

"This mega cap company drops with gaps on inexistent volume, much like a low float small cap co. Welcome to the world of bizarre trading."
decrease share purchases...give out more dividends and pay off debt aggressively.
Why the share price dropped? Hurricane Irma and Harvey jamed the radar and F-35 could not fly.... That is why share price dropped?
