Tracey - my view Icahn and gang don’t want to look stupid if they can’t produce a stellar earnings report justifying their demand for $40 price.I doubt they could produce such a stellar report and in which they will have go back Fujitsu for a reconciliation. Since they are talking I feel prior to earnings they will arrive at a settlement.As for as selling the leasing unit it is all just posturing and indicating to Fujitsu there is llot of value here!Gl!

"Cant wait to see the impact 3d printing has on the space industry, Xerox already has a long history of working with NASA and a like, id expect that to continue going off the recent patent filings, books and fundamentals show a increase in profits while a decrease in revenue could be due to discontinuation of out dated tech/focusing on larger margin areas/reshuffle into latest methods of prototype engineering."
Xerox is up 5.38% to 28.98

This is going to go higher soon
how bad is xerors balance sheet? Anyone understands it?
"Someone posted earlier. I think Fuji is not going to increase much higher. A price from 33 to 35 is feasible a face saving exercise for Icahn and gang.quick valuation for anyone interested. Based on today's completion of FujiFilm purchase on Xerox, here is how new FujiXerox shares are currently valued. Fuji will buy remaining 75% of Fuji-Xero JV for 671m JPY or $6.1B. Since this buys them 50.1% of the new FujiXerox stock, this values the new stock issuance this summer at $12.175B. For existing XRX shareholders, you will get 49.9% of the new stock plus a $9.8 cash dividend. 49.9% of $12.175B comes to a value of $6.076B. Assuming they issued the same number of shares as XRX today, this equates to $23.86 per share for the new issuance of stock. $23.86 plus the $9.8 cash dividend makes XRX today worth: $33.68 per share. It is currently overvalued at $34.67.Another way to look at it, the $ 6,076B is the value of the 49.9% of FujiXerox that existing XRX shareholders will receive. Add to this the $2.5B in cash dividend, makes the market cap of the new stock issuance at $8.576B. BELOW the current XRX market cap of $8.71B. Expect the new stock issuance of FujiXerox to replace XRX to be with approx. an $23.86 price. You'll lose money buying XRX at $34.60 if going after the dividend. For a good summary of the transaction, see: http://fs.magicalir.net/tdnet/2018/4901/20180131460460.pdfGl!"

"Time to dump or Short Xerox. What are Xerox management and Board of Directors thinking? HP has rejected an unsolicited takeover offer from Xerox Holdings Corp. and has asked shareholders not to tender their shares.The offer “meaningfully undervalues HP and disproportionately benefits Xerox shareholders,” the Palo Alto, California-based company said in a statement on Thursday. Xerox’s “urgency” in launching the offer shows its “desperation to acquire HP to address its continued business decline.”Xerox on Monday pitched HP investors on a cash-and-stock offer valued at about $24 a share at the time. For each HP share, a holder would receive $18.40 in cash and 0.149 Xerox shares. The offer is set to expire April 21, Xerox said Monday in a statement. The offer valued HP at approximately $34 billion as of Wednesday."

"Going to be an interesting CC, first would be an explanation as to why XRX would turn down a merger that values XRX at $31+ a share when since they canceled the stock hasn't been anywhere close to that price. Ichan's stake is smaller than it was when he put the boot to Fuji. So Vinisten is left to now explain why he feels that XRX will do better, and more importantly, how the SP of XRX will rise above the price FUJI put forward."

For a good summary of the transaction, see: http://fs.magicalir.net/tdnet/2018/4901/20180131460460.pdf"

"I have held this stock for 20 years! After the news today of the Moody downgrade of Xerox bonds to junk level, I have finally had it and sold all of my position in XRX. This company has been totally mismanaged these past 20 years and will eventually file for Chapter 11."

has sparc come up with any new gizmos? are those PHds drinking acid all day ? all they ever do is invent them(gizmos) other people use their inventions..getting rid of those old guards could save the company 100 million plus
"I worked at Xerox and unfortunately have a lot of stock from years ago. This is the problem. Leadership doesn't make tough choices. Leadership decisions are based on diversity not performance and mgmt has been afraid to be tough on benefits, layoffs ,e tc.They need Icahn to break the s--- show up.Jacobson is tougher but not tough enough and has probably gone native.Please support Icahn's efforts. It is our only hope for shareholder value."
Buy and hold this for mid November - big announcement coming - expect to see more insider buying as well. GL
What will it take for this to get back in the $30 range?
"Hey guys, please give a advise, should i buy xrx's at this time or wait for the next few days? thanks,"

I knew this dog couldn't hold $7.00.
I want to buy it but around $19 a share. Is that realistic?
"Best known secrete among institution investors: XRX has been a cash cow. Most of its debts are collateralized with financing receivables from equipments sales. And we still have a big piece of FujiXerox asset, and some minor equity in various affiliates, totally $1.441 billion. It is anticipated that certain kind of arrangement will be made with regard to FujiXerox, and Carl Icahn will lay out a scheme of proposals to create values for shareholders such as: demanding a significant corporate shares buyback, sale of FujiXerox, a dutch tender offer from Xerox, or an Icahn buyout of Xerox using his own Icahn Enterprises shares as currency. And all these will be readily approved by Xerox if Icahn slate of directors get elected. Hence, some sort of things like these will take place before the Annual Meeting is convened. This way, the current Xerox management will be forced not to reject Icahn's directors nomination, as other big investors will be working hard behind the scene for their investments to benefit. Because of all these, the Icahn Group is going to win, and Xerox will end up in a very different situation, very possibly becoming a very welcome part of another company in the similar industry, like HP for example, Servers, data center and networking are of one segment, and mobile devices like phones and laptops, and printers and copiers, and its interface in between are becoming another essential and enormous segment of this digital age. This up and running global economic expansion, and our giant domestic infrastructure rebuilding will new business setups, and therefore rising capital expenditures on equipments.Xerox also got some excellent technologies on 3D printers, which are about to leave their labs for commercialization. Carl Icahn is really at the right time for the right target. Think about it, just this scenario, if HP and XRX combined, what a power force it will be? At least for now, XRX is a cash cow."

"XRX is worth over $20 where it stands, any improvement from yesterdays report adds TO that.. The company will by $150 next quarter on the cheap"
XRX is up 6.57% to 21.25
"What is Ichans solution besides draining the swamp in the boardroom? I know he doesn't like the Fuji deal but does he want to kill it or improve upon it? Apparently the ""merger"" has been in the works for quite a while."
"So am i reading this rite, you get one share of the new company for ever 5 shares of xrx you as of 12/15/16"
The dividend payout ratio looks artificially low right now. It is probably closer to 90% long term.
X is up 1 cent in pre market. Here comes the huge rally. Get out of way folks.
Could be a good buy.
"very disheartening that this was close to 40.00 just a few months ago, and now every day its just trending lower....not only am I long, I am an employee. This cant be the end for this once great company, can it???"
Sellers gonna get whipsawed
gooosh
They have a billion $ buy back. So that is 40 mln shares to be bought.That will lower the acquisition cost for Fujitsu too or possibly they may increase the offer by a $ or two for the rest.Gl!
Lots of selling for no reason!
Thank you Carl ￼￼
Xerox is a great company and printing will not be going anywhere soon. Printing is a critical part of the office and with more and more people needing printers at home to start their work at home work I see great sales.
"Consolidation in the copying industry. Too many players. Canon, ricoh, toshiba, HP, Sharp, KM, etc....."

I was under the impression when an activist investor gets involved it is good for other shareholders. Well stock is now at a 52 week low and going down day after day. From where I stand today the Fuji deal looks like it was not to bad. Thoughts??
"vp disposing shares,,,time dispose the vp herve"
no reactions?
Why a reverse split?
Who says XRX isn't poised for potentially massive upward movement? Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesom-eSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
"Just saw video of CEO mentioning that Xerox is talking to authorities about making sanitizer, face masks and ventilators! Nice to see a company like Xerox stepping up!"
"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180501006992/en/Xerox-Reaches-Agreement-Carl-Icahn-Darwin-DeasonI'm not sure who all of Icahns board members are, but Keith Cozza and John Visentin are two of them - I made an against vote against the two due to no $40/share offers coming out of the woodwork. if I was a Fuji shareholder I'd scream at $40/share."
XRX is nearing a 5 year high. Looks like the market thinks XRX has a chance of working things out with HPQ.
XRX is going to cook the shorts big time soon XRX will cross the 30 mark MARK my words
"I understand this is a cash cow but if they want to survive this gigantic decline, they should start investing in technology such as 3D printing. Otherwise Xerox will slowly die."
Look at the whole chart. Xerox is not much higher then it was in the 70s. That make it a horrible long term investment.
year 1999>>>> price 156 year 2020 price 156
"It has been a damn ""dead"" horse every since Americans stop saying ""Xerox It"" and started saying..... ""Copy and Paste the Sh!!"""
I think this is a sleeper. Carl Ichan has made big buys up to $18.77. I expect his plan will become evident in the next 3-6 months.
New trader watchlist was published by these guys and it featured XRX. (https:// www.stocktip.xyz)
"XRX has just seen the last of the selling. Looks like a potential push higher is in store. Yo you should really check out awesom-eSTOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
This may be one of the stocks that ends up being overlooked 5 years from now. Crazy low PE ratio.
Hard to believe!
XRX is up 8.02% to 19.39
"Appears we are in fact heading toward $10 or below! Let’s remember as many of 42% of businesses will not come back, meaning less job positions means less printing, and service is a huge factor for essentially a printing company like Xerox!"
If you had 200 shares you now only have 50

"I think previously the Cash component was 9.80 making the total value to $34.They can take it to $11 snd it will be a $35 deal.They can’t run this enterprise with huge headcount and complex structures and sourcing, it is next to impossible. It is just posturing and they will sell this to Fujitsu pretty quick.Gl!"
does anyone know why xerox hasn't bounced back with all the stimulus going into the market? O:
Nice snap back enough to snap the shorts
"Look at the LONG Term chart on XRX... in the 70's through early 90, it was in the range of 12 and 35. After 2002, it has been in the range of 12 and 40. The only time long term investors would have made any money is during the bubble of 2000. You could have doubled your money every so often by selling around 35-40 and buying in the teens. Could make some money here, but print is dieing and there will be consolidation in the business. They don't make printers or copiers of their own and the only good parts of the company are their sales and service network and their patent portfolio.Glad the merger with HPQ didn't go through."
Nice move

"sell sell sell ... low volume .. trade wars.. racist and tax cutting darwin deason getting his way and dropping Fuji merge .. because he doesnt like Japanese people..

I got in at 45.00 .. And 53.45 and 58.95 and again at 59.39 .. It wont stop going up and is one of two stocks I own .. I have invested over 15,000.00 into it and have made almost 25% on that.. check it out APPN .. I'll only give you one of my two .. the other is golden.."
"Opinions on what Xrx will do tomorrow? So quiet here, lol :)I expect earnings to be in line with expectations."
Turnaround yes shot and mamed so they suffer till this dig goes bankrupt. I wouldn't touch this garbage with gloves on.
Trouble ahead? Reverse 1-4 split in the new proxy statement
$XRX should buy $KODK instead.
I'm watching this stock. Due to the dip in 2020 they haven't fully recovered yet. Which also makes it worth buying now since the potential is there. I think Xerox should pattern their business model to Adobe. Then its on!

Hertz a Carl Icahn company was trading for $8.40 per share around June 2017. Today it is worth $23.17 per share. CVRR another Carl Icahn company makes more profit that Hertz. Plus CVRR hold about $500 million in cash. CVRR now trades for $8.90. There is a chance for CVRR prices to shoot up with rising oil prices and less gasoline available in US now.

sop the madness at this company...
"What ratio of LTM EBITDA would a rational investor pay for Xerox? 6X is for a growing company and XRX does not fit that bill. At 6X the price per share would be in the $31-$32 share range. Similarly, at 5X it is #27 - $28 per share and at 4X it is $23-$24 per share."
"I'm shocked that this company is still around. With a market cap of 6 B, it is very close to being worthless. Nobody under 30 can even spell this name. LOL"

"I understand that they want fewer shares at a higher valuation ...it makes for good PR. I have seen neither loss nor gain with the Reverse Split, however, any gains will be worth 1/4 from this point. I am in because Xerox made one smart marketing decision when it decided to market through major retail outlets such as Staples. If they do not waste any money and/or incur additional debt, this marketing decision ought to pay out in a very big way over the course of time."
Excluding dividend Date coming 29 June 25 Cents nothing to sneeze about with low bank savings rates!

"before HPQ looks at buying Xrx they should look at this gem , they've have been sellig used photocopiers since 1982 , and they have service too!!! , looks like their inventory is huge!!! and Instead of 8 billion I think a couple bucks and a dozen eggs might seal the deal?? and look they sell all the great brands of fax machines , scanners and large photocopiers you could put in your garage or dumpster , Canon, Sharp , Samsung, Konica / Milota , Ricoh , and of course the ""Ichanic"" bran Xerox !! I had a flash of comedy about today's Xerox repairmen, like Whirlpool repairman, they come , clean out the mice poop from the bottom tray, offer to run to Sears for supplies like staplers, file cabinets, , and wheel in hand trucks of paper in ink rollers... and if your company's Xerox machine is stuck in the extra large broom closet or the dumpster , they bring in more service guys to help lift it out and repair it!! They can help as they lost so many clients they can come every day to your office for special treatment!!ABOUT EBUAs the industry leader in selling used copiers for over 30 years, we buy and sell the highest quality like-new, used, and refurbished copiers from the major manufacturers you trust.

I can easily see $25 from here
no one could see this move 18-to28 reason no lip talk from IHcan
I feel Carl ICAN is taking us to the cleaners
Moronic Management and Icahn cronies needs to pick up the Phone and go with the earlier transaction to salvage the Deal. That is better than the 27 price tagGL!
Load Up The Truck Now XRX! These guys are churning out huge winners I swear. Google STOCKTRADEVIDEO and you will see!
Reuters is New Buyout Whisperer.
"IBM may purchase Xerox, we will see!"
Only fools selling here.
“But it’s ok folks we didn’t make as much money but we laid off. A BUNCH OF STAFF AND SOLD MORE ASSETS” mantra only works so long even with the investment analysts that Xerox leads around by the nose ting telling you it’s a hold! Lol
Should I close this position?It’s going down 
"If you have this stock and are up right now, sell it and never look back. Xerox is a slow dying company. They make horrible products and are losing customers rapidly.The stock is rising because Xerox is starting to partner with other manufacturers to produce their machines and slap a Xerox sticker on it. They are also farming out the service side... This is cutting their costs for now and making the stock rise.As their products and service get worse, they will keep losing customers, and the stock will go down again."
moody call is junk
"Key thing to speak about is DEBT. No increase in DIV, no share repurchases, PAY OFF DEBT, get out of junk status. Destroyed the S/P. Hope this CEO has some sense, but the big ""buyback"" amounted to absolutely nothing when the debt downgrade hit."
"Stock deserves a $22 handle ,, smh"
They generate 95% of thier CURRENT revenue from selling printers/servicing printers and selling supplies like toner and drum units for said printers and most of the revenue they DO make in IT support is for installing or reinstalling moved equipment and setting it up to print and scan.
Glory Days are Coming-
XRX is up 7.84% to 20.08
It’s a joke how low they beat this down..
garbage stock
Doubt the pump and dump will work any longer. If you are interested in moral of Xerox folks... www.thelayoff.com
wow
any rumors as to what this product launch is?
"Beaware small investors - XRX is spiralling down , 40 cents daily . It has no core business, now making 120 GO2VENT portable gas operated ventilator and hand sanitizer.Get out of this stock . I lost $2650 , today. Anyway , I can recover from somewhere else. Good Luck."

37.00 dollar DEAL SOON. !!!
"Got a feeling HPQ is going to turn the tables and try to buy XRX, or form some sort of merger. Analysts think a combination of some sort provides a lot of synergy, but it didn't make sense for XRX to buy much larger HPQ. XRX is less than half the market cap it was when they tried to buy HPQ, and would be a cheap acquisition. Even HPQ's management said a combination would be attractive."
"up, uP, UP!!! $12 By Friday! GO Big X!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
And I'm still holding. I think theirs an echo in here.
Anuls are just talking head(analysts) are broke pushing garbage whle Carl sits on Billions not listening to ANULS
A very undervalued company. I am accumulating.
Under $17 is a steal.
Down the crapper we go!!
Very good entry point. Play the long game.
whatis this suit real. Figuii is stealing from xrx shareholder and wants us to pay them ??? call thrump tell him all they want to do is lay off american workers
"Many companies have gone with online contracts (e.g., DocuSign) and electronic records during this crisis time which will change the consumer behavior. Organizations have witnessed profit because of this and there is really no impact to business by going paperless. Xerox is also facing tough competition and margin pressure. The sale and margins are only going to reduce in this business."
Anyone know the value of the spun business is?
Oh man...interesting when it’s heading toward $30. What will XRX do at that point?
back in 1964 (yes. 56 years ago) while in a high school social studies class. as part of a class project I bought 10 shares of XRX. wondering what that would have happened if I'd kept it? Any help appreciated.
Ichan move to another company to destroy
You did not get the new info that arrived today. Icahn is placing new directors at the BOD.
XRX is down 5.04% to 31.25
If you want something really cheap look at $XRX (Xerox).. its only 3.8 P/E. But they are not buying back their stock. I have mixed feelings about this news.
Xerox reached a 52 Week low at 23.34
Why they need hpq???
XRX reached a 52 Week low at $18.89
So much for figuring what stocks to buy in this market! Zacks calls for strong sell today! Not that you can believe them.
had a reverse split about a year or 2 ago.
CC at 10am will be key going forward. They are in line with estimates for the year .I am not sold on this CEO yet
"sure but it only takes a few rotten apples to spoil the crop CEO & Board & previous CEO the Bear UrsulaNORWALK, Conn.---- Xerox today was named to Corporate Responsibility Magazine’ s 19th annual 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 10 th consecutive year.

garbage stock-- longs will get crushed here
Where do you go and even purchase these stock
"all started going downhill under Ursula , now it dosn't even look like she owns any of the stock she helped ruin ."
There is no reason for this to be green.
"Why would the CEO buy back stock and not pay off the debt ? Another Icahn idiot. Kills a deal, installs another moron to run this company, does a buyback, the stock sinks, and the debt rating gets lowered,"
"Moody's cut the credit rating to junk bond level, joining Fitch there. The bonds will drop out of the IG universe in January"
"Fujifilm will own 50.1 percent of Xerox shares, and combine Xerox with Fuji Xerox, their joint venture in which the Japanese company already holds a 75 percent stake.As per the deal, Xerox shareholders would get an implied premium for their stock and cash.https://goo.gl/otVZfE#XRX #Fujifilm #MarketNews #Merger"
"I think it's way cheap right now, 4% yield. Could be a buying opportunity.TD has it trading at around 11X earnings. They earned .68 a share last Q, pay a 25% dividend, but the noise around the stock keeps driving it lower"
APPN is the stock that has way better numbers for the quarter than xrx .. Rick is Darwin Deasons minon and takes his cut .. Stop giving bad advice for your stock options benefit .. Very Darwin like .. APPN .. look it up.. I'm telling you . I give advice where e everybody gains cuz I'm a Democrat.. Republicans own the Xerox and still cant make enough after all the tax breaks they said would be paying for itself ..
when will it get to 12? presplit price???
"New 52 week low. Sold out half my position over a month ago. They better hope Fuji comes back to the table with a decent offer, or this one's a FUBAR."
"Pure insider trading, xerox share holders can please sue the #$%$ out of Carl Icahn as he Bought HP Stake Knowing of Xerox Bid Plans, https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carl-icahn-bought-hp-stake-214325548.html"
This has turn into something worse than #Retail and retail makes #NOTHING...This old man would like to know just why someone would own it now...
raise the dividend stick it to the shorts
Give me your shares. I mean sell em to me. Thankyou very much!
Every year Xerox has restructuring charges for something! Big Red Flag. For the past 10 years they have done this. When they run out of excuses. They over pay for a company that they can't integrate and start the process over again! Wake Up Shareholders!
What happens today?
still long.
XRX is up 6.79% to 37.43

"XRX will continue to do well. 3D printing and the digital document services are promising. Performance was actually rising before Xerox took a hit with Covid, and it is now climbing back up. XRX, as well as JETS, MAR, CCL, NCLH, SABR, FRT, KBWY, NHI, PRU, SAFT, and CNK may reach their pre-Covid level and keep on going."
What happened to all of the stock chat rooms?
hey surprise I just got the condom (oops conduent shares in my account ) usually the price of the XRX stock would drop by the same amount of the value of the condom shares but since XRX already dropped by 20%hopefully the price adjustment already occurred..my broker didn`t have any info meanwhile with 5-or 6 law firms suing XRX for the benefit of the shareholders hahha usually means the law-firm wins shareholder get the shaft if the shareholders send Ursula packing the the law-firms chasing hearses maybe as shareholders we can regain some value in XRXCEO picture
Do not trust any advisor. They have their own family to feed. Read John Boggle book
New lows for XRX ahead? Markets are making new highs and the fat Urse keeps leading the company to new lows. Takes real talent.
What is happening with RRD news?
test
if they successfully pivot into 3D printing and metal 3D printing xerox will have a huge comeback
I see a lot of people thinking it's a 1 for 4 split it's not it's ac1 for 4 reverse which is not good
what's the reason for the 5% pop. Can anyone tell me
xrx will shoot up soon the fed bought a lot of printers in q3
"The only problem I have with this stock is that, well, it sells printers and fax machines for their profit. However, they've finally began the switch over to software services and hopefully they keep that trend up. Really nice value here, more so if they start innovating towards software solutions faster."
"Average on DOWN Carl...falling rocks don't bounce, so nosedive to Xero X"
"XRX will drop at the market openning Tuesday. look at the closing price of XRXw (5.83) last Friday, this will be the approx. adjusted price of XRX"

"Hey Jim / other shorts, my holdings in ETSY just shot up 22% in one day. What you going to do when XRX does the same? Not a matter of if but when."
"This is what I think HPQ and $XRX should do....Merge the two companies to create a new one. XRX claims $2B in annual savings from a combination. The combined companies would have $68B in revenue, with HPQ bringing 87% of that. They'd have a combined EBITDA of $6.5B and a combined net profit of $$3.78B.Next, issue 1B shares of the new company to shareholders in proportion to the revenue contribution by each company. Therefore, HPQ shareholders would receive 870M shares, and XRX shareholders would receive $130M shares. The combined companies would have $5.78B in earnings including the $2B savings. That's an EPS of $5.78 per share. With a PE of only 11, well below the market average, the stock would be worth $63 per share. That would bring HPQ shareholders $54.8B in market cap, or $38+ per share. It would bring XRX shareholders $8.2B market cap or $39 per share. XRX would be bringing $$2.74B in cash and $4.63B in debt, with HPQ bringing $4.54B in cash and $$5.16B in debt to the company."
"Bought in today. Tons of insiders acquiring shares, a dividend announcement, and such a low cost. Great p/e. Great research getting into the printed circuit packaging. My mind is blown as to why this stock is this low. Xerox has always been an innovator. I only wish I found this stock sooner. It will have it's day. Patience."
XRX stood strong yesterday...very excited to see where we go in the next few weeks
$6Merry Christmas..!!
Hey everyone. So I have Robinhood and Conduent is not on there. I'm freaked out because I have a bunch of shares of XRX! Anyone else know what's going on with this?
"Weird,There is no chatter on this Message Board.Yahoo Finance Insights is the most regular poster.Like that!!!So much, among other things, started a position today..."
What was the earlier agreement? How much was it worth?I think both don’t have a choice except to negotiate.Gl!
XRX is up 4.92% to 31.15
Xerox reached a 52 Week low at 14.80
XRX reached a 52 Week high at 38.94
Sales force should buy this company and can all the officials
I'm in. Getting paid 4% to wait for 3D printing.
Something is happening here...and I like it....have patience ￼
"Wow! 90% institutional ownership, maybe they’re trying to beat more shares out of the minor market. They’re clearly in for the long haul, and expect the tick to fly. $40 a share before the mess of deception hit the world. That’s a 100% gain(+) from here. Fasten you’re seatbelts for the rest of this ‘election’ year!"
Load up boys
this company is losing. do not buy
"I would not be so high on Carl Ichan. IEP has lost half its value in the last 5 years, the debt may be on junk status too. He miss timed the last big oil run and lost a ton. He has had plenty of bad investments."
This company is a buyout waiting to happen
Next stop...$16
