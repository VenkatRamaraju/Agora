"Heard every opinion out there on earnings. I’m leaning towards the price hike is cause earnings report is huge. Supposedly 2019 is going to be tougher on everyone and the competition coming out, they can raise prices because numbers are BIG. Raise prices on a miss with earnings? No"
bought a couple 400 sept 21 calls hope it keeps going upany prediction I feel 400 next weekthe big players want this over 400
Would be nice to see hedge funds reallocating from apple to NFLX a few billion can go long way for netflix.

"Netflix Has 'Insurmountable' Lead: Credit Suisse UBS just downgraded the Netflix Still, he raised his price target for Netflix to $425 a share. Its international revenues have increased at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 14.2% in the last five quarters. The company’s domestic CAGR in the same period stood at 5.5%, which indicates that the company’s international growth is outpacing its domestic revenue growth.

"The only folks predicting prices are shorts and analysts. Read the analyst reports. I prefer the analysts This stock is valued on the expectation of sub growth GLOBALLY and content production. That’s it. The company can make headway for a while...2 or 3 more years. Even if there is a little pullback, the subs will stick. Company is changing the content delivery business and is way ahead of the competition. Watch for other catalysts like gaming, premium tiers, price increase and an ad platform. Then maybe a merger because it’s to big to be acquired. I’m not predicting prices, judy enjoying the ride."
I believe Netflix is a long term buy over time....but as a now Hulu customer as well...have to say it's pretty good too. Z
"Get ready for profit taking the next two days, down we go, testing $300 level."

I've been waiting buying my time waiting for the next time NFLX take at hit at earnings, because this earnings, this stock is going to fly high. the next two days I expect 15 points each day and earnings day 10/15/18 I expect 40 to 50 point depends how much people have to cover their shorts.

"I think today I have been convinced that we are going back to 350. This is just a slow drip at this point. All of us in above 400 will have the problem of people selling when they make a good profit. This have us locked in for while. I don't think I will hold through another ER report again, not worth the risk."
After earning we take off hopefully a split

"Everyone is afraid that tomorrow will be a down day and selling it AF hours, it is going to be an up day tomorrow."

Good bye longs! You’re going home early but see ya next week
let see how is Nflx do this week.. I may get back in. let see
This will be $400 when earnings come out!!! Cant wait!
"I bought NFLX at 100, been sitting on it ever since, they have so many more choices than prime."
"I just carefully read over there financials. This is a bubble that is going to burst. No doubt about it. The cost to acquire and keep the business is far greater than the revenues generated from this business, and the problem is the more they grow the more there expenses increase. It’s like a reverse scale that has no possibility of reversing itself (at least that I can see)"
$270 seems to be where the most option holders get hosed today....so let's see if this miraculously ends up right at $270 to close......
"NFLX shares are owned by every major banks in the US including the Top 10 banks from Chase to Bank of NY Mellon, and these stable institutions which owned 80% of NFLX stocks are examples of the largest holders of NFLX to name a few namely CRG Investors 41,000,000 shares, Vanguard 30,000,000 shares, BlackRock 27,000,000 shares, FMR LLC 25,000,000 shares, StateStreet 16,000,000 shares, and the average daily trading volume is only 11 million shares which is less than 10% of the entire number of NFLX shares. Only 20% or 87 million shares worth 36 billion are owned by individuals (source: NASDAQ). These institutions usually rebalance their portfolio every June. So June has passed. These institutions are not prone to sell-off. For example with the GE stock; Vanguard maintains to own 600 million shares of GE, and BlackRock maintains to own 500 million shares of GE even GE fell from $26 to $13. Why they did not sell them. There was no SEC records that Vanguard or BlackRock bought or sold GE stocks. So will these institutions be triggered for a NFLX sell-off thus spiralling the NFLX price to half? It's a possibility but the chances of not happening is greater. In May 2002, NFLX = $1.21 and it has survived the Great Recession and reached this far to $418. No one can predict, but the company has a track record or innovation, and profitability."
whoa what just happened?!
"$SQ $NVDA $NFLX Since drop has begun about 3 months ago, it takes about 7-10 days from a new low to rally and then reach new lows again. This Friday will be that timeframe again. Sell into the rally, don’t get caught with good gains into the rally only to watch it disappear and now go into the red because of greed. This is a sell the rally market now, not a buy the dip market. Trade accordingly"
"Most meaningless, unnecessary drop ever. The only FAANG which has no problems with it’s audience. Rock solid company, great technology, perfect numbers. 0 concerns and this is tumbles. WHY????"
"Patience...As quick as this went down 30 points, it will rebound to mid 300s"
I'm long and nervous..anyone else nervous?
Looks like bad earnings are priced in. Now if Netflix does well then its gonna skyrocket.
Time to buy more

still over priced!
Any know how the PE ration of NFLX? It's a whopping 227 and not counting AH gain. Why in the world anyone would want to buy this stock?
"After hours manipulation by options and shorts, real ER effect will expose tomorrow "
This is becoming the bubble to end all bubbles. It's like this is valued based on the best case scenario 10+ years from now. I wouldn't be shocked to see a 20%+ drop in a day on any significant bad news. As long as the news stays good I expect it will just keep going up forever based on momentum though. This is the kind of stock that could either be <$150 or >$500 a year from now. Way too scary to short or to buy and hold IMO.
Markets will be green
To all that don’t know US stock Bubble is a paid Basher ! He’s on every Yahoo. Message board.

"Wait! Goldman Sachs told me to buy, price target was near $500."
What a come back!!!!!
NFLX “down 10%” since fake earnings
5.15M adds was a strong number for Q2 which is usually their weakest Q. Wouldn't be surprised to see 7M subscriber adds for Q3 with the stronger content offering.
I wish I have gut to short more but I don't and against my principle as well. I think I am exiting too fast twice now. Last time I exit fast and sell off bring this down to 240. It was sad as I exit with lot of loss. This time I am again exiting very fast but this time making solid profit atleast.Moving average Trend line seems broken or all most broken and that only going to bring technical sell off now.Start of month and End of month complete contrasting. At start of month it was back by solid technical buy and now complete opposite.
It’s gonna flush at 3:50pm. Watch.
"RBC Capital has a 12-month price target of 440 on the stock, that's a lot of upside from here."

Article on credit suisse rating for netflix.$470 price target and outperform rating.people always comment on their growing dept. But what they don't realize is the dept per subscriber has remained fairly flat. And that subscribers have been growing for years. In 2012 there were less than 40 million subs and now they have over 140 million subs and still growing.This stock will see mid 400's in just a few months. Check the Barrons article below.https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-euro-is-due-for-a-rebound-1538146881
hoping for 350 this week
Careful fellow shorts. NFLX went on a subscriber gain blitz giving away 3 month trials. Subscriber count will jump artificially.

We will be back to all time new highs by end of next week!!!
"This is crazy, I mean at least Amazon can somewhat justify their market cap. This though? There's no way they'll ever make enough money going off $11 per month subscription fees."

"Typical downward movement before an expected outstanding quarterly report. What surprises me is the manipulators can not run the price down even more. Especially in a down market. Any time I see downward movement the day of a quarterly report, you can almost always expect a blow out quarter. That is what is expected here. One of the better reports in awhile. This could run up to new 52 week highs tomorrow or even higher by the end of the week."
"Don’t foresee any significant movement tomorrow due to monthly and weekly options expiring. However, it should gain some positive traction as we approach earnings. Might test $400 in a couple of weeks prior to earnings."

REMEMBER AMOUNT OF SHORT IN THIS STOCK ALSO
Deutsche Bank upgrade creating havoc with algo trading now dominating the stock. Deutsche Bank can always be counted on to manipulate markets.
Yesterday CNBC focussed on Needham?s downgrade. There are all kinds of views but what I find disingenuous is that cnbc only published the negative one. There are four other updates from analyst. Bernstein at 422 yesterday. JP Morgan at 425 yesterday and stifel at 400 day before. piper jaffray today at 400. No mention of those at all. It also falls pre mkt because a network knows CNBc is going to focus on the negative one and starts shorting. Easy money. The flaw in Needham?s analysis is that she is treating the mkt as finite ie people will leave Netflix to go to Disney. But Disney and Apple did not get into this business to take customers from Netflix. They got in because they see a massive #$%$ in future years to streaming. So the point is all will win. The second flaw in Needham?s view is that she wants Netflix to introduce an ad model other wise they r in trouble. So now Laura from Needham wants to teach Reed Hastings the pioneer of streaming how to run his business when he does not see a problem.. just yesterday Sarantos at the UBS conference said business is intact. If he were losing subs he could easily do that. Short term because of these fears price can fall over next one year but don?t bank on it staying down. Too big a mkt and the suggestion they Netflix will lose 4 mn subs is complete nonsense with the pipeline of programmes.
Short will burn big time - congratulations

Everyone saying this jump is to sudden i just got the mail from ark invest. They bought heavy bags on netflix ah
Cohn is an American hero for what's about to happen Trump behind bars where he belongs. I hear Hillary is going to visit him!
A good chance Netflix will add 30 million subscribers this year.
Sell before the big drop after hours.....$200's will be here soon.
WE WILL BE IN GREEN BY 3:55PM
Like I said love Netflix power house wish I had more cash
"NFLX puts the ""P"" in parabolic. This stock has not taken a breath since $185. I think it is funds who are buying to fill out positions. They know the stock will drop but are long term. This has got to be a short here."
It might sell off from $550 but honestly it overreacted to downside last quarter. It’s the best in field. I thought too risky to hold into earnings but those who gambled worked out well
"$INTC $NFLX $WIMI $BA most of the tech stocks sitting on strong support level and they have strong earnings coming up. Chart is also setting up very nicely, wouldn't be surprise to see strong price action upwards for the next few weeks."
Huge news for NETFLIX!!! That's the reason for the quick jump today.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/667d39c0-454f-3d45-9ea2-876264f8dac4/netflix-chooses-new-mexico.html
Longs thing Netflix is next to reach $1T
$385 tomorrow beat & $430 on Friday
I just shorted Netflix at 328.67.
This baby is still a bargain from its 400 territory. Just added $100K ~~~
"I sold after hours yesterday at $395 when it spiked. I had paid $381 for 100 shares before last quarter's earnings and was really under water. Just lucky to get out, and I'm through trading with NFLX."
Relative Strength Index for NFLX is at 83. The most overbought for NFLX has been in over 2 years.

"I just wish, I'd bought more calls towards close."
"One of the few stocks that does well in good times and bad. In bad times, people look to save money which accelerates cord cutting (because of the price gauging by cable companies) and simply going with netflix."
"The pullback offers an opportunity to add more shares at deep discount ahead of earnings report just 10 days away, as the stock is weighed down by the market that has nothing to do with subscriber numbers at all. JMHO"

Netflix is the only streaming service that is making a profit. They have cornered the market.
I bought 50 extra at 363.53. How lucky can someone be :) Just before the buing spree.
• Morgan Stanley raised its target price to $475 from $450. • J.P. Morgan raised its target price to $450 from $415. • Raymond James raised its target price to $435 from $400. • Canaccord Genuity raised its target price to $470 from $450.
"Buying opportunity for sure. Look at your history here...every sell off has turned into a chance to buy and make money. The sub model they have blew it this quarter, but they set the bar low for next quarter and they’ll beat it handily. This is always the weakest quarter with little new content. Add to that the fact that they’re just in their infancy in Asia. Short term pain down to 320 in the near term, but up up and away is the long term destination."
Wow guess what? I just checked PG and it has a 87 trailing PE for single digit growth. LOL at people saying Netflix got a PE problem. Even a dinosaur company like PG can get a 87 PE
Charts pointing to 780 on this.
NFLX bubble is going to burst soon or later.
Apple’s $4.99 plan is way more expensive for just 9 shows vs Netflix’s $12.99 for over 5000 shows..
Still a bargain

This stock kind of reminds me of netscape during the browser wars.... it's just a matter of time before the big guns get it together and grab the majority of market share. The win is that netflix would be a great acquisition for either apple or disney. IMHO
almost Disney market cap? There is a limit to the value of a streaming service with a reproducible business model.
"buy here and you will be happy . I told you at 250, 280 and 300 . This is will be best short term gain you will have . This stock will be above 400 tomorrow"
"congrats to those who held! last ER, it went back from 550 to 485$"
Nah the buying starts again soon. It’s going to move up again stay tuned
"I like your passion man/girl, whatever."
Daytraders: placing a trailing stop on this stock what is the magic number in order to protect your gains ? Just bought 300 shares but I think it is high and it may retrace. Market is very volatile
On a down day NFLX was strong. Especially at the close. That tells me Wall Street knows what we don’t know but are wishing for. Buy the rumor sell on the news then buy again. Or just hold it if an investor.
long term short on this stock. too much competition and the content is slipping.
If I were invested in Netflix... I’d start thinking of an exit strategy. Seriously. All they do is put old movies on Netflix and consistently raise the prices. They just raised my prices again ~ when I was just thinking the other day- how terrible their programming is. I canceled- I bet a lot of other’s will cancel as well. Netflix sux!
It this somekinda joke?????? red? Are you serious???? LOL

"Netflix is the stock version of the crypto craze. Everybody is just buying Netflix due to the name recognition, and because they see it always going up and they have the fear of missing out on the seemingly never ending gains. It worked for Bitcoin...until it didn't. I wonder how long this will keep adding billions to the market cap every day with no fundamentals to back it up?"
We warned u streaming is a classic parabolic bubble and a low margin utility like cable in end $roku
"Have a nice day you all. Dinner time here in the Netherlands.Let hope it goes green again. Going to watch Tabula Rasa. Belgium show. Very nice, can you watch it in the States?"
Don't make the mistake of looking at Netflix separate from the emerging streaming market. With it and being the clear leader they have outstanding growth visibility.
6.8 million adds and 2:1 split coming. Shorts will be begging for mercy. $550 call options are very cheap. Buy.
FB fallout. That's all
I’ve been reading their quarterly reports for two years and the last two reports are concerning. It was enough for me to open a short position. Look at their recent growth and compare it to their multiples and it doesn’t add up. Throw in a heavy debt load and we’ll funded competition coming to market in the next year and I’m happy to be short
Strong!
Who is keen to buy some netflix shares today???
"Remember People ,So called professional hedge fund managers said Amazon was grossly overvalued when it hit 500.00 per share where are they now ? Netflix is an anomaly stock that only comes around once in a while, so sit back and enjoy the ride.A year from now people will say I remember when Netflix was 350.00 per share."
73.3 million international and 57.9 million domestic subscribers bringing its total to 131.2 millions. 
"Remember when Netflix was $8 down over 80%. Content producers were raising prices, Apple, Comcast and Verizon said they were going to launch streaming services. Nearly half the floated shares were held short. They laughed at Hastings when he said streaming would eventually replace cable TV and Netflix was leading the way."
Wonder what Baldy Jim Cramer will have to say about his least favorite FANG stock tonight!
Netflix always is my biggest holding. even when I sell it off. if I kept it all I could have been rich.
"Good friend of mine from high school works at TD Ameritrade. I called him over the weekend. He said when the markets have been so bad and many have lost 10-30% equity in their positions, a small 1% drop pre-market causes tons of margin calls to go out. Most end up selling to cover the margin calls when market opens adding to the sell off and driving price down more. viscous cycle. You'd be surprised how many people are trading on margin...give someone credit and they will take it. Most houses bought on credit, cars, and most of the stocks as well."
They need to report 7.2M subscriber adds for Q2 and guide for 6.5M adds in Q3 for the rally to continue.
"Netflix will recover, don’t sell!"
Triple top
Why doesn't NFLX issue its own currency like FB Libra? Thwart Zuck's ambition to rule the world.
the only dudes selling now are protecting their short term gains. cause even if earnings is flat this still has a pretty good chance of going much much higher long term.
This is only the beginning. Price targets all over this green earth at around $750 and higher. I will give it about a month before we hit that target. The analyst aren't giving us a 1 week target...realistically it's a 1 month target.

It’s a good moment to buy 50 shares of NFLX?
On Pace to move 1mm shares in the first 5 minutes. Jam it higher to unload shares.
"Netflix's balance sheet is a disaster. On 3/31/16, total debt was $8.9 bill vs. on 12/31/18 debt soared to $20.7 bill. Cash & equiv over the same timeframe only went from $2.1 bill to $3.8 bill. For year-ending 12/31/18, Netflix showed net inc of $2.68/sh diluted. The problem is that they're cash flow negative. There's a line in the Statement of Cash Flows for $13.0 billion, for ""Additions to streaming content assets."" The $13.0 bill was capitalized instead of expensed. It's not clear they'll ever see that money and may very well have to write it off. Shares closed at $360. Even if the eps of $2.68 for 2018 was legite, which it isn't, the p/e ratio is extremely high for a company cash-flow negative. Interest expense is creeping up, i.e., $150.1 mill for 2016 vs. $420.5 mill for 2018. The interest expense is rising b/c debt is rising, i.e., on 12/31/16, long term debt was $3.4 bill vs on 12/31/18, long term debt was $10.4 bill. Movie studios aren't giving away their movies for free. Original content is costly to produce. Needless to say, I've gone short the stock."
"wish you could buy nflx @ $31.00?? well here is your chance ! Buy IQ stock today , a Chinese co. that is 93% owned buy BUIDU. IPO was in March @ $18.00 and has already gone to $46.00 is just a few months. Well thanks to Trump hammering the Chinese market w trade war threats, the whole Chinese market has gone down and you can get IQ for $31.00 now. It is a fast growing co. similar to nflx in some ways and is not affected by tariffs, other than just being Chinese in general. CHECK IT OUT !!!!!!"
CIIC GSAT & CCIV calls right awayFWDG
Might end green today lol !!!
Apple is getting into the streaming business. Thats why stock is down. Netflix is going to have to compete with Apple and Amazon. Two companies with all the money
$380 by Friday!
I see it going higher tomorrow 
I think the country and Trumps base has had about enough of this. You want a country divided you got it!!!
Look at NFLX go!!!
"Wow, that Barron's piece spells doom for Debflix. Need to track down the full report from that fund manager."

Like this stock but decided to sell and take a nice profit. Hoping to buy back at lower price. Good luck to all.
Netflix getting near the bottom... the rebound rally will go up at least $40.00-$50.00don't miss it
"take a look at NFLX, NVDA and FB chart at 4:15 eastern time they had a spike down and back up"
You guys were right! 280! 
This market is getting so easy to predict. Let's get prepared for another 200 point down day.
Winners don’t come often when you are out there in the wild world of the markets. But all that can change if you join the right program. I joined up with these guys (http://Fairstox.com). Now I am having solid picks every week.
"Guy Adami, smartest person on Wall Street, predicted large run up in NFLXstock price."
Days high. $580 coming soon.
"If Netflix want real growth they need to do something about the level of account sharing going on. My mom, dad, sister, brother and myself all share ONE netflix acct at 4 different houses."
One side of the mind says it is too good to be true and the other side says it is too good to miss out. This is how all scams and bubbles flourish. But ultimately this fake market will tank even more sharply than the last month..
How many of you here believe that NFLX will go right back to $400 as if the miss means nothing?How many of you believe NFLX will go back down to below $360?

400 today!
Anyone taking profits? Like this start but the run up has been too incredible. IMO
red in 5 minutes.
February 2021 subscription increase could cause a increase in cancellation.
"NFLX price to sales 5 year average is around 6. Right now it is around 13. So 200 is not out of the question. But with 8 billion in streaming obligations and 9 billion in debt they need to do something. They are playing a tightrope game before the competition picks up. Really, a 160B dollar company and they dont even have a good browser. I have to use an app just to figure out whatthey have on streaming. Come on."

Watch AMZN. AMZN goes so does NFLX.
Thanks for the upgrade it saved it from dropping 5% in one day. Im glad
"DIP BUYERS WILL LOAD any weakness on NFLX. Pick up the June 19th CALLS cheaper on any weakness tomorrow/this week. Also, CMG Knocked it out the park. Upgraded to $1,000AND FORGET juggernaut AMZN reports earnings next week. BUY THE AMZN MAY 15 CALLS on discount before earnings."
There are no salary caps in the TV and film business. Sports leagues have salary caps to enhance competition. Netflix with 20 billion in streaming revenue (181 billion over the next 5 years at current growth rate) is buying the streaming championship.
"Glad I sold half today. Holding ANY tech thru earnings is not worth the risk vs. reward. When FB dropped $45 on earnings...you know there is NO CHANCE it’s going to rise $45. Same goes for NFLX. upside is limited, downside is huge. Just not worth it. Calculable decision."
Very lofty today. Rise NFLX rise!

"Guys, I'm new to trading and looking for advice. Up on enthusiasm, I just bought some shares at 132$. Should I keep them 'till tomorrow or sell them in advance? In case, at which price? What do you think? Thanks"
"How about the sales $ per domestic subscriber metric? Looks hinky, jumps to $33.03 per domestic subscriber, last quarter was $30.87, before that $30.13. How about that cost per domestic subscriber, down to $16.24, last quarter $16.53, more hinkiness. And now CONTENT; $2,986M spent in the quarter but content costs only increased $35M. At that rate it would take 85 quarters or 21 years to amortize."
"Be honest, who bought NFLX @ $593?"
When will big players start playing? Only then you can find out which way to go.
"Assuming Netflix makes a whopping $10 per share in earnings when it reaches its growth plateau in 5 years and at that time trades at a PE which is close to that of Apple's PE which is at 19. Then it will be only worth $190 per share. So, I ask myself, do I buy a stock at $330 today when it will be worth $190 in 5 years, or do I short it at $330 and buy it back at $190?? Invest wisely, not emotionally..."
"FAANGs are back baby ! AAPL, MSFT and AMZN earnings coming soon. Give me $600 NFLX today."
"Up 10 , 15, or 20 after the bell?"
wonder if it will drop next week
hello 200 hello 210

"New 52 week high AH, then sell off during the week..."
Bring it back to 200
This was below $200 9 months ago...What makes you think it can't go back to that level again??
Why do people think 6.99 Disney means that nobody wants nflx? They have different content. No mature adult content on Disney.. they aren’t mutually exclusive. Affordable to have both.
Tomorrow easy 440.00
content sources getting more and more fragmented. The providers with the best exclusive content win
Who can sleep well today?
I sold couple 340 call yesterday (I have order at 2.5 and gone out and find out later yesterday that it was executed).I think this is inflated stock and clearly used by manipulator. Yesterday move is proof. sudden 4% gain for no reason. I think eventually this will go very bad way as no fundamental justify such valuation.
"MUST READ:::: Food for thought on NFLX (and all other high flyers)....each time price targets got lifted (on nflx) when it was at all time highs, it dropped over 20% every time, BEFORE going higher. Take early Jan 2018, target went to 350 (price was at 287), then dumped to 236. Then again in March, target was 400 (price was at 334), then dumped to 271. Now we are at 400 all time high and 500 is new target. Price will dump at least 10% BEFORE going higher...350-360 range will hit again soon. Don't read the hype on this stock...its being swing traded by big-cap on and off wall street. So, NFLX will dump soon BEFORE GOING MUCH HIGHER then 400...watch an learn....we swing traders make way more in long-run. We lock in profits on each run. Mostly we go LONG till new highs break, take profits, then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts... then hop right back in LONG at lower levels. PLUS, we dont risk losing large portions of our gains if something really bad happens. Much safer to swing trade...just need a good coach and trading group."
Obama and Rice presence will drive this stock down bigly yuuge!
All that AH action because of one analysts upgrade. Absolutely proof the market is manipulated and valuations are not realistic. Nothing against Netflix...just sayin. An upgrade shouldn't make a stock instantly shoot up. A good ER that proves a company has done well is more of a catalyst you can hang your hat on.Just my 2c
"Faang bubble, 420 Neflix or 500 Netflix, big holders have hollyday so the bubble is not a problem."
When NFLX keeps going up
"Earnings in a few weeks, will be very interesting."
The gains are just about gone.
Reed Hastings just sold another $22 million of Netflix on 4/22. What a great country! He is a multi-billionaire and yet his company loses over $3 billion per year.
Loading up big time now ~ . This baby will be 360 in a few days as it bounce back to 400.

Anyone see $380 before end of the week?

Good riddance to one-term grifter Donnie!
Market participants are simply in the mood to buy. The results don’t matter much never. It’s all about “future growth” which is just market mood and feelings.Look at Aapl doubling in price despite declining earnings and revs. The only thing that matters is whether traders think someone else will buy it for higher. For nflx that’s a big YES. He who panic buys first panic buys best!
Following same pattern on chart as yesterday
"So at 1:10 it was $313, now $15 lower. Does that look like normal market volatility?"

"While the naysayers are pontificating on a daily basis why Netflix should not be at these levels, the stock like the Duracell bunny keeps marching forward with occasional dips along the way. The naysayers and doubters for the last 100 points have been trying to comprehend why this stock should not be rising while it continues to rise. Now we have top analysts making a case that this stock will continue to move higher. There are the doubters and the believers and those that are believers and visionaries continue to make money and congratulations to them."

Netflix India will boost the growth
"Sadly, more downside to come. US subscribers' continue to fall into Q3 2018.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4187641-netflixs-sell-starts"
"This is how it works folks. Cable companies used to charge from $100 to $300 for cable packages in the US and American consumers used to pay for that. Netflix change that game by charging $6.99. And now $13.99 a month. Consumer switch to Netflix in droves and dumped cable. Regardless if Disney came in or any other players there is room for more players in this field without cannibalizing from existing players like Netflix....remember consumer used to pay $100 for cable every month. So the argument that Disney coming in will compete with Netflix is false, they can Coexist together. The advantage of Netflix is the international market where right now they are first player and will capture the market like they did in America, Canada etc. This is why Netflix command the stock price that they did. How big is the world market....there are 3+ billion of middle class in the world who can afford Netflix subscription....Netflix currently only captured 130+ million of it.......Do the math"
"NETFLIX & APPLE RAISING PRICE ON ITS PRODUCTS & SERVICES. Netflix is raising its U.S. prices by 13 percent to 18 percent, its biggest increase since the company launched its video streaming service 12 years ago.Its most popular plan will see the largest hike, to $13 per month from $11. That option offers high-definition streaming on up to two different internet-connected devices simultaneously. Even at the higher price, that plan is still a few dollars cheaper than HBO, whose streaming service charges $15 per month.The extra cash will help to pay for Netflix's huge investment in original shows and films and finance the heavy debt it has assumed to ward off rivals such as Amazon, Disney and AT&T.While subscribers may bemoan a bigger monthly bill Wall Street cheered, sending shares up more than 6 percent in midday trading.This marks the fourth time that Netflix has raised its U.S. prices; the last hike came in late 2017 . But this is the first time that higher prices will hit all 58 million U.S. subscribers, the number Netflix reported at the end of September."
My fear is dead money for the foreseeable future. Neither up or down much. Money has to work for me.
This really is too easy. I had 220 last week nd 230 this week and looks like we will exceed that. I am wondering if my call for 250 post ER is too conservative. This just keeps running and may pop well over 10% when the subscriber growth comes in.
People are investing in Netflix like their Subscriber growth not slowing ever. It's own history is not consistent. But at least until now it keep growing so far.But if you look into HBO history. Incredible growth between 2010 to 2014 ( from 81 million to 138 million ) subscriber. It then dip next year to 132 Million subscriber. What will happen to Netflix price specially if remain inflated like this.https://www.statista.com/statistics/329277/number-hbo-subscribers/
has nflx doubled their earnings over the last year? no.. in fact they make so much money they need to keep issuing debt to keep their business alive.
One day before options expiration day Eric decides to upgrade/ Coincidence much? These analysts are starting to have too much power.
WE NEED A HEDGE FUND TO START MOVING IT UP!
"People can easily cancel (as they advertise) their account if no new contents/shows. Besides 1 in 6 of the people in U.S. had signed up (300 mil population vs. 55mil member) which means market is saturated (family with kids a/c, friends sharing...). I see this would collapse (again) if their contents budget is down or member not meet target. 1 Million missed last quarter says EVERYTHING."

just purchased call options ahead of earnings $500 lets goooooo
If drop till 165... I buy it
"this will easily go to 500 and possibly 1000Netflix is the future guys, profits and such mean nothing when there is no competition. Once they control the market they can raise sub fees to $50-$100 and people will pay it because they don't know anything else"

Today was a good day to start buying some Puts. On a positive note Bord Box was a pretty good movie. Happy New Year yall
Going back to 280 where it always ends up....
10 Billion in debt and 2 Billion debt to issue soon. Where's the end of NFLX cash burns?
"India could be a source of millions for New netflix subs, source RBC"

"Now it is coming down lol ! Maybe market correction can bring it to 250 before it go us to 300 and then 500. Internet success is still in early stage. Just keep this in mind, 30% of internet traffic is done by netflix and all paid and still growing fast. That is huge."

NFLX HAS DROPPED FROM$449.52 TO $413.00THE PROFIT TAKERS THAT SOLD AT $449.40 ON UP HAVE SINCE RETURNED. THIS STOCK IS A BUY IN THE $420'SI'ts gonna return to the $440's
If Netflix would monitor how many accounts are being abused and shared by non family members they could double maybe triple their account number. I know several people who has shared their account with 15 or more people outside of immediate family
"Yes, Friday's trading results make me a bit nervous but, like the elite companies out there, NFLX has a great track record of hitting and beating the quarterly estimates....the mark of a leader or, super athlete...."
A rare buying opportunity. Earnings Monday will be a blowout.
Seems like healthy pullback

"Im scared, miss or beat?"
I called a couple of my friends yesterday that work in the banks and told them to load up Netflix. This is going over the all time high soon. They where buying but said waiting for today to see what happens it’s looking real good. Going to $360.00.
We are up almost as much as $NFLX
"Exercise the 3 day rule before buying more. NetFlix could rebound later this week, but it needs to sell off further, maybe down to $325 before climbing again."
"Time to short this debt king. Only thing growing at this wall street scam stock is debt. Negative cashflow, rising debt yet the stock is touching the sky. This bubble market is ready to tumble just like Dec. 2018."
"For the sake of it's future technical health, I'd like to see NFLX fill this earnings gap before crushing the $260-65 area. Yes, they had an amazing quarter in terms of new subscriptions, but, the stock is expensive as heck... The chart looks like bitcoin. careful!"
hahahahahahaha
Expecting blockbuster earnings....Just fake action here.. This will hit 550 easily today!
"Not just get out.... They sell it and buy FB,Amazon,AMd... Before ER. And back here again. Cause they know.. The price won't up too high here"
"This is the best time to grab some shares before earnings come out.Netflix has barely started in India, subscriber growth there is going to be phenomenal.PLUS - Netflix's ability to produce contents is unmatched, they are light years ahead of the competition.This stock could be $1000 in a few years!!!"
Already up 6 grand on my short! Let the party begin. To much competition .
$20 is my threshold before I would cancel Netflix. Quick survey on others threshold
320 before closing 
"so let me get this right, a $2 price hike is too much for everyone to bear, lol . This service is the bargain of the year. It is the cost of a sandwich. All these competitors are so far behind and people love many of the shows on Netflix. This is only their 4th hike in their history. Eventually this had to happen, how else do you make money? Look what Amazon prime has done, way more hikes, way more expensive and nobody blinked yet. This model like COST AMZN, subscription is what's happeneing"
NFLX will reach $ 275 by this Friday! Do not miss this buying opportunity.
I'm hoping we beat. ;)
"They're trying to make it look reasonable, not an elevator drop."
Why the drop AH?! What happened?!
"Super rare day. But we are getting used to those....For the 110th time since July 2016, it got under 5 in the red, it is only the 17th time it ended up in the green.5th since Oct. 23. I have no idea what tomorrow will be like..... or Wednesday"
"So many people took a gamble and shorted this stock. Needless to say, this stock will soar tomorrow with all the shorts covering their calls! Hahahaha"

Netflix price target raised to $650 from $625 at CowenCowen analyst John Blackledge raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $625 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst said his survey suggests its US pricing power continues to rise and he expects paid net additions to come in above guidance.
$400 in no time. Buy buy
This stock has that big D
I lost 95K
"what do you think a reasonable PE will be when Netflix reaches saturation. it's not a matter of IF, but when it reaches saturation when sub and revenue growth reaches 10-15% annually. I think at that time, PE will be closer to 20 (Disney is trading at a PE of 15 right now). If EPS is $9 at that time, NFLX won't be worth more than $200. and that's at saturation in a out 5 years."
Debtflix will never achieve positive free cash flow status in any reasonable time frame. The analyst cash flow models are preposterous. Just read this article from Bloomberg.https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-23/will-netflix-junk-bonds-wilt-amid-the-content-wars
"Netflix maintain overweight and $643 price target at piper sandlerPiper Sandler analyst Yung Kim says the firm's December quarter ""Netflix Navigator"" search index points to Q4 subscriber growth in-line with consensus for both U.S. and Canada as well as international. The search index analysis suggests Q4 U.S. and Canada subscriber growth of 8.5% year-over-year, versus the consensus at 8.3%, and international growth of 29.1%, versus the consensus at 28.7%. Kim remains comfortable with estimates of 8.7% and 28.7%, respectively, driven by the ongoing stay-at-home environment. Despite increasing competition, Netflix continues to capture a significant share of content consumption dollars, Kim tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $643 price target."
590 call Feb 18??
Last time to sell and preserve your gain yesterday. This will be a round trip.
"If you are selling NFLX due to old kangaroo called DIS entering the show then you are short sighted. Online video streaming is accelerating and I can tell you for every industry there is always number one and others. Nobody will cancel NFLX to have Disney, families will have it as an add on for the kids and that’s about it."
I can't imagine who is selling but I really can't imagine who is buying...Did any banks call their margins?! Yeesh
Time to shine
Sio glad I finally jumped aboard this baby last month. What a machine.
"Netflix is a vehicle for transferring wealth from public shareholders to Hollywood producers, directors, writers, actors, production staff, etc. It is a total boondoggle for the entertainment industry. There is no positive ROI. The content bubble will implode."
The current decline is just a warning shot to what's coming......this will end up like 1999-2000. NFLX P/E ratio is at almost 300 (very irrational).
"Tommorow NFLX will break through the old high of 421 and march higher due to shorts covering, really excited considering I have over 450 shares"

NFLX is the best FANGS stocks you can buy now: I switch bulls from bears!!!Target $380 in 12 months or so!
Do you know why analyst talk about subscriber numbers and not free cash flows?( NFLX can never be positive free cash)Does any analyst or Reed talk about how much a international subscribers pay?( 90cents per month compare to US customer paying around $10/month.NFLX stock is a bubble. only people who would loose at end are the ones with 401K invested in these bubbles.
FB is up and NFLX to follow! We just need 1%to break technical resistance
Bear trap
"Wow... 320 in after-market... I think if the momentum continues over next 3-4 trading days, we all can buy NFLX around 280 and then count our money as it steadily moves to 400+ over next 6-8 months. I'm salivating... :)))"
"Again, good buy in low 500s in market down days"

"Lot of people says dot com and this rally is different. I agree with them. Back in Dot-com rally was broad cover lot of different companies in bubble territory. This rally focus on few hot names. Now is that good or bad. Very hard to tell but here is my thought.Because people only invest in hot names, Money concentrated into top 50 company in this market mainly. Now let's say $AMZN or $NFLX or $TSLA suddenly find hard to handle. With limited balance sheet they will have hard time meeting obligation and stock can crash big time. If one of such company fail, fear to exit will run. Given most invested in 50 company, Those all exiting into same names as well and what will happen when everyone thinking to exit same time?"
"Quit trying to call the top shorties, you’ll never do it. Get on the winning side of this stock while you still can!"

Trump blew it this time. Should have listens to his advisors
$360 today going to be a great green day
"Viewership and Membership UP BIG in March ""and"" production basically zero so no cost for producing NFLX originals (as no shooting was happening). NFLX saved a lot of revenue due to zero production in March and they also increased revenues due to higher memberships. All of this means share price will be going much much HIGHER!!"
can't wait to see the Netflix and Amazon bubble pop. better than any show i can stream!
volume is low today. I expect more selling in next 2 days
Sometimes you think you reached a floor and then you fall through. That’s what is happening. NFLX should test 350’s again real soon.
Can we at least close 1% up today. I’ll take that lol
"netflix needs to chill on their liberal agenda. Big mistake for content provider to lean left or right because they are just shrinking their customer base. I live in netflix's home, silicon valley and its one of the most liberal areas in the nation and believe me...netflix's newest original content is an exaggeration of reality. Tone it down netflix."
"dont listen to cramer ...listen to ur research,,,:-)"
needs a BIG week next week
Shorts have been obliterated. Cash on the sidelines ready to buy any dip. Shorting NFLX is literally throwing away money.

"Hey all you pessimists out there: nothing goes straight up and long term investors in nflx will do well indeed.A good business model, innovative team and good leadership will prevail despite the increased competition. Remember that nflx has evolved from a mail order business into a streaming behemoth? That should give you pessimists some pause and stop the selling nonsense and frenzy. Also, one quarter does not a trend maje."

Bought some levered call options for 1000$ premarket; alrdy worth 1400$ now ;DLooks like was a smart move and we can go ahead to 700$ fast :)
Sold for 327. Will wait to buy at 300
I'm sure this dip had nothing to do with investors being worried that Disney will dominate the streaming market. I'm sure yesterday was just a coincidence. Right.
"This is normal I suppose when you are the leader of the pack, everyone is gunning against you. A slight hiccup and who is who of the world going to start this Chorus...told you so...But hey, comes with the territory, bring it on , we will see in six months that the Champ (NFLX) is still standing in the middle of the ring!"
"*Warning to shareholders* There is a huge boycott campaign starting against Netflix, thousands have already cancelled today, check evidence on Twitter, FacebookLong term prospects are not good, the subscription base is cratering and this company is burning cash.You've been warned"
"The reason NFLX is worth much less (circa 40) is that Video is FREE .. think all the amazing free stuff on Youtube including university lectures!!!!. From X to Triple XXX, Sports, Movies on Prime (for those who want free PRIME shipping"", ETC. Netflix worth no more than $20 to $40. Even GE is a million times a better investment than NFLX."
Apple beats and NFLX barely moves. Hmmm. up .10% at the time of my post. So much for hoping Apple would help a lot.
this was 410 after earnings what happened? lol
"Last time I was here people were buying in bulk at 580 like it’s toilet paper, now that wasn’t very smart"
I guess I had some recovery today i paid 412.74 for my shares
close around 400 hopefully
At last the stock didnt justify its $80+ move in 3 months and was all HYPE.

"NFLX maintainted Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target.Netflix's 2021 film slate ""marks a more pronounced shift toward quality,"" as its 70 films have increased star power from the likes of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep and Denzel Washington, KeyBanc analyst Justin Patterson tells investors in a research note. The analyst believe Netflix's scale has made direct-to-streaming a more compelling distribution option for actors and directors, particularly as COVID-19 weighs on global box office revenue. If Netflix can succeed in film, its lifetime subscriber value can increase due to improved retention and pricing power, predicts Patterson. The analyst keeps an Overweight rating on the shares with a $634 price target."

Just curious and would like to see how netflix stock holders feel cause while I may have netflix in my mutual funds I don't in my personal stocks.I have the premium plan as long as I can remember cause my kid was in school at the time and have kept it since cause he still uses it and in our household it's infrequent so I keep the plan.Am I the person Netflix is looking at because I always felt I paid the extra and if my kid had to pay he wouldn't(he's cheap) and I would have no reason to keep it.Just some thoughts.
Is a entry point people or still a little more down to go!!
Weird. Rarely do I feel so good about a stock that loses 21 points in a day.
"Netflix since inception gave a great product with exceptional value to its customers. They have not strayed from that mission and that mission worked very well for them in the form of customer loyalty to the brand. Consumer knows that there are not that many companies out there that are customer centric, to name a few like Costco. Netflix could have made a boatload more of money but instead focus on delivering quality product at reasonable cost."
Highest day since July 27 (366.85)
The stock is great but all the negative attention is just a drag to wait it out. The Netflix train is slow to climb in price followed by a long long slow bleed
Netflix now has a higher market cap then Disney!
If Netflix has taught me anything. That is how to stomach seeing your stock go down 30% knowing no one is near this company’s current market. Going to keep holding.
Definitely thought Disney earnings would make this tank
Sellers before the long week end.
"With that Comcast alliance announced today, I would expect the guidance to be pushed up well beyond current expectations."
At minimum NFLX will reach the $330....mark on April 16th....Bet on it..$$$$$$...I love it.$$$$$$
Just remember all these new streaming service are in it not by choice but are force into it due to Netflix success. Profitability for any of these new players is at least 5 years away
It was a good run but the bubble has finally popped!
now we’re negative for the year 
"Any good company who protects investors lowers the guidance ahead of time, FB does, MSFT does, everyone doe it,Netflix hasn't lowered the guidance for this quarter, so their numbers would be blockbuster.I'm seeing 430 after hours!!!!"
"It seems like people are pulling out of all tech except AMZN. At NFLX current price the a miss on earnings at 420 (a week ago), is already priced in. If they crush earnings beware."

I prepare to buy more at 310.
Covered yesterday. Just shorted more again.
Apple's strong income from subscription services like Apple Music only means one thing for Netflix. Stronger competition. Apple can easily bundle video streaming with Apple Music for a higher fee. Netflix is feeling the competition from all angles. Both Disney and Apple are much stronger brand names than Netflix globally...

385-390 is so close. Don’t worry about it.
Holding 600 at the range of 290-315.
"I think this election today could def affect NFLX. If the lefties get in, watch for strict lockdowns (which will be good for NFLX). I used to laugh at the conspiracies when both sides in the past would scream about election stealing and fraud, but with what I saw the DNC do in the primaries in 2016, and from what came out in my own state a few short years ago (and there were prosecutions) I don't laugh anymore. The DEMS really could steal this thing...."

See you guys at 300
Why is insider ownership in NFLX only....1.81% ?
Selling 2/12 Puts on NFLX at 460 strike. free money...
They increased $2 monthly on 80-100 million subs. Thats 2.4 billion off 3 billion yearly debt. Numbers still dont add up. They need minimum $5 price increase to offset cost/debt to start to have positive cash flow. But at that price they wont be competitive anymore and will need to spend more to retain customers. And at this point Its not a growth stock anymore and it shouldnt be trading at 100+ PE.
"NFLX usually drops 15-20 points after the earning, but soon recovers in next few days.i will buy some calls 2 days after the earning....Wednesday..if my palms start itching I MAY BUY FEW PUTS IN AM to make double dip"
"NFLX is finished - at least for the time being. All analysts have upgraded and pumped to the max, the stock is up 40% YTD, they will sing the same old story about international growth blah blah blah - but the facts are that NFLX is burning cash at an alarming rate, the stock is way overvalued and it has $10 billion of debt with no end in sight to the cash bleed, which means more debt issuance is unavoidable, which makes the stock more risky and the interest rate paid higher."
Trump's speech confirmed trade war with China/Europe/Canada/Mexico......markets will crash very soon folks. The trade war will accelerate the deflation of the current bubble (get out now if you have profits and thank me later).
The fun has just begun. Bloodbath continuing AH and will likely follow through tomorrow big time.

People/families can afford Pizza  no matter what their financial stability is. So! Therefore!!!! People/Families can afford Netflix no matter what and it’s less than the price of a pizza ! Netflix is here to stay and the new subscribers will continue to join world wide. When you buy Netflix you hold on to it..."
"The last I posted about Pi, it was trading unofficially at $0.2x per coin and that is now all the way up to $1.22 and there are over 10 million miners/pioneers mining coins on their phones. Search on google, ""pi network coin value"" and you will be able to see current unofficial quote.Before you skip the post thinking it's useless for you, check out where BitCoin is trading today. It's over $34,000 per coin. I am not saying that pi will be that successful, but what if it even reaches $100 per coin in the future? Even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year, those coins can be worth a significant amount of money.In any way, you NEVER have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi, it's open for anyone to mine on their phone as BitCoin was in earlier days. Just download the Pi network app on your phone, use invitation code ""celebration26"" when registering (it's by invitation only), and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future, they will verify that if you are the person who you said you are.As far as my progress, I have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about $10k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially."

Boy if he can denuke NK and make peace between the North and South. We're talking Noble Peace Prize, reelection, and maybe MSNBC and CNN will start reporting how great he is. Nah!"
this was what I felt and stated before market open today: investment banks co-plot to upgrade stocks so as to push DOW up and break through 24000 points.
"I think this will go back up, prob a good opportunity to buy at the dip."
3Q numbers for NETFLIX are gonna be LIT! 1.) Will exceed estimated gain in subscribers 2.) Will exceed estimated earnings per share3.) Will blow past $450Remember you heard it hear 1st

Waiting for Disney streaming service to cancel Netflix
"Personally , I resigned from Netflix when they announced their deal w the Obama’s family. That family will not get another one of my $ if I can help if."
Tomorrow 325 - 310
"It is perfectly fine for NFLX to sign Obama up. It will not be perfectly fine if NFLX becomes a propaganda machine for the progressive movement. This is what ABC, NBC, CBS, and all of their affiliates have become. What a disaster that has become for them. And you have no idea how many people are turned off by, and never watch those channels. Another example is the Hollywood elites. Oscar ratings were historically low by a wide margin because many simply refuse to listen to the political garbage that is spewed as well as the ridicule they are subject to because they don't share the views of liberal elites.Mark my words. If NFLX gets into bed with one side of the political spectrum, they will lose massive numbers of customers. Reed Hastings made it known how much he hates Trump as he threatened to resign from FB board because Peter Thiel was on the FB board and Thiel supported Trump. So while signing Obama is fine (it's a free country where diversity of opinion is supposed to be welcomed - unless you are not a progressive of course), if NFLX starts this march towards becoming a liberal propaganda machine, it is going to get cut down to size."
HBO Max is better in my opinion.
Its going lower.... why
Thanks All. NFLX has no exposure in China....collateral damage
I know nothing but these numbers aren’t bad. They had to spend money to get international and produce original content. They added 8.84 subscribers beat expectations on that and EPS. That’s a growing business. Am I wrong?
Just bought at 312..volume settled down. Yesterday's volume was 3x the average daily volume. Up from here
"Apr 16, 2018. Netflix, Inc. is expected* to report earnings on 04/16/2018 after the close. I think the stock goes back over 300 before earnings."
I praying for a 10-1 split go Netflix
disneh plus to dethrone netflix
NFLX will see $350 before $400
looks like they beat nicely...
close 395.66
This won't drop until volume picks up. For some reason all of the negative press hasn't had a major impact.
Buying opportunity

"A lot of people actually cancelled the services due to boring netflix movies, too old. Only the new ones are fine."
Netflix is in uncharted territory. Valuation is determined by comparing to similar companies. People want to nail Netflix down to a certain valuation but there is no other company to compare it with. So the stock just keeps climbing higher because the perceived high valuation is in reality low.
"It only has a forward PE of 61 and trades at 11x revenue but what's not to like? Meanwhile shipping tankers trade at 1.9x, ZM trades higher than XOM with 0.5% of their revenue. Bubble, nah."

Awesome buy after 10% correction

NFLX is projected to more than double its EPS this year'; up from 1.25 to 2.85. That's huge!
"About to go green folks. Just like yesterday. Down $4 early, then the buying frenzy starts."
By Friday right back to 400s. Amateur panic sellers just make us big investors big more money.
This is very interesting... is either going up or down or flat.... one of those 3 scenarios for sure

"Today's trading was highly unusual. Simple fact is - no matter what your opinion is, given the extreme pressure on the market, there was no reason for NFLX to trade in the green all day. AH, the stock went down on small volume (as it went up AH yesterday on small volume).Interesting to monitor. I am sure others are."

$392 before next earnings

"I told everyone to forget about AMZN, FB and the rest of the FAANGS and buy NFLX. Just look at this thing, it's like the Emerald City over here."
So wen this thing was trading around 250 less than a month ago there was no buyer now it’s almost $100 more and people are all over it because a so-called analyst said u should buy? Seriously? What has fundamentally changed about the company from a month ago?
let's get back to US$400!

Honestly if I watch an hour or two of television a day it is on Netflix. I get to watch whatever I want when I want it is that simple. My kids go crazy if I turn on Direct TV Now because they don't get why there are only certain shows on at any given time. Netflix could double its rates tomorrow and I would still keep the subscription and I'm probably not the only one.
"Not short or long, just watching volatility and wondering what makes NFLX so loved? Modest growth and minimal profits...lots of companies do this. Just saying...."
Great time to buy but in increments.
Buying continues on NFLX stock because their revenues are increasing two fold each qtr! Earning will be HUGE!
"can some one keep buying stock till $270, i have to short more,"
If I had to choose to go all in on one company it most likely would be $WIMI $NFLX $FB
can anyone suggest what would the good price to purchase 100 shares?
Netflix will 320 soon

I was looking at buying some Netflix stock but the PE ratio has me very concerned. looks way over bought?
Time to buy ?
She’s moving fast! 
Remember I said last night Netflix will be back up! already coming back up in premarket $$$
"Mark Tepper, president of Strategic Wealth Partners, is a long-term bull on Netflix, but its outsized move in recent weeks has him nervous.“I would be a seller of this thing ahead of earnings. It’s up 50 percent since Christmas Eve so I think a lot of the good news has already been priced in,” Tepper said on “Trading Nation” on Thursday."
No reason to be bullish on this stock. Netflix CEO even admitted again today that competition is hurting their subs... The dynamics have changed. Soon every company will be streaming their content and those companies have far more original content than Netflix since they’ve been producing for DECADES. Just the reality. Netflix is no longer unique in streaming. They certainly ain’t unique in content. Basically they have NO MOAT. Their business is under attack at every angle from competitors.
In the red tomorrow. Will be back below 500 shortly. Dream on holders. Cash in tomorrow. Your days are over. You will thank me for the advice!!!
"This quarter is after price hike, it is going to be blow out! Netflix India is growing faster than analyst imagine."

Should test 305 on the open monday
Anyone shorting like I have?
"if NFLX has good earnings, how high will it go AH? better to sell AH or on Friday? any thoughts?"
Calling $500+ after 4Q earnings report in January 2019.
Just incredible...not expected at all by the market. Amazing figures....I was expecting something good but not that good!
The rally will continue till the earnings
Down market.....NFLX Positive!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! .....GREAT!!!!!
"Falling Revenues, TANKING Earnings and yet $NFLX BUBBLE is getting PUMPED again!What a PONZI SCHEME!"
Imagine how bad the selling will be if it loses that post earnings 344 level.
Bottom line NFLX has hit the ceiling in US. Too many new cheaper choices coming to take customers away. Amazon prime continues to grow. Disney. Comcast. Universal. Etc etc Soon they will opt for Hulu model and add a monthly plan with ads. Cannot remain at this valuation burning 2 to 3B per year
"nasdaq bull take it higher, take it higer"
"This comes down to a simple question. Did you wanna buy nflx at $400 or $340 and possibly lower. People these are opportunities to get in and they come around once a year if that, so take advantage."

Interesting in that it lost $55 quickly and stayed within a buck or two of that the entire AH session.
"I recently canceled my Netflix subscription after many years. The content (to me) seems more geared toward a politically correct message than pure entertainment. It's not that I'm opposed to the messages, but I just don't find it entertaining to be preached to (hit over the head again and again) with what seems to be a SJW propaganda. I know this post will be deleted in about 15 minutes, so read it while you can."
550 on the way
Down just a percent; got to see the open tomorrow

"Netflixx to buy Viacom/CBS Netflix Should Buy ViacomCBS | About: ViacomCBS Inc. (VIAC), VIACA, NFLX, VIA, VIAB, Includes: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.A, BRK.B, DIS, FB, GOOG, GOOGL, TJune 2. 2020Paul Franke Paul FrankeContrarian, long/short equity, momentum, Deep Value(6,000 followers)SummaryThe Netflix business model is under competitive attack and risks becoming the next America Online boom/bust example of a changing technology landscape.Without free cash flow and a much larger library of media content, Netflix cannot win the coming streaming wars.Only a bold and masterful move by management to acquire a company like ViacomCBS will keep the Netflix stock quote around present levels.The Viacom-CBS business combination is almost complete and could be a long-term buy regardless of any Netflix moves.Netflix (NFLX) is in big trouble without a grand stroke of genius by management in coming months. I propose the company fix its two biggest competitive problems - the lack of both owned content and free cash generation - before it’s too late. Netflix’s middleman streaming business model between customers and media content assets will not cut it anymore. By acquiring the new ViacomCBS combined media enterprise as soon as possible, Netflix can turn lemons into lemonade. Purchasing a huge library of entertainment assets to broadcast over the internet, while immediately adding $3-5 billion in cash flow and earnings generation each year, would put the embattled Netflix stock quote back on track.Management at Netflix is rapidly coming to realize a stand-pat operating model of paying billions annually to create/rent streaming content, while its high subscription selling price per month is coming under attack by new competition, is a lose-lose proposition going into 2020. The only way forward is to make a bold move, specifically a transformative merger with an important media content owner.Sumner Redstone and his National Amusement entity hold about 79% voting control of the soon-to-be-merged CBS Corporation (CBS, CBS.A) and Viacom Inc. (VIAB, VIA). I think an all-stock Netflix deal to buy out ViacomCBS in late 2019 or early 2020 would be an ideal ending statement for his long career in entertainment ownership and production. Who wouldn’t want to become one of the largest shareholders in a reinvigorated, high-growth return Netflix? After subpar investment gains from his companies for several decades versus the media industry, a sellout to Netflix may prove to be his grandest and smartest achievement. Sometimes, the simplest answer is the best answer. Netflix’s board and management only have to negotiate with the Redstone family to work out a price.Below are graphs of some of the television/film content ViacomCBS owns.Source: CBS and Viacom Investor SlideshowDuring 2016, I outlined the argument on Seeking Alpha for Disney (DIS) to acquire Netflix when its quote was around $120 a share. The merger would have allowed Disney to quickly enter and basically control the world of streaming video/entertainment content all over the world. Apparently, Disney’s CEO, Bob Iger, did not like the steep entry fee back then, around $50 billion to buy out the premier global streaming company. Of course, feeling left behind a few years later, Mr. Iger decided to purchase $70 billion in Fox content assets, and will likely spend tens of billions more building out Disney’s streaming service about to begin in November.Now the big boys are all coming to play in Netflix’s backyard. Everyone is entering the streaming business and spending billions to become even bigger players. Disney+, Google’s Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and YouTube, Apple (AAPL) TV, Amazon (AMZN) Prime, Facebook (FB) and AT&T (T) Time Warner have all announced media content investments or new spending sprees in the tens of billions to roll out greater streaming options for consumers globally. The competitive environment for Netflix could easily turn it into the America Online situation of the 1990s tech bubble peak. Basically, AOL grew at an astounding clip to become the largest and only truly functioning Microsoft Windows (MSFT)-compatible online access company for U.S. consumers between 1993 and 1999. Then, competition and a changing Internet access landscape showed up and ran AOL into the ground. Could Netflix suffer the same fate? I have openly wondered about Netflix’s business fortunes past 2019, and have been short the stock off and on this year.Netflix is Expensive, ViacomCBS is CheapThe argument for an all-stock deal, where Netflix just mints new shares to hand out to Sumner (and a few others) for ownership of ViacomCBS, is compelling right now. CBS and Viacom are late to the game in streaming, planning to spend future cash flow and earnings to catch up. Why not join forces with the world’s largest streaming service, filling your business model void overnight, while helping Netflix to plug its major gaps? Talk about a win-w"

People storming capitol now
This is going down this week.
Wow the market is very red today. What is going on today. A lot of other companies are down 6 to 10%. It will go back up. It’s following the market right now. It’s a trend
"Susan Rice appointed a member of the board? Not surprised as NFLX is just another left-leaning company. In fact, I could care less if it wasn't for Benghazi. But I now care, and I am cancelling."
"Unfortunately it did not move as i expected ...specially with great results and guidance and backlog of programs. NFLX will be future studios, streaming king and content leader . This will be way above 600 in year due to potential . 1 down days versus highest % wise growth in pricing this year . Tomorrow this will be back to 450 . I just loaded some more at 420"
"I bought 350 calls and 300 puts for May with a $ ratio of about 5:1, so I'm playing for a big move up here. This is contrary to my views the past few weeks. Mostly because we fell into 340s here the expectations are a bit lower now. Furthermore, the puts will limit losses and possibly be profitable in the event this drops big tomorrow. If this doesn't move at all, I'm fine with that too, I cut my losses from expensive options going into earnings and get into something else."
rapid expansion continues:https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-production-hub-new-york-city-1203192541/
apple beat stock up big in ah. should help NFLX rebound tomorrow along with Fed cut.
We must be near a market top when Netflix rises $84/sh for a mediocre earnings performance. WOW!
Any suggestions on an entry price? Thanks in advance
Here it comes!
Come on move like $NFLX is moving now
i do like netflix but it's too expensive...fair value is at 280
Buy below $500.00
"Someone is working hard to keep our Netflix down . Alas , she will rise today . Too many subs to ignore ."
No Netflix is not facing competition overseas. Yes Netflix is winning original content award. Yes people know it. Yes people want entertainment. No people don’t mind 10$ a month. No none of the above is a factor in the stock market. Yes this is fall is market wide. Buy and forget
My guess is Netflix beats handily but the stock sells off in spite of it

FANG = The casino stocks!
Wow I have to say this is brutal just in the fact that if you didn't get in you felt bad. When you see moves like this it gives you the opportunity to make a boatload of money. Now we know what side to play for earnings or shortly there after. Hang on this is going down as fast or faster than it went up. I always say I don't know what I am looking for in a pattern or know which way a stock is heading but when it presents itself YOU WILL KNOW. This is one of those times.

"Totally insane reaction. NFLX is already the most overvalued stock in the index. A 28% growth rate is not high enough to bring its 300 PE down to reasonable levels for decades. On top of this, they MISSED revenue projections by $80million ($2.20b vs expected $2.28b), are experiencing NEGATIVE CASH FLOW, and are going further into debt. Any one of these three negatives would take a non-darling stock down 20%. All three would...pick a number... down 35%? But yet, in this crooked (can you say rigged?) market, it goes up. I'm not long or short. Just an observation that there are many, many companies that are superior to NFLX that would get absolutely hammered for producing results like this."

"Goldman Sachs argument to justify higher price makes no sense. Netflix will be paying more due to higher interest rates, they will be spending more as they add more debt to create their own content and as they pay more for licensing others' content and they will be losing Disney content.

"Why no one discussing Citron report. In past he made headlines. 90% of his call turn out true. He is well known short seller Here is my contradian theory:- Clearly with At&t merger, Net naturality change, Netflix going to have tough time keeping up, On top of them, ISPs will demand share of revenue sooner or later to deliver to home.Big player want that and so they create big plan to push all retain investor into Stock and exit. Now They need time to slowly sell all those huge number of share they purchased and so they basically making sure report like this not become well known."

"Wait until after the shutdown for the real major leg down. Because of the government shutdown, the Treasury hasn’t been issuing checks at its usual pace. In the first half of January when it was expected to issue $75 billion in new debt, it has issued ZERO! That’s $75 billion that gets to live in the financial markets for another couple of days, in fact as long as the government shutdown grinds on.. That will keep the stock and bond markets liquified, when they would otherwise have been starved for cash."
It might close the week at $265 or around.
If they add 30M subscribers this year and 38M next year the stock should cross 1000.
The day before Netflix releases its quarterlies Deutsche Bank - fined over $600 million for laundering billions for the Russians stated that Netflix has a great chance of missing its numbers. Great. Thanks Deutsche Bank - where international mob cartels go to launder money and where Donald Trump has gotten his projects financed for the past 20 years. A name to trust.

I’m holding on to my loss for another week to see what happens. I bought on 400$ and I hope it will come near tha amount in a couple weeks. If not just cut the losses and move on."
"You can not believe it there are over 5000 people in Cebug school district, 10,000 students in Taiwan, 85,000 students in Shanghai, and 65,000 students in Vietnam want to subscribe Netflex after they hear Barack is signing up series!Barack is a giant figure! Think about it! So many Thai in Thailand also want to subscribe Netflex after they hear Barack series...Netflex CEO is correct. He needs to thank for Barack's signing up for Netflex series!"
I'm buying at some point.
Netflix needs to cut prices or lose subscribers to Disney. Either option is terrible for stock.

https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/netflix-original-spending-85-percent-1202809623/@Tilly it was Netflix who cancelled the the Marvel TV series and instead of licensing movies from Disney Netflix decided to spend the money on original content instead. Ted Sarandon clearly says that in the following interview.
"""So much value here. $NFLX is $540 with 240b market cap.CIDM is below $2 with less than 300m market cap. I don't think $NFLX is even close to 1000 times better than $CIDM. Highly undervalued! Do your down DD and get in ASAP. Easy 10x"" -Stockwits post"

I'll probably go to cash as I have no idea on direction.
F it. I'm keeping my long term long position for another 5 years and shorting with house money under 319. I wish I knew how to do options.
"Why is this still down doesn’t make any sense NFLX beat ER all FANGS are up, whoever that selling or shorting this will regret it badly come after hours."
"If you don't pay for NFLX, you will. No more scams."
Why would I want Netflix when Disney has a better lineup of shows. Netflix is the next Blockbuster. This is a short of a lifetime.

I'm not a holder of Netflix but it seems to me it will soon be a buying opportunity.
Bernstein says Netflix should easily get to 90M US subscribers and John Malone says scale going from US to global is 10x which means Netflix should easily get to 900M subscribers.
"“But Netflix’s management has already shown that it is willing and able to deal with potential pitfalls in a proactive way. The company reports its second-quarter results on July 16, and is likely to show another big increase in sales.When that happens, the momentum could carry the stock all the way to $500.”https://investorplace.com/2018/06/can-netflix-hit-500/"
"The market is looking at virus as adding to Netflix Subscribers, but when the economy pulls back so does spending and Netflix is an extra expense no one needs."
"My objective two cents on earnings:Content spend will be outrageously highSubs will be ,Price increase announcement was an attempt to neutralize content spend.Will it work? Who knows. We will find out Thursday but any stock that has increased 50% in a month is primed for a correction"
A big misconception is Netflix got big because they never had serious competition. Hulu (Disney Comcast) along with Amazon had to be serious competition for tiny Netflix back when. It only makes sense being the major media company it is today Netflix competition has to be weaker than ever. It will be confirmed when the stock rises to 1000 next year.
bird box cost a lot to make. How much money did it even make NFLX? what a few more people signed up? people who want NFLX already have it. They made zero off everyone who already has it... think
https://www.google.com/amp/s/investorplace.com/2015/12/netflix-stock-nflx-insiders/amp/
Thankfully I got the dip.
how many people think that report will be bad on Monday?
I’m selling 2 more of my PUTS with 187% gain!Thanks NFLX lovers! Keep holding! 
"Almost made back the loss from yesterday. Only opened .02 in the red. Then dropped 3.44 from there. Bit spike from there at 10. High for the day was 360.45. Still the highest since October.Up 11.50 for the week, 19.59 for the month and 91.41 for the year.Should have a big surge next weeks because of the Oscars."
"Give us a bone at least maybe a stock split, buy-back, tiny acquisition?Just to shake this short purgatory"
"Netflix subscriber by countryUSA:- 54.75M ( 126.22M total house hold) = 1 in 2.5 has netflix (With Sharing this likely 1 in 1.5)UK:- 8M+ ( based on 7.5M in 3Q2017 (27M house hold) = 1 in 3.5 has netflixAustralia:- 2.5M+ ( 1 in 3 based on 7M house holds)My point is NFLX is quickly reaching very high penetration in developed countries. In developing country scope of such service is never significant. For example in India, Netflix still struggling.While it admire how quickly NFLX gone international, valuation can't justified given not as much growth left in market where it popular and affordable."
"Name one reason why Netflix will be the content king for the next 10 years ? Because CONTENT is king, Netflix will never be a long term play compared to the library Disney owns. It is like David and Goliath. Anyone can stream, but not everyone has content that will survive over the next decade. Name one iconic show or movie that Netflix owns that the “world” would pay for more than $10/month."
"Few buyers, volume very soft."
"All bull aside, is jumping into some Netflix shares directly before earnings Friday before the bell closes worth the risk? I am well aware of it’s recent run up, been sitting on the sidelines waiting for this stock to pull back and lost out. Thumbs up for a Hell Yes or Thumbs Down for a no, you’ll get burned"
"Using Day Trader Josh's swing trading system, the 328.00 support on daily chart ( low on 7/31/18), its holding above here for 9 days. One of Josh's rules for an established swing level requires a 10 day hold above/below a support/Resistance, this means that going LONG here above 328 is very risky for SWINGS. Especially when market is at all-time highs and due for sharp NATURAL pullback. Investors dont worry, just hold...but swing traders, wait for 228 to break (or come close, below 330) before getting back in this beast. Now, if NFLX does NOT go back down, then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels, and start our shorts again for quick 5-10 pullbacks. Again, we DO NOT guess direction, we instead wait patiently on sidelines till price comes to us. Way less stress and we ALWAYS get a damn good entry with this strategy. But there is far more to Day Trader Josh's strategy then what I just mapped out here. But at least you get the framework. Essentially, we are counter-trend trading, for quick (1 to 5 day) profits off the reversals in price. Although, in key situations (like earnings) we get far more then 10 points on NFLX, both LONG&SHORT."
"Experience tells me that all short-term stock price changes are driven by capital, while long-term performance is driven by solid results $GOOG $WIMI $NFLX"
Remember when a stock comes down where it becomes flat it allows the buyers that’s wants in for a pull down and when shorts recover it will take the stock higher. This one was flat for 5-6 straight days.
"Look at the future trend of social development, find the right to hold firmly $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX"
"The companies being the hardest hit these days are those with lots of debt. NFLX is a DEBT LADEN company with negative free cash flow of over $3.0 billion. Stated debt on balance sheet is $15.0 BILLION. There is an additional $5.0 BILLION disclosed in the debt footnote in their filings. And there is an additional $10+ billion in debt like contingencies which didn't qualify to be consolidated on he balance sheet. So we have $30 Billion in debt just there for a company which stays alive each year by borrowing but credit markets are now closed. Netflix does not make any more money just because people watch more. In fact, they make loss as it increases their streaming costs to serve up the content. Maybe facts don't matter with a cult stock-but everything I said is a fact which is in their most recent 10K."
Stiflel announced price target 390. Analyst said - Comcast is a very well-run company but face is ongoing challenges in a rapidly changing video landscape. Netflix on the other hand is also a well-run company but without the burden of a legacy business to protect. ￼
"Raymond James' Justin Patterson upgraded the stock to strong buy from outperform. He also hiked his price target on Netflix to $450 per share from $435, implying a 38 percent surge from Thursday's close."
Nice rebound.
Yep! Smashed numbers
"More streaming does not equal more $$$. More streaming equals more cost. They have to pay AWS for compute and storage. People are tightening their belts, not adding Netflix. Cost are up, subscribers may even be down. $NFLX is overvalued."
CONGRADS TO ALL OF U LONGS!!!!!
So buy netflix and hold to 1000?
Netflix at a discount!
"Which analyst will bail out Netflix tomorrow. They have been saved by multiple analyst on every sell-off. Eventually, they will run out of upgrades based on previous stated upgrades."
can someone please tell me where the future growth will be coming from. is this an international play? Why would anyone own Netflix over other high growth tech companies? Netflix seems to have much more competition than others and they don't make money.
good price to buy now?
"This company is one of the best in the market. Just buy it, and chill"
Wait till the real selling begins tomorrow.
A lot of time I feel like I am all powerful and only I can save the market.How? I simply sell my shares. And stock is guaranteed to instantly go up after that.
phenomenal growth.
"“As we generate excess cash we will explore returning cash to shareholders through ongoing stock buybacks”. Terrific, but my shares aren’t for sale Netflix."

At this rate NFLX will buy Mickey
$255 this Friday is possible. Hold off short...
Expected a better day for NFLX
"The whole market was down today, like Monday."
Is it just me or do I see a huge block trade on ever stock around 10 am today. Buy backs?
Any idea why we have a 4% drop today! No news that I could find. Earnings don't come out for another 46 days.
"Investment banks need to protect their institutional bond investor's, especially those that jumped in early. It's about transferring risk from bond holders to shareholders. Look for a stock offering in the near future to retire some of the older bonds; those euro bonds probably won't be retired, they are probably held by the ECB. They will say it's for ""content"" ""general purposes,"" etc., the main purpose is to protect the bond holders.With the recent drop in NFLX, there may be a push to move forward with this."
WOOHOO! Most of my loses from the past 3 years made up in a week of NFLX calls.
"I'm sorry to rain on your parade but a.....125 PE Ratio.... according to current Yahoo data, unfortunately is NOT.... sustainable.MTNB "
"I think a forward P/E of 40 is reasonable for a growth stock like $NFLX. That would put the stock at about $230, but I will be generous and say it should be around $250"
No Obama!!!!!!
Everybody knows Netflix numbers will be much better then expected this time because of the great shows that came out in November and December. All those that signed up then are paying now. Next to that the price increase.
When do they report
$380 by Friday.
"if market goes up tomorrow. 11,202 open contract at 600 and 5,193 at 620..... should pop and then drop"
"“Apptopia said Disney+ competitors, including Netflix and Amazon.com Inc's Prime Video, remain largely unaffected in terms of their performance during the same period”"
This has been my issue with tech stocks for a long time. What may take months or years to gain can be lost in days or a week.
Back to 325 and to 330 by 45 minutes
I wonder how shorty is feeling right now.
Buying time. Support at 276.64
I made tons of money shorting stocks. Shorting in this market is a lot safer and easier than going long
US business of Netflix will begin its inexorable decline starting in 2H 2019
"Apple and Google and Disney and .... are spending and will spend billions to create streaming video.Do you suppose that will affect Netflix's bottome line?The forward PE is probably pie in the sky.PE more than likely to go up significantly, which will cause the stock price to dive."
Some institutions are dumping......back to 450 for NFLX in AH
"hey, who's short out there?? Feeling some pain???"
Well now we all know why $NFLX was up yesterday. People in the know were front running the upgrade this morning. Kind of blatant but we know nothing will happen.
"Hard to buy puts with this kind of euphoria. There's a top, but it could be a blowoff top at $450 or $480."
Will turn green buy buy buy
HBO Max is better than Netflix in my honest opinion.
"rumor proves true, this stock immediately is worth triple what it currently sits at. The market cap is absolutely insane if this pushes through. $NIO $WIMI $NFLX"
"EPS met, subscribers was missed... so"
https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-netflix-shares-will-plummet-fund-manager-51556731141
Last hour of trading......I expect buying to pickup as people will not want to miss the run up due to earnings! Per my projections from early last week when the price was $360 I was expecting NFLX to reach $450 before market close today (I guess I got very close given the $439 right now)! Am still looking for a major blowout EPS ($2.05) and a HUGE total for new additional subscriptions globally!! This would convert to a price above $500 on earnings announcement!!
"Wall Street awards growth but pivots on a dime in the absence of it.Five quarters NFLX subscriptions grew, NFLX doubled in price.Yesterday, growth was not there; NFLX fell 15%"

stops being knocked out...scared money dont make money. Z
Anyone worried NFLX is not in the sports realm?Disney got espn comcast got sky (premier league is bigger than all NBA NFL and MLB combined)
people hate to see success when they have no idea how to obtain it.
380 today
Selling 1st thing in the am. Then will buy back after it drops into the 230 Range
Lots of short covering today after GS positive notes on NFLX: Pre-Market 285 plus

By Friday this will be around 260
"EPS estimates for NFLX keep dropping, which means multiple should contract, not expand. There is so much you can inflate a bubble stock."
They say every dog has its day. This thing has had 30 days of being a dog!!!
increase subscribers without increasing profits. It is contradicting. Are they real subscribers?
NFLX down 10% since earnings pop. Gave up all gains YTD. The market is speaking loud and clear.
Does this look like a rising wedge?
Subscriber growth will exceed 10 million. Company guidance was ultra cautious and it set an extremely low bar that will be handily exceeded
if it didn't drop at the last half hour before the bell it will not drop at all today... road to 600
"The only justification the bulls have for justifying this NFLX valuation is comparing it to Amazon, but they're very different companies. Amazon could reap AMAZING profits in a heartbeat if they wanted to stop spending all of their profits into growth. How is NFLX ever going to make considerable money without jacking the rates up to near cable levels?"
i bought a few 550 call options to day at 3.75 strike is 1-22-2021 any idea what they might be tomorrow if it can hold after hours gains
Huge shorting pressure is what dropped this stock. Once people start covering then it should start going up
buy the dips?
buying all the shorts i can for the short term
The prodigious market cap is making me believe the stock market as a whole currently has a specious valuation
no way we are gonna continue being trash for another week. $NFLX $WIMI $FB
"Netflix is going to hit 550 by the end of the day, wait for the massive surge of dip buyers today."
Sell some Netflix and buy American Express going up today earnings
"The stock has been ahead of the analysts with a -8% return this year. Citi and others who late last week said free cash flow will not be black in 2021, and a bad Disney comparison. I guess up after a beat Tuesday, since there have been 3 misses, -5, -11, -19% last three quarters"
amc gme koss all tanked ..AGAIN NETFLIX IS THE KING
I decide not to sell any put until tuesday next week. And i will stop watching this stock (Except once in two hour) I know this not even worth $300. So I should not worry regardless what happen. Anything go up too fast normally come down. Stock price growing with result is healthy. When it get out of sync it's very risky.
Bought 400sh in 2009. NFLX is putting my son through school. Little to complain about with this company.
Will it go beyond 290 at all ??
500 million in buys equates to 26 billion added market cap when they didn’t even beat earnings estimates
"This will go up big today, earning after hour and giving the record and history of nexflix people will want to get in before earning. After earning, this thing will rocket up to the moon"
Netflix is like a cult right now with the original content they are producing. They got me hook line and sinker as I’m addicted to some of their shows. I’d pay $30/month. Millions feel the same way can guarantee it. $2 raise?? Please.
"I am short and bear of Netflix, but appreciate all the bulls for their courage to hold it through earnings . Good luck"
Nasdaq heading to retest $7500 real soon. A lot of tech stocks earnings coming out beginning of May!
Hoping for $365 towards close - have a ton of 360 calls that expire today
I called it: NFLX will close at -5 to -6%. It closed at -5.7%. Tomorrow this will open from -1% to +1%
or will implode tomorrow overacted same old
NFLX==confusing stock==market does not like its story!==sell!
Buy now and thank me later.
600$ soon! Great company!
Is this for real how about earnings
i am never getting rid of netflix
Picking up nicely
Not touching my 10 shares live long and prosper
What's is going on???!! Is this a FB affect?
Feel bad for anyone bought in today. Beware the over valued high PE stocks.
"@Benjamin and Josh, You both made your point. Buy a few Netflix stocks now and shake hands before this gets uggly."

"NFLX 80% institutional ownership, NFLX is going back up"
"Some time back, I bought Amazon, just before earnings report, at $400.00 a share. After they reported, it went down significantly, so out of fear, I sold. I think now, what it would be if I had just held on. Now over $1800.00. Hardest thing to do when investing in the stock market is to have patience. Don't look back some day and wish you had just held on to NFLX."
$400 here we come...
if this goes green it will be on the news tonight
I use to have Netflix but switched to HBO Max and glad I did.
"I applaud those who bought calls and/or stock ahead of earnings. I played it somewhat safe and deployed a $525/$540 call spread. So my upside is capped at $540. Still, it was minimal risk for what will be a nice return tomorrow."
Pps bloated beyond belief.HBO Max far superior!!After Queens Gambit nothingreally great added.Mediocrity at best!!!
Below 500 by years end
but will be 430+ before ER??? who with me??
"Yeterday 7% jump was indication of way over excitement. I love it specially since Friday I have 800 short cover from my put excercise, leaving only 500. I was considering to cover rest but thought to do it around 290. Yesterday I had chance again but thought sell off is solid. No regret. I will slowly add more while keep selling out of money put for premium.with earning around I should able to bring my average price from $325 to $345 with all calls and puts profit. Premium into earning will be killing and will help make me money. I am fearless and will sell near money calls and puts to take maximum advantage.I shorted 315 call yesterday at close and also short 100 at 320 and 100 at 323 this morning. Plan to keep adding short for every $10 increase."
Netflix Expected to Spend as Much as $15 Billion on Content This YearThat makes last year's $12 billion look like chump change.
Wow TSLA down 17.58
425 earning
"Netflix (NFLX) has 2 splits in our Netflix stock split history database. The first split for NFLX took place on February 12, 2004. This was a 2 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 2 shares. For example, a 1000 share position pre-split, became a 2000 share position following the split. NFLX's second split took place on July 15, 2015. This was a 7 for 1 split, meaning for each share of NFLX owned pre-split, the shareholder now owned 7 shares. For example, a 2000 share position pre-split, became a 14000 share position following the split."
Held this stock for 8 years. Seen all the downward slides only to see it come roaring back to all time highs a few months later. This blip will be forgotten by next earnings. See you all above $420 by end of year.
"It was a nice run from being a bag holder to making a profit and exiting too early! Was not sure what the fed was doing and thought it prudent to exit with a sort of decent profit! I admire you longs who held in there, especially with the nice pop AH! Go long, stay strong! Good luck!"
Today's short covering and buy force may bid NFLX up 8%+!
The ticker looks like it’s gonna explode lol
"D+ is a complimentary service geared towards children. Adults have already seen what they want to view in regards to their content and will not spend much time, if any on their library of legacy titles.New content, which NFLX is heavily leveraged, will be the driver for growth past the initial enrollment euphoria of D+Reruns of Hannah Montana will not retain viewership."
A lot of resistance at $340
I just sold my house to buy NFLX stock.
recovery day
Netflix has corrected more in the past. It will recover.
SEPTEMBER 18th CALLS don’t expire until 2 month after next Earnings Report. HEAVY ACCUMULATION on weakness. Switching from June 19th Calls to September 18th Calls. 
Green monday! Dow futures climbing!
By order of the PEaky Blinders!!
To 380$ Are you ready guys?
"$375,00 $385.00 Good Luck Netflix FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Take advantage of the artificially low volume pump stock price today and sell before the dump. As I have said in the past, ask your CPA for their opinion on holding a stock of a company that has a current P/E ratios of over 200 and see what they tell you. The whole market is in a huge bubble getting ready to pop folks."
When is this going to 405 so i can unload..?
Bought 200 shares in 2002 at $25 sold at $12 because Walmart and Blockbuster were getting into dvd mail rental. These 200 shares woukl be worth $620000 today. Sigh.
"Technically, the 3 day losing streak ended..Had it ended in the RED, it would have been only the 4th time since July of 2016 that it ended RED when the high reached at least 9.Worst close in the GREEN when the high reaches at least 9.I guess it's better than losing 11.14 like the average had been for the last 3 days."
why the price drops like crazyafter nflx beat the earnings on 7/17/2019 ?
anyone know what is really going on with Nflx lately?
Bought another truckload at $288. McHaney with RBC is is bullish on NFLX. Research shows that 66+% will have more than one service. So Disney is not really a threat. Paying $50-75 a month is very reasonable. A family of four going to see one movie spends more than that.
come on netflix push through once more!
"ViacomCBS down 3 to 32 on a 3% drop in revenue. ViacomCBS peaked at 70 in 2013, the same year Netflix started producing its own content."
Here come the momentum crowd who buy stocks with upward earnings revisions. Analysts are hiking Netflix earnings estimates across the board.
"Mark Tepper has said stock will rise 30-40% from here. When an expert like that says so, that's all I need. I'm going all in on this stock. It's the only one I need for retirement."
Why this stock is going down? With strong subscriber growth? Yes Disney is coming with the streaming however it shouldn’t affect that much. Netflix is time to rise!!
"NFLX is still WAY too high, Per Jim Cramer. needs to come down to be a buy, closer to 200 dollars. Nobody in there right mind is touching it here with this market performing the way it is. I WOULD SELL HERE take some profits and buy it back at 200"
Strong BUY NFLX! Apple will buy this company soon!
Just wait. Maybe we’ll have an end of day rebound.
"Will nflx be closer to 320 this week or 340? That 10% increase last week has already taken a good hit. I think if we see 1 positive day and 4 negative days this week, the gains will be erased."
You know who's not buying; management!
announce a stock split that will fix it :)
"Growth intact...""Netflix (NFLX) is showing that it is far from exhausting its overseas growth opportunities as it sets up its first production hub in Europe. The company is setting up its first European production facility in Madrid, which is happening at a time when Netflix has a team working on nearly two dozen original productions across Spain this year with other original projects underway in other markets. Netflix spent $6.0 billion on content acquisitions, including original productions, last year."""
I was long . but this rises too much .gonna short it at 568
I bet we’ll be surprised how well it holds up today even with the big cut and debt worries this board will push.
Netflix removing Apple app means subscriber growth is strong baby.
"Netflix is going to price itself out of the market. I refuse to pay $15-20 a month for their ""service"". There are few hit shows that I need to watch. House of Cards used to do it, but they are over. I watch some sitcoms & shows here or there, but if they want to push the $15-20 a month barrier, I will cut the Netflix cord.Sling is $25 and presenting live TV: ESPN, news, etc. 40+ channels. It's a much better deal. I'm sorry, but this is a lousy move for Netflix. They need to enforce that your account can only be logged in on a handful (maybe 5?) devices. Too many people are STEALING by using logins from friends/relatives. Speaking of which, TIME TO CHANGE MY PASSWORD!!"
Just like they depressed the price this morning so that they could buy more at a lower entry point.
Sold $330 puts here into December against my position comfortable being long at $330
watch the stock movement at the close - If it closes in a downward fashion I predict high 370's easily post earnings.Another earnings miss just doesn't seem like its in the cards this time around.
Finally this morning hopefully we shed these barnacles that have weighed us down. There is a tone of desperation amongst some here today.
Never bet against NFLX!!! Exceptional company and visionary management!!!
i saw aol do this same thing up on sudscriptions and always missing earnings. it ended badly.
Just saw this : https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-will-keep-surging-jpmorgan-51554212692
"No password sharing, licensing revenue. Hastings will find a way to keep growing 25%."
Im trying to short more no share to short = no buying
Let's hope for a $20 jump immediately after earnings and close :)
THIS THE BEST TIME TO BUY 30 POINTS ON THE UP SIDE
Watch for the close. Today’s manipulation day. Next week the funds will start buying again due to the change of sectors for FANG stocks
"With Hulu in its 12th year of streaming and loses continuing to escalate a big concern for companies is can they ever make a profit in streaming competing against Netflix, so they hesitate, they wait, and they finally come out with a streaming service but it never shows up on the radar."
Time to short...?
NFLX is going to be the next CMG. Subscribers I know are cutting the cord. I did a year ago. After a year you've seen everything NFLX has to offer.
Bought $50k worth in Netflix @ 309.36. I guess it was worth it.
Tsunami is this
Nflx is no longer a one trick pony streaming service. It's also a movies producer aka pocket Hollywood.

Glad to see I was correct to add 100 shares at the open. Already up over $20/share. That was too easy. Like Buffett says. Hehe. :))
"Rich Greenfield, LightShed twitter""Disney+ average revenue per user falls to $4.62 from $5.63 (down 18% sequentially from March Qtr)So run-rate @disneyplus quarterly revenues are under $800 mm quarterlyWhen you essentially give the service away in India, it is very easy to grow subsSo @Netflix has 3.3x as many subs as @disneyplus, but nearly 8x as much revenue$DIS $NFLX NOT ALL SUBS ARE THE SAME"""
What’s your trading strategy for today? Do i buy now or kick myself later?
I am staying long
"Advice to the shorts! Never stand in front of a moving train. If everyone is jumping into a stock, regardless of your thesis don't go against the crowd. The market will crush you, even if your thesis proves correct later. Cover your shorts and live to trade another day!"
The...comeback...begins.
Can’t wait to buy some cheap puts today
I am raising target from 650 to 780 on this.
"When Netflix spends 100 million dollars for a movie, they are not really spending that much for the movie if you calculate how many countries it will be shown and how much each movie will attract additional customers to its service internationally. The per cost basis is divided to 190 countries they are in ends up being minuscule compare to say Disney or Amazon or Hulu spending the same amount as the market is only for Domestic consumption ( except for Amazon which is in 2 or 3 other countries )"
"3Q is going to be Epic! Train leaving now, get on board for $500"
Does anyone think this stock will do a 2 for 1 split soon?
Maybe NFLX should move even further left. It's a popular biz model today to alienate half your potential customer base.
"NFLX is still undervalued. Could go to $1000 this year, and $5000 next year."
Will will see next quarter with all the people opting out of the service due to the Rice hiring.
This will be green
This has been pretty firmly stuck in a range since July of last year. I thought it was gonna test $600 before ER but at this point it seems to be a coin flip. It could go past $550 again or it could go to $470-$480 and make you prove how much you believe in the stock before heading into ER in a month. The market is such a mind #$%$
Buy and hold. Moon bound.
"If media, analyst or regulator like FBI discover that millions of account paid mysteriously other than real user, what will happen to stock? Just wondering?"
They are losing millions of subscribers I just cancelled
"For those who are so confident that NFLX is just another bubble stock consider this. At one time, Apple, AMZN and Google hit 400 for the first time. True no stock deserves a 100+ PE based on earnings alone. The question to be answered is whether future international growth can result in a stock worth $20+ per share. That is entirely possible because content costs do not increase 1 for 1 with each new subscriber. Lots of subscribers sharing the same content will increase earnings per share.NFLX is in 130 countries and has only a tiny percentage of the population signed up so far."
the other faangs has some modest drop. This one fall hard. Why?
"Well, the 370 mark has been broken.For the 1st time in 8 tries, it closed over 370 when the open was over 370. Could not close over 380, but close. Best close since the day after earning, July 17, 379.48.... Next few weeks should be interesting. Does it go back to 400 or down to 350?"
any opinions on what strike we pin tomorrow?
"In Q2 they added 2.7 million subscribers, below the 5 million forecast. But here’s the thing people are missing. Most of the 152 million subscribers got a 15-20% price increase which leads to more revenue which leads to more content which leads to more subscribers. The forecast is for 7 million subscriber adds this quarter, a million more than analysts were expecting."
Like I've said in a prior post... the Street wants this over $400. Ride their coattails and make money with them. Never fight against The Street and momentum... it's a losing proposition
$494? now that is funny Netflix can get new subscribers
$NFLX UBS and Citigroup boost targethttps://www.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/4062-2/
Should I hold my puts through earnings or should I close out with decent profit?
Time for 600 then 700
what's happening here today
The stench from the Obamas and Rice having its predicted affect.
Today we saw the denial phase of the bubble.
This should hit $430 by Monday and $500 after Earnings
Good job NFLX. Worst market fall and you closed green. Hope markets recover tomorrow. 285 easy this week.
Long term investment. It's a household name.
438 more shares @ 414.50 Can't wait for Monday!!!!
"Is it me, or has NFLX given back that huge earnings call?"
Dow futures climbing after hours.
they tested a pice increase in Canada and it was a success.
Remember how low NFLX was at the end of 2018? it's back there and has become a roller coaster between earnings....not for the faint of heart. I wasn't i mpressed with their press conference.
"total liabilities $15 Billionwil be $17 billion within 6 monthsan article suggest the liabilities are actually $10B more, not sure why they said thatinterest rates going updo they have 'earnings"" or earningshow do you get to say they are making money, looks like they are losing money big time"
Something about this does not sit well. I love the Bollywood content but they are skimping on quality. Ive been long for 4 years and sold. Prove me wrong and ill buy my 8k shares back.
NFLX oversold.....Guess what.....It will rebound because sentiment is negative....Contrarian typical scenario
I’m picking up 5 shares long at the open Monday. Maybe 6.
"why is this not going back up with the markets, the way you would expect it to"
it'll get US$390 today
12%today
tomorrow... dizzy.....again
"Even though I sold at $338.23, I think this will run more, just not today. I expect a retrenchment to around $335 very soon and will buy back if/when it hits $332. This is a strong long term play. Concerns about negative cash flow are crazy. Worried about a couple billion negative CF when the market cap zooms $14B in one day and is up $63B so far this year! Hats off to anyone who put a lot into this at year end. Quite a ride."
Wrong SG. They raised prices because then on the ER call they don't have to get funding for more content. Their game is to have the best and most content to stay on top. Commercial Free. I'll pay 300% increase not to have to watch commercials.
I see 400.00 this week
220 after Friday. This stock is going down the toilet. Sold at 310 made me some money :).
"The stock sold off all day today on profit taking, setting up for a great run in the holiday season when it reports explosive subscriber growth. JMHO"
"strong up move toda, up 2"
"Chinese Netflix IQ just bought out skymoon, chinas largest free mobile game producer. come to the dark side"
"Market is oversold today: $VIX fear index is hype overbought, looking for entry today!"
These numbers prove they are executing their strategy effectively.
I will be Netflix and Chilling all week. :)
Don’t get scared buy more
Huge short squeeze
NFLX exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
GOING TO 600 GUYS MANY SHORTS DONT SELL CHEAP
keep feeding the bubble
breakout on huge volume.
"This company is in so much trouble. They badly need a new CEO. The current guy has no clue how to run a company when there is actual competition. Netflix has been making the service and shows worse while hiking the prices. It's like they've taken a page right out of big cable cos playbook. And how is that working for them? I figured Netflix would start losing US subscribers, but I didn't think it would happen immediately.And after a disastrous quarter, the CEO blames analysts for bad projections? So it is good to be losing US subscribers? Face it, the CEO is doing absolutely everything wrong. He wanted to be the new cable tv and a one-stop shop for everyone. People don't want that? Until the competition got going, everything was easy for Netflix. The CEO couldn't do anything wrong if he tried. Now it is clear, he has no clue and has to go immediately."
Predictions Anyone for closing price today and at open tomorrow? My guess 315 close today and 340 open tomorrow!
2% a day yeah... this is normal..
I bet those shorted amzn is shorting Netflix now . .
"Nice upward movement premarket, hopefully it’s a sign of things to come today."
NASDAQ is reporting this at $47
It’s going to dump today
"Goal, holding NFLX now till it's over $400.00."
resume the pump
Short covering is keeping it up. I wouldn't be covering until it falls 50 more. Already made a mistake covering TSLA at two days ago
370 let's go!!
Chances are Netflix added 12 million new subscribers last quarter which is 2.6 million more than they forecast.
340 today ?
Could use an up day for a change.
ABOUT TIME
"I guess I might not need to worry about my Dec 410 covered calls....But, that's still a long time from now."
"Waiting to buy, when to pull the trigger is the question"
Streaming services are losing a lot of money. Licensing to Netflix pays more than streaming. We have seen a shift from cable TV to streaming and now we will see a shift from content producers streaming their own content to content producers licensing their content to Netflix.
To all the Bashers; Crow is being served at 4:00 today for an early bird dinner.
BREAKING NEWS!! AMAZON OFFERING 50% OFF ALL KY KELLY PRODUCTS TO ALL NETFLICKS LONGS. JUST USE COUPON CODE: “NFLX BAGHOLDER”!!! SALES ENDS 4PM TODAY.

Wow already drop -5..
"should have stay on my market, manipulation big is obsiuly big par of US since regan quit, bouth dem and rep. best time to trade in history is in internet young age, nowdays is not small savers thing to be profitable.Manipulation big time in my country also but not gaint like in this stock."
"Now that Facebook has been tagged it, NFLX can start digging out of the dip. The analysts are still behind it and the World growth story is still intact. I'm thinking another new high before year end."
"upward pressure continues!!,"
"big investor would newer short this thing, now I know whay."
Why the sudden decline? Any news out making the stock tumble?
"Garolou's rules for investing in Netflix:rule#1 never sell Netflix sharesrule#2 never, never forget rule#1"
I bought more at 185. Hope the drop is done.
NFLX may hit $285 this Friday....Don't short NFLX before its momentum stops. It can move much higher...I have been seen this thing happened tons of times before:
"Ahhhhh yes the ominous ""green"" prior to ER release. Never a good sign. This will most certainly go south at 4:30."
Content is king.....NFLX is king of content......Shares will climb it is a matter of time.....NFLX should acquire rights on 007.......That will be amazing!!!!!!
Whip saw!
"If it closes above 355.20, it will be the first +16 day since June 13"
Many millions college kids in India have internet at homes but only small fraction of them has Nflx subscription. “Sacred Games” is a game changer for Indian TV!
Advanced technical analysis shows that this will go to 310
Down 27.26 for the month.11.11 for the week.Up 75.62 for the yearWorst month since October of last yearTariffs...You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
Futures are up
Close today. Break over 280 or below 276 today?
can't stay on the green. not enough buyers
Alright. Onward to 400!
"If we open above 295, look for the high to reach between 303 and 306.....Should not have much of a pull back from there.Good luck to everyone!"
Upgrades are very good. 350 in no time
Netflix has captured the melennials and once they start going to work so does their Netflix subscription. That’s 78 million folks!
"Ok, thats where NFLX was at 1 1/2 months ago... Good opportunity to buy."
"In a day when it opens at least +6 and the high reaches at least +14, NFLX has never ended the day at less than +5.75"
"Remember two words: this is an “American Giant”, can’t tell you what price it will go up, but I can assure you $400+ beginning Jan, 2019. Logical reason? The “Buyback” will kicking strong until then. Relax."
Ok - pre earnings this moon soon
Netflix profit now 1030% and counting. Starting to think this could be another Amazon.
NFLX will succeed and prevail..hold the line
Two things I know about the short game:1) you have to absolutely unequivocally believe in what you are doing and stick with it2) have the resources to weather the storm.I’m short this stock and I’m going nowhere
"strap in, here we go again!!!!!"
370 today guarantee
should i buy the dip or will this go much lower?
(NFLX) exploded and I missed out because I wasn’t listening to the great folks over at (http://Fairstox.com). The next big winner won’t miss me. Don’t let it miss you either. Join them now
"Earning train. All aboard.. longs, shorts and traders"
Still expecting the big drop soon. But will sure as hell enjoy this rollercoaster
This has been the most rewarding turnaround I've experience this year. Up $40 in a couple hours. Go go go NFLX and thank you!
We're just sitting and enjoying watching Netflix on a rainy day. Don't let YOUR life be spent watching stock charts on days like this.
Will Netflix have the same fate as Blockbuster video in future?
"hits keep on coming. Global hit Black Mirror season 5 coming in June:https://variety.com/2019/music/news/black-mirror-season-5-premiere-date-trailer-netflix-1203214490/then in July, there will be Stranger Things and Money Heist."
just remember they hit their earnings estimate people. the funds just look for a reason to lower the price temporarily so they can buy more
Lets go!https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/netflix-stock-has-a-history-of-big-rebounds.html
565 WATCH
4 reasons Netflix is destined to become the next mega cap company. 1. It keeps all the revenue by eliminating the cable middleman.2. It is hands down the best distributor there ever was in the media industry. 3. Because of economy of scale that exists in the media industry Netflix's big lead in streaming means it's much more profitable than other streaming services.4. Netflix reinvests those profits in more content to thwart competition.
we should see $16 upside tomorrow.
Thinking of adding 3500 shrs tomorrow.
Get in now! Will touch $525+ tomorrow!!!
Oh my gosh.. wish I had cash to dump into this!! Flash Bargain??
"Lovely discount - panic sell, back up tomorrow :) thanks guys"
"Are you saying Netflix can make big profits from Disney production? Apparently, it won’t be for long."
"See no point is selling Netflix to take my profits. I only need to hold 90 days to 4Q and we will be at or closing in on $450. Amazing company, utterly dominating steaming. I'm not saying their lead is insurmountable, but they are here to stay for quite some time. Enjoy the money friends."
My wife said once it gets to 400 you can have some of this LOL
"Great new hire by Netflix, in a key area of growth and opportunity.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3387731-netflix-names-disneys-fleischer-lead-consumer-products?dr=1#email_link"
Why is everyone so negative?! Was a great day! How much better could it be??
Earnings not just important for Netflix but for all of tech.. Not a holder but fingers crossed for a strong earnings beat.. Hope it goes well.
"nflx p/e is still 238 and forward p/e 77....there is still a lot of room to go down. be realistic about this folks, no buying on the dip please, this i way overvalued"
"Wow I just watched CNBC interview ( I was out this afternoon). Look Andrew must upset some big players.Wow they refuse to recognize fundamental of Investment:- ValueWhen Andrew said Netflix gone ahead of itself (Which mean overvalued) they all coming after that's not fundamental reason to make call. If Their growth slowing or something like that then it understandable.So Stock being overvalued is not issue and All those analyst and media pumping people into over inflated stock like nflx and $AMZN is god gift but When someone speak with sense, it's nonsense. What a great Wall street and how good they are adjusting to new Internet reality and still find way to control market (By Controling Sentiment)"
Holding long and hard in at 332 3 years ago selling half at 664 then riding the rest let’s go Netflix the best I the world
Hey shorties. The Netflix run has only just begun.
Just wait until Reed opens NetflixWorld
I'm accumulating now up to 1500 shares.
Always a week behind in my options.. 360 call expired last week... Why....
"Bid against amazon for amc, don't let them steal amc, it's worth forty a share, make them pay up for it netflix, build 100 drive ins in the midwest and show netflix originals and outsell the largest film producers, paramount sony, all those guys."
Gonna add 20k if it dips to 272.00
Many subscribers have dropped the service because they became to political in their programming. Annie 's first season was delightful but second season was unwatchable. Political correctness overwhelmed the script. I cancelled and will not return.Programming with Obama and Letterman tipped the scales. Many othe good options available.
Wait after lunch going green again start buying. You be happy closing around 366.00. It’s Friday baby
"I cover 400 ( 200 I sold yesterday at 366 ) Still have 800 short but I have 7 352.5 puts. Going to cover soon. If this go lower than that before I able to cover , then I am mostly out but My bet is stock not going to drop quickly because still lot of over excited crowd ready to buy when this go near 350."
Let’s go!!!
Short covering could take this over $290 again by tomorrow
Short at $400. Looking for low 300s or 200s this afternoon.
"I don't understand. If you want to buy a company, don't you want to purchase it at a cheaper price?"
"In the early morning, institutional investors started taking profit and selling slowly. They keep retail investors holding so they can sell high. The selling will accelerate near closing today and continue tomorrow early morning"
"some techinicals suggest a sell off50 dma 313100 dma 290 rsi over 70if it sells off, it might be 20 points or morethere is a gap at 325, maybe it will go there to fill the gapconsider the growing debt and PE of 283, would be nice to see it go to the 100 dma at $290. That's a 63 point drop from here. If the earnings isn't so hot, or subs, the price might drop below the 100 dma and that will become resistance for a while. Imagine all the stops below. There may be 10's of millions of shares that were purchased below a dollar or not purchased, maybe handed out to management."
Price target raised to 475
Apple investors are not liking this conference at all. Stock is falling accordingly
My 5Million Long position took a big hit tonight but i know this is a long play. They keep adding subs. do you know how hard is to add 10M subs? this will gradually go up long term. I see market cap of 1 trillion in 5 year.s
Buy Netflix
I told your guys that someone manipulate the price few days ago. no one trust me. now you see the result. hope you don't trap when you in in very high price. you might never get back....
I can't believe its only down 4% as we speak. Absolutely INCREDIBLE!!!
Why the big drop?
NFLX to split 3-1!!!!! Load up@!
"The share appreciation these last eighteen months or so has been unbelievable. Not complaining, but really wish I had purchased more than just the IRA yearly limit years ago."
"John Malone says scale is the most important factor in the media industry. In Feb 2016 the market had a big sell off, Netflix fell 40% to $80. It had 78 million subscribers. Netflix fell 45% to 231 after the recent bigger market sell off. Netflix had 146 million subscribers. Netflix subscribers increased 165% but the stock increased 289%. Scale is very, very powerful."
Nothing that anyone says here today matters until AAPL reports.
stop at lose at 600 $ . good luck to everyone. its just the game
"GUYS, 400+ on the way congratulations!!!"
Monday we should see 10% gains AT least wich means 350$ by EOD. Then if markets are good we should see 375$ by friday
It's not a bad idea to add more shares before another subscriber growth survey comes out ahead of the earnings report due in just 3 weeks. JMHO

"The streak comes to an end with a line drive up the middle that the pitcher catches..1st RED day this year, 1st RED day since Dec. 2486.08 since the run started.Opened in the red for the 1st time in 5 days.Was down 6.77 then got up 3.08When it got to 323.35, that is the highest it has been since it got to 332.05 on Nov. 8.From there it went into the tank.Two weeks ago today, the low was 231.23....."
For once the analyst was right. See you under $300
This is a screaming buy right now.
whats a better buy Apple or NFLX i am confused
looks like Netflix is going to buy GOOS its on the same path as NFLX
"Well technically today was NOT a good day for short term bears, myself included!! Two intradays in a roll of higher lows and today a higher high. RSIs improved slightly to mid higher lower 40s to mid 40s so the buyers are coming in. The 9 and 14 day stochastic got better but still in oversold territory! With 3 weeks left on my Nov 170 puts, I may have to pull the ripcord tomorrow as my time premium is slowly rotting away. I'm still a believer that the technicals indicate a downtrend with near term support at $252. The fundamentals for NFLX remain the same which are NOT GOOD ... burning thru cash, issuing more debt to pay for content and operational costs (aka, crazy salaries, $500M for Seinfeld! Seriously??!!), competition is coming from AAPL and DIS which are cash rich and can outlast NFLX, negative cash flow cannot continue at this pace, NFLX may win the awards BUT cash is the name of the game here in the long run, US subs supporting foreign subs, how much longer can that go on. Good luck to all the shorts out there but in the short run, as myself, I may have to eat the loss and roll into further out dated puts to make up for this loss!!"

Almost bought the $297.50 calls for $0.01. Missed opportunity. NFLX has been itching for a breakout. No stopping this now.
All the hype is on acm and nkla and gme
"Tomorrow, barring any poor market conditions, I think this tests 376. If it finds support there, next stop is 390, and probably in a hurry. If I am right or wrong, I still love how she moves"

"The best explanation of what the problem with NFLX is articulated in the article below. The price action is beginning to show that the market is finally realizing that NFLX is overvalued. One could argue that the action is simply in line with the market move, but if one reviews the price action closely, you can see the initial stages of facing reality has begun.The likelihood that NFLX will breach its high of ~286 is very small for a very long time. Instead, watch it bounce around a bit with a bias towards a steady decline that will bring it to the 186 area. Could go down much further than that.NFLX is a great company that, quoting the article, is ""incomprehensibly overvalued"".https://investorplace.com/2018/02/nflx-stock-uncertain-future/#.Wn8QJainHIU"

"WHY WOULD YOU SHORT NFLX ahead of earnings with massive subscribers? PLUS, FALL IS JUST around the corner, and COVID 19 expected to be even worse! $670 price target might look more like $750. "
Pedo stock. Profit takers tomorrow haha
Netflix has reached escape velocity. 1 billion subscribers is in the cards.
Lets hope NFLX goes beast mode tomorrow.
Gonna start seeing a runup to earnings
"Bought as much as i could today, so sweet !"
"i'm going to buy NFLX before ER tomorrow so it will crash. When I buy the stock price crash. When I short, stock price spike."
There is no other place to go for investing. So buy and hold on tight. It's only going to go up more!
Were too many people in weekly calls? Is that why this dumped the past two days?
afternoon turnaround anyone?
"Vs, that sounds complicated.why not go long and make big money like the rest of us?????"

The negative ripple effects from NFLX to my healthy tech positions Rob Arnott is predicting seems unfair to us real investors
"Get excited about NFLX, it isn't all that bad....290. Just let go higher, a better short position awaits you, just not now."
Now is the time to buy people!
Realistically this stock will see $375.00 before it sees $330.00. When this wakes up it’s going to crush shorties beyond recognition. A stock like this one doesn’t get a $70.00 haircut on the sole basis of missing subscriber growth.
"Netflix grabbed all the Golden Globe awards, no surprise there."
Nflx needs to see 230's to bring in new buyers
Guggenheim increases PT from 360 to 420 on subscriber growth in India.

"Appointing Rice and signing the Obamas was for one reason - international subscriber growth. In order to realize its heady targets, NFLX must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries. IMO, Hastings apparently feels Trump damages American prestige, and in turn, NFLX prospects. So he is using the dynamic duo (Obama/Rice) to assuage the world and ensure NFLX can succeed in these countries.The fact that NFLX would be willing to take the risk of angering 1/2 of the USA in order to build int'l bridges for NFLX tells me that Hastings and co. are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces NFLX. This is not a good sign.So, my thoughts have evolved on this. Sure, Hastings is a Lib, has a vehicle for spreading the message, and can use the dynamic duo to do so. But he did this for business, not political reasons. I believe his reasoning is not sound, and demonstrates the challenges the company faces."
I'm thinking they will beat estimates come Monday!I'm thinking we will see $415.00 by Monday close / Tuesday Open
pump today sell off at eod.?
just waiting for earnings
missed it again. already up by 3% in 1 hour
despite losing 30% NFLX still a big bubble...
10% ´wow
"Pretty funny watching pundits trying NOT to get into the phony subscriber growth number.I understand, though, nobody wants to be the guy who kills this market rally off a FAANG name. LOL"

"Hi, I'm new here, yall think this is good investment??"
Might as well print 280 by 335
"I really can't understand why this stock is falling. It has a large, expanding customer base. It is also consistently profitable and has surpassed the analyst's expectations on a quarterly basis. I am beginning to think I should just stay out of the market as there are forces going on here that I simply do not understand. My $100K investment here is now worth about $77K... Nice! I guess I can't roll with the big boys"
not selling nothing. Saving for my 11 year old

Congratulations to all those who bought this stock at $150 because you have doubled your money!!
will break 400 next week. easily.
And then 390 coming
"As I have been saying...lower highs, lower lows..."
Lets all hope china and trump stay quiet for the rest of april lol.
The $nflx shares are like a spring the more you push it down the more it will pop. I am 100% bullish about this security good for all investors who loaded this in discount.
am I the only one seeing YUGE shortfall in Q1 EPS forecast??? consensus was .84. they are now expecting .56 despite the massive price hike. YIKES
"So as inflation and more importantly interest rates go up, how does that impact Netflix earnings. Interest on debt is a huge % of their expenses, so rising interest rates would seriously hamper their profit growth expectations.Not a shorter, just sharing my thoughts...."
Cramer said it would be down more than 50 today
Rally eased back perfectly to the week average which is actually a very bullish signal as the week continues at an upward trend. means no more violent whipsaws and continue gaining about 5 points each day
The outcome will either make or break the NASDAQ over the next week or so with additional earnings from FAANG.

"Goldman Sachs note to clients:“Netflix’s incremental net subscriber additions have grown continuously despite significant competitive pressure,” Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said in a note to clients. “We continue to believe that the relative value (price divided by content consumed) of Netflix far exceeds any of the current or planned competitive offerings, making it unlikely that any of them will replace Netflix as consumers’ primary streaming choice.”They also posted this very informative charthttps://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106174642-1570719002226preview.jpg?v=1570719085&w=1910"

amazon is next!
"When it comes to Netflix and Disney, Disney has 5 times the revenue, 6 Tims the profit, but a lower market-cap. Think about that for a minute. If Netflix manages to continue beating estimates it will still take years to live up to it's ridiculous valuation. Even then there would have to be an absence of competition and a strong bull market just to keep this share price flat."
"Consensus estimates 5.75 billion revenue. Report $5.77 which beats estimate, but wasn't impressive. Forcast earning per share $1.64, reported $1.57 which isn't meet expectations. It means Nflx added 16 million subscribers at discount price"
Is this going higher? Good time to enter for long? Or is there a potential for correction to say 500-550?
"With competition so high, how come analysts still think the subscriber numbers gonna stay the same. The will go down for sure. There’s not point in this stock going high. Longs gonna get burnt soon"
"I set to sell short $420, but it is struggling to get up $420. It went up 2 days, I expect going down the third day, then will go back up again the 4th day. I anticipate a large drop after ER. If DIS has 50 million subscribers, at least 5 million came from NFLX"
This is one of biggest market caps in the world that barely makes EPS. This stock always amazes
Dear God Of Stock... please forgive me for not going long 9 years ago on Netflix.. I only ask 9 mo..
Have a good weekend you all. Our stock went up quite a bit. Cheers and untill monday!
"Glad I finally bought my 10 shares back I sold a year ago for a loss, everyone should own this and I don’t care what anyone says this is still looking amazing. Check out “the little hours” if you haven’t seen it yet. Funniest movie I have seen in a long time, the wife thought it was great. The best chick flick type movie I have ever seen. Gotta love Netflix and got to support this still amazing company that is saving Americans $$$"
"If you compare $NFLX and $AMZN against $GOOGL, $NVDA, $FB then you will realize how smart move this is.$GOOGL, $NVDA and $FB all about same growth rate. Only thing different is those generate lot of profit v/s $AMZN and $NFLX actually have negative cash flow. $FB and $GOOGL actually trading discounted Forward PE just 2 year out than S&P 500 overall.So why NFLX keep going all time high vs other not.two reason.1.> NFLX and AMZN ceo/management active pumping stock price. Other are not. Something that fan club love.2.> Big player know it's way inflated. They love it. They pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks. While reduce them from quality companies. They are very successful I think.So what might happen next.We don't know when this happen, it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further Margin /debt used by retail investors, What is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything & go actually short. But my prediction this will happen. AMZN and GOOGL right now have $425 difference. I think in year or so this likely <$200, Could be negative.Same with NFLX, it likely trade lower than $NVDA (Also might $FB) in year out. If you can handle temporary paper loss.I recomend go long on $GOOGL & $FB, $NVDAGo short on $AMZN and $NFLX. I think you will not regret strategy year out. You likely profit limited to 10%-15% but again risk is limited."
"One of the best stocks to buy right now, queens gambit show is gonna drive profits to way better than expected. Very bullish with price target at 680"
Is it too late to buy at current price netflix? thoughts?
"Ok with the fervor dying down a bit I’d like to re-ask my question from yesterday. Netflix has a massive debt load. Interest rates are going up. Has anyone looked into how this will impact their profits?Not trying to attack, just wondering.(And to head off the one response I got yesterday, I know they are saying they will not need to borrow new money. But they still have to deal with the debt they already have, and interest rates will not remain constant as debt is refinanced or as bond values go down.)"
Reality check.
Why up today?
This will double from here

NFLX still has a little loft left. Up she goes!
"Friday, NFLX had a down day. If (and I mean if) Monday is a positive surprise, then we may see a Gap Up. But this is would be a special & unique Gap Up,....... a Bullish Kicker, one of the strongest bullish signals. Stay tuned....."
"So they guided lower when they increase 13% of the monthly sub cost? It makes no sense! Except the growth is slow down! Also, study shows people are canceling their membership when Netflix increases prices."
"In video streaming, business subscribers will switch in a heartbeat, therefore, Content will be the king.Therefore, Netflix will rule in the long run."

593 to 526 . Awesome . Rather not even bother w/ Netflix stock. What a disappointment. Headed right back to sub 5.
Shorts leaving it seems.
"the Bullish Report on Netflix, Inc. https://chart-analysis.tools/NFLX"
Way overpriced stock. The fall will be hard on this stock.
Like I said we going to $400 in less than 2 weeks.
believe it or not: NFLX will close above $275 and $280 below.
Shorts panic and covering now...... Yay...
310 tomorrow ?
Will this realistically hit $430 by the end of week ?

dot com II bubble is about to go bonker big time. Tomorrow dow -800 and nasdaq -350
Well looks like my buy at 384 yesterday looks pretty good today.
sadly nflx has an unsustainable business model and will never be strongly profitable even though they provide a great service that tons of people subscribe to.
PE ratio of 95? Long way to fall before it becomes interesting.
600$ next week
Buying op. They need to develop a live TV service like YouTube TV of Sling TV to package with their streaming service. No brainer IMO. The growth potential is still there.
Should’ve bought another 312.50 put! Stock dropping a lot in the after hour
Roku guided lower...should help NFLX who already guided much higher.
I bought 1 $600 call option. The maximum option pain for 3/19 is $520. So it would be better to sell it or keep it? Any advice in this maximum option pain strategy would be really appreciated
"Disney , apple and amazon big competitors for Netflix this year"

so is $300 a week away or 2 weeks ? Thx.
Who bought $593 after fake earnings
"How many big (over $50B market cap) companies can tack on 10%, or over $8 billion in market cap in one week on essentially no news? This reminds me of AMZN a couple years ago. At this rate it could be AMZN size in a couple years! Crazy! Could surpass $100B market cap by end of next week!"
"NFLX will keep growing internationally. Huge growth opportunities with over 3,000 million potential viewers globally."
load up on calls early

5 more percent today :)
Believe it or not: NFLX may try to hit $300 mark next week!
Down almost $60
"Nflix is in trouble, all the broadband plan on offering free streaming on their platforms if the subscribe to their services. No way Netflix is worth this much with no growth, and debt going through the roof."
I think it’s a small pullback back to 300 this week or next sure . Wait for a new upgrade . Don’t sell now
This is all shorts now

GOING TO 550
the most overvalued thing of the century.Litteraly went up about 30B$ in 1 week without any news while the company makes less then 500M a year with a massively huge debt.
I think that I may have missed my chance to short NFLX. Does anyone think this will go below $295 by June
Does IBD amateur writers ever watch NFLX for possible breakout? Answer is : no;These IBD writers should get more experience in stock market; Jim Cramer is far superior than those IBD writers!

"I've changed my position on NFLX. I bought calls after realizing today that the stock is climbing higher into earnings. I intend to take my profits the day before they release their earnings. As I'm still unconvinced that their subscriptions have improved this quarter. The only problem is what Powell does next week. I'm not sure how the market will react to only a quarter point. After earnings I'll again accumulate puts just in time for the Apple, and Disney launches."
"A long time ago I learned to consider PE ratio as a large part of my investment decisions, plus looking at the market overall and the growth rate and prospects for continued growth. I cannot see a justification to put my hard-earned money in a stock like this, since there is no fundamental balance sheet supporting the price. Tell me where I am wrong in this reasoning."
$AAPL should just buy $NFLX and $TSLA and call it a day
Don’t short just buy getting ready to sky 
I just took out a second mortgage to BUY MORE!
This valuation assumes 1 billion subscribers.
"exactly why I stayed away, tesla is in the same boat"
I sat on the fence for 3 weeks about joining (http://Stocks-tracker.com) for their weekly picks. Big mistake. NFLX exploded and I completely missed out. Don’t make the same mistake I made. Join them today.
can't wait for more upgrades this week. Shorts are going to get called :/

Tomorrow morning will breach 400 easily.
It's time for NFLX Management to get rid of the OBAMAs and apologize to Conservatives. It shows in the subscription rate. Numbers don't Lie but Obama does.
Is Netflix starting up new hollywoods all over the world with it's foreign content production? Is there that much talent outside Hollywood? If so can they keep breaking subscriber records every Q. We'll know more on Monday.
"what would you suggest, I bought 225 shares at 325, after 20 shares at 307, after 55 at 297, so I have 300 shares at average price 318. But I bought it by borrowing from broker, so EQ right now around 25%, I am afraid of margin call, what would you suggest? To sell at highest possible price with minus, or to wait and hope"
Cracking down on password sharing is the absolute dumbest thing Netflix could do. It will result in fewer paying subscribers as half the subscribers are only paying for the service because their kids are using it. They could improve their cash flow by producing less garbage shows and fewer but higher quality shows.
"Get in now, this will be back at 400 in a few months I’m sure of it"
Options Friday will close at $282.50 or better. Nice week.$$$$$ I'll take it.
guess im gonna be holding netflix for a while....... the analysts seemed to know in advance the subscriber number would drop the stock insider information is so unfair
Netflix and chill slogan really pushed this stock to mars. I'm loving it :)

I added more Netflix.
slight of hands going on here. NFLX did fine. wall street wants you to think otherwise so the big boys can grab more then they will push it to 1000. mark my word...
"Overheated and Time to look elsewhere for now, p/e over 120 regardless of the momentum. Don’t even want to scalp this long anymore at these price tags. Better trades out there with much more value.Good luck to longs at this point, risk/reward ratio is no longer in their favor.VA"
HUGE buys at the close.
"Entire Netflix Investors are living in different world and ignoring all detail about Disney Streaming.They are preparing lot of new content along with lots and lots of quality old content just for Streaming. This is not launch of Hulu or Amazon Prime Video where limited or low quality or old content only available.I think NFLX likely end around 250-275 at year end (Even assuming there is no market crash) If crashed, then 160-170 is easy as well."

Short squeeze will come from margin calls tomorrow morning .
"Has nice bear cover into this stock.Just wondering how long to hold it. 280 seems to happen easily, but I see also 266 lurking. Around that price we may see a slight comeback. But basically 2020 will be mostly bad news for Netflix due rising competition."
Discovery just announced a new streaming service.....and many more companies doing the same. Do you think it’s been their plan to do this all along as part of a broad company strategy? These companies are forced to adjust their business model because of the Netflix effect. What we are witnessing is the demise of an old industry and the rise of the new. The companies who adjusted Years ago has a better chance of survival than the companies who. pivot just now.
Thats gona be green in the end of the day lol

"The next billion dollars growth for Netflix is ads. They own the content so, they will get the most of the cut. They're hiring people to work on real time bidding for their ad system.https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/870624"
"Huge amounts of money lost today to big buyers. Billions on all types on companies. Create panic for longs to sell and short to step in. Then buy back so short get scared and buy back with a loss. To green again, people buying. Now shorting again. Hahaha. And many people keep going for it. If you have a stock of a good company. Stick to it for a year at least."
Only company in the world that beats earnings estimates by 30% and loses 13% valuation in 2 days. Something massively wrong with that.
"Why, even in good price movement days, does NFLX volume remain 50-60% of average from just a few months ago? Looks like the investers are leaving this stock, signal of a top?"

Netflix is down 5.36% to 518.45
Late afternoon is when we see a rally in the stock as people will want to have NFLX in their portfolio prior to start of a breakout week (especially big boys and hedge funds). A little Profit taking so far today is very understandable.
Don’t worry this will keep going up up up. Trust me!
"Netflix is still up around 20000% in last 15 years. I never did understand how this company goes up everyday trading at 140 times earnings and losing billions every year. I know it is all about subscriber growth, but still never deserved to be up 20000%."
bankers take profit today in Nflx and use $ to pump up Amzn
"I am seeing some really great relative strength. Netflix looks like it wants to take off, a coiled spring ready to fly."
Netflix is the big dogs in streaming. Everyone else is late to the game. They going have to spend a lot more money then Netflix to catch up. Netflix already has the 5 years ahead and advantage of streaming. Netflix for life
"The long-standing assumption for Netflix's optimistic growth trajectory was the potential pricing power and hyper growth of subscriptions. However, recent market trends show that its core pricing power may be limited asnew subscriptions slow.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4186627-netflixs-perceived-pricing-power-may-soon-hit-reality"
Looking at 600 tomorrow
Your personal information with Susan Rice on board will be compromised!
US subscriber growth will go negative next year. So many streaming providers. You just need one. And do you know anyone who doesn't have one of them? Everybody has NetFlix or Hulu or something. Now DIS and AAPL will take them away plus Comcast is now providing a free streamer. AT&T and Spectrum will be next. Streaming will soon be just like an email provider. No money to make.
"For all the gullible ones who bought this thinking higher viewerships = higher revenuesNetflix doesn't have it's own servers it's using AWS cloud (Amazon Web Servers) which charges for the network usage $0.15/GB on monthly basis.This means that while the membership price is fixed, Netflix's COSTS ARE HIGHER when everyone are not working and watching all day long. There real winner from all this stay-at-home situation is AMZN which is overpriced and heavily pumped as well but that's a different story. Beware."
back to 400 by the end of this week
A trading buddy asked me the other day about NFLX and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
Streaming BUY
I have a great feeling about today!!!!!
Guy on CNBC trying to twist chart reading according to his short positions? Anybody noticed?
SHORTED 5000 SHARES I THINK IT WILL GO DOWN WHEN REPORT EARNING TODAY.. I HOPE I M RIGHT..ANYONE ELSE SHORTING.
The fact that they raise prices two days before earnings it means that they are coming up short with the earnings
Oh man this is getting juicer by the minute. Big buying are coming in fast.
I think earnings will be good
Solid management and execution
Best close since 373.25 on July 12 of last year
They predicted beating last quarter up 143% from last year
Netflix is the Tesla of movies streaming
"Funny, We subscribe to Netflix but we hardly ever watch it anymore. Wonder if there are others like us out there??"
"Longs need to defend $560. Once that level is breached, it will drop straight to $525 or $535."
Happy for Netflix investors! Congratulations!
Time to more buy
It will be 400 very soon .
Looks like the mm wants to keep it around $350.
what the h. is going in Netflix... why does it keep going down and down.... ?
$17 Billion more in market cap in a week. Wow
Looks like market has bottomed at least in the short term. Earnings will be the focus going forward.
bought 40 shares at 333.26. I set a limit sell for first thing in the morning at 360
May be time for that epic thing.
The old Netflix stock that I know usually ends the day like this up 8%. This one is just about half way..
"WE HAD A STRONG CLOSE, WE GOING TO RUN. CUP FORMATION CONFIRMED on the 4-hour chart. LETS GOOO.FLY NFLX FLY"
Great opportunity to buy more ! Great earnings!
Netflix is done on to the next stock
"Toss a coin to the Witcher, he will make you richer......."
just give up shorties. your lucky you pushed it down to mid 260s after their best earnings in history and overblown competition. pe is not a good measuring stick for a growth company. Netflix is still just that until proven otherwise
"Been in NFLX stock for the long haul, excellent content coupled with mg'mt being mostly ahead of its various peers. I bought some AMC with some recent proceeds with talk that Netflix could have some interest in this beaten down theatre/entertainment Co. What better way to get your original films on BIG screen across the USA and promote all your other content."
this is gonna drop imo
Netflix just ordered 10 more seasons of the Crown  after the interview
huge earnings in 7 days! 550+ coming
time to short?
RBC Capital Mark Mahaney reiterated an Outperform rating and $500 price target on Netflixhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-international-growth-mexico-51591713030
"Netflix is coming out with a new movie ""House of Cards"""
If Netflix adds an avg of 5m new subscribers the next 20 quarters (low estimate)....thats another 100m subscribers....no brainer. Z
440 close ? LOL
So let me see? he shorts then bashes on CNBC or tweeter. Isn't that what they do when they tell you to buy stocks that they already own on CNBC/ I see it as activity that should be illegal in all cases - if you mention a stock sell or buy on public network like CNBC - you can't close that position for 30 days/ Perod
All time high close
If you want to short—-dont short the stock. Short by buying puts or selling calls. It avoids short short squeezes. Do yourself and othrs a favor.
OMG! Take advantage of these free trade ideas. Just go to (http://buystox.net)
you guys are going to think I'm crazy... but I think indexes are going to test 200 sma lines again. That's gonig to bring nasdaq to $8612 and dow to $25506 and sp500 to $2964... We're in a tech bubble and it's going to crash the markets.. $msft $amzn $goog $fb $twtr $zm $nflx
"I can still remember when AMZN dropped like this after earnings and I honestly thought that was a buying opportunity. But I was too scared to jump in. Look at where Amazon is now... Honestly, you just need to know who’s going to be the winners of the future. For me, NFLX is the future and being the pioneer of the streaming world, it will only get bigger and stronger over time."
Anything is cooking internally.. why this is going without any reason?? I am worried now..
"In my opinion this sell off in FAANG and other big tech has overshoot to the downside. The 10-Yr Bond is still very low despite the fact it came up a lot % wise. It's up from 0.5, which is very very low.$AAPL, $MSFT, $GOOG, $NFLX, $AMZN."
"As predicted, it was weak this morning. I hope you took advantage of the dip below 209 to pick up some more. I predicted a slight green finish today. Let's see if we can get there."

"I bought at $19.74, sold some at $400 and $350. I’m still obviously up, but I am thinking of selling some now so I don’t lose any more. Or just wait and see if it goes up again. Don’t know what to do!"
Patience pays!
NFLX starting to counter disney. It is going to take a lot more but need to start somewhere.https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/22/netflix-unveils-new-shows-aimed-at-preschoolers/?yptr=yahoo
It will be down 75 in the morning
One day soon you will wake up and see the price 100 points lower. Then you will ask What Papen? What Papen?. Then on another day soon after you will wake and see this down another 75 points. Then you will ask your mom What Papen What Papen?
"Two price target increases already, buyback coming, NFLX to $1000!"
"""Scale increases 10:1 with the internet"". John Malone, media tycoon,PhD, in a Nov. 16, 2017 interview. He also said Netflix is on track for enormous profits and it's a way too late for old media to figure out a Netflix like service. July last year Disney said they will launch a streaming service in 2019. Why not in 2017? Then again, they launched one way back in 2007 with partners Fox and Comcast and called it Hulu and it's stuck in the mud."
How is the one-year target still $400?
"NFLX is the only FANG stock you can buy at big discount at this price level.You will see $400 soon.Similarly it happened in July,2010 after missing est and then back to uptrend in one week or so!"
This things is obviously going to test the post earnings 344 low.
toward $360 close!
What a golden opportunity to buy it at a discount!
Nothing but a casino. That's all the stock market is. Yesterdays gains...whoosh.
"This is a 1999 kind of Move up, on NOTHING. name one reason, 100% Machine driven"
Addicted behavior of making money buying NFLX
362/share by the end of today
"Uh, stock did not blow up like a stock ALWAYS does if it’s as bad as our sleazy board bashers claim. It traded down but, did not collapse further from the open.Netflix lives. Prepare for Son of Netflix, Haters—-"
"this ""crash"" was a blessing, I'm making a fortune today :D"
netflix will always come back. regardless of what happens in er.
Why this slow bleeding again?
This has been trading sideways for 6 months. It’s about time it breaks out 600+
"... How many times recently have you seen it down in pre, only for it to completely turn around later that day... easy for someone to manipulate the pre with a bunch of selling... the seller or sellers made 11 yesterday... use a little of that to cause a little panic."
"Don't miss the power hour! and last 30 minutes, this will close at $550Open $650 tomorrow!"
Lots of immature folks on here. You can make money either way on this one depending on how good you trade. I'm out. Good luck to everyone.
"Cramer says FANG still have room to run...That the signal to his Wall Street buddies? Suddenly, positive news appears."
"Well, the market just lost trillions for what, a $20-30 billion trade squabble. Back up on Monday to $325. Seen this happen before."
"Anyone notice a quarterly trend here? Right before earnings and # of subscribers release, the stock dips to sub 500. Right after the market closes and the company reports, the stock shoots right up. It appears it happen the last 3 quarters."
Market up again tomorrow. Now it is the decision time. Sell into the rally and reap gains or hold a little more. But what if markets tank again. I hate this decision time. I guarantee if I sell it will keep going up and if I hold the market will tank. Happens everytime lol
love Netflix but this growth is not sustainable. pullback soon before new highs
"Citron shorted NVDA last year and $140 and went short again this year at $230. They try and time 3% pullbacks to make a quick buck. Andrew left tweets that he's short, CNBC puts him on tv for minutes, and the stock drops 3%. Rinse, repeat. Thanks for playing."

"Yo ""Anonymous""...doesn't your nursing home have activities for you residents? You know...like Bingo, card games and Shuffle Board?"
"Damn, why I bought on 340$ :/ hope for a long term it will rise again"
"Hey all, I’m not long or short here and just started looking into the company and am a little confused by the business model. I get that they are spending boatloads to create content which is amounting to significant cash burn resulting in negative CFO. Seems as though management is confident this is necessary to keep subscribers growing and will lay the groundwork for a strong stream of income into the future. That sounds great if it works out but this almost seems to good to be true. Questions that come to mind are: how long will it take to be cash flow positive, especially with the burn rate increasing rather than decreasing? What if popular shows fall out of favor in the distant future, get pirated, or too many new shows flop? What about competition? This just seems to me like a very aggressive strategy and that no matter how many subscribers they can get, the ultimate sustainability of the business will depend on being able to generate cash flow which can only mean higher prices which will attract more competition at some point. This reminds me a little bit of the flaws of Pandora’s model in a way where they had to spend more and more on royalties to keep up with subscriber growth. I guess there’s something I’m missing here because market clearly doesn’t agree with me but it’s not like crazier things haven’t happened before or will again..."
He comes the selling. EPS is an issue.
340 calls up 500%
$346 tomorrow good news is coming
selling at 662
"Remember GS morning jumped and when people realized where the number came from they weren't so spectacular, this is going to happen alot this quarter."
400 does not want to hold ??
"Wall Street can get all excited about a substantial price increase, but as a user I'm not paying anymore than I'm currently paying for the service. This means I will stop using Netflix, and sign up with Amazon or others. There's a lot of competition. I'm not the only one quitting Netflix, I spoke with about 25 people in our company who agree with me. I don't own Netflix as a stock."
So Apple can’t make a charger in two years but yet they are going to complete with NFLX from basically no content to being a powerhouse. This from a company that its biggest spend to date was buying Beats. I understand all the subscribers and all the money. I just don’t see them doing anything great in streaming.
Based on their current trajectory...they hit 200 subs in about 26 months. Z
Add AMC $6.04. $AMZN and $NFLX salivating at these levels for the On-person Entertainment.
Final melt up before the big correction!
"So many trolls angry at Netflix bc of the Obama’s producing a few shows. Hey snowflakes, ever heard of the concept of not watching those shows? I’m sure there are conservative talk show hosts on SiriusXM radio. You don’t see me cancelling my subscription. I just....repeat after me....don’t listen to those channels."
NFLX greatest asset is its shareholder community. Stay strong!
Oh boy
"Raising prices now? Not committed to growth anymore? Investors are looking at this the wrong way lmao. In my view, this actually hints at sub growth not meeting expectations come earnings. Why else would you stunt your growth right now just as more competitors are ramping up their offerings?"
"Smart money is headed for long positions at NOK, earnings tomorrow morning then liftoff long term. They are manipulating stock price but, longs will prevail. Cheers."
So quiet this morning. I bet the shorts are busy covering :-)
here come the climb XD
Wait until lunch more big buying. Banks are loading up heavy
I’m Crying so much I wish I had a lot of money to buy more why why why. Looking good 425.00 by end week
Will finish in Green today. New highs by Friday.
So Netflix told the story of the market downturn before it even happened. Check out early January..it baselines and start to fall...and if NETFLIX is baselining and falling no matter how small to start...that is the canary in the coal mine for sure.
"Here we go with the mail in balloting again in Georgia. Stop the steal and save the country, vote republican to hold the line in the senate and save the middle class in this country and save the country period."
"plz, go above 380"
story just came out about netflix and viacom and nickalodian
Told the shorts earlier this week to cover after the $327 close. Tech analysis is a beautiful thing. Read a book shorties.
83pc held by institutional. No wonder this going up. Could be huge short squeeze to 700
Looking like a nice gap up at open. $415 by Friday
So T mobile one data plan offer free Netflix now. Guess how many new subscribers will be there. And btw. The hunting of hill house is really good. There are so many good original shows . They will dominate the market. So for long investor I am still in
A toast to the Colonel and Paul Williams.
NFLX is up over $ 9.00 per share in pre-market on an analyst upgrade!!!
great today but I hate to see what happens tomorrow
Holy had to triple check
Did we make it thru the profit takers yet?
"What’s stated on this board has no influence, just fun, to let off steam, release the pressure valve. It’can be informative at times and give you the psychological pulse of the retail investor, but like I read 60% of NFLX shares are held by institutions."
Netflix sell-off will never happen because 80% of the 435 million shares of netflix or 348 million shares worth $145 Billion are owned by institutions. These institutions are not affected by individual emotions to trigger sell-off but governed by groups of fund advisors who decide to hold or sell the funds.
"Steven Spielberg is trying to keep NFLX out of The Oscars. When one of the most influential Hollywood directors of all time is scared of you, you know you're doing something right. Netflix has disrupted the entire film industry, and has a massive head start over all other streaming platforms. All shorts ever talk about is their P/E and their debt. They're not seeing the bigger picture here."
all eyes on it! I’m positioned for a breakout but have already reduced some! $PDD $NFLX $WIMI
most businesses start off in debt and NFLX is young..by 2020 it will be profitable..scare story doesn't cut it.
"There are a few real bad pumpers on thhis site that people need to be aware of. They will tell you that NFLX has no competition and will rule the streaming world. APPLE has recently announced deals with some powerful hollywood types like Oprah Winfrey, Octavia Spencer, Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Steven Spielberg, Francis Lawrence, Damien Chazelle, M. Night Shyamalan and Kristen Wiig. They will be a major competitor. So will AMZN and DIS. Beware of the paid pumpers on here."
Wow. What a move.

"The mistake people make is they look at Netflix numbers in a vacuum, without comparing to competitors numbers. When you do a little digging you find that Netflix is blowing away the competition."
"Question about the impact of production shutdowns on Netflix's release schedule.Sarandos: ""We work really far out relative to the industry.

Shorted 150 at 571
Short Netflix to 300 today!!
It’s going to keep running the rest of this week. Another 5-7% more based on last 6 earnings where up more than 5%. Expect EOW $352-$360
"Raymond James forecast 31 million subscriber adds for 2019. That looks too low, should come in around 36 million IMO. Hulu CEO says they can catch Netflix with their promotion induced 8 million/yr subscriber adds? I like Hastings, he stays away from the limelight focused on changing the TV industry."
get ready folks all at capital have masks on to the moon more stay at home soon. think congress will pay for our movie s
Minimum wage at $15.00 will make this stock triple.Inflation!!!!
Netflix rocks
"Netflix is into producing and distributing hindi movies , worlds second largest after hollywood."
Going past 500.00 pretty soon thank me now or cry later trust me I know and I really do its facts not some BS starting tomorrow & engaging as of next week gonna power burst it unto that level & hover and hold then up some more could care less if you believe me I hold mine and I have plenty
Goldman has confirmed $400 NETFLIX is on its own way!
$265-$270 is definitely possible but I may be selling and going the other-way at the 20-day moving average. Still in a downtrend unless it breaks through that level on volume.
"IT'VE GONE UP TO $280, IT IS GOING TO BE BACK TO 300 BEFORE OR AFTER HOLIDAY, ALWAYS STAY HIGHER PRICE IN NEW YEAR !!! LOADING UP MORE AND MORE AS YOU WILL NEVER GONNA SEE THIS PRICE AGAIN !!!"

Netflix rises after Bank of America says it's 'seeing significant reacceleration' in mobile app downloads https://www.cmlviz.com/article/NFLX/cnbc-2019-9-9-netflix-rises-after-bank-of-america-says-its-seeing-significant-reacceleration-in-mobile-app-downloads.html
Options trading priced in 10% volatility. Call buyers need NFLX to move 10% up to begin making money. Right now only 6% gain so both call and put buyers lose money if they bet on the earnings using options.
This is pure unadulterated pricing power. If they really needed money they would slow down spending.
"once it breaks $340, $280 is the next stop and a good price for loading up."
I believe the stock will pop up nice after the report to (let some people out) and then sell off. It looks like it is set up for that.
Target raises:Goldman Sachs target raised to $540 (from $490) maintains outperformRBC target raised to $500 (from $420) maintains outperformBUY BUY BUY
Gap up and drift sideways. I would say that is what happens 99% of all days.
This market is making the Dot.com boom look sane...
bought few thousand shares at 18$ been happy since then everything is paid off kids are in best universities! i knew it woud kill blockbuster
"Think about this- a year ago, this thing was $160."
NFLX always recovers and goes to new highs. Billions of Indians and Chinese still need to sign up for their service! Their growth story is just getting started. I bought at $420 but I’m not worried - am in for the long term.
Desperation in the NFLX bashers’ posts—-
another hour till green?
"Based on option 300 strike 12/13 expiration Calls open interest (6739) and big volume (10307) against Puts open interest (1928) and small volume (1686), tomorrow the stock should be hovering between 300 and 303."
"All after hour articles are praising Netflix quarterly report. Guess what, upgrades tomorrow."
It will never get back to 333.00......says the nut who never bought.
I smell 400 before earnings...
It is hard to believe that someone is still buying WORTHLESS $NFLX Netflix shares in this MEGA BUBBLE!
Thumbs up if you think every network will go direct to customer streaming. Thumbs down if you think all other stream networks will fail and Nflx will be the solo player with unlimited pricing
Do you like to watch the lion king 50 times in a row and star wars cartoons with a banal plot and poor graphics paying $ 7 for this or the original diverse content of Netflix? Disney is growing due to crazy investor support and when the week passes we will look at the situation objectively
"If NFLX goes below $300.00Opportunity to Buy, Buy, Buy"
some analysts will put out some article to raise stock so mutual funds can dump
"There are ample movie Apps in addition to Netflix that are great. Amazon, YouTube Movies, Hulu, Pluto & more. Smart TVs are full of movie app options. They also offer global internet movies and are growing. The online movie. streaming is growing regardless of carona virus as more families have been improving their home theaters with larger TVs. The large movie theaters growth has declined due to ticket cost increases, parking & security even before carona virus arrived. It is a trend."
We pick off where we left off starting on Monday. Expecting huge gains this week. Good time to be a Long.
Shorts hahahahahaha
Short squeeze........ Happy
Hope NFLX working on the next big thing because it's original content in the US only appeals to a hairline sliver of the East and West coasts. Got to be a better way to spend 8 billion a year and they need to find it quick.
"Samsung, Netflix mobile deal https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-netflix-mobile-deal-will-unlock-bonus-content-on-galaxy-phones/"
Always the EPS misses.
If they get 200 million subscribers. And they will get it. They will generate 20 billion a year. 15 billions for tv shows a year. That is a 1000 episodes of the most expensive episode of Game of Thrones a year. Almost 3 a day......
Maybe this Netflix should have been a buy. I don't know what I'm doing with stocks anymore.
Whe. The market gets better this will go up next week up
NFLX will not miss. Expect a big numbers. Sorry shorties.
"My two centsnet neutrality will matter eventually and matter in a big way, because as someone said on Bloomberg, 1/2 of the bandwidth on the internet is Netflix. That may or may not be true, if it is even half true, its a big deal, prices go up to NFLX, margins get squeezedand even before this change NFLX was 3 times too high at least, I'm seeing 130 for nowhowever, manipulation might take it higher due to the tax thing, though they don't make money, so it shouldn't, but it mightbe careful shorting, use pieces and stops and eventually you will make a killing, I thinktrade the chart, though, instead of gambling, because of the potential for manipulation. Ive seen that a lot of times. The effect isn't here yet, they are still messing with it. They can use it to kill shorts, the hedge funds I mean.But eventually, and obviously, the cost comes to NFLX that is already heavily debt burdened. And the fox disney thing is a big negative as well as disney doing streaming along with google with youtube and others, competition in that market doesn't sit stillnow go look at the PE. I trades so thin that big money needs to get out, while they can, so it could crash. There is a recession coming as well."
"Netflix’s forward (2022) PE of 38 is lower than that of Disney and Disney’s media networks, its biggest sector, is in a death spiral."
"Dropping fast, oh wait no it isn’t, lol Sorry Shorts"
"I don't know...NFLX jumped 11% the next day after earnings for the quarter before this one where it jumped almost 6%. It's a great company but, it can't keep pulling miracles out of its #$%$, I think I might sell 100 of my 200 shares which I have owned for almost 3 years and be very content with that even if it somehow keeps appreciating."
"got in at $150 last May, BAM!!!!!!!"
Just got more shares!
100 dollars for NFLX is too much ?
On the shopping list today.
"I begged you longs to sell last week, saying this was headed to $320. I hope a few listened. My short is doing great. Still more pain to come. If you have a massive gain still on your long and are comfortable holding long term and able to ride this down another $20 or so, then hold on, otherwise get out."
"Thanks to those who bought OTM options, I will take good care of the money you have transferred to me."

NFLX has a smaller market cap than TSLA. Does that seem right?
"Hahaha, i just want to laugh on the people waiting at 200."
THere it is 300
where's this 300 shorts? I'm pretty sure tour not even coming close to it
If nothing else they will have to run out of buyers eventually LOL
First GREEN Monday since Oct. 1... so at least we have that going on for us...

No sense in watching it continue to bleed. I’ll give it one more day to stabilize. Portfolio poison right now.

Streaming with the use of AI is a more productive way of distributing video. Netflix is the runaway leader. When it is finished claiming its market share in global TV Netflix will be one of the most profitable companies of all time.
The world is suffering from NFLX addiction STRONG BUY
Netflix is a real deal after Theater purchase ideas and Comcast partnering. This is going $400 PPS; This will burn shorts badly.
"NFLX is now down 30% from its high, but it's sister company Tesla is still at all-time highs. Weird. The companies are very similar....both competing in very old industries (Hollywood, Autos) while pretending to be ""tech companies,"" both endlessly cash burning, both huge issuers of junk bonds, both trading at absurd dot.com valuations, etc. So why is Tesla still near all-time highs while Netflix has crashed? Consumer Reports says Tesla is the LEAST reliable auto brand. Meanwhile people LOVE Netflix. So as both Auto Stocks AND Tech stocks have corrected, why hasn't Tesla?"
Just cancelled my NFLX subscription. This is heading to $20 soon!
Two reason: Disney is coming into the streaming field; NFLX US subscription growth is slowing down
"Market down?............ Scroo it, I'll watch Netflix!"
"Why is this going down? after reporting, will this be at 330 or 280?"
GBH raises Netflix price target to $500https://www.marketwatch.com/Story/gbh-raises-netflix-price-target-to-500-2018-06-19?&siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
This stock will surpass it’s $460 target  price by years end.
NFLX isnt just a good stock its a great stock.Anything under 10%($360) is a strong buy.
"“Over the next 5 years subscription growth will accelerate once 5G becomes available. Anyone within range of a cell tower signal will have access to affordable broadband Internet, which is what's needed for NFLX. That will make NFLX the most ""affordable luxury"" in virtually every corner of the planet, especially in areas where local TV choices have been traditionally very limited. The result will be an explosion in non-US subscriptions, which we're already starting to see evidence for in the most recent couple of quarters.This growth will, in turn, further accelerate the decline in traditional TV viability as ""cord cutting"" becomes pervasive. Expect continued upside ""surprises"" as this industry transformation continues. All good news for NFLX shareholders.”"
"Funny how everybody here creates support levels. Seems like every time it goes lower, someone comes up with some kind of support level it has to hold."
RBC says NFLX will double and the stock takes a tumble. OMG hahahaha
"Huge buying volume, huge call option volume. Shorts beware. As Jimmy Z says, you have been warned!"
Wow i should of bought this last night. Scared money = no money
"We are adding to our position,buying more GPK too."
"This is a easy call.I am going short on this. It has to go down below 300.Everything is already factored in and hence there is going to be massive profit taking and shorting.1st quarter subscription is slow for NFLX.Take my advice, sell before it's too late."
This baby has me green today overall with my AAPL and FB getting hit. Nice.
Nothing more than a casino. That's all the market is. $50 swings in this stock over the course of weeks and none of it having to do with the company itself.

Don’t panic longs. We will get an upgrade tomorrow or news from Netflix which will push it another $20 up. $410 Friday 
"up til 10am EST, then the sell off. yesterday's more than 6% drop with a volume of 22M shares was no joke."
What you guys think will be the price after today’s earnings?
I am holding on for $395. Willing to wait until year end if I have to. All we need is for the old NFLX to regain form.
Still think I'm crazy when I said this is heading to 310?
$375 after closing!! #NFLX
Netflix now has a market cap larger than the total wealth of 111 of the world's 166 countries. Makes perfect sense....
the sleeping beast shall awaken once again....
WHY IS THE ENTIRE MARKET DROPPING
"A historic day! The high of 26.60 was the highest on a non-earnings day and the 4th highest ever. The close of 26.37 was the 2nd highest ever on a non-earnings day. April 17 of last year it was closed 28.28 in the green.Good way to end the Friday slump.7 day unbeaten streak. +63.69 during it. On Dec. 26, it reached a low of 231.23 and has bee running since then.Highest point since 298.72 on Dec. 3, Best close since 303.47 on Nov. 9The 10.68 open was the 10th best ever and highest since Oct. 31Dec. 26 it closed +19.79. Next day it, closed up 1.90, but it got down 13.57 before it started the comeback.Good luck to everyone next week!"
This is a definitely 250 $ stock in a few weeks. It was 230 last month and things have gone even worse for DebtFlix. Not sure why bagholders are buying this at these insane levels.
Let's go back to 423
"Amazing that the funds are still buying this stock despite the massive run up over the past 5 years. One thing is for sure though, NFLX pioneered the OTT concept and has a strong lead over it's rivals, but cash burn needs to go down at some point. Else people who bought in at today's prices will need to keep waiting forever to get back their investment. JMTC"
384.23 by 2pm
a new daily high is definitely coming now after that last 5min bar's rebound... it no go downy.
$1000 target in 3 months//
$345 by tomorrow
William Blair loves NFLX
i feel bullish here....it may reach 550 soon
I ignored netflix when it was 50 dollars but now reckon this could do 100pc in the next few months. Few percent each day grinding up slowly same way tesla did. There is no reason to stocks like this anymore.
"If Apple launch Video Streaming service on Friday. Game over all This stock. I have strong feeling that Apple will announce something like that in order to keep stock bleeding low. Specially if those IPhoneX report are real problem.If that happen this will go back to 200 easily. Be careful. Bigger Netflix price, more gain Apple get from announcement. After all, Apple already have better technology, Data (Most use Netflix on iPHone and can take over Netflix in no time."
$76 tomorrow morning.This stock is rigged.

"at least before Tuesday close, it is safe, another 5%"
"Just my opinion, but this decline is way overdone. Yes the PE ration is high; no doubt! But it isn't much higher than Amazon. They did predict that they wouldn't do so well in the immediate future; but as I said, it's a prediction, which at this time amounts to no more than speculation. As such, it doesn't merit a 20% decline in a little over 2 weeks."
Wow...

Don't chase this. It's over until it drops. Better pricing in 5 days.
Remember Tesla everyone bashed and it hit 2000 before the split and again they will rock. Netflix is the future and the king
"What is that popping sound? The shortie's financial future. Eh, the world needs ditch-diggers, too."
This is what happen when company pressured from Investor. This is reason I say all along that Raising stock price is not good for company like Netflix. It just push company to make short term decisions that only hurt long term potential.https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2018/06/06/despite-season-2-issues-netflix-greenlights-13-reasons-why-season-3/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=yahootix&partner=yahootix&yptr=yahoo#2c33473b79ae
"MSFT much safer, little competition, next high flyer, the cloud will increase this business and stock over 50%. Little or no downside. FB still getting high growth. GOOG and AAPL also safe . Tesla, I would not touch."

"Netflix maintained buy and $630 target, expected to report strong Q4 results, says CanaccordCanaccord analyst Maria Ripps expects Netflix to report strong Q4 results as the recent price hikes have enabled ongoing investments while the competitive landscape evolves. She believes estimates for the company could be conservative depending on the timing of billing increases and potential price hikes in other markets. Rips has a Buy rating and $630 price target on Netflix shares."
So what’s the word on today’s actionI think it will be a replay of yesterday dropping to 560 and then closing around low 570sWould love to see it bottom out at 530s early so I could cash in on my puts and call it a day
"Move over to IQ folks. Weak growth. Going to be weaker with higher sub costs, and new competition from T and DIS. IMO. GL"

Is TechStrategy still around ? He was shorting since 2011.
Only question now is does this run into the close. Why not. Finish 210.75. Next week hits 220 and 230 before ER. If that is good it's 250 by end of January.
"Netflix will post good net gains on subscribers next week. There are a lot of scared, weak-minded people who have sold and that is a good thing. It only serves to fortify the fountain, which will be stronger as we get back on the tracks and full steam ahead to new highs!"

"IMDb, the film and TV website owned by Amazon, is launching a free streaming video channel that will be available in the U.S. on its website and Amazon Fire TV devices, the company announced Thursday. Unlike streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, IMDb Freedive does not require a subscription, and is instead supported by ads, according to a press release.The streaming space is getting increasingly crowded as even legacy media players like Disney have announced plans to create their own services. Apple, AT&T and others are also planning to launch streaming video services this year. But IMDb's ad-based model could make it attractive to consumers"
Netflix Stock Gets Price-Target Cut As Subscriber Outlook Lowered
nflx was at $138.66 low this year. Now it is $315. This is roughly a increase in value or price of $180 or 150% in one year or 5 years. Can anyone complain about this appreciation in shareholder wealth?

$320.00 just around the bend!!! Shorts keep buying more please. The spring will keep getting tighter and your short positions will create a buy to cover to get out. Niiiiiccce!!

400$ after ER or higher possible
My theory on this stock being a total POS will be vindicated
netflix has a stockpile of cash in hand they cannot lose. if they see a decrease in income they can reduce the number of shows they produce and save millions. the big funds manipulate this stock with news but long run it's gonna be a great stock. if there's no minus in front if eps it's a winner

I still contend several biggies knew about the 2B note...waited until earnings sent it higher and imediately sold before the announcement of the 2B was made. Classic insider trading. Too many knew about securing the 2B and the stock reacted VERY funny from AH’s to close the next day.
have you seen how much NFLX drops after it surges? Almost equally. Great to swing trade or if you are seriously long then we all know you got in wayyy before these price points. Point is I can't say it's a bad company but anyone buying in now or pretty much above 500s is taking huge risk IMHO. Then again a lot of the market is the same but NFLX surged way too high wayy too fast so it will correct before anything else does. And then on a big market correction day it will not be good for NFLX but great time to buy in
"From the release: ""We’re looking forward to a strongslate of global content in the second half of the year, including new seasons of some of our biggestseries, Stranger Things (July 4th), 13 Reasons Why, Orange is the New Black, The Crown and LaCasa dePapel (aka Money Heist) as well as big films like Michael Bay’s Six Underground and Martin Scorsese’sThe Irishman, and expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019"""

"So according to my research again, this is my research (my opinion). Netflix should meet its subscriber goal this quarter. How you may ask? Look for Netflix google trends, traffic analysis, and mobile app ranking overtake. In conclusion, I found that October wasn?t a smacking hot month for unique visitors. November got better. I will pause here and let you know that story changes from here. December was Netflix?s best traffic month ever in history thanks to the holidays and yes i have to give credit to bird box and bundersnatch for making that happen. Few days back a moron analyst price cut netflix from SunTrust who said it will miss. Now yes, October and November wasn?t as hot as i hoped it would be but the dude based his full conclusion from google trends. Thats the biggest mistake he made as there is a lot that google trends misses and did I point out he didn?t check December #$%$! He should be fired in my opinion or at least investigated. His words can have an impact as we live in an age of computers trading and crowd following traders we saw a 4% drop that day but later closed neutral. Google trends does not know how many people are visiting netflix domain without a G search secondly if you log in from an app it wont be able to catch that. So I also checked traffic analysis for the domain as well as app downloads. October and November again showed decent progress but nothing out of the ordinary as 9.4 million subscribers is a huge ask. Which i was worried at first but after December we might actually make it and it still could fall short. I recommend you buy here not only because of sub meet but also we are currently in a technical breakout.."

It’s an earnings day stock. Everything in between is fluff. Either up $50 or down $50 on the release.
"Netflix sees a deceleration in new subscriber additions in the second quarter to 5 million. Wall Street had expected 6.09 million.Sales growth slowed for the fourth straight quarter.Operating profit margins fell 190 basis points from the prior year.The year-over-year growth trend in paid memberships also continues to be lower.At an outflow of $460 million in the quarter, Netflix burned cash at a faster rate than the year ago quarter ($287 million)."
No other FAANG stock went down as much as Netflix. 7%. I bought more today. Anxious to hear what the shorts say.

Begged you to buy this before ER. Said they would beat on subs and stock would rally 5%. This is predictable. Cant understand why everyone didn't do.
There seems to be a lot of angry shorts on this board.

I am from Europe so we don't have Disney+ nor Apple stream here yet. But i read a lot of people talking about on this board. Do they have many subscribers in the US or the rest of the world compared to Netflix 150 million? How close are they in terms of catching up? Can't find it anywhere. They must be around 100 million subscribers each orso already since everyone is boasting about them... Help?

"Netflix price target raised to $700 from $650 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $700 from $650 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares, stating that the ""moment has arrived"" that he has long believed would come when the company moves to ""sustained and substantial"" annual free cash flow. His new forecast for Netflix to begin share repurchases later this year, and assumption for $2B in share repurchases during the second half of 2021, compares to his prior estimate of buybacks coming in 2023, Swinburne noted."

Nflx is a well- managed company that has a single focus that is its expertise and dominance. Long term investors win with a company like this.

A 10 year member. My wife and I search for 30 minutes trying to find something decent to watch before exiting Netfilx. It's getting to the point where even $10.99 isn't worth it.
Everyone stops in to kick a stock when it takes a hit. Netflix will likely gain half of this loss back tomorrow. Possibly be back to $400 by Friday.
accumulate and cover is the news here today.
I am getting flashbacks to 2011 with $NFLX and look what happened
wow...today's gain alone almost equals all of 2017 revenues. Complete insanity---
Disney is a way too confidant to think it's content is so good that they will be able to grow streaming subscribers without having to spend like Netflix. They have another thing coming to them. Time will reveal they had it all as a Netflix partner but greed got the better of them.
"NFLX WILL DROP BIG BY THE END OF DAY. Quiet selling going on, high volume is telling it, but No ""anals"" want to discusing about it.NFLX is falling today because comcast just conform that they are dropping bidding for Fox asset. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/ac951e65-52bf-39be-a7b9-c2f642c5035d/%5B%24%24%5D-comcast-drops-bid-for.html"
nice solid consolidation before breakout next week
I'm buying 100 shares tomorrow morning
"Whoever buys $NFLX BUBBLE at that ABSURD Valuation, DESERVES to LOSE EVERYTHING and WILL LOSE EVERYTHING!KEEP GAMBLING!"
How you going to bring up Netflix to all time highs when it didn’t even hit earnings estimates
Party’s over!
"FANG have one thing in common, they are the fastest growing large cap companies. That’s why Jim Cramer chose them when he created FANG. Netflix is the fastest growing FANG and its stock has outperformed the others over the years, yet it is the only FANG that hasn’t made a new all time high this year. Look for Netflix to zoom past 423 its all time sooner than later, on its way to 500 this year."
"So is the rotation over, out of hype (DIS), into real growth NFLX"
I just traded some FB for NFLX yesterday. Not too sure I'm making the right move...thoughts?
"I'm in. Small position, but I'm in."
"i bought in before september earnings last year, and yesterday just barely pushed me green "
Is there still some loft left in NFLX hot air balloon?
When is the earnings?
"NASD will breach all-time high next week, then down she goes for the summer."
Is it really that hard to figure out that NETFLIX is going back towards $600 this month? Come on people. Buy and make some money!!!
NFLX will open higher regardless of where it trades tonight.
Welcome 400 Friday morning
Guys After 2 hours we will start buy 40k share Just follow me This week up to 380$

Place your bets....pop or drop after close?
"yesterday was ""KEY REVERSAL DAY"" for NFLX stock.....This is super bullish."
I got those $420 and $430 calls for super cheap... TY SHORTS 
Trading the AH swings today could have made you far more profit than being long before earnings.
"Just sold, it should scream upwards now. You’re all welcome"

Way to hold up Netflix .
"Most of the guidance for this Quarter ER from CEOs will be measured and conservative, knowing that interest rates will go higher and OPEX due to inflation and tariffs. Question is will the investors take that into consideration and not react negatively as usual and bring the stocks down. I think guidance for most high growth stocks will be rather cautious and investors should adjust their expectations accordingly."
If you look at the recent transaction with att and Hulu to value Netflix you get a market cap of 90-110 billion nearly 35% below their current price
I'm hoping for a pop to $435-$440 after earnings.
I like Roku very much but seems like buying it @ $95 is like buying $NFLX @ $420... I'll just sit on the sidelines and wait.
You do realize today was another all-time closing (212.52) and intra-day (213.60) high. Got its steam back today after a one day break. We need another similar sized move tomorrow to catch up.
Let's be real if you are going to post about the price movements. There is only a 3% short interest with about a day to cover on a heavy volume day. That means they are essentially irrelevant regarding price movement. That means if the stock goes down it is because bulls are not buying at whatever level.
everybody take a deep breath and relax; add a few shares down here
Takes a strong stomach to hold onto NFLX.
Whatever your position long or short you should have reduced your exposure before they report. I cut my shares down to where I’m ready to add if it sells off. I’d rather sell shares ahead of earnings for a small loss. If it goes up I have enough shares to profit and if it goes down I can add.
Early this morning Goldman Sachs increased price target to 490 from 390 but you have to dig real hard to find the news. If it was a downgrade it would be all over the place. I've always found sentiment indicators to be the most reliable. Netflix is buy until it becomes obvious sentiment is bullish across the board.
"NFLX is one of the world’s greatest companies. The stock won’t stay down for long. It’ll soon be back to its highs, and go up from there.It’s a great time to buy. I’m a long term holder, bought at $423 and holding for $5000."
Cord cutting continues and nflx will do just fine. The drop is an opportunity to buy some shares because it will be $400 but the end of the year.
Going all the way up
"NEW TARGET $255---Analysts at Loop Capital bumped their price target to $252 from $241, saying ""it's not too late for large-cap growth investors to establish positions."" Analysts at Buckingham upped their price target to a similar $251 from $235, while maintaining a buy rating on Netflix stock.But the one analyst TheStreet's Jim Cramer was focusing on during CNBC's ""Mad Dash"" segment on Thursday? Morgan Stanley's Benjamin Swinburne.Swinburne upped his price target to $255 from $235 and maintained his overweight rating. He also raised his estimate for international subscribers additions in 2018 to 16.9 million. Even that may be conservative, Swinburne acknowledged."

At least we closed above 375.
Correction from earlier post..Not $375 after earnings $384!! #NFLX  Congrats to all longs that held through this massive dip and continued to add!!!
365 tomorrow
Anyone else think $NFLX is expected to have huge earnings and great new subscriber growth but is probably priced in already so once numbers are released it could go down?
can we add the after-hour increase to my portfolio? Haha
"longs are here to bask in their success, shorts are here to brag about losing money and share conspiracy theories"

Hey guys. Netflix earnings on Thursday. Supposed to be tough 4Q is Netflix going to best earnings?
$600 coming
NFLX barely has a presence in China which is the primary reason for AAPL's revenue issues. Robots are trading this. Will snap back tomorrow when actual people are trading.
NFLX is grossly hammered by media and overall market: unfairly mistreated like no tomorrow: given its huge subscription growth rate in international market and potential service pricing rise: its free cash flow and EPS will be in accelerating track in 2019!
NFLX could give away free subs and burn cash for the next 10 years and this market would still reward it.
"Netflix Inc.'s stock price target was cut to $458 from $463 by analyst David Miller at Imperial Capital, after the streaming video giant tapped the junk-bond market for the ninth time in six years. Meanwhile, Miller reiterated his bullish outperform rating, saying Netflix has a history of using the bond market effectively. The stock rose 0.9% in morning trade. Earlier this week, Netflix said it was offering $2 billion worth of U.S. and euro denominated debt, which Moody's rated at Ba3, which was three notches below the investment-grade rating threshold. As Miller said, the U.S. portion of the issuance will launch at 5.375% and the euro portion will launch at 3.875%, for a blended rate of 4.475%. In comparison, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.20% during the April 25 week. Miller said that Netflix has showed that tapping the debt markets has resulted in ""clear-cut, tangible, global subscriber growth and retention,"" as he assumes the proceeds from the latest debt issuance will go toward content acquisition, mostly on the self-produced side. The stock has climbed 18.4% over the past 12 months while the S&P 500 has gained 9.8%."
Netflix faces multiple growth challenges moving forward making its current P/E ratio of 133 difficult to justify. The company is no longer the high-flying technological disruptor of old and is slowly evolving to be a content generator or media company. The previous growth promise of technology changing our viewing habits has already come to pass such that the technology to build a streaming platform is becoming more readily and easily available.
Reed Hasting will be the richest man on earth Wall Street will make sure of it.

"Subscribed ESPN+ and it's great. Work very well. Navigation is good.you can watch live games, Some great documentary movies, NFL Draft series and more. ( I think they going to limit 1 game /day but you don't watch more than that)I think this may be helpful to Streaming service like Netflix, it prove there is no technology advantage Netflix has. And Content clearly Disney is still king and with Fox deal going to remain that way.So I am not sure how people think Netflix can handle competition from Disney and Apple and list of other. At Best case scenario, people rotate service. Worst case, people subscriber on Service like ESPN and very limited money left for Service Like Netflix.Think if you have 200M subscriber but only for 3 month out of year that's just 50M subscriber. Netflix might get custom to service rotation as quality streaming service grow."
Analysts have the earnings estimate set too high for a beat. This is going to be similar to Costco’s earnings with an outrageously “unbeatable” earnings.I like to stay bullish but will play PUTS on this one.
"Very informative piece on CNBC about Netflux and all the competition coming in. They were stating Netflix was always overvalued, however, they had no competition so that helped. Now with all the competition, the valyationncan no longer be justified, their monthly price will probably need to decrease, content costs will now increase and this valuation just isnt sustainable."
This stock has held up and should of been to 250 without down market. I expect it will open below 250 or trade through it and accelerate. It's extremely high off 50 and 100 day and expect more downside.
"NFLX or TSLA, which one is better potential in the short term?"
15 min til Bull run to eod!!
"If after earning this go 400+ I will start shorting again for sure. Today I sold 345 calls expiring today just for premium. I am 99% certain it not going there just based on bogus analyst reports. Entire 2018 all they done is inflate and result their master make huge amount of money manipulating stock price based on report and retail who jump after seeing excitement, most lost lot of money. They going to keep repeating until retail get smarter and they can't benefit. I think this time retail going to smarter than last year and not going to get trap on every raising price promise."

Good earnings call. I recommend you all listen. They have sufficient new content for the rest of this year and next year. Good guidance. In addition they are in contact with many offers to buy content. Netflix will rule for several quarters to come. IMHO
The premium plans price is increasing to £13.99 starting from the 25th February 2021 !! This is going to make netlfix stocks go even higher

"you guys have to understand that wall street controls the media sentiment and hype for companies. The""analysts"" that set price targets work for Wall street. How many do you believe are actually telling the whole storyconcerning stocks. It is no different than a politician commenting on a topic of public interest. It is slanted towardtheir side. wall street creates bubbles in stocks on purpose and for one reason. To take your money."
"DIS is the growth company with them entering the market, nflx not so much, scrounging around in the remote areas of the globe for international growth. How is it that revenue per subscription is only slightly lower when entering less affluent countries in South America, Asia, India, etc. The math doesn't work unless they are paying $9-10 per month."
nice recovery. closes virtually unchanged.
been holding and buying since it was 124. I sure wish I could have got in 5 years earlier
so nflx cant grow much now so they are asking users to sign up for more accounts they don't need...gg nflx.
"This Laura Martin certainly has a bias against Netflix. I would not be surprised if she has friends shorting the stock.She puts a ""buy"" on Roku yet a ""hold"" on Netflix. Really? Roku is not even yet profitable, has far fewer users than Netflix, and Apple+ TV and other cable companies will give away free streaming devices yet you rate Roku with a ""buy"" and $150 price target? I wouldn't trust a thing she says about Netflix losing subscribers.Netflix will be at least near $290 before earnings."
They're going to knock it out of the ballpark once again!

"I cut my cable. I got tired of paying forprograming and then having to watch 5 minutes comericals every 20 minutes. With Netflex I can watch what I want when I want with no comericals.

"My concern is that the big money firms are going to walk the price down slowly over the next few weeks as they sell, so that the small investor's continue to hang in there. Kind of like the analogy of slowly raising the heat in the pot the lobster is in (lobster doesn't realize it till it's too late!). As opposed to throwing the lobster in the boiling water and have it jump out. The next few weeks will be interesting to watch."
580 soon split and keep running. They might just buy AMCX or continue licensing their content. But the minute AMCX decides to throw in the towel NFLX should allow anyone else to acquire them
90 New movies a year planned by Netflix.
"In my opinion, as a consumer, Netflix is significantly better than its rivals. They have the best offering of movies, original content, and platform. Netflix also has the largest customer base. It is a question of valuation. This stock will rise again once the short sellers have run out of opportunity and exit all of their positions. The long-term strengths are too positive here. I have 300 shares and I am down 20% right now. But there is an ancient Chinese proverb that applies here: ""The ox moves slow, but the earth is patient."""

"As more online streaming available. It's no brainer People will use Online streaming and take internet from Cable or who ever provide.Reason is simple. Main advantage is on demand nature without worrying about DVR, Timing and many other thing. Only live stream, Cable make sense. (Cable likely go that route as Internet still yet to figure out pipe size issue but getting closer. Live streaming is reality but still behind by min or two compare to Cable).Subscriber also like to see all different content and use multiple streaming.Now biggest question is:- What keep those subscriber subscribe year round same service:-I find no reason to subscriber year round right now. Month or two more than enough to see all new content I like to see in 1 year.With Online, you can cancel anytime and subscribe again.Very soon people will figureout and stop keeping year round. This going cause limit on how many subscriber you can have.given how quickly $NFLX marketing budget going up per new Subscriber, this might happen already. Netflix able to find new subscriber to replace those and still able to show growth but coming at increasingly more cost. When Netflix realize it's not financially sustain it will stop spending more on marketing."

Download growth also remains elevated from pre-pandemic levels, and has stabilized globally at 0%-10% in recent weeks versus down (20)%-(10)% in January/February and up 40% in early April, Anmuth tells investors in a research note. The analyst believes the data show upside to Netflix's Q2 guidance and he reiterates an Overweight rating on the shares with a $535 price target."

Now even USA it hardly reach there.Now look at Income.In India 85% household don't even earn $1000/Month. In other word they can't afford $10/Month. Cable service does not even cost $10/month with 100's channel.So At best I give chance to reach 10M.Same article estimate 0.5M paid subscriber in India.This is how insane claims people make. When it come from CEO this look seriously fishy.I wonder if he inflating subscriber count using robot just to create hype and stock price raise. If Secondary Stock offer announced soon, It will just confirm my theory that They need money and using Stock as Money and fooling people."

You trade long enough, you can tellIt is up about 47% from the bottom 12 days ago and around 4% was today. Anyhow, they appear to have less than 10% growth from my calculations and a PE of 120. That might indicate that they are about 6 times too high. For debt to go up $4.5 billion in one year is a huge amount, especially in a rising interest rate environment and with competition coming on so hard. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity.

grandma sold nflx last week thursday. When grandma sells everyone sells. ha ha. I love that woman
The CEO states the obvious. No sheet your business model is in trouble. Huge debt + rising costs + declining subscribers + strong competition = bankrupt nflx
Easy 320 today
"Keep the faith longs! The bar to entry for over-the-top streaming is very high. DIS and T are trying to compete late 2019, but will take time to get any momentum going. T has not been able to monetize the assets they already have. DIS will initially be a niche player for a certain demographic, unless they start to produce their own content. Youtube premium maybe showing signs of trouble (placing ads on original content).NFLX is already anticipating the competition in 2019 and is already ahead of the game. They are arguably the best platform for the widest range of multi-screen devices. GLA"
time for 330
Nice comeback from the 3.58% drop. 2nd best day this year. It was up 26.37 (9.72%) on Jan. 4Best close since 362.44 on July 17 of last yearNow up 9.93 for the week and 26.03 for the month.
Apple not buying....I know there has been speculation they might.
What a destructive and meaningless drop today...
"Look at the plus side, things could be worse. Green indices and Blockbuster is not red. Today is equivalent to depressing the accelerator pedal but the transmission is in NEUTRAL."
"Competition in the space is only INCREASING.... going forward which makes the current nosebleed valuation for NFLX extremely difficult (impossible ?) to support.... Again, based on current NASDAQ analyst consensus estimates, TXMD-by far-has SIGNIFICANTLY.....more upside potential than NFLX going forward....The NFLX party is about to end while the TXMD party has not even started....Good luck to all "

"Here’s the upside for Netflix. 5G rollout will by EOY will benefit Netflix push for mobile. Streaming gets cheaper every year and that adds up to Netflix bottom line. 5g will allow countries with slow internet speed to finally catch up to the west and it will spur innovation all over the world as we have seen with the rollout of 4G. We are looking at a new bull run in the US economy and many mini bull run on many nations which in turn will increase its middle class base which will directly benefit Netflix. We are looking at another 4 more years of additional bull run. If you doubt the 5g bull run projections, just look at the innovation spurred by 4G."
It bottomed according to WSJ
"The market is a never ending learning experience. Remember when Netflix briefly had a higher market cap than Disney? Then a pandemic came along, shut down almost all of Disney's income, and the result is Disney rocking and rolling above $200 with a 360 billion market cap. Who saw THAT coming?"

"one of the few stocks that had a great earnings and guidance, and has zero risk trade exposure."
It looks market shorts Specially retail so they will keep price here for few days before any fall
Under water since it was $555 at last Sep. Finally I have it dumped. Good luck everyone !
$495 soon
The reason Netflix has been stalling out the last few days might be because of the massive inflows into $IQ . Just buy both and you will be very rich!
This was totally unexpected! Let's got NETFLIX!
BREAKING: Netflix (NFLX) reported 1st Quarter March 2019 earnings of $0.76 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $0.57 per share on revenue of $4.5 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $0.60 per share. Easily beat
When did everybody get in? April '14 for me at about $44. Just keep holding on!
"I've loved Netflix from the beginning, and IQ could give similar results"
I just lost my cookies
This is the best growth play around no reason to sit on the fence.
"PE Ratio (TTM) 228.13, Really! hurry and buy more!!"
I figure this is a sell and buy it back next week.
"Correction:Netflix Inc. ( NFLX ) reported total international streaming memberships at 91.5 million in the second quarter. ""Netflix ( NFLX ) 2Q Total International Streaming Memberships 151.6M,"" published at 1602 ET July 17, misstated the number. (July 25, 2019)"
uh oh.
"if nflx increases rates by 1 penny, there will be cancellations. I for one will cancel as soon my free month ends. horrible movie selection. way too many low budget international and super hero movies. not many good shows."
"If Trump stays quiet, NFLX 370 tomorrow. Let's hope so."
Going to $375 today
How do you know if your a SHORT Johnson?? You bet against World Class Companies!! Congrats SHORTS!! Wrong Again!!!
"Its hilarious how Netflix is down 1.5% on a red market day, and shorts try to act like the sky is falling. This could be green by days end."
Sharing your password with non household is stealing artists and NFLX has the right to do so to protect and remunerate artists.....
230 to 270 in a week just as sharp as the fall a week before. Congrats to those who were able to get into when it was down. Sorry for those who got scared and sold out cheap. Last week every story in financial media was about market's demise. Those stories disappeared quickly.
We are on a technical breakout
Beef Stew!
400 by April. That’s all.
NFLX “down $50” since fake earnings
Netflix getting into gaming online
Let me see now....cash flow losses in 2019 go to $3.5 billion from $3.0 billion previously. US subscriber guidance of 0.3 million net additions in Q2 is way below consensus. It would appear US subscriber growth has reached a plateau and is about to flatline due to the churn from the massive price hike. US subscriber base may actually decline by 4Q when Disney+ launches. Netflix has no growth remaining in the US.
OMG WHAT HAPPENS?
"“Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria,” he said. “The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.” ~John Templeton. Talk is Talk, and Reality is Reality."
"Told you to toss a coin to the Witcher, so you could be richer...."
Increased valuation by almost a full year of revenue! Talk about crazy. That's like MFST going up $110B in one day! Gamble on!
Green today?
"Oh Where are All The Big Mouth Shorts? Thanks for your Money, will buy another new car now!! Lol"
The problem with NFLX is they are no longer a trend setter. Streaming has caught up with them They do not own the secret sauce and others such as Disney will rapidly fill the entertainment void with a vast library of rich content. None of the media giants can deliver new content like Disney. The only thing slowing Disney is their leadership as they slowly embrace streaming.
575 WILL COME
Well all I know is I listen to a bunch analyst this weekend on the financial shows and just about every single one of them said that Netflix at $300 a share you should back up the truck and load up as much is you can these guys work these numbers out to a science we here on this message board don’t know nothing about numbers when it comes to those guys because they live in a breathe publicly traded companies numbers
only 2 dollars increase. a starbuks basic cofee is more expensive than that. i am more than willing to pay that for all the original content plus amazing documentaries they have.
I LOVE NETFLIX $350 soon
got in at 415 last month im going to hold i think it will be at 500 by q3 earnings
"DIS to spend $30B in content this year Analyst at RBC Capital Markets foresee the Burbank, California-based media giant spending as much as $30 billion annually on its video-streaming push, far outspending rivals including Wall Street darling Netflix Inc. (NFLXNFLXNetflix Inc321.30-3.06% which plans to spend $8 billion on new and original content this year"
"Nasdaq Composite Tulip Mania BUBBLE got PUMPED by 170% since March 2020, despite so much terrible news, thanks to Coronavirus Pandemic. Without Pandemic Coronavirus NASDAQ Composite BUBBLE would be around 6000-7000... We need MORE PANDEMICS to PUMP NASDAQ Composite by 200% per year!!!$TSLA $NFLX"
We are back in business folks! $400 before October earnings.
"When Bitcoin was $20K, there were daily article on how he predicted such price and why Bitcoin going 30K, 40k, even 100k.People were following them like god because they seems winner of dart game. Where Bitcoin trade today."
Nice work with that $500 price target Goldman.
"I have my pop corns and drinks ready for the after hours show. The Disney effect will obviously not show in Q1 earnings but if they miss, it will be carnage."
$10.50 green tomorrow
Netflix stock reacts as if its earnings has come out in the previous day everyday
"Goldman Sachs said $670!!! They keep upping it and think it will happen. It has never been worth more than $100, maybe $0"
So shorts....show me the $220.00 bottom....Hmmmmm! Buy to cover your short which will propel this stock to $310.00 in March and $350.00 in April after earnings. NFLX may be acquired either by AAPL or DIS.
Could this reach $500? Within 3-5 years?
The revenue generation and acceleration pushing competitors further behind...if netflix feels this is the time to raise the prices(which were inevitable to anyway with a brain0...competition il have no other recourse..the competition will have 0 edge. Z
All time high by the end of the month
Buy as much as you can
Company must issue cooperate debt to pay bills. Either that or dilute
I will buy at 200
They added $NFLX and their competitors are struggling. I’m feeling good!
"We're in the 1st inning for NETFLIX growth, SAYS MART MAHENNY, OF RBC."
This is the best place for stock market news. Everyone is always correct about everything.
This should be no where near $350.00. This should be already $400.00 and over the top. Why are we playing games here let’s get this back where it should be $500.00.
Time to buy?
safe for bulls now
"Netflix borrows big to produce original content which was feasible until now with low interest rates. With rising interest rates and its rising Debt/Equity ratio, big investors know the problem and will be ready to sell. Don't be fooled by the $500 price target- it's just a dangling carrot !Few Big players already took some profits when it tested PiperJaffray’s $420 price target on June 21st.This bounce above $400 is another chance for you guys to sell sell sell !$413 is the next level when it may turn negative and go down to $371"
"earnings:$3.29 blns vs. cons. $3.28 bln...more importantly, net streaming adds @ 8.33 mln vs. est. 6.35 mln...a massive subscriber growth"
WHERE IS THE BOTTOM?
why is it going up all of a sudden?
"buying started, early !"
"Forget about cryptocurrency, NFLX is a better investment."
I am issuing aggressive buy from this level
there will be definately a huge dip before going to 600
RBC's Mark Mahaney: Netflix stock can 'double in three years' https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/26/rbc-expert-netflix-stock-can-double-in-three-years.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
I've waited too long to buy in and I did 2 weeks ago. I'm going nowhere. for 2 years I thought it would fizzle due to competition and it just keeps on chugging.
"$NFLX falls after each Terrible ER and Guidance report! But the Government still continues to PUMP the Stock price between quarters FOR NO REASON! NFLX is LOSING subscribers and the revenue growth turns to negative, but the Absurd Valuation is not coming down!"
Almost to 280! Thanks shorts for your advise!
it is heading to $560 at today's closing
Up to now less than 20% of revenue has come from price increases. In the future over 80% of their revenue will have come from price increases.
can we make 360 next hour?
Netflix is growing in leaps and bounds around the world in new countries like China and Australia ... so many more subscribers yet to come aboard. eh
I figured it out Netflix stock price inverse’s cash flow. (Operating Cash Flow) -1.79BNext year expected to be -4 billion get ready for NFLX to double!
"It’s either a buyout or killer subscriber growth , it moving up rapid well in advance of earnings"
remember when netflix hit 700 and split 7 ways back to 100 a share that's now 350 a shade could be coming again soon!!!
700 coming baby YES!!
How the heck this is up this much with earning miss
Netflix over $400 tomorrow with a late day selloff (profit takers)?
"I remember in the old days people said amazon is just a website, any one can build one, now I see people saying the same about nflx"
I should have so at 385 and took some of what I lost back in because this does not look like a good sign falling back under 370. Now it will probably struggle to stay above that.
Short now thanks
No 370 today... If still green... I'm very thankful.
Looks like we are headed to 50 day moving average around 350
Wiped out 24B in a matter of minutes. The casino stocks FANG have been over pumped!
The market big up rally tomorrow
just added to position ;
"Time to buy. Message board and market way too negative. This stock is being unfairly lumped in with all of the other FAANGs . The growth story is intact. If economy tanks, consumers look for bargains in entertainment spending and NFLX fits that category."
The 200 day MA is around $475. That's a buy point.
This will be back to over 510 tomorrow. Major selloff because of Capitol!
The market is not even down that much. PURE MANIPULATION
Skuba divers are having a field day this baby going to 340 today. Enjoy the fishies.
60% 2018 gains gone
"Some nut on CNBC said 'sold half my shares, I'm still in the game"". Sounds good but how does this NUT feel now that this WINNER is up almost 9% after hours. 9% is a great gain for the YEAR let along for a few minutes!"
"The board Hater is having fun, today."
nflx and IQ are not affected by global market..... people watch TV through good and bad times.... Just like drinking alcohol.
NFLX will soon be deflated......P/E ~270 and negative cash flow (not a good recipe during markets correction).
"Obama? Sell it Monday, maybe even short it. If the company can't learn anything from Hollywood or the NFL, the company is not what I thought it was. Alienating half of your viewership, or even that perception, is not part of a strong business model. The motives behind delving into propaganda makes the stability of future budiness decisions quite uncertain."
Where is the top? Loving it.!!!!
Any new info as to why NFLX goes down day after day?
"I wanted Netflix to grow but I believe Netflix is not playing it well. I see myself consistently spending more time on Amazon Prime Video than Netflix. The shows/movies at Netflix has no ratings, user comments and it is hard to figure out which movie or TV show is nice. Netflix is consistently degrading its functionality and for that matter I believe it will lose. Amazon Prime Video is playing it right."
"The last 2 or 3 times this stock has climbed to 299 to 300, that's normally the high for the day. After 2 pm the stock starts to tumble. They must be day trading nflx big time."
"$540 today, the last 3 days haven’t been to good but today and tomorrow will skyrocket the stock"
Good luck to all holders. Cramer hasn't done you any favors tonite on his show (personally i find the guy a blowhard... but people seem to listen)
The main reason NFLX growth was down last qtr was because of world cup soccer. time to buy...
"Disney is competition? I don’t really get this logic? Disney will have to cannibalize from its profitable business for years to ramp up its streaming platform....where is the value there? Disney is not going into the streaming business on their own accord, they are doing it because there traditional cash cow for their old movies are getting devoured by the Netflix model. The theme parks are super expensive, the dvd sales are dwindling, the old Disney cartoons are becoming obsolete, there is more risk for the next few years than value in my opinion."
540 tomorrow great short here no risk reward higher only lower
CECE should be a good paris agreement stock
Was a late winter....obvious gonna get more subscriber growth with more people staying in.
"2 massiv and huge earning after eatch ohter, probebly great earning on monday and if not is the sub grow that count."
"Being a customer of NFLX, I think there is room to add other streaming service as long as the monthly total budget is less than $20. You paid a lot for cable shows in the old days. I cancelled my cable (50+ Mbps) and switch to AT&T fiber (300 Mbps), about half the price and 6x the speed. It's no brainer. So cable companies are in trouble since they used to be the only ones in my area gave you decent internet connection speed. I subscribed to cable for internet only and the cable shows I rarely watched and not subscribed with the bundle do not save much. With the saving, I'll add DIS+ to my streaming service. I believe the package is about $6.99 per month. I'll try out for one year and if I find value in them, I'll keep both. If I don't have time, I'll just keep one. So if most people think like me, then NFLX subscribers loss will be capped somewhat. Their dangers lie in adding new subscribers and future pricing increase. People new to streaming service will likely pick a cheaper package with good contents and DIS will win in this space. NFLX will have difficulty to further increase price to offset its production cost. They will be under more pressure to give up shows that don't immediately perform instead allow them time to play out more. Based on above thesis, I will not touch NFLX until one or two quarters into DIS+ have been turned on. In this market no need to take extra risks when you see it coming."
This is just straighten out itself to move back up again. Start buying don’t let this short guys scare you. The BULLS are back and strong
And will also be green tomorrow
"Hi, I bought 5 contracts calls at strike of 600 expired on 22 Jan. Price is 0.61 . If the stock open at 560, how much could I earn."
"NFLX is shaking out all the weak hands here. Let’s see where the share price opens on Tuesday morning. $350 or $450, I’m banking on $450. Good luck all"
Sell or hold until Monday? I'm down big. I bought at 347. Please advise
Reversal coming after market
My Bloomberg terminal just gave me the blue line alert if you know what I mean.... huge subscription increase
"After Q1’s record breaking subscription numbers, Canaccord analyst Maria Ripps expects Netflix to post another strong report. Along with the secular tailwinds blowing at its back, the 5-star analyst points out the simple reason why she thinks Netflix will keep on outperforming.“Analysis of our proprietary Netflix content power rankings highlights continued momentum in original content: As subscribers around the world spent more time at home during Q2 due to the pandemic, and amid continued competitive intensity, the importance of Netflix's content slate has arguably gone up. It seemingly delivered, creating a consistent stream of interest and buzz around original titles,” Maria wrote.You can count the roaring success of Tiger King, crime drama Ozark, dating reality series Too Hot to Handle, and Michael Jordan docuseries the Last Dance among the titles which have kept sofa bound consumers tuned into Netflix. Add to that children content which got a meaningful boost during schools’ closures and a sizeable library of reality TV shows and docuseries, “with the two genres representing over 20% of the top 10 most popular TV series during Q2,” and you get Ripps’ point. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-original-content-library-separates-005355727.html"
Tomorrow should open at $390’s
Fed will signal rate cut today and stock will rally big this afternoon.

Any opinions on how high this can go? I only own 100 shares but a lot for me. Thanks
we are in the manic stage of the bull mkt those who dont know how to make money in a sideways/ declining mkt better enjoy these days before it all comes to an end. This won't last forever
I figure a real world PE for a stock like NFLX should be about 45.....which would mean a stock price of around 125 bucks.
"Look here, Cramer stating the obvious: “And, remember, thanks to Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, the combined company's going to have perhaps the best library of content in the world,"" Cramer said.""In the end, when it comes to streaming platforms, I believe the best content will win, and Disney's got amazing content,"" he continued. ""The stock actually remains cheap; it sells for 15 times earnings. [...] I think it's a buy ahead of what I believe will be a very compelling April analyst meeting."""
To be holding up today is a good sign. Not expecting green to hold today in this market.
it only takes a few days like today for it to get back to $400 :)
"HI, GUYS, THE 5 DAY CHART LOOKS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU BOUGHT UNDER $240, IT IS TIME TO SELL THE RALLY IN NFLX , netflix is now $273.10 intra day, max pain will push netflix down to $265"
We are back above Tuesday's lows already!
Lol yesterday it was up after hours and open down. Today down after hours up tomorrow
This is worth a quarter trillion dollars about as much as my house is!
I’m seeing here same lame comments that I saw in Tesla when it was at 250$ a month ago. Look at it now. Netflix will bounce up in no time. Did it before and will do it again.
lower highs and lower lows...
Up in pre-market. 
Buy Buy and Buy. I am buying too. this is a cool stock for this situation.
I really hope Netflix perseveres. FANG without it would be awkward...

"Another nice little after hours bump. This is good a good upward trend leading into tomorrow.For all those who bought yesterday, good news:Best Day of the Week to Buy Stock: MondayIt's called the Monday Effect. For decades, the stock market has had a tendency to drop on Mondays, on average. Some studies, as in ""A Survey of the Monday Effect Literature"" by Glenn N. Pettengill in the Quarterly Journal of Business and Economics (2003), have attributed this to a large amount of bad news that is often released over the weekend. Others point to investors' gloomy mood at having to go back to work, which is especially evident during the early hours of Monday trading. July is traditional one of the best months of the year for S&P returns..... so with the momentum moving forward and earnings looking solid, I think all us longs are in for a real treat the next few weeks."
Can we break resistance tomorrow? Decided to enter a short term trade based of bullish in engulfing on one day charts
360 today ?
Small Fortunes are being made on this stock today (by being Long).

Susan Rice knows nothing about tech. Why on earth would they select someone so liberal and so controversial. Talk about being completely out off tune with a conservative point of view.

confirmed with support and higher highs strength is going up as we speak by open tommorrow well be barley red or green love how charts work most don't get them they all rely on news and opionion charts matter so much to risk mitigating

These bears that have been predicting total destruction each quarter have been saying this since Netflix was 50 bucks. Now its 600% higher in a few years and on the cusp of hitting a new gear in growth with India and with a lower tax rate. What credible evidence is out there that all of the sudden this is going to reverse course? It's not happening gents. $400 by end of year easily.

"Even if The Nasdaq is down, if a company does well there is no reason to justify a 9% swing in price from its high yesterday to what it is today. Hell, on a price to percentage loss basis, neither FB or AMZN came anywhere near to losing what this did, and this company just beat earnings forecast by 30%."
"Unfortunately for Netflix the vast majority of their content is licensed from other production companies. If that weren't bad enough, what original content they do have is actually mostly producted by these same content providers, CBS, Viacom, Paramount etc. With so many parties now entering into the streaming business production costs are now running at 30% above previous costs. This certainly can not be good for Netflix. When you consider they just signed agreements for Seinfeld for over $500 million for 5 years and they actually just stated that they were committed to spending over $17 billion next year on content. If you look at their finances you will see actual shareholder equity of $6.8 billion. How can any company with $6.8 billion of shareholder equity be valued at $136 billion stock capitalization? We keephearing about the growth in foreign pamrkets, but Netflix refuses to breakdown revenue by markets."
Recovering nicely! Back to previous high in no time!
Wait till the market settles and see this fly.

Maybe this is where MSFT begins to see an entry point for an acquisition of NFLX while the stock is depressed and Porter Bibb's prediction becomes reality.

Some people were panicking at the news of 22 million Disney+ mobile app download (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-walt-disney-streaming/disney-mobile-app-records-22-million-downloads-since-launch-apptopia-idUSKBN1YF25I).In the same article it also mentioned that Disney+ competitors, including Netflix and Amazon.com Inc’s Prime Video, remain largely unaffected in terms of their performance during the same period. It backs up the unaffected statement by adding data as:While users in the United States spent about 200 million hours on the Disney+ app during the first four weeks of its launch, Netflix users have spent about 1 billion hours during the same period, according to Apptopia."
440 coming.
I bought some nflx for the first time. You have to buy something that goes up everyday. This is the simpleness strategy and therefore most beautiful strategy. people watch it shaking their head and some even go short it. But this is the contrarian method of investing. You trust the action only and not the opinion.
Lol what? Is the fed printing directly into Netflix's stock or something? Who is possibly buying at these levels? This company IS NOT worth more than Disney in any universe.
"People look into past growth and think growth will just continue.Business like Subscription normally had sudden stop or even negative growth. I think Netflix is candidate in year or so. Netflix has bigger problem because it allow to share accounts and so very hard to tell how many unique household using it. Sure those free with Cable and T-Mobile going to help for time being.AOL is prime example where it taking millions of subscriber ever month and then suddenly go to pause. While Market value crash more to do hype it was into market, Subscriber pause and decline has nothing to do with Market, It's just it monetize most of subscriber.HBO is another example:- 2010 to 2014 it grown to 80M to 142M then suddenly drop next year. Since then its stable around 145M.I think Netflix is next. We just don't know when that going to hit but market cost raise concerning for sure. And those Cable offering free netflix going to delay that problem as well but it's trojan horse and they will use it when Netflix at worst position."

I picked up a 362.5 call today expiring Friday for $4.88. It's now doubled but i have some questions. Put options are crazy expensive right now and their implied volatility is through the roof. Are we gonna see a sell off tomorrow morning? I see below some people talking something about fraud. Can someone explain that to me since i'm new here? Thanks!

"Why Netflix could surprise to the upsideThere are number of reasons why Netflix could deliver better-than-expected results next Tuesday. The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 25.9 million subscribers. In October, when the company offered that guidance, the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today. In the U.S., daily new cases went from about 60,000 to more than 200,000 today, while new infections similarly spiked in Europe, prompting lockdowns in countries like France and the U.K., as well as incremental measures in parts of the U.S., like Southern California and New York.That rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring did.The company also said it would�raise prices�in the U.S. at the end of October from $12.99/month to $13.99/month on its most popular membership option. While that move was widely expected, it shows management's confidence in both its long-term growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter. A 2019 price increase caused Netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter, but that was during a seasonally slow quarter. Also, it was a larger price hike, as prices went up by $2 then compared to just a $1 hike last year. It also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarter.Additionally, there's evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter.�Disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of December, while streaming aggregator�Reelgood�noted ""massive growth across the board,"" though it did say Netflix's leading market share declined from 25% to 22% among Reelgood's 2 million users.Finally, Netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in Q4.�The Queen's Gambit�was a surprise hit globally, sparking a surge in chess interest around the world, and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�Emily in Paris, which was already renewed for its second season, and Season 4 of�The Crown, one of its strongest franchises. Towards the end of the quarter on Dec. 25, the company also released the first season of�Bridgerton, Shonda Rhimes' first production for the service, which has also received critical acclaim.Data from Reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on Netflix, including�The Haunting,�Hubie Halloween,�Mank,�The Trial of The Chicago 7, and#$%$ Elegy."
You knew that when this stock was holding strong on down market days that it could explode higher with up markets. Such is the case. Love that NLFX hanged tough on down markets.
stock buyback will add 200/shr.
340 coming
What will be the $360 puts worth tomorrow?
Easy money on this..
Just went trough the upcomming Netflix shows trailers in the app. It's just incredible what a spectrum of programming they offer. Something for everybody. Insane...I'm proud to own shares of this compagny...

"Shorts better cover, this will explode"
Thanks for playing option buyers. No movement at all this week. Maybe next week after earnings. Of course everyone's expecting a huge swing but I wouldn't be surprised if it only moved 4 to 5%.
Im happy i loaded a bit more shares again in the morning.
buy niw or wait??
So upset today i bought 3 put of nflx355 and fb 5 cc 175 and 1 amzn 1825. sold all at 9:35 am this moring . i had the motherload on nflx and decided not to be greedy for the first tine today. Sold my 3 nflx 355's for $7.75 close at $21.I actuall bought some calls a liitle early today . I think it will bounce tomorrow but it will go lower . probably will hit under 300 .

"Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays Netflix price target raised to $550 from $420 at Barclays 06:30 NFLX Barclays analyst Kannan Venkateshwar raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $550 from $420 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. While Q2 expectations have ""run up significantly ahead of already high guidance,"" the key driver is likely to be Q3 guidance where expectations are ""relatively subdued"" due to company commentary earlier in the year and a tough comp versus Stranger Things last year, Venkateshwar tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. Netflix is one of the few content services with a full content slate which, combined with sports uncertainty, could continue to be a tailwind, says the analyst."
Netflix buy AMC soon
Disney direct-to-consumer + international segment revenue grew 3% in Q1 over Q4. That compares to 6% growth for Netflix over the same period.
what's the bottom? $350? or this is it?
"With all this talk about competition, i still don't see a meaningful threat to NFLX's content. I might be wrong."
Looks like another all time high at opening. Go Netflix!
Amazing how the stock sentiment changes so fast
"450 this week, possible ?"
Tomorrow will be a great day for NFLX!

and here we go!

Cant even hold positive earnings. It’s way too hyped and overpriced
To infinity and beyond!
Do people think that Netflix has basically saturated its market and that we are going to see little growth over the next few years?

Netflix launches its cheaper mobile-only subscription in Malaysiahttps://www.engadget.com/2019/10/24/netflix-mobile-subscription-malaysia/?guccounter=1
"Lot of people here betting we will have 8m/9m or even 10m new subscriber. They miss very important thing one of bull analyst point out. He use it as bull case that still market can bigger. I am using as bear case. I think stock will go down if around or below 6M (Meet or slight miss/beat company projection). Many think growth only go hyper based on history but problem is it already 119M. Some analyst even point out that only 600M in world (X china) have broadband and So that is 20% of overall world market share. If you add account sharing (50% likely) that's 30% of entire world. I think growth will slow regardless of Disney and Apple streaming success. If they are very successful, We may have negative growth even.Growth get harder as it go higher. Sure Recent T-Mobile and cable provider free with order reduced sharing and bring some growth in USA and rest of world market , could be reason for 4Q beat and even 1Q. (I call it trojan horse because once subs custom for free Netflix, When they discontinue result going to be mix of discontinue netflix v/s service who provide free netflix. They will use weapon at worst time then Other have more hit than netflix.)"
"somebody just bought 95,000 shares.. wow"
NFLX $550 BEFORE EARNINGS!!! Look at the yearly chart and you'll see 
The main thing Netflix is not saying about its huge miss with subscribers loss is the fact many people including me dropped Netflix due to Netflix signing a 50 million dollar deal with the socialists Obama's. That SOB added over 10 trillion to our nations national debt of 20 trillion. All Obama has to show adding over 10 trillion debt to the backs of Americans is nothing except a weaker military when he left office. Netflix will continue to go down once more in stock price when more Americans find out about Netflix signing up the Obama's to give us there socialist opinions. Sell short and you will make money.
"I think it is a buy at these levels. Netflix is the best for kids. We have Netflix and Amazon prime now, and did a trial of Hulu. Netflix is practically unlimited for kids and has too much for a grown up to park their #$%$ in front of in good conscience. Getting the amazon firesticks has made both Netflix and Amazon more accessible, still my kids use 95% Netflix. They kind of gave up on amazon after trying to search and running into non-free content. Amazon tries to make you watch trailers as well. Same thing with Hulu, they never figured it out and even I had a hard time finding stuff that didn't suck and clunky to navigate (it was a couple years ago). I cant bring myself to go back to commercials either. I spent this whole summer staying in a hotel during a work assignment and flipping channels was a waste of time besides getting caught up on naked and afraid and fix or flop."
"sold 1 shr at 379, keeping the last 3 shrs! This is a tough stock..."
Netflix never misses two quarters in a row. Congrats longs!
If they beat next quarter then the tone on this board will change instantly.
"Folks, who fuss about OBAMA, Reid, Pelosi, Clintons,etc having content on nflx etc, do you really think people are that politically motivated in their spending habits. Do u think they won't for example, not eat at a restaurant because it is ""run by Democrats"" or something like that?"
"I am a current subscriber of Netflix. However, once Disney rolls out their own streaming platform, I will take my business to them. Unless Netflix provides Live TV, I am not leaving SlingTV. The reason I have Netflix is because of the kid shows my kid likes. Disney would be a more favorable option once their platform rolls out."

"Positive earning results next week, will make pps fly to $330."
"Interesting point here. 321 was support for months before earnings . If it now becomes resistance , look out below. Let’s see how the rest of the week plays out. From past selloffs there as a spike like this , followed by more selling. I’d take some profits if you bought yesterday. Either before close or at 10:30am tomorrow."
And the dumping begins
I guessed wrong. Cost me 10k in puts. I really thought we were at netflix fatigue. Congrats to everybody who's about to get paid off tomorrow!
"Incase anyone is uncertain, yes, the selling is way overdone from both a technical and fundamental level. Technically, the MFI is below 20, way oversold. On the fundamentals, keep in mind that Q2 earnings, margins, and revenue were all in-line with forecast despite the fact that the subscriber forecast was missed by a million. That is a staggering achievement totally overlooked by the media. I expect Q3 to be a blowout so the next couplle months will likely be very choppy and should be viewed as a chance to add to positions rather than waiting for a sell point. The largest number of shares this year were purchased between 320 - 330 so look for resistance at or slightly above that level."
hawaii is going through a major growth spurt. Island to grow 15% larger from this eruption.
Netflix will beat earnings because 4th quarter is their strongest quarter historically
$593 or $560? Which one? Was $575 like a year ago. Nice “investment”.
$500 tomorrow. #Conditioner predicted this!
bought this thing at 570 and have been a bag holder since...
It is not a trap it is a bubble that will come down hard.
"Alright, nflx has found support above 300 for the time being."
"ROKU BEAT EARNINGS WHICH MEANS NFLX WILL POP TOMRROW THATS FOR SURE , KNOW YOUR FACTS"
This sell off is ridiculous
"In at 387.00 for 15 shares and a quick trade. Have a sell at 415. Not a lot, but no one got poor taking profits."
Tacked on another billion today and now up 8.5% in 4 days. Hard to know how much further this can go. I started a short when it went over 206 and have averaged up to 207 but the train is pulling away. This could hit 210 today and 220 next week.
385 before earnings. Easy.
Surprise! Surprise!
thank you short.

And the sudden sell off is because ...........?
May be reversing.Buy calls.
just remember people netflix can swing 40 points easily in one day it can be down 40. next day up 40. easy profits if you buy now.
"bought at 97, have ridden with it through ups and downs.......this will be no different..............GLTA"
"This pop is irrational, I am a long holder, don't ge me wrong I love it but there's no way it can be justified. Much better earnings reports of Netflix have yielded much smaller gains. This is part of the insane market right now. I wish it wasn't but it will correct."

She will be lucky if she is not one of the people indicted in the FISA court abuse scandal (it was not just the FBI) that is unraveling. The Benghazi stuff is old hat compared to her toxicity on the FISA scandal. Netflix, drop her now. The worst parts of the scandal will be where she is committing felonies by unmasking the names of US citizens such as Michael Flynn to the NYT and WA Post for pure politics."

Great day to buy more Netflix before earnings! Love this company! YTD 32.45% gain 
"every since we sold our LONGS on NFLX when first broke 405 on 6/19, we logged a very nice run of 60 points from 345-405 (and plenty more in past 3 years), since 6/19 we have logged well over 50 points on shorts, after each runup and pullback (some 5 points and some like today we got 15 points intraday). So, after earnings we expect NFLX to initially dump below the 378 support, probably 350-365 range. We will then go LONG again, ride it back up 50-70 points to alltime highs. This is SWING TRADING folks, way more profits in long-run, and we dont risky losing equity on huge pullbacks, we actually capitalize on shorts when investors are running for the hills. If you wanna truly learn our system, you know where to go..."
Subscriber growth missed for second quarter in a row........stock will come down tomorrow!!
"Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha....Sad to say, but I think our overall market bear run is coming to it's finality. All good things must end eventually. Better bull days await when the bear runs its course."

"Is netflix business model recession proof in your opinion, when things are not as good, consumers retreat to there televisions and movie and series content, to save cost of other activities that are much more expensive?? Opinions are welcome thanks!!"
They have so many tools to pumps these stocks. They can make it go wherever they want.
Is there any upside left?
"Average P/E of an SP 500 stock is around 12.9. NFLX's going-forward P/E is supposedly 129. Thus, NFLX's P/E is around 10 times the average P/E of an S&P stock. So, NFLX should be trading at 1/10th its current price, or around $34 per share, to be on an even par with OTHER S&P 500 stocks."
"Comcast announced earnings today and ""Management said on the earnings call that it expected accelerating cable TV subscriber declines"""
Crushes expectations...down 25%...makes no sense. Institutions are buying cheap while instilling fear in the clueless
"It is trading in a very tight range $326.25 - $328.50. Strange, as if a tug of war going on, like a coil, if it breaks thru on the up side we can see short term $345."
"As a die-hard long, I live for days like this!"
Seeking Alpha article says the PE should only be 40and that puts NFLX worth $165 per sharesell
It’s not a loss until you sell
Drops like a rock despite being more popular in the UK. Even families that have no money to go on vacation due to the market crash are likely to keep their Netflix subscription than even cable...
I placed $2500 on PUTS and $2500 on $600CALLS. Best way to play earnings. 1000% profit here I come.
"Netflix is not only streaming service, it is international movie studio. So much content coming."
UP 3.4% deal happening
Netflix competition just got stronger
"As I said, wait on market down days to get in low 500s. Market in general is going crazy. be careful."
Anyone not buying at these levels is missing on a big opportunity.

"the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us."

I wouldn’t be surprised if it gaps up $5-$10 tomorrow.
I’ve had Netflix for a long time and I think they need to look to make more money off the subs somehow or this thing is going to start going down
One way or the other this company is a pioneer with no actual competition at the moment.Netflix set the new rules to everyone in Hollywood and the whole movie/series industry worldwide. 500 by year end.Good luck longs
Netflix cannot continue to lose billions each year while claiming to have wonderful content. When are they required to writedown the value of all the cancelled series and movies that no one viewed?
Barely makes targets and stock goes up 10%. Talk about delusions!Next qtr's numbers are being goosed by the increased prices but for how long!
Shorts throwing everything in final tantrum?
Netflix is giant king streaming in the world
How high NFLX can go?My best guess is 325-350 range near term long term may be 490
"Netflix's latest earnings indicate strong growth will continue and margins will improve. However, most of the good news is already baked in the price."
"An open farce, content up $1.2B to over $13.3B and amortization. exp up $100M. Try to sell some of that $13.3B content and see what you get. Auditors went along with it when it was small and now they can't backtrack."
"Netflix would be unbeatable if they acquired a broadband company. If you want people to completely cut the cord, offer Internet + Neflix outside of any cable or dish program. I would jump on that in a minute. I hate having to pay my cable provider for Internet just so I can use Netflix."
Buying opportunity??
"Be very cautious, pre and after-market trading don’t mean squat. Hopefully it holds, but I’ve experienced way too many times where it did the complete opposite when it started trading in regular hours."

"They are on fast track going from licensing content to producing their own which has high upfront costs and returns coming only 1 to 2 years later. So how can they still keep a 25% subscriber growth rate!?? They must be saving a ton producing their own content. This company is in a sweet spot. When they reach the production/ licensing balance they're looking for higher cash flows will kick in, subscriber growth rate will be at a high, and profits will soar. 500 by years end and 1000 in 3 to 5 years."
Hey guys dnt ever sell ur shares after reading this chat board...people who are saying nflx will down are either shorting it or are regretting not getting on the train early on.. it will go past 615 next week without any doubt. Dnt forget nflx is buying back their shares. Goddluck!

Someone is buying a lot. I see it going to $350.00. Could be tomorrow or Thursday. I’ve seen this pop 5 to 10% in 1 day. Love Netflix
"Overvalued by any measure, projections are just that, projections, 20 times earnings get this to the real value of 50 per share."
Then next quarter Netflix will announce that they lost 8 of the 8.5 million subscribers which they added this quarter and the stock will take a 20% nose dive. I'm so sick of this stock going up & down like a Yo-Yo. That's why I took it out of all of my clients' portfolios.
"Blast off at bell. Shorts, thanks for covering."
NFLX's loudest detractors continue to be the ones who fear owning it. They will fear buying it at 300 and 200 because the valuation will still be too high for them.Every great company that has ever irreversibly changed the world has stumbled along the way. NFLX will have another stellar quarter eventually and to those burying it today will watch from the sidelines again.
short it... you might get lucky. but more likely you gonna lose money!
Presifdsdsf4 days ago$NFLX conversationI bought 1000 stocks at 405 with margin and paying interest daily. What should I do?ReplyReplies (24)45
At $331.61 the 200 day average is critical for tomorrow. If it breaks it and closes above it we will see $350 before earnings
net profit up 10% in the quarter thank you Microsoft
I'm holding this stock till $1 or $1000.
"this stock reminds me of amazon - the talking heads say that the valuation makes no sense, and they would never invest in it - but the stock continues to climb for years. I'm sorry I didn't invest when I saw the writing on the wall 8 years ago."
"We need more DEM wits without a brain to way over pay for NFLX LOL,LOL You just can not make this stuff up as NLFX is now having customers dropping NFLX in droves because everyone is now getting FREE HBO MAX with their unlimited cell plans from T LOL,LOL,LOL"
First 4-day losing streak since going 6 days in the read from April 18-25
robinhooders know what will follow tomorrow and they all rush to catch the traintomorrow will open 600
Will be green tomorrow. lot of shorts will be covering
Wow selling tomorrow
Share of this stock are “less owned” says JP morgan. Im not sure where they get this stuff? “Insulated from regulatory and data privacy concerns.” Says who!!?!? I doubt NFLX is setting the standard in these areas. The subscriber growth is all this stock has..
370 coming.
"What happen why its dropping, any news?"
Easy tomorrow another 20.00 upward from after earnings. 420.00 better try to buy tomorrow before the open.
"Buy, buy, buy!!!"
Let rock for the day
"I don’t see $400 today, let’s not get overly exuberant."
I love the fact the media is playing Netflix like it's the whole market.
Still no stampede to the exits. Not enough volume. Expect it to be propped up before close.
This thing could go up to 360 tomorrow. Shortsville is boiling over now.
"When is Disney’s content being pulled in entirety from NFLX? I’m up 80% on NFLX, but certainly watching Disney’s moves..."
"""Scale is the most important factor in the media industry."" ""Scale is very, very powerful."" John Malone."
Might we see 580 tomorrow?
"Guys, if you want a realistic pricetarget for Netflix, check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGxCXFGiJlI"
If growth keeps up in this pace and with this price hike they start to generate money end of this year or next year already instead of 2021.
this should be up
whenever I need a laugh I come here and look at shorts talking about how NFLX is about to crash 
Looking real good for $400.00 today and maybe a little extra.
If I buy more this will drop tomorrow. If I sell out today it'll skyrocket tomorrow morning. This one is tricky.
"Netflix has a hard choice. Adding ads will lose subscribers. no ads, revenues could not cover expenses. Nflx is either combatting with no ads. or with ads streaming competitors. It is difficult to hold on current price"
"I am letting it ride. Buy your tickets, take your chances."
"Netflix just said in call that in 2020, the plan is to take over the earth.."
Will open at $410 tomorrow morning and will run up to $420
"40 years ago today, Air Force Veteran Ted Striker and Flight Attendant Elaine Dickinson landed a Boeing 707 after the flight crew and many passengers were stricken with food poisoning. Please have a moment of silence for these brave hero’s.Short $NFLX Short $TSLA"
"What a JOKE! They are PUMPING $NFLX MEGA BUBBLE again, Despite Falling Earnings!"
420 todayalso Netflix will hit $420
Roku and Netflix ??????
75 cents though probably not real as they plan on borrowing $12 billion or whatever it is$3/$417 = > PE 190so the forward pE looks likke 190 instead of 90sell time
Only subscriber count matters today
If Germany throws a tariff on Netflix then it goes down another $50. It is only a matter of time before some foreign government figures out that they can make 10 to 20% off Netflix.
STCN - next 5x
I think a rumored takeover by Apple is driving this stock higher every day. I really do.
Good odds they beat expectations. Over the last 7 ER they missed only once on international by 0.2M subscribers and beat 6 times with an average beat of 1.3M subscribers.
Anonymous in panic mode again.. Losing big time.
we are going to 200 tomorrow !! Apple will makean offer for $275-300 a share with all the cashthat will be available from overseas !!
What you all think will it best earnings? And stock will jump?
Always remember if your short what your looking at 126 P/E 10 billion in debt after a keep the lights on junk bond sale of 2 billion. Its pump and dump manipulation there is no value here long term only endless hype with a massive debt reality topped with aging technology that every tech entertainment co is now throwing their hat in mix.
Yeeey green
"25000 call options expiring this Friday, $600 strike. Someone knows !"
looks like 50 plus tommomrow?
to the moon we go
"Netflix revenue up 24% this year vs Disney revenue down 6%, Comcast revenue down 6% and AT&T revenue down 6%. Let it go. It’s all over, Netflix has won."
Do you think this will continue going into the week
Hard to imagine people pay this price for a company that burns cash and is t profitable.
I'm cancelling my NFLX sub to offset my short losses. I should be back to even by year 3020.
"netflix will continue to voo away cable customers from dish, timewarner, charter, etc there is practically no stopping them for the next 5 years. They use cutting edge cloud platform technology for providing ever improving plethora of streaming options at ultra HD quality of all shapes and sizes of devices. they will strike many more media partnerships in near future to establish their hold in the world."
"Wow, all the earnings gains are gone."
Is it quite possible for this to sink to 230 this week?
It's kinda simple. When you think yourself of which streaming service is best Im sure 90% of people say netflix. Their decision to make a lot of (great) content is going to pay off as it has already. No one else (besides maybe HBO) is making new successful content like they are.They are building studios in countries around the world. Lets not forget the global marketplace.
NFLX great company. we will be seeing $360 soon.
"The shorts are working hard to prevent NFLX hitting $350 this week, but they will fail! See you at $350 soon!"
Buying more
Shorts better cover-this thing is about to fly
Today’s action is very good for NFLX. All weak hands are out. Institutions & smart money got their hands on cheap shares of Netflix. Now it will be easy to breakthrough $380 resistance and hit $400+ price target :)
a 10-15 dollar haircut is in order
"I already have too much of this, but they just posted a monster quarter, announced they’re no longer burning cash, and you can now get it under 500, many points below the monster quarter even happened"
Thumbs down to Netflix price increases! I may have to drop it for awhile and try Hulu.
"Bohemian Rhapsody, dead pool, Glass. AVATAR 2-5(COMING) This is Disney content. They bought 21st century fox to put a strong hold on content. Then you got bird box...."
"Did anyone do the math for India? You seriously think they will spend 1% or 800 rupees of their yearly (44,000) income PER month on Netflix?"
I shorted NFLX today. Will cover short below 240 next week
"I dont know how people can be so confidant that NFLX will give better guidance going forward, clearly there has been FOMO buying and the price has skyrocketed, then a price increase announcement 2 days before earnings report? this screams short if you ask me..."
Bulls bears and pigs know this thing USB’s about to tank. The most shorted stocked rebounded the most. Everyone knows how questionable this business model is. 108 PE as of today ... I got my whole account short NFLX and if somehow goes higher I’m doubling down with margin
"What happened to 400 few days in AFH? Man, this stock is rigged to crash below 250 in a week"
Debtflix has an enterprise value of $168 billion with no free cash flow in sight for years. This stock has enormous downside.
I am watching PE ratio everyday and wonder how high it can reach before it crashes.
"NFLX becoming cash flow positive is a major blow to the shorts’ thesis. This is despite coming competition from DIS. This tells me that not only will the two coexist without cutting each other’s throats, they will be like Coke and Pepsi. They target different markets so there is no bear case to be made here. $600 a share will be here soon."
"We need a $10.00 up day, today!"

Holding from 312. Didn’t sell any.
So sell or hold? Verdict please less than an hour remaining
"Disney? Hastings doesn’t give them much thought, they are years behind. He’s thinking of where Netflix’s next growth area will be."
$375.00's tomorrow and more
it's only going high shorts. big investors are adding to their position. FANG
Buy buy
"Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) price target set to $450.00 by Goldman Sachs Group -- 01/21/2019"
MM won't let it go higher today because of calls sold. Next week it goes higher again and calls will be sold for end of week. 520-530 possible next week.
Above 265 is possible tomorrow and above 270 on Friday.
Wfh stocks will rally this coming quarter. This is where you want to be! This things a beast even when corona is not a thing
407 for tomorrow sure
"Simple math, this is going down. Algo is recovering the amount of loss. Imagine going down from 343 to 300 that is big hit. Now it will be 363 to 343. Thats how it works."
"based on charts and current news events, expect NFLX to drop back to $300 and below; AAPL back to $180 - $190.SPY down this week to 260-265agreed?"
God please help the longs
Oh look. Everything is Ok now.
"Netflix has a finger on the pulse of what the general public wants. If you check social media, there are memes being created and shared by the thousands about Netflix content. Hulu and Netflix both put out Fyre Festival documentaries. I don't know a single person who was talking about Hulu's. Critics talk about how the Adam Sandler movies and Bird Box were awful. That's true, but it doesn't matter. Because the general public consumed the content in record breaking numbers. I think people miss the bigger picture with this company."
"The usual. Driven up during after and pre hours and then sold off after those who can't trade during those hours buy in thinking the stock is moving up. Why are people allowed to manipulate stocks like this? This is a pattern especially with Netflix that should be regulated somehow.Stock closed at 309, opens at 317 and drops to 312 with a few hours. makes absolutely no sense. no stock consistently trades like this."
this stock is amazing
I don't see what's so great about this anymore...they have some good original content but that's it...they are gonna eventually loss most other good content and they don't do anything special everyone knows how to stream content I never had a problem with disney ....maybe it's worth $100
never fear netflix rules
Do u think we will beat
not worried at all as long as im in at 332 over 2 years selling half at 660
Hey now!
What's the easiest way to buy downside protection with options?
425 today
If you buy a put or call regardless of action the options will drop.. 100+ implied Volatility
"Took my 40k in gains on my $397.5 , $400 and $405 Puts today and bought $5000 of calls expiring Friday for $390-400. Feel like it’ll rip back up very fast... if not, great week overall..."
Looking like a beat has leaked....sorry shorts
This needs to start kick like amazon. Everyday green. Let’s start the fire back on. This should be 600.00
"NFLX moves into the S&P 100.I'm new to this stock, is this known prior to today..?"
"If this doesnt fall more then 3.5% in AH, chances are it will be green tommorow"
can anyone tell me what Amazon's p/e is? thank you
Setting up nicely for mid-week rally after big tech earning announcements AH on Wed.
Short
Down volume picking up in premarket
"Uh oh... Roku going into the streaming business to compete with Netflix. They say their service is incredible. Roku will their tech embedded into every TV, which Roku TVs are awesome."
The analysts will come out Monday and Tuesday to upgrade this stock. Of course after they and their friends/families bought lots of stock at this level. The price will swing up this week.
I think this is a warning of rocky earnings. The adults are going to be asking fund managers why they are holding this tomorrow. Going to be interesting day.
Every dollar drop means I lose 20k :(
Don’t worry buy more. Netflix is the best with what they do.
Tom Rodgers former NBC executive and founder of CNBC just said on CNBC no one will come close to Netflix. Everyone will have Netflix and other services will be fighting with each other for 2nd and 3rd place.
NFLX doesn't like higher interest rates. Decreases the PV of future earnings AND increase future borrowing costs.
"Buy ...300 by Wednesday, next week"
Movement this morning is identical to how it was in the first 3 minutes of trading yesterday. We all know how that ended by the end of the day. Don't get too excited.
What should I do ? Sell before earning or keep until earning . Nobody knows what will happen with the earning
"Netflix price target raised to $670 from $575 at BofA, BUYBofA analyst Nat Schindler raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $670 from $575 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst is taking a ""cautious stance"" on subscriber growth heading into Netflix's Q3 results on October 20 but believes the long-term story is ""stronger than ever."""
There are zero examples of entertainment or tech companies EVER maintaining multiples like this with this kind of debt load. Debtflix has nothing in common with the cash generating juggernauts that make up the ither FANG stocks. They just needed an N for the acronym so it wouldn’t be politically incorrect.
lmao how many shorts do you think lost all their gains from October with the NFLX comeback? no wonder they're all here sharing their salty tears
Im afraid with the price this low somebody is going to buy us up-AAPLToo bad would love to see this double in the next 2 years
Terrified shorts posting week-old articles...
Streaming is the new wave in TV and film so it is an attractive area to invest in. What are you going to buy if you want to be in that space? Exactamundo.
I heard NFLX is gonna introduce infant twerking......Biden loves this stuff
Blues are winning
"The story remains the same. The majority still have $100/mon pay TV and are shifting over in accelerating numbers, along with their $billions freed up from pay TV, to better value streaming services where Netflix is the leader. Hold on tight. Don’t let them separate you from your shares."
"10,000 calls, $550 strike expiring this Friday. Let's go !"
"remember, a stronger apple is not that great for Netflix. It means a stronger competition with more money to spend."
"Bought AH yesterday, and rewarded today as I expected."
"Haven’t been this high in two and half months. Let’s rally into the earnings. Not making a prediction, but the momentum that this stock is capable of, wouldn’t be surprised if it’s over $400 again going into the report"
7/17/18 $344 low. nflx starts to move through that resistance and the shorts will be pushing it up to $385-400
Thanks Barack Hussein
400.00 stock by Halloween
I sold 1000 sold shares and bought IQ.
short squeeze could soon drive nflx stock up 50%
There is no reason for this stock to slow anytime soon. Next earnings will rocket this past 600
market is rigged. They try to pump this stock up even after $2B debt notes. Unbelievable sheet.
LONGS ARE WINNERS! THAT'S JUST REALITY!
how long before we're back north of 400?
"Going out on a limb folks - I predict we go green at some point today, and then attempt to break the $370 resistance level. It's gotta happen sooner or later - might as well be today."
Just remember the negativity spread during last ER and rest was history.
"I'll have my money in GOOGL and Disney and netflix. Why? Because, if disney loses out to Comcast, which is hated, then I see Disney doing a deal with Netflix or Googl. Disney has worked with Netflix in the past. Not to buy then out but to work together once again. Googl could also work with netflix and has the money to buy them out. Oh yea, lets not forget about apple. They have the money to purchase Netflix as well."
MY retirement just become whole from loss in ENRON. Thanks NFLX
CNBC just reviewed the Ican and Ackman brawl. I remem ber Ican said he sold nflx year and half ago citing competition. Boiy he sold too early. All the shorts who took his selling as a sign to short were wiped out. LOL
"thats all???? all the cries for 30 bucks under a share? if you look any farther than a day, week and even a month... nothing to worry. to big of a company to fold after a bad qtr. and u know what, not as bad of a report than many talk about. invest.... and go live your life. do not check any stock on hourly basis. not healty down the road"
The stock will increaseEverybody stand on Netflix
just buy like always
Beware of ER and EPS missed
14m people dropped cable tv last year. Next year it is expected to boom to 47m. Those cutting the cord will be buying both Disney and netflix-both will be winners. A lot cheaper than that 100.00/mo cable bill.
$400 by Friday
Netflix is in the green.
Cash flow positive in 2021 and 8.5 million adds. Wow !
Does anyone remember what happen to zoom after earnings?
"Markets are going to close very, very strong today. Looks to end at highs of the day and of course highs of the week, month, year, and decades!!!"
"Mtvx electric scooters, Future World FWDG, COWI, RTON,DRNK, APTY stock market software"
"Just remember - tomorrow is 'window dressing day"" for money managers. Last day of the month trading. You can expect the unexpected as managers either flee stocks or do what they can to prop them up. Trade at your own peril"
"Rise hot air balloon, rise! There is no limit to how high you can go!"
The days of NFLX's monopoly on streaming entertainment are long gone. Everybody is doing it now. Their multiple will merge towards the mean of entertainment companies.
Short squeeze tomorrow is going to be epic!
"Just curious, with Netflix being so heavy with debt, what is the hit to earnings if interest rates start going up (they are already going up)? Not trying to be a shortie here, wondering if anyone has done the math."
Netflix is going down. alot of people are going to unsubscribed because if their greediness
BLOATED. The market will correct. Expecting a decline of 20% or more.
should I short ntfx or wait till tomorrow
"short cover first at 340, it looks like it is not safe to short tomorrow"
"So let me get this right. For the price of Netflix. You could buy Ford, General Motor and Tesla? Is that correct? Is it really that insane? A friend of me told me this"
"best to not short moore this is the most profitable for retailer long in history, they will take it up 20-30-40 usd just to knock out short one day after earning, even if the ernings is bad."
Ouch
"Well, it may be time to grossly recalibrate my thinking about what a company is actually worth. If Tesla is allowed to have a negative 12 dollars EPS and can rally 4 percent today, then I guess we can justify Netflix at a price of 10,000 per share; just like bitcoin. Why not? Boy, bonds are starting to look real good to me."
Tough to call. $4 up or down before the numbers doesn’t mean much for this one
er before market?

Can someone give me good reasons as to why this will rise on earnings?
"Content providing is becoming me too! NFLX will be forced to switch to an ad revenue sharing model, or suffer a slow painful decline..."
thank you for letting me buy today with a nice discount
Why aren't any of you mentioning the subscriber growth rate? Nearly 9M new subscribers last quarter! That's HUGE!
For all of you shorting it... I think you are a little late to the party.
320 next is 330
happy for now however Netflix should learn from cable companies mistakes that price and product matter. increasing cost without increasing service result in declining interest.
I will get back to my old profits if this goes above 310. Hopefully that happens by Tuesday!
"new highs are inevitable. pension, hedge funds, and fan boys will make it so."
Look at NFLX rally!!! GO NFLX GO!!!
Good news guys! We’re up $0.39 in after hours!!!
"Sell NFLX - Disney coming with Hulu,ESPN & Disney plus package in 13 bucks .."
Down $25 in a month. Will be down $100 by June
"To increase growth, you need better content. I was upset that one of my favorite shows was taken off. More content investment equals more cost. Which may or may not payoff."
"want to short at 260, some one keep buying to push it there"
what do you how far netflix go
NFLX momentum==1. ER2. FANGS stock in uptrend now!
No news from Apple about streaming = Netflix the king for years to come 
410 easy today. and up before earning
Here is a good reasonablee article regarding Raymond James belief on the sector. This is a real “expert” and knowledgeable person than the paid pumping by garolou on here. It’s dangerous to listen to paid pumpers. This article is not anti NFLX. It’s positive on NFLX.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-strong-subscriber-growth-hulu-221203720.html
Look at the 3 year performance of Deutche Bank!!
lucky I not sell it thus morning
"50 point bump up over next 2-days. Screen capture ~ save it, let that sink in."
What do you guys think this will be at open?
Netflix shows down to negative time to race to my computer to SELL as the us markets fall even IBM stock is DOWN after earnings my golly how will all this effect the market tomorrow? I must sell to be safe.
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 320.10
Some gains will be taken next week (new tax year) and this should push price lower.
AMC THEATRES TO OPEN !! $GME $NFLX $CHTR $T over to $AMC Movie theatres to open in NY$DIS $DISCA $CHTR $T $AMCX $NFLX $CMCSA $CABO $ATUS $WOW
Was a fake pump premarket and that squeezed shorts. No one is buying at these levels. Need to go to 500 to make it attractive.
Deutsche Bank is the most heavily sanctioned and penalized global bank. Record fines for manipulating and distorting markets.
Short squeeze
my loss is now $28K so sure getting into uncomfortable level but some reason I am not feeling concern. Not good thing because I keep thinking to short more and use my buying power which now lowest of last 2 month. Need to keep writing - follow principle to control my mind.
"NFLX will beat. The way things are, more people want to ""Netflix & chill"" the world over."
going to 500 after earnings
something is burning ....
The P/E ratio is over 200 where in reality it should be n/a. The free cash flow bologna is an accounting trick that Netflix uses. They are hemorrhaging cash. If they put content spend above the bottom line like every other company who has ongoing operating expenses an investor would get a much clearer picture that this company is losing TONS of money and will continue to lose tons of money as long as they employ this business model. It’s really a catch 22. Continue content spending hemorrhage cash. stock eventually goes down. Pair down content spending. Subscribers bail stock tanks. It’s a lose-lose scenario. It’s a broken business plan
"SWING SWING SWING...I warned you guys...and I offered my levels. but no one listens on hear, i only get bashed EVEN WHEN IM RIGHT 100% of the time.....FYI, 90% of swing trading is knowing the stock market. Guess what levels wll hit next on NFLX in next two session when S&P500 drops another 1-2%....you guys seriously need to start swing trading with us"
Analysts will be raising earnings and revenue estimates. Momentum investors will take this to 1000 by years end.
CIDM stock is a better streaming play right now!! they just aquired the indian version of NETFLIX and have annouced a new streaming app
If this is true then WOW! Rocket Shiphttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-could-add-over-6-193500333.html
Anyone bought at 420 ?
doom spam up in this thread
Q4 quarantines worldwide will skyrocket this earnings....will hit 575 next week
Lmao at shorts
"Ok , I'm giving everyone a fair warning. I'm about to buy NFLX for the first time ever. Usually when i buy a stock, it goes down immediately. You've been warned. "
"It’s all about content spend, Disney has to quadruple just to catch up to Netflix which is way ahead and has almost zero content spending"
What time are earnings happening today? is it after the close?
wow no one discussing this.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4181820-citron-expects-netflix-dip-back-340
$500 soon. Sleep on that!!
You can think of NFLX like a roulette wheel - for every 18 reds there are two greens.
netflix nears China deal.
"The sharks are circling, PE and P/B are screaming 2000, I give this market 3 months and all the fresh marks will go down like they did back then. just a matter of time."
Hi traders I own 10 shares at 332 should I hold king or take profit
Back to $360 tomorrow it looks good
"Interesting, with the company hiring Susan rice, many will cancel their service, many don't like her from the Obama administration.Enjoy this ride for now next month will be different!"
"14% jump in a 200b company, yep, bull market is almost over"
setting up for a nice start tomorrow!
With all the price target increases to 650+ this'll be 600 tomorrow.
This is easily one of the most over valued stocks on the market right now.
Final trade yesterday on CNBC - sell NFLX. How's that working for you?
Nearly 300 PE...Seems legit.
Holding a range of $358-$360 for the past hour. Let's see which in direction it breaks out ....
Buying!
RBC Capital raised PT to $440 today. i wonder how it will react
UP 20% In After Hours Trading!!!!
Netflix might become the next Hollywood for actors and actresses.
one question.... where were these experts when it was jumping up 70%?.... experts have hind sight.... no foresight...
Netflix fundamentals hitting on all cylinders:1. Cord cutting is accelerating.2. Competing streaming services losing billions.
Run Forrest run. Shorties better run for cover cause 600 here we come.
hope it keeps going up. waited too long to get in and did at 400. need to recoup
what did i say 5-6% by close of day
Enjoy the ride boys and girls. Wish I were on it...Congrats!!
"NFLX is a great idea and a great company. It is just that it's stock price has become bloated. This is just a modern version of a cable network (TW or Comcast but does not own the pipe to your home so can't sell other services), so it is more like a broadcasting company ABC or NBC with less content, albeit perhaps more entertaining. So how does it garner a market cap equal to 75% of Disney's who's content rakes (as well as other streams of revenue) 5 times the top line revenue of NFLX and 6 times NFLX earnings. This bloated pig of a stock will trade below $100/share probably below $50 during the next downturn."
Susan Rice? wow.
Only the MM can keep NFLX under 295 today
omfg it's going green Netflix 395.66 today
it will split at 500+
Got in at $287 and I’m not getting out. Netflix is gold; it will bounce right back up.
There is no comparison between Netflix and Disney.. nflx content is unbeatable and stock going up all green tomorrow..$290.
nflx will open $362 on 4/30/19 and will touch $350 by Friday this week
It usually rips higher about 12$ from here...”stocks” & “the Market”. Whatever people
"Netflix is the new Hollywood. I don’t get why theres so many shorts on this board. Investors know Netflix will be around in 20 yrs and it’s currently stealing all of the cinemas best writers and actors. If you’re not making a superhero movie, you go to Netflix. If you want to make an hbo series independently, you go through Netflix. The company had too many hooks in the industry and it will be the number 1 studio"
https://www.barrons.com/articles/3-reasons-netflix-stock-can-still-grow-a-lot-according-to-goldman-sachs-1538497554?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo
Agree with GS. This is a $500 stock and way too cheap at this price point.
Whats tomorrow is this going up or down
What will NFLX close at tomorrow?
"73.3 million international and 57.9 million domestic subscribers bringing its total to 131.2 millions.I’m going to laugh all the way to the bank! All naysayers, will be vaporized. Huge wave of covering will ensue. Watch. 500 easily next week."
"CBS report a good Q helped by strong licensing revenue from Netflix. Les Moonves gets it. I believe Bob Iger gets it, we'll see if Disney continue the Marvel TV series with Netflix."
Good luck Longs. Hopefully we see amazing numbers

Citron Research Lowers Price target on Nflx to $120
wow look like is going back on track
The volume is over twice average. Foes that mean buying and sellimg is roughly equal?
Netflix will be 350 by end of day tmr and 400 by august
Hey where are all the $500 per share expert analyst now?
Missing guidance from 5 million to 2.7 million subscribers. I’m actually surprised it’s not down a lot more. That’s a 45% miss.
Netflix CFO steps down
I left with 400 short as my 295 put not exercised (lucky $600 gift) I cover 100 at 289 and now shorted 2 282.5 put for $5 premium.Still have 100 open and plan to cover and then short higher until this go below 270.Overall I am making solid profit on this run and Overall Loss YTD is now <$10K ( This was one point $60K+)
And to think this was 140 at one time last year I guess we wait till next year
bubble has burst so aggressive sell off is over. Buy with confidence across the whole market.
What are the predictions for Netflix this year. Netflix will go back to $400+ as streaming numbers overseas ramps up exponentially and foreign investment tapers down while investment in movies remain the same. Profit will start to rise by end of year
"In a 6 month time frame, including the most recent bump, ROKU is up 183%, while this thing is up 16% and dropping; yet again!"
Amazing debtflix comeback happening right now! I can’t believe this...might go up $380 at close today!
I see a $5-$8 up day today....
Buy signal today: $380--400 in two weeks or so!
Netflix and everyone on board the ship happy New Years true leader of them all
"Netflix continued dominating the streaming video ratings from Nielsen, he streaming leader took all of the top 10 spots in Nielsen's most recent viewing week (Jan. 18-24).https://seekingalpha.com/news/3664179-some-older-series-help-keep-netflix-stranglehold-on-streaming-ratings?mail_subject=nflx-dis-some-older-series-help-keep-netflix-stranglehold-on-streaming-ratings&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-3&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha#comment-88081634"
Just need some time
Do you honestly think those that are buying the monthly description to Disney for their kids are going to cancel Netflix? Come on!!! What are they going to watch !?!
Double top.
This thing is dead money for now.
-20% drop correction territory
bought some shares 353
"Bought 250 shares in the morning open, gaining quite a bit already, hoping to see $400 back this week."
"I still do not understand. Netflix owns nothing. Its original contents are not that ""valuable"". It is just a streaming service!!! Soon (most likely now) the other company will start gang up on Netflix. Once they will stop feeding contents to Netflix, it is the end of Netflix!!!"
Headed to $140 Billion Market Cap.
Hopefully a split
Nickelodeon And Netflix Set Multi-Year Output Deal For Films And TV Serieshttps://deadline.com/2019/11/nickelodeon-and-netflix-set-multi-year-output-deal-for-films-and-tv-series-1202784788/
calls expired now time to get on track on the way to 600
I wish I had more money to buy more more more Netflix. This is going to explode $360.00 today easy
Ozark is coming
"I read a lot about apple here. Wil it be something like Amazon prime, a few shows as an extra or will it be a full on streaming service? I cant find a lot of tv shows online that they are going to make."
There is bound to be a 3-5% pull back on this
Netflix never ceases to amaze me. my only regret is not buying more.
Good entry today
Still have time for $370.00
bad content is true. I always cancel after trial because there's nothing to see as far as I'm concerned.
"Here is three very negative news that impacting dow to drop 700+ point and one of most impacted stock for each is Amazon and yet it's stock drop only 2.34% after recovering quickly.1.> Tariffs:- China tariffs going to hurt Amazon most. Trade war will hurt Amazon as well because Amazon has lot of global seller and lot of Amazon brand created by putting their label on top of Chinese manufactured stuff. So This should drop as much as $CAT drop.2.> Internet Regulation:- This again impact most to Amazon. Amazon is E-commerce giant and regulation means it will not able to do lot of thing it currently doing.3.> Internet Privacy:- This is third item:- When people think about Privacy most matter is their blogging/personal post (FB), Their Shopping ($AMZN) , Listening their home conversation ($AMZN/$GOOGL), Ability to let anyone one ($AMZN recent doorbell idea to let package deliver inside),Their TV Watching Pattern ($AMZN, $NFLX, $GOOGL).So each item has major negative impact for $AMZN and yet Amazon is least impact stock even after so much run up.This is call way over optimism. This stock should below 1500, may be even near 1400. Only thing going great is technical but it going to break down at 1525. So I guess after that only it will drop like rock. After all entire rally build on top of technical."
I need to celebrate tonight
Perfect! Thanks guys!
all the way up to $400 by June
Any longs have some HUGGIES TO SPARE???
"People investing based on wrong matrix called Growth. Given high penetration in many developed market, Growth isn't great matrix but how many Subscriber left who might subscribe.Here is NFLX Subscriber peak analysis and it's scary.For No. purpose I am using 30% more household due to Common netflix account sharing. Which likely conservative.Current Subscriber count:- 125MWith Sharing About 165MTotal World house hold (Ex- China which clearly not going to launch anytime soon except licensing deal with limited extra income.):- 600M80% world population live on <$10/day, most of them can't even afford. Normally those household much bigger and so I assume 40% house hold can't afford Netflix like service more than month or two/year So Let's Reduce 35% house hold = 390 left.Now let's assume on average 50% of that 390 subscriber (Which actually mean 65%-70% penetration with sharing. This is very very high number because even USA they can't reach there and their marketing cost already balloon in USA just to keep current growth rate) = 185M.My prediction, Peak around 160-170M , after reach 150M, Growth will stall or even go negative. Growth likely slowdown in quarter or two as well.If price raised within 2 month, we might see 2-3 Quarter of growth Stall and peak reduce by 10% at least.If you are retail long, this is best time to take profit (Atleast some profit) peak is not far from here on growth. Normally stock react few month advance. So recent quick raise is due to expected growth near peak which almost always certain for popular services like Netflix, HBO ,DIS (HBO experience peak even in 2014 and so Disney on their current business Line).Only difference between HBO , DIS and Netflix is, unlike DIS and HBO who generate real profit, Netflix still spend $2B-$3B /year and add debt. Also not other businesses to balanced out."
WOW .. just one earning ... made a huge difference
All the streaming services combined aren’t as much competition as cable TV was.
"NFLX went up very quickly from last quarter, even they issue debt of additional 1.5 billions. May go down same way."
I’m buying more more MORE I LOVE NETFLIX
"Just like it didn't go up from $300 to $400 in one day or one week, it won't go down from $400 to $300 in one day or one week either. NASDAQ 100 is at all time high. So, downside risk is much higher than upside potential for all stocks that have unreasonable valuations at these levels. NFLX is no different..."
Very rich valuation
"Nflx always runs pre earnings. Held that $500 nicely, here we go boys get ready. $550+ coming soon!!"
345-347 Before lunch
This is going to break green today
"wow cash flow positive, what an accomplishment. is that hard to do?"

"We are going much higher than ""three fifty"" this week."
"street money is coming back to NFLX as everyone realized it will go again to $400, If I had money I would buy it for sure."
Will DD $FUBO earnings fully tonight and add tomm. Patience is a virtue here this is the next $NFLX bigger than Netflix with the sports betting coming real soon. Draft Kings is $30B cap vs $FUBO $3B cap.
"So what I saw today from watching the tape. Retail buying and chasing up(small lots)...meanwhile, the market maker was picking up those orders and then eventually sliding them over to large block sells (plus 7000) . Still don't know what to make of all this but be on guard."
Any predictions for tomorrow?
"IQiyi has over $4 Billion in annual revenues.Global growth company.#1 Streaming company in China.So many revenue streams unlike $NFLX. $ROKU holders may be interested also.- 100M+ Paid subscribers- 400M+ Ad supported- gaming with Skymoons- IQiyi Sports- Content distribution- Settop box- 37,000 video screens In Shanghai subway stations- Streaming deal with New Zealand Airline- VR movie deal with hotels- Membership deal with JD.com- VIP deal with Ctrip.com- Licensing deal with Netflix- Licensing deal with NickelodeonMore"

Back to the 400s on its way to 500
I would imagine it is difficult to manipulate a stock substantially higher when the manipulators are the only ones doing the buying.
405 by Friday.
"NFLXPE 1203,999,374 3,907,270 the last quater income is to the left, the one before to the right3999/3907 = 1.02351.0235**4 => 9.76% annual growththings are slowing if you used the last two quarters and annualize that to find the growthsome problems are1. the PE is 1202. the debt went up $5 billion and they got a half a billion in income for the year3. competition. Today Amazon released their free TV, check for yourselfThere is a lot more competition than Amazon. You can get a Fire Stick and get TV for $40 a month these days.Others are starting streaming. Many others and building content.4. manipulation. Can't prove it, but it didn't seem like they were buying, but it does seem like they are selling. You trade long enough, you can tellIt is up about 47% from the bottom 12 days ago and around 4% was today. Anyhow, they appear to have less than 10% growth from my calculations and a PE of 120. That might indicate that they are about 6 times too high. For debt to go up $4.5 billion in one year is a huge amount, especially in a rising interest rate environment and with competition coming on so hard. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;the GDP is around $31 trillion. That's money changing hands. Wmt used to have an income of 5% of their revenue, maybe it is less now. Point is, the most the country income is is likely $3 trillion.The interest on the national debt is $600 billion and likely to climb, even without the debt moving north. That's 20% of the national total income.That's a serious issue and the entire country is in denial.So, QE4 or QE5, whatever you might imagine is likely to be muted out of necessity. Costs need to be cut, which will likely put serious downside on the economy, like it or not. A recession is upon us. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;its up 43 percent in 11 daysand then they upgrade itwhy?To sell it to you.Did they say to buy at the bottom, before it went up 43%? No;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Book value $11.49Price $337, seems a bit extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;someone here compared Disney to Netflix. It makes you realize that NFLX is grossly overpriced. NFLX's PE is almost 10 times as high. NFLX's debt to equity is more than 4 times that of Disney's. NFLX's current ratio 1.39. Disneys current ratio .94."
"Hulu reduced their monthly fee, should Netflix be scared? After all Hulu is competing from that space. We can also look at this from another angle, The only business that I saw reduce prices in th past are companies in desperation like block buster when they reduced their prices to compete with Netflix, Movie houses when they rolled out $10 a month unlimited movies and many more to list. Reducing prices on already established price point is a move from a position of weakness folks."
Once this thing is above $390 it's going straight to $400. Manifest destiny.
It looks like It is finally starting..
Taking profit today would be very wise
"As I said earlier, $550.. we are there now....."
Hello there. The markets are shaky right now and a crash could be imminent. Do you know where to put your cash? go to (http://Multistockalerts.com).
sucker's rally in the opening hour?slowly drifting down ... distribution continues?closing below open.
I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this hit $600 mid morning
"NFLX tries to maintain the current price level if it can to the end of June, but the market down trend can pull it down. Bankers will sell 3 days to 1 weeks prior next earning (7/16/18). The selling will drive down price so they can buy low. The retail investors should take profit now before bankers selling. NFLX was around $295 prior the last earning because of heavy selling from bankers couple day before the last earning."
"Once AO was the 'first mover and leader' of the internet... once Yahoo was the 'first mover and leader' of email and search.Netflix does not have a huge selection of content, many Netflix investors are going to learn very quickly when Disney, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, etc. is pulled from Netflix just how sparse their content is. It will be worse when Warner/HBO follows suit."
"Get in now not too late , $427 by close tomorrow"
I knew it was going down today.
"I am no longer going to watch CNBC, especially when there is market turmoil . They always make it worse."
when do they release earnings?
Is this just a short squeeze? Don’t see any news.
"I see resistance at 454.00, oh well. We’ll get there in August."
who sees $400 by next week
2 mil more subs than expectations for 14% up ???
Shorts
"If raising subscription prices was such an easy panacea, all companies would have done so. This is a competitive market and there's no telling what the effect will be. I consider it a negative as they cited rising costs, which means margins are being squeezed. Don't short because of the insane volatility in this stock but if you are long, I'd consider selling some, especially after this huge run-up on no news, which smells like a short squeeze."
Hold!
Anybody holding lithium here (LAC)?
"I will continue to say this is a dead cat bounce. Some funds are caught with the surprise and even though NFLX had quarters like this, it is different this time. A few years ago the cable guys and network were asleep at the wheel and there was no AMZN, HULU and APPL. The competition is definitely different this round and the results in the past quarter are reflective of this. People are lured to other providers besides NFLX. They may have some original content but others can also put money on creating something even better. As for international subscribers in Asia, there are not many paying customers as people are used to free content and there are lots of those TV top boxes now that are floating around. No one is willing to pay for content there. And China will be a big joke. Just wait til trade war extends to content and the Chinese will ban all partnerships to show content that they define as immorale western values."
Never
$227 before close
Textbook short squeeze. Enjoy the ride! Congrats longs!
"MarketWatch 21 JanuaryGoldman Sachs expects strong results and steeper gains in paid global subscription additions. On Tuesday, it hiked its Netflix ) price target to $450 per share from $400 per share, implying 32% upside for Netflix ( NFLX) , which closed at $339.67 per share on Friday.Netflix's ( NFLX ) deep roster of movies and shows in the fourth quarter should propel its fourth-quarter subscription additions to 9.7 million -- well above guidance of 7.6 million -- Goldman Sachs senior equity analyst Heath Terry predicted in a note to clients."
Stock split in the horizon?
"$585 baby. Yes, fly baby fly."
Expecting 9.4 million subscribers in 4th Q....that tells you all you need to know...Business is booming!!!
$NFLX PONZI SCHEME will COLLAPSE by 65% soon!
If they are talking about buying back their own stock they must think it’s cheap. This increases the chances for another 7 to 1 stock split.
200 million subscribers wow
"“At the other end of the income statement, Netflix’s adjusted Q2 earnings are projected to skyrocket 433% from $0.15 per share in the prior-year period to $0.80 per share.”"
Scale provides a strong moat in the film industry. It’s what kept Disney and Warner on top for almost 100 years. By filming all over the globe Netflix is taking scale up 10 fold.
"American TV shows do not dominate the TV screens of Asia so why should NFLX be any different especially since the majority of their offerings are of questionable quality. Be realistic about the growth prospects of NFLX and realize that it is still way toooo overpriced at USD 120 billion. When the market realizes NFLX's income and revenue cannot keep up with the debt, much more pain will come."
This always sells off on earnings
In my opinion we will go up easily to 450-480 to EOW
i have to now eat crow and tell my boss i was kidding about retiring.
"Back to back Green days for the 1st time since Jan 4-7Hit 360 for the 1st time since Oct. 18, 2018 (362.20) that was the day after the Oct. earnings and the slide started.355.81 close is the best since 364.7 on Oct. 17, day after earnings.6th day in a row that the high from the previous day is surpassed.3 day winning streakUp 15.96 for the week and 16.31 for the month"
"So much negative missinformation before earnings, Yahoo Finance peddled some of these boiler room lies. They worked the retail investors HARD on this one."
"Great company that’s showing competition fears were overblown. Disney is the only one remotely competing, I would not be surprised if more than one new entrants leave the industry entirely"
you could go sledding down this chart today
Corona cases are spiking all over the world! I won't be surprised if nflx hits $1000 in few months.Tomorrow we will be greenNext week we will test $600
any single ladies with 1000 shares? need a guy with lots of love to give? looks not important?
NFLX numbers will be off the page at earnings! This will run above $400 any day now and may get to $500 right after earnings! One analyst already has a $487 price target for that reason!!
What I can say is: WOW
I think this will break 600 easy. I kept mine through all the rough and tumble.
"Sacred games from Netflix was aired this week in India and it’s already become the house of cards, way to go nflx"
600.00 by September. Watch.
Close to 400 real soon.
$330 by end of March....
"earnings report soon: July 16, 2018!"
It’s really green now and of course tomorrow too
FANG stocks are in a correction process.
Watch out the big short squeeze tomorrow if shorts cannot drop NFLX in the thin market now.
9 dollars...no adds...less than 40 cents a day. Z
after 280 little pull back then 315.
needs to break 380
waiting to load up at 300
Netflix is the king no one can touch then great job Netflix
375 tomorrow
If it hit's 595 I'm topping off my short for some serious gains tomorrow so I can cover at 550's I mean who the heck is buying still at this range? I know true investors will dislike but us who day trade and swing trade follow if you want to make easy fast money. I'm sure it will come back to this price range later this year but man way too high to try to maintain short term
"Cable TV is in decline because subscribers pay mostly for distribution vs Netflix subscribers who pay mostly for content. Cable TV is still holding on to 90% of the market so Netflix has a long, long way to go before the ride is over."
"Will woke up this morning, opened the window, and took in a deep breadth. ""Smells like new money,"" he said to himself. Let the day begin."
"shorts having been saying this stock is a bubble or it will crash and burn since June 11, 2011 when I purchased at split adjusted price of 37.27 and I did not believe them then nor now."
230 after Earning is reasonable.
"One year ago NFLX was trading at $140. Today it closes over $300. Very impressive. But has the company and its prospects really changed that much? What am I missing? This is madness, right?"
"In a statement, Netflix defended its decision: “We strongly support artistic freedom worldwide"" and only removed this episode in Saudi Arabia after we had received a legal request from the authoritarian regime— we aren't interested in truth or justice, just money."
It should be around 290’s right around earnings. If they miss subscribers numbers it will go down. Otherwise 330$ for sure. Again Netflix has the biggest content on their platform compare to any other given.
My company just reimbursed me 5k for my tuition. I’m thinking of putting it all in 400 September calls. Just worried that the stock has next earnings baked in.
"time to party, NFLX Longs...https://youtu.be/cFk0SSmmvfQ"
my favourite stock and also the best in my portfolio
"If nflx beats, shouldn’t ubs and the reset of analysts that were mistaken be investigated?"
this is stronger than AMZN.
Netflix will close between $435-$450 after earnings report.
So AMZN had a great quarter nut weak guidance and NFLX had a great quarter and Great guidance and the stock went down. Does not make sense.
50% cut in corporate taxes will boost earnings.stock will rocket up.jus sayin
Nothing's changed since yesterday...scared money still don't make no money. Z
600 call volume for next week is insane. Wonder if it’ll get up to that.
time to take profit on long trades and prepare to go short.
don't let big get your cheap shares---hold it or buy more:I see NFLX hit $1000 in 3 month!
Buyers will come in after 11
Avoid Netflix 2021 is what all Brokers are saying. Time to Short Big on Netflix and send Obama to a lower tax bracket.
"Yahoo needs to make comments in other chats stay in those chats. No more $BABA $ABBA $AAPL $NFLX spams, gotta make the spammers actually work for a change lol. Otherwise these spammers take over sites fast."
"The gary Cohen thing we knew would happen, and as far as nexflix is concerned either someone is buying it or the next quarter they are going to blow out subscriber growth"
DID YOU NOTICE THE GREEN MACHINE BROUGHT IT UP 4 POINTS. THEY WILL BRING IT TO 420 SOON!
So cheap now should jump $25 today at least
"As of January 18, 2018, China held $1.7 trillion of our debt. In fact, China is our largest creditor and will make a fortune with interest rates rising here. IQ is largely known as the Netflix of China and they report earnings in just over a week. We already know they will do very well because they beat expectations last time and raised guidance. Other oversold Chinese companies that are a must buy before earnings, for the same reasons are BIDU and MOMO. Like I said earlier, don't worry about Netflix here. They'll pop again before you know it. China has been in a bear market because of the trade war; however, the selloff in many of these companies is too extreme to last. Take advantage of it and happy investing."
Up then consolidates..Up again then consolidates..Up again the consolidates. This baby is going higher then higher then higher than high!!!
NFLX has been on fire almost as much as ROKU over the past month! What a beautiful partnership! 
if they can run up tesla and bitcoin are they going to run up netflix?

Sold this looks like a sell the news especially next week after MLK holiday
Streaming media stocks like NFLX & LIVX are very bullish with room to run 
Everything has dropped the last 3 hours today. It's been a bad 2 weeks for almost everything. Why would you expect Netflix to NOT following the same downward trajectory. Almost every stock has now given back it's previous daily gain.
Is it True that NetMuzxi is hiring Kap to work with Susan Rice and Obama in Project Get on Knees for IRAN???
The only hypothetical you should be wrestling with right now is “is NFLX” worth 300+ a share?”
"if you miss this chance, you'll regret it, soon over US$400!"
The stock has been on fire ever since Hastings said they plan on taking spending up quite a bit. It can only mean one thing. They continue to see very strong demand for their service.
sweet Goldman Sachs raise price Target for Netflix to 490$ by next year .....start buying guys
go NFLX keep growing
"Down 100$ from the high. I think the selling is about done. ok, I hope it's done"
"And here’s the sell off, yet again. Biggest regret of my life buying this before earnings"
"RBC — outperform rating, target price to $450 from $480“Q2 Subs came in materially light, due to a weak new content slate & some price hike pushback. The Subs miss wasn’t unprecedented, though the International miss magnitude was greater than normal. The Q3 &’19 Subs outlooks were strong, however. We believe the Long Thesis is intact, though we are incrementally less bullish. Price target reduced from $480 to $450. Maintain Outperform.”"
two negative days. 2 more to go. We will get 1 positive day. The best position is to stand on the sideline.
any news? what's been moving it up so much past 2 days?
"Sell in at 388, maybe it will tick to that point"
"Sell NFLX and buy ROKU! It's going to 1,000 in 2021!!!"
"Market will pop tomorrow on good earnings, led by google"
Something to be happy about. Yipee!!
$700 this year
New 52 week high by few minutes now...still Watching...dont leave to see an amazing short Squeeze
The fact NFLX stock has withstood all the trade fears and firing of COO this week and is still above $390 is pretty shocking to say the least... I think everyone can agree that if there was going to be a massive sell off it would have happened already. With that said where do we see this opening going at the start of the new Quarter next week?
no one stopping this now
"Down days are good after run ups. Trust me. Let the stock consolidate and find a new support level. Patience will reward you. In fact expect a few more dips as we head into earnings announcement. Bulk up before the earnings call, then the combination of the report and short covering will take us to the next level...probably north of 500. The company is still in hyper sub growth mode. DAW"
Don't buy into GS's bs. It is so funny to read that the street is trying to 'decouple' NFLX from the FANG and this stock is running purely on the new 'Brick box' release.
$GME $NFLX $CHTR $T over to $AMC Movie theatres to open in NY
Guidance will temper the enthusiasm. We're still in the peak of a pandemic. Got some headwinds on sub growth a couple quarters out.
"In a blink, NFLX up 8 points as it was doing yesterday!"
"Netflix is growing and adding content which costs money. CEO is brilliant. If shares dip more than a couple percent today I am ""definitely"" loading up."
$410 by Sept 6!
Grats to anyone who sold this stock. You will regret it after this month...
Bird box I was awesome. Unfortunately NFLX is going bankrupt creating such content

Deutsche Bank wants cheap shares before Monday. Says NFLX will miss subscriber growth. Nice try.
I told you it was a buy at $500.00Now look it's up over $59.00
Revenue is up only 40%. Lol
Netflix is 100% safer than usd dollar- this is the safe stock
pop after earning
Nothing happening before next ER
Oh my god I love Netflix
$500.00 is coming to a movie near you
Analyst would be revising their price targets upwards with the huge subscriber growth. Nextflix global market still has much room to grow. I myself subcribed to Netfix in March last year when the pandemic striked and continue to see myself as a subcriber even after the pandemic.
Netflix has a good business model however profitability is highly elusive and competition is heating up. The closest analogy I recall is when Netscape was the dominant web browser until Microsoft came out and offered IE free. Things didn't end overnight for Netscape but in time IE won the war. Same thing is happening with competition from AT&T and Disney. Netflix could be bought out but only at a much lower price. Think about it.
Upgrades before earnings are scary as always
It's just FOMO there will be plenty of profit taking tomorrow. It's near all time high. Literally no sellers after hours so they're all waiting until the opening bell when the spread is lower. 1000 share bids on the ask and 5 shares on the sell says it all. It will test VWAP then carry on tomorrow.
NFLX 375 tomorrow
Gottal love those analysts: upgrade after the stock has made a 35% move in two weeks and is up already 22% YTD.
All these shorts bad mouthing NFLX is hilarious!! All they say is how this will be down big tomorrow or go to $500 lol. Don’t forget people this was at $545 a week and a half ago without earnings!!! This will hit all time high tomorrow no worries lmao!
Best day since last Wednesday. Last time we had a HIGH of double digitsWe need the Friday slump to end tomorrow.Last green Friday was oct. 12Only one is the last 9.Can this be the start of something good?
Big money today!!! I called this perfect!!!
380+ in 2 weeks. Mark my words!!
Nothing but a tech rout. Haven’t seen it this bad ever. Not even 2008 was this bad for tech.
I think the only way it will go up is if they are integrating online gaming onto the platform.I don't see the catalyst for it to go up more. More catalysts for it to drop actually.
Can someone on this board please tell me why NFLX stock price will still rise after earnings release even though its valuation is in another stratosphere? Profit taking will be significant regardless of earnings/guidance.
Congratulations. I just pushed up the premarket price by $2/share. You're welcome.
Why is this down. No more upgrades ??
"look at these shorties in here,scared to death it will scream tomorrow, trying everything tonight to cast a bunch of fear"
Need new compelling original content that simple
I love Netflix
When market turns south; these stocks with shaky EPS will be hit hardest: NFLX/ROKU/AMZN/AYX/MDB/.....
What does everyone expect tomorrow after the bell? If you trade on wishes and hoping please don’t comment. Looking for real info from bears and bulls. Thanks
Netflix has to be undervalued. It continues to make new highs while the market has been in a correction for most of 2018.
Copy and paste: $AMC CEO and $NFLX $GME major announcement at 3pm here with us at the studio !!! https://twitter.com/cnbc_mark/status/1357710529763147782
Bad move by Netflix to relate anyway to politics. I like netflix but I just cancelled by subscription.
"Since the beginning of the year, NFLX 2019 EPS estimates have been tumbling from 4.06 to 3.42 while cash burn estimates has shot up to $3 billion/year. Large media companies with tons of content and much better capitalized have announced entering the streaming business and pulling their content from NFLX. Netflix's business model seems as shaky as it ever was, and loaded with debt with spiraling costs and interest rates makes it financial situation highly risky. Yet despite all this, the stock is up 42% YTD, trading at 120 P/E and $160 billion market cap! This is very much a disaster waiting to happen, just like the dotcom crash of the early 2000's."
Celebration Tonight...
Looking forward to merger Monday. NFLX is a takeout candidate at these levels. $450 - $500.00.
"Caution on Netflix shares, the party's over guys.""International competitive intensity is increasing, while pricing power is limited in high growth and especially competitive middle-income markets like India,"" says analyst Matthew Harrigan. ""As TV goes all- IP delivery globally and Netflix soon loses much outside content it will have to increasingly differentiate itself through in-house production as its user experience advantage erodes,""https://seekingalpha.com/news/3370214-caution-netflix-ahead-earnings"
People got scared and sold last week. Must be crying now.
EOD low will be visited again and surpassed.
"Up day on big volume, don’t sell"
"According to co founder this morning, Netflix has enough new material already completed to get them thru August. Can't say that for the other networks and streamers."
"RBC predicts 30% upside, source CNBC"
TIMBERRRR the Shorts.
Analysts will need to bump earnings estimates up for this year and next year. Open the gates and let the momentum investors in.
Wow what a miss
8% options implied. So plus or minus $30
Before earnings last quarter the stock was 400 on the day of the report. These 330s a gift I accept!
My calls paid off 
option expiration day ; traders and hedgefund guys driving it down to close out their accounts ; what do you expect
Could Netflix actually end on a high note today!! No 3pm decline!?! Woohoo!
"Netflix will have a blowout earnings report, should be around 440 after that."
Doesn't anyone care that NFLX is selling at a P.E. of over 250? That certainly doesn't leave much margin of error. I hope people are only using play money for this.
Recently sold all my Netflix shares because this stock can correct all the way to 150; this period reminds me of 1999 where stocks like Cisco and sun Microsystems disappeared and investors lost 90 percent of their money
The Only Thing Netflix Investors Have to Fear Is Fear Itself
Ha to 600 she goes !!!
Realize that the Masters of the Universe are simply waiting for opportune moments when they can count on short-covering to do virtually all of the heavy lifting - and do so with relatively small outlays of cash.
HP coming to netflix in Sept!
No better stock out there.
"Although I am long for the short term, I do believe they will miss the ""Expected Subscriber Growth"" this quarter. Many people signed up in the 4th quarter for the holidays. It had nothing to do with the content. The street has missed this. Just my opinion."
"To quote Chic Anderson, race announcer of the 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown. Secretariat (Netflix) is ""running like a tremendous machine"". This stock could down in history in a similar way as Big Red."
And....
Strongly green for tomorrow...
"Shorts, it is too late to cover now, you should have listen to me half hour ago."
NFLX priced to perfection. Any miss or even not beating expectations is going to be a huge drop.
Morning folks looks very promising today. Love netflix no problems with me have fun
"if they license their stuffs, why do i need Netflix ?"
Netflix is 10 years ahead in internet video distribution. There is nothing impeding them from reaching 1 billion subscribers.
Great earnings!! And stock is down!! Why it’s going down?

"Look at all the buys before the bell closed today, huge numbers! We're going up again early tomorrow morning."

Im hoping to get back at my buy in so I can sell out of this market. 2018 is not looking good and Trump doesn't make it any better. They may trap us for quite a while down here.
Look at max and 5 year chart... Last 2 years market almost flat yet Netflix up over 200%. Sorry but odds are dropping to around 220.
ZERO upside to this market. People are just buying for the sake of buying and they are going to get crushed.
"There it goes up again. Those big banks and investors bought yesterday. Made a big profit today. Sold high and hired people to convince everybody that this stock is no good. Negative reports, spam on forums. It went from 10% up, where they sold. To 3,5%. And now they buy back. Watch my words friends. I would do it to if i had a billion to spend by the way."

"Year Of Birth: 1994Year Of Demise: 2007Ceo: Jim BarksdaleFounded By: Jim Clark & Marc AndreessenIt's not hyperbole to say Netscape was one of the most important companies in the history of the Internet. The computer services company is credited with developing JavaScript and had an incredibly rewarding IPO as its stock soared from $28 to more than $75 on the first day of trading. At its peak, Netscape Navigator's market share was over 90-percent. November 24, 1998 would prove to be the turning point in the company's history as AOL announced it would acquire Netscape for over $4 billion. Some saw it simply as a play by AOL to unshackle itself from Microsoft (AOL's browser was based on Internet Explorer). Updates began to slow and the browser began to shed users. By 2003, Time Warner had disbanded Netscape, laid-off the programmers, and removed the logo from its building."
Expect more than 10 million subscribers... Maybe 12 this last quarter.
"I bought Netflix, it went down 17%. I bought Apple, it went down 8%. I sold. It went back up. I bought Comcast, it went down 18%. I sold. It went up. I bought att. It went down 18%. I bought Facebook, it went down 9%. I sold. It went up. I never made a profit. I’m going to reassess Netflix, see if I can salvage anything, if not in the next few months, then I will sell. Withdraw all my money and quit my failing streak. This is a big blow. It shows I know nothing."
Good job If you bought planning to this

Will it be back to $400 today?
"Through 375, many shorts stepping out. Hope it goes on like this. 380 is the next hurdle i hope."
"Debtflix is a bull market phenomenon. When the credit cycle turns, Debtflix will no longer be able to finance itself with junk bonds. Buyer beware. Debtflix has no cash relative to its deep-pocketed competitors like Disney, Comcast, Apple, Amazon, Google/YouTube, etc. Frantic borrowing just to stay in the game is an unsustainable strategy."
NFLX WILL BE IN THE 200'S AFTER EARNINGS..... BOOK IT
OK up 7.12% in 3 days and 6 billion in market cap. I was surprised it kept going up today. It's clearly tired here and I expect a small pullback tomorrow. Maybe finish around 204.35 going into the weekend. I look forward to another volatile day with this.
I believe Nflx can easily increase their monthly rate to at least $20 a month. The cost to see 1 movie in the theaters like Mudbound far exceeds what one pays for Nflx service. In fact I pay $50 a month for Hbo and I get practically nothing.
"Someone just bought my remaining share over 563... I'm out, good luck everyone!"
NFLX next 3 month revenue per subscriber = $31.1 (8% higher). Reason Most of subscriber yet to see price increase.They somehow hide this detail and market celebrating too fast I think.
Can’t even close at 525 when the market up 300 plus points. Very disappointing move today.
"I am thinking about buying today , what do you think?"
360 tomorrow ?
"Netflix price target raised to $750 from $660 at Pivotal ResearchPivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $750 from $660 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company last night reported a ""nicely better than expected"" Q4 subscriber and financial results, conservative Q1 subscriber guidance and better than expected Q1 financial forecast, Wlodarczak tells investors in a research note. Further, management officially confirmed they no longer need outside capital to fund their business, and raised their 2021 free cash flow forecast to flat from negative $1B, adds the analyst. He expects Netflix will continue to demonstrate pricing power ""as the service remains a relative entertainment value for best in class entertainment."""
Listen closely...Price targets are meaningless. Determining fair value on a price tag via retail investors and traders are just based on what everyone is willing to pay for that equity. Cult following here WILL weaken soon. That’s a guarantee! This IS extremely overvalued at these price tags. Take it fwiw...VA
"man I have to tell you, just when you think you're about to make up some ground, this stock starts to sell off. We are definitely in for the long haul. NFLX is officially a day trading stock. They are selling on any kind of jump."
$132B Market Cap. PE 200+ and they have to finance $1.5B debt? Red flags all over the place. When a company like this is operating a light speed and cannot pay off debt from over inflated stock valuation - run and run fast.

Still trading at 265 p/e. P/E = 50 is more appropriate and thats where this wall street scam stock will be. Just look at how much money this company is burning each quarter. Debt is going up big time. Yea keep funding free users with debt and let wall street manipulators keep upgrading because number of users are increasing but nobody talks about billions of new debt being added every year. This Dot Com II bubble will go bonker big time anytime soon now.

"If you value Netflix strictly by its ability to make money by subscription only then your not looking at the big picture. Netflix is in the midst of a transformation. This company just like it did when it switch to streaming is again transforming into a media company. You can see from the steady stream of media talent it has acquired and property location it has purchased. The ramp up in Netflix original movies is not just for its subscription business, it is part of a larger business transformational strategy. The cost of making movies for Netflix is going to go down further as they become more of a movie studio than a streaming company."

"This reminds me of the early days of $NFLX.Yes I got into $NFLX, after it’s IPO.While reflecting back I got in at $8 per share- about a 10point drop, after its IPO.It’s EPS we’re still in the RED, but it’s CHURN RATE (money a Co. spends to attract new customers) was going lower and it was expanding and everyone in Boston was talking about its convenience.By the next QTRLY EPS, and following QTR EPS, -trading up and sideways - it kept revealing lower QTRLY EPS losses, lowered Churn rate, increased sales, and Quarterly EPS, improved and well once $NFLX, began to receive more and more upgrades and beat Analysts EPS, it shot up and up.Unfortunately, My broker had put a sell order in to sell 1/2 my position at $125. My shares were sold and within a week or 2 it was nearly $200+ and announced a split and again skyrocketed. My remaining shares were sold at $201."

Netflix valuation is always too low because it is compared to companies with much less growth potential.
Now price target hikes will come in next 2 weeks. it is going 650+. Hold it.
Love Netflix but this growth rate is unsustainable
Will be 375 to 400 in a month
Upgrade is coming

SHORT SQUEEZE DONE SELL CHEAP
"I've done extensive analysis on this. Pie charts, line charts, astrology charts, tea leaves, Ouija board. What they tell me is that Netflix will make a run at $600 in March. I'm looking at $590-$600 and possibly even $610-$620. Then it'll pull back to under $600 again before the ER in April."

"LONGS! We have to hold the $300 level! We need to come together and BUY today to defend this crucial psychological level. The stocks HIGH for 2017 was only 200, and we could easily revisit that level if this slips back into the $200s. Don't let it happen! BUY!"

There is NO reason why NFLX traded higher on Friday It obvious that once it’s start falling it will go way down who is behind this
"We've got back $84 from Dec 26.....another $80 and, we're back at $400.00 per share"
"Netflix has huge upside, I won't be surprised if it closes over 450 by the end of next week."
"Wow, at this rate NFLX will be worth $3,240/share by the end of the year! And why not."
you can't honestly look at nflx with everything that is is facing and expect it to keep going up. i think that both longs and shorts can agree that nflx is a solid company. the question is multiple compression. it is normal for a company to retract 20-30% after such a huge run and particularly when its prospects are slowing slightly. Where would a -20% to -30% adjustment bring us? think about that.
This cannot fall as almost all funds in the world owns this.
Just bought another 350 Shares at$370.41
...pretty amazing...50% in just a few weeks....I'm tempted to sell with the idea of buying it back at a better price. Stocks just don't move up this much without correcting...
"Yeeey , tomorrow is a great day..."
Netflix will turn green before market makes it
So tempted to get more here.
"Well, it went up roughly $80.00 on good subscription news, and lost $50.00 of that, on NO news. Granted the market is down, but ROKU seems to be doing just fine, up over $10.00"

I don't think NFLX goes higher until it comes down again. Folks probably missed the last ride and are finding it hard to buy here like me. I'm short until I get hurt a little or it trades down to a level I like. I'd buy at back at 308

Hear me out... shouldn’t Netflix Buy Game of Thrones... milk it for more money on Netflix with spin-offs. After some time when Netflix makes a bit load more money they can open up a theme park and they have really good stuff in their portfolio... in this case (GOT). Stranger things... and other Netflix hits could be rides and experiences in the parks. Netflix Food originals? Boom restaurants and shops.... the amount of money they could make on parks is huge in the future. Thoughts
Why is this still dropping?!

Cuaron said “Roma” may have gotten more exposure than if he had chosen a traditional distributor."

"I'm long on Netflix, bought at the beginning of the recession in 2008. Ok to buy on the dip, had several dips/corrections in the last several weeks. But Netflix has a lot of headroom, even with new competition, with more content creation and new markets in China and India, and more shows in Spanish. So buy and hold, even if it is a bit over valued now. Price doubled over last year so some correction is expected."
"A nice little after hours recovery, I hope this is indicative of things to come leading up to the earnings call."
Not quite the 360 I was hoping for but on our way... 380 by Friday
if we get to 650 then 700 is around corner and they should split 7-1. I don't believe this has ever split correct?
This is right time to load more..
The fundamentals that Netflix has are incredible ..........The unstoppable train
"Nflx new contents will spend a lot of cash. New contents will last for a month. Nflx needs to borrow more money for new contents. The cycles will continue until profits will not be enough to pay for interests of the loans. The current business model will not sustain over the long run. Nflx needs more products beside streaming movies. AMZN used to sell books only, and couldn't survive by selling books. AMZN has multi-products today"
"By comparison, this stock is pitiful! In a 3 month period ROKU has gained 85%, while this dog has dumped 7%."

"Netflix investors are getting skittish.

A reverse of just the last 15 weeks of gains would mean a stock price collapse of almost 40%.6) Already down 10% in just the last two trading days7) About to breach the $300 level to the downside8) Already priced as the 33rd largest company in AmericaYIKES!

Lots of volume after hours. Over 1.5 million shares just with blocks over 10k in 35 minutes.

"I watched a few things on Netflix over the weekend. They offered subtitles in at least 15 different languages. They had a good movie subtitled in Korean, I watched a standup comic from Morocco, the one that followed was another stand-up comedian from another country and the entire standup was subtitled (I only watched the trailer, but the translation wasn't lost in the comedy), watched a biopic and a streaming series. In short, Netflix is blowing up internationally."

What’s a better buy? Fb or Nflx?
HBO still bigger than Netflix on Pay TV and Hulu catching up quickly on Domestic.Hulu added 3 million in just 3 month and reach 20M+ compare to Netflix 55M.With recent partnership with Spot they going to get even more subscriber this 3 month.Now People can sure keep multiple subscription but when they paying for multiple they will think about rotating soon and when that start Netflix will have hard time keep 55M subscriber even.
Massive short covering can be expected coming next Monday and Tuesday. IMHO
"I'm new to investing, yesterday I learned a very important lesson about setting a stop loss"
Excellent!
Hulu was just valued at $15 billion. Thats a problem for Netflix's valuation which stands at a staggering $165 billion including net debt. That is roughly 11x the valuation of Hulu.
Bought 275 sold 302
congrats to all the longs today. Even Apple went up.
Netflix to 250

who buys this stock at this price and waits till 2020 for a bounce Netflix needs to go down to 220 than you can look at it
If this baby closed under 278 then we are good for at least another 30-35 points on the down side.imo
If you guys think it's over priced now. Price is all relative to supply. NFLX leader again.
"Trend is ur friend, Short Short Short"
"Looks like this is going to $330 today. Likely $350 by end of the week and then $400 before earnings release. After that, I would expect at least $500 by end of April. That would give it a market cap of $216 billion. Seems like $700 by the end of the year is doable if they can continue to beat on subs."

SPLIT COMMING
$FUBO buying now it’s like buying $NFLX first 2 years IPO I was in heavy trading many times pre split in the $1s to $2 levels. Some Ppl got way so scared back then when Netflix was losing money but the growths #s was real same thing $FUBO today. I always got in selloff.
"Netflix purchased the entire billboard advertising agency, not just advertising space:Netflix, already a heavy advertiser on billboards in the area, was offering $300 million in April to acquire Los Angeles-based Regency Outdoor Advertising, Reuters previously reported."

"When market green, this will take off."
In only 10 shares at 332 lol don't have that kind of money
"PATIENCE PAYS!!! we started shorting NFLX when above $330, covered at 300...then waited for 280 to break..we got two $10 runs already before today (279 to 289), then again today another $10 run. Day Trader Josh's swing system is spot on people. Gotta check him out....his system is perfect for the volatility in 2018...make no mistake, the volatility is not going anywhere, anytime soon. Swing trading is best strategy in 2018..gotta lock in profits! SwingTrade101com"
wait til it reaches the 50 day moving average around 348 before buying. It always bounces off from there when it pulls back.
Monster Miss!
"Today I sold me Netflix shares with minor losses. I’m afraid this company is done. There will be more and more pressure from other streaming services (incl $AMZN, $DIS, $AAPL, $HULU, $GOOGL and other service). $NFLX is burning a lot of cash and the only strength they have is the number of subscribers which will decrease with the increase of competition/alternatives. More, today (the next day after Disney released their new streaming cheap service with great library!), Netflix announced increase of price [face palm]- I got an email. Last but not least, mostly, Netflix’s library of content is garbage - I have nothing to watch there. So, I do not see bright future for this company, but good luck to all those who are long here"
"El Camino, The Irishman, The Witcher this Q vs BM Bandersnatch, The Birdbox, Haunting of Hill House in the same Q last year. Last year they added 8.8 million subscribers in Q4. They should add more than that this Q with a stronger slate of new shows."
Netflix expected to quit burning cash. Cash flow positive going forward.
"More/higher PTs after earnings. This is a stock you hold not trade. Same thing happened with Amazon 4yrs ago. Missed out at 270, now it’s 1750."
"Explain how this, which traded down to 338 yesterday on an Upgrade, all of a sudden, just move straight up 14 points on nothing"
Time to buy
I am hoping for a strong push back up to the day's high by the closing bell today.
"BTIG Rich Greenfield repeated his Buy recommendation on Netflix (ticker: NFLX) shares and lifted his price target to $630 from “a very stale” $375.Greenfield notes that he picked up coverage of the company in October 2019, when there were growing fears about competition from Disney+, Apple TV+,AT&T ’s HBO Max, and Comcast ’s Peacock. “Netflix not only shrugged off competition, the Covid-19 pandemic has pulled forward industry change, breaking the theatrical business just as Netflix’s theatrical investments are starting to bear fruit,” he writes in a post on the Lightshed website.Greenfield offers a list of six reasons to own Netflix shares:Unprecedented industry scale: He thinks the company will reach over 300 million subscribers by 2023 and over 400 million in 2026. Greenfield thinks that will translate to over $70 billion in revenue by 2026, with Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins in the rante of 35% to 40%.Accelerating cord-cutting: Greenfield says that while the addition of new streaming services has not hurt Netflix, it has dinged the cable and satellite TV businesses. “Outside of sports, legacy media companies are essentially telling consumers that there is no reason to subscribe to multichannel television anymore,” he writes. “It’s over. Multichannel video subscriber declines rose from low-single digits in early 2019 to mid-single digits by late 2019 and will end 2020 in the high-single digits.”Covid has accelerated industry transformation: “With so little fresh content on TV and without sports for several months, consumer adoption of streaming hit warp speed. Once consumer behavior shifts, it is very hard to shift it back, especially when the “experience” of streaming TV is so far superior to linear live TV,” he writes.Studios unwilling to shift film economic models: Most major studios are unwilling to shift to a streaming-first model, he notes. And Greenfield finds that puzzling. He notes that Walt Disney (DIS) had a huge hit streaming Hamilton, but the pay-per-view model adopted for Mulan has been a “financial failure.” That miss, along with the weak reception for the theatrical release of the Christopher Nolan film Tenet, has major studios delaying major releases until summer 2021 or later, while shifting smaller budget films to streaming services. In contrast, he points out that Netflix has a hit in the newly released film Enola Holmes, and has 18 or more movies lined up for October release. Greenfield writes: “As consumers begin to appreciate the steady stream of high quality films on Netflix at no additional cost, it makes Hollywood’s [pay per view] ambitions even harder to achieve and it likely means that theatrical attendance will never rebound to prior levels whenever the pandemic is behind us. The longer Hollywood studios remain focused on the sequential release pattern for movies that starts with theatrical, the more it advantages Netflix.”Competition lacks global ambition: “When we look at the major streaming competition, we see limited interest in having global subscriber scale, let alone producing local content all around the world that can be utilized by all subscribers,” he writes. “Netflix’s global content scale increasingly feels like even larger strategic advantage than its domestic programming spending.”Feature animation at Disney scale: “Netflix has been investing aggressively in animation for the past couple of years, but the animated feature lead time means the output is just beginning ...The first Netflix animated feature film that feels Disney-like is Over the Moon, which will be released next month ...It remains far too early to judge Netflix’s animation strength, but in success it could meaningfully increase the value perception of a Netflix subscription and make it even harder for families to cancel their subscriptions.”"
662 i sell half then rid the rest
"37 million new subscribers to end the year. Shares up by 48% over the past 12 months, that led to its revenue rising to $25 billion. The No. 1 streaming service company definitely not slowing down.And because of the pandemic, we saw a big shift to streaming, making an opportunity for growth and a more healthy and intensified competition between other streaming giants. https://zyne.com/stock/NFLX"

"Does anyone consider how much more appealing the content of Netflix is to international subscribers than Disney or any of the competition? Personally, i could care less about a few popular American movies when I can choose so many good ones you probably have never heard of on Netflix and many were aimed for the non-usa audience. Does anyone realize that Netflix could put content in theatres too, or use advertising in a limited way to augment income?"
Day trading this stock wasn’t the best idea was it fellas?(;
TECH IS DONE! going to 300 by friday
I wish Yahoo had a way to sum up all of our posts at the end of the year. Some of these guys who shorted NFLX and then freaked out on these boards would be mortified to reread their posts at the end of the year. Or 5 years later. What are you thinking?
"Netflix has come this far, and surely it will go farther from here. Intermittent pullbacks are normal even from Jan 2018 up to the present. Trust Netflix. Just hold on your stocks. The best things will come for those who wait."
In for $305.82 . Come on after hour 
"I bought Netflix just now at 496$. Hopefully, It will go up till next week. I believe in Netflix and I am confident about it. Go Netflix !!!!!"
Thinking this report is going to be similar to ROKU's announcement 2 weeks of more subscribers. It's Winter/Christmas season and Smart TV's sales were excellent. NFLX will announce more subscriber growth in this report.
"I love the service, but this P.E. is absolutely ridiculous. I would rather buy Apple and sleep at night."
$450 here we come
"Netflix will be up soon dw,3 percent increase tommorow!!!!!"
"NFLX is looking like the new AAPL in stock ownership. October, 2012 it was 50.00 than it went to 700.00, split 7 for 1 and know it's 322.00 so that makes it worth 2254.00 a share now and don't see any competition either. Certainly not Amazon."
sorry after hours $488
subscribers ran when Susan Rice went on the board and the company annc. a deal with the obamas.
I hope the fact that Netflix is huge in Europe will surprise everyone and today’s earnings report. Stay long stay strong!
"Major timber tomorrow, another 9%!"
"sold a few days ago, i watch movies for free on putlocker"
I wrote two weeks ego and predicted NFLX $280.00. It is time to buy it.
"If there was a ""13 reasons why"" for the adult world. IQ and Netflix would be all of those reasons. Annnnnnd being a democrat too."
Need volume
bye shorts
Should i sell for 500 dollar on friday or wait for it to become 600 next month?
The GDP of the US runs at a rate of $19 trillion per year. Think about that when you add up the market cap of some of the larger companies.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/01/11/netflix-shares-are-popping-after-multiple-upgrades-bullish-commentary-from-wall-street.html
remember the promise monitory mask first hundred days. shut down soon grab a blanket watch a movie.
"What do you guys think? Is it time to sell and cash in? It is a way overextended rally in no time! I'm up $50M since December 2018. I'm going to cash in EOD anyway but, Your sincere thoughts are welcomed. $NFLX $AMZN $AAPL $AMD $NVDA $CSCO $SQ $SHOP"
"Why are Netflix bonds officially rated (and priced) as ""junk bonds""? What does this mean for the stock price? The other FAANGs have much better credit ratings and don't have to issue junk bonds. What's different about Netflix?"
What about this warrants a PE 10x higher than DIS? This company is so overvalued it would need to double earnings every year for several years to even start justifying this valuation.
337+ by close of day.
Disney in talks to buy Netflix
if things are so great why isn’t it up more
"The Same lying Analysts at $230 told you to SELL it was headed to $150, the very same People are tell you you must Buy way up here"
Big guys manipulate NFLX today to scroop shares: hold it tight;don't let these big guys get your cheap NFLX shares:NFLX hit $1000 in three months!
yup weak stomach's selling BaaàaaHaa Dems going to shut down again. this going to the moon.
Any bets on NFLX being up over $600 tomorrow?
Subscriber growth will blow past the most exuberant estimates!
Great job Netflix kneel. To the king
Should of bought it at a bargain. 380.00
Go green
I just bought with NFLX. Watch it go down.
"REVELATION 3:11 Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown."
"The demand for TV, online games, e-commerce, social networks, health TV, and online education increased significantly during the quarantine. Only in the first quarter, $Netflix increased 16m new users in the US -- about double the number in the previous quarter. Italians also increased their time spent on Facebook apps by 70 percent. After 2020, there will be significant growth in the upstream video data stream from the Internet of Things. AR holographic services are expected to generate massive demand between 2020 and 2025."
"Netflix's 'Bright' reached 11M viewers in its first three days, according to Nielsen"
"Trump says an impeachment inquiry will ""crash markets."" Does that bode ill for NFLX? On the bright side, if NFLX falls far enough, it might become a possible buy out candidate."
This will revisit $360’s a few times before earnings.
This move is all about pricing power. The last time they blew away subscriber estimates after raising prices the stock ran from 185 to 423.
Who’s buying tomorrow!
Sell now
"417 - when Shorts capitulate Yes, its worth $125 but in this bubble with endless price target increases anything is possible.Have Fun"
NFLX will be up at least $20 tomorrow. We'll close between 388-395 !!
patience is key.. Netflix will reach $500. No one else has a brand like them and content like them . Overall great company and is very profitable and is expanding rapidly internationally. Long Netflix.
When someone mentions NFLX competition.
"hunch:sells offtime to get in is now (sell or short)why, because the price is apt to go to $130 per share (see a long term chart)and so, a lot of money is to be made in the early goingbut, $420 was the top, but $130 is about half where it is, so its still easy moneyOnce it gets to $200 it may pop highercould pop here, thoughbasis:5.2 times the PE of Disney$276/5.2 = $53 per sharebased on that aloneone might expect some selling at some point, PE normalizationand then the cost of content is up 30% in one yearthen the competition is everywhereZacks noted the low barrier to getting into the streaming business and a $165 price target"
As soon as one country puts a tariff on Netflix then the stock is toast. I'm surprised that Soros isn't shorting NFLX while working on some government to impose tariff. Does anybody really think that foreign governments are going to sit around and watch $10 a month be sent to the US by their citizens?
"Put it to you like this. HBO is valued at 30 billion with 130 million subscribers. Nflx, has 118 million subs, doesn’t charge as much and spends 100x as much on content and has a valuation of 140 billion. Stay long if you’re long but you could lose your shirt if you’re a buyer at these prices"
"I like Netflix and Roku and $WIMI, they always do well, more and more people are using their products."
"The reality is the deal does not create Netflix, some way to go regarding penetration, analytics, commissioning and growth. Disney has blockbuster content but no real offering to customers today or in the near future!"
"At Thanksgiving everyone wants to say ""I sold my nflx at $420. Who would admit to missing that window?"
Hugh buying blocks. Someone knows something big gains 375
Fair value $450
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/15/apple-launch-video-streaming-service-rival-netflix-2018-csi-insight.html
"Nice 100k+ pop $$$ today. Keep on shorting, people. Thank you for making this a wild ride."
bought 20k @$350
Keep holding!!! Been holding since 240$
"I can't believe with all this market volatility and where nflx started this morning at -$12.00 in reds, now no one is commenting how it's holding its own. Everyone i'm sure was expecting worse!"
"ATDS could soon be the security software , protecting user information this and many other tech companies... Just saying."
another buy opportunity!! loading up!
Still holding.
God have some mercy on us Friday.
What is this about AMZN ER having effect on Netflix stock prices? Do you watch Netflix while ordering online on Amazon? Or do you put Netflix on hold while rush out to front door to pick up amazon delivery? If you do any of these activities multitasking then there is nothing to worry about either one!
Should Amazon just cancel and ban Netflix so they would have more customers on their own platform.
i'm usually sympathetic but not the way folks piled into this one.
I’m short again at 303
Hope for a $20.00 gain tomorrow it could happen within first hour. Let’s go BULLS keep buying and put pressure on the bears
This sell off is the biggest lol today:DDD
Sell ASAP at open $355 or less
"Didn't like the afternoon selloff, but ending up $3 on a day when all of the major averages were noticeably down is still pretty good. I agree with some of the other posts - tomorrow we'll probably drop a few dollars early, then slowly rise throughout the day to finish somewhere in the mid-370s."
350 will always be a cheap price for netflix. i will remind you again when its at 450....
the will try to close 350 but the market and buffet push to 370
"One of most long time bull analyst downgrade Netflix after reaching 325 target. This is big deal because analyst keep upping stock price just to not go against trend or fuel into rally. Yet when analyst upped price target this move $10-$15 on up but now when downgrade which is huge change, it only go down $4. This is how bad wall street gone. Normally when long time bull analyst downgrade stock drop big and hardly any effect when they increase price target."
Market hoping NFLX earnings will reverse the market correction. God help us all.
I'm selling as soon as it reaches $1500 a share.
"Streaming is the future for a long time. The pie/market share will continue to expand and isn’t limited at all. Competitors welcome, won’t matter. Should be $400 as of today."
let's hope for a brighter week next week and thereafter
it good time to buy
Big crash coming
Today easy $40.00 pop. This going to run so fast up that the banks aren’t going to have time to get in at a low price. Buy early I LOVE NETFLIX
"Matthew Harrigan reiterated sell rating, he has sell rating on NFLX since it was 300, his client would have made lot of money if he went long at 300."
Not even the Enterprise can keep up with this stock. Great show by the way. Season 2 ep 1 on Netflix today.
"it was under 307 on may 3its may 1613 days, including two weekends (4 days)so 9 trading days 307 (less) to 329.723.8 points aboutmaybe the peak was a lower low, so we go to 300 the 100 dma?"

Can only be valued this high if people don't work.
"Buy as much as you can premarket, it will be down like today. It is like walking into equity. Apple's misfortunes are temporary/product cycle and has nothing to do with economy. A lot of people who bought IPhone X last year (2017) did not upgrade. Netflix's monthly fee is very reasonable and can withstand economic downturn. Disney+ and Time Warner streaming is not a threat to Netflix, I for one will subscribe to Disney+, the other service will complement Netflix and it will take 8-12 year for Disney+ and Time Warner catch up."
Netflix has the lowest cost per subscriber and don’t take Ad money and can still spend 10 times what it’s closest competitor is spending. It’s like Usain Bolt gets a 1 Mile head start in a race and his competitors are saying they will catch up with him. No chance. Just noise when views are expressed about Apple or Disney catching them any time in the near future. Netflix is very sticky and addictive.
"Sugar, we’re going up."
"After hours obviously looks great but after being burned, I don't trust after hours or premarket. I've see stocks go berserk at the opening bell"
"A community organizer has a show on NFLX, how ?"
"when news came that some resolution of trade with eu was imminent the smart traders sold INTO the rally. this market is NOT a buy it is strong sell...it is not how much growth USA has, it is why are not salaries going up? if corporate profits were sustainable AND debt was under control, salaries would rise...this is why stocks are falling and will continue weakening....what will precipitate a total market collapse will be a fed raising rates into the instability you see in the market today...growth is weak and problematic elsewhere in other countries...you buy at your own risk, it takes years to recover stock losses."
OMG OMG..maybe tomorrow NFLX will open at $130 because someone (1 guy) decided to short the stock. OMG he is a god.
??? Why is CFO leaving?
Seems like an awful lot of bulls in here going into earnings for a stock down $100 from its highs
Anybody else heard rumor that Netflix is planning on bundling MoviePass into their subscription?
Market manipulation to burn calls for tomorrow.
400 by close >)
430 pt GS
So does NFLX interest continue to rise to fund their negative free cash flow?
Could we possibly get an Upgrade tomorrow or price target increase/reiteration? would be nice...
"Just follow the analysts who pump NFLX - they were never wrong... ever. They have it all figured out in their spreadsheets so while Netflix is burning $2 billion per year, the spreadsheets guarantee a huge return!"
pre market just moving wow great for people like me under 332
Millions without jobs and they have increased the monthly fee! I don’t know guys! This could ended up really bad after hours .... just saying!
"Upgrades this morning, fasten your seatbelts the rocket ship is going to be a bit rocky"
told you $210 by Friday!
"Six days up in a row, top of bollinger band, time to short again"
everything is factored in already?
Goldman conviction list AKA - stock going down
looks like a technical bearish double top.
Bought a few shares in AH yesterday at 345 and change. Just sold for 379 and change. Not a bad percentage gain for an 18 hour hold (I'm here to tell ya)!!!
should buy more now?
"So if they give away a billion free subscriptions and show 1000% “subscription growth” (lol) at the expense of zero margin and losses then the stock will shoot up 100x fold in one day, correct? Is this what people are chasing??? They missed eps by a mile because of that (just gave free or cheap subs) yet showed a “subscriber beat” so called and now added 20 BILLION to their market cap based on that?? Makes total sense in this incredible market bubble of course...keep on buying!!!"

Earnings Pre-announcement ??
"NETFLIX CEO: ""WE ARE LOSING IN THE COMPETITION AGAINST DISNEY+"""
"I am fairly new to options trading. Bought $340 Jul 20 puts yesterday. How can I get a rough estimate of where the puts will be trading post market open? Options follow the black scholes model, which I am familiar with but not too knowledgeable about (I know about delta, gamma, theta, and vega just not the mathematical calculations behind them). How would I go about mathematically getting a rough estimate of where the options should theoretically trade at market open, assuming they will open at the pre-market price (which will of course change as soon as the market opens)."
"Just got our go ahead to SHORT nflx today from Day Trader Josh. Shorting from 359.50, cover at 339.50 ($20 run). PLEASE NO LONG-TERM investors need respond, just hold you will be fine...although, you make way more on this beast stock if you sell long potions, then SHORT, after every new major break out and then buy back at lower levels after your cover swings. We are up over 400 points on logged profits since we started training nflx 3 years ago, way more in profits when swing trading, both LONG&SHORT."
"Thanks longs, I appreciated all that short money I made this morning. Keep holding the bag for me."
I'm looking for 545-560 strike ahead of earnings. not a huge move 5-7% by the 19th.
This is not the beginning of some sort of recovery. This is an opportunity to eject and save losing a fortune
"So even though I've owned 200 shares since $80, yesterday for once I finally signed up for Netflix. You're welcome for the pop!"
"If you're destin to own this stock through earnings with a target price of 365.00 check out the buying the jan 25th calls for 7.75 one contract will cost u 780,00 includes the commision. 1 contract equals 1,000 shares of NFLX stock. Much less risk if your objective is a great earnings call since you can only lose your 780.00 original buy price if out of the money however, if it doesn't crash you still have a time value. My point is don't end up paying 33k on 100 shares of stock you will lose way more than 800.00 if it turns against you. I tried to explain as simple as I could that trading options is fun with much less risk and NOT hard as long as you have a plan. GL"
380 today here we go bulls
Folks it’s only 3 percent relax
Competition Has lower prices.
I can't imagine Disney+ will be good news for Netflix. Strange that they aren't launching until late 2019 though. I suppose that is good news at least?
"2/7/18- ING BUYS NFLX SHARES-Can there be much more upside in Netflix after a 55% gain in 2017? Apparently yes, as, stranger things have certainly happened. ING has made a tentative investment in the streaming service by buying 4,200 shares in the fourth quarter. Shares have already soared nearly 40% so far in 2018, given a boost by reporting earnings that topped even heightened expectations."
I will start a short position soon..
FANG have been over pumped for so long!
"You all can buy now. I sold my shares, which is a market indicator that it will rise."
The one thing that the NFLX shorts seem to have in common is no personal responsibility of any kind. Their losses are all somebody else's fault.
"Trying to put this into perspective, NFLX misses subscription estimate drops over $40.00, while on the other hand Boeing posts biggest loss in a decade and goes down $3.80. Again, something very wrong here.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-boeing-results/max-jetliner-grounding-crisis-pushes-boeing-to-biggest-ever-loss-idUSKCN1UJ1G9"
"DIS down NFLX up in AH says it all ! NFLX will pop big tomorrow, both overhang, Apple and Disney out of the way now."
Sell and come over to ROKU
I got a 5 feb 530 call! Sell Tomorrow or still hold? Thanks in advance
"$NIO $NFLX $WIMI $ZM Stock market bear in mind that it is not good to hold a short-term mentality to win fast money, long - term investment first have the opportunity to win money in the stock market"
Up 44 percent since December 24th. Up 103 points. And still room to run up to the all time high 423. Earnings report and guidance will blast NFLX up. Award winning product. Superior subscriber growth. A+++++++
goldman Sachs upgraded nflx with a 720 pt. Many are leaving hollywood for netflix.
Consensus is building that the stock would trade above 400 in 12 months as more and more analysts raise subscriber growth projections.
Sold at $248. Great move but this is as good as it gets.
added to my short
Is NFLX down because DIS up and is presumably is taking market share from NFLX.
get ready for the market reversal in the next 45 minutes. stop loss in place.
Need more Susan Rice
WOW Subscribers must be falling because everyone in Turkey can't pay for Netflix subscription.
buying more ... way way way oversold.
"$NFLX sellers come on over to $DIS! The water is warm, the dividend is good, and the fundamentals are strong... Rogue One is going to be HUGE!!!"
 bears
THIS IS NOT WAR... ITS JUST A SINGLE BOMBING AND STATEMENT. Stop magnifying every single headline.
NFLX has not corrected at all today. The market has but not NFLX.
This price increase just confirms that this quarter was good. Why would nflx raise rates on a miss? To loose even more subscribers because lets face it there will be cheap ones who will btch about the $2 increase. I expect a 1 million sub loss due to increase but that will clear the path for future.
$550 coming up
Is is still worth buying in right now ? Or wait for a dip?!
The stock chart is telling us loud and clear that TV watchers will always choose the service that gives them more for their money.
One day we'll be saying NFLX was 408/share! Best advice is too buy long and hold for a couple years when it's well over 1000
Yesterday's sugar high wearing off. As expected.
Thumbs up if you think this is going up after earnings or thumbs down if you think it’ll dip. Vote now!
364 by wednesday. About to break out
This market wants to rip 12% higher...... Netflix will lead the charge.
I don't know if anyone noticing but I do notice that retail buying is not as much as those manipulator expected even after so much push by their media friends and Analyst friends. I really hope they end up very badly because such manipulation is never healthy for stock market.
Hello! Come join us! Plenty of room for growth!
"After seeing the combo of a bullish engulfing pattern along with a sharp move off the 50% retracement yesterday, today is no surprise at all. This stock has shown it can go up with frightening momentum. Shorts cover while you can."
its not stable plus 50 tomorrow I've seen this before going to 650
"Yes, it's not as high as most would have liked, but it's still going to be up on a ""down"" day. If tomorrow is an ""up"" day, Netflix should be pulled up further."
"a stock is not supposed to go 43 points above the 50 dmaespecially with the growing debt on their booksPE 283revenue grew at 40% from year to year (annual) -> 3.5 times a PE o 80353/3.5 = ~ $100 per shareand we haven't seen the competition effects, they have the toughest competition: apple, FB, AMZN, Goog, ....Comcast, DIS ...."
"Anyone read the WSJ today? India is going to curb growth of US tech firms in their country. They are going to follow the China model. Bad news for NFLX since that is an expected major growth area. I know this board doesn't like facts but this is real. From the article, ""The proposed rules, which have emerged in recent weeks in a series of private, draft government policies, have U.S. tech companies concerned, according to people familiar with the matter. American firms are betting billions on the Indian market because, unlike China’s, it has been relatively open to foreign competitors. That might be about to change.“It is unprecedented and it needs to be taken very seriously,” said Vinay Kesari, a Bangalore-based technology lawyer specializing in regulatory matters who has worked with U.S. tech firms. “It could have huge implications.”"
Who is buying?
SELL $NFLX SCAM! Netflix BUBBLE WILL COLLAPSE by 60%!
There’s rotation out of fanny ex Apple. Not surprising. People can make money in other sectors at the moment.
"With Netflix we know it takes 30B revenue a year to become FCF positive. HBO Max, Hulu, Peacock, Paramount+ will never reach 30B. Disney+ and Amazon prime have an outside chance."
"RBC has it right when it comes to Netflix with $450 price target. And it is his top name with best risk reward.His case rest on:-> horrible sentiment on Netflix (worst he can recall), so good setup-> people thinking they are going to miss subs, but his channel checks doenst suggest that-> accelerating cord cutting that's happening -> Netflix being big/main beneficiary-> lots of room to grow.(early innings) They currently have 150m - 160 m subscribers.there are 3 billion smartphones, and in long run 2 billion of those he views as netflixs potential. If you look 10 years out Netflix will be 5 times the company it is today-> netflix has scale advantage, spend more on content, have better brand name in streaming, better globally distributed, and better partnerships"
so why is this deserving of 220 so fast?
Nice close...shorts better cover Monday....which will become a buy to close order and propel NFLX even higher. Longs will prevail Monday evening and Tuesday morning. $340.00 minimum after earnings release.
Rev. $6.64 billion versus $6.63 billion and expected Earnings per share: $1.19 versus $1.36 expected
Another great buying opportunity.
There you go ... Brexit vote turmoil hitting stock market
"NFLX will crush the shorts again next quarter. It is an unstoppable freight train that will continue to grow at least for another 50 years. Cash flows and debt are irrelevant. They can borrow unlimited amounts of money at very low interest rates.I predict $300 by April, $1000 by next year, abs probably $10,000 in a couple of years."
"Wait, stocks can go down??"
Sorry for those who got fooled prior to xmas and sold out or shorted. Time to short will arrive soon but wait a little more.
Shorts must cover
Not a great product anyways. You pay 3-4 months of NFLX you’ve seen everything. Many streaming services have overlapping content. Streaming services are pushing people back to cable.
"Best Drama series go to NFLX at Emmy's award... Last time , Nflx won oscar and stock jumped 6%"
Excellent +$16 AH trading. +$36 by tomorrow. Congratulations my long friends!
699 by summer
bubble always bursts
"Netflix finally admitted the obvious when it reported third-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, though: At least in the short term, the arrival of a slew of new services from companies like Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.06% and Walt Disney Co. DIS, +0.25% is going to hurt its new-subscriber growth. The company expects that subscriber growth will decline year-over-year in the usually strong fourth quarter and for the entire year, even with a strong slate of new shows."
Dumped at $272. Absolutely crazy action and I had a target of $268 by next week but when we blew through that had to re-think. Couldn't pass up an $80/share gain in a few weeks. I will be back on this one. Good luck to longs. This has been the biggest 3 week gain I've ever had. Thank you NFLX.
"Today was due to Golden Globe.... Weeks later , Oscar is coming.... Hahahahaha.. Another rally.. Then earning... Oh god... I will be rich"
after hours :: schmafter hours
Goldman Sachs always tell the truth. Very honest bank. Trust them!
$350 coming
"Hey, just came of work and seeing a nice green day sofar :) No idea why other then it went down a lot while content and subscription numbers grew."
570 BY TOMORROW PROMISE U SHORT SQUEEZE
I've been saying it for months. This had to happen. 800 is next stop.
Fun facts - number of movie tickets sold in India is 2x the number of movie tickets sold in US. The total box office revenue in Asia Pacific is 1.5x the box office revenue in US & Canada. Those markets are huge and streaming services are in nascent stages. Huge upside potential for NFLX if they play their cards right. They do have one advantage - they are a leader in US and investments they make in creating international content helps them grow internationally and helps strengthen their base in US even further.
shorted at $202.
https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/netflix-gains-as-credit-suisse-ups-q4-subs-forecast-primary-driver-for-shares-14831264
How do you Buy a short position. I have never shorted but it's time to learn this looks prime for it. Pretty sure this is going to tank...
Netflix doesnt actually have a P/E multiple. They have no real earnings.
ROKU beat earnings! NFLX will without a doubt reach 525-530 tomorrow
Don’t get left out on the way up this week...
If it goes over 357.30 it will be a new high for the month and highest since July 27.
"So all the cheer leading over the weekend might have created this artificial move higher. And the cheer leading includes the white house. Its really hard to trust at this point. What to do here is the question? I feel like this should be much higher as well , perhaps fund managers are dumping into strength. We will see, meanwhile finger on the trigger to sell. If we are in a bear market then share prices will be brought lower during earnings for many techs, regardless of the numbers. Just my 2 cents."
There was a famous investor...I don't recall his name...way back when...he was asked how he achieved superior returns in the market. He said he wouldn't invest in something unless it could move wildly in either direction. That if it couldn't go down 20 percent just as easily as up 60...he wouldn't touch it. Nflx is one of those. High risk high reward. Z
I need to see a moonshot to 380 today to be happy
NFLX reached a new All Time High at 304.20
Anyone who thinks it’s going higher neck than day or 2 knows nothing about trading
"On DIS balance sheet find where they value ""content,"" then compare it with NFLX ""content."" DIS has prixar, disney children's movies, stat wars, marvel, lions gate?, etc. Whose ""content' looks overvalued? This ""content"" cost is amortized over time and makes up nflx's largest expense. So by slow walking the amortization you make the company look more profitable. What does nflx have in content that would total $9B in value?"
Lots of folks still stuck in using old models to think about new companies. TSLA is a good example of why old models don't work. AMZN took years to turn profitable. NFLX is no exception. Can't use what worked for GE on the new economy. Plus GE is half dead in case you are not following the news.
will close in redfyi i am long
"What are the odds these guys say they will launch AVOD? Man, my Roku would love that"
Call sellers got to be crying.
I really can’t stop watching Netflix really don’t care for other companies.
"India has over 1 billion people, all wanting Netflix!"
"Folks the PE is still up around 170, down from around 250. It needs to fall by a factor of 10 for this to be fairly valued!"
It's all normal...intraday profit taking...lot of traders. Z
"Hello everyone! if by chance you have time and desire to discover a mini Netflix that already collaborates with NFLX I suggest you put in your watchlist CIDM very under rated stock with great potential now below 2$. The company's recent moves have resulted in near zero debt and great expansion. Some of the company's digital content partners include: 20th Century Fox, Disney, DreamWorks, Lionsgate, Paramount, Sony, Universal, Warner Brothers, Weinstein and hundreds of independent distributors around the worldp.s. sorry for my English"
Where my Shorts at ? New Closing High on NFLX all time high open Monday you are now all under water in your shorts cover quick I need 310 next month
"They should makes a movie about Netflix. We could call it ""The Day the Bubble Burst"" Remake you say?"
that was an absolute gift
i think this stock will go beyond $500.00
Tariffs are bullish. The removal of tariffs is bullish.
Randolph taking a shot at Apple for “buying” subscribers and DIS for their copycat practices. I have Netflix and watch it often. Guess they are counting me as a “paid” subscriber? Only reason I have it is Comcast threw it in to my package while cutting my monthly rate....
Who knew? 233 to 357 in about 15 trading days. Wall Street. Timing.
If we stay above $400 we a definitely going higher
"If you are a shareholder, you can sell covered calls at any strike price for any time frame depending on your cash flow needs, risk tolerance and time horizon.If stock is taken; so what!You made 20%. At close, NFLX Jan 20 $400 calls sold for $88 tax deferred cash per share This is a stres free way of investing."
Woo hoo! It's a great day to be in Netflix land.
Any buying is met and overwhelmed with quick selling.
It seems I made huge mistake being on wrong side of the trade when it got dropped to $336. I shorted with my big savings at $338 and since then this never came back. I knew DIS has yet time and also NFLX was on pressure for few months and that it could bounce any time. I got trapped badly. Not sure when this will return but I’m scared now... 
"Everyone think Netflix susbcription will raise as they make more netflix orignal and so their lead increase.Simple question:-How many total Episode on Netflix Orignal Drama they produced in last 5 years:- Answer will surprise you. It's only 400. (There are B Grade Movies and Commedy shows and Marvel Orignal exclusive (Likely pulled out in 2019) l which I am not counting).In other word, if I start watNow how many shows Disney already have:- Probably 4000+. How much content Disney/Fox will generate $15B orignal.Disney also have 1000's movies. So if you have to choose between Disney or Netflix service which one will you go with? I think answer is very obvious.Netflix will continue license external content but that also mean it limit it's own and number above may not improve much.2019 coming fast and smart likely going to run before that. All this analyst pumping may be way to exit without stock price crash."

Hello.. Need genuine advice. I bought 100 @390 for long-term investment. Since then it is just sinking. Should I sell or is there any chance it would go up? Thanks
"Why SENS will dominate DEXCOM AND ABBOTT CGM in 3 to 5 years!CGM market is still in infancy. DXCOM, Abbott, Medtronic and Roche only grabbed <10% of CGM market today; the total number of possible diabetics who needs this device are enormous. More and more insurance companies are buying into importance of CGM capabilities in reducing medical complications. The total costs related to diabetes costs just in America annually is Hundreds of billions of dollars each year. It’s much cheaper for insurance companies to pay upfront fees to get CGM implanted then pay for treatments for leg amputations, diabetes blindness, end stage kidney failures, cardiac complications secondary to untreated diabetes. There are many more conditions causing billions of dollars in Medicare due to uncontrolled diabetes. CGM device is literally life savers for millions of people around the world. Currently there is vast untapped markets for both internal and external CGMs in India, China, Middle East, Far East, South America. CGM growth will be exponential over the next decades. Lastly, Medicare will be paying Providers almost twice more to implant Eversense CGM then Dexcom CGM. Main reasons for this? It cheaper in the long run to implant Eversense CGM. Dexcom requires very expensive external sensors changing out every 7 to 10 days. Eversense CGM, no sensor change needed during lifetime of Eversense implant. Great bargain compare to Dexcom G6 or Abbott Libre"
"Hold on to your shares , $20 plus move up is coming tomorrow."
This needs to correct to about 240.
"people: whatever we do/say/buy/sell here it will not affect the stock price, as we only represent 1.74% of the total investors... only the institutional investors can move the price as they please"
Goldman Sachs reporting Netflix will spend 12 to 13 billion on content for 2018 instead of the 7.5 to 8 billion Netflix guided for. If this is the case it means subscriber growth is coming in much higher than expected.
is this the beginning of our run into earnings?
I hope u shorts enjoy your .47 percent cause going up a few more percent tomorrow! lol
375 by next week
Today Netflix will be above 564$ probably 580$ or even more. Lots of good news. It is considered a safe play after it beat the estimates.
just short 50 shares of nflx. 
Good luck tomorrow ladies and gents
whoever said $20 up today...you were pretty close buddy!
"Good premarket movement, it’ll be back up to 400+ early morning."
We ditched NFLX in big numbers!Just check out your nextdoor Conversation
time to buy when others run hard and fast.lets wait for the big buying but nibbling can be done.
"I guess the high PE is scaring some investors due to what they say is nose bleed. Well I guess my AMZN was that way too at one time. But look what happened.Just #$%$ a major investor said years ago, buy what you like and others do as well, and invest in it. Well for me that meets the requirements for investing in Netflix. If I had to pay $15 a month I'd still use it.No politics, If I care not to watch them, and the greatest thing! No f,,,,ng commercials!!We do have cable for my wife by the way since she likes to watch her stuff. For me, I haven't watch nothing but Netflix for two years.I'll give a prediction. I think there is a good chance that Netflix will double their subscription base in 2-3 yearsWhy? because everyone I know has it and loves it>"
"Mahaney @ RBC just on CNBC reiterating his $480 PT. Multiple upgrades this morning. If not today, big moves to the upside will occur in the coming weeks after the dust settles."
Who owns the content delivery network? Netflix Who built their own Hollywood? NetflixWho is forming relationships with top level producers? NetflixWho is the king? Netflix
"short have been accumulating in names like fb,nfln,twtr,snap and others for the past 6 weeks. one problem for influx shorts is that the price momentum stalled and it isn't dropping. pain is to the upside and its not about mkt cap its about where traders can separate the most amount of money from investors. nflx is going to trade back to $380-390 in the next 6 weeks and come earnings they could pull a tsla and be back over $400."
holy. congrats to all shorts
See all you shorts at 330 friday
Bird Box was a lot of fun to watch. Finished House of Cards in two days. Netflix has quality production far better than major networks and rival HBO lineup.
"How can Netflix stay up at least 180 points too high? Read the details, Hbo all series are quality, this is a game changer, they are trend setters!In year one, there will be 31 original series on HBO Max, growing to 50 series in 2021 (in addition to originals for legacy HBO), according to Kevin Reilly, chief content officer, HBO Max and president, TBS, TNT, and truTV. Underscoring HBO Max’s focus on “content that matters to viewers,” Reilly said the top 100 titles on streaming services drive half the total usage. Translation: HBO Max is focused on quality, not raw tonnage of content.As previously announced, HBO Max is getting its hands on the entire runs of “Friends,”“The Big Bang Theory,” “The West Wing” and “Pretty Little Liars,” among others; the entire Studio Ghibli film catalog; the full library of “Sesame Street” as well as the next five seasons; and CW dramas produced by Warner Bros. starting with the fall 2019 season (30 days prior to the TV premiere of the next seasons of the shows).HBO Max will have 1,800 movies at launch. In the first year, the film selection will include all the films in “The Matrix,” “The Hobbit” and “The Lord of the Rings” franchises as well as all titles in the last 10 years from DC Entertainment, including every Superman and Batman movie ever made. Recently released hit “Joker” starring Joaquin Phoenix will be available at launch.After the initial U.S. launch, AT&T will take HBO Max international — in 2021, it plans to debut localized versions of HBO Max in Latin America and Europe, according to Stankey.AT&T told investors Monday that it expects to spend $1.5 billion to $2 billion on HBO Max next year and invest a billion in each of the following two years, before hitting profitability in 2025.In 2021, WarnerMedia expects HBO Max to generate $1 billion in incremental revenue from the U.S. — over and above HBO — stepping up by a billion each year through 2025 to $5 billion. Those forecasts include ad revenue, expected to come in starting in 2021.It’s unclear how the so-called streaming wars will shake out, but Netflix investors in particular have been unnerved at the prospect of competition with content powerhouses like WarnerMedia, Disney and NBCUniversal. Some analysts believe it’s not a zero-sum game, with room for several big streamers to gain traction — likely at the expense of pay television."
These prices are not that low. just in may netlfix was trading at these prices. be patient and informed before you average down and to the people screaming buy the dip - show me the technicals causing you to do so because this thing has yet to bottom today.
First big close over the 50 DMA. Most funds wait to buy until a close over this technical signal. Upgrades and good earnings. This could be a nice run back to 400.
200 dollars at most!
"Come Tuesday, longs will get a fresh lemon squeeze"
wow......
Netflix stock price target raised by $100 to $465 at Raymond James in latest bullish notehttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/netflix-stock-price-target-raised-by-100-to-465-at-raymond-james-in-latest-bullish-note-2018-06-21?yptr=yahoo
Is this a bubble? I'm thinking it's heyday is past.
i FEEL PRETTY EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOW AND I'm only dealing with a 10K account. I can only imagine what people with 10 times my amount go through.. Unbelievable.
They can't afford a 110 dollar total fee for netflix for a year...but they want you to know they know something about something trading for 1 share at 3X that price. if it wasnt so sad..be funny. Z
"I said this on Monday. We would get about 4 negative days this week and 1 positive day. This is not the type of market to hold your money in over night. 2018 is much harder to make money. If you make a 5% or 10% gain in a day, you better sale in order to keep your money"
"After Thursday, on a positive earnings report that meets or exceeds expectations, expect $400.00+"
"When would this recover? 1-2 years? I am long since it’s peak around 390 and wonder if it’s time to limit loses and move on or let it be. If good earnings and subscription growth did not move this stock up, what will?"
Wow very happy that I kept my 2 shares. 
"If there is trade deal on Monday, we will see 320."
How about split 1:5?
"NFLX is one of the companies which does not have many competition. Even if one wants to buy other platforms a study shows they too have NFLX. The customers and families throughout the world have adapted NFLX into their daily or weekly routine. This will double in the years to come. Its has a buy rating by many analysis. I too know this will have a ""20% gain at least"" within 2 years."
"Sell Netflix, Buy Viacom CBS!!"
strong finish.700 by friday
Up 12 dollars pre market!! Happy hunting today fellow longs. A moment of silence for shorts please..
every one who bought last and this week will sell after earnings.. 400 then sell to 300 again
Better sell at the open!!! Will slide all day
We watch friends and office because it’s on Netflix. Not gonna join other services only for these shows..but the dip
Sell
The move of NFLX seems some are confirmed that APPLE will buy it at $300.
The Queen’s Gambit is an unexpected big hit. It should help Netflix beat subscriber expectations and show pricing power.
I just overheard good news for tomorrow they going to blow out the numbers all time. 450.00
I can already feel another short squeeze after AMAZON reports earning today after the bell :-)
I’m still hopeful that we will see 600+ this week
I would not be surprised to see this up 4-5% today after the nice analyst notes this morning. Short covering could really drive this higher.
"Buying more, thanks to I"
hoping for more analyst Target price cuts so this thing keeps going up
CIDM and DLPN are NETFLIX's up and coming competition so!!! I would jump on before they rocket to the size of this company both companies have been buying other businesses left and right
lets hope Monday is a good day and the rest of the week is great.
I was long for the earnings pop but if it doesn't make new high I'm short.
"Buy the way up $2.5 in AH, NO WAY THIS STOCK IS GOING DOWN TOMORROW"
"So, it's just as likely NFLX reports a blowout quarter that gives one more boost to the share price going into the 2019. It all depends on their guidance, and how open they plan to be. Apple got hit in January when they guided down but the stock has since recovered 80% from the pre-announcement price (155 vs 158). So, maybe NFLX thinks they can guide people to the punch bowl for a bit longer before the reality sets in."
WE'RE RIGHT AT THE 50 DAY SMA. ONCE IT BREAKS THROUGH THERE IS NO RESISTANCE!
450 next week plz
Goldman Sachs is angling for the lead underwriting role in the next capital raise by Netflix. Cash on the balance sheet will drop below $2 billion when NFLX reports on Jan 17. NFLX will need to raise more capital to fund another $3 billion in cash losses in 2019.
Hopefully to see another 2-3% up today!
Doing great Netflix. .Thank you all. You’re the best. You’ve proven this last year there’s always room at the top. For (one) player. The best will always be there.
Im bullish.. Netflix is the benchmark in the streaming market and too big to fail. There are still high growth possibilities plus profits will rise exponentially
Why in the hell they have Just PUMPED $NFLX BUBBLE by $10 Per share in 7 seconds???How the hell is that possible????
Obama is now running the show. Not doing so well.
After earnings report yesterday they already got around 40.000 new paying members!
I sold my remaining shares around $520. My take is we all know Netflix is doing great and will likely post a great quarter. The problem is their outlook will be compared against 2020. While I think 2021 will be a strong year for nflx I think people will focus on comparisons to 2020 sub adds. I’m guessing it probably sells off on earnings. If it does so I will look to get back In.
Everything is gonna be alright
"At this price and Disney price, It take over Disney in valuation. Unbelievable market and incompetence analyst who just know to add fuel.Why am I complaining. I am actually very happy because at this price it's almost risk free to short as long as I can control my greed, I will make solid profit on this.So my special thanks to trend follower and analysts."
buy nflx
I will buy around 283 for the bounce.
We need another upgrade from any banks!
"While good Quarter, I am sure everyone going to ignore but marketing cost is keep going higher.it raise from 271,270 to 479,222. that's 76% raise. This clearly mean company is spending lot more just to keep stock price inflated. I think company need to finance negative cash flow so those marketing cost is justified because that way they can keep getting better rating and more interest in debt."
does anyone know how much people pay to subscribe to Netflix in India?
"I cancelled NetflixThere is no cost to cancel. You can always start it back up in the future. That's what will happen, but revenue and earnings will drop because of itWSJ survey30% of netflix users will cancel to try the new streaming companiesweekend paper, check page 1 (or B1) and B6"
wow! volume at 55 million! impressive!
I am happy with this trade today. It recoveries all my lost from TSLA and NKLA last year.
$360 opening tom morning
Ain’t scared...I’m a sport guy and I find myself on Netflix everyday
WOW! WHAT AN AMAZING DISCOUNT TODAY ON THOSE AUGUST 21st $500 CALLS! CONGRATS TO DIP BUYERS!
I have a feeling I’m gonna regret waiting for a correction....
IT WILL HIT 570 TONIGHT
"Overall good earning but I am not impressed with Earning. While It's nice they beating subscriber number, it come at much higher cost. Balance sheet isn't in great shape.Here is thing I like.1.> Subscriber grow by another 7.2M while I like, everyone expected this.2.> revenue per Subscriber raise little bit.Thing I don't like1.> Marketing cost raising much faster nearly 71% year over year. Even higher than Q4 last year. 2.> Revenue per subscriber raise is lower when you compare history and recent price hike. Without hike it was going 1.5%-2% up as people subscriber higher quality plans. With Raise last Quarter with most not raised until near end of year, it's up only 4.8%.3.> Content spend is getting crazy. I think If they hit unexpected peak for subscriber, Those content cost very hard to pay for. I think level of sharing is unknown but if it's higher than 50%, I think it might even paused early next year. 4.> With Disney and Apple going to enter, Risk of subscriber growth stall is even higher."
"Uh oh.... late day buying, insiders know something :)"
Disney is 2 months from pulling content from NFLX. Walmart will take a chunk of subscribers of middle and lower incomes from NFLX when service is announced. The hot air balloon  is about to pop!
"$TSLA $NVDA $FB $NFLX , these are heavy volumes on the downside. Pretty scary."
So. high. .Wait for better price.
Predicting the daily rise and fall of a stock with the same probability as flipping a coin $AMZN $WIMI $NFLX
what is netflix? i got amazon video and apple tv for free.
Many mutual funds will buy more tomorrow.
how high do you guys really think this name can go?
Did i say i bought 100 shares at 358 and predicted it would go up in the last few hours? :))))))))))
Here we go.... Nice Beat!
Looking very positive into the earnings tomorrow easy 425.00 start picking up shares and let’s ride the wave into 500.00
Boys Netflix is going green tomorrow!!!! Great company with a lot of potential....
why the sell off.. ??? there is no news out??
"If the stock did not crash with a poor earnings report, can you imagine where it would be with a excellent Q3 earnings! My guess is 600."
"every year this happens - everybody hates NFLX and then when it drops to below 260; people back up to truck to a run to 360+. it is all gibberish about the other streaming stuff; NFLX thrives on its own content and competition from other services will have no impact on the growth of NFLX. people are not going to give up or take dis, hulu, etc. over NFLX. they will simply be additions to NFLX. This stock is about to be a screaming buy opportunity very very soon."
I just went short 200 shares at $337. This one is bloated folks.
"Where are all the 1000 share holders today? 56,590 Bucks one day loss is big and it did not even trade on the open market yet."
"Netflix is going to have to lower prices for *US* custoemrs as well. Here is waht Disney owns:Disney (Mickey Mouse, Snow White, The Jungle Book, Bambi, Peter Pan, Frozen, etc.), Marvel (The Avengers, The X-Men, etc.), Pixar (Toy Story, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, etc.), LucasFIlms(Star Wars, Indiana Jones, etc.), 20th Century Fox (Titanic, Avatar, etc.),Miramax (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc.)Withot access to that library, NFLX is going to lose subscribers. The Star Wars and Marvel movies will drive away a lot of Millenails, and then familes will go to Disney to entertain their kids. NFLX will not recover.Also, Disney now owns 2/3s of Hulu, so they have Disney+ for familes and Hulu for those that adults that aren't intereested in aniamted flicks."
So the stock is 100 points down because they guessed new users wrong!!
The money is flowing out from Netflix to other sectors. It is about time. NFLX is dangerously expansive. Defense sector should be a safer investment
Sell it folks
I would not buy anything until things come back in under 50 or 100 day. The market is going to sell off through earnings season. Last Q was peak for most.
I wonder if Netflix is cooking their books?
FB sell off will definitely bring down Netflix but where do investors put that money. I can see IQ starting a run here
"NFLX $210. Target announced: By Trey Williams, MarketWatchNetflix's valuation is the elephant in the roomInvestors shouldn't worry about Netflix's rapacious spending -- but should be concerned about its ability to grow overseas, say analysts who started coverage of the streaming company on Tuesday.Analysts at Evercore initiated their coverage of Netflix Inc. with an in-line rating and a $210 12-month price target, which represents a roughly 14% premium to current trading levels.Lead analysts Vijay Jayant and Anthony DiClemente wrote in a note to investors that there are a lot of aspects of Netflix's story that are no longer debated. Internet TV is here to stay and the growth runway is massive. Within that, they wrote, Netflix (NFLX) has a huge head start.""The platform has reached near ubiquity with the help of an effective original content strategy, and a global mass market has emerged with streaming becoming the consumer's preferred way to consume video content,"" Jayant and DiClemente wrote"
an upgrade came in folks this might be a good day for us who knows
570 BY TOMORROW
"Every other streaming platform will run out of steam subsidizing their small number of shows, and the monster Netflix will be a winner as usual. 350 inevitable so watch u after earnings shorties. We will see u cry like babies soon on the other side. Netflix rocks. This price action is a blip and a must buy opportunity"
LETS GET BACK TO EVEN
what can go wrong ?
"Let me see if i can get lucky at the end again. Bought 40 @ 336,57."
Hopefully yesterday proved to be a good BUY opportunity.
$345 day after earning report.
Normal 2-3 day drop then $50-100 surge after good earnings call. Look at past blow outs
"For Q1, NFLX is projecting 6.35M subscriber adds. LOL. That's what they had for last quarter too, and they came in at 8.3M. Let me guess here. I predict they come in at 8.3million for the quarter, and the stock explodes up 8% on the news."
Even if it had 300million subscribers that would only be just 3 billion revenue a month... price just doesn’t make sense
"Still over 3x overvalued, a fair price might be around $100."
It’s Looking to make 370.00 today. Today she will rise.
It is clear to me that NFLX will rise past $400 in a few days...Asian growth not even factored in the numbers yet...wow
Oh....up some more....time to take some profits before giving it all back or even worse....become negative
Someone lend me money so I can buy a whole truck load. This going back to 400.00 soon.
"Disney planning big, will be in every country. Baba going big too, will be international"
And just bought 10 more $520 call options for tomorrow dirt cheap! bam!
"Trump, Economic Adviser Resigning.Tomorrow Market will Sell, Sell, SellThen... You Buy, Buy, Buy"
"5 weeks of going nowhere, upgrade after upgrade, finally breaking out"
"I don't know if its true. Someone in India, a higher up public official? seems to have said the 50 million subscribers is max for India, not 200 million.If so, NFLX seems likely to sell off. Another article seemed to point to Google's Youtube, Apple streaming, Amazon, and others having had time to become a force of resistance. Add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are NFLX has seen its high for quite some time. jmhoI like to back out and look at longer time periods. Seems to have a message. The 4 year chart has $130 for support. If it goes to the 313-315 range again (I forgot the low), it will be the third time, I'm thinking it breaks through to the downside then. 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesn't mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down. I just think it is likely. ................To me, they are losing money. Someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content, then they made in revenue. That's scrary, but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content. It seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition, before the competition made them irrelevant.You know one serious issue is that Apple and Amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores. That's a touch one for NFLX to work against. They have been quite creative though. Maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else. They could start selling things, compete agains Amazon and Apple, fight fire with fire. It's possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growing.I think they won't or it will be too little to late. Could be wrong.I'm thinking it tanks to $130 and soon.just a hunch based on information I have explained here"
I’ll sell a portion at $350
Why the raise 2 days before earnings ?Fishy ?
"Netflix is value for money. They have so much valuable data, great AI and negotiating power."
I am so glad I hold . Markets green and this will be$450 Friday
"What has the bigger upside in 2019, Netflix or Amazon?"
"Funny thing is, there isn’t that much shares short... so it’s not the squeeze. Just hype."
"just sold 1/3 at 331, hope I don't regret"
Should be green by EOD
"Great short term, but long term is difficult with original content when DIS and Warner leaves Netflix to start their own Netflix. "
are free subscriptions considered subscribers
what's happening?
"Hilarious that the most expensive stock in the most expensive market ever soared 10% after announcing cash flow projections for the year of NEGATIVE $3-4 BILLION. When this stock rolls over, it's going to roll over HARD."
Watch for this to crash like a rock once people realize Apple isn't gonna buy NFLX.
With all the suspense over subscriber growth heading into the ER we know it's by far the most important thing for Netflix. Then it also has to be the most important thing for Netflix's competitors. Netflix competitors don't have that much subscriber growth. So if Netflix adds 1 or 2 million more subscribers than expected then it makes sense the stock can gap up 10-20% and trade at a new all time high price to sales ratio because there are no competitors that are doing the same.
"My question to all the bashers, don’t you already have Netflix subscription? And if yes, did you cancel it after Disney announced theirs? I’m sure the answer to second question is no.Think about it before you bash!"
Take profits till it lasts
Here we guys the buying starts now. 380.00
Closing at 370.00 for the long weekend see you next week Tuesday. Let’s thanks ours troops for there hard work and dedication for there service. May God bless them all Thank you

Hello everyone BIG BANKS ARE GOING TO OPEN THERE WALLETS TODAY. THERE ARE GOING TO BUY BIG BLOCKS AND MOVE THE MARKET. $380.00 TODAY

Every FANG stock up significantly today except the one the crushed earnings. Something seriously wrong with that picture.

If you guys had to choose between roku or NFLX you’d choose?
"Buy don’t miss the golden eggs train, once it’s gone, you will be standing on waiting at Netflix never returning station haha"
AH isn't helping....
if you have nextflix you would know why it is doing so well..
Could Netflix split again??
Nice Try. Looks like it's going to about 420 before earnings and then we will have to see what they release
We are up to .04% in after market. Should be back to 420 by tomorrow
Money looks for places to grow...the ten year gives you below 3...Apple missing 10B in sales....margins decline...Amazon lowered its outlook(not growing as fast). Netflix is the beauty of them....Simple. Z
"Happy, Happy, Happy!!!!!"
With all their debt and now rising interest rates and completion you have to wonder why they are screaming for HELP by raising fees this is a big gamble on their part if you ask me since they had a bad experience in the past by doing the exact same thing only this one on a much larger scale.
FIFA should effect this stock this quarter
bought and sold 400 shares this morning for cool 8k!
"Disney has contents, deep pocket, diversity business, P/E RATIO 23, stock price below $150. NFlx has stock price >$300, P/E = 99, no diversify business, little original contents. It will head deeply South in a year"
"All the talk about Disney removing content from Netflix, does it fall under antitrust? Why can’t Disney license the shows out to anyone wants pay the fair price?? How is it legal to limit the circulation of contents?"
Almos 40% off its all-time high. Nothing has changed about NFLX specifically.
Ok guys.. 300 is very near.. we should break it and move past that by the end of the week!
Full Disclosure: Hulu only reduced the cost of their ad supported package. Charge less per month but increase the amount of ads. Great strategy until customers figure it out!
More democrats = potential for net neutrality = good for Netflix ? Is this driving the stock?

stock split!
up 27 today.
It's getting to expensive to buy for small investors. A 1-5 stocksplit would be welcome and boost the stock.
"After growth investors try everything else, they will all eventually come back to NFLX."

"obama in and I am out of netflix,"

short break here. Till next try to 390. If it breaks 390 its will be positive today !
Netflix does NOT self-produce that much orignal content: 87% of their current content was *licensed* according to their SEC filings.

"Every Friday before earnings has upgrades. If you bet your net worth on $330 calls at the open yesterday, you'd have a 1,000% gain in 24 hours"
I've sold all my $IPIX and bought$ $TSLA and $NFLX. These are the new paradigm stocks.
Hi it’s just got another upgrade to buy ILOVE IT GO NETFLIX 450 coming sooner then you think
"Netflix guided very conservative. That is what caused this to just fizzle out, after a 10%+ rise after hours. So, really... the fun might begin next earnings release. IMO the users gained will have a snowball effect. More people talking about shows, more people in on the pop culture, more traction more stick less churn. Overall, this pandemic has drastically changed the dynamics and sped up the shift to cut cables. A fun year to be long in Netflix."
Will Netflix hit a new 52 week high today?
This thing is ripping it in aftermarkets. Congrats to the longs.
when there is no buying stock falls. I think there is a small gap from 508 to 517 so I think ti will be covered and then it may stock to go up.
This time next week All time high
"Netflix is maybe worth $30 right now... Everyone living in this imaginary land where Netflix can keep growing as much as they want. Fact is they need cash to operate and grow which they don't have, last year before financing Netflix cash flow was negative 2 billion dollars, just losing more and more every year. Bonds funding this debt start maturing 2021, price of them is already dropping. Who would buy 10 year junk bonds from Netflix at 5.5% when 10 year treasury notes could be yielding 4% next year?They are going to have to up yield of the bonds they issue in hopes someone will buy them. But if they up the yield of the bonds it means they need to increase their profit margin which is already way below the rate they are paying on current bonds. They can't afford more expensive debt. Its irrelevant how many more subscribers they get or how great the shows are unless they start getting positive cash flow very soon.Fact is Netflix future is in their creditors hands, Netflix has no control. Why invest in a company that can't control its own destiny when there are positive cash flow growth companies like AMZN, GOOG or FB? Makes no sense to invest in Netflix when you have much better options out there. So many places to get just as much upside without the huge risk Netflix has. Maybe they pull a rabbit filled with cash out of their hat and make the business work but they can pop at any moment and then everything is gone...If you want to invest in hype just invest in Bitcoin more upside with less risk as Bitcoin doesn't have creditors lol."
"Small portion in @$398.45, too boring if just watching"
and back on track for one direction
You hire Susan Rice and Obama and look what happens.
"Today's action should be a warning and constant reminder to shorts that with nflx, they operate at a severe disadvantage and often are fuel for spikes higher. Even at $192, while there isn't a fundamental case that supports share price, there looks to be only 1 thing that can drive it lower; heavy, sustained selling."
"Before you jump and mute me right away. Hear me out, I am not here to spam but to bring exposure in a gently manner. Check out CIDM and do your own DD but they've just met compliance yesterday and are a major streaming play with more partners and a larger library than Netflix. I am in on Netflix myself but its worth checking out CIDM. GLTA."
Apple will buy Netflix early 2018!
I’m not going to try and understand why and just ride the wave.
Ha. I'm gonna make so much money after Netflix 3Q tomorrow! You all stay scared and keep selling.

I love bubbles. There will be a time to short but not even close yet.
This is starting to look like the same set up we got with micron technology. All analyst hyped up the stock and everyone got burned. I think the fix is in already. We may not get the jump like everyone is thinking. This does not look good. Big money may be shorting regardless of the ER report.
"NFLX was up 40,000% since 2002.IQ is up 100% since it’s IPO March 29, 2018 as a spin-off of the Internet search engine Baidu.Move to IQ."

Congrats to everyone that played earnings :)
All the good articles coming out now! here we freaking go!! Calls are going to print
JP Morgan analyst Douglas Anmuth / buy on Netflix. Raising target to 535 USG for 480 USD before.
Netflix will shake this off in this time next year be over 800
"YouTube to scale back it's production of scripted content starting in 2020 as it struggles to find top talent - Hollywood Reporter. For sure Google has the money to hire top talent but they face the same dilemma as other streaming services, how do you add subscribers to cover the cost of talent when they are heading over to Netflix at a clip of 30+ million a year."
An amazon prime membership which includes prime video is cheaper and provides superior value. I dropped Netflix for this reason.

"Man, when will people start listening to me. We all have a thing called ""The world wide web"" And people want good things at a good price. Now, I have been researching this sector for years and I am a subscriber to Netflix but I don't use it. Now the reason why will shock you? They have the same shows on their since I started service. Now, let me give you an anology. If you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it. Now, you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star Kevin Durant. You win the championship. Now, going back to Netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when Walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the Virtual Reality sector you will see why Netflix will not compete. They need to clean up their business or they will get squished by its competitors."
all hype endsthis is the top for Netflix back to 80
Obama and Susan Rice frantically working the phones. Need upgrades ASAP. Funds drop more money into the stock.
"NFLX will have to pay dividends to be competitive with Disney. you get value and growth and dividends with Disney. Sell NFLX, buy Disney."

"French fries with a fresh Belgian beer, tonight The Witcher, tomorrow El Camino, sunday afternoon Claus with some hot chocolate and pancackes, what a wonderfull start of the vacation. Enjoy the holidays Netflix lovers!"
I advise any long to book some profit today. Even after analyst pumping so much end of last week. It fail to hold 315+ that clearly mean big player selling before earning. This prove my theory that it's help that Analyst provide so Big player can exit with profit.Now slight only beat or slight miss can bring this stock to 250 easily. They have to beat big time in order to justify such inflated prices. Analyst and big player know that. There is very limited up side incase they beat big time but downside risk start even with slight beat.
"I'm sure Buffett is looking at loading up on NFLX, it's P/E is only around 254! He knows a good deal when he sees one. And has said he likes to buy at a reasonable price. Not for the wide moat too! Bars open, drinks are on the house."
NFLX already guided higher during their Q earnings cc.....ROKU guided lower...wouldnt that mean that that NFLX taking their business? Will be interesting what disney says
I got out before earnings but I’m glad for those who held on. So many nflx haters eating their crow tonight. I love the company. I just was worried stock might sell off on earnings but looking back you knew sub number would be good based on what they said about queens gambit.
maybe I did a mistake and sold everything at once.. looks like it will grow moreanyways that was the easiest 45k I have ever made
Another Fantastic week
Earning one week later...... I added 1000 more.
"I'm sick of this board, what's on Netflix? "
"Ok they got it now. On the lightest volume in 2 weeks they just took out yesterdays high. My guess is the 275 puts are now in sight. Disney, amazon, and Verizon all getting in the space-oh yeah-Apple. Everyone of these companies could buy nflx with just their cash on hand but somehow nflx is still trading at 90 times earnings and 6 times sales?"
Buy now another blast off is coming 
"Google trend data suggest Outlander season 1 and 2 has a bigger viewing audience on $NFLX than any season ever had on Starz. Does this draw Netflix subscribers to subscribe to Starz for season 3&4? If so probably not for more than a month before they cancel, but sure shows the importance of scale. LGF is more valuable apart of another network than on it's own, it's so obvious."
"I learned something with this trade, Buy when its completely beaten up and hold on strong,"
Congrats to all long friends! Patience always pays back. $400 is not coming soon enough.
"Gz on 300! I'm not in this stock anymore since $200 but I love the company, but 50% up in 2 months seems a bit too fast, I'm looking to get back in someday at the right time."
Selling at this moment will just loss more.
"If Amazon trade at same PE as Facebook, Stock world drop 80%-90%.Growth rate until recently Facebook has higher than Amazon. Market is very unfair with $FB and rest of stock market compare to $AMZN and $NFLX."
Lets keep going NFLX dont give up those gains!!!! Yesss!!
I don't have gut to buy NFLX at $391. I may get in at $325. My experience tells me loss/win ratio is 80/20 at current price. I will wait for the bubble bursting this week. At the current price I would rather buy Fb with much better valuation.
cramer would call nflx a buy once it reaches the moon. buy now at bargain
Stranger Things was responsible for a 14% boost in Eggo waffle sales LOL

"kudo's to all longs and shorts on this board. regardless of the quality of the posts, i find people are generally pretty civil here toward each other. quite refreshing to see. i also find this board highly entertaining. good luck to all."
"Have 943 shares, down a bit but still haven’t lost a blink of sleep, as professional trader, I know based on solid ground of Netflix will back up to $400+ in near future, for far future its $450+. Please don’t panic, it’s what Market does to stock when things are not certain."
"seems to be a trend. high of the day around 10am, then lower highs and lower lows."
Another over priced turd to short into the dirt.
Entire market was down today. Every day is not going to be green. Not worried at all. Full steam ahead to 500
This will head higher as people anticipate the higher revenue in q2. I’m guessing most subscribers stay on because it is very cheap. And they still have room to grow albeit not as fast as this quarter. The key will be content. Original programming is pretty strong. I do wish they had a more extensive movie library. But I know that it’s their original programming that sells.
What percentage of people on here making negative comments also subscribe to Netflix??
Disney has reached over 10M subscriptions since yesterday. That's why the drop.
"The whole tech sector has been squashed, not just NFLX. There is nothing wrong with the company, they beat last earnings and are continuing to grow. If you own, hold. If you don't own, BUY. Netflix is always exaggerated in it's movement, when the market goes back to an uptrend this will soar very quickly and erase the losses. The ONLY losers are those who sold their shares for a loss out of fear. Fear, makes some men poor, and others rich."
"AXXA, check out market cap vs revs. It's a diamond of a stock"
Two weeks before earnings. Nasdaq is up 300 plus points. This go up 9 dollars?? What happened?
Watching on the sidelines. Interesting show I must say
"Reed Hastings on DIS' new streaming service:""“I know I’ll be a subscriber of it, for my own personal watching,” Hastings said. ""In the end, Hastings asserted, all boats will rise with the streaming tide."" Guess Hastings doesn't agree with the pumper on here."
$420 to $265. I originally bought at $212 and watched it almost immediately go up to +$400. Sold $350. This down drop has been tough to watch.
Tremendous growth. Hundreds of millions of more subscribers to come. This stock is just getting started.
are they making adult x movies
50% in 10 days...This should continue and accelerate. Likely to acquire AAPL by end of quarter.
"The big drop comes after Disney pulls all its content from NFLX later this year and sets up its own $6.99 service. Amazon throws its streaming free with Prime. APPLE will not enter any business unless it is in the top 3, but it will likely bundle its movies. No company plans to make any money."
We need an upgrade! Soon!
Icahn sold his at around $50/share. If Buffet was lucky enough to buy when Icahn did he would still be holding. He said his favorite holding time is forever. Buy and hold is the best strategy my friends.
5 for 1 Split coming soon
"I know I missed the great run up in the stock the last few years, but I couldn’t resist any longer and bought in at $318. Hopefully Netflix will double by this time next year!Congrats to all the longs who have been in this stock the last few years!"
Robinhoodlums will pile in tomorrow. Let's go !

this will be green by lunchtime
$550 coming soon. You are not to late to load up! earnings are going to be fire!!!
$520 looks like a good entry point. I don't think you would lose money if you bought in the last couple days. But you would have to hold it for a while.
Every penny gained off the earnings report...gone.
Retails and big holders are getting antsy with the valuation and will start trimming position.
How much does Netflix need to spend a year before all of it's subscribers always have a short list of must see shows? If it's 25B and they can grow to 100B a year in revenue the difference of 75B a year would be mostly profit.
"NFLX will hit $300 soon, if market is not so panic for no-reason!"
Great buying opportunity. Optimism always prevails.
Netflix is up almost $100 since Hastings said they plan to take spending up quite a bit. Translation: they continue to see strong demand and will be raising prices this year.
Great week. I loaded up on NFLX and CGC monday. Runs are not over. CGC might putts around before popping again but NFLX clearly going to breakout big into earnings. Not sure about earnings itself but will run up to next week.
This is the quickest 60k i made AH
"Let's go ahead and split this thing now, 4:1"
"For the naysayers (and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see one):Netflix is a positive cash flow company, they are making money hand over fist. They currently owe more than they make, but as they gain subscribers (projected 200+ million by 2020) and pay the debt down NFLX will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet. Companies borrow money all the time, even blue chip companies, to invest in growth and infrastructure. FB borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive, so did Sirius XM and AMZN. The math is there, and it's simple, that's why the stock price is what it is, with 79%+ institutional investment. The institutional investment wouldn't be so high if the banks didn't see a golden goose. Shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 4-5% gain here or there, while us longs are already up over 100% on the year. I know what side I'd rather be on with this stock. The shorts are going to get burned and then cry that it's manipulation or some other nonsense. It's hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing, there is always the ""sky is falling"" types that cry doom and gloom. If they'd care to take a look at numbers, NFLX only has a 4.5% short interest on its share float. That's literally like saying 4.5 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term. That's extremely low. Most shorters don't have the stomach to watch a 5-10% rise above their short price, and they close with a loss; that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings, and we might get a nice little 2-3% squeeze on top of the next rally. If you shorties were confident in your position you wouldn't be on here day after day, hour after hour, posting non-stop ""armageddon is coming"" nonsense. But hey, good luck."
Easy go down easy will go up. If you know about trading it’s all a game
"will have the biggest one day gain since 2008. $qqq , $nflx, $amzn ,$ appl"
I’m shorting my shares at this point. It has increased too high too fast.
"welcome to the party. Your a bit late, but its time to get this party started."
"3,75% plus with no new news. What will happen if they anounce the new CFO this week. |This stock will jump fast!"
How do you buy after close?
I got in at $188! Long and strong!
Even Mr wonderful from shark tank said loves Netflix and going to buy more it’s a no No-brainer
Buy NFLX on the dips. You can’t go wrong.
Who bought a $480 call for Friday?
did you know before the July 2015 split netflix lost 140 points a few months before. made a fast recovery though. 25 points x7 before spit is 140. no one really analyzes charts they just panic sell. longs are good!
"Big picks, big winners, every week. That’s how I turned things around from losing trades. My secret weapon is (http://Thetraderguide.com). Join them today."
Hi again. Where’s that “$600” everyone was hyping just a couple of months ago? Hahah
Nobody is leaving netflix for such a minor price increase.
"This is EXACTLY why Netflix remains the BEST OF THE FANGS! Fact is they REMAIN...The ONLY FANG to Beat Top, Bottom and Guidance! In addition where apple is starting to realize there may only be SO MUCH consumers are willing to pay for an I Phone(Now 1000-1500?) Netflix 1 Dollar increases here& there to improve content are barely perceptible!"
Buy at $275
337.50 before friday
ok looks like it's making a comeback.
Great price!
"Another early trading session sell-off, but it looks like that may be it. Heading to $370+ today, I predict."
Netflix international is growing at amazing rate... Obama internationally is very popular. You Are Looking At The Next General.. if you leave politics aside this is a great move..mho
Not many better short candidates than NFLX. Field getting more crowded with lots of better capitalized players. You can't borrow mony forever.Short 300 here at $377.40
fire Susan Rice cancel the Obamas this stock will rise
Be careful with what Wall St is selling us. Tidepods & IBMs old legacy systems are not going to jump start the world economy.
"Tomorrow is an option expiration Friday, may open +$4-$5 just to clear some options. Nothing that hasn't been seen before."
Netflix stock price target raised to $480 from $435 at Pivotal Research
Finally finally finally Cramer has acknowledged what I have been pointing out for two years. The NFLX quagmire of content spending and customer retention is unsustainable and will lead to the ultimate demise of this company. It’s a mathematical certainty
Remember all the downgrades before earnings?
During last half hour share volume has dropped dramatically. Sometimes this means a bear trap is being set for after Europe close.
Whoever buys this stock at these prices needs their head examined
any predictions as to what will be the opening next week? I want to get in to but at right price.
"btw, Longs...don't fret. NFLX is fine..."
"$600 coming, hold on to your seatbelt"
Upgrades. Goes down. Upgrades. Goes down. Upgrades again. Goes down. Big subscriber gains leak. Goes down. Surveys show dominance in America. Goes down.
"Some day the entire market will just consist of NFLX as it never goes down. And that makes perfect sense. Perfect. Who else will be able to stream content but NFLX? And that $12 Billion in debt which isn't listed on the balance sheet won't ever matter, even after DIS takes all of its content off NFLX and starts its own streaming service. NFLX RULES!!!!!"
Watch she is dropping!!
why going down now...can someone explain?
Nflx needs to announce a slip 5-1 stock will move to 450/500
The markets were rough / oversold and took down the stock among other tech / financial stocks. I think $NFLX will have a better quarter than last. Hoping the markets are on the mend.
last earnings it was hovering 400 albeit it dropped after the good earnings. now it's at 20 percent or so less.
$NFLX $FB $WIMI hopefully we go strong in the morning...
12 point straight up days always follows with straight down. Let's see if the trend is bucked tomorrow.
nice came back today
"Remember when FB dipped during the privacy saga? It bounced back within weeks. I expect the same with $NFLX. Also, $IQ has enough positive news to help continue the momentum. Might cool off a bit tomorrow, then continue upwards by midweek."
Disney plus is advertising all over NFL games this weekend. This is really going to be a major subscription loss for Netflix.

To the Moon Alice.......
LOL @ at those who said it was falling 20%+ today. thank you everyone for this quick cash! glad i bought it in AH yesterday.
NFLX now has 6 PT upgrades today ranging from 585 - 700
Netflix has always beat subscriber expectations whenever it releases the first season of a big hit original series. The Queen’s Gambit is one the biggest of them all.
"Today is the start, market will be going up till Christmas."
"Ok, picked spots wisely, shorted a few shares at $315 whole figure - 315.50's, this is a temporary top. Declines on profit taking will be swift and short covering is drying up here as well. Going to let this trade play out swinging short. Stay nimble folks...VA"
"got in at $124 will get out at $2,124...."
"funny , 3 comments about heavy overvaluation and this stock recover emidatly."
Here it comes up up up don’t be scared and stay positive. We can do it 380.00
Lol to the shorts...
THE BEST SHORT STOCK IN THE BUSINESS!
see you all at 200 in the next few days
I bought at $400. Will I ever make my money back?
"Well, only a big tech is able to show this kinda growth during a crisis...it is time to stop bashing faangs!"
LOL Hulu increased their subs to 7 million to nflx 5 mil. That has to be a concern
Don't do it...don't buy a single share. You've been warned.
There are not enough questions being asked on the profitability of streaming services competing with Netflix.
LOL Goldman seriously reiterating $400?! NFLX has $8 billion debt and only $500 million annual income with slowing growth in a saturated market. So obvious Goldman is pumping and dumping before next earnings.
Down Goes Frazier....Down Goes Frazier
This os awesomeee!! Sorry for the ones who lost money but this is a great opportunity
"If it breaks $340 tomorrow, the next support is around $280."

$19/sh rise on this stock in one day is totally absurd. Market deserved a recovery today but NFLX's rise is insane.
350 next Friday according to outperforming earnings
"I agree it's a good company but there's too much speculation already priced in, and earnings won't live up to that. short now, buy wednesday."
"The Stock is $2,760 per share, everyone forgets it split 7 for 1, so it's actually doubled up Google, Amzn, and it's a one trick, Streaming Service."
"Disney For Investors, Netflix For Speculators https://seekingalpha.com/article/4272985?source=ansh $DIS, $NFLX"
"How come Netflix is down? Their earnings will be great due CV situation. Every family on the planet is now Netflix & chillin. Millions of kids watching Netflix becouse their school is closed. Companies like Tesla will loose, there is literally nobody buying Tesla car. Market is losing due panic, but after CV panic end forever there will be great earnings for Netflix and really bad for Tesla. I took them only as example. Don’t invest in stocks that will crash after their earnings.$TSLA$NFLX"
"I don’t see any correlation-ship between FB disappointing revenue and NTFX, two different business models. I guess it must be the FANG thing!"

Revenue run rate Is 21 billion a year. Revenue growth was 35% y/y excluding negative impact from foreign currencies. How is anybody going to touch them?
Lower volumes recently - here's to higher volumes and higher levels for nflx
Very good news. There is 40 % chance Apple will buy Netflixhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-dips-billion-dollar-toe-161414012.html
There is nothing to watch in Disney NFLX rocks
This should gap up and shoot out tomorrow. Time to test $600.
"Nflx added more subscribers + raised the price, but the earning per share did not meet expectations. is that make sense? Not for me."
We saw $375 last week. Hoping to see to $380 this week.
What a bargain!
Fantastic recovery for -15% to -7%. in a matter of hours. Will this be 390+ in two weeks time?
Let's hope it closes green today
"Monumental comeback.. come on, make your way to 325 now.."
Now NFLX needs to announce a split 5-1
A small bump rather!
"Scale is very, very powerful in the media industry. Henry Ford could only sell a car to one customer. Reed Hastings can sell a movie to 1 billion customers."
$433 tomarrow . yes
"Ive got a good percentage of my portfolio in NFLX. Its been the main stock that has drug it down since last October. If this happens to shoot up even close to my net cost, im dumping it. Ughhh.. My luck though, it will tank after earnings... hope not, we'll see..."
it wasn't a movie that killed our Embassador it is Susan Rice that will chill 50% off the value of NFLX. Sell this poison now
"Every time NFLX raised price, the came short on their earnings. This speaks volume about what to see in future. It has stiff competition and competitors are catching up. It is getting hard to get new subscribers so increasing prices. Just like medical insurance companies, limited consumers so keep raising prices to stay in profit...i see more red in coming days and months...now that they raised the price less new consumers will be attracted. Netflix had price benefit over Amazon prime, now that they are kinda of same in pricing,it will be hard to convince new consumers..."
it's only 15% after 100%+run-up..........
"Everytime market caves in the morning, it ends up closing green"
"Said $335 closing price, pretty close, anyways congrats to all alongs. $400 is soon to come, huge rally coming up and solid earnings are boosting all sectors. Financial leading with solid revenue and earnings especially Goldman Sachs beating EPS by more than a $1, economy strong and forward outlook of 4% GDP by mid 2019."
"NFLX has no moat! Really? $13 billion in original content and 122 Emmy nominations will be put together by a Walmart! Really, Disney is going to Mickey Mouse a challenge? Comcast - ever dealt with their customer service! The only true challenge is Amazon but it is too distracted and holds a fraction of viewership. NFLX is light years ahead of any competition and it simply needs to execute - in Reed Hasting’s astute leadership, NFLX will continue to flourish."
This is absurd. Stock price was higher than this weeks prior to earnings.
having Susan Rice and Obama on Netflix will only encourage non-americans on the Democratic side to subscribe
when announce pialways shoots upthen crashes back
Trader sees a breakout coming for Netflix https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/20/trader-sees-a-breakout-coming-for-netflix.html?__source=yahoo%7Cfinance%7Cheadline%7Cstory%7C&par=yahoo&yptr=yahoo
Back to 330's by end week..
Last chance to buy in folks ...it’s going to rain after hours 
looks like a double top to me.
Stocks typically drop on day 2 after a selloff like today. Let's see if NFLX holds true to that. My guess is it will be off 2-3% tomorrow then resume the run to $450.
Bought at 494$  Expecting to hit 530$ next week
"Avoid buying and book profit. This is fraudflix really. Huge fraud that I think going to come out sooner or later. Even it's not comeout, it's worst than pyramid scheme and only good thing is, if who ever doing it go undetected (Only Another fraud Bribe keeping them safe so far) They going to take benefit of both end.When going upand Then When going down. Because they are controlling how many subscriber getting added and reverse also they control."
It needs to test the Monday's after hour low of $342
$320 today $420 next then $520 which is the PT by Q2 2019.
"Upon launch, Disney+ will include ""at least five content channels"" including Disney, Pixar, Star Wars, Marvel and National Geographic"
They bring on a Netflix pumper right before the closing bell to prevent another run off. They have all the bases covered on this one. They upgrade in the morning and pump in the afternoon!!
Thumbs up if you held this over night
Wake me up at $401 please
The run to 750 begins now
"Wow , stays green.."
What a frustrating period with this stock
It's a joke that this one idea company is being valued higher than DIS which has a real assortment of businesses and which owns its own content. Markets have gone BONKERS!
my opinion. No installation. No receiver box. No special changer. No dish on top of my house. No contract. No 100$+ monthly bill. Most Emmies won because of good original content. Bottom line is they have successfully leveraged the Internet to deliver entertainment cheaper and evey day more people are signing up.
There’s no competition for Netflix top growing subscribers
No news why down?
"If this thing went down 10-15$ the Nas would crash hard, NFLX is like all of the Nas,, not sure there are any other stocks out there"
Easy short here. Watch this break 300 handle tomorrow.
"SO nice to have jumped in NFLX, FB and AMZN last week.... Seeing $$$$$$$$$$"
"NFLX surging, congrats Longs!!!"
what are the technical indicators for NFLX? more downside?
$325 is coming before lunch stat your buying. You should of bought yesterday it was your last chance to get it at a hell of a discount. It was a early trick or treat
50% chance this opens above 600 the next day after ER.
Made a big mistake of buying 1800 shares of this stock at 278 earlier today. Now negative 14k! Hope it gives me a chance to break even tomorrow!
Looking good so far.
450 after earnings
Where have all the haters gone? And the short side Disney pumping media analysts?
This one's gonna keep going up. like tesla. still not too late to buy some.
Will exceed subscriber growth forecast. So happy to buy more on the scare! Will be $450 by mid November.
"I just thoroughly reviewed their last quarter and it's worse than I thought. Liquid cash is about 3.3B and liabilities are 21B. Note that doesnt count off balance sheet items. Net operating income only increased 2.8% over prior year. There is a 141M net addition in the interest and other income line vs prior year first quarter. That's a non recurring event and cant be looked at in valuation. If they earn $3 a share in 2019 that's a 120 PE. Couple that with very moderate Operating income, leveraged balance sheet and increased competition, this stock could, and should, take a material hit. Do your own DD, but the results just dont justify this 158B valuation!! Wow."
"One thing I learned. Never listen to the bad comments here. If the stocks are at low price, buy them and you will be rewarded. Thanks Netflix. 600$ Soon. It was a great news today."
What’s the value of 545 calls right now?
"After the bell: Indiewire ""In 2020, Netflix reported its biggest viewing figures ever for a December, and, during this past year’s holiday season, the biggest Christmas week — December 25 through December 31 — ever. These latest stats, as shared by the streamer with IndieWire, are measured both by total viewing hours and average viewing hours per subscriber across each period."""
Can anyone explain how company expect $31.1 per subscriber in 2018 quarter when They only make $28.75 last quarter.Is another price increase. Is this company getting too much comfortable with value they provide?
"Highest number of open interest contracts expiring today (4,4509 contracts) strike of 550 so heads up it will keep drooping next 30min to hour and might see a drastic drop"
"Invest 10 000 in netflix a year ago, the ceo is a very intelligent and wise man, hes able to adapt netflix, netflix will win im sure, more and more people getting netflix account day after day in canada, europe and Africa."
What will happen to the shorts tomorrow?
"Is NFLX just another Tesla? Huge quarterly miss and stock plunge, follolwed by a huge rally off the low in anticipation of a much better 2Q? We will know about TSLA when their earnings report is released on July 24."
Did anybody mark my post that I wrote on Monday?335 by end of week375 end of September (it will be end of August actually)And 400 end of year. I was right on my first prediction
this will start to slowly bleed I to next two days
"10+ million subscribers this quarter, but hey... That's just me. Glta... I expect great beat either way"
"OMG spending on content will have to be drastically cut to stop the cash burn, and of course, subs will cut their subscription by the 10s of millions!Hilarious fact!"
Disappointing to see this before earnings.
Yesterday's share volume was only 42% of the daily average. Nobody's interested and the hedgies can't get out.
Guys was it a good idea to buy 10 at 380??!!
i was about to buy stocks just prior to earnings and put a stop loss just in case it drops. Then I thought forget it and left home. Now I come back and it's up 13% -.-
"So judging by how much $AMZN, $GOOG, $FB and some others have dropped after hours due to the miss of $NFLX, $NVDA should wear the loss like a badge of honor as the company has arrived?"
Monday should recover?
"John Malone says scale is the most important factor in the media industry. I would also add Reed Hastings, while he's still around God bless."
"When old media come out with a steaming service they say won't compete with Netflix, or a service that reduces the time of a TV show or movie to 10 minutes, or a service that pays you to stream video you know the streaming wars are over and Netflix has won."
Can this be why this is down today?https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-hires-key-netflix-engineer-in-bid-to-boost-subscription-services-11580324237
close today: 342.19
"400 million customers by 2010, $1,000 stock"
from a chart point of view Netflix is at the bottom completely washed out and oversold. its a great entry point imho
I can't imagine anyone buying this stock at this price.
"2000 share options straddle contracts. 1000 calls, 1000 puts. I'll make money no matter what happens tomorrow."
some d-bag keeps pushing the stock down the moment it gains life
"You can’t talk about the entertainment industry without bringing up streaming service Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Historically NFLX stock has been an expensive play, but a worthwhile investment because the firm’s position at the top of the streaming space looked very solid. However, recently Netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competition.In just two months, NFLX stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20% after the company’s second-quarter results underwhelmed the market. To be sure, Netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was, but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space. Plus, although NFLX is nearing saturation in the U.S., the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in India, where its content has been well-received so far. So, while the Q2 results were admittedly disappointing, this pullback in NFLX stock makes for a buying opportunity."
NFLX crushed earnings last quarter. I mean absolutely destroyed all expectations. Stock popped up before we had a tech market correction. Trust me when I tell you that it'll be right back up to $600 in no time. You want a bargain? NFLX is it.
$450 puts will print next week it will be a bloodbath
On the news after hours yesterday NFLX was down 3 points. After the day traders were done and the news analyzed this WINNER soars nearly 20 points into today's action. This stock's share appreciation is far from over.
Would Netflix buy CBSViacom and really give Disney some Streaming Competition
"With so many of their programs trans-homosexual themed, not many can relate. Not interested."
"So goes FAANG, so goes the market. :( FAANG has carried the market this year. If they fall, watch out!!!"
"For all the shorties out there saying the P/E of NFLX is too high, keep in mind that Amazon's (AMZN) is 213, and we all know how that story ended up. Don't listen to the shorties on this, they have money to lose and are trying to get people to panic. They just want a few bucks in the short term, while us longs are making money hand over fist. Everyone knows that NFLX is the entertainment platform of the future and a solid company."
"Like I said, the market will do its best to separate you from your shares. Ignore the volatility the story is still ongoing."
one day before earning it would be 450 or 460.
Funds are buying.
Nice movie bird box
Only 115 points away from 400. WE are coming

NFLX will be above 280 tomorrow . Buy now . Very successful line up of content and then all carriers are offering netflix . NO one is going to develop content other than big boys like Netflix . Every one is going to pay them for content . Disney has long way to go . This qtr will be huge specially global .
You cannot beat super growth story!NFLX is No1. of such story as secular super growth!

Relax...markets red today so it will dampen the rise but when markets go green...BAM!!
Tesla teams up with Netflix to distribute network satellites for TV.
Walmart’s entry into streaming will crush NFLX as it will under cut prices and quickly gain the middle to lower end of users who are price sensitive. NFLX is built on house of cards with negative cash flow and loaded with debt and burning what cash it has.
"Bubble Trouble....Right now NFLX is selling for a whopping and nosebleed......117x.....(18) estimates of $2.73. Why is this alarming ?

The markets used to drive me crazy with losses. I almost left the trading game for good until a friend shared a little secret with me. He gets his best picks (one a week) from (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Join them.
Netflix is still a great stock in my opinion. Should be worth 3 times the amount or more.
Should I buy net shares before earnings come out? first thing in morning? or wait for earnings.
Everyone should have bought the dip that went to 490 - this is a guarantee smash after earnings - it will hit 575 easy
TOLD YOU Last week was a FIRE Sale
Netflix will be worth buying when they start offering more movies and content I want to see rather than just their own stuff...Its not all bad but come on...
1000 by year end
remember the short sellers and haters at 325. Lol it went back up to 386. I see a recovery before earnings next week and if they meet earnings and subscriber numbers it will hit new highs
people that keep talking about option volume clearly don't understand the highest volume will always point to current price...look at the open interest that is your actual clue of what is to come which points to 550 dip and upper range of 570
That was an amazing turnaround
shorts take profits today before option expiration tomorrow. after shorts covering Nflx will tank Monday next week
Why was NFLX up 4% today - great storyhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-netflix-stock-popped-4-233500531.html

Hold.
Honestly speaking i am impressed by Netflix contents lately. They are becoming very innovative and the contents are top notch
Should Apple buy Netflix? Does it need to do this?
Obama not happy with this actionHe will have zombie Joe sign an executive order to boost the stock price
lower highs and lower lows on big volume..very bearish. no real bounce anytime soon. It will continue to trade lower and lower until the next earnings report.
put all your money in Netflix and just wait. u will be rich!
Are you shmucks that were posting $280 still out there?
"Look at the Balance Sheet. The unamortized content costs, massive debt and recurring negative cashflow. Plus the competition has just started. Really shocked on the stock price but this will drastically fall. Might not be today or tomorrow but fundamentals are terrible and it's a matter of time."
Don’t worry you think this is going to be red everyday or green. It has to go up or down sometimes. But it will run up faster then fallen. It could happen today or next week 400 see you soon

Some dolt just compared FB to NFLX. lmao Can someone tell me how they are related at all? Shows you how stupid these boards can be. How much debt does FB have on its book. How much does FB charge the end user? Two completely different business models but some dolt used FB to defend NFLX. Best laugh I have had in a while
"as warren buffet says, buy when the opportunity arises to buy a good stock on sale."

can this stock spilt
We'll get a 4-10% pop very soon. It's been trying to break to the upside last couple sessions only to break down midday. Maybe Tesla and AAPL beating will bring forth such a pop in the coming days.
Sell sell sell. Debt continues to rise and competition is increasing. NFLX has no other revenue stream. Waiting for them to announce ad-based plans.
"Subliminal ads should drive future of NFLX........If I was part of management,I would deeply dig in that area....If it is not already the case...."
Global hits just keep on coming: 'Mindhunter' season two finally premieres on Netflix August 16thhttps://www.engadget.com/2019/07/12/mindhunter-season-two-august-16/
"Do your own research of $IQ and $huya and you'll see, way more upside there than Netflix. Netflix had a great run this year, don't get me wrong but look elsewhere for better upside"
"LOL @ Netflix. When your biggest competitor is Amazon.com, should your stock trade at 300 times earnings? Nope! You should have a bankruptcy lawyer on speed dial. It's hilarious that Netflix trades like a world-beating monopoly. When in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet: Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon. Will Netflix survive? Sure, quite possibly. But should Netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market? LOL. Just ask Excite, MySpace, Nokia, and Barnes and Noble! Competing against any ONE of Google, Facebook, Apple, or Amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful. Competing against all of them at once is REALLY not fun! I wonder if Netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels? In 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year. Now, just 15 weeks later, it's trading in the 300s! Is this a permanent change? To revisit the levels of just a few months ago, NFLX stock price would get cut in half. Gulp."
"I have so few short shares in Nflx, so it goes up or down will not affect me. 10 years ago, I used to listen to the pumpers and analysts in message board, I lost so much money. Since 4 years ago, I decide not to listen to them, and I recovered all my losses, and making profits. I guess some of pumpers working for the brokerage banks. My experiences tell me, Nflx will meet, exceed or miss ER expectations, it will go down within 3 weeks after ER. The high debts will eat up the profits. The current price is too high to sustain regardless of meet or miss ER. NFLX needs multiple products to survive"
"https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/netflix-shares-can-fall-50-if-growth-cred-is-lost-says-needham?post=302277Covid-19 is about to end, Netflix will fall because people don't have to stay isolation and people gonna travel instead."
I really do not like holding a position in a company when earnings hit but I may just try a short position on Netflix. I think the numbers would have to be great to move the needle higher and I expect them to be no better than good and maybe a little negative .
Wonderful deal !!!!
Nice! Now up to 300!!!!!
"Well, at least we ended up green.

I guess NFLX likes higher interest rates. Shows what I know. I thought higher interest rates would put downward pressure on the stock price.
let's see 20% drop!!!

4 out of 5 shares owned by institutions. They won't be selling. Demand for shares today will far exceed supply. Add to that it has been stuck in channel for 6 months and seems like easy buy. 600 by end of week seems realistic.

"There is no stopping this. Analysts are embarrassed because they keep having to make up an excuse to up their models big time. This is up 68% or $57 billion in 2 months on no news other than a 1.9M subscriber beat. This is pure euphoria. No way to trade this except go long and hope it keeps going. No telling how high this will get before earnings release next month. Their sub guidance was very low (same as last quarter, which they beat), so any fool can figure they will beat again by the same amount. Does stock go up another 68%? At some point, the market cap is so high that it would imply they capture all entertainment dollars in the world. Guess that would be a trillion dollar cap? We could hit that by 2020 at this rate."
Its GONNA pop after earnings and i'm pretty sure we GONNA see 350 by next friday

"If you look at Netflix options, you could tell the big boys are off loading their shares. All the calls are dropped 50-70% while puts are only 7%. It implies puts are in more demand!"
Good call Barry screaming buy at 334.
"Remember Blackberry RIMM? At one time it was ""the"" leader of the stock market. NFLX is next RIMM"

I am going to short tomorrow.
"Subscribes count not everything, subscribers need money to there valet to continue membership. Think  about coming economic situation of US and world."

Netflix has little competition which always comes from lower prices. Their main competitors cable TV are raising prices.
There it goes. Someone wanted a bargain and got it.
Selloff likely related to options expiration on Friday. I bet we see 52-week highs this week.
short of the day... starbucks
"This will definetly beat earnings. But those who actually insist to belive that the stock will be worth 400, 500, 600 within a week or two are just delusional. The big investors will cash out after earnings. They want their quick and easy money."
Trade war and tarrifs concerns along with higher interest rates has caused the market to re-evaluate growth stocks. The problem was a lot of growth was already getting priced into a lot of these names. So they overshot and now with this selloff will likely undershoot at some point.
Panickers feeling mighty atupid...scared money don't make no.money. z
I don’t why people would buy this stock.... LMAO
Netflix shining again
wow! nice buying opportunity!
"Netflix is quickly approaching 150 million subscribers. It added nearly 9 million paying subscribers during the final three months of 2018, beating its own expectations of 7.6 million new subscribers. Netflix (NFLX) now has 139 million subscribers globally."
Did you guys not read that management views this Q as a blip on their otherwise stellar predictions of future growth? They clearly explained why this Q underwhelmed.
Another split? 3 for 1?

Rainbow Financial Services upgrades netflix to 425pt from 395.
"Resistance at 575, if crossed then 670-680."
"This was there strongest quarter from seasonality perspective. They also tend to always do well and FCF is to be expected in light of stay at home environment. That said, this stock isn't a value play, its supposed to be growth play. Will new subscribers be sustainable even if they pull out great content? I think netflix's best days are behind it and absent diversifying their business model, probably is range bound at best."
Why the drop?????
The number at 830 had 0 to do with Netflix we trade to 270 this week easy
iq is the next netflix
when does the earning report come out Thur Pre or market close?
Amazing day- where all others are deep red or flat NFLX gains ~4%
It is still down: supply greater than demand!

"so with a P/E of 106, it will take only 106 years for the company to earn it's current market cap? is that a good deal? BTW what dividend is Netflix paying its shareholder/owners?What is Netflix expected capex requirements to continue producing original content vs expected revenue and cash in the bank?Questions to ponder on a day of ""irrational exuberance."""

"got, you make a good point. Piggybacking off that, the 10 largest Nasdaq companies (NFLX is like #8) are now worth much more than the entire German economy and closing in on Japan, the 4th and 3rd largest economies in the WORLD. Really? Day of reckoning is coming for sure."
"They’re running out of analysts to try and manipulate the stock with price target increases, got to feed this thing news every day or it starts sinking. I’ll be long again after this short when I get a way better price."
All indicators are pointing to a 200 point drop tomorrow. Sub $100 easily.
If you could afford an Apple iPhone that cost 1200 you can afford Netflix for the next 12 years at 14.99 a month. This should be 429.00 already. Now tomorrow 380.00
"You know the old sayin when something seems to good to be true it probably is. The fantastic content that NFLX creates comes at a very large price. $20b to be precise. Not including the $1.5b they recently borrowed. It’s Interesting that they go to the debt markets rather than dilute the stock. Further evidence of stock manipulation IMHO. Unfortunately for Netflix. There will be no way for them to reduce content spending while growing or even maintaining current subscribers, so soon enough the alarms will toll, the bow will break and NFLX will fall."
Total joke this market is
NFLX had a great quarter
"I should know this, but for tax purposes is a stock transaction based on initiation date or settlement date? If it's settlement date wouldn't a transaction initiated today settle next week?"
"Based off historic Netflix stock price, this is set to fall for a few days, have a tiny bounce, and then drop off a ledge"
Sold at $310 for an 80% profit. Going to buy DIS soon
"Today it's a buy, tomorrow it's a buy, next week it's a buy, next month it's buy, next year it's a buy, next decade it will still be a buy, in a century - you guessed it! still a buy!"

I wish my phone would catch fire so I can’t check this thing anymore.
I see closing at $365 today myself. It will take about end of the month or sooner to get back to 400.00 again.
Large buy block.
The rest of the FANG stock earnings will continue to drive NFLX UP as well as the markets.
going ro 200
"Real Money contributor and former NYSE trader Stephen ""Sarge"" Guilfoyle noted that Netflix remains a favored short position of his due to longer term problems that persist in the stock.""The fact is that for many firms engaged in the business of streaming television, costs are only going higher, perhaps much higher as the field becomes ever more competitive,"" he explained."
IBased on today and yesterday price action I can easily can see a 20% shave after q2
+10-15.00 tomorrow. Easy.
NFLX should start buying and split
$440 by September 15
$170 billion market capX 100 million subscribers takes in 12 billion spends 50 billionshould be a $50 stock
This is exactly why I never could justify buying netflix. Anyone can copy what they are doing. I knew it was just a matter if time before the bottom fell out.
"the 10 year is 3%rates are moving upretail sales low, this monthinterest rates uptime for nflx to correct?"
was hoping for a retracement but flew away..
"if the world is at war, even more of a reason for people to stay home and watch Netflix."
"Well, I'm ruined. Nothing I can do but hold my short now and pray for a miracle. Too much margin. The system is rigged."
If you compare to mcaps of other big stocks and earnings ratio no reason this cannot be 400b. Will just go up almost continuously like Tesla. Everyone starting to question the value of everything nowadays
I would say it’s a safe argument to suggest there was massive insider trading going on last week with knowledge of the debt offering. I’m not blaming NFLX but have little doubt many involved in this issuance warned others. Criminal Wall Street at work.
"hits just keep on comingNetflix twitter:""The rumors are true. The tangled story of Morpheus, King of Dreams is becoming a Netflix series!

"No more subscriber growth, hence they have to raise price. Lots of other companies moving into this space. Netflix = next AOL"
just finished watching season 2 of Ozark. Great series. if NFLX continues to make content like this no reason why the stock can't rise to 400.
Can we see some green days plz....
"Netflix has highest content in global market to attract all customers from different countries . Netflix has become the part of comcast ,Verizon and other carriers as bundle key inclusion . All new Smart TV has netflix as part of smart gui . Kids are hooked to netflix versus regular TV . Guys this is bargin and buy here ...Look at my previous post and stock has done great versus any ohter FANG stocks .........."
The charts are saying its going higher.
"When is Hilaryy getting a show on nflx?It’ll be called, “Get Ready for Another Failed Candidacy!”"
Nice run for a second day!
450 after earnings call
"A lot of air under this one, drops could get dramatic."
4-5-0 fri
Looks like it is consolidating for a big move.
"under 400 today, this is coming down fast could be 390 this week itself"
How many trump tweets will it take this weekend to allow his buddies to buy Netflix stock for under 200 per share?
I’m almost afraid to watch
"A hugely over-priced stock...and the fact that they're considering share buy-backs is insane!....they're barely cash flow positive as it is....they should be doing the exact opposite, SELLING shares at these lofty prices and using the money to fight off increasing competition.....the outdated ""maximizing shareholder value"" mantra comes a cropper eventually, just look at GE and Boeing."
WOW!
300 today let’s go
Is this buying opportunity ( or selling )?.....
"NFLX mailed DVD’s 15 years ago. Their business model died, but they reinvented themselves as a deliverer of content online. Then, content providers started to play hardball and limit access to some content. NFLX completely reinvented itself and became a producer of content. It seems now that premium 3rd party content is the next leap forward. Perhaps, NFLX will need to again completely reinvent itself and sell premium 3rd party content; like, selling new releases at a per movie price, and not only doing subscription for unlimited video. If any company has been near death and figures out how to come roaring back...NFLX is that company."
"TBH, as a short, I almost start to miss the optimisim once abundant here."
More subscribers than expected makes competitors less willing to compete with Netflix on price.
Seems Like $FB $TWTR and streaming stocks went down in AH in sympathy with $NFLX
Analyst average Price target: $628.26Wall Street high price target: $850Netflix makes up 2.5% of my portfolio and will make up about 5% of my portfolio by end of February. This prices is a steal.
Will this be around in 5-10 years?They may have to sell a bunch of shares to stay afloat.
"More likely trading on the technicals today. It overshot the 50 day on the way up, it failed and it came back down under the upper Bollinger band on the 1 year chart (roughly $364). Give this another day or two for the bollinger bands to start heading higher and it should be fine."
The selling resumes.
SHORTS DESTROYED. 
10 MINUTES TO THE CRASH!!!!!!!!!
Should do your dd. But looking at VIAC. By the numbers it looking like they still showing a lot of growth in near future. Plus divi I will keep my Netflix but Viacom is a good study lol
it cant be green all the time
"Wont drop any further, ALL the damage has been done, its at the bottom with October coming to a close...……...good buy at this price for long, the only way is up and profit"
Expect strong Earnings and PPS is heating up for a breakout run! GLTA
Second coming of winter to boost share of NFLX come Tuesday. New highs lie directly ahead.
Buying here at a 24% discount. Invest now while the stock is on sale. Opportunities like this don’t come often. Blue Light Special Folks.
NFLX will reach $ 408.00 today. Expect a solid 2nd quarter!!!
"Best non-earnings day since the Friday before earnings,10/12.Was able to stay green the whole day, +.16 was the low point. Best close since 10/33.Let's keep the run to 400 going!"
Shorts have gotten obliterated betting against this name. It's like salmons swimming upstream where the end result is just tragic...
"Interest rates up. Competition bearing down on Netflix, yet Goldman Sachs sees fit to do an upgrade today. And the stock goes up five percent. Does that seem even slightly strange to anyone"
"Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.38% lower. NFLX is holding a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now.Digging into valuation, NFLX currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 80.93. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.77, which means NFLX is trading at a premium to the group.It is also worth noting that NFLX currently has a PEG ratio of 2.7. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Broadcast Radio and Television was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.44 at yesterday's closing price."
"My Indian neighbor cancelled Netflix because he said to watch any good or popular movie such as Titanic....etc, you have to pay a rental fee between $2.99 and $3.99.....NFLX PE is way too high to justify the price of $265, many other attractive companies with much lower PE such as GooGle (PE 38), FB (PE 22), Amzn (PE 85), BABA (PE 40).....etc."
Like NFLX a lot and IQ rocket still very undervalued 500% Upside possibles to match valuations
If amzn tomorrow also reports the prime video new members then you will see nflx at 430 at the end of next quarter.
Lets take this to $400 then we can have that 30% market correction.
"It is always hard to gauge the performance from the opening bell, I usually like to take the pulse around 10:00 - 10:30. At this point, we just need to see that there is still interest in this stock. Judging by what a lot of analysts and money managers have already said, it appears that the bulls may very well still out weigh the bears. We just have to hope they put their money where their mouth is. Maybe the whole tech sector will help buoy us up unless everyone is out to play right now with Amazon, Apple and the other FAANGs. After earnings season, maybe the chickens will come back home to roost. Good luck."
If the market is up tmrw $20+ if not $10+ easily
Still satisfied! My cost basis is $273. Regardless this will go back up!!
"IMO NFLX would not be increasing prices if they are losing Subs. This increase is going to add ~$1B domestically and another ~$1B from international Subs. Their model is working and Sub must be increasing, otherwise they would not be raising prices, esp in light of competition from DIS/T. I think 4Q earnings are going to be good.Good luck to all."
I say ER will be lack-luster. Numbers will be in line with expectations which is already priced in. Don't expect this to pop AH. Also ER better be spotless or this will most definitely fall guaranteed. Just my 2c...getcho popcorn ready.
"MKM Partners out very bullish on NFLX, reiterates buy rating with 12-month price target of 415, sees surging earnings growth through 2025, and sees the stock to rally 30% annually for 5 yrs. They must know something."
Guys take all you profits from Netflix again remember what happened to nvidia when GS did the same
"I've been long with Netflix holding a small position for a long time. I've also been a netflix subscriber for many years, but there #$%$ attitude and rip off approach, by increasing their subscription costs, trying to control the usage within a household, while minimizing the content globally - will come and bite them back. The steaming market is being saturated, and not as with Amazon, Disney etc. Netflix is a one trick pony!"
the fact that the market is going down and Netflix maintains that 13% proves how strong the buying is..
355 today
thumbs up if you think it will increase at least 5% after earnings.
GREEN soon
Whose buying here? And I don’t mean covering.
Hasting will not sell all his stock if he is knows his company doing well. Common sense.
"Bye, Bye, Bye, wave to the onlookers as the train departs the depot. Shorts, have fun covering."
Added only 670K new subscriber. But how many of them are one of those free ones that received membership through mobile phone companies and other partners. They don't pay. This company never tells the truth.
"Usually there are number out before earning, no such preview this time. very likely a subscriber miss."
looks like its going to hit 280 today
"What happened???!!!!going down too much..,"
Turned green but then quickly reversed course. This has no support at all. I can't believe this is the invincible NFLX. Literally the most powerful stock of the last 5 years. Dying right here. Even AH is down. Maybe this is truly the end and we head all the way down below $300? If this remains weak next week I'm out and will go short. Good luck to anyone trying to trade this. It had a furious rebound from the big drop Tuesday but then has turned around and just faded down 20+ points. Too much pain..
"Hulu, Disney+; Showtime, CBS; AppleTV. Case closed."
"$CSCO $WIMI $NFLX The current market value, I think, is undervalued"
425 close
"Shorts, you can have my shares at $420..."
"There is nothing wrong and everything right with NFLX except the price. It should be a great 20 billion dollar company capable of reaching 50 billion in 3 to 5 years. Instead it is price the same as Disney,,really? Disney. Pleaes do not be the dope holding this as hedge funds run."
"There are hundreds of channels to choose from soon to be 1000s. On internet tv. NFLX is just one of those thousands. They are absolutely a doomed company, they don’t have a sustainable pricing model."
Everyone ready to gamble? It’s black or redtoday. Could go either way in a big way. Doubt it just hangs around $350.
"come on baby, you can do it"
From what...590ish to 530ish. Quite a drop...
Just wow! I sold at $252 for a quick gain. But congrats to those who stayed in!
"simple economics for nflx. the most expensive item sold $17/month. does not justify the stock price of $356. aapl, most expensive item sold is in the thousands."
up another 10 today.
CBS beats on 33% growth in licensing revenue. Very smart CEO over there who knows the only way to grow is by partnering with Netflix.
up $3.61 in AH
"Getting there, slowly but surely."
This is never going back down.subscriptions will Increase and price of subs will rise. Everyone loves netflix
Going up.... We will close at 375
Anyone seen a buy out number floating around. Once we see people speculating on a premium price then something simmering.
"There was talk of people dropping their Netflix subscriptions when it was announced they signed a contract with President Obama, etc. I wonder if that had an effect on the loss in subscriptions?"
"These dips mean nothing. Netflix will continue to be leader in the streaming space. Disney will never manage to restore bargaining leverage.this mesaage board is now hopeless, should invest in mutual funds."
I would say the final hour of trading will be volatile. Where it finishes is anyone’s guess
First time this will go hard !!! 10%
Here we go people start buying. I see it going up by the end of the week.
I suggest to cancel your NFLX account. Go see your friends. Enjoy the summer sun. Dip into a lake or ocean. Hike under the trees.
"Today bought 3000 TVIX at 8.444, sold at 10.40. Thought I was a genius. AH it's up to 17!!!!! Oh well, no complaints. Very dangerous investment,but wow, can it run"

Low rate forever and ever! NFLX loves low rates. Spend away!

NFLX cooking books ! how do we know that this is not all made up on the subscriptions ?
lol most of you people have no idea how big of a bubble this stock is... nflx can drop 50% and it still will be expensive... I say this not to scare you but just stating facts. Most people in the dot com bubble didn't think about the downside either.. most were completely wiped out. Would you pay 100M for your local gas station that earned 200k a year? No is the obvious answer. That's how much your paying for NFLX...
"PE 200+ in an inflated stock market, nowhere to go but down"

"it's just a matter of time before NFLX signs a partnership with IQ to deliver it's content in China.

I sold all my NFLX stock yesterday....going to drop much further
Controlled selling will continue folks until stock hits $200's. It's obvious that big boys are exiting but don't want it to go down so fast.....they want to get as much money out (small retail investors will be holding the bag).
it will drop back below 500 in a few weeks. no longer growing much and eps dropping. only sustained by jacking up monthly sub.

"Take from a thousand families, give to one family. Thats how the US Stock market works."
downgrades usually follow in a day Or two.
Netflix valuation is elusive. For example: after reporting q4 2016 earnings the stock gapped up to 140. It was only 87 five months earlier. At PE 325 people were saying it was extremely overvalued. 140 looks very cheap now at PE 34 on this years est earnings and PE 22 on next years est earnings and the company still growing faster than ever. In a few years 350 will look very cheap.

"""Netflix Earnings: Analysts expect the FANG stock to deliver a whopping 433% increase in EPS growth in the second quarter. That would mark the third time in the last four reports that Netflix has generated a triple-digit earnings gain.

Also more movies Netllfix can buy (at a discount) from the glut of unreleased films looking to re-coop their losses. Which leads to even more subscribers and consumer habits of using netflix and further cementing of Netflix as king. Netflix was already synonymous with the best in streaming.

"Netflix is licensing its movies to China's iQiyi on a movie by movie basis, that's the way for the company to enter China."
"another Q, additional 524 m $ of negative free cash flow, around 2 B for the whole year and another 1.6 B raised in debt. Total debt is up from 3.3 to 6.5 B in one year. Looks good :) This company is burning cash fast. No wonder its debt has junk rating, but the shareholders seem to ignore it. All they look at is subscriber growth. It's like year 2000 is back."
Reading comments.Why would anyone buy puts after stock fell $65 or calls after stock ran $40?Please do not play options as a buyer!If you own the stock sell covered calls for $90+ tax deferred cash per share
Buy the dip!!!! Stocks ONLY go up!!! Cramer said so! BUY BUY BUY!!!!!
I don’t understand the 3% rise. I seriously don’t..
"Peaking stock price of NFLX is a thing of the past. It has very very limited scope of rising from above this level. It has lost its monopoly. Original content can be produced by other competitors as well.With surplus cash, Apple can be a winner in the race. Disney content going away from Netflix can prove expensive to Netflix. Stock price will remain in this level or will drift down when Market correction happens."
Man. All FANG have been a big zero for six months. If nothing moves this ER round it’s certainly time to move on.
"Seriously folks, stock is up 70% since Jan 1!!!! What logic is there to justify such a rise in valuation? I want the same prescription everyone is taking."
Oh come on...enough of this drop.
"I made a mistake and went long too early with this, expecting a bounce back when it dropped below $300. Market seems to want to take this down more, and I remember several rides this year on the way up when it would go up for 6 or 8 days in a row. I now fear it could do that on the way down. The one piece of good news with this is the sub growth, which is going to beat expectations once again, but that is 3 weeks off. Cant hang on that long if this keeps grinding down. I will likely bail tomorrow if another red day. Good luck to longs."

"hi gals and guys, im the wolf Sheppard sell above $317.50"

Nflx can't seem to stay above 290. It looks like that is where they are going to suppress it.

I have a question. I'm looking at the nasdaq right now and looking at the 3 year/weekly chart. I see that when there is a huge negative event that occurs that the nasdaq corrects to the 200 sma line. 2 events I see were 12/24/18 & 3/23/20. If the treasury yields rises to very high levels does that mean at the very least that the nasdaq will correct the 50 sma line? The 50 sma and 200 sma line are stretched extremely far apart right now which is telling me that assets are hyper inflated as well. Wouldn't these 2 lines eventually snap back closer together? They don't like to stay too far apart from each other.$msft $goog $amzn $fb $twtr $nflx

450 next stop
Great rally to end the day folks. Bottom line is this though.. this will trade within a 10 point window in either direction until the Q1 earnings call. 9+ mill subscribers sends this up 20 points and ultimately to 400 in weeks to follow. They miss the 8.9 million subscriber number and we have a big problem on our hands and we need to sell cause the growth story is what buries the P/E ratio. It's that simple.
not looking good. very weak open when the market opens strong. be careful
are you guys ok today?
Any technical traders confirm based off 6/26 chart open and 6/27 close that next level support is $380
so if nflx has 700 million users at $10/month...that would equate to $84 billion in 2018 revenues. How in the world are they projected to get $16 bill in revs versus $12 ill in revs last year while this goes up in market cap y around $15 bill/day. Irrational exuberance with a capital I
the irony that the current price is the same as June 1st 2018. that's only 45 days ago. so it will recover back up 18 dollars since aftermarket low

One thing for sure: IF I OWNED ONE OF THESE CRAZY COMPANIES (CMCSA OR DIS) I WOULD BE SELLING MY ENTIRE POSITION. NFLX is the one to play here.

450 today ?
"NFLX = $500 by August 1, 2018"
I think investors are panicking without even looking into what Disney+ is. It's not the same service at all. Not even close to be. It's kids content. I'll keep my Netflix subscription.
Well g go go looking for 300 mark....then back to 400 in couple of weeks
"why is the ""Top Reaction"" still ""Cold weather mean indoor movies."" Hahahah LMAO. Please, let's get new reactions.Netflix is hot right now. The upgrades are coming for a reason. They are very well positioned. If Netflix needed to raise cash, they are easily able to do so. These are smart people on the board, this is an investment, not a cash cow. I think they should raise our pricing 2-$3.00 per account. They have produced a product people love and yearn for more of. It makes sense, while still keeping the cost of subscriptions relatively low. Me personally, would rather pay a couple dollars more, than see ad pop-up's everywhere. Thoughts?"
Netflix can dial down spending if they wanted.....but they won’t because there is a strategy in place here. This is an investment for their future as Reed Hastings said himself.
Cramer said buy NFLX last night.

"If Santa Claus comes to town tomorrow, we may see the stock trading back to 300 by year end on very strong subscriber growth numbers. Be prepared. JMHO"
"For me Key question will answer in 4 hour. If this is 390+ I will have 2000 short. If below 390 I will have 1600 short.If there is sudden Sell off and close below 382.5 I will have 1200 short.I let market decide my fate for next few days as there is no point to sell put for little premium at such inflated price. It's very hard to make decision on whether start selling near money put (For like 25%) or wait for this excitement end. While this is way over done, I can't predict which price it will stop going up and start going down. Since Regardless it trade 340 or 400 it's way more over value."
NFLX WILL BE BULLISH THROUGH THEIR EARNINGS ON TUESDAY!!!
Have any of you even seen the Disney app? It’s very average. After everyone sees the marvel movies and Disney movies then what?? It will take them a few years to catch up to Netflix. It’s not that impressive
NFLX is downgraded this morning to sell from buy...
When did NFlx split. I have been in my man cave for two months.
"Nflx is a day trade stock; It is not for long term investment. It pays no dividend, high P/e, a lot of competitors and debts. If you want to short, then wait after ER. If you are long, then sell and take profit before ER. A lot of unemployed people, they need to cut back expenses, not adding more expenses on unnecessary as Nflx, DIS. Plenty of free movies on YouTube. Why pay?"
Could go down on monday. But if they anounce a good new CFO or other good news before or on monday.... this will rise even more.
"NFLX Hi-Yield Bond Rating Boosted! By Ciara Linnane, MarketWatch S&P revises its outlook on the company's rating to positive from stable Netflix Inc.'s high-yield bonds ticked up Thursday, after S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook on the company's credit, citing a stronger-than-expected operating performance in 2017."
Disney now has all of Fox's content and will most likely pull all of it from Netflix when it launches it's own streaming service. There will be very little good quality shows on Netflix and people will have to choose between different platforms which will put pricing pressure on subscription fees. Growth for Netflix is having some major headwinds which will undoubtedly affect the share price...

"CNBC currently, analyst Rich Greenfield is bullish on Netflix."
Can someone educate me that how they only expect 21% revenue growth when they just hiked 18% price on the subscription? Are they only expecting 3% growth if they didn’t hike the price v？
I like netflix as a service and investor. But swing trading this thing I shorted it all the way up to 593. What people don't realize is it surged way too high and fast for the short term..... the potential buybacks are not for sure and won't be for a long while. They are also in a catch 22 with covid since the subscribers have surged due to covid but they are also running much behind on new content also due to covid = catch 22. I have already watched everything I can possibly find on there and I'm cancelling after the second price increase for the service taking place only a few months apart until they have a ton of the new anticipated releases which all have no actual dates on them. I think many will follow like myself and no way this price keep sup this high until it dips way lower. Though I do think it will come back up but maybe not until end of year.
"This stock is like bitcoin at close to 20,000. Netflix is a great company. But the only thing it has is first-mover advantage in the streaming area. With more players and more competition, it will only lose its market share in US. Internationally? keep burning cash while facing more local competition as well."

"We will see what the bottom is. And where it goes from there. I am still a firm believer of this company. Have 205 @186 i bought a while back. And now 40 extra @ 336. Netflix grows very fast, content is getting better and better. And kids don't know any better these days then that Netflix is available. They grow up with it. Just like Mc Donalds, Coca cola etc."
how can anyone hold or bye this stock now
420 eod??? just hope.
"Up 14 of 16 trading days this year. Up $34, which is a 36.1% increase. Market cap has increased $30 billion in those 16 days. Really the only significant news in that time was that they beat on subs by just 1.93 million (they met on rev and EPS). That's a $15.5 million market cap increase for each new subscriber. Wow!!! This is just amazing."
"I'm not concerned. With a big jump since January, this is a breather. Perhaps, a return to reality. It will be OK.The sky, in fact, isn't falling. Read this:https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/17/netflix-stock-has-a-history-of-big-rebounds.html"

"Netflix price target raised to $650 from $640 at Morgan Stanley, OverweightMorgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised the firm's price target on Netflix to $650 from $640 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Media remains ""very cyclical"" and he expects 2021 to be a year of top-line strength, said Swinburne. While he thinks Netflix has been ""perhaps the most positively affected by COVID tailwinds"" given the long-term benefits from shifting streaming behaviors, the stock has not seen any multiple expansion, said Swinburne, who sees the potential for Netflix's margin expansion to ""break out"" beyond the 300 basis points per year level to which the company has guided."

The drama created by NFLX trading before earnings is more entertaining than anything streaming on NFLX.
Check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They just mentioned NFLX in the daily newsletter.
"I love NFLX, but cancelling Daredevil and The Punisher was a big mistake! Seriously! Those shows were amazing and just getting into their prime, there was so much left to tell in the stories and so many dedicated fans! Netflix needs to sit down with Marvel and renegotiate a deal to bring back Daredevil and The Punisher."
Where are the analysts with their $500 price targets today???
"Read my previous update. Compare this with Goldman just put out. Goldman Sachs added Netflix to its ""conviction buy"" list, calling it ""one of the best risk/reward propositions in the Internet sector."" Goldman also said, ""We continue to believe Netflix's investment in content, technology and distribution will continue to drive subscriber growth well above consensus expectations both in the U.S. and internationally."""
Bottom line I've had Netflix forFREE 2.5 years. No revs from me.Used to be outstanding. Nowpretty boring. Actually PAIDfor a HBO MAX membership. 100% Satisfaction. If I owned this. I would be cautious ofpumping. Can't go up forever.
This should pop any minute now to 320
I sold 100 yesterday at $353...tempted to buy it back...
Netlifx bought a huge positive review campaign into IMDB.But The Witcher isn't a new GoT. Actually a far from it.

"Disney starting streaming service at $5 per month, lot lower than prime and netflix and is pulling all content from netflix"
You can see how the shorts are shivering on this board by reading their messages
"This stock could drop 70% and still be overvalued lol. It’s literally the biggest bubble in the stock market. Worth more than Ford, GM and TSLA combined with negative $3B cash flow"
here comes the rise
Don’t go down...
"NFLX will be above $300 this week!market normally up in March if down in Feb., historically speaking.Thursday and Friday market will calm down and move up nicely, so leading stocks, such as NFLX, AMZN,BA, will lead the upside parade. If this does not happen, NFLX may delay to climb above $320..."
"The 2 previous times the stock traded sideways for around 1 year, 2014 and 2016, it took back to back good ER to send the stock rallying to new highs. It looks like Q3 will be good with the help of Stranger Things and Q4 has always been their best quarter."
"""In the last 3 months, 34 ranked analysts set 12-month price targets for NFLX. The average price target among the analysts is $412.59.

"1. Let's pretend NFLX triumphs over Amazon, Disney, Apple, and Google in streaming and doubles its revenue to $23B.2. Let's pretend they do that without spending a single dollar more in cash flow than 2018.3. $12B in incremental cash flow to the projected -$3.5B FCF burn in 2018 is $8.5B4. $8.5B versus current Enterprise Value of $137B is just a 6.25% ROIC yield after achieving unprecedented success.5.

GREAT year ... NFLX up 67.11 %....
Expect the sugar high to die down next few sessions. Stay long on this one.

This is a technical trade from here since the fundamentals are way out of wack. Total double top. If the neck line dips below the start neck line is going to be very bearish. You could see another 30 points from there.
how someone will not buy this under 500?the whole world on quarantine sitting home watching Netflix while earnings report are on the way

I have a feeling that the week to come will either give me a $7,400 short term gain or we will be off to the races again. Thoughts????"

"NFLX TARGET RAISED TO $310.Netflix Poised to Extend Lead Despite Content Glut -- Barron's Blog2/2018- DJNFBy Jon SwartzDespite an increasingly crowded field for content, Netflix (NFLX) is poised to extend its content and distribution tentacles over the next 12 to 18 months.GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives bases his bullish assessment on Netflix's ""competitive moat,"" franchise appeal, ability to increase international streaming customers through 2020, and originalcontent. He gives it a Highly Attractive rating and raised its price target from $255 to $310 to reflect stronger-than-expected net subscription additions and international growth through 2018.Shares of Netflix are up 3% to $273.91 today.Ives expects Netflix to spend $7 billion to $8 billion on content this year, up about $1 billion from its spending trajectory for 2017. About one-third will go toward original content in 2018, with a long-term target of 50% by 2020.As more consumers eschew cable for streaming delivery, Netflix should anticipate heightened competition from larger media players such as Disney (DIS) and 21st Century Fox (FOXA), pure-play competitors such as Amazon.com (AMZN), and new potential entrants like Apple (AAPL).""The holy grail of incremental growth (and profitability) going forward will be from international customers as we believe Netflix has a [total addressable market] of over 700M subs by 2020,"" Ives wrote in his note. ""With the company spending major resources over the last two years building out a global distribution arm and customer base in over 100 countries, we believe the fruits of this labor will start to be fully realized in 2018 and beyond as evidenced again by the strong international performance in 4Q."""

"Some people are saying that NFLX earnings are not going to meet expectations, yet a majority of the nation (~328 Million), are told to stay home... while at the same time movie theatre’s are being shut down. Am I missing something here? To me this looks like a Great opportunity for NFLX to take over the market. They just bought out the Paris theatre in NYC so that they can begin to have their movies/shows receive Oscas, what makes you think they wouldn’t do the same with AMC or Regal? Someone please enlighten me because all I see is upside from here."
i bought 2 shares will not sell till it goes $0 at the most i will loose $700 but i will sell if it goes to $1000

"Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) 12-month price target was increased to $245 from $230 at MKM Partners on Thursday. MKM analyst Rob Sanderson raised his subscriber outlook for Netflix for 2018, saying the company has yet to reach its peak year for total subscriber additions. ""We continue to view Netflix as the large cap with the most potential for market cap appreciation over the next three to four years,"" Sanderson wrote in a note to investors. Sanderson said he expects Netflix to add 20.6 million subscribers next year, which is roughly in line with FactSet consensus of 20.9 million, but would be down from 2017 consensus of 22.0 million subscriber additions. This year was expected to be the streaming service's peak for subscriber additions, but Sanderson said it's more likely to come in 2019 or 2020. ""We think Netflix has a large first mover advantage, expecting to spend $7 billion to $8 billion next year, far more than any other programmer,"" Sanderson wrote."

"I just wanna say, now and the coming hard times in the market are not the time to be panicking, stressing and selling. view this as an opportunity to work hard at your jobs and earn as much money as possible to invest in every company you believe in at heavily discounted prices. you will be thankful down the road, you will be much wealthier than selling now. try not to take this on negatively, this is a chance that doesn't come often. yes I'm down 30% off my high point, and in time I hope to look back to this time and realize that the real money was made working hard and investing in this bear market"
"Ok, time to bounce back to where it was before."
Surprised it’s up so much given the revenue and eps. I guess subscriber numbers are good enough to offset. Congrats to those who had the nerve to hold through earnings. Given the last couple of quarters it was risky
They just hiked prices in Canada cool

Ahhh... NFLX. . Coming right back up to my favorite resting place. 300. Just with they had dividends.

Should see 35 - 50 shr increase.

Not sure if this stock will ever correct again? Its not allowed to go down I Dont think...
shorts are going to scramble to buy under 600. SQUEEEEEEZE!
"Is ""Bright"" so bad that now everyone's gonna want to watch it? Just to see what the negative hype is all about?"
Tomorrow $389
Nice close.
Charts show NFLX breaking out over $500 this year. Market cap is still very low relative to earnings and potential. This stock is still in the first or second inning of a great game still to come. There are few stories as exciting as NFLX. Perhaps TSLA is the other rare one.
"HAHAHA this will crash, they dont keep enough new shows and movies to sustain increases"
"Oh my! On this great news, The Cutied part 2&3 announced!"
New high this week or $340+!

"I told you to buy an hour after the market opened because by the then the fundies would have sold an the weak hands would have thrown in the towel. I bought only 300 shares but by the end of the day I am up $29 a share. If you panicked and sold learn a lesson from this. You got scared by the bad press, panicked and sold. You ended up doing exactly what the fundies wanted you to do so that they could buy your shares cheap."
Curious do people still buy NFLX at these prices? I was going to buy some put options but it is extremely expensive so I guess I am not the only one thinking this is going to drop hard in the next couple of years?
Heading to $335 and than $350 by the end of the week
I was down 156K at the open today. Bought 60 calls ($340 strike) at the open and came out with a 16K loss.
I'm down 20% ($20K) on a $100K investment here. I'm not sure this thing is going to turn around. Should I dump or wait for a turnaround? Everyday it gets worse and worse.

Netflix bubbleheads still in denial. NFLX’s grossly overvalued shares will lose 90% of their value.
I can't believe this thing is still going up after the news about many competitions. PE close to 100. I guess this company has a great backing from Wall Street.

This will drop back below $500 in a week
I predict earnings of $1.58 and 6.8 million new subscribers. 52 week high on Wednesday. Buy now.
"This will hit $550 by friday! No worries, have you seen the charts, option charts, and expected earnings! this is going to the moon finally."

Most valuable media company. LOL LOL
And the castle in the sky comes crashing down
"In 2016 Amazon, Hulu, and HBO combined sank 10 billion into content in an attempt to cut into Netflix’s lead. The stock stalled trading well below its high of 133 for over a year. Today Netflix is 342, yearly revenue has doubled since then and they’ve increased the huge lead they have in streaming. It’s time to face the music, Netflix competition is weak and will remain so as long as Reed Hastings is in charge."
"This is the start of Netflix. Netflix will become so cash flow positive and can fund almost any new content. That is the key. Do not forget the buybacks.Whoever is selling, thank you. Whoever is buying, good job."
Don't understand why this keeps ripping higher on more debt and weak guidance.

"This has to be setting up for some unloading tomorrow, be careful"

why do big companies announce earnings after hours?
this stock will double within 12 months - easy - This part of the FANG is back - probaly 650 to 700 by end of week - seen this so many times
It’s up 2$ after hrs
Humm why up 12 after hour?
And this is trading up why?
"I am not a fan of Zacks but they have a fair and balanced article about NFLX on the front page. Unlike garolou and other pumpers, they write about both the opportunities and risks. A couple comments caught my attention, First, I have been stating live sports is DIS ace in the hole. Zacks wrote ""Netflix is in for a major streaming battle for years to come. And let’s not forget that unlike Disney and Amazon, Netflix doesn’t have any plans to entice subscribers with other offerings such as live sports."" And then, as any fundamental investors knows the balance sheet matters, ""Plus, Amazon, Disney, and Apple all have much more money to pour into content."" (which I have been stating in debates with garolou over and over. So while NFLX has to borrown junk bonds at a high rate to produce this content, these other firms have cash sitting on their books. Don't but garolou's ridiculous point that it's too late or that AAPL, AMZN, DIS etc will not take a hit on earnings today. Firms INVEST in businesses all the time which means losses upfront and then gains later. Be careful listening to the pumpers on here. They aren't being nice to you, they are trying to manipulate you."
Dead cat bounce.
"getting back to where I bought it. I'm at a break even on this now, the other techs I own are still coming back up from the hit, my valuation puts the Nasdaq at a 50% discount to the s&p 500 and Dow. Needless to say it is a better buy than most other world markets. Easy buy for long term."
350 seems to be the top for a bit. Many people came in for that amount a month ago. Now they are selling. After that who knows how high it will go.
2nd TV broken
NFLX chart kinda looks like head and shoulders forming.
Will this be over 329 tomorrow in pre-market ? Or just a 1 day technical bounce ?
Will go green before noontime and climb from there.
I think I might drink a 40 of vodka before the market opens tomorrow. Things usually don’t hurt as bad when you’re hammered.
We are looking at a decisively higher gain in subscribers during 3Q earnings announcement on 10/16! $450 here we come!!!
Fed Raises Interest Rates and Signals Additional Increase in 2018... Sell
"new shows are horrible...whats up with all these yuppie soap operas & depressing sci fi shows....even their documentaries about crime & serial killers are boring, you can watch better stuff on youtube...their big budget standup comedy is atrocious, that #$%$ died 20 years ago.....FUBO is the future.....smart team that really understands enertainment & what people want out of streaming...."
"Hold long, hold strong"
"A little back of the napkin calculations: Current market cap = 221 Billion. With a discount rate of 4% that would imply average future earnings of ~8.84 Billion/year or ~5 times 2019 earnings. So, if NFLX doubled its subscribers AND doubled their subscription rate it still would not support the current valuation. Crazy, huh?"
for all share holders who bought NFLX around $400 please remember you don't loose anything if you don't sell it ..Just hold on to your shares and check back in 2-3 months you will be all fine ....panic sell you give your shares to market makers for free
Keep on moving !
"Something to keep in mind.....“For the full year 2020, we forecast [free cash flow] to be approximately $2 billion, up from our prior expectation of break-even to positive,” Netflix wrote. “We expect our FCF profile over the coming years to continue to improve as we increase our profitability and our transition to the production of Netflix originals matures.”And then:“With $8.4 billion in cash on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter plus our $750m credit facility (which is undrawn), our need for external financing is diminishing.”The exact numbers aren’t the important part. Here’s the bottom line: Netflix is no longer burning cash."
back to 550 perhaps?
Once again RIP to whoever bought at 580
It will go higher.
And as I said heading back to the stratosphere

"I LOVE the NEGATIVITY!!! Blood in the water BUY!!! FACTS(Inconsistent with this forum!) They are the only FANG NOT in the cross hairs of Congress, The ONLY Stock to BEAT on TOP/BOTTOM Lines and GROW Subscriber Growth! The only company that can Comfortably RAISE PRICES! N E X T!"
Open 302$ and close above 310$
The future is in free streaming with advertising. How well will NFLX make the transformation? People talk about them risings price... things get cheaper in todays tech era. Apple showed us increasing the price of the same product can be the kiss of death. Then you hear about the overseas growth and growth in general. All growth is priced in at this point. Also many weak retail investors buying what they know....the type the that run when they see shares sinking
NFLX is among the best games in town right now!
Why down?
Netflix is trading high just because of buying back news. Otherwise they are losing ground big time. They will face real competition from Disney!
"nice, overpriced Netflix with disappointing earning results actually might finish the day on a positive."
"if it goes above 400$ its time to short it again.Netflix will soon see tougher competitions from Apple, Disney.... and they wont survive this. Especially Disney streaming service will take a huge bite from the companies viewer base"
"So apple is not buying Netflix, I don’t see anyone buying Netflix until it’s stock price is below $ 50"
"On average $NFLX has dropped on Q1, Q2, Q3 reports, but has an average gain of 12% on Q4 reports. 390 on Friday!"
Tomorrow 350$ Friday 400$
How many more times am I going to hear that Disney+ only took 16 months what it took Netflix 14 years to reach 100M subscribers without any mention that Netflix started from scratch while Disney+ started with a whole library it took 100 years to build. Unbelievable.

Netflix Stock Market Gurus:Wall Street 2021On Facebook
Time for NFLX to go...
Did nflx sell user data. This question needs to be answered.
Morgan Stanley raises PT to $480 from $370
Got in with the hype at 513.00. Next Tuesday is the earnings report. Anyone who think it will break 540?
Do you think this will split
Well its up again in premarket. We need this to start ramping up as earnings are coming. Can we keep it Green today?
Zero upside to the stock market. At least 30% overvalued
"450 by Friday, going up"
Not getting out
"I sold to early, but I was thinking that they missed earnings and was down by 10+ cents from last year... Oh well!"
"Closed all my position on NFLX. bye, everybody. Good luck."
amazed it went back up so quick. I sold my nibbling shares in AH back around 358-360. Well congrats to longs. Did not expect it to be so strong.
"Sympathies to all those who sold. Likewise, congratulations to all those visionaries who bought and continue to hold. Onwards and upwards."
NFLX doesn't like higher interest rates.
"VIAC is a better buy - which one is more likely to go up 10-15% this month? Market cap is too high here now for consistent gains, and revenue growth is slowing down."
Will Netflix or HBO ($T) get more subscribers next quarter? Thumbs UP for Net Flix and Thumbs down for HBO......While I like NetFlix I actually believe that HBO will outperform on basis of their direct to streaming content strategy........

220 calls expiring. Bust through that and it will climb.
"I have given enough thought on what to do. Here is how my holding look2200 short Average price just below $260I just short 2 285 calls I had 15 265 cover put for (that I just cover. $260 average price including that profit).Now I have open 2200 short. I know just today I lost $20K, Total is $50K+ loss.I thought to give various option including start selling put aggressively But $CAT I end up long side while doing that which Company like CAT is fine. But not with NFLX where if Crash come, this can go to $100's easily. So I only left with 2 options.1.> Sell in money cover put but if sell off start this can easily below 260 and I regret it.2.> Sell out money Cover put which I will do it again if this go near 270.3.> Trade Stock, Given large number stock, this I think I can do with little risk. Read market sentiment and trade accordingly.4.> Forget and keep all open. (Which mean I wait for payday). Only problem is if this keep going up very soon I will get margin call."
Do the Bird Box challenge with buying stocks. Put on a blind fold and start clicking the mouse within your brokerage account...haha
I just watched Netflix again last night. Didn’t even bother looking up Disney app yet.
"LOL NFLX is on a roll- first Susan Rice, then the Obamas, now... ""A documentary chronicling the life and times of controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan will appear on Netflix in August."""
Shorty Shorts getting toasted. Better cover soon.
How are we looking for ER??!
"How is a single ""TV channel"" with 1/5 of the revenue and 1/20 of the profit be worth 90% of Disney? Is al this hype really about content? That is absurd, and while Netflix is a fine company, it is way overvalued. If it is all about content then Disney should be 5X the market cap of Netflix. Disney has a TV channel, plus they produce blockbuster films, they own Marvel, Star Wars (Lucas Films), Pixar, ABC and ESPN (additional channels that produce their own content); plus Disney has real assets - namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at $3-4 billion. But business is not all about content. That is just moronic hype. Business is about making money, period. Disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated. Make a princess movie that makes $100-300 million in profit, sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties, then charge families $400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in Orlando. Netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams. Any media company could easily start competing with Netflix just by streaming their content. Netflix doesn't own the pipe to its customers like Comcast who sells content and high-speed internet over the same cable, two income streams. Amazon does what Netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2-day shipping on just about anything you order. Netflix is absolutely overvalued and I think will trade below $100 within 2-3 years. It may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock. CBO market is not always right in the short-term, but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price."
soros made 2 Billion shorting this
after earnings released
This is now certified money order a gateway to play with the rich huge money flow on this.
DJ dropped -209 points in 30 minutes after opening. It will probably -400 point at closing today
Neflix golden Globe Nominations: 34 is the same as HBO (15) + Amazon (8) + Disney (6) + Hulu (5) combined. Think about that. Really think about that.
Single biggest indicator that Netflix will hit it out of the park on Monday is their Q2 guidance for 6.2 million subscriber adds. The previous high for a Q2 guide was 3.2 million. They really didn't need to guide that high unless subscriber adds were going through the roof.
Wow...and to think Blockbuster could've bought them for 2 million way back when. Imagine that.
One thing is for sure--Disney makes a lot of money off its movies. Nflx does not
I can’t stop watching Netflix. Amazing. People complain about a little increase. Lol too the moon selling half at 660
"Happy to say my Netflix profit has reached 962% having bought the first tranche in July, 2013. So in other words it took 5 years. Be a believer in this company and you will be rewarded. Good luck to all."
Roku confirmed how much streaming is dominating. And we all know the current King of Streaming. SimilarWeb just updated their data and december was a very big jump with 2.09 Billion web traffic that month. its not the apps just the netflix.com webpage. So if you are going to short this going into earnings its your funeral.
34m shorts will cover soon. No choice. Contracts are up Tuesday.
Super duper 600$ stock!
"A Quarter in the Life (of Netflix)The countdown begins, the excitement and anx (for those with a position) builds until both numbers are in view, subscriber adds and guidance for next Q subscriber adds. Then in a flash the stock moves, up as much as 40% (Q4 ER 2012) or down as much as 25% (Q2 ER 2014). The next day the excitement fades and once again all the longtime Netflix skeptics emerge to talk about PE, FCF, and debt until the countdown to the next ER begins."
Too many people buying put options expiring today. The machine keep it above $265 for maximum gain on the house.
Dow future up 400 + today no one can stop Netflix to fly $600 + Dow close today 1500 + point just wait
if you bought at $320 you're golden. wait for that $50 gains! I'm gonna go Netflix and chill 
wow...All of a sudden $382....This is impressive.
"what a volume today!, definitely tomorrow will be US$400"
volume is shot. largest open contracts again point to 550 strike for friday. VIX is poking it's head out. Exit now and enter back in 1-2 weeks later and catch the bounce look for as close to 500 but 520's might also be decent entry
"Big expectations for earnings means there will be a high chance of them not meeting those expectations. Limited upside, big downside, good luck to all."
"Heard Laura from Needham , not impressed about her logic on downgrade, too many if this happens and that takes place and then subs are lost to Disney and they come back and so on.. It is almost like everyone is lining up to cancel nflx subscription, all things have to go against Nflx but all goes well for Disney, too many speculative arguments to sustain the logic."
I only own 10 at 332.00 USA I'm Canadian love Netflix
Algos are cooling off but hype on street with retail investors is BUY BUY BUY... guess what? Algos are smart to find the vulnerability and we make a double top near 298 today... last chance to sell near 300 before results
NFLX moves up 9$ today. Yeah longs!! And mms
340 by the eod
I AM HOLDING A HUGE POSITION (seven digits). SO FAR -5% loss. Shall I sell or hold longer ? Thanks for advice!!!
Options writers win again.
"Hi In France, Netflix is becoming very popular, more and more people want it. And Netflix is taking the whole markete, no compétition"
I purchase October 2014. Today my gains reached 1000%. I remember the narrative back then was it was over priced. I bit the bullet and purchased. I’m ready for the next 1000% of this “overpriced” stock.
Sold mine took profit before it crashes down
will drop 30% from here
"Todd Gordon was on CNBC after whiffing badly on his short trade. He tried desperately to say it won’t break out to new highs. After slamming earnings/subs and guiding next quarter for more than expected subs! His take is nothing more than arrogant and self serving. Like most of these other so called “experts” who lowered their estimate into earnings, some people never learn. I trust RH! Congrats to all longs...see ya’ll at 500!"
"dont understand, why down so much premarket?"
"The smart money is headed to Chinese stocks. The Chinese market is 20% off it's high. Baba, JD, IQ, Huya, Bidu. All going up. Mark this post."
Here is goes! Shorties are sweating it.... but we warned them plenty.
"competitors are surrounded nfkx. if 30 millions subscribers moved to DISNEY, then at least 10million left nflx. A good earning report can lift up $5, but a bad report can drop -$30"
are we finally breaking out?
I laugh at this stock price every time I see it. I like Netflicks but ATT and Disney are going to crush them! Netflicks is borrowing more money than the y make to produce quality shows which makes them technically unprofitable. They will never turn a profit until that can significantly raise their monthly fee. I suspect the6 are going to soon see a significant drop off of there new subscribers which will be the end of there stock valuation. Tic toc remember AOL etc
This would be 375 had that POS Andrew Left not been given an open media forum to declare a short play.
way too sudden of a jump IMHO. wish I bought the dip but just shorted 600 shares for a quick gain tomorrow sell off it will most likely hit at the very least 540 easily hopefully 515 is the target though and then 500 buy into it if it hits that low. this thing always drops hard after such huge pop always.....
"Here is another aspect to look at NFLX subscriber raise.If you compare NFLX is favorite among teenagers/young people. Which other app has similar user group. SnapChat.SnapChat quickly raise their subscriber (Faster than any other Social Media) but now hardly have any growth. Reason unlike Adult/Old who take time to use new things, Teneger /Young people will immediately jump on trend.In other word, Netflix might growth 200M very quickly but I think it will have very very hard time to grow beyond that. There are lot of challenges.And any one think they can raise price to justify valuation. Look how cautious they are with small price increase. They yet to realize raise after 3 month for most of subscriber. They will only realize after next 3 month. This mean price increase is not easy."

"Everyone predicting the death of Netflix because of Disney plus, not sure if y’all have actually seen Disney’s + but for the most part it has extremely entertaining shows if you are under the age of 7. Also this 10 million subscriber number doesn’t take into account all the free one year trials. If something is free everyone will go for it."
"Study this list, study it twice. Netflix has 11 of the top 20 shows (4 of the top 5) on Rotten Tomatoes:https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv-list-2"
I would like to see $375 today
"Is this some kinda joke???? Under 500$..,, Why??????"
"Can't find any news on it, why is it popping on heavy volume? Thx"
goes to show trade with your gut not with people have to say they have their own agenda and everybody that was bashing was dead wrong.
"I will also predict NFLX will be $110 or less in 6 months time no Free Memberships means nobody to get suckered into giving up their credit card info and then forgetting about it just auto pay never looking at all the charges , well that will mean a lot less money coming into NFLX with all the played out material ."
"S&P volume is very low, and it's up like crazy, so I expect a deep deep drop next week"
STRONG BUY! https://cweb.com/2018/03/03/netflix-crosses-to-300-a-share-cweb-com/
I can't find any news for this kind of volatility that fast
Going up! $385
Time to sell or wait..... Hard to hold...
Thanks for the good run Netflix but I’ll be banking while I can.
420 tommorow!!!
Just buy Netflix and chill. This bad boy will be back in 400 land before you know it
Sell when others buy. Buy when other sell. Take profit before losing it
--Analyst Actions: Bank of America Lifts Netflix PT to $460 vs $352; Maintains Buy Rating
7% market correction is long overdue
If you wrote 320 puts Jan 11 today and bought 320 Jan 11 calls today You my friend will be making some money tomorrow. Around $2 million were traded today with those two options. Working at USB as an Analyst at USB not a bad job i guess :)
any one ever wonder how NFLX got to 220 P/E. It is like exactly like bitcoin manipulation. 90% of stock is instutation/private owned and only 10% is freely traded. Todays price is based on that 10% stock. Once the institution start to sell stock for profit NFLX will be steeply down like Crypto.
"And this is dropping why? Either it did well on its quarterly report or it didn't. Granted investors will take profits, but is there any rational reason beyond that for this to drop 5% in two days if the company is indeed doing well."
So the weekend action on the board tells me that the shorts had a nervous weekend. Just got back from a relaxing weekend and pumped for another awesome week for NFLX. Lets get this to $360 guys. It helps keep the shorts crying under their pillows and it is fun to see them hiding all day. Can I hear the longs give me a hell yeah? And any shorts who gave up are welcome to join and give me a hell yeah too :)? Lets keep the rally going guys and keep the shorts running.
STA research raised PT to 571
I hope it drops so I can buy more NFLX!
Pull back is coming
For every user there are 5 sharing their log in info.
SOLD all Shares today and went SHORT
Looks like Conservatives Boycotts of Netflix because of the OBAMA original content is working. Not good to mix Politics with business. We saw that with Starbucks.
Guess holding at 375 was a horrible move
"Anybody knows of a site where we can read and post serious messages on stocks? Most people on the yahoo boards sound like 15 years old. I am looking where we can exchange with people interested in sharing ideas, news, data.... Not sure a site like this even exists....."
1/24/18- Netflix stock price target raised to $330 at BTIG
NFLX will soon reach 90 million subs
"380, 390, 400 and so on don´t get trapped in bears"
Let see the after-hour... South or north.....
"Just bought another 300 shares, this will climb the rest of the week forsure"
This is probably going over 600. Very strong earning reaction. Usually this stock will find any reason to fade and sell off after earnings pop.
If they can grow to 200m subscribers they can spend more money on shows and movies then all the cable channels combined.
this company has built an efficiency that is almost as good as car that runs on water (maybe better).
Friday 13... Most stock red... Jason is coming to town.
"Disney Lost 1 Billion dollars in streaming which wont start until later this year and it wants to compete with NFLX? What a joke! The media company , Disney, said in a filing on Friday that its investment in Hulu was the primary contributor to a $580 million loss in equity investments in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Additionally, Disney lost $469 million in its direct-to consumer-segment, largely from BAMtech, the streaming technology that powers ESPN+ and other over-the-top services."
Easy 370 soon
Hello YAHOO!! Quotes are not updating.
370 coming big block buys
"Wait, so now I gotta tell the boyfriend of the mother of my nephew's girlfriend's sister that he can't use my password anymore? Thanks a lot, Netflix."
Target $1000 !
It will go up tomorrow
"It will finish above 370 today, 380 by Wednesday"
"Shorts are active again. Love that sooo much. Means they get scared and know what is going to happen, Buy back with a big loss."
NFLX going higher and buying AMRN rocket Upside
295 this week...
Dumping cable for Netflix... makes sense !Why would anyone pay like almost $100.00 for cable television ?? ... and your monthly bills keep going up too/.Netflix have a bright future..
Netflix is the best of the streaming services. I have all three and Netflix is the easiest to navigate and use. Amazon seems to rent everything and Hulu has commercials. They will do well. But those unbelievers can always put a stop loss in the account just in case the worst happens.
This is not the point where you should be shorting this one. It has a long history of trading like this for a few days and then wham it goes back into high gear. I had been watching this stock since its inception. Wish I had bought it back then. It used to be 50 ten years ago prior to many splits. Even three years ago it was pretty low and one time I bought it and it just kept going down. When it went down from 330 to 305 I got out (it was before 1:3 split in 2013). And here we go.
52 week high coming by the end of the month. Today's turnaround is awesome.
this will hit 600 tomorrow hopefully split 10-1and we buy lower.........
The banks wants you to sale you shares tomorrow so they can pick it up at a lower price don’t do it.
Netflix new hollywood. See you at 550.
$345 after earnings next Monday.
It's up 40 cents AH. I'm surprised people aren't calling for new all time highs by week's end.
"We entered a secular bear market in october. Extreme high valuatuons (NFLX), low interest rates, high debt, low wages is what started this trend. The breakout of the markets in 2013 was not one based on organic economic fundamentals but rather through massive monetary interventions by Central Banks globally. The previous secular bull markets in our history we ones which were derived from extreme undervaluations, washed out financial markets, and extreme negative sentiment."
NFLX buying AMC..? Interesting news especially with shorts stretched at over 60% short on AMC..((((((((( BOOM )))))))))
March 29.... $320 Calls ...easy money...$$$$$
Next stop 350
New Streaming ETF SUBZ started trading today and one of the top holdings will be NFLX

Going to FLY tomorrow.. fasten your seatbelts gentleman.
CLASSIC shakedown
It will touch 340
All aboard next stop 350
No Bama...!!!! Is what the market is saying.
is now the right time to get in?
All in
Wonder if signing pacts with Michelle Wolf and Obama has turned off a segment of viewers that normally would have signed up/stayed with Netflix. Saw the latest promo clip on ICE by Wolf and could see where her political controversies could hurt Netflix subscriber growth with Middle America.
It's expensive now. I see a buy around 350
"Looks like the 'cuties' controversy has passed. Americans are so over-reactionary. I only saw clips, and if anything, I'd say it did a public service by making parents aware of what some of their innocent little tweens are actually doing online."

"if the same chart pattern as yesterday holds, it will close near the low of the day which is $360"
3 million shares in 45 minutes. That is heavy volume
Netflix outperforming the market and other fangs this week. This could be the start of something good.
People have said this stock is all about subs and they are right But it’s also the reason I won’t buy here. The first half of 2021 is a tough compare.
Netflix = Netscape
"Wow!! I am so glad I walked away from buying puts on this stock since the last earnings - just looked again this morning. What A GIFT above 400... for put options - And the guy with the new 500 price target saying that NFLX was the Lebron James of Content (as part of his 500 price target justification).. spoke to me that the END is near for both NFLX and AMZN... You know what I'm talking about if you paid attention in ""how to value a company"" class..."
Mr Left is laughing all the way to the bank today.
so my $305 prediction turned out to be right. only it happened after hours....

"It was the best day yesterday. Finally got out of a lot of stocks. I was waiting for the opportunity. I am a bit skeptical about this job report. If the government is not working, who compiled this report? I think it was a political stunt to arrest the market fall by Trump administration. If the manufacturing index came out so bad showing manufacturing shrinking, it seems counterintuitive to think that the manufacturers would be adding jobs. Anyway, cash is the king right now. Will wait for opportunities."
"Discussion: NFLX $500 at end of 2018?What does Mr. Cramerica thinks?AAPL, AMZN , Disney - Wake-Up, Take-Over - BuyImagine all that World Subscribers, These are Leads (Contacts), $$$$$$$NFLX should start using Advertisements, $$$$$$Include Gaming's, $$$$$$Gambling, $$$$$$Shopping, $$$$$$Lots of ways to MonetizeIts Infinity"
This is a double short covering rally when its over there be exactly ZERO buyers and it will drop below 290 again

NFLX earnings right around the corner. Bought a year ago at $278 so this hasn't been a great year so far but looking to sell at some point over $300. GLTA.
Netflix to $400 today!!! $500 tomorrow! $600 Friday
Going bullish due to international expansion which Netflix virtually has no meaningful competition

NFLX today going back again to 375$
Go ahead and sell.. it’s just gonna rise.. this is AH.
Last chance to buy under 420!!!!
I got out just in time TY Netflix for my new 2018 Jeep
green soon and big green later
It is recovering.
Patience please. The stock was 3 when they launched streaming 13 years ago. At 486 it is above its long term trend line which has been going up 46% a year.
Very good news. Netflix is hiring Colin Kaepernick .He will be paid 25 mln and will be a member of the board with Susan Rice..I am buying in the morning
"Here is reason stock raise $10 for nearly flat market.After revisiting expectations for Netflix Inc.'s (NFLX) international subscriber growth, Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak upped his 12-month price target to $400 from $300. Shares of Netflix, after hitting a record close on Monday, were up more than 1% in early Tuesday trade. Wlodarczak increased his long-term international subscriber forecast, expecting the streaming giant to hit 250 million international subscribers by 2024, up from 230 million. In its most recent fourth-quarter earnings report, Netflix said it had 62.8 million international subscribers. ""The company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle, as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can spend on original content, which increases the potential target market for their service and dramatically increases barriers to entry,"" Wlodarczak wrote in a note. ""All else being equal with the broader markets, as long as Netflix continues to beat and raise on subscribers we believe the stock will continue to work."" Wlodarczak also raised his long-term expectations on average revenue per user as Netflix displayed pricing power after its most recent price hike had little to no negative impact on subscriber growth. Shares of Netflix have gained 122% in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 index is up roughly 15%.Here are red flags on his analysis:-This analyst see 250Million subscriber suddenly jump from already increase 230 Million count for no reason. Now from 67M to 250 Milion in 6 year, each year they need to add 30M+ subscriber. Now looking into US short history, This is unlikely. Remember Most english speaking developed Foreign country reaching saturation point. Non English speaking, There isn't much content and with licensing cost increases and focus on own content that gap will get wider not smaller.Now Value:- Clearly reaching 250M mean not much growth left. And then company likely issue $30B+ stocks over 6 year period. at current price that mean it will value at $160B + likely $20B debt so $180B enterprise value.with 250M international you will have 320M total (70M is beyond peak I think but just get over optimistic) $10M = $36B revenue, They likely spending $20B on content (Only way they can reach 320M subscriber is spend lot more on content) , $5B on marketing , $5B on servers and $2b-3B on other = $33BIn other word still generate $3B profit. Even if we raise subscription by 20% it still likely <$10B profit in 2024..If you give 20 PE and discount 35% (Growth rate), You still comeup with <$150 fair market price."
getting closer to $199 and still a big bubble stock with huge debt.
Investors may be pleasantly surprised with earnings - new subscription pricing is included in this reporting quarter - which is approximately 10% higher subscription pricing
Predictions for tomorrow?I'm thinking close of $395.00
Don't try to find a bottom as it is much lower than this. Keeps making a new low...
You guys think this will recover within the next couple days?
"BOA JUST RAISED TO 460$ AND MAINTAINS A BUY RATING, WE HITTING 420$ TODAY BOYS!"

From buy to hold
Fundamentals don’t matter......Until you offer 1.5 billion in Junk bonds.
Below 500 soon
nflx must has a lot of customers and a lot profit these times because almost all europe has quarantined last weeks. So i think earnings will beat the expectations.
bought some puts for tomorrow. probably see a consolation before hitting new highs.
netflix to hit 625 this time around.
I have Netflix sharing between 4 families at $2.75 per month. It is so cheap. Everyone I know already has Netflix. I wonder how they are going to get new members in US.
SOCIALISM does not work...

At one time AOL metrics and market cap were eerily similar to NFLX.As subs started declining AOL went from 300 a share to 2$ in a matter of a year!Hilarious fact!
All time high in 2 months?
"Before Apple can win competing against Netflix they have to win against Hulu, Amazon and HBO who all have much more content than Apple."
Netflix will be 150 per share at the end of 2019.

"I read most bullish article about Netflix in seeking alpha. Who thinkin 2021 - Netflix will have 143M international paying customer, 75M usa paying, Subscriber cost raise 20% , and expect interest cost will go lower than current, margin will double, will trade at 48 pe.All combine he still value company at $408 in 2021. then he argue trade $300 based on 10% discount model.Now Risk reward analysis of his way optimistic number still make this stock work $200 in my opinion. Sure if it continue grow even after $DIS entry and without disney content, could worth $400 in 2021 But that 3 year out. Why pay so much premium now."
Nice pickup on dip in premarket. Easy $340 today. Thanks Citigroup.

$AMZN $AMC $NFLX 
"this is henry blodget, you don't upgrade after 20% move before earnings"
"The remaining pumpers and bag-holders just want to get out desperately to sell you their expensive shares, this is definitely a sell the news event with the extremely poor guidance."
Disney says their streaming service won't compete with Netflix. That makes sense because all the streaming services that are competing with Netflix are losing a lot of money.
Shorts making things worse for themselves
NFLX either has too many DVD subscribers or not getting enough disks. I've been a customer for years and now with 37 titles on my queues I can get even one shipped!
"RIP to whoever bought at 580, she be droppin soon"
And it don’t stop...and it won’t stop.
it will possibly be green by tomorrow lol
I feel like this is going to be a 45.00 run today. Buy buy buy. Apple don’t have anything on Netflix. THE KING IS BACK I LOVE NETFLIX
OH YEAH! also support at 209The 200 DMA
I told you 5 days ago $320 was coming.
"I think COVID 19 is behind us now. There should be more lock downs coming with COVID 20(UK strain) and a new vaccine will be needed so $TDOC, $AMWL, $AMZN, $AAPL, $ZM, $FB, $NFLX should continue to do well"

Staying above 271
"I can safely claim: if NFLX does not innovate revenues from other business, NFLX will not come back for at least 2-4 years!"
I carry a 50% open % gain on Netflix! Why would I panic over a -2.25% one day drop! Let's have this same discussion in 3 years!
Someone earlier said apple wants to buy Netflix anyone
If you want to trade it. Always notice after a decent underperform day vs. Nasdaq...this always trails lowers for the next 4-5 days.
Crossed $370 today - we have resistance -- we hope:)The next time you see a $50.00 drop - remember BUY BUY and smile
calls up 500% right now!! Wow
Rising today like the White Walkers
And next week good news will be?
"$4.99 from Apple, cancelling my netflix..."
Technically this stock needs to back fill down to 310.05 before making a run to higher highs. (Weekly candle chart). Red on a day when the Nasdaq is green +31 isn't confidence building. See you at 301
"After rising 24% for the week it closes right on the high. Year over year subscriber growth remains unchanged at 25% after raising prices and investors continue to figure out what it means. For instance, Netflix could double it's subscription fees and settle for only 5% subscriber growth. In a year revenue would be 30B/yr, profit before tax would be 16B/yr and PE 7. Adjust for a normal PE of 20 and the stock would be 785. We could see the stock continue to spike next week."
So freeloaders are upset they are getting caught ? 
About time to see some green after 4 long days of nothing but red. This really needs to finish over $362 today.
Why would anyone waste their time telling people how bad a stock is? LOL Thank you for looking out for everyone. ;)
"It was only a couple weeks ago when the shorts were posting that they shorted at $180, $190, $200. Hahaha"
"Last year almost same time I start buying Netflix around 290$, it went down to 245 if I dont make a mistake, at the time I had 85 stocks and was nervous because I lost so much money on it, however I sold my stock few month ago around 345$, now same as last year, start buying at 310$ and latest batch was today that bough few at 253$. I know will enjoy at least 10k return in 2 to 3 months."
Back to 360 next week
Hey @BD it's a green day for Netflix and I still think it's a bad investment due to competition growth and over inflated PE. My opinion has nothing to do with Netflix having a red or green day. I won't touch the stock either way. https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianmorris/2018/05/04/hulus-incredible-growth-is-bad-news-for-netflix/
As stated. You need an iron gut to hold a lot of shares in this stock. The moves are TREMENDOUS...both ways.
Did you ever hear about (http://Multistockalerts.com)? They just covered NFLX this AM
"Wow , great .."
Thumbs up if you have a good feeling about this round. I do.
So today's plan is to PUMP $NFLX and Nasdaq BUBBLE to new record ABSURD Highs every minute with Falling Earnings...
I shorted 300 again at 322. Again 1200 short and My Average is $308 for short. Plan to cover 300 at 317.I decide to trade instead selling put because stock moving very fast and once I sell cover put can't do trading. I also hold couple $320 Calls with $1K premium. I am hoping it expire out of money. But May sell couple of put for those soon in order to limit my looses.

what's the expected closing price?
435 is the next resistance.
NFLX $560 coming soon! just look at the past 2 earnings and the channel that this stock has been trading!
Terrible situation with tech. Looks like 2000 or 2008 all over. I see no bottom. Sorry. Wish I did because I hold tech.
Mouse is old news. Netflix rules content. Watch for $300+ by end of this month. $350 after earning.
"News of record number of subscriber adds after raising prices keeps on giving, and why not, nobody has ever done it."
Hearing that $AMC is possibly coming out with streaming service to compete with $NFLX
Wow
So they reported an in-line revenue # but blew away subscriber estimates. This makes no sense. If analysts got the revenue # correct how did they under estimate the sub #? One answer: all the excess subs are promotional and non-paying. If they convert to paying then next quarter it is fine.
Can anyone explain why this is down after hours
More room to fall
Double top - Selling into this
Parabolic Movement. Remember bitcoin ?Netflix Boeing AMZN NVDA Just to name a few 
Would be very nice if Netflix continues this momentum today. If it continues to outpace the market it will hit green quicker
"P/S of PTON 750% more expensive than NLS. NLS 22” screen treadmill and new bikes and software are incredible. NLS market cap is 5,000% cheaper than PTON. MONSTER BULL Nautilus.

Oh my going above 380 today. Break and see you at 400 tomorrow
There went the best Netflix Series!https://deadline.com/2018/11/daredevil-canceled-netflix-3-seasons-1202511521/
INDIA!
Watch for a complete reversal. We will over $275 by end of this week and $300 by earning.
"Earnings run coming this week, might hit 440!"
my wife told me to buy 50 more shares when it dropped and I didn't do it.
Any guess on opening price for tomo?
Looks like nobody wants to hold it. All good things...
"Let's see, should I go to the doctor, be able to buy groceries, put gas in the car, or buy NFLX? Which one do I cut out of the family budget in a recession?"
EASY MONEY!!!!
a stock that missed top and bottom is buy or selllll?
"Wow NFLX over $400 , Time to Buy IQ rocket"
What a come back 
looks like it held up strong
"Up $4.60 already in the premarket, nice upward pressure, we’re gonna see $410+ today."
When is best time to get in ahead of earnings today or Monday ?
Excitement is nice just like the horror movies on Netflix 
whoever bought in premarket - raise your hands :) What a rebound? Netflix is not going anywhere
"At Netflix old subscription pricing I did not really care if I watch it or not, but now it is so expensive I have to think if I really need it?"
So the price increase sounds like a response to an earnings miss.
I hope for 550$ soon.Very disappointed from the stock
Next step is to raise the sub fees. Need more free cash flow without relying on debt!!
Will back to 400 soon who with me?...
Every time we clear 370 massive selling comes in. Have to take out the seller and close over 375. I wouldn’t be surprise if we make another run today and/or tomorrow.
Disney vs Netflix for long term hold? Thoughts? 
3 months ago NFLX was trading at $329. What is the big deal if drops to $350
$DIS just blew past subscriber growth. $CURI is next!! $NFLX here we come!!
Fair Value $20
This stock is a joke. Everyone knows that everyone uses someone else password. That is not a paying subscriber. I know i wouldnt pay for nflx.
Time to shine don't bother with amc gme koss they are all going to crash hard .....Buy netflix a legitimate solid company
"subscriber growth is slowing down, misses expectation by a wide margin"
up
"With Netflix releasing original series and movies on what appears to be a daily basis the fear of competitors, who can’t release 10% of that amount of content, is a way overdone. I would even go as far to say it’s all hype driven by news outlets owned by the media companies."
Bulls always fall for bull traps. That’s why cows often get eaten by bears 
"Never been so confident shorting Netflix, am pretty sure it don’t have big upside and sure it will in 200s sooner or later"
You all going to wish you bought yesterday when it was low. 10% up today. Green Day. Positive into the end of the year
ZM stays on strong with news. NFLX should follow the same foot steps by next week. I still have 100 percent confidence it would fly high by next week. Just got 50 more shares at 537.25. Hold long. ....
NFLX stock is pretty resilient today. Lets see how the final 30 minutes goes.
Was doing great until they brought in Obama and Rice... I wonder why...
"Monday afternoon buy put option, thank me next day"
There is a definite seasonal trend - in 9 of the past 10 years Netflix has closed higher over the upcoming 35 days with an average gain of 26.9%
Slingshot!!! just bought 300 more baby! $520 EOD
"Netflix is making the same play Apple made. They are increasing their prices to result for lowered subscriber numbers. Look how well that worked for the iPhone and Apple stock.Not to mention they released this info days before their earnings report. Companies do that to give a buffer of good news to mitigate the damage a bad ER will cause, otherwise they'd just give the news during the ER."
Why Are Analysts Positive toward Netflix despite Its Q2 Miss?http://marketrealist.com/2018/07/why-are-analysts-positive-toward-netflix-despite-its-q2-miss/?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=feed&yptr=yahoo
CNBC not a mention of NFLX high or 300
"If Netflix eventually reaches 1 billion subscribers, and I don't see anyone impeding them from doing that, then 195 or 325 or 425, they're all very cheap."
lets see on friday its gonna be a rocket
"I’ve seen worse with other stocks, Dell and CSCO, in early 2000’s, NFLX will bounce back, 15% drop after earnings isn’t that bad. Netflix is a solid company."
"NFLX is half the market cap of Boeing, welcome to casino street !"
well this isn't good. .26% after GOOG's report? Doubting my trade now. Needs to finish green today or watch out.
Big up day tomorrow to 330-334. Then up all next week into earnings. Then great earnings and great guidance for 2019. What a great time the next 2 weeks will be. Happy Happy Joy Joy ! ! ! ! 400 in a month. then question will be: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
"Futures are way up, so much for predictions of WW3 and a big drop in the market, Nflx will open up +10 tomorrow and climb from there. Congratulations to all you Longs that bought on Friday!!"
"if it turns green today, that will be a big plus."
Why pay NFLX while Amazon Prime give you all for FREE?
Elect Prediction...?? am I seeing Green....and RED....;+)

"As a top analyst I rate this stock overweight, strong buy, with a bullish outlook. — Goldman Snacks"
"Most of the subscribers are from through third party vendor, like Verizon and Sprint and T-Mobile that bring no money so even very conservative EPS and ER missed.You can mute me but can’t mute truth. "
P/E 258 —- spends $12 Billion in content it doesn’t even own. Big quarterly burn
Netflix will be back to $400 in 30 days.
Hey! I'm holding some stocks that I bought two weeks ago when the price was way better! Are you selling or holding? Or buying new?
Haven't heard any genius analyst upgrades lately. What happened?
FORTNITE X STRANGER THINGShttps://www.cnet.com/news/epic-teases-fortnite-x-stranger-things-event/

The suspense waiting for NFLX earnings is better than anything on NFLX.
"As far as I know, Netflix hasn't lowered guidance, so they would come out w/ blockbuster earning tonight.NFLX would pop up to 430.00 after hours/tomorrow, and those selling will eat dust.Buy, buy, buy, buy!!!!"
"I think today was a test just to see if it can even hold a green day. If markets are good tomorrow we may see a proper gain. If markets are bad tomorrow then, per usual, NFLX will have an exaggerated drop."
328 coming

Why didn’t Netflix wait until earnings call to announce the raise in subscription prices? Is it a warning the sub numbers are low?
$1000 in three months or so:Long base of NFLX price consolidation means huge upside!
Market correction usually last about a full year and it started in July so if you’re invested for 5 years minimum why are you worried?
The stock will be up 100+ on news they will enter sports and advertising.
310 by end of week?
Such irresponsible upgrades they gave on this beloved stock.
"I'll probably cancel my account if they crack down on password sharing. I travel and so do other members of my family. We don't watch Netflix in our home and if you're asking what streaming service I'll use, I'll probably use a different one a month. Watch all the new movies and catch up on Netflix shows then cancel it, get HBO for a month and cancel it, Hulu for a month cancel it...."
"poor Disney, they were better off getting their own channel on Netflix and staying in front of 160M and growing"
No business will go constantly. There will be speed bumps along the way. This is a speed bump.
