the new competition for netflix won’t stand a chance these companies don’t have experience running streaming let alone movies and now they also have to be profitable in a few short years or run out of funds the only real contender is disney but in order to compete they have to shut down traditional revenue source so they can use their content inhouse the headwinds for disney is simple they plan to launch in 2020 but just like any new business they will fumble around for about 1 year before they find some normalcy on their operations and that’s going to be 2021 now at that point they will use up all their popular content by 2021 and will have to rely on new onesand thai is the tricky one as now they can’t profit much from it as they have to use in their streaming disney will run the streaming service at a loss for at least 5 yearsthat 2026 folkscan you handle that as an investor

nflxamong the worst stocks you should hold upside is thinwhile downside is hugesell any rally
my two centsnet neutrality will matter eventually and matter in a big way because as someone said on bloomberg 12 of the bandwidth on the internet is netflix that may or may not be true if it is even half true its a big deal prices go up to nflx margins get squeezedand even before this change nflx was 3 times too high at least im seeing 130 for nowhowever manipulation might take it higher due to the tax thing though they dont make money so it shouldnt but it mightbe careful shorting use pieces and stops and eventually you will make a killing i thinktrade the chart though instead of gambling because of the potential for manipulation ive seen that a lot of times the effect isnt here yet they are still messing with it they can use it to kill shorts the hedge funds i meanbut eventually and obviously the cost comes to nflx that is already heavily debt burdened and the fox disney thing is a big negative as well as disney doing streaming along with google with youtube and others competition in that market doesnt sit stillnow go look at the pe i trades so thin that big money needs to get out while they can so it could crash there is a recession coming as well

netflix has always beat subscriber expectations whenever it releases the first season of a big hit original series the queen’s gambit is one the biggest of them all
this is a repeat of year 2000 dot com bubble
this was there strongest quarter from seasonality perspective they also tend to always do well and fcf is to be expected in light of stay at home environment that said this stock isnt a value play its supposed to be growth play will new subscribers be sustainable even if they pull out great content i think netflixs best days are behind it and absent diversifying their business model probably is range bound at best
anyone buying at this level

all exuberance aside we need to consider that nflx   added lesser subscribers in us added lesser foreign subscribers had smaller revenue than forecast  piled up 15 billion more loan  gave weaker guidance for next q  is facing more competition everyday  yields on their bonds rose 174 basis points i was bullish too in the past but which investor not trader would feel safe buying at this point 
monster miss
i have a great feeling about today
increased valuation by almost a full year of revenue talk about crazy thats like mfst going up 110b in one day gamble on

the market opportunity is huge but so are the potential competitors hard to see amazon google and even the legacy content producers ie disney not eating into this in a more meaningful way shortly only so much money to go around seems like this is priced for no hazards competitive or economic i would sell or stay away good luck all

netflix price target raised to 650 from 640 at morgan stanley overweightmorgan stanley analyst benjamin swinburne raised the firms price target on netflix to 650 from 640 and keeps an overweight rating on the shares media remains very cyclical and he expects 2021 to be a year of topline strength said swinburne while he thinks netflix has been perhaps the most positively affected by covid tailwinds given the longterm benefits from shifting streaming behaviors the stock has not seen any multiple expansion said swinburne who sees the potential for netflixs margin expansion to break out beyond the 300 basis points per year level to which the company has guided

heard laura from needham  not impressed about her logic on downgrade too many if this happens and that takes place and then subs are lost to disney and they come back and so on it is almost like everyone is lining up to cancel nflx subscription all things have to go against nflx but all goes well for disney too many speculative arguments to sustain the logic

on dis balance sheet find where they value content then compare it with nflx content dis has prixar disney childrens movies stat wars marvel lions gate etc whose content looks overvalued this content cost is amortized over time and makes up nflxs largest expense so by slow walking the amortization you make the company look more profitable what does nflx have in content that would total 9b in value

netflix is the new hollywood i don’t get why theres so many shorts on this board investors know netflix will be around in 20 yrs and it’s currently stealing all of the cinemas best writers and actors if you’re not making a superhero movie you go to netflix if you want to make an hbo series independently you go through netflix the company had too many hooks in the industry and it will be the number 1 studio
what you all think will it best earnings and stock will jump
nflx or tsla which one is better potential in the short term
been a subscriber of nflx since 2004 back when it was through the mail dvds only did the math to calculate my 100ish monthly subscription fee one the last 16 years had i invested that rather small amount up front in 2004 and say i picked a day when splitadjusted netflix was trading at 2 a share id have turned the 1600 investment into 257k did something similar with apple bought a 3k mac pro in 2003 intending to make money editing off of it instead had i invested that 3k in the stock in 2003 at splitadjusted 1 a share id be sitting on 840k so the lesson i learned is invest in whatever 20 year olds are buying they know the future
17m new subscribers
nflx will reach  360 by the close today
nflx is going to be the next cmg subscribers i know are cutting the cord i did a year ago after a year youve seen everything nflx has to offer
it will stop at 373 today
shorties are sweating it now with this upward pressure
honestly if i watch an hour or two of television a day it is on netflix i get to watch whatever i want when i want it is that simple my kids go crazy if i turn on direct tv now because they dont get why there are only certain shows on at any given time netflix could double its rates tomorrow and i would still keep the subscription and im probably not the only one
netflix has a stockpile of cash in hand they cannot lose if they see a decrease in income they can reduce the number of shows they produce and save millions the big funds manipulate this stock with news but long run its gonna be a great stock if theres no minus in front if eps its a winner

discovery just announced a new streaming serviceand many more companies doing the same do you think it’s been their plan to do this all along as part of a broad company strategy these companies are forced to adjust their business model because of the netflix effect what we are witnessing is the demise of an old industry and the rise of the new the companies who adjusted years ago has a better chance of survival than the companies who pivot just now

look at that trailing pe114 ridiculous so people are buying at these prices hoping that nflx will generate 10x the eps they have right now netfflix will make 10x the earnings its making now to bring the pe down to a reasonable 14 odds are way stacked against that just not going to happen
why down  did we get another downgrade

not sure if this stock will ever correct again its not allowed to go down i dont think
everytime i want to jump in it goes up more and more and more
big concern here is if wall street cuts off the money to nflx big timedisney has tons of bucks big difference in the long haulno bucks no content no profits poof
sell or hold until monday im down big i bought at 347 please advise
lets face it hbo max is going to have better content next year
everyone feeling better now have the calls for the public hanging of mr left subsided
monday afternoon buy put option thank me next day
dont listen to cramer listen to ur research
i still say 390 by end of week
shorties your last chance to cover now  thanks for pushing up the share price you are very welcome to return again and again
the fact that the market is going down and netflix maintains that 13 proves how strong the buying is
there you go  brexit vote turmoil hitting stock market
when would this recover 12 years i am long since it’s peak around 390 and wonder if it’s time to limit loses and move on or let it be if good earnings and subscription growth did not move this stock up what will
this move looks to me like nflx is ready to raise funds again
betting my retirement on nflx and boeingperiod i will sleep well owning these two

i actually get what this company is trying to do i really do their plan is to build up an enormous library of original content so they dont need to pay as much for licensing fees and also build up a huge base of subs while doing so if all goes according to plan theyll eventually reach a point where they dont need to spend as much on content because they already have a massive library for subs to watch also theyll eventually want to up the rates and that will be pure profit for them assuming it doesnt drive off too many substhe problem is that their current valuation is already taking into account the best case scanario what happens if rate increases drive away subs what happens if competition takes away subs what happens if subs just bing watch all the original content and then still demand more constantly i just dont see where the remaining upside is here
bought as much as i could today so sweet

so all the cheer leading over the weekend might have created this artificial move higher and the cheer leading includes the white house its really hard to trust at this point what to do here is the question i feel like this should be much higher as well  perhaps fund managers are dumping into strength we will see meanwhile finger on the trigger to sell if we are in a bear market then share prices will be brought lower during earnings for many techs regardless of the numbers just my 2 cents
375 high by tomorrow 380 high by 26th 385 high by 27th and 392 high by july 30th resistance between july 30th and august 3rd at levels of 387 and breaking slightly up to 390 in short great upside froma 36425 position and right now we are looking at an entry of 355huge support at 35555 and guess where it is now 35555 buy now

after like 7 years we just dropped netflixcontent is not so good we went to hulu1299 and going up bye bye netflix
what a frustrating period with this stock
so as inflation and more importantly interest rates go up how does that impact netflix earnings interest on debt is a huge  of their expenses so rising interest rates would seriously hamper their profit growth expectationsnot a shorter just sharing my thoughts
with all the suspense over subscriber growth heading into the er we know its by far the most important thing for netflix then it also has to be the most important thing for netflixs competitors netflix competitors dont have that much subscriber growth so if netflix adds 1 or 2 million more subscribers than expected then it makes sense the stock can gap up 1020 and trade at a new all time high price to sales ratio because there are no competitors that are doing the same
international subscriber adds in q2 could surpass previous record of 636m in q4
todays close price complies with the statistics that for the past nine red fridays the following mondays dropped 123 in average
netflix borrows big to produce original content which was feasible until now with low interest rates with rising interest rates and its rising debtequity ratio big investors know the problem and will be ready to sell dont be fooled by the 500 price target its just a dangling carrot few big players already took some profits when it tested piperjaffray’s 420 price target on june 21stthis bounce above 400 is another chance for you guys to sell sell sell 413 is the next level when it may turn negative and go down to 371
no one is safe anymore

netflix has huge upside i wont be surprised if it closes over 450 by the end of next week
another buy opportunity loading up
bring on the upgrades
so disney  has 85 m subscribers in year and has several new titles coming out this year netflix seems outmatched added 30m in the same year with a 6 year head start they could catch netflix next year in total subscribers
time to switch to a real earner like nvidia
disney now has all of foxs content and will most likely pull all of it from netflix when it launches its own streaming service there will be very little good quality shows on netflix and people will have to choose between different platforms which will put pricing pressure on subscription fees growth for netflix is having some major headwinds which will undoubtedly affect the share price

folks the pe is still up around 170 down from around 250 it needs to fall by a factor of 10 for this to be fairly valued
for all of you shorting it i think you are a little late to the party
i would never a fan of any stock if i feel the story has changed i’d be looking for opportunities to sell but the story here is as bright as ever today we got another upgrade and great news on queen gambit now if anything i’d be more likely to want to add shares on this news additionally we had unusual options activity on dec 520 calls stock price action isn’t good right now but that just means it’s a good buying opportunity
looks like this may finally be breaking out of its rut
450 this week possible

nflx shares are owned by every major banks in the us including the top 10 banks from chase to bank of ny mellon and these stable institutions which owned 80 of nflx stocks are examples of the largest holders of nflx to name a few namely crg investors 41000000 shares vanguard 30000000 shares blackrock 27000000 shares fmr llc 25000000 shares statestreet 16000000 shares and the average daily trading volume is only 11 million shares which is less than 10 of the entire number of nflx shares only 20 or 87 million shares worth 36 billion are owned by individuals source nasdaq these institutions usually rebalance their portfolio every june so june has passed these institutions are not prone to selloff for example with the ge stock vanguard maintains to own 600 million shares of ge and blackrock maintains to own 500 million shares of ge even ge fell from 26 to 13 why they did not sell them there was no sec records that vanguard or blackrock bought or sold ge stocks so will these institutions be triggered for a nflx selloff thus spiralling the nflx price to half its a possibility but the chances of not happening is greater in may 2002 nflx  121 and it has survived the great recession and reached this far to 418 no one can predict but the company has a track record or innovation and profitability
why down
any know how the pe ration of nflx its a whopping 227 and not counting ah gain why in the world anyone would want to buy this stock

they are on fast track going from licensing content to producing their own which has high upfront costs and returns coming only 1 to 2 years later so how can they still keep a 25 subscriber growth rate they must be saving a ton producing their own content this company is in a sweet spot when they reach the production licensing balance theyre looking for higher cash flows will kick in subscriber growth rate will be at a high and profits will soar 500 by years end and 1000 in 3 to 5 years

well it may be time to grossly recalibrate my thinking about what a company is actually worth if tesla is allowed to have a negative 12 dollars eps and can rally 4 percent today then i guess we can justify netflix at a price of 10000 per share just like bitcoin why not boy bonds are starting to look real good to me

netflix is all about subscriber growth right nowbut that does not mean it will always going to be just that there are a thousand ways netflix can monetize their current platform that they have not even tapped yet and i suspect the goal right now is just capture as much market share as it can once that growth engine starts to decline netflix will start executing monetization on their platform how do you know when they start simple look at the mature markets they are currently in and the us is numero uno on that front they will start playing around price increases and will continue until the market cannot absorb anymore then they will play around with advertising and there are many ways to advertise on the platform without intruding on the customer experience you will also start seeing licensing come into play on their hit shows and that folks is not just tshirt caps and toysyou will start to see theme parks and network tv now multiply that process to 180 countries it is in

competition in the space is only increasing going forward which makes the current nosebleed valuation for nflx extremely difficult impossible  to support again based on current nasdaq analyst consensus estimates txmdby farhas significantlymore upside potential than nflx going forwardthe nflx party is about to end while the txmd party has not even startedgood luck to all 
if apple launch video streaming service on friday game over all this stock i have strong feeling that apple will announce something like that in order to keep stock bleeding low specially if those iphonex report are real problemif that happen this will go back to 200 easily be careful bigger netflix price more gain apple get from announcement after all apple already have better technology data most use netflix on iphone and can take over netflix in no time
hey whos short out there feeling some pain

90 new movies a year planned by netflix
this could be the next nflx
totally insane reaction nflx is already the most overvalued stock in the index a 28 growth rate is not high enough to bring its 300 pe down to reasonable levels for decades on top of this they missed revenue projections by 80million 220b vs expected 228b are experiencing negative cash flow and are going further into debt any one of these three negatives would take a nondarling stock down 20 all three wouldpick a number down 35 but yet in this crooked can you say rigged market it goes up im not long or short just an observation that there are many many companies that are superior to nflx that would get absolutely hammered for producing results like this
futures are up
netflix should be ay 850
its just a matter of time before nflx signs a partnership with iq to deliver its content in china iq is a great avenue for nflx to expand and become recognize in china hold on to your stock let the traders and shorties continue to create trade volume in the stock eventually iq is destine to trade at a higher price
i am staying long
buy more
the only explanation i can have for this morning’s action is trading in sympathy with stay at home stocks but that’s not really a fair explanation because this didn’t jump last week with these stay at home stocks i guess best to ignore the noise and focus on the big picture another upgrade and positive news should see results soon

“apptopia said disney competitors including netflix and amazoncom incs prime video remain largely unaffected in terms of their performance during the same period”
remember today is a huge down day for tech we would normally be up 34 if it wasnt for this correction
if after earning this go 400 i will start shorting again for sure today i sold 345 calls expiring today just for premium i am 99 certain it not going there just based on bogus analyst reports entire 2018 all they done is inflate and result their master make huge amount of money manipulating stock price based on report and retail who jump after seeing excitement most lost lot of money they going to keep repeating until retail get smarter and they cant benefit i think this time retail going to smarter than last year and not going to get trap on every raising price promise
where is swing trader josh didn’t he say shorting at 346 was just gambling well it turned out to be a good bet
anyone seen a buy out number floating around once we see people speculating on a premium price then something simmering

breakout heading for the 600s
it is looking like this is trying to build some temporary support in the mid 260s indexes finding new lows but nflx is hanging in if this somehow figures out how to close above 274 it might be ready to make a decent move ie test 300 with the current market climate hard to see when that might be if it happens at all close below 260  buy puts to 250 close above 274  buy calls thats my shortterm planbtw i called 263 last week and got all thumbs down was very hurt by that lol does anybody here try to use ta for shortterm plays or are we mostly longs holding at 300 trying to get out wo a loss
will recover after lunch
streaming is the future for a long time the piemarket share will continue to expand and isn’t limited at all competitors welcome won’t matter should be 400 as of today

another nice little after hours bump this is good a good upward trend leading into tomorrowfor all those who bought yesterday good newsbest day of the week to buy stock mondayits called the monday effect for decades the stock market has had a tendency to drop on mondays on average some studies as in a survey of the monday effect literature by glenn n pettengill in the quarterly journal of business and economics 2003 have attributed this to a large amount of bad news that is often released over the weekend others point to investors gloomy mood at having to go back to work which is especially evident during the early hours of monday trading july is traditional one of the best months of the year for sp returns so with the momentum moving forward and earnings looking solid i think all us longs are in for a real treat the next few weeks
wish i had bought more
i grew up in the 80’s mom and pop vhs video rentals ruled the movie scene in the 90’s and early 2000’s blockbuster and movie gallery put out the mom and pops in the mid 2000’s netflix put out blockbuster and movie gallery  what happens next
netflix will post good net gains on subscribers next week there are a lot of scared weakminded people who have sold and that is a good thing it only serves to fortify the fountain which will be stronger as we get back on the tracks and full steam ahead to new highs
netflix or disney anyone have arguments for eitherdisney getting into streaming finally
nflx puts the p in parabolic this stock has not taken a breath since 185 i think it is funds who are buying to fill out positions they know the stock will drop but are long term this has got to be a short here
just about done here what an absolute do noting
allstate how many shares you are long or short now  dont brag later without disclosure
400 dollar take over
makes no sense q4 exceeded earnings by 25 and exceeded subscriber growth by more than 17 stock price should be soaring somebody must be manipulating
relax it’s across the spectrum
sold this looks like a sell the news especially next week after mlk holiday
a little over 1 million shares traded but market cap is up 14b that how you know youre in a bubble

amazon is next
this is the best time to grab some shares before earnings come outnetflix has barely started in india subscriber growth there is going to be phenomenalplus  netflixs ability to produce contents is unmatched they are light years ahead of the competitionthis stock could be 1000 in a few years
netflix was pretty cool until disney started up ever notice almost all of netflix original movies are rated ma adam sandler is in like 90 of the movies too hes played out imo
you can’t talk about the entertainment industry without bringing up streaming service netflix nasdaqnflxhistorically nflx stock has been an expensive play but a worthwhile investment because the firm’s position at the top of the streaming space looked very solid however recently netflix has seen a major pullback as investors started to worry about rising competitionin just two months nflx stock has seen its share price fall nearly 20 after the company’s secondquarter results underwhelmed the market to be sure netflix isn’t flying as high as it once was but the firm’s commitment to creating quality content is likely to keep the service from succumbing to the increasing competition in the streaming space plus although nflx is nearing saturation in the us the firm still has a huge growth opportunity in india where its content has been wellreceived so far so while the q2 results were admittedly disappointing this pullback in nflx stock makes for a buying opportunity
i’m confident they will add an average of 10 million subscribersquarter over the next 3 quarters and the stock will be north of 500
i cut my position in 12 but still long i am not understanding why this keeps rocketing when it has negative cash flow and as i understand it no plan to become cashflow positive in the near future what am i missing

can someone explain why the stocking down i dont get it
look at max and 5 year chart last 2 years market almost flat yet netflix up over 200 sorry but odds are dropping to around 220
people that keep talking about option volume clearly dont understand the highest volume will always point to current pricelook at the open interest that is your actual clue of what is to come which points to 550 dip and upper range of 570
my thoughts and prayers to everyone who sold at a loss in the first 30 mins the selloff is over let the fomo begin
i am not a fan of zacks but they have a fair and balanced article about nflx on the front page unlike garolou and other pumpers they write about both the opportunities and risks a couple comments caught my attention first i have been stating live sports is dis ace in the hole zacks wrote netflix is in for a major streaming battle for years to come and let’s not forget that unlike disney and amazon netflix doesn’t have any plans to entice subscribers with other offerings such as live sports and then as any fundamental investors knows the balance sheet matters plus amazon disney and apple all have much more money to pour into content which i have been stating in debates with garolou over and over so while nflx has to borrown junk bonds at a high rate to produce this content these other firms have cash sitting on their books dont but garolous ridiculous point that its too late or that aapl amzn dis etc will not take a hit on earnings today firms invest in businesses all the time which means losses upfront and then gains later be careful listening to the pumpers on here they arent being nice to you they are trying to manipulate you
anyone else think nflx is expected to have huge earnings and great new subscriber growth but is probably priced in already so once numbers are released it could go down
netflix 375 tomorrow rug pull incoming
should pop even more tomorrow
recover soon
when netflix has matured in about 10 years pe 1520 they will have such a colossal library will not spend as much on original contentnetflix is far and away leader i have tried pretty much all the streaming apps still kept a few all of them combined not as good as netflix
unbelieveable come back i still believe 500 end of year
time to put option 
guidance will be great for next quarter huge increase in subscriber adds—— 80100 point increase in stock price great product  all the great shows are on netflix
powell just said uncertain economic conditions in next few months even with the vaccine
there are so so os many shorts watch tomorrow huge squeeze
will netflix beat the earnings
currently 72 people looking at this message board a lot of enthusiasm go up up up
must read food for thought on nflx and all other high flyerseach time price targets got lifted on nflx when it was at all time highs it dropped over 20 every time before going higher take early jan 2018 target went to 350 price was at 287 then dumped to 236 then again in march target was 400 price was at 334 then dumped to 271 now we are at 400 all time high and 500 is new target price will dump at least 10 before going higher350360 range will hit again soon dont read the hype on this stockits being swing traded by bigcap on and off wall street so nflx will dump soon before going much higher then 400watch an learnwe swing traders make way more in longrun we lock in profits on each run mostly we go long till new highs break take profits then capitalize on pullbacks with shorts then hop right back in long at lower levels plus we dont risk losing large portions of our gains if something really bad happens much safer to swing tradejust need a good coach and trading group
what caused it to go back down from 290
this stock has been a total dud for me ive owned it for a while now and even picked up more recently the market cap imo is a little too low im not sure whats keeping it down but ill wait
volume was great today thats a very positive sign
i think i might drink a 40 of vodka before the market opens tomorrow things usually don’t hurt as bad when you’re hammered
can someone please tell me where the future growth will be coming from is this an international play why would anyone own netflix over other high growth tech companies netflix seems to have much more competition than others and they dont make money
waiting until the closing bell for nflx earnings report makes me feel like i’m back in 1995 awaiting the oj verdict
nflx bubble chasers will burn terriblykeep gambling in that bubble
analyst just adding fuel to fire i guess they dont care valuation and why they should there are enough out there buy at any price i just dont understand why raise price target to 345 just raise to 1000 or 2000 or something
are free subscriptions considered subscribers
i just bought with nflx watch it go down
people look into past growth and think growth will just continuebusiness like subscription normally had sudden stop or even negative growth i think netflix is candidate in year or so netflix has bigger problem because it allow to share accounts and so very hard to tell how many unique household using it sure those free with cable and tmobile going to help for time beingaol is prime example where it taking millions of subscriber ever month and then suddenly go to pause while market value crash more to do hype it was into market subscriber pause and decline has nothing to do with market its just it monetize most of subscriberhbo is another example 2010 to 2014 it grown to 80m to 142m then suddenly drop next year since then its stable around 145mi think netflix is next we just dont know when that going to hit but market cost raise concerning for sure and those cable offering free netflix going to delay that problem as well but its trojan horse and they will use it when netflix at worst position
volume picking up bigly during last hour
3 months ago nflx was trading at 329 what is the big deal if drops to 350
hulu was just valued at 15 billion thats a problem for netflixs valuation which stands at a staggering 165 billion including net debt that is roughly 11x the valuation of hulu
i am sure the obamas will be proud of you when the  the  off the table and your left looking like a cnn reporter
they are increasing the subscription price nooo noooo
swing swing swingi warned you guysand i offered my levels but no one listens on hear i only get bashed even when im right 100 of the timefyi 90 of swing trading is knowing the stock market guess what levels wll hit next on nflx in next two session when sp500 drops another 12you guys seriously need to start swing trading with us
two things i know about the short game1 you have to absolutely unequivocally believe in what you are doing and stick with it2 have the resources to weather the stormi’m short this stock and i’m going nowhere
i can assume this has to do with the general market not netflix all indexes took a pounding
there is a reason why 85 percent of the institutional investors invest in netflix
just imagine how many funds have nflx in their current holdings and you think they will allow it to fall come on guys let’s get real here
this stock will double within 12 months  easy  this part of the fang is back  probaly 650 to 700 by end of week  seen this so many times
great time to buy but in increments
im sitting on the sideline but i say this thing crashes 50
370 share coming fast
green victory
netflix is maybe worth 30 right now everyone living in this imaginary land where netflix can keep growing as much as they want fact is they need cash to operate and grow which they dont have last year before financing netflix cash flow was negative 2 billion dollars just losing more and more every year bonds funding this debt start maturing 2021 price of them is already dropping who would buy 10 year junk bonds from netflix at 55 when 10 year treasury notes could be yielding 4 next yearthey are going to have to up yield of the bonds they issue in hopes someone will buy them but if they up the yield of the bonds it means they need to increase their profit margin which is already way below the rate they are paying on current bonds they cant afford more expensive debt its irrelevant how many more subscribers they get or how great the shows are unless they start getting positive cash flow very soonfact is netflix future is in their creditors hands netflix has no control why invest in a company that cant control its own destiny when there are positive cash flow growth companies like amzn goog or fb makes no sense to invest in netflix when you have much better options out there so many places to get just as much upside without the huge risk netflix has maybe they pull a rabbit filled with cash out of their hat and make the business work but they can pop at any moment and then everything is goneif you want to invest in hype just invest in bitcoin more upside with less risk as bitcoin doesnt have creditors lol

notice how premarket nasdaq up but then fades after open they need retail to buy their shares
392 before next earnings
fb saved the day very nice a good rally on its way
i do declare 550 as the turning pointi said the same thing at 500 but when im finally right its a gut thinggs is full of it and always have been who cares what they say what are they doing they are pumping and dumping how do i know that they are smart and netflix is a 150 stock in value the pe is over 100 and growth revenue is 15 looking backwards and less looking forward check out the debt which wont look so great when the price hits 150 per share then dont forget the train coming at netflix the recession is going to be tough what are we experiencing huge government spending stimulus they are panicking as the money is drying up states are going under no revenue look at how many stores and businesses that are closed or almost closed they are going underthe want to force people to go back to work where what jobs if there were jobs they would be back to work netflix needs to correct to have its pe normalized with its competiton and dont forget the competition is way way too high as well

geez what a runtime for a pullback
ive loved netflix from the beginning and iq could give similar results
ha look at thisthe company also said that net income in the quarter included a 171 million noncash unrealized gain from a foreign exchange “remeasurement on our eurodenominated debt”—which accounted for a significant part of the earnings beat
the gains nflx has had this year are great but when you look at where the market and what this has done the last 3 months it’s hard to be pleased you want your stocks close to their 52 week highs when market is setting new records daily it appears that large cap tech is suffering the most it is strange because you see companies like roku crowdstrike google snowflake etc hitting new highs then you have companies like amzn nflx zoom which seem to be stuck despite great earnings zoom i understand more because of valuation but then how can you explain snowflake if snowflake is this high then zoom should be higher if roku has run 30 in a few weeks then nflx should have seen some reaction along with that so i just see a lot of disconnects which makes it harder to invest definitely been trading more this week it’s basically a traders market right now and i guess just follow the momentum
sell when others buy buy when other sell take profit before losing it
cnbc need to take the senate hearings off the air nobody wants to listen to black unemployment all day i guess when the markets are at highs you dont need to worry about the fed and just talk about black unemployment none of this has anything to do with the fed

netflix price target raised to 550 from 420 at barclays netflix price target raised to 550 from 420 at barclays 0630 nflx barclays analyst kannan venkateshwar raised the firms price target on netflix to 550 from 420 and keeps an overweight rating on the shares while q2 expectations have run up significantly ahead of already high guidance the key driver is likely to be q3 guidance where expectations are relatively subdued due to company commentary earlier in the year and a tough comp versus stranger things last year venkateshwar tells investors in a preearnings research note netflix is one of the few content services with a full content slate which combined with sports uncertainty could continue to be a tailwind says the analyst

“so far it’s an equity play that is based on growth valuation of growth and the general belief that there will be a point at which they can take their foot a little bit of the throttle right”“they demonstrated their stock really took off when they could demonstrate pricing power so when they raised their prices and didn’t lose any material subscribers i think the financial markets said “aha glue” “so if you have glue and you have growth and pricing power they should be enormously cash generative”john malone phd media magnet net worth 9 billion

how someone will not buy this under 500the whole world on quarantine sitting home watching netflix while earnings report are on the way

imo nflx would not be increasing prices if they are losing subs this increase is going to add 1b domestically and another 1b from international subs their model is working and sub must be increasing otherwise they would not be raising prices esp in light of competition from dist i think 4q earnings are going to be goodgood luck to all

a hugely overpriced stockand the fact that theyre considering share buybacks is insanetheyre barely cash flow positive as it isthey should be doing the exact opposite selling shares at these lofty prices and using the money to fight off increasing competitionthe outdated maximizing shareholder value mantra comes a cropper eventually just look at ge and boeing

short at 400 looking for low 300s or 200s this afternoon
bought 250 shares in the morning open gaining quite a bit already hoping to see 400 back this week
why is this going down after reporting will this be at 330 or 280
here is goes shorties are sweating it but we warned them plenty
just like it didnt go up from 300 to 400 in one day or one week it wont go down from 400 to 300 in one day or one week either nasdaq 100 is at all time high so downside risk is much higher than upside potential for all stocks that have unreasonable valuations at these levels nflx is no different
5 months ago i almost bailed at 250 why would i care its down 22 today netflix forever
probably green today short failed big time again

i use to have netflix but switched to hbo max and glad i did
happy to say the profit on my investment in netflix today has reached 1000 and it had only taken five years i have never had an investment perform this well and i hold all the high beta stocks i continue to be a believer in this generational stock and plan to hold indefinitely glta in your investing life

just wait and see where volume goes today we’ll know the truth about a hour before close
very nice actually compared to where it was
lets hope monday is a good day and the rest of the week is great
lot of people here betting we will have 8m9m or even 10m new subscriber they miss very important thing one of bull analyst point out he use it as bull case that still market can bigger i am using as bear case i think stock will go down if around or below 6m meet or slight missbeat company projection many think growth only go hyper based on history but problem is it already 119m some analyst even point out that only 600m in world x china have broadband and so that is 20 of overall world market share if you add account sharing 50 likely thats 30 of entire world i think growth will slow regardless of disney and apple streaming success if they are very successful we may have negative growth evengrowth get harder as it go higher sure recent tmobile and cable provider free with order reduced sharing and bring some growth in usa and rest of world market  could be reason for 4q beat and even 1q i call it trojan horse because once subs custom for free netflix when they discontinue result going to be mix of discontinue netflix vs service who provide free netflix they will use weapon at worst time then other have more hit than netflix
green monday dow futures climbing
up 4 on 18 mm shares traded seems reasonable need to take care of the hedgies quarter end
340 is within the reach
patience pays
single biggest indicator that netflix will hit it out of the park on monday is their q2 guidance for 62 million subscriber adds the previous high for a q2 guide was 32 million they really didnt need to guide that high unless subscriber adds were going through the roof
look at the volume on acrx someone know something on acrx long also amzn pton nflx aprn

netflix management is superb this cannot be underestimated executing on all frontshere is the earnings interviewhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqprpyzcsa3c

nflx becoming cash flow positive is a major blow to the shorts’ thesis this is despite coming competition from dis this tells me that not only will the two coexist without cutting each other’s throats they will be like coke and pepsi they target different markets so there is no bear case to be made here 600 a share will be here soon
new leg down coming
banking on india lol nothing against india but they can’t possibly get a sustainable subscription rate for any real meaningful growth it’s all fluff 10 per month is a huge some for the masses of that country let alone 15 per month

the battle to win over viewers online may be reaching new levels of intensity comcast’s nbcuniversal is considering the launch of a streaming service that would pay people to watch itthe tentative name for the service is watch back and it would feature episodes of tv shows and web series from nbcuniversal’s own tv networks—like nbc usa and bravo—as well as those from outside web sites to entice people to watch watch back viewers would earn points that could be redeemed for gift certificates according to several people with knowledge of the plans

why up today
a new year means new resolutions and one of mine is to cut down on looking at these boards or posting on them i imagine some of you feel the same way i do and have a lovehate relationship with the boards they can be addicting as a weird entertainment but deep down you know theyre largely a waste of time and kinda like going down a rabbit hole of internet junk im writing this so i force myself to stick to it so for now good luck to all have a great year
earnings is now back in focus as trade will be placed on the back burner after the posturings by us and china
netflix is value for money they have so much valuable data great ai and negotiating power
some nut on cnbc said sold half my shares im still in the game sounds good but how does this nut feel now that this winner is up almost 9 after hours 9 is a great gain for the year let along for a few minutes

this is going to break green today
this is not the beginning of some sort of recovery this is an opportunity to eject and save losing a fortune
i advise any long to book some profit today even after analyst pumping so much end of last week it fail to hold 315 that clearly mean big player selling before earning this prove my theory that its help that analyst provide so big player can exit with profitnow slight only beat or slight miss can bring this stock to 250 easily they have to beat big time in order to justify such inflated prices analyst and big player know that there is very limited up side incase they beat big time but downside risk start even with slight beat
this will go over 400  now a days dish is not doing good due to that everyone is streaming

these stocks have handily benefited from an economy flooded with subscription models said boris schlossberg managing director of foreign exchange strategy at bk asset management the growing popularity of subscription services particularly across media has been key to these names’ success“they are essentially trading on the fact that they are growing their subscriptions it really doesn’t matter how profitable they are it almost doesn’t even matter how much revenue they have it’s the subscription growth that really attracts them because then it makes them a candidate for ma for probably old media” he said thursday on cnbc’s “trading nation”“until and unless their subscription growth rate slows down i think it’s very dangerous to short them at this point that’s the dynamic that’s really driving them and that’s the dynamic that could push them even higher as we go from this point” he addedhttpswwwcnbccom20180706streamingstocksareonatearanditsnotjustnetflixhtmlsourceyahoo7cfinance7cheadline7cstory7cparyahooyptryahoo

good price to buy now
unless reed hasting can do better quarterly projection numbers and slow down the spend nflx will eventually be bought out imho especially if the stock price continues to fall but by who and whywhy  nflx has 150m subs and gets the acquirer with deep pockets immediately into the marketwho0 fb  yes facebook deep pockets and they have already signaled more of a video offering play in their services roadmap1 att  deep pockets but already carrying a lot of debt still trying to figure how they get their ott offering off the ground directv now had mixed success uverse and directv are legacy products that are losing subs2 amzn  deep pockets and their video platform hasnt really taken off bundled with prime nflx acquisition could give them another paid offering which also runs on aws3 comcast  deep pockets unlikely unless they want to jump start their ott offering4 aapl  deep pockets but unlikely due to the positioning of their upcoming ott platform unless they want immediate market share5 dis  deep pockets and most unlikely unless they want to offer a differentiated content offering platform vs disjust my 2c gtla except the trolls on this board
soon everyone will jump on the band wagon saying it was bound to correct
potential for earnings per share in 5 years at subscription maturity is about 10 per share at that time market will value netflix like apple around 20 times earnings so in 5 years your investment in netflix will mature to about 200 per share great investment in you are buying at 340

5 top stock trades for friday — a look at half of fangspeaking of consolidating look at the excellent price action of netflix incnasdaqnflxsome investors may not like the recent action or complain that it is stalled but keep in mind that netflix stock is up more than 100 so far in 2018 it needs to consolidate some of these moves and this is very healthy price actionshares are gearing up for another big move that much is clear the only thing we need to figure out is which direction if the past is any indication that direction will be higherwatch for a move up to 405 to 410 should we get it it could spur a rally back to its previous highs near 420 and possibly even new alltime highs above thathttpsfinanceyahoocomnews5topstocktradesfriday195312774html

here’s the upside for netflix 5g rollout will by eoy will benefit netflix push for mobile streaming gets cheaper every year and that adds up to netflix bottom line 5g will allow countries with slow internet speed to finally catch up to the west and it will spur innovation all over the world as we have seen with the rollout of 4g we are looking at a new bull run in the us economy and many mini bull run on many nations which in turn will increase its middle class base which will directly benefit netflix we are looking at another 4 more years of additional bull run if you doubt the 5g bull run projections just look at the innovation spurred by 4g
anyone buying calls here into the close
so many people took a gamble and shorted this stock needless to say this stock will soar tomorrow with all the shorts covering their calls hahahaha
well there is good and bad news the good news is nflx wasnt down today the bad news is the downside pain isnt over we know this based on how people on here reacted to ok news a truce is not a deal people calling for a 40 one day pop just silly 350 by eoy even more silly and the always funny death to the short cries you must reach pessimism before you start climbing back up i am not sure we are even close to that yet

it’s a good moment to buy 50 shares of nflx
don’t get lulled into complacency nflx is highly volatile and just like it moved up 100 points within 3 weeks at the beginning of the year it can move down not only that it kept climbing even though earnings estimates went down after er this could easily hit 300 or lower within a week or two if the market continues the correction don’t forget nflx was around 260 at the beginning of the year
nflx will hit new high in one week or so lot of catalysts will drive nflx much higher450 is my target in two years
all time high before end of the month
moving back up in premarket good volume
huge huge huge green week ahead im not selling belw 375 tomorrow new 52high 100
i’m not going to try and understand why and just ride the wave
so todays plan is to pump nflx and nasdaq bubble to new record absurd highs every minute with falling earnings
from the release we’re looking forward to a strongslate of global content in the second half of the year including new seasons of some of our biggestseries stranger things july 4th 13 reasons why orange is the new black the crown and lacasa depapel aka money heist as well as big films like michael bay’s six underground and martin scorsese’sthe irishman and expect another year of record annual paid net adds in 2019
when will the next squeeze come in it should be soon
up 90 in a month shorts sure are getting crushed
my retirement just become whole from loss in enron thanks nflx
realistically this stock will see 37500 before it sees 33000 when this wakes up it’s going to crush shorties beyond recognition a stock like this one doesn’t get a 7000 haircut on the sole basis of missing subscriber growth
and then after the retest of 231 fails it will break down utterly false business model that will never generate a dime of free cash flow
india has over 1 billion people all wanting netflix
yo brocancelled my netflix they raised the price a dollars cool msnyou showed them lol z
short
trading above 359 in pre market
dis down nflx up in ah says it all  nflx will pop big tomorrow both overhang apple and disney out of the way now
don’t worry you think this is going to be red everyday or green it has to go up or down sometimes but it will run up faster then fallen it could happen today or next week 400 see you soon
let me guess not enough new subscribers but positive earnings and boom 5
great short term but long term is difficult with original content when dis and warner leaves netflix to start their own netflix 
volume is low it is just manipulation hold on
hour and a half to go 385 close
the shortfall in subscribers in q2 was primarily due to the world cup so the pullback just offers an excellent buying opportunity
i shorted nflx today will cover short below 240 next week
shorts this not the time to cry but time to cover
anyone else buy this morning by accident because it was cheap without a clue it would go up like thisi just made 1000 
long term not justified now short term not justified now greed in action now
i can understand why stocks like peloton zoom etc are taking a hit they are selling at extremely high multiples but nflx is not in that group they have the high growth but also have huge revenue and earnings same with amazon these stocks should not be taking a hit on vaccine amzn and nflx will be even stronger with a vaccine i get it though it’s group think
shorts cannot cover in extended hoursthey are so scarer and à huge shortsqueeze tomorrow moring buying panic event  cant wait to see that
i got in at 188 long and strong
anyone read the wsj today india is going to curb growth of us tech firms in their country they are going to follow the china model bad news for nflx since that is an expected major growth area i know this board doesnt like facts but this is real from the article the proposed rules which have emerged in recent weeks in a series of private draft government policies have us tech companies concerned according to people familiar with the matter american firms are betting billions on the indian market because unlike china’s it has been relatively open to foreign competitors that might be about to change“it is unprecedented and it needs to be taken very seriously” said vinay kesari a bangalorebased technology lawyer specializing in regulatory matters who has worked with us tech firms “it could have huge implications”
breaking down funds are selling
should be green by eod
ok up 712 in 3 days and 6 billion in market cap i was surprised it kept going up today its clearly tired here and i expect a small pullback tomorrow maybe finish around 20435 going into the weekend i look forward to another volatile day with this
just think this thing is climbing and we still have more than a week before earnings
went short first time on nflx yest thought the rebound was shakey on low volume gonna bleed lower for a few weeks in my opinion 320 is my target and my out
short will get squeezed so hard
some time back i bought amazon just before earnings report at 40000 a share after they reported it went down significantly so out of fear i sold i think now what it would be if i had just held on now over 180000 hardest thing to do when investing in the stock market is to have patience dont look back some day and wish you had just held on to nflx
it’s the ultimate house of cards fed paper money pump canary in the mine if this goes then we finally have to acknowledge it’s all overvalued

if most of hollywood is against the same people that pay their salaries this is not going to end well when the liberals are trying to burn the constitution

pre market open 345
what has the bigger upside in 2019 netflix or amazon
i love netflix that’s all
breakout on huge volume
i love netflix i’m watching right now never ever had a problem not even with price to rent
one of the few stocks that does well in good times and bad in bad times people look to save money which accelerates cord cutting because of the price gauging by cable companies and simply going with netflix
bought 200 shares at 352little scare but ended up easy money
700 coming baby yes
nasdaq down nflx down nasdaq up nflx down sells every early morning pop sells into the close see a pattern
nice 3 day run comes to an endnice comeback lets start a new one tomorrowwhat stopped the rally when it hit 350
every real buyer is waiting for a number i think 300310 if it gets that low to start buying then stock pops and the shorts will cover and take it back to high 300s
seriously does this stock go up everyday how about a multiple of 1000 or 2000 hey maybe a pe of 10000 would work
just watched jingle jangle on netflixim not into christmas movies i dont like musicals but this is a stunning movie love or hate netflix after klaus they just prove again they dont have to fear disney

the mistake people make is they look at netflix numbers in a vacuum without comparing to competitors numbers when you do a little digging you find that netflix is blowing away the competition
330 open close 340
netflix is not only streaming service it is international movie studio so much content coming
netflix feels like the titanic
bottom line ive had netflix forfree 25 years no revs from meused to be outstanding nowpretty boring actually paidfor a hbo max membership 100 satisfaction if i owned this i would be cautious ofpumping cant go up forever
i decide not to sell any put until tuesday next week and i will stop watching this stock except once in two hour i know this not even worth 300 so i should not worry regardless what happen anything go up too fast normally come down stock price growing with result is healthy when it get out of sync its very risky

the last i posted about pi it was trading unofficially at 02x per coin and that is now all the way up to 122 and there are over 10 million minerspioneers mining coins on their phones search on google pi network coin value and you will be able to see current unofficial quotebefore you skip the post thinking its useless for you check out where bitcoin is trading today its over 34000 per coin i am not saying that pi will be that successful but what if it even reaches 100 per coin in the future even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year those coins can be worth a significant amount of moneyin any way you never have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi its open for anyone to mine on their phone as bitcoin was in earlier days just download the pi network app on your phone use invitation code celebration26 when registering its by invitation only and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future they will verify that if you are the person who you said you areas far as my progress i have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about 10k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially
ubs wants to get in at cheaper price been there done that
netflix is the best

matthew harrigan reiterated sell rating he has sell rating on nflx since it was 300 his client would have made lot of money if he went long at 300

with fed meeting next week and rate hike expected how do you think that impacts a company with a cash burn that continuously borrows hey if money gets to expensive well just issue more stock
toward 360 close
buying opportunity for sure look at your history hereevery sell off has turned into a chance to buy and make money the sub model they have blew it this quarter but they set the bar low for next quarter and they’ll beat it handily this is always the weakest quarter with little new content add to that the fact that they’re just in their infancy in asia short term pain down to 320 in the near term but up up and away is the long term destination
poor disney they were better off getting their own channel on netflix and staying in front of 160m and growing
april calls on nflx are through the roof

 good to know that there is some sanity in the market fb has nothing to do with nflx period i am keeping the faith especially that one tiny positive announcement from nflx will turn things around and if amzn beats then it will even be better
the sleeping beast shall awaken once again
open limit down tomorrow
over priced no profits ever only losses will have to spend more on content when disney and warnermedia begin to pull content from them share price is way overinflated only due to hype analyst are not evaluating this correctly they promote and when price does up they dump sell netflix
why would i want netflix when disney has a better lineup of shows netflix is the next blockbuster this is a short of a lifetime
netflix gift cards are sold out nearly everywhere in vtnh

• shares of netflix nasdaqnflx are on watch after morgan stanley hikes it price target to 350 from 275 to rep 20 upside potential
we could see 100 point swing if earnings and subscriber numbers are met
can we just have one solid day where it sits in the green entire time for god sakes
barely makes targets and stock goes up 10 talk about delusionsnext qtrs numbers are being goosed by the increased prices but for how long
down 32 a share people will not want to pay more money for a netflix subscription if the stock doesnt hold up
this one is going the wrong way new strain of covid will lock the us down again new strain kills at 30 success rate
fantastic results
netflix has continued to make tremendous progress since the june 2018 high its about time for the stock to head back up and start making new highs once again with or without the sp500
nflx just keeps pumping out better higher quality originals with top superstar actors nflx has much more to grow from here on once they reach a point their products subscription becomes a muststaple in every household they will be able to raise subscription fees and generate a huge income they are also expanding into international market take a look at their expansion into south korea for example huge
i was looking cfra report which cover it as outperformnow they releasing weekly report some reason i know exact reason why all analyst doing dailyweekly refresh even with no changes algo trading platform give highest weight to analyst its proven and effective method to manipulate stocknot surprising when i compare two report both are identical except raising price targetone release on july 7 with 465 priceone release on june 16 with 365 pricewhats more surprising both report mention fair value june 16 report 27539 analysis of the stocks current worth based on cfras proprietary quantitative model suggests that nflx is overvalued by 13286 or 325jul 7 report 26738so even their fair value decreased by their own propritery model they raise price target by 100can anyone believe thisif anyone think
we need a 1000 up day today
i sold to early but i was thinking that they missed earnings and was down by 10 cents from last year oh well
beware of er and eps missed
the green pattern was broken yesterday red is the new netflix
peaking stock price of nflx is a thing of the past it has very very limited scope of rising from above this level it has lost its monopoly original content can be produced by other competitors as wellwith surplus cash apple can be a winner in the race disney content going away from netflix can prove expensive to netflix stock price will remain in this level or will drift down when market correction happens
this looks like a bear trap fewer shares traded means more control bears be careful
people just chill fed supposed to give minutes which has everyone on edgeplus markets went rednflx forecasting 94 million subscribers next qblew this q out of the water
said 335 closing price pretty close anyways congrats to all alongs 400 is soon to come huge rally coming up and solid earnings are boosting all sectors financial leading with solid revenue and earnings especially goldman sachs beating eps by more than a 1 economy strong and forward outlook of 4 gdp by mid 2019
nflx real advantage in the streaming wars is a ultra wide genre spectrum no other platform will have content from and for so many countries
definitely selling tomorrow 930am sharp
yesterdays sugar high wearing off as expected
fundamentals don’t matteruntil you issue 15 billion in junk bonds
party to be continue tomorrow
investors may be pleasantly surprised with earnings  new subscription pricing is included in this reporting quarter  which is approximately 10 higher subscription pricing
cover cover cover
congrats
all the talk about disney removing content from netflix does it fall under antitrust why can’t disney license the shows out to anyone wants pay the fair price how is it legal to limit the circulation of contents
did trump speak  is that why the markets are down lol
based on their current trajectorythey hit 200 subs in about 26 months z
nothing comes close to netflix contents and programming not even a giant like amazon all others are decades behind
predictions anyone for closing price today and at open tomorrow my guess 315 close today and 340 open tomorrow
will it ever reach 400 i am in at 405 now getting little worried
this is my big shortanalysts are still pumping it their us new membership increase has decelerated now they are competing with disney on the international front who do you think will win internationally disney of course
apple up 3 barry
ok picked spots wisely shorted a few shares at 315 whole figure  31550s this is a temporary top declines on profit taking will be swift and short covering is drying up here as well going to let this trade play out swinging short stay nimble folksva
and to think this was 140 at one time last year i guess we wait till next year
bullish crossover in macd and stochastic oscillator according to foxchart looking for breakout at 355
if you want to buy the dip here’s your chance this stock is still a long term winner who cares about estimatesthey still added 5mill  subs and beat on earnings the stock settles at 340 and slowly makes it way back to 400 in a few weeks
are you guys ok today
is this some kinda joke under 500 why
watch out the big short squeeze tomorrow if shorts cannot drop nflx in the thin market now
i bet a lot of nflx shorts think that because of disney’s projected 200 plus million subscribers over the next few years that they will eat nflx’s lunch that’s simply not the case dis and nflx make very different shows and target different markets there is a way the two can coexist without cutting each other’s throats as long as nflx continues to make shows like the queen’s gambit their subscriber numbers won’t shrink long term i am bullish on both dis and nflx and believe the two can coexist in the same way coke and pepsi square and paypal domino’s and papa john’s all can competition doesn’t have to erode business when there are only a few players own both i see so many people bashing dis in this discussion and vice versa in the dis discussion it makes no sense two money makers are better than one glta
nflx will soon reach 90 million subs
investing is always full of uncertainty but one thing is quite certain this train is heading north to destination 400 buy the ticket and enjoy the ride jmho
tomorrow will jump up let see 427
axxa check out market cap vs revs its a diamond of a stock
today is the day futures are in red but look like it can be corrected where will be with nflx before the close today
wow netflix down 2 on apple news remember when netflix was trading at 10 and dropped 10 on news apple was coming with apple tv streaming service buy netflix on all news about competition coming

this is normal i suppose when you are the leader of the pack everyone is gunning against you a slight hiccup and who is who of the world going to start this chorustold you sobut hey comes with the territory bring it on  we will see in six months that the champ nflx is still standing in the middle of the ring
nothing like a buying discount
analysts said its going green today

the dow jones 300 points down today it was a bad day for everyone
why the price drops like crazyafter nflx beat the earnings on 7172019 
what a joke they are pumping nflx mega bubble again despite falling earnings

i canceled my service could not support a company that put susan rice on their board remember that sunday morning it was a video
going to continue sideways until earnings and if its a miss going back to 200
stock split
disney report shows subscribers to streaming services are on the rise disney and netflix offer different content they both benefit from ramping up subscriptions
buy again now
buy truck load now
big expectations for earnings means there will be a high chance of them not meeting those expectations limited upside big downside good luck to all
green today what a crazy stock you gotta love it daytraders dream long are in for a scare now and then but haha
my prediction was up 2 lets see if it happened
patiently waiting for earnings like
netflix to hit 625 this time around
385 before earnings easy
netflix do not pay a dividend  looking for income  alaris adun on the tsx is paying 973 ca
i feel pretty emotional right now and im only dealing with a 10k account i can only imagine what people with 10 times my amount go through unbelievable
barrons article says netflix is paying 6375 interest rate since 2017 the cost of debt has risen 275 basis point to 6375 should debt investors grow more weary of netflix’s massive cash burn the liquidity they’ve provided could dry up quickly see appendix ii for more detailstry buying something at 6375 interest ratesit is burdensome soon they will paying interest on the interest i think this is a major issue why cant they sell some bonds fro 2 or whatever maybe because their company is too risky that one point is making me lean toward the barrons article httpswwwbarronscomarticleswhynetflixshareswillplummetfundmanager51556731141
anyone see 380 before end of the week
andrew left wants this at 320
correction from earlier postnot 375 after earnings 384 nflx  congrats to all longs that held through this massive dip and continued to add
predicted movement of 12 percent will anybody be doing a straddle on this horse for earnings
love early morning pumpers short after pump around 361
my opinion no installation no receiver box no special changer no dish on top of my house no contract no 100 monthly bill most emmies won because of good original content bottom line is they have successfully leveraged the internet to deliver entertainment cheaper and evey day more people are signing up
why the big drop
goldman is forecasting that netflix will report over 125 million net subscriber additions in the second quarter well above netflixs guidance of 75 million the company is set to release q2 results next week on july 16thursday how does gs know thats insider trading what do they lose if they are wrong nothing they get to unload shares
charts show nflx breaking out over 500 this year market cap is still very low relative to earnings and potential this stock is still in the first or second inning of a great game still to come there are few stories as exciting as nflx perhaps tsla is the other rare one
bad move by netflix to relate anyway to politics i like netflix but i just cancelled by subscription
360 today going to be a great green day
great day
susan rice leaving should make the price go up
today 450 easy
no one stopping this now
look at nflx rally go nflx go
it is not the first time netflix shows a slower growth but it always get better one to two quarters later have faith netflix is king of online streaming right now and expanding globally
netflix will always come back regardless of what happens in er
just bought more i like buying on salewhen others panic
raymond james justin patterson upgraded the stock to strong buy from outperform he also hiked his price target on netflix to 450 per share from 435 implying a 38 percent surge from thursdays close
come on baby goose on upyou will be getting more per subscribernflxexcellent content cobra kai
what a come back 
iq volume 4284 mil netflix 683 mil
when moderna announces next this will hit 375 whether it makes sense to you or not
is it quite possible for this to sink to 230 this week
dont buy into gss bs it is so funny to read that the street is trying to decouple nflx from the fang and this stock is running purely on the new brick box release
earnings preannouncement 
babye netflix
i cant imagine anyone buying this stock at this price
close today 34219
everything has dropped the last 3 hours today its been a bad 2 weeks for almost everything why would you expect netflix to not following the same downward trajectory almost every stock has now given back its previous daily gain
get on up
a big pop like this on the day of er not a good sign this will tank after hours
netflix has come this far and surely it will go farther from here intermittent pullbacks are normal even from jan 2018 up to the present trust netflix just hold on your stocks the best things will come for those who wait
everyone should check out zom it’s about to skyrocket it’s cheap to get on board but it’s about to jump
you put obama on netflix and i’ll cancel my subscription and never watch netflix again
woohoo most of my loses from the past 3 years made up in a week of nflx calls
waiting for a breakout here out of this consolidation
time to run this to 275
another early trading session selloff but it looks like that may be it heading to 370 today i predict
two more pt upgrades today total of 6 since yesterday
could you please tell me where are the shorts oh wait they are hiding well let them stay in their caves lol
thats it im buying wmt for its streaming business
nearly 300 peseems legit
so let me see he shorts then bashes on cnbc or tweeter isnt that what they do when they tell you to buy stocks that they already own on cnbc i see it as activity that should be illegal in all cases  if you mention a stock sell or buy on public network like cnbc  you cant close that position for 30 days perod
for all the longs here who bought years ago in the single or double digits why didn’t u sell when it was above 400 did u do ur dd and come to a conclusion that the stock was worth more and will keep going up just curious
as i wrote yesterday we are due for a little counterrally into the high 350s then back down again nothing goes straight up or down smart moneywill be selling into rallies watch the volume because volume always speaks volumes there is o justifying these valuations and as morgan stanley recently wrote the party is over
raising prices now not committed to growth anymore investors are looking at this the wrong way lmao in my view this actually hints at sub growth not meeting expectations come earnings why else would you stunt your growth right now just as more competitors are ramping up their offerings
why do big companies announce earnings after hours
boa just raised to 460 and maintains a buy rating we hitting 420 today boys
when so much bashing it is signal of a big gap up 100 ah
left my position in nflx at 379  best decision i’ve made recently and invested in roku  do your dd
ive studied 62 different technicals on nflxs chart tonight you have got to be out of your mind if you invest in this now all indicators are pointing to a huge drop on the 6 month chart the macd is closer to the 100 line than it has been in years years massively overbought this has a long way to fall
stock buyback will add 200shr
do you guys ever read httpmultistockalertscom they just wrote about nflx
bloomberg article sheds light on the international growth issuenot as good as hypedalso how does their system worki posted before that it seems to me that they need a computer card essentially a computer in a server for each usernot free
three times in the last six months nflx has topped out at about 550 1 do we think it will get back to that level again2 do we think there is any reason to see it punch through that levelthanks
what’s stated on this board has no influence just fun to let off steam release the pressure valve it’can be informative at times and give you the psychological pulse of the retail investor but like i read 60 of nflx shares are held by institutions
yesssssss i knew it go go baby
time to party nflx longshttpsyoutubecfk0ssmmvfq
and this is dropping why either it did well on its quarterly report or it didnt granted investors will take profits but is there any rational reason beyond that for this to drop 5 in two days if the company is indeed doing well
netflix has 12 of the top 20 tv shows according to rotten tomatoes competitors aren’t generating enough revenue from tv to cover the cost of content nflx is buy under 600
while the naysayers are pontificating on a daily basis why netflix should not be at these levels the stock like the duracell bunny keeps marching forward with occasional dips along the way the naysayers and doubters for the last 100 points have been trying to comprehend why this stock should not be rising while it continues to rise now we have top analysts making a case that this stock will continue to move higher there are the doubters and the believers and those that are believers and visionaries continue to make money and congratulations to them
buy buy buy
netflix was and always be he king of the jungle
netflix bubbleheads still in denial nflx’s grossly overvalued shares will lose 90 of their value
congrats to all long friends patience always pays back 400 is not coming soon enough
netflix sees 5 billion more potential subscribers worldwide
i have given enough thought on what to do here is how my holding look2200 short average price just below 260i just short 2 285 calls i had 15 265 cover put for that i just cover 260 average price including that profitnow i have open 2200 short i know just today i lost 20k total is 50k lossi thought to give various option including start selling put aggressively but cat i end up long side while doing that which company like cat is fine but not with nflx where if crash come this can go to 100s easily so i only left with 2 options1 sell in money cover put but if sell off start this can easily below 260 and i regret it2 sell out money cover put which i will do it again if this go near 2703 trade stock given large number stock this i think i can do with little risk read market sentiment and trade accordingly4 forget and keep all open which mean i wait for payday only problem is if this keep going up very soon i will get margin call
i dont know of any company in any industry that was in the position netflix is in who lost their lead
so to recap the general sentiment on every board on yahooif a stock moves in the direction you want “yeah i was right i’m a genius” if it moves against you “market manipulation” what a sad mindset has befallen this nation
450 is still my price target
when interest payments are only 5 a year and you can grow borrowed money 35 a year it would be a big mistake not to borrow especially in an emerging streaming market where advantages of scale prevail
one final dark risk for netflix is all the metoo sexual assault revelations netflix has gotten in business with some serious creeps who later hit the headlines with sex scandals including harvey weinstein aziz ansari kevin spacey its a risk of being in the entertainment business
recovering nicely bought 1200 shares  34820
is nflx bubble a free money atmthe stock price is getting pumped parabolically without a single break while the earnings are tanking
more people will cancel nflx with price hike and moving to other channels
just wow i sold at 252 for a quick gain but congrats to those who stayed in
applause to all the doomsday shorts today
i am an independent voter not democratic nor republican what netflix failed to announce was the number of subscribers that dropped netflix once they announced the obama show that number will over double once the show hits the netflix stream netflix should never politicize their platform lots of pain to come this is dead money at this point i am out
decent recovery at the end
at the current rate nflx will soon be buying att so they have their own telecomm co to distribute their product

huge earnings in 7 days 550 coming

great price
mmm thank you longs
short squeeze soon
average pe of an sp 500 stock is around 129 nflxs goingforward pe is supposedly 129 thus nflxs pe is around 10 times the average pe of an sp stock so nflx should be trading at 110th its current price or around 34 per share to be on an even par with other sp 500 stocks
so very nice already up huge always buy on big dips and look at yearly charts
dipping the toes in i think nflx had a 1quarter blip and will be north of 400 by year end
cancelled my sub bc of the susan rice hiring how many others and i really enjoyed netflix but
people now watch more netflix than cable tv and by a wide margin according to a cowen survey it wont be the current netflix managers that gouge its customers but the future managers

everyday from here on out green green green from the grinch
313 yesterday 340 middle of today is this still one bullmarket
no matter how much economy drops and markets drop people will continue to watch their tv shows and movies for time being so i reckon netflix can only fall so much
nflx headed to 300 today
if you want to short—dont short the stock short by buying puts or selling calls it avoids short short squeezes do yourself and othrs a favor
have you seen how much nflx drops after it surges almost equally great to swing trade or if you are seriously long then we all know you got in wayyy before these price points point is i cant say its a bad company but anyone buying in now or pretty much above 500s is taking huge risk imho then again a lot of the market is the same but nflx surged way too high wayy too fast so it will correct before anything else does and then on a big market correction day it will not be good for nflx but great time to buy in
buying more  way way way oversold
anyone here buy calls at the open i was scrambling but jumped in on two different dates for a 100 and 300 gain to this point figured it was an easy bet
hmmm so new subscriptions will not be added in the winter season with corona spiking
there is no reason for this to happen if i had more money i would have bought more can someone tell me if they will cancel their nflx submission if it is increased a buck or two

would netflix share skyrocket as well after amazon and google beat earning
just wait for it netflix in the past was quite unique in the market without much competition now all the major content owners take away their stuff and launch their own services to believe this would not have an impact on netflix is absolutely wrong and blind with competitors rising netflix user growth is going to slow down and eventually going to stall while they are not generating a single  and have huge debt if just any buble in the stock market is going to blow up netflix and other overhyped stocks with a negative business will go down heavily

lovely discount  panic sell back up tomorrow  thanks guys
indeed  shaking the tree real hard this time and its always the very impatient and weak hands that drop the ball straight into the lions den netflix has a habit of not necessarily following the major indices if youve noticed anyway happy thanksgiving  i believe todays dip was a buying opportunity and the one thing for sure is that nobody knows anything for certain except that netflix will have its turbo boost kick in once the mms finish accumulating their lots happy trading

nflx is a well managed company that has a single focus that is its expertise and dominance long term investors win with a company like this
i told you folks a few weeks ago to sell nflx when it was in the low 400s high 300s mid 300s and now low 300s this stock got way ahead of itself the current pe ratio is still way too high by all means i have never said that nflx doesnt have a good product it just that the market cap is twice as to what it should be they have grown by given its product at prices that doesnt sustain their business bottom line when they increase the price to become profitable the customer base will decrease so they are in a very tough position in addition competition by disney apple google and others will only intensified down the road if you still have profits sell and run for the hills and if you have losses sell now to minimize further loses we will if not already enter a period of a serious stock market correction as its currently way over priced i strongly recommend that you consult your cpacfa and ask himher on holding stocks of companies with pe of over 100 and see what they tell you

will anybody be surprised by an eps of 200 on april 21st  analyst projections are calling for 161 epsnetflix will beat it handily and may even get as high as 225 their global subscriptions may increase by 20 and their us could see a 15 increase all due to lockdowns in all major countriesanalyst at bernstein may be light with their share price upgrade to 487 i can see nflx surpass 500 as more and more people are staying home even in the us lastly what stock would you rather buy amzn at 1900 a share 6 shares of nflx at 360 a share  its really a no brainer in april i for one have been building a nice little long position for the past couple of weeks nowlook for more upgrades probably even before the earnings nflx is clearly a bellwether stock in the nasdaq
going up due to more lockdowns being initiated around the world netflix is the king
i have a netflix account  but honestly netflixs revenue is not diversified enough  basically from membership unlike disney or amazon if giving enough time i believe the streaming business will have more competitors from those giants then it has to keep raising membership fee to stay a flow we will see how this model goes
selling at this moment will just loss more
if nflx goes below 30000opportunity to buy buy buy
hulu reduced their monthly fee should netflix be scared after all hulu is competing from that space we can also look at this from another angle the only business that i saw reduce prices in th past are companies in desperation like block buster when they reduced their prices to compete with netflix movie houses when they rolled out 10 a month unlimited movies and many more to list reducing prices on already established price point is a move from a position of weakness folks

i think anyone investing big on nflx should balance out between nflx and dis i exit all my short on nflx last week should have waiting until thursday but i decided to exit completely and didnt stopi do went long on dis on friday also fbhere are reason why1 disney launch of espn stream will likely huge success lot of people waiting for that this should known in 6 month2 this might help netflix somewhat not whole lot of as most in usa at least already have netflix with sharing i think 8090 penetrated which is incredible but also mean not much left to gain  and most international market specially development country cable is still much cheaper than streaming service3 espn pricing means netflix lost pricing power now it will compared with espn also most of local channel either easily available through antenna or free with advertisement on most of tv streaming box apps like abc nbc fox3 as disney launch full streaming service their offering will appealing and remove any remaining pricing power netflix has it might forced to lower price depend on how aggressive disney is

whose buying here and i don’t mean covering

i have been a follower and stock holder of nflx for quite a long while mostly i traded the stock made some gains i wish that i had held my initial position currently i hold a very small position ahead of earnings nflx continues to be a long hold especially considering their international expansion aspirations all this talk about the 8 billion they spend on content is just too nearsighted good luck to all
ill have my money in googl and disney and netflix why because if disney loses out to comcast which is hated then i see disney doing a deal with netflix or googl disney has worked with netflix in the past not to buy then out but to work together once again googl could also work with netflix and has the money to buy them out oh yea lets not forget about apple they have the money to purchase netflix as well
nflx is going no where i sold after the pop in price do to the news of the monthly price hike and so far am right to do so the markets are very strong and ill wait for a good sized pull back until buying back in
short covering started next stop 350
if you look at the recent transaction with att and hulu to value netflix you get a market cap of 90110 billion nearly 35 below their current price
once apple and disney get there act together in nflxs space nflx has to move down to the 18500 range its just common sense the quesiton is when

buy buy buy 330 is coming
way over valued
expected it
anyone else tired of that “big quarter expected from netflix” news constantly on the top they should fix it
nflx is a streaming channel among many production companies are creating their own streaming channels to stream their own productions the writing was always on the wall why else would nflx invest so much in producing their own shows 150 billion is much too generous thats why nflx has a lot of downside ahead of it
charts on nflx says its a screaming buy beyond 377

god i love this stock been holding it for years ive ignored all the naysayers dismiss it countless times over the years because it always defies the skeptics and critics and i credit reed hastings for much of the stocks resilience and growth he never hesitates to admit when hes messed up and always offers a solution to fix it  and hes always been right so far even earlier today when the stock was getting sold off some were speculating on this board that smart money must have known something ahead of the earnings release  when clearly they didnt

what is a noncurrent asset every quarter netflix balances its balancesheet by increasing its noncurrent assets noncurrent assets stand at almost 13 billion i understand why debt is evaluated based upon current and noncurrent status  it makes sense to understand where one stands presently in business compared to obligations going forward but what is netflix putting values on with these noncurrent assets
to increase growth you need better content i was upset that one of my favorite shows was taken off more content investment equals more cost which may or may not payoff

as netflix concentrate original content on each country it is currently in every locally produced content it makes gets netflix closer to local acceptance as an example in japan netflix penetration is still low but as netflix produce local content specific for that country the japanese will slowly adapt to a netflix subscription how do i know this because japanese tend to consume their own products historically and most countries are somewhat the same including the united states this is the golden age for netflix as no other streaming media is able to execute in that spaceeven disney is at least 5 to 10 years from scratching that market

great week i loaded up on nflx and cgc monday runs are not over cgc might putts around before popping again but nflx clearly going to breakout big into earnings not sure about earnings itself but will run up to next week
once again pesky nflx shorties learn the hard way why you dont bet against this juggernaut if you want a decent short return go bet against a stock that isnt working like nkla in the past 5 days the stock has fallen from 65 to 20 a lot more than the pocket change nflx shorts have made those that are still here like sonnyblack will find themselves squeezed out eventually 600 is coming and ill be making money while the shorts file for bankruptcy
taking a poll tomorrow when i wake up i will do one of two things thumbs up if i should go in the backyard and set a pile of cash on fire thumbs down if i should log into my computer and buy nflx
for those of you that think nflx will go up for ever lete tell you this some of you may remember 19992000 where 2 stocks sun microsystems and cisco were rocketing just like nflx virtually over night they came down to earth wiping many shareholders out of their savings and retirement nflx is gonna crash and burn the same way
this is one of the more popular stocks that actually will grow i bet it reaches 400 in the next year pay no attention to lowering of target prices
so high wait for better price
why no one catch netflixhttpswwwwsjcomarticleswhynoonecancatchnetflix1535205600modmhp
i didnt realise that this stock goes down
grab if before earnings if you can i trust netflix they never overstate their subscribers growth im expecting a subscription growth on 67mil in total this quarter
everyone is afraid that tomorrow will be a down day and selling it af hours it is going to be an up day tomorrow
second lockdown coming expect nflx to skyrocket 50100
for every negative that comes out for netflix it’s much worse for other streaming services by comparison estimates are for hulu to lose 25 billion this year it has been competing against netflix for 12 years it has lasted that long because of support from all the big media companies can any other streaming service do that much better than hulu you can’t achieve proper increased spending needed for sustained subscriber growth if you’re losing that much money
you can keep your plan
wow i am so glad i walked away from buying puts on this stock since the last earnings  just looked again this morning what a gift above 400 for put options  and the guy with the new 500 price target saying that nflx was the lebron james of content as part of his 500 price target justification spoke to me that the end is near for both nflx and amzn you know what im talking about if you paid attention in how to value a company class
they missed going to 300
this has been the most rewarding turnaround ive experience this year up 40 in a couple hours go go go nflx and thank you
my previous message was deleted because i used a persons name which starts with an s
its going lower why
dont try to find a bottom as it is much lower than this keeps making a new low
well im ruined nothing i can do but hold my short now and pray for a miracle too much margin the system is rigged
strap in here we go again
for all the people who say going down cause you can get free a month or say stream online only a small percentage are like you people dont worry about penny pinching so much alot of people support what they like they understand for them to keep getting these shows they subscribe im sorry a small percentage if people are so frugal with there money to me its kind of sad because even at minimum wage you can afford this not to say that if say a large amount of family have this and it pleases more than just 1 or 2 people i feel sorry you you guys people spend there money on material things when this provides entertainment and moments with familys and friends that are much more valuable lol

the main reason nflx growth was down last qtr was because of world cup soccer time to buy
netflix is saying they save 30 by producing their own content or they acquire 30 more content when they produce their own more content leads to faster subscriber growth expectations need to be raised again
if you are looking to buy wait for it to find a base stocks don’t typically trade in v formations but rather ws wait for it to hit a double bottom while it bases for several weeks trust me on this don’t try to catch a falling knife

ok with the fervor dying down a bit i’d like to reask my question from yesterday netflix has a massive debt load interest rates are going up has anyone looked into how this will impact their profitsnot trying to attack just wonderingand to head off the one response i got yesterday i know they are saying they will not need to borrow new money but they still have to deal with the debt they already have and interest rates will not remain constant as debt is refinanced or as bond values go down
appointing rice and signing the obamas was for one reason  international subscriber growth in order to realize its heady targets nflx must penetrate and be the top one or two streaming services in a large percentage of countries imo hastings apparently feels trump damages american prestige and in turn nflx prospects so he is using the dynamic duo obamarice to assuage the world and ensure nflx can succeed in these countriesthe fact that nflx would be willing to take the risk of angering 12 of the usa in order to build intl bridges for nflx tells me that hastings and co are desperate for the subscriber growth that will only happen if the world embraces nflx this is not a good signso my thoughts have evolved on this sure hastings is a lib has a vehicle for spreading the message and can use the dynamic duo to do so but he did this for business not political reasons i believe his reasoning is not sound and demonstrates the challenges the company faces
was just reading about disney bulls instead of yelling it doesnt matter why dont you do your homework and learn the facts the most meaningful fact is disney content makes up 1012 of the content being streamed right now on nflx disneys content is being removed from the nflx in full this year disney is not only disney movies they own marvel lucasflims pixar and national geographic they already have 2 original star wars series set their content is known world wide their library without out any new content is the largest and most well known not just in the us but the world disney will be cheaper than netflix it will appeal to children and adults nflx sends more on content than any studio in the world except disney this is disneys game and they are entering the arena at time when nflx is massive growth or bus ask yourself what library well be worth more in the end one that owns the loin king star wars every marvel ever made or a library that owns orange is the new black and bird box
tomorrow 350 friday 400

reed hastings is smiling all day today i wonder why 
the ratio of the dow over nflx increased today back over 60 on a closingprice basis this means that relative to the dow nflx got weaker
day trading this stock wasn’t the best idea was it fellas
i hate to do it but i shorted this stock today and will make some cheese tomorrow not a fan of shorting but its all about making money this company will be fine and will crush in the future but i sure i am glad it’s getting crushed tomorrow
all aboard next stop 350
this is why i learned a long time ago the hard way  the company did not change  it was trump
watch for a major drop price is getting way ahead of the financials soon there will be a correction and watch the frothy stocks get a 4050 cut
the market has corrected and nflx is oversold will go back to over 300 quickly
great rally to end the day folks bottom line is this though this will trade within a 10 point window in either direction until the q1 earnings call 9 mill subscribers sends this up 20 points and ultimately to 400 in weeks to follow they miss the 89 million subscriber number and we have a big problem on our hands and we need to sell cause the growth story is what buries the pe ratio its that simple
too much positive expectations on this board tells me its going down but i cant bring myself to sell

another q additional 524 m  of negative free cash flow around 2 b for the whole year and another 16 b raised in debt total debt is up from 33 to 65 b in one year looks good  this company is burning cash fast no wonder its debt has junk rating but the shareholders seem to ignore it all they look at is subscriber growth its like year 2000 is back
sorry i am going to short this
when this stock move into positive even when market was going down i thought to cover my short and only short around 280 i think i need to start writing and using robo algorithms without it i have too much emotions to deal with
at last the stock didnt justify its 80 move in 3 months and was all hype
could be wrong but i think this may have finally bottomed out if you sold it may be a good time to buy back in just where my thought process is at
i prepare to buy more at 310
there it is 300
what a surprise back to where it opened
nice movie bird box
the longs laughed two years ago when i said that it is a mathematical certainty that this company will be bankrupt in five years the voices agreeing with me are growing louder and louder as the debt continues to grow with still no path for stopping the hemorrhaging reed hastings is bernie madoff but much much better
from the release bear case has blown upwe believe we are very close to being sustainably fcf positive for the full year 2021 we currentlyanticipate free cash flow will be around break even vs our prior expectation for 1 billion to breakeven combined with our 82 billion cash balance and our 750m undrawn credit facility we believew eno longer have a need to raise external financing for our daytoday operations

article on credit suisse rating for netflix470 price target and outperform ratingpeople always comment on their growing dept but what they dont realize is the dept per subscriber has remained fairly flat and that subscribers have been growing for years in 2012 there were less than 40 million subs and now they have over 140 million subs and still growingthis stock will see mid 400s in just a few months check the barrons article belowhttpswwwbarronscomarticlestheeuroisdueforarebound1538146881

vaccine means more employment and more disposable money how is this a negative for nflx
i bought at 1974 sold some at 400 and 350 i’m still obviously up but i am thinking of selling some now so i don’t lose any more or just wait and see if it goes up again don’t know what to do
feels like groundhogs day traders are so silly sometimes hopefully these vaccines work but that doesn’t mean i’m selling amzn or nflx lol being on the opposite side of the long airlines cruise ships etc makes me feel even better those companies are largely in financial ruin by the time covid is under control it will take them time to recover we will see bankruptcies before this is over
it’s hard to believe that even after that massive breakout we’re only up 6 for 2021
earnings dont matter it is just meant to be up because we are in a bubble enjoy till it bursts

the sharks are circling pe and pb are screaming 2000 i give this market 3 months and all the fresh marks will go down like they did back then just a matter of time
i see a 3 gain on the day end
dont be fooled by the game netflix plays by beating international subscriber estimates nearly all of the upside to international subscriber adds is generated from low gdp per capita countries like india indonesia malaysia etc per member per month pricing in these regions is a fraction of what nflx charges in the us and europe
if nflx cannot hit 1000 in 3 months amzn will below 1000

inside sources say that netflix is going to release news imminently that’ll result in a huge increase in stock price i am betting this hits 55000 by wednesday you heard it hear first
buy 300 by wednesday next week
i guess the high pe is scaring some investors due to what they say is nose bleed well i guess my amzn was that way too at one time but look what happenedjust  a major investor said years ago buy what you like and others do as well and invest in it well for me that meets the requirements for investing in netflix if i had to pay 15 a month id still use itno politics if i care not to watch them and the greatest thing no fng commercialswe do have cable for my wife by the way since she likes to watch her stuff for me i havent watch nothing but netflix for two yearsill give a prediction i think there is a good chance that netflix will double their subscription base in 23 yearswhy because everyone i know has it and loves it
shorts have gotten obliterated betting against this name its like salmons swimming upstream where the end result is just tragic
boom just logged a 100 point swing gain on nflx now be careful here my novice traders nflx does not go straight up it will get a pullback soon to lower levels key levels we know then go long again for another 30 to 50 points also if you know our system there is an easy 20 point short coming up here soon at key level come join us and start logging gains in 2019

nflx will be bullish through their earnings on tuesday
netflix nflx has 2 splits in our netflix stock split history database the first split for nflx took place on february 12 2004 this was a 2 for 1 split meaning for each share of nflx owned presplit the shareholder now owned 2 shares for example a 1000 share position presplit became a 2000 share position following the split nflxs second split took place on july 15 2015 this was a 7 for 1 split meaning for each share of nflx owned presplit the shareholder now owned 7 shares for example a 2000 share position presplit became a 14000 share position following the split
i wish my phone would catch fire so i can’t check this thing anymore
remember when netflix was 8 down over 80 content producers were raising prices apple comcast and verizon said they were going to launch streaming services nearly half the floated shares were held short they laughed at hastings when he said streaming would eventually replace cable tv and netflix was leading the way
like i said love netflix power house wish i had more cash
almost disney market cap there is a limit to the value of a streaming service with a reproducible business model
buy 250 puts very cheap and huge potential
upward pressure continues
the stock is a bargain at this level thanks me in a month after academy awards

netflix is in a slump with big tv series hits they need a few more like the queen’s gambit

its gonna pop after earnings and im pretty sure we gonna see 350 by next friday
nflx is a great idea and a great company it is just that its stock price has become bloated this is just a modern version of a cable network tw or comcast but does not own the pipe to your home so cant sell other services so it is more like a broadcasting company abc or nbc with less content albeit perhaps more entertaining so how does it garner a market cap equal to 75 of disneys whos content rakes as well as other streams of revenue 5 times the top line revenue of nflx and 6 times nflx earnings this bloated pig of a stock will trade below 100share probably below 50 during the next downturn
let me just say one thing ha ha
like watching a ball stop midair what’s next
seems like an awful lot of bulls in here going into earnings for a stock down 100 from its highs

as of january 18 2018 china held 17 trillion of our debt in fact china is our largest creditor and will make a fortune with interest rates rising here iq is largely known as the netflix of china and they report earnings in just over a week we already know they will do very well because they beat expectations last time and raised guidance other oversold chinese companies that are a must buy before earnings for the same reasons are bidu and momo like i said earlier dont worry about netflix here theyll pop again before you know it china has been in a bear market because of the trade war however the selloff in many of these companies is too extreme to last take advantage of it and happy investing
nflx has weak content on par with free services such as plutotv of course nflx cannot even touch youtube as far as content and overall usefulness
netflix gonna blast off after earnings
there is a reason netflix is shooting up guys  i’ll leave it to you to find out  but i’m very bullish for earnings and think this should see 400
opened position  468 after seeing resisting to nasdaq drop gl all
nflx is up 1213 to 25519
yesssssssss 370 touched
after hrs 2000
and here’s the sell off yet again biggest regret of my life buying this before earnings
how do you buy after close
it will go up tomorrow
380 by day end 405 week end
netflix was going up too much now its time to come down
not a horrible drop horrible i mean by apple losing 30
what a great buying opportunity here will be well above 400 by christmas imho
thank god didnt sell my 550 calls
this pop is irrational i am a long holder dont ge me wrong i love it but theres no way it can be justified much better earnings reports of netflix have yielded much smaller gains this is part of the insane market right now i wish it wasnt but it will correct
consensus is building that the stock would trade above 400 in 12 months as more and more analysts raise subscriber growth projections
the results were so good googl and amzn went up 5
why
when netflix does nothing but win
hundreds of thousands canceled over the weekend and states now looking into criminal activity on this bad time to be in on this stock short field day at the open
a phone company taking over a pioneer in tv and movies att trading near a 5 year low tells you those assets will be squandered
amzon prime took 1m nflx customers in one month
remember tesla everyone bashed and it hit 2000 before the split and again they will rock netflix is the future and the king
faangs are back baby  aapl msft and amzn earnings coming soon give me 600 nflx today
house of cards the sequel
nflx could give away free subs and burn cash for the next 10 years and this market would still reward it
mm wont let it go higher today because of calls sold next week it goes higher again and calls will be sold for end of week 520530 possible next week
280 pe lul
525 is still possible today
market down scroo it ill watch netflix
god i love netflix
if a stock has had a huge run up before earnings sell it before the announcement
back over 500 before earnings thank you to anyone who sold shares greatly appreciated
congrats longs
9 drop over past few days without any news and without major volume analysts and fansfoes all over the place with price targets q3 results one week away looks like a trade setup to me sell the rumor and buy the news nflx should fall a bit more and then recover back to 380 post earnings nice opportunity
truly loaded 405 call option 100 contract at 30 cent will hold till friday losing 3000 or gaining let’s see
buy aapl
i’ve had netflix for a long time and i think they need to look to make more money off the subs somehow or this thing is going to start going down
the shorts had their day in the sandbox yesterday and had fun i am so happy for them now it will be time for them to start losing money again with earning season to begin soon and with nflx reporting in 3 weeks methinks nflx will be closer to 450 than 350 let is be said and watch it get done
there are not many good moviesshows to watch on netflix
how many big over 50b market cap companies can tack on 10 or over 8 billion in market cap in one week on essentially no news this reminds me of amzn a couple years ago at this rate it could be amzn size in a couple years crazy could surpass 100b market cap by end of next week
too big to fall
5 weeks of going nowhere upgrade after upgrade finally breaking out

i’m seeing here same lame comments that i saw in tesla when it was at 250 a month ago look at it now netflix will bounce up in no time did it before and will do it again
im new to investing yesterday i learned a very important lesson about setting a stop loss
up 27 today
see all you shorts at 330 friday
i find it funny that people are posting on here as if today’s price action indicates something regarding netflix most of the market is getting hit today this stock isn’t immune but it’s a great buying opportunity
read hastin sells 24b in stock in the prior quarter but who cares he says sold to you the retail investor
based on gift card sales were expecting pt of 418 with great q4 and increased rates content is still king and netflix is way cheaper than cablerainbow financial services
i said months ago that regardless of the large revenue they simply spend too much money and cannot keep growing much anything over 80 is too expensive
385 coming
68 million adds and 21 split coming shorts will be begging for mercy 550 call options are very cheap buy
already 13m pre market

trading doesn’t have to be about losing all the time it doesn’t have to be about letting the markets pummel you day in day out fight back with httprightpickercom beef up your defenses and join them
overall good earning but i am not impressed with earning while its nice they beating subscriber number it come at much higher cost balance sheet isnt in great shapehere is thing i like1 subscriber grow by another 72m while i like everyone expected this2 revenue per subscriber raise little bitthing i dont like1 marketing cost raising much faster nearly 71 year over year even higher than q4 last year 2 revenue per subscriber raise is lower when you compare history and recent price hike without hike it was going 152 up as people subscriber higher quality plans with raise last quarter with most not raised until near end of year its up only 483 content spend is getting crazy i think if they hit unexpected peak for subscriber those content cost very hard to pay for i think level of sharing is unknown but if its higher than 50 i think it might even paused early next year 4 with disney and apple going to enter risk of subscriber growth stall is even higher
any news
we had a strong close we going to run cup formation confirmed on the 4hour chart lets gooofly nflx fly
so nflx has the same market cap as att so if hbo max gets 100m subscribers in one year it should be worth 1t so how do these valuations work

nflx close 565 and open tomorrow 650 
what is this about amzn er having effect on netflix stock prices do you watch netflix while ordering online on amazon or do you put netflix on hold while rush out to front door to pick up amazon delivery if you do any of these activities multitasking then there is nothing to worry about either one
hope it goes up another 10 to 15 points tonorrow
let the buying begin stop the with the 1 or 2 let’s rock n roll to 10 today let’s show the stock market who we are and have them talk about how netflix is coming back strong green green green i counting on everyone today prove me wrong
the higher it goes the larger it will fall worth no more than 30 bucks with disney coming on massive balloon waiting to burst
told the shorts earlier this week to cover after the 327 close tech analysis is a beautiful thing read a book shorties
too much free stuff on the net for nflx to be able to increase prices and retain subsobumer hiring will cost them dearly too it already ishilarious fact
looks like some flies got caught in the spiders web
swingtrade it looks like 385 is getting further away glad i didnt listen to you

why no one can catch netflixby marketwatch— 644 pm et 08262018knocking netflix  nflx loadingloading is easy critics say the streaming company cant grow without big spending making it impossible to turn a profit but that assessment misses the key insight driving netflixs  nflx loadingloading success and why the stock is likely to climb again after last months tumblewhat netflix  nflx loadingloading understands is that getting subscribers and just as important keeping them is everything in the new media environment the definition of success has shifted from how many eyeballs a channel can grab on a given night to how effectively a piece of content helps retain subscribers month after month that insight has propelled netflix  nflx loadingloading far ahead of hulu and prompted the costly takeover battle between comcastcmcsa and walt disneydis for 21st century foxfoxa assetsit is also why netflix  nflx loadingloading is sweeping up hollywood talent earlier this month netflix  nflx loadingloading wooed kenya barris the creator of blackish away from disney signing him to an exclusive multiyear deal netflix  nflx loadingloading has also nabbed producers ryan murphyfrom 21st century fox httpswwwwsjcomarticlesnetflixsignsproducerryanmurphytomultimilliondollar deal1518588414 and shonda rhimesfrom disney httpswwwwsjcomarticlesnetflixsignsscandalcreatorshondarhimes awayfromabcasbattlefortalentescalates1502683261 it is expected to book 8 billion in expenses this year though it will likely spend closer to 12 billion according to michael morris a media analyst at guggenheim securities to some those numbers seem excessive but by spending to have the best content netflix  nflx loadingloading is locking in its subscribers and locking out its competitorsnetflixs  nflx loadingloading great advantage over its rivals is it doesnt need to show profits as long as the subscriber numbers keep climbing profits can come at netflix  nflx loadingloading when it has locked in enough subscribers who keep paying for content at higher pricesthe major risk for netflix  nflx loadingloading is that it somehow miscalculates what its subscribers want and doesnt draw in as many as expected that happened last quarter httpswwwwsjcomarticlesnetflixreportsweakerthanexpectednumberofnew subscribers1531771717 when the stock tumbled 14 but netflix  nflx loadingloading has had many tumbles over the years and strong growth has resumed thanks to its algorithm netflix  nflx loadingloading knows better than anyone else what kind of content it needs and when to launch it to keep subscribers happydisneys streaming services set to launch next year are the only possible threat to netflix  nflx loadingloading but netflix  nflx loadingloading has a giant lead it will take disney years to catch up in part because lots of disney content is still licensed to netflix  nflx loadingloadingadmittedly the bar for netflix  nflx loadingloading shares is higher now and investors are nervous about whether it can keep growing at the same levels but netflix  nflx loadingloading has plenty of eyeballs still to sweep upnot only in international markets such as india and south america but also at home where cordcutting continues apacenetflixs  nflx loadingloading big lead may be its most important strength it can keep bringing in talent which will bring in new subscribers and keep existing ones happy it will take a powerful competitor to break that cycle
reality check
i think nflx is a sellshortbut carefullyprobably runs up on monday and starts to sell offshort a little with a stopadd as it falls only if it fallsi think apple mattersi think amazon mattersi think their huge debt mattersi think the recession has started and we have just experienced a bear market bounce rallyand things soon start to head southwe had three major peaks on the all time indices charts the internet bubble the financial bubble the just now bubbleeach show extreme obvious peaks and we have started down againwe could see some upside due to the china negotiations etcthe debt celiings discussions start in marchjust my honest opinion
i’m saving 15 bucks a month right now￼
i bought more at 185 hope the drop is done
even mr wonderful from shark tank said loves netflix and going to buy more it’s a no nobrainer
hope we can keep this momentum
goodbye netflix you never had the movie i wanted to watch anyway
next stop 350
today confirm 330 breakout watch above 32944 no resistance in area just above
big up day tomorrow to 330334 then up all next week into earnings then great earnings and great guidance for 2019 what a great time the next 2 weeks will be happy happy joy joy     400 in a month then question will be what happens next
we have pretty good support at 338if it does pull back again its only a buy opportunity we should be hitting 380s soon
looks like this is going to 330 today likely 350 by end of the week and then 400 before earnings release after that i would expect at least 500 by end of april that would give it a market cap of 216 billion seems like 700 by the end of the year is doable if they can continue to beat on subs
if nflx announces a stock split 600 will be taken out
selling half at 664 which means i doubled and holding the rest for 5 more years cheers
someone are donating  to the brokerage banks by buying 581
looks like another all time high at opening go netflix
dont recommend shorting when trading thins out easier for them to push around shares need to be sold by golly and the price needs to be higher all should give you pause step gingerly
nflx will keep growing internationally huge growth opportunities with over 3000 million potential viewers globally
as predicted it was weak this morning i hope you took advantage of the dip below 209 to pick up some more i predicted a slight green finish today lets see if we can get there
what will nflx close at tomorrow
despite falling subscriber numbers and terrible er and lowered guidance they are pumping nflx bubble again
fb is up and nflx to follow we just need 1to break technical resistance
they keep touting the low price of disney vs netflix but that is the basic plan so who knows what the full price plan is anyone
so amzn had a great quarter nut weak guidance and nflx had a great quarter and great guidance and the stock went down does not make sense
sorry guys but how sane should u be to buy something with pe ratio over 260 no really exponential growth are you sure
was a fake pump premarket and that squeezed shorts no one is buying at these levels need to go to 500 to make it attractive
it is time to take profits hopefully up one more day i will get tomorrow morning and buy back friday this week
for all who have only very negative things almost hateful to say about nflx if you don’t like the stock move on why waste your time posting this stuff there can be thoughtful dissent and disagreement but i’m hearing a lot of folks getting emotionally worked up my advice find a stock you like and make some money on what you believe is positive news amazing how much energy is wasted on something you are seeing and getting no benefit from daw
500 after earning
a company with 3 billion in cash 5 billion in current liabilities and 10 billion iin long term debt will be bankrupt
recovering nicely back to previous high in no time
could we see this week 350
buying or holding the bubble right now is just like buying and holding any stock in jan 2000 history repeats itself always
get in now why red this will be green eod and fly 5 by eod tomorrow
disney ups bid for fox disney comcast biding war over fox is positive for netflix
now nflx needs to announce a split 51
new highs are inevitable pension hedge funds and fan boys will make it so
what do you guys think this will be at open
buy and hold moon bound
after growth investors try everything else they will all eventually come back to nflx
too many people buying put options expiring today the machine keep it above 265 for maximum gain on the house
i predict 10 on early monday 62518 it went up on speculations and will go down because of lacking fundamental reasons to support current price
sold at 395 will buy back around 375380
if today going up  so deutsche bank and usb are made up story so they can buy cheap stock fake news
sitting on house money now sold half when was up 136 a while back and it wont stop
short it you might get lucky but more likely you gonna lose money
breakout coming 
nflx is the only fang stock you can buy at big discount at this price levelyou will see 400 soonsimilarly it happened in july2010 after missing est and then back to uptrend in one week or so
this stock kind of reminds me of netscape during the browser wars its just a matter of time before the big guns get it together and grab the majority of market share the win is that netflix would be a great acquisition for either apple or disney imho

im risking a lot by telling you guys thismy friend tried shorting nflx once before earnings when he got back home from work that night there was a masked man waiting for him that beat him up and trashed his place they never caught the masked man but he wrote his initials in blank dvds on the wall rhim not saying it was reed hastings but im not saying it wasnt reed hastingsmoral of the story is dont short this ever

as long as this stock is over 200 is still not too late to short this balloon the pe on nflx is over 112 even after todays sell off this stock will be less than 150 within a few months
mark my words netflix will be 450 by end of this year
they bring on a netflix pumper right before the closing bell to prevent another run off they have all the bases covered on this one they upgrade in the morning and pump in the afternoon
article today someplace appears authentic but frivolous not bothering with the link stating traders are positioning ahead of earnings for the inevitable decline after earnings im counter positioned with short term calls and shares after 3 quarters of misses time for a beat
to all u negative nancys out there moodys released a report saying netflix will be cash positive by 2022 wit a projected 20 point margin this stock will continue to go up its still very young
feels like earnings never happened
anyone notice a quarterly trend here right before earnings and  of subscribers release the stock dips to sub 500 right after the market closes and the company reports the stock shoots right up it appears it happen the last 3 quarters

yessir netflix signing up millions at 50 cents a month in third world countries while jacking up prices in usa there’s a growth model worth every bit of a 150 pe
heyon what platform can i trade this stock
always remember if your short what your looking at 126 pe 10 billion in debt after a keep the lights on junk bond sale of 2 billion its pump and dump manipulation there is no value here long term only endless hype with a massive debt reality topped with aging technology that every tech entertainment co is now throwing their hat in mix
it’s over easy short to 425
i saw 20 billion in upward gaps within a short period check it out then you see these huge ram it ups then you see high speed trading tricks market orders fills maybe above the ask and bid hundreds of times in my honest opinion its part of the ponzi scheme cmg trades at well over pe  100 a mexican restaurant doesnt appear to have much growth at all dangerous short
they needed to lose 2b to cover notesnow its down 29b so time to buy
every time nflx raised price the came short on their earnings this speaks volume about what to see in future it has stiff competition and competitors are catching up it is getting hard to get new subscribers so increasing prices just like medical insurance companies limited consumers so keep raising prices to stay in profiti see more red in coming days and monthsnow that they raised the price less new consumers will be attracted netflix had price benefit over amazon prime now that they are kinda of same in pricingit will be hard to convince new consumers
netflix always is my biggest holding even when i sell it off if i kept it all i could have been rich
i would not buy anything until things come back in under 50 or 100 day the market is going to sell off through earnings season last q was peak for most
has anyone else noticed or been disturbed that netflix and amazon do not offer any holiday classics for free especially in the time of covid they are experiencing great increase in business yet not giving anything back un american get you some more money netflix merry x mas

amazon almost caught netflix several years ago and then netflix pulled away now disney will try it they have no choice streaming is the only thing the stock market is willing to reward them for
my indian neighbor cancelled netflix because he said to watch any good or popular movie such as titanicetc you have to pay a rental fee between 299 and 399nflx pe is way too high to justify the price of 265 many other attractive companies with much lower pe such as google pe 38 fb pe 22 amzn pe 85 baba pe 40etc
i got those 420 and 430 calls for super cheap ty shorts 
the reason nflx is worth much less circa 40 is that video is free  think all the amazing free stuff on youtube including university lectures from x to triple xxx sports movies on prime for those who want free prime shipping etc netflix worth no more than 20 to 40 even ge is a million times a better investment than nflx
netflix is down 577 to 48502
if they get 200 million subscribers and they will get it they will generate 20 billion a year 15 billions for tv shows a year that is a 1000 episodes of the most expensive episode of game of thrones a year almost 3 a day

how high will this go
guys 400 on the way congratulations
unless nflx is growing at 80 a pe of 170 is too highif nflx is only growing at 15 then the value might be 15170375  33its ten times too pricey based on a 15 growth5 times is you use the forward pe putting it worth 66they turned into bitcoin

todd gordon was on cnbc after whiffing badly on his short trade he tried desperately to say it won’t break out to new highs after slamming earningssubs and guiding next quarter for more than expected subs his take is nothing more than arrogant and self serving like most of these other so called “experts” who lowered their estimate into earnings some people never learn i trust rh congrats to all longssee ya’ll at 500
lost money on seven trades in a row but made it all back on my next trade thanks to httptradenowxyz
weird rarely do i feel so good about a stock that loses 21 points in a day
have to say thank you google 
ok its down 3 days in a row down 36 or 91 based on the lower sub growth right now its hard to imagine this ever going up again you can picture another big down day tomorrow with traders wanting to get out of their positions before the weekend there is new competition coming negative cash flow thats ongoing and a bloated pe thats hard to justify on the other hand ive thought that same way many times in the past and somehow this thing always turns around and powers to new highs this is the most loved stock ive ever experienced and im betting it turns around and eventually gets back to 400 i know that sounds crazy right here and some day this has to turn down and return to a normal pe but im betting this has one more run up before that happens i admit i may be wrong but i have history on my side

here is another aspect to look at nflx subscriber raiseif you compare nflx is favorite among teenagersyoung people which other app has similar user group snapchatsnapchat quickly raise their subscriber faster than any other social media but now hardly have any growth reason unlike adultold who take time to use new things teneger young people will immediately jump on trendin other word netflix might growth 200m very quickly but i think it will have very very hard time to grow beyond that there are lot of challengesand any one think they can raise price to justify valuation look how cautious they are with small price increase they yet to realize raise after 3 month for most of subscriber they will only realize after next 3 month this mean price increase is not easy

you better start accumulating folksonce this train departs theres no coming back
just remember a couple of things netflix has hired the best people to make their own owned contenta lot of people feel that netflix will be beholden to others content maybe their prices will go up or maybe these content holders will see the audience subscribers increase so much they want their content on netflix and the prices for these content holders and may not try to push their weight on netflix and lose a large viewing public around the world just a thought by the way there are other companies that would love to have a netflix of their own but it would cost billions to do itmaybe netflix could be a target if the price is right if it happens then disney is the one id bet on they already have a great relationship with netflix to me that would be a marriage from heaven

if you compare nflx and amzn against googl nvda fb then you will realize how smart move this isgoogl nvda and fb all about same growth rate only thing different is those generate lot of profit vs amzn and nflx actually have negative cash flow fb and googl actually trading discounted forward pe just 2 year out than sp 500 overallso why nflx keep going all time high vs other nottwo reason1 nflx and amzn ceomanagement active pumping stock price other are not something that fan club love2 big player know its way inflated they love it they pushing trend follower to these two and other such stocks while reduce them from quality companies they are very successful i thinkso what might happen nextwe dont know when this happen it all depend on how strong retail interest remain and how much further margin debt used by retail investors what is limit before big player exit long position and what is limit when they dump everything  go actually short but my prediction this will happen amzn and googl right now have 425 difference i think in year or so this likely 200 could be negativesame with nflx it likely trade lower than nvda also might fb in year out if you can handle temporary paper lossi recomend go long on googl  fb nvdago short on amzn and nflx i think you will not regret strategy year out you likely profit limited to 1015 but again risk is limited

nflx smashing shorts and roku about just hit 300 good day
i sold my remaining shares around 520 my take is we all know netflix is doing great and will likely post a great quarter the problem is their outlook will be compared against 2020 while i think 2021 will be a strong year for nflx i think people will focus on comparisons to 2020 sub adds i’m guessing it probably sells off on earnings if it does so i will look to get back in

if this drop is a result of this  drugmaker pfizer and biotechnology company biontech announced on monday that the candidate vaccine they are developing which is in phase 3 clinical trials has an efficacy rate of 90 when assessed seven days after the second dose was administered just my opinion but its a ridiculous knee jerk reaction for something that wont truly be ready to distribute for months so investors and i use the term loosely dump nflx on short term speculation not days or weeks but months

if it turns green today that will be a big plus
if you value netflix strictly by its ability to make money by subscription only then your not looking at the big picture netflix is in the midst of a transformation this company just like it did when it switch to streaming is again transforming into a media company you can see from the steady stream of media talent it has acquired and property location it has purchased the ramp up in netflix original movies is not just for its subscription business it is part of a larger business transformational strategy the cost of making movies for netflix is going to go down further as they become more of a movie studio than a streaming company
we gonna copy amazon tomorrow
380 is another resistance level does not beat 380 hope it does it today
come on move like nflx is moving now
earnings were better than expected additional subscriber numbers faltered when people got spring fever and came out of hibernation after an extended long long winter analysts  their pants selling ensued panic reigned high stock tanked incidentally netflix is still the same fortified leader in streaming content it was before the 2q earnings report disney will take some time to properly competeeven then humans are not quick to change habits

debtflixs junk bond addctionwhen netflix nflx priced a 19b junk bond deal early last week it got me pondering the companies with the largest equity market capitalizations in the highyield corporate debt space after all you do not often see companies with a 135b market cap issuing highyield debt while the equity market is painting a rosy outlook for the internet entertainment and digital content company the outlook from the rating agencies and bond market is less optimistic netflixs new tenyear debt carried a 5875 coupon a 291bp spread over treasuries at issuance the interest cost on netflixs debt is roughly 2 higher than where highquality lowlevered arated companies issue debt in todays marketwhen we look at the companies in the highyield corporate bond market hyg jnk with the largest equity market caps netflix certainly stands out it is nearly twice as large from a capitalization perspective as the next largest junkrated company charter communications chtr

stocks up markets up around the world and netflix is drowning in the red zone this stock is not for seniors
everyone knows about netflix netflix is the biggest streaming site in the world the confidence and the trust for netflix is really high the stock value is about 80 times more than the revenue we feel confident in that price target higher than todays valuei wanna give you a tips a streaming site mavshack that has been active as long as the netflix was active until 2011 had a stock value not even three times more then the revenue until a few days ago in 2011 netflix was worth as most 48 dollars only a year later in 2012 it went down to 7 even though netflix had 26 million subscribers it was increasing in subscribers netflix was worth in its bottom only 700 today 2020 netflix is worth around 500 that means that netflix increased its stock value with more than 7000 since its bottom in 2012 mavshack have had a similar road until now as netflix had its first 10 year on the market until 2012 mavshack is increasing alot in the amount of subscribers but the stock value have not shown its true value the stock value has been very volatile and also has been on a down side for a long time many investors been sceptical an pessimism have been around the stock for a whilebut now its going to be a change december 3rd 2020 it was announced that mavshack will start europes largest shopping studio in collaboration with the nep the worlds leading technical production company for live productions and events together with an ep marshak salma has created the markets most elegant and cost effective vr studio the market cap of mavshack is only around 12 million american dollars the stock is around its bottom i cant see it getting much lower than it is now now many feel like its abiously that the stock is going to increase with more good news about the streaming livesport coming up after realease of coronarestrictions and also the live shopping studio this stock can increase very rapidly and high in stock value my own price target for this stock is around 400 for the upcoming year i have been following this company for a long time and now i see a bright future for the company its been an annoying ride until now please do your own anilyses and look this up i feel very sure about that this stock is going to increase a lot upcoming years even though nothing in this world is totally sure maybe you would like to invest little in mavshack to get a big opportunity to get a big return out of it  i would still say netflix is a more safe option but mavshack is a great spice to it have a lot more potential to grow away higher in percentage have a pleasant day

crispr editing is a work in progress new versions of the technique are being developed with the intention of improving its accuracy and efficiency problems with one particular approach will doubtless act as a spur to innovation in others crsp to me is nothing more than a baby tsla nflx or amzn in the stock world i missed the amazon run but was able to get tsla at 30 nflx at 75 and there was plenty of negative press on all of these companies bottom line crispr editing is part of the future and when the stock dips all i see is “another buying opportunity” 
wow almost everything to the upside in my portfolio todayexcept nflxwhat a bummer i put in a stoploss order a few weeks ago at 300 originally bought my small time 40 shares at 115 so if i have to get out at 300 thats perfectly ok i would rather it start its upward climb again stay tuned i still have a cushion of 22 i have a feeling that the week to come will either give me a 7400 short term gain or we will be off to the races again thoughts

nflxs loudest detractors continue to be the ones who fear owning it they will fear buying it at 300 and 200 because the valuation will still be too high for themevery great company that has ever irreversibly changed the world has stumbled along the way nflx will have another stellar quarter eventually and to those burying it today will watch from the sidelines again
monthly options are expiring this friday the stock should move enough to surprise you make your bets up or down    or unchanged

i cut my cable i got tired of paying forprograming and then having to watch 5 minutes comericals every 20 minutes with netflex i can watch what i want when i want with no comericals netflex cost me less than cable and no comericals plus the content im offered is endless its still the best option for the price out there
in a previous post i took the revenue growth rate quarter to quarter and compounded it and got 18 growth ratethats the most up to date picture of what is going on and things got worse with coronavirusfor example nedham sees coronavirus a risk to netflixs global growth content cost went up abut 30 as wellso why does netflix deserve a pe of 94 when google has a pe of 25 disney at 176 apple at 21 all yesterdays numbers but close to today today is higherand as you know netflix has a negative cash flow of around 32 billioni think netflixs price should be cut in half at least i see half as happening quick and more later it should be on par with the competition

sq nvda nflx since drop has begun about 3 months ago it takes about 710 days from a new low to rally and then reach new lows again this friday will be that timeframe again sell into the rally don’t get caught with good gains into the rally only to watch it disappear and now go into the red because of greed this is a sell the rally market now not a buy the dip market trade accordingly
apple should have a beat tomorrow this should keep the rally going thru fri at least
so sad that people buy into one or two investors breaking the resistance
“nearly 3 dozen gop lawmakers sign letter calling on netflix to be prosecuted”cuties was not the first sicko movie to be put out by netflix but it will be the last450430 today imo but hopefully even lowershort nflx
is nflx down because dis up and is presumably is taking market share from nflx
i am selling some of my shares at 500
time to tank apple is back down this stock is doomed
the reason for the big jump according to the verge netflix nflx will be introducing price hikes for us subscribers todaythe basic plan will remain at 9 per monththe standard plan will be increased by 1 to 14 per monththe premium plan will be increased by 2 to 18
if you’re passing up this buying opportunity go get a job at mcdonalds
i need insight should i hold i got in at 415 or cut my losses early i feep it will be 500s by end of year
some day the entire market will just consist of nflx as it never goes down and that makes perfect sense perfect who else will be able to stream content but nflx and that 12 billion in debt which isnt listed on the balance sheet wont ever matter even after dis takes all of its content off nflx and starts its own streaming service nflx rules
so really what changed with the fundamentals of this company since yesterday that merits an over 4 drop
when you see nflx profits
netflix is expanding foreign language original programming that will drive subscriber growth beyond expectationscompany has unappreciated and unexploited pricing power
i got thumbs down yesterday for my comment afterhours that netflix would finish today between 360 and 370 today i still stand by my comment a lot of big money investors are using the pull back as an opportunity to buy more and average down the cost of their position others are using this as an opportunity to enter this stock how many people do you think are willing to take the the bet that netflix wont hit at least 400share by next earnings release
netflix is licensing its movies to chinas iqiyi on a movie by movie basis thats the way for the company to enter china
any thoughts on a split price way to high for people to buy in
at netflix old subscription pricing i did not really care if i watch it or not but now it is so expensive i have to think if i really need it
there is no other place to go for investing so buy and hold on tight its only going to go up more
why is insider ownership in nflx only181 
i lost 95k
oh look everything is ok now
what do i do tomorrow morning  i will buy more  thanks for cheap shares long term holder
it going down to test the 328 low guys then its gonna straddle 330 for options expiration on friday might as well get comfortable
340 calls up 1072
and the sudden sell off is because 
when it comes to netflix and disney disney has 5 times the revenue 6 tims the profit but a lower marketcap think about that for a minute if netflix manages to continue beating estimates it will still take years to live up to its ridiculous valuation even then there would have to be an absence of competition and a strong bull market just to keep this share price flat
who all are cancelling their nflx subscription now that a vaccine is coming in maybe a year
most meaningless unnecessary drop ever the only faang which has no problems with it’s audience rock solid company great technology perfect numbers 0 concerns and this is tumbles why
if you think tsla earnings is impressive wait till you see amzn today i would load up before market closes today thank me later
netflix had a blockbuster quarter for new content releases we should see a spike in cord cutting when cable companies report in january
deutsche bank raised price target to 400says nflx is becoming a cultural phenomenonthats huge
bmo upgrade to 580
resistance at 575 if crossed then 670680
analysts never get it right nflx will beat the number and guide higher
why red
nflx going to 180
this price increase just confirms that this quarter was good why would nflx raise rates on a miss to loose even more subscribers because lets face it there will be cheap ones who will btch about the 2 increase i expect a 1 million sub loss due to increase but that will clear the path for future
people can easily cancel as they advertise their account if no new contentsshows besides 1 in 6 of the people in us had signed up 300 mil population vs 55mil member which means market is saturated family with kids ac friends sharing i see this would collapse again if their contents budget is down or member not meet target 1 million missed last quarter says everything
turned green but then quickly reversed course this has no support at all i cant believe this is the invincible nflx literally the most powerful stock of the last 5 years dying right here even ah is down maybe this is truly the end and we head all the way down below 300 if this remains weak next week im out and will go short good luck to anyone trying to trade this it had a furious rebound from the big drop tuesday but then has turned around and just faded down 20 points too much pain
earnings call jul 16 2018 300 pm pdt i predict a nice recovery from today and a little run up above the 52 week prior to the call

bidens plans and policies wont work here in the us maybe in venezuela they will work or china

“over the next 5 years subscription growth will accelerate once 5g becomes available anyone within range of a cell tower signal will have access to affordable broadband internet which is whats needed for nflx that will make nflx the most affordable luxury in virtually every corner of the planet especially in areas where local tv choices have been traditionally very limited the result will be an explosion in nonus subscriptions which were already starting to see evidence for in the most recent couple of quartersthis growth will in turn further accelerate the decline in traditional tv viability as cord cutting becomes pervasive expect continued upside surprises as this industry transformation continues all good news for nflx shareholders”
dis and nflxwho going to ultimate winnerbusiness perspective both will winner along with cbs and hbo hulu will majority own by disney soon and likely buy atleast time warner 10 comcast might not sell its 30 given fight between companystock perspectivenflx will big loser current growth is unsustainable and so it will take many years to justify such valuationdisney huge winner they likely worth 250b valuation in 3 year as it become clear that its wining market share with so much superhits kids content sports it sure going to take over market shareapple is disruptor and can take huge pile of money to take over market disney still winner because apple willing to pay high dollar for content still
hbo has almost as many total subscribers and it was acquired as part of a huge bundle of assets by att for 85b want to tell me again why neflix is worth 2x as much as the entire acquisition by att cause it aint

a big misconception is netflix got big because they never had serious competition hulu disney comcast along with amazon had to be serious competition for tiny netflix back when it only makes sense being the major media company it is today netflix competition has to be weaker than ever it will be confirmed when the stock rises to 1000 next year

using day trader joshs swing trading system the 32800 support on daily chart  low on 73118 its holding above here for 9 days one of joshs rules for an established swing level requires a 10 day hold abovebelow a supportresistance this means that going long here above 328 is very risky for swings especially when market is at alltime highs and due for sharp natural pullback investors dont worry just holdbut swing traders wait for 228 to break or come close below 330 before getting back in this beast now if nflx does not go back down then we will just wait for higher resistance swing levels and start our shorts again for quick 510 pullbacks again we do not guess direction we instead wait patiently on sidelines till price comes to us way less stress and we always get a damn good entry with this strategy but there is far more to day trader joshs strategy then what i just mapped out here but at least you get the framework essentially we are countertrend trading for quick 1 to 5 day profits off the reversals in price although in key situations like earnings we get far more then 10 points on nflx both longshort
even if the nasdaq is down if a company does well there is no reason to justify a 9 swing in price from its high yesterday to what it is today hell on a price to percentage loss basis neither fb or amzn came anywhere near to losing what this did and this company just beat earnings forecast by 30
i still do not understand netflix owns nothing its original contents are not that valuable it is just a streaming service soon most likely now the other company will start gang up on netflix once they will stop feeding contents to netflix it is the end of netflix
if its not a day to sell i dont knock what it is
any predictions as to what will be the opening next week i want to get in to but at right price
it will touch 340

netflix is the stock version of the crypto craze everybody is just buying netflix due to the name recognition and because they see it always going up and they have the fear of missing out on the seemingly never ending gains it worked for bitcoinuntil it didnt i wonder how long this will keep adding billions to the market cap every day with no fundamentals to back it up

nflx might sell off before earnings out of fear that their results may be less than stellar it was 077 just 16 years ago it was 8 june 2010 so about 8 years ago it is up a factor of 44 since june 2010 it seems like the competition has gotten their act together and nflx has grown their debt a huge amount which puts their earnings in question i mean do they really have an earnings 130 might be in its future growth 40 pe 283often you see a company with 40 growth and a pe of 80 28380  35353 35  100 per share
i told you shorts a few days ago nflx was forming a base for the next leg up
the only thing i am looking forward to with netflix is the stock split i heard about
maybe this is where msft begins to see an entry point for an acquisition of nflx while the stock is depressed and porter bibbs prediction becomes reality
52100 by end of day
don’t open a position in nflx until you hear what httprightpickercom has to say about it these guys give amazing insights like no other service
i think today i have been convinced that we are going back to 350 this is just a slow drip at this point all of us in above 400 will have the problem of people selling when they make a good profit this have us locked in for while i dont think i will hold through another er report again not worth the risk

netflix is trading high just because of buying back news otherwise they are losing ground big time they will face real competition from disney
it’s going green today after 10am start buying it’s going to start looking good
i like netflix as a service and investor but swing trading this thing i shorted it all the way up to 593 what people dont realize is it surged way too high and fast for the short term the potential buybacks are not for sure and wont be for a long while they are also in a catch 22 with covid since the subscribers have surged due to covid but they are also running much behind on new content also due to covid  catch 22 i have already watched everything i can possibly find on there and im cancelling after the second price increase for the service taking place only a few months apart until they have a ton of the new anticipated releases which all have no actual dates on them i think many will follow like myself and no way this price keep sup this high until it dips way lower though i do think it will come back up but maybe not until end of year
all these shorts bad mouthing nflx is hilarious all they say is how this will be down big tomorrow or go to 500 lol don’t forget people this was at 545 a week and a half ago without earnings this will hit all time high tomorrow no worries lmao
time to buy message board and market way too negative this stock is being unfairly lumped in with all of the other faangs  the growth story is intact if economy tanks consumers look for bargains in entertainment spending and nflx fits that category
going over 300 easy tomorrow
faang bubble 420 neflix or 500 netflix big holders have hollyday so the bubble is not a problem
breaking loop capital raises netflix price target to 650 from 600 loop capital analyst alan gould raised the firms price target on netflix to 650 from 600 and keeps a buy rating on the shares the company is becoming the master of its own domain with enough selffunded content available and in production so as not to be dependent on any specific titles produced by others the analyst tells investors in a research note gould adds that netflix has continued to grow subs and content sourcing despite the launches of disney hbo max and peacock as well as navigating more limited content available from three of the major media conglomerates

i shorted 300 again at 322 again 1200 short and my average is 308 for short plan to cover 300 at 317i decide to trade instead selling put because stock moving very fast and once i sell cover put cant do trading i also hold couple 320 calls with 1k premium i am hoping it expire out of money but may sell couple of put for those soon in order to limit my looses
no reason to be bullish on this stock netflix ceo even admitted again today that competition is hurting their subs the dynamics have changed soon every company will be streaming their content and those companies have far more original content than netflix since they’ve been producing for decades just the reality netflix is no longer unique in streaming they certainly ain’t unique in content basically they have no moat their business is under attack at every angle from competitors

you would have thought nflx has reported bad news since earnings or even no news well since earnings they have announced us price increase received many analysts upgrades have major independent surveys indicating high viewer ratings we are going into a seasonally high sub add period combined with covid surge yet stock is roughly 100 off its recent highs more shocking is that it is lower today with all the subsequent good news than it was after earnings selloff normally i would say but here but in this market who knows
big boys want this at 475 to 500 dont fight it

if it goes above 400 its time to short it againnetflix will soon see tougher competitions from apple disney and they wont survive this especially disney streaming service will take a huge bite from the companies viewer base
nflxappl amzn disney attif you own the others just sell them and buy more netflix now
growth stocks like nflx and fb cant continue to have huge earnings beats and exceed these monumental expectations set out by the street because eventually they hit a wall thats what were seeing nowdoesnt mean theyre terrible companies just means theyre human after all stuff doesnt go up forever even amzn will hit that wall sooner or later
forgot to mention cancelled my netflix today and millions more will follow
im long and nervousanyone else nervous
there is a definite seasonal trend  in 9 of the past 10 years netflix has closed higher over the upcoming 35 days with an average gain of 269
the streaming giant is expected to deliver earnings of 24 cents per share on revenue of 421 billion
netflix debt is way to high earnings will be a disaster
you guys have to understand that wall street controls the media sentiment and hype for companies theanalysts that set price targets work for wall street how many do you believe are actually telling the whole storyconcerning stocks it is no different than a politician commenting on a topic of public interest it is slanted towardtheir side wall street creates bubbles in stocks on purpose and for one reason to take your money
i bet amazon or apple is buying it
i have a feeling i’m gonna regret waiting for a correction
monday will be a better day 
netflix just raised prices in the us
the only thing netflix investors have to fear is fear itself
looking forward to the earning release tomorrow have a good feeling about this one
tell andrew not to spend that money he made on shorting nvda nflx and whatever else he failed to guess at one place
the eu ruling stating 30 percent of content must be local is a big road bump
streaming services are losing a lot of money licensing to netflix pays more than streaming we have seen a shift from cable tv to streaming and now we will see a shift from content producers streaming their own content to content producers licensing their content to netflix
hilarious netflix is basically blockbusterwith a 150 billion market cap debt is soaring content acquisition costs are soaring future content commitments are in the billions the company has negative 500 million in cash flow meanwhile the company only loses as little as it does because it pushes the cost of broadband onto all broadband customers not just netflix customers the big cable companies still have tons of cash and lots of very powerful political connections and they dont appreciate subsidizing their competitor the political risk to netflix is high if the cable company lobbyists ever succeed in allowing differential internet access pricing based on bandwidth usage netflix will be crushed meanwhile there are 4x more tv shows produced per year now than just 15 years ago so netflixs original content is less of a special selling point because there is a content glut out there meanwhile guess who is netflixs biggest competitor amazon lol betting on a company to beat amazon or even survive the onslaught from amazon would be risky enough at a cheap valuation but netflix trades at like 300 times ebitda i think netflix the company will survive but there is a very real chance of the equity getting wiped out to zero at some point in the next 5 years lol this valuation is absolutely hilarious even a run of the mill correction of 20 in the stock market will take overvalued netflix down by 50right now the stock is as high as it has ever been everyone has been excited about netfix for years but todays price shows people more optimistic than they have ever been on any other day buyer beware
hoping for more analyst target price cuts so this thing keeps going up
netflix should tank back to the 250300 range buying range it shouldn’t have climbed so high
there is no stopping this analysts are embarrassed because they keep having to make up an excuse to up their models big time this is up 68 or 57 billion in 2 months on no news other than a 19m subscriber beat this is pure euphoria no way to trade this except go long and hope it keeps going no telling how high this will get before earnings release next month their sub guidance was very low same as last quarter which they beat so any fool can figure they will beat again by the same amount does stock go up another 68 at some point the market cap is so high that it would imply they capture all entertainment dollars in the world guess that would be a trillion dollar cap we could hit that by 2020 at this rate
great year  nflx up 6711 
we going to turn green iam hoping tomorrow the earning in 4 days 
get in now will touch 525 tomorrow
bring the squeeze
going past 50000 pretty soon thank me now or cry later trust me i know and i really do its facts not some bs starting tomorrow  engaging as of next week gonna power burst it unto that level  hover and hold then up some more could care less if you believe me i hold mine and i have plenty
here is one analyst history of price targetgbh117 raise from 235 to 255215 raise to 31538 raise to 375 517 raised again to 400618 raised to 500first does yearly price target change so much 5 time in 5 monthso what common theme about this analyst price reach with in 1015 of previous target can you believe thisi guess we should start 20 firm with different price target on stock we love and hot in market and put computer who keep announce price target increase when last price target reach with in 10
who knew 233 to 357 in about 15 trading days wall street timing
market up again tomorrow now it is the decision time sell into the rally and reap gains or hold a little more but what if markets tank again i hate this decision time i guarantee if i sell it will keep going up and if i hold the market will tank happens everytime lol
im holding
can nflx refinance old debt with new low interest debt since the rates are so low if they can the interest expense will much less any thoughts
as netflix goes for mobil push it will open up markets that traditionally is not able to tap these markets are primarily in asia and africa where mobile use is the greatest pushing mobile also lowers cost of entry for must people in that region this market is huge and only netflix can tap into it due to its size
wow i have to say this is brutal just in the fact that if you didnt get in you felt bad when you see moves like this it gives you the opportunity to make a boatload of money now we know what side to play for earnings or shortly there after hang on this is going down as fast or faster than it went up i always say i dont know what i am looking for in a pattern or know which way a stock is heading but when it presents itself you will know this is one of those times
buying op they need to develop a live tv service like youtube tv of sling tv to package with their streaming service no brainer imo the growth potential is still there
netflix never misses two quarters in a row congrats longs
if you are a shareholder you can sell covered calls at any strike price for any time frame depending on your cash flow needs risk tolerance and time horizonif stock is taken so whatyou made 20 at close nflx jan 20 400 calls sold for 88 tax deferred cash per share this is a stres free way of investing
it’s up 2 after hrs
happy to say my netflix profit has reached 962 having bought the first tranche in july 2013 so in other words it took 5 years be a believer in this company and you will be rewarded good luck to all
if the same chart pattern as yesterday holds it will close near the low of the day which is 360
wake up netflix
netflix has corrected more in the past it will recover
here is cost of 4 person family with all subscription1 cable internet only 60month2 wireless  45line  180month3 netflix  16month4 amazon prime  10month5 music subscription 20month6 live tv channel  30month7 25line phone monthly installment 100 assume upgrade every 3 yeartotal 400450month just for internetentertainmentthis does not count any other game services subscripiton software subscription like office cloud game software cost on demand rental and so onoverall i think average is 500 per family of 4so while 2 increase is small it can cause low user look for alternative like amazon prime and hulu and cut netflix or start rotating service to save money
you do realize today was another alltime closing 21252 and intraday 21360 high got its steam back today after a one day break we need another similar sized move tomorrow to catch up
getting its mojo back that’s why you ride out the dips as they always come back strong
netflix is the only streaming service that is making a profit they have cornered the market
shorts lost their shirts

this is ridiculous price targets well past the 600s netflix stock should be going much higher virus or not
down because of downgrade from buy to neutral price target raise to 425 though
62 this yearabout 1 per day every day
i predict nflx will go down to 315 then it may turn around
russell 2000 rut and all us stock indexes are out of control the valuations are absurd the us stock market is in the tulip mania bubble the worthless us companies are trading at 100 billion market values the companies that generates 0 revenue have 5060 billion market values in the us who is buying these worthless shares to pump the stock bubblenflx tsla
this is being pumped with quick analyst upgrades today so the big money can have time to offload their positions dont be ignorant netflix is growing but their negative cash flow is growing at an even faster rate and is expected to continue into 2019thats a huge investment risk this could easily make netflix go bankrupt if their growth slows for whatever reason
netflix is the price leader only price leaders can raise prices they have raised prices 4 times over the past 4 years while competitors have been offering discounts and promotions to try and grow subscribers
this stock should not be allowed to trade in premarketbeing up a point in premarket takes the market cap up 431mnow go look at last years earnings 186mits up 23 times last years earnings in the premarketbut take advantage of it
i read most bullish article about netflix in seeking alpha who thinkin 2021  netflix will have 143m international paying customer 75m usa paying subscriber cost raise 20  and expect interest cost will go lower than current margin will double will trade at 48 peall combine he still value company at 408 in 2021 then he argue trade 300 based on 10 discount modelnow risk reward analysis of his way optimistic number still make this stock work 200 in my opinion sure if it continue grow even after dis entry and without disney content could worth 400 in 2021 but that 3 year out why pay so much premium now
not only is it nice to see nflx and amzn having good days but garbage stocks are continuing to tank nio and friends jumia etc a little bit of sanity is nice once in a while
reed hastings just sold another 22 million of netflix on 422 what a great country he is a multibillionaire and yet his company loses over 3 billion per year

550 calls look beautiful told you to buy them cheap this morning
subscribers ran when susan rice went on the board and the company annc a deal with the obamas

i bought netflix it went down 17 i bought apple it went down 8 i sold it went back up i bought comcast it went down 18 i sold it went up i bought att it went down 18 i bought facebook it went down 9 i sold it went up i never made a profit i’m going to reassess netflix see if i can salvage anything if not in the next few months then i will sell withdraw all my money and quit my failing streak this is a big blow it shows i know nothing
content providing is becoming me too nflx will be forced to switch to an ad revenue sharing model or suffer a slow painful decline
lots of folks still stuck in using old models to think about new companies tsla is a good example of why old models dont work amzn took years to turn profitable nflx is no exception cant use what worked for ge on the new economy plus ge is half dead in case you are not following the news
buy below 50000
new 52 week high ah then sell off during the week
nothing but a casino thats all the stock market is yesterdays gainswhoosh
you know what it means this company is not able to add expected number of subcribers it knows growth is slowing this is not amazons model amazon never raised prices
i havent looked at or listened to news for 4 days and my sanity is just coming back cant stand the noise
netflix is inflating subscriptions by selling free international subscribers to attract new customers
wow im speechless from red to green in seconds thank you for the updates board members
why do people think 699 disney means that nobody wants nflx they have different content no mature adult content on disney they aren’t mutually exclusive affordable to have both
wait until next quarter drop like a rock
why is this down no more upgrades 
the best advice i’ve learned to be profitable in the stock market is trade on what is and not what you think i was long this stock the last couple weeks but went short after hours making trades today i will be long or short depending on what the market tells me because what i think has no bearing on price direction personally i think it goes higher but if momentum is down i will profit by shorting
in a few years there will talks about netflix buying disney
will this push past 385 by 727
nflx will crush the shorts again next quarter it is an unstoppable freight train that will continue to grow at least for another 50 years cash flows and debt are irrelevant they can borrow unlimited amounts of money at very low interest ratesi predict 300 by april 1000 by next year abs probably 10000 in a couple of years
can debtflix ever be profitable
im not worried too much about disney it reminds me when google was trying to compete with facebook they finally gave up and closed the service for lack of popularity if netflix will give a good fight people wont have a reason to switch over
nflx earnings date july 16 three weeks away
here is consumer reports provide high level review on serviceslook at netflix they call it best but when you read disney and marvel deal list out as major reason what will happen when disney content disappear and marvel deal get expensive on renewal daredevil remain most popular drama ever on netflixhttpswwwconsumerreportsorgstreamingmediadevicesguidetosubscriptionstreamingvideoservices
my calls just got in the money
to those who say disney is an equivalent alternative to netflix and people will drop netflix for disney yes nothing beats a romantic evening for couples to choose between mickey mouse and star wars while the guy explains how he could only afford one streaming service

apple not buyingi know there has been speculation they might
folks nflx soared a factor of 400 over the last 1718 years largely on hype and speculation and favoritism the bubble has sprung a leak competition is stiffening as the barriers to entry to broadcasting streaming and mailing videos are very low nflx does produce original content but so do many others this is a very crowded playing field and getting moreso
fundamentals and technicals lining up first target 700 early next year and then 1000 by year end after disrupting film and tv industry they won’t wallow in their glory they will finish the job and take over perfect rounding bottom on the 6 month chart
of the 12 most popular tv series released in 2017 and 2018 netflix has 9 hbo has 1 hulu has 1 and fx has 1 that pretty well says it all

serious question anyone think this could sink to 230240 by next week or is 250 its baseline

then next quarter netflix will announce that they lost 8 of the 85 million subscribers which they added this quarter and the stock will take a 20 nose dive im so sick of this stock going up  down like a yoyo thats why i took it out of all of my clients portfolios
consumer confidence remains very strong 
ozark is coming
who in the hell is still chasing that nflx netflix tulip mania bubble
netlifx bought a huge positive review campaign into imdbbut the witcher isnt a new got actually a far from it
surprised it’s up so much given the revenue and eps i guess subscriber numbers are good enough to offset congrats to those who had the nerve to hold through earnings given the last couple of quarters it was risky
if it goes up today it would be an ascending triangle breakout time to cover short and go long
shorts are active again love that sooo much means they get scared and know what is going to happen buy back with a big loss
 guys what happened after nflx reach 400
seeing how disney has run since it announced streaming focus what do you guys think about att for a trade as it switches over to streaming with times warner i know att is kind of a dinosaur but i could see it moving up maybe 1525 on hype related to this news
will netflix hit a new 52 week high today
netflix since inception gave a great product with exceptional value to its customers they have not strayed from that mission and that mission worked very well for them in the form of customer loyalty to the brand consumer knows that there are not that many companies out there that are customer centric to name a few like costco netflix could have made a boatload more of money but instead focus on delivering quality product at reasonable cost
i think netflix will be fine for a long timedisney is available now for a year in the netherlands and a movie site made a round up of that year seems like disney produced more originals than i tought tought they only released hamilton mandalorian and mulan but of course its only a fraction of what netflix produced they also asked is disney worth the money there where 18 reactions two people said its great or pretty good everybody else allready canceled or will not renew but eventualy take a month now and then article is in dutch google translate might help httpswwwfilmtotaalnlnieuws76532

nothing would surprise me with this stock if you told me it would be 350 by end of the week i would believe you once it has gone into the stratosphere anything is possible you are no longer tethered to metrics like pe peg ratio multiple of book value discounted cash flow etc etc its just whatever the next guy will pay and its a selfreinforcing process that can spin up for quite a while of course eventually something happens to stop the rocket but that can take a while and could be at least 700 before anything like that happens enjoy the ride i expect at least 10 every day from this
oh baby its showtime
how are we looking for er
i love nflx but cancelling daredevil and the punisher was a big mistake seriously those shows were amazing and just getting into their prime there was so much left to tell in the stories and so many dedicated fans netflix needs to sit down with marvel and renegotiate a deal to bring back daredevil and the punisher

this is the most meaningless drop ever
this is obviously an informal poll but about a third of my friends have canceled nexflix since susan rice and the obamas were affiliated
disney  apple and amazon big competitors for netflix this year
i shorted 100 shares at 466 did i make mistake
662 i sell half then rid the rest
ill take 600 for the day in a heartbeat
nflx needs to produce something like got amzn is making lotr quality is more important than quantity
1000 by year end
if i already have nflx and only want to keep a portfolio of 15 stocks is it worth adding roku
its so great to be invested in a stock that market makers and fund managers want to see over 400 regardless on whats going on in the world or all wall street congrats to the rest of you longs that got in over the last 3 months sometimes making money in stocks is really this easy and remember shorts never bet against momentum or the desire of what fund managers want the outcome to be for a stock 400 next month my friends

im not worried about netflix until disney get their streaming act together until then it is a traders stock
looks like well see 400 in the after hours
so the price increase sounds like a response to an earnings miss
very positive price action for longs
i wonder if this really good company value is to close to dis in value without much assets should be at 99 compared to 300 plus
nflx will open higher regardless of where it trades tonight
a stock that missed top and bottom is buy or selllll
i dont know how people can be so confidant that nflx will give better guidance going forward clearly there has been fomo buying and the price has skyrocketed then a price increase announcement 2 days before earnings report this screams short if you ask me
this stock has that big d
it pays to be patient go netflix

below 500 by friday
this feels like a big reversal coming i’m betting airlines and cruise ships selloff during the day and money returns to tech i just bought some nvidia when trash companies are leading a rally i’d be careful
what happens when netflix has to actually reduce spending on original content in order to stem billions in losses every year will the content get better at that point i doubt it
it only takes a few days like today for it to get back to 400 
guys im new to trading and looking for advice up on enthusiasm i just bought some shares at 132 should i keep them till tomorrow or sell them in advance in case at which price what do you think thanks

do any of you longs actually believe this trading nasdq hitting all time highs and nflx trading 25 below its high zero volume and zero buying even on up days stock in a clear downtrend competition coming hot and heavy with deep pockets and oodles of contentand somehow this stock hovers with no buying just above an air pocket downthey are slowly distributing this stock and trading weekly to weekly options to augment the return your only friend is the time still left until the air goes out and they are gone and so are the option boys
buy buy buy only 10 minutes left to enjoy the sky ride on monday
always has a big spike after the holidays in membership growth due to gifcards from the holidays most get enough to get a 90 day or 6 month membership and then many of those don’t renew when the gift card expires big bubble here
man i cant believe i bought at 373
385 easily today
the only hypothetical you should be wrestling with right now is “is nflx” worth 300 a share”
nothing to watch worth a  on netflix everyone is getting into the streaming business this stock will be in the 200 in 3 years
wow 320 in aftermarket i think if the momentum continues over next 34 trading days we all can buy nflx around 280 and then count our money as it steadily moves to 400 over next 68 months im salivating 
whats is going on is this a fb affect
our research team shows inverted bell shape triple knuckle cavernous double tip hyper loop rectangle triple bump pattern with super double dips quadruple padded isosceles triangle and single hump for nflx with predicted range between 336  367 wow i became a wall street chart analyst

at one point today this was 15 why did it drop
i applaud those who bought calls andor stock ahead of earnings i played it somewhat safe and deployed a 525540 call spread so my upside is capped at 540 still it was minimal risk for what will be a nice return tomorrow
wow look at it go
what percentage of people on here making negative comments also subscribe to netflix
if nflx increases rates by 1 penny there will be cancellations i for one will cancel as soon my free month ends horrible movie selection way too many low budget international and super hero movies not many good shows

this might be the greatest come back ever
i am beginning to wonder if netflix is paying too much to get “original contents” aol comes to mind i was paying through the nose when it first offered “you got mail” and now i get too much mail and for free any thoughts on its future prospects

chances are netflix added 12 million new subscribers last quarter which is 26 million more than they forecast
the ultra high growth phase is now in the past for netflix interest in newcontent is lackluster so going forward competitors in china and elsewhere will be taking marketshare and subscriber base will flaten out or possibly drop slightly after hastings decides to hike prices again to pay for content 313 is fair value for nflx share pricehttpsfinanceyahoocomvideonetflixsharestumblesubscriberhiccup100900415html
every since we sold our longs on nflx when first broke 405 on 619 we logged a very nice run of 60 points from 345405 and plenty more in past 3 years since 619 we have logged well over 50 points on shorts after each runup and pullback some 5 points and some like today we got 15 points intraday so after earnings we expect nflx to initially dump below the 378 support probably 350365 range we will then go long again ride it back up 5070 points to alltime highs this is swing trading folks way more profits in longrun and we dont risky losing equity on huge pullbacks we actually capitalize on shorts when investors are running for the hills if you wanna truly learn our system you know where to go
its always nflx drops after the earnings so i guess ill buy just after the earnings
netflix has reached escape velocity 1 billion subscribers is in the cards
netflixs earnings per share eps growth is expected to accelerate to over 63 annually during the next half decade driven by marginexpanding original content soaring international growth and the potential for future price increases for its part facebooks eps growth is expected to slow to just 26 per year as advertising saturation of its flagship facebook platform gives way to slower ad growth on its instagram whatsapp and messenger services

jefferies boosts netflix target to 610 with bull case of 700
what you guys think will be the price after today’s earnings
nflx cant seem to stay above 290 it looks like that is where they are going to suppress it
incase anyone is uncertain yes the selling is way overdone from both a technical and fundamental level technically the mfi is below 20 way oversold on the fundamentals keep in mind that q2 earnings margins and revenue were all inline with forecast despite the fact that the subscriber forecast was missed by a million that is a staggering achievement totally overlooked by the media i expect q3 to be a blowout so the next couplle months will likely be very choppy and should be viewed as a chance to add to positions rather than waiting for a sell point the largest number of shares this year were purchased between 320  330 so look for resistance at or slightly above that level
lol  netflix when your biggest competitor is amazoncom should your stock trade at 300 times earnings nope you should have a bankruptcy lawyer on speed dial its hilarious that netflix trades like a worldbeating monopoly when in fact they compete against the deadliest and richest competitors on the planet google facebook apple amazon will netflix survive sure quite possibly but should netflix trade at the most expensive valuation of any company in the market lol just ask excite myspace nokia and barnes and noble competing against any one of google facebook apple or amazon tends not to be fun or fruitful competing against all of them at once is really not fun i wonder if netflix could possibly revisit its 2017 levels in 2017 the stock traded in the 100s all year now just 15 weeks later its trading in the 300s is this a permanent change to revisit the levels of just a few months ago nflx stock price would get cut in half gulp
soon down to 2000
runs up into the close we finish at 21245 tomorrow sells off a little but ends up 125 21360 wednesday up 240 216 thursday up 280 21880 then friday runs to finish at 220 theres the week very simple next week up another 10 big move will come on wednesday 123 im expecting a 20 move up to 250 all on subscriber growth thats the only things that powers this not eps usually comes in a few cents over or under not cash flow always big negative just subscribers relative to estimate which is always sandbagged low cant believe if analysts actually wanted to hit it they would just add 23 million to whatever the consensus guess is they will easily beat this quarter
so if they give away a billion free subscriptions and show 1000 “subscription growth” lol at the expense of zero margin and losses then the stock will shoot up 100x fold in one day correct is this what people are chasing they missed eps by a mile because of that just gave free or cheap subs yet showed a “subscriber beat” so called and now added 20 billion to their market cap based on that makes total sense in this incredible market bubble of coursekeep on buying

after more than a decade i just canceled my subscription to netflix rising its price while others a lot cheaper than netflix
who buys this stock at this price and waits till 2020 for a bounce netflix needs to go down to 220 than you can look at it
ok  im giving everyone a fair warning im about to buy nflx for the first time ever usually when i buy a stock it goes down immediately youve been warned 
analysts continue to raise price targets and this stock continues to fall go figure
there is nothing wrong and everything right with nflx except the price it should be a great 20 billion dollar company capable of reaching 50 billion in 3 to 5 years instead it is price the same as disneyreally disney pleaes do not be the dope holding this as hedge funds run
what you get for the price you pay for a netflix subscription keeps hitting new all time industry highs after factoring inflation 1 billion around the world pay for a tv service and eventually will have a netflix subscription expect good news on subscriptions for many years to come
it will tell us a lot with how the market closes today if we get a little bump up that is a good sign but a bump down what i expect will be a pretty bad sign
disney will rule and be a 1t market cap in a few nflx has some good competition in disneytoo big imo
230 after earning is reasonable
how many of you here believe that nflx will go right back to 400 as if the miss means nothinghow many of you believe nflx will go back down to below 360
remember 2016 after hitting a high of 130 the previous year the stock couldn’t get out of its own way at 90 the same thing is happening 3 years later but the stock is 3 fold higher the market will do its best to separate you from your shares don’t let it do it
small reason big stocks are down a little bit today is because two new ipos are coming out doordash tomorrow and airbnb on thursday but a nice run up to 521 is not to be overlooked this thing is going to fly once news of netflix releasing gaming live tv broadway musicals and other huge news hits the mainstream today i am taking the day off

goldman sachs argument to justify higher price makes no sense netflix will be paying more due to higher interest rates they will be spending more as they add more debt to create their own content and as they pay more for licensing others content and they will be losing disney content i dont see how this is a good proposition for higher valuation let alone justify yesterdays
this is just the start of massive losses to come
it will finish above 370 today 380 by wednesday

for some wall street firms netflix still a buy after earnings misshttpsfinanceyahoocomvideowallstreetfirmsnetflixstill102200013html
so what’s the word on today’s actioni think it will be a replay of yesterday dropping to 560 and then closing around low 570swould love to see it bottom out at 530s early so i could cash in on my puts and call it a day
nflx great company we will be seeing 360 soon
i am short and bear of netflix but appreciate all the bulls for their courage to hold it through earnings  good luck
honestly what’s so great about netflix most of there content you can find online for free or on demand and they haven’t really had many new reuses of late i only keep it due to stranger things and 2 other titles
anyone need netflix to plummet i sure do
overall netflix is a good stockcompany it just got to far ahead of itself just needs time for a lower base to be established pe needs to become something more reasonable too 240 is way to high
nflx has the international growth  specially in india and none of the pretenders can match
about time to see some green after 4 long days of nothing but red this really needs to finish over 362 today
nflx will see 350 before 400
long
the nflx shares are like a spring the more you push it down the more it will pop i am 100 bullish about this security good for all investors who loaded this in discount
market participants are simply in the mood to buy the results don’t matter much never it’s all about “future growth” which is just market mood and feelingslook at aapl doubling in price despite declining earnings and revs the only thing that matters is whether traders think someone else will buy it for higher for nflx that’s a big yes he who panic buys first panic buys best
the numbers look good
green premarket that’s what i like
and will also be green tomorrow
still a long way to fall best to take profits if you have them this stock more than doubled over a year and things like that just dont last disney will be big competition and theyll start pulling their programming for their own streaming service

discovery is now going to streaming because they realize it’s the future discovery is a niche service which is going to charge 499 plus have ads one thing nflx has figured out is people hate ads when i see all the things nflx does right it’s no surprise they are the dominant player here these companies moving to streaming are so far behind and imo making big mistakes like bombarding people with ads
nflx is grossly hammered by media and overall market unfairly mistreated like no tomorrow given its huge subscription growth rate in international market and potential service pricing rise its free cash flow and eps will be in accelerating track in 2019

i just bought into nflx before earning report should have sold at 380 cause it kept going down and down sold with a few profit gain couldnt hold on any longer this way i can jump back in if it goes down further without a wash sale but im so close to retiring that i prob need something more conservative anyway…

i don’t blame those of you who sold when it went above 510 and i think tomorrow is shaping up like another market selloff but that said the election is likely over tuesday night a contested election could create some overhang but that appears unlikely to happen the other uncertainty is covid well a second wave hardly hurts nflx in fact it likely helps so that’s why i didn’t sell some today i think this stock will be in the 600 before the end of the year i will take some profits before then but not selling at 510 right now
with all their debt and now rising interest rates and completion you have to wonder why they are screaming for help by raising fees this is a big gamble on their part if you ask me since they had a bad experience in the past by doing the exact same thing only this one on a much larger scale

in my opinion as a consumer netflix is significantly better than its rivals they have the best offering of movies original content and platform netflix also has the largest customer base it is a question of valuation this stock will rise again once the short sellers have run out of opportunity and exit all of their positions the longterm strengths are too positive here i have 300 shares and i am down 20 right now but there is an ancient chinese proverb that applies here the ox moves slow but the earth is patient

nflx was trading around 278 yesterday then it ran to 285 due to news that altice intergrades it to it top box setthe stop losses will kick in til 2715 where i will cover my shares imo
and here we go
200 dollars at most
chances are 75 that nflx has blow out numbers
should i sell for 500 dollar on friday or wait for it to become 600 next month
why netflix is going down they reported very good earning report does not have any impact of trade war still down can’t believe this any bad news that i am not aware of
looking good so far
it’s looking to make 37000 today today she will rise
450 after earnings call
i wish i have gut to short more but i dont and against my principle as well i think i am exiting too fast twice now last time i exit fast and sell off bring this down to 240 it was sad as i exit with lot of loss this time i am again exiting very fast but this time making solid profit atleastmoving average trend line seems broken or all most broken and that only going to bring technical sell off nowstart of month and end of month complete contrasting at start of month it was back by solid technical buy and now complete opposite
wow good thing i only own 10 shares
best 3 day total since july 56  9 2845last 3 days 2766 this run started when it reached 31081 on mondaycan we make it 4 days in rowlast 4day winning steak was july 1114 on the way to 42321 on july 21
400 by end of the day
vaccine is out and now the valuations mean something
the chart looks good it it breaks 370 then its going straight to 380
raising prices and then beating subscriber expectations is the catalyst needed and it’s looking good from imdb top 50 movie and top 50 tv series lists 13 new netflix original titles avg user rating 58 released in october vs 8 new original titles avg user rating 54 released in october from all the other streaming services combined
cfra standard and poors give nflx a high risk ratingour risk assessment reflects intensifying competitionamong established and new entrants in the subscriptionsvideo on demand svod landscape potential threatsfrom directtoconsumer offerings by the major contentproviders corporate governance concerns related to aclassified board of directors and some regulatoryuncertainties related to the fccs recent overturn of netneutrality regulations
nflx needs to start increasesub fee and split the stock
just waiting i know it will rise
today netflix had the lowest volume of the past 10 trading sessions what does that mean
nflx moves into the sp 100im new to this stock is this known prior to today
5 more percent today 
now when you buy a tv the remote has a netflix button game over netflix wins
buyers are back
1000 in three months or solong base of nflx price consolidation means huge upside
21904200 shares were shorted gonna take a week before they can all buy back lol
market will pop tomorrow on good earnings led by google
we tested the 36275 level and got a little bounce next will be 36120 support this will be a major hurdle if support fails then 35801 is the next level to test then 35261 all bets are off if it falls below 34440
where is the 500 to 1000 soon crowdmaybe 200 to 100 soonnice
is netflix business model recession proof in your opinion when things are not as good consumers retreat to there televisions and movie and series content to save cost of other activities that are much more expensive opinions are welcome thanks
my theory on this stock being a total pos will be vindicated
keep the faith longs the bar to entry for overthetop streaming is very high dis and t are trying to compete late 2019 but will take time to get any momentum going t has not been able to monetize the assets they already have dis will initially be a niche player for a certain demographic unless they start to produce their own content youtube premium maybe showing signs of trouble placing ads on original contentnflx is already anticipating the competition in 2019 and is already ahead of the game they are arguably the best platform for the widest range of multiscreen devices gla
hopefully we can hold 500 and run higher
pre market just moving wow great for people like me under 332
unfortunately it did not move as i expected specially with great results and guidance and backlog of programs nflx will be future studios streaming king and content leader  this will be way above 600 in year due to potential  1 down days versus highest  wise growth in pricing this year  tomorrow this will be back to 450  i just loaded some more at 420
going bullish due to international expansion which netflix virtually has no meaningful competition

you know whos not buying management
getting bought by apple
nflx share price showed some strength with higher volume on tuesday vs other tech stocks and had some reasonable follow through yesterday if disney results on subscriber numbers dissapoint then it maybe its time for nflx to take another leg up there is a huge gap on dis chart going into earnings tonight  if theres any dissapointment these gaps quickly get filled either way my guess is what is good for one will be bad for the other and visa versa glta  im currently long nflx here 
dropping fast oh wait no it isn’t lol sorry shorts
the stock trades independent of facts and reality another upgrade today and we are down where as roku is up another 4 on similar upgrade and trading past 52 week high major disconnect

believe it or not nflx is the next internetrelated 1000 stock after amzn googl bkng
nflx will be above 280 tomorrow  buy now  very successful line up of content and then all carriers are offering netflix  no one is going to develop content other than big boys like netflix  every one is going to pay them for content  disney has long way to go  this qtr will be huge specially global 
i told everyone to forget about amzn fb and the rest of the faangs and buy nflx just look at this thing its like the emerald city over here
netflix has a good business model however profitability is highly elusive and competition is heating up the closest analogy i recall is when netscape was the dominant web browser until microsoft came out and offered ie free things didnt end overnight for netscape but in time ie won the war same thing is happening with competition from att and disney netflix could be bought out but only at a much lower price think about it
disney’s strategy only cements and validates netflix dominance and sound business strategy disney only shouted to the world that netflix is doing exactly what it should have been doing the past 5 years
sold at 310 for an 80 profit going to buy dis soon
is nflx being pumped by analysts so their big clients can get out at a decent priceit doesn’t make any sense to upgrade a stock facing negative cash flow  huge debt  rising interest rates  rising competition from other content owners launching their own streaming service
why up ah
375 tomorrow
longs thing netflix is next to reach 1t
and it don’t stopand it won’t stop
this market is setting up for a selloff if we don’t have a clear result tonight i think we will but even if we don’t i’m not selling here my stocks nflx appl amzn all are still down from recent selloffs i think any selloff will effect these names less
nflx momentum1 er2 fangs stock in uptrend now
do u think we will beat
thanks tim cook gonna buy big tomorrow on nflx
buying time nflx is way ahead of others in streaming study the little known company called akam competition will go through buffering hourglasses and server crashes before they stream well nflx will gain in original content in the meantime
if you think this gem is going down like i do don’t buy puts expiring soon it’s a option trap buy the puts for long term a flurry of downgrades will happen if they miss
i think its safe to say that this has been totally oversold  market got ahead of itself on the miracle vaccine news
wow beat by 2 million subscribers to 700 by end of week
at this rate nflx will buy mickey
apple not buying netflix  can this be interpreted that there is no limit on the up side in the longer term
i have options 350 strike january 2020  should i sell or hold off until it strikes i think 350 and over coming soon  ill just keep it for a little while longer yaaaa nflx
always the eps misses
the story behind nflx was the growth now with such big competition from all around awards taken by competitors i wont be surprised to see below 200 in the near term
this is like watching a volcano to irrupt it keeps going down and it’s getting ready to explode
wm is a joker take him easy
this ones gonna keep going up like tesla still not too late to buy some
nflx will be 200 next yearthe poor cant afford it anymore
at this pace we will reach 400 today mark these words
all analyst are increasing price target by 1020 what a coordinated effort by analyst to pump
see told you only more buy will back up soon
the story remains the same the majority still have 100mon pay tv and are shifting over in accelerating numbers along with their billions freed up from pay tv to better value streaming services where netflix is the leader hold on tight don’t let them separate you from your shares
430 after er thats all you need to know
huge money was buying in right at the bell look at it climb already
im just sayinneedham sees roku as better buy following netflix earnings maintains underperform rating to netflix cites overvaluation in comparison to streaming peers
httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsnetflixq4earnings2020171259535htmltsrcfinnotif
gaining momentum 425 by friday afternoon
still a bargain
fake accounts are being added to nflx to pump its stock price as its earnings are tanking
think of google trying to topple facebook orkut vs facebook bing vs google just because a strong competitor is stepping into the streaming space doesn’t mean bad news for the top players netflix will keep growing and eventually get far too high than any other streaming service
tomorrow barring any poor market conditions i think this tests 376 if it finds support there next stop is 390 and probably in a hurry if i am right or wrong i still love how she moves
goog nflx wimi seems to have found some decent support adding shares today
shorts better coverthis thing is about to fly
volume already at 5 million lots of upward pressure and buys
place your betspop or drop after close
any single ladies with 1000 shares need a guy with lots of love to give looks not important
i dont see whats so great about this anymorethey have some good original content but thats itthey are gonna eventually loss most other good content and they dont do anything special everyone knows how to stream content i never had a problem with disney maybe its worth 100
leaked 6 millions subs
310 tomorrow 
it will never get back to 33300says the nut who never bought
350 seems to be coming today
just short 50 shares of nflx 
censor and chief  who said that
i think apple parked all that cash  buy netflix 
ibased on today and yesterday price action i can easily can see a 20 shave after q2
every time we clear 370 massive selling comes in have to take out the seller and close over 375 i wouldn’t be surprise if we make another run today andor tomorrow
how is a single tv channel with 15 of the revenue and 120 of the profit be worth 90 of disney is al this hype really about content that is absurd and while netflix is a fine company it is way overvalued if it is all about content then disney should be 5x the market cap of netflix disney has a tv channel plus they produce blockbuster films they own marvel star wars lucas films pixar abc and espn additional channels that produce their own content plus disney has real assets  namely two theme parks that throw off billions in profits annually and the real estate itself is valued at 34 billion but business is not all about content that is just moronic hype business is about making money period disney has multiple streams of income and much of it is all integrated make a princess movie that makes 100300 million in profit sell gobs of profitable toys and costumes of said princess along with other profitable royalties then charge families 400 so their daughter can dress up like the princess and eat chicken tenders with her in a castle in orlando netflix has none of those highly profitable additional income streams any media company could easily start competing with netflix just by streaming their content netflix doesnt own the pipe to its customers like comcast who sells content and highspeed internet over the same cable two income streams amazon does what netflix does but its service costs less and you get free 2day shipping on just about anything you order netflix is absolutely overvalued and i think will trade below 100 within 23 years it may have peaked recently and the options market definitely is bearish on this stock cbo market is not always right in the shortterm but often has a pretty good read on the overall prospects for a companies future stock price
1000 target in 3 months
the hits just keep on coming netflix dropped a first teaser for its blockbuster the irishman during a commercial for the oscars epichttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgfr44g1kjmc
netflix will be worth buying when they start offering more movies and content i want to see rather than just their own stuffits not all bad but come on
maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but this market all fomo now and about to implode
how high do you guys really think this name can go
  maybe its just me but it seemed there were a large number of 480 puts and 485 calls closing today so managing the price to close at 482 84 on low volume makes it seem that this stock is completly controlled at the moment  then again maybe thats just my perception after a beerbon weekend to all 
is netflix partnering or purchasing gnus today
may get lower than what we thought at the closing is a real friday 13th
100 dollars for nflx is too much 
at 33161 the 200 day average is critical for tomorrow if it breaks it and closes above it we will see 350 before earnings
next quarter earning outlook 297looks impressive
next stop 550jus sayin
if raising subscription prices was such an easy panacea all companies would have done so this is a competitive market and theres no telling what the effect will be i consider it a negative as they cited rising costs which means margins are being squeezed dont short because of the insane volatility in this stock but if you are long id consider selling some especially after this huge runup on no news which smells like a short squeeze
below 500 by years end
hold or sell 
got a trial month with amazon prime nflx is much better after little dips along the way due to short sighted analysts this thing should keep going and going i think right now were seeing weak hands scrambling for the door
i said so friday nflx may hit 300 today

citi reiterated its buy rating on roku and raised its price target from 220 to 375 per share analyst jason bazinet believes that the companys discovery streaming distribution agreement and likely deal with hbo max creates room for further upside in addition bazinet sees further upside potential in rokus international expansion effortsso i guess nflx is out of favor
tminus 3 hours to the moon
it’s actually right now in a 51 split mode that can happen if nflx cares about there shareholders
why in the hell they have just pumped nflx bubble by 10 per share in 7 secondshow the hell is that possible
next stop is 425 on the road to 500
when it hit 30625 it set a record for the biggest high point ever in a day if it closes over 30547 it will be the best day ever
nflx falls after each terrible er and guidance report but the government still continues to pump the stock price between quarters for no reason nflx is losing subscribers and the revenue growth turns to negative but the absurd valuation is not coming down

netflix rules jump on folks
after a few months of watching netflix is there anything good to watch its like and entertainment dumpster or a  buffet with nothing good to eat
this is not the point where you should be shorting this one it has a long history of trading like this for a few days and then wham it goes back into high gear i had been watching this stock since its inception wish i had bought it back then it used to be 50 ten years ago prior to many splits even three years ago it was pretty low and one time i bought it and it just kept going down when it went down from 330 to 305 i got out it was before 13 split in 2013 and here we go
how can anyone hold or bye this stock now
the vaccine is the light at the end of the tunnel for most companies but an oncoming train for nflx i don’t know where the stock price will go in the next couple months but longer term it is headed down nflx buyersholders just naively celebrating with the rest of marketfor now
mitch lowe offered blockbuster video a 50 stake in nflx for 50mil blockbuster was afraid to innovate then just like amc is now clearly blockbuster messed up because netflix is worth over 150 billion today blockbuster went bankrupt moviepass will not be going bankrupt 
terribly low volume
rip shorts
the gary cohen thing we knew would happen and as far as nexflix is concerned either someone is buying it or the next quarter they are going to blow out subscriber growth
dont worry its headed for 250 just after the split
perfect 2000 decrease makes sense 
netflix will break 400 by friday
looks like conservatives boycotts of netflix because of the obama original content is working not good to mix politics with business we saw that with starbucks
lot of people buying up on post earning movement remember history dont repeat and do repeat dont repeat on such gain quarter after quarter specially for such large cap history do repeat on scale limitation every subscriber netflix add mean it reduce pool who possibly subscribe pool is getting smaller and smaller  some point leaving start outpacing new subscriber  so growth slowed or even get negative in no time
fact in the long run netflix will just be another channel in the new internet ondemand tv market 30b market cap max
looks like it held up strong
ive been saying it for months this had to happen 800 is next stop

does anyone not find it suspicious that a vaccine release immediately follows days after dems steal the presidency or do we all just not care
3 to 1 split
this cant be real
it’s hard to be positive right now about this stock hopefully we see a rotation into names like nflx and amzn next the market ran big across the board and is at all time highs yet nflx needs to go up about 20 to reach it’s all time highs ideally right now you’d be taking profits after the big market run not only has nflx declined almost 100 in a couple of months it’s done it during a time of a very strong market most of us have cost basis much lower than 575 obviously but you’ve not only been in the red the last couple months here but you’ve incurred a steep opportunity cost my reason i continue to hold is because the company is doing as well as ever and so many bullish signs with analysts price increases and subs the disconnect between stock and company has fooled me hopefully the road ahead is brighter than today
simple economics for nflx the most expensive item sold 17month does not justify the stock price of 356 aapl most expensive item sold is in the thousands
umm okay so somebody please explain the logic herenflx has a pe over 100 which is in of itself is ridiculous but with more and more competition theres no way this company can sustain such multiples and such nosebleed valutions i get that its a high beta stock and will make massive swings in either direction but it seems like all this is is a momentum play right now sure overseas has some growth but not enough to warrant this price and this valuation i want to short it around here but man who the heck knows one little earnings hiccup and this thing tanks hard hmmmm maybe an options trade is better
370 coming
way to easy to short here  thanks keep loading up i will wait for the crash
im buying today the overall market is down big and nflx is up to up but now while you can  but but buy
do you people realize that in the 19 trillion stimulus package 400 500 billion dollars of it goes to bail out the democrat run cities with all of their rioting and illegal immigrant safe havens and misuse of funds  see what you have elected the recession will be coming and soon

when old media come out with a steaming service they say wont compete with netflix or a service that reduces the time of a tv show or movie to 10 minutes or a service that pays you to stream video you know the streaming wars are over and netflix has won
350 next friday according to outperforming earnings
make no mistake netflix is the king of video distribution it is going direct to the talent to produce tv shows and movies game over competition is a no show and netflix wins by default
in 2015 shares were 700 before the 7 to 1 split i noticed news media is not meeting this so technically the stock is higher than amazon around well over 2800 a share since 2015 im still skeptical as to why everyone is downing the stock is there a catch

what will happen if apple bids on netflix
it is perfectly fine for nflx to sign obama up it will not be perfectly fine if nflx becomes a propaganda machine for the progressive movement this is what abc nbc cbs and all of their affiliates have become what a disaster that has become for them and you have no idea how many people are turned off by and never watch those channels another example is the hollywood elites oscar ratings were historically low by a wide margin because many simply refuse to listen to the political garbage that is spewed as well as the ridicule they are subject to because they dont share the views of liberal elitesmark my words if nflx gets into bed with one side of the political spectrum they will lose massive numbers of customers reed hastings made it known how much he hates trump as he threatened to resign from fb board because peter thiel was on the fb board and thiel supported trump so while signing obama is fine its a free country where diversity of opinion is supposed to be welcomed  unless you are not a progressive of course if nflx starts this march towards becoming a liberal propaganda machine it is going to get cut down to size
look out below here it goes tanking 
the stock has been ahead of the analysts with a 8 return this year citi and others who late last week said free cash flow will not be black in 2021 and a bad disney comparison i guess up after a beat tuesday since there have been 3 misses 5 11 19 last three quarters
400 in no time buy buy
220 calls expiring bust through that and it will climb
if we open between 369 and 370 look for the high to be at least 372 if it goes above that its a bonus

former long sold today they’ll be coming after those 300 calls tomorrow too many 310s  300s vs puts beware
im a lt investor in nflx in at 88share if you only invest in the stock and not actually consume the service you are truly not seeing the potential of the impact nflx has im a moderate so this news about susan rice and signing on the obamas to produce some shows has no decision on my investment if people can look past that they can see the value of this platform i just finished watching trump the american dream and i can say it was fascinating to see how he achieved winning the presidency and i had no idea how much of it was influenced by pat buchanan and jesse ventura in short you dont like whats streaming you can scroll right through the listing but if you open your mind to varying viewpoints i like that nflx offers me choices
everyone think netflix susbcription will raise as they make more netflix orignal and so their lead increasesimple questionhow many total episode on netflix orignal drama they produced in last 5 years answer will surprise you its only 400 there are b grade movies and commedy shows and marvel orignal exclusive likely pulled out in 2019 l which i am not countingin other word if i start watnow how many shows disney already have probably 4000 how much content disneyfox will generate 15b orignaldisney also have 1000s movies so if you have to choose between disney or netflix service which one will you go with i think answer is very obviousnetflix will continue license external content but that also mean it limit its own and number above may not improve much2019 coming fast and smart likely going to run before that all this analyst pumping may be way to exit without stock price crash

google trend data suggest outlander season 1 and 2 has a bigger viewing audience on nflx than any season ever had on starz does this draw netflix subscribers to subscribe to starz for season 34 if so probably not for more than a month before they cancel but sure shows the importance of scale lgf is more valuable apart of another network than on its own its so obvious

what is wrong with this thing netflix has been so lifeless for the last few weeks ￼￼
beginning multiple sell days
this laura martin certainly has a bias against netflix i would not be surprised if she has friends shorting the stockshe puts a buy on roku yet a hold on netflix really roku is not even yet profitable has far fewer users than netflix and apple tv and other cable companies will give away free streaming devices yet you rate roku with a buy and 150 price target i wouldnt trust a thing she says about netflix losing subscribersnetflix will be at least near 290 before earnings

confirmed with support and higher highs strength is going up as we speak by open tommorrow well be barley red or green love how charts work most dont get them they all rely on news and opionion charts matter so much to risk mitigating
you cant honestly look at nflx with everything that is is facing and expect it to keep going up i think that both longs and shorts can agree that nflx is a solid company the question is multiple compression it is normal for a company to retract 2030 after such a huge run and particularly when its prospects are slowing slightly where would a 20 to 30 adjustment bring us think about that
im going to watch bird box again now

how is the oneyear target still 400
going to be a blood bath today
is is still worth buying in right now  or wait for a dip
netflix got too political with their movies they are dark depressing movies even the queens gambit had shades of the darkness and love of communism theme please dont want indoctrination just something to feel good about life and people just make action with a positive ending and feel good movies and that what disney does

man when will people start listening to me we all have a thing called the world wide web and people want good things at a good price now i have been researching this sector for years and i am a subscriber to netflix but i dont use it now the reason why will shock you they have the same shows on their since i started service now let me give you an anology if you have a starting five such as the golden state warriors and for years you are close to making the playoffs but then you lose in the first round if you do make it now you trade some players or aquire all stars such as adding super all star kevin durant you win the championship now going back to netflix is that they are not staying competitive and when walmart which is way bigger than netflix will ever be starting their streaming service or how google is buying up the virtual reality sector you will see why netflix will not compete they need to clean up their business or they will get squished by its competitors
in video streaming business subscribers will switch in a heartbeat therefore content will be the kingtherefore netflix will rule in the long run
ouch right in my puts
in the neighborhood of disney’s market cap hilarious
susan rice knows nothing about tech why on earth would they select someone so liberal and so controversial talk about being completely out off tune with a conservative point of view what does that tell you about the arrogance of mgmt or their isolation from conservative points of view i wouldnt trust this board anymore to make right decisions after this move
i am hoping to close at 450 or higher tonight and then open at 500
wowwhole thing was pumped up by analysts so they could sell their shares into strength and then the shelf offering the company and the street made out and retail suffers sad
controlled selling will continue folks until stock hits 200s its obvious that big boys are exiting but dont want it to go down so fastthey want to get as much money out small retail investors will be holding the bag
so tempted to get more here
susan rice now with netflix how could that possibly be positive for them
analysts will be raising earnings and revenue estimates momentum investors will take this to 1000 by years end

gregory too many to name my friend with the same first name i’m an actor and over the last 2 yrs there are 4x more netflix auditions because of the shift out of hollywood hollywood sells to china and 16 year olds in america now with superhero movies taking over the good scripts don’t bring people to theaters any longer and so it pushes the action to netflix who’s giving actors their own shows glad i bought in recently

seriously folks stock is up 70 since jan 1 what logic is there to justify such a rise in valuation i want the same prescription everyone is taking
look out below
the ironic thing is that all the netflix bulls like rich greenfield who have been calling on major studios to start showing big films on streaming rather than in theaters means netflix content will look less attractive up against movies like wonder woman which will be on hbo max or all the movies disney is now considering putting on disney plus ive been saying this for years name brand content matters netflix needs a bunch of shows and movies that have widespreadbreakout appeal like stranger things and finding those shows is not easy its also very expensive to create name brand content from scratch when properties like marvel dc star wars etc have already had decades to gain fans
honestly raising 2 at the risk of losing 10 or more per client is absurd with covid and the lack of liquidity that people are having they should offer a 2 special for 6 months to lock in new costumers and see what the economic situation is like after they are not alone in this industry anymore they should start thinking more about strategy rather than take for granted the subscribers
one side of the mind says it is too good to be true and the other side says it is too good to miss out this is how all scams and bubbles flourish but ultimately this fake market will tank even more sharply than the last month

nflx is finished  at least for the time being all analysts have upgraded and pumped to the max the stock is up 40 ytd they will sing the same old story about international growth blah blah blah  but the facts are that nflx is burning cash at an alarming rate the stock is way overvalued and it has 10 billion of debt with no end in sight to the cash bleed which means more debt issuance is unavoidable which makes the stock more risky and the interest rate paid higher
how are your new short positions working out
i do not understand
i like your passion mangirl whatever
did you guys find odd that eric sheridan was the only analyst asking questions during the eq after his staged upgrade a week ago

what about this warrants a pe 10x higher than dis this company is so overvalued it would need to double earnings every year for several years to even start justifying this valuation
even though i sold at 33823 i think this will run more just not today i expect a retrenchment to around 335 very soon and will buy back ifwhen it hits 332 this is a strong long term play concerns about negative cash flow are crazy worried about a couple billion negative cf when the market cap zooms 14b in one day and is up 63b so far this year hats off to anyone who put a lot into this at year end quite a ride

down grade the day before er that sound familiar oh wait isn’t that is exactly what they did to apple before the er jumped the stock by 12 i smell some fishes
if netflix eventually reaches 1 billion subscribers and i dont see anyone impeding them from doing that then 195 or 325 or 425 theyre all very cheap
disney will now have the opportunity to pull all of the content that belong to fox from netflix in addition to its own content
friday nflx had a down day if and i mean if monday is a positive surprise then we may see a gap up but this is would be a special  unique gap up a bullish kicker one of the strongest bullish signals stay tuned
400 after er or higher possible
nothing that a strong slate of content cant fix netflix waiting for people to get back from vacation to put out its best content we could see a 10 million subscriber add q before years end
impeccable timing httpsyoutuberpuu3twvbk
right after lunch the buying begin again
any chance of netflix ever providing live entertainment streams such as sports and the like thats one thing which would make cable completely obsolete
whats a better buy apple or nflx i am confused
has nice bear cover into this stockjust wondering how long to hold it 280 seems to happen easily but i see also 266 lurking around that price we may see a slight comeback but basically 2020 will be mostly bad news for netflix due rising competition
300400 gap will fill real quick
i dont have gut to buy nflx at 391 i may get in at 325 my experience tells me losswin ratio is 8020 at current price i will wait for the bubble bursting this week at the current price i would rather buy fb with much better valuation
this stock is looking good for a buy i will take a small bite tomorrow i have made good this year so i am going to bet that the fang stocks will rebound
average volume is 848million today volume was 1233million it tells me the banks sold long shares retail investors dont have this kind of high volume

there will be definately a huge dip before going to 600
i love the fact the media is playing netflix like its the whole market
i do like netflix but its too expensivefair value is at 280
up up up  easily at least 5 today
so what disney is doing is saying they are offering pbs kids shows 24 hours a day for 7when pbs kids is free on public tv
i honestly wouldn’t be surprised if this hit 600 mid morning
what a destructive and meaningless drop today
1700 shares long
this is the best growth play around no reason to sit on the fence

i can’t even blame people for selling here yes it should be over 520 but it doesn’t pay to wait and hold while so much money is being made i’m still trading a bit but having lots of funds tied up here is definitely a limitation just can’t justify selling at these prices not in a market near highs so much speculation is rewarded can’t see this not running back towards 600 soon

another funny thing about the nflx shorts weve already covered how whiny they are is how bornyesterday they are they dont seem to have the slightest idea that when amzn was 300 then 400 then 600 their message board was full of posts about high pe this and no business model that and cant justify and bubble andanyway its 1750 now nflx may or may not do the same obviously it has so far but you can tell that the shorts have no idea the different ways something can go its like they all started trading the day they shorted nflx

the last i posted about pi it was trading unofficially at 02x per coin and that is now all the way up to 08x and there are over 10 million minerspioneers mining coins on their phonesbefore you skip the post thinking its useless for you check out where bitcoin is trading today its over 24000 per coin i am not saying that pi will be that successful but what if it even reaches 100 per coin in the future even if you can mine 1000 coins by the mainnet launch the next year those coins can be worth a significant amount of moneyin any way you never have to pay anything to anyone to mine pi its open for anyone to mine on their phone as bitcoin was in earlier days just download the app on your phone use invitation code celebration26 when registering its by invitation only and make sure to use your legal name as when they assign the coins to your wallet in the future they will verify that if you are the person who you said you areas far as my progress i have mined so far about 10k coins which unofficially are worth about 8k and possibly can be worth much more when the mainnet is officially launched and the pi starts trading on crypto exchanges officially

so why is this deserving of 220 so fast
whats the expectations of netflix earnings going to beat expectations
remember when a stock comes down where it becomes flat it allows the buyers that’s wants in for a pull down and when shorts recover it will take the stock higher this one was flat for 56 straight days

while good quarter i am sure everyone going to ignore but marketing cost is keep going higherit raise from 271270 to 479222 thats 76 raise this clearly mean company is spending lot more just to keep stock price inflated i think company need to finance negative cash flow so those marketing cost is justified because that way they can keep getting better rating and more interest in debt

reading all these people saying it will pop crash and drop means it will sky rocket
some people says there are 19b house hold and so netflix can grow much furthernow this exact point i think netflix will never able to grow above 200m level even while growing so fast currentlyhere is reasonout of those 19b house hold 80 people dont make more than 10day this mean possible house holds who can afford netflix service or netflix like service is 400mnow in market like usa where most make more than 10day they have hard time achieving 40 penetration and marketing cost already ballooning so i dont think netflix able to achieve 50 overall even when you count 23 of those poor subscribe  include here you reach 200m max with service from disney  apple hbo hulu youtube facebook and 100s of other countries local i think 50 penetration is great achievement and that put to 200m max at current price if they reduce subscriber price than its different deal but will market allow that it will cause 30 haircut in no time
surprised that netflix didn’t take a huge hit today because of disney and is actually green why more competition the better someone please explain
intc nflx wimi ba most of the tech stocks sitting on strong support level and they have strong earnings coming up chart is also setting up very nicely wouldnt be surprise to see strong price action upwards for the next few weeks

since the beginning of the year nflx 2019 eps estimates have been tumbling from 406 to 342 while cash burn estimates has shot up to 3 billionyear large media companies with tons of content and much better capitalized have announced entering the streaming business and pulling their content from nflx netflixs business model seems as shaky as it ever was and loaded with debt with spiraling costs and interest rates makes it financial situation highly risky yet despite all this the stock is up 42 ytd trading at 120 pe and 160 billion market cap this is very much a disaster waiting to happen just like the dotcom crash of the early 2000s

its clear now it was netflix that opted not to renew the disney movie deal at the moffetmathanson media and communication conference sarandos pointed to new big budget titles as 1 area where it no longer makes sense for netflix to spend a ton of money  because if you really want to catch the latest blockbuster you probably already saw it in theaterswe said maybe we can put the billion dollars wed put in an output deal into original films he said

hey all i’m not long or short here and just started looking into the company and am a little confused by the business model i get that they are spending boatloads to create content which is amounting to significant cash burn resulting in negative cfo seems as though management is confident this is necessary to keep subscribers growing and will lay the groundwork for a strong stream of income into the future that sounds great if it works out but this almost seems to good to be true questions that come to mind are how long will it take to be cash flow positive especially with the burn rate increasing rather than decreasing what if popular shows fall out of favor in the distant future get pirated or too many new shows flop what about competition this just seems to me like a very aggressive strategy and that no matter how many subscribers they can get the ultimate sustainability of the business will depend on being able to generate cash flow which can only mean higher prices which will attract more competition at some point this reminds me a little bit of the flaws of pandora’s model in a way where they had to spend more and more on royalties to keep up with subscriber growth i guess there’s something i’m missing here because market clearly doesn’t agree with me but it’s not like crazier things haven’t happened before or will again
i will buy at 200
i made tons of money shorting stocks shorting in this market is a lot safer and easier than going long

can someone educate me that how they only expect 21 revenue growth when they just hiked 18 price on the subscription are they only expecting 3 growth if they didn’t hike the price v？

if it hits 595 im topping off my short for some serious gains tomorrow so i can cover at 550s i mean who the heck is buying still at this range i know true investors will dislike but us who day trade and swing trade follow if you want to make easy fast money im sure it will come back to this price range later this year but man way too high to try to maintain short term

time to take profit on long trades and prepare to go short
after q1’s record breaking subscription numbers canaccord analyst maria ripps expects netflix to post another strong report along with the secular tailwinds blowing at its back the 5star analyst points out the simple reason why she thinks netflix will keep on outperforming“analysis of our proprietary netflix content power rankings highlights continued momentum in original content as subscribers around the world spent more time at home during q2 due to the pandemic and amid continued competitive intensity the importance of netflixs content slate has arguably gone up it seemingly delivered creating a consistent stream of interest and buzz around original titles” maria wroteyou can count the roaring success of tiger king crime drama ozark dating reality series too hot to handle and michael jordan docuseries the last dance among the titles which have kept sofa bound consumers tuned into netflix add to that children content which got a meaningful boost during schools’ closures and a sizeable library of reality tv shows and docuseries “with the two genres representing over 20 of the top 10 most popular tv series during q2” and you get ripps’ point httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsnetflixoriginalcontentlibraryseparates005355727html

any one ever wonder how nflx got to 220 pe it is like exactly like bitcoin manipulation 90 of stock is instutationprivate owned and only 10 is freely traded todays price is based on that 10 stock once the institution start to sell stock for profit nflx will be steeply down like crypto
you guys were right 280 
big news coming heading up up up 500
this is worth at least 345
stocks typically drop on day 2 after a selloff like today lets see if nflx holds true to that my guess is it will be off 23 tomorrow then resume the run to 450
i cant find any news for this kind of volatility that fast
congrats to long

pay attention to fubotv looks like potential buyout by big boys
gene munster said fb nflx aren’t the performers for future
the shorts are missing the main reason for the runit is their pricing powerthey can bump up their revenue by raising their monthly fee by 2550  without losing any sub its the cheapest form of entertainment out therecostco and amazon are in the same boat
amazing that this can tack on 13 billion of extra market cap on a sub beat of only 900k means every extra sub beyond forecast was worth about 14000
does anyone have a copy of the upgrade note including earnings or cash flow model from this ubs analyst did he make any material upward adjustments to his model for example or did he just return from a 2 week vacation and upgrade the stock for his bankers
will buy when it tanks at close
watching on the sidelines interesting show i must say
according to kerplunk tonight’s the last day for the earth
amazing that the funds are still buying this stock despite the massive run up over the past 5 years one thing is for sure though nflx pioneered the ott concept and has a strong lead over its rivals but cash burn needs to go down at some point else people who bought in at todays prices will need to keep waiting forever to get back their investment jmtc
thumbs up for 370 today
i guess 350 is toooo much work to cross it
sell now this is going to tank you will thank me for the advice
another day another high
love fake nflx accounts to pump the stock price
upgrade is coming
will be green before the market closes nothing is allowed to go down comrades
based on option 300 strike 1213 expiration calls open interest 6739 and big volume 10307 against puts open interest 1928 and small volume 1686 tomorrow the stock should be hovering between 300 and 303
is this a bubble im thinking its heyday is past
someone’s poking the bear 
we seem to all be hoping for a great earnings report i have some worry but i hope it will be great 26 more hours till earnings report good luck
nflx pretty sure folks arent going to cancel subscription because of pandemic the paltry price increase isnt going to have most people cancel either this is a forever buy
i didn’t sell i bought more 
what are your price predictions for the next 4 weeks
i remember in the old days people said amazon is just a website any one can build one now i see people saying the same about nflx
i see this hitting all time highs soon netflix is a family known brand and will be for the foreseeable future no hardware needed  strong brand loyalty  great shows and great pricing does it for them my price target is set to 500 going into 2021
poll will nflx break over high by weeks end
is this just a short squeeze don’t see any news
this reminds me of the early days of nflxyes i got into nflx after it’s ipowhile reflecting back i got in at 8 per share about a 10point drop after its ipoit’s eps we’re still in the red but it’s churn rate money a co spends to attract new customers was going lower and it was expanding and everyone in boston was talking about its convenienceby the next qtrly eps and following qtr eps trading up and sideways  it kept revealing lower qtrly eps losses lowered churn rate increased sales and quarterly eps improved and well once nflx began to receive more and more upgrades and beat analysts eps it shot up and upunfortunately my broker had put a sell order in to sell 12 my position at 125 my shares were sold and within a week or 2 it was nearly 200 and announced a split and again skyrocketed my remaining shares were sold at 201
i think this is a great time to buy

nflx added more subscribers  raised the price but the earning per share did not meet expectations is that make sense not for me
nflx must has a lot of customers and a lot profit these times because almost all europe has quarantined last weeks so i think earnings will beat the expectations
look at the other major stocks a similar pattern of sell off no matter how you promote the stocks it’s mainly running by big boys and shorts today is sell off day for profit taking
again i’ll say it long and strong love netflix
largest bubble stock in the history of the world trading at 2200 presplit with massive debt and a spending binge
netflix is raising monthly subsc by another 1 and the stock will jump another 40
this is one of biggest market caps in the world that barely makes eps this stock always amazes
americans have 125000 new cases a day and they think the virus is over 
what did you think it would just keep going back up market wants to see 330 before we see ath again so get ready
it will amazing 50 drop buckle up for next weeks all puts loaded
casino is back today how else can fang stocks be up today when nobody wanted them last few days lol
congrats to those who held last er it went back from 550 to 485
mr what strike price on april 18 calls would you take
has netflix ever split 
nflx already guided higher during their q earnings ccroku guided lowerwouldnt that mean that that nflx taking their business will be interesting what disney says
interesting with the company hiring susan rice many will cancel their service many dont like her from the obama administrationenjoy this ride for now next month will be different
it will drop back below 500 in a few weeks no longer growing much and eps dropping only sustained by jacking up monthly sub
up 7700 from 50000
selling jan 20 calls for 88 to 100 deferred cash a share is your remedyif you did this in jan and stock was taken wait three days then buy the dip but pocket 100 once againdo not sell putsnflx is not aapl
cramer said buy nflx last night
netflix to 250
a sea change going on in tv and movie industry right now netflix mc increase over the past 2 years equal to 12 disney mc which has remained flat reflects this sea change
susan rice now says 911 was caused by a cartoon and obama is taking credit for amazon
i wonder if this could recover to 370 today
httpswwwpolygoncom20182716982030disneyleavingnetflixmarvellucasfilmpixarstreamingrightsthey are going to lose a lot of content here  may be a reason for the decline  they need accretive acquisitions to make up for ithttpwwwdhxmediacom
let me tell you all something nflx is a good company you want to buy it by all mean buy it by the next year this time it could be 600 a share or could be 100 a share a company that gains or losses 30 billion  in market cap in one week is not an investment is more of a gambling up until now not much competitions for netflix but other companies now getting more serious or increase their exposures in this area such as amazon apple disney att hulu with the current evaluations that netflix has it better be no competitions around there is no room for errors dont just think because it dropped from 400 to 360 now is a burgain once the trend breaks the down fall is fast and furious
ok whats the story today
huge sell coming ah
would be nice if we hit 350 again by the end of the week and i still think its possible although it seems that 345 is the limit this week
kaboom 45000 coming
after this crash i wonder if my netflix account will still be active when i comehome from vacation in a week
down over 30 from high
love to see near 400 to short again and make 
wow look like is going back on track
i invested in t it provides a 7 dividend owns both the pipe and premium content with hbo max and its price is a fraction of netflix with a pe of 8 versus netflixs 56 sooner or later the market will understand this
only company in the world that beats earnings estimates by 30 and loses 13 valuation in 2 days something massively wrong with that
longs just remember this trades on sub growth the bogey for next quarter is 64m they did 81m last quarter they always beat on sub growth when that happens this will pop once again
this should be exploding with goog news i was hoping for 366 cmon nflx momo coming back here
guess im gonna be holding netflix for a while the analysts seemed to know in advance the subscriber number would drop the stock insider information is so unfair
netflix india will boost the growth
six month base analysts missed badly last 3 quarters nongaap was 5 below estimates then 12 19 why couldnt eps be over 2 q4 2020
furthermore loop capital analyst rob sanderson pointed out that netflix could be close to free cashflow positive this year due to the massive industrywide production halts due to the covid19 outbreak“given the industry production shutdown we estimate nflx will spend 25b less this year and be close to free cash flow positive with the largest library and the entire industry shut down we think nflx will spend less while expanding its competitive edge” sanderson said in a note april 17
here it comes
sold 330 puts here into december against my position comfortable being long at 330
every stock has gone up only netflix is not doing well there will be a day when it will fly too just hold this stock do not sell
looks like a double top to me
hard to hold
for my fellow newbie robinhood investors if you are wondering why the sudden drop hold tight it was just a small correction dont use any margins whatsoever we might see some drastic drops since goog msft nvda amd tsla nflx amzn all of them are highly overvalued right now only retail investors like you are buying these and smart money want to get out at the moment dont use any margins and dont make rush calls i would never buy from these levels either or short them
closed all my position on nflx bye everybody good luck
earning is up 32 from last quarter how come nobody mentioned here
very little competition market far from saturated and a very low pe whats not to like here easy double next 12 months
an upgrade for goldman who has been down trending for the last 16 months isnt a great thingjust saying
it will start gaining again and hit 500 in no time
put all your money in netflix and just wait u will be rich
nflx totally subverts the fundamentals of valuation when it never had positive fcf since the beginning of operations yet the stock is priced at the current lofty level that does not make any financial sense this is the x generation investment mentality of herd effect which throw the old school fundamental analysis out of window well time will tell what will eventually evolve good luck
would be nice to see nflx punch pass the 52 week high i’m liking my ‘nan’ stocks nvda amzn nflx a lot long term buy and hold true legacy stocks
i praying for a 101 split go netflix
there’s rotation out of fanny ex apple not surprising people can make money in other sectors at the moment

if netflix is going to release good numbers why wouldn’t they wait to announce price hikes until after or even during quarterly earnings seems like numbers may not be good so they want to run it up as much as possible before they announce to minimize damage
what happened to 400 few days in afh man this stock is rigged to crash below 250 in a week
with competition so high how come analysts still think the subscriber numbers gonna stay the same the will go down for sure there’s not point in this stock going high longs gonna get burnt soon
i just saw todd gordon genius explaining on cnbc why he thought nflx would go down today and then he taught the viewers how to read a candle chart i wonder what these so called top analysts studied during thier school years
down after hours this is inevitable
just added to position 
on a down day nflx was strong especially at the close that tells me wall street knows what we don’t know but are wishing for buy the rumor sell on the news then buy again or just hold it if an investor
see you guys at 300
one of the best stocks to buy right now will be loading up as soon as the market starts
fun facts  number of movie tickets sold in india is 2x the number of movie tickets sold in us the total box office revenue in asia pacific is 15x the box office revenue in us  canada those markets are huge and streaming services are in nascent stages huge upside potential for nflx if they play their cards right they do have one advantage  they are a leader in us and investments they make in creating international content helps them grow internationally and helps strengthen their base in us even further

stay clear of netflix until it settles down some more downside seems to be coming up
bought some shares 353
closing 390 today mr wonderful from shark tank loves this stock
if you didn’t know this was coming then you are dense they have been releasing great info for two weeks now not just great info but huge info new content coming out every week in 2021 and with huge movie stars come on this will hit 575 tomorrow and 600 next week
if it closes above 35520 it will be the first 16 day since june 13
as soon as i heard about the obama show i cancelled
wonder if hedge funds are running a trade of long disney  short nflx at the moment there was a big gap up on disney price at around 127 and share price is looking extended now it will be interesting if the trade reverses when  if nflx finally releases some market moving info hopefully soon glta

machinedriven trading
twelve dollars off the high for today geez
it really makes no sense that this stock is under 500 when you look at nflx growth and strength and overall stock market lots of companies with lessor prospects are close to 52 week highs look at roku for example it’s just a matter of time before this is back above 500 and more likely closer to 550
i just sold and shorted at 395 seems to want to go lower
all of you shorts are going to be annihilated when netflix passes 400 and then 500keep with your doom and gloom see how it works out for you

lot of people says dot com and this rally is different i agree with them back in dotcom rally was broad cover lot of different companies in bubble territory this rally focus on few hot names now is that good or bad very hard to tell but here is my thoughtbecause people only invest in hot names money concentrated into top 50 company in this market mainly now lets say amzn or nflx or tsla suddenly find hard to handle with limited balance sheet they will have hard time meeting obligation and stock can crash big time if one of such company fail fear to exit will run given most invested in 50 company those all exiting into same names as well and what will happen when everyone thinking to exit same time

you buy nflx and ill buy dis well see which one goes up friday it looks like investors ran from amzn appl and nflx to dis not only has disney been in business since 1923 it has family oriented content netflix is ok but for me its entirely too liberal i get it netflix is trying to appeal to everyone but i still dont like it disney has a ton of potential for growth that investors like for example amusement parks streaming cruises it just acquired fox etc

for the naysayers and the longs who know a good company and investment when they see onenetflix is a positive cash flow company they are making money hand over fist they currently owe more than they make but as they gain subscribers projected 200 million by 2020 and pay the debt down nflx will become one of the wealthiest companies on the planet companies borrow money all the time even blue chip companies to invest in growth and infrastructure fb borrowed a ton of money before they were net positive so did sirius xm and amzn the math is there and its simple thats why the stock price is what it is with 79 institutional investment the institutional investment wouldnt be so high if the banks didnt see a golden goose shorties just want to try and drive the price down with nonsense so they can make a 45 gain here or there while us longs are already up over 100 on the year i know what side id rather be on with this stock the shorts are going to get burned and then cry that its manipulation or some other nonsense its hilarious how no matter how well a stock is doing there is always the sky is falling types that cry doom and gloom if theyd care to take a look at numbers nflx only has a 45 short interest on its share float thats literally like saying 45 out of 100 people think the stock is going to go down in the short term thats extremely low most shorters dont have the stomach to watch a 510 rise above their short price and they close with a loss that is going to happen with the short float leading up to earnings and we might get a nice little 23 squeeze on top of the next rally if you shorties were confident in your position you wouldnt be on here day after day hour after hour posting nonstop armageddon is coming nonsense but hey good luck

closing green

why does yahoo finance indicate this has a beta  1 right now it stands at 069
way to go longs i dont own
if netflix has taught me anything that is how to stomach seeing your stock go down 30 knowing no one is near this company’s current market going to keep holding
shorts please form a line to be measured for your hot dog suit
market maker priced this for a 35 move 380 is right in line with their estimates longs should be happy they got their direction correct shorts should be thankful its not higher

440 close  lol
if you believe in streaming invest in disney as well i am long dis and short nflx although for netflix my exit point on short is near i would not remain short below 230240 i will exit 260 actually but may continue sell out of money calls for premium until it reach below 250 and buy if this goes below 150 which seem unlikely but in this market nothing impossible
get iq stock now  china version of netflix in its infancy

might end green today lol 
will hit 265275 my opinion of course
new high this week or 340
they have more subscriber  price raise yet they not able to beat revenue target market want to celebrate all little thing but this beat specially domestic beat is due to tmobile cable provider giving free netflix with their service
crazy how i can go from optimistic at 4am at 520 and now it’s down to 485 i was going to take some more off the table in my stocks today this news totally screwed up my day i’m glad there is hope for a vaccine but the timing is horrible for me naturally welcome to life hopefully today presents profitable trading opportunities to offset loses
up 14 of 16 trading days this year up 34 which is a 361 increase market cap has increased 30 billion in those 16 days really the only significant news in that time was that they beat on subs by just 193 million they met on rev and eps thats a 155 million market cap increase for each new subscriber wow this is just amazing
my model is showing they added 65 million subscribers last quarter and they’re off to a very strong start this quarter

just out of curiosity if someone upgrades does that mean people tend to buy on their thoughts what if someone else downgrade the same stock would y’all all sell wouldn’t you want to do some research for yourself on if it’s valued or not before investing on your own then someone else’s word just trying to figure this crazy market thing out thanks good luck to all with whatever positions you have
i read and also felt it would happensubscribers jumping from streaming service to service after bing watchingcuts down the subscriber numbersalso the cost of content has gone up a great deal which is another major factor netflix has to deal with and they have huge debt
get some baba too
warm up your engines boys get ready to fly
lets hope nflx goes beast mode tomorrow
an article will appear in 2028 july 15th on cnbc it would say  do you know how much you would have made had you invested 2000  in nflx 10 years ago and the article will conclude that you would have made 100k
just bought another 350 shares at37041
i really do not like holding a position in a company when earnings hit but i may just try a short position on netflix i think the numbers would have to be great to move the needle higher and i expect them to be no better than good and maybe a little negative 
netflix rules
got in at 287 and i’m not getting out netflix is gold it will bounce right back up

33750 before friday
sell offs like this is way more than a 3b revenue miss if you believe in netflix and believe it’s not going anywhere therefore will continue to grow and make money but doesn’t perform on a quarter the way analyst say it should then why do people sell it just hurts your stock if patience and relaxation would take place even on a miss your stock would stay solid and be closer to 400 a share again really think about it the share will drop low again when it was up 50 but people will still invest and not go anywhere so why sell seems to me people hurt their own finances by tanking there own stock
bad content is true i always cancel after trial because theres nothing to see as far as im concerned

for q1 nflx is projecting 635m subscriber adds lol thats what they had for last quarter too and they came in at 83m let me guess here i predict they come in at 83million for the quarter and the stock explodes up 8 on the news
why does it fall apart for know reason
excellent 16 ah trading 36 by tomorrow congratulations my long friends
someone just bought my remaining share over 563 im out good luck everyone
netflix beat the last 3 earnings i hope next one will also beat
if youre destin to own this stock through earnings with a target price of 36500 check out the buying the jan 25th calls for 775 one contract will cost u 78000 includes the commision 1 contract equals 1000 shares of nflx stock much less risk if your objective is a great earnings call since you can only lose your 78000 original buy price if out of the money however if it doesnt crash you still have a time value my point is dont end up paying 33k on 100 shares of stock you will lose way more than 80000 if it turns against you i tried to explain as simple as i could that trading options is fun with much less risk and not hard as long as you have a plan gl

anyone have a clue news story etc why nflx has dropped nearly a percent in the few opening minutes of after hours trading
beef stew
im just enjoying living vicariously through the anxiety on this board longs v shorts puts v calls in a battle that has been described as nflx most important earnings ever who will declare victory find out in about an hour
it is not a trap it is a bubble that will come down hard
since march 2020 the us companies that report earnings see at least 10 jump in their stock price no matter how terrible earningloss report nflx is getting pumped again despite falling earnings
the market makers added the 12221 option chain today nflx earnings will be that week looking for that earnings pullback then diving in
i think from here onward we will be rangebound between 360385 until next earnings if 3q is good then 410440 if 3q is bad 310 will be tested
for those who are so confident that nflx is just another bubble stock consider this at one time apple amzn and google hit 400 for the first time true no stock deserves a 100 pe based on earnings alone the question to be answered is whether future international growth can result in a stock worth 20 per share that is entirely possible because content costs do not increase 1 for 1 with each new subscriber lots of subscribers sharing the same content will increase earnings per sharenflx is in 130 countries and has only a tiny percentage of the population signed up so far

okay everyone i have something to admit the reason im trying to warn everyone on this is that god came to me in a dream and told me my position would fall it was the night of the 5th i had this dream i dreamt that i woke up the morning of november 8th 3 days later looked at my phone as i routinely do and saw a sudden drop down to 26661 per share it was between a 57 and 60 per share drop i did my same drive routinely into the office having to pretend everything was okay when it really wasnt the dream felt so real but i still thought it was a bunch of garbage until i saw this go near 328 im heeding gods warning to me now i sold my position around 1030 this morning i know most of you on here wont believe me but i had to get this off my chest i dont want to see my brothers and sisters suffer tomorrow
good time to get on board
what happens when the bell rings it cant stay here
honestly netflix deserves a big thank you from disney for showing them the path to getting the market excited if disney now gets to be valued like netflix and roku the sky is the limit netflix was the teacher disney was the pupil the question now is will the pupil surpass the teacher

watch out for possible sell off seeing as alot of people will probably cancel subscriptionnetflix is not worth the price hike nothing good on their selections imo
we need a hedge fund to start moving it up
what needs to happen within the next 3 months for nflx to reach 420 is that a realistic goal i lost some money on the big dip after the last earnings report and wondering if i should stay long or sell and put that money in other stocks that have more upward momentum
one of the most dangerous things to happen in financial markets is to be right for the wrong reasons if you fail to recognize that you were lucky then you will continue to make investment decisions based on faulty reasoning and eventually your luck will run out

netflix expected to report 43 streaming revenue growth the fastest in 5 years
didnt like the afternoon selloff but ending up 3 on a day when all of the major averages were noticeably down is still pretty good i agree with some of the other posts  tomorrow well probably drop a few dollars early then slowly rise throughout the day to finish somewhere in the mid370s

disney vs netflix for long term hold thoughts 
httpss22q4cdncom959853165filesdocfinancialsquarterlyreports2018q4finalq418shareholderletterpdf
wait until after the shutdown for the real major leg down because of the government shutdown the treasury hasn’t been issuing checks at its usual pace in the first half of january when it was expected to issue 75 billion in new debt it has issued zero that’s 75 billion that gets to live in the financial markets for another couple of days in fact as long as the government shutdown grinds on that will keep the stock and bond markets liquified when they would otherwise have been starved for cash
some people are saying that nflx earnings are not going to meet expectations yet a majority of the nation 328 million are told to stay home while at the same time movie theatre’s are being shut down am i missing something here to me this looks like a great opportunity for nflx to take over the market they just bought out the paris theatre in nyc so that they can begin to have their moviesshows receive oscas what makes you think they wouldn’t do the same with amc or regal someone please enlighten me because all i see is upside from here
going ro 200
wonder who the buyers were at 41040lol
this is exactly why i never could justify buying netflix anyone can copy what they are doing i knew it was just a matter if time before the bottom fell out
monday after close nflx will be up 50
first green monday since oct 1 so at least we have that going on for us

netflix stock gets pricetarget cut as subscriber outlook lowered
this is never going back downsubscriptions will increase and price of subs will rise everyone loves netflix
540 today the last 3 days haven’t been to good but today and tomorrow will skyrocket the stock
not even up to 1b paying subscriber base yet it’s mind boggling to think of fast the adoption is nflx is almost a must and will be a must in every house hold monster buy
hahahahahaha
i will continue to say this is a dead cat bounce some funds are caught with the surprise and even though nflx had quarters like this it is different this time a few years ago the cable guys and network were asleep at the wheel and there was no amzn hulu and appl the competition is definitely different this round and the results in the past quarter are reflective of this people are lured to other providers besides nflx they may have some original content but others can also put money on creating something even better as for international subscribers in asia there are not many paying customers as people are used to free content and there are lots of those tv top boxes now that are floating around no one is willing to pay for content there and china will be a big joke just wait til trade war extends to content and the chinese will ban all partnerships to show content that they define as immorale western values
seems like nflx will hit that new target of 490 before the end of summer my question to ths group is at that level the stock is very close to 500 and wouldn’t it be time for another stock split
seems to be a trend high of the day around 10am then lower highs and lower lows
best day since june 26 1491 that day6day losing streak is snapped

netflix will report earnings after close on monday estimates are 080 there is concern for the stock price because 1 pe is very high 2 its up over 108 in a year 3 if a competitor like hulu were to be bought by say direct tv netflix would take a big hit 4 nothing goes straight up forever even a slight er miss would sent the stock price tumbling glta
sorry bulls but this is going under 300 by end of the monthbeat earnings by 006 but estimates were a very low bar down 011 from last year despite subscriber growthmissed revenueinternational subscriber growth was light and their contribution to the bottom line was down by 080 subscribervery important given that is where all the new growth isfinally most important guidance for q1 is way down 083 estimate to  060 new guidance despite subscription fee increasescash burn also to increase slightly in 2019yeahi dont see this continue to rise next few months
in buy territory hmm might try buying some today
it is clear to me that nflx will rise past 400 in a few daysasian growth not even factored in the numbers yetwow

netflix fans have you ever opened their financial statements
340 easy today
up 25 or 85 which is well over 10 billion in market cap in just the past 2 trading days on essentially no significant news based on sheer momentum you would guess it hits 350 by end of the week and then 400 after er if they added more subs than projected which they always do
“at the other end of the income statement netflix’s adjusted q2 earnings are projected to skyrocket 433 from 015 per share in the prioryear period to 080 per share”
unbelievable it holds over 330 honestly it should of drop to bellow 200 by now

the best for apple is to buy netflix what do you think
netflix needs to spend massive money to ensure content rich programming how will they ever be able to slow the content spending down to make a profit and pay down debt i have no problem with a company spending big money to build out its infrastructure amazon but where is the light at the end of the tunnel for this company are there really enough possible subscribers in the world to overcome this problem
they have so many tools to pumps these stocks they can make it go wherever they want

final trade yesterday on cnbc  sell nflx hows that working for you
what happened to all the pumpers
tomorrow should open at 390’s
bought some puts
i forgot earnings is the 16th its the 12th alreadyi probably would have bought some at the bottom for a bouncewait til after earnings and then trade it could go either way im leaning toward a sell off but they could have some really good news
the robust earnings on april 16 in particular surging international growth should propel nflx beyond 400 look around you and speak to your friends around the world all seem to be addicted to nflx original content hours of high quality streaming content when and where you want it commercialfree and intelligently catered to your taste  coming at a price of watching a single flick  nflx is a game changer i predict consumers will ungrudgingly pay an extra buck or two for its service adding hundreds of millions to the bottom line is competition increasing  sure but we still have 200 million americans still subscribing to network tv i predict blue skies for nflx for the next earnings and beyond

never underestimate netflix will wait for morning pumpers before shorting today
nio goog nflx wimi this market is definitely a sight to see it baffles me that people are short right now
people dont look into but it increasingly costly for netflix to get subscriber this include domestic being more difficult but overseas this is slowly becoming problem as wellthey spending whole lot to get growth but cost to get new subscriber is not sustainabledomestic it already reaching near 100 and overseas its near 50domestic is worst it double over last couple year that mean its increasingly difficult for new customer which expected given most already have it overeas given 150 country launch its hard to determine but i think last quater its clear cost is raising very quicklynow why they keep spending more on advertisement in domesticsimple they have to replace all customer who they losing otherwise it will look they start losing subscriber instead gaining and stock will tank if stock tank it will much harder to finance spending  also retain talent they likely offering stock as part of their content deal as wellin otherword this is how you can hide serious problem with either churn rate or harder to get new customerits also possible that many are keep cancelling and resigning again thats actually best hope otherwise some point it will hard to replace leaving customer and stock will tank very badly
cord cutting continues and nflx will do just fine the drop is an opportunity to buy some shares because it will be 400 but the end of the year
at least we closed above 375
i guess nflx likes higher interest rates shows what i know i thought higher interest rates would put downward pressure on the stock price
here is the wall street disconnect for the day  nflx double their earnings shares are down 3 
500 target
it will reach all time high again by the end of next weekwho agree with me give a thumbs up

hear me out shouldn’t netflix buy game of thrones milk it for more money on netflix with spinoffs after some time when netflix makes a bit load more money they can open up a theme park and they have really good stuff in their portfolio in this case got stranger things and other netflix hits could be rides and experiences in the parks netflix food originals boom restaurants and shops the amount of money they could make on parks is huge in the future thoughts
ive used both amazon video extensively and now using netflix the experience with netflix is so so much better i am quite the amazon fan but i think the only way big conglomerates like amazon can take on specialized services like netflix is to operate at a loss until they run netflix out of business netflix is too big for thattake a lesson from apple guys the ones who perfect a few options will succeed against those with many options that is why apple has been so successful offering only a few models to choose fromone could make the case that amazon provides a wholistic experience they are quite a ways away from thatwishing i had more money to invest at such a discount

it’s early but the fact that this isn’t up significantly premarket indicates another day of selling pressure is very likely we will likely retest 470 and 460 or even 450 is on the table if the trend out of faang continues beyond today i’m in a watch and see mode today same with apple and amazon hopefully i’m wrong and this can rebound today but i’m just being realistic
haha overreaction this company is extremely profitable pandemic or not don’t even own a single share
hey all you pessimists out there nothing goes straight up and long term investors in nflx will do well indeeda good business model innovative team and good leadership will prevail despite the increased competition remember that nflx has evolved from a mail order business into a streaming behemoth that should give you pessimists some pause and stop the selling nonsense and frenzy also one quarter does not a trend maje

the whole tech sector has been squashed not just nflx there is nothing wrong with the company they beat last earnings and are continuing to grow if you own hold if you dont own buy netflix is always exaggerated in its movement when the market goes back to an uptrend this will soar very quickly and erase the losses the only losers are those who sold their shares for a loss out of fear fear makes some men poor and others rich

they increased 2 monthly on 80100 million subs thats 24 billion off 3 billion yearly debt numbers still dont add up they need minimum 5 price increase to offset costdebt to start to have positive cash flow but at that price they wont be competitive anymore and will need to spend more to retain customers and at this point its not a growth stock anymore and it shouldnt be trading at 100 pe

netflix is the best of the streaming services i have all three and netflix is the easiest to navigate and use amazon seems to rent everything and hulu has commercials they will do well but those unbelievers can always put a stop loss in the account just in case the worst happens
bloomberg just posted overreaction on netflix stock should only be down about 2500

like amzn nflx has a decent and expanding moat bought at 180 will not be surprised for this to hit 300 by early 2019
the nasdaq will bust through 14000 very very soon
the stock ran ahead of growth now growth has caught up and the stock is getting ready to run ahead again

cover all my short overall its just break even since i cover 30 by selling 225 put last week i thought it wont go below that but i was wrong just like i was wrong about wont go above 220my intent was as hedge but i will stick to stock that really overvalue like amzn nflx no reason to short quality stock that only slightly overpriced compare to overall market riskbenefit does not justify
excited and scared at the same time ahahahh
fb will take the market with it tomorrow bubble has peaked only down from here first slowly then a steep slide margin debt is all time high at 600b margin calls will doom this market once we have even 34 slide

good friend of mine from high school works at td ameritrade i called him over the weekend he said when the markets have been so bad and many have lost 1030 equity in their positions a small 1 drop premarket causes tons of margin calls to go out most end up selling to cover the margin calls when market opens adding to the sell off and driving price down more viscous cycle youd be surprised how many people are trading on margingive someone credit and they will take it most houses bought on credit cars and most of the stocks as well
nice close

netflix was at 347 after market yesterday today were already back up to 364 patience is golden panic is brass
going to 360 today
gonna start seeing a runup to earnings
why is the top reaction still cold weather mean indoor movies hahahah lmao please lets get new reactionsnetflix is hot right now the upgrades are coming for a reason they are very well positioned if netflix needed to raise cash they are easily able to do so these are smart people on the board this is an investment not a cash cow i think they should raise our pricing 2300 per account they have produced a product people love and yearn for more of it makes sense while still keeping the cost of subscriptions relatively low me personally would rather pay a couple dollars more than see ad popups everywhere thoughts
a pe ratio of a whopping and nosebleed245is not sustainable and indicative of a bubbleall bubbles eventually poptxmd 
wait till nflx subscribers lose disney and national geographic etc and are left with whatever the new streamers allow nflx to buy disney and time warner own a lot more content than a bunch of made for tv soaps

goldman sachs is out bullish on nflx just 2 weeks ahead of its earnings report reiterating buy rating and a 12month price target of 470 reduced from 490 but still highest on street they must know something hmm
stocks never do what you think theyd do after earnings the last earnings call the stock rallied so now everyone thinks it will do it again been burned too many times
we have had netflix for over a year now we have been thinking of cancelling this price increase solidified our decision its a piece of junk with horrible content over all just thought i would state it here i have never owned one share of this company long or short
its only 15 after 100runup

people storming capitol now
netflix valuation is elusive for example after reporting q4 2016 earnings the stock gapped up to 140 it was only 87 five months earlier at pe 325 people were saying it was extremely overvalued 140 looks very cheap now at pe 34 on this years est earnings and pe 22 on next years est earnings and the company still growing faster than ever in a few years 350 will look very cheap
up
will turn green buy buy buy
600 soon great company
somebody told me today that all you have to do is buy amazon and netflix and you cannot lose money he said they only go higher personally i love both companies but when you hear people saying things like that we all know what happens

let me see nowcash flow losses in 2019 go to 35 billion from 30 billion previously us subscriber guidance of 03 million net additions in q2 is way below consensus it would appear us subscriber growth has reached a plateau and is about to flatline due to the churn from the massive price hike us subscriber base may actually decline by 4q when disney launches netflix has no growth remaining in the us
i thought everybody sold this when they learned the company was controlled by the obamas and soros
people hate to see success when they have no idea how to obtain it
3 million shares in 45 minutes that is heavy volume
analyst would be revising their price targets upwards with the huge subscriber growth nextflix global market still has much room to grow i myself subcribed to netfix in march last year when the pandemic striked and continue to see myself as a subcriber even after the pandemic

expect 10 slide in nasdaq nasdaq is up 20 in six weeks dont end up holding the bag
why netflix could surprise to the upsidethere are number of reasons why netflix could deliver betterthanexpected results next tuesday the covid19 pandemic was a key driver of the surge in the first half of the year when it added 259 million subscribers in october when the company offered that guidance the pandemic was much more controlled than it is today in the us daily new cases went from about 60000 to more than 200000 today while new infections similarly spiked in europe prompting lockdowns in countries like france and the uk as well as incremental measures in parts of the us like southern california and new yorkthat rise in cases is likely to have driven similar growth in subscriptions the way the initial outbreak in the spring didthe company also said it would�raise prices�in the us at the end of october from 1299month to 1399month on its most popular membership option while that move was widely expected it shows managements confidence in both its longterm growth trajectory and the performance in the fourth quarter a 2019 price increase caused netflix to report a slight decline in subscribers in the second quarter but that was during a seasonally slow quarter also it was a larger price hike as prices went up by 2 then compared to just a 1 hike last year it also proved to be a temporary speed bump as it returned to steady growth in the following quarteradditionally theres evidence of a streaming boom across the industry in the fourth quarter�disney�reported that it added 13 million subscribers in the two months leading up to the beginning of december while streaming aggregator�reelgood�noted massive growth across the board though it did say netflixs leading market share declined from 25 to 22 among reelgoods 2 million usersfinally netflix rolled out another strong slate of content in q4�the queens gambit�was a surprise hit globally sparking a surge in chess interest around the world and the company also seems to have scored victories with the first season of�emily in paris which was already renewed for its second season and season 4 of�the crown one of its strongest franchises towards the end of the quarter on dec 25 the company also released the first season of�bridgerton shonda rhimes first production for the service which has also received critical acclaimdata from reelgood shows that five of the top 10 streaming movies in the fourth quarter were released on netflix including�the haunting�hubie halloween�mank�the trial of the chicago 7 and elegy
4 quarters in a row missed eps overly inflated subscriber growth due to pandemic competition from everywhere even tmobil now has a 5g tv service to cut your cable and its fantastic once this virus is beat this stock will head back to reality and i will be waiting with my 12 month puts that im buying today if this gets anywhere near 600

so basically everyone was wrong there was no bloodbath and it was in the green anyone want to apologize

450 within 1 week
did you notice the green machine brought it up 4 points they will bring it to 420 soon
i keep avoiding netflix because i dont live the product but i guess its time to find a dip to get in
shortterm netflix may do well but don’t forget it will struggle to make new content during this lockdown and netflix has always been about the overwhelming content
dont understand why down so much premarket
to shorts i think in short term  nflx is still being pumped trade prudently just my opinion
thanks for the good run netflix but i’ll be banking while i can
funny thing is there isn’t that much shares short so it’s not the squeeze just hype
congrads to all of u longs
people were buying nflx up way before pandemic look at historic chart after pandemic they will come home from work pooped out and sit on the couch in front of nflx
as stated you need an iron gut to hold a lot of shares in this stock the moves are tremendousboth ways
huge buying volume huge call option volume shorts beware as jimmy z says you have been warned
any opinions on what strike we pin tomorrow
why doesnt someone take nflx private at 420
is this because of sloppy joe arrival or is there a different reason for nflx 8 dive
i would imagine it is difficult to manipulate a stock substantially higher when the manipulators are the only ones doing the buying
after rising 24 for the week it closes right on the high year over year subscriber growth remains unchanged at 25 after raising prices and investors continue to figure out what it means for instance netflix could double its subscription fees and settle for only 5 subscriber growth in a year revenue would be 30byr profit before tax would be 16byr and pe 7 adjust for a normal pe of 20 and the stock would be 785 we could see the stock continue to spike next week
omg its down 15 how is this possible

here is reason stock raise 10 for nearly flat marketafter revisiting expectations for netflix incs nflx international subscriber growth pivotal research analyst jeffrey wlodarczak upped his 12month price target to 400 from 300 shares of netflix after hitting a record close on monday were up more than 1 in early tuesday trade wlodarczak increased his longterm international subscriber forecast expecting the streaming giant to hit 250 million international subscribers by 2024 up from 230 million in its most recent fourthquarter earnings report netflix said it had 628 million international subscribers the company appears to operate in a virtuous cycle as the larger their subscriber base grows the more they can spend on original content which increases the potential target market for their service and dramatically increases barriers to entry wlodarczak wrote in a note all else being equal with the broader markets as long as netflix continues to beat and raise on subscribers we believe the stock will continue to work wlodarczak also raised his longterm expectations on average revenue per user as netflix displayed pricing power after its most recent price hike had little to no negative impact on subscriber growth shares of netflix have gained 122 in the last 12 months while the sp 500 index is up roughly 15here are red flags on his analysisthis analyst see 250million subscriber suddenly jump from already increase 230 million count for no reason now from 67m to 250 milion in 6 year each year they need to add 30m subscriber now looking into us short history this is unlikely remember most english speaking developed foreign country reaching saturation point non english speaking there isnt much content and with licensing cost increases and focus on own content that gap will get wider not smallernow value clearly reaching 250m mean not much growth left and then company likely issue 30b stocks over 6 year period at current price that mean it will value at 160b  likely 20b debt so 180b enterprise valuewith 250m international you will have 320m total 70m is beyond peak i think but just get over optimistic 10m  36b revenue they likely spending 20b on content only way they can reach 320m subscriber is spend lot more on content  5b on marketing  5b on servers and 2b3b on other  33bin other word still generate 3b profit even if we raise subscription by 20 it still likely 10b profit in 2024if you give 20 pe and discount 35 growth rate you still comeup with 150 fair market price

i don’t think there’s too much to worry about disney service in my opinion most folks have both as i do some don’t even have cable tv anymore so having both is an advantage to the customer it would be another issue if it was illegal to own both at the current subscription price most can afford both now i would start to worry if these services were to increase to 4050 monthly subscription that’s a price point where most would start to pick one or the other i wish both success as it has rocketed competition for better content
fast money told the nflx story perfect up we go
no floor with this one
i cant care less if you are a long or short but if you use terms like we warned you over and over and especially if you forgot how to turn of the capslock i cant really take you seriously go bother some other board
nflx subs are up earnings are up missing projections was taken way out of context by bias articles nflx 4 ever
i dont know if its true someone in india a higher up public official seems to have said the 50 million subscribers is max for india not 200 millionif so nflx seems likely to sell off another article seemed to point to googles youtube apple streaming amazon and others having had time to become a force of resistance add in the high debt and it seems to me the odds are nflx has seen its high for quite some time jmhoi like to back out and look at longer time periods seems to have a message the 4 year chart has 130 for support if it goes to the 313315 range again i forgot the low it will be the third time im thinking it breaks through to the downside then 385 to 316 or so was a nice shortdoesnt mean it is necessarily even going down from here or bouncing and then going down i just think it is likely to me they are losing money someone pointed out that they went more in debtt for new content then they made in revenue thats scrary but they do have the potential to bring in revenue for years on the content it seems to me they jumped in very heavily into massive debt trying to fend off the competition before the competition made them irrelevantyou know one serious issue is that apple and amazon and maybe others are willing to basically give away their streaming service just to get the subscribers to help them sell product in their stores thats a touch one for nflx to work against they have been quite creative though maybe they will bring on the education thing or something else they could start selling things compete agains amazon and apple fight fire with fire its possible they could come up with some ingenious ideas to keep growingi think they wont or it will be too little to late could be wrongim thinking it tanks to 130 and soonjust a hunch based on information i have explained here
this cant hold down here logically i’m guessing we see a strong reversal to 500 today if market stays strong
im curious to know the thoughts people have on the evaluation give a thumbs up if its undervalued and thumbs down if its over valued
why do you guys come on here every single day to say this thing is crashing to insert dollar amount by insert date it’s only gone up it goes up every single time you guys say it’s crashing

what ur think of earning
why nobody mentions the fact that nflx earnings are tanking big time
would like to see an intraday breakout
the stock market is broken
the company burned through about 3 billion last year and is expecting to do so again this year to offset the negative cash flow netflix has been borrowing heavily to pay for programming the los gatos california company had accumulated nearly 12 billion in debt before borrowing another 2 billion in an october bond offering

nflx is one of the world’s greatest companies the stock won’t stay down for long it’ll soon be back to its highs and go up from thereit’s a great time to buy i’m a long term holder bought at 423 and holding for 5000
load up on puts tomorrow morning 305 will be the high
the outcome will either make or break the nasdaq over the next week or so with additional earnings from faang
so we are roughly 6 weeks away from er would like an opinion on where we will get to before the er
potentially could challenge 450  500 in a couple of weeks predicting all faang stocks as well as most tech stocks will crush earnings we shall see
may up to 430
lets hope it closes green today

once ao was the first mover and leader of the internet once yahoo was the first mover and leader of email and searchnetflix does not have a huge selection of content many netflix investors are going to learn very quickly when disney marvel star wars pixar fox etc is pulled from netflix just how sparse their content is it will be worse when warnerhbo follows suit

this past week i sold fully knowing that nflx is going up tuition is due for my child and i cashed in at 520 33 months ago i jumped on board at 320 not a bad profit just ignore sonny black and wait or the next upward movefrustration did set in with the endless liberal decisions by netflix management signing the obamas cuties and praising kaepernick are just a few of the ideas that i desired to step away fromso long sorry sonny black isnt here to share my winnings with or he could carry home his share in a bag of course lol
it was a nice run from being a bag holder to making a profit and exiting too early was not sure what the fed was doing and thought it prudent to exit with a sort of decent profit i admire you longs who held in there especially with the nice pop ah go long stay strong good luck
investors worry about debt but there is really nothing to worry about this debt is self imposed and is entirely in the control of netflix if they want to they can dial down the borrowing and go back on the green i would worry if debt is a necessity rather than an option what is lesley to occur netflix going in this debt spiral or they gradually starting to wind down the borrowing as business accelerate naturally when the borrowing stops this stock will push 800
back to 338 ah
roku beat earnings nflx will without a doubt reach 525530 tomorrow

advice to the shorts never stand in front of a moving train if everyone is jumping into a stock regardless of your thesis dont go against the crowd the market will crush you even if your thesis proves correct later cover your shorts and live to trade another day
long term investment its a household name
morgan stanley raises pt to 480 from 370

i dont understand if you want to buy a company dont you want to purchase it at a cheaper price
if this is true then wow rocket shiphttpsfinanceyahoocomnewsnetflixcouldaddover6193500333html
netflix would not increase sub rates if it was expecting a poor quarterly increases in subscriptions would have to outway the losses due to fleeing subscribers bent on the 2 increase expect a positive report
nobody disputes the fact that netflix is a great company with great service globally the problem is that it needs to be trading at a reasonable value of 25 to 30 times eaenings which is about 100 per share apple is a great global company and it trades at a pe of 19 thats all

stock split 
330 this afternoon
three massive gaps since the beginning of the year this is extremely unusual with a stock that had no earning news it indicates probably a short squeeze even though there is not much short interest on nflx but it also tells me those gaps will close sooner rather than later
what did i say 56 by close of day
folks please report the nonnflx posts by clicking the three dots on the top right of each of these posts and then select report as abuse and pick looks like spam i do this on every one of these useless posts and not only do they disappear from my board but hopefully yahoo will permanently delete them especially if enuf people do the same thing that im doing must do this on every one of these posts that you see please

375400 is the target by next friday
if market stays steady tomorrow netflix will rise significantly it did the same thing last quarter it reported on tuesday evening january 21st and then the stock fell on wednesday january 22nd about three and three quarters percent on thursday january 23rd the stock went up about three and a half percent so keep faith thats been its general pattern so if market doesnt tank due to economy oil or covid19 and the market is able to stay steady i believe netflix will rise

you can safely predict nflx will need to raise another 24 billion in the second half of the year perhaps even more whether its going to be through debt offering most likely or a secondary stock issuance neither is going to be good for the stock price it looks like nflx is going to top 20 billion in debt in a couple of years and they wont be able to sell the pie in the sky anymore without showing positive cash flow its just an accounting trick that allows them to amortize the cost of creating content that shows an accounting profit which can be manipulated to make analysts happy the cash flow on the other hand does not lie and tells a very different story watch out nflx is an extremely risky stock and has all the pieinthesky expectations priced in and none of the risk

netflix almost 5 down yet i’m still here look disney will take 4 years to be profitable on their streaming if they can even reach 80 million subs by then netflix just added 400 films to its library and netflix netflix will beat earnings again
everybody knows netflix numbers will be much better then expected this time because of the great shows that came out in november and december all those that signed up then are paying now next to that the price increase
