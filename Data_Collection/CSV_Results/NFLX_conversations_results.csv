Recent headlines and conversations for NFLX
i applaud those who bought calls andor stock ahead of earnings i played it somewhat safe and deployed a 525540 call spread so my upside is capped at 540 still it was minimal risk for what will be a nice return tomorrow

funny we subscribe to netflix but we hardly ever watch it anymore wonder if there are others like us out there
a lot of shorties getting clobbered oh how i love that
i like netflix as a service and investor but swing trading this thing i shorted it all the way up to 593 what people dont realize is it surged way too high and fast for the short term the potential buybacks are not for sure and wont be for a long while they are also in a catch 22 with covid since the subscribers have surged due to covid but they are also running much behind on new content also due to covid  catch 22 i have already watched everything i can possibly find on there and im cancelling after the second price increase for the service taking place only a few months apart until they have a ton of the new anticipated releases which all have no actual dates on them i think many will follow like myself and no way this price keep sup this high until it dips way lower though i do think it will come back up but maybe not until end of year
nflx added more subscribers  raised the price but the earning per share did not meet expectations is that make sense not for me
chart is literally doing the exact same thing as yesterday if so looks like we should be hitting 564 ish

ok with the fervor dying down a bit i’d like to reask my question from yesterday netflix has a massive debt load interest rates are going up has anyone looked into how this will impact their profitsnot trying to attack just wonderingand to head off the one response i got yesterday i know they are saying they will not need to borrow new money but they still have to deal with the debt they already have and interest rates will not remain constant as debt is refinanced or as bond values go down

i was about to buy stocks just prior to earnings and put a stop loss just in case it drops then i thought forget it and left home now i come back and its up 13 
and this is dropping why either it did well on its quarterly report or it didnt granted investors will take profits but is there any rational reason beyond that for this to drop 5 in two days if the company is indeed doing well
